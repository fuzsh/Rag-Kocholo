        "text": "James MacAndrew\n\nMACANDREW, JAMES (1820-87) was born at Aberdeen, and educated there and at the Ayr Academy, before going into mercantile life. His training was completed in London.\n\nIn 1845 he became a member of the London branch of the Otago Lay Association, importing into their discussions with the Colonial Office great industry, tact and untiring hopefulness. In 1850 he purchased the iron schooner Titan, 161 tons, loaded her with merchandise on account of himself and his friends, and sailed with his family and a select party. They arrived in Otago on 17 Jan 1851. Macandrew soon became a leading member of the Constitutional Association, which was agitating for self government for the colony. He established his business at the corner of Manse and Stafford streets, and while the store was being erected visited in his schooner the northern settlements of New Zealand. His remarkable energy was matched by unconquerable confidence in the future of the Colony. With Reynolds on board, the Titan sailed with a cargo of Otago produce to sell in Australia and California, bringing back merchandise and live stock for the province. Macandrew assisted in the establishment of lime-kilns in the Kaikorai valley and of flourmills at Green Island. He despatched the first shipment of wool direct to London. In the yards of James Adam he had two ships built, the Star and the Bon Accord, and he infected the Provincial Council with his passion for communications. In 1858 he employed the Queen in the intercolonial and coastal trade. As the first steamer which visited Dunedin, she received a salute of 24 guns on dropping anchor in the harbour. The Pirate and the Pride of the Yarra followed under his auspices. He advocated a fast mail service with Great Britain, and originated the line by way of Panama. He took a leading part in promoting the breakwater at Oamaru and the Dunedin-Port Chalmers and Clutha railways, and he moved in the Council for the construction of the graving dock, which as Superintendent he opened. He made an arduous journey to Southland, and saw the first building erected on the site of Invercargill.\n\nWhen the first Provincial Council was elected in 1853 Macandrew was returned for the Dunedin Country district, and when the Council met he was elected speaker, resigning a few days later to become a member of the executive. The day after his election to the Council he was returned unopposed as M.H.R. for Dunedin. It was he who moved that each sitting should open with prayer to Divine Providence. After a long debate the form of prayer was adopted. Macandrew was a member of the first executive (1854), before the introduction of responsible government. In the province his position continued to become substantial. He was a member of the first town board of Dunedin (1855). For three years (1856-59) he was speaker of the Provincial Council, and when Cargill retired at the end of 1859 he was elected Superintendent.\n\nIt seemed likely that with his undoubted ability, his patent sincerity, his optimism and magnetic influence over the affections of his fellows, Macandrew could in a few years have attained to the highest position in New Zealand. That was rendered impossible by a painful incident. A shortage was disclosed in the public funds in connection with emigration. Called to account, Macandrew indignantly repudiated any dishonesty, complained that the investigation was prompted by hostile parties in the province, and, meeting it with contumacy, was declared guilty by the Council, and on its petition removed from the superintendency. Richardson assumed the office in accordance with the constitution, and was duly elected (Jun. 1861), but Macandrew actually polled 189 votes against Richardson's 292 though he fought the campaign from within the walls of the prison.\n\nBy 1865 Macandrew was again in the General Assembly as the representative of Bruce, and two years later, when the superintendency fell vacant, he defeated Thomas Dick by 2,259 votes to 1,892. He was never again in danger of being displaced. At the last superintendency election (1878) he polled 3,702 votes, Gillies 2,759 and Graham 26. The faith and affection of the people of Otago never altered. He was their David, but, as a biographer has said, 'the excellent talents of economy and administration were denied to him. His mind was never disciplined, nor was his judgment sound. He was given a specious and original genius, which enabled him to initiate many important public movements and to see further into the future than men who made better ministers of public works. He set a pre-eminent example of patriotism and public spirit.' For the remainder of the provincial period (1867-76) Macandrew was the undisputed Superintendent of Otago. In colonial politics Grey, one of his closest personal friends, took him into his ministry (1877-78) as Secretary for Lands and Minister of Immigration and Public Works, and he was in the Stout-Vogel government of 1884. He represented Clutha (1866-70), Port Chalmers (1871-75), Dunedin City (1875-79) and Port Chalmers again (1879-87). While in Grey's ministry he obtained from Parliament the authorisation of three important railways, the North Island Main Trunk, the Midland, and the Otago Central. He favoured easier terms of land settlement, and obtained the insertion in the land bill of 1884 of a clause providing for grants of land to Highland crofters.\n\nHe considered they would make excellent settlers, and, with his customary optimism, pictured 40,000 families being brought out under this scheme. He was a firm believer in the union of English-speaking peoples as a factor in securing the peace of the world, and on his motion Parliament carried a resolution embodying this aspiration (1885).\n\nAs a Scot, Macandrew's interest in education amounted almost to a religion. He was active in setting apart large reserves from the provincial estate. In 1869 he gave valuable evidence before a parliamentary committee in favour of a university in Dunedin, and when Parliament refused to accede to his proposals he introduced them in the Provincial Council. The University was eventually founded in 1870 under a provincial ordinance. Macandrew was a member of the University council until his death. It was the last public body that he attended, and on his deathbed he remarked: 'It is my wish and hope that Otago University will get a royal charter to grant degrees. It is a matter I have had much at heart for many years.' As Superintendent, Macandrew took a keen interest in the founding of the Normal Training College in Dunedin, the Benevolent Institution, the Industrial School at Caversham, and the Otago Boys' High School. It could never be said of him that he placed his own interest first. A critical biographer wrote after his death: 'Neither as a member of the community nor as a politician can selfishness be written against the name of James Macandrew.' His weakness was his 'absolute lack of business capacity or attention to detail.' He imagined on a generous scale, but could not study the minutiae of his schemes. He never imagined with an eye to profit or praise for himself.\n\nMacandrew died on 28 Feb 1887. His wife (Elizabeth Hunter Reynolds) died on 28 Feb 1875.\n\nOtago P.C.

His father (James Mackay, 1804-75, q.v.) having purchased land at Wakapuaka, they commenced farming there, but soon had difficulty with the Ngati-Tama, who disputed the sale of their land. In the seven years James spent with his father he learned a great deal about stock and farming, and in 1852 he took a run at Cape Farewell and 1,500 acres of freehold land fronting on Golden Bay. While raising sheep and cattle on these properties, he commenced a series of important explorations, the first (in 1856) being to the head waters of the Aorere and the Takaka rivers. He was an intrepid and fearless bushman and, having mastered the Maori language, was able to use natives in his exploration. In 1855 he met Donald McLean (q.v.), who was much impressed with his qualifications. Early in 1857 Mackay, with Maori companions, started from Cape Farewell and walked to the Mawhera (Grey) river, which they ascended for 50 miles. With the chief Tarapuhi, Mackay explored the river higher up; he sounded the bar and ascertained that small vessels could enter, and returned to Nelson (walking along the coast) to show specimens of coal from Brunner's seam and to report that the pakihi lands of the Mawheraiti were suited for pastoral occupation.\n\nIn Jan 1858 Mackay was appointed assistant native secretary for the South Island, his first duty being to set apart native reserves. On the resignation of Domett, Brunner and Heaphy he became sole commissioner of reserves and adjusted most of the disputes. When gold was discovered at Collingwood he had to negotiate with the native owners. He settled many disputes on behalf of miners and natives, and in Oct 1858 was appointed warden on the field. In 1859 he was sent to the East Coast to negotiate the purchase of the Kaikoura block. This done, he was sent to acquire the whole of the West Coast from Cape Farewell to Milford Haven. Crossing the divide, he encountered at lake Sumner the Nelson surveyor, John Rochfort, with a party defining the provincial boundaries. The combined party crossed the saddle into the Teremakau by way of the Hurunui and Harper's Pass and then separated, Rochfort proceeding to lake Brunner and the Grey, and Mackay to the Teremakau and the sea. Mackay met with great difficulty in his negotiations owing to the reluctance of the Maori to part with the country from which they derived greenstone, and their anxiety as to adequate reserves. In Aug 1859 he tried, with one Maori, to reach Nelson by way of the Inangahua saddle, but had to return to Greymouth and walked on to the Buller, where he found the cutter Supply and so reached Nelson. He proceeded to Auckland to interview the Governor (Gore-Browne), and in Feb 1860 set out again for the coast fully authorised to agree to the reserves asked for by the Maori chiefs.\n\nTravelling overland to the Maruia plain and the source of the Grey river, Mackay reached Mawhera pa in seven weeks. The schooner Gipsy arrived about the same time with government supplies, and nearly three weeks later Haast, who had also travelled by the Maruia and the Grey, reached the pa. Mackay started with a strong party of Maori and pakeha, and covered a distance of 135 miles to Okarito, where the hui was to be held. Having discussed the sale with the chiefs there, the party proceeded to Bruce Bay (40 miles). From here the travellers returned to Mawhera pa, at the mouth of the Grey, where the deed was signed on 21 May 1860, Mackay signing on behalf of the Government. At the end of 1858, with Major John Lockett, Mackay made an exploration of the headwaters of the Takaka and Karamea, discovering Mts Lockett and Peel and the Diamond lakes. His last expedition on the coast (in 1862) was for the purpose of blazing a track up the Aorere river to the mouth of the Heaphy. On this occasion he walked from Karamea to Westport in one day. Mackay reached Collingwood by way of the Heaphy, previously unexplored, and the Aorere. He left the West Coast in Jul 1863.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Waikato war he was summoned to Auckland, and in his capacity of assistant native secretary had charge of the Maori prisoners. His intimate knowledge of the people and their language gave him great influence, and he was sent to the Thames as civil commissioner (May 1864) to assist in settling the natives who had been in rebellion and returned to their homes after Orakau (Mar-Apr 1864). In these negotiations Mackay came into conflict with the senior military officer (Colonel Greer) when he insisted on explaining clearly to the King tribes who wished to surrender that their lands had been confiscated. Greer put him under arrest. On the discovery of gold at the Thames (Jul 1867), Mackay impressed upon the Government his conviction that this providential occurrence would offset the depression which overhung the Colony. In cooperation with the chief Wirope Hoterini Taipari, he negotiated agreements with the Ngati-Tama-Tera, the Ngai-te-Rangi and the Ngati-Maru, which enabled the field to be opened, and in collaboration with miners' representatives he drew up satisfactory rules. As warden and resident magistrate Mackay showed remarkable energy and judgment in his administration, providing in turn for the subsequent rushes at Kauaeranga and Kennedy's Bay. His position was rendered so difficult, however, by the jealousies of the provincial and general Governments, that he tendered his resignation. The Government insisted that he should carry on the duties of the native office, at any rate to the end of the year, and he continued to render useful service as civil agent and commissioner at native gatherings in Waikato and Thames.\n\nIn 1869 Mackay intended to oppose Gillies for the superintendency of Auckland, but left the field to Williamson. He was elected to the Provincial Council for Thames in 1870 and again at the end of the year, sitting till 1873. He was then agent for the General Government in Waikato. In 1875 he petitioned against the return of Sir George Grey as M.H.R. for Thames, on the ground that he had already been elected for Auckland City West. The select committee decided against him. In 1879 Mackay was again for a short time resident magistrate and warden at Greymouth. He stood for Auckland City North in 1887, and was narrowly defeated by Cadman for Coromandel. Mackay died on 13 Oct 1912.\n\nAuckland P.C. Proc.; Nelson P.C. Proc. and Gaz.; App. H.R., 1869 A15, 16, 17, 18, 1873 G3, 1876 Il; Parltry Record; Thames Jubilee (p); Reid; O. S.

His father was one of the chiefs of the taua from Waikato which took Pukerangiora (1831) and he accompanied his father on this campaign. Coming under the influence of the Roman Catholic missionaries, he was baptised as Rewi, a name that he renounced in the height of the King movement.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Taranaki war Rewi was sent to inquire into the causes of the quarrel, and Waikato and Ngati-Maniapoto acted upon his report that the resistance of Wiremu Kingi te Rangitake (q.v.) was justified. Rewi showed great courage in the Taranaki fighting. He was one of the leaders in the desperate night attack on No. 3 redoubt at Huirangi, which was repulsed with great loss. He took Wiremu Kingi back with him to Kihikihi. Moved by the conviction that the government intended to undermine Maori nationality, he threw himself with fiery energy into the King movement. It was he who hoisted the King flag at the meeting at Ngaruawahia when Potatau was elected King. He was regarded as the King's prime minister and was (T. S. Grace says), \"a far greater man than the King himself.\" He did actually resent the King's trying to exercise influence over his tribe (Ngati-Maniapoto).\n\nWhen Gorst (q.v.) arrived at Te Awamutu charged with the duty of inaugurating English civilisation and education amongst the Maori, Rewi adopted an attitude of stern hostility. He personally warned Gorst to leave, and wrote to Governor Grey a letter, which was never answered, exhorting him to remove his representative before he came to harm. The Waikato and Ngati-Haua sections of the Kingite Maori condemned Rewi's conduct, since the land at Te Awamutu was in possession of the King; but he persisted in his opposition, took offence at Gorst's paper, Pihoihoi Mokemoke, and organised a party to remove the offending magistrate. He looked on while Aporo sacked the office of the paper and ejected Gorst from his post (24 Mar 1863). Though he maintained that he was averse to fighting, and his sincerity is beyond question, the impetuosity of Rewi did much to precipitate war. When he received a letter from the King meeting at Mataitawa (Taranaki) reporting that the Governor had completed the barracks at Tataraimaka Rewi replied, without consulting his fellow chiefs, \"Strike the pakeha!\" He himself mustered a taua and moved to Hangatiki with the intention of creating a diversion by canoeing down the Waikato river and raiding the settlements at Te Ia. Overruled by Wiremu Tamihana and others, he led his men into the Hunua forest. Rewi fought with great energy throughout the Waikato campaign. It was against his advice that the King forces made their stand at Orakau in a weak position chosen by the older men. For three days they held out against an overwhelming British force, replying to General Cameron's demand to surrender with the historic defiance: \"Ka whawhai tonu, ake, ake, ake!\" (\"I will fight on for ever and ever\"). Eventually he decided to evacuate the pa in the night and the operation was carried out, successfully, though with the loss of about half of the Maori force. Reaching the Puniu river, Rewi halted to rest the remnant of his force (about 60 men) and then retreated into the heart of the King country.\n\nThough he was not a practising Christian, Rewi insisted that the campaign should be carried on according to the customs of the pakeha, and sternly discountenanced mutilation of the dead and other ancient observances with regard to them. Early in the war a reward was offered for his apprehension, but no further steps were taken against him and the government had good reason in later years to value the influence which he exerted in improving the relations between the two races. He welcomed Sir Donald McLean's visit to Waikato in 1869 as \"a streak of light before the dawn.\" When Te Kooti visited Waikato in that year to obtain assistance from the King tribes Rewi accompanied him back to Taupo to see whether he was as invincible as was supposed. After Te Kooti's defeat at Porere Rewi returned to Waikato, angrily declaring that Te Kooti's gods were imposters. In later years Rewi's influence was eclipsed by that of Tamati Ngapora (q.v.). When he relented towards the government and desired to meet the Duke of Edinburgh at Ngaruawahia it was Tamati who objected and prevailed. Nevertheless Manga, as Rewi was called after the war, was always a man of importance in the King country, and he exerted his influence constantly in the interests of the Maori and of good fellowship with the pakeha. He saved the life of James Mackay (q.v.) in 1873 when his investigations into the death of Timothy Sullivan at Pukekura brought him into disfavour with the King natives.\n\nIn 1879, at the invitation of the Native Minister (Hon J. Sheehan), Rewi paid his first visit to Auckland for twenty years. He received a cordial welcome, both popular and official, attended many banquets, and returned to Waikato in company with the Governor (Sir Hercules Robinson). In 1883 he joined in the petition from the King country against land-selling, drink and immorality, and he resisted successfully the endeavour to introduce liquor amongst the King Maoris by licensing a public-house at Otorohanga. Once more, in 1890, Rewi visited Auckland by invitation to participate in the jubilee celebrations. He was for some years in frail health and lived quietly at Kihikihi in a house built for him by the government. There Seddon visited him in Mar 1894. In Apr at the public expense a monument was erected to Rewi as \"an upholder of good between the European and Maori nations and a constant supporter of the seal of the treaty of Waitangi.\" Two months later, on 21 Jun 1894, he died, widely honoured by both races. Physically Rewi was below the average height and somewhat slender. Europeans found him after the war careworn, sad and thoughtful.\n\nApp. H.R., 1860-80, pass.; T. S.

She lived during her childhood at various homes in Wellington and Karori, and was educated in the first instance at the Karori school and afterwards at Miss Swainson's school (later known as Marsden School) in Fitzherbert terrace. While there she evinced a taste for writing, and contributed to the school magazine verse and prose which showed the spark of inspiration. In 1903, with her two elder sisters, she was taken to England and entered a finishing school known as Queen's College, in Harley street, where she edited the college magazine. She was there three years, and incidentally attended the Royal Academy of Music for the study of the 'cello. Reaching New Zealand on her return in Dec 1906, Kathleen soon became impatient of the narrow surroundings and unartistic society of the young country. The desire to write became a passion from which she could find no respite in counter attractions, and she persistently begged her parents to allow her to return to London to make her way in the world of letters. She had read much more deeply and adventurously than most girls of her age. She studied earnestly the reactions and emotions of human beings as she met them in her daily life; and she practised her hand at simple, reflective prose and modest but competent verse. As early as 1904 she had written lyrics, two of which were set to music by her uncle (F. V. Waters) and sung by him at a public dinner.\n\nThough this sojourn of 20 months was her only experience of her native land after her childhood, she utilised it to garner impressions and to perfect her literary style. With delicate sensibility and photographic precision she recorded her sum of human experience, which in the years to come was to be somewhat restricted. She had already dedicated herself to literature before she left England, and her life in New Zealand during those months was engrossed in a struggle with her parents to be allowed to try her wings in London. She read in the library of Parliament a good deal of philosophy (including Heine, Nietzsche and Dr Inazo Nitobe), and much modern poetry, drama and French literature. She received some encouragement from T. L. Mills and E. J. Brady, editor of The Native Companion, and at length, in Jul 1908, when she was only 20 years of age, she left for England. She had already, in her contributions to the Native Companion and Harpers' Bazaar, used the nom de plume 'Katherine Mansfield,' by which alone she is known in the literary world. 'Ambition is a curse,' she wrote in her diary, 'if you are not proof against everything else; unless you are willing to sacrifice yourself to your ambition.' Within three years of her return to London Katherine Mansfield had established her reputation as a writer of short stories of exquisite workmanship and fine sensibility. In 1911 appeared In a German Pension. Meanwhile trials and experience of a deeply emotional kind came to her. On 2 Mar 1909 she made an injudicious marriage (with George Bowden) which meant nothing to her spiritually and greatly embarrassed her for some years. It was not dissolved till 29 Apr 1918, when her life had already for some years been linked with that of J. Middleton Murry. In 1910 and 1911 she contributed to The New Age, and in 1911-13 to Rhythm and The Blue Review, of which Murry was associate-editor. In 1915, with the help of Murry and D. H. Lawrence, she compiled and edited a magazine called The Signature. The war of 1914-18, despite its distractions, brought about the renewal of a friendship with her young brother (Leslie) which had been the dominating factor in her personal life. It was broken again, all too soon, by his death on active service (7 Oct 1915). Her own ill-health was promoted by the alarms and deprivations of war, and tuberculosis was now established in her system. She suffered another severe shock in the death of her mother (on Aug 1918).\n\nThrough it all Katherine Mansfield wrote fervently and meticulously, never satisfied with the quality of what she had done and always feeling, as she told A. R. Orage, that 'there is not one that I dare show to God.' She could not read anything she had written without feeling self-contempt. For her matter in these days of intellectual poverty and withdrawal from the world she turned to the treasured memories of her childhood, from which she wrought finely polished gems of prose and verse. Her own most exacting critic, she sent back to the crucible again and again; and when she died she begged her husband to 'tear up and burn as much as possible. He will understand that I desire to leave as few traces of my camping ground here as possible.' As her strength failed and she had to remain an invalid she wrote that she was 'dying of the poverty of life ... I am tired of my little stories, like birds bred in cages.' She and Murry were married on 30 Apr 1918. She died at Fontainebleau on 9 Jan 1923, already at the age of 35 the best known and most highly esteemed of New Zealand writers.\n\nMuch of Katherine Mansfield's best work was done for the periodical press, notably the Athenaeum and the Adelphi. Collections were published at different times, of which the most noteworthy are Prelude (1918), Je ne Parle pas Francais (1919), Bliss (1920), The Garden Party (1922), The Dove's Nest (1923), Something Childish (1924), The Aloe (1930). Her collected Poems were published in 1923; her Journals (edited by Murry) in 1927; her Letters in the following year, and a volume of reviews, Novels and Novelists, in 1930. The Aloe was an early draft of Prelude. A bibliography of Katherine Mansfield's work, by Ruth E. Mantz, appeared in 1931; and a Life, by Miss Mantz and J. Middleton Murry, in 1933. In 1921 the Femina-Vie Heureuse committee submitted Bliss, in conjunction with Rose Macaulay's Dangerous Ages and Brett Young's The Black Diamond. Two years later it submitted Prelude.\n\nG. H.

His father was a blacksmith and small farmer of undistinguished birth, a good living man and a Wesleyan Methodist. Samuel went to the village school and then to the free Grammar School at Hull, but left early to enter the shop of an uncle at Horsforth, near Leeds. Showing a disposition to enter the Church, he was adopted by the Elland Clerical Society and placed at Magdalene Hall, Cambridge (1790). There he became a friend of Charles Simeon, one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society.\n\nA diligent, unassuming student, he attracted the attention of William Wilberforce, through whose influence he was offered in 1792, before being ordained, a chaplaincy in the convict colony of New South Wales, where Wilberforce was most anxious to have a good type of man. Marsden hesitated to accept, but his firmness of principle, intrepidity of spirit and strong judgment had so impressed his friends that he was prevailed upon, and in 1793 he was appointed second chaplain. Having been ordained in the meantime, and married at Hull to Elizabeth Fristan (1772-1835), he proceeded to London and joined the convict ship William (1 Jul 1793). On the voyage out Marsden had his first insight into the rough characters of the convicts and of the ship's company. Arriving in Port Jackson on 10 Mar 1794, he took up his abode with his wife in the barracks at Parramatta. Shortly afterwards, owing to the resignation of the senior chaplain, Marsden assumed that post. To his regret, he was prevailed upon to accept also the position of a magistrate of the colony. This not only required him to inflict punishment upon evildoers, which he did reluctantly, but it also brought him into conflict with leading citizens and with fellow magistrates of doubtful antecedents (with whom he occasionally refused to sit). Besides interesting himself in the moral welfare of the colony, which he found in a shocking state, Marsden took up the hundred acres of land allotted to each civil servant, and before long he had established a farm which became a model for convicts and free settlers. By this means the Colony became less dependent than it had been upon food supplies imported from England.\n\nWhile chaplain in New South Wales, Marsden took a keen interest in the South Sea missions of the London Missionary Society. Though his work in New Zealand was carried out under the auspices of the Church Missionary Society, he remained for many years the adviser of the London Society. In 1808 he sailed on furlough to England, taking samples of his own wool to be made into cloth, and proposals for the reform of the convict system in the Colony. He persuaded the Home Government to introduce manual training for the convicts and to allow a certain number of their wives to accompany them overseas. He also obtained concessions for female convicts in the Colony, whose working and living conditions were degrading in the extreme. During an interview with George III he was promised two merino sheep from the royal flocks. When he returned to New South Wales in 1810, Marsden took with him not only a library for the use of convicts and settlers, but several tradesmen to instruct the convicts; and a number of farm animals-horses, cattle, sheep and poultry-to improve the livestock of the Colony.\n\nHe had, moreover, persuaded the new Church Missionary Society to take an interest in the natives of New Zealand, and believing that the arts of civilisation should go hand in hand with the Gospel, he got two laymen, William Hall and John King, designated by the Society to open a mission in New Zealand. In the same ship, the Ann, by which he returned to Australia, Marsden discovered and befriended a young Maori of good birth, Ruatara, who had been deceived and cheated by English shipmasters on his visit to England. Ruatara learned some agriculture while staying at Parramatta and when some months later he returned to his native land he took with him a quantity of seed wheat, with full instructions as to sowing. Having purchased on his own responsibility the brig Active, for the benefit of the mission service in New Zealand, Marsden wished to proceed in her to install Hall and King as the nucleus of the mission, for which Ruatara's influence at Bay of Islands had prepared the ground. Being refused the requisite leave of absence to go himself, he sent the Active in 1814, with Hall and Kendall (q.v., who had been sent out from England to supplement the mission). They returned to the Colony bringing a number of Maori chiefs to stay at Parramatta. Governor Macquarie then gave Marsden full permission to proceed to New Zealand to establish the mission. It had become clear to him that steps must soon be taken to regulate the intercourse between the Maori and residents of New South Wales and to protect the natives against lawless whites. Marsden sailed from Port Jackson on 19 Nov 1814, with a party of 36, including Kendall, Hall and King, the chiefs Hongi, Ruatara, Korokoro and Tui, a smith and two sawyers. After touching at North Cape to communicate with the natives, and spending a night at Whangaroa to settle a long-standing feud between the Whangaroa and Bay of Islands tribes, Marsden proceeded to Bay of Islands, where the Active anchored on 23 Dec, not far from a village belonging to Ruatara. The landing of a horse struck the natives with amazement.\n\nAt 10 o'clock on Christmas morning, Marsden held the first Christian service in New Zealand, a great crowd of natives attending, with all the principal chiefs. Preaching from the text 'Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy' (St Luke ii, 10), Marsden was attentively listened to, though his hearers did not understand what he said. He showed his fearless and trusting character by allowing 28 chiefs, fully armed, to accompany him in the Active on a cruise to various ports. At Bay of Islands he purchased one hundred acres of land for the purposes of the mission, and then returned to Sydney, taking 10 chiefs with him. A few days after his departure the chief Ruatara died. At the instigation of Marsden the chiefs Tuhi and Titore were sent to England in H.M.S. Kangaroo, were well treated while there, and kept as fully employed as possible learning useful arts, and helping in the compilation of a Maori dictionary. When they returned Marsden accompanied them back to New Zealand in 1819, and took advantage of the visit to select a site for a mission station at Kerikeri, in Hongi's territory. On the earnest entreaty of Tuhi he promised that another would shortly be established in the territory of the disappointed Korokoro, at Whangaroa. Undaunted by the hostilities of the warring tribes, Marsden during his three months' stay in New Zealand on this occasion journeyed more than 700 miles, visiting many disputants and prevailing upon them to abandon their expeditions.\n\nAt the request of the Admiralty he visited New Zealand again in the following year in H.M.S. Dromedary, to inquire into the use of New Zealand timber for spars. They were anxious years for the new mission. The return of Hongi from England, elated with his experiences and flushed with the possession of firearms, disturbed the relations of all the northern tribes, revived the bloody wars of earlier days, and encouraged the natives to treat the whites with contempt. On a visit in 1823, Marsden had to dismiss a missionary for trading in arms, but he took with him a pillar of strength for the New Zealand field, the Rev Henry Williams, with his wife and family. The hope that he had entertained of seeing the Maori tribes organised as a political unit was frustrated by the ambitions of Hongi, who aimed at the supreme kingship.\n\nOn Marsden's fifth visit, in 1827, the outlook was still gloomy in the extreme. The Wesleyan mission at Whangaroa having been destroyed, the Rev Mr Turner sought refuge at Parramatta. Marsden hurried across in H.M.S. Rainbow to prevent the abandonment of his mission, which he found happily surviving the storm. The strong personality of Williams was equal to the occasion. On his seventh and last visit (1837) Marsden landed at Hokianga (with his youngest daughter) and crossed to Bay of Islands, where he joined H.M.S. Rattlesnake for a cruise round the coast as the guest of Captain Hobson. He believed that the early inauguration of British sovereignty in New Zealand was inevitable.\n\nThough his main interest in later life was the New Zealand mission, Marsden continued to be the trusted adviser of the London Missionary Society in regard to its establishments in the Pacific islands. On his return from England in 1810 he found at Parramatta the disheartened missionaries who had fled from Tahiti, and encouraged them to return-as they eventually did-and to persevere in that field. He even proposed going himself to the Friendly Islands if necessary. It was not necessary, and he had the satisfaction of seeing the island missions one after another firmly established. He assisted generously missions of all denominations and made himself personally responsible for considerable sums of money on their behalf.\n\nFrom the time of his first arrival in New South Wales Marsden frequently came into conflict with his fellow officials on account of his strenuous efforts to improve the condition of the convict population. The training farm attached to his parsonage at Parramatta developed into an important institution in connection with the manual training of Australian blacks, convicts and Maori visitors. Orphan schools were established on his urgent advocacy. His efforts to reform the living and working conditions of female convict workers in the cloth factory brought him into a bitter controversy. He was removed for a while from the magistracy, but completely vindicated in the report of the Bigge commission.\n\nOn the establishment of a bishopric in New South Wales, Marsden ceased to be the senior chaplain of the Colony, a respite from administrative cares which he welcomed with advancing years. Mrs Marsden had died in 1835, and his own health declined rapidly after his last visit to New Zealand. He died on 12 May 1838. Marsden was a man of great energy, decision and honesty of purpose; pious, but endowed with a keen knowledge of the world and men. Single-minded to a degree, he had his main interest in later life in the missions to the different branches of the Polynesian race; but he never relaxed his advocacy of measures of reform in the sordid conditions of life in New South Wales.\n\nJ.

In 1829 he graduated (as 26th wrangler and 4th classic), and took the second chancellor's gold medal. Two years later he was elected a fellow and tutor of his College. In 1832 he proceeded M.A., and in June of that year entered Lincoln's Inn to read for the bar. He was called in 1836 and two years later resigned his fellowship. He never entered law chambers, but was with Cracknell, an equity draughtsman and conveyancer.\n\nMartin contended through life against a delicate constitution, and he was not reluctant when Bishop Selwyn suggested that he should come to New Zealand in the position of chief justice. Though he was not suited to the rough life of the colonies, he welcomed escape from the drudgery of the law in England. He married Mary Ann, daughter of the Rev W. Parker, a prebendary of St Paul's, and sailed in Apr 1841 for New Zealand. Swainson and Outhwaite (q.v.) were fellow passengers in the Tyne, and during the voyage much time was devoted by the trio to consideration of the rules which would be necessary to govern the practice of the Supreme Court in New Zealand. He arrived in Wellington in Aug, and took up his duties in Auckland in Sep. Mrs Martin came to New Zealand a few months later.\n\nShy and retiring, Martin shrank from publicity, and suffered acute mental distress when presiding at criminal sessions. At an early stage he became interested in the Maori people, and during his 30 years in New Zealand he was as sincere and strenuous an advocate of their rights as his judicial position allowed. Presiding at the trial of Maketu for the murder of a European, he took great pains, with the help of G. Clarke as interpreter, to expound the English law as clearly as possible, hoping thereby to impress the Maori mind with its advantages over the customs of their race. In passing sentence of death, the first inflicted on a Maori by a pakeha court of justice, Martin uttered with deep emotion: 'Maketu, in your own emphatic language, I bid you go to your forefathers.' A natural alliance was formed between Martin, Selwyn and Swainson on behalf of the Maori people. It was this alliance that dissuaded Shortland (Oct 1842) from making war upon defiant tribes at Tauranga. In the same month Martin at Wellington refused to give instant judgment on an application for a warrant to arrest Rangihaeata. He reserved judgment partly because the hearing was ex parte and partly on a technical doubt as to the act under which the application was made. Early in 1843 he refused the warrant, thereby possibly delaying the outbreak which occurred at Wairau later in the year. Martin in these early years made many arduous journeys on foot all over the North Island, holding asizes and meeting his new colleague (H. S Chapman, q.v.) to discuss points of procedure. He had many close friendships with chiefs of the first rank, notably Te Heuheu, Te Wherowhero, Tamati Ngapora and Tamati Waka Nene. An accomplished philologist, he made good progress with the Maori language, and was soon able to converse with the chiefs on equal terms. In Oct 1843 he commenced the erection of a native chapel close to his home in Auckland.\n\nIn 1844, pursuant to an engagement made months before, he walked overland to join Selwyn at Taupo, where he met Te Heuheu on terms of mutual respect. Te Wherowhero's dying message was a request to Martin to be good to his people. Martin's natural disposition to champion the cause of the natives brought him under criticism by the impatient settlers of the New Zealand Company, whose desire to establish themselves in life was apt to run counter to the best interests of the native occupants of the land.\n\nIn 1847 Martin joined with Selwyn in a spirited protest against Earl Grey's instructions regarding the new constitution, and they pressed their view insistently upon Governor Grey. Martin drew up a clear statement of the case under the title England and the New Zealanders, which was printed at the college press in 1847. In it he contended that the instructions to the Governor 'involve a breach of the national faith of Britain and a violation of established law.' The protest, written in a manly and temperate tone, won the day, and did not require to be published, but copies at a later date gained publicity through inadvertent channels.\n\nMeanwhile the rules of the courts, owing to the long distance between Auckland and Wellington and the difficulties of travel, made slow progress. Once Martin was to walk overland to meet his colleague at New Plymouth; at another time at Wanganui or Taupo. In 1851 we find him writing to Chapman lamenting the delay in constructing the codes of procedure; it seemed that yet another year would be necessary to complete the forms and rules for the first two classes of actions, tort and contract. \"It is impossible to desire,\" he wrote (31 Mar 1851), \"that the foundations of our great work should be laid without adequate consideration, and I should be sorry if you supposed that I found in the delay anything surprising or unreasonable... Our work has come to be in the place of sons and daughters... It is not only amongst the clearest of professional duties but it is the only directly parental interest which is given to me. I am quite willing, and perhaps I am by natural disposition of my own more inclined than you or any energetic man would be, to do the slow plodding and preliminary labour of the work-to dig and delve and get the ore to the surface; but, that done, thenceforward let the whole work be a common one, otherwise it will never be worthily done.\" Nevertheless they did together produce in 1852 a report on the supreme court procedure. Martin was at this time inspector of schools, and in this capacity he travelled through the North Island. He and Mrs Martin were keenly interested in the education of the Maori, for whom they kept a school and hospital free. In particular they were attached to Ngapora, whose great influence with the Waikato tribes was an important factor in delaying, if it could not prevent, the Waikato war. Throughout his administration of his high office his philo-Maori sympathies brought him under constant criticism. Yet Governor Gore Brown, with whom later he was not always in agreement, testified (17 Sep 1857) that Martin's 'learning, piety, absolute independence of local politics, give him great influence over both Europeans and natives, and he enjoys the universal respect and esteem of all classes of both races.' Indifferent health caused Martin to visit England in 1855. There he discussed with Sir John Patteson a trust deed bill for the Church in New Zealand. He spent some months also in Italy, and returned to New Zealand in Sep 1856.\n\nA year later he resigned his position, receiving a pension of Â£333 a year (increased the following year to Â£500). He received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from Oxford University while in England in 1858. He then returned to New Zealand in the Kingston (reaching Auckland in Dec 1858) and settled quietly at his home at Taurarua, where he devoted himself with a single mind to the interests and education of the Maori and the affairs of the Church of England. Though he never took holy orders he wore clerical costume and participated regularly in church observances. He personally prepared native candidates for the priesthood. At the first General Synod (1857) he rendered valuable service in drafting the constitution and statutes. Martin was made a knight bachelor in 1860. In the next few years he became more deeply involved in controversy over the Taranaki and Waikato wars. He dissented strongly from the policy which led to the Taranaki war, and in a thoughtful pamphlet gave a full and calm statement of the views of the friends of the Maori. When the Government promulgated a warning against too free discussion of native affairs and sent a copy to him, he with great propriety refrained from making his statement public. The Governor invited him (Dec 1860) to accept a seat on a council of advice on native affairs, but he retained his independence. Contending that the people of Wi Kingi te Rangitake (q.v.) were entitled to all the treatment due to subjects of the crown, he pleaded with Britain for justice and with Wi Tamihana te Waharoa against war. It was a land war, he said, begging the Government not to meet the King movement with force (May 1861). With his passionate sympathy for the Maori people Martin felt very keenly the protraction of the struggle. In Nov 1863 he drew up a protest against the confiscations, which Grey sent to the Secretary of State (Jan 1864). Writing with dignity and feeling, he called upon the Government to distinguish between the loyal and the disloyal. Again in 1865 he protested against the new law for the settlement of the confiscated lands. Writing to Chapman (7 Mar 1866) he said: 'We seem to be slowly floundering towards the end of the war. The apparently great advantage of the Colonial over the Queen's forces is to be reduced by three considerations: 1. That the Maoris do not fight as well in a bad cause as in what they regard as a good one-not so well for the follies and crimes of the Hauhaus as in defence of their own soil and their nationality. 2. That the Colonial forces have been aided by large bodies of resolute natives acquainted with the country. 3. That the narratives of their doings have proceeded always from friendly sources and sometimes from themselves. Still there may be a balance after these abatements.' Deeply as he deplored the war against the Maori tribes, Martin's talents were always at the disposal of the Government for constructive purposes. In Jan 1871 he drew up an exhaustive statement of amendments required in native law; he assisted Donald McLean in drafting his native lands act of that year, and he published his Notes on the Best Method of Working of the Native Lands Act. Though modest and gentle in disposition, Martin was endowed with great moral courage; as a judge patient, wise and sagacious.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war he continued his interest in the education of Maori students at St Stephen's College. He was now for the first time really free and able to devote time to his early study of languages. To the classics which he mastered at Cambridge he had added a deep knowledge of Maori and other Pacific tongues. Bishop Patteson venerated him as friend and scholar. In 1874 Martin decided to return to England. They sailed on 14 Apr and took up their residence at Torquay. To the end the vigorous scholarship of Martin flowered in fresh studies, the soundness of which was acknowledged by Max Muller. In 1876-78 he published two volumes on Inquiries Concerning the Structure of the Semitic Languages, and at the time of his death (8 Nov 1880) he was preparing notes on the New Testament. Three days before his death he wrote: 'My civil work is done. My ecclesiastical work is done; and now I leave it in God's hands. I pray for the Church of England. I embrace all Christians in the bonds of Catholic unity.' Lady Martin, who assisted in all the activities of her husband, died on 2 Jan 1884. Her book Our Maoris was published in 1888.\n\nG.B.O.P., 1849/1120; information from Sir F. R. Chapman; N.Z.P.D., pass.\n\nD.N.B.; Annals of Col.

He was educated in the National school there and at a secondary school kept by a classical scholar named Brandon. He was a quick learner and, in addition to the usual classical subjects, studied some political economy. While he was still at school his father sold the farm and emigrated to New Zealand. Not pleased with the prospect at Kaipara, where he had acquired a bush section, he did not settle there, but bought a farm at Tamaki. There he was engaged when William arrived in the City of Auckland on 11 Dec 1870. His fellow passengers included F. W. Isitt and W. J. Williams (q.v.), both later prominent in the Methodist Church and in the national life of New Zealand. Massey worked with his father until reaching the age of 17 and then, to learn more of farming, obtained a position with John Grigg (q.v.) who had been a neighbour at Tamaki. He was employed for more than two years at Longbeach, Canterbury. He then spent a few months with his people at their new farm at Mangere, and at the age of 21 purchased a small threshing machine and leased a farm of 100 acres. In 1882 he married Christina Allen Paul (1863-1932; C.B.E. 1918; Dame Gr. Cross 1926), the daughter of a neighbouring farmer.\n\nMassey soon became a member of the Mangere road board and chairman of the school committee, an office-bearer of the Masonic lodge Manukau, and in 1890 president of the Mangere Farmers Club. This local organisation, which was afterwards replaced by the Farmers' Union, was formed to resume some of the duties and interests previously cared for by the Auckland Agricultural Association (known later as the New Zealand Agricultural and Pastoral Association). A show was held in 1890 under the auspices of the Farmers Club and as a result the old association was resuscitated in 1891, Massey being its first president. He became a member also of the National Association, a conservative political organisation; and of this also he was president for the Auckland district. It was partly due to the suggestion of Sir William Fox that Massey aspired to public life. At the end of 1893 he contested Franklin, which had been represented in Parliament for many years by Major Hamlin. He was defeated by Benjamin Harris by a narrow majority. A few weeks later the Waitemata seat became vacant through the unseating of Richard Monk as the result of a petition. Massey stood and defeated Jason Palmer (q.v.), who had previously held the seat.\n\nLater in the year he accepted the duties of Opposition whip. At the next election (1896) he stood for his own district (Franklin) where he defeated Harris by 474 votes. That seat was held without interruption until his death. An inveterate fighter and a firm freeholder, he entered with zest into the debates on land tenure, condemning out of hand any form of landlordism, whether state or private. In debate after debate the opposition assailed the leasehold policy of the Liberal government, which was the subject of an important commission in 1905.\n\nThe Opposition was without a leader in the sessions of 1900-02, Captain Russell having relinquished the leadership to sit merely as member for Hawkes Bay, while the whip managed the affairs of the Conservative party. At last, in Sep 1903 Massey was elected leader. He galvanised the opposition into life and led it steadily forward to its victory in 1912. Meanwhile it suffered a severe setback at the general election in 1905, at which the public registered its disapproval of personal attacks which had been made on the Prime Minister by members who seemed to have some association with the Conservative party. The death of Seddon robbed the Liberal party of some of the profits of a sweeping victory. Yet Massey was 10 years leader before the swing of popular opinion brought him into office. Throughout this period the freehold principle was the principal divergence between the two parties. At the election of 1911 Sir Joseph Ward failed to carry the country, and when Parliament met (on 15 Feb 1912) the first policy vote resulted in a tie: 39 for and 39 against. The Speaker (Guinness) cast his vote in favour of the party in power, and Parliament adjourned to enable the Prime Minister to decide upon his course of action. A new ministry was formed from the Liberal side of the House under the leadership of T. Mackenzie, who assumed office on 28 Mar and carried on against the protest of the Opposition until the normal time for assembling Parliament. When Parliament did meet Massey at once moved a vote of no-confidence in the ministry and this was carried, on 5 Jul by 41 votes to 33. He was sent for by the Governor, and on 10 Jul his ministry was sworn in, the first from the Conservative side of the House since 1890. Massey in addition to the Premiership assumed the portfolios of Lands, Agriculture and Labour, most of which he held continuously until his death 13 years later. With him were the following ministers: James Allen (Finance and Education), W. H. Herries (Railways and Native Affairs), William Fraser (Public Works, Mines and Industries and Commerce), A. L. Herdman (Attorney General and Minister of Justice), F. H. D. Bell (Internal Affairs and Immigration), R. H. Rhodes (Postmaster-general and Public Health), F. M. Fisher (Customs and Marine) and Maui Pomare (as representative of the Native race).\n\nIn his first session Massey passed an act placing the civil service under the control of a public service commissioner, and another amending the land settlement law in such a way as to give to crown tenants under the renewable lease or lease-in-perpetuity the right to acquire the freehold of their sections. This measure affected 13,175 state tenants and holdings aggregating about three million acres of land. In the realm of industrial relations, which could never for long be ignored, he was impelled by the events of 1912, when a stubborn strike of miners at Waihi was not terminated without violence, to try to devise a new method of adjusting disputes by the formation of proposals for settlement. This did not serve, however, to appease the grievances of labour, and at the opening of his second year of office Massey had to deal with a more formidable disturbance originating in a strike by shipwrights, which extended to the waterside workers at Wellington and eventually to a large body of labour throughout the Dominion. As the export of primary products was jeopardised at the height of the season, special constables were enrolled, and some violent clashes occurred before the dispute was terminated. During this struggle the New Zealand Labour party developed its unity and organisation and emerged as a permanent factor in the political field.\n\nWhatever may have been Massey's intentions in the field of social and economic reform, his administration was destined to be governed by events over which he had no control. Devoutly attached to the Imperial connection, he had espoused without reservation the defence measures of the Liberal government, and appreciated the material which it had prepared for the emergency which arose in the middle of 1914. On naval policy he differed slightly, but only in method. Whereas Ward adhered to the policy of paying a contribution towards the maintenance of the British Navy, with the proviso that a squadron should be maintained in New Zealand waters, Massey adopted the policy of his far-seeing Minister of Defence (Allen), who in conference with the Imperial authorities had recommended that the maritime spirit in New Zealand should be fostered and that co-operation in naval defence could best be achieved by creating a new centre of strength in the form of a New Zealand navy. Nevertheless, when war with Germany became imminent, Massey's Government agreed that H.M.S. New Zealand should be freed from any restrictions and used wherever the Admiralty should consider most advantageous. She accordingly remained in Europe, and was thus able to take her place in the first line of defence in the North Sea.\n\nWhen war broke out Massey made an immediate declaration of New Zealand's loyalty and solidarity with the Empire, and her willingness to do what was required by the Imperial plan of defence. With a single-mindedness and energy comparable with that displayed by Seddon 15 years earlier, and with the knowledge that Parliament and the country were almost unanimously behind him, Massey faced the heavy burden of responsibility involved. Before the end of Aug the German colony of Samoa had been occupied by New Zealand troops (without fighting), and on 16 Oct the Expeditionary Force, which had been made possible by the defence measures of the past six years, sailed for Egypt, to finish training there and participate in the fighting against the Turks in Gallipoli. Though unreserved in his attachment to the British cause, Massey showed no disposition to leave all decisions to the British Government. Before the first Expeditionary Force sailed he threatened the resignation of the cabinet if the Governor accepted the responsibility of dispatching it inadequately convoyed. Throughout the war he frequently protested against the methods adopted both in the operations and in the economic arrangements that were necessary between the two countries. The general election on 10 Dec 1914 was fought under the influence of war, which usually favours the Conservative cause. The outcome was that Massey had a following of 40 in the new Parliament, Ward had 34 and Labour appeared with a compact body of 6 members, whose adherence to the Liberal cause at any moment might place the Government in jeopardy.\n\nConvinced that with such a precarious majority he was no longer justified in taking upon his own party the whole responsibility of administering the government in a time of crisis, Massey made overtures to the other party leaders which resulted in the formation of a National Government to carry New Zealand through the war. On 12 Aug 1915 the new cabinet was sworn in, with Massey as Prime Minister and Minister of Lands and Labour; Allen (in charge of the onerous portfolio of Defence); Herries (Railways and Native Affairs); William Fraser (Public Works) and Bell (Immigration). Ward became Minister of Finance and Postmaster-general, and his followers in the ministry were McNab (Justice and Marine), G. W. Russell (Internal Affairs and Health), A. M. Myers (Customs, Munitions and Supplies), W. D. S. Macdonald (Agriculture and Mines) and J. A. Hanan (Education). On the death of McNab in Feb 1917 T. M. Wilford became Minister of Justice and Marine, and D. H. Guthrie came in in 1918 to relieve Massey of the settlement of returned soldiers on the land. With the ranks thus closed, Parliament proceeded to create a national register (1 Aug 1916). The New Zealand division recovered from the losses it sustained in the unsuccessful operations against the Turks, and was removed to the western front, where it first went into action at Flers on 15 Sep. The first ballot for service under the compulsory act was held on 16 Nov, and thereafter the division was maintained at full strength by conscription. The only opposition to this measure came from the Labour party, whose principles were against compulsion for military service and whose hopes of social reform had been set back by the exigencies of the war. Massey and Ward were deeply engrossed in the multifarious demands of the war, and paid several visits to England to attend meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet. At the War Conference in 1917 the status of the dominions was fully discussed, and it was laid down, in a resolution which Massey seconded, that each dominion was autonomous, and that all were entitled to be consulted before the Imperial Government entered upon any act of foreign policy. Massey was in Europe in 1918, and finally in 1919 to attend the Peace Conference at Versailles, where he affixed his signature and the seal of the Dominion to the treaties of peace and the covenant of the League of Nations, and assured himself that Samoa should not be returned to Germany but should be placed under a mandate and governed by New Zealand. He received the freedom of London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, York, Bristol and Manchester and the honorary degrees of the Universities of Oxford, Edinburgh and Belfast, and was made a freeman of the Company of Clothworkers, London.\n\nBefore he returned to New Zealand it became clear that he and the Liberal leader could not agree on the methods to be adopted in settling the returning soldiers. The gap became more pronounced, and on 21 Aug 1919 Ward and his Liberal colleagues withdrew from the National ministry to fight the general election under their old party colours. Massey reformed the cabinet on 25 Aug, inviting William Nosworthy, J. G. Coates and J. B. Hine to assume the portfolios surrendered by the seceding ministers. The elections, which were held on 17 Dec, returned the Reform party to office, with the largest majority that Massey ever commanded as Prime Minister. The state of parties was: Reform 44; Liberal 18; Labour 8; independent Labour 3; other independents 7. Ward lost his seat, as did also one of Massey's colleagues (Hine).\n\nMassey re-constructed his cabinet, taking in E. P. Lee (as Minister of Justice), C. J. Parr (as Minister of Education and Health), and a little later G. J. Anderson (as Minister of Internal Affairs). His task now was to resettle the country, to demobilise its soldiers, industries and war departments, and to move away, if possible, from the elaborate system of controls and prohibition which had grown up in the war. The attempt to repeal the various moratoria failed. They were even extended to protect other interests as it became obvious that the prosperity of the agricultural classes depended on the disposal of the accumulated stores of meat and wool without causing a slump in prices. Out of these difficulties grew the meat control board (1922) and the dairy export control of the following year. The difficulties of the position increased rather than diminished as the election of 1922 approached, and Massey's health began to show signs of the strain of 10 years of arduous administration and political turmoil. The appeal to the country gave him no grounds for optimism. The state of the House after the polling (on 7 Dec 1922) was as follows: Reform 38; Liberal 21; Labour 17; Independent Labour 1; Independent 3. Faced with the probable co-operation of Labour with the Liberal party (which would make the voting equal) and the possibility of four Independents voting against him, he met his last Parliament in no very hopeful circumstances. Sir James Allen had gone to London as High Commissioner, and the ministry had been strengthened by the appointment of W. Downie Stewart as Minister of Internal Affairs and Customs. In 1923 Massey lost by death two more valued colleagues (Herries and Fraser), and he was still bearing the load of the Treasury and several smaller departments in addition to the Prime Ministership. In 1924 it became evident that far-reaching adjustments would have to be made before the returned soldiers could be considered settled; and labour was becoming more and more restive under the steady increase in the cost of living. Massey's health suffered severely under the prolonged strain, and he died on 10 May 1925.\n\nMassey possessed many of the characteristics of his predecessor Seddon. Hearty, straightforward and genial, he had a faculty for drawing men to him, and he was not lacking in the power of weighing them up. He had most of the traits also of the north of Ireland Protestant, deep religious feeling, robust loyalty, boundless energy and industry and unflinching determination in moving towards a goal, which he generally saw plainly. His Imperialism was full-blooded, asking no questions, but permitting no liberties in the name of duty. He never hesitated to speak his mind in Imperial councils. Through the crisis of the war of 1914-18 he led his country unerringly. From the moment when he assured Britain that 'all we have and all we are are at the disposal of the Imperial Government,' he never questioned the final outcome or the wisdom of throwing all his weight into the issue. As a political leader Massey was very successful with the electorate. He was an astute and capable parliamentarian, but he was unfortunate in that he was only for a short time free of anxiety regarding his parliamentary majority. A farmer himself, he enjoyed the unwavering support of the farming community. Some of his dilemmas could be traced to his dependence upon that support at times when his own judgment pointed in other directions.\n\nTwo of Massey's sons became members of Parliament: WALTER WILLIAM MASSEY (1882-) who was M.P. for Hauraki (1931-35) and JOHN NORMAN MASSEY (1885-) who was M.P. for Franklin (1931-35, 1938-).\n\nN.Z.P.D., pass.

In June 1829 he was appointed assistant-surveyor (roads and bridges) in New South Wales. In Jan 1832 he married his cousin Sarah Louisa Mathew (1805-90), a sister of Keats's friend George Felton Mathew. In 1835 he became town surveyor at Sydney.\n\nIn 1839 Mathew accepted an offer to accompany Captain Hobson as acting Surveyor-general of New Zealand. His diaries and journal letters, and those of his wife, give a very full account of Hobson's proceedings in the early months of 1840, often from a critical and unfriendly angle. After the successful negotiation of the Treaty of Waitangi, his first task was to select a site for the capital. Though Bay of Islands was the main centre of trade and the headquarters of the missionaries, neither Hobson nor Mathew considered it suitable. At the end of Feb Mathew visited the Waitemata with Hobson on the Herald, and the possibilities of the upper portion of the river were favourably noted. Mathew and Captain Symonds were to have been left to survey the isthmus and explore the Manukau and Waikato districts, while the Herald completed her southern tour; but Hobson's sudden illness in Mar necessitated a return to Bay of Islands before any real progress had been made. Despite his incapacity Hobson refused to delegate the task to his subordinates, and the delay thus occasioned rendered it essential to fix on a temporary site for the seat of Government at Bay of Islands. The arrival of the store-ship Westminster (17 Mar), with immigrants and stores, made it a matter of urgency to provide for a settlement. Kororareka was already settled; the available land was subject to conflicting land claims, and there was no room for development. Nevertheless Mathew advised the Governor to take over the place for government purposes and award compensation; but Hobson wisely refused to strain his limited authority by such an act. Busby's (q.v.) township of 'Victoria,' at Waitangi, though otherwise suitable for settlement, had no good anchorage. Mathew ultimately reported that Okiato, where J. R. Clendon (q.v.) had his dwelling and store, was 'the only spot in the Bay of Islands which is at all suitable for settlement, or calculated for the purposes of the Government'; and eventually an agreement was made (22 Mar) to purchase this site for Â£15,000. The Government took possession in May and 'Russell' (as Okiato was re-named in honour of the Secretary of State) remained the seat of government till the removal to Auckland in Mar 1841. The town of Russell, which Mathew surveyed and planned, did not materialise owing to the refusal of Gipps to sanction the purchase. Meanwhile Mathew was despatched in the cutter Ranger (Captain Carkeek) to explore the coast as far south as the Thames for a site for the permanent capital. He visited Whangarei (20-23 Apr), which he reported unsuitable except for a small settlement, and Mahurangi, with which he was more favourably impressed; but he was principally engaged in a thorough examination of the Waitemata and the Thames (27 Apr-30 May). The decision at which he arrived was that the spot previously noted by Hobson (near the present township of Hobsonville) was 'totally unfit for the site of the principal settlement, and indeed ill-adapted for a settlement at all,' having neither fresh water, wood, drainage, stone for roads and buildings, nor deep water near its shore. He recommended that the capital should be built on the Tamaki, near Panmure basin, on the lower slopes of Mt Wellington. The disadvantage of the river bar he considered not insuperable; smaller vessels could come upstream to the capital, while Waitemata (Auckland) might serve as a port for large ships. His judgment in this particular was not good, but he was right in attaching great importance to the isthmus between the Waitemata, Tamaki and Manukau, as 'the connecting link between the northern and southern portions of the Island ... the very key to the whole island, north and south, the centre through which every line of communication must unavoidably pass,' and in easy reach of the Waikato and Thames-Piako valleys, which 'must become the great agricultural district of the island.' Hobson was not convinced. As soon as he recovered, he revisited the Waitemata with Captain D. Rough (Jul), and rejected the Tamaki because of the difficulty of its river bar and channel in favour of the Waitemata shore near Ponsonby and Freeman's bay. In Sep Mathew returned in the barque Hannah Watson, with Symonds and others, to make preparations for the erection of the government buildings. The site was purchased from the Maori without difficulty (16 Sep; confirmed 20 Oct). Mathew chose Commercial bay, at the foot of present Queen street, as the place to erect the government store, and round this nucleus the town of Auckland rapidly took shape.\n\nThe place was surveyed, and a plan of the town drawn by Mathew; the Governor took formal possession of Government House in Mar 1841, and in Apr the first sale of town lots took place.\n\nDuring the remainder of 1841, Mathew made fair progress with the survey, despite inadequate staff and lack of proper instruments. Besides surveying and planning the towns of Russell and Auckland, his department laid out some 250 small farms in the neighbourhood of the capital, and accomplished much preliminary work of exploration in the Manukau and Tamaki districts, at Mahurangi and Kaipara to the north, and at Wairoa and the Thames to the south-east.\n\nMathew had the confidence of both Gipps and Hobson, and it was a surprise to all three to learn, in Nov 1841, that he was to be superseded by C. W. Ligar (appointed Surveyor-general by the Colonial Office). Government's intention in 1839 had been to make no permanent appointments till the results of Hobson's mission were known, Gipps and Hobson being empowered to nominate certain officers from local residents, on the distinct understanding that their appointment was provisional. Apparently Gipps did not make this condition clear; and when, in due course, Mathew's appointment was notified to the Home Government and approved, Gipps, Hobson and Mathew all regarded this as confirmation of a permanent appointment. The Colonial Office took a different view. Pending appeal, Mathew acted as Postmaster-general and chief police magistrate, and when the Colonial Government became financially embarrassed he resigned these posts and further declined the offer of appointment as deputy surveyor-general.\n\nIn Jan 1845, he left New Zealand for England, to make a personal appeal to Lord Stanley. While in London, he provided much useful information to the Colonial Office and parliament on New Zealand. Stanley confirmed his appointment as deputy Postmaster-general and resident police magistrate, but on his return to New Zealand, Governor Grey refused to implement the Colonial Office's arrangements, as he considered the police magistrate should be a military officer. Mathew declined the post office, and, disappointed and broken in health, left Auckland for England in the Thomas King. He intended to travel via Panama, and died at Lima, Peru, on 26 Nov 1847.\n\nFamily information from Mrs Hilda McCleary; Felton Mathew MSS.; P.R.O. London, series C.O. 209; N.Z.

As a child he came to New Zealand with his father, and he received most of his education at Hokianga. In 1853 he left for Melbourne to try his fortune on the goldfields, but two years later returned to New Zealand and received an appointment in the civil service, being stationed in Hawkes Bay and later at Coromandel. With his brother William he took up a sheep run in Southern Hawkes Bay. He was a capable Maori linguist and on the outbreak of the Maori war joined the Defence Force (Aug 1863) and served as a sub-inspector under Colonel Nixon in Auckland province. He was present at the actions at Mauku, Drury, Queen's Redoubt and Burt's Farm. In company with von Tempsky, he reconnoitred the enemy position at Paparata, narrowly escaping capture. For this he received the thanks of General Cameron. He took part in the Thames expedition under Colonel Carey. In the attack on Rangiaowhia (2 Feb 1864) he approached the large house with Mair and summoned the occupants to surrender. The reply was a heavy volley, in which Colonel Nixon was mortally wounded. McDonnell assisted him out of danger. Promoted captain, he was second in command of the Maori contingent in the fighting at Maketu and was slightly wounded in skirmishes. He was appointed magistrate at Cambridge, but had only been there a few months when his services were again required in the field. Promoted brevet-major (Jul 1865) and given command of the Whanganui contingent in the operations on the West Coast, he took an active part in the first assault at Weraroa (21 Jul) and then proceeded with the relief force to Pipiriki (19-30 Jul). Summoned away by the murder of Volkner, McDonnell served under Brassey in Bay of Plenty, being present at the actions of Kiorekino and Te Tarata (3 and 4 Oct). He pursued Kereopa and his people up the Waimana valley, taking their pa at Te Puia and defeating them in the Waimana gorge. He was soon recalled to the West Coast to serve as advance guide to General Chute's column. There he was in action at Moturoa, Te Putahi (7 Jan 1866), Ketemarae and Keteonetea; and was again wounded.\n\nThe Government having decided to occupy the confiscated lands in Taranaki, McDonnell was given command of the protecting force and established his camp at Manawapou. His negotiations with the Ngati-Ruanui and the Tangahe were unsuccessful. After being several times ambushed, he retaliated by attacking the Hauhau position at Pokaikai. For this he was criticised, inasmuch as he had accepted a token of peace some days earlier. There were further stubborn engagements at Pungarehu and Ketemarae. In Apr McDonnell was promoted lieut-colonel and given command of the native contingent operating against the Hauhau in the Rotorua district, Henry Tacy Clarke being attached to his force. From this duty he was recalled to Patea to command a force of 100 men detailed to quell the Fenian disturbances in Hokitika. The situation in Taranaki was far from satisfactory. In May 1868 Booth issued warrants for the arrest of two principal fighting chiefs of Titokowaru, and requested McDonnell to execute them. By diplomacy he secured the return of some of the settlers' horses, but it soon became clear that hostilities were imminent.\n\nA message was sent to Wanganui recalling McDonnell, who hurried to Wellington for authority to raise a force of 400 men, of whom 100 should be natives. With the rank of inspector in the Armed Constabulary (Jul 1868), he hastened back to Taranaki to find that there had been a serious reverse at Turuturumokai (12 Jul). Placing Roberts in charge of that post, he made his plans for retaliation against Titokowaru's stronghold at Te Ngutu-o-te Manu. On 2 Aug, in thick fog, he approached the position with a force of 350 men, himself leading the frontal attack while von Tempsky attacked on the left. The defenders fled into the bush from which, after the whares had been burned, they maintained a harassing fire on the retreating force. McDonnell brilliantly extricated his men, the rearguard being commanded by Major Hunter. Both sides suffered some losses. On 7 Sep McDonnell again marched out from Waihi with 360 men, including 100 natives. The divisions were commanded by von Tempsky and Hunter, the natives being under Captain William McDonnell and Keepa te Rangihiwinui (q.v.). Striking into the forest for the position of Rua-ruru, McDonnell passed Te Ngutu unwittingly, and only learned of it from Keepa when the two European divisions had begun their assault. Believing that the position was strongly held, he could not make up his mind to push the attack. In these moments of indecision there were severe losses, the raw troops showing signs of panic. Both von Tempsky and Hunter wished to attack, but McDonnell ordered a retreat to the Waingongoro under Hunter's protection. Von Tempsky and Captain George Buck having been killed and many casualties sustained, Roberts collected the survivors and led them out of the bush. The force returned to Waihi somewhat demoralised, and McDonnell resigned his command, being succeeded by Whitmore, under whom he served. In the following operations he fell into an ambush and was again wounded. He was present at Tauranga-ika and Karaka flats (Feb 1869), and then resigned from the force. A few months later (Jul 1869) he was again called upon to operate against Te Kooti, a service for which he had every qualification. By the middle of Sep he had concentrated a mixed body of the Colonial Defence Force and native allies in the camp at Tokaanu. Te Kooti took up a position on the Ponanga saddle, between Taupo and Rotoaira. McDonnell moved out and established his field headquarters at Poutu, where he threw up earthworks. On 25 Sep the Maori contingent gallantly attacked Te Kooti's force, which was strongly entrenched, and threw them off the hill with great loss. The blow to Te Kooti's mana destroyed all hope of receiving help from the King tribes, and he withdrew to make a last stand in the fortified knolls and redoubt at Porere, on the banks of the Upper Whanganui river. Here McDonnell surrounded and attacked him (3 Oct 1869), storming the position and driving the survivors into thick bush to the westward. A few days later Te Heuheu Horonuku (q.v.) surrendered. McDonnell, having received native reinforcements under Topia Turoa and Keepa, then pursued the enemy, whom he drove out of Tapapa pa (24 Jan 1870) and defeated in a counter attack on the following day, seizing all his horses. He remained in the field some time longer, and then retired with a fine record of service, having been four times wounded, many times mentioned, and thanked by various governors and generals. It was not until 1886 that he was awarded the New Zealand Cross.\n\nIn 1884 McDonnell contested the Waitotara seat against Bryce. Grace says that he was a soldier of outstanding courage and intrepidity. Whitmore says that he was more sinned against than sinning; the Government repeatedly gave him the shadow of authority, but constantly interfered in his operations, so that Te Kooti was permitted to regain the sanctuary of the mountainous Urewera country. McDonnell married first (1866) Rose von Dardebyyn (d. 1869), and second (1870) Henrietta Elise, daughter of Thomas E. Lomax, of London. He died at Wanganui on 8 Nov 1899. His memoirs, upon which he spent much time, have not been published.\n\nCowan, Wars (p); Gudgeon (p); Grace; Whitmore.\n\nReference: Volume 2, page 8\n\nðŸŒ³ Further sources\n\nDonald McLean\n\nMcLEAN, SIR DONALD (1820-77) was born at Kilmaluaig, Tyree, Argyllshire, the son of John McLean and his wife Margaret, daughter of the Rev D. McColl. His father having died when he was a child, Donald received a sound Scots education in the parish under the care of his mother's people. In 1838 he sailed from Oban in the St George for Sydney, to the care of an uncle. He entered a merchant's office, but soon left and worked on a station near Bathurst.\n\nEarly in 1840 he came to New Zealand as agent for the timber firm of Abercrombie and Co., to wind up some business. That done, he was some time engaged as a labourer splitting logs on the beach at Waiheke and Coromandel; as a seaman on a small coaster, and in charge of a schooner running stores up the Thames river. In this occupation he mixed much with the natives, learned their language and became imbued with a deep sympathy for people whose tribal organisation resembled so closely that of the Scottish Highlands. His steady energy and knowledge of the Maori character struck A. Sinclair (q.v.), who brought him to the notice of Captain Hobson, and he became a clerk in the office of the protector of aborigines, and subsequently also interpreter. In 1844 he was appointed protector for the western district (Mokau to Wanganui, including Taupo), with a salary of Â£400 a year as crown lands commissioner.\n\nMcLean had considerable success in his dealings with native chiefs, and was soon regarded with official confidence as a man who could soothe their susceptibilities and treat them with a proper degree of consideration and firmness. After Commissioner Spain had made his award in the New Zealand Company's favour for 60,000 acres of land in Taranaki, McLean was ordered to inspect the territory and consult with the natives. He travelled southward in company with Whiteley from Kawhia and made a full report. FitzRoy decided not to confirm the award, and so the matter rested. Soon after the arrival of Sir George Grey as Governor the protectorate was abolished, and McLean was appointed police magistrate at Taranaki, with a small but efficient force of police with which he succeeded admirably in maintaining order at native gatherings and in all settlements where natives congregated (1846). In Mar 1847 he was instructed to inspect the land which had been awarded to the Government in north Taranaki and to acquire the area necessary for settlement purposes. He was entrusted with the responsibility of altering the Company's survey lines where he thought fit, and a few weeks later was authorised to purchase the Grey block. Correspondence in 1849 shows that he had purchased land at Fitzroy, Tataraimaka, Omata, Grey and Puketapu, but not without meeting with much sporadic opposition.\n\nIn 1850 McLean was appointed a native land purchase commissioner and resident magistrate, and in the following year a commissioner under the land claims ordinance. In 1853, with the approval of Grey, he organised a native land-purchase department, with himself as chief commissioner and a purchasing officer in each district. He made a large purchase of land in Auckland province in 1854, and arranged for the purchase of more than 12,000 acres adjacent to the settlements in Taranaki. He remarked, nevertheless, a growing opposition by the natives to the sale of any land at all 'in fear that they should thereby lose their distinctive national character and standing and be reduced to a state of slavery and indigence.' To meet this, and in preference to setting aside reserves which would pick the eyes out of the block, he agreed that natives should be allowed to purchase back from the Government a certain amount of the land bought. He proposed that they should be encouraged to take an interest in the institutions of the country, to qualify to take part in them, and gradually to introduce a new mode of life. The experiment was rather disappointing, but McLean's mana with the natives steadily increased, and during the excitement after the death of Rawiri Waiaua he succeeded, with the help of Whiteley and Turton, in preventing an open breach of the peace. In 1855, owing to the disturbed state of the province, McLean advised the building of blockhouses and the calling out of the militia. On 4 Nov 1856 he was chosen as land purchase officer and native secretary. The Governor (Gore Browne) was still to exercise full responsibility for native affairs, with the final decision on any action to be taken, but the opinion of a responsible minister had to be registered with that of the Native Secretary.\n\nMcLean had the required physical and moral qualities for the post, a commanding presence and dignity of behaviour, an excellent knowledge of the Maori language and customs, and a genuine sympathy for the race. To them he always appeared as one who shielded them from the evil intentions of the Colonial Government.\n\nHe accompanied Gore-Browne on his visit to Taranaki when he agreed to purchase Teira's land at Waitara. Unfortunately ill-health kept him away from the province during succeeding months, and historians are not disposed to hold him responsible for the outbreak of the Taranaki war. He was again in Taranaki when the truce was concluded with Hapurona (Mar 1861), the Native Minister (Weld) being also present.\n\nBy an unfortunate clash of policy between the Governor and the Government, Fenton was appointed to introduce certain reforms in the Waikato, independent of the authority of the Native Secretary. It was an impossible position where two men of strong personality were concerned, though both were sincerely anxious for the welfare of the Maori. It was equally unfortunate that the two departments of Native Affairs and Land Purchase should be combined in McLean's person, thus giving to the pronative faction in the country, and to many of the natives themselves, the impression that the acquisition of land was the real object of the Government. In May 1861 McLean resigned the native secretaryship owing to the attitude of the Government in respect to Fenton's appointment.\n\nAbout this time he purchased the Maraekakaho property, and in 1863 he settled down in Hawkes Bay and began to take part in the affairs of the new province. Elected to the Provincial Council for Napier, he at once became Superintendent (26 Feb 1863), and held that position unchallenged until the affairs of the Colony demanded his full attention. In his dealings with his fellow settlers he showed the same inexhaustible patience and penetration which he exhibited in native affairs. He sat in with his Council, stood for re-election on being chosen as Superintendent, and on the whole managed provincial affairs in Hawkes Bay with more smoothness and decorum than obtained in any other province. He resigned the emoluments of the land purchase officer in 1863, but retained the appointment nominally until the office was abolished (1865). Grey in Jun 1863 appointed McLean as his deputy to call out the militia. They were summoned for training without delay and in the next few years were several times on active service. During most of the sixties McLean acted as the agent of the General Government, a position in which he wielded great authority during the Hauhau rising and the campaign on the east coast. Meanwhile, in 1866 he had been elected to Parliament for Napier. His mana with both races was very high and he was listened to with great deference in the native debates which dominated Parliament in the sixties. He was an outspoken critic of government policy towards the Maori and in 1868, when fighting was going on in several provinces, he relinquished the post of Government Agent and joined Fox in opposition to the war policy of Stafford. Their motion expressing alarm at the course of events was lost on the casting vote of the Speaker. In 1869 Fox moved a direct want-of-confidence motion, which McLean seconded, and the Government was defeated by a majority of 1. Stafford, who had wished McLean to take office under him when he resigned the Native secretaryship, now resigned (28 Jun) and Fox became Premier, with McLean as Native Secretary and Defence Minister. Te Kooti having already been defeated south of Taupo, the new Government was able with a good prospect of success to withdraw the expeditions from the field and adopt a policy of pacification by the active prosecution of roads and bridges, coach services from Wanganui to New Plymouth and the opening up of native lands. On taking office with Fox, McLean resigned the superintendency of Hawkes Bay (1869), and at the subsequent dissolution he withdrew from the Provincial Council (1871). He was Minister of Native Affairs for the rest of his life, holding office continuously under Fox, Waterhouse, Pollen, Vogel and Atkinson, and only resigning (on 7 Dec 1876) when his health made it impossible to carry on longer. He carried several important measures affecting the Maori and their lands, and lived to see land again being offered for sale. He made his peace with the King natives in 1875 and met Wi Kingi te Rangitake in amity at New Plymouth. He died on 5 Jan 1877.\n\nMcLean was created K.C.M.G. in 1874. He married (1851) Susan Douglas (d. Nov 1852), daughter of R. R. Strang (Wellington). (See R. D. D. MACLEAN, R. HART, R. R.

After receiving his primary education in the parish school, he went to Aberdeen University, where he had a brilliant career and graduated in arts. During vacations he earned some money by teaching parish schools in Ross and Sutherland. Having decided to study theology, he went to Edinburgh University. There he was awarded the gold medal for moral philosophy. Throughout his course of three years at Divinity Hall he evinced great independence of thought, commented openly on the conduct and characters of his professors, and was critical of the tone of the Established Church of Scotland. In his last term he was rusticated for an offence against discipline. Returning to his native parish (1806), McLeod commenced to preach without being licensed or associated with the Established Church. The congregation disapproved of the regular minister of the parish, and McLeod soon had a strong body of church members attending his ministry. In 1815 he opened the parish school at Ullapool, in the parish of Lochbroom, receiving his salary from the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. But he was soon in conflict with the minister of the parish, and his salary was reduced by half. Denied a living in this way, he turned to the fisheries, spent two years in charge of a herring boat sailing out of Wick, and then returned to his old occupation as crofter and fisherman in Stoer.\n\nMcLeod had definitely cut himself off from the Established Church, and was attracted by various schools of thought. Finally after long consideration he accepted Calvinism. He had married Mary McLeod, a friend of his youth, and they had one or two children. Seeing no prospect of earning a livelihood in the ministry in Scotland, McLeod in 1817 joined a large party of 400 who sailed from Sutherlandshire in the Frances Ann (14 Jul) to settle in Pictou, Nova Scotia. He held family prayer for the emigrants every day, and when they reached their destination was their accepted minister, in spite of the fact that he had not been licensed or ordained by any church. He settled in Middle River, between Alma and Gairloch, not far from Pictou. As soon as he had built his own shack he commenced to preach in it, and held services also at small settlements in the neighbourhood. Two years later his family joined him in Nova Scotia. Invitations having been received from a Highland colony in Ohio, the Pictou group in 1819 laid the keel of a ship of 200 tons, the Ark, in which the whole colony embarked with the intention of sailing up the Mississippi river to their new home. Encountering a heavy storm in the bay of Canso, they eventually returned to Cape Breton Island and settled at St Ann's Bay. The ship was shortly afterwards lost at sea. The new settlement built itself a model boat for coastal trading, a school, and the first Presbyterian church established in the island, and enjoyed solid prosperity during the next few years.\n\nIn 1825 McLeod spent a year in New York engaged in mission work while he prepared for ordination, and on 29 Aug 1826 he was duly ordained by the presbytery of Genesee. He returned to St Ann's in his old position of preacher, teacher and law-giver, and was appointed government schoolmaster and justice of the peace. All breaches of civil and moral law were tried by him. He established temperance societies and a branch of the British and Foreign Bible Society (1840). In 1846 a large church was opened capable of seating 1,500 people. McLeod's independent views now involved him in a troublesome feud which culminated in litigation, the circumstances in which he was rusticated being alleged against his ecclesiastical character. His supporters were mulct in heavy damages, and a serious defection in the congregation followed. To provide employment for the young men McLeod proposed trading, and a ship of 300 tons was laid down. In this his son Donald sailed to Glasgow with a full cargo of produce but, failing to find a market, was forced to sell the ship, and went farther afield to seek his fortune. In 1847 McLeod received a letter from him in Australia advising the St Ann's colony to move to South Australia. The potato blight which affected their crops this year clinched the matter, and McLeod directed the building of ships for the new migration. Duncan and Murdoch McKenzie, two skilled seamen, together with John Fraser and John McKay, took the lead in organising the migration. In 1851 the Highland Lass and Margaret, each of 300 tons, were launched. Three hundred of the settlers decided to embark, but the Highland Lass was frozen in and they all had to sail in the sister ship (Oct 1851). Calling at Cape Town, a party made a reconnaissance of land for settlement and negotiated with the government. Arriving in Apr 1852 at Adelaide, they found that Donald had gone on to Melbourne. There again inquiries were made for land, and then the Margaret sailed for Melbourne. Donald was not there either, so the Margaret was sold to pay expenses, and the young men took work or went to the goldfields, while a party went up country to prospect for land, and afterwards (in the schooner Gazelle) to Bay of Islands. They negotiated with the New Zealand government for a block of land in the north. Meanwhile the rest of the settlement embarked from St Ann's in the Highland Lass. The negotiations for a block of land were finally concluded in 1856, when 47,600 acres was declared a special settlement. In the following year Mrs McLeod died. The Ellen Lewis brought the main body across from Australia in 1860. The leader himself died on 14 Mar 1866.\n\nMcLeod was essentially a nonconformist. Rebelling against the loose discipline and the personal character of many of the ministers of the Established Church, he declined to affiliate himself with it, and in effect established a free church of his own before the disruption of 1843. His religious views were extremely strict. During the whole time he was in Nova Scotia he never administered the sacrament, and he rarely administered baptism, on the ground that few men attained the pitch of holiness that such a service demanded. Nor did he even seek ordination until many years after he first undertook to minister to the spiritual needs of his people. And to the end of his life he never regularly joined the Presbyterian Church. Yet his people followed him unquestioningly, putting implicit faith in the nobility of his character; and the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand recorded his death as that of a high-minded divine of their faith. His book, published in 1843, is a unique, if involved, confession of his faith.\n\nGordon; Macdonald (p); Dickson (p); N. R. McKenzie (p); N.

His father belonged to a branch of the clan Menzies and his mother was a Robertson of Struan. Menzies displayed with pride an ornamented rapier said to have been given by Prince Charles to a cadet of the house of Robertson. He was educated in Rannoch, and studied at Edinburgh University, where he entered at the age of 14. He took his diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, at the age of 19.
