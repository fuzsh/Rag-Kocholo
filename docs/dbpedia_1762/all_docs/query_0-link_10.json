        "text": "As the son of a long-time professional party organiser and a lifetime supporter until three years ago, it made me seriously sad to watch the demolition of the National Party on Saturday. Not that I hadn't seen it coming, for the pernicious rot that has attacked this once fine and formidable political institution has been eating away at it now for more than a decade.\n\nYou can't entirely blame Michelle Boag. She was merely the straw that finally broke this particular camel's back, her election to the presidency just the latest of a long series of serious miscalculations on the part of the party's latter-day leadership.\n\nMind you, her blundering up to and during the election campaign is certainly enough to have her fired, and that had better be done quickly because the party has no chance of even beginning to rebuild itself until she is gone.\n\nIt probably isn't in her to resign; she's not that sort of person. Self-interest will always take precedence over any other, as she has shown time and again in her public life.\n\nI grew up in the National Party from the age of 4 when my dad became secretary-organiser for the three Southland electorates, based in Invercargill. I remember the only time I ever saw my father slightly the worse for drink was on the night National won the Treasury benches in 1949.\n\nI fear that the men who visited our home in the 1950s and 60s and who helped to shape my political thinking - Sid Holland, Keith Holyoake, Tom McDonald, Ralph Hanan, Jack Marshall and many of their ministerial colleagues - will be spinning in their graves.\n\nThe tradition of free-enterprise capitalism with a human face that they created has been sadly betrayed. The almost invincible political machine they assembled and kept running smoothly and powerfully has been run to a standstill.\n\nI reckon the rot began to set in when Jim Bolger became Prime Minister in 1990 and appointed Ruth Richardson as Minister of Finance in the first National administration after the Lange-Douglas years.\n\nFrom that time on the party pursued, apparently unthinkingly, an economic policy of free-market, laissez faire capitalism, without any human face, and persisted with it long after such ideology had lost any credibility it might have had.\n\nRuthanasia was, in fact, the first injection in the euthanasing of the National Party.\n\nWeak leadership, too, played its part - Bolger and then Jenny Shipley either unwilling or unable to put the stoppers on the men and women in their cabinets, Bill Birch in particular, who continued to help the rich to get richer, made the poor poorer and more numerous, and condemned the majority - all of us in the middle, many of us National supporters - to decreasing wages, increasing costs and a hefty drop in disposable income.\n\nIt was inevitable that the electorate became more and more disenchanted, then angry, as the senior politicians in the National Government - by then apparently deaf, blind and so out of touch in their ivory-tower arrogance that they had no idea of the mood of the people - fiddled on regardless.\n\nIt was bad - so bad in fact that in 1999 I voted Labour for the first time in my life and could feel the heat of my father's glowing ashes radiating from the cemetery in Christchurch. And I wasn't the only one.\n\nThe terminally ill National Party got just what it deserved. Then Shipley hung on as leader, which made matters worse.\n\nUnderskilled and ineffective as Prime Minister, she was even more incompetent as Leader of the Opposition. And by the time the party saw sense and dumped her, Bill English couldn't even start to put Humpty Dumpty together again before he was hit with an early election campaign.\n\nThen desperation dealt the National Party the death blow: It elected Michelle Boag as its president. If anything shows how out of touch the party had become, that would have to be it.\n\nBoag represented everything about National that its traditional supporters had come to loathe. The noxious reek of the days of the Winebox inquiry - when the ethics of big business were put under the microscope and the microscope wasn't powerful enough to find any - settled over the party afresh.\n\nThen, to add insult to injury, came the machinations that brought Don Brash to a top place on the party list - a man long associated with the worst excesses of the free trading, globalising, piratical capitalism that had turned tens of thousands of National supporters off.\n\nAnd to finish the job, the destroyer engineered the dumping or demotion of men and women who had served the party well and faithfully, some over many years. Kiwis, with their innate sense of fairness, won't stand for that - and they showed it by giving their party vote to Labour even in blue-tinted electorates.\n\nFortunately, there is hope for the bruised and battered and barely breathing National Party. Bill English strikes me as a man in the mould of some of his more famous predecessors, who is capable of dragging the party back to its traditional roots.\n\nI hope he is, for I sense the party's knights of old - Holland, Holyoake, Marshall, Rob Muldoon - and others cheering him on from wherever they are.\n\n* garth_george@nzherald.co.nz"
