MY GOAL IS ALWAYS TO SERVE THE SONG WITH LIVE DRUMS & PERCUSSION. IT’S NOT ABOUT FLASHY PERFORMANCES. ITS ALL ABOUT HELPING THE SONG COME ALIVE AND REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL.\n\nSTEP 1:\n\nSEND ME A STEREO MIX WITHOUT DRUMS ALONG WITH THE BPM. GIVE ME SOME DIRECTION ON WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND FOR THE TRACK AND IDEALLY PROVIDE REFERENCES FOR SOUND, VIBE AND FEEL. LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY PARTICULAR ELEMENTS OR ACCENTS THAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nI WILL BEGIN TO CRAFT CUSTOMIZED SOUNDS AND PARTS CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUR YOUR UNIQUE STYLE AND AESTHETIC.\n\nSTEP 3:\n\nI'LL SEND YOU AN MP3 OF YOUR SONG WITH MY DRUM TAKE AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANY CHANGES YOU MAY WANT. IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES NEEDED, YOU CAN LET ME KNOW WITHIN 48 HOURS OF MY FILES BEING SENT AND I’LL RE-DO WHATEVER’S NECESSARY UNTIL YOU LOVE IT.\n\nSTEP 4:\n\nONCE YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE, I’LL SEND YOU THE INDIVIDUAL WAV FILES TO DROP INTO YOUR DAW!\n\nGet in touch!"
