        "meta_description": "On Tuesday the 14th of May, we had a member's night, and a presentation from one of our members, Ralph Hanan    Ralph recounts his diverse educational and early professional experiences, which significantly shaped his career. After completing his Bachelor of Agricultural Science in New Zealand, he sought further opportunities abroad and received a scholarship to study in Germany, despite not knowing the language. He quickly adapted, learning German, and spent time working on a building site near Frankfurt, which exposed him to different cultures and broadened his worldview.   Ralph decided to continue his studies in Germany at Göttingen University, focusing on agricultural marketing. He navigated the challenges of studying in a foreign language and earned a degree equivalent to a Master’s. His thesis on the European Economic Community and Third World countries, including New Zealand, marked a significant academic achievement. Encouraged by a friend, Ralph aspired to study in the United States, inspired by his mother's experiences at Stanford. He applied to the University of California at Davis, known for its strong agricultural programs. Upon receiving a research fellowship, he returned to New Zealand briefly before moving to California, where he completed a PhD in agricultural economics.   A notable turning point occurred when a former acquaintance from Göttingen, now with the World Bank, recognised Ralph's father’s name during a visit to New Zealand. This connection led to Ralph to join the World Bank’s Young Professionals program, a prestigious opportunity with thousands of applicants.    Ralph discussed the economic challenges in New Zealand and the need for a shift in focus to improve economic performance. He emphasised that economic performance directly impacts people's wages and overall well-being, citing the example of nurses leaving for Australia due to better opportunities. He concludes by urging a refocus on economic strategies to enhance New Zealand's prosperity.",
