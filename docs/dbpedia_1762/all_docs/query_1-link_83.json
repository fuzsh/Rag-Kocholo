Like most new world settlers, the Irish initially settled on the eastern shores of the continent but began to move westward with the promise of owning land. The height of this Irish migration came during the Great Potato Famine of the late 1840s. With apparently nothing to lose, Irish people left on ships bound for North America and Australia. Unfortunately a great many of these passengers lost their lives - the only thing many had left - to disease, starvation, and accidents during the long and dangerous journey. Those who did safely arrive in \"the land of opportunities\" were often used for the hard labor of building railroads, coal mines, bridges, and canals. The Irish were critical to the quick development of the infrastructure of the United States and Canada. Passenger and immigration lists indicate that members of the Hanan family came to North America quite early:\n\nHanan Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nRobert Hanan, who arrived in Virginia in 1713 1\n\nTeague Hanan, who landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1745 1\n\nHanan migration to Australia +\n\nEmigration to Australia followed the First Fleets of convicts, tradespeople and early settlers.
