        "text": "Among the first questions prospective polar travelers consider “Can you visit Antarctica?” Yes, you can visit Antarctica, being mindful of any Antarctica travel restrictions. We’ll show you how.\n\nThe next question is “How to get to Antarctica?” The answer is not as difficult as it seems. The best way to get to Antarctica is via Antarctica cruises from Argentina, Australia and New Zealand or Antarctica flights from Chile.\n\nIN THIS POST – How to Get to Antarctica:\n\nCan You go to Antarctica?\n\n10 Reasons to Visit Antarctica\n\nGet to Antarctica by Ship\n\nFlights to Antarctica\n\nGet to Antarctica From Your Home\n\nPassport & Visa Requirements\n\nThe Best Way to Get to Antarctica\n\nMore Resources\n\nCan You Go To Antarctica?\n\nYes, you can visit Antarctica. In fact, Antarctica has never been more accessible to travelers.\n\nDo you need permission to go to Antarctica? Travelers do not need permission to go to Antarctica, but tourism operators must hold a valid permit. First, a bit of background on why it is legal to visit Antarctica.\n\nAntarctica is not a country. The continent is protected by the Antarctic Treaty, which preserves it for peaceful and scientific use. The treaty and related agreements ensure that all human activity is carefully managed and planned, including environmentally sensitive tourism. As of 2023 the treaty has 56 signatory parties.\n\nTourism operators in Antarctica submit stringent permit applications annually. If their planned activities meet all criteria, they are authorized and granted a permit. Traveling with an authorized operator means your permit has been secured for you.\n\nDo you need a visa to visit Antarctica? Because no country owns Antarctica, a visa is not required to travel there.\n\nHow many tourists visit Antarctica each year? During the 2022-2023 season, more than 32,000 travelers visited Antarctica. Will you be next?\n\nHow to Get to Antarctica\n\nThe two primary routes travelers use to get to Antarctica are cruising to Antarctica or flying to Antarctica. Below we present everything you need to know about each method.\n\nWondering why people want to visit Antarctica. View our top 10 reasons to visit Antarctica now.\n\nGet to Antarctica by Ship\n\nThe most common and most affordable way to get to Antarctica is to book an Antarctica cruise. Over 90% of all visitors travel to Antarctica aboard a small ship. Learn more about the cost to go to Antarctica.\n\nSpecially outfitted operators run a fleet of purpose-built Antarctica expedition ships taking travelers to Antarctica. They take care of all the logistics from permits to schedules and itineraries. Shore landings and activities on the continent are an important part of the experience. See our tips on how to choose an Antarctic cruise.\n\nCruise to Antarctica From South America\n\nThe distance from the tip of South America to Antarctica is about 600 miles. The countries closest to Antarctica are Argentina and Chile. Most of the travel to Antarctica occurs from these countries in South America. Most cruises begin in Ushuaia, Argentina but some start in other port towns in Argentina and Chile.\n\nCruises to Antarctica range from 10-24 Days. Antarctica cruises from South America are popular because they access the most popular regions including the Antarctic Peninsula, South Georgia Island and the Falkland Islands.\n\nUshuaia to Antarctica Cruises\n\nUshuaia to Antarctica is the most popular cruise route. Ushuaia is 680 miles to Antarctica and the closest port making it the primary hub for cruises.\n\nUshuaia is the southernmost city in South America before Antarctica. It is in the Terra del Fuego province of Argentina and is generally recognized as the southernmost city in the world. Ushuaia is well worth a visit. We recommend travelers going to Antarctica arrive a day or two early.\n\nUshuaia Antarctica cruises offer the largest variety of itinerary and ship options. The shortest and most affordable Ushuaia cruises visit the Antarctic Peninsula. Some cruises from Ushuaia strive to reach farther south the Antarctic circle. More comprehensive Antarctica cruises from Ushuaia include South Georgia and the Falkland Islands.\n\nDuring the height of the season the port of Ushuaia can host 3-5 Antarctica expedition ships each day. Overall, there may be more than three dozen ships visiting Antarctica from Ushuaia each season. Don’t worry the ships coordinate schedules so ports and landing sites do not become overcrowded. This diverse fleet offers travelers the widest choice of ships, cabins and availability.\n\nOther Argentina to Antarctica Cruises\n\nWhile most cruises begin in Ushuaia there are other routes from Argentina to Antarctica. Each year a handful of Argentina Antarctica cruises embark from Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands. To reach Port Stanley travelers must fly from mainland Argentina, usually Buenos Aires.\n\nChile to Antarctica Cruises\n\nChile is known for its cruises with flights to Antarctica. But there are some cruises from Chile to Antarctica each year. Chile Antarctica cruises typically embark in the southern Patagonia city of Punta Arenas.\n\nA Chile to Antarctic voyage will travel through the Chilean Fjords passing by Cape Horn before venturing into the Drake Passage. If you choose a Chilean Antarctic trip it is also possible to combine it with travel to Patagonia or a Chile vacation.\n\nCruises From Australia and New Zealand to Antarctica\n\nEach year a handful of specialty cruises voyage from New Zealand and Australia to Antarctica. These are true expeditions and take longer than cruises from South America. Just crossing from New Zealand or Australia to Antarctica can take five days or more.
