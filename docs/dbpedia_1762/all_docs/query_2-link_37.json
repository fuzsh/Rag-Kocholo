Filming location for cult classics\n\nNew Zealand is one of the most common international filming sites due to its pristine scenery and open locations.

The remake for Goodbye Pork Pie titled Pork Pie was filmed in Invercargill in 2017. One condition of the filming was that the famous yellow Mini Cooper used in the movie would stay in the city; you can currently see it on display at the Pork Pie exhibit at Bill Richardson Transport World.\n\n3. Unique Guidelines around Alcohol\n\nIf you go to a dairy or supermarket in Invercargill, you might notice the lack of alcohol on the shelves. This is due to the Invercargill Licensing Trust (ILT) and unique guidelines around alcohol. The ILT supplies all alcohol within the city and it can only be sold at licensed establishments. In return, the ILT funds many city projects including schools, supports, and city development, and also gives money back to the community.\n\nThe ILT donates hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars every year. But if you’re scratching your head wondering where to buy drinks, you can get them at bars and taverns, or at Liquorland or Superliquor.\n\n4. Home of the Burt Munro Challenge\n\nPerhaps the largest annual event in Southland is the Burt Munro Challenge. The Burt Munro Challenge is a once-a-year event where riders from across the country take part in a series of races and challenges featuring motorbikes. Historically, the festival has happened in Late Spring or summertime, and the town is filled with visitors and the sound of motorbikes throughout the day.\n\nAlong with the racers, spectators local and abroad stop into town to watch the races and enjoy the festivities. There is food, merchandise, and camping as spectators cheer on their favourite to win races and the coveted Competitor of the Year award. Accommodation can fill up several months in advance, so make sure to book early if you want to be reserve your spot for the event!\n\n5. The cloudiest city in New Zealand\n\nInvercargill is extreme by many metrics. It’s the southernmost city in New Zealand as well as one of the coolest. It’s also the 2nd windiest city behind Wellington.\n\nAnother extreme for Invercargill is that it’s the cloudiest city in the country. On average, it gets 1690 hours of sun hours per year–which equates to sunshine about 20% of the time. While it’s the cloudiest, it isn’t the rainiest, but you’ll find clouds more often than not when you glance up at the sky."
