        "text": "The definitive life story of New Zealand Prime Minister Kiwi” Keith Holyoake is revealed in this deftly composed exploration of how one man was able to weather complex changes in society to stay in power for more than 11 years. Through his leadership in the 1960s to his position as Governor General in the late 1970s, Holyoake was often derided as pompous and unprincipled, but this biography demonstrates the astute understanding of people and political issues that allowed him to defuse division and preserve order while encouraging gradual and incremental progress. Holyoake’s performance as Minister of Foreign Affairs is also examined, including his opposition to nuclear testing and his reluctant commitment to assisting the United States in Vietnam."
