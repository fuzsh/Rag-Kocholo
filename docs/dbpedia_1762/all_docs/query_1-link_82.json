        "text": "Almost one thousand people packed the new Sephardic Social Center at Congregation Magen David of West Deal to honor seven special community heroes who each gave the gift of life by donating a kidney. The event was organized to create awareness about RENEWAL, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping people who need a kidney transplant find a live donor, and to support that donor throughout the process.\n\nThanks to the generous sponsorship of the Century 21 and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, guests were able to mingle with the donors, their recipients and their families in the magnificently decorated hall and enjoy an elegant evening of cocktails, dinner and inspiration.\n\nAs each guest arrived, they were asked to announce their connection to either a donor or a recipient, and they were given a badge to wear with pride. Even those not related asked for a badge, as “Friends of a Donor,” so that they could show their support!\n\nDuring the program, guests sat mesmerized as kidney recipient Sam Sutton spoke about the horrors of kidney failure and his gratitude for receiving a kidney from his youngest son Albert.\n\nThen donors Albert Sutton, Zac Gindi, AJ Gindi, Tomer Naftali, Ralph Hanan, Victoria Sutton and Steven Hafif each were thanked directly by their recipients. Rabbi Eli Mansour capped off the very emotional program with words of Torah encouraging all to honor these special heroes who consider themselves just ordinary people who had to the chance to do something extraordinary, and to think about joining them to save a life.\n\nWe are happy to report that as a result of this event, many inquiries were received and at least two community members are now being tested to hopefully be a match and a lifesaver to patients on the RENEWAL list.\n\nTo date, RENEWAL has facilitated 218 live kidney donor transplants, and has over 200 men, women and children on their waiting list. There is no national or local registry for live kidney donors, and patients in kidney failure must undergo dialysis just to stay alive while they wait. The sad fact is that 60% of dialysis patients do not survive after three years.\n\nTo learn more about kidney transplant, live kidney donation and how you can support the good work of RENEWAL, please visit them at www.renewal.org, or cal (718) 431- 9831."
