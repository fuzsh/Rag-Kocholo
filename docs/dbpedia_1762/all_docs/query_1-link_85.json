        "text": "By Joshua Burd\n\nThe Goldstein Group has added a vice president in its newly formed brokerage unit focused on mixed-use retail property in downtown and urban markets.\n\nIn a news release, the firm announced the hiring of Ralph Hanan as a lead executive in its TGG Urban division. As vice president, urban retail, the 10-year industry veteran will oversee brokerage in new developments and existing buildings, as well as tenant representation and investment sales in the metropolitan New York and New Jersey submarkets.\n\n“We are very pleased to have Ralph join our professional team of urban retail brokers, as we continue to expand our TGG Urban Group with highly qualified professionals,” said Chuck Lanyard, president of the Paramus-based firm.\n\nRELATED: The Goldstein Group forms unit focused on mixed-use, urban retail\n\nThe Goldstein Group said Hanan will also direct a team of professionals providing retail leasing and advisory services to urban mixed-use property owners, developers and management firms in the region. Prior to joining The Goldstein Group, Hanan worked at Manhattan-based Metropolitan Skyline Realty, where he was responsible for leading the in-house leasing of new construction projects and existing buildings owned by the Adjmi and Gammal families.\n\nMany of those properties were owned or developed in partnership with the Cayre family’s Aurora Capital, according to a news release.\n\n“We’re excited to welcome Ralph to the team at TGG Urban,” said Scott I. Edlitz, senior vice president for brokerage operations for The Goldstein Group. “TGG Urban has fast become an industry leader in providing leasing, marketing and management operations for property owners and retail end users in areas such as New Jersey’s Hudson River Gold Coast communities across from Manhattan, including Jersey City, Hoboken and West New York. Ralph will also be concentrating on New York City’s five boroughs.\n\n“Ralph’s talents and extensive experience in urban retail will be a valuable asset as we further strengthen our presence and expand our footprint in these key markets.”\n\nWhile with Metropolitan Skyline, Hanan completed transactions with national, regional and local tenants to curate a tenant mix for each property that would maximize value for the owners and provide a unique and satisfying experience for the communities, the news release said. He represented a portfolio of nearly 200 buildings located in all five boroughs of New York and New Jersey in high-traffic urban retail corridors.\n\n“There’s a tremendous opportunity in the current retail environment for property owners, be it with existing buildings or new construction, to team with retail service providers seeking to establish or expand their presence in urban markets,” Hanan said. “While bricks and mortar retail is changing, it’s most certainly not fading away.\n\nThe Goldstein Group announced the launch of TGG Urban this summer, with a goal of providing retail leasing and advisory services to urban mixed-use property owners, developers and managers in the region. The firm will focus its efforts on key northern New Jersey areas — including Jersey City, Hoboken, Newark and Montclair — as well as the New York City boroughs.\n\n“To best serve these clients, we’re assembling a team of professionals with in-depth knowledge of the retail corridors throughout the five boroughs of New York and the urban centers of New Jersey who understand the retail needs of these communities,” Hanan said. “TGG Urban has the ability to shift our approach with the changing retail landscape to create customized experiences for each neighborhood.\n\n“Our goal is to analyze each trade area and property specifics to perfectly match owners with amenities such as restaurants, grocery, fitness, nightlife and other experiential retail to create high-performing and vibrant live/play/work centers.”"
