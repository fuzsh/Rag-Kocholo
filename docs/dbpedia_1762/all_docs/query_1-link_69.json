        "text": "Ten-Year Industry Executive Will Oversee Brokerage of Urban Retail Properties in New Jersey/New York Submarkets\n\nChuck Lanyard, President of The Goldstein Group (TGG), has announced that Ralph Hanan has joined Paramus, N.J.-based company as a lead executive within TGG Urban, the recently-formed division which has tapped into the growing shift towards creating walkable retail and residential centers in downtown City settings.\n\n“We are very pleased to have Ralph join our professional team of urban retail brokers, as we continue to expand our TGG Urban Group with highly qualified professionals,” remarked Mr. Lanyard.\n\nMr. Hanan will serve as Vice-President, Urban Retail, overseeing the brokerage of new developments and existing buildings, as well as tenant representation and investment sales in the metropolitan New York and New Jersey submarkets. He’ll also direct a team of professionals providing retail leasing and advisory services to urban mixed-use property owners, developers and management firms in the region.\n\n“We’re excited to welcome Ralph to the team at TGG Urban,” added Scott I. Edlitz, Senior Vice President Brokerage Operations for The Goldstein Group. “TGG Urban has fast become an industry leader in providing leasing, marketing and management operations for property owners and retail end users in areas such as New Jersey’s Hudson River Gold Coast communities across from Manhattan, including Jersey City, Hoboken and West New York. Ralph will also be concentrating on New York City’s five boroughs. Ralph’s talents and extensive experience in urban retail will be a valuable asset as we further strengthen our presence and expand our footprint in these key markets.”\n\nPrior to joining The Goldstein Group, Mr. Hanan worked at Manhattan-based Metropolitan Skyline Realty where he was responsible for leading the in-house leasing of new construction projects and existing buildings owned by the Adjmi and Gammal families, with many in partnership with the Cayre family’s Aurora Capital. He represented a portfolio of nearly 200 buildings located in all five boroughs of New York and New Jersey in high traffic urban retail corridors. While with Metropolitan Skyline, Mr. Hanan completed transactions with national, regional and local tenants to curate a tenant mix for each property that would maximize value for the owners and provide a unique and satisfying experience for the communities.\n\n“There’s a tremendous opportunity in the current retail environment for property owners, be it with existing buildings or new construction, to team with retail service providers seeking to establish or expand their presence in urban markets,” Mr. Hanan says. “While bricks and mortar retail is changing, it’s most certainly not fading away.\n\n“To best serve these clients, we’re assembling a team of professionals with in-depth knowledge of the retail corridors throughout the five boroughs of New York and the urban centers of New Jersey who understand the retail needs of these communities. TGG Urban has the ability to shift our approach with the changing retail landscape to create customized experiences for each neighborhood. Our goal is to analyze each trade area and property specifics to perfectly match owners with amenities such as restaurants, grocery, fitness, nightlife and other experiential retail to create high-performing and vibrant live/play/work centers.”\n\nTGG Urban offers comprehensive and full-service programs, drawing on The Goldstein Group’s distinguished history of providing comprehensive retail real estate services. Over the past thirty-five years, TGG has specialized in the handling of free-standing commercial buildings and shopping centers, as well as central business districts and planned urban/suburban projects comprising retail, restaurants and residences. The division will bring the personalized approach, professionalism and market insight of one of the northeast’s leading retail leasing teams, to mixed-use developers and property owners.\n\nAbout The Goldstein Group\n\nBased in Paramus, N.J., The Goldstein Group was founded in 1986 with a retail focused dedication to providing retail real estate services to its broad customer base. The Goldstein Group puts the best interests of our clients first by offering personal attention, sophisticated research, and strategic business advice.
