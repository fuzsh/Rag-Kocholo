        "text": "Electorate boundaries map\n\nEnlarge image\n\nSource: Parliamentary Library\n\nThe Invercargill electorate takes in the communities of Invercargill, Bluff, Stewart Island, Riverton, and Wallacetown. Its eastern boundary lies to the east of Waikawa Valley and Progress Valley, and its western boundary extends into the Fiordland National Park.\n\nIn the 2020 boundary review, Invercargill was below quota so gained population from its only neighbour, Southland. The Representation Commission’s proposed solution was to add both the Winton and Catlins areas. Objections raised on community of interest grounds resulted in the Winton and Catlins areas remaining in the renamed Southland electorate, with Invercargill gaining population by expansion into western Southland, including Tuatapere.\n\nThe Invercargill electorate has existed continuously since 1866. Josiah Hanan (Liberal) held the Invercargill seat for 26 years, from 1899 to 1925. His nephew, Ralph Hanan (National) held the seat from 1946 to 1969. As Minister of Justice, Ralph Hanan was a noted law reformer. He had a role in the establishment of an ombudsman in New Zealand (the first in the English-speaking world), the creation of the Law Commission, and the abolition of capital punishment.\n\nSince 1935, the electorate has shifted between National and Labour, with National holding the seat since 2005. The electorate’s first woman MP, Sarah Dowie (National), held the seat from 2014 to 2020. At the 2020 election Invercargill was won by Penny Simmonds (National).\n\nThe Invercargill electorate recorded a 0.8% annual average population increase between Census 2013 and Census 2018, about one-third of that recorded by New Zealand as a whole over the same period (2.1%). While the proportion of those identifying as Māori in the electorate (16.4%) is about the same as in New Zealand overall (16.5%), the proportion in the European ethnic group is much higher at 85.7% compared to 70.2% nationally. Almost nine in ten people (87.8%) in the electorate were born in New Zealand, while 12.2% were born overseas – respectively, the third-highest and third-lowest proportions found in any general electorate.\n\nOver half (52.8%) of occupied dwellings comprised three bedrooms; and for those in rented occupied dwellings 45.1% paid between $200 and $299 per week – percentages that were the highest in New Zealand. Just over one in eight households (12%) used coal as their primary heating fuel, down from nearly a third (31.4%) of households who used coal as their primary heating fuel in 2013.\n\nElection results (2020)\n\nThe winning candidate in the 2020 election, Penny Simmonds (National Party), captured a plurality (45.5%) of the 39,412 valid electorate votes cast for candidates in the Invercargill electorate, with a margin of 224. The seat was previously won in 2017 by Sarah Dowie (National Party) with a margin of 5,579. The Labour Party captured a plurality (48.1%) of the party votes in Invercargill, up 12.3 percentage points on its party vote share in 2017. Turnout (total votes cast as a proportion of enrolled electors) in 2020 was 83.0%.\n\n2020 General election results – electorate candidate votes\n\nInvercargill\n\nCandidate\n\nValid Votes\n\nShare (%)\n\nSIMMONDS, Penelope Elsie (NAT)\n\n17,929\n\n45.5\n\nCRAIG, Elizabeth Dorothy (LAB)\n\n17,705\n\n44.9\n\nFRANCIS, Rochelle Monique (GP)\n\n1,137\n\n2.9\n\nHONISS, Joshua (CNSP)\n\n757\n\n1.9\n\nGUNN, Joshua George (NZF)\n\n735\n\n1.9\n\nROHLOFF, Kurt Helmuth (ADV)\n\n417\n\n1.1\n\nWEST, Jacqueline (ONE)\n\n237\n\n0.6\n\nAROHA, Winsome (SC)\n\n206\n\n0.5\n\nWALKER, Basil Walter (IND)\n\n187\n\n0.5\n\nHAYDEN, Zy Maceahno (IND)\n\n102\n\n0.3\n\nValid Total\n\n39,412\n\n100.0\n\nTotal Votes Cast\n\n40,457\n\nWinning Candidate: SIMMONDS, Penelope Elsie - margin: 224\n\nFor interpretation of abbreviations, see Glossary.\n\n2017 General election results – electorate candidate votes\n\nInvercargill\n\nCandidate\n\nValid Votes\n\nShare (%)\n\nDOWIE, Sarah (NAT)\n\n18,102\n\n51.05\n\nCRAIG, Liz (LAB)\n\n12,523\n\n35.31\n\nBOND, Ria (NZF)\n\n3,214\n\n9.06\n\nSURENDRAN, Rochelle (GP)\n\n1,623\n\n4.58\n\nTotal Valid Votes\n\n35,462\n\n100\n\nTotal Votes Cast\n\n35,907\n\n101.25\n\nWinning Candidate: DOWIE, Sarah - margin 5579\n\nFor interpretation of abbreviations, see Glossary.\n\n2014 General election results – electorate candidate votes\n\nInvercargill\n\nCandidate\n\nValid Votes\n\nShare (%)\n\nDOWIE, Sarah (NAT)\n\n17,526\n\n52.09\n\nSOPER, Lesley (LAB)\n\n10,044\n\n29.85\n\nBOND, Ria (NZF)\n\n2,526\n\n7.51\n\nKENNEDY, David (GP)\n\n2,497\n\n7.42\n\nSTORR, Laura (CNSP)\n\n719\n\n2.14\n\nDE RUYTER, Stephnie (NZDSC)\n\n333\n\n0.99\n\nTotal Valid Votes\n\n33,645\n\n100\n\nTotal Votes Cast\n\n34,473\n\n102.46\n\nWinning Candidate: DOWIE, Sarah - margin 7482\n\nFor interpretation of abbreviations, see Glossary.\n\nGeneral election results – party vote 2014-2020\n\nInvercargill\n\nParty\n\nValid Votes\n\nShare (%)\n\nValid Votes\n\nShare (%)\n\nValid Votes\n\nShare (%)\n\n2014\n\n2017\n\n2020\n\nLabour Party\n\n8,553\n\n25.1\n\n12,891\n\n35.8\n\n19,252\n\n48.1\n\nNational Party\n\n16,880\n\n49.5\n\n17,414\n\n48.4\n\n11,996\n\n30.0\n\nACT New Zealand\n\n113\n\n0.3\n\n95\n\n0.3\n\n3,846\n\n9.6\n\nGreen Party\n\n2,581\n\n7.6\n\n1,166\n\n3.2\n\n1,386\n\n3.5\n\nNew Zealand First Party\n\n3,806\n\n11.2\n\n3,139\n\n8.7\n\n1,218\n\n3.0\n\nNew Conservative\n\n862\n\n2.2\n\nThe Opportunities Party (TOP)\n\n760\n\n2.1\n\n433\n\n1.1\n\nAdvance NZ\n\n406\n\n1.0\n\nAotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party\n\n224\n\n0.7\n\n141\n\n0.4\n\n220\n\n0.5\n\nONE Party\n\n158\n\n0.4\n\nSocial Credit\n\n81\n\n0.2\n\nMāori Party\n\n110\n\n0.3\n\n79\n\n0.2\n\n76\n\n0.2\n\nNZ Outdoors Party\n\n23\n\n0.1\n\n44\n\n0.1\n\nSustainable New Zealand Party\n\n20\n\n0.0\n\nTEA Party\n\n16\n\n0.0\n\nHeartlandNZ\n\n8\n\n0.0\n\nVision New Zealand\n\n8\n\n0.0\n\nBan1080\n\n173\n\n0.5\n\n103\n\n0.3\n\nConservative\n\n1,256\n\n3.7\n\n73\n\n0.2\n\nDemocrats for Social Credit\n\n95\n\n0.3\n\n43\n\n0.1\n\nUnited Future\n\n68\n\n0.2\n\n27\n\n0.1\n\nNew Zealand People's Party\n\n21\n\n0.1\n\nInternet Party\n\n9\n\n0.0\n\nMANA\n\n6\n\n0.0\n\nInternet MANA\n\n210\n\n0.6\n\nThe Civilian Party\n\n23\n\n0.1\n\nFocus New Zealand\n\n10\n\n0.0\n\nNZ Independent Coalition\n\n11\n\n0.0\n\nTotal Valid Votes\n\n34,113\n\n100.0\n\n35,990\n\n100.0\n\n40,030\n\n100.0\n\nTotal Votes Cast\n\n34,473\n\n101.1\n\n36,153\n\n100.5\n\n40,338\n\n100.8\n\nVoter enrolment and turnout 2017 and 2020\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\n2017\n\n2020\n\nVoting Age Population (VAP)*\n\n51,760\n\n3,569,830\n\n56,000\n\n3,772,100\n\nElectors on General Roll (EGR)\n\n45,163\n\n3,046,216\n\n48,734\n\n3,273,567\n\nElectors on Māori Roll\n\n2,970\n\n251,793\n\n3,337\n\n276,013\n\nTotal Enrolled**\n\n48,133\n\n3,298,009\n\n52,071\n\n3,549,580\n\nTotal Votes Cast by EGR (TVC)\n\n36,334\n\n2,462,199\n\n40,457\n\n2,728,333\n\n% VAP Enrolled\n\n93\n\n92\n\n93\n\n94\n\nTurnout (TVC as % EGR)\n\n81\n\n81\n\n83\n\n83\n\n*Estimated population statistics as at: June 2017 and June 2020 (provisional, using 2018 Census data). ** Electoral Enrolment Centre statistics as at September 2017; and Electoral Commission enrolment statistics as at October 2020.\n\nThis section has a variety of information about people living in the electorate.

It also has information about residential building consents issued.\n\nThe census distinguishes between dwellings, households, and families. A dwelling refers to the physical structure. A household is either one person who usually lives alone, or two or more people who usually live together. A family comprises a couple with or without children or one parent and their children.\n\nThere are two tables describing homeownership. They differ in measuring ownership at the individual or the household level. A household may own their dwelling but not all people within that household share in the ownership.\n\nHouseholds, 2018 Census\n\nfor households in occupied private dwellings\n\nInvercargill\n\n2006\n\n2013\n\n2018\n\nTotal households\n\n25,857\n\n27,354\n\n28,068\n\nAnnual average intercensal growth rate (%)\n\n…\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\nGrowth rate rank\n\n…\n\n39\n\n55\n\nNew Zealand growth rate (%)\n\n…\n\n0.9\n\n1.3\n\nDwelling occupancy status, 2018 Census\n\nfor all private dwellings\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\nOccupancy status\n\nno.\n\n%\n\nrank\n\n%\n\nOccupied private dwellings\n\n28,209\n\n90.7\n\n46\n\n89.7\n\nTotal unoccupied private dwellings\n\n2,892\n\n9.3\n\n20\n\n10.3\n\n– Residents away\n\n1,191\n\n3.8\n\n32\n\n5.3\n\n– Empty dwellings\n\n1,698\n\n5.5\n\n17\n\n5.1\n\nTotal private dwellings\n\n31,101\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nPrivate dwellings under construction\n\n69\n\nSector of landlord, 2018 Census\n\nfor households in rented occupied private dwellings\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\nSector of landlord\n\nno.\n\n%\n\nrank\n\n%\n\nPrivate person, trust, or business\n\n6,351\n\n88.5\n\n22\n\n83.5\n\nLocal authority or city council\n\n291\n\n4.1\n\n5\n\n2.1\n\nHousing New Zealand Corporation\n\n357\n\n5.0\n\n49\n\n12.0\n\nIwi, hapū, or Māori land trust\n\n..\n\n..\n\n..\n\n0.3\n\nOther community housing provider\n\n102\n\n1.4\n\n18\n\n1.2\n\nOther government\n\n66\n\n0.9\n\n21\n\n0.9\n\nTotal stated\n\n7,179\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nNot elsewhere included\n\n12\n\nTotal\n\n7,191\n\nWeekly rent paid, 2018 Census\n\nfor households in rented occupied private dwellings\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\nWeekly rent paid\n\nno.\n\n%\n\nrank\n\n%\n\nUnder $100\n\n648\n\n9.2\n\n12\n\n6.5\n\n$100 - $149\n\n954\n\n13.5\n\n10\n\n8.9\n\n$150 - $199\n\n1,311\n\n18.6\n\n3\n\n6.7\n\n$200 - $299\n\n3,180\n\n45.1\n\n1\n\n17.7\n\n$300 - $399\n\n798\n\n11.3\n\n57\n\n22.0\n\n$400 - $499\n\n81\n\n1.1\n\n65\n\n17.6\n\n$500 - $599\n\n24\n\n0.3\n\n63\n\n10.4\n\n$600 and over\n\n48\n\n0.7\n\n62\n\n10.2\n\nTotal stated\n\n7,047\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nNot elsewhere included\n\n144\n\nTotal\n\n7,191\n\nAccess to telecommunication systems, 2018 Census\n\nfor households in occupied private dwellings\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\nAccess to telecommunication systems\n\nNumber\n\nPercent\n\nRank\n\nPercent\n\nNo access to telecommunication systems\n\n306\n\n1.2\n\n26\n\n1.1\n\nAccess to a cellphone/mobile phone\n\n24,231\n\n91.4\n\n46\n\n91.9\n\nAccess to a telephone\n\n17,034\n\n64.3\n\n32\n\n62.5\n\nAccess to the internet\n\n21,237\n\n80.1\n\n61\n\n86.1\n\nTotal stated\n\n26,511\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nNot elsewhere included\n\n1,557\n\nTotal\n\n28,068\n\nMain types of heating used to heat dwellings, 2018 Census\n\nfor households in occupied private dwellings\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\nHeating type (total response)\n\nno.\n\n%\n\nrank\n\n%\n\nNo heating used\n\n159\n\n0.6\n\n57\n\n4.0\n\nHeat pump\n\n16,170\n\n60.8\n\n12\n\n47.3\n\nElectric heater\n\n9,051\n\n34.1\n\n57\n\n44.1\n\nFixed gas heater\n\n1,149\n\n4.3\n\n59\n\n11.7\n\nPortable gas heater\n\n756\n\n2.8\n\n58\n\n6.3\n\nWood burner\n\n12,279\n\n46.2\n\n15\n\n32.3\n\nPellet fire\n\n228\n\n0.9\n\n18\n\n1.0\n\nCoal burner\n\n3,126\n\n11.8\n\n2\n\n1.2\n\nOther types of heating\n\n1,767\n\n6.6\n\n4\n\n3.0\n\nTotal stated\n\n26,577\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nNot elsewhere included\n\n1,899\n\nTotal\n\n28,209\n\nDwelling dampness indicator, 2018 Census\n\nfor households in occupied private dwellings\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\nDampness indicator\n\nno.\n\n%\n\nrank\n\n%\n\nAlways damp\n\n558\n\n2.2\n\n49\n\n3.0\n\nSometimes damp\n\n4,335\n\n16.8\n\n43\n\n18.5\n\nNot damp\n\n20,889\n\n81.0\n\n20\n\n78.5\n\nTotal stated\n\n25,782\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nNot elsewhere included\n\n2,427\n\nTotal\n\n28,209\n\nDwelling mould indicator, 2018 Census\n\nfor households in occupied private dwellings\n\nInvercargill\n\nNZ\n\nMould indicator\n\nno.\n\n%\n\nrank\n\n%\n\nMould over A4 size - always\n\n849\n\n3.3\n\n48\n\n4.3\n\nMould over A4 size - sometimes\n\n2,730\n\n10.5\n\n45\n\n12.6\n\nNo mould/mould smaller than A4 size\n\n22,332\n\n86.2\n\n19\n\n83.1\n\nTotal stated\n\n25,914\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nNot elsewhere included\n\n2,298\n\nTotal\n\n28,209\n\nResidential building consents (number of units), 2016-2020 (year to March)\n\nInvercargill\n\nResidential building type\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nTotal residential buildings\n\n157\n\n166\n\n167\n\n148\n\n257\n\nHouses\n\n122\n\n128\n\n149\n\n136\n\n233\n\nApartments\n\n0\n\n15\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nRetirement village units\n\n30\n\n11\n\n5\n\n0\n\n9\n\nTownhouses & other residential\n\n5\n\n12\n\n13\n\n12\n\n15\n\nAreas of deprivation map\n\nThis map visually represents areas of deprivation within the electorate.

It also includes information about non-residential building consents issued.\n\nIncome is the total before-tax income of a person, household, or family in the 12 months ended 31 March 2018. Family and household income is derived by taking the income of all members aged 15 and over of the family or household. Income does not include Working for Families tax credits.\n\nGraph: Total personal income (%)\n\nThis graph visually represents the data in the Total personal income, 2018 Census table in the Work and
