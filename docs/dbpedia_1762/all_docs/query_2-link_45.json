        "text": "The island nation of New Zealand is made up of a North and South Island as well as approximately 600 smaller islands, and is located around 1,500 kilometers to the east of Australia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. New Zealand's capital city of Wellington is situated on the southern end of the North Island and lies along the Cook Strait (giving it a strong coastal breeze and the nickname 'Windy Wellington', as well as the honor of being the world's windiest city, with an average wind speed of more than 26 km/h). Wellington is also the southernmost capital city of a sovereign state. The city is relatively small and has a population of 412,500 residents, making it the second-largest city in New Zealand.\n\nNew Zealand's most populous city is Auckland, with a population of 1.5 million in its urban area. Auckland is also on New Zealand's North Island, and is home to the largest Polynesian population in the world. The city regularly ranks as being among the most livable cities in the world, but it is also one of the world's most expensive cities. On New Zealand's South Island, the largest city is Christchurch, with a population of around 400,000 residents, making it the third-largest city in the country."
