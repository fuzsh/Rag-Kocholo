        "text": "Find out which famous New Zealanders have made waves across the world.\n\nFor a remote place with a small population, New Zealanders do well on the world stage.\n\nSeeing how many homegrown stars have become the biggest names in the movie industry is impressive!\n\nIn fact, for movie lovers, you can’t go long in a conversation about fantasy, sci-fi, or superhero films and TV shows without one of these famous kiwi names coming up.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention the hugely successful New Zealand singers and sports stars too. You don’t need to go to a Night Sky Reserve to stargaze in New Zealand – just turn on the TV!\n\nSo without further ado, let’s tune in and discover which famous New Zealanders have made their mark globally…\n\nThe most famous New Zealanders\n\nFamous Kiwi actors & directors\n\n1. Sam Neill\n\nWhether or not you’re from New Zealand, there’s a good chance you’ve been impressed by one of Sam Neill’s movie performances.\n\nHis first international success came after he played the lead in Jurassic Park (1993), which remains a firm favourite with families worldwide.\n\nInterestingly, the dinosaur blockbuster came out the same year as the award-winning New Zealand classic The Piano. This move was a tremendous success.\n\nOn the small screen, Neill has played roles in The Tudors, Peaky Blinders and Crusoe.\n\nSam Neill was born in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, before moving to Christchurch in New Zealand at seven years old with his family. Today he is based in Alexandra, where he owns a winery.\n\n2. Sir Peter Jackson\n\nWhen the now-famous New Zealander Sir Peter Jackson burst onto the global movie scene, no one knew how deeply he would capture the hearts of movie fans worldwide. His renowned film adaptations of The Lord of the Rings not only celebrated Tolkien’s beloved stories but also put the landscapes of New Zealand on the big screens.\n\nOvernight, New Zealand became one of the world’s biggest bucket list destinations, and the remaining movie sets remain a significant source of tourism to this day.\n\nThe director began by filming low-budget monster movies, including Heavenly Creatures which starred the brilliant New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey (who’s at #3 on this list).\n\nAfter a stint of filming Hollywood blockbusters (such as King Kong and The Hobbit series), Jackson remains most interested in creating work he’s truly passionate about.\n\nHis recent documentaries, They Shall Not Grow Old and The Beatles: Get Back, gained substantial critical acclaim, with the latter winning multiple awards.\n\nPeter Jackson was born in Wellington, where he remains to this day.\n\n3. Melanie Lynskey\n\nIf there’s one New Zealand actress that has gone from strength to strength recently, it’s Melanie Lynskey.\n\nShe started her career in Heavenly Creatures (1994), for which she won a New Zealand Film Award.\n\nSome will remember her from chick flicks such as Ever After (1998), Coyote Ugly (2000) and Sweet Home Alabama (2002), along with countless other movie roles, though she is now more known for her work in television.\n\nFor many, she’ll be recognised for her role on Two and a Half Men (2003–2015), and in more recent times Yellowjackets (2022) and The Last of Us (2023).\n\nUndoubtedly, she is one to watch.\n\nLynskey was born in New Plymouth but now lives in Los Angeles with her family.\n\n4. Taika Waititi\n\nFilmmaker Taika Waititi has become hugely influential in recent years, undoubtedly making him one of the most iconic New Zealanders.\n\nFor many living abroad, Taika Waititi’s name first became known after the horror comedy What We Do in the Shadows became a cult hit. He co-wrote the movie with another famous kiwi, Jemaine Clement (who features at #12 on this list).\n\nFollowing a slew of award-winning movies, including Jojo Rabbit, he most recently joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) – the world’s biggest movie franchise – when he directed Thor: Ragnorak and Thor: Love and Thunder. He also stepped onto the screen in the MCU, playing Korg in Avengers: Endgame and Thor: Ragnorak.\n\nBut locals know that his creative talents shined in his intimate homegrown movies, like Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (starring Sam Neill).\n\nTaika was born in Raukokore, Bay of Plenty, under the name Taika David Cohen. He now lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Rita Ora.\n\n5. Dame Jane Campion\n\nWith two Academy Awards, two BAFTAs, and two Golden Globes, the filmmaker Dame Jane Campion is often criminally overlooked when we think of the biggest names in Hollywood.\n\nNonetheless, this groundbreaking kiwi director is among the most successful and renowned female filmmakers in the world.\n\nJane Campion is the only female to be twice nominated for a Best Director Academy Award and was the first female to win the revered Palme d’Or, the most prestigious prize awarded at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nCampion filmed her most famous films, The Piano and The Power of the Dog, in New Zealand.\n\nThe Piano truly put NZ talent on display, as it made a then-11-year-old NZ actress Anna Paquin the second-youngest Oscar winner in history.\n\nCampion also co-created, co-wrote, and co-directed the award-winning TV mini-series Top of the Lake, filmed in Queenstown and Glenorchy.\n\nJane Campion was born in Wellington and now lives across the pond in Sydney.\n\n6.

KJ Apa\n\nIf you’ve seen the popular drama Riverdale, you’ll recognize the next star on this list of famous New Zealanders.\n\nKJ Apa plays Archie Andrews in the CW drama. However, he’s also appeared in A Dog’s Purpose, I Still Believe, and The Last Summer.\n\nNew Zealanders, though, will likely recognise him from Shortland Street, a local medical drama that gives lots of kiwi actors and actresses their big breaks.\n\nFor his work as an actor, Apa has picked up People’s Choice Awards, Teen Choice Awards, and a Saturn Award!\n\nWhen he’s not starring in movies, this brunette is working on his indie folk-rock music.\n\nAJ Apa was born in New Zealand and has Samoan/Pākehā heritage. He now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nDid you know? AJ dyed his hair red to play the role of Archie in Riverdale.\n\n8. Rose McIver\n\nRose McIver started her career playing a minor role in The Lovely Bones.\n\nBut she has quickly made a name for herself as one of New Zealand’s finest young actresses.\n\nYou may recognize her from The Piano and A Christmas Prince.

Anthony Starr\n\nOn that note, it surprises many to find out that Karl Urban’s nemesis in The Boys is also played by another of our most famous New Zealand actors.\n\nAnthony Starr plays the terrifying Homelander – undoubtedly one of the most unsettling villains to reach our screens in recent years.\n\nAfter starting his career in the NZ soap Shortland Street, Starr went on to star in several hit TV shows, including Outrageous Fortune and Banshee.\n\nAnthony Starr was born in Wellington and now lives in Los Angeles.\n\n11. Russell Crowe\n\nAlthough widely known as an Australian actor, Russell Crowe was actually born in New Zealand. He lived between NZ and Australia, before permanently moving there at 21.\n\nRussell Crowe is a hugely successful Academy Award-winning actor – to the point where it’s hard to remember all his blockbuster hit movies.\n\nAmong his most famous roles are Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, Master and Commander, Robin Hood, Les Miserables, Noah, and Man of Steel.\n\nMore recently, he entered the MCU, playing Zeus in Thor: Love and Thunder.\n\nRussell Crowe was born in Wellington and later went to secondary school in Auckland.

Jemaine Clement lives between Wellington, Los Angeles and Toronto.\n\n13.

Interestingly, one of her Battlestar Galactica co-stars, Alan Dale, was another much-loved kiwi actor.\n\nMore recently, fans of Parks and Recreation will recognise her as Diane.

That’s considerably taller than NZ’s highest peak. In fact, Mount Cook seems small at 3,724 metres in comparison!\n\nHowever, Mount Cook National Park was still where he did the majority of his training, and the Sir Edmund Hillary Alpine Centre serves as a reminder of his extraordinary accomplishments.\n\nSir Ed, as he is affectionately known, spent much of his life giving back to the people of Nepal.\n\nSadly he passed away in 2008.\n\nEdmund Hillary was born in Auckland, where he returned throughout his life, between many other impressive expeditions.\n\nDid you know?

He now plays for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nBut Steven isn’t the only athlete in the family!

At one point, he even shaved a #11 into his eyebrow.\n\nAfter a long battle with kidney disease, Jonah sadly passed away from complications related to his kidney disease in 2015.\n\nHe will, however, go down in history as one of the most successful New Zealand sportspeople of all time.\n\nJonah Lomu was born in Auckland and lived between Tonga and New Zealand in his early years.\n\nOther famous New Zealanders\n\n24. Jacinda Ardern\n\nIt’s rare that a New Zealand politician becomes a globally-recognised name, but that changed when Jacinda Arden became Prime Minister of Aotearoa.\n\nArdern initially made headlines for her somewhat less traditional lifestyle (in comparison to some other global leaders), but it was her leadership style that kept her in the worldwide press. Following a string of devastating events, she was used as an example of empathy, calm and compassion in crisis.\n\nPeople abroad might have first seen her in the viral video in which Jacinda Ardern calmly continues a speech during an earthquake – a unique sight for people living outside of the Ring of Fire.\n\nNo matter your politics, Jacinda is undoubtedly one of the most famous kiwis.\n\nJacinda Ardern was born in Hamilton and has lived between Wellington and Auckland in recent years.\n\n25.
