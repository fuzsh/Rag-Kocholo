This was an era before the registration of midwives, before hospital birth became the norm, before ‘safe’ Caesarean sections, before antibiotics, before the Plunket Society, before proven infant formulas and before effective contraception. These and other developments would revolutionise the experiences of women and babies during the twentieth century: with good reason, then, most studies of childbirth in New Zealand have used the nineteenth century simply as the ‘before’ introduction to an analysis of some dramatic modern development. As an historian of the 1800s, I want to understand the lives of New Zealand families of that period on their own merits, not simply as the forerunner of later developments. The few major studies of the history of childbirth in New Zealand are highly politicised; they reflect, and in some cases form part of, the power struggle between midwives and doctors over the care of birthing women.1 This power struggle is a long-standing one, and was present to a lesser degree in the nineteenth century. It is not possible to stand entirely apart from such debates, but I have tried to take a balanced approach: not all nineteenth-century midwives were ignorant and dangerous, but neither were they all caring and skilled; not all Victorian doctors were ‘meddlesome’ and over enthusiastic users of instruments, but neither were they all competent birth attendants. Birth attendants are of course critical to any history of childbirth, and therefore feature prominently in this book, but I have tried, where possible, to centre the story on birthing women, their babies and families: this is their history. With that in mind, I have also moved the story beyond the birthing room, looking at how mothers dressed and fed their newborn babies, along with the social and religious rituals they used to mark their entrance into the world. Rituals such as naming, baptism and the churching of women (‘the thanksgiving of women after childbirth’) are clearly culturally driven, but the extent to which every element of childbirth is influenced by culture is remarkable: this is not simply a ‘natural’ process. Physiology aside, the childbirth experiences of vii\n\nIntroduction\n\ntwenty-first-century New Zealand mothers are enormously different from the experiences of nineteenth-century women. Likewise, within the nineteenth century, there are major contrasts between the birth ways of Māori and Pākehā. The editors of a book on the role of the midwife in Europe and the United States put this point well: ‘What is so striking is that, in spite of the universality of childbirth, its cultural expression and professional and legal regulation vary enormously across time and space, even within the context of the Western world.’2 Born to a Changing World, which considers a period before significant legal regulation of childbirth, provides abundant evidence that most birthing practices are determined by culture, not nature.3\n\nGeorge and Martha Clarke with their thirteen surviving children, about 1868. PAColl-6081-1, Ngā Kupu Kōrero Collection, Alexander Turnbull Library\n\nChildbirth is obviously an important element in the life and culture of any society, but its varying incidence means it is more significant in some societies than others. Colonial New Zealand featured an abundance of babies. From the 1840s to the 1870s a very high proportion of Pākehā women married, and they married young. These marriage patterns were the chief contributors to a high fertility rate, for this was an era when childbearing occurred largely within the confines of\n\nviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nmarriage, and contraception was unreliable.4 Official statistics for ‘illegitimate’ births – those where the parents were not married – are not available until 1872, but from then to the end of the century just 3.1 per cent of non-Māori live births fell outside the bounds of marriage (the number crept up from a mere 1.4 per cent in 1872 to 4.4 per cent by 1899).5 Māori received from the early Anglican and Methodist missionary wives, who were prominent among the European women bearing children in early nineteenth-century Aotearoa, some hint of the European population boom to come. Protestant missionaries took the biblical injunction to ‘be fruitful, and multiply’ seriously.6 Many were married couples, young and fertile. In 1834 Eliza White of the Wesleyan Mission Station at Mangungu, in the Hokianga, wrote to her friend Jane Hobbs in Tonga, informing her of the birth of her son John two months earlier, and adding: Mrs Woon was confined just sixteen days before me of a boy, Mrs Mitchell a few days before Mrs Woon of a boy, and Mrs Whiteley was confined 12 days ago of a little Girl and Mrs Young expects in a few days or weeks at most! – are you all doing as well at Tonga.7 Anglican couples serving with the Church Missionary Society (CMS) also tended to have large families. Henry Williams and his wife Marianne Coldham arrived in the Bay of Islands along with their three children in 1823; Marianne gave birth to eight further children in New Zealand. Henry’s brother, William Williams, arrived in New Zealand with his new wife Jane Nelson in 1826; over the next twenty years Jane bore nine children. The twenty Williams cousins and their parents were a force to be reckoned with in early nineteenth-century Aotearoa. In 1831, with the eleventh and twelfth cousins newly born, Henry Williams wrote to his mother in Nottingham: ‘It really makes my hair stand up when I think of our prodigious families. Our good friends in Salisbury Square may well hang the lip at such a generation pending, the natives are not sparing in their remarks and tell us we shall soon take the land.’8 Despite their large families, Marianne and Jane Williams were not the most prolific breeders among the early CMS missionary women: that honour fell to Martha Clarke. George Clarke and Martha Blomfield married in England and spent some time in New South Wales before arriving in Kerikeri with their firstborn in 1824; the family quickly expanded. In 1846 William Williams wrote to congratulate his colleague George Clarke on the fact that Martha had been ‘mercifully preserved through the birth of her fifteenth child’, continuing: ‘May an abundant measure of grace be poured out upon all your children, that they may be themselves the children of God, and be made useful in their day and generation in promoting the well being of their fellow creatures.’9 Though the missionaries came to this country to convert and to ‘civilise’ Māori rather than to colonise them, they became, unintentionally, the forerunners ix\n\nIntroduction\n\nof large-scale European migration. When the colonisation of New Zealand began in earnest in the 1840s, the young and fertile dominated migration flows. Promoters of colonising schemes, including the New Zealand government, viewed young couples as highly desirable immigrants. At their peak of strength and fitness, they could help in the demanding task of developing a ‘new’ land; with the future of their families at stake they were highly motivated to work hard and make the colony a success. Even better, they would bear children, thus adding to the natural increase of the population, which was an outcome the colonisers much desired. Young married couples, with or without children, thus featured prominently among European migrants to New Zealand, as did other healthy young people who would later marry in the colony.10\n\nx\n\nIntroduction\n\nTwo unidentified women, photographed by Alexander Fletcher of Nelson in the 1860s. Neither succeeded in completely hiding her pregnancy. 2346/8 Fl ¼ 38k and 2813/18 Fl 4x5, Fletcher Collection, Nelson Provincial Museum\n\nFew women bore as many children as Martha Clarke, but many of the colonists had families that were large by twenty-first-century standards. Even when national fertility rates dropped in the final decades of the nineteenth century – chiefly because more women married later, or did not marry at all – large families were common. In the 1911 New Zealand census, married women were asked how many live births they had experienced. Women aged over fifty, most of whom would have completed their families in the nineteenth century, averaged 5.8 births each, and more than half had given birth to six or more children. A remarkable 81 per cent of New Zealanders aged over fifty – those born before 1861 – were from families of six or more children.11 Though these figures included migrants who were not born in New Zealand, they give a broad idea of the high fertility rates of the New Zealand colonists and their source cultures in the nine-\n\nxi\n\nIntroduction\n\nteenth century. Fertility was at its highest in the early years of the Wakefield settlements, such as New Plymouth, where in the 1840s more than half the brides were under twenty and they went on to have an average of over ten children each.12 Peter Wilson, the Colonial Surgeon at New Plymouth, reported in 1849 that, among the colonists, ‘numerously healthy progeny’ were ‘actively advancing augmentation’.13 Four years later he boasted that there had been just ten deaths in a population of over two thousand, while ‘births amounted to no fewer than ninety seven, and I may state the fact as honorable to the moral bearing of the Settlement, that, with only one exception, all were born within the pale of the married state’.14 In contrast to this enormous fecundity of the colonists, Wilson noted that for local Māori, childless couples were ‘rather more the rule than the exception’, and ‘few couples indeed are to be met with who have more than one or two children, and these, commonly, are a puny, or sickly offspring’.15 The recent introduction of European diseases to which they had little resistance, combined with the economic impact of the loss of land, undoubtedly affected Māori health and family size. Effects on fertility rates – the number of children born to each woman – are less clear, and data are patchy for the early and middle decades of the century. The introduction of sexually transmitted diseases must have reduced the fertility of some Māori, but the devastating impact of colonisation on the Māori population was principally due to very high mortality rates rather than low birth rates: it was impossible for Māori women to bear enough children to replace community members lost to disease. Epidemics killed many young people, reducing the pool of potential parents, and infant mortality was also very high. Some scholars believe Māori birth rates prior to European contact were reasonably high, while others suggest that small families may have been the eighteenth-century norm in at least some Māori communities.16 Fertility probably varied from place to place according to local economic circumstances and cultural patterns. Ngāi Tahu anthropologist Atholl Anderson writes that, for southern Māori, ‘small family sizes seem to have been normal at contact, and probably prehistorically’, with prolonged breastfeeding (for three or four years) one of the controls on fertility.17 By the late nineteenth century, Māori fertility rates were high: like Pākehā, Māori women bore more children than their modern counterparts. In the 1880s and 1890s they gave birth to an estimated average of 5.5 babies each, a number that would rise even higher in the early decades of the twentieth century. Like the colonists, they formed partnerships young and few remained single; these were the two most important controllers of fertility in an era before reliable contraception. Sadly, giving birth to several children did not guarantee a large family, for high infant mortality had a devastating effect on Māori well into the twentieth century.18\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nMargaret Gray of Otanomomo, South Otago, who bore five children between 1867 and 1872, attempted to disguise her pregnant state with a coat when photographed.

In this photograph, taken around the 1870s, she probably wore the coat to hide her pregnancy. Album 14, Otago Settlers Museum\n\nOf course, a clear distinction between the tangata whenua and the colonists does not fit with all of the realities of nineteenth-century life. In some parts of New Zealand – particularly in the far south and the far north, the regions of earliest contact between the different cultures – partnerships between Māori and Pākehā were common and there were many children of mixed ethnic background (generally known at the time as ‘half-castes’). Some of these children identified\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nstrongly with iwi, while others had closer ties to the colonial community. Atholl Anderson comments that in the far south, many women of mixed Māori/Pākehā descent married Europeans and had very large families, much like the pioneering settler women.19 Women of other than Māori or European descent were very rare in New Zealand during this period and evidence about their fertility levels and childbirth experiences is non-existent or at best slim. The most significant other ethnic group was the Chinese, who accounted for 1.4 per cent of the overseasborn population by 1896. The number of Chinese women, however, was tiny: the census of 1896 recorded a Chinese population of 3,719, only twenty-four of them female.20 Whatever their ethnicity, one thing is clear: women living in this country in the nineteenth century were highly likely to bear children and childbirth was a common experience. But while pregnancy was common, it was largely invisible in Pākehā public culture. Even within private circles – such as in letters written to other family members – many Victorian women avoided any explicit mention of pregnancy. Those who did so used a variety of euphemisms: they were increasing, or in the family way or, even more discretely, they were ill, or expected to be laid up. Unborn or newborn children were often dubbed ‘little strangers’: people they were yet to meet and get to know. It is striking how infrequently pregnancy was evident in nineteenth-century photographs. Among the hundreds of Victorian photographic portraits at the Otago Settlers and Nelson Provincial museums, I located only a handful of women who appear to be with child. Two unidentified women, photographed by Alexander Fletcher in Nelson during the 1860s, could not quite disguise their advanced pregnancies, although they made attempts to do so. The tightly laced corsets and voluminous skirts of the era were natural camouflage, and one woman added an unusual fringed vest, which almost succeeded in hiding her expanding belly.21 Mary Ann Downes, wife of the Port Chalmers postmaster, is not so obviously pregnant in a photograph taken around the 1870s (see p.15), but the long coat she wore to hide her condition gives her away, for coats and cloaks were most unusual garb in photographic portraits. Another example of a coat worn to disguise a pregnancy appears in a photograph from my own family collection. Margaret Gray, my great great grandmother, lived in rural South Otago, where she gave birth to five children between 1867 and 1872. The demands of farming and raising a family probably made visits to the nearest town, Balclutha, quite infrequent. Dunedin photographer Harry Coxhead set up a studio, most likely short-lived, in Balclutha in 1871.22 Perhaps Margaret took this rare opportunity to be photographed (see p.15) on a trip to the town; otherwise she would have had to travel much further, to Milton, Dunedin or Invercargill. Only an unusual opportunity such as this would drive a woman to have a photograph taken when visibly pregnant. Photography was expensive and people of limited means might only have their portrait taken once in a lifetime, if at all; they wanted to appear at xv\n\nIntroduction\n\ntheir best. A photograph in the Alexander Turnbull Library collection of an unidentified Māori couple from the Hutt Valley presents an interesting contrast to the images of settler women. The woman has laid her hand over her gently rounded belly, thus drawing attention to it. Was she trying to protect her unborn child from the power of the photographer’s lens, or did she wish to reveal her fertility? As husband and wife lean affectionately towards each other we get an impression of a proud family portrait.\n\nAn unidentified Māori couple from the Hutt Valley, photographed by William Henry Whitmore Davis around the 1860s to 1870s. PA2-0609, Alexander Turnbull Library\n\nThe taboos surrounding pregnancy among the Pākehā middle classes went\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nfar beyond the realm of photography: women who were visibly pregnant avoided going out in public. In 1856 Maria Atkinson, who would soon give birth to a stillborn premature daughter, wrote from Taranaki to her sister-in-law. She did not attend one of the highlights of New Plymouth social life, the freemasons’ ball, ‘not on account of health or my own feelings so much as out of respect to the feelings of friends who may feel distressed at my personal appearance which is certainly … far from elegant’.23 The concept of pregnancy as ugly and upsetting to the eye resulted from complex (and sometimes contradictory) Victorian ideals concerning women and sexuality. Pregnancy provided clear evidence that a woman was a sexual being. Furthermore, ‘respectable’ women, from the highly fertile Queen Victoria to her colonial subjects, sometimes felt that frequent pregnancy revealed the animal nature of a woman: she was like a breeding cow or dog.24 Fortunately for the purposes of this book, it was a lot harder to hide the birth of a child than to keep silent about a pregnancy. Though their language was not always explicit, and their descriptions seldom as detailed as we might expect today, many colonial women and their families wrote about experiences of childbirth and the care of their newborn babies in their letters, diaries and reminiscences.25 These stories of individual mothers and babies lie at the heart of this book. Of course, not all women are represented in such sources, for not all women could, or would, write their stories. Some groups of women are revealed not through their own words, but in the records of the state or other authorities. The experiences of the poor and the unmarried, for example, appear in the records of hospitals and charitable organisations, and occasionally in court and inquest records. The papers and publications of health professionals – midwives, nurses and doctors – provide yet another perspective on childbirth in this period. Statistics, where available, provide context for the anecdotal experiences of individuals. As with the experiences of the poorest of Pākehā women, I have explored those of Māori women through ‘outsider’ sources, most of them male. Māori childbirth practices of the nineteenth century were described by missionaries and other European observers, and later by anthropologists, some of whom were themselves Māori. As I have not had the resources to explore the experiences of Māori women as revealed in oral traditions, this book’s discussion of the Māori world of childbirth is introductory only, limited to what was revealed in written sources. Born to a Changing World is arranged thematically. The first two chapters examine the experience of childbirth in the nineteenth century: the first looks at Māori birth ways, while the second examines Pākehā birthing practices. Chapter Three explores hospital birth. As institutional lying-in wards were generally the last resort of the single and the poor, this chapter reveals something of their experiences. The next three chapters shift the focus towards newborn babies: the intricacies of their clothing, how and what they were fed, and the rituals that welcomed them into the world. The last two chapters deal with two of the sad xvii\n\nIntroduction\n\nrealities of childbirth in the nineteenth century: maternal and infant mortality. As a whole, the book explores the ways in which the ‘little strangers’ who had nestled for nine months in their mothers’ wombs entered the lively world of nineteenth-century Aotearoa.\n\nxviii\n\nCHAPTER ONE Open Air and the Whare Kōhanga Māori Birth Ways Every culture develops its own customs around the process of childbirth. The practices of the Māori and European communities in nineteenth-century New Zealand differed in almost every way imaginable, even if we only consider the more physical aspects of childbirth: where the delivery took place, the woman’s posture during the birth, who assisted her, how they dealt with the afterbirth, and the length and nature of the new mother’s recovery period. Missionaries and colonists often expressed surprise at Māori ways of childbirth, while Māori found European birthing practices bizarre. Māori childbirth customs, like those of Europeans, differed from place to place and from community to community; they also evolved over time. Furthermore, much of the surviving evidence about Māori practice comes from European sources: the pens of missionaries, explorers and other amateur anthropologists who took an interest in Māori ways of living in the nineteenth century. There is, however, enough consistency in such reports, bolstered by more recent Māori sources, to give us some insight into ‘traditional’ Māori childbirth.1 GIVING BIRTH OUTSIDE OR IN THE WHARE KŌHANGA While most European women gave birth in their own beds, this was anathema to Māori women. Childbirth was a highly tapu process and the place where it occurred became tapu along with the mother and baby. Because of this, Māori women generally gave birth outdoors; as Edward Tregear, a prominent intellectual and Polynesian scholar, explained, this was ‘so that no building should thereby be rendered tapu and useless’.2 Women in labour found a secluded spot in the bush some distance from their kāinga (village) for their delivery. This allowed for privacy and separated childbirth from everyday activities that were at risk from tapu. William Goldie, a doctor who researched Māori medical lore, wrote that among Tūhoe communities it was ‘deemed unseemly to utilise a dwelling-house for this purpose, and not right that people should hear the groans of the parturient woman’.3 1\n\nMost women found the natural shelter of the bush sufficient for their birthing place, but many communities erected special temporary buildings for women of higher status, such as those from chiefly families. Elsdon Best recorded a detailed account of such buildings and the customs surrounding them as recalled by Te Whatahoro Jury of Ngāti Kahungunu, from the East Coast of the North Island. The whare kōhanga, or nest house, was prepared at some distance from a kāinga once a woman of high rank had reached an advanced state of pregnancy. Made of fern, flax and bark, it featured a porch at the front where the woman could sit and eat; when her time of delivery drew near, the woman moved into the whare kōhanga, along with two female attendants, or tapuhi.4 Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hiroa) of Ngāti Mutunga (from Taranaki) also wrote of the special birthing house built for women of ‘the aristocracy’, as did the colonial administrator and scholar Edward Shortland.5 Thomas Bell, a New Zealand-born doctor who completed his medical training in Edinburgh, practised in Whanganui and spent some time up the Whanganui River in the late 1880s. There, he reported, a woman might give birth in a ‘special whare or tent … set apart for her’.6\n\n2\n\nCHAPTER ONE Open Air and the Whare Kōhanga Māori Birth Ways\n\nA Māori woman and baby, possibly from the Rotorua district, 1892. PAColl-0378-1, Patricia Hislop Collection, Alexander Turnbull Library\n\nAfter mother and babe returned to her usual home, the whare kōhanga had to be completely burned so nobody could be damaged by contact with such a tapu place; a tohunga removed the tapu from the site. Peter Buck explained this process using twentieth-century public health images: ‘the maternity house was equivalent to an infectious disease shelter, and the treatment by fire and ritual destroyed a psychological source of infection in a similar way to the material destruction of microbic infection by fire or fumigation with chemicals’.7 When the time for delivery came, Māori women generally adopted a kneeling or squatting position. These upright birthing positions were common through\n\n3\n\nPolynesia and in many other cultures, though they had been abandoned by most Europeans during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Gravity assists the birth when a woman is kneeling or squatting, but more importantly, as modern studies using magnetic resonance imaging reveal, these positions also expand the internal dimensions of the pelvis significantly when compared with horizontal positions.8 Māori women leaned on and clung to a tree or to posts especially designed for their support. A story common to several iwi, including Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Porou, tells of the origin of such posts. The ancient chief Tura, also known as Wai-rangi or Wairangi-haere, married Turaki-hau, one of the Aitingaa-nuku-mai-tore, who were tree-dwelling fairies. When the time for Turaki-hau to give birth approached, Tura learned that it was customary among this fairy race to deliver children by cutting them from the womb, thus killing the mother. Determined to save his wife’s life, he built her a special house in which he placed two (in some versions three) poles, one to rest against and one or two to hold onto for support as she delivered her child. The baby was born as Tura chanted incantations and Turaki-hau’s life was saved; the Aitinga-a-nuku-maitore abandoned their old practice and adopted natural delivery for childbirth.9 ASSISTANCE DURING THE BIRTH Another contrast between Māori and Pākehā practices was in the use of attendants during the birth. Māori women of status, ensconced in the whare kōhanga, had other women to support and assist them during childbirth, but ‘ordinary’ women often gave birth alone and with little fuss, as Goldie explained: In some Maori tribes, as soon as the woman finds her labour has commenced, she takes her rug and goes into the open air, into a quiet, retired place. If it is her first child a woman attends her; after the first child she goes alone, no one interfering unless assistance is solicited.10 Edward Williams of Waimate, a member of the large missionary family, informed Dr Joseph Hooker in the 1860s that, ‘According to Maori custom the pains of child-birth were invariably endured in solitude …. Though, through intercourse with Europeans assistance is now sometimes brought in, the feeling is against it.’11 When birth attendants were used they were not always women, for in many Māori communities husbands were the first choice of assistant. Other family members, including the mother’s parents or siblings, also lent a hand in many cases. Assistants might, literally, support the birthing woman as she knelt or squatted. Sometimes they played a more active role, squatting in front of the woman and pressing their knees down upon the top of the womb to help the child along.12 When Hannah King gave birth at the new Rangihoua mission station in 1815, 4\n\nCHAPTER ONE Open Air and the Whare Kōhanga Māori Birth Ways\n\nlocal Māori expressed astonishment at her behaviour and mocked her writhings, cries and groans. John Liddiard Nicholas, an Englishman who visited the mission along with Samuel Marsden at this time, wrote of one man who ridiculed ‘the extreme timidity of our countrywomen in this situation, compared to the hardy resolution of the New Zealand ladies’. Māori women would not, like King, call out for their husbands; they ‘would have more spirit than to use such an exclamation in so trifling an affair as the delivery of a little infant’, the man boasted. Instead they would sit down in the open air, give birth ‘without uttering a single groan’, cut the cord, rise up ‘as if no such occurrence had taken place’ and resume their everyday activities.13 Of course Māori childbirth sometimes became more complicated than this Rangihoua observer suggested. If labour was prolonged or events did not progress normally, Māori families called in an outside expert. Traditionally, this role was filled by the tohunga, the ritual expert and priest who mediated between people and the gods. He also filled the important role of healer, for illness, in the Māori world, came from spiritual imbalances and supernatural forces.14 To aid in a difficult birth, generally attributed to evil spirits or some shortcoming of the mother, the tohunga recited various chants and karakia to Hine-te-iwaiwa, the goddess of childbirth, and called the child forth from the womb, often reciting its whakapapa. The combination of incantation and pressure on the uterus aided many a delivery.15 Among Te Arawa, if reciting the child’s whakapapa failed to prompt its birth, suspicion fell upon the chastity of the mother. The traditional story of the birth of Tutanekai – famous for his romance with Hinemoa – illustrates this. His mother Rangiuru, the wife of an important Te Arawa chief, Whakauekaipapa, had a prolonged labour. When the tohunga recited the genealogy of her husband, matters did not improve. Rangiuru eventually confessed to an affair with Tuwharetoa, the famous chief for whom the neighbouring iwi is named. When the tohunga recited the whakapapa of Tuwharetoa, the true father, baby Tutanekai was born.16 A similar story, also from Te Arawa, tells of Uenukurauiri of Puketapu pā, Te Teko. She laboured for a long time and became weak; the tohunga’s recitation of the whakapapa of Uenukurauiri and her husband Maungarangi failed to help. Eventually the desperate mother asked the tohunga to recite the child’s whakapapa through Rangiwhakaekeau, who had visited Puketapu some nine months earlier: ‘almost at once the child slipped effortlessly from Uenukurauiri. Then everyone in the pa knew that the true father of the child was that Rotorua chief.’17 At least one other iwi had similar traditions: Ngāi Tahu leader Teone Taare Tikao recounted another example relating to his ancestors in Turanga.18\n\n5\n\nMidwife Christina Simonsen (seated at left), photographed in old age with her daughter (Marian Wratt), granddaughter (Ruby Field) and great granddaughter (Ethne Field). Courtesy of Nola Leov\n\nThough Māori kept largely to their own birthing practices throughout the nineteenth century, they sometimes called on Pākehā assistance when complications arose; Christian conversion perhaps undermined the role of the tohunga as first choice of healer in some families and communities. Christina Simonsen served as midwife to both Māori and Pākehā communities around Canvastown, between Nelson and Havelock. Simonsen had migrated from Denmark along with her husband and family in 1874; from about 1881 they leased land around the Taituku pā, which had been deserted by Māori some years earlier after an epidemic. Her grandson recalled his father’s memories of Christina Simonsen: she\n\n6\n\nCHAPTER ONE Open Air and the Whare Kōhanga Māori Birth Ways\n\nwas ‘the midwife for the Māori mothers who used to have their babies in a big clump of fern or manuka. Dad used to carry the lantern when a night delivery took place and he had to “stay put” a few yards back from the “maternity ward” when grandma went about a delivery.’19 Presumably Māori women were willing to call on Simonsen for assistance because she accommodated herself to their traditional practices, such as giving birth outdoors. Colonisation brought the devastation of European diseases to a vulnerable Māori population, but the colonisers also brought a range of medicines and treatments previously unknown to indigenous communities. The missionaries brought with them extensive medical supplies which they dispensed to ailing Māori, a role later taken over by Pākehā chemists and doctors (though not all Māori communities had access to these facilities).20 Many colonial medicines were, by today’s standards, of doubtful value and others were positively harmful, but some could be very effective. One powerful weapon in the western medical armoury was the drug ergot. Derived from the toxin of a fungus that grows on rye, ergot has been known in Europe for centuries. It causes powerful contraction of the womb and can save the life of a woman who is haemorrhaging after giving birth (a synthetic form is still used routinely to help deliver the placenta and prevent bleeding). Ergot can also be used to bring on labour, or an abortion, or to increase the vigour of contractions when labour is prolonged and the mother’s strength fails. It was, along with opium, ‘indispensable’ to the ‘armamentarium’ of the Victorian accoucheur, according to William Leishman, the Glasgow Professor of Midwifery whose 1873 System of Midwifery was a recommended text for New Zealand medical students.21 Whanganui doctor Thomas Bell told the story of a Māori woman with serious childbirth complications who resorted to European treatments in 1887. The woman (whom Bell did not name) lived some 25 kilometres from town. She had previously given birth to ten children with labours ‘easy and short’. This time, though, her labour was not an easy one, for the child was lying crossways in the womb: a situation now most often called a transverse lie, but popularly known as a crossbirth in the nineteenth century. A crossbirth was highly dangerous, for the baby could not fit through the birth canal this way, and active intervention was necessary to ensure the safety of mother and child. After eleven hours of labour the baby’s arm and shoulder appeared. The woman’s brother, by then serving as midwife, pulled on the arm, but still the baby would not come. Bell makes no mention of a tohunga: instead the whānau sent for a missionary, who administered two or three doses of ergot. In a case like this, ergot was of no use; it increased the strength of the contractions for a while, but the baby still failed to emerge into the world of light. Whānau and missionary both lacked the knowledge and experience to deal with this situation, which was fortunately not a common one: to save the life of the mother, who was quickly sinking, the child would have to be turned in the womb. By the time Bell arrived at the whare where the woman lay, she had been 7\n\nin labour for twenty-four hours and was weak and shocked. He gave her chloroform so he could attempt the often difficult operation of turning the baby in the womb. This time, it proved easy: as Bell attempted to put his hand into the womb, the baby’s arm and shoulder popped back up and it turned without further assistance. Bell then used forceps to quickly deliver the child. This, however, was not the end of the mother’s troubles. Bell was horrified to discover that her uterus had a rupture, a complication that was normally fatal. The rupture probably arose, wrote Bell, from ‘the injudicious use of ergot and forcible traction’, though he admitted it could possibly have come from ‘mechanical injury during my manipulation’. He told the whānau that the woman could not survive; in the absence of ‘stimulants’ they did their best to keep her warm and comfortable. The next day, Bell was surprised to hear she was still alive; he gave her opiates for her severe abdominal pain. More remarkably, the woman slowly recovered: ‘Six weeks after confinement, I hear she is going about as usual’ commented Bell, who found her recovery so astonishing that he wrote about it for the New Zealand Medical Journal.22 This incident ended happily and revealed that cooperation between Māori and Pākehā birth ways could occur, but inquests into the deaths of two young Māori women in the late nineteenth century revealed that differences between the two cultures remained strong. Sixteen-year-old Georgina Wrathall from Otorohanga, Ngāti Maniapoto territory in the King Country, died in 1896 after giving birth. Wrathall delivered her son at the Otorohanga home of Henrietta Reid, the wife of a railway labourer. Though the district had only been opened up to European settlement a few years earlier, this was a truly mixed-race event with two or three Pākehā women and around eight Māori present. Despite all this attention, the birth did not progress well, and after Wrathall had been labouring for three or four days without result the women called on outside expertise in the form of Wyld Pairman, a former Edinburgh medical student who had set up as a chemist and health practitioner in Te Awamutu. Pairman evidently worked quite often as a childbirth attendant and had assisted at Māori births before, though his inability to speak the language must have proved a handicap. Soon after he arrived Wrathall managed, with his assistance, to deliver her son at last; she insisted on doing so Māori fashion, on her knees, rather than lying on her left side as was usual in the cases he attended. Then the real problems began. When the child did not cry immediately, Pairman reached for him, causing an outcry from Wrathall’s whānau. They pushed Pairman away and, with Reid acting as interpreter, told him to leave; he had, as later evidence revealed, upset them by approaching the baby from the wrong side, thereby, presumably, losing their confidence in his ability to manage this highly sensitive and tapu process. Pairman was angry too: ‘I said before leaving the room that I could not take the responsibility of taking this case unless I was allowed to do as I wished.’ The Māori women continued attending to Wrathall and her son, but when the mother, who had been weak and exhausted by the 8\n\nCHAPTER ONE Open Air and the Whare Kōhanga Māori Birth Ways\n\ntime of the birth, fainted and looked very unwell, they allowed Pairman to return. The afterbirth was not arriving in timely fashion, so he intervened, with the assistance of a dose of ergot, to deliver it. Wrathall remained faint and restless, refusing Pairman’s instructions to keep still; eventually ‘she laid down and died’. Pairman believed she had died ‘from exhaustion through a protracted labour and haemorrhage’. The women witnesses at the inquest disputed his claim of excessive bleeding, not believing it had been any more than was usual. Pairman was critical of the Māori women for not tying the cord at both ends after cutting it, but Manawa Ellis explained: ‘With natives it is not the custom to tie the cord at the end nearest the mother. In my opinion the bleeding was no greater than with other women I have helped to confine.’ The inquest jury ruled that Georgina Wrathall died ‘of the weakness and disorder occasioned by such violent and lingering pain, difficult birth and hard labour’.23 This sort of incident must have discouraged Māori from involving Pākehā at their births. The case of Ruhia Poharama, who died a couple of months after giving birth in 1898, involved Māori custom from start to finish and resulted in an inquest only because of Pākehā interference some time after her death. Poharama gave birth at Ohia, in the far north, with Rehi Teira to attend her. The birth was straightforward and all went well until about three days later, when Poharama developed a fever. With the support of her husband, Henare Paore, the ailing woman decided to call on a tohunga for assistance: Neho Popota came to treat her, and later she also received treatment from two further tohunga, Mrs Wi Conrad and a healer identified only as Jessie. Two of these tohunga ordered that Ruhia be dipped in cold water, a traditional treatment that had become ‘something of a cure-all’ by the turn of the century.24 Her husband and friends carried her to Lake Ohia, close to her home, several times for this treatment. Rehi Teira reported that she ‘often heard [Ruhia Poharama] express a wish to be dipped in cold water’. About a month after the birth she became sicker, and she eventually died. Some time after the death, an unidentified Māori informed the Mangonui police constable that Ruhia Poharama had died while under the treatment of a tohunga. He informed his superiors and the district coroner ordered an inquest, which required Poharama’s body to be exhumed a month after her burial. The body was so decomposed that it revealed nothing about how the woman had died, but the evidence of various witnesses resulted in a verdict highly critical of the tohunga and of Māori medical practice. Thomas Trimnel had been practising as a doctor in Mangonui for forty years and dispensed medicine free to Māori under a government scheme. He believed that ‘dipping the woman (in cold water) lately confined would be very dangerous and likely to cause or hasten death … I am clearly of the opinion that the immersions in cold water hastened death.’ Trimnel did not stop there: ‘I have heard of tohungas but do strongly disapprove of their treatment …. I believe that hundreds of Māoris have been killed by the treatment of tohungas during the time I have lived in this district.’ The jury ruled that ‘Ruhia Poharama died after her confinement and that her death was either directly 9\n\ncaused or greatly due to being immersed in cold water at so critical a period and that we greatly condemn the action of Neho Popota, the tohunga, and others in the matter’.25 This inquest was part of an extensive campaign against tohunga, of whom Pākehā had always been highly suspicious; a new wave of Māori health promoters also opposed the traditional healers. The campaign would culminate in the 1907 Tohunga Suppression Act, though attempts to limit the practice of traditional Māori healers were not highly successful.26 As Māori came increasingly under the power of the state, and as their communities developed ever greater contact with European ways, they faced some unenviable tensions. When complications arose during childbirth, should they turn to Pākehā health practitioners and treatments? In some cases this might improve the chances of mother or child, but Europeans could be ignorant or insensitive about Māori cultural practice, acting in ways that risked the spiritual and psychological well-being of the whānau. Yet, if Māori kept to their own traditional methods, they risked intervention from state authorities, as the inquest into Ruhia Poharama’s death so clearly demonstrates. AFTER THE BIRTH – RECOVERY AND THE REMOVAL OF TAPU Not all Māori childbirth practices attracted criticism from Europeans: the colonists commented on the rapid recovery of Māori women after giving birth with a mixture of amazement and admiration (possibly with a veiled suggestion that it resulted from a less ‘civilised’ way of life). At a time when European women normally kept to their beds for a week after giving birth, Māori women were up and carrying out their usual activities very quickly. Jessie Campbell, a recent migrant, wrote from Whanganui to her sister in Scotland in 1843: I must give you an account of the accouchement of a native woman which I heard the other day, I think it will astonish some of the good folks at home. She was delivered without going to bed – on the floor! And an hour afterwards went down to the river to wash herself and the child. Both are quite well.27 In 1849 the Wesleyan missionary William Woon, stationed in south Taranaki, wrote of a visit he made to a feast at Katotauru:\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER ONE Open Air and the Whare Kōhanga Māori Birth Ways\n\nMāori carrying infants in the Rotorua area, around 1882.

She actually went out two days after her confinement, and assisted to get food for her friends! This threw her back and she remained in her house ill. What would ladies at home think of getting up the second or 3rd day after a confinement? Such cases are no doubt rare in England; but they are very common in New Zealand.28 Some Māori got up even sooner than that. Edward Williams of the far north and Cristoph Dierks, a German Lutheran missionary at Maxwelltown, up the coast from Whanganui, both witnessed Māori women at work in the fields go to a secluded spot to give birth, then return soon afterwards – in one case two hours later – to their work.29 Williams told of once coming across ‘several natives sitting by the road side’, commenting:\n\n12\n\nCHAPTER ONE Open Air and the Whare Kōhanga Māori Birth Ways\n\nI was surprised to learn that they were waiting for a woman of their party who, at a little distance from them, had shortly before given birth to a child, and was then recruiting her strength preparatory to continuing the journey. I remained with them about an hour, and as I left saw this woman proceed on foot with the rest of the party, carrying the newly-born infant herself.30\n\nWhakarewarewa, in the Bay of Plenty, 1889.

G-710, Alexander Turnbull Library\n\nWomen of noble rank would not have behaved in this way, but women of lower status in the hierarchy of Māoridom evidently expected few concessions on giving birth. While Europeans were astonished at the rapid recovery of Māori women after childbirth, Māori found the Pākehā custom of lingering in confinement for a week after giving birth equally peculiar, and probably regarded it as a sign of weakness. A woman from the Kaikoura district recalled the stories handed down by her grandmother, an Irish migrant working with her husband on the isolated Kahutara sheep run during the 1860s: Next thing was, Granny had another baby. Grandfather wanted to get in another woman to help at the birth, but there was no woman to get! When the baby was born on the mat by the bedside, he fainted. Grandmother told me: ‘I just had to lie there and wait until he came round, then he lifted us onto the bed.’ He insisted on going to get a Maori woman. It was a long, rough walk, four miles through the swamp, but she came. When she saw\n\n13\n\nGrandmother in bed with the baby in her arms she turned to go. Granny tried to get her to stay but she wouldn’t; said her husband needed her! She couldn’t see what the fuss was about; the mother and the baby were healthy. So Grandfather brought Granny in a basin of water. She washed the baby and a day or two later she got up and did her work as usual.31\n\nThe distinguished Māori anthropologist and politician Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hiroa) (c.1877–1951) who wrote about traditional Māori ways of birth. Photographed by William Henshaw Clarke. F-94-35mm-E, General Assembly Library Collection, Alexander Turnbull Library\n\nImmediately following birth, a Māori mother and infant were both tapu, though this was applied more rigorously to women of high status. Shortly after her delivery, a new mother bathed, along with her child, in a nearby stream or pool. Thereby, explained Peter Buck, she could ‘cleanse herself physically and psychologically’.32 At Whakarewarewa, the Te Arawa district rich with thermal\n\n14\n\nCHAPTER ONE Open Air and the Whare Kōhanga Māori Birth Ways\n\npools, a particular pool was set aside for women to bathe in following childbirth.33 George Bennett, an English surgeon and naturalist who travelled widely in the Pacific in the 1820s and 30s and visited the Bay of Islands, the Thames River (Waihou) and possibly other places in Aotearoa, discovered that, after bathing, recently delivered Māori women … use a vapour bath, which is made by heating stones, and throwing water, and three kinds of shrubs in a green state upon them … from these a steam arises, over which they sit; this is done to promote the lochial discharge, or, to use their own expression, ‘to make the blood come from them’. Bennett identified the plants used as tataramoa, mangeo and kotukutuku; women sat over the vapour for about an hour soon after giving birth, and again the following day.34 Bell reported that Māori women living in some of the communities up the Whanganui River bathed using a large pot of water warmed with leaves of the blue gum after delivering a child; if there was any haemorrhage they drank some of the infused water. In other parts of the district they bathed directly in a creek or river.35 Goldie stated that a woman remained tapu until the time of the infant’s baptism (of which more in Chapter Six), or longer if she was unwell or still bleeding. ‘Generally, however, only the wives of chiefs are subject to this rigorous custom.’ Special karakia said by a tohunga removed the tapu.36 Removing tapu could also involve more complex rituals, which varied from place to place and according to the social standing of mother and child. Edward Shortland, who spent much time with Māori, described a two-part ceremony that made a child noa, or free from the restrictions of tapu. The father kindled a ‘small sacred fire’ on which he roasted fern root. He then took his baby in his arms and touched various parts of its head and body with the prepared fern root, known as horohoronga. The father next ate the horohoronga. The ceremony was repeated the following day by the baby’s eldest relative in the direct female line; this completed the removal of tapu.37 The placenta (whenua) and umbilical cord (iho) were also tapu. Europeans generally burned the placenta: according to folk traditions of East Anglia, England, recorded in the 1930s, a child would die if the placenta was not burnt, and a family counted the number of times it ‘popped’ during incineration to predict the number of children the mother would bear.38 Māori, by contrast, considered it ‘unlucky’ to burn the placenta, according to Thomas Bell.39 Instead they buried it – highly appropriate for an item that shared its name with the word for land – in a safe place, ‘where it was not likely to be walked over’, as Buck wrote.40 Edward Williams reported that in the far north Māori planted a tree over the spot where they buried the placenta: ‘If the infant was a boy, and likely to become a person of note, this spot would in due time be pointed out to him, and ever afterwards be remembered.’41 When the remaining portion of the umbilical cord separated from the infant, 15\n\ngenerally a week or so after the birth, it was also treated with great care. This marked the time when the period of tapu after birth ended and baptismal rites should take place. An unidentified informant told Hooker that if the iho was lost, ‘it was an ill omen of the worst kind, the child would not be expected to live long’. Instead this sacred item was hidden in a place of significance to the child and its whānau, perhaps the cleft of a rock or tree branch; sometimes it was buried at the foot of a tree or near a territorial boundary, and the spot marked with a special post. This served ‘to show the claim of the child to certain land’; Williams knew of cases of ‘territorial right being claimed in consequence of the placenta and umbilical cord having been buried in the vicinity, the tree being pointed to as evidence’.42 The iho of several generations of a rangatira family could be placed in the same location. Sometimes a tree was specially planted over the iho. Tregear wrote that ‘a certain Maori chief asserted that he had a familiar spirit inhabiting a white pine tree, and this tree which had sprung from his umbilical cord (iho) grew with his growth, and fell to decay as he became aged’.43 The association between child, iho and tree was clearly a powerful one: as one of Hooker’s informants noted, ‘if the tree or bush at the roots of which the [iho] was buried showed signs of decay or died, the results would be similar to the child’.44\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways THE EARLY MISSIONARIES AND CHILDBIRTH Among the first Europeans to give birth here were the Anglican and Wesleyan missionary wives who came to this country from 1814 onwards. In the early years of the missions, European women were few and far between in Aotearoa. It is striking, therefore, how very rarely, in the face of frequent childbirth, they turned to Māori for assistance. This reflected the great contrasts between Māori and European ways of childbirth, and also, perhaps, a reluctance to turn for help to those they had come to ‘save’. Missionary women lived in the midst of Māori communities and employed young Māori women in their homes, teaching them the arts of European domestic life and manners, but when it came to childbirth they would sometimes go to extreme lengths to have another European woman present. They made long journeys over difficult terrain to be with their compatriots at ‘the time of nature’s trial’ (a phrase that appears frequently in missionary letters). In 1836 Anne Chapman undertook a tortuous journey to assist Elizabeth Hamlin of the Mangapouri Station at Pirongia. Chapman worked with her husband at the CMS Te Koutu Mission Station at Rotorua, but at the time she was staying at Te Papa Station (Tauranga) because of warfare in the Rotorua district. When Hamlin was almost due to give birth Chapman travelled to Matamata and then, accompanied by fellow missionaries Charlotte and Alfred Brown, continued for a further seven days on foot and by river until they reached Pirongia. The women ‘very kindly offered to undertake the journey in the depth of winter’, recorded James Hamlin, because there was ‘no European female nearer than Matamata, which is 60 miles’. They arrived safely despite an eventful journey during which they met numerous men travelling to Matamata to join Te Waharoa’s war party and encountered gales and drenching rain. Chapman and Charlotte Brown assisted Hamlin at the birth of her son, then, once she had recovered, made the long journey home.1 Jane Woon, who was originally from Cornwall, was an experienced midwife 17\n\nwho travelled to assist her fellow Wesleyan missionaries when required. In 1837, while stationed with her husband at Mangungu, on the Hokianga, she journeyed south to Kaipara with her six-month-old son to be with Mary Ann Wallis for her confinement. William Woon expressed his anxiety over his wife’s journey in a letter to his mission society: ‘Mrs Woon has been carried by the natives – by the sea coast, over hills & valleys, rivers & plains upwards of 100 miles to Bro Wallis’s station and I hope has arrived in safety.’2 William Woon later joined his wife at Kaipara, and after Wallis had recovered from the birth of a healthy son the Woons returned home. ‘In journeying to and from that place the natives were very kind and exerted themselves to promote our comfort’, William recorded. Nevertheless, it was no easy journey: ‘We have had to sleep in the bush and the rain fell in torrents; but we were preserved from colds. At one place a river was so swollen from the rain that I was obliged to swim across.’3 Occasionally it was the expectant mother, rather than the midwife or friend, who made the journey that ensured European company during childbirth. In 1845 Elizabeth Colenso made an epic two-week winter journey from the CMS station at Ahuriri (Napier) to the Turanga (Gisborne) station in her eighth month of pregnancy: she had hoped to leave earlier but her husband William’s illness delayed their trip. Jane Williams had invited her to give birth at Turanga if she was ‘not able to get a respectable white woman to be with her’ and, as William Colenso noted, there was ‘no help of any kind at hand’.4 Clearly the missionary families did not consider the Māori communities they lived within could provide the sort of assistance and support they preferred during childbirth. Several of the early missionary women undertook midwifery training in Britain before coming to the South Seas mission fields. This was not so much for the benefit of the indigenous women with whom they were to live, but to prepare themselves for those times when, isolated from other European women or medical assistance, they would need to know how to cope independently with childbirth. Catherine Leigh, wife of the first Methodist missionary to Aotearoa, arrived in 1822 equipped with recent midwifery instruction; she was probably the first formally trained European midwife in this country. The minutes of the Wesleyan Missionary Committee for 1821 reveal that ‘Mrs Widgeon, Matron of the London Lying-in Hospital, had kindly admitted Mrs Leigh to attend at the Hospital, to receive instructions in Midwifery during several weeks, and that she had kindly offered to instruct any Missionary’s wife whom the Committee may wish to place under her care.’ The committee agreed to ‘embrace her offer with respect to the wives of their Missionaries’.5 Formal midwifery training was uncommon in Britain at that time; most women in the trade learned their skills on the job or from another experienced midwife. Only a few received training as Catherine Leigh did, at one of the specialist lying-in hospitals that had emerged in the eighteenth century as philanthropic institutions for care of the poor.6 How often Leigh had cause to call on her midwifery training in this country is unclear. Several of the CMS missionary 18\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nwives gave birth during her stay in New Zealand, and as the Leighs lived for over a year with the CMS families in the Bay of Islands, remaining always on good terms with them, it is likely that she helped at some – perhaps all – of their deliveries. When the Wesleyans left to establish a new mission station further north at Kaeo, James and Harriet Shepherd of the CMS accompanied them. Harriet Shepherd was seven months pregnant and no doubt depending on Catherine Leigh’s midwifery skills to deliver her child. Shortly after the Shepherd baby was born the Leighs, who were in their second year with the New Zealand mission, left for Sydney, a move prompted by Samuel Leigh’s illness. Catherine died there in 1831.7\n\nElizabeth Colenso (1821–1904), who made an epic winter journey while advanced in pregnancy to be near another European woman during childbirth.

The first three CMS women – Dinah Hall, Hannah King and Jane Kendall – arrived in the Bay of Islands in 1814. King gave birth just two months after stepping on the shores of Aotearoa, and Hall after another three months. As they had children already, the three pioneer women were able to call on their prior knowledge and experience to support one another during childbirth. In 1821 William Hall, the mission carpenter, wrote to the CMS that his wife Dinah ‘was safely delivered of a son, without any professional assistance whatever: but, with the kind attention of Mrs Kendall and Mrs King, all was well, for which we desire to be thankful to Almighty God, ascribing to him all the praise and all the glory’.8\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nMarianne Williams (1793–1879), missionary, pioneer midwife and mother of eleven, photographed in old age, around 1868, with two of her granddaughters (Evelyn Williams and Agnes Lydia Williams).

Two 1820s additions to the CMS mission staff were particularly welcome to prospective parents. Marianne Williams had, like Catherine Leigh, undertaken midwifery training in England in preparation for missionary life. Her 1823 arrival was timely, for Leigh was about to leave for New South Wales; the knowledge and experience of Marianne, wife of Henry Williams, the new leader of the CMS mission, was most welcome during the delivery of many missionary children. Three years later Henry’s brother, William\n\n21\n\nWilliams, joined the mission. He had been a doctor prior to his ordination as a clergyman and, with doctors few and far between, his medical skills were frequently called on by Māori and Pākehā in the districts where he was stationed; like his sister-in-law he assisted at many births.9 Marianne Williams was a remarkable woman with many skills and talents; along with midwifery, she trained in nursing, cookery and teaching in preparation for mission work. Together with her sister-in-law Jane Williams, she ran schools for Māori and European girls, in addition to caring for her own busy household and supporting her husband and the mission community. She gave birth to eleven children herself, the fourth coming just three months after the Williams family first arrived in the Bay of Islands. Samuel Marsden, founder of the mission, who was visiting from New South Wales, recorded the event: In the dusk of the Evening I arrived safe at Pyhea [Paihia], and in about an hour after my arrival Mrs Williams was safely delivered of a little Boy. She had a very easy birth; The Lord is good and gracious, a present Help in time of need, and never faileth those that put their trust in him. Mrs Williams is a Woman of strong Faith, and sound Piety, and has no idea of fear and on these accounts she is well suited for her present situation, happy and content at all times.10 Marianne Williams’s own record of the birth, which took place in the tiny cottage they were sharing with the Fairburn family (who had a new baby themselves), makes it clear why Marsden was so impressed: On the day of Henry’s birth I drank tea with the family, and with great difficulty washed my children and put them to bed; after which I walked out in the moonlight with Henry – and soon retired to my own room. Henry summoned the family to prayers; before the close of which Mr Marsden arrived with Captain Moore, in the boat of the latter, and while Henry was getting tea for them and giving grog to the boat crew, and Mrs Fairburn at the other end of the house was putting her children to bed, and attending to her baby, I, left entirely to myself, did feel more justly my only aid to come from God, and cling more closely to the only source of strength. As soon as the children had played themselves to sleep, I made my preparations and went to bed. I gladly heard Captain Moore depart! And a short time afterwards Mrs Fairburn arrived to my assistance just as the dear little one began to cry. I never felt so much joy before.11 Giving birth alone, like this, may have been routine for Māori women, but it was beyond the expected behaviour of European women, prompting commendations of bravery when it happened. Though childbirth was generally easy for Marianne Williams, like many women she also had times of trouble: she came close 22\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nto death in 1829 after ‘very violent haemorrhage’ following the birth of Sarah, her seventh child.12 William Williams, who presumably attended his sister-in-law during this crisis, recorded that Marianne ‘was mercifully preserved from most imminent danger. It was generally expected that she would have sunk under her trial but it pleased our heavenly father to carry her through.’13 The Wesleyan Missionary Society (WMS) encouraged its early missionary wives to undertake midwifery training, but later Wesleyan missionaries arrived less well prepared. In 1835 Jane Woon, stationed with her husband in the Waikato, gave birth to her fourth child. The two other missionary wives who assisted her had no midwifery experience, prompting Jane’s husband William to write to the mission society in England: ‘could the Committee have witnessed the fear and trembling manifested by them when in the hours of distress’ they would ‘see the necessity’ of granting all missionary wives the privilege of midwifery training. As William Woon explained: When in England, my dear wife and her companions Mrs Turner and Mrs Watkin were privileged with visiting the London Hospital in St Luke’s Old Street Road, for the purpose of practising midwifery. Mrs Woon and Mrs Watkin who are mothers can never forget the valuable instruction and advice communicated by the Matron and other acting persons, which have been of great service in the hour of nature’s sorrow during their residence in the South Seas. All the mission women should have ‘this advantage’, argued Woon. He reminded the committee that during the family’s time in Tonga, prior to coming to New Zealand, the knowledge of one of the other trained women had saved Jane Woon’s life: ‘My dear wife was in critical circumstances at one time when an unnatural presentation took place; and had not the individual present known how to act she might have died.’14 COLONIAL MIDWIFERY Missionary women were the first qualified European midwives in New Zealand; other experienced midwives joined them as migration grew through the nineteenth century. Colonial children were usually born into the arms of a visiting midwife or doctor, though some arrived without such assistance. Isolation, poverty or a particularly speedy labour could result in only a family member or neighbour being at hand; a few women gave birth alone. Midwives varied from highly experienced practitioners with professional training to friends or neighbours who had learned what to do through observing a couple of other births. It is not possible to know exactly what proportion of births each of the various types of birth attendant was involved in. Some countries included the name of 23\n\nthe attendant in birth registrations, but this information was not required in New Zealand. In a detailed study of birth registrations in Dungog, rural New South Wales, between 1856 and 1896, Glenda Strachan found that doctors attended 27 per cent of births, women who acted regularly as midwives attended 47 per cent, and most of the remaining mothers gave birth with just a friend or neighbour to assist. Doctors were called on most often by families living in town or by the wealthiest farmers. This was, comments Strachan, ‘a pattern similar to that described for other regions’.15 That pattern may have extended also to the colonists of New Zealand. Strachan notes that location and wealth were important in selecting a birth attendant, ‘but these are not the only determinants. Some wealthy families did not have a doctor present while some labourers who resided in Dungog had a doctor in attendance.’16 That was also the case in this country. New Zealand had no midwifery qualification or formal training of its own until the passing of the Midwives Act of 1904; this legislation led to the establishment of midwifery training at St Helens hospitals, the first of which opened in 1905. To obtain registration, women had to complete a twelve-month course (reduced to six months if they were already a registered nurse), deliver a set number of babies and pass an examination. In addition, existing midwives were able to register under two categories: ‘Class A’ midwives had a certificate in midwifery approved by the registrar, while a ‘Class B’ midwife had to satisfy the registrar that ‘she had been for at least three years in bona fide practice as a midwife, and that she bears a good character’ (the Act assumed that all midwives were women). Existing midwives without certificates had to apply by the beginning of 1906 or lose the opportunity for recognition as Class B midwives; practising midwifery without registration became illegal in 1907.17 When the register of midwives was first published in the New Zealand Gazette in 1906 it listed 63 Class A midwives and 662 in Class B: clearly the great majority of turn-of-the-century midwives had no formal professional training.18 Most qualified migrant midwives had certificates from England, Scotland, Ireland or the Australian colonies, reflecting the ethnic background of the colonial population. But the qualifications of the midwives also reflected the minority of New Zealand migrants who came from other countries.19 Johanne Marie Thorpe, who practised in Wellington in the 1880s as ‘accoucher and certified midwife’, obtained her qualifications in her home country of Norway. She was presumably one of the many Scandinavians who came to New Zealand on government migration schemes during the 1870s.20 More typically, Susan Harold qualified in Ireland, which at the time was highly regarded for its obstetrics education. Originally from Aberdeen, Harold spent fifteen years in India with her husband’s regiment, the 72nd Highlanders. The army sent her to Sir Patrick Dun’s Hospital in Dublin and there she obtained ‘excellent diplomas’ in midwifery and nursing. On her return to India she became matron to the regiment and to a military hospital. The Harolds left India after she suffered sunstroke; they migrated to New Zealand in 1883, settling in Ravens24\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nbourne, near Dunedin. There they ran the hotel and raised their family, with Susan Harold offering her midwifery skills to the small local community. She kept a register of the ‘cases of confinement’ she attended, and her notes for the years 1883 to 1889 survive. During that period she delivered fifty-nine babies, ranging from two to seventeen per year. Most of her clients were the wives of local tradesmen or labourers, and they clearly valued her skills, for many called her for a second or third birth. She described all of the labours as ‘natural’, with one exception: Mrs Gillas, a blacksmith’s wife, had a miscarriage in 1884. One baby was stillborn, but Harold recorded no complications in any of the mothers she attended. Susan Harold’s nursing skills also came in handy during local emergencies, and in 1897 the community presented her with an ornate illuminated address ‘in recognition of the many valuable gratuitous services rendered by her in cases of accidents during the past 14 years’.21 Mrs Marshall – possibly the thirty-eight-year-old Isabella Marshall who migrated from Scotland aboard the Jane Gifford in 1842 – advertised in the Auckland newspaper the Daily Southern Cross in 1843. She wished ‘to inform the Ladies of Auckland, that she has commenced practising as a Midwife in this district, and hopes that she may be found to merit a share of their patronage’. She was also able to add, ‘Mrs M. will be happy to [show] certificates from the Regius Professor of Midwifery of Glasgow College, of her having passed Examination as to ability.’22 Medical authorities in Scotland had been issuing such certificates to midwives since the eighteenth century, with the examination giving an indication of the midwife’s competence; women could also attend special lectures or receive training at one of the emerging maternity hospitals.23 Midwifery education was available in some English lying-in hospitals, too: like the early missionary midwives Catherine Leigh, Jane Woon and Marianne Williams, women attended these hospitals for a few weeks of practical training. Gradually certificates and diplomas issued by hospitals or the London Obstetrical Society took over from the old system of the bishop’s licence. Church authorities had been issuing licences to midwives since medieval times, but these had nothing to do with skills or competence. They were, rather, a safeguard against witchcraft: to obtain a bishop’s licence a midwife had to be in good standing with her community and swear that she would not use charms in her practice.24 Miss E. Ward, newly arrived from England, could boast prestigious modern qualifications when she advertised in Auckland in 1870. She was ‘a certificated Midwife and Monthly Nurse; trained in the F.N.W., King’s College Hospital, London, with first-class reference, of seven years’ practice’.25 The ‘F.N.W.’ was the Florence Nightingale Wing, established by the great nursing pioneer as a training school for midwives (it was later forced to close, like many lying-in institutions, due to outbreaks of puerperal fever).26\n\n25\n\nTaieri midwife Adelaide Hicks (1845–1930), photographed with her great granddaughter Milly Stewart in 1923. Courtesy of Ralph Lawrence\n\nBut most nineteenth-century midwives in New Zealand, as in Europe, had no formal training. Sophia Thomas, who migrated from London to Wellington with her husband and family in 1842, ‘somehow had acquired great skill’, wrote her granddaughter. Thomas, who later settled in Whanganui, assisted at least one Māori woman ‘in the throes of a difficult childbirth’ and ‘was often called upon to help women of her own race through difficult births. She knew how to correct a bad presentation and many a child owed its life to her.’27 Thomas may well have been more skilled than most midwives of the time but, like her, the majority had ‘somehow acquired’ their abilities through practical experience. Many uncertified midwives had children of their own and had learned the basic mechanics of their profession during their own birthing experiences. They might then build up their knowledge while helping other labouring women, perhaps at first with a more experienced midwife present and then on their own. Some, especially those in isolated or rural communities, had little choice but to pick up midwifery skills when called on for help by their neighbours. Ellen 26\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nClough migrated from Ireland to Canterbury in the 1860s, living in the Chatham Islands for about thirty years before returning to Christchurch. Her daughter remembered Clough, a mother of eleven, ‘often being called on to help when a neighbour was having a baby. The doctor of the day was unreliable, a bit of an alcoholic apparently, so the women tended to care for each other unless things got too complicated.’28\n\nThree of Adelaide Hicks’s nine children, outside the Mosgiel home where she took in midwifery clients. Courtesy of Ralph Lawrence\n\nSarah Higgins, another mother of eleven, migrated to Nelson as a child in the 1840s and after her marriage to a sawyer lived on various farms in the Waimea South district. When she reached her seventies Higgins recorded her reminiscences, recalling that when her daughters were old enough to help at home, she ‘went out nursing’. For twenty-six years she practised alongside the local doctor, Thomas Oldham, ‘then I went out doctoring myself’. Over 350 babies passed through her hands; she presumably developed her midwifery skills under Dr Oldham’s guidance. Like many colonial midwives she was known to her community as ‘Granny’, a reflection of the mature age of most of these women.29 Some midwives had a vocation and a desire to share their talents within the community; others were drawn to midwifery as a way to make a living. Sarah Higgins used her midwifery and nursing skills, along with her needlework skills, to supplement the family income; other colonial women did likewise. Janet Woolhouse lived on the West Coast around the turn of the century with a large family and a feckless husband who drank heavily and gave her insufficient money to support the household. Woolhouse, who was of mixed Ngāi Tahu, English\n\n27\n\nand Scottish descent, was therefore thrown on her own resources; she worked as a midwife and nurse and took in sewing to provide an income.30 For others, midwifery supplied the sole household income, with women taking up the profession because their breadwinner husband had died or left them. Joseph Vant, an English agricultural labourer, died aboard the migrant ship London in 1842, leaving his wife Susannah with a young family to support. When the ship arrived in Nelson, fellow migrants built the family a cottage on the land they had bought before leaving England. In the words of her great granddaughter, to earn a living, the thirty-two-year-old widow ‘went out delivering the colonists’ babies as they came. She was not originally a midwife but this was the only occupation at that time certain.’31 There are many such stories from the nineteenth century. Adelaide Hicks was a resourceful widow who became a much respected midwife in the Taieri district, near Dunedin. She migrated from London, first to one of the Australian colonies and then to New Zealand, as a young woman, working for some time as a stewardess on coastal ships. Her husband died after an accident in 1884, leaving her alone to raise a family of seven daughters and two sons, the youngest just a toddler. She moved from their bush home into Mosgiel and set up as a midwife; Hicks’ Maternity Home became a local institution. Her daughters helped Adelaide Hicks run her midwifery service and the youngest, Edith, took over when her mother retired.32 ‘COMFORTABLE ROOMS’ AVAILABLE For most nineteenth-century Pākehā women, childbirth took place at home; hospital birth was for those without financial or social support (see Chapter Three). Occasionally, though, women gave birth at the home of their midwife. Hicks’ Maternity Home was typical of the private institutions that would flourish in the first half of the twentieth century. It was very small: its earliest surviving records, from 1909, record ten women attended by Adelaide Hicks that year, and three of those she delivered in their own homes.33 In the nineteenth century her practice was probably more focused on home deliveries; most nineteenth-century midwives who took birthing women as boarders also attended ‘out’. The greatest demand for a live-in service came from women who lived in isolated rural locations. Typical of these was Jane Leov, who lived in the Rai Valley, over the range from Nelson (see frontispiece). In 1897 the nineteen-year-old travelled to Havelock to stay with Jane Pope for the birth of her first child. She was there for a month – over two weeks before her son Leonard was born, and another fortnight afterwards. Eighteen months later she returned for the birth of her second child, bringing young Leonard with her. Pope was clearly competent, later registering as a Class B midwife under the 1904 Midwives Act. But Jane Leov missed her husband badly. She kept in touch with him by letter, and as she 28\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nawaited the birth of her daughter she wrote: I feel very lonely tonight without you oh Charlie dear how I wish I was home with you …. little Lennie is asleep he has been so good today poor little dear it will be so nice when you have us home again. I’ll never leave home for Babies again. True to this vow, Leov’s next child was born at home.34 In 1871 Eunice Upton, who lived on a high country sheep station, went to Christchurch for the birth of her first child; this was a trip that involved forty miles by horse or carriage, then thirty miles by train. ‘I had a very nice place to stay at when I was ill in Christchurch, with a very good and kind nurse’, she wrote to her sisters-in-law (using ‘ill’ as a euphemism for late pregnancy). ‘Overton Cottage was the name of the place I stayed at, and belongs to Mrs Smallwood, who was my nurse.’ Like Jane Leov, she found it hard to be separated from her husband: ‘I was in Christchurch seven weeks, but it seemed many more to me being all that time without Everard.’ Timing a trip to town for a birth could be tricky. When Eunice Upton’s second baby was due, two years later, her husband arranged in advance for a buggy to fetch her for the long trip to Christchurch. Four days before the buggy arrived, she gave birth at home. Eunice wrote: I am very glad it all happened as it did, because I was here with Everard and Tich [her firstborn], and if I had gone to Christchurch I could not have had them with me, I was very weak and it was thinking about leaving Everard and Tich that brought it all about.35 Annie Hadfield had the misfortune to give birth en route to town. She lived in remote Awaroa, in Tasman Bay, where most of her previous children had been born. In 1891, when baby number nine was on the way, she decided to go to Nelson. Her previous birth had been difficult and she wanted to be closer to professional help. Her descendants tell the story: Annie planned to leave for Nelson on the steamer, which called twice a week, but she left it too late and when she realised the baby was imminent her husband [Harry] knew they could not take the risk of waiting. He and William [Harry’s brother] decided to take her to Riwaka in Harry’s yacht Ruby. On the way her labour started. The men had to pull for a safe anchorage in the lee of Adele Island where they made her as comfortable as they could. William rigged a sail over her while Harry did his best to comfort her and ease her pain. The baby was a little girl, delivered safe and well on the floor of the gently-rocking boat and quickly swaddled in the clothes Annie had prepared for her. After she had rested for a while Annie decided she and the baby were fit to return home and they pulled for Awaroa again 29\n\n…. The child was named Ruby Adele, after the boat she was born in and the island which had sheltered them.36\n\nElizabeth Cornish advertised her Dunedin lying-in home in the Oamaru and Gore papers. Mataura Ensign, 22 August 1899, Papers Past, National Library of New Zealand\n\nTo avoid incidents like this expectant mothers had to travel to town well before their babies were due, aggravating the extended separation from homes and families that so frustrated Jane Leov and Eunice Upton. For women who lived in such isolated locations it was, however, reassuring to have expert help at hand in case the birth did not go smoothly. And for busy wives and mothers a complete rest from household chores could be most welcome in the final stages of pregnancy. The ‘comfortable rooms’ offered to ‘ladies coming from town or country’ in 1875 by Mrs Boyle, a midwife in Freemans Bay, Auckland, must have seemed appealing.37 Another Freemans Bay midwife was Mrs Shaw. In 1865 she advertised that ‘Ladies residing in the country, and others requiring care and attendance during their confinement, can be accommodated, on moderate terms, at the house of an Experienced Midwife; a Medical Man always in attendance.’38 A number of the midwives offering accommodation worked, like Mrs Shaw, in conjunction with doctors. Elizabeth Cornish advertised her central Dunedin ‘nursing and lying-in home’ in Southland and North Otago papers in 1899, clearly aiming at rural customers.39 Elizabeth Cornish’s advertisement demonstrates another feature of nineteenth-century midwives: many did not confine their practice to delivering babies. Cornish offered general nursing services, while many community midwives willingly assisted in cases of illness as well as childbirth. Two of the midwives we have already met – Susan Harold and Adelaide Hicks – were\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nrenowned for their calm competence in dealing with accidental injuries. Another task traditionally assigned to midwives by many communities was the laying out of the dead.40 Catherine Haughay, a forty-five-year-old Irishwoman, arrived in Dunedin from Melbourne in 1860, along with her labourer husband and seven children. She advertised immediately in the local paper: ‘Mrs M. Haughay, Midwife and Nurse. References to the above can be given. Also washing and dressing done in the best style at very moderate charges.’41 ‘Washing and dressing’ referred, euphemistically, to the care of the dead. Midwives could see people into the world and out of it: they were experts in the intimacies of both birth and death, which were much more closely aligned in the Victorian era than they are today. The ‘handywoman’ who served a small community was in demand at times of birth, illness and death: only in more populated urban areas was there sufficient demand for a woman who had to earn a living to confine her work to the delivery of babies. The midwives practising in nineteenth-century New Zealand had a wide range of backgrounds and their competence also varied greatly. Many were highly skilled, but others, through lack of experience or simply from ignorance, were not. Sometimes, as will be seen in Chapter Seven, this had fatal consequences. A good midwife was a person of great value to her community. The role was a demanding one: it carried great responsibility and could mean travelling long distances in all weathers at a time when transport was, by modern standards, primitive. Midwives were often women of strong character, and spirited advocates for the women they attended; husbands and children could find them intimidating. A man born in the 1890s, who was raised by his aunt and uncle after being orphaned, recalled a Mosgiel midwife, Mrs Moyle: In her blue dress and long white apron she presented one of the crowning works of the Devil to our young minds. We believed that she deliberately made Aunt yell by hurting her … I realise now that she was well advanced in matters of hygiene for she was spotlessly clean. Indeed she always looked us over to see if we had washed behind our ears. Husband and children were banished outdoors, or, if it was night, to the stable, while a birth was in progress.42 This Outram family called on the Mosgiel midwife for help because the two local midwives – known by the Scottish term ‘howdie’ in that largely Scottish community – were either too far below or too far above them on the social scale. ‘The most proficient, Mrs John Drummond, was persona non grata in Uncle John’s household because of the local “pecking order”.’ The other local midwife ‘attended to the higher strata of local society’.43 Agnes Drummond’s husband, a waggoner, was renowned for his drinking and bad language and appeared regularly before the courts.44 This background may have barred her from some homes, but clearly working-class women, including those from the roughest of back31\n\ngrounds, could be very good midwives and probably had far more experience than women from more genteel families. Robert McLatchie, living in a remote part of the Catlins, South Otago, had mixed feelings about the local howdie, a Highland woman. She shared his wife Ethel’s room, turned him out into the lean-to, snored loudly and ate up their winter supply of bacon. But at one birth, when the labour progressed more quickly than expected, he was very grateful for her arrival. With what relief did I see the rusty black bonnet appear out of the night, its raindrops gleaming like an angel’s halo. I took her by the shoulders, propelled her into the bedroom and closed the door. The child was born before she had time to remove her wet bonnet. Reminiscing years later, McLatchie noted, ‘I am afraid we took these fine women for granted. Really they were angels of mercy, leaving their own families at the call of need, and trudging over miles of muddy roads to receive for their services a mere pittance, though all we could afford.’45 DOCTORS AS BIRTH ATTENDANTS Like many medical men of his generation, the missionary William Williams (see p.54) who assisted at so many mission births, received his medical training in England as apprentice to the local surgeon.46 There were three classes of doctor in early nineteenth-century Britain: apothecaries and surgeons both learned their trade on the job, while physicians trained in university medical schools. With the Medical Act of 1858 the British government took control of the registration of doctors, though a range of training methods continued. Most medical schools taught midwifery to their students, but it was possible to register as a medical practitioner without any education concerning childbirth: midwifery was not a compulsory subject for medical students until 1886 in England (1833 in Scotland). To compound matters, the upper echelons of the medical profession had little respect for the doctor who served as childbirth attendant: ‘midwifery is not a fit occupation for a gentleman’, the president of the Royal College of Physicians declared in 1827. It was not until 1929 that British obstetricians obtained their own elite specialist college.47 New Zealand’s own medical school, at the University of Otago, began in 1875 and taught a full medical course from 1883. That course included midwifery and gynaecology, taught by Dr Ferdinand Batchelor. As in other countries, though, it could be a struggle for medical students to find opportunities to complete the minimum nine deliveries required for medical registration: with most women giving birth at home, and often without a doctor, the medical school lacked easy access to birthing women.48 The terms obstetrics and obstetrician did not come into widespread use until 32\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nlate in the century, and a doctor who delivered babies was generally referred to as a man-midwife or accoucheur. There were very few specialists in obstetrics and for most doctors midwifery was one part, albeit a significant one, of a general medical practice. Historian Irvine Loudon, noting the rise in deliveries by doctors in eighteenth-century Britain, comments that midwifery was, for general practitioners, poorly paid but offered ‘job satisfaction’. It was also ‘the surest way to establish a practice’ and ‘the essence of the concept of the family doctor’.49\n\nLike many doctors, Henry Maunsell of Hokitika promoted his midwifery skills when advertising. West Coast Times, 25 August 1873, Papers Past, National Library of New Zealand\n\nIt is difficult to know how significant maternity cases were for New Zealand general practitioners, but the statistics for two doctors provide some evidence. Dr William Sealy migrated from England to Taranaki in 1854, later moving to Nelson. Following his death, a Nelson colleague published an analysis of Sealy’s midwifery cases from 1859 to 1885. He attended 2,589 labouring women, an average of close to two each week. Likewise, Dr Ernest Rawson of New Plymouth and Wellington attended 2,844 women in labour between 1877 and 1894, an average of three a week.50 Doctors advertising their services in newspapers – generally because they were new in town – sometimes made a point of mentioning their obstetrics skills. John Hooper advertised as ‘surgeon and accoucheur’ in Auckland in 1862, noting that he had previously been ‘House Surgeon and Resident Accoucheur’ at St George’s Hospital, London.51 Three doctors competing for patients in Wellington in 1854 advertised their skills in women’s health: Dr France was a ‘surgeon and accoucheur’, Dr Ralph had been surgeon to the West London Lying-in Institution for ten years and Dr Welch, from Somerset, was the author of The Married Woman’s Adviser and Young Mother’s Guide, along with A Familiar Treatise on Diseases of the Eye.52\n\n33\n\nNot every doctor liked attending births. In 1873 Robert Bakewell of Dunedin wrote to the Otago Provincial Secretary, suggesting a school for midwives be established as most currently practising in the town were ‘totally without proper education for their profession’. He complained about a case he had attended because the woman’s own doctor was ill and two others had refused to go: ‘I had to go to Mornington, spent a couple of hours in attending a perfectly simple case, which any old woman might have attended just as well as myself, and lost half my night’s rest.’53 Bakewell clearly resented having to attend a ‘simple’ delivery; he was perhaps accustomed to being called only when things were not going well. Certainly many families only called on a doctor for assistance when complications arose or labour was unduly long. There were various influences on a woman’s choice of childbirth attendant, with social class, financial status and geographical location all important. In rural districts, and in the early decades of colonisation, doctors were few and far between and transport was slow; it could be difficult for a doctor to get to a woman in time to be present for a delivery. The Wingates lived on a remote Wairarapa sheep station, but when Mrs Wingate expected the birth of her first child she stayed in Greytown, supposedly closer to help. When she went into labour her husband went to fetch a nurse, and a friend went for the nearest doctor: … there was only one in the whole district, and his practice extended for seventy miles in some directions. Unfortunately, on this night he had been called to Masterton …. The night was wet and dark, and the friend, who did not know the country, failed to recognise the beginnings of the capital of the Wairarapa, and rode right through it. To his surprise he found himself on the banks of a river, which did not figure in his instructions, and he was completely at a loss to know where he was. He therefore dismounted, and spent the night sitting on a fence beside the swollen river. Daylight at last came and showed him the habitations. Meanwhile, ‘the little stranger had arrived even before the father had returned with the nurse. The mother was quite alone in the house, but she survived the ordeal, and the child was born strong and well.’ Having successfully survived this delivery without aid, Mrs Wingate evidently decided she could do without a doctor on future occasions. ‘As the years passed a family of six gathered round her, all born without the aid of a doctor, and sometimes, very nearly without a nurse, as at the first birth.’54 Lizzie Heath, a recent migrant to the Kaipara, wrote to her sister in 1868 about the arrangements she had made for her forthcoming delivery: in this part of the world, she commented, ‘people never think of such a thing as needing a doctor’. She arranged for a nurse and a midwife to attend her, but had such a short labour that she gave birth before the midwife could arrive. Her husband wrote, with obvious relief: 34\n\nCHAPTER TWO Lying In Pākehā Birth Ways\n\nI have been very anxious on our dear Lizzie’s [account], as having been accustomed to all the English fuss and nonsense of Doctor, etc. etc., that she would feel very nervous and perhaps have a very long and painful time, but really everything has been so much better than we could expect.55 Even in more populated districts a doctor could be hard to come by. Alice Chitty, who migrated from Tipperary, Ireland, to the Waikato in 1871, recalled in 1936 that she had learned, through experience, how to care for the sick or injured: There was always a doctor in Hamilton, but never until very recent years were there sufficient physicians to meet the needs of the growing town. There was a midwife, a Mrs Lees, in the district, but again, she might have been needed in two places at the same time. Roads were either unformed or were mere tracks, and travel was slow.56 Occasionally a doctor could be easier to access than a midwife. Jessie Campbell, who had migrated with her husband from Scotland to Petone in 1841, wrote in a letter to her sister soon after the birth of her fifth child: ‘My medical attendant Dr Stokes was very attentive and skilful. I had no midwife, my servant and Mrs Butler were the only attendants how much I would have given to have had my old friends Crighton and Coley.’ Two years later, after shifting to Whanganui, she reported to her mother the birth of another son: Dr Wilson was my medical attendant (midwives are not known here) my kind friend Mrs Wilson did everything for me that you could have done, she came every day to dress the ba"
