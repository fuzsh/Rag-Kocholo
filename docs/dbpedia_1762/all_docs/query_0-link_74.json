Hilder and published by the Birkenhead Borough Council, 1969. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED -4. ! ' m 1970 n EMQRIM 1 . 3*621 jMTTLE more than 100 years ago what is now Birkenhead was almost as wild and ^ untamed as it must have been 1 0,000 years before. True, there were settlements of indigenous Maoris, just as there must have been settlements of another race before them, but development, so-called modern civilisation, as it has been known in Europe and the Far East for 10 centuries or more, was virtually unknown in this forest, fern, or tussock-covered land when Queen Victoria came to the throne. So, almost within living memory, we have watched a relatively small, compact area in a primeval environment develop into a thriving, bustling 20th Century borough. There is nothing unique about this but too often in such cases what has been seen almost at first hand has not been recorded and has eventually been forgotten. It was for this reason that early in 1965 the then Mayor, Mr. A. C. Crocombe, and borough councillors of Birkenhead decided a history of the borough should be compiled, edited and pub- lished “before it was too late”, before those who were to provide the historical details, who were to be asked to recall what happened or what their fathers had told them had happened before and since the borough was formed, had passed from us for ever. Good Choice Having decided what it wanted, the Council chose two of the most suitable people in the borough to carry out the careful and serious research required for such a project: Mrs. Muriel Fisher, of Kauri Road, and Mr. W. J. “Bill” Hilder of Beachaven. Mrs. Fisher, botanist and writer who specia- lises in indigenous flora, is the wife of a member of one of the oldest Birkenhead families. She has studied history and botany at both Victoria and Auckland universities, and painstaking collation of known facts is her way. Mr. Hilder has been a leading figure in the borough, particularly at Beachaven and Birkdale, for nearly 45 years. Despite his 80-odd years, he is blessed with an unusually accurate and versa- tile memory, particularly for names and dates. He knows or is known by most of the older people in the borough and to thousands of the younger generations. He has served on the council and has always been closely associated with local affairs and local body people. A book of this kind is rather like an iceberg. The final, visible result is only a fraction of the size of what lies beneath the surface, of the vast quantity of research, compilation and compaction on which it floats. To produce this vital foundation has been the work of Mrs. Fisher and Mr. Hilder. It has re- quired perseverance and perception, and a sense of vocation. This they have supplied in full measure. Mrs. Fisher and Mr. Hilder, I know, would wish me, on their behalf, to thank all those who have helped them in their research: Government depart- ments, local bodies, clubs and associations, many Birkenhead people and, in particular, Mr. Tom Walsh of Takapuna, an authority on the history of the North Shore. It is inevitable in a work of this kind that there will be gaps and misunderstandings, a date wrong here perhaps, an initial left out there. The chapters in this book are based on inform- ation culled from numerous sources. Inaccuracies may have crept in but certainly not intentionally. If anyone believes or knows that someone or something has been left out, the compilers and editor apologise sincerely and ask that the pub- lishers be informed so that in any future publica- tion of this sort, the correct information can be included. What may seem important and worthy of being remembered today was all too often re- garded as nothing unusual when it happened, so that little or nothing was recorded and specific details were soon forgotten. However, a great deal of trouble has been taken to try to fill in the gaps and check any possible inaccuracies. Though not always successful the result has been very rewarding to those responsible for its publication, the Mayor, Mr. B. L. Stanley, the members of the Council (particularly the members of the Civic Amenities Committee), the Town Clerk, Mr. P. H. Kortegast, and myself who accepted the fascinating task of putting it all together for the printer. We hope it will prove just as rewarding and satisfying to those who have waited so patiently for its appearance in book form. Geoffrey Soutar August, 1969. 2 contents B. L.

T HE Maori people have a proverb: *“Womcn and land are the reason men die.” Nine words only, yet nothing could describe so simply yet so forcefully the spirit that pervaded, a little more than a century ago, the land that was to become the borough of Birkenhead. At least it can be said of the Pakeha that he did not destroy the Maori in and around Birken- head. As history records, and in a later chapter the story will be told, Birkenhead was part of a widespread battleground throughout which the Maori came near to destroying himself. It was from the ashes of the ravished Birken- head and Waitemata tribal lands that the Pakeha built the orchards and gardens that supplied the young City of Auckland with much of its fruit and vegetables. In more recent times, since 1945, the most noticeable feature of the Birkenhead scene, is the rapid and total change from what was virtually a large and luscious strawberry patch to the streets of family homes — and young family homes at that — of one of the fastest growing and most popular of Auckland City’s dormitory suburbs. In fact even today, re-translated into a more modem idiom: “A family and land is the reason why men strive,” the old proverb would be just as apt even though a vastly different kind of people to either the old time, warring Maori or the fruit growing pioneer have laid the imprint of their striving on this sheltered and lovely borough. IN PRE-PAKEHA times, what was later to become Birkenhead was part of one of the most important and traditional fields of battle among Maori tribes. This aspect of Birkenhead’s history, this inclusion of the Birkenhead territory in the history of New Zealand, is not as well known as it should be. Perhaps that it all happened before written history is some excuse. The earliest Pakeha settlers, many of whom lived in nikau whares, had to walk along a track *“He wahine he whenua, i mate ai te tangata.” One of the fine kauri pine trees in Kauri Park. Standing at the base is the 1968 chairman of the Civic Amenities Com- mittee, Mr. A. M. Nola. 5 In the beginning from Birkenhead to Devonport to get fresh sup- plies or transact any business. If they wished to go to Auckland, they walked to Northcote (Stokes Point as it was then known), and crossed by rowing boat to the young Auckland city. Those were the days when people going to town wore an old pair of boots, carried their good ones, and changed at the wharf. Tracks and roads in the winter were a sea of mud. In those days, water had to be carried from streams to thatched roofed dwellings. It was impossible to visit friends at night. The roads were too bad and lanterns scarce — meet- ings were held either in the afternoons or on moonlight nights. Little of this Birkenhead, the Birkenhead of 85 to 100 years ago, can be seen today. Sur- prisingly — and fortunately — a few remnants of an even earlier Birkenhead are preserved in the three scenic reserves within the borough’s boundaries. It is not too difficult to walk through these reserves — Kauri Glen (24 acres), Kauri Park (20 acres) or Le Roy’s Bush (14 acres) — and obtain a mental picture of the primeval land the Maori lived in and fought over for hundreds of years before the arrival of the European. More difficult but more intriguing, is to stand on Little Shoal Bay beach, take note of the hills and swamps and the cliff formation, and go back in imagination not hundreds, nor thousands, but millions of years. Far bark in time THE geological history of Auckland extends far back into geological time. Rock, over 200 million years old forms the islands of Waiheke and Motutapu. On the North Shore, these ancient rocks are buried deeply under layers of much younger rock about 30 million years old. These beds of yellow and grey mudstones and sand- stones were compressed under a deep sea and now form our most common rocks. During the period of their formation volcanoes erupted in the Wai- takere area, producing mudflows and lahars, which became interbedded with the sandstones. One bed of this hard resistant rock, called Par- nell grit, can be seen near Birkenhead beach. To the north, near Albany and Kaukapakapa, conglomerates consisting of pebbles of ancient rock, some similar to granite, were also formed. Birkenhead's Lake Pupuke quarry, above which was the pump house. The quarry was sold in 1967. About 15 million years ago, a mountain build- ing period commenced which laid out the general outlines of New Zealand today. In the Auckland district these movements ap- peared as block faulting where some sections of the land were pushed up, and other parts were lowered. Raised areas include the Hunua Hills and Coromandel Peninsula, and lowered areas include the Manukau lowlands, southern Kaipara Harbour and the Firth of Thames. The Auckland area was not lowered enough for the soft sandstones to be covered by younger sedi- ments, or raised high enough for them to be eroded away. The Great Ice Age, really four ice ages with intervals of milder climate, exerted a great influ- ence on parts of the world far away from the ice caps. The first ice age began about 1 million years ago. The climate became gradually colder and vast amounts of water became tied up in the great glaciers, so much that in places sea level fell 300 to 400 feet. Thus, four times, as the glaciers grew, sea level fell and, as the glaciers melted, sea level rose. When sea level rose, the valleys were flooded by the sea and filled with mud and sand. 6 Whenever sea level remained constant for a time, waves cut back the cliffs to make gently sloping rock platforms along the shore. AT ONE stage, when sea level was 250 feet above the present day level, flats were scarred by streams and the sea. These flats can be seen today as the main ridges and gullies of Birkenhead and other parts of the North Shore. By the time sea level had dropped to about 100 feet above present day sea level, submerged valleys were filled with pumice sands, silt and peat. Much of the Shoal Bay — Takapuna area con- sists of such beds. During the last ice age sea level fell to more than 300 feet below today’s level. The Waitemata Harbour and the Hauraki Gulf were dry land. The Waitemata River had its channel cut down to 120 feet below today’s sea level off North Head, and tributary streams cut deep valleys so they could join the main river smoothly. — Mrs. H. Nicholson. The Maori stoiy TO obtain an overall picture of Maori life on the shores of the Upper Waitemata Harbour, it is necessary to overlook today’s borough boun- daries. Very little seems to have been recorded on this subject, and if it were not for the late George Graham’s articles in which he made an effort to piece together fragments of legendary history, there would have been little indeed to indicate what life was like before the advent of the Pakeha and his bush felling. Let us put the clock back some 200 to 300 years and try to visualise the Birkenhead scene. The bush would have extended to the water’s edge. Papa rock would be largely hidden in those days, so thorough was nature’s ornamentation. One can picture what a magnificent sight the Pohutukawas would have been in mid-summer, and ferns would have grown luxuriantly in shel- tered positions in the steep coastal gullies. There would have been giant Kauri trees against the sky-line — not the exotic pines there today — even though, most probably, fire had destroyed some of the beautiful bush during the many inter- tribal wars. UNCEASING tribal conflicts marked the long history of the Auckland isthmus and in the latter part of the 18th Century, the area was abandoned. No tribe was able to remain strong enough to withstand the attacks which were made upon this much fought-for piece of land. What is now known as Northcote Point, was in those days a pallisaded and entrenched, fortified village, known as Onewa, and a little further up the harbour at the spot known as the Needle’s Eye (near today’s Birkenhead wharf) there was a small Maori settlement. The Ngati-tai tribe occupied most of the area now known as the Waitemata County and it was frequently raided by the Kaipara tribe (Ngati- whatua). Inter-tribal warfare was almost continuous and virtually amounted to a repetition of attacks and captures. An important area to the old-time Maori was what is now known as Kauri Point. It is the most conspicuous of the many headlands in the Upper Waitemata Harbour. In those days it was called Te Matarae-a-mana, which translated means Mana’s Brow or Headland. It was presided over by a Chief called Te Mana. Some 20 years before Captain Cook’s first visit to New Zealand, according to a Maori historian, “The Maori village was a kind of Maori Lowestoff whence the canoe fleets went fishing the waters of the Upper Waitemata. In season large hauls of shark and other fish in the Maori diet were caught and dried for winter use. “At those times the population of Te Matarae and other fishing villages in the vicinity was con- siderably increased by visiting parties from sur- rounding districts. In fact, so famous were the shark fisheries near Matarae, that canoe fleets came from as far away as Thames.” Still further up the harbour towards Riverhead, one cannot fail to notice a prominent landmark known locally as the Devil’s Back. Its natural situation and height, bounded on the one side by the main waterway, the other by Hellyers Creek, made it an easily defended stronghold. What could be described as a major war stemmed from the actions of a well-known chief at the time named Kiwi. He was a brother-in-law of Te Mana the chief at Te Matarae (Kauri Point). All was peaceful till Kiwi visited the Kaipara tribe. There he suffered some real or imaginary offence at the hands of the Kaipara people. Intent on revenge, he killed some of his host’s people and for good measure murdered some Kaipara women who were gathering shellfish at the mouth of the Te Whau stream. 7 This so enraged the Kaipara tribe that they in- vaded the pas and fortified villages on the Waite- mata, by both war canoe and overland from Riverhead. Kiwi was killed and the tribes along the shores of the Waitemata scattered. By the end of the 18th century, the remnants of the tribes had again settled at their respective P as — namely, Onewa, Te Matarae-a-mana and Tauhinu (The Devil’s Back). For about 20 years there was peace. Then, un- fortunately for the remaining members of the once-powerful tribes on the shores of the Waite- mata, Hone Heke returned from England with firearms and a strong desire to become famous. He immediately set out to right some wrong he considered had been inflicted on his tribe by the people of the Waitemata tribes. Large numbers of these people were killed, but a few managed to take refuge in the recesses of the forests which covered the district. Gradually the influence of the missionaries took effect and by the 1830s, tribes which had hitherto been enemies made peace. Those who escaped Hone’s firearms returned from their hiding places and ancestral homes were occupied again. Te Matarae (Kauri Point) was again the scene of a Maori community which lived peacefully, reviving a reputation for fishing in the fruitful waters of the Upper Waitemata until 1844 when the area was sold to the Pakeha government and the once important ancestral home of Te Matarae became a deserted village, visited only by Pakeha picnickers and yachtsmen. Just before the signing of the Treaty of Wai- tangi, the remnants of another tribe had returned to Tauhinu, but a few years later they too, dis- persed when their land was sold to the pakeha. This story was repeated at Onewa which had been again inhabited by a few of the Ngati-tai tribe. It was here that the last chieftain Heteraka Takapuna resided, until the Point was sold to the government in 1841. The Pakeha . . . /'''APTAIN James Cook, R.N., while making and . Parting important geographical discoveries in the South Pacific did not chart that part of the coast which includes the Waitemata Harbour. In November, 1769, however, Captain Cook sailed up the Firth of Thames and steered to- wards Cape Rodney. Waiheke Island and the other islands of the Gulf would have been on his left and so one could assume the course that he took prevented him from seeing the Waitemata. By the end of the 18th Century sealers and whalers had found their way to New Zealand and the felling of the Kauri forests had begun. Early in the 19th Century the missionaries had found plenty with which to occupy themselves in this new land. From their headquarters in the Bay of Islands they explored the country, mainly on foot, through virgin bush. One of the best known missionaries, the Rev. Samuel Marsden is credited with being the first white man to sail up the Waitemata. It is recorded that he was requested by the Governor of New South Wales to accompany an expedition sent to Coromandel to search for kauri spars. Marsden was selected to accompany the ex- pedition, which went by H.M.S. Dromedary and H.M. Storeship Coromandel, because of his knowledge of the Maoris and their respect for him. THE TWO ships left the Bay of Islands on 7th June, 1820. The return trip from Coromandel was made in a sailing launch in charge of a Mr. Anderson who was accompanied by a Government “Timber Purveyor”, a Mr. Ewels. The route from Thames was up the Waiheke Channel and the night was spent in the shelter of one of the islands in the area. The following account is taken from the docu- ments relating to this interesting journey — July 26th, 1820: — “This morning we weighed anchor and sailed up the Wyeteematta (Waitemata) with a strong, fair breeze. The Wyeteematta is a large river in some places 5-6 miles wide and runs direct to- wards the west side of New Zealand. We anchored about 5 o’clock in the evening near the shore, tying the launch with a rope to a tree. There were some fine spars, but not long enough for first-rate men-of-war.” Marsden relates that early the next morning a canoe manned by natives was paddled over to the launch. The party included a native chief named Te Kawau and, fortunately for the travel- lers, the Chief and his party were friendly dis- posed towards them. 8 Marsden then inquired of Te Kawau, if it were possible to reach the Kaipara in a day; the Chief replied in the affirmative and offered to show him the route. Marsden gratefully accepted the offer and accompanied by Mr. Ewels, Government Timber Purveyor, they left the launch and embarked in the canoe in which there were 13 natives. Beyond Pitoitoi or Riverhead, as it is now known, the party went 6-8 miles further up the river and after a hard day’s journey spent the night at a native village — this was probably on the shores of the Kaipara Harbour. When Marsden had sufficiently acquainted him- self with this western shore of New Zealand, he then requested Te Kawau to return him to the launch which would carry him back to Coro- mandel. Although the Chief was not anxious to leave so soon, he complied with Marsden’s request and in very unpleasant conditions the party set out in squally wintry weather. The journey down the Waitemata on the 30th July, 1820, was far from pleasant and as the day wore on the wind increased in strength. The launch was sighted and although the young men who manned the canoe paddled with re- newed vigour, the conditions worsened and it was resolved to go on shore and walk to Panmure where the launch was anchored. In Marsden’s own words “Although the natives told us it was too far to walk, we resolved to try our strength and succeeded in reaching Panmure that evening, where we met the launch and took up our lodgings for the night, not without feelings of pleasure and gratitude.” The year 1820 marks the beginning of events leading to the European settlement of the Wai- temata. Twenty-one years later Governor Hobson officially purchased from the Maoris the whole of the North Shore as far north as Mahurangi on the east to the Kaipara Portage on the west. The following is taken from “THE STORY OF DEVONPORT and THE OLD NORTH SHORE” by T. Walsh. THE LAND comprising the Borough of Devonport was a part of a big land purchase made by the Governor (Captain Hobson) in 1840-41, about 12 months after the pur- chase of the site of the City of Auckland. The Mahurangi Block, the area purchased, extended from Takapuna (that is Devon- port) to Te Arai on the east coast, and to the central ridge that commencing to the head of the Waitemata, runs northward, forming the backbone of the northern part of the island: the total area of land dealt with was 9,500 acres. As there were several native tribes concerned in the ownership the purchase transactions extended over a num- ber of years, but the ownership by the Crown was regarded as settled, and in 1844 the first areas between Northcote and the Lake were offered for auction. The first deed with the Maori owners was made in 1841, the final in 1854 (certain small land interests are still held by the Maoris beyond the Puhoi). THE FOLLOWING translations of the deeds are self-explanatory: — “Dated April 13, 1841. “Ngatipaoa Interests. “The chief and people of Ngatipaoa, Ngatimaru, Ngatitiamahera, Ngatiwha- naunga ceded and disposed of these places of ours (Mahurangi and Omaha) and the places lying within the boundaries described to Mr. Clarks, Protector of Aborigines, on behalf of the Queen of England her heirs or some man or woman who may be chosen by England to be King or Queen for ever.

(Continued at the bottom of Page 10) 9 The Pioneers . . . DEFORE the European settlement of the Birken- head district, seamen from visiting sailing ships used to row up the harbour along Hellyers Creek into the little bush-fringed inlet known as “The Lagoon” to collect fresh water from a waterfall there. This was before all the giant kauris were cut down in the area. It has been recorded that in 1841 a Mr. Hellyer lived on the bank of the creek which now bears his name. He brewed beer which no doubt was a great incentive to those early seamen who rowed up the harbour, presumably for fresh water. The beer was sold at £4/10/- per hogshead. Mr. Henry Hawkins was one of the first settlers in the district. He established an orchard near Soldiers Bay in the late 1840s or early 50s. About the turn of the century, his son lived in Hauraki Street. More recently his grandson kept a fruit shop which was just about opposite the present Birkenhead Borough Council office. Another early settler was Mr. Philip Callan who in 1853 bought 76 acres in the Glenfield- Eskdale Road area. In 1861 he gave three acres to Bishop Pompallier. This is now the Roman Catholic cemetery. About 1856, a Captain de Jersey Grut farmed where the Chelsea sugar refinery now is. Some of the other early Crown Grants were: Sixty-seven acres which embraced the area from Rangitira Road - Beach Road and Soldiers Bay, sold to William Brown in 1845 for £135; (Continued from Page 9) “Dated at Waitemata.

ABSENT OWNERS It is significant that the most eagerly sought land was that which had a sea frontage. It should be noted however that the owner of the various lots that were sold did not necessarily settle here. William Smellie Grahame, for example, was a merchant from Sydney who bought much land in the Hokianga District as well as 115 acres round what is now Verrans Corner - Waipa Street area. (A photostat of the early deed appears in this book.) One interesting fact is that in 1844-45 (about the time of the Crown Grants) introduced thistle had become so widespread that the Government requested new settlers to take action. Some 20 years later, a notice appeared in the newspaper calling for tenders for eradicating the thistles! Without doubt, the first pioneer settlers, most of whom came from the north to escape Hone Heke's war, set themselves a hard task. Those who chose Birkenhead probably had a harder struggle than those who settled elsewhere on the Shore. Birkenhead is hilly, broken country quite devoid of rich soil. In fact, much of it is white pipe clay with a hard ironstone pan — typical spent gum- lands — with most of the nourishment drained from it by the giant kauris which grew here over the centuries. Settlement was slow — very slow in comparison with other parts of the Shore. Devonport, or Flagstaff as it was originally called, had a resident signalman in 1842. but not until eight years later were farms offered for sale. Names which will ever be associated with Devon- port, Duder (the signalman) and Allison (after- wards the founder of the ferry company) were two of the purchasers of the original farms. Unlike Birkenhead, however, Devonport and • Takapuna land had not been covered in giant kauris, but tea-tree and flax, the latter particularly along the sea front from what is now Hauraki Road to the Okura River. Much of Takapuna’s soil is volcanic and fertile. Good crops of wheat, maize and oats were grown. Also model dairy farms sprang up from Barry's Point to around Pupuke Lake. 10 NINE ON ROLL In spite of the fertility of the soil and the fact that the land itself was not difficult to work, settlement was fairly slow, there being only nine people eligible to vote in Takapuna in 1870. Even 20 years later, there were only three houses along the waterfront to Milford. To obtain an insight into conditions prevailing in and around Auckland in its infancy, one has only to turn to the newspapers of the times. The earliest newspaper in Auckland was “The New Zealander” and was published every Satur- day. It cost 6d. per copy. After a close perusal of these papers in the year 1845, one fact stands out significantly — in the Hokianga district. Hone Heke was making life very unpleasant and the settlers lived in fear and dread of this great Maori warrior. On Saturday. August 30, 1845, “The New Zea- lander” reported: “The proximity of this port (Hokianga) on the western coast to the seat of warfare, exclu- sive of its being a great mart for Kauri spars and Kauri gum, calls for particular attention. The establishment of some force at Hokianga, either naval or military, would be productive of beneficial effect in suppressing inclination of those natives who would want to join Heke.” A study of the Crown Grants about this time reveals that a number of those who took up land in the Birkenhead district came from Hokianga. The first mention of any settlement on the North Shore appeared in the issue of December 20, 1845, of “The New Zealander”. Then, as now, there were burglaries; and so it was reported that the industrious settlers in the district of Takapuna “suffer much annoyance as well as loss of property from continual depreda- tion of their pigs, poultry and vegetables”. GOOD CROPS Reading on further, one is told the year 1846 was a good one for the farmers round Auckland — “Clovers are astonishing in their growth — Crops of potatoes have been abundant and of excellent quality”. On May 30, 1846, “The New Zealander” dis- cusses the scarcity of labour and suggests: “With every facility to obtain the necessities and com- forts of life exceedingly cheap and in great Sketch by Mrs. Rosalie Logan of a nikau whare. This was a rain proof shelter made from the nikau palm leaves. The pioneers learned how to build them from the Maori. Many pioneer babies were born in a larger version of this whare. 11 abundance, the Waitemata district is one of the most favourable locations for the labouring classes of all trades and description.” The price of various commodities in the mid- 1840s: Eggs 1/- a dozen, beef 6d. a pound, milk 4d. a quart, a 2-pound loaf was 5d. Horses were £20 to £40 — a lot of money in those days — and cows £8 to £10. The first auction sale of North Shore land was on September 18, 1843, when sections 1-70 at Northcote - Birkenhead and the west side of Shoal Bay were offered for £2 per acre, 10% deposit and balance in one month. t First publican’s licence on the North Shore was secured by J. O’Brien in 1843. The old hotel must have been somewhere behind Northcote and more over towards Barry’s Point. The licence set out that the inn had two sleeping rooms, but no stable and the proprietor had one boat. The earliest industry on the North Shore was brickmaking at Stanley Bay and at Northcote. A Mr. Hammond operated one of the brick- works in 1844 and until 1900 this part of the Shore was known as Brick Bay. In 1848 an advertisement appeared in “The New Zealander” to the effect that Clark’s Soap and Candle Factory (probably at Stoke’s Point) was offering soap at 24/- per cwt. and candles 5d. per lb. In the 1850s Stoke’s Point was much the more important place on the North Shore, being the southern terminus of the road north. When a permanent ferry service to the Shore was introduced in 1854, apparently it was not of much interest to either of the papers published in Auckland at the time, for neither made any men- tion of the fact. The earliest census returns did not show the figures for the population of the North Shore separate from those of Auckland. A summary records: In 1851 the total population was 9,430 — 3,214 could not read In 1855 the total population was 11,919 — 4,056 could not read In 1857 the total population was 15.518 — 3.984 could not read (Figures do not include Maoris or members of military units.) A landing stage was erected by Mr. P. Callan at Stoke’s Point for £328 in the early 1850s. For the year ending January 30, 1858, the number of passengers that used the North Shore ferries was 6,046 persons. Under the amendment of the Licensing Act, 1858, trust licences were granted to: R. Barry, Takapuna Hotel, Barry’s Point; Philip Callan, North Auckland Hotel, Stoke’s Point; and James Holmes, Flagstaff. NEAR LANDINGS These first hotels were situated at the respective ferry landings. In the early 1860s, Maurice Kelly, who owned the Wade Hotel, used to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day by organising horse races. This proved very popular and attracted settlers from far and near. In 1863 a grant was made for roads from “East Coast to Great North Road”. By 1 864, farming land on the North Shore was selling at £8 per acre. After the war with Hone Heke and others in the North ended, the Government gave an area of land between Takapuna and Devonport to Patu- one, with fishing rights to all his people, as a recognition of his services. Europeans have since gradually acquired ownership of all the grant. Patuone died in 1872. Anniversary Day in 1864 was a big day at Takapuna, for not only was there horse-racing on the beach (£20 first prize), but there were rowing races held on Lake Pupuke (with a boat for first prize). Ten whaleboats and seven watermen’s boats competed. In the evening a ball was held in a marquee, tickets for which cost 5/-. In 1860 the newspaper agents for the North Shore were P. Heath, Shoal Bay; and Mr. Hellyer, Lucas Creek. In 1860 when H.M.S. Brisk was lying off Stanley Point, a sailor using a chain and line caught a 20 ft. shark. A newspaper reported the monster was so large that “the sailor was able to insert his body into its mouth- — after it was killed!” Licences to kill game were first issued in 1868. Captain Wynyard and A. H. Golfings, North Shore, holding the first licences issued in the district. The last of the old-time Maoris in Takapuna held a large block of land from Shoal Bay to Takapuna beach. As late as 1895, six of the “old timers” lived in whares surrounded by garden plots and could be seen sitting on the roadside watching passers-by. Some of those who passed would toss over a plug of tobacco, but Mr. (later Sir Henry) Brett was their favourite, for he threw many a cigar to them. 12 Northcote’s claim to fame in the early days was that it was the gate to the north and the nearest point to Auckland. Northcote has the distinction of having the first auction of land on the North Shore and this took place on September 18, 1843. Northcote also had the first school apart from a small private one at Takapuna. Like her neigh- bour, Birkenhead, Northcote became a great strawberry-growing region. The earliest settlers had the enormous task of clearing the bush before building themselves some sort of dwelling. It was not everybody who could afford to build a wooden house to begin with and it was not unusual for them to construct a bush shanty with sod walls and chimney and a raupo or nilcau thatched roof. The forbears of many of today’s Birkenhead people were bom in such places. As they cleared the land, the settlers often came across worthwhile deposits of kauri gum, the sale of which enabled them to buy much-needed manure for the impoverished soil. The first wooden houses were made of pit-sawn kauri timber with split shingle roofs and large open fireplaces over which iron racks were placed. On the racks were hooks on which to hang the handles of large iron kettles. Camp ovens and iron-legged pots were also in vogue and a stack , of wood was always kept standing nearby. Bacon was smoked in the chimney piece. Water was sometimes obtained from a well, but usually it was carried from the nearby creek and in the winter wooden barrels caught the roof water from the spouting. In those days there was no bath or bathroom and on Saturday nights the fire was stoked up while kerosene tins of water were placed on hooks hanging from the iron bar which went from one end of the fireplace to the other. HIP BATH Many a settler’s wife was proud of her bath which was a wooden hogshead beer barrel, cut neatly in half and painted. In addition to building their homes, the settlers had the tremendous task of breaking in the land, most of which was by then covered with second growth tea-tree scrub. Before ploughing could commence, it was necessary to clear the scrub. This was a winter chore when it was cut with a slasher and left to dry when it would be burnt off in the summer. Often the ploughing was done by bullocks. A man would follow the plough with spade and hanging bag and pick up the gum as it was ploughed out. Often the women and children would help, following the plough, eager to pick up any gum that came to the surface. The smaller nuts of gum were eagerly gathered up by the children. The proceeds of this some- times gave them pocket money. Gum scraping with a knife was a job for parents on a wet day or at night. In the early 1860s, the Maori wars were a dis- turbing factor in the minds of Auckland people. In August, 1863, a public meeting of all North Shore residents was held to consider the best means of providing for the defence of the district. By October, 1863, the settlers of Devonport had organised a Volunteer Corps to do night patrol along the northern shores of the harbour. There was, however, one comforting factor: the Maori chief, Patuone, who had been converted to Christianity by the Methodists, remained a faith- ful friend to the Colonists all his life. The follow- ing extract from an editorial in the New Zealand Herald in December, 1863, alludes to the contrast between the wintry conditions many of the settlers were used to at Yuletime in Europe and the sum- mer season here. But at least one thing remained the same: the spirit of goodwill. The article continued thus — “It has been for some years an interesting spectacle to see the Maori Chief of the North Shore, Patuone, gather his friends and acquain- tances around him and offer the same cordial welcome to all — rich and poor, Maori and Pakeha.” BOROUGH NAMED The year 1863 was an important one in the history of Birkenhead. On June 23, Samuel Coch- rane, an Agent, Broker and Auctioneer, registered this district as “Birkenhead” in the office of Rid- ings and Dowden, Auckland. He named it Birken- head because it reminded him of his home town ‘being across the water as Birkenhead is from Liverpool’. The Birkenhead settlers discovered that the land was not conducive to dairy farming, although ad- mittedly there have been several noteworthy farms in the district. It would, however, grow fruit — and grow fruit abundantly it has done for over half a century. In the early 1870s W. F. Hammond described the scene on the southern side of Hellyers Creek where, he said, there was a large Maori settlement. Whares were dotted about on cultivated plots reaching from where the Beach Haven wharf now is to the Chief’s whare on the hill at the source of the creek. About 1875 the River Plate Co. came into existence. This Company intended to connect Birkenhead by tramway with other boroughs on 13 the Shore, but the idea was abandoned during the depression of the 1880s. Incidentally, that is how Tramway Road, Beach Haven, got its name, for it would have been the terminus if the scheme had materialised. From the time the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was established at Chelsea in the early 1880s, Birkenhead’s development speeded up and it is safe to say that the majority of the persons employed at the works were residents of the area. This growth soon resulted in Birkenhead being proclaimed a Borough in 1887. The Cyclopaedia of N.Z. (1901) says, “Birken- head is a large residential suburb situated about 3 miles to the north-west of Auckland, across the Waitemata Harbour. It has an area of 2,697 acres and contains 278 ratable properties owned by 252 ratepayers. The population of the Borough is 1,087 persons.” As there was no hard metal in the district, the Council employed scows to bring this necessary material from Rangitoto Island for the roads. Later the Council made use of the cinders from the Chelsea Refinery and so every road in the Borough had its coating of “Sugar Works ash”. At this time on the 1901 Electors’ Roll for the Borough of Birkenhead are many names that are familiar today. For example: Walter and Isabella Bagot, Henry Beere, Lawrence and Annabella Clow, Charles and Annie Chambers, John and Mary Day, James and Sarah Dacre, Frank and Jane Fisher, Emily and Francis Fowler, George and William Goodall, David and Annie Heron, Charles Harken, Joshua and John Hadfield, Joseph and Annie Jenkinson, Edwin and Emma Jessop, James le Vesque, Richard Messenger, Thomas and William Metcalf, George and Annie Mayall, William McCullough, Isaac Newton, Frederick and Sarah Pugh, Abraham Roberts, Stephen Rountree, Thos. and Laura Shepherd, David and Frances Swindail, James Speedy, E. F. Tizard, William and George Wallace. The Gum Diggers T HE following advertisement appeared in “The New Zealander” one day in March, 1845: — KAURI GUM Tenders will be received by the undersigned until 1st April for 20 tons best quality kauri gum to be substantially packed in native baskets and delivered within 3 months from this date. Cash on delivery. Signed: John Montifiore Auckland. On mentioning kauri gum, one immediately thinks of the gumfields of Northland and it is not generally known that in the early days, the North Shore contained much gum — some of very good quality. In the past the major portion of the area now known as the North Shore must have been a vast kauri forest. Even at the time of the early settlers’ arrival the kauri was a feature of the landscape. Unfortunately, however, the same methods were applied there as in the north. Only a small pro- portion of the best timber was removed and utilised, most of it was burnt on the spot. FIRES A well-known statesman of the last century was reported as saying “a swagger would burn down a forest to light his pipe”. This may seem an exaggeration, though it is true that many of the finest kauri forests in the country have been des- troyed by such acts of carelessness. Some of the older people of Birkenhead can remember their parents speaking of the huge forest fires which blazed for weeks on end “over the back of Birkenhead”. This would have been in the 1870s. Wherever there had been a kauri forest, there will be fossil gum and, with the exception of the volcanic land around Mount Victoria and Taka- puna, an area including Stanley Point, Northcote, Birkenhead and all land to the north had varying quantities of gum. With the coming of the early settlers and the opening of the kauri gum markets, Maoris also took to gum digging and it was a common sight to see many of the menfolk making for the gum- fields which lay west of the Wairau Creek. At the end of the day, they would be seen returning with full pikaus (canvas bag with straps which was carried like a haversack), sometimes calling at the settlers’ homes where they often bought farm produce such as butter and eggs, and perhaps were given a cup of tea and a batch of scones made by the settlers’ wives. In return, the settlers would be given some fresh fish or mussels. A number of the gumdiggers were elderly men, for most of the younger ones were engaged in bush felling. In those days, there was no “Age benefit” or Social Security and those who were too indepen- dent to accept charity could usually make money from the gumfields. Many of the men who resorted to digging for gum were from the city and down on their luck. FAMILY HOME In many cases their wives and families went with them and lived in shanties built of sod walls and thatched with nikau and raupo. 14 The shanties were about 8 feet by 10 feet and at one end a boxed-in bed frame was built. This was filled with a springy native fern which the Maoris called Mangemange. The settlers named it ‘Bushmen’s Mattress’. Botanically, it is known as Lygodium articulatum. With a good fire burn- ing in the open fireplace, the huts could be quite snug and cosy. When a new “chum” came on the gumfields, it was a regular procedure for him to approach the storekeeper who would set him up with the neces- saries, a tent, spade, spear and gum knife, camp utensils and a week’s “tucker”. It was a gentle- man’s agreement by which the digger was to supply all gum to the storekeeper till the debt was paid off and trade nowhere else. Camps became established at the head of shel- tered gullies where plenty of fresh water was handy and as near as possible to the road so that the gum dealer could bring stores and buy gum. If possible, it was an advantage to be near the coast so that the diggers could catch fish to supple- ment their food supply. A Mr. Wheeler was the last person to obtain a permit to dig kauri gum around Verrans Corner. This was during the depression of the early 1930s. Towards the middle of the 1880s, when there was a more regular ferry service to Birkenhead and Northcote, dozens of men would come over every morning to spend the day on the gumfields, within easy walking distance. Some returned to- wards late afternoon, while others remained in the district and would return on Saturday morning when they took their gum to a dealer in the City. In the last quarter of the 19th Century, several gum dealers established themselves on the North Shore. One such was at the corner of Sunset Road and Glenfield Road where a small store was kept by David Heron. Further out, near Albany, Messrs. Stephenson and Phillips set themselves up in business. Another ran a hotel in conjunction with gumdealing and the other had a general store and bakery. With large camps in the Lucas Creek and Snapper Rock area, these enterprising dealers did a good trade. Alexander Stephenson settled in the district in about 1850. QUIET PLACE An Albany pioneer in the early 1890s later described Albany as “a quiet little village situated in a valley surrounded by hills. The narrow, clay road divided at the hall, where there was a huge finger post with Northcote on one of its arms and Devonport on the other. Both roads were clay and full of ruts made by wheels of bullock drays as they hauled out the huge kauri logs. Most of the ground was full of great kauri stumps which had to be removed before ploughing.” She described the population at this period — “The majority of the inhabitants were Maoris who lived in their own little settlement by a fresh-water creek. Their whares were made of tea-tree and raupo with sods of earth. It was a common sight to see parties of Maoris making for the gumfields. The women folk always wore shawls round their shoulders and these served a double purpose, for as well as carrying their baby in the shawl, they could also put provisions in it. It was not unusual for them to carry a little pet pig as well, for apparently they made great pets of their pigs and many a Wahine (Maori woman) has shown me with obvious pride a tiny piglet nesting in her shawl.” Further north also, of course, was a great area for gumdiggers about this time. Areas known as the Horse Shoe Bush from which timber was bullock-hauled to Riverhead, and all the area now known as Dairy Flat to the Wade (Silverdale) was heavily forested in those days. MILFORD A CENTRE It may come as a surprise to some to learn that Milford was in the centre of a gumdigging area and the industry was carried on over all the land now known as the East Coast Bays. In fact, in a gully near Campbell’s Bay there existed a gum- diggers’ camp till as late as 1910. Joe Sheriff was the dealer on this part of the shore and regu- larly he would take his horse and trap to the camps on Saturday, laden with provisions, returning with a load of gum. His store was in Milford and the name Sheriff’s Hill is still referred to today. The gum was graded, best quality sold for 2/6 a pound, nuts 5d. and dust 3d. a pound. As far as can be ascertained, this was the price prevailing about the turn of the century. Often one would get pieces of clear, transparent gum called speci- men gum. This was really something special and would demand high prices as a curio or ornament. The largest piece of gum found in the Birkdale district weighed just over 20 pounds. This was found about the time of the First World War. Until almost recent times, the old gumdiggers’ track over the Devil’s Back through the back of Birkdale over to Chelsea was discernable. 15 T HE changing boundaries of local body adminis- trative areas led to Birkenhead becoming a borough. At one point part of a county, part of a highway district, and part of a roads board. In the early 1840’s, when the Auckland Pro- vincial Government bought large tracts of North Shore land, scattered pockets of settlers were soon established. To begin with, the administration of these was the responsibility of the provincial government. To relieve this body of some of its work and to enable the settlers to look after their own affairs, two acts were passed by the central government in 1871: The Highway Boards Empowering Act, and the Highways Act. This legislation allowed any group of settlements to join and be proclaimed a Highways District administered by a board with the power to rate the settlers in the district to pay for the formation and maintenance of their roads. When the Waitemata County was formed in 1876 it included all the North Shore. Although some highway districts, which were regarded as part of the county were included, the administra- tion of local roads remained independent of county control. A further step was taken in 1882 by the passing of the Roads Board Act which permitted an increase in the number of road boards and their later separation from the county. Birkenhead was one of these and originally included Northcote and Greenhithe. Northcote became a separate board in 1884 and Greenhithe was separated from Birkenhead in 1886, leaving the Birkenhead Roads Board boundaries some- what the same as the borough’s are today. The final step was taken on April 11, 1888, when, acting on a petition from the people of the board’s district, the Birkenhead Roads Board was proclaimed a borough. The following is a copy of the Gazette notice of April 12, 1888 (No. 24). •Proclamation Whereas by “The Municipal Corporations Act, 1886” the Governor is empowered, by Proclamation, to declare any portion of the Colony of New Zealand to be a Borough under the said Act from and after a date to be named in such Proclamation.

W HEN men and women made their way across half the world to settle in New Zealand, their first and greatest need was for land, cleared land on which to grow food. The preservation of native bush, of some of the finest and oldest trees in the world, had little place in their fight for survival. Like thousands of acres of fine forest in other parts of New Zealand during most of last century, the land that was to become Birkenhead — largely kauri forest — was cleared in the easiest way pos- sible — by fire. Slowly, the land was brought under cultivation. Bush and fern gave way to orchards, strawberry patches, a vineyard or two, and paddocks for horses or cows. At first people lived and raised families in nikau whares and bush shanties. Then, as the land was developed and the settlers established themselves, these gave way to timber cottages. By 1 890, nikau whares were almost a thing of the past. Small farms, market gardens and orchards, and cottages for homes were the accepted thing. The following extracts from Samuel Vaile’s cata- logue of houses and property for sale or lease, dated July, 1891, shows what had happened to the forests: LAND VALUES BIRKENHEAD (Cheap Property): — Cottage of 3 rooms; commands a splendid view. 5 acres, 3 Birkenhead looking across to the Auckland Harbour Bridge roods, 33 perches of land, all fenced, 4 acres in grass, 1 acre strawberries; shelter trees in front and on two sides.

Price £1800 or offer. It was shortly before the sale quoted that the most important event in the history of Birkenhead, an event that did more to mould the future of the area than any happening before or since, took place. In 1884, the Colonial Sugar Company decided to establish its New Zealand refining plant at Birkenhead and built what has been known ever since as the Chelsea sugar works. It was this large-scale industrial project that was to provide jobs for those Birkenhead people who could not be accommodated on the land. And, in the course of time, Chelsea has given — and still gives — work to thousands. 18 In those early days, though, the establishment of the Chelsea works and the small village the works provided for its key workers gave tremen- dous impetus to development in the district. It led, undoubtedly, to the Birkenhead people’s awareness of their parochial identity and the sub- sequent formation of the district into a borough with its own mayor and councillors to administer local affairs. GREAT PROBLEMS By modern standards the affairs of the Birken- head Borough Council some 80 years ago may seem trifling but in those days of isolated home- steads, cart tracks for roads, no street lights, fer- ries that had to be sailed or rowed across the harbour, and neither telephones nor an electric power — nor even gas — supply, the smallest problem was of great moment. By scanning the minutes of Council meetings over the years one can obtain a clear and reveal- ing picture of a borough and its people developing from a scattered community of farmlets and far- mers or gardeners — which is how it all began — to one of the largest and most progressive dormitory suburbs of Auckland. In those days, as excerpts from the minutes of 1890 to 1900 tell us, most of the Council’s troub- les concerned such matters as cattle grazing on the roads — not by the side of but on — which reached such proportions by the turn of the cen- tury that the Council referred the matter to the police. Be it noted that “the police” was a single con- stable who lived in Northcote and on foot, though occasionally on horseback, roamed all of North- cote and Birkenhead as his territory. Considerable Council debate was occasioned over what appeared to be a increase of the num- ber of dogs seen in the borough. As a result, applications for the position of “Inspector of Dog Collars” were invited. The successful applicant was a Mr. Alex Haire whose first efforts revealed that there were 63 dogs in the borough. The condition of roads was mentioned fre- quently and the Works Committee was continually taking remedial measures: that is to say, arrang- ing for men to spread crushed shell from the beaches and sugar works ash to try to improve the carriageways. The committee was often instructed to make “summer roads” where required. In winter, no doubt, it was beyond the committee’s resources to deal with the knee deep mud. It was not until 12 years after the borough was formed that the borough council felt it could dare 1890-1 902 to ask its ratepayers to finance a town hall or council chamber. Until then the Council had been only one of many organisations to rent a small office for its part-time town clerk. It booked an afternoon or two each month in a church hall for Council meetings. As it was, the first discussion on a suitable site for a town hall seems to have been in March, 1900. The subject was brought up for discussion at regular intervals — for nearly six years. In June, 1900, a Mr. A. L. White was appoin- ted Town Clerk in place of Mr. Thomas Seaman. The Town Clerk was paid £30 a year, and the Council office was made “open for business on the Thursday afternoon, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., near- est the full-moon.” MOONLAMP This is a significant detail to the history re- searcher. Because of the state of the roads and the isolation of the houses, the people involved needed a full moon to help them see their way home after council meetings. Despite this isolation of the people’s homes, council business was evidently increasing, for in April, 1901, the borough was permitted to in- crease its number of councillors to nine, and three months later began holding fortnightly meetings instead of monthly. One small item in the minutes, later in the year, indicates clearly that these men who were dealing mainly with grazing cattle on roads, sugar works ash and the need for more substantial office and meeting place, did indeed have a human side to their natures. The mayor an- nounced to his colleagues, with some pride, that the Royal Humane Society’s medal had been awarded to a Birkenhead man, a Mr. G. Rogers, for rescuing Mr. Joshua Hadfield from drowning at Chelsea. Reading through the minutes of this early 20th century era, one notices the economy of words in which certain facts are put. The following are examples: “Hadfield’s Hollow to Bagot’s Hill — scrub to be cleared.” “Ruts in the roads to be filled with tea-tree and earth.” “Amount available for road maintenance, £62.19.9.” One resident was threatened with prosecution “if he persists in driving his dray on the foot- path.” In March, 1902, there was fear of an outbreak 19 1902- 1910 of bubonic plague and, in this connection, the Council resolved that all care should be taken in the borough including arranging with the Chelsea Sugar Company to allow rats to be destroyed in its furnace. Threepence per head was paid for all rats delivered there. January 18, 1906, was an important date, for the Council met for the first time in new Council Chambers. Before proceeding with the ordinary business, Cr. H. M. Shepherd presented to the borough, through the Mayor, a handsome Mayoral chair, a ponderous piece of furniture — still used as such today. Great satisfaction was expressed by the Coun- cil at being able to meet in a building to be used exclusively for borough business and a tribute was paid to Cr. Fred Souster, who had been the architect and Mr. F. A. Pitt, the builder. The Council Chambers at that time faced Hauraki Street (now Hinemoa Street) but was later shifted back to the site it occupied until its demolition in 1967. During 1906, a number of new roads were formed in the district — Roseberry Avenue and Tizard Road to mention two. PEOPLE SPREAD Also, in that year the Council was pressing the Postmaster-General for a new post office at High- bury. The move of the centre of population away Mr. Thomas Seaman, the first Town Clerk, for £30 a year. Charles Edward Button Esq., Birkenhead's first Mayor, 1888-1901. from the Birkenhead wharf waterfront had be- gun. The only post office at that time, early in 1 906 that is, was at the wharf in Verran’s Store. Half a century later the name was spoken of again, when Verran’s Corner, four miles to the north- west, had become a new centre of Birkenhead population. Probably the most important event in 1906 was the introduction of gas to the district, another sign of progress and development. Nine street lamps were erected at first but more were put up two years later. The positioning of the nine gives some indication of the places where people were to be found: Opposite Verran’s Store at the wharf, at the top of the steep hill of “Shaw’s Bend”, Crescent Road, Robertson’s Crescent, Telephone Road, the end of Swindail’s Hollow, Hawkins’ Bend, Zion Hill corner, and Cookson’s Corner. By the time the borough had come of age, it was — for those days — a virile and thriving local body area. Towards the end of 1907 the Council had be- gun to concentrate on work at Highbury Corner. In 1908 the new Birkenhead Post Office was opened and the Council asked for its telegraph ex- change to be open from 7 a.m. during the sum- mer months “for the convenience of fruit growers.” Such was the increase in heavy traffic up the Hinemoa hill by 1910 that the Council re- quested the Auckland Harbour Board to erect a 20 View of Hinemoa Street, looking down from Highbury, about 1906 to 1910. The \"new\" Council Chambers is on the right. A closeup (right) of the building on its original site. stand for “leader horses” under the cliff at Bir- kenhead wharf. A water trough was also placed in position by the wharf about this time. Towards the end of 1910 Messrs Oldham Bros, and William Goodall were operating buses in the district. The service was hourly between Highbury and the wharf, the first leaving Highbury at 8.10 a.m. and the last at 10.15 p.m., except Saturday when it was 1 1.20 p.m. The fare. Wharf to High- bury was 3d., beyond 6d. After 7 p.m. all fares 6d. It was in 1911 that the Takapuna Tramway Company began to negotiate with the Birkenhead Borough Council to run trams to Birkenhead, but the plan came to nothing. An extract from the Council estimates of 1912 shows: general rates £1,480; shingle, shell, chips (for roads) £80; tar for footpaths £80; drivers' wages £132. 12s.; and upkeep of horses £110. Good news for gardeners in 1912, for they could obtain horse manure from the borough council stables, “for the taking.” Borough council drivers must have taken a pride in their horses for, in 1913, they were grant- ed permission to show them at the Waitemata Show on the understanding that any prizes won were “to be divided among the drivers”. In 1913, a weekly “Sanitary Service” began and the person who undertook the task was paid £1 per night, on the understanding that he supplied his own team of horses. Hours, 10 p.m. — 6 a.m. In the same year, 1913, Constable McGilp re- tired and the Borough Council requested the Police Department to appoint a mounted con- 21 The Council of 1906: Left to right.

The application was declined. WORLD WAR I When the Great War broke out in 1914 sur- prisingly little appears in the Council minutes. The one mention that comes to mind is a brief report of the Auckland Provincial Belgium Relief Fund. In 1915 there was a Birkenhead Patriotic Club which organised a Farewell Ball at the Forester’s Hall. Also in that year, it was resolved to erect a “Board of Honour of Residents now on Active Service.” This was prepared by a Mr. Warner and displayed in a case on the wharf. As time went on, one reads of the activities of the Birkenhead Ladies’ Patriotic League which raised funds for equipment for the Y.M.C.A. “at the front”. They also had a book-bin installed in front of the Council Chambers. In 1916, the Birkenhead Beautifying Associa- tion was formed. One of its main objects was to carry out improvements on the waterfront. Mrs. A. M. Miekle presented an iron seat which was placed about 200 yards up from the wharf. In 1916, the Government announced its inten- tion to introduce opossums. The Birkenhead Borough Council sent a strong letter of protest. The Council was supported by Mr. Levesque, who knew what pests they had become in Gipps- land and anticipated the pest these animals would be in New Zealand. What Spartans the early borough councillors must have been for in 1917 Cr. E. G .Skeates raised a point that there was no heating device in the Council Chambers and he felt the situation should be rectified. The first Anzac Day was not commemorated in the borough owing to short notice and the in- tervention of the Easter holidays. In 1917, however, Anzac Day was held on April 23. The principal speaker was the Rev. H. A. Sharp. Other speakers included the Hon. George Fowlds and Mr. C. H. Poole, M.P. Anzac Day has been commemorated in the borough ever since, and until the opening of the Memorial Park in 1958, the service was held at the Civic Reserve, outside the Borough Council Offices at Highbury. In the event of wet weather, the service was held in the Forester’s Hall op- posite, afterwards known as the Kiwi Picture Theatre. In November, 1918, came the good news that an armistice had been signed between the Allies and Germany. The Mayor, Mr. J. C. McPhail, 1919 - 1923 when addressing the Council, said he hoped satis- factory peace terms would be arranged, so as to prevent a repetition of the suffering and horrors of the previous four and a half years. Shortly after the signing of the armistice, the devastating influenza epidemic broke out in New Zealand, On November 20, 1918, a special meet- ing was called to consider what had and could be done. A tribute was paid to the voluntary work- ers for an emergency hospital had been establish- ed (at the school) and public inhalation chambers provided. Motor cars were placed at the service of the workers, food was supplied and assistance rendered where required. Seven days later, at another meeting of the Borough Council, the Mayor reported that the district was practically clear of the trouble. There had been 13 deaths in the borough from the epidemic. At the meeting it was placed on record that Mr. McPhail had done his utmost to relieve distress and “he had touched the hearts of the people by the whole-hearted manner in which he had set aside his own private work and affairs, and devoted his time to ministering to people and relieving distress.” During the early part of 1919, there had been socials in the district to welcome home the returned soldiers. The Council then organised peace celebrations which took place in the borough in July. The Council Chambers, the shops and private dwellings on the main roads were decor- ated. On Sunday, July 20, a united service was held in the Zion Hill Hall which borough coun- cillors, members of Friendly Societies, Scouts, Senior Cadets and returned soldiers attended. Monday was a day for the children, who were provided with entertainment. “Great credit was due to the band which considerably helped pro- ceedings,” the council minutes recorded. It was in 1920 that the borough's first regular refuse collection was begun. On the face of it, the introduction of such a service seems trivial. In fact it was another sign of Birkenhead’s develop- ment. There are, even today, many settlements in New Zealand which do not have rubbish col- lected at all. In March, 1921, the Birkenhead Progressive League was formed. Mr. J. W. Court was ap- pointed President. Mr. A Turner and Mr. Darlow, Snr., vice-presidents. Committee: Messrs P. E. Ross, T. Smith, H. Campbell, L. Gilpin, P. Hay- ward, E. Taylor, R. Hayman, R. McDonald, J. Brook, E. Lanigan, F. H. Woodhouse. A. Bartlett and G. Goodall. 23 Highbury Corner received considerable atten- tion in 1921 and £750 was set aside to finance the cost of forming the four streets at the junction. Today it might cost ten times that amount. Towards the end of that year, hawthorn was declared a noxious weed. Gorse and blackberry had been classed in that category some 20 years previously. In 1923, Constable Beddek received the Coun- cil’s congratulations on the way he collected suffi- cient evidence to arrest and convict a criminal at Birkdale. The sum of £600 was spent on forming three roads in the Beach Haven Estate in 1924 — the roads being Pohutukawa and Kowhai Avenues (£200) and Tui Crescent (£400). Good news for the permanent employees of the Council who had given continuous service for 12 months, for from 1925 onwards, they were to be granted one week’s leave on full pay. From the mid-1920s, repeated requests were made to the Post and Telegraph Department to install automatic telephones. Also about this time, there was a case of com- petition between Blue Star Motor Service Ltd. and the Marine Suburbs Bus Company. The latter company was granted a licence “because it had given proof of its ability to provide a satisfactory service which met with the approval of residents.” Incidentally, this was the pioneer bus company at Birkenhead and had commenced operations in 1914. Residents of Birkenhead, however, were not at all satisfied with the decision of the No. 1 Licen- sing Authority in not granting a licence to the Blue Star Motor Service Company. Public meetings were held and many letters of protest written to the Press over a period of months. WIRED FOR POWER An innovation of considerable importance in the borough’s accelerating development took place at the end of 1926. The borough was wired for electric power. An impressive civic function to celebrate the introduction of electricity was held outside the Borough Council Chambers during the evening of December 23. Mrs. E. C. Walton, wife of Birken- head’s representative on the Waitemata Electric Power Board, switched on the current to the modified street lamps after many speakers had addressed a large crowd from the bandstand. The Mayor, Mr. E. G. Skeates, presided and announced that the borough’s 22 gas street lamps were being replaced with 100 electric lamps of 1 00 candle power each, about twice that of the gas lamps, but at little extra cost. 1923 - 1927 It was a great occasion and it ended in style with cheers for the electric power board, cheers for the Mayor and borough council, and the Birkenhead Municipal Band playing the National Anthem. The introduction of electric power to the borough seemed to signify an end to the old ways and the beginning of a new era. THE NEW WAY For it was about this time, 1926 - 1927, that the old methods which had served the Birkenhead settlers and their families so well began to give way to the demands of a new, post-war way of life. In January, 1927, for instance, the widespread use of sugar works ash for surfacing roads and footpaths was mentioned for almost the last time. The minutes record: “The track leading to Island Bay wharf is nearing completion. Tram- way, Lancaster, Salisbury, Eskdale, Vermont, Vic- toria and Hutton roads will be ‘ashed’ before winter.” It was at this time, too, almost 10 years after the Great War had ended, that a memorial to Birkenhead men who had fallen, took shape at last. The Memorial was unveiled at the Civic Reserve on April 24, 1927. The programme included speeches by the Mayor, Mr. E. G. Skeates, Mr. A. Harris, M.P., the Revs. H. H. Bedford and J. H. Allan, Mr. J. H. McNish who represented the R.S.A., and Mr. F. Finch, Town Clerk. The Last Post was sounded by Sergeant C. Patten and the Borough Band headed a procession comprising returned servicemen, senior Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and brownies. The pro- cession marched from the Post Office to the reserve for the memorial service. At the close of 1927, “The Auckland Star” reported a number of burglaries at Birkdale “where many residents are at present reaping a good harvest from a prolific growth in their straw- berry acres”. On another page, the Star reported: “When the season is on and the carefully mani- cured citizen toys with his saucer of strawberries and cream, maybe he will give a passing thought to the slave of the spade whose hands are not manicured. “Take, for instance, the dinkum digger of Birk- dale (a place destined to become the health resort of the North Island on account of its magnificent air and its incomparable beauty), who with his own hands has dug every inch of two acres and a half. 25 “If he had put in half an hour leaping hurdles better than someone else, he might have got a silver cup or a free trip to the south, but the toiling speck on the hillside, watching the brown ribbon grow under his busy spade, merely looks at the weather and prays Allah to give the strawberries sun. “He is the Man with the hoe, the Bloke with the spade, the Cove with a parcel of poison on his back and a spray nozzle in his hand. The mere sight of the bale of straw requisite for the multi- tudinous plants would appal the stoutest suburb- anite. By the time the strawberry man reaps his cheque, he should know every plant and call it by its pet name. “Funny thing about him is that although the elements have kicked him hard ever since he put in his first plant, he is cheerful. A man who plies a spade like the dinkum digger of Birkdale hasn't time to achieve a liver.” In September, 1927, a preliminary discussion by the Borough Council on a sewerage scheme for the borough took place. It was also during this period that the North Shore boroughs dis- cussed plans for a destructor for the disposal of rubbish. Birkenhead Borough Council, however, decided to disclaim liability for any expenditure incurred in the construction of a refuse destructor for North Shore boroughs. Even Legal action was discussed. In the spring of the year, a publicity movement for the sole purpose of exploiting trans-harbour suburbs was formed. It was hoped to attract 100.000 visitors during the summer months. Galas and excursions would be arranged, it was decided. The “Star” in November, 1927, reported that there was to be a “North Shore Week-end Pro- gramme” with half-rate excursions on the vehicu- lar ferries on Saturday and Sunday, November 19 and 20. The “Star” added: “As the strawberries will then be in the first flush, car owners may have an opportunity to seeing how these delicious fruits really grow. One Birkdale grower has a farm with 160.000 plants. A map may be obtained on request at the ferry offices showing routes to Birkenhead, Birkdale and Beach Haven, as well as other places of interest on the North Shore.” An event of a more personal nature took place at the end of the year to brighten borough council affairs. MAYORAL WEDDING It was in 1927 that the Mayor, Mr. E. G. Skeates, married an Australian lady in Sydney. On their return to the borough, a very pleasant gather- ing in honour of the newly weds was held at the 1927 - 1929 “Gables”, the home of Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Camp- bell. Afternoon tea was served on the verandah and the Birkenhead Band provided a programme of musical selections. For some months the council had discussed the desirability of building swimming baths at Hine- moa Park and constructing boat lockers near the Birkenhead Wharf. Eventually, it was decided to hold a poll on these matters and a proposal to extend the water supply reticulation and to replace with four-inch mains the smaller existing water mains in various parts of the borough. The “Star” of June 29, 1928, reports that of the three issues voted upon, one was carried. The successful proposal was for £5,230 for an im- proved water supply reticulation. In mid- 1928, the Council discussed buying the property, at Highbury Corner, of the late H. M. Shepherd as it would make an ideal site for a town hall. The proposal was defeated. As 1928 drew to a close, pressure was still being brought to bear on the Postmaster-General for the installation of an automatic telephone system. Finally, the matter was referred to the Prime Minister, Mr. J. G. Coates. Also about this time, the Council authorised improvements to Hinemoa Park. A bandstand, designed by the Borough Engineer, Mr. Frank Finch, which was to cost £100, and upper and lower entrances costing £23 and £30 respectively were approved. The park was officially opened by the Mayor, Mr. E. G. Skeates, on December 23, 1928. The year closed with the time-honoured cele- brations, but two were of special importance to the people of Birkenhead. The first was when the Mayor, Mr. Skeates, entertained borough councillors and their wives at a function at which he announced he would not be seeking re-election as Mayor of Birkenhead. He had decided, he said, to leave with Mrs. Skeates and his son Eric Skeates on the S.S. Marama on February 15 for England. He said he would apply to the borough council for leave of absence for the balance of his mayoral term. He concluded by paying a tribute to Mr. A. Hadfield, the deputy mayor, for the loyal and helpful way he had helped him during his four years of office. On behalf of Mrs. Skeates and himself, Mr. Skeates handed Mr. Hadfield a silver entree dish, suitably inscribed “as a memento of their associa- tion and a mark of his gratitude.” The other function, held on December 26, was 27 1929 - 1930 a gathering of Chelsea employees at the Forester’s Hall, when 23 members of the staff with contin- uous service at Chelsea ranging from 25 years to 46 years were present. Mr. John R. McPhail, who presided by virtue of having the longest service at Chelsea of those present, explained that Mr. W. B. Woolley, who had worked at Piermont, Sydney, had been some few months longer in the company’s service. He mentioned that Mr. George Day, who was un- avoidably absent, was the oldest employee. HARBOUR BRIDGE MOOTED A perusal of newspapers of the mid- 1920s to 1929 reveals a proposal for a Harbour Bridge. Sir James Gunson was a strong advocate and led many preliminary talks. Eventually the Gov- ernment suggested setting up a committee of engineers and an early investigation as to when and where borings should commence. From the middle of 1929, the papers were full of proposals as to how the bridge should be built. The possibility of a tunnel to\" the North Shore was also considered. One correspondent to the “Star” wrote “That Harbour Bridge — is it needed? Autoplanes will soon be here!” After many deliberations lasting over months, The Auckland Star reported with big headlines: “PREMATURE — HARBOUR \" BRIDGE PROPOSAL. \"Time for erection will not arrive in less than twenty years. Daytime ferry services adequate.” As the population of the borough grew, the services that had been accepted by the previous generation were found to be inadequate, particu- larly the water supply. That is why we hear, in 1929, of “great dis- satisfaction with the water supply from Lake Pupuke.” There was even talk of augmenting the supply by damming the Wairau Stream. Since the Wairau Valley has now become an industrial area and the stream receives some of the effluent from the factory buildings, it was fortunate for posterity that the scheme came to nothing. This was the year of local body elections and we find that the Birkenhead roll totalled 2,463 people. Of these, 1 ,450 went to the polling booths, which is a healthy proportion bearing in mind the paucity of transport and the poor condition of the roads at that time. For the mayorality, there was a lower poll, but a close contest resulted between Mr. J. P. McPhail and the previous deputy mayor, Mr. A. Hadfield, the man who had been left as acting mayor by Mr. Skeates. Mr. McPhail was successful with 514 votes to 419. The year 1929, in retrospect, was an interesting year. It was the year before the great depression of the 1930s, and the old adage of “coming events cast their shadows before them” could well have been applied. Indeed, the shadow was evident to many people and was to curb many progressive borough council efforts. For instance, an extract from the “Sun” news- paper of June 20, 1929, reads: “A deputation from the Birkdale Branch of the Women’s Institute waited on the borough council in connection with extra street lights at Birkdale. After hearing the deputation, the Mayor, Mr. McPhail, explained that the cost of street lighting in the district had gone up from £200 to £400 and it was a case of finance.” Another extract from the same paper and the same date: “In reply to a request for a public telephone box at Verrans Corner, the district engineer of the P. & T. replied that in view of the fact that a substantial loss is to be expected from an installation at the point under review, it is not possible to accede to the request.” The “Auckland Star” dated July 18, 1929, refers to “Unemployment Relief” which was under discussion at a Birkenhead Council meeting: — “The Works Committee reported in respect to the grant of £30 from the Poppy Day Fund, and that the proposed works had been submitted to the Public Works Department, and if the council would vote an equal amount in order to obtain the Government subsidy of £30, there would be £90 in all. The committee -suggested making a footpath and water channel in Puriri Avenue, painting fences and clearing reservoir site of scrub.” FIRE BRIGADE At a Council meeting at the end of July a bold proposal was made to hold a Queen Carnival to raise funds for fire fighting equipment. In December, 1929, it was decided that a Birkenhead ex-servicemen’s Association should be formed. A provisional committee was set up comprising Messrs. W. C. Neech, F. Tothill, A. Fraser, A. White, J. Davies and W. S. Garrett, with T. Dale as treasurer and J. W. Canty as secretary. Towards the end of 1929 one more sign that the importance of the borough was recognised in Central Government circles came from the Director of Dental Hygiene. He announced that Birkenhead’s request for a dental nurse had been granted. As a result, a dental clinic was opened at 28 Birkenhead School and Miss T. P. Mills was appointed Nurse-in-charge. Much was made then of the borough’s first dental nurse, a positon that is now taken for granted. The New Year began with the usual list of problems, not the least of which was overcrowded buses. There were numerous cases of buses, licensed to carry 27 passengers, crammed with 50 or more. Another repeated demand from people of Birkenhead was for a better cross-harbour service. In particular, as people wrote to newspapers, “the present ferry service is unable to cope with the vehicular traffic”. If it points to nothing else, this complaint suggests that by 1930, Birkenhead’s roads were beginning to improve from the clay and sugar works ash era. This was at a time, incidentally, when in Germany the famed auto-bahn, the wide, straight concrete high speed motorways were being built. Although a direct approach to the Postmaster- General for automatic telephones had been made at the end of 1929 — and had again been turned down — the numerous representations which had been made to the Post and Telegraph Department during the previous decade looked as if they were at last going to bear fruit. For, on May 29, a start was made to lay submarine cables across the harbour. Each of the new cables, it was reported, carried 150 wires “and it is expected they will provide for all the subscribers in the Northcote-Birkenhead areas for a number of years”. From the mid 1930’s news items in the press mostly concern unemployment subsidies. In November of that year, the Mayor, Mr. McPhail 1930 - 1931 announced that permission had been given to borrow £2,700 without a poll for football field construction “for the relief of unemployed!” About this time the Council minutes recorded that experimental re-construction work by the concrete penetration method being carried out on the Birkenhead-Albany main highway. In December, 1930, the Council sought per- mission from the Auckland Harbour Board to erect a temporary shark-proof fence at Hinemoa Park to provide safe swimming facilities for school children. Permission was granted, but the council deferred the matter on account of lack of finance. At a meeting of the Council in March, 1931, the Mayor reported that 124 men were now engaged at Birkenhead on unemployed relief works. NEW POST OFFICE Also about this time the Council asked the Post and Telegraph Department to erect a new Post Office at Highbury. This took four years to become a reality. The poor vehicular ferry service to Birkenhead was still a bone-of-contention. It is interesting to note that the last boat left Birkenhead at 4.45 p.m. This was the year of a 10% wage reduction which, in the case of Birkenhead Borough Council employees would amount to an annual saving of £325. Also, although the hospital levy was £195 lower, the Council had new liabilities which more A view of Beach Haven wharf and across the harbour to Hobsonville in the Sunder- land flying boat days. 29 1931 - 1932 than absorbed these savings. Most of these were brought about by the need for providing relief work. Interest charges on the £2,700 unemployment loan absorbed £307, and for the first time the borough had to pay a levy of £363 to the newly- constituted North Shore Fire Board. Advice was received from the Minister of Health, the Hon. A. J. Stallworthy, that a request made by the Council for an ambulance to be stationed at Birkenhead, had to be declined. The Minister said he regretted having to take this step, but due to the grave financial position pre- vailing at the time, there was no alternative. BERRY TROUBLE Another difficulty experienced during this grim period was a disease that attacked the strawberries. It was a root disease and was thought by one authority to be caused by excessive manuring. A report in the “Auckland Star” of a meeting held in the Victoria Hall, Birkenhead on Novem- ber 9, 1931, tells us that the Upper Waitemata Harbour Development Association had called a meeting to discuss a scheme to link Hobsonville and Beach Haven by a bridge. A donation of £7 guineas to the association was donated by the Birkenhead Borough Council, and the Whenuapai Ratepayers’ Association wrote that it was prepared to give the scheme any assistance required. A membership subscription of 1/- was adopted and a circular was prepared to explain the benefits that would accrue from the completion of the project. This austere year came to a close when the Council arranged a free trip to the zoo for the children of relief workers. The children were under the care of the Mayoress, Mrs. McPhail, and a committee of ladies and were served with light refreshments. The Marine Suburbs Bus Com- pany and the Birkenhead Transport Company provided buses free of charge and the Devonport Ferry Company allowed free transport across the harbour.

Hewson (Deputy-Mayor), G. Mills (Mayor), J. Prickett and H. Kemp (Town Clerk) . 30 HUMAN FEELING It is such actions as this, “for the children of relief workers”, that renews one’s faith in the essential human-ness of a borough council “of the people (appointed) by the people”, despite the unfeeling austerity it must practice in bad times — and 1930-1933 was one of the worst of times. Apparently the summer of 1932 was exception- ally dry for, according to the “Auckland Star” dated February 12, 1932, there was an increased consumption of water at Birkenhead and a “further lowering” of the surface of Lake Pupuke, the main source of water for the North Shore. The daily papers were still referring to the unemployment problem and various suggestions were being made as to how to alleviate the suf- ferings of so many. One suggestion made by the Birkenhead Council was “that there should be a shorter working day”. On June 30, 1932, the town clerk, Mr. J. W. Cocks, retired, and was succeeded by Mr. H. Kemp on August 17, five days after the sudden death of the Mayor, Mr. J. P. McPhail, at the age of 58. Until the situation was resolved, by election or appointment, the deputy mayor, Mr. G. B. Hewson, acted as mayor. At an emergency meeting of the Birkenhead Borough Council on August 16, 1932, Mr. G. Mills was appointed mayor to succeed the late Mr. McPhail. He was sworn in the following evening. This change in the borough’s administrative body, sad though it was, was followed by a decisive and realistic approach to the borough’s affairs. NEW BROOM Within a month of assuming the mayoralty, Mr. Mills presented a financial survey to the Council. He said the finances were in a serious position and he proposed to bring down a further report at the Council’s next meeting. At this meeting Mr. Mills reported that the bank overdraft of £5,500 had since been con- siderably reduced by the payment of current rates. A decision was made, however, to stand down the twelve men on the outside staff for one week in each six-weekly period, the saving for the six months being about £200. One motor lorry was also to be withdrawn from commission. A substantial reduction was being sought in street lighting costs and the possibilities of effecting economies in several other directions came under consideration. The saving of £200 over six months seems little enough by today’s standards but it was an impressive figure in 1932. It also indicates that 1932 - 1934 the average weekly wage for a council worker in those days was a little more than $8. It was in November, 1932, that the oldest sur- viving member of the first Birkenhead Borough Council died. He was Mr. Benjamin T. Hawkins, who had been born in Birkenhead and had lived there all his life. He was the younger of two sons of Henry James Hawkins who had settled at Birkenhead some time before 1880 and had worked an orchard and commercial strawberry patch at the side of Glenfield Road at Zion Hill, what is now the corner of Onewa Road and Glenfield Road. This undertaking had been continued on an extensive scale by his son Benjamin. Towards the end of 1932 letters were read at a council meeting from the Birkdale Ratepayers’ Association and the Birkenhead Ex-Servicemen’s Association, protesting at the disconnection of street lights, the number having been reduced from 128 to 40. At the same council meeting, it was reported that a bore had been sunk 400 feet on the site near the Birkenhead reservoir where water had been located by a diviner in 1910. The pump had tested the flow at a depth of 1 40 feet and had found the flow to be about 125 gallons an hour. On March 2, 1933, “The N.Z. Herald” reported that several members of the Birkenhead Borough Council and its staff inspected the Waikahikatoa Stream near Cuthill, the source of the proposed new water supply for the borough. The esti- mated cost of the scheme was £17,345 without filters and £4,000 additional with filters. A few weeks later, Mr. R. P. Worley, Con- sulting Engineer, explained schemes for obtaining a supply of water for North Shore boroughs, from Lignite Creek and several other sources.' None of these schemes was implemented. Eventually an agreement was reached with the Auckland City Council to supply Birkenhead with water from either its reservoirs across the harbour or from Lake Pupuke. Thus, finally, one problem was solved, but the Council was still faced with the Depression’s financial headaches. In mid 1933, further economies were recom- mended by the Mayor, Mr. Mills. At a meeting on June 8 the estimates were cut 10% below the previous year’s figures. To meet current expenditure, the town clerk was instructed to strike the rate promptly and allow a rebate of 5% if paid within 30 days of demand. 31 1934 - 1939 In addition, two motor trucks were sold and for five months, work was confined to street maintenance. Then came an event in lighter vein as if to relieve the tension of hard times and make them bearable. “The N.Z. Herald” of June 28 reported: “Arrangements for the observance of Arbor Day at Birkenhead were advanced by a combined meeting of the Council’s Parks Committee and various school committees in the district. It was agreed to hold a function to revive the previous custom of tree-planting. “The Governor-General, Lord Bledisloe is to be invited to plant a tree at the Birkenhead Civic Reserve adjoining the Borough Council Chambers, and to address the children of the local schools.” “The Auckland Star” reported: “A sunny day made one of the garden suburbs of Auckland smile this morning when Lord Bledisloe visited Birkenhead to plant a tree in observance of Arbor Day. “Besides 1 ,200 school children from the North- cote District High School, the Northcote, Birken- head, Birkdale, Glenfield, Albany and Greenhithe Primary schools and the Northcote Convent, some 300 residents of the borough gathered in the Council Chamber’s grounds where the planting ceremony took place and His Excellency spoke to the people. “The Mayor, Mr. Mills, said although the borough was 50 years old, it was the first time a representative of the King had visited it. He hoped it had been a pleasure for him to come to the garden suburb of Auckland. Perhaps some slight delay had been occasioned His Excellency by the fact of having to catch a ferry. “The next time the Governor-General came, he said, he hoped it would be over a trans-harbour bridge. “Lord Bledisloe then addressed the children, explaining the origin of Arbor Day. “After addressing the children His Excellency planted a karaka tree in the top left-hand corner of the ground and a lily-of-the-valley tree in another comer.” It was after thi"
