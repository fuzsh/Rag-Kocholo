        "text": "Southern support\n\nSelf-belief is Invercargill’s biggest asset, the Otago Daily Times says in its editorial of\n\n5 September 2018. The newspaper also minimises the region’s perceived tyrannies of distance (internet, cheaper air travel) and weather (“Compared to most of North America, Southland’s winters are positively balmy.”)\n\nRead the full editorial.\n\nFrom the late 1990s Invercargill has transformed itself by using innovative ideas and community funding to attract residents and visitors.\n\nThe Southern Institute of Technology offers free tertiary education to New Zealand citizens and offers courses specially tailored for international students. Invercargill is also establishing itself as a centre for conferences and events, both sporting and cultural.\n\nFor a relaxed lifestyle and southern hospitality Invercargill is the place to visit, live and raise a family. We look forward to welcoming you to our part of the world!"
