        "text": "The southernmost city of New Zealand, Invercargill is named after Captain William Cargill, who was born in 1784 in Edinburgh, served with distinction in the British Army, and later took up the scheme for the settlement of Otago.\n\nHe arrived in Port Chalmers, Dunedin on the sailing ship John Wycliffe on 23rd March 1848, and subsequently became the Superintendent of the Province, later becoming involved in early colonial politics until just before his death in 1860 at the age of seventy-six.\n\nMy ancestor, Robert Gillies arrived three weeks later on the Philip Laing, the second of this first fleet of two settler ships to arrive in this part of the country.\n\nInvercargill is the beneficiary of forward thinking pioneers, with wide streets laid out in a grid pattern, running east-west and north-south, wonderful civic gardens and parks, and some delightful heritage buildings including the Town Hall & Civic Theatre, which was completely restored and renovated in the early 2000s.\n\nAs the Civic Theatre faces to the south, to photograph this building with sunlight on the facade, you have to be there either early in the morning, or late in the evening during the summer months! This was a late evening shot.\n\nThe Invercargill Club, which these days accepts both Ladies and Gentleman members, is a gracious old wooden building right in the centre of town!\n\nWith manicured lawns and box hedging set behind a wrought iron fence, it is a popular meeting place for the movers and shakers in town!\n\nWith early settlement being predominantly of Scottish origin, alongside seafarers, there are are quite a number of Presbyterian and Catholic churches, a contrast to the rest of the country where the Anglican tradition was stronger.\n\nQueens Park is a Botanical Garden that would do justice to a much larger city, and of which we are very proud. It is just two blocks away from us, and we walk there regularly!\n\nOf course no park is complete without somewhere for the ducks!\n\nWe feel really blessed to live in such a nice part of the world!\n\nThanks for visiting!"
