The Invercargill electorate takes in the communities of Invercargill, Bluff, Stewart Island, Riverton, and Wallacetown. Its eastern boundary lies to the east of Waikawa Valley and Progress Valley, and its western boundary extends into the Fiordland National Park.

In the 2020 boundary review, Invercargill was below quota so gained population from its only neighbour, Southland. The Representation Commission’s proposed solution was to add both the Winton and Catlins areas. Objections raised on community of interest grounds resulted in the Winton and Catlins areas remaining in the renamed Southland electorate, with Invercargill gaining population by expansion into western Southland, including Tuatapere.

The Invercargill electorate has existed continuously since 1866. Josiah Hanan (Liberal) held the Invercargill seat for 26 years, from 1899 to 1925. His nephew, Ralph Hanan (National) held the seat from 1946 to 1969. As Minister of Justice, Ralph Hanan was a noted law reformer. He had a role in the establishment of an ombudsman in New Zealand (the first in the English-speaking world), the creation of the Law Commission, and the abolition of capital punishment.

Since 1935, the electorate has shifted between National and Labour, with National holding the seat since 2005. The electorate’s first woman MP, Sarah Dowie (National), held the seat from 2014 to 2020. At the 2020 election Invercargill was won by Penny Simmonds (National).

The Invercargill electorate recorded a 0.8% annual average population increase between Census 2013 and Census 2018, about one-third of that recorded by New Zealand as a whole over the same period (2.1%). While the proportion of those identifying as Māori in the electorate (16.4%) is about the same as in New Zealand overall (16.5%), the proportion in the European ethnic group is much higher at 85.7% compared to 70.2% nationally. Almost nine in ten people (87.8%) in the electorate were born in New Zealand, while 12.2% were born overseas – respectively, the third-highest and third-lowest proportions found in any general electorate.

Over half (52.8%) of occupied dwellings comprised three bedrooms; and for those in rented occupied dwellings 45.1% paid between $200 and $299 per week – percentages that were the highest in New Zealand. Just over one in eight households (12%) used coal as their primary heating fuel, down from nearly a third (31.4%) of households who used coal as their primary heating fuel in 2013.

Election results (2020)

The winning candidate in the 2020 election, Penny Simmonds (National Party), captured a plurality (45.5%) of the 39,412 valid electorate votes cast for candidates in the Invercargill electorate, with a margin of 224. The seat was previously won in 2017 by Sarah Dowie (National Party) with a margin of 5,579. The Labour Party captured a plurality (48.1%) of the party votes in Invercargill, up 12.3 percentage points on its party vote share in 2017. Turnout (total votes cast as a proportion of enrolled electors) in 2020 was 83.0%.

This section provides a range of information from the 2018 Census about homes and families in the electorate. It also has information about residential building consents issued.

The census distinguishes between dwellings, households, and families. A dwelling refers to the physical structure. A household is either one person who usually lives alone, or two or more people who usually live together. A family comprises a couple with or without children or one parent and their children.

There are two tables describing homeownership. They differ in measuring ownership at the individual or the household level. A household may own their dwelling but not all people within that household share in the ownership.

Areas of deprivation map

This map visually represents areas of deprivation within the electorate. The higher the index of Deprivation (1 - 10), the more socioeconomically deprived an area is considered (see Glossary). Prepared from data published in the New Zealand Indexes of Deprivation – 2018 files here by the University of Otago, Wellington.

This section includes information from the 2018 Census about work and income of people, households, and families. It also includes information about non-residential building consents issued.

Income is the total before-tax income of a person, household, or family in the 12 months ended 31 March 2018. Family and household income is derived by taking the income of all members aged 15 and over of the family or household. Income does not include Working for Families tax credits.

Graph: Total personal income (%)

This graph visually represents the data in the Total personal income, 2018 Census table in the Work and incomes section of this profile.
