Noonan has appeared as a supporting player in numerous motion pictures, including Michael Cimino's maligned western Heaven's Gate, the freewheeling Rodney Dangerfield comedy Easy Money, John Cassavetes's feminist gangster work Gloria, and the extravagant Arnold Schwarzenegger action film The Last Action Hero. He also received much attention for his portrayal of psychopathic killer Francis Dollarhyde in Michael Mann's 1986 Hannibal Lecter film Manhunter—one of a number of noted sinister roles in his career—a character whom Entertainment Weekly contributor Ty Burr described as \"one of the freakiest madmen Hollywood has ever given us.\" In recent years, Noonan has stepped into more prominent movie roles. In addition to his many cinema roles, Noonan has graced the television screen numerous times throughout his career, with guest appearances on television shows, including The X-Files, C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation, and Law and Order: Criminal Intent. Noonan has written three major stage plays, which he then adapted and produced as films, also occupying the lead roles: What Happened Was …, The Wife, and Wang Dang.\n\nNoonan applied the profits from his acting into the funding of What Happened Was …, his own venture into writing and directing. This film, which was derived from Noonan's stage production of the same title, chronicles—in painstaking detail—an awkward first date between coworkers at a law office. The film couple, secretary Jackie and paralegal Michael, meet at the latter's apartment and share an unsettling evening. Newsweek reviewer David Ansen remarked on the \"painful comedy\" captured in the film and reported that the work \"acknowledges the terror behind the phrase 'getting acquainted.'\" A Rolling Stone reviewer described Noonan's work as having \"an edgy hothouse quality.\" Since the piece is filmed in real-time, the critic noted, the film depicts \"the agony of getting to know someone … in every awkward gesture and excruciating pause.\" An Entertainment Weekly contributor termed What Happened Was … \"an unsettling glimpse into the feelings that all our faces hide.\" Noonan, in addition to writing and directing What Happened Was …, also directed, edited, and produced the film. He also occupied the role of Michael in both the stage and film productions.\n\nAfter the critical success of What Happened Was … in 1994, Noonan wrote and directed his second film, The Wife, which he adapted from his 1993 play Wifey, also known as The Wife. In the movie, husband and wife, Cosmo and Arlie, unexpectedly drop by the home of another married couple, Jack and Rita, both of whom are therapists. Cosmo is Jack and Rita's patient, and hopes to convince his therapists that he hasn't fabricated the things he's said about his wife. As the awkward evening progresses, Cosmo grows increasingly uncomfortable as Arlie's behavior becomes more flamboyant. A Variety reviewer described The Wife as \"a bizarre, often provocative seriocomic dissection of marriage as a fragile yet almost universal institution.\" Noonan played Jack in the stage production and the motion picture, which he also directed and edited.\n\nIn 1999, Noonan again adapted an original stage work for film. Wang Dang introduces audiences to Mickey Hounsell, a has-been movie director who visits a college campus to give a lecture on filmmaking. It becomes clear, however, that he has a different agenda when film student Deana Icksty comes to his off-campus motel room. Deana is awed by the movie director, who has agreed to view a film project she is working on, and the two appear to be in for a cozy night when another student, Kim Procthkow, arrives at the door. Kim, however, is more interested in Deana than she is Mickey. The audience watches with gritted teeth as the awkward, taciturn, and sleazy Mickey, played by Noonan, tries to seduce the two young women.\n\n\"The character Noonan has supplied for himself is richly woven,\" wrote Les Gutman in a review of Wang Dang for Curtain Up. \"Nervous, uncomfortable, lonesome, goofy, defeated…. Every nuance resonates in his portrayal.\" New York Times contributor Peter Marks wrote of the character's \"anti-charm,\" stating, \"Mickey may not be the type of guy you'd want to be stuck with in an empty room. But Noonan, in his intimate style of theater, makes him seem so real that you can almost feel his unpleasant breath on your neck.\" Gutman also commended Noonan's style, referring to the play's authentic, sordid motel room set, lack of stage lighting or music, and real-time atmosphere. \"Also distinctive is Noonan's dialogue, which is sometimes jarringly real,\" Gutman maintained. \"Speech is tentative—there are no glib, well-considered statements…. This is a mixed blessing: as effective and intriguing as it can be, it can also be tedious. Such is reality.\" Marks wrote of the play that \"watching it is an almost clinical experience,\" dubbing Wang Dang a \"discursive drama played as if a documentary camera had been left running.\" Marks went on to reflect that the play is \"enjoyable in the way that experimental theater makes you aware of new applications for old formulas.\" In 1999, Noonan began filming the play for the screen—in Liberty, New York, near his home in the Catskill Mountains—with the assistance of fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the New York Foundation for the Arts. Although Noonan's films have been financed on modest budgets, especially in comparison to those films in which he has acted, he scarcely sees this limited funding as a disadvantage. \"That's the great thing about no-budget moviemaking,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. \"You have no money, but you have all the time in the world.\"\n\nSince the production of Wang Dang, Noonan has written numerous unpublished plays. In 2001 he put playwriting on hold to take a lead role in the film Knockaround Guys, written, directed, and produced by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, and starring Barry Pepper, Dennis Hopper, John Malkovich, Vin Diesel, and Seth Green. In Knockaround Guys, young Brooklyn mobster Matty (Barry Pepper) wants to prove his talent for illicit activities to his big-time boss father (Dennis Hopper). While the movie itself received mixed reactions from critics, even the most jaded had positive comments to make about Noonan's acting. \"Tom Noonan, as Andy Griffith with a big stick and attitude, carries his scenes smoothly, and really makes you believe that he hasn't had a facial expression in twenty odd years,\" commented Marc Eastman on the Movie Gurus Web site. In a review for Film Freak Central, contributor Walter Chaw stated that \"Knockaround Guys demonstrates what it could be when Noonan struts on the screen with his careful reptilian gait.\" Chaw went on to say that \"the real failures of this film are … its uncontrollable glee with its veteran cast, too much faith in its freshman players … and not enough time spent in the company of Noonan.\"\n\nNoonan returned to the screen the following year with the movie Eight-Legged Freaks, written by Jesse Alexander and Ellory Elkayem, and starring David Arquette and Kari Wuhrer. Noonan plays Joshua Taft, a recluse and owner of an exotic spider farm who collects bugs for his spiders from an area undisclosed as a nuclear waste spill site. Joshua's spiders grow to astronomical sizes and begin eating the citizens of the desert town. Eight-Legged Freaks was a hit with movie fans who enjoy the classically cheesy thrills of the 1950s monster movies. In a review for Reel Movie Critic, reviewer Brenda Sexton praised Noonan for his \"fabulously played role\" as Joshua. The next year, Noonan played the lead role in Madness and Genius.\n\n\"I've realized that the experience of the moment on a film set that was of value—not the deal, not the press, not the power,\" revealed Noonan in an article on his Web site titled \"Why I Make Movies.\" \"Making a movie with that kind of understanding has made me a better person. That's why I make movies. I feel lucky that I found a way to be alive, if only for those brief moments. It's like they turn the lights on for a minute and I can see the world. And that's enough for me. Life's become that simple, and I pray to God it stays that simple.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nbooks\n\nContemporary Theatre, Film, and Television, Volume 53, Gale (Detroit, MI), 2004.\n\nperiodicals\n\nEntertainment Weekly, September 23, 1994, p. 46; April 19, 1996, Melissa Pierson, movie review of What Happened Was …, p. 86; June 21, 1996, Ty Burr, movie review of Manhunter, p. 73.\n\nFilm Comment, November-December, 1995, Dan Gribbin, movie review of Mystery Train, pp. 80-83.\n\nNewsweek, September 12, 1994, pp. 59-60.\n\nNew York Times, August 11, 1996, p.
