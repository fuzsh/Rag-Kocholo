        "text": "The Last Row Podcast‘s Summer of Sequels concludes by bringing back everyone’s favorite cop…RoboCop 2! Drew and Badway discuss the sad state fictional Detroit is in, the wussification of RoboCop (and how much we wanted more of it), pros and cons of cops on strike, and question whether the drug “Nuke” was really such a bad thing. Also Badway shows his appreciation for the inept mayor, and the guys put the Old Man and his incredible hot tub room through the villain scale."
