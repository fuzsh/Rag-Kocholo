You can‚Äôt just stick to cerebral art house, that‚Äôs too much fibre, and you also can‚Äôt live on popcorn blockbusters, that‚Äôs too much sugar or salt. Got to have balance.\n\nHappy choosing, happy viewing,\n\nBry\n\nFILM ONE: LAST ACTION HERO\n\n1993 Dir John McTiernan\n\nI was obsessed with this film when it came out and not just because of the Reebok pumps worn by the lead character, Danny. I‚Äôve watched it a lot, and during lockdown I revisited it. It‚Äôs just a really enjoyable film that doesn‚Äôt take itself seriously. It‚Äôs a sendup of the action genre, using Arnie at peak Arnie to laugh at his own on screen persona. It‚Äôs about a kid who winds up getting sucked into a cinema screen via a magic ticket and ending up in a kind of Arnie alternative cinematic metaverse way before Marvel even considered getting into the film business. It‚Äôs the most fun when its in full self-reference mode. There‚Äôs a blink and you‚Äôll miss-it-cameo from Robert Patrick‚Äôs T1000 from Terminator 2 and others, plus in this world Stallone is the action hero.\n\nMcTiernan [an incredible filmmaker who made a better version of The Thomas Crown Affair] delivers big action sequences that are way over the top but still feel ‚Äòcool.‚Äô He tackles the send up with all the visual vigor and charm of his biggest films to date. Every trope is played out and played with as Danny educates Slater [Arnie] on the rules of his own world to which he is blind. Charles Dance is amazing as the villain with very silly but very quotable lines like;\n\n‚ÄúI snap my fingers again and some time tomorrow, you emerge from several canine rector.‚Äù\n\nApparently Rector is the plural of rectum. If nothing else you learned that today from the newsletter. I get the feeling that this is a Shane Black line who was brought on to do a rewrite. Black also made changes to and had a small role opposite Arnie in Predator. Last Action Hero went through a hefty number of rewrites and eventually William Goldman, was brought in to do a final pass at the cost of a $1,000,000. And according to legend they were doing reshoots/ shooting additional material a week before the release date.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt do well on release - facing off against the gigantic Jurassic Park which set several box office records at the time. But, fortunately, in the intervening years this odd ball, weirdly clever pastiche of the action genre and Hollywood at large has come to foreshadow so many of the big plays big movie storytelling has had in recent years. The most recent Spiderman ‚Äòspider verse‚Äô being one of them. I get the feeling if it was released today it wouldn‚Äôt have the lukewarm reception it had back then. Go on treat yourself to some meta movie madness.\n\nTL;DR why should I spend 2 hr 10 minutes of my precious life watching this? Indulge John McTiernan‚Äôs no holds barred satire on Hollywood action movies as Arnie pumps up the self-referential ham to astoundingly fun new levels, all the while, a raft of famous faces appear to breath life into a cinematic universe where the action feels more real and sees Charles Dance get all the best lines with a perfectly cast\n\nTom Noonan as the cherry on top.\n\n*Available for a small rental fee on Amazon Prime, Youtube, Google Play, and Apple TV*\n\nFact: Carrie Fisher did uncredited work on the script.\n\nFILM TWO: STEAMBOAT BILL JR\n\n1928 Dir Charles Reisner [Buster Keaton uncredited]\n\nPeople may talk about modern action films being spectacular - but before Cruise, was the original ‚Äòdo all their own stunts action hero‚Äô - Buster Keaton. He stars in this silent era masterpiece, an endlessly charming, funny and dangerously action-packed film. The lead actor‚Äôs life was at real risk in possibly the most famous onscreen stunt in cinema history. Even if you‚Äôve never seen the film - you‚Äôre more than likely to have seen the stunt and its many imitations - Keaton survives the collapse of a house by lining up perfectly with an attic window [the wall of the house weighed 2 tons].\n\nIt‚Äôs a tale about a young, ill-equipped man returning to his father‚Äôs steamboat business and proving his worth in a series of unfortunate events - which end up transforming him for the better. Watching it now, everything appears as even more of a marvel, because you know they relied purely on creative elbow grease and ingenuity to bring everything to life for real in front of the camera. I watched it with a permanent smile on my face. Every frame has a joke or is a set-up for a joke. With no traditional dialogue able to fill in, this is true cinema - physical, visual and more like a ride than a film watching experience.\n\nSadly the film didn‚Äôt do well on release - despite Keaton spending a lot of his personal wealth on the elaborate set pieces. In fact it led to the collapse of his own production company but would cement his legacy in film history. In time it would be regarded rightly as a masterpiece and one of his most famous films.\n\nTL;DR why should I spend 1 hr 11 minutes of my precious life watching this? Soak in the charm and physical artistry of Buster Keaton as he tries to prove his worth to his father and win the girl of his dreams in simpler more wonderfully fun filmmaking times."
