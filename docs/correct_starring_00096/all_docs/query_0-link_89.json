Danny becomes his helper as Jack battles a trio of nefarious bad guys, Benedict (Charles Dance), Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn), and The Ripper (Tom Noonan). But things get out of hand when Benedict steals Danny’s magic ticket stub and transports himself into the real world, where crime can, and often does, pay. Jack and Danny must leave fictional Los Angeles for real-life New York and battle the villains without the aid of movie magic or stuntmen.\n\nDISC DETAILS & BONUS MATERIAL\n\n4K ULTRA HD DISC\n\nNewly remastered in 4K resolution from the original camera negative, with HDR10\n\nAll-new Dolby Atmos audio + the original theatrical SDDS mix presented as 5.1 + original theatrical stereo audio\n\nAudio Commentary with Director John McTiernan\n\nDeleted & Alternate Scenes (presented in 4K with HDR10)\n\nAlternate Ending (presented in 4K with HDR10)\n\n“Big Gun” Music Video by AC/DC\n\nOriginal Behind-the-Scenes Featurette\n\nTheatrical Teaser\n\nSET ALSO INCLUDES BLU-RAY & DIGITAL\n\nCAST AND CREW\n\nDirected By: John McTiernan\n\nStory By: Zak Penn & Adam Leff\n\nScreenplay By: Shane Black & David Arnott\n\nProducers: Steve Roth and John McTiernan\n\nExecutive Producer: Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nCast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, F.
