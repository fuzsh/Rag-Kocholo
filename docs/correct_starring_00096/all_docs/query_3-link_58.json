        "text": "Anomalisa\n\nAnomalisa offers evidence that animated films are not necessarily the sole province of children. In fact, this one isn’t even designed for all adults. Charlie Kaufman has always been something of an acquired taste. Anomalisa highlights Kaufman at h...\n\nAnonymous\n\nThose who question the authorship of Shakespeare's plays are like Climate Change deniers - despite being in a minority, they are tenacious and passionate. Though a surfeit of facts are against them, they are able to make some good points that the o...\n\nBasic Instinct 2\n\nWho would have imagined that the most appropriate word to describe Basic Instinct 2 would be \"boring?\" This plodding, pretentious follow-up to 1992's hit replaces Paul Verhoeven's lurid, over-the-top style with the leaden rhythms of Michael Caton-...\n\nBoy in the Striped Pajamas,The\n\nPossible Spoilers: Although this review does not explicitly reveal the ending of the movie, there are enough insinuations that one can make some assumptions about what might happen.

This is a good thing, because it means that the filmmakers are becoming less literal and more ...\n\nI'm Thinking of Ending Things\n\nIf there’s one thing I have learned about Charlie Kaufman over the years, it’s that he’s a much better screenwriter than director. Collaborating with the likes of Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich) and Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of ...\n\nJames and the Giant Peach\n\nAlmost everything that was true of 1993's Nightmare Before Christmas holds for 1996's James and the Giant Peach. Based (rather faithfully) on Roald Dahl's children's story, this movie uses a combination of live-action sequences and stop-motion an...\n\nKingdom of Heaven\n\nIn Gladiator, director Ridley Scott transported movie audiences to the year 180 AD.
