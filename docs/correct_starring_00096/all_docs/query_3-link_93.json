Beneath strobing lights and pounding music each dancer's psyche begins to crumble, and creeping paranoia gives rise to a hallucinatory nightmare. Legendary art-house provocateur Gaspar Noé (Enter the Void) delivers an intensely deranged and lurid orgy of sex, drugs and club music (featuring Cerrone, Daft Punk and Aphex Twin) taking us into the forbidden reaches of heaven and descending deep into hell.\n\nWinner of the C.I.C.A.E. Award at 2018 Cannes Film Festival prepare yourself for a visceral, hypnotic, intense and mad experience.\n\nAnomalisa\n\nMA15+\n\nUSA/UK, 2015\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy, Romance, Animation\n\nLanguage: English\n\nDirector: Charlie Kaufman, Duke Johnson\n\nStarring: David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tom Noonan\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nFrom writer Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and Duke Johnson (Frankenhole) comes this stop-motion animation wonder about Michael Stone, husband, father and respected author of \"How May I Help You Help Them?\", a man weighted by the mundanity of his life. On a business trip to Cincinnati, where he's scheduled to speak at a convention of customer service professionals, he checks into the Fregoli Hotel. There, he is amazed to discover a possible escape from his desperation in the form of an unassuming Akron baked goods sales rep, Lisa, who may or may not be the love of his life. This Oscar-nominated animation is certainly not for kids. It is funny, sad, daring and haunting; it may be an animation, but this film feels real.\n\n[link title=\"'Anomalisa' review: A Tender, Human Animation\" url=\"node/45775\"]\n\n[link title=\"Charlie Kaufman's animation feature 'Anomalisa' is adult-only\" url=\"node/45967\"]\n\nA Fantastic Woman\n\nM\n\nChile, 2017\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nLanguage: Spanish\n\nDirector: Sebastián Lelio\n\nStarring: Daniela Vega, Francisco Reyes, Luis Gnecco, Aline Küppenheim, Nicolás Saavedra, Amparo Noguera\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nMarina and Orlando are in love and planning for the future. Marina is a young waitress and aspiring singer. Orlando is 20 years older and owns a printing company. After celebrating Marina’s birthday, Orlando falls seriously ill.

She battles the very same forces that she has spent a lifetime fighting just to become the woman she is now – a complex, strong, forthright and fantastic woman.\n\nWinner of the 2018 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it is the first film with a transgender lead to win the award, and star and co-writer Daniela Vega became the first openly transgender person to present at the ceremony.\n\n[link title=\"'A Fantastic Woman': Empathetic, Resonant Oscar-winning Chilean Melodrama\" url=\"node/115433\"]\n\n[link title=\"'A Fantastic Woman' star takes historic Oscars win in her stride\" url=\"node/191412\"]\n\nIncendies\n\nMA15+\n\nCanada/France, 2010\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nLanguage: French, Arabic, English\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nStarring: Lubna Azabal, Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin, Maxim Gaudette\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nWhen notary Lebel sits down with Jeanne and Simon Marwan to read them their mother Nawal's will, the twins are stunned to receive a pair of envelopes – one for the father they thought was dead and another for a brother they didn't know existed. In this enigmatic inheritance, Jeanne sees the key to Nawal's retreat into unexpected silence during the final weeks of her life. She immediately decides to go to the Middle East to dig into a family history of which she knows next to nothing. Simon is unmoved by the posthumous mind games of a mother who was always distant and cold. However, his strong love for his sister sees him join her in combing their ancestral homeland in search of a Nawal who is very different from the mother they knew.\n\nDirected and co-written by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival) Incendies was nominated for the 2011 Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars.

Both world-renowned gynaecologists, they share everything from their clinic to their women, until they meet Claire. Beverly falls in love with her, and for the first time wishes to break the ties with his brother. However, as his attempt to love her unravels, so does his sanity, with chilling consequences. Maybe not a great date movie, but this is classic Cronenberg, even praised as his masterpiece, with a tour de force performance by Jeremy Irons, twice over.\n\n[link title=\"Dead Ringers review: Cool, clinical and confrontational\" url=\"node/45651\"]\n\nSource: SBS Movies\n\nHoly Motors\n\nMA15+\n\nFrance, 2012\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nLanguage: French\n\nDirector: Leos Carax\n\nStarring: Denis Lavant, Edith Scob, Eva Mendes, Kylie Minogue\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nFrom dawn to dusk, we follow Monsieur Oscar, a shadowy character who journeys from one life to the next.

Monsieur Oscar is accompanied only by Céline, the slender blonde woman behind the wheel of the vast engine that transports him through and around Paris. He's like a conscientious assassin moving from hit to hit, in pursuit of the beautiful gesture, the mysterious driving force, the women and the ghosts of past lives. But where is his true home, his family, his sanctuary?\n\nWinner of the 2012 Prize of the Youth at Cannes, this film from Leos Carax (Bad Blood) is an unforgettable experience, visually spellbinding and unashamedly confounding all at the same time.\n\n[link title=\"Holy Motors: Denis Lavant interview\" url=\"node/962\"]\n\n[link title=\"Holy Motors: Cheat sheet\" url=\"node/976\"]\n\n[link title=\"Holy Motors Review\" url=\"node/5878\"]\n\nClouds of Sils Maria\n\nMA15+\n\nFrance, Switzerland, Germany, 2014\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nLanguage: English, French\n\nDirector: Olivier Assayas\n\nStarring: Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, Chloë Grace Moretz, Brady Corbet, Lars Eldinger\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nAt the peak of her acting career, Maria Enders is asked to perform in a revival of the play that made her famous years ago.
