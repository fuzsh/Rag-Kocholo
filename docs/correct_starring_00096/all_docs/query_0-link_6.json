        "text": "American actor and director\n\nFor other people named Tom Noonan, see Tom Noonan (disambiguation).\n\nTom Noonan (born April 12, 1951) is an American actor, director, and screenwriter, best known for his roles as Francis Dolarhyde in Manhunter (1986), Frankenstein's Monster in The Monster Squad (1987), Cain in RoboCop 2 (1990), The Ripper in Last Action Hero (1993), Sammy Barnathan in Synecdoche, New York (2008), Reverend Nathaniel in Hell on Wheels (2011–2014), the Pallid Man in 12 Monkeys (2015–2018) and as the voice of everyone but the two main characters in Anomalisa (2015).\n\nNoonan is also a writer and director of theatre and film. His debut feature film What Happened Was (1994) won the Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and Screenwriting Award at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nNoonan was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, the son of Rita (McGannon), a mathematics teacher, and John Noonan Sr., a jazz musician and doctor of dental surgery.[1][2] He had an older brother, John Ford Noonan, a playwright,[3] and two sisters, Barbara and Nancy. Noonan was a very talented basketball player, and said \"playing basketball is how I learned to perform in a lot of ways. It's how I got interested in performing... I never acted as a kid. I never did school plays. I never acted until I was 27...you learn a lot when you're in front of people and you’ve got a crowd going and you're doing something that you love to do. A lot of the skills that you would need for acting come through that... It's like a life and death struggle in front of people that you hope to impress.\"[4]\n\nNoonan started working in theatre (appearing in the original Off-Broadway production of Sam Shepard's play Buried Child), but in the 1980s he began working in film. At 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall, Noonan's imposing presence is probably responsible for his tendency to be cast as menacing villains, as in RoboCop 2, Last Action Hero, Manhunter, and The Pledge. His height was used for comic effect in \"The Moving Finger,\" the series finale of the horror anthology Monsters (several episodes of which he also directed and wrote).\n\nIn 1986, Noonan played Francis Dolarhyde, a serial killer who kills entire families, in Michael Mann's Manhunter, the first movie to feature Hannibal Lecter. Another supporting role, and another collaboration with director Michael Mann was in 1995, as Kelso in Heat. He also played the Frankenstein monster in The Monster Squad. During the 1990s, he wrote various plays, including two that he made into movies, What Happened Was... (1994) and The Wife (1995). In the 2000s, Noonan appeared in various other movies, including a widely praised role as Sammy Barnathan in Synecdoche, New York, Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut.\n\nNoonan has also made numerous appearances in television series, including The X-Files (in the much-praised 1996 episode \"Paper Hearts\" that was written specifically for him[5]), Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Tales from the Darkside and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (in which he starred alongside William Petersen, who played his nemesis, Will Graham, in Manhunter), and Detective Victor Huntley in Damages. He appeared on Blacklist as The Stew Maker, Louie as a doctor who takes the young Louie through the crucifixion in graphic anatomical detail. He also portrayed the Reverend Nathaniel Cole in the AMC original series Hell on Wheels.\n\nIn 2015, Noonan voiced all of the supporting characters in Duke Johnson and Charlie Kaufman's stop-motion comedy-drama film Anomalisa, for which he won the San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1980 Willie & Phil Man In Park 1980 Gloria 2nd Man - Gangster 1980 Heaven's Gate Jake 1981 Wolfen Ferguson 1983 Eddie Macon's Run Daryl Potts 1983 Easy Money Paddy 1984 Best Defense Frank Holtzman 1985 The Man with One Red Shoe Reese 1985 Tom Goes to the Bar Unknown Short film 1986 F/X Varrick 1986 Manhunter Francis Dollarhyde 1987 The Monster Squad Frankenstein's Monster 1989 Collision Course Scully 1989 Mystery Train Man in Arcade Diner Segment: \"A Ghost\" 1990 RoboCop 2 Cain 1993 Last Action Hero Ripper / Tommy Noonan 1994 What Happened Was...
