        "text": "Rating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Animation, Comedy, Drama\n\nRun Time: 1 hours, 30 minutes, Rated R\n\nStarring (voices of): David Thewlis, Tom Noonan, Jennifer Jason Leigh\n\nWritten by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Synecdoche, New York) Co-Directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson\n\nâ€‹\n\nAnyone familiar with the work of writer/director Charlie Kaufman would expect nothing less than Anomalisa (opening today). It's a quirky, mesmerizing exploration of a man trapped under the weight of his mundane life. This is clearly an adult-only film (no kids whatsoever, trust me), making its unique stop-motion animation style even more unnerving to watch. Stealing from its poster, Anomalisa is one of the most \"human\" films of the year, despite the fact that it stars only puppets. It requires a second-viewing to take the film in wholly, because just seeing it once may be a disservice to the complex issues it tackles. And while it didn't crack my Top 10 List of 2015, it was damn close."
