Wizemann’s microbudget feature LOSING GROUND was adapted from his critically acclaimed New York stage play and features the original cast. It premiered at Cinequest with distribution by FilmBuff. His early experimental 16mm feature SENSE starring Maria Dizzia was programmed at the Johnson Museum of Art and the Angelika Film Centre.\n\nWizemann’s short film work includes his college thesis 16mm film BUTTON SOUP (Cornell), THE MORNING SUN (Rooftop, IFC Media Lab) the television series COOKLYN (BRIC arts media), and FILM MAKES US HAPPY (DocPoint Helsinki, IFFB, Rooftop, Hamptons, Wholphin), which documents the last fight he’ll ever have with his wife about making films.
