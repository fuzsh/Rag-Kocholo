        "text": "Innovation\n\nThere are few opportunities in the world for building a Steel Hot Rolling Mill from scratch, and Ternium is taking this chance to make an 100% sustainable investment from the beginning (its construction), using the best available technology in terms of environmental care and operations, taking in consideration several UN’s Global Goals for Sustainable Development, such as “Renewable Energy”, “Climate Action”, “Good Jobs and Economic Growth”, “Industry Innovation and Infrastructure”, “Clean Water and Sanitation”, “Responsible Consumption” and “Renewable Energy”.\n\nAny Hot Rolling Mill requires a large quantity of water to operate. This installation has been built with a water treatment plant that is fed with sewage from the city. This investment, will save 765 m3 of water per hour. In addition, a rain channel has been built to prevent rainwater from mixing with treated water when it is discharged into the river that runs very close to the plant.\n\nAlso, through efficient combustion technologies, the Hot Rolling Mill will be using the minimal quantity of natural gas to operate and a recycling system is established in all Ternium plants to reduce the use of energy and raw material supplies.\n\nInspiration\n\nRoberto Rocca was a visionary who dedicated over 50 years to create what today is Techint Group (where Ternium belongs to), promoting and driving investigation and technology, committed to both industrial development and social responsibility. Mr. Rocca demonstrated a deep engagement and accountability to establish and pass along values, development, and wellness to the community.\n\nThe metropolitan area of Monterrey Nuevo Leon, in northern Mexico has always been land of big industries and the steel industry is one of them. Mexico is diverse and rich in many aspects, but Monterrey was a turning point in the economic development of the country. This city is where the development of the country started in the late 19th century, as industrialization process started with the textile industry, followed by the founding of a brewery which needed glass, cardboard, among other supplies made in the same area. By the year 1900 “Fundidora Monterrey” was founded, it was the first integrated steelworks plant in Latin America.\n\nBetween the years 2005 & 2007 Ternium acquired the two biggest steel companies in Mexico (Hylsa & IMSA) both located in Monterrey, becoming the biggest steel producer in Latin America. Since then, Ternium has been investing in Mexico, in the Monterrey area mainly, over $3 billion USD in several projects and the newest one is the Hot Rolling Mill located in Pesqueria, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, within the Monterrey area.\n\nMexico is a country with a steel deficit, that is, not enough steel is produced in the country to supply local demand, therefore imports are essential to meet the requirements of local industry. Therefore, Ternium's investments in recent years have been focused on being able to supply the steel industry made in Mexico to substitute imports.\n\nA new hot rolling mills is part of Ternium's newest investments and since its beginning, the idea was to make it completely sustainable. The company understand 2 things in a very clear way:\n\n1) A hot rolling mill is an investments for many years, therefore it is important that this project can be immersed in the community and its environment forever.\n\n2) The industry global standards are meant to be this way, to make sustainable investments. Ternium is a leader in the world steel association and wants to send a message to the whole industry on how things should be done since the very beginning of the project.\n\nSocial and environmental benefit\n\nPeople\n\nPesqueria used to be a very poor town dedicated to the cattle raising and its people used to leave their town to move to work to Monterrey City or even emigrate to the United States looking for job opportunities.\n\nThe Ternium projects, including the new hot rolling mill, not only generated new jobs in Pesqueria that gave people the opportunity to stay in their town, but also made other big companies such as KIA Motors, establish in the same area, reversing the flow of people, so that inhabitants from Monterrey and other towns come every day or to work in Pesqueria.\n\nThis economic development resulted in positive externalities in the area, as new quality roads, housing developments, new schools, hospitals, were built, improving the quality of life of the people within the community.\n\nEnvironment\n\nSteel production through sustainable inputs and usage of energy without ignoring the environment is the best way of balancing production activities and nature’s wellbeing. Ternium Pesqueria’s industrial center consists of 437 ha, 99 of which were used to establish a natural reserve. Over 32,000 flora and 681 fauna individuals were rescued in the construction area.\n\nTernium’s new Industrial Center is the first flat product plant to achieve LEED certification of environmental sustainability in the country.\n\nEconomy\n\nWith an investment of over $1 billion USD, solely in this new hot rolling mill, the economic development of the local communities is benefited. Over 5,000 employments were created from this project construction and local workers where the base line for this development.\n\nThese new jobs generate further investments, both from other private companies that see beneficial consequences for installing nearby and government investment for improving the regional infrastructure."
