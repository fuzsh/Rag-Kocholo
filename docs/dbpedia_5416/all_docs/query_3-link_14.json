        "text": "We report on the Azuara impact structure and its Rubielos de la Cérida companion crater, which establish the largest terrestrial doublet impact structure presently known. Both structures have diameters of roughly 35 - 40 km and they have been formed in a purely sedimentary target. From stratigraphic considerations and palaeontologic dating, an Upper Eocene or Oligocene age is very probable. Geological mapping has established abundant geologic impact evidence in the form of monomictic and polymictic breccias and breccia dikes, megabreccias, dislocated megablocks, remarkable structural features, extensive impact ejecta and impact signatures even in distant autochthonous deposits. The most striking impact evidence for both structures is given by strong shock metamorphism, including melt and diaplectic glass, planar deformation features (PDFs), different kinds of impact melt rocks (from former silicate melt, carbonate melt, carbonate-phosphate melt) and suevite breccias. Glassy amorphous carbon particles in a solid C-O compound may be related with fullerenes and may originate from a quenched melt of extremely shocked coal or from extremely shocked limestones. It is assumed that the impact had considerable influence on the Mid-Tertiary regional geology of the Iberian System, and we suggest that respective geologic models which have so far not considered this peculiar and far-reaching event, need considerable revision.\n\nThe Pelarda Formation (Fm.), located in the Iberian System in northeast Spain, is a sedimentary deposit with an extension of roughly 12 km x 2.5 km and an estimated thickness of no more than 400 m. The formation was first recognized as a peculiar unit in the early seventies and underwent interpretations like a fluvial or an alluvial fan deposit having a postulated age between Paleogene and Quaternary. Since the early nineties the Pelarda Formation has been considered an impact ejecta deposit originating from the large ca. 40 km-diameter Azuara impact structure and meanwhile being among the largest and most prominent terrestrial impact ejecta occurrences, which however is questioned by regional geologists still defending the fluvial and alluvial fan models. Roughly speaking, the Pelarda Fm. is a grossly unsorted, matrix-supported diamictite with grain sizes between silt fraction and meter-sized clasts and a big intercalated megablock. Strong clast deformations and abundant shock metamorphic effects like planar deformation features (PDF) are observed throughout the Pelarda F. deposit compatible with its impact ejecta origin. Aligned bigger clasts and smaller intercalated bands of sandstones, siltstones and clayey material indicate some local stratification obviously adjusted to flow processes within the impact ejecta curtain. This suggests that gravitational flows predominated in a transport by water in both liquid and gas states. Transport and deposition as a kind of pyroclastic surge are discussed. A sketch sequence describes the emplacement process of the Pelarda Fm. as 2 part of the Azuara crater formation and the integration in the general frame of pre-impact geology and some post-impact layering.\n\nThe Iberian System in NE Spain is characterized by a distinctive graben/basin system (Calatayud, Jiloca, Alfambra/Teruel), among others, which has received much attention and discussion in earlier and very recent geological literature. A completely different approach to the formation of this graben/basin system is provided by the impact crater chain of the Rubielos de la Cérida impact basin as part of the important Middle Tertiary Azuara impact event, which has been published for about 20 years. Although the Rubielos de la Cérida impact basin is characterized by all the geological, mineralogical and petrographical impact findings recognized in international impact research, it has completely been hushed up in the Spanish geological literature to this day. The article presented here uses the example of the Jiloca graben to show the absolute incompatibility of the previous geological concepts with the impact structures that can be observed in the Jiloca graben without much effort. Digital terrain modeling and aerial photography together with structural and stratigraphic alien geology define a new lateral Singra-Jiloca complex impact structure with central uplift and an inner ring, which is positioned exactly in the middle of the Jiloca graben. Unusual topographic structures at the rim and in the area of the inner ring are interpreted as strike-slip transpression and transtension. Geological literature that still sticks to the old ideas and develops new models and concepts for the graben/basin structures, but ignores the huge meteorite impact and does not even enter into a discussion, must at best cause incomprehension."
