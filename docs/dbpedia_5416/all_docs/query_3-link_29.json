        "text": "Climate change is negatively impacting human health and well-being (KM 15.1), cultural heritage, property, built infrastructure, economic prosperity, natural capital, and ecosystem services across the Southwest (Figure 28.1). Impacts include rising air temperatures2 and sea surface temperatures, both attributable in part to human activities;3 changes to the timing, form, and amount of precipitation;4,5,6 sea level rise and associated flooding events;7 increases in extreme heat events;8 summertime heat stress9,10 and heat-related mortality;11 surface and groundwater reductions;12,13,14,15,16 increased wildfire risks;17,18,19,20,21 and changes to ocean chemistry. These impacts pose heightened risks to overburdened and frontline communities and to Indigenous Peoples (KMs 4.2, 15.2, 16.1).\n\nSouthwest ecosystems transition from deserts and grasslands in hotter and lower elevations to forests and alpine meadows in cooler, higher elevations. The region supports important terrestrial and marine biodiversity and ecosystems, including the Sonoran Desert, the Sierra Nevada, and the Pacific Coast. The southern deserts commonly see temperatures between 105Â° and 115Â°F, and Phoenix has the hottest climate of all major US cities. The California coast stretches 3,400 miles (5,500 km), and its coastal wetlands provide critical habitat for fish and wildlife, protect water quality, and buffer against storms and floods.\n\nThe region is heavily urbanized, with 9 out of 10 people living in cities such as Albuquerque, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco. The region is also a major hub for software innovation, information technology, and semiconductor manufacturing. Californiaâs economy alone contributed more than $3.21 trillion (in 2022 dollars) to the US GDP in 2021, about 12% of the total US economy.22 The region also encompasses expansive rural areas with livelihoods centered on ranching, mining, agriculture, and tourism.\n\nIndigenous Peoples and Tribal lands are essential to the social, cultural, and geographic identity of the region. The Southwest is home to 182 Federally Recognized Tribes,23 as well as numerous state-recognized Tribes and Tribes seeking state or federal recognition. California has the largest number of Federally Recognized Tribes (109) and the largest Indigenous population of any state.23 Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah are home to seven of the most populous Tribes, ranging from 10,000 to more than 300,000 members. Nine Tribes in the Southwest are considered âlarge land-holding Tribes,â five of which are among the ten largest reservations in the US, ranging in size from 600,000 to 16 million acres. The largest US federal Indian reservationâthe 16-million-acre Navajo Nation Reservationâoccupies portions of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.\n\nThe Federal Government manages nearly half of the total land area of the region through national parks, forests, fish and wildlife reserves, military installations, and public lands.24 In Nevada, the Federal Government is responsible for managing more than 80% of the total acreage of the state.24 Thus, the Federal Government is central to adaptation and mitigation in the Southwest.\n\nOver the past five years, climate change impacts in the Southwest have become increasingly apparent and widespread.25 At the same time, understanding and modeling of how these impacts affect specific sectors and processes have improved. For instance, advances have been made in understanding and modeling of water,26,27,28 food and agriculture,29 wildfire,19 invasive species, biodiversity loss (KM 8.2), ecosystem transformations, human health,30 and human migration across the Southwest.31,32 Furthermore, research has advanced understanding and modeling of interdependencies, feedbacks, and cascading risks for interconnected systems (KM 18.1) such as the foodâenergyâwater nexus (KM 18.3).33,34\n\nTo address these climate change impacts, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private enterprises are increasingly responding with planning and actions to reduce current and future risks and increase adaptive capacity. Adaptation efforts that are effective, feasible, and justâincluding nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure for flood mitigationâhave been shown to reduce climate risk, increase resilience, and provide co-benefits to related societal goals (KM 8.3).35 There is an awareness of new approaches to equity and environmental justice for frontline communities, as well as Indigenous Peoples (KM 16.2) across the Southwest. These approaches recognize, protect, and apply diverse knowledge systems, including Indigenous Knowledges (KM 16.3). Social science has also improved our understanding of inclusive, participatory, and collaborative decision-making to solve problems in this region and beyond.36,37,38\n\nWhile this chapter focuses on climate impacts, risks, and adaptation actions in the Southwest, it also recognizes efforts underway to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (Figure 32.20) throughout the region at multiple scales. California, Colorado, and New Mexico are members of the US Climate Alliance, committed to reducing net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the Paris Agreement (KM 32.5). California has committed to carbon neutrality by 204539,40 and released a detailed plan with targets to achieve this goal,41 as well as augmenting funding across sectors.42 Both Colorado and New Mexico have statewide greenhouse gas reduction goals.43,44 At the local level, dozens of cities in all Southwest states are committed to emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement through the bipartisan Climate Mayors network (KM 32.5). For example, the Phoenix Climate Action Plan states that the city is on track to meet its goal of 50% reduction in GHG emissions (below its 2018 baseline) by 2030 and is committed to carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nDrought and Aridification\n\nThe Southwest region is historically arid and marked by episodes of intense drought and precipitation (KM 4.1).45,46 Climate change is exacerbating these conditions, as increasing temperatures are leading to hotter extreme heat events, drier soils, greater atmospheric evaporative demand, and reduced flows in major river basins such as the Colorado and Rio Grande.14,47,48,49,50 For example, between 1913 and 2017, annual average discharge from the Colorado River decreased by 9.3% for each degree Celsius of warming (Box 28.1).49 Additionally, since 2000 the Southwest has experienced an exceptional âmegadroughtââdefined as an episode of intense aridity that persists for multiple decadesâthat is recognized as the driest 22-year period in 1,200 years.51\n\nMountain snowpack is one of the most important sources of water in the Southwest, serving as a natural reservoir to supply water to drier, lower elevations for irrigated agricultural, municipal and industrial uses, and ecosystems (KM 4.1). Observed declines in western snowpack over the last century have been predominantly driven by warming trends,4 leading to smaller snowpack volumes, higher-elevation snow lines, and earlier snowmelt (KM 3.4).6,52 These processes are exacerbated by the deposition of dust and other light-absorbing particles on snowpack, which accelerates snowmelt.53 The resulting decrease in snow cover also reduces the albedo, or reflectivity, of the land surface, resulting in a positive feedback cycle that further increases solar radiation absorption, warming, and snowmelt.49,54,55 These changing snowpack dynamics are expected to have different influences on the timing and volume of snowmelt-driven streamflow in different basins,56 potentially disrupting the ability of existing water infrastructure, including hydropower, to meet the regionâs needs5,49 and altering ecosystem dynamics. Persistent low-snow years are projected to occur in the next half century if climate change continues unabated (Figure 28.2).5\n\nIn addition to extended periods of record-low precipitation, higher temperatures driven by climate change have increased evapotranspiration and reduced soil moisture, which can reduce the volume of runoff produced from a given amount of precipitation.16,47,50,59 These trends have negatively impacted natural resource management and agricultural production (KM 11.1) by increasing stress on vegetation.60 Coupled with increases in demand and subsequent water withdrawals, reduced streamflow has caused many of the regionâs lakes and reservoirs, such as the Great Salt Lake, to reach historically low water levels.61 Furthermore, greater variability in streamflow threatens the regionâs ability to consistently produce and use hydropower, impacting a typically reliable and low-carbon source of energy.62\n\nArt × Climate\n\nKatelyn Garcia\n\nThe Dust We Will Breathe\n\n(2022, inkjet print)\n\nArtist’s statement: The Dust We Will Breathe is a photograph of the drying lakebed of the Great Salt Lake, a graveyard of once underwater mounds made of microbial organisms. Human consumption is mostly to blame for the lake reaching historic lows, which is compounded by climate change and the westâs current megadrought. If no drastic changes in consumption are made, the lake will be gone in 5 years. Every day that more lakebed is exposed, we will breathe in more of its toxic dust.\n\nView the full Art × Climate gallery.\n\nArtworks and artists’ statements are not official Assessment products.\n\nClimate warming will also reduce groundwater recharge from rainfall, snowmelt, and runoff in some areas, thereby reducing groundwater storage.63,64 These effects are exacerbated by groundwater pumping to satisfy the needs of agricultural irrigation,65,66 which is the biggest consumer of fresh water in the region. The Central Valley aquifer of California is one of the most stressed aquifers in the world; during the 2012â2016 drought, about two-thirds of the valleyâs surface water deficit was due to groundwater pumping, which caused land subsidence (the gradual sinking of land) in some areas67 and declines in groundwater quality.\n\nFlooding\n\nDespite the regionâs increasing aridity, flooding from extreme precipitation events (KM 3.5) and snowmelt conditions (KM 4.1) also poses a threat to life and property, as well as to freshwater ecosystems.68,69 Due to climate change, snowmelt-driven flooding is expected to occur earlier in the year due to earlier runoff.70 Moreover, atmospheric rivers, which have driven much of historical flooding in the region, are expected to intensify under a warming climate.71,72 Flooding from sea level rise may also threaten water infrastructure and supplies in areas such as the SacramentoâSan Joaquin Bay Delta region.73,74\n\nDisproportionate Impacts\n\nCritically, the impacts of these climate-driven changes are experienced disproportionately by certain communities in the region, including Indigenous communities (KM 16.1). A lack of clean water and sanitation services in Indigenous communities came to national light in 2020 due to COVID-19, which spread 3.5 times faster among Indigenous than non-Indigenous communities in the initial stage of the pandemic,75 due in part to the lack of access to potable water in some Indigenous communities. A major impediment to water access is the cost of water infrastructure, which averages $600 per acre-foot of water for non-Indigenous families with piped delivery, compared to $43,000 per acre-foot of water for Navajo families relying on hauled water (no dollar year available).76,77 Furthermore, many Tribes in the region continue to lack access to water because their water rights have not been adjudicated through settlements or other processes, which could further exacerbate water shortages for other users.78\n\nOther examples of overburdened communities experiencing disproportionate water-related impacts of climate change include certain Black communities, which face disproportionately higher flood risk in Los Angeles,79 and Hispanic and low-wealth communities, which receive lower-quality drinking water80 and may be systematically excluded from water management processes (KM 4.3).81\n\nAdaptation Pathways\n\nIn response to these interrelated climate challenges, people across the Southwest have implemented adaptive water governance and management approaches. Examples include Californiaâs Sustainable Groundwater Management Act82 and various conservation and drought response measures in the Colorado River basin,37,38,83 which incentivize collaboration among diverse participants to develop innovative solutions (KM 12.4). Transitions toward more sustainable water management under climate change also include innovative infrastructure (e.g., enhanced aquifer storage, recharge, and recovery) and institutional practices (e.g., integrative land and water management practices, changes in rate structures, water sharing agreements, and reservoir operations).84,85,86,87 Social science studies in Southwest cities such as Denver, Phoenix, and Las Vegas indicate widespread support for innovative management strategies for urban water sustainability88 and opportunities for targeted educational interventions for demand management strategies based on residentsâ attitudes toward climate change.89 The extent to which these adaptation actions mitigate changes in water availability depends on interacting climate and social dynamics (KM 3.4).\n\nThe coastal region of the Southwest encompasses approximately 3,400 miles of coastline and nearly 70% of the stateâs 39.4 million people. Californiaâs 19 coastal counties employ more than 12 million people92 and in 2012 accounted for 80% of the stateâs GDP ($57.25 billion in 2022 dollars).93 Furthermore, California is showing leadership through adaptation actions nationally.\n\nOcean Extremes and Adaptation\n\nCalifornia coastal sea surface temperature has increased an average of 0.4Â°â0.6Â°F per decade since the 1970s94 and is projected to increase into the future under climate change (Ch. 2).95,96 Human-caused warming also contributes to marine heatwaves (Figure 28.4), or incidences of exceptionally warm ocean temperatures, which have already had significant impacts on human and natural systems (Box 10.1).97,98,99,100 The change in average cumulative intensification of MHWs for the entire US coast is presented in Figure A4.11. As the ocean warms, including in California coastal waters, MHWs increasingly exceed thermal limits of ecosystems, amplifying impacts99 including shifts in marine species composition,101 lower abundance and nutritional quality of important small prey fishes,102,103 and a potential influence on mass seabird mortalities and reproduction.104,105 Similarly, Tribal/Indigenous Traditional Knowledge demonstrates significant declines in five coastal species of cultural significance for the Tolowa Dee-niâ Nation, the Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria, the Wiyot Tribe, and the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council, a Tribal consortium of ten Tribal Nations.106 Such ecological changes disproportionately impact coastal communities and economies (KM 9.3),107,108,109 including cultural resources for Indigenous Peoples (KM 15.2).106,110 The 2014â2016 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave was followed by others in 2018111and 2019â2020.112 These MHWs can coincide with and contribute to other climate-related extremes such as drought100 and harmful algal blooms (HABs).113\n\nCommercial and recreational wild fisheries, as well as aquaculture (aquatic farming), will continue to be negatively affected by MHWs and HABs,107 resulting in severe economic ramifications.113,114,115,116 Extreme ocean warming events also have compound effects: an MHW contributed to the loss of more than 90% of Northern Californiaâs bull kelp, a foundational species for the ocean ecosystem, resulting in large economic losses in fisheries (Focus on Blue Carbon),117,118 including the red abalone, a species now listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Further, extreme eventârelated delays and closures disproportionately impacted smaller-scale fishing operations.119\n\nThe widespread impacts of MHWs and HABs underscore the need for effective adaptive approaches to fisheries management. While fishers in California are coping with MHWs by fishing in different areas or for different species,108 it will be challenging to manage fisheries in the long term under extreme warming events.115 Marine protected areas (MPAs), which are considered a management strategy for climate-driven ocean changes, may not buffer widespread effects of MHWs on species in southern California kelp forests.120 Adopting an ecosystem approach that considers multiple management options instead of one species in isolation121,122 appears to improve management under climate change.123 Applying a more coordinated disaster risk management approach to MHWs and extreme HAB events appears to correspond to better adaptive fisheries management, emphasizing the need for improving coordination and consistency across governing bodies, communities, and fishers on the frontlines (KM 10.3).124,125\n\nHuman-caused ocean warming coincides with increasing ocean acidification (OA) and declining oxygen levels (hypoxia) of the deeper, more nutrient-rich upwelled coastal waters. Under a very high scenario (RCP8.5), sardines, a commercially and ecologically important species, are predicted to move poleward, resulting in substantial shifts in catch.109,126 Under the same scenario, increased acidity due to the oceanâs chemical response to absorption of carbon dioxide is projected to increase the mortality of calcifying invertebrates (such as oysters and other bivalves), which are important to aquaculture and the food web, and result in a loss of food sources for some fishes and invertebrates.127\n\nPotential adaptation solutions include an ecosystem management approach to marine habitats and fisheries, as well as enforcing water and land-use regulations, which are expected to buffer some climate impacts.128 Protection and restoration of foundational eelgrass and kelp forests in California waters provides essential habitat, and these ecosystems can also improve local pH and oxygen conditions.129,130 The Fishery Ecosystem Plan adopted by Pacific Fishery Management Council in 2013 includes guidance on OA and hypoxia,128 but additional strategiesâsuch as flexible permitting, better coordination with fishing communities, and adaptable control rulesâmay be needed to improve outcomes.131 Nature-based aquaculture solutions, such as conservation and restorative aquaculture, also have potential to mitigate local OA impacts132,133,134,135 but are just emerging in California.136\n\nSea Level Rise Impacts and Adaptation Planning\n\nSea level rise (SLR) poses risks to the California coast through an increase in flooding, impacts from storm surges, and loss of coastal habitats and beaches (Figure 28.5; KM 9.1). Seas are projected to rise, on average, 0.79â1.25 feet for the California coastline by 2050, 3.10â6.63 feet by 2100, and 6.11â11.90 feet by 2150 (Intermediate to High scenario).7 California has more people living below 3.3 feet (1 m) of elevation than any other state except Louisiana;137 the population living in the mapped 100- and 500-year coastal floodplains increased approximately 10% from 2010 to 2020.137 SLR is also expected to exacerbate inequities in communities and result in compounding impacts, such as saltwater intrusion polluting groundwater.7,138,139,140,141,142,143 Furthermore, coastal Tribes in California are observing rising sea levels, which, when combined with the loss of kelp forests, are increasing the risk of coastal erosion, destruction of cultural artifacts, and limited access to traditional shoreline sites.110\n\nBy 2050, for all emissions pathways, SLR effects on tide and storm surge are expected to cause more frequent moderate to major high tide flood events, and coastal communities are already experiencing minor to moderate high tide flooding (KM 9.1).7\n\nCoastal energy and transportation infrastructure is expected to be negatively impacted by flooding from SLR. The projected inundation of energy substations in low-lying areas during storm events and from extreme SLR under a very high scenario (RCP8.5) is expected to cause electricity service interruptions to thousands of customers and increase maintenance and repair costs.139 Analysis of Californiaâs transportation fuel network found that docks, terminals, and refineries are most exposed to coastal flooding.143 The California Department of Transportation has begun adaptation planning efforts that consider a variety of strategies beyond hardening infrastructure, including nature-based strategies to limit the impacts of flooding (KM 8.3), as well as planning to avoid loss of coastal resources and access.144\n\nSea level rise and increased coastal flooding will disproportionately impact frontline communities (KM 9.2).145 The Toxic Tides project found that under a very high scenario (RCP8.5), SLR in California146,147 would result in increased flooding to over 400 industrial facilities and contaminated sites, including power plants, refineries, and hazardous waste sites, with 440 projected to be at risk of at least one flood event per year by 2100.148 Any flooding of hazardous sites would increase risks of contamination in surrounding frontline communities.149\n\nResidents of affordable housing, typically low-income communities, are especially vulnerable to SLR, with a greater percentage of affordable housing exposed to SLR than the general housing stock in some coastal states.140 California is in the top four states nationwide with the most units of affordable housing exposed at least four times per year to coastal flooding based on projected sea levels for the year 2050 under a very high scenario (RCP8.5).140 By 2050, California is also projected to see a 40% increase in the number of units at risk of flooding, compared to 2000.140 For affordable housing residents, flood risk is compounded by the threat of displacement due to rising property values and rents. Strategic city-level adaptation and resilience efforts, combined with community and infrastructure improvements, could protect these residents from potential displacement.140,150\n\nHigher seas are raising the coastal groundwater table, exposing communities to flooding from water that emerges from underground (KMs 9.1, 9.2).138,141 Communities in low-lying areas such as San Francisco Bay are most at risk, and areas with shallow coastal water tables are projected to see widespread flooding from groundwater emergence.138,141 Subsidence exacerbates this threat; coastal residents residing in subsiding locations experience an average relative sea level rise of up to four times faster than the global rate.142,151 These risks have not been well addressed in adaptation planning. Furthermore, the impacts and adaptation needs are expected to be higher than reported if only overland flooding due to SLRâwhich does not include flooding from subsidence or groundwater intrusionâis considered in community and infrastructure planning.142\n\nAdaptation planning for SLR as a field has advanced,152 as coastal managers have reported an increased concern regarding the threat of SLR and local, regional, and state governments in California apply climate science to decision-making (KM 9.3).153 California has instituted policies requiring consideration of climate change in state and local government decision-making and infrastructure planning.154,155,156,157 Specifically for the coast, there is guidance on how to apply SLR risk assessment and projections into planning, including specific guidance for critical infrastructure.158,159 This landscape of statewide policy and guidance is directly informing local coastal adaptation planning. Of 19 coastal counties, 18 have completed a vulnerability assessment, developed an adaptation policy, and/or updated the state-mandated safety elements of their general plans to include climate adaptation.160\n\nWhile adaptation planning along the California coast has advanced significantly, many of these efforts have not yet been implemented.160 This is partly because of financing and implementation challenges, especially for local governments that lack resources and must overcome institutional and governance issues (KM 31.5).152,161 Despite these challenges, California is ahead of many other parts of the US coast in employing adaptation strategies and appears to be well positioned for increased adaptation.152\n\nAcross the Southwest, annual average minimum air temperatures, growing degree days, and average number of days above 86Â°F (the threshold used to define heat zones) are projected to increase due to climate change.162 By midcentury under intermediate (RCP4.5) and very high (RCP8.5) scenarios, projections show longer growing seasons, a northward shift in plant hardiness zones, and expanded areas of heat stress exposure to crops and livestock (KM 11.1).162 In California, increasing temperatures are expected to affect the timing of cool-season annual crops and the location of warm-season annual crops.163 Warmer winters would be detrimental to the chilling requirements for orchard crops.164 In California, fewer cold snaps are expected to reduce crop exposure to frost;165 however, âfalse springsâ in the intermountain West are expected to increase vulnerability to late-season freeze events.166 During summer, a higher probability of heatwaves is expected (KM 2.2).167 The productivity of some economically important crops, such as upland cotton in Arizona, has already declined because of heat stress.168 While increased drought is the most prominent climate-driven risk to agriculture in the region, important farming areas such as Californiaâs Central Valley also face damage from occasional large floods caused by atmospheric river events.169\n\nImpacts to Farming\n\nFarmers and ranchers are particularly at risk from prolonged, severe drought (Figures 28.6, 8.6). Future temperature increases are expected to drive higher rates of evapotranspiration, increasing demand for fresh water for irrigation.168 The producers most vulnerable to local precipitation deficits are dryland farmers growing rain-fed crops and producers raising livestock on rangelands. Community-based snow-fed irrigation systems in high-elevation watersheds of New Mexico and Colorado, known as acequias, are particularly exposed to the shortfalls in annual snowpack.170 Under increasing aridity, agricultural practices such as fallowing and grazing on rangelands will need careful management to avoid increased wind erosion and dust production from exposed soils.171 Rising summer temperatures also degrade protective desert soil crusts formed by communities of algae, bacteria, lichens, fungi, or mosses, adding to airborne dust loads.172 The impacts of increasing aridity on agriculture are therefore twofold because dust deposits on mountain snowpack drive faster melting, depleting the snowpack173 and resulting in reduced surface water for irrigation. While just 22 of the 216 counties in the region are classified as âfarming-dependentâ by the USDA,174 agriculture is an important contributor to state and local economies and US food supply. California leads the Nation in agricultural cash receipts,175 primarily from fruits, nuts, and vegetables; direct farm sales to consumers; and farm expenditures.176 Climate change poses risks to both productivity and quality of fruit and vegetable products, requiring adaptations on farms and throughout the supply chain, including changes in crop calendars, nutrient and pest management strategies, post-harvest handling, and preservation methods.177,178\n\nReduced crop production due to climate change will carry major economic costs. Drought events have brought significant economic impacts on regional agriculture (KM 19.1); for example, the 2021 drought cost California farming sectors an estimated $1.28 billion (in 2022 dollars) and led to the loss of 8,745 full- or part-time jobs (KM 11.3).179 Modeling studies indicate that warming temperatures are expected to have a detrimental impact on the yields of almonds,164 wine grapes,180 and other high-value crops.169 Localized adaptation strategies include crop- and locality-specific combinations of irrigation, site management (e.g., use of cover crops and increased fallowing), and cultivar selection.181 Fallowing as a response to water shortages can bring its own challenges, such as increased dust and weed production, but it can also enhance ecosystem services such as groundwater recharge and improved ecosystem health.182\n\nClimate warming is likely to lead to larger, more frequent, and more severe outbreaks of bark beetles, negatively affecting the quality and quantity of timber available to the regionâs forestry and forest products industries.183 While wood products are minor economic contributors to the regionâs inland states, costs could be considerable in California, where the industry has been estimated to contribute $44.8 billion (in 2022 dollars) and 177,000 jobs (KM 7.2).184\n\nOver time, agricultural income in the region has become more dependent on crops than livestock.185 Because most Southwest croplands are irrigated, agriculture in the region had been thought to be less vulnerable to climate change than that in other parts of the country. However, future irrigation supply is uncertain as it depends on dwindling ground and surface water supplies (KMs 28.1, 4.1). For example, Arizona allows up to 73% of its water to be used for crop production,186 but the promise of continued irrigation water is less clear given the stateâs rapidly growing population and decreased flows in the Colorado River.187 Crop irrigation, mainly of alfalfa, accounts for three-quarters of consumptive water use in the Great Salt Lake basin, where cuts to irrigation use are advocated as the state seeks to prevent total depletion of the lake and associated environmental and public health impacts.188 Strategies to reduce irrigation water use include switching from gravity flow and sprinklers to more efficient systems,186 but the costs of conversion can be difficult for farmers when climate change is already reducing yields.185 Federal insurance programs can assist farmers after climate-related crop or forage loss, providing short-term economic relief from effects of extreme events.189 However, some research suggests that federal insurance programs provide a disincentive for farmers to adapt to climate change impacts.189 Non-climate-related stressors can influence the capacity of agricultural communities to adapt to climate impacts.29 On the plains of Colorado and New Mexico, most rural counties are depopulating due to persistent out-migration of young adults, straining social services and reducing tax revenues.190 Yet the Southwest also has some of the fastest-growing areas in the US, including high-amenity rural areas and cities expanding into agricultural zones.191 Urban expansion can increase cropland loss while simultaneously increasing the number of small farms focusing on specialty crops rather than basic commodities,192,193 placing greater pressure on the regionâs food supply as drought (KM 28.1)51 threatens agricultural production.194\n\nLivestock production is the dominant use of agricultural land in large areas of the Southwest where crop production is unprofitable or infeasible. Animal agriculture accounts for about one-third of agricultural revenue, with about 70% from cattle.195 Climate change is expected to reduce the sustainability of cattle production that depends on rangeland ecosystems.195,196 Negative impacts are expected on the entire livestock food supply chain, affecting production and nutritional quality of forage, livestock health on rangelands and in transport due to heat stress and pest exposure, and shelf life of products during transport and storage.197,198 Forage from Bureau of Land Management rangelands is expected to decrease in Arizona and New Mexico, but it is less certain whether rangeland forage will hold steady in the central and northern portions of California, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah due to differences in moisture availability during the growing season.197,199\n\nCascading Impacts of Climate Change to Agriculture\n\nThe cascading impacts of climate change in combination with urban population increases and other social and cultural factors pose an increasing threat to agriculture in the region.29 Urban growth in the Southwest has led to competition for water between farms and cities, mirroring global trends.200 Water transfers from rural to urban areas have been a feature of the Southwest for decades, often with negative consequences for rural and low-income communities.201,202 To meet water demands for a growing metropolitan region while preserving irrigated croplands, Colorado is experimenting with water policy innovations designed to encourage rural-to-urban transfers while minimizing impacts in rural areas, but adoption has been slow due to distrust on the part of agricultural communities and uncertainty about trade-offs.202 Market forces in California have encouraged growers to shift to crops with a high economic value but also a large water footprint, such as tree nuts203,204 and legal cannabis.205\n\nFrontline Communities and Food Insecurity\n\nFrontline communities including Hispanic populations, women farmers, migrant farmworkers, and Indigenous Peoples face challenges to water access in their homes as well as food security and health (KM 4.2).201,206,207 For example, the 2012â2016 drought in Californiaâs San Joaquin Valley disrupted farmworkersâ employment and reduced food security, water security, and health.208 Mental health risks are also increasing as farmers and ranchers report moderate to severe levels of anxiety about climate change and the need to adapt.209 First-generation and women ranchers are disproportionately vulnerable to climate impacts because of limited experience with drought and weaker connections to rancher networks.210\n\nLow-income urban communities are expected to be among the first to suffer food insecurity as climate change reduces the regionâs food production. Strategies have been proposed to produce more food in urban settings, but these foods often do not reach low-income consumers, who have less access to food distribution systems and often cannot afford to pay the higher prices such foods often command.211 Indigenous Knowledge has been proposed as a significant resource for climate change adaptation (KM 16.3).212,213 Because people in the Southwest have adapted to drought impacts for millennia, employing Indigenous Knowledge can allow the region to serve as a âlaboratoryâ for future climate-adapted food systems214 while enhancing food sovereignty.215\n\nAdaptation for Agriculture\n\nAdaptation solutions exist for ranching operations,196,216 but social and economic barriers, such as distrust of experts, the financial costs and time commitments of innovation, and adherence to tradition, have slowed information uptake.199 Climate change information is not routinely incorporated into ranchersâ risk management decisions217 and only recently has become a priority in federal agency rangeland management plans.197\n\nPeople across the Southwest are exploring technological adaptations to climate impacts (KM 31.3). Adaptive conservation management approaches that focus on minimizing soil disturbance while maximizing soil cover, biodiversity, and the presence of living roots have been gaining traction with farmers through practices such as cover cropping and reduced-tillage and no-till farming (KM 11.1).218,219 Combined with reduced tillage, cover cropping improves soil structure, organic carbon content, and infiltration and water-holding capacity in irrigated cropland220 and positively impacts nutrient cycling, crop yield, and soil water conservation in limited-irrigation, semiarid cropping systems.221,222 However, some farmers and ranchers, such as those who operate on small acreages, often find it hard to access the resources to transition practices or may perceive the risks of change to be too great, including financial expense and the perceived need to learn new skills.223\n\nIrrigation efficiency can reduce risks to farming and ranching operations due to increasing temperatures, unreliable precipitation, and reduced water resources. However, access to these solutions can be complicated due to farm or ranch location, access to surface water and groundwater, water rights, current irrigation methods, and crop types.224 In the Verde Valley of Arizona, limited access to materials, equipment, and financial resources, especially for small-scale producers, inhibits their ability to respond to water-related challenges.224 Indigenous Peoples face barriers in accessing support from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) related to land tenure, financial assistance, institutional mismatches, and complexities in incorporating Indigenous agricultural methods in applications for NRCS programs.225,226\n\nExtreme Heat Impacts\n\nSince 2018, 31 large climate- and weather-related disasters have affected the Southwest, resulting in more than 700 fatalities and estimated damages totaling $67.3 billion (in 2022 dollars).2 Strong evidence indicates that extreme heat disproportionately impacts the health of frontline and overburdened communities in the region (KM 15.2), including the unhoused,227,228,229 outdoor workers, and migrant farmworkers (Figure 28.7; KM 11.2),230,231,232,233 as well as those with low income8,234 and older adults.235 Between 2016 and 2020, 7,687 hospitalizations in the Southwest were due to heat and heat-related illnesses, in comparison to 5,517 in the previous five years (2011 to 2015).236 Pre- and post-natal exposure to high heat and air pollution are shown to be particularly dangerous in the region.237,238,239,240\n\nExtreme heat and high-ozone days in the region are expected to increase under climate change (KMs 2.3, 3.5).241 These changes are expected to increase heat and air-pollution exposure, illness, and premature death.242 Intensified aridity from higher temperatures and drought is expected to lead to more dust storms243 and more than double the number of deaths attributed to fine dust by 2080â2099 under a very high scenario (RCP8.5), relative to 1986â2005 (KM 6.1),244 with increasing exposures for outdoor workers during the warm season. The incidence of coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) in the region has increased (Figure 15.2)245 and is associated with higher air temperatures and drier soils,246,247 with greater risk to those whose job requires dirt disruption. The annual average cost to the US economy of Valley fever for the 2000â2015 baseline was $4.8 billion per year (in 2022 dollars), which is projected to increase 390% by 2090 under a very high scenario (RCP8.5; Figure 15.2).248\n\nExtreme heat exposure also affects the economy through decreased productivity and well-being in outdoor workers (Figure 28.7),249,250,251 especially among migrant agriculture workers in the region (KM 15.1).252,253 Impact estimates to productivity provided in Figure 28.7 are projected to result in a loss of 25% of the workday on all days in the third quarter (JulyâSeptember) under a very high scenario (SSP5-8.5) by the end of century and cause important losses to the economy (KM 19.1). Dehydration due to working outdoors in extreme heat in California is linked to acute kidney illness even after a single day of exposure.254 Research into the mechanisms of chronic kidney disease related to climate change is ongoing, yet occupational heat exposure is a causal factor.255\n\nAir Quality and Health Impacts\n\nWhile the annual average level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has seen decadal decline in the region due to strengthened air quality policies reducing emissions from controllable sources, disparities in PM2.5 exposure and related health concerns remain high in the region.260 Moreover, the frequency and severity of smoke events with PM2.5 exceedances of federal air quality standards have increased significantly due to wildfires (Figure 14.3). Since 2015 in Northern California, the annual average PM2.5 has increased because of wildfire events, which have taken over as the main source of PM2.5 exceedances.261 PM2.5 in wildfire smoke contributes to adverse health effects for firefighters262 and the public263,264 and can be more hazardous to health than similar levels of particulates from other sources.265 The costs of adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes can exceed the billions spent on wildfire suppression (KM 28.5).266 Chemicals in wildfire smoke also correlate with increased cancer risk.267 Direct exposure to the 2018 Camp Fire in California has been linked to mental health disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.268 Wildfires can also cause other public health impacts, including water contamination when fires damage water distribution infrastructure,269 long-term loss of access to clean drinking water,270 and increased landslide risks (KM 28.5).\n\nFlooding and Disease\n\nIncreases in flooding in the region are projected with continued warming.271,272 These changes increase risks of water-borne diseases and exposure to toxic hazards and place stress on food, energy, and water supplies, as well as farmworkersâ health (including interconnected sectors) and their socioeconomic insecurity.39 Flooding exposures may increase as a greater proportion of the population across the region, on average, is living on 100-year floodplains (e.g., in California, between 1990 and 2020, 25,000 more people lived on 100-year floodplains).137 Flooding can also interrupt vector-control programs, such as for West Nile virus.273 The region is seeing challenges with West Nile virus, particularly in Arizona and California,274 with projected increases due to changes in the climate, human population, and mosquito distribution (KM 24.3).275,276\n\nImpacts to Outdoor Workers\n\nLimited occupational health and safety standards for farmworkers and other outdoor workers are of key concern, as intensifying wildfires and heat collide with harvest season each year, particularly for undocumented Latino/a and Indigenous migrants.231 The improvement of these standards at the state and national levels will be critical for health adaptation to climate impacts in the region. Moreover, the harm to farmworkers due to wildfire smoke is expected to be greater than previously thought, bolstering the argument for additional research and policies to help safeguard overburdened and stigmatized populations.277 Many Southwest cities experienced high rates of economic and population growth during the second half of the 20th century, particularly between 2015 and 2019.31 The regionâs flourishing economy and proximity to the Mexican border result in a high influx of migrants.278,279 Migrants from Central America, spurred to migrate due to climate change in addition to poverty and violence (KM 17.2), are drawn by the Southwestâs strong economy and increase the number of vulnerable people and change the demographics in the region. Local, state, and federal efforts to both mitigate climate change and support essential human adaptation to increasing exposures will be vital in protecting the health of a growing and aging population and our most vulnerable communities (Figure 28.8; KM 15.1).280\n\nDemographic Shifts Related to Climate\n\nThe effects of climate change on other regions of the worldâespecially Central Americaâare changing the Southwestâs demographics. Decreasing agricultural productivity, increasing levels of food insecurity, and adverse climate effects are among the main reasons why people emigrate from the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) to the US (KM 17.2).32,279 In 2021, 42% of Central American immigrants to the US lived in the Southwest region,282 and about 43% of immigrants apprehended at the Southwest border in 2019 originated from the Northern Triangle.278 Many are poor, women, children, or Indigenous Peoples. Climate-related migration has been shown to affect peopleâs physical and mental health, resulting from exposure to weather extremes, disruption of social ties, and overcrowding of health systems in the host communities.283\n\nAdaptation Efforts for Health\n\nSeveral programs have been developed to address the health impacts of climate change in the region, but financial constraints and political support affect their implementation.284 Since 2010, the CDCâs Building Resilience Against Climate Effects program in Arizona and California has developed and implemented strategies to protect communities from climate-sensitive hazards, including schools, healthcare facilities, and other at-risk populations.285 This program, currently in 10 cities across the country, has developed important resources and programs that can be scaled up for future climate resilience efforts. To protect the health and learning of school children, the Arizona Department of Health Services created new heat policy guidance, resulting in recommendations for school heat safety and adaptation strategies.286,287 In California, San Mateo County assessed asthma burden connected to local climate issues.288 Public health guidance in the region should focus on co-exposures to heat and wildfire smoke in adaptation efforts,289 particularly given the projected increase in childhood asthma due to wildfires.290 While data on private sector investment is limited, the private sector has historically lacked incentives to invest in adaptation (KM 31.6). Globally, in 2017â2018 only 1.6% of all adaptation financing came from the private sector.291 In the Southwest, however, certain sectors, such as insurance, came under pressure from the local authorities to get involved in tackling climate change by divesting their fossil fuelâbased investments.292\n\nFire is a natural process in many ecosystems across the Southwest and is necessary for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and nature-based solutions (KM 8.2). Fire regimes associated with fire-dependent ecosystems are highly variable with elevation and across geographies.293 Long-standing policies and forest managementâincluding fire suppression, widespread logging and livestock grazing, and elimination of Indigenous fire useâcombined with the effects of a changing climate, have contributed to high tree densities, compromised ecosystem function, and the diversity, or heterogeneity, of forest attributes such as species, size classes, and geographic distributions.18,21,294,295,296 Consequently, many Southwest forests and fire-prone wildlands are susceptible to climate-mediated impacts including droughts, pests and disease (Box 7.1), and devastating wildfire.295,297 An abundance of scientific research strongly suggests that Southwest ecosystems, in the face of rapid climate changeâinduced transformation, will require active management interventions that increase forest heterogeneity and enhance ecosystem function and adaptive capacity (KM 7.3).298,299,300\n\nHuman-induced warming temperature trends, changes in precipitation patterns, and increases in vapor pressure deficit have driven the desiccation of fuels that influence wildfire patterns and behavior across the western US (KM 7.1).17,18,19,20,21,440 In the Southwest, fires have become larger, more frequent, and, in many areas, more severe (KM 7.1), with clear evidence of climate change as a major cause.301,302 Seven of the ten largest US wildfires in 2020â2021 occurred in the region. Of the 50 largest US wildfires in 2020, 22 occurred in California, and the 7 largest wildfires recorded in California have occurred since 2018.303,304,305 The three largest wildfires recorded in Colorado occurred in 2020; the largest fires in Nevada history burned in 2018;306 and the largest wildfires in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah all occurred since 2007 (Figure 28.9; Focus on Western Wildfires). Large fires on non-forested western US rangelands also increased more than fivefold during the period 1984â2017.307 Much of this increase is driven by increases in invasive annual grass cover, caused partly by climate change and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.308\n\nImpacts on Ecosystems\n\nClimate change causes cascading effects with other factors in Southwest ecosystems that are otherwise fire-adapted. For example, large areas of high-severity fire have driven ecosystem type conversions in many parts of the region.294,309 Semiarid to arid forest systems are particularly vulnerable to these effects and have experienced conversion to native grassland,310 shrubland, or non-native grassland (Figures 28.9, 8.6).294 The cumulative effects of fire-driven ecosystem changes continue to place ecosystems at high risk of vegetation type conversion (e.g., forests to shrublands), which can result in severe impacts on watersheds and aquatic resources.294 Effects include degradation of riparian systems; risks to riparian and riverine species, as well as to threatened and endangered species, from erosion caused by extreme precipitation events; and increased invasions by non-native species.311\n\nRecent climate-induced aridification, including loss of snowpack, has also hindered postfire tree seedling and shrub establishment, limiting ecosystem recovery.312,313,441 This is particularly true of postfire conditions for water availability, quantity, and quality. Moreover, interactions between wildfire and natural drought variability are expected to increasingly exacerbate dry conditions that will further stress tree seedlings314 and drive potential future shifts in species composition or vegetation type.312,315 Conversions of coastal shrublands driven by human development also have interacted with climate-induced drying of vegetative fuels to generate atypical fire conditions.316\n\nProjections of future climate change suggest that wildfire activity will continue to affect ecosystems and their services.298,317,318,319,320 Specific ecosystem responses to climatic changes will depend on interactions among vegetation type, moisture stress, disturbance regimes (e.g., pests, pathogens, and high-severity fire), and human land-use changes (KM 6.2).295,297,317 For example, climate change is predicted to lead to a loss of sagebrush ecosystems in the southern and eastern Great Basin because those ecosystems are less able to recover after fires in a warmer, drier climate.321\n\nHowever, future wildfire trends are less certain in rangelands than in forests because fire size (measured by annual area burned) and severity (a shift from low-intensity fires to stand-replacing crown fires) depend on production of aboveground vegetation that varies annually with climatic conditions.322 Growth of the grasses that typically fuel wildfires is expected to decrease in Arizona and New Mexico,199,323 whereas elsewhere in the region, precipitation is projected to increase early in the growing season, which, when followed by hotter summers, will generate conditions ideal for fire ignitions.322\n\nImpacts on People and Communities\n\nClimate-related increases in the frequency, severity, and extent of wildfires in the Southwest are endangering lives and property (Focus on Western Wildfires).17,18,19,20,21,324 Complete data across the region on wildfire-caused fatalities are sparse,325 but three of the five deadliest fires on record in California have occurred since 2017, costing 122 lives.303 Further, loss of life can be attributed to wildfire smoke, which has also been linked to increases in COVID-19 fatalities in Northern California326 and postfire debris flows that can leave slopes bare of vegetation and vulnerable to rapid erosion (Ch. 7; Focus on Western Wildfires).327 The risk of postfire debris flows in coastal communities is expected to increase due to an increase in heavy precipitation typically delivered by atmospheric river events (KMs 28.1, 8.1).328\n\nProperty losses due to wildfire are greatest in the Southwest compared to other regions. In 2021, 3,363 structures burned due to wildfires in California, the highest number lost in any state, while the December 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado, a fast-burning grassland fire, burned more than 1,000 homes in just a few hours.305 The 2022 Calf Canyon/Hermitâs Peak Fire that burned 341,735 acres is New Mexicoâs largest fire. Secondary impacts of wildfire, such as postfire debris flows (Figures 3.13, 6.5) on recently burned slopes, impose additional hazards to property.327 The estimated cost of fighting the 10 largest California wildfires in 2021 exceeded $2.25 billion (in 2022 dollars),305 with suppression costs representing only a fraction of a total economic impact that also includes loss of structures and infrastructure, increased medical costs, crop losses, water quality contamination, and other factors (KM 19.1).\n\nArt × Climate\n\nJulia Lauer\n\ncalifornia\n\n(2020, paper, ink)\n\nArtist’s statement: 'california' is a five-layer reductive woodcut that depicts an immense blaze trailing from a mountain range to a burning house. The piece was born in response to the California wildfires. The contrast between the bright flames and the dark sky is representative of the dramatic change between El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a years, which have a cyclical influence on fire in the region. The burning house speaks to the impact wildfires have on people, while the burning plains and mountains comment on the effect fire has on the planet.\n\nView the full Art × Climate gallery.\n\nArtworks and artists’ statements are not official Assessment products.\n\nThe increase in structures and infrastructure lost can be linked to population growth in the wildlandâurban interface (Figure A4.14), where houses are built close to forests and other natural areas.329 The number of Americans living in the WUI doubled from 1990 to 2010, and the WUI population has risen fastest in areas such as the Southwest where wildfire risk is greatest.330,331 While migration to WUI counties shows modest reductions immediately after wildfire or extreme heat events,332 fires do not seem to drive current residents away; fewer than 6% of Sonoma County, California, residents who lost homes to wildfires in 2017 subsequently left the county.333\n\nImpacts of fire on community livelihoods depend on exposure to wildfire risk and capacity to adapt (KM 7.3). Analysis of livelihood vulnerability in 14 fire-prone states found that New Mexico and Arizona residents were most vulnerable due to relatively high risk exposure and low to moderate access to resources needed to adapt to changing conditions.334 Low-income areas, communities of color, undocumented Indigenous migrants, sexual and gender minorities (KM 15.2),335 and unsheltered persons are most vulnerable to wildfire impacts,231,336 including water contamination from carcinogenic compounds.269 Populations with medical disabilities or limited mobility, older adults, and those who rely on medical equipment are also disproportionately at high risk during wildfires.337\n\nWildfires, moreover, often occur during farm harvest seasons, increasing health risks for workers.277 Southwest industries especially vulnerable to wildfires include wineries,338 tourism,339,340 forest products,183 and legal cannabis cultivation.341 For example, in the 2020 fires, the economic impact of smoke taint is estimated to have cost the California wine industry $4.2 billion (in 2022 dollars). Smoke taint occurs when smoke and ash permeate the skin of grapes and can affect the taste and smell of wine.342\n\nImpacts of wildfire on natural environments can affect ecosystem services (KM 7.2) that people derive from those environments, including air quality (KM 28.4),266 water quality and availability,343 pollination,344 livestock forage and health,345 and outdoor recreation.346 Ecosystem service effects vary over time as short-term declines in services can be followed by improvement over a longer term as ecosystems recover.347 Wildfires in forested ecosystems chemically alter watersheds and can reduce drinking water quality,348 in some cases leading municipalities to issue drinking water advisories.349 Postfire hazards such as floods and debris flows further threaten water security (Focus on Western Wildfires).350 Smoke from the 2020 wildfires significantly reduced industrial solar energy production in Southern California.351\n\nWhile high-severity wildfires (i.e., stand-replacing fire) generally have negative impacts, wildfires and prescribed fires that burn at low to moderate severities can have positive effects by reducing fuel loads, curtailing plant pests and diseases, and stimulating new vegetation growth.352 Prescribed burning, while an effective tool to reverse undesirable changes in forest vegetation structure due to fire suppression, can also reduce air quality in the short term.266\n\nEcosystem Management Challenges and Adaptation Solutions\n\nForest resilience may be enhanced by thinning trees, leveraging low- and moderate-severity wildfires with traditional forest management treatments that adjust fuels, and better incorporating managed wildfire.299 Using prescribed fire in conjunction with mechanical forest treatments, such as thinning or pruning, also reduces tree densities and fuels.300 Prescribed fire can increase forest resilience during periods of climate-related stress, such as sustained drought,353 and can reduce the extent and intensity of the wildfire regime.354 Cultural fire use to meet Indigenous and Tribal objectives can be compatible with traditional fire application and help advance increased resilience to climate change.296,355\n\nTo decrease competition for water resources and increase forest resilience, reductions in tree density and fuels can lower the risk of high-severity wildfires and drought- and pest-induced mortality (KM 6.2).356,357 Recent evidence suggests that increasing these approaches can help adapt to the rapidly increasing risks.299,358 However, the implementation of prescribed fire may be curtailed due to public concerns about smoke and fires that escape management prescription.359\n\nNatural lands, including forests and associated woodlands, play a central role in mitigating climate change (KM 32.1).360,361 However, climate variability, drought- and pest-driven tree mortality, wildfire, and other disturbances suggest that the Southwest will see a continued decline in terrestrial carbon storage.360,362 As a result, securing or even increasing ecosystem carbon storage is often an objective for forest management investment.363 Forest management treatments differ in their short-term carbon losses relative to the expected benefits of greater fire resistance, which leads to longer-term carbon stability (Box 7.2). In Southwest forests, reducing thinning area and increasing the area burned enhances the potential for a net carbon benefit when compared to no action.364 Reforesting areas where forest cover was lost due to mortality can help mitigate the effects of climate change,365 but planting additional trees that increase forest density would result in elevated fire risk and drought stress and therefore is not expected be an effective adaptation solution.300,366\n\nOther adaptation solutions include power shutoff policies by utilities to reduce wildfire risk when extreme wind events are predicted to topple powerlines and telecommunications infrastructure.367,368,369 Power shutoffs are more likely in autumn due to a climate-related increase in the number of days with extreme fire weather.18 Power shutoffs may also increase homeownersâ intention to adopt solar power370 or fossil fuelâpowered generators.371 Individuals who experienced shutoffs reported poorer physical and mental health immediately after the occurrence, yet they still supported the use of shutoffs as a wildfire risk-reduction strategy.372"
