        "text": "The Oued Ouadrane constitutes the lower course of the Oued Lben, one of the most important streams in central Tunisia. It flows through topography of low plateaus and plains and its mouth is situated between Sfax and Gabès facing the Kneiss archipelago. A geomorphologic study of the different terraces and deposits found along the thalweg and their dating with archeological and radiometric methods was accomplished together with the reconstruction of recent geomorphological dynamics, especially those related to the evolution of valleys, in the study area. In addition to its chronological significance, the archeological data shed light on the human history of this natural environment and its constraints during the last 8000 years. The area contains, in fact, the remains of different civilizations from the Capsian and Neolithic to the Roman. The interest of the site is also due to its geographical location as it occupies a transitional position between the semi-arid and arid zones. The area is a coastal area characterized by a very low topography with extensive sebkhas. These saline environments are very vulnerable to sea level variations and allow us to understand their effects on recent landscape dynamics. INTRODUCTION: THE GENERAL CONTEXT AND METHODOLOGY The lower course of the Oued Ouadrane is situated in the eastern part of the Tunisian steppes, between Sfax and Gabès facing the Kneiss archipelago. It flows through an area characterized by a semi-arid Mediterranean climate and a low and monotonous topography; low plains and plateaus are the predominant forms in the general morphology. This monotony is locally interrupted by some relatively well marked hills although their altitudes rarely exceed 150m. The geological context also presents few variations. The dominant parts of the topography are almost everywhere constituted by the Segui Formation dating from the Mio-Pliocene and characterized by its thick clay, sand and gypsum rocks. The plains are essentially formed by recent Quaternary alluvium. The plateaus, which occupy an intermediate position, constitute residual forms and correspond most often to the remains of rock terraces generally covered by gypsum or calcareous crusts similar to those attributed to the middle and lower Quaternary in other Tunisian areas. The studies related to the recent evolution of this area, especially during the Holocene and Historical periods, are very rare and essentially concern with the coastal fringe. As for the continental part, some important research has been carried out along the Oued Lben, but in areas situated relatively far inland. In fact we don't know of any important publication entirely focused on this period making use of the geomorphological features and the extensive, rich and varied archeological data to reconstruct the landscape evolution and changes in environmental conditions. The latter aspects are given major attention in the present paper. The method essentially used in field surveys has a geoarcheological approach. The laboratory is used essentially for analyses to determine the age of the deposits and the archeological artifacts associated with them. The area has been divided into two parts respectively situated upstream and downstream of the bridge built on the National Road number 2 (R.N.2). The location of this bridge marks a notable modification in the general landscape; it coincides with a sudden narrowing and deepening of the valley accentuated by the existence of a hilly topography aligned perpendicular to the river channel. In the upstream section the area displays a depression that is relatively well circumscribed, especially on its southern side, by a more or less continuous chain of hills and buttes resulting from the erosion of the plateaus. The lowest parts are characterized by a very regular plain, rarely broken by occasional sand dunes or localized gullies. Important and marked irregularities accompany the main wadi's channel, which degraded its floor at least a few meters hence the banks expose many interesting geological sections. Downstream from the bridge, the morphology is, on the contrary, dominated by an open and very low alluvial plain scarcely incised by the wadi and its small tributaries. Along the coastal fringe the topography displays flatness to the greatest degree. The landscape is characterized by the presence of very extensive flat saline areas (sebkhas) and the shoreline gives way to a very shallow sea. The continental platform is very extensive, situated at a depth frequently less than one meter, dissected by many important tidal channels and emerges substantially at low tides. The latter characteristics are particularly marked along the coast facing the small and very flat islets of the Kneiss archipelago which scarcely emerge from a wide and very shallow shoal (Fig. 1 a, b)."
