        "text": "Near the city centre of Hasselt is the Clarissenklooster, a convent with a long brown brick wall, a small bell tower and a greyish roof. A convent without nuns, priests or masses. It was built in 1902 and the last four sisters left for the monastery in Genk in 2004. Since then, the building has been protected as a monument and later, in 2013, it became one of the many multifunctional churches of the monastery\n\nThe worker in charge of managing the chapel’s uses, Catherine Lefevre, explains that the monastery is now used as an old people’s home; as a café; as a place to do yoga; and that the chapel has a variety of functions: from hosting wedding banquets or meetings to allowing people from the retirement home to do activities there.\n\nBelgium, a country that became independent from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands because of its Catholic sentiment and not wanting to belong to a Protestant country, now transforms its churches into cafes, bookshops, hotels, supermarkets, circus schools, art galleries, and so on.\n\nIn Maastricht (Netherlands), for example, the former Dominicanenkerk church is now one of the most beautiful bookshops in the world. The high ceilings make it possible to create several floors with shelves full of books and in the lower part, where the altar used to be, people now drink coffee. In Ghent, part of the church of St. Nicholas, one of the most important churches in the city, is now used as an art gallery.\n\nWhy does this happen? According to a study carried out by professors at the University of Leuven, in 2004 only 9% of residents in Flanders attend mass. It is believed that the number of people going to church for religious reasons will continue to decrease, but at a slower rate. The graph shows that in the latest surveys the percentage of people attending mass is 9%.\n\nChurches and convents were becoming empty and at the same time they required a great deal of money to maintain them and to protect the historical and religious heritage. For this reason, a transformation of the churches was started so that they could have a second life.\n\nThe process of carrying out this transformation is complex and is carried out by diocese institution supported by the Flemish government called Parcum, situated at the abbey of Park near Leuven. This diocesan organisation specialises in religious heritage. One of its functions is to advise during the transformation of churches.\n\nParcum worker Julie Aerts explains that the process of transforming a church starts with the creation of a Pastoral Plan that indicates whether only a part of the church will be adapted for other non-religious activities or whether the whole building will be used.\n\nThis is followed by the development of a church policy plan involving the municipal council and the church boards. The development of the plan often also involves the citizens of the community giving their opinion or ideas on the new use of the church. Finally, the bishop and the city council will be responsible for approving the plan and putting it into operation.\n\nCitizen surveys are a very important part of the process, as the aim of the transformation is to bring the unused building back into use and thus ensure that new generations can also use it.\n\n73% of churches in Flanders are used for non-liturgical activities according to the book Atlas van het religeus erfgoed in Vlaanderen (Atlas of the religious heritage of Flanders). This graph represents the churches with non-liturgical activities in Flanders. Blue means that non-liturgical activities take place in these churches, red means that no non-liturgical activities take place in these churches and green means that the data is unknown.\n\nSome countries would be shocked that any of their churches were to be used for non-religious activity. In Belgium, however, such cases are common. In Flanders more than half are used for non-religious activities. The churches were gradually emptied of priests, nuns and Catholics and filled with books, cafés, teachers and people."
