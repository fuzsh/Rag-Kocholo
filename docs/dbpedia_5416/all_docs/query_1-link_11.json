        "text": "The Pelarda Formation (Fm.), located in the Iberian System in northeast Spain, is a sedimentary deposit with an extension of roughly 12 km x 2.5 km and an estimated thickness of no more than 400 m. The formation was first recognized as a peculiar unit in the early seventies and underwent interpretations like a fluvial or an alluvial fan deposit having a postulated age between Paleogene and Quaternary. Since the early nineties the Pelarda Formation has been considered an impact ejecta deposit originating from the large ca. 40 km-diameter Azuara impact structure and meanwhile being among the largest and most prominent terrestrial impact ejecta occurrences, which however is questioned by regional geologists still defending the fluvial and alluvial fan models. Roughly speaking, the Pelarda Fm. is a grossly unsorted, matrix-supported diamictite with grain sizes between silt fraction and meter-sized clasts and a big intercalated megablock. Strong clast deformations and abundant shock metamorphic effects like planar deformation features (PDF) are observed throughout the Pelarda F. deposit compatible with its impact ejecta origin. Aligned bigger clasts and smaller intercalated bands of sandstones, siltstones and clayey material indicate some local stratification obviously adjusted to flow processes within the impact ejecta curtain. This suggests that gravitational flows predominated in a transport by water in both liquid and gas states. Transport and deposition as a kind of pyroclastic surge are discussed. A sketch sequence describes the emplacement process of the Pelarda Fm. as 2 part of the Azuara crater formation and the integration in the general frame of pre-impact geology and some post-impact layering.\n\nIn an abstract paper presented at the EPSC 2022 Granada (Europlanet Sociey) the authors above from Spain, Sweden and Denmark report about research on what they called the first impact structure in Spain. Numerous media reports about this “first impact structure in Spain” immediately after the meeting suggest that this formulation was directly put into the world by the authors in a press release and that they thereby commit a bad falsification by not mentioning the worldwide prominent gigantic Azuara impact event with the 40 km-diameter Azuara impact structure and the Rubielos de la Cérida impact basin measuring approx. 80 km x 40 km, which has been established for more than 20 years, and, hence, declaring it as non-existent. We report here on key stages of the study of these really first Spanish impact structures since 1985, comment this massive expression of scientific dishonesty, and bring for all less informed and the media-believing people a compilation of the innumerable extremely easily in the Internet accessible contributions in English, Spanish and German, which leads the statement of the alleged first impact structure in Spain ad absurdum.\n\nWe report on the Azuara impact structure and its Rubielos de la Cérida companion crater, which establish the largest terrestrial doublet impact structure presently known. Both structures have diameters of roughly 35 - 40 km and they have been formed in a purely sedimentary target. From stratigraphic considerations and palaeontologic dating, an Upper Eocene or Oligocene age is very probable. Geological mapping has established abundant geologic impact evidence in the form of monomictic and polymictic breccias and breccia dikes, megabreccias, dislocated megablocks, remarkable structural features, extensive impact ejecta and impact signatures even in distant autochthonous deposits. The most striking impact evidence for both structures is given by strong shock metamorphism, including melt and diaplectic glass, planar deformation features (PDFs), different kinds of impact melt rocks (from former silicate melt, carbonate melt, carbonate-phosphate melt) and suevite breccias. Glassy amorphous carbon particles in a solid C-O compound may be related with fullerenes and may originate from a quenched melt of extremely shocked coal or from extremely shocked limestones. It is assumed that the impact had considerable influence on the Mid-Tertiary regional geology of the Iberian System, and we suggest that respective geologic models which have so far not considered this peculiar and far-reaching event, need considerable revision."
