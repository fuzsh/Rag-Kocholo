        "text": "Azuara is a town and municipality in the province of Zaragoza, in the autonomous community of Aragón (Spain). It is located in the foothills of the Iberian System, 603 m s. n. m., located in the bed of the Cámaras River, a tributary of the Aguasvivas River, just 16 km from Belchite, 13 km from Fuendetodos and 60 km from Zaragoza.\n\nIn its municipal area is the archaeological site of La Malena.\n\nBasic data\n\nEminently agricultural town in the depressed region of Campo de Belchite, of its 16,800 ha, 80% are dryland.\n\nAzuara is crossed by the Cámaras River, which suffers frequent, and long, dry spells due to the water regime of the area, with rainfall of barely 400 liters/year. However, the river plain is a unique landscape icon in the Belchite area.\n\nIn the same way as the majority of towns in Aragon, Azuara suffers from a clearly differentiated population variable, therefore, in summer it can reach close to 1,500 inhabitants and in winter it may not exceed 500. The strong promotion of sporting and cultural events developed throughout the winter allow the population to \"breathe\" during the weekend allowing its demographics to increase by 40%.\n\nThe economic activity of the area is based on two sectors, the primary one, in which dryland agriculture and livestock farms (pig, sheep and poultry) stand out, and the services in which numerous commercial and hospitality establishments stand out..\n\nThe recent implementation of a cement production plant provides the municipality with a secondary sector.\n\nToponymy\n\nThe term Azuara comes from the Arabic زوارة, AZ-ZUWARA, name of the Berber tribe Zuwara Zuwara Berber of Libya. It is proposed by Juan F. Utrilla, when exposing the Arabic etymology of many of the towns in the region: \"… Almochuel (ibn Manchuel, 'the descendant of Mochuelo', Romance nickname), Azuara (Zuwara) and Letux (Yegg Lettoreg) are also indicative of their Andalusian occupation. Four of these place names, Nepza, Letux, Lagata and Azuara, lead us to formulate the hypothesis that Berber tribal settlements occurred in the region – tribes of the Nafza, Letoregg, Luwata and Zuwara –, clients of the Umayyads, and settled in the second half of the 8th century to control the madina of Zaragoza itself and its surroundings. These were, without a doubt, strategic settlements that would also dominate, and through the installation of related clan groups - such as the Banu Gazlun and Banu Amira, also belonging to the Nafza clan, and installed in the nearby lands of Teruel and Villel, or the Banu Razin, settled in the Sahlah, the corridor that linked Zaragoza with Valencia, through the Belchite-Montalbán-Teruel secondary route, and linked to the Molina-Guadalajara-Toledo axis. (The Campo de Belchite in the Middle Ages 8th-15th centuries: from Muslim to Christian settlement. Juan F. Utrilla Utrilla).\n\nHistory\n\nThe first reference we have to the territory in history starts from the Celtiberian city of Beligium. Dating back to about 2,200 years ago, the city of Beligium was one of the strongest settlements of Celtiberian domination in the area. With a population of 10,000 inhabitants and the ability to mint silver and bronze currency, Beligium was a \"encumbrance\" for Rome who did not hesitate during the Sertorian wars to raze the city and destroy it in order to avoid later conflicts and regroupings. From that time we have vestiges such as a \"kalato\" of Phoenician origin and a bronze helmet in perfect condition. Continuous spoliation attacks and lack of protection have destroyed most of the \"metal\" that kept the area intact. However, Beligium is possibly one of the largest preserved cities in Spain.\n\nOnce the area was devastated, the Roman Empire was divided into cities and towns, the latter of which we know were agricultural and livestock farms dominated by a \"patrician\" and that sometimes it could even have its own army. In the plain of the Cámaras River is the town of La Malena. It is a late Roman, late-imperial villa of 5000 m², its rooms open around a central atrium with a pond. The town of La Malena had 42 rooms, hot springs, kitchens, heating and drainage, all this gives us to understand that the town of La Malena was one of the most \"rich\" known, only comparable to those found in Italy.\n\nIf something stands out from the network of rooms and reveals the richness of the villa, it is that around 40% of it is decorated with polychrome mosaics with geometric and plant motifs, in them we can find marine fauna, swastikas, etc... however, of all of them, the most important is the one dedicated to 'the wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia', in the representation, Zeus presides over the wedding ceremony with Athena and Poseidon as godparents and with the protection of the 34;Cabilos\" founding brothers, together with Cadmus, of the city of Thebes. Escorting this mosaic are four quarters, including \"the coronation of Antiope\" Surely in La Malena you will find the richest concentration of music in Spain.\n\nThe Visigothic invasions ended the Roman Empire, however the life of the towns did not change since only the barbarian military model was implemented. This would explain the attempts at \"reconstruction\" of some mosaics using patches and \"patches\". The town could have been impoverished or, in its case, re-inhabited by a Visigoth soldier.\n\nWith the arrival of the Islamic empire, Azuara was founded as a municipality and equipped with a walled enclosure with access to four portals. It is these same ones who create an irrigation network brought from Arabia and lay the foundations that would turn Azuara into a town of some magnitude in the future. The period of Muslim rule in the area extends until 1120, when Alfonso I occupied the area indefinitely.\n\nIn the year 1248, by privilege of James I, this place was separated from the dependence of Daroca, becoming part of Sesma de Trasierra in the Community of Villages of Daroca, which depended directly on the king, this administrative regime lasting. until the death of Fernando VII in 1833, being dissolved in 1838.\n\nFrom the medieval Azuara we know that it was a rich and self-sufficient town, which never belonged to any nobleman and was always considered Villa de Realengo. In front of the community, it was the capital of the Sesma de Trassierra and contributed illustrious notaries to the capital Daroca. Of the periods of greatest splendor, Nicolás Lobato stands out, a sculptor of the 15th century span> who, among his works, directed that of the; Sillero del Pilar & # 34; and Domingo Royo, accomplished albeytar who wrote \"Lave de Albeyteria\" in which the first transfusions of blood and organs on animals were defined. The current veterinarians continue studying with the foundations established by Domingo Royo.\n\nDemography\n\nPopulation change in the municipality between 1991 and 2021 2021 2016 2011 2006 2001 1996 1991 544 576 702 657 667 759 830\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nAmong the plants that grow in the fields of Azuara, the following stand out: oyster mushroom and poplar mushroom, rock tea or Aragon tea, fennel (up to 2 meters high), thyme and head poplars.\n\nAmong the fauna that lives in the fields of Azuara, the following stand out: praying mantis (medium-sized insect, its head can rotate 180°; very aggressive towards its species), bat, common pigeon, great turkey (the largest insect from Europe; it is believed that it scares its predators by pretending to be an owl; its life is very short, barely a week), salamander or gecko (this animal has gone from being practically extinct to forming large colonies), common toad (it has glands behind the eyes that secrete a substance to defend itself from its enemies; if it is in danger it plays dead by turning face up), partridge (one of the most typical and appreciated birds), shrew (the smallest mammal on the peninsula Iberian; despite its appearance it is very voracious and can eat several times its weight daily; it is very difficult to see), ibex (along the Piquete de la Atalaya), tiger spider (named for its black and yellow abdomen; its large size makes it unmistakable), dragonfly (insect valuable as a predator, controlling mosquito populations), buzzard (bird that feeds on small mammals and occasionally fruits), crayfish (the native one is in danger of extinction due to the loss of its habitat, contamination of the water of the rivers where it lives and the introduction of the American crab), swallows (they have their nests on numerous roofs in the town), vervet, goldfinch or cardelina (at the moment it is a protected bird), wolf spider (one of the largest spiders on the Peninsula, typical of arid climates; has eight eyes arranged in three rows), hoopoe (with a long beak and crest that opens when alert or in danger), fox, vulture (in Azuara there is a vulture roost along the Cámaras River), owl, wild boar, goshawk, common rabbit, ferret and marten (medium-sized carnivorous mammal that lives along the river bank).\n\nHeritage\n\nRoman Villa of La Malena\n\nArab wall\n\nTypical Aragonese home\n\nParish Church of Our Lady of Pity\n\nRomanesque hermitage of St. Nicholas of Bari, inside polychrome mural paintings.\n\nFridge\n\nUnderground passages\n\nCeltic City of Beligium\n\nNassar, son of Abderraman I, Provincial Museum of Zaragoza\n\nImpact structure of Azuara\n\nRiver Valley Cameras.\n\nHarinera de San José (Industrial Archaeology)\n\nAdministration and politics\n\nLast mayors of Azuara\n\nPeriodMayorParty 1979-1983Antonio Gracia LaportaUCD1983-19871987-1991Santiago Serrano AnsónPSOE1991-1995 1995-1999José María Corzán TomásP1999-2003 2003-2007Joaquín Ignacio Alconchel FletaPSOE2007-2011 2011-2015 2015-2019 2019-\n\nElection results\n\nMunicipal electionsParty20032007201120152019PSOE5 5 5 3 5 P2 2 2 3 2 PAR- - - 1 - Total77777\n\nCharacters"
