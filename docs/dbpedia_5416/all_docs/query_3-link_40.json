        "meta_description": "Objective To explore the presentation behaviours and pathways to detection of adults who first presented to UK hospital eye services with severe glaucoma.\n\nDesign Semistructured interviews, based on models of diagnostic delay, to obtain a descriptive self-reported account of when and how participants’ glaucoma was detected.\n\nResults 11 patients participated (five in Aberdeen, six in Huddersfield). Four participants reported that the optometry appointment at which their glaucoma was detected was their first ever eye test or their first for over 10 years. Seven participants reported attending regular routine optometrist appointments. Their self-reported experiences and pathways to detection describe a variety of missed detection opportunities and delayed referral and treatment.\n\nConclusions The qualitative data suggest that late detection of glaucoma can result from delays at the patient level but, although based on a small sample, delays also occurred at the healthcare provider (system) level both in terms of accuracy of case detection and effective referral. We suggest that current attempts to address the significant burden of over-referral of glaucoma suspects to hospital eye services (a large proportion of which are false positives) must also focus on the issue of false negatives and on reducing missed detection and service delays.",

        "text": "Delay in seeking care\n\nParticipants had difficulty recalling how long it took for them to notice a problem with their eyesight. Nevertheless, accounts from all four patients who did not regularly attend optometry services included reports of noticeable changes in vision being the stimulus to making a non-routine optometry appointment that led to their glaucoma being detected and immediate referral to hospital eye services. I started having blurry…running eyes…I noticed occasionally it would be cloudy…I was in [supermarket] one day so I just went to the optician and said I need glasses, so when the guy test my eye…they referred me up to the eye clinic. (P01) I went to the optician thinking I was needing glasses for the TV… I never wore glasses in my life…I thought well I'm getting on in age, I thought I was needing reading glasses. (P05)\n\nFor one participant, it was the work supervisor rather than the participant who first noticed a problem and arranged an optometrist appointment. [Supervisor suggested] I go for an eye test as there's something wrong. I was shocked, I said I can see properly…I don't think I need an eye test, I don't use glasses… my Supervisor called the optician in the [shopping] centre…he made an appointment. (P03)\n\nDetection delay\n\nThe main ‘trigger’ for glaucoma detection in participants who reported attending regular routine optometry appointments was a change in optometrist or a General Practitioner (GP) appointment. Participants’ narratives provided compelling accounts of detection delay. It was detected when the optician looking after me at the time retired and somebody came to take his place and said I think that you have glaucoma… it was on my records for quite a number of years … getting more noticeable. (P07) It was picked [up] initially when I attend[ed] for a routine [appointment] at my Optician, but he was a new Optician to me…he was the first person who took a photograph of my retina…he wasn't happy with my optic discs… he did visual field tests that confirmed that I had big areas in the upper outer quadrants completely blacked off which I was totally unaware of… he reckoned I'd probably had it for about 4 or 5 years. (P02) The woman [optometrist] said I had cataract in one eye…next year I went back and the cataract was slightly worse…I had to stop driving, because I couldn't cope with the sun …so I went to the doctor [GP]…he thought that the cataract was bad so he referred me to the cataract clinic and the doctor there said I'd had it [glaucoma] a long time, it was well advanced...she referred me to the Glaucoma clinic and I was told that I had severe glaucoma in both eyes. (P04)\n\nA few participants described reporting symptoms to optometrists during routine appointments that in retrospect they found significant, but which their optometrist did not attribute to glaucoma and which had not led to timely detection. I've been going to the same Optician for several years, about 8 or 9 years… I said that I'd had headaches, severe headache across my left eye…she said well there's nothing wrong with your eyes…you may have a migraine. (P04) …from 1994 onwards I was reporting that this eye hurt, it felt like [I] had been thumped… and I kept saying this so every time he [optometrist] was saying to me ‘anything to report’ my answer to that grew… I also reported trouble with night glare…I reported more problems with general glare…I thought I was doing the right thing, going to the optician, reporting these symptoms; I was having problems with night driving and the headlight glare and so on so…I said I used to be fine with it but I'm not anymore…So the list was growing, but he didn't write a thing down…In about March 2002 I fell over…I fell again, and this time I fell and I smashed me face and did myself quite a big injury and I went to [named chain of optometrists]…I explained all these symptoms to them…Then she [different optometrist] examined my eyes and she said there was nothing the matter with them…when I came out of [chain of optometrists] in 2002 when she told me, she'd explained away all me symptoms…I came out and I said to myself, I actually gave myself a talking to and said, you're getting older, you're going to have to learn to accept that this is what ageing is, is like. Why do you expect to have young eyes all the time? (P06)\n\nIt is worthy of note that the quote above comes from a patient (P06) who reported that her father and grandmother were blind from glaucoma and that in 1992 her optometrist noted an optic disc haemorrhage in her right eye. I'm the third generation in a row to go blind with this now…I knew glaucoma was a slow advancing disease and I'd been going to the Optometrist since I was 8…therefore in all those years I expected them to have noticed something (P06)\n\nAsked when and how her glaucoma was detected she states: Late on, when 95% of the optic nerve had been destroyed, in both eyes… In 2003, they [optometrist] did the visual fields and they did the photograph of the retina…they said they were referring me to a doctor because the back of my eyes was a bit of a mess…there's been a massive collapse of the visual fields. (P06)\n\nService delay\n\nPatients’ referral pathways from optometry detection to specialised eye service appointment varied by location. In Scotland, participants reported being referred directly to specialist services by their optometrist, while in England, referral from optometry to hospital eye services, as reported by all participants, had to be via their GP.\n\nTwo participants (P09 and P04) were initially referred to cataract clinics before being redirected, with minimal delay, to specialist glaucoma services. Waiting times for the initial cataract appointments were reported as 2 weeks and 5 months, respectively. One patient reported having ocular hypotensive therapy initiated at the cataract clinic. …she [ophthalmologist at cataract clinic] said that I [had] severe glaucoma…she did say that if the pressure hadn't come down [with ocular hypotensive therapy] I wouldn't have been able to go home…I was in from 12.30 until about 4 o'clock. (P04)\n\nFor other participants, waiting times between optometry referral and attendance at specialist glaucoma clinics varied from a couple of days to 4 months. However, it is not possible to ascertain from these data whether waiting times reflected the availability of specialist appointments per se (eg, minimum waiting time for all referrals) or the details of the referral (eg, the level of urgency communicated by optometrists or GPs). So when I went to my GP, which was very quickly after that eye examination within 3 or 4 days. He remarked how he was surprised to see me so quickly and he referred me to the hospital…with the glaucoma specialist but I was marked in a ‘no urgency’ level so it was actually 15 weeks when I saw somebody. (P06)"
