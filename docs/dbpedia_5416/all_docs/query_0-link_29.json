We sought to compare prevalence and determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) between tuberculosis patients in Baja California, Mexico, and Hispanic patients in California. Methods. Using data from Mexicoâs National TB Drug Resistance Survey (2008â2009) and California Department of Public Health TB case registry (2004â2009), we assessed differences in MDR-TB prevalence comparing (1) Mexicans in Baja California, (2) Mexico-born Hispanics in California, (3) US-born Hispanics in California, and (4) California Hispanics born elsewhere. Results. MDR-TB prevalence was 2.1% in Baja California patients, 1.6% in Mexico-born California patients, 0.4% in US-born California patients, and 2.7% in Hispanic California patients born elsewhere. In multivariate analysis, previous antituberculosis treatment was associated with MDR-TB (odds ratio [OR]â=â6.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]â=â3.34, 12.96); Mexico-born TB patients in California (ORâ=â5.08; 95% CIâ=â1.19, 21.75) and those born elsewhere (ORâ=â7.69; 95% CIâ=â1.71, 34.67) had greater odds of MDR-TB compared with US-born patients (reference category). Conclusions. Hispanic patients born outside the US or Mexico were more likely to have MDR-TB than were those born within these countries. Possible explanations include different levels of exposure to resistant strains and inadequate treatment.

The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) breeds and haul-outs on islands and the mainland of Baja California, Mexico, and California, U.S.A. At the beginning of the 21st century, numbers of elephant seals in California are increasing, but the status of Baja California populations is unknown, and some data suggest they may be decreasing. We hypothesize that the elephant seal population of Baja California is experiencing a decline because the animals are not migrating as far south due to warming sea and air temperatures. Here we assessed population trends of the Baja California population, and climate change in the region. The numbers of northern elephant seals in Baja California colonies have been decreasing since the 1990s, and both the surface waters off Baja California and the local air temperatures have warmed during the last three decades. We propose that declining population sizes may be attributable to decreased migration towards the southern portions of the range in response to the observed temperature increases. Further research is needed to confirm our hypothesis; however, if true, it would imply that elephant seal colonies of Baja California and California are not demographically isolated which would pose challenges to environmental and management policies between Mexico and the United States.\n\nCalifornia-Baja California border master plan - plan maestro fronterizo California-Baja California : technical appendix.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2008-09-01\n\nUnder the direction of the U.S. / Mexico Joint Working Committee, the California Department of : Transportation (Caltrans) and the State of Baja Californias Secretariat of Infrastructure and Urban : Development (SIDUE) hereby establish the Califor...\n\nIslas Marias Archipelago, Mexico. A Missing Piece to Reconstruct the Paleoposition of Baja California\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaaf, P. E.; Pompa, V.; Hernandez, T.; Weber, B.; Solis, G.; Villanueva, D.; Perez-Venzor, J.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nPaleopositions for southern Baja California peninsula have yielded controversial models over the past 30 years. Mainly based on paleomagnetic data many hypotheses place Baja at lower paleolatitudes in front of southern Mexico or Central America with subsequent northward translations. Other models suggest minor, if any, northward displacements with respect to continental Mexico combined with clockwise rotations. Lithological, geochemical, and geochronological similarities for southern Baja California and Puerto Vallarta (western Mexico Pacific margin) igneous rocks seem to confirm the latter model. To further prove this model we have mapped and collected rocks from Maria Madre, the largest island of the Islas Marias archipelago, located in the mouth of the Gulf of California. In an area of only 145 square kilometers, metamorphic basements rocks (ortho and migmatitic gneisses), highly deformed metasediments, granitoids, acid to intermediate volcanic sequences, and a cover with gently folded marine sediments are exposed. The basement complex with gneisses and metasediments, including garnet-bearing paragneiss and calc silicates, as well as the granodioritic-tonalitic intrusives display an extraordinary accordance with similar units observed in the Los Cabos Block (LCB) of Baja California Sur. Furthermore, U-Pb zircon ages of 162 and 170 Ma for the basement gneisses and of 80 Ma for the granitoids have been reported also from the LCB. Additionally, upper Cretaceous intrusive ages are well known from the Puerto Vallarta batholith in Jalisco and Nayarit, mainland Mexico. Geochemical and isotopic data as well as Nd model ages confirm a magmatic consanguinity of LCB, Islas Marias, and Puerto Vallarta granitoids. The volcanic units of Maria Madre Island include ignimbrites and effusive dacitic-rhyolithic rocks, which can be correlated to the Sierra Madre Occidental province and the ComundÃº Formation of Baja California. Age determinations are under work to confirm this\n\nGEMINI-9 - EARTH SKY - NORTHWESTERN MEXICO, BAJA CALIFORNIA\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1966-06-05\n\nS66-38070 (5 June 1966) --- Northwestern Mexico as seen from the Gemini-9A spacecraft during its 32nd revolution of Earth.

These dates can be assigned to the well-documented late Pleistocene oxygen-isotope stage 5e high sea stand. Differences between the eustatic and present elevations of this terrace indicate average uplift rates since terrace formation of approximately 4 to 5 cm/1000 yr, indicating a relative stability and lack of major vertical deformation since the late Pleistocene.moreÂ Â» This terrace in the Mulege area can now be correlated with other marine terraces throughout the Baja California peninsula and southern California.Â«Â less\n\nA possible connection between post-subduction arc magmatism and adakite-NEB rock association in Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCastillo, P. R.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nLate Miocene to Recent arc-related magmatism occurs in Baja California, Mexico despite the cessation of plate subduction along its western margin at ~12.5 Ma. It includes calcalkaline and K-rich andesites, tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites, alkalic basalts similar to many ocean island basalts (OIB), magnesian and basaltic andesites with adakitic affinity (bajaiites), adakites, and Nb-enriched basalts (NEB). A popular model for the close spatial and temporal association of adakite (plus bajaiite) and NEB in Baja California is these are due to melting of the subducted Farallon/Cocos plate, which in turn is caused by the influx of hot asthenospheric mantle through a window created in the subducted slab directly beneath the Baja California peninsula [e.g., Benoit, M. et. al. (2002) J. Geol. 110, 627-648; Calmus, T. et al. (2003) Lithos 66, 77-105]. Here I propose an alternative model for the cause of post-subduction magmatism in Baja California in particular and origin of adakite-NEB rock association in general. The complicated tectonic configuration of the subducting Farallon/Cocos plate and westward motion of the North American continent caused western Mexico to override the hot, upwelling Pacific mantle that was decoupled from the spreading centers abandoned west of Baja California. The upwelling asthenosphere is best manifested east of the peninsula, beneath the Gulf of California, and is most probably due to a tear or window in the subducted slab there. The upwelling asthenosphere is compositionally heterogeneous and sends materials westward into the mantle wedge beneath the peninsula. These materials provide sources for post-subduction tholeiitic and alkalic magmas. Portions of tholeiitic magmas directly erupted at the surface produce tholeiitic lavas, but some get ponded beneath the crust. Re-melting and/or high-pressure fractional crystallization of the ponded tholeiitic magmas generate adakitic rocks. Alkalic magmas directly erupted at the surface\n\nPaleomagnetic Quantification of Neogene Block Rotations within an Active Transtensional Plate Boundary, Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeber, J.; Umhoefer, P. J.; PÃ©rez Venzor, J. A.; Bachtadse, V.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nCompared to oceanic plate boundaries which are generally narrow zones of deformation, continental plate boundaries appear as widespread areas with complex and poorly understood kinematics. Motion of crustal blocks within these âdiffuse plate boundariesâ causes rather small-scale lithospheric deformation within the boundary zone, while the main plates behave more rigid. Complex deformation patterns of interacting terranes separated by a variety of active faults are the consequence. To study the dynamic implications of boundary zone deformation, the southern part of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico (Baja) has been chosen as target for a detailed paleomagnetic study. In combination with geodetic measurements it is tried to characterize rigid block rotations and temporal changes in rotation rates. Up to now, little paleomagnetic work directed toward vertical axis rotations has been done in Baja California, despite its location in a major active transtensional zone. To address this problem, a total of 501 cores from 63 sites in the southern part of Baja - including sites on San JosÃ© Island, San Francisco Island and Cerralvo Island - has been taken from volcanic and sedimentary rocks covering the last 25 million years in time. The analysis of paleomagnetic declinations and comparison to coeval data from North America and stable areas of Baja California allow evaluating the long-term kinematics of the region and the effects of oblique-rifting in the Gulf of California to the east. Nearly all sampled sites indicate vertical axis rotation up to 30-40 degrees with an average of about 20-25 degrees. Depending on the location these rotations have been either clockwise or counter-clockwise and are correlated with the opening of the Gulf of California and the translation of the Baja California peninsula to the North. Results of the paleomagnetic investigation are compared to geodetic data of the last few years in order to address the problem how strain is partitioned\n\nPaleoenvironmental interpretation of section of Rosario Formation in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTellez-Duarte, M.A.; Ferman-Almada, J.L.\n\nIn contrast to previous interpretations of the Rosario Formation in other parts of Baja California, a stratigraphic section 6 km north of Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, contains evidences for deposition in shallow waters during a regressive event in a steep slope basin. Among the sedimentary evidence, the section shows a coarse, shoaling-upward sequence, with high-angle cross-stratification and planar bed lamination. Load structures with a westward orientation were found only at the base. The fossils assemblages support the same shoaling-upward interpretation as the sedimentary evidence, with ammonoids and deposit feeder trace fossils (such as Chondrites) at the bottom to mollusks andmoreÂ Â» suspension feeder trace fossils (such as Scolicia and Ophiomorpha, characteristic of shallower waters) at the top. This sedimentologic and paleontologic evidence suggests nearshore to beach coastal deposits. The contact between the section and a discontinuous thin limestone bed at the top of the section shows an unconformity. The absence of well-preserved fossils makes this limestone difficult to date, but the lithology is similar to that of Paleocene Sepultura Formation limestones.Â«Â less\n\nA Weather Analysis and Forecasting System for Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFarfan, L. M.\n\n2006-05-01\n\nThe weather of the Baja California Peninsula, part of northwestern Mexico, is mild and dry most of the year. However, during the summer, humid air masses associated with tropical cyclones move northward in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Added features that create a unique meteorological situation include mountain ranges along the spine of the peninsula, warm water in the Gulf of California, and the cold California Current in the Pacific. These features interact with the environmental flow to induce conditions that play a role in the occurrence of localized, convective systems during the approach of tropical cyclones. Most of these events occur late in the summer, generating heavy precipitation, strong winds, lightning, and are associated with significant property damage to the local populations. Our goal is to provide information on the characteristics of these weather systems by performing an analysis of observations derived from a regional network. This includes imagery from radar and geostationary satellite, and data from surface stations. A set of real-time products are generated in our research center and are made available to a broad audience (researchers, students, and business employees) by using an internet site. Graphical products are updated anywhere from one to 24 hours and includes predictions from numerical models. Forecasts are derived from an operational model (GFS) and locally generated simulations based on a mesoscale model (MM5). Our analysis and forecasting system has been in operation since the summer of 2005 and was used as a reference for a set of discussions during the development of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones. This basin had 15 named storms and none of them made landfall on the west coast of Mexico; however, four systems were within 800 km from the area of interest, resulting in some convective activity. During the whole season, a group of 30 users from our institution, government offices, and local businesses received daily information\n\nAgave turneri (Agavaceae), a new species from northeastern Baja California, Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWebb, Robert H.; Salazar-CeseÃ±a, J. Mario\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAgave turneri, a new species of Agave from the Sierras CucapÃ¡ and El Mayor in northeastern Baja California, Mexico, is a medium-sized species that does not produce offsets, has a relatively short and narrow panicle, and has a distinctive flower structure. The closest relatives to this new species are Agave moranii, which occurs approximately 200 km to the south of the type locality, and A. deserti var. simplex, which occurs in Arizona and California. This new species is a narrow endemic restricted to specific granodiorite and tonalite habitats in a hyperarid environment. Agave turneri appears to be a critically endangered owing to its habitat preference for specific types of granite in the Sierra CucapÃ¡, threats due to prolonged drought and global change, and its close proximity to the Mexicali metropolitan area.\n\nA new species of Ceanothus from northern Baja California\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBoyd, Steve; Keeley, Jon E.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nCeanothus bolensis S. Boyd & J. Keeley is a new species in the subgenus Cerastes from northwestern Baja California, Mexico. It is well represented at elevations above 1000 m on Cerro Bola, a basaltic peak approximately 35 km south of the U.S./Mexican border. It is characterized by small, obovate to oblanceolate, cupped, essentially glabrous leaves with sparsely toothed margins, pale blue flowers, and globose fruits lacking horns. Principal components analysis on morphological traits shows it to be distinct from other members of Cerastes which are distributed away from the coast in southern California and Baja California, Mexico. These phenetic comparisons also suggest that Ceanothus otayensis should not be subsumed under C. crassifolius, as treated in the Jepson Manual, but rather should be retained at specific rank as well.\n\nTectonic analysis of Baja California and Parras shear belt in Mexico\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbdel-Gawad, M. (Principal Investigator); Tubbesing, L.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nThe author has identified the following significant results. Geological correlation of terrain across the Gulf of California using ERTS-1 imagery revealed significant similarities between Isla Tiburon, Isla Angel de la Guarda, and the San Carlos Range in mainland Mexico. ERTS-1 imagery was used to check the validity of the existence of major trans-Baja fault zones. ERTS-1 imagery also shows that high albedo sediments similar to known late Tertiary marine sediments are widespread in southern and middle Baja and extend in places to the eastern side of the Peninsula. Major faults in northern Mexico and across the border in the United States were mapped, and ample evidence was found that the Parras and parts of the Texas lineament are belts of major transverse shear faults in areas outside the supposed limit of the Texas and Parras lineaments. A fundamental concept which may help explain many complexities in the tectonic development is beginning to emerge: The southwestern part of North America was torn by massive left-lateral shear of transverse trend (east-west) during the compressive stage of the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic. This tectonic style has changed into tensional rifting (Basin and Range) and right-lateral shear later in the Cenozoic and Quaternary.\n\nReview of Neopalpa PovolnÃ½, 1998 with description of a new species from California and Baja California, Mexico (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nNazari, Vazrick\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe monotypic genus Neopalpa was described in 1998 by Czech entomologist Dalibor PovolnÃ½ based on two male specimens from Santa Catalina Island, California, which he named Neopalpa neonata .

A whole genome sequencing strategy was used to obtain the molecular fingerprints of 172 isolates of M. bovis obtained from Baja California, Mexico; 155 isolates were from cattle and 17 isolates were from humans. Spoligotypes were characterized in silico and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences between the isolates were evaluated. A total of 12 M. bovis spoligotype patterns were identified in cattle and humans. Two predominant spoligotypes patterns were seen in both cattle and humans: SB0145 and SB1040. The SB0145 spoligotype represented 59% of cattle isolates (n=91) and 65% of human isolates (n=11), while the SB1040 spoligotype represented 30% of cattle isolates (n=47) and 30% of human isolates (n=5). When evaluating SNP differences, the human isolates were intimately intertwined with the cattle isolates. All isolates from humans had spoligotype patterns that matched those observed in the cattle isolates, and all human isolates shared common ancestors with cattle in Baja California based on SNP analysis. This suggests that most human tuberculosis caused by M. bovis in Baja California is derived from M. bovis circulating in Baja California cattle. These results reinforce the importance of bovine tuberculosis surveillance and control in this region. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Twenty-one sandy beach sites were sampled to investigate the occurrence and distribution of microplastics on the sandy beaches of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, as well as their spectroscopic characterization and morphology. Microplastics were separated using the density method and identified using Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The mean abundance of microplastics in the samples was 135â¯Â±â¯92 particles kgâ1, and fiber was the most abundant microplastic found in the samples, comprising 91% of the total microplastics identified. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis of the microplastics showed that the main polymers found in microplastics were polyacrylic, polyacrylamide, polyethylene terephthalate, polyesters, and nylon.\n\nReconnaissance geologic map of the Loreto and part of the San Janier quadrangles, Baja California Sur, Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMcLean, Hugh\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe Loreto area of Baja California Sur, Mexico, contains a diverse association of igneous, sedimentary, and metasedimentary rocks exposed in the foothills and arroyos between the Sierra La Giganta and Gulf of California. The Loreto area was selected for this study to examine the possible relation of the marine rocks to the opening of the Gulf of California, and to determine the stratigraphic and structural relations between basement rocks composed of granitic and prebatholithic rocks and overlying Tertiary (mainly Miocene) sedimentary and volcanic rocks, and by a sequence of Pliocene marine and nonmarine sedimentary rocks. The Pliocene marine rocks lie in a structural depression informally called here, the Loreto embayment. This geologic map and report stem from a cooperative agreement between the U.S. Geological Survey and the Consejo de Recursos Minerales of Mexico that was initiated in 1982.\n\nCrustal Structure of Southern Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, and its Margins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGonzalez, A.; Robles-Vazquez, L. N.; Requena-Gonzalez, N. A.; Fletcher, J.; Lizarralde, D.; Kent, G.; Harding, A.; Holbrook, S.; Umhoefer, P.; Axen, G.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nData from 6 deep 2D multichannel seismic (MCS) lines, 1 wide-angle seismic transect and gravity were used to investigate the crustal structure and stratigraphy of the southern Baja California peninsula and its margins. An array of air guns was used as seismic source shooting each 50 m. Each signal was recorded during 16 s by a 6 km long streamer with 480 channels and a spacing of 12.5 m. Seismic waves were also recorded by Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) in the Pacific and the Gulf of California and by portable seismic instruments onshore southern Baja California. MCS data were conventionally processed, to obtain post-stack time-migrated seismic sections. We used a direct method for the interpretation of the wide-angle data, including ray tracing and travel times calculation. In addition to the gravity data recorded onboard, satellite and land public domain data were also used in the gravity modeling. The combined MCS, wide-angle and gravity transect between the Magdalena microplate to the center of Farallon basin in the Gulf of California, crossing the southern Baja California Peninsula to the north of La Paz, allows to verify the existence of the Magdalena microplate under Baja California. We have also confirmed an extensional component of the Tosco-Abreojos fault zone and we have calculated crustal thicknesses. We have also observed the continuation to the south of the Santa Margarita detachment. The MCS seismic sections show a number of fault scarps, submarine canyons and grabens and horsts associated to normal faults offshore southern Baja California peninsula.

Wild populations of blue (Haliotis fulgens) and yellow (H. corrugata) abalone have experienced unusual mortality rates since 2009 off the peninsula of Baja California and WS has been hypothesized as a possible cause. Currently, little information is available about the genetic diversity of CXc and particularly the possible existence of strains differing in pathogenicity. In a recent phylogenetic analysis, we characterized five coding genes from this rickettsial pathogen. Here, we analyze those genes and two additional intergenic non-coding regions following multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and multi-spacer typing (MST) approaches to assess the genetic variability of CXc and its relationship with blue, yellow and red (H. rufescens) abalone. Moreover, we used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing reads from gut microbiomes of blue and yellow abalone to complete the genetic characterization of this prokaryote. The presence of CXc was investigated in more than 150 abalone of the three species; furthermore, a total of 385 DNA sequences and 7117 16S rRNA reads from Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis were used to evaluate its population genetic structure. Our findings suggest the absence of polymorphism in the DNA sequences of analyzed loci and the presence of a single lineage of CXc infecting abalone from California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico). We posit that the absence of genetic variably in this marine rickettsia may be the result of evolutionary and ecological processes. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Such negative values are uncharacteristic of the site latitude near the sea level. Altitude effects do not explain the isotope data. Tropical depressions originating along the Pacific coast of North America yield rain with isotopic depletion; rain from these weather systems in southern Arizona commonly has Î´18O values<-10â° in comparison with amount-weighted mean summer and fall rain at -6â°. Isotope data indicate hurricane rain as the predominant source of recharge in southern Baja California, where named tropical depressions bring large rains (>50âmm) at least once every 2 to 3 years, and along the Pacific coast between Jalisco and Oaxaca.

The sites included hypersaline ecosystems, sea bottom, hydrothermal springs, and a shrimp farm. In this report we describe four new morphotypes, two are marine epilithic from Bahia Concepcion, Dermocarpa sp. and Hyella sp. The third, Geitlerinema sp., occurs in thermal springs and in shrimp ponds, and the fourth, Tychonema sp., is from a shrimp pond. The partial sequences of the 16S rRNA genes and the phylogenetic relationship of four cyanobacterial strains (Synechococcus cf. elongatus, Leptolyngbya cf. thermalis, Leptolyngbya sp., and Geitlerinema sp.) are also presented. Polyphasic studies that include the combination of light microscopy, cultures and the comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences provide the most powerful approach currently available to establish the diversity of these oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms in culture and in nature.\n\nUranium-series ages of marine terraces, La Paz Peninsula, Baja California Sur, Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSirkin, L.; Szabo, B. J.; Padilla, G.A.; Pedrin, S.A.; Diaz, E.R.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nUranium-series dating of coral samples from raised marine terrace deposits between 1.5 and 10 m above sea level in the La Paz Peninsula area, Baja California Sur, yielded ages between 123 ka and 138 ka that are in agreement with previously reported results. The stratigraphy and ages of marine units near the El Coyote Arroyo indicate the presence of two high stands of the sea during the last interglacial or oxygen isotope substage 5e at about 140 ka and 123 ka. Accepting 5 m for the sea level during the last interglacial transgression, we calculate average uplift rates for the marine terraces of about ???70 mm/ka and 40 mm/ka. These slow rates of uplift indicate a relative stability of the La Paz peninsula area for the past 140 000 years. In contrast, areas of Baja California affected by major faultf experienced higher rates of uplift. Rockwell et al. (1987) reported vertical uplift rates of 180 to 300 mm/ka at Punta Banda within the Aqua Blanea fault zone in northern Baja California. ?? 1990 Springer-Verlag.\n\nPlate tectonic constraints on the cessation of subduction beneath the Baja California peninsula, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStock, J. M.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nI review published models, existing global plate tectonic data and published marine geophysical observations west of Baja California to assess the timing and conditions under which subduction ceased along the W margin of Baja California. The relative motion of the Farallon microplate fragments can be reconstructed using Pacific- North America global plate motions (from the Pacific-Antarctica-Nubia-North America plate circuit) added to the local velocities of the microplates with respect to the Pacific plate. Because the Pacific plate was moving obliquely away from North America, the time at which subduction stopped has often been taken to be the time at which the microplates joined the Pacific plate (the ages of dead spreading centers preserved west of North America on the Pacific plate). The timing of cessation of subduction west of what is now northern Baja California is not recorded by a dead ridge offshore but is inferred to be coincident with extension and rotation in the continental borderland (early-middle Miocene). The Arguello microplate stopped spreading relative to the Pacific plate at about 13 Ma, providing a younger age limit on the cessation of subduction in the sector N of the Shirley transform fault. The time of cessation of spreading of the Magdalena-Pacific (M-P) ridge has been proposed by Michaud et al. (2006 Geology) to be as young as 8 Ma. However, the clockwise rotation of the M-P ridge before it ceased, and its inferred slow spreading rate away from the Pacific plate implies transcurrent motion with virtually no convergence between the Magdalena microplate and the North America plate during the last stages of activity of the M-P ridge. Subduction can occur by motion of forearc fragments without any convergence of the major bounding plates (e.g., the modern South Shetland Trench), but this may be ruled out for Baja California due to the small spatial scale of the microplates compared to the scale of the stable Baja California peninsula block\n\nPoor outcome is associated with delayed tuberculosis diagnosis in HIV-infected children in Baja California, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nViani, R M; Lopez, G; ChacÃ³n-Cruz, E; Hubbard, P; Spector, S A\n\n2008-04-01\n\nTo describe the morbidity and mortality associated with tuberculosis (TB) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected children in Baja California, Mexico. Retrospective review of the medical records of all children with perinatally acquired HIV infection evaluated at Tijuana General Hospital with a diagnosis of TB between 1998 and 2007. The Stegen-Toledo (ST) clinical criteria for the diagnosis of TB were used. A total of 73 HIV-infected children were followed during the study period. Thirteen (18%) children were diagnosed with TB; one was confirmed by culture to be positive. Among these children, the mean ages at HIV and TB diagnosis were respectively 3.6 and 5.3 years. The mean ST score was 8.1; 10/13 had a score of >or=7, or highly probable TB. There were a cumulative 29 hospital admissions prior to TB diagnosis; 24 of these were due to pneumonia. The mean duration of symptoms at TB diagnosis was 73 days. The most common symptoms were cough (92%) and anorexia (85%). Seven patients (54%) had disseminated TB and five (39%) died as a consequence of TB.

A population-based, cross-sectional study using a standardized questionnaire administered to a random sample of 2087 schoolchildren 6-7 years of age (1078 girls and 1009 boys) living in the city of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. The study analyzed associations between exposure variables and personal and family health history, and two dependent variables-nasal symptoms and nasal and ocular symptoms, in the absence of a cold or flu-using odd ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI). The study took place in February-July 2004 and followed the methodology of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The general prevalence of nasal symptoms and nasal and ocular symptoms was 25.0% and 10.5%, respectively. The boys and girls who had ever lived on a farm or in a rural area had a lower probability, adjusted for confounding variables, of presenting nasal symptoms (OR=0.43; 95%CI: 0.24-0.77), or nasal and ocular symptoms (OR=0.39; 95%CI: 0.16-0.93). In the study population, exposure to a rural environment in early childhood decreased the risk of developing allergic rhinitis, regardless of a family history of asthma.\n\nLate Pleistocene-Holocene alluvial stratigraphy of southern Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAntinao, JosÃ© Luis; McDonald, Eric; Rhodes, Edward J.; Brown, Nathan; Barrera, Wendy; Gosse, John C.; Zimmermann, Susan\n\n2016-08-01\n\nA late Pleistocene to Holocene alluvial stratigraphy has been established for the basins of La Paz and San JosÃ© del Cabo, in the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. Six discrete alluvial units (Qt1 through Qt6) were differentiated across the region using a combination of geomorphologic mapping, sedimentological analysis, and soil development. These criteria were supported using radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic depth-profile geochronology. Major aggradation started shortly after â¼70 ka (Qt2), and buildup of the main depositional units ended at â¼10 ka (Qt4). After deposition of Qt4, increasing regional incision of older units and the progressive development of a channelized alluvial landscape coincide with deposition of Qt5 and Qt6 units in a second, incisional phase. All units consist of multiple 1-3 m thick alluvial packages deposited as upper-flow stage beds that represent individual storms. Main aggradational units (Qt2-Qt4) occurred across broad (>2 km) channels in the form of sheetflood deposition while incisional stage deposits are confined to channels of â¼0.5-2 km width. Continuous deposition inside the thicker (>10 m) pre-Qt5 units is demonstrated by closely spaced dates in vertical profiles. In a few places, disconformities between these major units are nevertheless evident and indicated by partly eroded buried soils. The described units feature sedimentological traits similar to historical deposits formed by large tropical cyclone events, but also include characteristics of upper-regime flow sedimentation not shown by historical sediments, like long (>10 m) wavelength antidunes and transverse ribs. We interpret the whole sequence as indicating discrete periods during the late Pleistocene and Holocene when climatic conditions allowed larger and more frequent tropical cyclone events than those observed historically. These discrete periods are associated with times when insolation at the tropics was\n\nLecturas de Baja California (Readings from Baja California).\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMunoz, Gabriel Trujillo, Ed.\n\nThis anthology/textbook is part of a Mexican series of instructional materials designed for Spanish speaking adults who are in the process of becoming literate or have recently become literate in their native language.

The recent tectonic history of eastern Baja California has been dominated by oblique rifting that began at Ë12 Ma. Thus, extensional tectonics, bedrock lithology, long-term climatic changes, and evolving surface processes have controlled the tectono-geomorphological evolution of the eastern part of the peninsula since that time. In this study, digital elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) from Baja California were corrected and enhanced by replacing artifacts with real values that were derived using a series of geostatistical techniques. The next step was to generate accurate thematic geologic maps with high resolution (15-m) for the entire eastern coast of Baja California. The main approach that we used to clearly represent all the lithological units in the investigated area was objectoriented classification based on fuzzy logic theory. The area of study was divided into twenty-two blocks; each was classified independently on the basis of its own defined membership function. Overall accuracies were 89.6%, indicating that this approach was highly recommended over the most conventional classification techniques. The third step of this study was to assess the factors that affected the geomorphologic development along the eastern side of Baja California, where thirty-four drainage basins were extracted from a 15-m-resolution absolute digital elevation model (DEM). Thirty morphometric parameters were extracted; these parameters were then reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). Cluster analysis classification defined four major groups of basins. We extracted stream length-gradient indices, which highlight the differential rock uplift that has occurred along fault escarpments bounding the basins. Also, steepness and concavity indices were extracted for bedrock channels within the thirty-four drainage basins.

Historical records show that Baja has been damaged by intense summer storms. An arid to semiarid climate characterizes the study area, where precipitation mainly occurs during the summer and winter seasons. Natural and anthropogenic changes have impacted the landscape of southern Baja. The present research documents the effects of tropical storms over the southern region of Baja California for a period of approximately twenty-six years. The goal of the research is to demonstrate how remote sensing can be used to detect the important effects of tropical storms including: (a) evaluation of change detection algorithms, and (b) delineating changes to the landscape including coastal modification, fluvial erosion and deposition, vegetation change, river avulsion using change detection algorithms. Digital image processing methods with temporal Landsat satellite remotely sensed data from the North America Landscape Characterization archive (NALC), Thematic Mapper (TM), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) images were used to document the landscape change. Two image processing methods were tested including Image differencing (ID), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Landscape changes identified with the NALC archive and TM images showed that the major changes included a rapid change of land use in the towns of San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas between 1973 and 1986. The features detected using the algorithms included flood deposits within the channels of active streams, erosion banks, and new channels caused by channel avulsion. Despite the 19 year period covered by the NALC data and approximately 10 year intervals between acquisition dates, there were changed features that could be identified in the images. The TM images showed that flooding from Hurricane Isis (1998) produced new large deposits within the stream channels\n\nGeophysical characterization of subaerial hydrothermal manifestations in Punta Banda, Baja California, Mexico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFlores-Marquez, L.; Prol-Ledesma, R. M.; Arango, C.; Canet, C.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nImportant growth of population in Baja California Peninsula has triggered the need for energy and fresh water. The most sustainable possibility for increasing the availability of fresh water is the use of renewable energy sources in desalination plants. The abundance of geothermal manifestations in the peninsula provides a reliable energy source for desalination purposes. Geothermal development of the Baja California Peninsula dates from the 70's, when the Cerro Prieto geothermal field started producing electricity. Two important cities, Tijuana and Ensenada, are located in the north-western area of Baja California. The city of Ensenada has a desalination plant that is due to be replaced and the geothermal resources of the area could be an option for the new desalination plant. Punta Banda, a region near Ensenada, was specially investigated to determine its geothermal potential. Subaerial springs and the submarine vents were sampled and studied in this work, also geological and geochemical studies were performed, moreover geoelectrical surveys were accomplished to characterize the hydrothermal system at depth. Even though saline intrusion is a severe problem in Ensenada (TDS higher than 3000), thermal springs away from the coast and coastal springs have salinities lower than sea water. According to the geoelectrical models obtained from profiles, the inferred conductive features can be related to thermal anomalies. The existence of hot springs located along a trend suggests that the dynamic of the thermal fluid is restricted by secondary faults.\n\nAssociations between trace elements and clinical health parameters in the North Pacific loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) from Baja California Sur, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nLey-QuiÃ±Ã³nez, CÃ©sar PaÃºl; Rossi-Lafferriere, Natalia Alejandra; Espinoza-Carreon, Teresa Leticia; Hart, Catherine Edwina; Peckham, Sherwood Hoyt; Aguirre, Alfredo Alonso; Zavala-Norzagaray, Alan Alfredo\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis study investigated selected trace elements toxicity in sea turtles Caretta caretta population from Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico, by analyzing associations among Zn, Se, Cu, As, Cd, Ni, Mn, Pb, and Hg with various biochemical parameters (packed cell volume, leukocytes, and selected blood parameters), and whether their concentrations could have an impact on the health status of sea turtles. Blood samples from 22 loggerhead (C. caretta) sea turtles from BCS, Mexico, were collected for trace elements on biochemistry parameter analyses. Significant associations among trace element levels and the biochemistry parameters were found: Cd vs ALP (R 2 Â =Â 0.874, pÂ ËÂ 0.001), As vs ALP (R 2 Â =Â 0.656, pÂ ËÂ 0.001), Mn vs ALP (R 2 Â =Â 0.834, pÂ ËÂ 0.001), and Ni vs LDH (R 2 Â =Â 0.587, pÂ ËÂ 0.001). This study is the first report of the biochemical parameters of the North Pacific loggerhead sea turtle (C. caretta) from Baja California Sur, Mexico, and it is the first to observe several associations with toxic and essential trace elements. Our study reinforces the usefulness of blood for the monitoring of the levels of contaminating elements and the results suggest that, based on the associations with health clinical parameters, high levels of Cd and As could be representing a risk to the North Pacific loggerhead population health.\n\nPlacental biomarkers of PAH exposure and glutathione-S-transferase biotransformation enzymes in an obstetric population from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nDodd-Butera, Teresa; Quintana, Penelope J E; Ramirez-Zetina, Martha; Batista-Castro, Ana C; Sierra, Maria M; Shaputnic, Carolyn; Garcia-Castillo, Maura; Ingmanson, Sonja; Hull, Stacy\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEnvironmental exposures along the US-Mexico border have the potential to adversely affect the maternal-fetal environment. The purpose of this study was to assess placental biomarkers of environmental exposures in an obstetric population at the California-Baja California border in relation to detoxifying enzymes in the placenta and nutritional status. This study was conducted on consenting, full-term, obstetric patients (n=54), delivering in a hospital in Tijuana, Baja California (BC), Mexico. Placental polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts were measured in addition to placental glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and genotype, maternal serum folate, and maternal and umbilical cord blood lead and cadmium levels. A questionnaire was administered to the mothers to determine maternal occupation in a maquiladora, other exposures, and obstetric indicators. In univariate analysis, maternal serum folate levels were inversely correlated with total PAH-DNA adducts (rho=-0.375, p=0.007); adduct #1 (rho=-0.388, p=0.005); and adduct #3 (rho =-0.430, p=0.002). Maternal lead levels were significantly positively correlated with cord blood lead levels (rho=0.512, p<0.001). Cadmium levels were generally very low but significantly higher in mothers exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (either at work or at home, n=10). In multivariate analysis, only maternal serum folate levels remained as a significant negative predictor of total DNA-PAH adducts levels in placenta. These findings affirm that placental tissue is a valuable and readily available source of human tissue for biomonitoring; and indicate that further study of the role of nutrition in detoxification and mitigation of environmental exposures in pregnant women is warranted.

This work develops the slab-window concept and the tectonic and magmatic effects of the slab-free geometry on the Cordilleran system. Because no ridge-subduction was proposed to have occurred south of 30Â°N (Lonsdale, 1991), question arose as to whether a slab-free area also extended beneath southern Baja California. The Chile triple junction area (46Â°S) is a well-studied example of active ridge-subduction. This area exhibits the effects of slab-free development on the time distribution of magmatism and tectonism within the overriding continental block. Moreover, recent fieldwork conducted along the southern Baja California volcanic belt supports that slab melting under relatively shallow and warm conditions occurred during Upper Miocene time. When combined with the Miocene-Recent volcanic record of Baja California, a parallel drawn between the Chile and Mexico triple junction areas substantiates slab window development beneath southern Baja California peninsula during the past 12-10 m.y. The FAMEX cruise of the R/V Atalante (March-April 2002) was conducted to better constrain the ridge-subduction history in the area off southern Baja California. More than 5000 miles of swath bathymetry, magnetic, gravity record and 6 channels seismic reflection profiles were realized from 29Â°N to 22Â°30'N. Also, three magnetic deep-tow profiles were performed to provide a higher resolution of the magnetic signal and age of the corresponding oceanic crust. The study area displays two distinct morphological areas: (1) north of 27Â°30'N, the Guadalupe rift is a deep trough that trends roughly N-S. On either sides of the rift, the neighboring oceanic fabric trends parallel to it; (2) south of 27Â°N, the oceanic fabric is much more complicated and strongly contrasts with the regular fabric\n\nPlacental biomarkers of PAH exposure and glutathione-S-transferase biotransformation enzymes in an obstetric population from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDodd-Butera, Teresa, E-mail: tdbutera@csusb.edu\n\nEnvironmental exposures along the US-Mexico border have the potential to adversely affect the maternal-fetal environment.

These findings affirm that placental tissue is a valuable and readily available source of human tissue for biomonitoring; and indicate that further study of the role of nutrition in detoxification and mitigation of environmental exposures in pregnant women is warranted. - Highlights: â¢ Maternal-fetal environment susceptible to toxic exposures at US-Mexico border. â¢ Lower serum folate was correlated with higher PAH-DNA adduct levels at birth. â¢ Placental DNA adducts in GST mu (-) cord\n\nMolecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Baja California, Mexico: A result of human migration?\n\nPubMed\n\nFlores-LÃ³pez, Carlos A; Zenteno-Cuevas, Roberto; Laniado-LaborÃ­n, Rafael; Reynaud, Yann; GarcÃ­a-Ortiz, Rosa Alejandra; GonzÃ¡lez-Y-Merchand, Jorge A; Rivera, Sandra; VÃ¡zquez-ChacÃ³n, Carlos A; Vaughan, Gilberto; MartÃ­nez-Guarneros, JosÃ© Armando; Victoria-Cota, Nelva Lorena; Cruz-Rivera, Mayra; Rastogi, Nalin; MuÃ±iz-Salazar, Raquel\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe State of Baja California (BC) exhibits the highest incidence and prevalence rates of tuberculosis (TB), and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in Mexico. However information about the circulation of M. tuberculosis lineages in BC and Mexico as a whole is limited. Here, we describe the genetic relationship and genetic diversity among M. tuberculosis clinical isolates (n=140) collected in BC between October 2009 and April 2011 with other regions of Mexico, the United States, and Latin America. All specimens were genotyped based on 24 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU)-variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) loci. Population structure and minimum spanning tree (MST) analyses were used to assess the genetic diversity and distribution of BC isolates in comparison to USA and South America strains. Among the nine lineages observed, LAM, Haarlem and S were the most frequent identified in BC. Population structure analysis clustered most BC isolates (41%) into three distinctive groups that included strains from San Diego and South America, whereas other BC strains (22%) clustered with other Mexican strains. A subset of isolates (12%) seemed to be autochthonous of BC, while 25% were cosmopolitan and grouped into multiple clusters. It is highly likely that the TB genetic structure observed in BC is due to human migration. Additional studies are required to determine the mechanism involved in the phylogeographic distribution of M. tuberculosis in Mexico. Implementation of domestic molecular TB surveillance programs is required to better understand the molecular epidemiology of TB not only in the region but at the national level.

An application to the Guadalupe Valley, Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerrera-Oliva, C. S.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nIn this work we design and implement a method for the determination of precipitation forecast through the application of an elementary neuronal network (perceptron) to the statistical analysis of the precipitation reported in catalogues. The method is limited mainly by the catalogue length (and, in a smaller degree, by its accuracy). The method performance is measured using grading functions that evaluate a tradeoff between positive and negative aspects of performance. The method is applied to the Guadalupe Valley, Baja California, Mexico. Using consecutive intervals of dt=0.1 year, employing the data of several climatological stations situated in and surrounding this important wine industries zone. We evaluated the performance of different models of ANN, whose variables of entrance are the heights of precipitation. The results obtained were satisfactory, except for exceptional values of rain.

This study took place from 2005 to 2012 in a rural community in Baja California, Mexico. 1) Investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to lead and lead exposures from LGCs and two lead-based folk remedies ( azarcon and greta); and 2) evaluate a pilot intervention to provide alternative lead-safe cookware. A baseline household survey was conducted in 2005, followed by the pilot intervention in 2006, and follow-up surveys in 2007 and 2012. For the pilot intervention, families who reported using LGCs were given lead-safe alternative cookware to try and its acceptance was evaluated in the following year. The community was mostly of indigenous background from Oaxaca and a high proportion of households had young children. In 2006, all participants using traditional ceramic ware at the time ( n = 48) accepted lead-safe alternative cookware to try, and 97% reported that they were willing to exchange traditional ceramic ware for lead-safe alternatives. The use of ceramic cookware decreased from over 90% during respondents' childhood household use in Oaxaca to 47% in 2006 among households in Baja California, and further reduced to 16.8% in 2012. While empacho, a folk illness, was widely recognized as an intestinal disorder, there was almost universal unfamiliarity with the use and knowledge of azarcon and greta for its treatment. This pilot evaluation provides evidence 1) for an effective and innovative strategy to reduce lead exposure from LGCs and 2) of the feasibility of substituting lead-free alternative cookware for traditional ceramic ware in a rural indigenous community, when delivered in a culturally appropriate manner with health education. This strategy could complement other approaches to reduce exposure to lead from LGCs.\n\nMetal concentrations in demersal fish species from Santa Maria Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico (Pacific coast).\n\nPubMed\n\nJonathan, M P; Aurioles-Gamboa, David; Villegas, Lorena Elizabeth Campos; BohÃ³rquez-Herrera, Jimena; HernÃ¡ndez-Camacho, Claudia J; Sujitha, S B\n\n2015-10-15\n\nConcentrations of 11 trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Co, Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Hg) in 40 fish species from Santa Maria Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico, the strategically important area for marine mammals and organisms were analyzed. Based on their concentrations the ranking of metals Fe>Zn>Ni>Cr>Mn>Pb>Cu>Co>As>Cd>Hg suggests that organism size, metabolism and feeding habits are correlated with metal concentrations. Local geological formations affect the concentrations of different metals in the aquatic environment and are subsequently transferred to fishes. The correlation analysis suggests that metabolism and nurturing habits impact the concentration of metals. Concentrations of Fe and Mn appear to be influenced by scavenging and absorption processes, which vary by species. The considerable variability in the metal concentrations obtained in different species underscores the importance of regular monitoring. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Baja California and Gulf of California population\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHenny, C.J.; Anderson, D.W.\n\n1979-01-01\n\n-An estimated 810 ? 55 pairs (minimum estimate) of ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) were nesting in the study area during our survey (24 March-l April 1977). Approximately 174 pairs nested along the Pacific side of Baja California, 255 pairs along the gulf side, 187 pairs on the Midriff Islands, and 194 pairs in coastal Sonora and Sinaloa. Most nested on cliffs adjacent to the sea (59%); some nested on cactus in flat terrain (26%). Seven per cent nested on the ground, three percent nested in mangroves and other trees in the southern portion of the study area,.and four percent nested on man-made structures. The extreme northwestern Baja California population that was extirpated early in this century has not recovered. However, several populations immediately to the south along the Pacific Coast now appear stationary. Pesticide residues in osprey eggs from Mexico were among the lowest reported for the species in North America.\n\nNew geologic slip rates for the Agua Blanca Fault, northern Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGold, P. O.; Behr, W. M.; Fletcher, J. M.; Hinojosa-Corona, A.; Rockwell, T. K.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWithin the southern San Andreas transform plate boundary system, relatively little is known regarding active faulting in northern Baja California, Mexico, or offshore along the Inner Continental Borderland. The inner offshore system appears to be fed from the south by the Agua Blanca Fault (ABF), which strikes northwest across the Peninsular Ranges of northern Baja California. Therefore, the geologic slip rate for the ABF also provides a minimum slip rate estimate for the offshore system, which is connected to the north to faults in the Los Angeles region. Previous studies along the ABF determined slip rates of ~4-6 mm/yr (~10% of relative plate motion). However, these rates relied on imprecise age estimates and offset geomorphic features of a type that require these rates to be interpreted as minima, allowing for the possibility that the slip rate for the ABF may be greater. Although seismically quiescent, the surface trace of the ABF clearly reflects Holocene activity, and given its connectivity with the offshore fault system, more quantitative slip rates for the ABF are needed to better understand earthquake hazard for both US and Mexican coastal populations. Using newly acquired airborne LiDAR, we have mapped primary and secondary fault strands along the segmented western 70 km of the ABF. Minimal development has left the geomorphic record of surface slip remarkably well preserved, and we have identified abundant evidence meter to km scale right-lateral displacement, including new Late Quaternary slip rate sites. We verified potential reconstructions at each site during summer 2015 fieldwork, and selected an initial group of three high potential slip rate sites for detailed mapping and geochronologic analyses. Offset landforms, including fluvial terrace risers, alluvial fans, and incised channel fill deposits, record displacements of ~5-80 m, and based on minimal soil development, none appear older than early Holocene. To quantitatively constrain landform ages\n\nGeochemical characteristics of the San Miguel aquifer, Baja California, Mexico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTostado-Plascencia, Miriam; Rosas-Elguera, Jose; Kretzschmar, Thomas\n\n2010-05-01\n\nThe valley of San Miguel, located in the state of Baja California, Mexico, is an important region because of the wine industry. It is therefore important to know groundwater characteristics. Two aquifers can be recognized in the San Miguel basin, first one is in fractured granitic rocks (in the upper part of the basin, called UB) and other is free-type in detritc sediments (in the lower part of the basin, close to the sea, called LB). The water temperature ranges between 25Â°C y 11Â°C without significant variations along the year. The conductivity increases with the water temperature and decreases in February when the temperature is lower. The pH of the waters in UB is between 8.5 and 6.5 but in the LB is in the range of 6.8 to 7.3. Our data show that Na, Mg, and HCO3- concentrations decrease during the rainy season due to ion exchange. According to the Stiff diagrams the waters of the LB are classified as sodium chloride. In the UB the water classification includes calcium and magnesium bicarbonate, magnesium chloride, and few calcium chloride and sodium chloride. The saturation indexes of the waters suggest that the mineral phases which can be present are: K-feldspar, gibbsite, albite, quartz, calcite, aragonite, gypsum, and magnesite. Because of SI>0 then the first four phases can precipitate but the SI of magnesite and gypsum is negative thus the can be dissolved. Finally, calcite and aragonite are in equilibrium due to they are close to zero. Our results suggest that the aquifers of the San Miguel basin do not show evidence of saline intrusion.\n\nPrevalence of Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome in a Migrant Mixtec Population, Baja California, Mexico\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGoodman, David; Fraga, Miguel A.; Brodine, Stephanie; Ibarra, Maria-de-la-Luz; Garfein, Richard S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study was conducted to determine the prevalence and correlates of metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes among a migrant Mixtec population residing in San Quintin, Baja California, Mexico. A cross-sectional study utilizing data collected during a 2-day clinic in 2008 in a rural farming community with a high prevalence of Mixtec Indians. Interviews and clinical examinations were performed to assess sociodemographic data, medical history and anthropometric measures. Blood samples were obtained to measure glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL. Of the 107 patients surveyed, 56 % were female and mean age was 38.5 (range: 18â74, SD = 12.6) years. Overall, 41.1 % had MS and 26.2 % had diabetes. Drinking alcohol more than once a week [adjusted OR (AOR) = 16.0, p = 0.008] and being literate (AOR = 0.38, p = 0.035) were independently associated with MS. Only female gender was significantly associated with diabetes (OR = 3.95, p = 0.005). The high prevalence of MS, diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities among migrant farm workers in San Quintin suggest the need for interventions to reduce the risk for these conditions.

To address this issue, we analyzed a suite of granulite and lherzolite xenoliths from the upper Pleistocene-Holocene San QuintÃ­n volcanic field of northern Baja California, Mexico. The San QuintÃ­n volcanic field is located 20 km east of the Baja California shear zone, which accommodates the relative movement between the Pacific plate and Baja California microplate. The development of a strong foliation in both the mafic granulites and lherzolites, suggests that a lithospheric-scale shear zone exists beneath the San QuintÃ­n volcanic field. Combining microstructural observations, geothermometry, and phase equilibria modeling, we estimated that crystal-plastic deformation took place at temperatures of 750-890 Â°C and pressures of 400-560 MPa, corresponding to 15-22 km depth. A hot crustal geotherm of 40 Â° C km-1 is required to explain the estimated deformation conditions. Infrared spectroscopy shows that plagioclase in the mafic granulites is relatively dry. Microstructures are interpreted to show that deformation in both the uppermost lower crust and upper mantle was accommodated by a combination of dislocation creep and grain-size-sensitive creep. Recrystallized grain size paleopiezometry yields low differential stresses of 12-33 and 17 MPa for plagioclase and olivine, respectively. The lower range of stresses (12-17 MPa) in the mafic granulite and lherzolite xenoliths is interpreted to be associated with transient deformation under decreasing stress conditions, following an event of stress increase. Using flow laws for dry plagioclase, we estimated a low viscosity of 1.1-1.3Ã1020 Pa á¹¡ s for the high temperature conditions (890 Â°C) in the lower crust. Significantly lower viscosities in the range of 1016-1019 Pa á¹¡ s, were estimated using flow laws for wet plagioclase. The shallow upper mantle has a low viscosity of 5.7Ã1019 Pa á¹¡ s\n\nPlio-pleistocene volcano-tectonic evolution of la Reforma Caldera, Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDemant, Alain; Ortlieb, Luc\n\n1981-01-01\n\nLa Reforma volcanic complex, in east-central Baja California, shows a characteristic caldera structure, 10 km in diameter. The first eruptive stage, during the Pliocene, was manifested by ash and pumice falls and by subaqueous pumitic flows. In a second stage basic flows were deposited in a near-shore environment (subaerial and pillow lavas). During the early Pleistocene a large ignimbritic eruption, producing mainly pantelleritic tuffs, immediately predated the formation of the caldera itself. Afterwards, along marginal fractures of the caldera, some rhyolitic domes and flows partially covered the thick ignimbritic sheet. A block of Miocene substratum, in the center of the caldera, has been uplifted, nearly 1 km, by \"resurgent doming\". Small outcrops of diorite might constitute the top of coarse-grained crystallized magmatic bodies, and thus support the \"resurgent doming\" interpretation. A few basaltic cones were finally built on the flanks of the caldera complex; the latter are not related to the caldera history but to the extension tectonics of the Gulf of California which are also responsible for the Tortuga Island and the Holocene Tres Virgenes tholeiitic cones. South of la Reforma are found the highest (+300 m) Pleistocene marine deposits of the Gulf coast of Baja California. The uplift of this area is due in part to the positive epeirogenic movements of the whole peninsular crustal block, and also to the late doming of the caldera. On the coastal (eastern) flank of La Reforma complex up to seven stepped wave-cut terraces have been preserved, the highest reaching more than +150 m and the lowest ones +25 m. Lateral correlations of the marine terraces along the whole Gulf of California suggest that this volcano-tectonic uplift, that is still active, is of the order of 240 mm/10 3 y. The set of terraces is interpreted to be Middle (700-125 Ã 10 3y) to Upper (125-80 Ã 10 3y) Pleistocene, and is tentatively correlated with the paleoclimatic chronology of deep\n\nThe stratified microbial community at Laguna Figueroa, Baja California, Mexico: A possible model for prephanerozoic laminated microbial communities preserved in cherts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStolz, John F.; Margulis, Lynn\n\n1984-12-01\n\nThe microbial mat community of the evaporite flat at North Pond, Laguna Figueroa (Baja California, Mexico) was actively involved in the production of laminated sediments prior to 1978. Heavy rains in 1979 and 1980 flooded the mat with 1 and 3 meters of meteoric water respectively. The flooding deposited up to 10 cm of silicoclastic sediment over theMicrocoleus-dominated mat and resulted in the cessation of laminated sediment deposition. In 1982, the surface had been recolonized by species of cyanobacteria (Spirulina, Oscillatoria) and purple photosynthetic bacteria (Chromatium, Thiocapsa). The silicoclastic sediments and residual evaporites, which overlaid the laminated sediment, had been reworked into an anaerobic, sulfide-rich mud and contained well preserved sheaths of filamentous and coccoid bacteria.\n\nPATHOGENIC LEPTOSPIRA SEROVARS IN FREE-LIVING SEA LIONS IN THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA AND ALONG THE BAJA CALIFORNIA COAST OF MEXICO.\n\nPubMed\n\nAvalos-TÃ©llez, RosalÃ­a; Carrillo-Casas, Erika M; Atilano-LÃ³pez, Daniel; GodÃ­nez-Reyes, Carlos R; DÃ­az-Aparicio, EfrÃ©n; RamÃ­rez-Delgado, David; RamÃ­rez-Echenique, MarÃ­a F; Leyva-Leyva, Margarita; SuzÃ¡n, Gerardo; SuÃ¡rez-GÃ¼emes, Francisco\n\n2016-04-28\n\nThe California sea lion ( Zalophus californianus ), a permanent inhabitant of the Gulf of California in Mexico, is susceptible to pathogenic Leptospira spp. infection, which can result in hepatic and renal damage and may lead to renal failure and death. During summer 2013, we used the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) to investigate the prevalence of anti-Leptospira antibodies in blood of clinically healthy sea lion pups from seven rookery islands on the Pacific Coast of Baja California (Pacific Ocean) and in the Gulf of California. We also used PCR to examine blood for Leptospira DNA. Isolation of Leptospira in liquid media was unsuccessful. We found higher antibody prevalence in sea lions from the rookery islands in the gulf than in those from the Pacific Coast. Antibodies against 11 serovars were identified in the Gulf of California population; the most frequent reactions were against serovars Bataviae (90%), Pyrogenes (86%), Wolffi (86%), Celledoni (71%), and Pomona (65%). In the Pacific Ocean population, MAT was positive against eight serovars, where Wolffi (88%), Pomona (75%), and Bataviae (70%) were the most frequent. Serum samples agglutinated with more than one Leptospira serovar. The maximum titer was 3,200. Each island had a different serology profile, and islands combined showed a distinct profile for each region. We detected pathogenic Leptospira DNA in 63% of blood samples, but we found no saprophytic Leptospira. Positive PCR results were obtained in blood samples with high and low MAT titers. Together, these two methods enhance the diagnosis and interpretation of sea lion leptospirosis. Our results may be related to human activities or the presence of other reservoirs with which sea lions interact, and they may also be related to sea lion stranding.\n\nBald eagles nesting in Baja California\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHenny, Charles J.; Anderson, Daniel W.; Knoder, C.E.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nPublished records of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nesting in Baja California during the last 50 years are nonexistent to our knowledge, and few records exist prior to that time. Friedmann et al. (1950:61, Pac.

T.; Cal-Mex Science Team\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe composition of the atmosphere over the US-Mexico border region is affected by cross-border transport of emissions in both directions. Air quality issues in the California-Mexico (Cal-Mex) border are associated with air masses originating in the portion of the border region adjacent to California, which includes two of the sister city pairs (Tijuana-San Diego and Mexicali-Calexico) that have the most severe air pollution problems, posing a serious health threat to their inhabitants as well as affecting ecosystem viability and regional climate for large downwind distances. During May-June 2010, an intensive field study was undertaken by US-Mexico collaborative teams to characterize the major sources of primary and secondary particulate matter and precursor gases in the California-Mexico (Cal-Mex) border region, their transport and transformation, and the impact of these emissions on regional air quality and climate. The ground-based measurements included a central fixed site located in Tijuana that housed state-of-the-science instruments to measure gases, aerosols, radiation and meteorological parameters; a mobile eddy covariance laboratory that measured surface-atmosphere exchange fluxes of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particle number; several mobile units for criteria pollutants and meteorological parameters; and measurements of fine particles and trace gases at the border crossing areas. Preliminary results from the field study will be presented.

There are five lagoons of5 Ha each and 17 ha of terrains constantly flooded that serve as feeding areas for cattle and birds. One hundred twenty three species were observed, 75 of which were aquatic birds. A total of 46 041 observations were made (average 1 918 birds/census). Richness and abundance of aquatic birds were influenced mainly by migration of anatids and sandpipers. The first group had the greatest abundance due to its affinity towards fresh water bodies. The terrains were the favorite sites of dabbling ducks (Anas) and sandpipers. In contrast, two of the most abundant species (Oxyura jamaicensis, 12.5% of all species, and Fulica americana, 8.8 %) restricted their presence to the oxidation lagoons. LO presented a bird structure of its own and atypical, according to the dryness of the region.\n\nStatus of the peregrine falcon in the Rocky Mountains and the southwestern United States, Baja California, and Mexico (south of Texas)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPorter, Ron; Craig, G.R.; Ellis, D.H.; Enderson, J.H.; Hunt, W.G.; Schaeffer, Philip P.; Ehlers, Sharyn M.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nAbout 31 pairs of peregrines still nest north of Mexico, from Idaho and Montana south through West Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. At least thirty-six additional pairs nest in Mexico. Although the nesting sites are occupied, the tissues of the peregrine?s prey species still contain high concentrations of pesticides. The eggs in some Rocky Mountain eyries have shells which are precariously thin and have high residue levels of DDE in their contents. Increasing economic development is encroaching on the peregrine habitat throughout its range in western North America. In Baja California. and Mexico south of Texas this involves increased agricultural activity including use of organochlorine pesticides, increased tourism and increased use of the Gulf of California both for commercial and sport fishing, with their potential disturbance of eyrie sites and reduction of the peregrine?s aquatic feeding prey base. As the fish in the Gulf decrease in number, some of the avian species on which peregrines prey will likewise decrease. This ultimately may effect the peregrine. These factors may have been involved in the demise of the peregrine on Baja California?s Pacific coast. Furthermore, throughout its range, residential, industrial, mining, geothermal, recreational and other types of development and land use practices sometimes destroy habitat essential to the survival of the peregrine. A recent request for the protection of an historical site in California as Critical Habitat under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act was rejected because peregrines, although observed there, were not known to have produced eggs or young at the site for several decades. With inadequate protection of abandoned, but still suitable, historical eyrie sites, the peregrine may have an insufficient number of eyries to reoccupy in recovery attempts. The lack of present occupancy of a site, without biological evidence that the site is no longer suitable for reoccupancy, is insufficient cause to give\n\nKey species and impact of fishery through food web analysis: A case study from Baja California Sur, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRocchi, Marta; Scotti, Marco; Micheli, Fiorenza; Bodini, Antonio\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEcosystem-Based Management (EBM) aims to support the protection of natural ecosystems and to improve economic activities. It requires considering all of the actors interacting in social-ecological systems (e.g., fish and fishers) in the understanding that their interplay determines the dynamic behavior of the single actors as well as that of the system as a whole. Connections are thus central to EBM. Within the ecological dimension of socio-ecological systems, interactions between species define such connections. Understanding how connections affect ecosystem and species dynamics is often impaired by a lack of data. We propose food web network analysis as a tool to help bridge the gap between EBM theory and practice in data-poor contexts, and illustrate this approach through its application to a coastal marine ecosystem in Baja California Sur, Mexico. First, we calculated centrality indices to identify which key (i.e., most central) species must be considered when designing strategies for sustainable resource management. Second, we analyzed the resilience of the system by measuring changes in food web structure due to the local extinction of vulnerable species (i.e., by mimicking the possible effect of excessive fishing pressure). The consequences of species removals were quantified in terms of impacts on global structural indices and species' centrality indices. Overall, we found that this coastal ecosystem shows high resilience to species loss. We identified species (e.g., Octopus sp. and the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus) whose protection could further decrease the risk of potential negative impacts of fishing activities on the Baja California Sur food web. This work introduces an approach that can be applied to other ecosystems to aid the implementation of EBM in data-poor contexts.\n\nElectrical conductivity of the crust in central Baja California, MÃ©xico, based on magnetotelluric observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRomo, J. M.; GÃ³mez-TreviÃ±o, E.; Flores-Luna, C.; GarcÃ­a-Abdeslem, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCrustal and sub-crustal structure of northwestern Mexico (peninsular California) resulted from major accretion episodes occurred during the long-lived subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the North American plate, since late Jurassic time. A magnetotelluric profile across central Baja California reveals several electrical conductivity anomalies probably associated to the crustal boundaries of distinct Mezosoic terranes juxtaposed in the current peninsular crust. It is known that electrical conductivity is significantly increased by the pervasive presence of conductive minerals generated during metamorphic processes in highly sheared zones. We interpret a striking sub-horizontal conductivity anomaly reveled in the model as explained by the presence of high-salinity fluids released after dehydration of the subducted Magdalena microplate (Farallon plate?). The presence of fluids at the base of the peninsular crust may produce a zone of weakness, which supports the idea that Baja California lithosphere has not been entirely coupled to the Pacific plate. In addition, crustal thickness is estimated in our model in about 35 km beneath the western Peninsular Ranges batholith (PRB) and 20 km beneath the eastern PRB. This crustal thickness is in good agreement with independent estimations of a thinner crust in the Gulf of California margin and a thicker crust along the axial PRB.\n\nHistological Alterations in Pacific Oysters Crassostrea gigas that Survived a Summer Mortality Event in Baja California, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nCÃ¡ceres-MartÃ­nez, Jorge; VÃ¡squez-Yeomans, Rebeca; Danigo, Philippe; Reyes-Roel, Carlos\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA mortality episode (>90%) of triploid and diploid Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas cultured in Baja California Sur occurred during summer 2012, coinciding with a thermal anomaly, an algal bloom, and low oxygen values. To help explain the cause of the mortalities, histological analyses and molecular tests for specific pathogens (ostreid herpesvirus 1 [OsHV-1] and Perkinsus marinus) were performed on oysters surviving at the end of the episode. Triploid oysters showed a high percentage of males (43%) and hermaphrodites (30%); 93% of these oysters were in the gonadic reabsorption stage, and in some cases, hemocytes completely filled the lumen of the gonadic follicles. Oysters presented large areas with severe hemocyte infiltration that extended toward the digestive gland. Diploid oysters showed similar gonad alterations.
