        "text": "It is accepted that the first true coins (metallic disks of a certain fineness and weight with indicators of source) were issued around 650BC. The earliest coins usually had a rather primitive animal or human figure on the obverse with a punch (geometric or otherwise) on the reverse. They were originally struck in electrum, a natural alloy of silver and gold. When the ancients developed the technology to isolate the metals, they struck coins in gold and silver, as well as bronze. As time progressed, imagery was placed on both sides of the coin.\n\nBy the next century the coinage really blossomed, in quality as well as number of varieties. Over 1,000 individual Greek city-states issued coinage during ancient times. After the defeat by Rome, many of these cities still minted coins but with Roman emperors on them.\n\nRoman coinage started in the Republic and ran until the capital was moved from Rome to Constanopolis. After Caesar, every emperor issued coins depicting themselves, their wives, their childran, and their parents. The reverses usually pictured one of their gods or goddesses. They issued many commemorative reverses to celebrate victories as well as other important events. Many of these depict structures that still exist today. Roman coins were minted in all areas that they occupied and were mint marked by standard annotations so you know where the coin was actually minted. .\n\nCoins were hand struck in those days, leading to off center strikes and rotated reverses on some. The dies were hand cut by artisans known as celators who engraved the coin designs into bronze dies.. They created two dies, the anvil die (usually the obverse) and the hammer die (usually the reverse die). The coin planchets were usually heated to soften them before they were struck. The hammer die was struck by a mallet handled by a strong man.\n\nThis is a grouping of ancient coins to acquaint you with this often forgotten part of human history. I will start with the oldest progressing through to the newest. The \"newest\" is still mighty old!\n\nThanks to Wikipedia for much of the historical background information.\n\nThis page is divided into three major sections:\n\nGREEK Click Here\n\nROMAN Click Here\n\nROMAN-GREEK PROVINCIAL Click Here\n\nGreek\n\nThe Greeks were true artisans and some of their coins are unparalled even today in the artistic design and engraving of coinage. Most of the Greek issues included reference to the issuing authority, the magistrate responsible, and, in some cases, even the name of the artisan that designed the coin.\n\nGreek silver coinage were minted in several denominations: dekadrachm (10 drachmas), tetradrachm (4 drachmas), didrachm (2 drachmas), drachm, tetrobol (4 obols), hemidrachm (half drachma - 3 obols), diobol (2 obols), obol, and even smaller fractional denominations. Ther dekadrachm pieces are exceptionally rare and expensive. The tetradrachms and drachmas are the most common.\n\nThe standard silver coinage was the drachma (about the size of a U.S. dime) which was 4.3 grams of silver and the tetradrachm (four drachmas about the size of a U.S.. half dollar) which was 17.2 grams of silver. Both of these are relatively commonly found today. Most of the Greek coins were of the Attic Standard.\n\nGreece per se did not exist in those days. What we today call Greece was then over 2,000 individual independent or semi-independent city-states, at least half of which issued their own coinage. Most of these city-states were constantly at war either with each other or with foreign invaders such as the Persians. Alexander the Great of Macedonia forcibly united the Greeks and launched an empire that ultimately reached as far as Egypt in the south and India in the east. He established mints in all these territories that struck his coinage. His coinage has a plethora of mintmarks and, in some cases, symbols for magistrates responsible for the coinage. These mintmarks can be images of animals, ships, decorations and monograms of various letters. Most of these have been attributed by hoards found in areas of his former occupation.\n\nMany of the cities issued coins that bore the image of their patron god or goddess or a legendary hero (such as Hercules) on the obverse and a symbol of the city on the reverse. An example is Rhodes that used a rose as the Greek word for rose is ρόδον. Gradually, some of the cities started using their name or abbreviations of same on the reverse side.\n\nGreek cities of Sicily designed and minted some of the most beautiful coins ever seen including today. The large silver dekadrachm coin from Syracuse is an example. The obverse features the goddess Arethusa and the the reverse has a charioteer driving a quadriga with Nike flying overhead with a victory wreath. This image was also used on the tetradrachm, a single example of which is shown from my collection. Some of these coins have the name of the artist that designed the coins.\n\nAs the Greek epoch faded, the Romans took over. The quality of the coinage, artistic as well as, ultimately, the purity of the metal, deteriorated. In the time of the Roman Republic through about 300 AD, the coins are still pleasing. After the fall of Greece, many formerly Grecian territories and cities continued issuing coins under the Roans. These coins are commonly referred to as Roman Provincial or Greek Imperial coinage and these issues are included in the third section. Later into the Byzantine epoch the designs' quality deteriorated and became primitive again.\n\nThe common reference series on these coins:\n\nGREEK COINS AND THEIR VALUES by David L.

Its ruins are located near the modern town of Balat in Aydin Province, Turkey. Before the Persian invasion in the middle of the 6th century BC, Miletus was considered the greatest and wealthiest of Greek cities. Evidence of first settlement at the site has been made inaccessible by the rise of sea level and deposition of sediments from the Meander. The first available evidence is of the Neolithic Age. In the early and middle Bronze Age the settlement came under Minoan influence. Legend has it that an influx of Cretans occurred displacing the indigenous Leleges. The site was renamed Miletus after a place in Crete.\n\nThis tiny silver coin is a hemiobol (1/12 drachm) isued in Miletos around 525BC.

The etiological myth explaining how Athens acquired this name is the legendary contest between Poseidon and Athena which was described by ancient Greek scholars. Both Athena and Poseidon wanted to be patrons of the city and to give their name to it, so they competed with each other for the honor, offering the city one gift each.

According to the legend Phalanthus, the Parthenian leader, went to Delphi to consult the oracle and received the puzzling answer that he should found a city where rain fell from a clear sky. After all attempts to capture a suitable place to found a colony failed, he became despondent, convinced that the oracle had told him something that was impossible, and was consoled by his wife. She laid his head in her lap and herself became disconsolate. When Phalanthus felt her tears splash onto his forehead he at last grasped the meaning of the oracle, for his wife's name meant clear sky. The harbour of Taranto in Apulia was nearby and he decided this must be the new home for the exiles. The Partheniae arrived and founded the city, naming it Taras after the son of the Greek sea god, Poseidon, and the local nymph Satyrion.

The city has existed for nearly 3,000 years, developing from a Phoenician colony of the 1st millennium BC into the capital of an ancient empire. According to Greek historians, Carthage was founded by Canaanite-speaking Phoenician colonists from Tyre (in modern Lebanon). It became a large and rich city and thus a major power in the Mediterranean. The resulting rivalry with Syracuse, Numidia, and Rome was accompanied by several wars with respective invasions of each other's homeland. Hannibal's invasion of Italy in the Second Punic War culminated in the Carthaginian victory at Cannae and led to a serious threat to the continuation of Roman rule over Italy. Carthage emerged from the conflict weaker after Hannibal's defeat at the Battle of Zama in 202BC. Following the Third Punic War, the city was destroyed by the Romans in 146BC. However, the Romans refounded Carthage, which became the empire's fourth most important city and the second most important city in the Latin West.

It was inhabited by the Greek tribes of the Chaonians, Molossians, and Thesprotians, and home to the sanctuary of Dodona, the oldest ancient Greek oracle, and the most prestigious one after Delphi. Unified into a single state in 370BC by the Aeacidae dynasty, Epirus achieved fame during the reign of Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose campaigns against Rome are the origin of the term \"Pyrrhic victory\". The Aeacid dynasty ended in 232BC, but Epirus remained a substantial power, unified under the auspices of the Epirote League as a federal state with its own parliament. Epirus subsequently became part of the Roman Empire along with the rest of Greece in 146BC.\n\nThis is a silver drachm issued by the Epirote Republic from 238-168BC, The obverse has the head of Zeus Dodonaios with an EK monogram beneath the bust The reverse has an eagle standing facing right on a thuderbolt within an oak wreath with APEI-RWTWN.

Aristotle's Politics several times draws for examples on the internal government of Epidamnos, which was run as a tight oligarchy that appointed a ruling magistrate. Tradesmen and craftsmen were excluded from power until internal strife produced a more democratic government. The exiled oligarchs appealed to Corcyra while the democrats enlisted the help of Corinth, initiating a struggle between the two mother cities described by Thucydides as a cause of the Peloponnesian War. Individual trading with the local Illyrians was forbidden at Epidamnos, all business was through the authorized city agent or poletes. In the fourth century BC the city-state was part of the kingdoms of Cassander and Pyrrhus.\n\nThis is a silver drachm.

The Bruttii retained their independence until 280BC, when they helped the Greek king Pyrrhus of Epirus in his war against the Romans. After defeating Pyrrhus, the Romans invaded Bruttium and occupied most of the country. The Bruttii aided the Carthaginian general Hannibal during the Second Punic War (218-201BC), resulting in their final crushing as an separate entity.\n\nThis small bronze coin was issued in Bruttium around 215-205BC.

Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Persia's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (171138BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now southeastern Turkey, to eastern Persia. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. The Parthians largely adopted the art, architecture, religious beliefs, and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire, which encompassed Persian, Hellenistic, and regional cultures. For about the first half of its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture, though it eventually saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions.\n\nThis is a silver drachma minted by Sinatruces at Ecbatana in 77-70BC.

It was the capital of the Ilergetes, in the north of Hispania Tarraconensis, on the road from Tarraco (modern Tarragona) and Ilerda (modern Lleida) to Caesaraugusta (modern Zaragoza) and fell under Caesaraugusta's jurisdiction. Pliny alone places the Oscenses in Vescitania, a district mentioned nowhere else. The city's name was rendered as Osca, and was a Roman colony. Phoenician and Greek contact with Spain stretched back to the Seventh Century BC at least; possibly several centuries earlier in the case of the Phoenicians. A lively trade was carried on with the rich mining culture based on the city of Tartessos, but about 500BC the Carthaginians destroyed Tartessos having already taken control of the Phoenician settlements in Spain. Carthaginian pre-eminence in southern and eastern Spain lasted until the time of the Punic Wars between Carthage and Rome. It was from Spain that Hannibal launched his famous invasion of Italy which came so close to destroying the Roman Republic in the infancy of its power. But Hannibal was defeated and Spain became a Roman province (206BC). During the Second Century BC, Rome gradually extended her influence into the interior of the country and permitted the Iberian tribes to issue a native currency bearing Iberian legends. This coinage ceased with the provincial reforms carried out in 133BC. The various civil wars in Spain in the First Century BC saw the temporary revival of bronze issues from certain mints. It was not until 19BC, in the reign of Augustus, that the whole of the peninsula came under Roman control with the conquest of northwestern Spain.\n\nThis is a silver drachm minted by the Osca tribes in 204-154BC on the Iberian Peninsula. The obverse has a male head right with short beard, a legend resembling '*Y' behind. The reverse has a horseman galloping right with spear with an Iberian legend resembling '*PMAN' = BOLSCAN below. The coin measures 20mm and weighs about 4 grams.\n\nAbbaitis, PHRYGIA ca 200BC\n\nIn antiquity, Phrygia was a kingdom in the west central part of Anatolia, in what is now Turkey, centered around the Sakarya River. The Phrygians are most famous for their legendary kings of the heroic age of Greek mythology: Gordias whose Gordian Knot would later be untied by Alexander the Great; Midas who turned whatever he touched to gold; and Mygdon who warred with the Amazons. According to Homer's Iliad, the Phrygians were close allies of the Trojans and participants in the Trojan War against the Achaeans. Phrygian power reached its peak in the late 8th century BC under another, historical king Midas, who dominated most of western and central Anatolia and rivaled Assyria and Urartu for power in eastern Anatolia. This later Midas was, however, also the last independent king of Phrygia before its capital Gordium was sacked by Cimmerians around 695BC. Phrygia then became subject to Lydia, and then successively to Persia, Alexander and his Hellenistic successors, Pergamon, Rome and Byzantium. Phrygians were gradually assimilated into other cultures by the early medieval era.\n\nThis small bronze coin was minted about 200-100BC in Abbaitis. The obverse has the laureate head of Zeus facing right The reverse has MUSWN ABBAITWN above and below winged thunderbolt, all within an oak wreath. The coin measures 20mm.\n\nEPHESUS, IONIA ca 200BC\n\nEphesus was an ancient Greek city on the coast of Ionia, three kilometers southwest of present-day Selçuk in Izmir Province, Turkey. It was built in the 10th century BC on the site of the former Arzawan capital by Attic and Ionian Greek colonists. During the Classical Greek era it was one of the twelve cities of the Ionian League. The city flourished after it came under the control of the Roman Republic in 129 BC. According to estimates Ephesus had a population of 33,600 to 56,000 people in the Roman period, making it the third largest city of Roman Asia Minor. Ephesus can be visited today and a small percentage of the ancient city has been excavated to reveal the splendour of this ancient site.\n\nThe small 18mm bronze coin has a honeybee (symbol of Ephesus) in a wreath with the Greek letters Ε and Φ on the obverse and a standing stag with a palm tree in the background on the reverse. This coin was minted from 202-133BC.\n\nMASSILIA, GAUL: - ca 200BC\n\nThe first permanent Greek settlement in France, and the oldest city, was called Massalia, established at modern-day Marseille about 600BC by colonists coming from Phocaea on the Aegean coast of Asia Minor. A second wave of colonists arrived in about 540, when Phocaea was destroyed by the Persians. The city became one of the major trading ports of the ancient world. At its height, in the 4th century BC, it had a population of about 6,000 inhabitants, on about 0.2 square miles surrounded by a wall. It was governed as an artistocratic republic, by an assembly of the 600 wealthiest citizens. It had a large temple of the cult of Apollo of Delphi on a hilltop overlooking the port, and a temple of the cult of Artemis of Ephesus at the other end of the city. The drachma coins minted in Massalia were found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Massalia allied itself with the expanding Roman Republic for protection. Under this arrangement the city maintained its independence until the rise of Julius Caesar, when it joined the losing side (Pompey and the optimates) in civil war, and lost its independence in 49 BC.\n\nThis is a silver drachm issued around 200 BC. It measures 17mm and weighs about 2.5 grams. The obverse features a diademed and draped bust of Artemis facing right with a bow and quiver at the shoulder. The reverse has a lion standing facing left, ΜΑΣΣΑ above, Λ between legs, AΞ in exergue.\n\nMYRINA, AEOLIS ca 200BC\n\nMyrina was one of the Aeolian cities on the western coast of Mysia. It is said to have been founded by one Myrinus before the other Aeolian cities, or by the Amazon Myrina. Artaxerxes gave Gryneium and Myrina to Gongylus, an Eretrian, who had been banished from his native city for favoring the interests of Persia. Myrina was a very strong place, though not very large, and had a good harbor. Pliny mentions that it bore the surname of Sebastopolis; while, according to Syncellus, it was also called Smyrna. An ancient inscription tells us that Myrina formed part of the Kingdom of Pergamon in the 3rd century BC. For some time Myrina was occupied by Philip V of Macedon; but the Romans compelled him to evacuate it, and declared the place free.\n\nThis small bronze coin was minted in Myrina around 200-100BC, The obverse has the head. of Athena facing right in a crested helmet ornamented with a griffin. The reverse has an amphora and a lyre to the right with the Greek legend ΜΥΡΙ. The coin measures 16mm and has an attractive green patina.\n\nPERGE, PAMPHYLIA ca 200BC\n\nPerge was an ancient Greek city in Anatolia, once the capital of Pamphylia Secunda, in today's Antalya province on the southwestern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The region of Pamphylia first enters history in Hittite documents. In a treaty between the Hittite Great King Tudhaliya IV and his vassal, the king of Tarhuntassa, we read of the city \"Parha\" (Perge). The first historical mention of \"Pamphylians\" is among the group of nations subdued by the Mermnad kings of Lydia; they afterwards passed in succession under the dominion of the Persian and Hellenistic monarchs. After the defeat of Antiochus III in 190BC, they were included among the provinces annexed by the Romans to the dominions of Eumenes of Pergamum. Somewhat later they joined with the Pisidians and Cilicians in piratical ravages. Pamphylia was for a short time included in the dominions of Amyntas, king of Galatia, but after his death lapsed into a district of a Roman province\n\nThis small bronze coin was minted about 200-100BC. The obverse has a laureated head of Artemis facing right with a quiver behind the neck neck. The reverse has Artemis standing holding a wreath and scepter with a stag at her feet. The legends ARTEMIDOS and PERGAIAS respecively to the right and the left. The coin measures 17mm.\n\nCilicia, Seleukeia ca 200 BC\n\nSeleucia ad Calycadnum or Seleukeia is on the Kalykadno River, near the Mediterranean coast in Cilicia; modern Silifke, Turkey. It was founded by of Seleukos I sometime after 295BC, when the king conquered Cilicia on his way to Macedonia.\n\nThis bronxe coin was minted from 200-100BC. The obverse has the helmeted head of Athena in a crested Corinthian helmet with ΑΓΩ on the left. The reverse has Nike advancing left, holding a wreath encircled by the Greek legend SELEUKEWN TWN PROS TWI KALUKADNWI. The coin measures 23mm.\n\nSIDE, PAMPHYLIA ca 200BC\n\nSide was founded by Greek settlers from Cyme in Aeolis, a region of western Anatolia. This most likely occurred in the 7th century BC. Its tutelary deity was Athena, whose head adorned its coinage. Alexander the Great occupied Side without a struggle in 333 BC. Alexander left only a single garrison behind to occupy the city. This occupation, in turn, introduced the people of Side to Hellenistic culture, which flourished from the 4th to the 1st century BC. After Alexander's death, Side fell under the control of one of Alexander's generals, Ptolemy I Soter, who declared himself king of Egypt in 305 BC. Pamphylia was the region in the south of Asia Minor, between Lycia and Cilicia, extending from the Mediterranean to Mount Taurus.\n\nThis is a silver tetradrachm minted in Side around 200BC. The obverse has the head of Athena in a crested Corinthian helmet facing right . The reverse has Nike advancing in field to the left. There is a counterstamp of an upside down anchor in an incuse square to the right and a pomegranate to left with a monogram identifier for the magistrate of the Greek letters ΣΤ below. The coin measures 16mm.\n\nODESSOS, THRACE - ca 200BC\n\nThe region of ancient Thrace was populated by Thracians by 1000BC. Miletian Greeks founded the apoikia (trading post) of Odessòs towards the end of the 7th century BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600575BC) within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos was pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. A member of the Pontic Pentapolis, Odessos was a mixed communitycontact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been applied to inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BCE; the city worshipped a Thracian great god whose cult survived well into the Roman period. It is located at current day Varna, in Bulgaria.\n\nThis bronze coin was minted about 200BC. The obverse features the right-facing laureate head of Apollo. The reverse has the great ood reclining left with the legend ODHSITWN below. The coin measures 15mm.\n\nThessalian LEAGUE ca 194BC\n\nThe Thessalian League was a loose confederacy of feudal-like city-states and tribes in the Thessalian valley in Northern Greece and was run by a few aristocratic Thessalian families\n\nThis bronze coin was issued around 194-146BC. The obverse has a laureate head of Apollo facing right. The reverse has Athena Itonia standing facing right with shield, about to hurl a spear. The Greek legend ΘΕΣΣΑ-ΛΩΝ is on the lower sides of the coin. The magistrate's name is above. The coin measures 20mm.\n\nBACTRIA ca 171BC\n\nBactria is the ancient name of a historical region located south of the Amu Darya and west of Gandhara. Ancient Bactria was in present-day northern Afghanistan, between the Hindu Kush mountain range and the Amu Darya. It is suggested by E. Herzfeld that, prior to its annexation to the Persian Empire by Cyrus the Great in 6th century BC, Bactria belonged to the Median empire and together with Margiana formed the twelfth satrapy of Persia. After Darius III had been defeated by Alexander the Great, the satrap of Bactria, Bessus, attempted to organize a national resistance but was captured by other warlords and delivered to Alexander. He was then tortured and killed. Alexander conquered Sogdiana and Iran. However, in the south, beyond the Oxus, he met strong resistance. After two years of war and a strong insurgency campaign, Alexander managed to establish little control over Bactria. After Alexander's death, the Macedonian empire was eventually divided up between generals in Alexander's army. Bactria became a part of the Seleucid Empire, named after its founder, Seleucus I. The Greek language became dominant for some time there. The paradox that Greek presence was more prominent in Bactria than in areas far closer to Greece can possibly be explained by past deportations of Greeks to Bactria. For instance, during the reign of Darius I, the inhabitants of the Greek city of Barca, in Cyrenaica, were deported to Bactria for refusing to surrender assassins. In addition, Xerxes also settled the \"Branchidae\" in Bactria; they were the descendants of Greek priests who had once lived near Didyma (western Asia Minor) and betrayed the temple to him. Herodotus also records a Persian commander threatening to enslave daughters of the revolting Ionians and send them to Bactria..\n\nThis is a silver drachm minted in 171-160BC for Antimachos. The obverse has the armed horseman king surrounded by a Karoshi legend. The reverse has Nike standing with the Greek legend BASILEWS NIKHFOROU ANTIMACOU. There is a monogram to the lower left of Nike. The coin measures 16mm.\n\nThis silver drachma was minted for Menander around 160-145 BC. The obverse features a diademed and draped bust facing right with the Greek legend BASILEWS SWTHEROS MENANDPOU. The reverse has Athena advancing left, bearing shield and thunderbolt with Karosthi legend. There is a monogram in the lower right field. The coin measures 21 mm.\n\nRHODES ca 160BC\n\nRhodes was founded in 408BC and is an island just off the coast of western Turkey. The Colossus of Rhodes, one of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was built by the Lindian sculptor Chares between 304 and 293BC. It took 12 years and was completed in 282BC. The statue represented their sun god Helios, which stood at the harbour entrance. A strong earthquake hit Rhodes about 226BC, badly damaging the city and toppling the Colossus. For the next eight centuries it lay in ruins until it was sold to a Jewish merchant, reputed to require 900 camels to haul it away. In 164BC, Rhodes came under Roman control. During WWII, it was occupied by Italy and after the war, reverted to Greece.\n\nThis small silver coin is a drachma. The obverse has a radiate head of Helios facing right. The reverse has the rose symbol of Rhodes, magistrate's symbol, ΦΙΛΩΝ (magistrate's name) in small letters above, Greek letters P and O at sides, all inside an incuse square. It was minted in 166-88 BC The coin measures 16mm and weighs about 3 grams.\n\nTHASOS ca 148\n\nThasos is a Greek island in the northern Aegean Sea, close to the coast of Thrace and the plain of the river Nestos but geographically part of Macedonia. It is the northernmost Greek island, and 12th largest by area. The island was colonized at an early date by Phoenicians, attracted probably by its gold mines. They founded a temple to the god Melqart, whom the Greeks identified as \"Tyrian Heracles\", and whose cult was merged with Heracles in the course of the island's Hellenization. Around 650BC, or a little earlier, Greeks from Paros founded a colony on Thasos. Thasian coins had the head of the wine god Dionysos on one side and bunches of grapes on the other. Thasos was important during the Ionian Revolt against Persia. After the capture of Miletus (494BC) Histiaeus, the Ionian leader, laid siege. The attack failed but, warned by the danger, the Thasians employed their revenues to build war ships and strengthen their fortifications. This excited the suspicions of the Persians, and Darius compelled them to surrender their ships and pull down their walls. After the defeat of Xerxes the Thasians joined the Delian confederacy; but afterwards, on account of a difference about the mines and marts on the mainland, they revolted. The Athenians defeated them by sea, and, after a siege that lasted more than two years, took the capital, Thasos, probably in 463BC, and compelled the Thasians to destroy their walls, surrender their ships, pay an indemnity and an annual contribution (in 449BC this was 21 talents (a Greek talent weighed 26 kilograms (57 lb) of silver), from 445BC about 30 talents), and give ip their possessions on the mainland. In 411BC, at the time of the oligarchical revolution at Athens, Thasos again revolted from Athens and received a Lacedaemonian governor. In 407BC the partisans of Lacedaemon were expelled and the Athenians, under Thrasybulus, were admitted. After the Battle of Aegospotami (405BC), Thasos again fell into the hands of the Lacedaemonians under Lysander who formed a decarchy (ten men oligarchy) there. Later the Athenians must have recovered it, for it formed one of the subjects of dispute between them and Philip II of Macedonia. In the embroilment between Philip V of Macedonia and the Romans, Thasos submitted to Philip, but received its freedom at the hands of the Romans after the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197BC), and it was still a \"free\" state in the time of Pliny.\n\nThis is a silver tetradrachm minted in Thasos around 148BC. The obverse portrait is of a young Dionysus crowned with vines facing right. The reverse is of Heracles standing naked, head left, holding a club and lion skin.. The legends, HRAKLEOUS is to the right, SWTEROS is to the left, and QASIWN is below Hercules. The coin measures 33mm and weighs 17 grams.\n\nEUMENEIA ca 133BC\n\nEumeneia, a town of Phrygia, is situated on the river Glaucus, on the road from Dorylaeum to Apameia. It is said to have received its name from Attalus II., who named the town after his brother and predecessor, Eumenes II.\n\nThis bronze coin was minted around 133BC. The obverse has a helmeted head of Athena facing right. The reverse has Nike advancing left, holding wreath and palm with the legends ΕΥΜΕ to the right and ΠΔΙΟΦ (magistrate) to the left. The coin measures 19mm.\n\nLaodikeia Paphlagonia ca 133BC\n\nThis settlement was founded as a city in the Hellenistic Period. The Hellenistic city was founded by the commander Seleucus Antiochus II after the name of his wife Laodike around the middle of the third century BC. The region later became part of the Roman Republic (after Empire) in 130-129BC. Paphlagonia was a rugged mountainous area on the Black Sea coast of north central Anatolia, between Bithynia to the west and Pontus to the east. Herodotus names the Paphlagonians among the peoples conquered by Croesus, and they sent an important contingent to the army of Xerxes in 480BC After the death of Alexander the Great, it was assigned, together with Cappadocia and Mysia, to Eumenes. However, it continued to be governed by native princes until it was absorbed by Pontus. It was not until 183BC that Pharnaces took Sinope under their control. From that time, the whole province was incorporated into the kingdom of Pontus until the fall of Mithridates to Rome in 65BC.\n\nThis bronze coin was minted around 133BC. The obverse has a female head facing right, The reverse has a decorated cornucopia with the Greek legend ΛAODI-KEON. The coin measures 20mm.\n\nARADOS,PHOENICIA - ca 130BC\n\nThe island was settled in the early 2nd millennium BC by the Phoenicians. Under Phoenician control, it became an independent kingdom called Arvad or Jazirat (the latter term meaning \"island\"). The Phoenician name for the city was probably Aynook. In Greek it was known as Arados. It is located off the coast of today's Syria.\n\nThis bronze coin was minted around 130BC. The obverse has a turreted bust of Tyche right facing right, The reverse has Poseidon on prow of ship sailing left, holding wreath and trident with phoenician letters above andphoenician numerals beneath. The coin measures 21mm.\n\nBelikiom, CITERIOR IBERIA - 120BC\n\nBelikiom was the old name of Piquete de la Atalaya de Azuara, an area near present day Zaragosa, Spain.\n\nThis bronze coin was minted around 120BC. The obverse has a male head facing right with a Celtiberian letter behind. The reverse has a horseman facing right carrying lance with the city's name below in Celtiberian script BELIKIOM. The coin measures 24mm.\n\nCASTULO, IBERIA - ca 120BC\n\nCastulo was located in the Andalusian province of Jaén, in south-central Spain. Oretans was the name of the Iberian tribe which settled in the vicinity in the north of the Guadalquivir River beginning in the 6th century BC. Of tradition, a local princess named Himilce married Hannibal and gained the alliliance of the city with the Carthaginian Empire. In 213BC, Castulo was the site of Hasdrubal Barca's crushing victory over the Roman army with a force of roughly 40,000 Carthaginian troops plus local Iberian mercenaries. Thereafter the Romans made a pact with the residents of city  who then betrayed the Carthaginians  and the city became an foederati (ally) of Rome\n\nThis bronze coin was minted around 120BC. The obverse has a diademed male head facing right. The reberse has a helmeted sphinx walking right with the Celtiberian 'KASTILO' below. The coin measures 29mm.\n\nEGYPT ca 117BC\n\nPtolemy IX Soter II was king of Egypt three times, from 116BC to 110BC, 109BC to 107BC and 88BC to 81BC, with intervening periods ruled by his brother, Ptolemy X Alexander. At first he was chosen by his mother Cleopatra III to be her co-regent (his father Ptolemy VIII wished that she would rule with one of her sons), though she was more forced to choose him by the Alexandrians. He married his sister Cleopatra IV, but his mother pushed her out and replaced her with his younger sister Cleopatra Selene. Later, she claimed that he tried to kill her, and successfully deposed him, putting her favorite son Alexander on the throne as co-regent with her. However, she later grew tired of the now Ptolemy X and deposed him, putting Ptolemy IX back on the throne. She was soon murdered by Ptolemy X, who took the throne again. He was then killed in battle, and Ptolemy IX reigned until his own death. In Alexandria, Ptolemy IX replaced the gold sarcophagus of Alexander the Great with a crystal or glass one, and melted the original down in order to strike emergency gold issues of his coinage. The citizens of Alexandria were outraged at this and soon after, Ptolemy IX was killed.\n\nThis large bronze coin was minted under Ptolemy IX from 117-81BC. The obverse has a diademed head of Zeus Ammon facing right. The reverse has two eagles standing on thunderbolt. There is a winged thunderbolt on the left field. All encircled by the Greek legend PTOLEMAIOU BASILEWS. The coin measures 29mm. Most of these coins have the circular indentation on the center of both sides. Speculation is that they were created during the preparation of the flan for striking. Likely a tool was used to hold the flan in place as it was rotated in a circular motion to make it easier to shave the edges of the planchet to the right dimensions.\n\nThis is a tetradrachm issued by Ptolemy XII in 62/1BC (Regnal Year 20). The obverse has a diademed head of Ptolemy XII facing right with an aegis at neck. The reverse has a standing eagle on a thunderbolt with the Greek legend PTOLEMAIOU BASILEWS, with IK (date) before, PA (Paphos Cyprus mint) behind.\n\nMESEMBRIA, PONTUS - ca 110BC\n\nMesembria was a colony of Pontus at this time located on the western coast of the Black Sea in today's Bulgaria. It was an ancient Greek settlement that was taken by Mithradates VI, king of Pontus.\n\nThis silver tetradrachm has a head of Apollo (some believe with the face of Alexander the Great). The reverse has a seated Zeus with a bird on his right arm. The legs are crossed with indicates it is a posthumous issue). The legend to the right is ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ and to the left ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ.

The coin was issued under Mithradates VI (ca. 120-63BC) and struck around 110-90BC. This coin is in exceptional condition.\n\nMYNDOS ca 100BC\n\nMyndos was an ancient Dorian colony of Troezen, on the coast of Caria in Asia Minor sited on the Bodrum Peninsula, a few miles northwest of Halicarnassus. The site is now occupied by the modern village of Gümüslük, Turkey.\n\n.\n\nThis is silver hemidrachma (half drachm) issued in Mynos around 100BC.

After bringing the Persian Empire to an end, Alexander the Great tried to rule the area through one of his military commanders. But Ariarathes, a Persian aristocrat, somehow became king of the Cappadocians. Ariarathes I (332322BC) was a successful ruler, and he extended the borders of the Cappadocian Kingdom as far as to the Black Sea. After the death of Alexander the previous empire was then divided into many parts, and Cappadocia fell to Eumenes. His claims were made good in 322BC by the regent Perdiccas, who crucified Ariarathes, In the dissensions which brought about Eumenes's death, the son of Ariarathes recovered his inheritance and left it to a line of successors, who mostly bore the name of the founder of the dynasty. Cappadocia entered into an alliance with Rome, first as a foe espousing the cause of Antiochus the Great, then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon. The kings henceforward threw in their lot with the Republic as against the Seleucids, to whom they had been from time to time tributary. The Cappadocians, supported by Rome against Mithridates VI of Pontus, elected a native lord, Ariobarzanes, to succeed (93BC); but in the same year Armenian troops under Tigranes the Great entered Cappadocia, dethroned king Ariobarzanes and crowned Gordios as the new client-king of Cappadocia, thus creating a buffer zone against the encroaching Romans. It was not until Rome had deposed the Pontic and Armenian kings that the rule of Ariobarzanes was reestablished (63BC).\n\nThis is a silver drachm of Ariarathes VII Philometor of 96/95BC, The obverse has a young head of the king facing right. The reverse has Athena standing left holding Victory, a spear and a shield. The Greek legend is BASILEWS ARIARAQOU FILOMETOS . The regal year K is at the bottom. The coin measures 17mm.\n\nSeleukid KINGDOM - 93BC\n\nThe Seleucid Empire was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the empire created by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Kuwait, Persia, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and northwest parts of India. Much of the eastern part of the empire was conquered by the Parthians under Mithridates I of Parthia in the mid-2nd century BC, yet the Seleucid kings continued to rule a rump state from Syria until the invasion by Armenian king Tigranes the Great and their ultimate overthrow by the Roman general Pompey. By 100BC, the once formidable Seleucid Empire encompassed little more than Antioch and some Syrian cities. In the wars in Anatolia between Mithridates VI of Pontus and Sulla of Rome, the Seleucids were largely left alone by both major combatants. Mithridates' ambitious son-in-law, Tigranes the Great, king of Armenia, however, saw opportunity for expansion in the constant civil strife to the south. In 83BC, at the invitation of one of the factions in the interminable civil wars, he invaded Syria, and soon established himself as ruler of Syria, bringing the Seleucid Empire virtually at an end. Following the Roman general Lucullus' defeat of both Mithridates and Tigranes in 69BC, a rump Seleucid kingdom was restored under Antiochus XIII. Even so, civil wars could not be prevented, as another Seleucid, Philip II, contested rule with Antiochus. After the Roman conquest of Pontus, the Romans became increasingly alarmed at the constant source of instability in Syria under the Seleucids. Once Mithridates was defeated by Pompey in 63BC, Pompey set about the task of remaking the Hellenistic East by creating new client kingdoms and establishing provinces. While client nations like Armenia and Judea were allowed to continue with some degree of autonomy under local kings, Pompey saw the Seleucids as too troublesome to continue. He then did away with both rival Seleucid princes, and made Syria into a Roman province.\n\nThis silver tetradrachm of Philip II was minted from 93-83BC. The obverse has a diademed bust facing right with a filleted border. The reverse has the Greek legend BASILEWS FILIPPOU EPIFANOUS FILADELFOU lettered in dots with Zeus seated facing left, holding Nike. The coin measures 27mm.\n\nAMISOS ca 86BC\n\nAmisos is located on the northeastern Black Sea coast of Turkey. The early Greek historian Hecataeus wrote that Amisos was formerly called Enete, the place mentioned in Homer's Iliad. It has also been known as Peiraieos by Athenian settlers and even briefly as Pompeiopolis by a Roman Emperor who wanted it named after him. Amisos was settled between the years of 760-750BC by people from Miletos, who established a flourishing trade relationship with the ancient peoples of Anatolia. The city's ideal combination of fertile ground and shallow waters attracted numerous traders. The city was captured by the Persians in 550BC and became part of Cappadocia (satrapy). In the 4th century BC the city came under the expanded rule of the Kingdom of Pontus. The Romans took over in 71BC and Amisos became part of Bithynia et Pontus province (and later Dioecesis Pontica) of the eastern Roman Empire.\n\nThis brass coin was minted in 85-65BC. The obverse has a figue of Aegis (a protective ornament used on armor) with Gorgon's head (a dreadful looking female creature) in the center. The reverse has Nike advancing right carrying a palm branch with monograms left and right. AMI-SOU brackets Nike. The coin measures 21mm.\n\nTermessos Major, Pisidia ca 71BC\n\nTermessos was a Pisidian city built at an altitude of about 4,000 feet at the south-west side of the mountain Solymos in the Taurus Mountains. The ancient city was founded by the Solims who lived in the Psidia Region. Although there are no facts available about Termessos and Solims, they are referenced by Homer in the Iliad in connection with the legend of Belleropho. Pisidia was an inland region of ancient Asia Minor, located north of Lykia, and bordering Karia, Lydia, Phrygia and Pamphylia. Pisidia was a wild, mountainous region, and one of the most difficult for outside powers to control. It was largely independent from both the Lydians and the Persians. Alexander the Great had somewhat better luck, although the city of Termessos defied him, but the Hellenistic kings were never in full control. Cities in the region was among the last in western Anatolia to Hellenize and to coin their own money.\n\nThis bronze coin was minted in 71-36BC. The obverse features a bust of Zeus facing right. The reverse has a horse with rider galloping right. There is a Greek legend ΤΕΡ above. The coin measures 20mm.\n\nTYRE, PHOENICIA ca 55BC\n\nTyre, Phoenicia was founded around 2750 BC according to Herodotus and was originally built as a walled city upon the mainland. Its name appears on monuments as early as 1300 BC. Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to sail the Mediterranean. They founded colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the Aegean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa at Carthage and many other places such as Sicily, Corsica, and Spain. In 332BC Alexander the Great laid siege to the city, conquered and razed it. It became a Roman province in 64BC.\n\nThis is a silver shekel minted in Tyre in 55BC. The obverse has the laurate head of the god Melqarth. The reverse has a standing eagle facing left with the legend ΤΥΡΟΥ ΙΕΡΑΣ ΚΑΙΑΣΙΛΟΥ(Of Tyre Sacred and Inviolate). The left field has the date OB (regnal year 52) and a club. The right field has a monogram. These shekels of Tyre were used by the Jews to pay their temple tax which was a half shekel per person annually. This coin measures 28mm.\n\nROMAN\n\nThe history of Rome spans 2,800 years of the existence of a city that grew from a small Latin village in the 9th century BC into the centre of a vast civilisation that dominated the Mediterranean region for centuries. The population of the city fell drastically in the Late Empire after Rome ceased to be the capital of the Empire.\n\nAccording to the founding myth of Rome, the city was founded on 21 April 753BC by twin brothers Romulus and Remus, who were descended from the Trojan prince Aeneas and who were grandsons of the Latin King Numitor of Alba Longa. King Numitor was deposed from his throne by his brother, Amulius, while Numitor's daughter, Rhea Silvia, gave birth to the twins. Because Rhea Silvia was raped and impregnated by Mars, the Roman god of war, the twins were considered half-divine. The new king feared Romulus and Remus would take back the throne, so he ordered them to be drowned. A she-wolf saved and raised them, and when they were old enough, they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor.\n\nThe twins then founded their own city, but Romulus killed Remus in a quarrel over the location of the Roman Kingdom, though some sources state the quarrel was about who was going to rule or give his name to the city. Romulus became the source of the city's name. In order to attract people to the city, Rome became a sanctuary for the indigent, exiled, and unwanted. This caused a problem for Rome, which had a large workforce but was bereft of women. Romulus traveled to the neighboring towns and tribes and attempted to secure marriage rights but as Rome was so full of undesirables they all refused. Legend says that the Latins invited the Sabines to a festival and stole their unmarried maidens, leading to the integration of the Latins and the Sabines.\n\nAccording to tradition and later writers such as Livy, the Roman Republic was established around 509BC, when the last of the seven kings of Rome, Tarquin the Proud, was deposed by Lucius Junius Brutus, and a system based on annually elected magistrates and various representative assemblies was established. A constitution set a series of checks and balances and a separation of powers. The most important magistrates were the two consuls, who together exercised executive authority as imperium, or military command. The consuls had to work with the senate, which was initially an advisory council of the ranking nobility, or patricians, but grew in size and power.\n\nIn the mid-1st century BC, Roman politics were restless. Political divisions in Rome became identified with two groupings, populares (who hoped for the support of the people) and optimates (the \"best\", who wanted to maintain exclusive aristocratic control. Sulla overthrew all populist leaders and his constitutional reforms removed powers (such as those of the tribune of the plebs) that had supported populist approaches. Meanwhile social and economic stresses continued to build. Rome had become a metropolis with a super-rich aristocracy, debt-ridden aspirants, and a large proletariat often of impoverished farmers. The latter groups supported the Catilinarian conspiracy  a resounding failure, since the consul Marcus Tullius Cicero quickly arrested and executed the main leaders of the conspiracy.\n\nOnto this turbulent scene emerged Gaius Julius Caesar, from a very aristocratic family of limited wealth. To achieve power, Caesar reconciled the two most powerful men in Rome, Marcus Licinius Crassus, who had financed much of his earlier career, and Crassus' rival, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (anglicized as Pompey), to whom he married his daughter. He formed them into a new informal alliance including himself, the First Triumvirate (\"three men\"). In 53BC, Crassus invaded Parthia and was killed in the Battle of Carrhae. The Triumvirate disintegrated at Crassus' death. Crassus had acted as mediator between Caesar and Pompey, and, without him, the two generals manoeuvred against each other for power. Caesar conquered Gaul, obtaining immense wealth, respect in Rome and the loyalty of battle-hardened legions. He also became a clear menace to Pompey and was loathed by many optimates. Confident that Caesar could be stopped by legal means, Pompey's party tried to strip Caesar of his legions, a prelude to Caesar's trial, impoverishment, and exile.\n\nTo avoid this fate, Caesar crossed the Rubicon River and invaded Rome in 49BC. Pompey and his party fled from Italy, pursued by Caesar. The Battle of Pharsalus was a brilliant victory for Caesar and in this and other campaigns he destroyed all of the optimates' leaders, Metellus Scipio, Cato the Younger, and Pompey's son, Gnaeus Pompeius. Pompey was murdered in Egypt in 48BC. Caesar was now pre-eminent over Rome, attracting the bitter enmity of many aristocrats. He was assassinated in 44BC, on the Ides of March by the Liberatores.\n\nCaesar's assassination caused political and social turmoil in Rome. Without the dictator's leadership, the city was ruled by his friend and colleague, Mark Antony. Soon afterward, Octavius, whom Caesar adopted through his will, arrived in Rome. Octavian tried to align himself with the Caesarian faction. In 43BC, along with Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Caesar's best friend, he legally established the Second Triumvirate. This alliance would last for five years.\n\nIn 27BC, Octavian was the sole Roman leader. His leadership brought the zenith of the Roman civilization, that lasted for two centuries. In that year, he took the name Augustus. That event is usually taken by historians as the beginning of Roman Empire  although Rome was an \"imperial\" state since 146BC, when Carthage was razed by Scipio Aemilianus and Greece was conquered by Lucius Mummius. Officially, the government was republican, but Augustus assumed absolute powers.\n\nOctavian was followed by a number of emperors who ruled over the empire. There were many murders done by those competing for the office of emperor. There were pretender emperors usually in the field who claimed the title emperor.\n\nThe Roman monetray system was based upon the silver denarius.\n\nDuring the Republic, the denarius was equal to 4 of the copper sestertius; 5 of the copper dupondius;10 of the copper as; 20 of the copper semis; 24 of the copper quincunx; 30 of the copper triens; 40 of the copper quadrans; or 120 of the copper uncia. Note: some of the copper coins were also minted in brass. These were the coins used in Rome at first, then at other mints in Italy. After they occupied former Greek and other cities, different denominations were used to fit the local customs.\n\nAugustus added two gold denomnations, the aureus and the quinarius aureus as well as a silver quinarius argenteus (half denarius).\n\nLater the gold coin became the solidus.\n\nIn the mid-200s, the denarius was dropped and replaced by the antoninianus originally as a silver coin representing two denarii but containing the silver of one and a half denarii. It quickly morphed into a billon coin usually washed with silver. Later the follis was issued which is a fairly large and heavy bronze coin. Even later smaller bronze coins were issued and their names are unknown so they are simply called AE4, AE3, etc. The number denotes the size range: AE2, which is 21-25mm, AE3, which is 17-21mm, and AE4, which is smaller than 17mm.\n\nCommon reference books on these series are:\n\nROMAN COINS AND THEIR VALUES by David R.

In the 1st century BC (and perhaps earlier), a board of junior magistrates (moneyers) are known to have been responsible for the minting of coinage. This consisted of three men, the triumviri auro argento aere flando feriundo (meaning three men responsible for casting and striking gold, silver and bronze), referred to on coins with the abbreviation IIIVIR. A. A. A. F. F., or more usually just IIIVIR for triumvir. Their number was increased to four under Caesar. Other magistrates, such as quaestors and curule aediles, are also known to have issued coins.\n\nThis silver victoriatus was issued by an anonymous moneyer in 209BC.
