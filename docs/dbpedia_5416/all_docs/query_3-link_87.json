        "text": "Azuara is a municipality in the province of Zaragoza the Aragon Autonomous Region in northeastern Spain. The place belongs to the comarca of Campo de Belchite and lies at 603 m above sea level at the river CÃ¡maras. The nearest large towns are Belchite (16 km) and Fuendetodos ( 13 km). The provincial capital, Zaragoza is located 60 km north of Azuara.\n\nThe place is dominated by agriculture, but 80% of its agricultural land unwatered and therefore only for the classical dry cultures of the Mediterranean basin ( such as olives and wine ) can be used. The population Azuaras declined since 1991 from 830 to 643 (as of 1 January 2013).\n\nAzuara crater\n\nAzuara wins among geologists and meteorite researchers increasingly to prominence as were found there in the surrounding structures of a meteor impact. The impact is said to have taken place in the Middle Tertiary simultaneously with two other meteorite impacts. The \" Azuara crater \" has a diameter of 30 to 40 km."
