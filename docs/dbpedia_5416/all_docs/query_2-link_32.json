        "text": "Although Sanger sequencing has been considered the gold standard in clinical genetic testing, no clearly standardized procedures for RAS mutational testing have been established. An increasing number of hotspots targeted qualitative techniques have been developed with different levels of sensitivity and specificity (10–12), although only some of them are commercially available (13). Digital PCR is a highly sensitive and quantitative method that has been recently applied with the purpose of analyzing the role of minor mutated KRAS/NRAS subclones in patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR drugs (14, 15), suggesting that a threshold of 1% of mutated subclones is the optimal cutoff to distinguish patients more likely to benefit from cetuximab or panitumumab. However, data reported on RAS mutations analyzed by BEAMing in the KRAS exon 2 wild-type cohort of patients enrolled in the CRYSTAL trial suggested that mCRC patients with tumors bearing mutations between 0.1% and <5% benefited from the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI in the first-line setting (1). There is therefore a need for identifying a mutation detection threshold that is clinically relevant to select patients for anti-EGFR therapy.\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumors obtained from surgical resections (partial or complete colectomy) or diagnostic biopsies from 583 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR (n = 255) or bevacizumab (n = 328) regimens from retrospective series and several clinical trials from the TTD/RTICC Spanish network (clinical trial identifiers: NCT01071655, NCT00958386, NCT00885885, NCT01126112, and NCT01704703). Patients received treatment between February 2003 and September 2014. Main clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients are described in Table 1. Three patients were excluded because of invalid results in the mutational analyses. Data on KRAS exon 2 mutational status were available before biological treatment in 135 patients. The therascreen KRAS PCR Kit (Qiagen), cobas KRAS Mutation Test kit, and digital PCR (in two cases included in the clinical trial NCT01704703) were used for the analysis. Pathological diagnosis was verified on the basis of H&E-stained sections, and carcinomas were classified according to UICC TNM classification system. Before DNA extraction, stained slides were reviewed by a pathologist to estimate overall neoplastic cell content and a minimum 15% of tumor cell content was considered to be a valid sample for analysis. Tumor response was extracted from medical records evaluated by attending physician, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Patients with stable disease (SD) or disease progression (PD) were defined as nonresponders. Independent ethics committees at each participating center reviewed and approved the protocol and the study was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Committees allowed a waiver in individual patient consent for retrospective biomedical research studies which included the permission to use patients' samples without informed consent in case of death.\n\nThe PyroMark Q24 system (Qiagen) was used for pyrosequencing analysis of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations. In brief, PCR templates for pyrosequencing were amplified from 10 ng of DNA using therascreen KRAS, NRAS, RAS, extension and BRAF Pyro Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The biotinylated PCR products were placed in 24-well plates and bound to streptavidin-coated sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The PCR products were denatured, and the nonbiotinylated fragments were washed from the beads using the Pyromark Q24 Vacuum Workstation (Qiagen). The beads were then resuspended in annealing buffer containing 0.4 pmol/L of the sequencing primer. Raw data files were imported into Pyromark Q24 software (version 2.0; Qiagen) for further analysis following pyrosequencing. For mutations in PIK3CA we used the PI3K Mutation Test Kit (Qiagen), a real-time PCR assay for the detection of 4 somatic mutations in exons 9 and 20. The kit uses a real-time PCR assay based on ARMS PCR technology combined with Scorpions detection technology. The PI3K Mutation Test Kit includes a control assay and 3 mutation assays to assess the total DNA in a sample and the presence or absence of mutated DNA. Twenty nanograms of DNA were amplified as well as negative and positive controls, using the LightCycler 480 software release 1.5.1 (Roche) and mutations were identified calculating ΔCt (Delta Ct) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nIn the cohort of patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab, no mutations were detected in 102 of 255 (40%) tumors with none of the three techniques used in the study. There was an invalid result in the cobas test and two invalid results in the dPCR test. One hundred and one of 255 (39.6%) tumors harbored one mutation detected by cobas and 18 of them showed multiple mutations. One hundred of 255 (39.2%) tumors harbored one mutation detected by therascreen pyro and 15 of them showed multiple mutations. Mutations analyzed by both techniques were frequently located in KRAS followed by PIK3CA, NRAS, and BRAF as described in Supplementary Table S3. Analysis by dPCR increased the number of patients bearing mutations up to 119 of 255 (46.7%) and identified multiple additional low-frequency mutant alleles in 34 cases. In this setting, KRAS mutations were further overrepresented (81/255; 31.8%) followed by NRAS (33/255; 12.9%), BRAF (17/255; 6.7%), and PIK3CA (8/255, 3.1%; Supplementary Table S3). Sixty-four tumors scored as positive with the three techniques, and the percentage of mutant alleles by quantitative nanofluidic dPCR ranged from 0.2% to 64.5% (median, 46.3%). The percentage of mutant alleles in the 57 tumors detected only by dPCR ranged from 0.04% to 41.5% (median, 2.1%).\n\nIn the group of patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy, radiological tumor response was evaluable in 223 of the 255 patients. Regarding the treatment administered in this specific cohort, 30 patients (13.45%) received cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy (23 of them were chemonaïve for metastatic disease), 75 patients (33.63%) received an irinotecan + anti-EGFR regimen and 118 patients (52.91%) were treated with a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen (78 of them in the first-line or neoadjuvant/post-metastasectomy setting). Overall response rate (ORR) in this subgroup of patients was 40.3%. We further evaluated response rate according to mutational profile (Table 3). KRAS exon 2 wild-type population identified by cobas test presented an ORR of 42.7% [76 responders (89.4%) received anti-EGFR in combination with chemotherapy—19 and 24 patients in the neoadjuvant/post-metastasectomy and first-line setting, respectively—and 9 responders were treated with anti-EGFR monotherapy). Four of the KRAS exon 2 mutated patients responded to anti-EGFR regimens [chemotherapy and anti-EGFR in the neoadjuvant/post-metastasectomy setting (3/4) or in first line]. Extended RAS identified 16 additional RAS mutant mCRC patients with tumor response, 10 of them treated with anti-EGFR in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or first-line setting and 2 of them treated only with panitumumab in first line. BRAF genotyping identified 8 additional mutated cases, 2 of them responders (both treated in combination with chemotherapy in first line). RAS/BRAF analysis by cobas increased the response rate up to 45.8% and 26.9% in wild-type and mutated populations, respectively. Analysis of KRAS exon 2 by therascreen pyro kit identified 24 mutated cases, 5 of them responders (one of them treated with anti-EGFR monotherapy in first line, two of them treated in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and post-metastasectomy setting, and the other 2 patients treated in second and third line with chemotherapy). This reclassification translated into an ORR of 42.7% in the KRAS exon 2 wild-type subgroup [73 responders (91.2%) received a combination of chemotherapy and anti-EGFR—18 and 24 patients in the neoadjuvant/post-metastasectomy and first-line setting, respectively—and 11 responders received cetuximab or panitumumab alone]. Extended RAS identified 15 additional mutated tumors with radiological response (5 and 6 patients treated in first-line and neoadjuvant/post-metastasectomy setting, respectively). BRAF genotyping identified 11 additional mutated cases (2 of them responders and treated in first line). We have to point out that only one of the RAS/BRAF mutated tumors that responded was treated with anti-EGFR monotherapy. Extended RAS and BRAF panel by therascreen increased response rate up to 48.3% and 25% in wild-type and mutated populations, respectively. Qualitative dPCR genotyping (limit of detection of the technique, 0.05%–0.1% of mutant alleles) of KRAS exon 2 translated into an ORR of 41.7% in the KRAS exon 2 wild-type population. Sixty-seven KRAS exon 2 wild-type responders (91.8%) received a combination of anti-EGFR and chemotherapy (38 of them as neoadjuvant/postmetastasectomy or first-line therapy) and 6 responders received anti-EGFR monotherapy (5 of them in the first-line setting). The extended RAS genotyping reclassified 39 additional mutated cases. Nine of these patients responded to treatment (everyone received anti-EGFR monotherapy), that was administered as first-line or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 5 of them. Finally, the BRAF analysis identified 11 additional mutated cases, 3 of them responders (all of them treated with anti-EGFR in the first-line setting). The ORR in the RAS/BRAF wild-type subset increased up to 48.8%, whereas ORR in patients reclassified as RAS/BRAF mutated by qualitative dPCR was 29.6%. It is noteworthy that most of the RAS/BRAF-mutated tumors classified as responders were treated with anti-EGFR and chemotherapy combination (26 out of 29 cases), as described with cobas and therascreen pyro. Moreover, approximately 90% of the KRAS exon 2 wild-type patients with a partial or complete response received cetuximab or panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy.\n\nThe likelihood ratio of positive test analysis was performed to estimate the optimal clinically relevant threshold cutoff value of mutant alleles in the prediction of response. For dPCR, the categorization of a fraction of 1% or higher for any mutant allele offered the best likelihood ratio of positive test for all combinations of RAS and BRAF analysis (Supplementary Table S4) delivering the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. The ORR using the 1% cutoff in the population with KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors was 43.2%, whereas ORR in patients reclassified as KRAS exon 2 mutated tumors was 24.2% (Table 3). The extended RAS genotyping reclassified 37 additional mutated cases (8 responders out of 37) which translate into a higher ORR (48.4%) in the RAS wild-type cases. The ORR among RAS extended mutated reclassified group was 22.9%. Finally, the BRAF analysis identified 12 additional mutated cases. The ORR in this RAS/BRAF wild-type subset was 50.4%, whereas ORR in patients reclassified as RAS/BRAF mutated by qualitative dPCR with 1% cutoff was 23.2%. When compared with qualitative detection of dPCR, the use of 1% cutoff reclassified as wild-type 16 patients: 10 responders and 6 nonresponders. Of the 6 nonresponder cases now reclassified as wild-type, 5 had stable disease while in the remaining 1 disease progressed. We have also calculated ORR with different cutoffs (1% to 5%) but the 1% is the best scenario for the ORR compared with the others (Supplementary Table S5).\n\nAdditionally, we differentiated patients treated with anti-EGFR in two groups: patients treated with anti-EGFR in first-line setting and patients treated with anti-EGFR in second-line or beyond, and evaluated the impact of gene mutations on survival (Supplementary Table S7). Eighty-three patients (32.6%) received cetuximab or panitumumab (60 of them in combination with chemotherapy) as first-line treatment and were defined as “chemosensitives,” and 99 patients (38.8%) received anti-EGFR drugs after first-line treatment failure (89 of them in combination with chemotherapy). KRAS exon 2 mutations had no impact on survival in the chemosensitive group. Only RAS mutations assessed by dPCR with a threshold of 1% increased the risk of progression compared with wild-type tumors or with less than 1% of MAF (HR = 1.79, 95% CI, 1.05–3.05). We observed similar results when we extended the mutational analysis to RAS and BRAF. Once again, the cutoff of 1% better discriminated patients likely to benefit from anti-EGFR therapy with an HR of 2.03 (95 % CI, 1.20–3.43). In terms of OS, RAS and BRAF mutations assessed by cobas, therascreen, or dPCR were significantly associated with poor outcome. Similar results were observed in the group of patients treated with anti-EGFR drugs after first-line tumor progression, although in this setting, RAS and BRAF mutations were related to worse PFS, independently of the technique used.\n\nNowadays, expanded RAS and BRAF analyses should be performed in mCRC patients to establish the best therapeutic strategy. Several commercial platforms are used in clinical practice for RAS testing, although none of them is considered the standard of care (13). We have used three different techniques, the commercial cobas and therascreen pyro assays and the digital PCR by Fluidigm, for the analysis of mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, and we then compared the sensitivity and predictive capability to anti-EGFR- and bevacizumab-based regimens. As expected, the most common gene mutation was located in KRAS exon 2. We have to point out that the panel of hotspots analyzed by each technique was slightly different. In this context, it was expected that the frequency of gene mutations differed between techniques. Nevertheless, dPCR identified mutations in approximately 62% tumors compared with 55% of mutated tumors identified by cobas or therascreen due to its higher analytical sensitivity. dPCR is a highly sensitive and quantitative method with a limit of detection or sensitivity < 0.1%. Because of this higher technical sensitivity, dPCR increased the mutation rate up to 62% with a range of MAF between 0.04% and 85.4%. When we analyzed the concordance between tests, we observed a high agreement (Cohen's kappa ≈ 0.90) if we considered KRAS exon 2 and a limit of detection of 10%. However, the level of agreement decreased when we compared cobas and therascreen with dPCR with a limit of detection of 1%–10% or <1% and is even lower when we included in the mutational analysis RAS (KRAS exons 3, 4 and NRAS exon, 2, 3, 4) and BRAF. Taking into account that there was no bias in tumor sample selection because we selected one paraffin block per patient with a minimum of tumor cells for DNA extraction and subsequent DNA mutational analysis by the three techniques, our results demonstrated that quantitative dPCR is more sensitive than cobas and therascreen for RAS testing.\n\nIn terms of treatment efficacy, we have observed that the clinical outcomes of patients treated with bevacizumab are independent of RAS mutational status, as previously reported (16). We have also confirmed that RAS mutational status is associated with anti-EGFR treatment outcome in the first-line setting and beyond. This is in line with the results published from different clinical trials in metastatic disease. Pivotal studies with anti-EGFR drugs have analyzed the mutational status of RAS by different techniques (13). The PRIME study used Sanger sequencing and WAVE-based SURVEYOR Scan Kits from Transgenomic for RAS and BRAF testing and detected 52% RAS-mutated tumors (2). RAS mutational analysis in the Crystal study was performed by BEAMing and detected mutations in 43% of tumors (1). Similar RAS mutation rates are reported in the literature, but it is remarkable that the analytical sensitivity of the tests is around 5% to 10%. Highly sensitive methods such as digital PCR or BEAMing are able to identify minor mutated sub-clones present in a low proportion (limit of detection < 0.01%; refs. 17, 18). Both methods have demonstrated to improve the selection of patients more likely to benefit from anti-EGFR therapies; however, a discrepancy in the definition of the optimal cutoff for anti-EGFR treatment was observed (1, 14, 15). To identify the fraction of mutated allele that correlates with resistance to anti-EGFR agents is still a challenge. Our results have confirmed the findings previously reported by Laurent-Puig and colleagues and our own group (14, 15). We have observed that RAS mutational status assessed by dPCR with a threshold of 1% identifies candidates for cetuximab or panitumumab with better clinical outcomes in terms of ORR, PFS, and OS than any of the platforms and sensitivity thresholds, confirming the results we reported from a smaller series of chemorefractory mCRC (14). Overall, the response rate in the RAS/BRAF wild-type group of patients increased around 5% in both series when we compared the dPCR with a cutoff of 1% with a conventional analytical method (either real-time PCR or cobas). However, we need to be cautious because a relevant percentage of patients with mutated tumors (around 20% across different analyses) responded to anti-EGFR regimens. Recent publications of clinical randomized trials have reported results on response rate in the mutated RAS tumors population treated with anti-EGFR and chemotherapy with ORR of 34% to 15% (1, 19). This can be explained by the chemotherapy effect in most of them but not all, and is a fact that must stimulate continuous research for finding better prediction models beyond RAS mutational analyses (20).\n\nA number of limitations of our study need to be highlighted. First, there was no validation cohort to validate the mutation rates for each of the three tests, their concordance, and the prediction of disease outcome. Second, this is a retrospective and pooled analysis of a highly heterogeneous series of patients treated with different chemotherapy regimens and biologicals. Finally, we have analyzed only patients treated with bevacizumab or anti-EGFR containing regimens in a nonrandomized fashion. We have therefore only analyzed clinical outcomes of those patients with tumors with and without mutations assessed by different methods. To validate our results, a similar analysis should be performed in prospective and randomized clinical trials (20). Tumors from patients included in the CAPRI GOIM trial were tested for RAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA by next-generation sequencing and suggested that fraction of neoplastic cells carrying a specific molecular alteration (RAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) could correlate with the level of resistance to anti-EGFR agents (21). Additionally, we have recently completed accrual of the prospective TTD ULTRA clinical trial (clinical trial identifier: NCT01704703) which will provide relevant information about the utility of highly sensitive methods in DNA testing for clinical practice."
