Upon graduation, he joined Motorola’s System and Space Technology Group in Scottsdale, Arizona, as a design engineer for imaging satellites and data encryption systems. While there, he also continued his education at Arizona State University, obtaining a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree.\n\nAfter working at Motorola for several years, Dr. Moore set his sights on the home of high-tech innovation in Silicon Valley (Santa Clara) California. There, he had a successful career at numerous start-up semiconductor companies as a field and product marketing engineer. One of the startup companies where Dr. Moore worked, AANetcom, was acquired in March 2000 by PMC-Sierra for $890 million dollars. Unfortunately Dr. Moore, like many others, ignored his MBA and delayed pressing the “sell” button falsely believing in the “New Economy.” An expensive lesson indeed. After surviving the rise and fall of the dot-com era, Dr. Moore decided to change course and follow a calling to higher education. Dr. Moore returned to college to obtain a Ph.D. in Finance at The University of Tennessee in Knoxville. His first years as a professor at the University of Memphis were very rewarding.
