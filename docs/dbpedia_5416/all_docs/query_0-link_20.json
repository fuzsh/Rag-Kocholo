        "meta_description": "Abstract. Alpine ecosystems of the southern Iberian Peninsula are among the\nmost vulnerable and the first to respond to modern climate change in\nsouthwestern Europe. While major environmental shifts have occurred over the\nlast â¼1500Â years in these alpine ecosystems, only changes in\nthe recent centuries have led to abrupt environmental responses, but factors\nimposing the strongest stress have been unclear until now. To understand\nthese environmental responses, this study, for the first time, has\ncalibrated an algal lipid-derived temperature proxy (based on long-chain\nalkyl diols) to instrumental historical data extending alpine temperature\nreconstructions to 1500Â years before present. These novel results highlight\nthe enhanced effect of greenhouse gases on alpine temperatures during the\nlast â¼200Â years and the long-term modulating role of solar\nforcing. This study also shows that the warming rate during the 20th\ncentury (â¼0.18ââC per decade) was double that of the last\nstages of the Little Ice Age (â¼0.09ââC per decade), even\nexceeding temperature trends of the high-altitude Alps during the 20th\ncentury. As a consequence, temperature exceeded the preindustrial record\nin the 1950s, and it has been one of the major forcing processes of the recent enhanced\nchange in these alpine ecosystems from southern Iberia since then. Nevertheless, other\nfactors reducing the snow and ice albedo (e.g., atmospheric deposition) may\nhave influenced local glacier loss, since almost steady climate conditions\npredominated from the middle 19th century to the first decades of the\n20th century.",

Padul is a classical and very unique site from the Mediterranean area as it contains a very long and continuous Quaternary sedimentary record. However, the uppermost part of the record was never recovered. In this study we focus on the last 4700 cal yr BP of Holocene climate variability and human activity in the Mediterranean area.\n\nHolocene land cover change in North America: continental trends, regional drivers, and implications for vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks\n\nAndria Dawson, John W.

Using pollen records and statistical modeling, we reconstruct Holocene land cover for North America. We determine patterns and magnitudes of land cover changes across scales. We attribute land cover changes to ecological, climatic, and human drivers. These reconstructions provide benchmarks for Earth System Models.\n\nMOPREDAScentury: a long-term monthly precipitation grid for the Spanish mainland\n\nSantiago BeguerÃ­a, Dhais PeÃ±a-Angulo, VÃ­ctor Trullenque-Blanco, and Carlos GonzÃ¡lez-Hidalgo\n\nEarth Syst.

The dataset combines ground observations from the Spanish National Climate Data Bank and new data rescued from meteorological yearbooks published prior to 1951, which almost doubled the number of weather stations available during the first decades of the 20th century. Geostatistical techniques were used to interpolate a regular 10 x 10 km grid.\n\nReconstructing burnt area during the Holocene: an Iberian case study\n\nYicheng Shen, Luke Sweeney, Mengmeng Liu, Jose Antonio Lopez Saez, SebastiÃ¡n PÃ©rez-DÃ­az, Reyes Luelmo-Lautenschlaeger, Graciela Gil-Romera, Dana Hoefer, Gonzalo JimÃ©nez-Moreno, Heike Schneider, I.

We use this method to reconstruct changes in burnt area over the past 12 000 years from sites in Iberia. We show that regional changes in burnt area reflect known changes in climate, with a high burnt area during warming intervals and low burnt area when the climate was cooler and/or wetter than today.\n\nThe Reading Palaeofire Database: an expanded global resource to document changes in fire regimes from sedimentary charcoal records\n\nSandy P.

The shape of these responses appears to be time-period specific.\n\nA 406-year non-growing-season precipitation reconstruction in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau\n\nMaierdang Keyimu, Zongshan Li, Bojie Fu, Guohua Liu, Fanjiang Zeng, Weiliang Chen, Zexin Fan, Keyan Fang, Xiuchen Wu, and Xiaochun Wang\n\nClim. Past, 17, 2381–2392, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2381-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2381-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe created a residual tree-ring width chronology and reconstructed non-growth-season precipitation (NGSP) over the period spanning 1600–2005 in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP), China. Reconstruction model verification as well as similar variations of NGSP reconstruction and Palmer Drought Severity Index reconstructions from the surrounding region indicate the reliability of the present reconstruction. Our reconstruction is representative of NGSP variability of a large region in the SETP.\n\nClimatic variations during the Holocene inferred from radiocarbon and stable carbon isotopes in speleothems from a high-alpine cave\n\nCaroline Welte, Jens Fohlmeister, Melina Wertnik, Lukas Wacker, Bodo Hattendorf, Timothy I. Eglinton, and Christoph SpÃ¶tl\n\nClim. Past, 17, 2165–2177, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2165-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2165-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStalagmites are valuable climate archives, but unlike other proxies the use of stable carbon isotopes (Î´13C) is still difficult. A stalagmite from the Austrian Alps was analyzed using a new laser ablation method for fast radiocarbon (14C) analysis. This allowed 14C and Î´13C to be combined, showing that besides soil and bedrock a third source is contributing during periods of warm, wet climate: old organic matter.\n\nWinterâspring warming in the North Atlantic during the last 2000Â years: evidence from southwest Iceland\n\nNora Richter, James M. Russell, Johanna Garfinkel, and Yongsong Huang\n\nClim. Past, 17, 1363–1383, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1363-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1363-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a reconstruction of winter–spring temperatures developed using organic proxies preserved in well-dated lake sediments from southwest Iceland to assess seasonal temperature changes in the North Atlantic region over the last 2000 years. The gradual warming trend observed in our record is likely influenced by sea surface temperatures, which are sensitive to changes in ocean circulation and seasonal insolation, during the winter and spring season.\n\nClimate reconstructions based on GDGT and pollen surface datasets from Mongolia and Baikal area: calibrations and applicability to extremely coldâdry environments over the Late Holocene\n\nLucas Dugerdil, SÃ©bastien Joannin, Odile Peyron, Isabelle Jouffroy-Bapicot, Boris VanniÃ¨re, Bazartseren Boldgiv, Julia Unkelbach, Hermann Behling, and Guillemette MÃ©not\n\nClim. Past, 17, 1199–1226, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1199-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1199-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSince the understanding of Holocene climate change appears to be a relevant issue for future climate change, the paleoclimate calibrations have to be improved. Here, surface samples from Mongolia and Siberia were analyzed to provide new calibrations for pollen and biomarker climate models. These calibrations appear to be more powerful than global calibrations, especially in an arid central Asian context. These calibrations will improve the understanding of monsoon Holocene oscillations.\n\nSampling density and date along with species selection influence spatial representation of tree-ring reconstructions\n\nJustin T. Maxwell, Grant L. Harley, Trevis J. Matheus, Brandon M. Strange, Kayla Van Aken, Tsun Fung Au, and Joshua C. Bregy\n\nClim. Past, 16, 1901–1916, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-1901-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-1901-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe found that increasing the density of chronologies in the tree-ring network resulted in estimated soil moisture conditions that better matched the spatial variability of the values that were instrumentally recorded for droughts and, to a lesser extent, pluvials. By sampling trees in 2010 compared to 1980, the sensitivity of tree rings to soil moisture decreased in the southern portion of our region, where severe drought conditions have been absent over recent decades.\n\nChanges in high-intensity precipitation on the northern Apennines (Italy) as revealed by multidisciplinary data over the last 9000 years\n\nStefano Segadelli, Federico Grazzini, Veronica Rossi, Margherita Aguzzi, Silvia Marvelli, Marco Marchesini, Alessandro Chelli, Roberto Francese, Maria Teresa De Nardo, and Sandro Nanni\n\nClim.

A detailed study of recent flash-flood deposits compared with fossil peat bog and lake sediments supports the expected increase in precipitation intensity during warm climatic phases.\n\nNeoglacial trends in diatom dynamics from a small alpine lake in the Qinling mountains of central China\n\nBo Cheng, Jennifer Adams, Jianhui Chen, Aifeng Zhou, Qing Zhang, and Anson W.

Past, 16, 543–554, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-543-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-543-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Qinling mountains in China are biodiversity rich. We studied one of the high-latitude lakes on Mount Taibai with a view to looking at how aquatic diversity responded to long-term changes in climate over the past 3500 years. We specifically looked at a group of single-celled algae called diatoms, as they are very sensitive to the environment. We found that these algae changed gradually over time, but they showed abrupt change during the period known as the Little Ice Age, about 400 years ago.\n\nCentennial- to millennial-scale monsoon changes since the last deglaciation linked to solar activities and North Atlantic cooling\n\nXingxing Liu, Youbin Sun, Jef Vandenberghe, Peng Cheng, Xu Zhang, Evan J. Gowan, Gerrit Lohmann, and Zhisheng An\n\nClim. Past, 16, 315–324, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-315-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-315-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe East Asian summer monsoon and winter monsoon are anticorrelated on a centennial timescale during 16–1 ka. The centennial monsoon variability is connected to changes of both solar activity and North Atlantic cooling events during the Early Holocene. Then, North Atlantic cooling became the major forcing of events during the Late Holocene. This work presents the great challenge and potential to understand the response of the monsoon system to global climate changes in the past and the future.\n\nReconstructing seasonality through stable-isotope and trace-element analyses of the Proserpine stalagmite, Han-sur-Lesse cave, Belgium: indications for climate-driven changes during the last 400 years\n\nStef Vansteenberge, Niels J. de Winter, Matthias Sinnesael, Sophie Verheyden, Steven Goderis, Stijn J.

Our sub-annual resolution dataset allows us to investigate how the chemistry of this speleothem recorded changes in the environment and climate in northwestern Europe. We then use this information to reconstruct climate change during the 16th and 17th century on the seasonal scale and demonstrate that environmental change drives speleothem chemistry.\n\nTwo millennia of Main region (southern Germany) hydroclimate variability\n\nAlexander Land, Sabine Remmele, Jutta Hofmann, Daniel Reichle, Margaret Eppli, Christian Zang, Allan Buras, Sebastian Hein, and Reiner Zimmermann\n\nClim.

The ring series are sensitive to the sum of rainfall from 26 February to 6 July. This region suffered from severe, long-lasting droughts in the past two millennia (e.g., ADâ500/510s, 940s, 1170s, 1390s and 1160s). In the ADâ550s, 1050s, 1310s and 1480s, multi-year periods with high rainfall hit the region.\n\nCombining a pollen and macrofossil synthesis with climate simulations for spatial reconstructions of European climate using Bayesian filtering\n\nNils Weitzel, Andreas Hense, and Christian Ohlwein\n\nClim.

The approach is applied to reconstruct summer and winter temperature in Europe during the mid-Holocene. Our reconstructions account for multiple sources of uncertainty and are well suited for quantitative statistical analyses of the climate under different forcing conditions.\n\nLignin oxidation products as a potential proxy for vegetation and environmental changes in speleothems and cave drip water â a first record from the Herbstlabyrinth, central Germany\n\nInken Heidke, Denis Scholz, and Thorsten Hoffmann\n\nClim. Past, 15, 1025–1037, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-1025-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-1025-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis is the first quantitative study of lignin biomarkers in stalagmites and cave drip water. Lignin is only produced by higher plants; therefore, its analysis can be used to reconstruct the vegetation of the past. We compared our lignin results with stable isotope and trace element records from the same samples and found correlations or similarities with P, Ba, U and Mg concentrations as well as δ13C values. These results can help to better interpret other vegetation proxies.\n\nHow dry was the Younger Dryas?

Besides the well-documented effects of temperature derived from tree-ring width and latewood density, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in tree-ring cellulose provide information about moisture and sunshine duration changes after the events.\n\nThe 4.2 ka BP Event in the Mediterranean region: an overview\n\nMonica Bini, Giovanni Zanchetta, Aurel PerÅoiu, Rosine Cartier, Albert CatalÃ , Isabel Cacho, Jonathan R.

We reviewed selected proxies to infer regional climate patterns between 4.3 and 3.8 ka. Temperature data suggest a cooling anomaly, even if this is not uniform, whereas winter was drier, along with dry summers. However, some exceptions to this prevail, where wetter condition seems to have persisted, suggesting regional heterogeneity.\n\nTechnical note: Optimizing the utility of combined GPR, OSL, and Lidar (GOaL) to extract paleoenvironmental records and decipher shoreline evolution\n\nAmy J.

Although the decline in summer insolation was an important factor, a combination of superposed changes in ocean circulation and explosive Icelandic volcanism were likely responsible for the abrupt perturbation recorded by our proxies. Lake and catchment proxies recovered to a colder equilibrium state following the perturbation.\n\nHydroclimatic variations in southeastern China during the 4.2 ka event reflected by stalagmite records\n\nHaiwei Zhang, Hai Cheng, Yanjun Cai, Christoph SpÃ¶tl, Gayatri Kathayat, Ashish Sinha, R.

Based on stalagmite records from monsoonal China, we found that north China was dry but south China was wet during this event. We propose that the rain belt remained longer at its southern position, giving rise to a pronounced humidity gradient between north and south China.\n\nFire, vegetation, and Holocene climate in a southeastern Tibetan lake: a multi-biomarker reconstruction from Paru Co\n\nAlice Callegaro, Dario Battistel, Natalie M.

The early Holocene shows oscillations between grasses and conifers, with smouldering fires represented by levoglucosan peaks, and high-temperature fires represented by PAHs. The lack of human FeSts excludes local human influence on fire and vegetation changes. Late Holocene displays an increase in local to regional combustion.\n\nClimate impact on the development of Pre-Classic Maya civilisation\n\nKees Nooren, Wim Z. Hoek, Brian J.

A cold event in the Era of Disunity, the Sui-Tang Warm Period, the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age can all be recognized in our record, as well as in many other temperature reconstructions in China. Local wars in Shanxi Province, documented in the historical literature during the past 2700 years, are statistically significantly correlated with changes in temperature.\n\nInsights into Atlantic multidecadal variability using the Last Millennium Reanalysis framework\n\nHansi K.

We study the AMO over the last 2000 years using a novel proxy framework, the Last Millennium Reanalysis. We find that the AMO is linked to continental warming, Arctic sea ice retreat, and an Atlantic precipitation shift. Low clouds decrease globally. We find no distinct multidecadal spectral peak in the AMO over the last 2 millennia, suggesting that human activities may have enhanced the AMO in the modern era.\n\nThree distinct Holocene intervals of stalagmite deposition and nondeposition revealed in NW Madagascar, and their paleoclimate implications\n\nNy Riavo Gilbertinie Voarintsoa, Loren Bruce Railsback, George Albert Brook, Lixin Wang, Gayatri Kathayat, Hai Cheng, Xianglei Li, Richard Lawrence Edwards, Amos Fety Michel Rakotondrazafy, and Marie Olga Madison Razanatseheno\n\nClim.

We examined the bias induced by the human impact on vegetation in a climate reconstruction for temperate eastern China by comparing the deviations in the reconstructed results for a fossil record based on two pollen–climate calibration sets. Climatic signals in pollen assemblages are indeed obscured by human impact; however, the extent of the bias could be assessed.\n\nA dual-biomarker approach for quantification of changes in relative humidity from sedimentary lipid DâH ratios\n\nOliver Rach, Ansgar Kahmen, Achim Brauer, and Dirk Sachse\n\nClim.

However, data reconstructed from proxies have been assimilated, as opposed to the actual proxy values, which prevented full utilization of the information recorded in the proxies. This study propose a new data assimilation system in which actual proxy data are directly assimilated.\n\nA chironomid-based mean July temperature inference model from the south-east margin of the Tibetan Plateau, China\n\nEnlou Zhang, Jie Chang, Yanmin Cao, Hongqu Tang, Pete Langdon, James Shulmeister, Rong Wang, Xiangdong Yang, and Ji Shen\n\nClim.

The transfer functions yield reliable reconstructions that are comparable to the instrumental record. The application of this new tool will provide long-term quantitative palaeoclimate estimates from south-western China which is a critical region for understanding the dynamic and evolution of the Indian Ocean south-west Monsoon system.\n\nAssessing performance and seasonal bias of pollen-based climate reconstructions in a perfect model world\n\nKira Rehfeld, Mathias Trachsel, Richard J.

Transfer functions convert relative counts of species to a climatologically meaningful scale (e.g. annual mean temperature in degrees C). We show that the fundamental assumptions in the algorithms impact the reconstruction results in he idealized model world, in particular if the reconstructed variables were not ecologically relevant.\n\nQuantitative reconstruction of summer precipitation using a mid-Holocene Î´13C common millet record from Guanzhong Basin, northern China\n\nQing Yang, Xiaoqiang Li, Xinying Zhou, Keliang Zhao, and Nan Sun\n\nClim. Past, 12, 2229–2240, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-2229-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-2229-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe fossilized seeds of common millet are suited to the production of quantitative Holocene precipitation reconstructions. Our reconstructed results showed that summer precipitation from 7.7–3.4 ka BP was ~ 50 mm, or 17 % higher than present levels. Maximal mean summer precipitation peaked at 414 mm during 6.1–5.5 ka BP, ~ 109 mm, or 36 % higher than today, indicating the EASM peaked at this time. This work can provide a new proxy for further research into continuous paleoprecipitation sequences.\n\nNorth Atlantic Oscillation controls on oxygen and hydrogen isotope gradients in winter precipitation across Europe; implications for palaeoclimate studies\n\nMichael Deininger, Martin Werner, and Frank McDermott\n\nClim. Past, 12, 2127–2143, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-2127-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-2127-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the NAO (Northern Atlantic Oscillation)-related mechanisms that control winter precipitation stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope gradients across Europe. The results show that past longitudinal stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope gradients in European rainfall stored in palaeoclimate archives (e.g. speleothems) can be used to infer the past winter NAO modes from its variations.\n\nA 368-year maximum temperature reconstruction based on tree-ring data in the northwestern Sichuan Plateau (NWSP), China\n\nLiangjun Zhu, Yuandong Zhang, Zongshan Li, Binde Guo, and Xiaochun Wang\n\nClim. Past, 12, 1485–1498, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1485-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1485-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a 368-year late summer maximum temperature reconstruction based on spruce tree rings. It touches on the critical topic of climate reconstruction in the eastern edge of Tibetan Plateau and represents an extension and enhancement of climate records for this area. The Little Ice Age was well represented and 20th century warming was not obvious in this reconstruction. This temperature variation may be affected by global land–sea atmospheric circulation as well as solar and volcanic forcing.\n\nInferring late-Holocene climate in the Ecuadorian Andes using a chironomid-based temperature inference model\n\nFrazer Matthews-Bird, Stephen J. Brooks, Philip B. Holden, Encarni Montoya, and William D. Gosling\n\nClim. Past, 12, 1263–1280, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1263-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1263-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChironomidae are a family of two-winged aquatic fly of the order Diptera. The family is species rich (> 5000 described species) and extremely sensitive to environmental change, particualy temperature. Across the Northern Hemisphere, chironomids have been widely used as paleotemperature proxies as the chitinous remains of the insect are readily preserved in lake sediments. This is the first study using chironomids as paleotemperature proxies in tropical South America.\n\nA high-altitude peatland record of environmental changes in the NW Argentine Andes (24 Â°â¯S) over the last 2100 years\n\nKarsten Schittek, Sebastian T. Kock, Andreas LÃ¼cke, Jonathan Hense, Christian Ohlendorf, Julio J. Kulemeyer, Liliana C. Lupo, and Frank SchÃ¤bitz\n\nClim. Past, 12, 1165–1180, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1165-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1165-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCushion peatlands are versatile climate archives for the study of past environmental changes. We present the environmental history for the last 2100 years of Cerro Tuzgle peatland, which is located in the NW Argentine Puna. The results reflect prominent late Holocene climate anomalies and provide evidence that Northern Hemisphere climate oscillations were extensive. Volcanic forcing at the beginning of the 19th century seems to have had an impact on climatic settings in the Central Andes\n\nTechnical note: The Linked Paleo Data framework â a common tongue for paleoclimatology\n\nNicholas P. McKay and Julien Emile-Geay\n\nClim. Past, 12, 1093–1100, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1093-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1093-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe lack of accepted data formats and data standards in paleoclimatology is a growing problem that slows progress in the field. Here, we propose a preliminary data standard for paleoclimate data, general enough to accommodate all the proxy and measurement types encountered in a large international collaboration (PAGES 2k). We also introduce a data format for such structured data (Linked Paleo Data, or LiPD), leveraging recent advances in knowledge representation (Linked Open Data).\n\nA Bayesian hierarchical model for reconstructing relative sea level: from raw data to rates of change\n\nNiamh Cahill, Andrew C. Kemp, Benjamin P. Horton, and Andrew C. Parnell\n\nClim. Past, 12, 525–542, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-525-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-525-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe propose a Bayesian model for the reconstruction and analysis of former sea levels. The model provides a single, unifying framework for reconstructing and analyzing sea level through time with fully quantified uncertainty. We illustrate our approach using a case study of Common Era (last 2000 years) sea levels from New Jersey.\n\nInferring climate variability from nonlinear proxies: application to palaeo-ENSO studies\n\nJ. Emile-Geay and M. Tingley\n\nClim. Past, 12, 31–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-31-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-31-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIgnoring nonlinearity in palaeoclimate records (e.g. continental run-off proxies) runs the risk of severely overstating changes in climate variability. Even with the correct model and parameters, some information is irretrievably lost by such proxies. However, we find that a simple empirical transform can do much to improve the situation, and makes them amenable to classical analyses. Doing so on two palaeo-ENSO records markedly changes some of the quantitative inferences made from such records.\n\nTechnical Note: How accurate can stalagmite formation temperatures be determined using vapour bubble radius measurements in fluid inclusions?\n\nF. Spadin, D. Marti, R. Hidalgo-Staub, J. RiÄka, D. Fleitmann, and M. Frenz\n\nClim. Past, 11, 905–913, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-11-905-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-11-905-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFluid inclusions inside stalagmites retain information on the cave temperature at the time they formed and thus can be used to reconstruct the continental climate of the past. A method for extracting this information based on a thermodynamic model and size measurements of femtosecond-laser-induced vapour bubbles is presented. Applying our method to stalagmites taken from the Milandre cave in the Swiss Jura Mountains demonstrate that palaeotemperatures can be determined with an accuracy of Â±1Â°C.\n\nCited articles"
