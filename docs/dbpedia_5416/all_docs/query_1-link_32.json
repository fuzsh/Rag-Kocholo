DOI: 10.1126/science.aay5733 | Abstract | Download | Publisher Website December 2020 Biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates worldwide. Yet cascading effects of biodiversity loss on other taxa are largely unknown because baseline data are often unavailable. We document the collapse of a Neotropical snake community after the invasive fungal pathogen <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> caused a chytridiomycosis epizootic leading to the catastrophic loss of amphibians, a food source for snakes. After mass mortality of amphibians, the snake community contained fewer species and was more homogeneous across the study site, with several species in poorer body condition, despite no other systematic changes in the environment. The demise of the snake community after amphibian loss demonstrates the repercussive and often unnoticed consequences of the biodiversity crisis and calls attention to the invisible declines of rare and data-deficient species.

Journal of Wildlife Management 86:e22158, https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22158. | Abstract January 2022 Effectively managing take of wildlife resulting from human activities poses a major challenge for applied conservation. Demographic data essential to decisions regarding take are often expensive to collect and are either not available or based on limited studies for many species. Therefore, modeling approaches that efficiently integrate available information are important to improving the scientific basis for sustainable take thresholds. We used the prescribed take level (PTL) framework to estimate allowable take for bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)in the conterminous United States. We developed an integrated population model (IPM) that incorporates multiple sources of information and then use the model output as the scientific basis for components of the PTL framework. Our IPM is structured to identify key parameters needed for the PTL and to quantify uncertainties in those parameters at the scale at which the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages take. Our IPM indicated that mean survival of birds >1 year old was high and precise (0.91, 95% CI = 0.90–0.92), whereas mean survival of first‐year eagles was lower and more variable(0.69, 95% CI = 0.62–0.78). We assumed that density dependence influenced recruitment by affecting the probability of breeding, which was highly imprecise and estimated to have declined from approximately 0.988 (95% CI = 0.985–0.993) to 0.66 (95% CI = 0.34–0.99) between 1994 and 2018. We sampled values from the posterior distributions of the IPM for use in the PTL and estimated that allowable take (e.g., permitted take for energy development, incidental collisions with human made structures, or removal of nests for development) ranged from approximately 12,000 to 20,000 individual eagles depending on risk tolerance and form of density dependence at the scale of the conterminous United States excluding the Southwest. Model‐based thresholds for allowable take can be inaccurate if the assumptions of the underlying framework are not met, if the influence of permitted take is under‐estimated, or if undetected population declines occur from other sources. Continued monitoring and use of the IPM and PTL frameworks to identify key uncertainties in bald eagle population dynamics and management of allowable take can mitigate this potential bias, especially where improved information could reduce the risk of permitting non‐sustainable take.

Deep Learning Models for Waterfowl Detection and Classification in Aerial Images. Information | Abstract March 2024 Waterfowl populations monitoring is essential for wetland conservation. Lately, deep 1 learning techniques have shown promising advancements in detecting waterfowl in aerial images. In 2 this paper, we present performance evaluation of several SOTA supervised and semi-supervised deep 3 learning models for waterfowl detection in aerial images using four new image datasets containing 4 197,642 annotations. The best-performing model, Faster R-CNN, achieved 95.38% accuracy in terms 5 of mAP. Semi-supervised learning models outperformed supervised models when the same amount 6 of labeled data were used for training. Additionally, we present performance evaluation of several 7 deep learning models on waterfowl classifications on aerial images using a new real-bird classification 8 dataset consisting of 6,986 examples and a new decoy classification dataset consisting of about 10,000 9 examples per category of 20 categories. The best model achieved accuracy of 91.58 % on the decoy 10 dataset and 82.88% on the real-bird dataset. Zhang, Q., J. Jin, P. Budy, S.E. Null, and X. Wang. 2021.

USGS FSP IP-127181. | Abstract December 2021 We investigated how lake thermal processes responded to whole-lake warming manipulation in a lake in the Alaskan Arctic through observations and numerical modeling. The warming manipulation was conducted by artificially heating the epilimnion as a proxy for climate warming. We performed numerical modeling and used an improved lake scheme based on the Community Land Model (CLM). We simulated a control run (CTL) without warming and a warming manipulation simulation (WARM). Results indicated the WARM simulation accurately captured observed lake temperature profiles where water stratification was extended in time, and water stability was strengthened. Two additional sensitivity tests with different warming onset dates and of the same warming duration showed that earlier onsets of warming are predicted to make the lake water column more stable and less easily mixed relative to a later onset of warming. The results of this study provide a more complete understanding of lake thermal processes in arctic freshwater lake systems and how they will respond to predicted future warming. Zentner, D., D.

Land 9:233. | Abstract | Download | Publisher Website April 2020 Connectivity and wildlife corridors are often key components to successful conservation and management plans. Connectivity for wildlife is typically modeled in a static environment that reflects a single snapshot in time. However, it has been shown that, when compared with dynamic connectivity models, static models can underestimate connectivity and mask important population processes. Therefore, including dynamism in connectivity models is important if the goal is to predict functional connectivity. We incorporated four levels of dynamism (individual, daily, seasonal, and interannual) into an individual-based movement model for black bears (Ursus americanus) in Massachusetts, USA. We used future development projections to model movement into the year 2050. We summarized habitat connectivity over the 32-year simulation period as the number of simulated movement paths crossing each pixel in our study area. Our results predict black bears will further colonize the expanding part of their range in the state and move beyond this range towards the greater Boston metropolitan area. This information is useful to managers for predicting and addressing human–wildlife conflict and in targeting public education campaigns on bear awareness. Including dynamism in connectivity models can produce more realistic models and, when future projections are incorporated, can ensure the identification of areas that offer long-term functional connectivity for wildlife.

Fisheries Management and Ecology 29:897-910. | Abstract October 2022 Walleye (<i>Sander vitreus</i>) natural recruitment has declined in many populations within the Ceded Territory of Wisconsin (CTWI) over the past twenty years. Using CTWI age-0 and age-1 walleye relative abundance (CPE) data during 1990-2019, we tested for abiotic and biotic (density dependence, cannibalism) factors influencing age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality. Age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality was strongly density-dependent. Juvenile walleye mortality was always elevated at high age-0 CPE and highly variable at low age-0 CPE. Cannibalism effects did not influence age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality. Mixed effects modeling results suggested that age-0 CPE (positive), May surface water temperature (positive), and peak surface water temperature (negative) were the strongest predictors of age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality. Our results suggest that density-dependence and environmental factors influencing spawning and ontogenetic phenology (climate change, variable ice-off dates), trophic mismatches, and metabolic and consumptive demand may dictate age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality. Our results also showed elevated age-0 to age-1 walleye mortality at low age-0 CPE, which supports previous findings of depensatory recruitment dynamics in CTWI walleye populations. Given observed natural recruitment declines observed in CTWI walleye populations over time, stocking has been primarily used to rehabilitate stocks. Our findings suggest that stocking on top of natural recruitment would further increase density-dependent juvenile walleye mortality rates. Additional research is needed to specifically address elevated juvenile walleye mortality at low adult stock sizes and/or with declining natural recruitment to inform conservation management decisions.

Ecological Modelling 440:109389 | Abstract | Download January 2021 Self-organization in reef-building systems is a process of establishing reef morphology on aquatic landscapes from substrate generated by the population, and reinforcing these structures through interactions between internal processes and external factors. In oyster reefs, internal dynamics include production of calcareous shell, which serves as settlement substrate for larval recruits. External factors include environmental conditions and predation, which regulate overall population size through growth and mortality, but also regulate settlement dynamics by exposing interior shell surfaces through mortality. Oyster reefs are also highly spatially constrained by aquatic conditions, thus their efficiency for producing settlement habitat under these constraints may be critical to self-organization and long term persistence. We developed an individual based model that simulates engineering of oyster reefs through individual contributions of shell, which slowly degrade and consolidate to form reef structure. Reef habitat has two aspects in this model, one for elevating the population above the benthos, and another for making exposed shell surfaces available for settlement. We applied the model to examine how these two aspects relate to the live population as a coupled system with complex feedbacks. In particular, we examined how temporal dynamics of the reef proceed through time as the size structure of the live population and relative composition of shell types change through time. To represent these dynamics, we simulated single restoration events and tracked ensuing dynamics over subsequent decades without additional enhancement, for an example study site in South Carolina (USA). To estimate uncertainty in restoration performance, we followed a biological ensemble modeling approach, varying selected model parameters over five scenarios of predator community composition. Our goal was to identify trends that were robust across simulations, which could serve as hypotheses and predictions for future field studies. The overall temporal pattern of simulations was three distinct phases: initial transient dynamics of the stocked population, followed by growth and saturation of the life population, and then saturation of settlement habitat several years later. All simulations incurred considerable loss of shell biomass during the transient phase when the live population was establishing and shell degradation exceeded production. Simulations with predators were able to recover from this decline through production of live oysters, while simulations without predators continued to decline throughout simulation runs. These results indicate that reefs can be productive with respect to the live population, but decline overall in reef substrate. We conclude with hypotheses relating the efficiency of generation of settlement habitat to measures of biomass and individual density, which suggest levels that may lead to reef self-organization.

Biological Conservation 249: 108698. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108698 | Abstract | Download | Publisher Website December 2020 Biodiversity loss is a major threat to the integrity of ecosystems and is projected to worsen, yet the path to successful conservation remains elusive. Decision support frameworks (DSFs) are increasingly applied by resource managers to navigate the complexity, uncertainty, and differing socio-ecological objectives inherent to conservation problems. Most published conservation research that uses DSFs focuses on analytical stages (e.g., identifying an optimal decision), making it difficult to assess and learn from previous examples in a conservation practice context. Here, we (1) evaluate the relationship between the application of decision science and the resulting conservation outcomes, and (2) identify and address existing barriers to the application of DSFs to conservation practice. To do this, we develop a framework for evaluating conservation initiatives using decision science that emphasizes setting attainable goals, building momentum, and obtaining partner buy-in. We apply this framework to a systematic review of amphibian conservation decision support projects, including a follow-up survey of the pertinent conservation practitioners, stakeholders, and scientists. We found that all projects identified optimal solutions to reach stated objectives, but positive conservation outcomes were limited when implementation challenges arose. Further, we identified multiple barriers (e.g., dynamic and hierarchical leadership, scale complexity, limited resource availability) that can inhibit the progression from decision identification to action implementation (i.e., ‘decision-implementation gap’), and to successful conservation outcomes. Based on these results, we provide potential actionable steps and avenues for future development of DSFs to facilitate the transition from decision to action and the realization of conservation successes.

Integrating monitoring and optimization modeling to inform flow decisions for Chinook salmon smolts. Ecological Modeling | Abstract July 2022 Monitoring is usually among the first actions taken to help inform recovery planning for declining species, but these data are rarely used formally to inform conservation decision making. For example, Central Valley Chinook salmon were once abundant, but anthropogenic activities have led to widespread habitat loss and degradation resulting in significant population declines. Juvenile Chinook salmon survival through the southern Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in particular, may be a limiting factor for juveniles outmigrating from the San Joaquin River and tributaries. However, survival and routing monitoring data have not been formally used to inform water management. Here, we illustrate how estimates derived from monitoring data can be used to inform water management and as a basis for developing adaptive management for flows. Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis of Chinook salmon smolt survival and routing estimates through the south Delta. We then used the resulting parameter estimates to develop a survival and routing simulation model to estimate optimal flows for the San Joaquin River during smolt outmigration from February–May. We found that large flow pulses at predictable times during the spring are projected to be optimal for increasing Chinook salmon smolt survival to the Bay and that optimal scenarios differed somewhat with water year type. Sensitivity analysis revealed temperature and smolt outmigration timing are driving optimal pulse distribution and that water allocation changes little with parameter uncertainty. This case study highlights the utility of the decision-analytic framework for solving conservation problems. Wohner, PJ, SA Laymon, JE Stanek, SL King, RJ Cooper. 2021. Challenging our understanding of western Yellow-billed Cuckoo habitat needs and accepted management practices. Restoration Ecology 29(3): e13331. https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.13331 | Abstract March 2021 <b>Riparian restoration in the southwestern United States frequently involves planting cottonwood (<i>Populus</i> spp.) and willow (<i>Salix</i> spp.) cuttings or seedlings. In the absence of flooding and gap-forming disturbance, planted forests often senesce without further young tree recruitment. This has largely been the case in riparian systems in California that historically supported state endangered western Yellow-billed Cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>; Cuckoo). Associated with riparian forest maturation has been around an 85% decline in Cuckoo population numbers in approximately the past thirty years. Other riparian species of concern show a concomitant decline, indicating the problem is not specific to Cuckoo. Although varying hypotheses exist for the recent decline, alternative management practices have not been sufficiently explored to rule out breeding ground habitat quality as a major contributing factor. Few intensive Cuckoo datasets currently exist to test hypotheses about breeding habitat quality due to extremely low populations in the remaining occupied sites. We used a historical (1986–1996) spot mapping dataset from the South Fork Kern River Valley, California to identify vegetation characteristics related to Cuckoo and five other sensitive riparian bird territory densities. We found Cuckoo densities were positively associated with increased vertical vegetative structure 1–5 m above ground with a threshold for mean tree height. Sensitive species densities were also related to vertical structure and started to decline with stand height greater than 6–8 m. Low and mid canopy vertical structure started declining after about age eight. Naturally regenerated sites had higher densities of most sensitive bird species than planted sites. We provide ideas for restoring mature forest with little low to mid canopy vertical structure.</b> Wohner, P.J., R.F. Thurow, and J.T. Peterson. 2024.

A comprehensive multi-state conditional occupancy model for evaluating interactions of non-native and native species. Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution 10, p.1288. | Abstract January 2023 A major challenge in ecology is disentangling interactions of non-native, potentially invasive species on native species. Conditional two-species occupancy models are used to examine the effects of dominant species (e.g., non-native) on subordinate species (e.g., native) while considering the possibility that occupancy of one species may affect occupancy and/ or detection of the other. Although conditional two-species models are useful for evaluating the influence of one species on presence of another, it is possible that species interactions are density dependent. Therefore, we developed a novel two-species occupancy model that incorporates multiple abundance states (i.e., absent, present, abundant) of the native species. We showcase the utility of this model that has the capacity to incorporate random effects and covariates on both occupancy and detection and that can help disentangle species interactions given varying occupancy and detection in different abundance states. As a case study, we use snorkel survey data from the Umpqua basin, Oregon, where it is hypothesized that smallmouth bass <i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>, a non-native piscivore, exclude Umpqua chub <i>Oregonichthys kalawatseti</i>, a small endemic minnow. Our conditional two-species multi-state (2SMS) model allowed us to conclude that in general, average occupancy was low for both fishes, and that when non-native bass were present, overall native chub occupancy in the present (0.18 ± 0.05 SD) and abundant (0.19 ± 0.03) states was higher than when non-natives were absent (0.14 ± 0.02/ 0.08 ± 0.02), indicating the non-native was not excluding the native species. By incorporating a species interaction factor into the model, we found a positive association (6.75 ± 5.54 SD) between native chub and non-native bass. The covariates strongly related to occupancy were elevation, algae, and land cover type (urban and shrub). Detection probability was relatively high for both species (0.21–0.82) and was most strongly related to the covariates day of year, water temperature, gravel substrate, and stream order/ magnitude. Incorporation of detection probability and covariates enabled interpretation of interactions between the two species that may have been missed without their inclusion in the modeling process. Our new 2SMS occupancy model can be used by scientists and managers with a broad range of survey and covariate data to disentangle species interactions problems to help them inform management decisions.

Good practices for species distribution modeling of deep-sea corals and sponges: data collection, analysis, validation, and communication. Submitted to Frontiers in Marine Science. | Abstract May 2020 Resource managers in the United States and worldwide are tasked with identifying and mitigating trade-offs between human activities in the deep sea (e.g., fishing, energy development, and mining) and their impacts on habitat-forming invertebrates, including deep-sea corals and sponges (DSCS). Related management decisions require information about where DSCS occur and in what densities. Species distribution modeling (SDM) provides a cost-effective means of identifying potential DSCS habitat over large areas to inform these management decisions and data collection. Here we provide recommendations of good practices for DSCS SDM, especially in the context of data collection and management applications. Managers typically need information regarding DSCS encounter probabilities, densities, and sizes, defined at sub-regional to basin-wide scales and validated using subsequent, targeted data collections. To realistically achieve these goals, we recommend integrating available data sources in SDMs including fine-scale visual sampling and broad-scale resource surveys (e.g., fisheries trawl surveys). When possible, we recommend models fitted to presence-absence and density data rather than models fitted only to presence data, which are difficult to validate and can confound estimated probability of occurrence or density with sampling effort. Ensembles of models can provide robust predictions, while multi-species models leverage information across taxa and facilitate community inference. We also recommend that analysts include environmental predictor variables representing multiple spatial scales, model residual spatial autocorrelation, and quantify prediction uncertainty. To facilitate the use of models by managers, predictions should be expressed in units that are widely understood and should be validated at an appropriate spatial scale using a sampling design that provides strong statistical inference. We present three case studies for the Pacific Ocean that illustrate good practices with respect to data collection, modeling, and validation; these case studies demonstrate it is possible to implement our recommendations in real-world settings.

Can spatial food web subsidies associated with river hydrology and lateral connectivity be detected using stable isotopes? Food Webs. 2023. | Abstract March 2023 Hydrology, lateral connectivity and stable isotope ratios of fishes and mussels in the Guadalupe River, Texas, were analyzed for evidence of spatial food web subsidies between the active channel and oxbow lakes in the floodplain. During and following lateral connections, aquatic organisms residing in the channel may assimilate material from sources imported from oxbows, and oxbow residents may consume and assimilate material imported from the channel. During surveys conducted between March 2016 and April 2017, fish, mussel, algae, and riparian plants samples were collected in and around two oxbows and adjacent channel sites for analysis of stable isotope ratios. Biplots of d<sup>13</sup>C and d<sup>15</sup>N were graphed for basal sources and specimens of Longnose Gar <i>Lepisosteus osseus, </i>Gizzard Shad <i>Dorosoma cepedianium, </i>Threadfin Shad <i>Dorosoma petenense, </i>Bullhead Minnow <i>Pimephales vigilax, </i>Smallmouth Buffalo <i>Ictiobus bubalus, </i>White Crappie <i>Pomoxis annularis</i>, sunfishes (<i>Lepomis</i> species combined), and two mussel species (combined) captured from oxbows and the channel. Within each graph, a source polygon was drawn to indicate the space occupied by animals that could have assimilated feasible combinations of source materials from the oxbows or river channel. Based on positions of animals within source polygons, riparian plants were the most important source of organic matter supporting biomass of fishes and mussels both within the channel and oxbows during every survey period, with algae contributing minor percentages. Most organisms had isotopic signatures consistent with assimilation of <i>in situ</i> sources, or else were inconclusive with regard to cross-habitat exchanges. Between-habitat food web subsidies were indicated for 7.6% of 314 organisms from oxbows and 11.2% of 231 from the channel, and these cases followed high flow pulses that connected oxbows for extended periods. Several issues that compromise inferences from stable isotope analysis were identified, and attempts to estimate spatial food web subsidies in fluvial systems could be enhanced by analyzing additional biomarkers, such as isotopic ratios of other elements and compound-specific stable isotopes, as well as additional sources, time-specific biotracers, and experimental approaches that directly track movement of sources and organisms in spatially structured food webs.

Geolocators, stable isotopes, and citizen science identify migratory timing, route, and spring molt of Smith’s Longspurs. Avian Conservation and Ecology 19(1):13. [online] URL: https://www.ace-eco.org/vol19/iss1/art13 | Abstract April 2024 Climate change is disproportionately impacting the Arctic. For Arctic breeding birds, basic knowledge of their annual cycle, specifically the timing, route, and movement behavior of migration, is needed to understand when and where populations may experience threats. We use a combination of geolocators and stable isotope analysis to identify route and timing of migration in Smith’s Longspurs (<i>Calcarius pictus</i>) that breed in Alaska’s Brooks Range. We trapped males on their breeding grounds in 2011-2014 and collected head feathers for stable isotopes of hydrogen (δ<sup>2</sup>H). We deployed 22 geolocators on a subset of individuals and retrieved four, which all overwintered in southern Texas. Individual start dates for fall migration based on geolocators were more variable than for the spring, and individuals were highly mobile while on their wintering grounds. Geolocators and stable isotope values were comparable across years and indicated that birds from the Brooks Range undergo their pre-nuptial molt in central Canada. We compared geolocator and stable isotope inferred locations to observations submitted to e-Bird and found that longspurs were distributed farther south during the winter months, but farther north during the spring than most eBird observations. Concurrent deployments of geolocator tags across Smith’s longspur’s breeding range would clarify whether migratory behaviors and routes are population specific or shared widely across breeding locations.

Brashares. \"Quantifying wildlife responses to conservation fencing in East Africa.\" Biological Conservation 256 (2021): 109071. | Abstract April 2021 The fencing of protected areas is increasing worldwide. However, the implementation of fences for conservation has outpaced scientific assessment of their effectiveness, non-target impacts, and long-term costs. We assessed landscape predictors of fence crossing sites and employed camera traps over a one-year period to investigate wildlife responses to a conservation fence around Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya. Specifically, we measured the impact of the fence on wild mammal movement, and the temporal impacts of fence maintenance on wildlife crossings and behavior. Cameras captured more than 65,000 detections of animals approaching fences, with 3626 observed crossings over 2818 trap nights at 19 sites. Using these data, we developed a guide to classifying fence-specific mammal behaviors. Thirty-eight wild mammal species approached known weak points in the fence, and 27 species were recorded crossing the fence. No single environmental variable predicted detection or fence crossing points for all species, but seasonality, human activity, habitat visibility, and proximity to an adjacent protected area were each correlated with species-specific crossing locations. Additionally, breaches of repaired fence-crossing locations occurred within days of maintenance. We conclude that popular, ‘one-size-fits-all’, conservation fence designs may be ineffective and costly for restraining movement of many wildlife species. We recommend that those deploying conservation fences start with clearly articulated management goals, that fence maintenance be informed by taxa-specific tendencies to breach fences, and that managers consider the strategic creation of wildlife corridors, overpasses, or ungulate-proof fences to link fenced protected areas with surrounding habitat. Wilkinson, B.P., and P.G.R. Jodice. Support for the fasting endurance hypothesis of partial migration in Brown Pelicans. 2023. Ecosphere 2023;14:e4365. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4365\n\n| Abstract | Download February 2023 Partial migration occurs when only a certain fraction of a population or species migrates instead of all individuals. Considered an evolutionary precursor, understanding why some individuals choose to undertake migration while others do not may serve to inform general migratory theory. While several hypotheses currently exist for explaining the maintenance of partial migration, empirical support for many is limited. To address this gap, we analyzed telemetry data acquired from individual brown pelicans (<i>Pelecanus occidentalis</i>; <i>n</i> = 74), a partially migratory seabird, nesting on six colonies in the South Atlantic Bight over the course of four autumn migrations using a Cox’s proportional hazards model. We estimated that approximately 74% of pelicans nesting within the study area may be migratory on an annual basis, with the remainder staying within the surrounding marine ecoregion year-round. Mean date of migration initiation was 9 November, although movements occurred from September – December. Modeling results indicated significant effects of rising sea-surface temperatures and decreased body condition on migration rate. We suggest that the ontogenetic migration of the primary forage species of brown pelicans from estuarine to pelagic environments causes a seasonal reduction in prey, and that individuals in poor body condition are unable to meet the energetic demands potentially associated with this decrease in prey availability (i.e., the fasting endurance hypothesis of partial migration). Although we did not find evidence for a density-dependent migratory response, the effects of intraspecific competition on migration in pelicans appears to warrant consideration.

Collaborative conservation in the United States: A review of motivations, goals, and outcomes. Biological Conservation, 259, 109165. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109165 | Abstract | Publisher Website July 2021 For centuries, communities around the globe have worked together to manage resources—a process often referred to as community-based conservation. More recently in the US, diverse stakeholders have partnered to address complex environmental issues that span land ownership or administrative boundaries, calling these efforts collaborative conservation. Reviews of community-based and collaborative conservation have historically focused on developing countries. To synthesize published information on U.S.-focused groups, we conducted a literature review with the following objectives: 1) characterize geographic distribution, types of participants, and sources of funding for these groups; 2) assess issues motivating group formation, goals, activities to achieve those goals, and outcomes; 3) identify whether these goals, activities, and outcomes were biophysical, social, and/or economic. To accomplish these objectives, we searched for relevant peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, and reports in online databases from 1800's-2017. Our review resulted in 245 documents describing 296 collaborative conservation groups across all 50 states (primarily the Western U.S.) and the District of Columbia. The top three issues motivating collaborative group formation included impacts of land and resource degradation on livelihoods, water quality and management, and managing land and resources across ownership boundaries. We found that there was little published information on the outcomes of group activities (16% of groups). For the limited number of groups for which the literature reported outcomes, there was no relationship between positive outcomes and group characteristics. Our findings suggest that renewed efforts to evaluate the impact of collaboration on conservation are warranted and could support learning and improved action. Wilder, Benjamin T; Amanda T. Becker, Adrian Munguia-Vega, Melanie Culver. 2021. Tracking the desert's edge with a Pleistocene relict. Journal of Arid Environments, DOI.org/10.1016/j.jaidenv.2021.104653 | Abstract October 2021 A series of 900–1200 m desert peaks surrounded by arid lowlands occur throughout the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico where temperate affiliated species occur at highest elevations. The presence of disjunct long-lived plant taxa on under-explored summits, especially Isla Tiburón at 29º latitude in the Gulf of California, suggests a more southerly extent of Ice Age woodlands than previously understood. The phylogeography of the desert edge species <i>Canotia holacantha</i> (Celastraceae) was investigated to test the hypothesis that insular desert peak populations represent remnants of Pleistocene woodlands rather than recent dispersal events. Sequences of four chloroplast DNA regions totaling 2,032 bp were amplified from 74 individuals of 14 populations across the entire range of <i>C. holacantha</i> as well as nine individuals that represented the other two species in its clade (<i>C. wendtii</i> and <i>Acanthothamnus aphyllus</i>) and two outgroups. Results suggest that a <i>Canotia</i> common ancestor occurred on the landscape, which underwent a population contraction ca. 15 kya. The Isla Tiburón <i>C. holacantha</i> population and the Chihuahuan Desert microendemic <i>C. wendtii</i>have the greatest genetic differentiation, are sister to one another, and basal to all other <i>Canotia</i> populations. Three haplotypes within <i>C. holacantha</i> were recovered, which correspond to regional geography and thus identified as the Arizona, Sonora, and Tiburón haplotypes, within which <i>Acanthothamnus aphyllus</i> is nested rather than as a related genus. These results indicate a once broad distribution of <i>Canotia </i>/<i> Acanthothamnus</i> during the Pleistocene, now present in relict populations on the fringes of the southern desert, in the Chihuahuan Desert, with scattered populations on desert peaks and a common or abundant distribution at the norther ecotone of the Sonoran Desert. These results suggest <i>Canotia</i> has tracked the shift of the desert’s edge both in latitude and elevation since the end of the last Ice Age.

Streamflow along the Willamette River is largely controlled by upstream dams, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as part of the Willamette Valley Project. In 2008, these dams were found to have a deleterious effect on ESA-listed salmonids (NOAA Fisheries, 2008), resulting in USACE taking mitigatory actions. Included in these actions was setting seasonal streamflow targets at various locations along the river to improve survival and migration of juvenile salmonids. Though these targets were established with the best available information at the time, recent data and models have advanced understanding of river dynamics and allow a more robust analysis of the affect of streamflow on downstream habitat. This study leverages these recent datasets to build high-resolution models of useable habitat for juvenile Chinook Salmon and steelhead trout to assess how this habitat varies with streamflow. Habitat models rely on hydraulic models developed in White and Wallick, 2021, and temperature models developed in Stratton Garvin and others, 2021b, both paired with literature supplied data on habitat preferences. Findings a non-uniform response to streamflow, where habitat in some reaches of the Willamette consistently increases with additional streamflow, while other reaches see habitat decrease when streamflows increase from low to moderate flows. These differences are explained by local geomorphology in each reach, particularly the transition of the river from a relatively dynamic, multi-threaded river to a simpler and more confined river downstream. The upstream reaches generally have more habitat available per unit stream distance than their counterparts, but all reaches display greatest amounts of habitat at the highest streamflows. Finally, results show that water temperature in summer greatly reduces the amount of habitat available to the focal species, particularly downstream of Corvallis. Together, these findings serve to inform flow management by providing a quantitatve assessment of the affects of streamflow on habitat. White, C.

Through this retrospective we highlight the remarkable historic fisheries resources and causative reasons for establishing public fisheries agencies and the American Fisheries Society (AFS). Through a review of primary historical documents and literature for North America, this paper identifies: factors contributing to the founding of AFS and public fish commissions; shows how selected resource issues evolved; and documents how and why selected fisheries and aquatic habitat policies changed in response to those issues. Overexploitation, landscape-scale habitat alterations, mining, and dams were the causative agents for emergence of fisheries agencies and the AFS, and these factors remain relevant today. Beginning in the 1960s, North Americans grew tired of degraded waters and fisheries and forced policy changes that have directly and indirectly affected the fisheries we manage today. The historical events and resulting corrective legislation are taken for granted by those unaware that AFS has actively participated in developing policies to address these environmental issues. Further, AFS continues to play a vital role in identifying key issues, providing conduits for information to cope with impairments, and advocating for policies to conserve intact habitats and improve degraded systems.

A comparison of eDNA and visual survey methods for detection of Longnose Darter Percina nasuta in Missouri. Fishes 2022, 7, 70. https://doi.org/10.3390/fishes7020070 | Abstract March 2022 The longnose darter Percina nasuta is a rare and cryptic fish that recently disappeared from much of its historic range. We developed and used an environmental DNA (eDNA) assay for longnose darter paired with visual surveys to better determine the species’ range and compare detection probability between sampling approaches in an occupancy modeling framework. We detected longnose darter eDNA further upstream in the mainstem St. Francis River than previously reported and in a tributary for the first time. Our multi-scale occupancy approach compared models where detection was constant against a model that allowed detection to vary by survey method. The constant model received the most support indicating survey method was not a strong predictor and detection was estimated at 0.70 (0.45–0.86; 95% CI) across both methods. Our study produced effective longnose darter eDNA primers and demonstrated the application of eDNA for sampling small-bodied, cryptic fish. We detected longnose darter eDNA 27 km upstream of their known range and determined that snorkel surveys are the most efficient sampling method if water clarity allows. We recommend target sample sizes to achieve various detection goals for both sample methods and our results inform future design of distributional and monitoring efforts. Westhoff, J. T., H. A.

Freshwater Crayfish 28:27-36. https://doi.org/10.5869/fc.2023.v28-1.27 | Abstract December 2023 The spread of invasive crayfish requires invaded habitats to be thermal suitable and differences in thermal tolerances among species could provide refugia for native crayfish affected by the invader. We estimated upper thermal tolerance for the invasive <i>Faxonius hylas</i> and native <i>F. peruncus</i> and <i>F. quadruncus</i> using critical thermal maxima (CTM) methodology to determine if there are ecologically exploitable differences in estimates among species and if there are areas within their distributional ranges that exceed their thermal maximums. We found no differences in CTM estimates among species or sexes but did observe significant differences in CTM estimates among acclimation temperatures. Additionally, crayfish size had a small, yet significant effect on CTM estimates whereby smaller individuals had lower CTM estimates than larger individuals. The similarity among CTM estimates suggests that for at least upper thermal tolerance, areas thermally available to the native species will also be thermal suitable for the invasive. We did not observe water temperatures in the field that exceeded CTM estimates for any species. However, areas within the mainstem St. Francis River did have warming tolerance estimates of less than 5 °C suggesting spread of the invasive through the mainstem could be limited by water temperature.

Environmental drivers of autumn migration departure decisions in midcontinental mallards. Movement Ecology | Abstract January 2022 <i><u>Background</u><br>The timing of autumn migration in ducks is influenced by a range of environmental conditions that may elicit individual experiences and responses from individual birds, yet most studies have investigated relationships at the population level. We used data from individual satellite-tracked mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) to model the timing and environmental drivers of autumn migration movements at the landscape scale.<br><u>Methods</u> <br>We combined two sets of location records (2004-2007, and 2010-2011) from satellite-tracked mallards migrating to winter in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, and identified records that indicated the start of long-range (≥ 30 km) southward movements during the migration period. We developed candidate models to predict the departure date, conditional on daily mean environmental covariates (temperature, snow and ice cover, wind conditions, precipitation, cloud cover, and pressure), at a 32×32 km resolution. We modeled selection of departure date by individual mallards using a discrete choice model accounting for heterogeneity in individual preferences. We ranked model performance with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).<br><u>Results</u> <br>Departure was best predicted (60% precision) by a “winter conditions” model containing temperature and snow cover depth and duration. Models conditional on wind speed, precipitation, pressure variation, and cloud cover received lower support. Number of days of snow cover, recently experienced (snow days), and current snow cover had the strongest positive effect on departure likelihood, followed by experienced days of freezing temperature (frost days) and current low temperature. Distributions of dominant drivers and of correct vs incorrect prediction along the movement tracks indicate that these responses applied throughout the latitudinal range of migration. Among recorded departures, most were driven by snow days (65%) followed by current temperature (30%). <br><u>Conclusions</u> <br>Our results indicate that the dominant environmental driver of departure decision in autumn-migrating mallards was the onset of snow conditions, and secondarily the onset of temperatures close to, or below, the freezing point. Mallards are likely to relocate southwards quickly when faced with foraging that is impeded by snow, and could use declining temperatures as a more graduated early cue for departure. Our findings provide further insights into the functional response of mallards to weather and climate factors during the migration period that ultimately determine distribution.</i> Weller, F.G., E.B.

An agent-based model to quantify energetics, movements and habitat selection of mid-continent mallards in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Ecological Modeling | Abstract September 2023 The dynamics of wintering waterfowl populations at the landscape scale are the result of complex interactions of environmental, behavioral and energetic drivers. Agent-based models provide a method to directly link these factors in a spatially explicit framework and allow the emergence of subtle or non-linear patterns from the aggregation of individual agent actions. We adapted the Spatially-explicit Waterbird Agent-based Model Program (SWAMP), originally developed for waterbirds in central California, to simulate a basin-scale population of mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) wintering in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley over a four-month period (November–February). Simulated agents move within the landscape, foraging on areas made available conditional on a probabilistic inundation status, and depleting food resources. The model uses a high-resolution map of eastern Arkansas waterfowl habitats and incorporates a hierarchical habitat selection system that enables mallards to relocate at increasing scales in response to changing food availability. We validated the performance of modeled mallard body condition and behavioral metrics under different environmental conditions against expected outcomes, and found that the simulation produced realistic representations of changes in flight distances, energy expenditure, lipid storage, and foraging habitat use in response to depleting food resources over time. We discuss the model's applicability as a tool to quantify waterfowl response to a range of environmental conditions and evaluate scenarios of landscape composition and configuration in the context of waterfowl population management.

Use of a dynamic occupancy model to evaluate secretive marsh bird habitat associations at spring migration stopover sites. Journal of Wildlife Management | Abstract March 2022 Despite several secretive marsh bird (SMB) species being listed as “Critically Imperiled” throughout the mid-continent of North America, there is limited information on SMB distribution and habitat use within primary migratory corridors, resulting in uncertainty on contributions of wetlands in mid-latitude states toward SMB annual cycle needs. Our objectives were to quantify patterns of SMB wetland occupancy during spring migration at a mid-latitude state and evaluate the relationships between SMB colonization probability and water-level management practices, as well as the resulting habitat conditions during spring migration. We conducted a two year dynamic occupancy study (2013-2014) that included six rounds of repeated call-back surveys to detect the presence of five SMB species (Virginia rail (<i>Rallus limicola</i>), sora (<i>Porzana carolina</i>), King rail (<i>R. elegans</i>), least bittern (<i>Ixobrychus exilis</i>) and American bittern (<i>Botaurus lentiginosus</i>)) during spring and summer (April-July) on 107 wetlands across 8 Conservation Areas and 4 National Wildlife Refuges throughout Missouri. Sora were detected most frequently, followed by Least Bittern, American Bittern, Virginia Rail, and King Rail. Colonization probability for all species was positively associated with emergent vegetation cover and negatively associated with amount of open water. Open water was the most important factor for American Bittern site colonization, to which they were negatively associated. Virginia Rail colonization had a strong positive association with vegetation height, whereas Least Bittern and Sora site colonization were influenced positively by water depth and agriculture, respectively. Based on the habitat associations within and among SMB species identified in this study, wetland managers can tailor management strategies to optimize spring migration habitat for single- or multi-species objectives.

Recovery of critically endangered Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) in the Cayman Islands following targeted conservation actions. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 117(3): 1587-1595.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1917132117 | Abstract | Publisher Website January 2020 Many large-bodied marine fishes that form spawning aggregations, such as the Nassau grouper (<i>Epinephelus striatus</i>), have suffered regional overfishing due to exploitation during spawning. In response, marine resource managers in many locations have established marine protected areas or seasonal closures to recover these overfished stocks. The challenge in assessing management effectiveness lies largely in the development of accurate estimates to track stock size through time. For the past 15 y, the Cayman Islands government has taken a series of management actions aimed at recovering collapsed stocks of Nassau grouper. Importantly, the government also partnered with academic and nonprofit organizations to establish a research and monitoring program (Grouper Moon) aimed at documenting the impacts of conservation action. Here, we develop an integrated population model of 2 Cayman Nassau grouper stocks based on both diver-collected mark–resight observations and video censuses. Using both data types across multiple years, we fit parameters for a state–space model for population growth. We show that over the last 15 y the Nassau grouper population on Little Cayman has more than tripled in response to conservation efforts. Census data from Cayman Brac, while more sparse, show a similar pattern. These findings demonstrate that spatial and seasonal closures aimed at rebuilding aggregation-based fisheries can foster conservation success. Waterhouse, L., White, J., See, K., Murdoch, A., and B.

Ecological Applications 30(8):e02202.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2202 | Abstract | Publisher Website June 2020 Anthropogenic impacts on riverine systems have, in part, led to management concerns regarding the population status of species using these systems. In an effort to assess the efficacy of restoration actions, and in order to improve monitoring of species of concern, managers have turned to PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag studies with in-stream detectors to monitor movements of tagged individuals throughout river networks. However, quantifying movements in a river network using PIT tag data with incomplete coverage and imperfect detections presents a challenge. We propose a flexible Bayesian analytic framework that models the imperfectly detected movements of tagged individuals in a nested PIT tag array river network. This model structure provides probabilistic estimates of up-stream migration routes for each tagged individual based on a set of underlying nested state variables. These movement estimates can be converted into abundance estimates when an estimate of abundance is available for a location within the river network. We apply the model framework to data from steelhead (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) in the Upper Columbia River basin and evaluate model performance (precision/variance of simulated population sizes) as a function of population tagging rates and PIT tag array detection probability densities within the river system using a simulation framework. This simulation framework provides both model validation (precision) and the ability to evaluate expected performance improvements (variance) due to changes in tagging rates or PIT receiver array configuration. We also investigate the impact of different network configurations on model estimates. Results from such investigations can help inform decisions regarding future monitoring and management.

Updated Integrated Growth Model for Bigeye Tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Atlantic Ocean. Fisheries Research. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.106317 | Abstract | Download December 2022 The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) concluded the Atlantic Ocean tropical Tuna Tagging Programme (AOTTP) in 2021. This project had the objectives of enhancing food security, stimulating economic growth, and improving management through research on tropical tuna resources in the Atlantic Ocean, including bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). Here, we combine tagging data and otolith data from the AOTTP program, Panama City Lab and the Pelagic Fisheries Lab at the University of Maine with historical tagging data and otolith data from ICCAT and other sources to fit integrated growth models with the goal of providing the most complete growth curve (in terms of data inclusion and validation of age-at-length) for bigeye tuna in the Atlantic Ocean. Both Richards and von Bertalanffy growth models were fitted. A variety of models were fitted to subsets of the data to investigate the consistency of growth information. In all cases for the integrated model, the Richards and von Bertalanffy models were very similar with the von Bertalannfy model being preferred for parsimony. The preferred model, based on fit to old fish, was the von Bertalanffy curve based on length-age pair data from multiple sources. The addition of tagging data to create an integrated model showed patterns of lack of fit to both the tagging and otolith data suggesting conflict between the tagging and otolith data. The preferred model (length-age pair data only) gave the estimates: asymptotic length L∞ (fork length) equals 161.21 cm (95% bootstrap CI 154.39, 166.84), growth parameter K equals 0.392 yr− 1 (95% bootstrap CI 0.355, 0.441), and the time-axis intercept t0 equals − 0.239 yr (95% bootstrap CI –0.306, − 0.175). For the best fitting integrated model, the asymptotic length L∞(fork length, in cm) was estimated to be 185.78 (SD 6.298), the growth parameter K was 0.252 yr− 1 (SD 0.014), and the time-axis intercept t0 was − 0.524 yr (SE 0.025). The value for asymptotic length L∞ from the integrated model was larger than the lengths of all the old fish in the sample whereas the value for the curve based on otoliths passes through the cloud of points for old fish. Warlick, AJ, Johnson, D., Gelatt, T., Converse, SJ. 2022. Environmental drivers of demography and potential factors limiting the recovery of an endangered marine top predator. Ecosphere 13:e4325. | Abstract January 2023 Understanding what drives changes in wildlife demography over time is fundamental to the conservation and management of depleted or declining populations, though making inference about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence survival and reproduction is challenging as they can change over time and space. Here we use almost 20 years of mark-resight data from 2000-2018 to examine the effects of environmental variability on age-specific survival and natality for the endangered western distinct population segment of Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) in Alaska, USA. Though this population has been studied extensively over the last four decades, the causes of divergent abundance trends that have been observed across the range of this population remain unknown. We developed a Bayesian multi-event mark-resight model that accounts for female reproductive state uncertainty. Results indicated that survival rates for male pups (0.44; 0.36-0.53), female yearlings (0.63; 0.49-0.73), and male yearlings (0.62; 0.51-0.71) born in the western portion of the range, estimated here for the first time, were lower than those estimated for male pups (0.69; 0.65-0.74), female yearlings (0.76; 0.71-0.81), and male yearlings (0.71; 0.65-0.78) born in the eastern portion of the range. Additionally, pup mass had a positive effect on pup survival in the eastern portion of the range and a negative effect in the western portion of the range. Local and basin-scale oceanographic features such as the Aleutian Low, the Arctic Oscillation Index, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, chlorophyll concentration, upwelling, and wind in certain seasons exhibited correlations with vital rates. However, strong inference is challenging given that relationships between ocean conditions and an adaptive top predator in a highly dynamic ecosystem are exceedingly complex. This study provides the first demographic rate estimates for the western portion of the population range where abundance estimates continue to decline. This work can inform ongoing research and management and will advance efforts to identify factors driving regionally divergent abundance trends with implications for population-level responses to future climate variability.

Demographic and environmental drivers of population dynamics and viability in an endangered top predator using an integrated model. Animal Conservation. | Abstract October 2023 Knowledge about the demographic and environmental factors underlying population dynamics is fundamental to designing effective conservation measures to recover depleted wildlife populations. However, sparse monitoring data or persistent knowledge gaps about threats make it difficult to identify the drivers of population dynamics. In situations where small, depleted populations show continued evidence of decline for unknown reasons, integrated population models can improve our understanding of demography, provide fundamental insights into factors that may be limiting recovery, and support conservation decisions. We used mark-resight and aerial survey data from 2004-2018 to build an integrated population model for the Cook Inlet population of beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>), which is listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We examined the relationships between beluga vital rates and prey availability and environmental conditions and conducted a population viability analysis to predict extinction risk across a range of hypothetical changes in beluga survival and reproduction. Our results indicated that while survival of breeding females (0.97; 95% CrI 0.95-0.99) and young calves (0.92; 0.80-0.98) was relatively high, survival of non-breeders (0.94; 0.91-0.97) and fecundity (0.27; 0.21-0.35) may be depressed. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that if vital rates and environmental variability remain similar to estimates from the latter part of the study period, the population will likely continue to decline, with a 19-32% probability of extinction in 150 years. Our model framework highlights the utility of integrated population modeling for identifying factors contributing to the failure of protected populations to recover.

Ecological Processes 12:48. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-023-00460-x | Abstract | Publisher Website October 2023 <i>Background</i>: Large-river decision-makers are charged with maintaining diverse ecosystem services through unprecedented social-ecological transformations as climate change and other global stressors intensify. The interconnected, dendritic habitats of rivers, which often demarcate jurisdictional boundaries, generate unique management challenges. Here, we explored how the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework may enhance large-river management by promoting coordinated and deliberate responses to social-ecological trajectories of change. The RAD framework identifies the full decision space, wherein managers may <i>resist </i>change to maintain historical conditions, <i>accept </i>change toward different conditions, or <i>direct </i>change to a specified future with novel conditions. In the Upper Mississippi River System, managers are facing ecosystem transformations from more frequent and extreme high-water events. We illustrate how RAD-informed basin-, reach-, and site-scale decisions could: 1) provide river continuum and cross-spatial scale framing; <i>and</i> 2) open the entire decision space of possible approaches; <i>to</i> 3) enhance coordinated inter-jurisdictional management in response to the trajectory of the Upper Mississippi River hydrograph.<br><i>Results</i>: The RAD framework helps identify plausible long-term trajectories in different reaches (or subbasins) of the river and how the associated social-ecological transformations could be managed by altering site-scale conditions. Strategic reach-scale objectives may reprioritize how, where, and when site conditions (e.g., habitat connectivity, diversity, redundancy) could be altered to contribute to the basin goal, given the basin’s plausible trajectories of change, and vice versa.<br><i>Conclusions</i><b>: </b> When faced with long-term systemic transformations (e.g., > 50 years), RAD helps explicitly consider whether or when the basin vision or goals may no longer be achievable, and <i>direct </i>options may open yet unconsidered potential for the basin. Embedding RAD in hierarchical decision making clarifies that the selection of actions in space and time should be derived from basin-wide goals and reach-scale objectives to ensure that site-scale actions contribute effectively to the larger river habitat mosaic. Embedding RAD thinking in large-river decisions can provide the necessary conduit to link flexibility and innovation at the site scale with stability at larger scales for adaptive governance of changing social-ecological systems.

PeerJ | Abstract December 2022 Using multi-species time series data has long been of interest for estimating inter-specific interactions with vector autoregressive models (VAR) and state space VAR models (VARSS); these methods are also described in the ecological literature as multivariate autoregressive models (MAR, MARSS). To date, most studies have used these approaches on relatively small food webs where the total number of interactions to be estimated is relatively small. However, as the number of species or functional groups increases, the length of the time series must also increase to provide enough degrees of freedom with which to estimate the pairwise interactions. To address this issue, we use Bayesian methods to explore the potential benefits of using regularized priors , such as Laplace and regularized horseshoe, on estimating interspecific interactions with VAR and VARSS models. We first perform a large-scale simulation study, examining the performance of alternative priors across various levels of observation error. Results from these simulations show that for sparse matrices, the regularized horseshoe prior minimizes the bias and variance across all inter-specific interactions. We then apply the Bayesian VAR model with regularized priors to a output from a large marine food web model (37 species) from the west coast of the USA. Results from this analysis indicate that regularization improves predictive performance of the VAR model, while still identifying important inter-specific interactions. Waraniak, J. M.S. Eackles, J.

Ecology and Evolution 14, e11347. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11347. | Abstract May 2024 Chronic wasting disease (CWD) can be spread by direct and indirect transmission with direct transmission easier to predict and assess using landscape genetics. Identifying subpopulations of a wild large herbivore allows identification of focal areas to target for effective intervention. Our aim was to assess population structure of white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>) in the northeastern United States at a regional scale to inform managers of gene flow throughout the region. We used ten microsatellites to genotype 5,701 samples collected from wild deer in Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia from 2014 to 2022. We conducted a spatial principal component analysis to assess distribution of genetic variability and assessed population genetic structure using two methods: non-spatial Bayesian clustering algorithm (BCA) and spatial BCA. We used results of these clustering methods to create simulated populations of 500 individuals representing each cluster and also created simulated populations representing a captive deer population, among other anthropogenically-derived spatial units to conduct genetic assignment tests. We conducted genetic assignment tests using these simulated reference populations as potential sources, calculating the probability of samples being assigned to their corresponding genetic cluster, state, or physiographic province. Non-spatial BCA identified widespread gene flow with only 2 clusters across the region, while spatial BCA suggested further partitioning into a maximum of nine clusters. Our assignment tests were able to correctly assign deer to captive or wild origin in most cases (94%), as reported in a previous study, but performance varied when trying to assign wild deer to spatial units. Assignments to genetic clusters performed well where the potential sources represented clusters inferred with non-spatial BCA, but efficiency was greatly reduced when assigning samples to clusters inferred via spatial BCA. This indicates that differences between spatial BCA clusters are not strong enough to make assignment tests a reliable method for unequivocally inferring geographic origin of deer using 10 microsatellites. However, genetic distinction between clusters is still important to consider when managing for disease. Future research on what landscape barriers may be leading to these divisions and species-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms will further our understanding of potential subpopulations in the region.

Predicting the odds of chronic wasting disease with Habitat Risk software. Spatial and Spatio-temporal Epidemiology 49:100650. | Abstract April 2024 Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy that was first detected in captive cervids in Colorado, United States (US) in 1967, but has since spread into free-ranging white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>) populations across the US and Canada. In some areas, the disease is considered endemic in wild deer populations, and governmental wildlife agencies have employed epidemiological models to understand long-term environmental risk. However, continued rapid spread of CWD into new regions of the continent has underscored the need for extension of these models into broader tools applicable for wide use by wildlife agencies. Additionally, efforts to semi-automate models will facilitate access of technical scientific methods to broader audiences. We introduce software (<i>Habitat Risk</i>) designed to link a previously published epidemiological model with spatially referenced environmental and disease testing data enabling agency personnel to make up-to-date, localized, data-driven predictions regarding the odds of CWD infection in surrounding areas after an outbreak is discovered. <i>Habitat Risk</i> requires pre-processing publicly available environmental datasets and standardization of disease testing (surveillance) data, after which an autonomous computational pipeline terminates in a user interface that displays an interactive map of disease risk. We demonstrated the use of the <i>Habitat Risk </i>software with surveillance data of white-tailed deer from Tennessee, US. Software to pre-process environmental data is openly available at <i>doi.org/10.7298/2tt1-yy48</i>, while <i>Habitat Risk</i> software is available at <i>doi.org/10.7298/rcz8-nw50</i>.

Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences Volume 78. doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0353. USGS FSP IP-121942. | Abstract May 2021 Increasing water demand, water development, and on-going climate change have driven extensive changes to the hydrology, geomorphology and biology of arid-land rivers globally, driving an increasing need to understand how annual hydrologic conditions affect the distribution and abundance of imperiled desert fish populations. We analyzed the relationship between annual hydrologic conditions and the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow in the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico, USA, using hurdle models to predict both presence and density as a function of integrated annual hydrologic metrics. Both presence and density were positively related to spring high flow magnitude and duration and negatively related to summer drying, as indicated by an integrated flow metric. Simulations suggest hydrologic conditions near the wettest observed in the data set would be required to meet recovery goals in a single year in all reaches. We demonstrate how the models developed herein can be used to examine alternative water management strategies, including strategies that may currently be socially and logistically infeasible to implement, to identify strategies minimizing trade-offs between conservation and other management goals.

Comparative assessment of laboratory-derived thermal maxima of Gila Trout (Oncorhynchus gilae) with current stream temperatures. The Southwestern Naturalist 66(4):317-326.\n\n| Abstract February 2022 Gila Trout (<i>Oncorhynchus gilae</i>) represents an iconic species of the American Southwest. The salmonid has survived extensive logging, livestock grazing, and mining, and is currently threatened by climate change, wildfire, and extended drought. Long term conservation and recovery of the species and its unique lineages rely on stocking and translocation into historically inhabited streams. Thus, the fish’s thermal tolerance is essential in determining suitable habitat and potential vulnerability to a warming climate. We compared laboratory-derived temperature metric, critical thermal maximum (CTMax), in hatchery-reared Gila Trout from three lineages (Main Diamond, South Diamond, and Whiskey Creek) to determine if CTMax differed among the lineages.
