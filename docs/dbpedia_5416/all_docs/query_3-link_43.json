        "meta_description": "California’s bountiful San Joaquin Valley (SJV), a critical region for global fruit and nut production, has withstood two severe, multi-year droughts in the past decade, exacerbated by record-breaking high temperature and evaporative demand. We employed climate data and crop coefficients to estimate the crop water demand in the SJV over the past forty years. Our approach, using crop coefficients for Penman-Montieth modeled evapotranspiration, focused on the climate effects on crop water demand, avoiding the confounding factors of changing land use and management practices that are present in actual evapotranspiration. We demonstrate that increases in crop water demand explain half of the cumulative deficits of the agricultural water balance since 1980, exacerbating water reliance on depleting groundwater supplies and fluctuating surface water imports. We call this phenomenon of climate-induced increased crop water demand an invisible water surcharge. We found that in the past decade, this invisible water surcharge on agriculture has increased the crop water demand in the SJV by 4.4% with respect to the 1980–2011 timeframe—more than 800 GL per year, a volume as large as a major reservoir in the SJV. Despite potential agronomic adaptation and crop response to climate warming, increased crop water demand adds a stressor to the sustainability of the global fruit and nut supply and calls for changes in management and policies to consider the shifting hydroclimate.",

        "text": "2.2 Estimation of crop evapotranspiration\n\nWe followed the crop coefficient approach described by the FAO-56 irrigation and drainage paper [49] for calculating the potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc) which we will summarize in this section. First, it is important to clarify that we define ETc as the evapotranspiration that would occur under standard optimal growing conditions and full production [49]. ETc differs from actual evapotranspiration (ETa) which is modulated by crop management (e.g., irrigation practices). We acknowledge that ETc differs from ETa, and we are not suggesting that they are equal, but rather that ETc represents potential ET under well-watered conditions. By focusing on ETc, we isolate the climate change effects on the agricultural water budget without concern about variations in crop management over the study period from 1980 to 2023. We chose not to look at ETa for two reasons: (1) lack of long-term ETa data from the last four decades in the SJV, and (2) irrigation management practices have changed in the last four decades, making it difficult to differentiate the climate change effects from changes in management practices effects on ETa. While SJV agricultural landscapes have changed substantially in cropping mix in recent decades (e.g., perennial crop acreage expansion over annual crops [50]), we focus on climate contributors using a static 2018 agricultural land use for our ETc baseline calculations.\n\nHere, we go into detail about the approach for calculating ETc. The first step to using this method is to calculate the grass-based reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) standardized Penman-Monteith (PM) equation [51] (shown by Eq 1). (1) where ETo is the reference evapotranspiration [mm day-1], Rn is the net radiation at the crop surface [MJ m-2 day-1], G is the soil heat flux density [MJ m-2 day-1], T is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height [°C], u2 is the wind speed at 2 m [m s-1], es is the saturation vapor pressure [kPa], ea is the actual vapor pressure [kPa], es − ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit [kPa], Δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve [kPa °C-1], and γ is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1]. This version of the Penman-Monteith equation defines the reference crop as a hypothetical crop with a height of 0.12 m, a surface resistance of 70 s m-1, and an albedo of 0.23, which resembles a well-watered smooth green grass of uniform height [49].\n\nThe data for calculating ETo using Eq 1 was from gridMET. The gridMET gridded dataset includes daily surface meteorological data at ~4 km resolution (1/24th degree) across the contiguous United States, starting from 1979 [52]. The primary climate variables include maximum daily air temperature, minimum daily air temperature, precipitation accumulation, downward surface shortwave radiation, wind velocity, specific humidity, maximum daily relative humidity, and minimum daily relative humidity. These climate variables are used to derive the grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using [49] Eq 1, also included in the gridMET dataset. While gridMET is one of several datasets for estimating gridded ETo, others have shown largely similar variability and trends in the SJV region [19].\n\nThe next step of the crop coefficient method for determining ETc is to employ a five-point crop coefficient model (Kc), which simulates the four major crop development stages, initial (constant Kc), rapid growth (increasing Kc), mid-season (constant Kc), and late season (decreasing Kc), for 17 major crop categories in the San Joaquin Valley, namely grain, rice, cotton, corn, dry beans, safflower, alfalfa, processing tomatoes, cucurbits, onions and garlic, potatoes, truck crops, other field crops, almonds, and pistachios, other deciduous trees, citrus and subtropical, and vineyard. The Kc values and typical dates of development stages were obtained from the California Department of Water Resources [53]. Static typical dates of development stages were used instead of dates based on year-to-year variability. We note that changing crop phenology associated with climate variability and change may complicate this assumption. Warming may in some cases hasten crop maturation [54] and reduce the number of days irrigation is needed [55]. Likewise, warmer and longer growing periods may enable management strategies such as double cropping that may increase irrigation needs [56], or increasing cropped acreage and subsequent water demand [57]. Herein, we constrain our focus to static crop phenology to avoid confounding phenological and management influences on changing crop water demand. The daily Kc values for each crop development stage of each crop category are reported by California Detailed Analysis Units (DAU), which are sub-boundaries within the SJV. The Kc values for rice, alfalfa, processing tomatoes, corn, onions, almonds and pistachios, vineyard, and citrus and subtropical were developed by measuring ET using eddy covariance or surface renewal methods at sites in California (personal communication with DWR staff). The Kc values for all other crops were obtained from FAO-56 [49].\n\nWe employed main season summer crop land use data from the 2018 Land IQ land use survey [58], which claims a 95% accuracy by combining remote sensing, statistical, and temporal analysis techniques. Land use from 2018 was used instead of dynamic land use as other spatial data (e.g., Cropland Data Layer [59]) are unreliable for California because of high proportions of specialty crops [60], and the 2018 snapshot is a conservative estimate [9]. By keeping land use constant, we controlled for the effects of the land use changes on ETc and focused on the climate change effects on ETc.\n\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) under well-watered, optimal management conditions were simulated using the FAO-56 single crop coefficient equation, by multiplying total ETo (in mm) from gridMET and the single crop coefficient Kc [49]. To obtain a single Kc coefficient, we first calculated a monthly Kc, by averaging the daily Kc values by month for each crop category, to account for crop phenology. We then calculated a weighted mean Kc based on weights of the area of each crop category i (wi) in each DAU, using Eq (2): (2)\n\nFor every DAU and each month, a wi weighted mean Kcw was calculated and the Kc,i for each crop category i over the total of crops n: (3)\n\nGridded monthly totals of ETo from gridMET were clipped and averaged by the study area boundary. Monthly total ETc was calculated using average SJV monthly Kcw, average SJV monthly total ETo, and the single crop coefficient approach using Eq (4) [49]: (4)"
