        "text": "The gang called itself the TPP Bloods, the TTP standing for Tree Top Pirus- a reference to a group of streets in Compton, Calif., named after trees. But the organization, federal prosecutors said, originated in Maryland, not California, and in less than 10 years it became one of the most violent in the state.\n\nA sweeping indictment against 28 alleged TTP Bloods members- 23 men and five women- was unsealed Monday in federal court in Baltimore. Prosecutors charged 26 of them with racketeering conspiracy under a law designed to go after organized crime.\n\nThey're accused of committing five murders in the past 2 1/2 years, along with crimes including robberies, kidnappings, drug trafficking and threatening and intimidating witnesses.\n\n\"This is an organization that is alleged to have had a hierarchy, a structure, leadership, goals and rules that govern the conduct of the gang members,\" U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein said, adding that the racketeering charges allow prosecutors to hold gang members responsible for all the gang's activities.\n\nSteve L. Willock, 28, is accused of leading the gang, which originally formed in 1999 in the Washington County Detention Center in Hagerstown. According to court documents, Willock was sentenced to eight years in 1999 for dealing drugs and, after his release in 2003, was caught dealing again and sentenced to 18 years.\n\nFor most of the gang's existence, Willock directed its activities from prison, communicating with members largely through the mail, the indictment shows. He also wrote a letter to a TTP leader in Compton that said, in part, \"We have about 3-4 territories in Baltimore, Md (BodyMore) and we have blocks in different counties in Md, also territories in the Eastern Shore.\" Another alleged member, Ronnie Thomas, 33, is featured prominently in the infamous \"Stop Snitching\" DVD under his street name, Skinny Suge. The crude video became emblematic of Baltimore's culture of witness intimidation. According to the indictment, Thomas called another gang member, Kevin Gary, 26, of Baltimore, on Feb. 14 and discussed retaliating against a store owner who refused to sell the sequel, \"Stop Snitching 2.\"\n\nEight alleged TTP Bloods members _ Gary; Thomas; Sean Frazier, 24, of Baltimore; Orlando Gilyard, 21, of Baltimore County; Diane Kline, 30, of Hagerstown; Sherry Brockington, 23, of Baltimore; Emmanuel Fitzgerald, 33, of Baltimore; and Keon Williams, 26, of Baltimore- were arrested Monday morning during raids by more than 100 law enforcement officers. Representatives of the federal public defender's office said the office was not yet representing any of those eight defendants.\n\nFourteen defendants named in the indictment were already in custody for other crimes, while six remain at large. The gang's female members called themselves the \"Tree Top Pirettes,\" and Rosenstein said women played an unusually prominent role in the conspiracy. Baltimore State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy, however, said her office was seeing an increase in the number of women involved in drug dealing and gun crime. \"It's a lifestyle, and there are a lot of things going on with women when it comes to criminal enterprise,\" Jessamy said. \"The stronger gangs get ... you're going to be seeing gang activity across the board by females.\"\n\nOne of the alleged female members, Michelle L. Hebron, 23, is awaiting trial on murder charges for the fatal shooting of David L. Moore in Hagerstown last October. She's also accused in the indictment of shooting a TTP member whom she believed was cooperating with police. Eric A. Reed, Hebron's public defender in the murder case, said he was preparing for trial on the state charges and had not seen the federal indictment. Another defendant, Shonn Eubanks, 35, was scheduled to go to trial Tuesday in Baltimore Circuit Court on drug dealing charges. His attorney, Jerry Tarud, said he expected prosecutors would not pursue the case so that federal authorities could try his client. He said he did not know whether he would continue to represent Eubanks. Each of the 21 defendants charged with drug trafficking conspiracy faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, and each of the 26 charged with racketeering conspiracy faces a maximum of 20 years.\n\nRead more...\n\nOperation Augusta Ink turned out to be the second-largest storefront weapon seizure in the history of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. At last count, 105 men, women and juveniles have been arrested on drug, theft and firearm charges stemming from Colur Tyme Tattooz & Things, the Tobacco Road parlor that served as a black market bazaar for local gangs. In the spring of 2006, investigators approached a tattoo artist nicknamed Lil' John, whose real name is being withheld by authorities to protect his identity, about providing information about gang members. Police knew Lil' John was running an illegal tattoo parlor out of his home and had made a name for himself by tattooing members of south Augusta gangs such as O-DUB and Georgia Deadly Boys. Officers saw Lil' John as a way into the world of Augusta's gangs and offered him money and protection in return for his help. Police had been watching the gang problem grow in Augusta for years and reached a point where they felt the need to be more proactive, according to Lt. Scott Peebles. Within a month, members of the department, including Lt. Peebles, Maj. Ken Autry and Capt. Jack Francisco, started looking for a rental property and those willing to go undercover to staff it. From the beginning, only a handful of people knew Colur Tyme peddled more than just tattoos and Phillie blunt cigars.\n\n\"They were told you don't talk about this with anyone because not only will you be fired, but we can, we will, prosecute you,\" Lt. Peebles said. \"That's how serious we took it, and I think that's how serious they took it.\"\n\nSoon, they set about creating two operations: one a legitimate tattoo parlor with the motto \"We buy things others won't,\" the other a system of networks within local gangs that enabled them to buy those \"things,\" namely stolen guns and drugs.\n\nAugusta Ink began with Lil' John giving tattoos and forwarding his criminal contacts to Chris, a large, bearded officer who would not give his last name. Chris' task was legitimizing the business. He paid the bills and handled the day-to-day operation of the shop while negotiating drug and weapon sales. It was Investigator Brown, who went by the nickname \"Yardie,\" short for Yardbird, who acted as the tough guy. With eight years of service in the U.S. Army Special Operations and an early life on the streets of Queens, coupled with a sawed-off shotgun, Investigator Brown instilled a sense of fear and respect into everyone who entered the shop.\n\n\"(They thought) that I was crazy -- that some of the ATF guys were crazy,\" he said. \"You know, he (Chris) was always quiet, so they thought he was crazy. They just wouldn't come in and start no trouble.\"\n\nThat fear made Colur Tyme neutral ground to gangs -- a sanctuary. Rival gang members would shoot each other in the streets, but in the tattoo parlor all they fired off were dirty looks, according to Dan Carrier, who worked with Sgt. Blaise Dresser behind the scenes to identify every suspect that made a sale.\n\n\"They seemed to realize that if they did do something up there, the money would run out,\" Investigator Carrier said. \"Don't bite the hand that feeds you.\"\n\nSuspects were told the weapons they sold were headed to New York. Investigator Brown maintained that he made regular trips to New York City to unload Augusta's stolen guns. In reality, the weapons made a much shorter trip to the ATF crime lab in Savannah.With thousands of dollars in cash and weapons entering the store, being robbed was a very real fear. It could not only mean injury or death for the undercover officers, but also the end of the operation. If it happened, investigators were told to cooperate, hand over their money and report the crime like any other business owner. A gunman robbed Taylor's Banquet, a salon and banquet hall that shared a parking lot with Colur Tyme, in November 2006. Just minutes after the holdup, the gunman and his three accomplices came into Colur Tyme. Their faces were captured on several of the cameras wired throughout the building, but to use the images to arrest the suspects would have meant the end of Augusta Ink.\n\n\"The deputy and the business owner came next door, and I told them what I'd seen,\" Chris said. \"I told them what kind of vehicle (the suspects) had, because it was parked right in front of the shop. They had no idea. They treated me like I was a business.\"Three teenagers involved in the robbery were arrested that night without the Augusta Ink tapes. The fourth, a 16-year-old Cross Creek High School student, was picked up by police two months later. The team learned from the experience. They brought in extra help, both from their department and the ATF. Months later, they would rely on that help when dealing with three of their top targets: Jacob Plowright, Nathaniel Jones and Raphael Milligan.\n\nIt was late New Year's Day 2007 when Paul Patel was working in the freezer of his store, Richmond Hill Market. His wife, Binal, was at the counter when two men, later identified as Mr. Plowright and Mr. Jones, pointed handguns at her and demanded cash. Hearing the commotion, Mr. Patel rushed from the back of the store to aid his wife. Startled, the suspects fired their guns, striking Mr. Patel in the left leg and the abdomen. Severely injured, Mr. Patel was rushed to Medical College of Georgia Hospital for treatment and survived. Investigators said that before the shooting, they had no knowledge of the group. But they say that changed a day later when Mr. Plowright sold a 9 mm handgun to an undercover officer. ATF ballistics tests connected the gun to the shooting of Mr. Patel, and the undercover investigators found themselves in another difficult situation.\n\n\"At a point when we realized everything they were involved in,\" Lt. Peebles said, they thought, \"OK, how are we going to arrest them and keep them in jail without using anything from the operations as evidence, because once we do that it exposes the operation?\"The violence continued. A little more than a month later, a bouncer at Club Dreams on Washington Road was shot twice in the chest. A week after that, police say, Mr. Plowright appeared in Colur Tyme again -- this time accompanied by Mr. Jones. For $240, they sold police a .40-caliber handgun that ballistics tests later matched to the club shooting. By then, police had connected Mr. Plowright and Mr. Milligan to the robbery of the Video Warehouse on Tobacco Road. Mr. Plowright was also accused of stealing a billfold from a 16-year-old Sonic employee in October 2006.In late April, Mr. Jones was arrested and charged with the shooting at Club Dreams. Two weeks later, Investigator Carrier and Investigator Paul Godden said, they followed Mr. Plowright, who was driving a stolen car, from Colur Tyme and tried to do a traffic stop. He rammed the investigators with his car, then led them on a half-mile chase to the entrance of the Raintree subdivision before he was captured. After his arrest, a stolen Colt .45 pistol was found beneath the car seat.\n\nBecause he rammed the investigators' vehicle, police said they were able to charge him with aggravated assault on a police officer, ensuring that he would remain in jail until trial, and they managed to keep Augusta Ink quiet for the time being\n\n\"He basically handed us 'no bond' on a silver platter,\" Lt. Peebles said.Essential to the success of Augusta Ink were the close bonds the undercover investigators built with their targets, according to police. Suspects vented to their business associates, who happened to work in the Richmond County sheriff's office.\n\nRead more...\n\n\"The Crown has presented no evidence of what Giles actually did,\" Richard Fowler said of the charges against his client, David Francis Giles, 58, a Hells Angels member for more than 20 years.\"What cogent evidence is there that he's engaged in criminal activity?\" he asked B.C. Supreme Court Justice Anne MacKenzie.After a 10-month trial, the prosecution has offered no evidence to prove Giles ever possessed or controlled nine kilograms of cocaine seized by police in Kelowna in 2005, Fowler said.\n\n\"In this case, there's no evidence of who supplied the cocaine. There is no evidence that he paid for the cocaine,\" he added.\n\nFowler suggested the Crown has taken evidence and moulded it to fit its theory that Giles was involved in a \"joint venture\" with two co-accused in possessing the cocaine for trafficking.\"But it's ill-fitting,\" he said of the Crown evidence.\n\nGiles is accused of possessing cocaine for the purpose of trafficking \"for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to wit: the East End chapter of the Hells Angels.\"\n\nThe trial is a test case of the anti-gang law being applied against the Hells Angels in B.C.Also on trial are alleged Hells Angels associates David Roger Revell, 43, and Richard Andrew Rempel, 24, who are accused of cocaine trafficking and possessing cocaine for the purpose of trafficking in association with a criminal organization -- the Hells Angels.In April 2005, police seized nine kilograms of cocaine over a two-day period: three kilograms from a storage locker in the Kelowna area, five kilograms the next day from a secret compartment in a car kept on a used car lot in Kelowna, and another kilo seized from a drug dealer's car leaving the car lot.\n\nPolice also found about 400 grams of cocaine on the car lot, where Rempel worked. The lot was allegedly operated by Revell, who also operated a local gym and a restaurant.The Crown, during four days of final arguments, played a number of recordings of intercepted phone calls and outlined a flurry of BlackBerry e-mails allegedly exchanged between Revell and Rempel after the cocaine was seized from the storage locker and police were checking the car containing the cocaine.\n\nPolice also installed covert listening devices in Giles' Kelowna-area home and in the Hells Angels clubhouse in Kelowna.\n\nThe Crown contends Vancouver's East End Hells Angels were expanding into Kelowna, where they wanted to establish a new chapter and take control of the lucrative illicit drug market.In one conversation in Giles' home on May 2, 2005, the biker is heard discussing the seized cocaine and telling Revell: \"We'll get back up.\"\n\nThe Crown suggested that is evidence both men are involved in the cocaine seizures and that they further discussed how much money they owed for the\n\nBut Fowler argued the quality of the recording was so poor that the words attributed to Giles were not clear. \"Nor is it clear Giles is talking at that point,\" he added, suggested there may be someone else in the room other than Revell and Giles.\n\nFowler went over a number of phone calls to show Giles was not directing or controlling Revell and Rempel.The lawyer suggested Giles and Revell were simply friends who often discussed things over the phone and in person. Police surveillance observed Giles and Revell meeting outside a Kelowna gym called Reflex on April 6.\n\nThe eight-minute meeting occurred as police were seizing the car containing the five kilograms of cocaine.What might have been discussed at that meeting is simply speculation, Fowler said, adding the judge should be cautious in making inferences not based on a foundation of fact.The lawyer pointed out that during a wiretap conversation on May 2, 2005 between Giles and Revell, they discussed the loss of eight kilograms of cocaine, which he said indicates only that Giles had knowledge of the cocaine, but was not controlling or directing Revell or the drugs.\n\n\"You have to be extremely careful about relying on after-the-fact conversations to infer knowledge,\" Fowler told the judge.\n\nThe judge pointed out that Giles was heard saying in the Kelowna clubhouse: \"I deal in drugs.\" But Fowler said the comment must be viewed in its context -- Giles was discussing what police believe. \"He's relaying what he's been told [by police],\" he added.The defence lawyers will continue their final arguments today at the Vancouver Law Courts.A total of 18 men were arrested. A number of trials are pending\n\nRead more...\n\nWho are they? Members of Mara Salvatrucha, better known as MS-13, who are mostly Salvadoran nationals or first generation Salvadoran-Americans, but also Hondurans, Guatemalans, Mexicans, and other Central and South American immigrants. And according to the FBI's recent national threat assessment of this growing, mobile street gang, they could be operating in your community...now or in the near future. Based on information from their own investigations, from state and local law enforcement partners, and from community organizations, FBI concluded that while the threat posed by MS-13 to the U.S. as a whole is at the \"medium\" level, membership in parts of the country is so concentrated that they have labeled the threat level there \"high.\"\n\nMS-13 operates in at least 42 states and the District of Columbia and has about 6,000-10,000 members nationwide. Currently, the threat is highest in the western and northeastern parts of the country, which coincides with elevated Salvadoran immigrant populations in those areas. In the southeast and central regions, the current threat is moderate to low, but recently, FBI see's an influx of MS-13 members into the southeast, causing an increase in violent crimes thereRight now, according to the FBI MS-13 has no official national leadership structure. MS-13 originated in Los Angeles, but when members migrated eastward, they began forming cliques that for the most part operated independently. These cliques, though, often maintain regular contact with members in other regions to coordinate recruitment/criminal activities and to prevent conflicts. The FBI believes that Los Angeles gang members have an elevated status among their MS-13 counterparts across the country, a system of respect that could potentially evolve into a more organized national leadership structure.MS-13 members engage in a wide range of criminal activity, including drug distribution, murder, rape, prostitution, robbery, home invasions, immigration offenses, kidnapping, carjackings/auto thefts, and vandalism. Most of these crimes, you'll notice, have one thing in common—they are exceedingly violent. And while most of the violence is directed toward other MS-13 members or rival street gangs, innocent citizens often get caught\n\nin the crossfire. MS-13 is expanding its membership at an \"alarming\" rate through recruitment and migration. Some MS-13 members move to get jobs or to be near family members—currently, the southeast and the northeast are seeing the largest increases in membership. MS-13 often recruits new members by glorifying the gang lifestyle (often on the Internet, complete with pictures and videos) and by absorbing smaller gangs.Speaking of employment, MS-13 members typically work for legitimate businesses by presenting false documentation. They primarily pick employers that don't scrutinize employment documents, especially in the construction, restaurant, delivery service, and landscaping industries.The FBI, says through its MS-13 National Joint Task Force and field investigations, remains committed to working with local, state, national, and international partners to disrupt and dismantle this violent gang.\n\nMexican drug cartels responsible for recent border violence have also cemented ties to street and prison gangs on the U.S. side. U.S. gangs retail drugs purchased from Mexican traffickers and often work as cartel surrogates or enforcers on U.S. soil. Intelligence suggests Los Zetas have hired members of various gangs at different times including the Mexican Mafia, Texas Syndicate, MS-13, and Hermanos Pistoleros Latinos to further their criminal endeavors.Just this week over a dozen people were either shot or beaten to death in separate incidents in Mexican border cities. Over the weekend in Juárez Mexico, just across the Rio Grande River which is all that separates Mexico from the U.S. border city of El Paso Texas. Also, in Juárez an 8-year-old girl at a road side cafe was shot in the ribs apparently by a stray bullet during a fight between street gangs, officials said. At about 2:20 a.m. Sunday, Juárez officials said, Javier Leal Saucedo, 33, was found dead near Zaragoza Boulevard and Rayon Street. He had been beaten to death by border gangs doing the dirty work for the powerful Mexican Cartels.\n\nLater the same day at about 9 a.m., the bodies of two men were found shot in the head in Ejido Jesus Carranza, a suburb of Juárez. The victims have not been identified, but authorities said, they found two 9 mm shells near the bodies. Also on Sunday, a 30- to 35-year-old man was found dead in his car, the victim of still another gangland type killing. The cause of death and the name of the victim are not known. The incident took place near Paseo de la Plaza and Paseo de los Arcos streets in downtown Juárez. In January of this year in Tijuana Mexico not far from the American city of San Diego, officials said they found six executed kidnapping victims inside a Tijuana house where gunmen took refuge during a chaotic three-hour shootout with Mexican soldiers and police. The victims, all male, were blindfolded and gagged wrapped in blankets and had been shot in the head, although it was unclear if they were killed before or during the gun battle. said Edgar Millan, a spokesman with the federal Public Safety Department. According to Gen. Germán Redondo Azuara, commander of the second military zone said Mexican soldiers, state and local police were sent in to help control the firefight that began when federal agents prepared to raid a house in the Tijuana neighborhood of La Mesa. Police now say that it was a shelter for a cell of the Arellano Felix drug cartel.\n\nDaniel de la Rosa Anaya, the state secretary of public safety indicated to the press that three nearby schools were evacuated. Television showed police running with small children in their arms while shots rang out. Edgar Millan a top official with Mexico's federal Public Security Secretariat said, the shootout killed two gunman and one police officer and wounded three other police officers, in the latest outbreak of violence across the border from San Diego. As a result of the Mexican Government siege four gunmen were arrested – one is a well known state police investigator and another is a local Tijuana police officer. The four arrested gunmen have been flown to Mexico City for questioning. Millan said officials recovered 11 automatic rifles and three bulletproof vests inside the house. Rommel Moreño Manjarrez, Baja California's attorney general said already this week, gunmen shot and killed eight people in Tijuana alone, including three local police officers, as well as a district commander, his wife and his 12-year-old daughter. The gun battle shocked even crime-weary Tijuana residents. Many argued President Felipe Calderón should step up a yearlong crackdown on gangs, drug traffickers and other organized criminals that has sent soldiers into cities across the nation.The San Diego Tribune further reported, a Mrs. Padilla spent the three-hour shootout hiding in the closet with her 19-year-old daughter. As they crouched in the dark, they started to think they wouldn't escape alive. Gunmen across the street shouted that they would drop bombs unless police backed off.\n\n\"The gunfire was terrible,\" she said. \"It made the walls shake. I really didn't think we were going to get out.\" Less than two blocks down the street, police were rushing children from a school vulnerable to gunfire from men holed up on the roof and top floors of the besieged brick safe house.\n\nSome of the children were carried by officers who crouched and pressed themselves up against the building to avoid the bullets. Other children ran out onto the sidewalk in groups under armed guard, their eyes wide with terror. \"I could hear the hail of gunfire, and it was really strong,\" Rico Espinosa said. \"I didn't feel fear until we had evacuated all 65 kids that were under my care, and then my legs started to shake.\" Rico and the children were all safely removed from the school, but Rico's husband, Jorge Espinosa, stayed in a back room to take calls from worried parents.\n\n\"It was like being in Beirut,\" he said. Residents said soldiers, sent in to help overwhelmed police, swarmed rooftops. The gunmen refused to back down, shouting obscenities at the police and taunting them. Recently in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo assailants killed the director of public safety for the town of Tulancingo. Jose Alvarado was shot more than 20 times, Hidalgo state police director Ahuizotl Figueroa said.Many on both sides of the border have been killed or wounded and the terror goes on with authorities unable to control the gangs that kill and traffic in drugs and humans for the wealthy Mexican cartels.\n\nGen. Germán Redondo Azuara says he believes many of the drugs raised in Afghanistan, finds its way via smuggling routes into markets in both Europe and the United States where they are peddled by gang members. In turn millions of dollars and Eros are used to fund terrorist and their terror activities not only in Afghanistan but around the world. Most of these same terrorist drug organizations, that fuel the terror network also help to fund the Taliban attacks in Afghanistan. Part of this illicit cash provides operating capital for international terrorist Osama Bin Laden and others. The Columbian and Mexican drug cartels now believed to be working with international terrorist is the most pervasive organizational threat to the United States according to one D.E.A. agent. murder money & mexico: tijuana cartelThese new combined international drug trafficking organizations are complex organizations with highly defined command-and-control structures that produce, transport, and/or distribute large quantities of Afghanistan illicit drugs. Global Terrorist And Drug Trafficking CartelsA high ranking ICE official claims the Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTO´s) are perfect for the terrorist because they are active in every region of the country and dominate the illicit drug trade in every area in both Mexico and the United States. Because of this new alliance Mexican DTOs are expanding their operations dramatically in order to gain a larger share of the drug market. Colombian DTOs are dominant cocaine and heroin traffickers, particularly in the Northeast; however, they are increasingly relinquishing control to Mexican DTOs in order to shield themselves from law enforcement detection. The Mexican DTOs are already major transporters and distributors of cocaine and South American heroin into the U.S. They also distribute cocaine and other drugs to numerous other DTOs and criminal groups that are also active in the United States, the world´s largest users of cocaine and heroin.Other reasons the terrorist have chosen the Mexican DTOs is they control the transportation and wholesale distribution of most illicit drugs in every area of the western hemisphere, exerting unrivaled control over transportation and wholesale distribution of cocaine, Mexican heroin, Mexican marijuana, and ice methamphetamine. Their established overland transportation routes and entrenched distribution networks enable them to supply primary and secondary drug markets throughout these regions. Mexican DTOs are further expanding their influence throughout the world.\n\nThe drug distribution is even involving gangs in America and they in turn sale to the street dealers. The street dealers than get the products to the smaller dealers to distribute to our neighbors. All of this creates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. And that is exactly what the terrorist want.\n\nIn a recently released FBI report on gangs operating both in Mexico and the U.S which was meant for law enforcement eyes only says and we quote: That these gangs on both sides of the border perpetrate violence—from assaults to homicides, using firearms, machetes, or blunt objects—to intimidate rival gangs, law enforcement, and the general public. They often target middle and high school students for recruitment. And they form tenuous alliances...and sometimes vicious rivalries...with other criminal groups, depending on their needs at the time.\n\nRead more...\n\ngang member stabbed a city officer who tried to keep him and about a dozen others from killing a man early this morning, police said.Police said this began with a battle between two of the city's Latino gangs. They've made two arrests. This is what they said happened:Officer Richard Hammer was patrolling Mill Street by himself at about 1:45 a.m. when he saw a lone man sprint across the street followed by the group. The men caught the man and beat him, stomped on his head and stabbed him. Hammer jumped out of his car, yelling at the men to stop and calling on the radio for backup. When he grabbed two of the men, the others turned on him.Someone hit him in the back of the head. Hammer lost his grip on the two, and everyone except the beaten man ran north on Mill Street. Hammer got up, chased and caught the two he'd had before. As he pinned them against a wall, five or six others punched him in the back of the head and upper body. One of the men Hammer held turned, punched him and tried to pull him to the ground. They fought as the second man wrenched free from Hammer and ran with the rest of the group.Hammer cuffed the man he still held and waited for backup.Officers arrived and went looking for the other men. The man originally targeted by the group lay bleeding. He'd been stabbed multiple times and, police would later learn, was bleeding into his lung.Hammer noticed his leg hurt after he loaded the suspect into a patrol car. He lifted his right pant leg. Blood covered his calf and boot. He'd been stabbed in the thigh. Officers had already called an ambulance to take the wounded man to the Newburgh campus of St. Luke's Cornwall Hospital. Now, Officer Tom Reynolds loaded Hammer into a patrol car and raced him to the hospital, too. Emergency room staffers stapled the wound together. He is recovering at home today. The other man went to Westchester Medical Center. His condition wasn't available.\n\nDetectives Joseph Cortez and Lorenzo D'Angelico arrived at the scene and found a pen knife with a long, serrated blade they think stabbed Hammer and the other man. Meanwhile, officers Anthony Giudice and John Maguire spotted a man on William Street who fit the description of one of the suspects. They stopped him. He had a knife and 1.8 grams of cocaine, and they arrested him on drug charges. They're still trying to figure out his role in the fight.In the hours that followed the fight, detectives began trying to put the pieces together. Detectives Cortez and D'Angelico questioned the suspect Hammer arrested. His name is Edson Godinez, a 17-year-old who lives a couple blocks away from the fight. They said he admitted stabbing the other man and Hammer. The second man arrested was 20-year-old Emmanuel Flores of Newburgh. Police say they're gang members but declined to say which gang. They think the fight was part of an ongoing battle between the Benkard Barrio Kings and La Eme, sometimes called Mexican Mafia. The group and the lone man are gang rivals, police said.\n\nDetectives hope to identify more suspects and make more arrests in the days ahead.\n\nRead more...\n\nMorneau, 32, Christian Laurin, 19, and Alan Mulder, 19, are accused of smuggling 130 pounds of Ecstasy into the state of Montana. Convictions would carry mandatory minimum sentences of a decade, and a maximum of life with no chance of parole.\n\nDocuments filed in district court show the trio was pulled over Feb. 9 by state troopers while driving on an interstate highway in Montana. Police say inconsistencies in statements given by the three suspects led the troopers to search the vehicle, and three duffel bags containing the Ecstasy pills were seized.\n\nMorneau told police he had hauled the bags across the Canada-U.S. border by snowmobile, according to the court documents. Police also allege Morneau told them the teenagers were knowing participants, and were to be paid $1,000 for their involvement. Morneau allegedly told police he was being paid $5,000 -- from an unidentified source -- to take the bags over the border and that his accomplices were to be paid out of his take. All three accused face charges of possession with the intent to distribute.At a preliminary hearing held Friday in Billings, Montana, a judge determined there was probable cause to hold the trio. They'll most likely spend the week there before being moved to a federal facility in nearby Shelby.\n\nUnder the U.S. \"speedy trial\" law, the government has 70 days to begin trial proceedings, but the court-appointed defence lawyer for Laurin, David Merchant, said the government now must indict the three, which would start the trial clock again. No plea has been entered by any of the men, Merchant said. Merchant said the teenagers could be exempted from the 10-year mandatory minimum based on a first-offence \"safety valve\" that exists in U.S. law, should the amount of drugs alleged to be involved turn out to be less.Merchant said he's still waiting on lab reports to verify the exact amount of Ecstacy in the duffel bags.Merchant also said he sees serious problems with the case so far, and wonders why police pulled the three over for a broken headlight at 7:50 a.m.\n\n\"There's some things that don't add up -- they were pulled over for another reason,\" Merchant said. Winnipeg police said Mulder was reported missing by family on Tuesday.\n\nHe had told family he was travelling to Mall of America in Minneapolis.\n\nLaurin's Facebook profile indicates his friends are aware of his situation -- he had been active on the social networking site up until Wednesday of last week.\n\nHe listed his favourite activities as \"working out every day and spending money.\"\n\nBy 4:30 p.m. Friday, his profile had been pulled down, but a friend of Laurin said the teenagers are friends who had known each other for a couple of years.\n\nMorneau is a self-employed mechanic who is no stranger to the local Hells Angels, who often come to him to fix their bikes, justice sources said.He's also become well known in the courts recently.Morneau currently faces drug charges stemming from a May 2007 arrest. Winnipeg police stopped a car in which Morneau was a passenger and seized 76 Percocet pills and 30 rocks of crack cocaine,He was also charged with possessing an illegal metal baton and found to be carrying several cellphones. Police and the Crown alleged Morneau was working as a local \"dial-a-dealer.\" He has denied the allegations.\n\nAt the time of his drug arrest, Morneau had been free on bail pending sentencing for his role in an unusual theft ring.\n\nMorneau was nabbed in July 2006 and admitted to breaking into several semi-trailers parked in locked compounds on the edge of the city. He stole several items including 800 pounds of ground beef, $2,500 in beer and $400 worth of McDonald's products, court was told.Morneau was supposed to be sentenced for those crimes in early 2007 but the case was delayed when he failed to show up for a court-ordered meeting with his probation officer.\n\nRead more...\n\nsoldiers seized 23.5 tonnes of cocaine – enough for about 200 million lines of the drug – in the world's biggest ever cocaine bust. It was destroyed in a public bonfire. Calderon is hoping his crackdown will bring his administration rewards from the US, which has frequently urged its southern neighbour to be more aggressive against drug mafias. The US Congress is debating a $1.4 billion anti-drug aid proposal for Mexico, including high-tech phone-tapping equipment and possibly Black Hawk helicopters.The proposal has been tacked onto a bill requesting more funding for US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Calderon argues the US government has a responsibility to help out because US drug users fund the traffickers - analysts estimate that Mexican drug trade to the US is worth around $10 billion to $30 billion a year.Most of the weapons fuelling the bloodshed are also bought in US gun stores and smuggled south over the Rio Grande.\"How are we supposed to confront these guys if they come at us? We need the army to wipe them out\"Osiel Mendoza, Mexico City police officera group of armed men went to the house of a police officer in Tijuana and shot him dead, along with his wife and nine-year-old daughter.Armed men have also battled police and soldiers in clashes lasting up to three hours, turning Mexican residential areas into war zones.Analysts say the orchestrated attacks show that Mexico's longstanding drug violence has entered a new phase. In the past, rival gangs fought over billion-dollar smuggling routes of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana to the US. Now, the gangs are working together to defend these routes from the federal government.\"We used to see narcos against narcos. Now we are seeing narcos against cops,\" Jorge Chabat, a Mexican drug expert, told Al Jazeera using the common Mexican name for drug traffickers. \"Calderon is paying the price for taking on the cartels. As he has five years left in power, he might just get away with it.\"\"It's a bi-national problem,\" said a senior US drug official in Mexico who withheld his name for security reasons. \"It's an extremely bloody uphill battle. Narco-organisations have a developed infrastructure. It is being threatened and we are seeing their brutal response.\"However, critics worry that Black Hawks or other such tools given to Mexico could fall into the wrong hands. In the last two decades, hundreds of police, soldiers and politicians have been convicted of working for the cartels. One entire unit of army special forces deserted in the late 1990s to form a paramilitary commando called the Zetas, who work as bloody enforcers for the Gulf Cartel. Their rival, the Sinaloa Cartel, imitated their paramilitary style by training hundreds of would be enforcers in special weapons and tactics. After years of beheadings and reprisal massacres, these two cartels recently reached a truce, only to turn their wrath on the federal government, according to Mexican and US drug officials.The level of firepower of the drug gangs has been shown in raids on cartel safe houses in recent weeks. Police stormed one middle-class Mexico City home to find 30 guns, 12 grenade launchers, 30 grenades and more than 40 bullet-proof jackets with the initials FEDA – a Spanish acronym for \"Special Forces of Arturo Beltran\", an alleged drug gang leader.A raid on a Tijuana warehouse used by a cartel for training even unearthed a shooting range and assault course.Low ranking police officers complain they are outgunned and are risking their lives for salaries which are as low as $600 per month.\"How are we supposed to confront these guys if they come at us?\" Osiel Mendoza, a Mexico City police officer, \"We need the army to wipe them out.\"\n\nRead more..."
