The Editors . . 7 List of abbreviations used in the compilation of the index ........ 15 Analytical index to the Series . . . . 17 PREFACE This and the succeeding volume, which contain the analytical index to the preceding fifty-three volumes of The Philippine Islands: i4Qj-i8g8, bring the series to a close. Throughout the compilation of the index, the effort has been to furnish the investigator the most comprehensive guide to the material of the text. The multifarious interests treated in the various documents, touching as they do so many phases of human life and thought, and their complexity, together with all the elements usually present in the making of an index, have rendered this a task of considerable mag- nitude. Constant classification and anaylsis have necessarily been demand- ed to an unusual degree in the longer topics; and these, with the many thousands of minor citations, both concrete and abstract, and names of per- sons and places, with their numerous variants, have necessitated the utmost care in detail and arrangement. Considerable important additional in- formation has been embodied in footnotes to several captions. Although still far short of their ideal, the editors are confident that the index will stand the test of use. Wherever possible, matter has been collected under general heads, thus facilitating the work of investigation. All natural features have been collected under their appropriate captions as follows: Bays, Gulfs, and Harbors; Capes, Points, and Promontories; Islands [exclusive of the Philippines] ; Lakes, Meteorology; Mountains and Hills; Oceans and Seas; Peninsulas; Rivers; Straits and Channels; and Volcanoes. Similarly, have been collected the various forms of animal life, thus: Birds; Fishes and Fisheries; Invertebrates; Mammals; and Reptiles. Certain products, both natural and the result of man's activity, fall into heads as follows: Cloth- ing; Drugs; Dyes and Dyestuffs; Earthenware; Fibers; Furniture; Gems and Precious Stones; Gums and Resins; Hardware; Hides and Leather; Machines and Machinery; Manufactures; Mines and Mining (including Metals and Minerals); Nuts; Oils; Perfumes; Paints and Varnishes; Plants and Trees; Provisions and Supplies; Shells; Spices; Textiles; Tools, Implements, and Utensils; and Wines, Liquors, and Spirits.
