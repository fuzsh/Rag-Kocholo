        "text": "üì¢ Join us for a webinar on November 14, 2023, from 16:00 - 17:30 CET to discover how companies and environmental NGOs combat illegal fishing. We've teamed up with Global Fishing Watch, Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance, and TMT to bring you an event that explores how businesses can drive positive change in the maritime sector. What can you expect? - Learn about actionable insights and best practices from businesses and environmental NGOs. - Understand the importance of promoting transparency and adopting risk-mitigation approaches to ensure that your business doesn't inadvertently support illegal fishing. The event will have a diverse panel of experts from various sectors, including maritime insurance with British Marine Insurance and Gard AS, risk screening with LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), and non-profit with TMT. They will share their expertise, insights, and experiences, shedding light on how businesses can play a crucial role in fighting illegal fishing. Don't miss this opportunity to learn and connect with professionals. Let's work together to make a real impact in the fight against illegal fishing. Register at this link to secure your spot: https://lnkd.in/dGDQpvME\n\nIllegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing remains one of the greatest threats to marine ecosystems due to its potential to undermine national and regional efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks; inhibiting the progress towards achieving goals of long-term sustainability and responsibility. I‚Äôve become very passionate about this topic over the last few months while I was working alongside my people leader, Kirsti-Leigh Styer, to investigate the risk associated with fishing vessels engaged in IUU activities; and shine some much-needed light on its impact on the global fishing sector. If you are interested in learning more about IUU fishing, please join this webinar!\n\nWe know for a fact corals need healthy fish populations to survive üê† That's why we're proud to stand with the Stop Funding Overfishing Coalition at such a crucial time. This week, the World Trade Organization's 13th Ministerial Conference takes center stage, presenting a pivotal opportunity to address and end the subsidies fueling overfishing. The stakes couldn't be higher for our oceans and the communities that depend on them üåä Harmful subsidies are a green light for unsustainable fishing practices that devastate fish populations and undermine the health of our oceans. It's time for change. The @WorldTradeOrganization has the power to steer us towards sustainable seas by ratifying the agreement to #StopFundingOverfishing at #MC13 üôå Join us in this critical moment. Learn more, spread the word, and let's make a difference together. Learn why this matters and how you can be part of the solution üëâ https://hubs.la/Q02mx22Q0\n\nIn whose short term interest would we bottom fish? The UK imposed the ban on bottom fishing in 13 marine protected areas on 22 March. Under pressure from the national industrial fishing sector, France has assembled a coalition of member states to pressure the European Commission to impose sanctions on the UK for non-compliance with the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) signed in 2020 by London and Brussels. Bottom fishing involves dragging heavy nets along the ocean floor, a method environmental NGOs consider destructive. #biofarming #ecofarming #ecofishing #bottomfishing #naturalhabitat #independentfisheries #doasisaynotasido\n\nüö® Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a major threat to our marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of coastal communities. But how do we tackle the hidden beneficiaries behind these illicit activities? This latest briefing by Members of the EU IUU Fishing Coalition highlights the importance of beneficial ownership transparency in identifying EU nationals who profit from IUU fishing. The opaque nature of the global fisheries sector often allows beneficial owners to hide behind foreign flags, complex ownership, and corporate structures, evading sanctions and scrutiny. The EU has clear legal provisions to prevent its nationals from supporting IUU fishing, however, gaps in oversight still exist, potentially allowing profits from illegal activities to flow back into the EU. Our briefing outlines how the EU can close oversight gaps and lead global efforts against IUU fishing by promoting transparency, accountability, and responsible practices. By uncovering and holding accountable the true owners behind these operations, we can enforce stricter sanctions and promote sustainable fishing practices.üåêüåç Learn more here ‚û° https://lnkd.in/ePywkddQ #IUUfishing #SustainableFisheries #ProtectOurOceans #FightIUUFishing Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) WWF European Policy Office The Pew Charitable Trusts Oceana in Europe üì∑ EJF\n\nOur UKinNZ team were humbled to meet member states of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) this week in their inaugural Development Partner Symposium in Wellington. 30% of the world's tuna comes from the waters of FFA members, and their leadership has contributed to the Western and Central Pacific having the most sustainable stocks in the world. However, challenges facing the region, including climate change, food security and illegal fishing, need urgent and co-ordinated action to support the health of the ocean and of Pacific people. The UK is exploring ways to increase our support to help communities to protect their livelihoods, to support marine management, and to combat under-reporting of catch. https://lnkd.in/geFpCK63\n\nDepending on the species, food chain, and conditions of the waterway, the additional salmon ‚Äúcould be intrusive to that environment and cause some degree of damage,‚Äù says our own Karim Jaroudi. ‚ÄúAnything that did not belong there to begin with may need to be remediated.‚Äù Learn more about the related #Environmental exposures here: https://lnkd.in/ezpYVN9E\n\nüåäThe ocean is the 7th largest economy when ranked with national GDPs. So, who is in charge of protecting and safeguarding the future of this invaluable resource? üåç Governments, fisheries, retailers, hospitality businesses, and consumers all have vital roles to play in protecting our oceans and ensuring the future food security provided by fish and seafood. Join the conversation and let's work together to protect this crucial part of our planet.
