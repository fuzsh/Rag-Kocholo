        "text": "«Thinking that here it’s represented only the lower part of the building, that is the most narrow part in this kind of building, it’s possible to imagine how much large, high, stately and impressive it had to be. […] there is not risk to make a mistake thinking to it as one of the most extraordinary building never built». This is what Jean Houel wrote in his diary “voyage a Syracuse” (1777 – Palermo 2003). The building described by the famous traveler was re-discovered only in 1839. It is a hundred and forty meters long and a hundred and nineteen meters large, and the most part of it is dug in the rock. Nowadays it is still possible to see two ambulatories covered whit a vaulted roof under the cave, and the superior ambulatories that allow to enter in the terraces of the various parts of the cavea. The amphitheater is in the Neapolis of Syracuse, near to the famous Greek Theater; for this reason the first is overshadowed by the second. Until 2012 the building was overwhelmed by a lush vegetation that make impossible the survey work. Tourist can’t visit this area because of safety problems so that only few people know its existence. Its geometrical aspects and its dimensions have never been studied before now. The following work deal with the firsts results of a survey work made through the scan laser Riegl – VZ400. This instrument and its\n\nThe work presented wants to show how different techniques of expeditious relief can be combined together in order to better describe the subject studied. Techniques of digital projection as laser scanner, topography and Structure from Motion can be used simultaneously and interact with each other to create a rich database of colorimetric and metrics information. Methodologies that, at the same time, present the peculiarities and errors of peculiar relief of the technology employed.The case study examined in this type of research is the discovery of the amphitheater of Volterra. Discovered in July 2015 during the phases of reclamation of a stream, is located close to Porta Diana and a few hundred meters from the Roman Theater discovered in the last century. An excavation campaign undertaken Between October and November 2015 has allowed us to bring to light the crests of the supporting walls of the structure, revealing the presence of the three orders and a depth of about ten meters.T...\n\nThe Mokrsko fire test focused on the overall behaviour of the structure, which cannot be observed on the separate elements, and also on the temperature of connections with improved fire resistance. During the test, measurements were made of the temperature of the gas and of the elements, the overall and relative deformations, gas pressure, humidity, the radiation of the compartment to structural element and the external steel column, transport of the moisture through the walls, and also the climatic conditions. The results of the test show the differences between the behaviour of the element and the behaviour of the structure exposed to high temperatures during a fire. The collapse of the composite slab was reached. The results of the numerical simulations using the SAFIR program compared well with the measured temperature values in the structure and also in the connections."
