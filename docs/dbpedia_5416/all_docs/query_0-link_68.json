It reports that over 1,600 people were killed, including 700 passengers on a ferry that capsized. Over 3.7 million people were displaced from their homes. Experts warn that disasters like this typhoon will continue to occur unless a watershed and local economic framework is adopted to build regional resilience against climate change. The document also provides an update on the case of Filipino caregiver Juana Tejada, who may be granted permanent residency status in Canada on humanitarian grounds.",
