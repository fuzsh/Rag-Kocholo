Framingham native and film producer Carly Hugoâ€™s documentary film "Hot Coffee" will premiere on HBO tonight at 9 p.m.

Directed by Susan Saladoff, the film documents the famous case of a woman suing McDonald's after spilling a hot coffee from the chain on her lap. It was selected for the Sundance Film Festival in January.

Hugo, a graduate of Framingham High School, also produced "Higher Ground" and was the production supervisor of "Restless City," two other films shown at Sundance.
