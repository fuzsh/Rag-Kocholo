What a Sundance Festival for Oregon Films! Today it was announced that Ashland based Susan Saladoff sold her documentary “Hot Coffee” to HBO. This is Susan’s first film and the success of the film is sure to make everyone believe that documentary film making is still viable. Credit does go to Susan’s ability to tell a compelling story but she also created a great on line presence for the film.
