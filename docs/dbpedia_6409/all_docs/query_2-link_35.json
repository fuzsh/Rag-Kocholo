        "text": "Warner Bros. announced an industry-shaking approach to distributing its films in 2021, revealing that it will be making all 17 of its theatrically-released movies that year available concurrently for a one-month exclusive window on HBO Max.\n\nThat means United States-based consumers will be able to watch highly anticipated releases including Dune, The Matrix 4, The Suicide Squad, Mortal Kombat, and more at the same time on HBO Max as they would be able to see them released in theaters. More importantly, watching the movies will require no extra cost to HBO Max subscribers.\n\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/dune-the-matrix-4-mortal-kombat-coming-to-hbo-max-along-with-entire-wb-2021-slate\n\nStupid, stupid move. The piracy levels for these will be off the scale.\n\nI think it will depend on how people get these films. Wonder Women is going to be PVOD so we have to pay for it rather then it being on a streaming service. If all this was on Sky Cinema it wouldn't be so with bad day and date with HBO max. If we have to do this for every movie, it will fail miserably.\n\nThey have to have a international plan right? I really wish they had waited till they have a plan for everyone.\n\n0\n\nInsane not to have rolled Max out globally. Literally throwing money away.\n\nThe output deals they signed with the likes of Sky, Bell and Foxtel in the last year are pretty damn lucrative (the original 2010 Sky deal became the basis of their international deals) - they are probably making a hell of a lot of money just providing the content to those platforms and letting them do all of the work advertising, broadcasting and streaming while they just sit back, cash the cheque and continue to make money from the ancillary sales like transactional VOD and disc sales... when they announced the Sky deal last year they specifically stated it was for 'stability & predictability\"... those deals are pretty good for them.\n\nWarner Bros. announced an industry-shaking approach to distributing its films in 2021, revealing that it will be making all 17 of its theatrically-released movies that year available concurrently for a one-month exclusive window on HBO Max.\n\nThat means United States-based consumers will be able to watch highly anticipated releases including Dune, The Matrix 4, The Suicide Squad, Mortal Kombat, and more at the same time on HBO Max as they would be able to see them released in theaters.

If we have to do this for every movie, it will fail miserably.\n\nThey have to have a international plan right? I really wish they had waited till they have a plan for everyone.\n\nJason Kilar just had an interview with Deadline and states the current intention remains these films are theatrically exhibited in the rest of the global marketplace - though I wonder if maybe like WW84, they could roll out earlier internationally? I think the issue with an international release are differing rules in the global marketplace - doing it for HBOMax only is easy as it's one market, they have a platform to grow and they can negotiate favourable terms for the theatres in the domestic market.\n\nI think the wording 'PVOD' Variety used for their report re: Sky/WW84 wasn't the best as it went on to suggest it was not entirely clear if it was an SVOD or PVOD release... I think a Sky exclusive PVOD release doesn't really make sense for either party - if there is exclusivity involved, I can only imagine it is for a Sky Cinema/SVOD release.\n\n1\n\nWhile I am a Odeon Limitless card holder, i will be watching the majority of these at the cinema, providing they are open. Nobody knows how COVID is going to affect cinemas next year, so while there is a high risk of piracy, there is also the risk of cinemas being closed, so while a simultaneous Cinema / VOD Streaming release is a risk, it does make sense for them to try and make some form of income.\n\nI have been looking at Odeon’s listings for the week ahead and they include\n\nDie Hard\n\nET\n\nHome Alone 1 & 2\n\nElf\n\nNational `Lampoons Christmas Vacation\n\nTotal Recall 30th Anniversary\n\nIf Cinemas are forced to close again after the 16th, then even WW84 which is one of the few new films out this year, it isn’t likely to make enough to break even.\n\n0\n\nI think it will depend on how people get these films.\n\nIn the world we live in today, these films will be out online in full HD to download within the day of release. It's definitely going to happen.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the cinema experience - something like The Matrix 4 will be well worth seeing at the cinema but you can't hide from the fact that these films will be pirated quickly. Obviously Warners must realise this though, which does make me wonder if there are other plans afoot that they aren't revealing just yet.\n\n0\n\nWhile I get there are marketing benefits to having lots of tv streamers watching the film on the same day that it goes to cinemas, I find it remarkable that they aren't giving cinemas at least a one week head start to both lessen the impact of pirating, but also to give the cinemas a much needed financial boost.\n\nI'm also sceptical that they plan to do this throughout the whole of 2021. Now we know we have vaccines, it's likely that cinemas could go back to normalish in time for the big releases next Autumn, and probably even for late Summer. So it makes me question whether they are planning this to be their long-term model, and not just something for the pandemic. Either that or they are hoping the announcement of multiple big releases being on HBOmax means they'll get so many extra subscribers who will stay with them in the long-term that it's worth losing the money from cinemas, and risking the long-term future of that income stream.\n\nAnd maybe they've all bought shares in the companies that make big TVs and surround sound systems?\n\nIt's perhaps also a sign of how concerned they are that the US won't get COVID controlled any time soon. Maybe they think vaccine uptake will be too low or slow to roll-out there.\n\n0\n\nThe problem is that HBO Max has not a massive take up in the US. These films are to entice subscribers, and I think it will work.\n\nOne of the issues isn't just new subs - It's also that a lot of HBO subscribers have access to Max already but either don't know they have it or don't know how to move over...\n\nThere's been a few stats bandied about - Matthew Ball (well regarded media analyst) stated \"40% of HBO subs only watch movies, 75% of linear viewing is movies, 35% of on demand is movies\"\n\nMovies are massively important to HBO so this is going to hopefully help those current subs convert on top of drawing new subs - and I saw something earlier today where someone estimated that 8.2 million new subscribers will be needed to cover the potential 1.2 Billion dollar shortfall from the box office... either way this is a massive bet.\n\n0\n\nThe problem is that HBO Max has not a massive take up in the US.

I believe that is still the big issue with Roku; they want to keep HBO on and add HBO Max’s library to the ‘Roku Channel’ as well as disputing ad revenue/inventory for the ad supported version expected next year. But yep, the lack of Roku is hugely glaring but I still expect that deal to be made sooner rather than later.\n\n1\n\nIt’s a poor decision if it’s a long term one which If successful it most certainly will be. Cannibalising the box office and potentially taking down the big theatre chains if other companies follow suit. I get that the box office is in the toilet right now with cinemas being shut and COVID but it’s not going to be permanent. Once the vaccine has been administered to everyone that wants it people will want to go out again and do normal things after a year of effectively being cooped up at home and not being able to normal things.\n\nCinemas by far give the best experience to watch a movie. There isn’t a tv that is of a size of a massive cinema screen (especially in imax) and there isn’t a sound system at home that can compete with a loud noisy cinema. Sure there are is a negative with some people on phones but if you are selective of when you go and where you sit it can be avoided.\n\nMovies going on hbo max will only increase piracy. On the day of release it will be available to torrent. Plus no movies are going to make a billion dollars via streaming. Each film is only going to be on hbo max for 30 days so it’s not permanent.\n\n0"
