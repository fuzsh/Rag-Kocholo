        "text": "HBO Films is a division of the cable television network HBO that produces feature films and miniseries. While much of HBO Films output is created directly for the television market, such as the film Witness Protection and the miniseries Angels in America, Band of Brothers, The Pacific, Generation Kill, and Mildred Pierce, it has also branched into theatrical distribution with such critically acclaimed films as Elephant and American Splendor, in which their theatrical releases were handled by Fine Line Features, then a subsidiary of New Line Cinema. Theatrical releases of HBO Films output were usually handled by Picturehouse, a joint venture between HBO Films and New Line (as Fine Line was folded into Picturehouse); both are owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nHBO began producing films in 1983 with their HBO Premiere Films banner. Their first film, The Terry Fox Story, was also the first feature film produced expressly for pay television. In 1985, HBO Pictures was started, folding the Premiere Films brand into it. Another film production company, HBO Showcase (later HBO NYC) was folded into HBO Pictures to create the current company HBO Films.\n\nHBO Films productions are generally regarded to be high-quality and groundbreaking. The films produced by the company have garnered hundreds of Primetime Emmy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. HBO Films productions have won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie every year from 1993 to 2015, except 2000 and 2003. Elephant is the first film produced by HBO Films to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of HBO Films films\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nGallery[]"
