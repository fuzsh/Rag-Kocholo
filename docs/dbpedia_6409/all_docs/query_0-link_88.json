        "text": "There was a time long ago when gargantuan tour buses — splashed with pink and stock images of girlfriends sipping on cocktails — roved the isle of Manhattan. They transported women, mostly; huddled masses from across the middle America, all yearning to breathe free and drink a cosmopolitan cocktail at the same bars frequented by Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte, the characters of HBO’s Sex and the City.\n\nBut much like the once ubiquitous “going out” top, such tours have become a rare (albeit ongoing) sight. Many of the restaurants featured on the original show, which ran from 1998 to 2004 and somehow never addressed 9/11, have long been closed. The women’s favorite hangout, Coffee Shop in Union Square, closed in 2018 and has been replaced by a Chase bank. City Bakery, where Carrie re-encounters “the face girl” Nina Katz, has also permanently closed its doors, denying the city its top-rate chocolate chip cookies.\n\nThe New York we enter in And Just Like That..., the Sex and the City reboot on HBO Max, is not the New York we left in 2004. We’ve experienced hurricanes, market crashes, and a deadly pandemic that we’re still contending with. The lavish lifestyle demonstrated by the series’ main ladies has taken on a grotesqueness, especially following the Trump presidency, which further laid bare the inequities inherent in capitalism. Bisexuality can no longer be written off, as Carrie once did, as a “layover to Gaytown.”\n\nBut still, there are bars and restaurants. Bars and restaurants on the brink of doom, sure, but they’re hanging on all the same. No pandemic or death of a loved one by Peleton (for the best, it seems) will stop Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte — sans Samantha, as actor Kim Cattrall who declined to return to the series due to friction with lead and executive producer Sarah Jessica Parker — from dining across the city.\n\nWant to pretend like it’s 2004 again? Well, throw on some low-rise jeans and Manolos and hit the town (masked and boosted, or better yet, maybe just in your imagination). Here, we’ll be charting every restaurant, bar, and cafe that makes a featured appearance on And Just Like That... for your touring convenience. Obviously, there will be some spoilers.\n\nEpisode One, “Hello It’s Me”\n\nThis premiere was obviously dominated by one major controversy, which has little to do with food and that’s Carrie not attempting CPR or calling 911 as Big flopped around on the floor of their gigantic shower and died.\n\nClee, a.k.a the Whitney Cafe, 99 Gansevoort Street\n\nBut before that, there are some restaurants. In fact, we’re reintroduced to Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte as they wait for a table at Clee, a fictional restaurant that was filmed in non-fictional restaurant the Whitney Cafe, part of the Whitney Museum. The real star of this meal is Carrie’s stupid little Robin Hood hat, which she is not pulling off nearly as well as that sexy cartoon fox. Also, great news! In this alternate reality, COVID is over. How nice for them, their fellow patrons, and the staff of “Clee.”\n\nSmith’s Bar and Grill, 701 8th Avenue\n\nBefore her first class at Columbia where she’s enrolled to get her master’s degree in “Human Rights,” Miranda stops for a drink at this theater district mainstay and while she’s there, we’re introduced to an exciting new character: Miranda’s Alcoholism! She tries to order a glass of chablis at 10:45 a.m., which, yes, is pretty early for wine, but more concerning is why she’d stop at a bar on 8th and West 44th Street, which is nowhere near her townhouse in Brooklyn or Columbia University, which is all the way up on West 114th Street.\n\nIn Manhattan, there are plenty of bars to get lost in and most of them, fortunately, are not next to Times Square.\n\nEpisode Two, “Little Black Dress”\n\nThis episode is mostly taken up by Big’s ugly and sparse funeral at the Greene Naftali Gallery and not so much on the streets of New York City, which, as everyone knows, is the show’s other leading lady.\n\nCarrie does however stare wistfully at a couple eating on the patio of the East Pole, located on the Upper East Side. The couple remind her of her and Big, because the woman is blonde and the man has dark hair and is wearing an expensive suit. Understandably, this makes grieving Carrie sad, but she shouldn’t be. As far as she knows, that guy works for the Blackstone Group or makes his money developing property that displaces poor people. Maybe Big did that, too. Anyway, lunch looked nice and we’ll be revisiting the East Pole later.\n\nEpisode Three, “When in Rome...”\n\nDid you know that even Charlotte’s best friend Anthony got into sourdough during the pandemic? Only he turned it into a bustling business called Hot Fellas (did the writers even try on this one?), where the bread is delivered by... hot fellas. This scene is largely marked by Anthony’s dismissal of Charlotte’s child’s trans identity, stating that kids are confused and Charlotte should ignore it. Good to know that, in addition to making bread, he’s up to date on Jesse Singal’s Substack.\n\nAnyway, I will not be ordering my bread from Hot Fellas in the future.\n\nThe East Pole, 133 East 65th Street\n\nI had to send a lot of screenshots of this dining room where Charlotte, Miranda, Carrie, and Stanford gathered for lunch in order to identify the restaurant even though, as noted above, the show has already visited the exterior. Thankfully, Eater NY’s Bao Ong came to my rescue, even providing the following Instagram from the restaurant:\n\nMore fun than the restaurant itself, though, is Stanford (played by the late Willie Garson) telling Charlotte that he used to work at the iconic Tribeca bistro Odeon, and that’s how he knows a three-top can always become a four-top. Many servers will disagree!\n\nStarbucks, 72 Spring Street\n\nCharlotte, Miranda, and Miranda’s many bottles of airport cart Tito’s wait for Carrie at this Starbucks in SoHo, right across the street from Balthazar (once featured in Sex and the City under the name Balzac). In a TV series full of necessary belief-suspension, this one will put you over the edge because that Starbucks location has never had less than 700 people stuffed into it at one time, and that’s an official statistic. Also the barista brings Miranda a muffin to her table and it’s even on a plate. In real life, the overworked barista would have shouted “MORGANDA?” and hurled it at her from the register.\n\nChalait UWS, 461 Amsterdam Avenue\n\nIt’s at Chalait, a cafe specializing in matcha drinks, that Carrie is finally able to corner Big’s ex-wife Natasha by accidentally walking in on her while she’s trying to take a piss in peace, but with the door puzzlingly unlocked. (What’s unbelievable here is that there’s a New York coffee shop where you don’t need a special code or key to get into the bathroom.) In the fumble to close the door, Carrie spills hot coffee and burns herself, so maybe Chalait is actually good...\n\nThe bar at Webster Hall, 125 East 11 Street\n\nCarrie, Charlotte, and Miranda go to see Carrie’s colleague Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez) shoot their standup special at venue Webster Hall. Afterward, Miranda, her sexuality re-awakened by Che’s wit, sticks around for the afterparty. Che, not disinterested, shotguns a mouthful of weed vape into Miranda’s mouth. DeBlasio’s New York, baby!\n\nEpisode Four, “Some of My Best Friends”\n\nCafe Kitsuné, 550 Hudson Street, and Parliament Espresso and Coffee Bar, 170 Central Park West\n\nThis episode begins with everyone in New York City indulging in their favorite coffees, and while Carrie — dressed in a petticoat and striped crewneck, a return to her old self — chooses a dark roast with no sugar from her corner store, Charlotte is ordering lattes at Cafe Kitsuné to share with new friend Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker). Meanwhile, LTW, as she’s known, is ordering Charlotte a coffee at Parliament Espresso and Coffee Bar (revisited again later in the episode), which is inside the New-York Historical Society. The women exchange their javas in front of their kids’ school, the exterior of which is actually the City Museum of New York on 5th Avenue, right across the street from Central Park. (Fun-ish fact: the City Museum is also used as the exterior of the school in Gossip Girl.)\n\nIn reality, Cafe Kitsuné is in the West Village, right around the corner from the shooting location of Carrie’s brownstone and nowhere near the Upper East Side where Charlotte and her family lives. Similarly inconvenient is the distance between Parliament Espresso and the City Museum of New York. These details are not to nitpick the show, which can rearrange locations as it sees fit. Rather it’s to help you maximize your inevitable And Just Like That... walking tour.\n\nSant Ambroeus, 1000 Madison Avenue\n\nI struggled to identify this location where Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte have brunch and discuss Carrie’s plans to sell the apartment she shared with Big. Thankfully, Karli Mullane, who runs the Instagram account Celeb Map, reached out over email to tell me she had identified it as the Upper East Side location of Sant Ambroeus, a Milanese-inspired restaurant and wine bar. Funny because Carrie soon shares a cocktail with her realtor at...\n\nSant Ambroeus, 265 Lafayette Street\n\nHaving befriended the outgoing, Samantha-esque Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), Carrie joins her at the Soho location of Sant Ambroeus, which is, in real life, a great place to spot models, actors, and the paparazzi who follow them. (Sarah Jessica Parker is a regular.) Here, the fast friends decide to split the cacio e pepe, even after Carrie rudely gives kudos to Seema for continuing to “put yourself out there” on dating apps. Luckily, pasta heals all wounds.\n\nBoutros, 185 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn\n\nMiranda meets up with her professor, Dr. Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman), at a very trendy-looking, dark restaurant with a vertical garden behind the bar and rustic lighting made from thick rope and Edison bulbs. I couldn’t figure out where it was, but I put it to the good readers of Eater and one delivered in a big way. Thanks to Elisa Zuritsky, a “frequent peruser of Eater” and freakin’ EXECUTIVE PRODUCER/WRITER on And Just Like That..., we now know it’s Boutros, a Middle Eastern and new American restaurant in Brooklyn Heights, conveniently located near Miranda’s brownstone. I hope Dr. Wallace either A.) picked the location or B.) lives around there, too, because that’s a long trek from Columbia. (They already share a train stop, though, so my guess is it’s a location of mutual convenience.)\n\nEpisode Five, “Tragically Hip”\n\nThere was plenty of action in the kitchen (that’s right, I’m talkin’ sex) during the fifth episode of And Just Like That, but only one scene in a restaurant.\n\nFreehold, 45 S 3rd St, Brooklyn\n\nFreehold is a cafe, bar, events space, and workspace in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It is also where Charlotte, Miranda, Carrie, and Anthony have brunch after Carrie learns she needs hip surgery. Later in the episode, Carrie pees in an empty Snapple bottle. Not a restaurant scene, but it does feel worth mentioning.\n\nEpisode Six, “Diwali”\n\nJoe Coffee Company, multiple locations throughout New York City\n\nWhen Miranda is fantasizing about having sex with Che Diaz — “Oh, yeah, yeah, I get that,” even Charlotte admits — she’s having a leisurely coffee with her professor-cum-friend (but not, like, cum friend, as we must clarify for shows like this) Dr. Nya Wallace. The pair walk through the park carrying cups of joe from the NYC coffee chain Joe Coffee Company. There’s a location conveniently located at Columbia University, though it’s been temporary closed probably because of the pandemic, which in the world of And Just Like That..., has all but disappeared. Good for them!\n\nBistrot Leo, 60 Thompson Street\n\nAnother big thank you to Karli Mullane of Celeb Map, who tipped us off to the location of the brunch spot — Bistrot Leo — where Carrie tells Miranda and Charlotte that she sold the apartment she shared with Big and bought a downtown apartment that looks like an Apple Store instead. And she doesn’t even like the new apartment! Money, like these picked-at meals in beautiful spaces, is wasted on the rich!\n\nLe Crocodile, 80 Wythe Avenue, Brooklyn\n\nNya has bonded with Miranda thanks to her own uncertainty about motherhood and Miranda’s no bullshit approach to the subject. Unfortunately, Miranda can’t help her when Nya and her husband meet up with another couple, who are expecting their third baby, for dinner at Le Crocodile, a restaurant inside the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Fun little bit of history: While in the show, Nya mentions that the restaurant was once a shoe factory, the actual Wythe was built in 1901 as cooperage, or barrel factory.\n\nEpisode Seven, “Sex and the Widow”\n\nMcGlorick Park, Russell Street &, Nassau Ave, Brooklyn\n\nMiranda runs into Nya and her hot husband at a greenmarket at McGlorick Park in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. Don’t rush out now — it’s a seasonal farmers market that doesn’t pick up again until spring. Still, the park is beautiful and you can always stop at the nearby outpost for Variety Coffee, which has gone from a singular coffee shop that opened in Williamsburg in 2009 to a citywide chain that has now appeared (on to-go cup branding, at least) multiple times in And Just Like That... Allow me one moment of sentimentality: I used to sit at the original Variety in 2009 and 2010 as an unemployed person, sending out resumes and freelance pitches to anywhere I could think of. I lusted after their hot baristas, got their coffee on the way to the train when I was a desperately hungover after a night of being a 24-year-old idiot, and became friendly acquaintances with the fellow regular who’d come in to watch wrestling on his laptop all day. And just like that... my lil’ roastery is all grown up and starring on HBO. I could cry!\n\nQuality Bistro, 120 West 55th Street\n\nThe women, now including Seema because a three-top throws off the entire balance of a table and a scene, meet for dinner at jewel-toned, pre-pandemic hot spot Quality Bistro. The restaurant, with its arched green-lit bar, look like a restaurant you’d find in the Emerald City of Oz’s arts district. Which is to say, very pretty.\n\nAfter turning in her book on widowhood, Carrie’s publisher suggests she go on one date for the purpose of writing an epilogue that would make her readership — which craves fun and frivolity over grief and husbands killed via Peleton — hopeful that she might find love again.\n\nLittle does she know that Seema, bored because of a real estate slump, has already been busy making a variety of online dating profiles for her. “You listed me?,” Carrie quips, a classic Bradshaw bon mot.\n\nAu Cheval, 33 Cortlandt Alley\n\nCarrie ends up going on first date at high-end burger outpost Au Cheval — once described as a “meaty, retrograde misfire” by Eater NY critic Ryan Sutton — with a math teacher from the school Charlotte’s daughters attend. The date starts out kind of nice. Similar to Carrie, this is his first date since losing his spouse, and the widow and widower decide to get blotto because life is short. This too ends up being a meaty misfire as it ends with them both blowing chunks on the street outside the restaurant. Now we’re talking! The next morning, Carrie considers the date a total misfire, hope be damned, but the math teacher isn’t so easily deterred by acts of public vomiting. He ends up bidding $1,050 for a date with Carrie during a school benefit auction and Carrie ends up being kind of happy about it. It’s the hopeful epilogue she needs to make it into Oprah’s Bookclub. More hopeful to me, however, is that a math teacher (even a private school math teacher!) could afford to bid a full grand to save the pride of the woman he barfed on.\n\nEpisode Eight, “Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered”\n\nThis episode begins at a pride rally in Foley Square in lower Manhattan. From a dais, Che does some “comedy” about being true to oneself then shouts out “our LGBTQ+ allies,” who are not so much interspersed with the crowd as they are...corralled in one area? From the queer section, Miranda spots her son Brady standing in the ally holding area and makes a run for it because she’s not out to him yet, nor has she told his father that she wants a divorce.\n\nTo smooth things over for bailing on Che’s act, she returns with iced coffees from her standby, Joe Coffee Company, but it doesn’t do the trick. Che finds out that Miranda has been using them to cheat on her husband, Steve, and, as a devotee of honesty, ends things. Welp, looks like Miranda should’ve brought coffees from one of the nearby — and superior — Australian cafes like Bluestone Lane or Black Fox. Or told Che that she left because their comedy is unbearable. Either option would’ve left things less bitter.\n\nThe Lobster Place, 75 9th Avenue, New York\n\nCarrie, Charlotte, and Miranda meet for a meal at the Lobster Place, located inside the Chelsea Market. While there, Miranda tells her friends that she’s going to ask her husband for a divorce so she can live a more honest life with Che, if they’ll have her. Charlotte then shares that her daughter Lily, now 15, was left emotionally and physically bruised after Charlotte slammed a door in her face because she walked in on her and husband Harry having oral sex. Carrie and Miranda are more shaken that Charlotte is still giving BJs in her 50s. Anyway, there’s always great conversations to be had over lobster rolls.\n\nFat Witch Bakery, 75 9th Avenue, New York\n\nAfter all that blowjob talk, Carrie and Miranda go to the Chelsea Market bakery Fat Witch so Carrie can buy her cool, young, jewelry-designing downstairs neighbor Lisette (Katerina Tannenbaum) some brownies. While there, she encourages Miranda to buy Steve some brownies, too, because it will make the divorce news slightly sweeter. That’s not going to help, Carrie! If anything, Steve will be turned off expensive, luxury brownies for life.\n\nLa Grande Boucherie, 145 W 53rd Street, New York\n\nCharlotte takes Lily out to lunch at this airy Parisian-style brasserie so that they can have a mature conversation on what Lily walked in and why Charlotte freaked out the way that she did. Unfortunately, the meal is interrupted before Lily can take a sip of her damn iced tea because Charlotte learns about her daughter’s finsta account where she’s recently posted a photo of herself posing sexily in workout gear. Charlotte panics, thinking her daughter is already beyond her guidance with regards to sexuality, and Lily walks out. But it all turns out okay! After some time at Auntie Carrie’s, Lily confides in Charlotte that she was just experimenting with expressing herself on a private Instagram account that’s only followed by her best girlfriends and someone’s younger brother named Connor. Maybe they can return to La Grande Boucherie for the rest of their lunch soon.\n\nI’ll note that Seema is again seen eating at Sant Ambroeus during this episode, but beyond this mention, I refuse to write about that restaurant in this space ever again.\n\nEpisode 9, “No Strings Attached”\n\nLafayette Grande Cafe and Bakery, 380 Lafayette Street\n\nThe penultimate And Just Like That... episode begins in a cozy, brown leather corner booth at Lafayette Grande Cafe and Bakery in the Bowery near Astor Place, a beautiful neighborhood with brick streets, fancy shops, and luxury hotels. Until recently, it was also the location of Manhattan’s last remaining Kmart, which you could enter directly from the subway which, along with the store’s mostly unstocked shelves, really led to that fifth circle of hell vibe that makes New York City feel like home.\n\nAt the restaurant, Charlotte reveals that she’s officially in menopause, a plot point that would’ve merited an entire episode in the halcyon Sex and the City days, as my viewing buddy Joanna Rothkopf pointed out. It’s also over this brunch that Miranda asks her friends to come help with a volunteer project at a women’s shelter in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. When Carrie, no fan of manual labor, offers a donation instead, Miranda replies, “You can’t be the white lady who just writes a check. If I can paint, you can paint!” Disagree, Miranda! Carrie is the exact type who should just write a check because she will — and does — get in the way. It takes her all day to paint one room and most of her time in the shelter is spent ruining her beautiful, highly impractical high heels and dissolving into histrionics when she accidentally drops her dead husband’s wedding ring (again, why wear it while painting!) down the drain. Had I been supervising that women’s shelter, I would’ve much preferred the money.\n\nEmpire Diner, 210 10th Avenue\n\nMiranda and Che share a meal at this chic, renovated railcar diner that you can find under the High Line in Chelsea. It’s here that Che encounters some fans — sorry, don’t believe it! — and Miranda boldly identifies herself as Che’s girlfriend. No friend to traditional relationships, Che’s not having it. A great time to move on from this character and the maniac Miranda has become, but no. Che-ck, please.\n\nDante West Village, 551 Hudson Street\n\nInitially deciding to give the math teacher who barfed at Au Cheval a second chance, Carrie meets him again in front of the West Village location of Dante, a very trendy cocktail lounge and restaurant. They don’t make it past the door, though, because Carrie has only arrived dressed to the nines in order to tell him she’s not actually ready to date again and wanted to tell him in person. Call him on the phone, Carrie! This poor man on a teacher’s salary took a yellow cab to see you and now you’re plopping him right back in one with no offer to cover the fare! Also, have these two considered the insane concept of friendship? Seems like a recent widow and widower could provide a lot of support for each other in a way that doesn’t involve mashing face or other body parts. Have a negroni! Talk about your lives! Or just keep having unromantic dates that end with awkward kisses. What the hell do I care.\n\nVeniero’s Pasticcheria & Caffé, 342 E 11th Street\n\nMiranda makes a fool of herself yet again by surprising Che with cookies from the Italian bakery Veniero’s, an East Village institution which has been open since late 1800s. Isn’t that incredible?! Even more incredible is none of Che’s neighbors yelling at the couple to shut the hell up as they have the loudest conversation about commitment and taking things slowly in the middle of the dang stairwell.\n\nTacos El Bronco, Makina Cafe, and Roberta’s\n\nWhen the caterers bail for Nya’s volunteer event — the one where they’re spending hours painting a single room of a women’s shelter — Charlotte’s friend Lisa Todd Wexley steps up by calling in a herd of food trucks from various beloved restaurants. There’s a truck for Tacos El Bronco, a Mexican restaurant with a brick-and-mortar at 4324 4th Avenue in Brooklyn; Makina Cafe, an Ethiopian-Eritrean eatery located at 36-47 30th Street in Queens; and Roberta’s, the pioneering Bushwick wood oven-pizza restaurant, dined at at least once by Beyoncé, located at 261 Moore Street in Brooklyn (but now with other locations across the city).\n\nNote: I’ve been unable to identify the meal Seema and Carrie share for Seema’s birthday (is it even real?), so if you happened to recognize the brightly-colored space, let me know at madeleine@eater.com! I did however immediately identify Seema’s hot new boyfriend Zed as Tony the Prada Guy from the season six episode of Sex and the City, “Lights, Camera, Relationship.”\n\nEpisode 10, Seeing the Light\n\nFirst of all, I want to end this journey with a big thank you to CelebMap’s Karli Mullane, who’s been a huge help and fun, unexpected partner in ID’ing these many restaurants. It’s thanks to her that I didn’t spend hours trying to figure out where Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte are eating at the beginning of the And Just Like That... finale because guess what? It’s an event space designed to look like a restaurant. The magic of production design!\n\nHer Name Was Carmen, 527 Broome Street\n\nMiranda goes to meet Che’s family at this Latin American restaurant in Soho and is surprised when Che gets up on stage to perform a rendition of the Beach Boy’s “California Girls” (they make it clear, though, that they’re actually doing the Van Halen version). This is their way of telling all their friends that they’re moving to California to produce a pilot, a surprise even to Miranda. May I clarify something? I actually really like the actor Sara Ramirez (“I don’t recognize myself in Che,” they recently told the New York Times, thank god), but this scene actually murdered me with second-hand embarrassment. I’m a ghost now, like Big, only instead of haunting a lamp on Carrie’s bookshelf, I’m forced to write and re-write this blog for eternity.\n\nPerry Street, 176 Perry Street\n\nCarrie meets Big’s brother Richard at this Jean-Gorges restaurant off the West Side Highway in Greenwich village. Over this four-dollar-sign lunch, Richard asks what’s going on with Big’s ashes and suggests Carrie inters them at the family crypt in Connecticut where one day, if she’s interested, there’d be room for her to join him.\n\nLe Cafe de L’epoque, 2 Rue du Bouloi, Paris, France\n\nIn a dream, Carrie sees herself in Paris, sitting in front of this brasserie in the 1st arrondissement of Paris, which is but a brief stroll from the Louvre and Domaine National du Palais-Royal. This, we can presume, is where Big should have reappeared had all traces of Chris Noth not been erased from the show following multiple accusations of sexual assault against the actor. In fact, they even erased any mention of him from And Just Like That...The Documentary, the surprisingly delightful end point to this ellipses of a series. Turns out, however, that the real drama of the Paris restaurant scene centered around a hat that was beloved by Sarah Jessica Parker and costume designer Molly Rogers, but axed from the scene by showrunner Michael Patrick King. (Rogers even wrote an angry poem about it!)\n\nAnyway, it’s in this dream that Carrie realizes she wants to bring Big’s ashes to Paris, the city where they reunited for good, but also where she got slapped by Petrovsky? And where Big met Natasha, who he married before Carrie and divorced because he and Carrie had an affair? All I’m trying to say is there are better choices (say Napa or Central Park), but it’s not my show and if it was, I would have let SJP keep her Paris hat.\n\nAnd just like that...we’ve reached the end of And Just Like That..."
