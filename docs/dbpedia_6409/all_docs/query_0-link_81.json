He will direct and co-produce the project, titled Everything is Copy, which was a lesson that her mother, also a self-reflective screenwriter, had taught her early on.\n\nNick Hooker will join Bernstein as a co-director, while Matt Parker and Carly Hugo (a producer on HBO’s 2011 Hot Coffee doc) are attached as producers on the effort set up at HBO Documentary Films. Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, who won both an Emmy and Peabody award for 9/11, is on board as an executive producer. Carter previously teamed with HBO on His Way, a documentary centered on legendary producer Jerry Weintraub."
