        "text": "While the plan is only for 2021 (for now), it could have major and permanent ramifications for Hollywood.\n\nThe theatrical window, which has typically been 75 days before a movie can debut on digital or streaming, has shortened during the pandemic. Some movies have skipped theaters entirely this year for video-on-demand and streaming services, and Universal Pictures has struck deals with several major chains to dramatically shorten the window for future releases.\n\nBut the announcement from Warner Bros. is a big evolution in these strategies. The studio had committed to theaters just three months ago when it debuted Christopher Nolan's \"Tenet\" in cinemas. The movie disappointed at the US box office, though, with $57 million (it earned more than $350 million globally).\n\nREAD MORE IN OUR EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: The exec in charge of HBO Max breaks down the Hollywood-shaking decision to release all 2021 Warner Bros. movies to streaming and theaters simultaneously: 'Predictability is at a premium'\n\nThis move is a reflection of how big an influence the coronavirus pandemic has had on movie studios, which have experimented with alternative release strategies to theaters. Major chains like Regal and Cineworld are closed in the US and UK, and it's unclear when they'll reopen.\n\nTheater stocks took a nosedive on Thursday after the announcement. AMC, the largest theater chain, was down 8% after the announcement.\n\nHowever, studios make most of their box-office revenue internationally, and Warner Bros. movies will release exclusively in theaters outside the US as intended next year. In 2019, the studio earned $2.85 billion from international markets compared with $1.58 billion domestically.\n\nThe move is also a sign that WarnerMedia is looking to boost subscribers for HBO Max, which has struggled to convert those who are already HBO customers.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe service has yet to strike a deal with Roku, one of the largest streaming-distribution platforms, and Variety's Todd Spangler tweeted on Thursday that the strategy could pressure Roku into making a deal.\n\nWarnerMedia has undergone a heavy shake-up this year under its new CEO, Jason Kilar, that includes hundreds of layoffs and a focus on its streaming business. In August, after WarnerMedia Entertainment and Direct-To-Consumer Chairman Bob Greenblatt and HBO Max Chief Content Officer Kevin Reilly were axed, Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff was elevated to oversee all film, TV, network, and streaming divisions.\n\nTo read a full breakdown of the logic behind the Warner Bros. release strategy, here's BI's exclusive interview with the exec in charge of HBO Max.\n\nAre you a current or former WarnerMedia employee with more to share?
