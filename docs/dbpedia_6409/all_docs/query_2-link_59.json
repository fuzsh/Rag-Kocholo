        "text": "As impressive as what’s on the list of 100 best HBO and MAX movies, what’s been left off is almost as eye-opening. Because if the movie’s on the MAX streaming service (featuring a vast library of HBO, Warner Bros, DC, Studio Ghibli, Discovery, and Looney Tunes titles) but rates below 90% on the Tomatometer, it’s not even within sniffing distance of making the cut.\n\nSo what you get is movies of MAX acclaim, including DC superhero blockbusters (Superman, The Dark Knight), Studio Ghibli animation masterpieces (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away), the Harry Potter series, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and a fair shake of James Bond. In addition, check out the filmographies of long-associated WB directors, like Stanley Kubrick, Christopher Nolan, Clint Eastwood, and Martin Scorsese.\n\nPlus, there’s so much from the TCM vault you can save yourself the money on film school. You can start at the beginning with the silent era (City Lights, Battleship Potemkin), move into color and musicals (The Wizard of Oz, Singin’ in the Rain), hit up French New Wave (The 400 Blows, Breathless) and Italian neo-realism (Open City, Bicycle Thieves), and dive into post-World War II international golden age (Seven Samurai, Tokyo Story, Pather Panchali).\n\nRead on for the 100 best MAX movies!
