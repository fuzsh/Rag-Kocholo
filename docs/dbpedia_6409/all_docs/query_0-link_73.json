No matter how many phone calls Ari and Eric make, they're not able to get a meeting between Vince and James Cameron, who is helming the aquatic epic. Complicating matters is Emily, who has no real love for either Ari or E, and is now working for Cameron. Eventually, Cameron agrees to screen Queens Boulevard to see if Vince will be right for the role, but Walsh refuses to show the film to anybody before its premiere at Sundance.

Ari lies to Eric, claiming that James Cameron is willing to drop Vince from the project if the actor doesn't focus on the film. But the charade is exposed, and Eric turns the tables by sending Ari to Napa on a revenge-motivated wild goose chase. After Eric's car is stolen, a demo CD is left behind by the perps. The crew loves the tunes on the CD, and Turtle tracks down the artist, signing him to a management deal.</p></div>\n\nExodus\n\nVince is blinded by love, and Eric gets cozy with Sloan. Meanwhile, Ari gets shot down in the war room.\n\nThe Abyss\n\nVince's despondent mood forces Eric to consider fending for himself.\n\nAquamom\n\nVince's plan to bring a \"premiere-worthy\" date to the Aquaman premiere fails, but Eric bails him out with a Plan B.\n\nOne Day in the Valley\n\nA series of L.A. blackouts threatens 'Aquaman''s opening weekend numbers.\n\nDominated\n\nVince welcomes a long-lost friend from back home into the entourage, sending panic through the ranks.\n\nGuys and Doll\n\nWith \"Aquaman\" a megahit, Vince's dream project, \"Medellin,\" is now within reach.\n\nCrash and Burn\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by</b> Patty Jenkins<br><b>Written by</b> Brian Burns</p><p>With help from Ari and Eric, Vince puts the heat on the studio to delay &quot;Aquaman 2&quot; so he can film his dream project, &quot;Medellin.&quot; They manage to buy a 65-day window, but &quot;Medellin&quot; director Paul Haggis can't see himself chopping his script or trimming the shooting schedule. Eric comes up with a solution, convincing the director to shoot part of the script after Aquaman, and everyone's happy. Vince sets up a meeting with the head of Warner Brothers to tell him the good news.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ari is still preoccupied with his daughter's burgeoning romance with Max. He undermines one of his own kid clients, recommending Max to Penny Marshall as the lead for her tween terror film shooting in Kazakhstan. Turtle requests a sit down with Ari when Saigon starts getting heavy play on the radio and the calls from labels come rolling in. When Drama calls &quot;shotgun&quot; on Turtle's lunch with Ari, he finally gets Mr. Gold Standard to agree to represent him.</p><p>They're all in for a surprise when Vince meets with the studio head, who has changed his mind on &quot;Medellin&quot; -- he can't have Aquaman &quot;doing three hours of blow on every multiplex in the country.&quot; Beside himself, Vince demands $20 million to do the sequel. &quot;What'd I miss?&quot; Ari asks when he arrives late for the dinner.</p></div>\n\nThree's Company\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by</b> Ken Whittingham<br><b>Written by</b> Lisa Alden</p><p>The showdown between Vince and the studio intensifies over Aquaman 2 vs. Medellin, and Ari is popping every vein to bring the two sides together. Adding to his aggravation, his prize client refuses to talk to him until he lands Johnny Drama a role -- a tall order considering Drama's current lack of star power.</p><p>Eric gets the offer of a lifetime when Sloan suggests they get together with her gorgeous friend Tori for a threesome. Before any action ensues, Sloan lays down some ground rules for her boyfriend, making it clear she's not willing to share all of him. After the trio spends a night together, Eric wakes up to find himself spooning Tori, which sends Eric into a tailspin -- Tori has really gotten under his skin.</p><p>The studio ups the ante for Vince and plays hardball with Ari, threatening to shut off access to their projects for all of his clients if he fails to deliver &quot;the pretty boy.&quot; A last minute audition for Drama (procured by Lloyd) finally opens the lines of communication with Vince a little too late, Ari delivers news Vince doesn't want to hear: Medellin is off the table, the role has gone to Benicio Del Toro. After Ari convinces him he has no choice, Vince finally agrees to do Aquaman 2 - for the original offer, on principle - and he never wants to work with the studio again afterwards. But when Vince fails to show for a breakfast with the studio chief the next day, the offer is rescinded. They're dumping him from A2, leaving everybody's future in doubt.</p></div>\n\nStrange Days\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by</b> Mark Mylod<br><b>Written by</b> Marc Abrams &amp; Michael Benson</p><p>E is still sweating the fact that he woke up cuddling with Tori rather than Sloan during their threesome. To try and ease his conscience, he tracks down Tori at her hotel to apologize, but in doing so manages to creep her out even more.</p><p>Ari's break from Terrance is nearly complete when he negotiates an $11 million severance package - on a handshake. He quickly goes scouting for colossal office space (for what will be the biggest agency in LA, he tells his wife), and is spotted by former co-worker (and Terrance stooge) Adam Davies.</p><p>Eric can't get Tori out of his mind, and he has to see her again at the charity auction Sloan is organizing. While Sloan is busy auctioning off Vince to the highest bidder (a septuagenarian), the prize movie star is busy in the coatroom with a cocktail waitress, and Tori is suggesting another three-way to Eric (no rules this time, she says, if he can convince Sloan). Queasy with nerves, Eric ends up fleeing the party. And as Sloan's father hobnobs, Adam Davies approaches Ari with an offer: he wants a partnership and a million-dollar contract at his Ari's new agency, or tell Terrance all about Ari's big plans. Realizing he's over a barrel, Ari agrees to take him on.</p><p>Tori ends up crashing on Sloan's couch for one more night, keeping Eric up until he gets the chance to talk to her one final time. She doesn't deny an attraction, but suggests that Eric not let a girl like Sloan slip away.</p></div>\n\nThe Release\n\nThe guys learn that \"Queens Boulevard\" is getting a wide release; Ari makes a deal with the Five Families.\n\nVegas Baby, Vegas!\n\nThe guys head to Vegas for a much-needed break and a $100K promo appearance for Vince.\n\nI Wanna Be Sedated\n\nTurtle encounters a setback in his record-deal signing. Eric finds the perfect project for Vince.\n\nWhat About Bob?\n\nEric, Ari and Bob Ryan pitch The Ramones project to the studios. Turtle covets some limited-edition sneakers. Drama suffers from nerves.\n\nSorry, Ari\n\nVince and the guys evaluate new opportunities while Ari tries to save The Ramones film.\n\nLess Than 30\n\nVince's new agent makes her first pitch. Ari lobbies for a lunch. Turtle plans Vince's birthday blowout.\n\nDog Day Afternoon\n\n<div class='episode-body-left-aligned' style='text-align: left'><p><b>Directed by</b> Mark Mylod<br><b>Written by</b> Doug Ellin &amp; Rob Weiss</p><p>Amanda is pushing Vince for an answer on the Sam Mendes project, but Vince seems more concerned about his upcoming couples trip to Wine Country with Eric and Sloan. Unfortunately, E and Sloan didn't know that Vince was planning on coming along on the excursion, so the pair <g class=\"gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"21\" data-gr-id=\"21\">concoct</g> a plan to go away without Vince.</p><p>In anticipation of having the house to themselves, Drama and Turtle bring Ahnold to a dog park to try and pick up some girls of their own. The plan works well at first, as the pair find two women that have a Rott and soon all six are hooking up poolside. Unfortunately, Ahnold's &quot;date&quot; doesn't go that well, as he ends up sending the female Rott to the vet in a fight over a piece of meat. The dog ends up okay, and the party goes back to the girls' apartment. But Drama and Turtle end up leaving unsatisfied when Turtle loses it on his date after she suggests that Ahnold should be neutered.</p><p>Ari has the opportunity to sign Jay Lester, an A-list writer known as &quot;The Syndication Machine.&quot; To help move the deal along, Ari subtly offers up Lloyd to Lester, a notoriously promiscuous queen. Lloyd is soon dispatched to a club to &quot;personally&quot; deliver the agency papers. Much to his own surprise, Ari has a rare moment of <g class=\"gr_ gr_22 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"22\" data-gr-id=\"22\">conscience,</g> and drives into the heart of Boys Town to rescue Lloyd -- at the cost of inking the writer.</p><p>Eric's and Sloan's plan to get away alone appears doomed, as Vince seems to have an answer for every excuse that they provide. Eventually, E mans up and tells Vince the truth, so Vince packs up Turtle and Drama and takes off for Cabo for some Spring Break fun.</p></div>\n\nManic Monday\n\nAmanda makes Vince an offer he can't refuse.

When he gets back to the house, E tells the guys that he and Anna had &quot;a moment&quot; when she gave him her phone number – too bad the digits turn out to be off the mark. Turtle suffers a disappointment as well, announcing that his favorite strain of marijuana has gone extinct. Vince promises to share his stash of the dwindling weed, which Turtle nearly loses during a traffic stop later that afternoon as he returns from the supermarket with some random hotties. E manages to track down his own lady, using a star map to find Anna's house and finally acquiring her insurance info. He drives her to a meeting – her car fared worse than his in the accident – and when she insists on his opinion about a script she's attached herself to, E wins her over with an honest assessment of its flaws.</p><p>At the Gold house, Ari's spotlighting a few flaws doesn't go over so well. A producer from 'The Young and the Restless' calls to ask Mrs. Ari to reprise her role as Kendall Scott, and Ari tries to dissuade her by warning, &quot;You left the show when you were 25, and they shoot in High Def now.&quot; Karma comes back around to bite him, though, when he learns his wife will be making out with a hot young Latino named Javier on the show. Ari bribes the young actor with a future in film, but when Javier shies away from kissing Mrs. Ari, she seizes him in a lip-lock. Later, she explains to Ari that all she really wanted was for him to think she's still sexy. &quot;You're the beautiful mother of my children,&quot; he tells her as he throws her on the bed.</p><p>E thinks he's en route to some star-studded romance himself when Anna calls to set a dinner date. He meets her, but it turns out she already has a boyfriend and wants to hire E as her manager. When E gets back to the house, Drama taunts him for thinking he had a shot with a celebrity, and all Vince can say is, &quot;She wants you to be her manager? Interesting...&quot;</p></div>\n\nSnow Job\n\nAri scrambles to keep Billy's script green-lit. Eric manages a new client -- and her boyfriend.\n\nNo Cannes Do\n\nThe guys' trip to Cannes is delayed.

But when E calls Ari, he informs him Gus isn't a fan; the director even refuses to have Vince audition. Undeterred, Eric goes to Gus's office to try and get Vince a shot. Meanwhile, Vince's mom surprises him with a welcome home party and he and the guys catch up with friends and family. Drama continues to give Turtle a hard time about the mysterious calls he's getting, but Turtle refuses to say anything until Drama grabs the phone away and Jamie-Lynn comes clean. After waiting all day, E finally catches Gus and convinces him to watch Vince's footage from 'Smokejumpers.' Ari balks, but manages to get the footage to Gus, who calls E and Vince, impressed, but not enough to cast him. At the end of his rope, Vince fires E, blaming him for his career failures. Furious, Eric heads back to LA.
