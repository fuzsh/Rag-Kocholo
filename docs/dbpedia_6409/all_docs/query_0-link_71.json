        "text": "Author and Redlands native James Fallows is happy with HBO’s adaptation of his book “Our Towns: A 100,000-Mile Journey into the Heart of America,” which he researched and wrote with his wife Deborah Fallows.\n\nThe documentary, which features a segment on the Inland Empire, debuts on the cable channel on Tuesday, April 13, and will also be available as streaming video on HBO Max.\n\n“I’m a person just of the print world,” Fallows said in a phone interview. “I had no idea what it would look like to create a film about our themes. Once my wife Deb and saw it we said, ‘Of course, that’s what it would be.’”\n\nThe Fallows spent five years researching their book visiting towns across the nation for their book. The book was published in 2018, and after HBO acquired the rights they hit the road again for 100 days with filmmakers Steven Ascher and Jeanne Jordan.\n\n“We were astonished and grateful for the beauty of how they reimagined this message in a completely different medium,” he said.\n\nHe said the film “talks about the conjoined histories of Redlands, San Bernardino and Riverside.”\n\n“The Inland Empire is a place that people don’t know,” he says that the start of the nearly 20-minute segment. It includes a visit to Project Fighting Chance, a youth outreach program in San Bernardino; Norton Air Reserve Base; an orange packing plant at Redlands Foothill Groves; a homeless survey in San Bernardino County; Cajon High School in San Bernardino; a visit to the Redlands campus of tech company Esri; and the role of warehouses to the local and national economies.\n\nAlert viewers can catch glimpses of the 210 Freeway, a Martin Luther King Day march in Riverside; signage for Taco Joe’s Mexican Restaurant; and people sipping drinks at Augie’s Coffee, the Redlands chain that went out of business last year.\n\nIn addition to the Inland Empire, the documentary includes segments in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Columbus, Mississippi; Eastport, Maine; Charleston, West Virginia; and Bend, Oregon.\n\nShooting was completed shortly before the novel coronavirus lockdown in March 2020.\n\nSome Inland residents who are featured in the film got to preview it last weekend, and he said they shared his impressions that the film is beautiful and “the face of America it presents that people aren’t generally aware of.”\n\nFallows is a staff writer for The Atlantic and former editor of U.S. News & World Report. He was a speech writer for President Jimmy Carter. His entry into the world of journalism began as a paperboy for the Redlands Daily Facts, and he said he was also a sports correspondent when he was a student at Cope Middle School.\n\n“Our Towns”\n\nHBO: Airs 6 and 9 p.m. Tuesday, April 13 on HBO and HBO HD\n\nFilmmakers: westcityfilms.com\n\nBook: ourtownsbook.com"
