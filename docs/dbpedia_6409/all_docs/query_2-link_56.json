        "text": "When HBO Max debuts on May 27, it will launch with original content starring Anna Kendrick, the cast of Sesame Street, and even a new version of the Looney Tunes. But while there are plans for a greater volume of original content to come later this year (including new movies from Seth Rogen and Steven Soderbergh), the biggest draw of HBO Max at the moment is its vast library of legacy content, spanning the Warner Bros. archives of film and television production across decades. Ahead, the best movies and shows to watch on HBO Max—from Friends to North by Northwest.\n\nClassics Curated by TCM\n\nCinephiles who long for the days of FilmStruck, which WarnerMedia shut down in 2018, will be pleased to learn that HBO Max is loaded with some of the best films of all time, including 2001: A Space Odyssey, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Singin’ in the Rain, and The Wizard of Oz, among many others. New HBO Max subscribers would be wise to start with that quintet of transformational Hollywood classics—and here are some other recommendations to tackle next.\n\nBonnie and Clyde: “They’re young. They’re in love. And they kill people.” It’s fairly easy to draw a line connecting filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, Kathryn Bigelow, and Melina Matsoukas back to Arthur Penn and his 1967 classic. As Dave Kehr wrote in his New York Times obituary for the Oscar-nominated director, movies like Taxi Driver and The Godfather might not even exist without Penn’s violent and sexy take on the infamous bank-robbing duo as a precedent setter. Bonnie and Clyde cemented Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as stars and introduced an audience desperate for something new to something beyond their wildest expectations. How good is Bonnie and Clyde? Fifty-three years later, it still feels as vital and watchable as any modern thriller.\n\nNorth by Northwest: Cineastes can surely quibble about which Alfred Hitchcock movie was the master of suspense’s best, but there should be no argument about which is his most entertaining. North by Northwest is a blast from the jump, a relentless chase that set the template for Hollywood blockbusters for decades to come.\n\nThe 400 Blows: Is there really anything left to write about The 400 Blows? Perhaps not, but it’s never a bad time to remember the iconic theme, which is as haunting and memorable even after 400 listens.\n\nThe Wild Bunch: Whatever tricks Tarantino didn’t learn from Bonnie and Clyde, he borrowed from Sam Peckinpah. The Wild Bunch is a savage, violent, nihilistic deconstruction of the Western that includes enough antiheroes to populate a common AMC series. It remains shockingly relevant and totally awesome.\n\nModern Movies\n\nFortunately, recent Warner Bros. history is about more than the debate over the Snyder Cut. HBO Max launched with a number of the studio’s blockbusters from the ’80s, ’90s, ’00s, and today, including every Harry Potter movie, the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, and the Lord of the Rings films, as well as numerous third-party titles. It’s a flashy crop of four-quadrant hits, but don’t sleep on these underappreciated gems, either.\n\nThe Devil’s Advocate: Consider the run Al Pacino went on between 1993 and 1999, after winning his long-overdue Academy Award for Scent of a Woman: Carlito’s Way, Heat, City Hall, Donnie Brasco, The Devil’s Advocate, The Insider, Any Given Sunday. No one would confuse those seven movies with The Godfather, but to borrow his Oscar-winning catchphrase: hoo-ah, what a lineup. The Devil’s Advocate is by far the silliest entry on this list, which also makes it the most fun. Pacino is unhinged in the Taylor Hackford thriller about the literal devil (Pacino) who tries to corrupt his son (Keanu Reeves) into fathering the antichrist. A third-act soliloquy about the difference between God and himself is better than the entirety of Scent of a Woman.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors: For viewers of a certain age, there was a time in the 1980s when Rick Moranis seemed like maybe the most famous actor this side of Harrison Ford. Between 1983 and 1990, Moranis starred in cable classics such as Strange Brew, Ghostbusters and its sequel, Brewster’s Millions, Club Paradise, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and My Blue Heaven. But his best performance might be in Frank Oz’s still-wonderful adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors. He’s the perfect Seymour, and his awkward chemistry with Ellen Greene remains the kind of ineffable delight that should make the producers of a potential remake decidedly nervous.\n\nMetropolitan: The debut film from writer-director Whit Stillman established the filmmaker as the foremost chronicler of white bourgeois urban dwellers. But the reason Metropolitan still works so well to this day is that Stillman was inspired by classic literature as well as his own experiences. “I had such a hard time writing the screenplay for my first film. So I’d stop to take a break and read Pride and Prejudice. I’d just read a couple of pages to sort of cleanse the palate. And be inspired. So Jane Austen’s really important for Metropolitan,” he once said.\n\nThat Thing You Do!: After Adam Schlesinger died earlier this year due to complications of COVID-19, there was a renewed interest in Tom Hanks’s directorial debut. It remains a total gem, a delightful Behind the Music–esque comedy that pranks Hanks could have pivoted toward becoming a deft comic filmmaker in the mode of Penny Marshall, if he wanted to. But the highlight, of course, is Schlesinger’s title song, an earworm that stands the test of time.\n\nThe Player: Was The Player ahead of its time? Look no further than the opening scene, which basically predicted the next 30 years of Hollywood: The late Buck Henry pitches a sequel to The Graduate starring Dustin Hoffman, Katharine Ross, and Anne Bancroft, with Julia Roberts as the new graduate. Movies, now more than ever.\n\nThree Kings: The fights between George Clooney and David O. Russell are the stuff of ’90s Hollywood legend, but despite the animosity between the film’s star and director, Three Kings remains top entertainment and a throwback to the kind of ’90s movies Hollywood doesn’t make anymore. Bonus points to Russell for giving major roles to Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and especially Spike Jonze at a time when studios were still unsure what to do with those guys.\n\nUs: It feels like Jordan Peele’s follow-up to Get Out was released 14 years ago, not merely 14 months ago. But despite mixed reviews at the time, Us remains a thrilling almost-masterpiece that seems only certain to grow in esteem with age.\n\nVarsity Blues: If an itch for ’90s nostalgia remains after The Last Dance, there’s always Varsity Blues, a sports movie filtered through Total Request Live and starring James Van Der Beek, Paul Walker, and Scott Caan.\n\nTV Shows\n\nSubscribers to HBO Max have access to every episode of Game of Thrones, The Wire, The Sopranos, Big Little Lies, Sex and the City, Barry, and Curb Your Enthusiasm, among other HBO classics. The service also features episodes of The O.C., South Park, The Big Bang Theory, and Friends. Plenty of options, for sure—but here are three episodes to tackle upfront, if you need a more targeted approach. For more on the best individual episodes of HBO series to watch, head here.\n\nFriends, “The One Where Everybody Finds Out” (Season five, episode 14): Routinely cited as one of the best episodes of the long-running NBC comedy, this one focuses on the group slowly realizing Monica and Chandler (Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry) are together.\n\nThe O.C., “The O.Sea” (Season two, episode 23): Between August of 2003 and May 12, 2005, when this episode made its debut, Fox aired 49 episodes of The O.C. So viewers should forgive Josh Schwartz and his collaborators for running through story lines and plots with a fire reserved usually for magnesium. But despite the overindulgence, season two of the teen soap was better than it is remembered to be, especially this penultimate episode—which concludes with a prom, a death, and the first use of Coldplay’s “Fix You” on television. Sorry, Aaron Sorkin.\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, “Papa’s Got a Brand New Excuse” (Season four, Episode 24): The best performance of Will Smith’s career? It’s arguably this episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, in which Smith has an emotional breakdown after his onscreen father (played by Ben Vereen) walks out on him again. Even now, it inspires waterworks.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— The Week the Cameras Stopped: TV in the COVID-19 Era\n\n— Why Natalie Wood’s Daughter Is Confronting Robert Wagner About Wood’s Death\n\n— Inside Rock Hudson’s Real-Life Relationship With Agent Henry Wilson\n\n— How The Mandalorian Fought to Keep Baby Yoda From Being Too Cute\n\n— A First Look at Charlize Theron’s Immortal Warrior in The Old Guard\n\n— Back to the Future, Uncut Gems, and More New Titles on Netflix This Month\n\n— From the Archive: How Rock Hudson and Doris Day Helped Define the Romantic Comedy\n\nLooking for more?
