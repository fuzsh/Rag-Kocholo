        "text": "A24 has inked a multi-year streaming deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to bring its movies exclusively to HBO, Max, and Cinemax.\n\nThe company announced in a press release Wednesday that the popular indie film studio will be bringing a slate of its recent movies to the WBD platforms after the conclusion of their theatrical run. Those films include Sofia Coppola-directed Elvis Presley biopic Priscilla; the Nicolas Cage-led comedy Dream Scenario; The Iron Claw (releasing December 22), based on the true story of the Von Erich brothers (played by Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White), who made history in the world of professional wrestling in the 1980s; Dicks: The Musical; Love Lies Bleeding; The Zone of Interest; and Stop Making Sense, the 2023 rerelease of Jonathan Demme's Talking Heads concert film.\n\nA24 also signed an extension to the licensing deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to bring past movies from A24's library to Max, HBO, and Cinemax. The extension involves over 100 titles over the term of the agreement, including Academy Award-winner Everything Everywhere All At Once, the Adam Sandler-led crime thriller Uncut Gems, The Whale, and Past Lives.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\n“Continuing our relationship with A24 to bring award-winning movies alongside recent fan favorites to subscribers adds incredible value to the HBO and Max value proposition,” Royce Battleman, EVP of content acquisitions at Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement. “The diverse range of stories that come from the A24 pipeline make this partnership so impactful for our audience.”\n\nA24's one-year licensing deal with Warner Bros. Discovery comes after its agreement with Showtime expired earlier this year. The deal was signed in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, A24 is producing a biopic about Twitter/X CEO Elon Musk, which is being helmed by Black Swan and The Whale director Darren Aronofsky. We'll see how that goes.\n\nCristina Alexander is a freelance writer for IGN. To paraphrase Calvin Harris, she wears her love for Sonic the Hedgehog on her sleeve like a big deal.
