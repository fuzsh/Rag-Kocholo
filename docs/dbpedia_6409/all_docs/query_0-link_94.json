Highlights from our chat:John Lopez: So what’s it like to have the camera turned on you and have your whole life front and center stage?\n\nJerry Weintraub: There are crazy feelings going on in my life. When I decided to do the book, it was very cathartic and difficult, because when you’re doing it about yourself, you have to let all the warts hang out. When they suggested a film, I was hesitant—seeing yourself up on the big screen, starring in a movie that’s all about you. There’s a part of you that doesn’t want to do that. Even though I’m recognized, there’s still a modicum of privacy in my life; now there won’t be. That was the difficult part, getting over that hump. The rest was fun because, for the first time on a film, I didn’t have to produce it! I didn’t have to worry about the money, about the crew. I didn’t have to worry about what time they had lunch.\n\nI have to admit, watching the documentary, it’s really easy to just listen to you talk.\n\nThe reason the film works so well, and it really does work, is [director Doug McGrath] asked everybody the same questions. Somebody starts the story, somebody picks it up in the middle, and somebody gets it to the end. If the stories weren’t true and they hadn’t really happened, you couldn’t do that. That’s really the strength of the film, and he did a brilliant job. I’m good at storytelling; I do it all the time, TV shows, speeches and commencement addresses—people like the way I talk. That wasn’t hard for me.\n\nSo, what’s your secret for telling a good story?\n\nI don’t know, timing? I don’t ever write anything down. When I do a speech, I speak from the heart, I speak directly to people. I don’t speak down to anybody. I’m not trying to teach anybody; I just talk and it works. Also, I’ve had a fascinating life—I’ve got a lot to talk about.\n\nI imagine it helps to have good stories about everyone.\n\nYes. When I go on Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy Fallon or Good Morning America, all they have to do is throw out a name and I’m done. I’m the easiest interviewee in the world.\n\nDo you have any good stories for us? For example, I loved that story in the film about George Clooney pranking you. You ever get him back?\n\nMany, many times. We all do that to each other. [On the Ocean movies,] he once stole a shirt of mine. It was right after I had prostate cancer, and I’d been in the hospital. He stole this gold shirt—it was like a $5,000 shirt, very expensive! Anyway, he didn’t like it. He thought it was too “loud.” So he went into my closet at the Bellagio, took my shirt, and painted a penis on the back. Then he had every actor sign the shirt. I still have it. The shirt’s worth a fortune—everybody’s name is on that shirt! He sent it to me for my birthday or something. I opened this box with this big ribbon, and there was the shirt. At the time I was on the Warner lot, and so was he, so I got in my golf cart, I drove over to his office, I took a golf club, and I destroyed his office. He was huddled in the corner, holding his face. The people who were working for him were so frightened—they didn’t know what to do! I got him back.\n\nWow, George Clooney met his match. The documentary kind of paints you as the last of your kind—do you think there’s an Old Hollywood ethos that’s quickly fading?\n\nI think it’s already gone, personally. I’m from Old Hollywood; I’ve been around this town for 50 years. My friends were Cary Grant, Gene Kelly, Jimmy Stewart, Gregory Peck, Kirk Douglas. That’s who used to hang at my house. That became Clooney and Pitt and Damon and Stallone and Willis. It went from Eva Gardner to Julia Roberts. I don’t know what Hollywood is anymore. The entrepreneurs are gone—there’s some left. The studios and networks are all owned by big corporate. You don’t have the General Sarnoffs, the Bill Paleys, and the Leonard Goldensons, the Jack Warners and the Louis Mayers. It’s a different breed now. When someone spends money now to do a movie with special effects, they spend $150 to $200 million, and another $100 million on prints and advertising. But it’s not their money; it’s the stockholders’ money. It’s a different game.\n\nDoes that change the types of stories and films that can get made?\n\nAbsolutely, no question about it. The thing that disturbs me most about today’s filmmaking is that technology is now so fast that we don’t think enough. If you were a writer years ago, you wrote on a typewriter. Then, you went back and read the five pages you wrote, and decided to change it or not change it. When we’d edit a movie, we used to change a scene, send it out to the lab. We had 48 to 72 hours before it came back and we looked at it. Now it’s instantaneous. Everything’s instantaneous in this world. Everybody wants immediate satisfaction—premature ejaculation, I call it. That’s what’s really changed. Everything is quick, quick, quick. We need it right it away! I enjoy working with creative people that take their time about what they’re doing, think it through, and make it the best piece of work they can. Even though we’re in show business, it is an art form, and you just can’t throw it out and slap it against the wall.\n\nYou have to take the time and care to cultivate, make it big, make it an event.\n\nI make an event out of everything I do. But it doesn’t just happen. It’s not a thing that happens in an instant and you just walk away. There’s not an event or anything I’ve done in my career—the shows I did, the movies I did, the shows I produced on Broadway—that I don’t have my handprints all over and take full responsibility for. As Brad [Pitt] said, he does a really big show, he can’t help himself."
