        "text": "Warner Bros. Discovery will be exclusive the home to A24‘s upcoming slate.\n\nThe conglomerate and the indie studio announced a multiyear pay-1 U.S. output deal that will bring the studio and distributor’s theatrical film slate exclusively to Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO and Cinemax, as well as streaming service Max.\n\nIn addition to newer and upcoming films like Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla, Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest and Nicolas Cage starrer Dream Scenario, the deal will cover titles from A24’s library, including best picture winner Everything Everywhere All at Once, Brendan Fraser starrer The Whale and the Safdies’ Uncut Gems.\n\nOther 2024 releases available under the deal will be Dicks: The Musical, the Talking Heads concert film Stop Making Sense (2023) and The Iron Claw, with other upcoming titles including Kristen Stewart bodybuilder love story Love Lies Bleeding and Alex Garland’s action film Civil War.\n\nToday’s announcement noted that between the existing library and upcoming A24 films, Warner Bros. Discovery audiences “will have access to more than one hundred A24 titles over the term of the agreement.”\n\nThe latest output deal builds on a previous pact between WBD and A24 that saw over two dozen A24 titles stream on Max (then HBO Max) beginning in August 2022.\n\nA24 previously had an output deal with Showtime that saw A24 features air on Showtime channels, as well as its sister streaming platforms. That pact, which was signed in 2019, covered theatrical releases through Nov. 1, 2022.\n\n“Continuing our relationship with A24 to bring award-winning movies alongside recent fan favorites to subscribers adds incredible value to the HBO and Max value proposition,” said Royce Battleman, exec vp content acquisitions, Warner Bros. Discovery. “The diverse range of stories that come from the A24 pipeline make this partnership so impactful for our audience.”"
