        "text": "Category: Uncategorized\n\nHBO’S “HUNG” TO FILM AT BIRMINGHAM BIGGBY COFFEE!\n\nStore Offers Free Coffee and other Treats, While Inside is Closed for Filming\n\nBIRMINGHAM, MICH., May 31, 2011 – Drum roll please! The HBO hit comedy-drama, “HUNG” has announced it will film an episode at BIGGBY COFFEE of Birmingham (112 Old South Woodward Ave.) on Wednesday, June 1st!\n\nIn celebration, the location will offer free BIGGBY COFFEE (hot and iced); lemonade, iced tea, cookies and muffins outside the store beginning at 7 a.m. on Wednesday as the inside will remain closed during the day to accommodate the filming.\n\n“We heard they were looking for a hip, fun and inviting café as a location so we jumped on the opportunity,” Rose Glendinning, co-owner of the location said. “We wanted to make sure everyone was still able to get their BIGGBY COFFEE fix and include them in the excitement, so we decided to give away free coffee and other drinks outside the store.”\n\nCurrently in its third season, “HUNG” features actor, Thomas Jane as Ray Drecker, a financially strapped history teacher and basketball coach at a high school in suburban Detroit. The show uses dark humor to tell the story of Drecker and his unorthodox way of making extra money in a troubled economy and through his personal setbacks. A majority of the show’s episodes have been filmed in Detroit, Troy, Walled Lake and West Bloomfield.\n\nThe free beverages will run until 6 p.m. and everyone is invited to come by during the day to watch the filming from outside the store. Both Rose and her brother Joe, also a co-owner of the location, will be cast as extras in the episode, which is set to air later this year.\n\nAbout BIGGBY COFFEE®"
