In HBO Max’s case, it had one of the premier entertainment brands in the US, HBO, and bundled it with content from the Warner Bros catalog, which includes Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT.\n\nBefore HBO Max, there was HBO Now, which had already gained six million subscribers who weren’t tied to HBO. When it came time to transition, HBO moved all of their Now subscribers to Max, alongside opening the app up to anyone who pays for HBO.\n\nIt was an immediate hit, with TV shows like Euphoria, The Flight Attendant, and Game of Thrones drawing millions of viewers in. The pandemic also pushed theatrical releases onto streaming platforms quicker, and HBO Max was one of the first to release movies in the cinema and on streaming at the same time.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe pandemic also provided HBO Max and all other streaming services with a boom in usage, which may have propelled Warner Bros to invest more into the service and move more original series and movies onto the streaming platform.\n\nIn 2021, WarnerMedia was spun out of AT&T and a merger of it and Discovery was announced, with AT&T shareholders owning 71 percent of shares. This merger was completed in April 2022, and the two media giants combined their libraries in 2023.\n\nThe US is responsible for the majority of HBO Max subscriptions, although Warner Bros. Discovery is looking to improve the brand’s recognition and subscription numbers globally. In some countries, such as the UK, HBO has a programming partnership (Sky in the UK) to distribute its content, which limits the amount of countries HBO Max can operate in.\n\nIn its home country, HBO Max is quickly ascending in market share, surpassing Hulu and Disney+ in 2022 to be the third largest video streaming service. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which according to Just Watch are neck-in-neck for first place, are HBO Max’s next targets.\n\nThe release of the first season of House of the Dragon, the prequel to Game of Thrones and other shows such as The Last of Us and Succession, have put HBO in a strong place to compete against Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and others.\n\nWe have collected data and statistics on HBO Max.
