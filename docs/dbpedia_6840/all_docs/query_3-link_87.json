        "text": "PROGRAMS\n\nWith exhibition space spanning two floors and four galleries, CAS aspires to be a regional arts destination, delivering programming that is diverse, dynamic, and life-enriching. CAS promotes the visual and performing arts of, by, and for our communities, including world-class artists, local artists, and arts education.\n\nCAS regularly offers opportunities to show work in our venues, and we welcome submissions from artists and arts groups through an annual call for exhibition proposals. Exhibitions are complemented by a wide range of public programs, including dance and music performances, artist talk backs, film screenings, lectures, and community gatherings.\n\nCAS also empowers emerging and established artists of all ages to deepen their practices through various educational opportunities. Our long-standing CAS Kids program provides a free out-of-school learning opportunity, offering families intensive arts education combining art making and historical context. In our mixed-media and ceramics studios, we invite the community to explore, play and learn about art-making.\n\nHISTORY\n\nCAS was founded by Charles F. Beck in 1971, out of his Cooks Falls home, as a space for artists to gather and share common interests. CAS incorporated as a nonprofit organization as Catskill Art Society in 1972 and moved to Hurleyville to share the newly dedicated Sullivan County Museum building with the Sullivan County Historical Society.\n\nIn 2007, CAS renovated a historic building in Livingston Manor, built as the Manor Theater in 1929 and showing movies through the 1970s, to create exhibition space and classrooms on the ground floor. In 2020-22, CAS underwent a major renovation and expansion to activate its previously unoccupied second floor space, allowing the organization to expand the scale and scope of its programming. Coinciding with the renovation, the organization is reopening as Catskill Art Space."
