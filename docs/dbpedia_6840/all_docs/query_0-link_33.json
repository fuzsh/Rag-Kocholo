        "text": "“We are still in Eden; the wall that shuts us out of the garden is our ignorance and folly.” Thomas Cole. Essay on American Scenery, 1835.\n\nThe Poetry of Nature, organized by the New-York Historical Society, displays about 40 paintings, hung salon style in two rooms. It is a lovely exhibition that focuses on “nature” in painting, but with little emphasis on describing the almost avant-garde stance of the Hudson River School landscape painters or demystifying the underlying socio-cultural themes and dynamics of that time.\n\nAvant-garde is not typically the first phrase that comes to mind in looking at 19th century paintings by Thomas Cole, Asher Durand, Albert Bierstadt and their circle of American artists. Nonetheless, this “school” of art was as contemporary and innovative then as Pop art would be 100 years later. How could something so atmospheric and majestic be so radical? There were several reasons.\n\nBefore the mid-19th century, landscape painting ranked low on the list of artistic endeavors. Portraiture, history and allegory were dominant. Landscape painting, via the Hudson River School, grew rapidly between the 1840s and 1860s, before dramatically declining in the 1870s. The artists, along with their urban (and more urbane) patrons and a broader audiences, shared a view that landscape painting highlighted “the beauty of God’s creation for the instruction and renewal of the everyday American.” In a sense, “God” and “nature” were synonymous, if not entangled, in the 19th century.\n\nLandscape painting was nearly devoid of human activity, although human presence was depicted by small, almost imperceptible, figures. Man and his creations—such as a building, a village or ships—were dwarfed by the landscape; nature dominated. In fact, landscape painting bordered on the evangelistic. It was not only about morality and spirituality; it was also about a sense of shared nationality and identity—America, the quasi-utopian democracy. (Ironically, this was art being made in the fragile socio-political decades leading up to the Civil War.)\n\nIn a seminal 1993 assessment of landscape representation, the art historian Angela Miller suggested that the mid-19th century appetite for landscape painting was motivated by\n\nidentifying images of nature with virtue, purity, and uncomplicated harmony, as well as with national unity, pride of place, and a unique identity distinct from that of Europe.\n\nIn fact, for many Americans the art of “painted nature was more eloquent than the thing itself.” Nature was so thoroughly idealized and romanticized that it did not need to be directly experienced. This does not sound radically different than today’s emphasis on experiential encounters with art. The only thing missing in the 19th century was the selfie.\n\nThomas Cole’s work has been described as having “deep—almost willful—accessibility,” instructing viewers about the meaning and morals of landscape. His best known written work, Essay on American Scenery (1835), is enlightening. Cole talks about how nature can uplift and instruct humans: “Amid [natural scenes] the consequent associations are of God the creator—they are his undefiled works, and the mind is cast into the contemplation of eternal things.” More recently, art historian Barbara Novak, succinctly captured the essence of Cole and the Hudson River School:\n\nNature is both sublime and sanctified. The task of artist and spectator is to unveil, to reveal, the hidden glory.\n\nThe exhibition has a broad selection of works spanning almost 70 years, and the working definition of Hudson River School is broad. The Poetry of Nature includes work by the major figures of the school, and is heavy with the work of Asher Durand, Cole’s disciple and friend. There is a bonus of two works by the little known female artists—Louisa Davis Minot, whose 1818 painting, Niagara Falls, coincided with Cole’s arrival in the United States; and Mary Josephine Walter’s work, Pool in the Catskills (mid 1800s).\n\nThe wall texts are didactic, and primarily focus on landscape imagery as subject. They answer the question of “what?” but not “why?” In this case, the historical and socio-cultural contexts are even more intriguing, given our current government’s deregulation of environmental protection and the reemergence of American nationalism. These current topics underscore how avant-garde this school of painting was at the time.\n\nThe Poetry of Nature: Hudson River School Landscapes, Worcester Art Museum, through November 25, 2018."
