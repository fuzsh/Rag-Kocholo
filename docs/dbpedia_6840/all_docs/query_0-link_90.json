Today’s artists continue to use animal imagery as a way to address humanity’s interconnectedness with the natural world. Un/Natural Selections: Wildlife in Contemporary Art, organized by the National Museum of Wildlife Art, explores the meaning of these creative expressions within the context of contemporary art. Featuring a diverse group of more than forty artworks from the National Museum of Wildlife Art’s permanent collection, the exhibition offers a wide range of styles in a variety of media, divided into four thematic sections: Tradition, Politics, Science, and Aesthetics. These realms act as overlapping chapters, investigating the ways we use animal imagery to tackle human concerns and responsibilities.\n\nThe title of this exhibition is a play on Charles Darwin’s concept of natural selection from his pivotal writing, On the Origin of Species (1859). Darwin’s ideas contributed much to the development of wildlife art in the late nineteenth century, as artists began to represent animals in natural habitats, enacting natural behaviors. From Julie Buffalohead and Kiki Smith to Walton Ford and James Prosek, the artists in this exhibition represent another stage in the evolution of animal art: choosing to represent animals in alternative, unnatural spaces—spaces more often directly linked to civilization than to wilderness.\n\nUn/Natural Selections: Wildlife in Contemporary Art is organized by the National Museum of Wildlife Art. Generous support provided by Art Bridges.\n\nExhibitions are made possible by assistance provided by the County of Westchester.\n\nKindred Worlds: The Priscila and Alvin Hudgins Collection\n\nThrough March 2, 2025\n\nView press images\n\nDrawn from the private collection of Priscila and Alvin Hudgins III, Kindred Worlds transports an array of contemporary artworks from the walls of their home in Yonkers to the galleries of the Hudson River Museum. This is the first time these works are presented as a collection to the public, demonstrating a dynamic amalgamation of relationships between collector and artist, artist and subject, subject and kin.\n\nFor the Hudgins, building their collection was a way of building home and community—a practice that Priscila and Alvin take up in more ways than one, as they have become great friends with many of the artists featured in this exhibition. In turn, many of these artists have included images of Hudgins family members in their works.\n\n“Our collection is deeply personal and intuitive,” said Priscila and Alvin Hudgins. “We truly love every piece and feel gratitude to the artists that allow us to be guardians of their magical creations during our short time on this physical plane. Our ultimate goal is for future generations to have the ability to enjoy these works. We also hope to inspire people that look like us to realize that they can too, join us in becoming ‘collectors.’”\n\nThemes of myth and memory pervade the collection, as artists take up different visual strategies to convey personal histories. Here, artists such as Bony Ramirez, Laurena Finéus, and Naudline Pierre reinterpret classical techniques in order to create otherworldly renditions of femininity, Blackness, and migration. Others experiment with the materiality of art itself. Artists including Chase Hall and David Hammons use coffee beans, cotton, and grease as mediums, invoking specific histories of oppression and resilience—often in relation to the enduring and forceful presence of colonial structures.\n\nThe exhibition is co-curated by Alyssa Alexander, Independent Curator and Arts Administrator, and Karintha Lowe, HRM’s Mellon Public Humanities Fellow. Alyssa Alexander states, “This opportunity to work with two amazing collectors—but more importantly—two amazing people, has been my absolute pleasure! Their collection, and in turn this show, is the perfect opportunity for visitors of all ages to engage with new perspectives within American art at HRM.” Karintha Lowe adds, “The Hudson River Museum’s history has long been intertwined with ideas of home and community—after all, the Museum’s first site was Glenview, the Trevor family home! Kindred Worlds continues to celebrate the profound staying power of art in building community, and we welcome audiences, from local artists and art enthusiasts to college students, to join us in celebrating this stunning and deeply moving collection of works.”\n\nIntimate vignettes provide another throughline across the collection. Drawing inspiration from childhood memories, ethnographies, and family photographs, many of the artists explore how ideas of “home” and “kinship” take on new and unexpected meanings when represented on the canvas. Jordan Casteel, for example, created her MTA series after observing the restful weariness of subway travelers, who find a moment for themselves in the comforting curve of plastic seats. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Raelis Vasquez turned to his family albums for solace, translating his photographs into painted scenes of quiet connection.\n\nAnd, of course, there’s the ever-present presence of the Hudgins family themselves. We invite you to walk through the exhibition and locate images of Hudgins family members—captured, for example, in Henry Taylor’s gestural brushstrokes and Derrick Adams’s punchy, joyous color palette. These selected works document the Hudgins family’s abiding support of the arts and their vital legacy of Black American collectorship, one that continues to prioritize the success of Black and Brown artists and ensure a more equitable and expansive vision of American art.\n\nFeatured artists:\n\nDerrick Adams • Susan Aparicio • Jordan Casteel • Michael Chuapoco • Kevin Darmanie • Esiri Erheriene-Essi • Laurena Finéus • Chase Hall • David Hammons • Devin N. Morris • Toyin Ojih Odutola • Zéh Palito • Naudline Pierre • Bony Ramirez • Jose Guadalupe Sanchez III • Henry Taylor • Raelis Vasquez • Carlos Vega • Lynette Yiadom-Boakye\n\nKindred Worlds is co-curated by Alyssa Alexander, Independent Curator and Arts Administrator, and Karintha Lowe, HRM’s Mellon Public Humanities Fellow.\n\nExhibitions are made possible by assistance provided by the County of Westchester.\n\nAdditional support provided by Sarah Lawrence College through a generous grant from the Mellon Foundation.\n\nHip Hop Heroes\n\nThrough March 3, 2024\n\nView press images\n\nHip Hop Heroes celebrates fifty years of Hip Hop in Yonkers and its neighboring communities, centering the stories of the pioneers and party goers who helped shape it into a global phenomenon. Featuring art and artifacts from community members, Hip Hop Heroes honors Yonkers, the Bronx, and Mount Vernon as sites of New York’s musical innovation, where artists from The Lox to DMX to Mary J. Blige honed their craft and contributed to a thriving Hip Hop scene.\n\nHip Hop is generally thought to be made up of four primary elements: DJing, MCing, breakdancing (or b-boying), and graffiti. Recognizing this multimedia dimension of the culture, the exhibition features work by graffiti writers, muralists, and comic book artists. The exhibition begins with an exploration of how the story of Hip Hop has often been told through the visual arts, featuring works by artists such as Antoinette Legnini and Andre Trenier and an original mural organized by Evan Bishop and painted by local artists including Nancy Mendez, Michael Cuomo, and Marco Barrios. These artworks are further contextualized by cherished memorabilia from community members, including a treasured collection of vinyls, ticket stubs, and flyers.\n\nYonkers-based artist Evan Bishop, who co-curated the exhibition alongside Karintha Lowe, stated, \"This exhibition is an important step in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Hip Hop culture. Yonkers has made a significant contribution and produced iconic artists. Having the Hudson River Museum join in this acknowledgement is huge, and the public will enjoy it. I am honored to co-curate this exhibit with Karintha to make this event a reality. May the architects of the culture be pleased.\"\n\nThe exhibition also builds from artist Evan Bishop’s workshop series, Hip Hop Heroes: Create a Comic Book Cover, which was held at the Museum in the winter of 2023 and introduced participants to the relationship between social issues and Hip Hop culture. Original works created in these workshops will be featured in the exhibition, complemented by a documentary about Bishop’s project, filmed by photojournalist Denzel Walters. A special feature of Hip Hop Heroes will be a series of arts workshops, held in the exhibition space, where visitors will have the opportunity to create their own Hip Hop heroes. The resulting art will be considered for inclusion in the comic book section of the exhibition, which will feature a rotating selection of original works, created by and for our diverse audiences.\n\nFeatured in the Museum’s Community and Partnership Gallery, Hip Hop Heroes is guided by the space’s mission to provide an inviting and experimental place to feature local, regional, and emerging artists as well as artists-in-residence and community-based collaborations.\n\nFeatured Artists: Tommy The Animator • Robin Alcantara • Marco Barrios • Shanequa Benitez • Michael Cuomo • Antoinette Legnini • Nancy Mendez • NIC 707 • Pose2/MaxxMoses • Lady Slim • Andre Trenier • Katori Walker • Denzel Walters.\n\nMemorabilia Contributors: The Benitez Family • Buddy YoMA • Joe Genovese • Tom Ray • Raymond Vasquez. With special thanks to Ken Davis and Dennis Fields.\n\nThis exhibition is co-curated by Yonkers-based artist Evan Bishop and Karintha Lowe, HRM’s Mellon Public Humanities Fellow.\n\nSignificant support is provided by the New York State Senate and Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible by the City of Yonkers, Mayor Mike Spano; ReStart the Arts administered by ArtsWestchester; and Sarah Lawrence College through a generous grant from the Mellon Foundation.\n\nAdditional assistance for HRM exhibitions is provided by the County of Westchester.\n\nIt Takes 2: Unexpected Pairings\n\nThrough March 2, 2025\n\nView press images\n\nThe power of an artwork is often amplified when in dialogue or debate with another. It Takes 2: Unexpected Pairings explores the resonances and dissonances that arise when unrelated objects are set side by side. These unlikely companions, drawn from the HRM collection, loans from Art Bridges, and private collections, span different centuries, cultures, and media. Their juxtaposition may reveal overlapping frames of reference, draw out previously unnoticed dimensions, or challenge preconceived notions of universality.\n\nIn the eight pairings featured here, each explored under a different theme, the artworks stand on their own and also hold a mirror to one another. One poignant pairing reveals two striking explorations of love. Felix Gonzalez-Torres’s Untitled (L.A.), 1991, is installed near an ornate wedding platter from the 1870s. Gonzalez-Torres’s candy-spill work dates from the same year he lost his beloved partner to an AIDS-related illness and is a testament to their relationship. The ceramic dish, produced by W. T. Copeland & Sons, features wedding vows as part of its decoration, including “in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.” The platter was made to hold food for wedding guests, just as Gonzalez-Torres meant for visitors to consume the commemorative candy.\n\nIn other juxtapositions, works by Georgia O’Keeffe and Andy Warhol invite us to consider organic forms we can encounter everyday from a fresh perspective, and Winslow Homer’s watercolor of a Florida coastal scene and Catherine Latson’s sculptural dress made of shells suggest changing relationships to nature. Finally, the fantasy realm of children’s play provides a vehicle for artists JooYoung Choi and Mark O’Banks to rewrite history, to upend social injustices through invented worlds and very different artistic sensibilities.\n\nSeveral works in this exhibition are generously lent by Art Bridges, Bentonville, Arkansas, as part of the Art Bridges’ Collection Loan Partnership initiative.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible by generous support from the New York State Senate and Majority Leader Stewart-Cousins.\n\nExhibitions are made possible by assistance provided by the County of Westchester.\n\nALSO ON VIEW\n\nHudson River Explorers: Prints by Holly Sears\n\nThrough January 14, 2024\n\nView Press Images\n\nCollection Spotlight: Abstraction, 1950–1980\n\nThrough January 21, 2024\n\nView press images\n\nIn Exaltation of Flowers: Edward Jean Steichen\n\nThrough February 18, 2024\n\nView press images\n\nCollection Spotlight: The Hudson River School\n\nOngoing\n\nView press images\n\nCollection Spotlight: The Art of Skywatching\n\nOngoing\n\nView Press Images\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nAll events are free with general admission unless otherwise noted.\n\nView program images\n\nFriday, December 1, 5–8pm\n\nFree First Fridays: Gilded Holiday Glow Image\n\nCelebrate the holiday season at our new free evening hours, featuring live music by Diverse Concert Artists.
