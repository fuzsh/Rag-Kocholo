        "text": "The inaugural exhibition explores ideas of cultural, social and economic exchange, a longstanding mission for the artist. The show, curated by Dakin Heart, is titled “Contemporary Sculpture from Mexico” and features work by the likes of Jose Davila, Hector Zamora, Yolanda Ceballos, and Bosco Sodi himself. In another exhibit titled “Assembly 1: Unstored,” there are are pieces by Ugo Rondinone, Izumi Kato, and Shiro Tsujimura.\n\nTaking cues from the regeneration of the area surrounding Casa Wabi, which features a studio, artist residency, and also a series of restaurants and hotels, Sodi has plans to also offer educational and community programming in Monticello. To create an art destination with real pull, he also plans to add a restaurant to the site in the future.\n\nSee images of the museum below."
