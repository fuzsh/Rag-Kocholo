        "text": "On Wednesday, October 12 at 6:30pm (ET), join renowned art critic, poet, curator, and writer John Yau for an engaging talk on 19th-century landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church and 20th-century abstractionist Thomas Nozkowski. “John Yau: Church and Nozkowski and Their Views of the Catskills” will focus on how each artist’s vision of nature, as embodied in their paintings, could provide lessons for us today.\n\nJohn Yau was the 2018 recipient of the Jackson Prize in Poetry, followed by a Rabkin Award for his art criticism in 2021. He currently serves as an editor at Hyperallergic and is a professor of Critical Studies at Rutgers University’s Mason Gross School of the Arts.\n\n“John Yau: Church and Nozkowski and Their Views of the Catskills” is the second of three talks in the 2022 Clarice Smith Distinguished Lectures in American Art series presented by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. This annual series was established to present new insights in American art from the perspectives of outstanding artists, critics, and scholars.\n\nThe discussion will take place on Wednesday, October 12, 6:30pm (ET) in person and online. It is free of charge, but registration is required.\n\nFor more information, visit americanart.si.edu and register now."
