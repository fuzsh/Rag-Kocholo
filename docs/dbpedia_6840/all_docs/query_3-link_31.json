        "text": "The first exhibition to focus on the architectural achievements of Thomas Cole, the acclaimed founder of the Hudson River School of American landscape painting, recently debuted at the Thomas Cole National Historic Site in Catskill, New York. Comprising 29 paintings and sketches, “Thomas Cole: The Artist as Architect” inaugurates the compound’s New Studio, a reconstructed Italianate building Cole conceived as his personal work space in 1846 (it was torn down in 1973). “The centerpiece of the show is The Architect’s Dream,” says curator Annette Blaugrund, discussing one of the painter’s signature works, which the Toledo Museum of Art is loaning for the first time in two decades. The seven-foot-wide composition, which Cole completed in 1840, gorgeously depicts benchmark styles of historical architecture, from the pyramids of ancient Egypt to romantic Gothic Revival cathedrals. Also included is an initial sketch of The Consummation of Empire, one of his most famous works, and architectural plans for the only three buildings he designed that were ever realized.\n\nBorn in Lancashire, England in 1801, Cole immigrated to the U.S. with his family in 1818, settling in Steubenville, Ohio. His artistic career is generally acknowledged to have started in 1825, when he relocated to New York and began painting predominantly landscapes. In the 1830s, his architectural inclinations matured (he listed himself as an architect in the New York City directory from 1834 to 1836), and he even drew up plans for a version of the Washington Monument in the nation’s capital. Blaugrund not only captured his rise to prominence in the exhibition, which is on display through October—after which it travels to the Columbus Museum of Art—but also in a new book of the same name (The Monacelli Press, $30). “No one ever wrote about his architecture before and put it together like this,” she says. “It is absolutely unique.”"
