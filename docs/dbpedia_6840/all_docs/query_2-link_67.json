        "text": "Nanuet: The flawed jewel of the Hudson lowlands\n\nHi locals! My NANUET pages are doing exactly what I hoped they would do; I have gotten some wonderful emails from people who have generously shared their own memories of our humble hamlet. I've also been contacted by some long lost old friends. Please feel free to share your memories with me. Anything about Nanuet before 1976 (my Bar Mitzvah year) is welcome, pictures too. I won't upload a single word without your permission, and if you wish to remain anonymous, that's fine too.\n\nIF YOU WRITE, PLEASE TELL ME IF IT'S OK TO POST YOUR COMMENTS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO LINK TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS (not recommended), ALSO, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. Thanks!\n\n-Dan\n\nNanuet: Do you remember...\n\nCompiled with help from the Edsall Avenue Jew Crew: Mike Goldfarb (now Goldmann), David and Victor Eisenberg, my brothers Ethan and Jerry Silverman, and honorary member Barry Schein.\n\nLarry Segall, January, 2024:\n\nHI EVERYONE FROM 1962,1963,1964 ONLY 61 YES, ON DEC 29TH I BECAME A FIRST TIME GRANDDAD WITH MY GRANDSON MILO JASPER, WEIGHED IN AT 6 LBS 13 OZ, 19 INCHES TALL.AT 79 YEARS YOUNG I AM OVER THE MOON. REMEMBER NHS FONDLY, BEING SCHOOL PRESIDENT, ON THE CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL TEAM, CLOSE TO MY FELLOW 74 HS GRADUATES AND MISSING SOME OF MY PEERS WHO HAVE DIED AND MANY WHO I HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE OUR 50TH REUNION. LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU. LARRY SEGALL lcsegall@gmail.com 203-722-7763 HERE IN CT.\n\nJames Pratt, May, 2023:\n\nThe other day I was looking at my father's (John Root Pratt, Sr.) old \"pond yacht\"...model of Sir Thomas Lipton's America Cup challenger \"Shamrock IV\". Great uncle John Steingester won a bet with Shamrock's captain Turner and settled for the boat. My dad kept it in front of the fireplace at 31 N. Middletown rd. until his dog (Chiefie) had an accidental injury while playing ball. Dad carried the boat down to the garages and put it in the loft for 60 or 70 years. A long while back, I restored it, wife Debbi made new sails and it still sits in our den in Charleston, SC.\n\nMy great aunt Elizabeth Steingester Knapp and my mother were active in the Rockland County Historical Society and were wondering if it could find a home somewhere. We had homes at 29 & 31 N. Middletown (and up the road at the Steingester summer place ). Aunt Ellie lived in an old (pre-revolutionary war home in New City (200 Brewery Road). Family has been around for a long time (Pratt: HMS Sparrow 1622, Root: HMS Increase 1635, Sorenson 1525 etc).\n\nI enjoy your tribute to Nanuet. It certainly brings back fond memories. Bless you & the contributors. Jim Pratt\n\nEleven shots of Jim's days at Highview etc.:\n\nPaul Doniger, January, 2023:\n\nMemories of growing up in Nanuet: We moved to Nanuet in 1958 when I was three years old. I graduated from NHS in 1973. That summer, when I was only 17, a girl I barely knew asked me if I would give her a ride to Colorado to visit her girlfriend who had moved to Denver recently. Of course I said OK. I remember throwing all my stuff in my Chevy, pulling up to her house, and picking her up. Can't believe her parents were okay with that but I guess people trusted people back then. So we drove to Colorado and stayed at KOA campgrounds. Spent the summer of '73 exploring Colorado. Then I ended up moving to Boulder CO in January '74 and I've lived out here ever since.\n\nI lived on Highview Ave and walked every day to Highview Elementary. I sometimes stopped on the way at Bobby Schmidt's house and we'd walk to school together. I remember one day when I stopped to get Bob, Mrs Schmidt said, \"you look like one of those \"Beatles\" (because I had let my hair grow a little longer). My 1st Grade teacher was Miss Oxley. Had her again for 3rd grade but her name had changed to Mrs Maui (I think she got married in Hawaii). I had Mrs Pepper in 2nd grade (she was strict) and Mr Merkle 5th grade (he was a hoot - had been a comedian in Florida before becoming a teacher). All my teachers in Nanuet Public Schools were excellent. I got a great education even though I wasn't the best student in Middle School and High School. Our class was the first 6th grade class to attend Nanuet Middle School when it first opened. I had a great art teacher there, Connie Frazier. She went on to become the Rockland County Human Rights Commissioner. You can read about that here: https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/2020/01/09/rockland-human-rights-anti-semitism/4422886002/\n\nMr Schubert was a fabulous teacher a NHS. When I took Art Appreciation in college I already knew most of the material from what he taught us. In middle school I had a dumb idea that I should try out for the football team. One hot humid summer day during practice I went out for a long pass and was hit so hard I flew a few feet in the air and \"saw stars''. I really came down hard and they had to use smelling salts to wake me up. Needless to say that was my last day of football, ever! I still have a pain in my back from that hit. Thanks for that Howieâ¦ http://www.nanuethalloffame.com/inductees_detail.php?recordID=20101124092151\n\nI remember the Nowickis had a sign at their pool that said, \"We don't swim in your toilet so don't pee in our pool\". Janice Crofoot and Katie Nowicki boarded their horses in New City and I loved watching them practice English jumping. My friend Tom O'Brien and I once siphoned gas out of his parent's car and we drove my VW to Times Square to watch the ball drop on New Year's Eve during the gas shortage. I remember we couldn't find my car afterwards because we drank too much!\n\nI just pulled out the 1973 Excalibur this evening because I was reading this blog last night. When I opened it and was flipping through the pictures my wife said, \"How do you remember all of their names?\" It's kinda weird because I'm 67 now and feel like my memory isn't so hot, but I could put a name to almost all the faces. Way too many to list here. During High School I was a gas attendant at the garage next to Jolene's. It was before credit cards and I always had a huge wad of cash on me. Looking back, that probably wasn't too smart.\n\nIn high school I felt like I didn't fit in and Iâve had some regrets that I didn't participate more. Never went to prom, etcâ¦ Does anyone know if there is a 50th high school reunion this summer?\n\nThe \"old lady\" who sold antiques was actually my brother Andy's girlfriend Mary's Mom, Mrs Tartanian. They were a really nice family. Her brother Randy was studying to be an auto mechanic, I at BOCES. He taught me how to rebuild engines, do tune ups, etc. We actually built a VW that I drove in High School. We made one car out of two junk VWs! Mrs. T made the best sausage and pepper subs ever!\n\nFYI, I liked Jocar's slices better than Rex.\n\nPeter Jeuck, November, 2022:\n\nWe lived immediately next door to the Caruso's, 81 Blauvelt Rd. The Smiths were on the other side to us next door. Fred seemed much older than my brothers and me but I remember him. He used to trap for muskrats down at Nauraushaun Brook which ran behind our homes. Mr Caruso worked at Lederle third shift so he slept during the days. My parents kept telling us to play in the yard quietly because Mr. Caruso slept during the day. If your mother was Fred's sister, then she must be Phyllis who on occasion baby sat my brothers and me back in the 1960s.\n\nI seem to recall that Fred had joined the Air Force during the mid 60s and his plane had crashed at sea and as a survivor was found only after some time after a search had begun. My recall is hazy and the news about the crash came from my mother who wasn't very reliable in getting details correct. After Fred did his military service I don't think he ever returned home. But I do seem to remember Phyllis being part of a traditional Juniors vs Seniors Egg Fight during Halloween or Gate Night. Again hazy memories. But I do remember egg fights were common during Gate Night.\n\nAre my recollections incorrect?\n\nJennie Redling, January 2022:\n\nProspect Avenue vs. Prospect Street\n\nHi,\n\nI grew up from Kindergarten (Mrs. Horowitz) at Highview Ave. through the new High School (still under construction) in 1964. We lived at 94 Prospect Avenue across the street from playmates in the Leo Family, Suzanne and Joan. The high schoolâs field is named for their little brother Jerry who died in a wrestling accident. I am a professional playwright and former actress, moved to Manhattan in 1972 a few years after college and returned to Rockland in 1998. Surprised that my street was renamed aside from other things I watched when I visited my twin sister who never left Rockland. I have lived in Suffern with my husband for the past 18 years which is quite nostalgic with the Lafayette movie theatre and the Hines Building owned by my great grandmother after whom I am named, Jennie Hines.\n\nItâs enjoyable reading this account of our little Hamlet. I was just describing Boggianoâs and Johnsonâs to my husband and how my sister and I used to walk there every few weeks to get comic books (her: Archie, me: Little Lulu). Also the candy selection at Boggianoâs and how Marie, the sales lady would be furious if you called her âMrs. Boggianoâsâ and if you perused the toys in the back of the store, sheâd shadow you to make sure you wouldnât shoplift. Dan, you might want to correct the misspelled Johnsonâs âstationaryâ store to âstationery.â Those brothers were very sweet. We always bought our TV guide there - they kept them in a pile at the cash register. I remember seeing Elvis Presley on the cover and thinking he was a lady! My first grade teacher was Mrs. DiLisi, second grade, Mrs. Kramer. I remember receiving a mimeographed menu for the week and a choice of A or B lunches with a red triangle plastic token and a black octagon one depending on which you chose. As I couldnât stand the food I either brought my lunch which was mostly a bologna sandwich on white bread and Mayo - the bread slightly stale since all we had was wax paper and the bread was not like today - no calcium propionate âto retard spoilage.â One of the things I appreciated when living in London one year was the food market bread aisles smelled like a bakery in contrast to America where bread aisles smell like chemicals. While walking home from the Highview school I sometimes saved my lunch money and heedless to calories, stopped at the house across from the fenced in playground across the street where the lady living there had turned her downstairs into a store/soda fountain and Iâd treat myself to a 25 cent chocolate ice cream soda. I also stopped at the Nanuet Bakery for a chocolate cruller or a jelly donut 10 cents or a brownie 12 cents.\n\nLater in high school Iâd enjoy the cosmetics in the drug store - Revlon lipsticks and Max Factor pan stick, cake makeup and a fantastic eyeliner with refills just like a mechanical pencil. My girlfriends and I were thrilled when Korvetteâs opened with its vast assortment of cosmetics, perfume and clothing. My aunt owned the Spring Valley movie theatre - the Valley Theatre - which sadly burned down in the 60âs so I saw numerous films free and in high school worked behind the candy stand. It was tragic that the beautiful seats, carpeting and wonderful mural upstairs of Diana and her hounds were destroyed by fire. As a junior in high school I began acting more professionally at the Antrim Playhouse. My favorite teacher, Mrs. Mary Warner came to see me perform in Arthur Laurentâsâ âA Clearing in the Woods.â\n\nI treasure my memories of Miss Nanuet deeply - thank you for keeping her alive.\n\nJenired@optonline.net\n\nDoug Smith, June 2021:\n\nHello, Dan-\n\nI was turned onto the Nanuet site by my sister Chris. It is a remarkable diary of Nanuet experience, accumulating since 2007.\n\nJust wanted to say thanks for having the foresight and energy to put this together. Being reconnected to childhood experiences is good for the soul. The photos of the band marching in front of Buy Rite were awesome.\n\nBeing 'of a place' is powerful, but there is much in modern society that undervalues it. Thanks for tipping the scales in the other direction.\n\nDoug Smith\n\nThomas Rock, August 2020:\n\nDoes anyone from the Highview Avenue area remember sledding in the Schmidt's back yard in the '70s? Every winter, kids from all around the area would walk to the Schmidt's house and spend all day sledding down the giant hill that was their back yard. Like most of the kids, I never met anyone from the Schmidt family, but looking back now I can imagine that they probably enjoyed watching a bunch of kids sledding in their back yard as they sipped their morning coffee on those cold winter mornings.\n\nSpeaking of Highview, is there anyone here who was a \"Highview\" kid when the Highview School shut down and we were all sent to G.W. Miller Elementary School? All of us originally from Highview were always known as \"Highview kids\" to those who were always \"Miller kids\", but once we got into middle school (A. MacArthur Barr), we were all just a bunch of Nanuet kids.\n\nthomasrockny@gmail.com\n\nJoshua Ollinger, August 2020:\n\n242 W. rte 59 Nanuet: My Parents' business was at the above mentioned address all through the 1960's.\n\nAlso what about the Hub Bowling alley? That place was an icon and many top bowlers of the day went there. I once bowled a 260 at that place. What great memories of that town.\n\nAnonymous, July 2020:\n\nI am looking for pictures of a large property and house and family who lived in Nanuet inÂ the 1940s. It was owned by Mary Daly Slattery and her husband, Fred Slattery. Fred was born in Ireland. The property had a name on the sign which started perhaps with an A and perhaps was a Gaelic name? A friend Â of mine spent summers there as a child and she would like to find out if it still exists. Â\n\nHenry Conklin, January 2020:\n\nI was born in Nanuet in 1940. We lived in a house on Main Street, across from Higgins Funeral Home from 1940 to 1944. Then my dad bought a house on the corner of Church Street and Blauvelt Road. In 1948 he sold the house to Swiss Trudy for $8,000, and bought a home in Oakbrook Division. I graduated from Clarkstown High School in 1958. Got Married in 1960. Moved to California for 30 Years. Then moved to Florida for 23 years. I now live in North Carolina. My wifeâs grandfather built the big house across from Higgins funeral home.\n\nMary Marino, January, 2020:\n\nLove this website. I lived in Nanuet (Central Drive called Oakbrook section) from 1949 - 1958. You don't make any mention of the taxi building that was behind the Nanuet National Bank. I remember sitting in there with my mother after getting off the bus from Nyack or Spring Valley and waiting for a taxi to take us home.\n\nAnita, July 2019:\n\nI don't see that anyone has mentioned the teen music hangout in the late 60's called \"The Hullabaloo\" that was located down the street from St. Anthony's Church on Route 59A/West Nyack Road. I lived near there but at around 16 years of age was prohibited by family from attending. I still live in Nanuet after these many years and enjoy reminiscing about what was but also like some of the changes. Hey we're getting an Aldi's in the old Pathmark (EJ Korvettes) Shopping Center shortly!\n\nJoe Farsetta, March 2019:\n\nMy grandfather, Angelo Farsetta, used to own the shoe repair shop (the original one) next to Charlies Meat Market. For many years it was the Flower Peddler and recently closed. My grandfather, and his helper Mike, were older gentlemen who both spoke broken English. They did all sorts of shoe repair work. Neither were devout Christians nor did either try and convert anyone to Christianity. Neither walked with a limp, so I am unsure where either characteristic came from. Nevertheless, the original shop was there for many years. Originally, my grandfather worked for St. Dominick's home, also as a shoemaker for the children and nuns. I remember the barber shop and Perrino's had a deli/convenience/candy store on the corner of the building. The Perrino family moved the deli to West Nyack a few years later when they opened Elmwood Market. I believe the Boggiano's also owned the building which housed his store.\n\nAnonymous, December 2018:\n\nHi Dan. I saw the movie Green Book last evening and felt compelled to write about the racism that appeared even in the north and yes in New York State in 1964. During the summer of 1964, Requa Lake had a sign posted at the entrance that said âno dogs or Jews allowedâ. The sign was removed by the next summer. I would like to remain anonymous but feel free to share this information so that our memories are not glorified but accurately depict the history as regrettable as it was. A reminder for today sadly.\n\nCal Schupner, December 2017:\n\nI graduated from Nanuet Grammar School in 1949. Nanuet didn't have a high school back then; we had a choice of Spring Valley, Nyack, or Pearl River. I chose Spring Valley because my buddy, Eugene Dworkin, chose Spring Valley. He was Jewish and SVHS was the only school in the county that was closed for the Jewish holidays. I wasn't Jewish, but I certainly didn't mind the extra time off.\n\nI was on the Spring Valley High bowling team that won the Section 9 championship in 1952.\n\nI lived with my parents at 13 Kemmer Lane from 1942 to 1958 when Madalan and I got married. (Still happily married, by the way, with 2 adult children, 3 adult grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren). I drove truck for Faist & Westervelt Lumber in Spring Valley and ended up as an accounting clerk in Lederle. Attended night classes at RCC, then transferred to Pace where I earned my BBA. Got my MBA at Nova University and my CPA in Florida.\n\nWhile working at Lederle I drove part-time for Billie's Taxi (Ray Roth) in Nanuet, picking up handicapped kids in Tuxedo and Sloatsburg and driving them to Camp Jawonio in New City.\n\nHung out with Gene Dworking, Duane VanderBogart, Phil Stevens, Fred Williams and Walter Saunders. Did a lot of bike riding and ping ponging.\n\nGillian Brown, December, 2017:\n\nHello Daniel,\n\nMy family live in Nanuet on Pacific Avenue from 1962-1972 when we moved to the Washington D.C. area for my fathers work. My family have kept in touch with two longtime Nanuet friends to this day. I was wondering if anyone in the group would remember Mary Eberling of Pacific Avenue who lived with her mother Joan, brother John and Aunt Betty for a while before moving to another Nanuet location. Our family also kept in touch with Bob & Cookie Lyle, Mr. Shawstack, Mrs. Grushkin of Pacific Avenue. And behind us Bill Sarmiento and the Slater Family especially to remain friends to this day along with the Rooney family in the area. My memories of Nanuet were up till age 7. I remember attending Highview school, having very nice teachers, air raid (bomb) practices in the hallways, the playground across the street.\n\nAttending Knolls Day Camp. I was a Brownie at a local troop (very nice leader) and my mother was involved with a few community ladies organizations. My father worked in Manhattan before we went to Washington. I was born in Sufferin NY but my parents are Canadian. Happy memories of Nanuet! Thanks for all your work on the site Daniel! Kind regards, Gillian Brown\n\nChris Yee, December 2017:\n\nDoes anyone remember the name of the garden nursery on the westbound side of Middletown Rd, East of 59, West of Cropsey Farm?\n\nBilly Feyen, October 2017:\n\nHi, moved to nanuet in 1960 from the Bronx, wow what a culture change. Graduated in 1968. My classmates do you remember SLOPE senior lauching of pumpkin and eggs, black bull pub, OD'S triangle pub. I remember bring some things my dad from the bronx to our house in Nanuet and my dad saying dont blink son you will miss main st. How about ice skating on schwins pond,playing sports behind highview school. EJ KORVETTE of course, does anyone out there know what EJ KORVETTE stands for? i do if you would like to know let me know!\n\nRob Vlosky, October 2017:\n\nHaha - I'm a Pearl River native and my friend Joe Contrino from Nanuet sent me your link, which I think is wonderful. All the places you list are familiar to me, especially Om, where we used to pick bits of pot off the carpet in the black-light poster room. Was I the only one who did that?\n\nI was out there on the corner of Rt. 59 and Middletown Road with my grandmother Lena Vlosky. She was there EVERY week for many years - I was very proud of her.\n\nZoey, August 2017:\n\nHi Dan - Great site with lots of memories! I know this is probably a long shot but I am looking for anyone who may have worked at the NYS Thruway toll booth in Spring Valley during the Fall of 1967. If so please email me! @ zoeymop2@gmail.com.\n\nThanks !\n\nMeg Holden, July 2017:\n\nHi! I found your site while doing some ancestry research for my mom. Her mother (my grandmother)'s cousin was married to Swiss Trudy! We really don't know much about that cousin, and nothing really about her either. I have seen the postcards online. Do you have any stories or a description of Swiss Trudy's Alpine Village? I saw the picture of the building.\n\nI know her name was Gertrude Drittenbass Rust Sampson and she was born in Switzerland. My grandmother was a Rust.\n\nWe are just curious!!\n\nThanks!\n\nPeter Jeuck, June 2017:\n\nMy wife and I have lived in Hewitt NJ for 18 years now on Greenwood Lake. I found this site some time ago and reminisced about what it was like back in the 60s when I was growing up. I was born in Nyack Hospital in April 1955, and my recollection of Nanuet in those days is very sketchy.\n\nMy family lived on Blauvelt Rd. across the street from Lauren Court. Our driveway was on Elks Drive behind our house, and the old rail spur that ran to Camp Shanks ran practically through my backyard.\n\nMy two younger brothers and I used to run out every time the train came by because the engineer would toss out packages of candy to us as we waved when the train crossed Elks Drive. Our family moved to Monroe NY right after I graduated Nanuet Senior High in 1973, but I worked at the Sear Automotive Center from 1972-1978. I wasn't a stellar student, and my guidance counselor said I wasn't college material. I proved him wrong. After I met the stunningly beautiful girl from Virginia who became my wife, I decided to go to school and graduated Rutgers with High Honors and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. i got my Masters of Science in Environmental Engineering and have been working as an Environmental Engineer for a major Pharmaceutical Company for many years. Getting close to retirement. I'm sure I'm not the only one in that boat from the class of 73.\n\nI can't remember when they removed the rails, but those tracks provided a pathway to town, and to the homes of my friends Mickey Baer and Craig Stockdale who lived on Viola Dr. Some 15 years ago I took my wife for a walk down the rail bed of the tracks. There used to be a trestle over Narashaun Brook deep back in the woods past Middletown Rd heading towards 40 foot hole. The trestle was mostly removed except the cerement supports. On the other side was a large golf course where there used to be woods. The rails went over the Palisades Parkway, over an old stone arch bridge that went over Sickletown Rd. and another bridge that went over the Hackensack River at 40 foot hole. At one time I understand that spur was used to provide supplies to Camp Shanks to the men stationed there just before being mustered to Europe during WWII. Now its impossible to walk down the old rail bed segments in Nanuet and Pearl River. But when I was real young, back in the late 50s, 58 or 59 I can remember steam engines before they switched over to diesel. They must have been among the last steam engines ever used.\n\nThe trains that used that rail line were never long. Typically no more than\n\n5 or 6 cars including a caboose. I have no idea why they would keep those trains running into the 1970s. They ran by twice a day, once to Orangetown and once back.\n\nBack in the 1950s I think there was a television show that was filmed in Pearl River...just looked it up, the show was called Norby. My mother told me about the show. I never saw it.\n\nThe Nauraushaun also passed immediately back behind my home. There used to be a stone arched bridge over the creek right behind my house. Then in the early 70s they built homes in the field that was behind my house so we couldn't directly access the brook anymore.\n\nMy brothers and I caught all kinds of critters in that brook, leopard frogs, crayfish, painted turtles, wood turtles etc. There were even muskrats back there. My father fly fished for trout. Today I don't think you could catch anything but a disease in that brook.\n\nWell, I see its been a few years since I last posted on this blog. Last October I suffered a heart attack in Texas. My wife and I were supposed to be attending my nephew's wedding and my wife got very sick with double pneumonia. We decided to drive home since she still wasn't well by the time we were to leave. Docs said it wasn't a good idea for her to fly, so I rented an SUV and we were going to drive home. Got the SUV at San Antonio and we drove as far as Houston when I started getting bad chest pains. I pulled off the highway to an ER that was right at the next exit, and they told me I was suffering a heart attack. They then rushed me to a Regional Hospital and they immediately put two stents in. The doc made sure I understood how lucky I was to be alive. He told me four separate times, three during the operation.\n\nSo I'm getting nostalgic. I've been to cardiac rehab, did pretty well. My wife and I walk four or five days a week for a couple of hours a day, but I simply don't have the energy I had before the attack. They did say I did well in my cardiac rehab, and I luckily haven't had much in the way of chest pain since. But I nearly checked out. Puts a different perspective on life.\n\nEven at the ripe young age of 62.\n\nWell, I think I'll check in more frequently before checking out.\n\nPete Jeuck\n\nJoseph Komonchak, February 2017:\n\nIn reply to Janetâs query about the house on the north-west corner of Rte. 304 and Route 59A. It was indeed the residence of John and Bertha Maier and of their son, Robert J. Maier. They were the proprietors of Johnnyâs Gas Station located across the street, that is, on the northeast corner of the same intersection. The Maiers bought the business in 1929. My family lived practically across the street from the gas station, so we were quite familiar with it.\n\nA large sign facing Rte. 59 proclaimed: âJohnnyâs Gas Station.â Besides selling gas, Johnnyâs Gas Station also included a building that had a bar on the left side and on the right a refreshment stand where they sold snacks, candies, etc. The Maiers were very friendly and helpful. My brother Andy remembers bringing his bike over and Mr. Maier helping him with it. When my family moved from West Nyack to Nanuet, our old dog Butch liked to sleep in the store and eventually he abandoned our house for their building.\n\nIt was also the bus stop for the Red and Tan Lines bus that ran from Nyack to Suffern. For a while the house served as the Nanuet police station.\n\nUnfortunately for the Maiers, when Rte 304 was widened and re-alligned, it was made to run right through the middle of their property, and the gas station went into decline. I have a memory that some part of the service bay was donated to the Smithsonian museum in Washington.\n\nBobby Maier lived for a long while in the now abandoned house. He died in Florida, June 14, 1995. Mrs. Maier died in 1949.\n\n---\n\nDuring the last year of the Korean War (1953-1954), my father, Joseph B. Komonchak, edited a newsletter for members of the Nanuet Fire Department and other citizens of the hamlet who were serving in the military to keep them informed about doings in the Fire Department and elsewhere in Nanuet and indeed all over Rockland County, N.Y. I have copied and scanned the issues of the newsletter, which provide a series of snapshots of local history in the early 1950âs. Most of them are easily legible, but some issues were mimeographed on colored paper and are more difficult to read.\n\nI realize that most of the people who have sent in memories of Nanuet will not remember how things were back in the 1950s, but I suspect that there are some who do. In any case, many familiar names and places appear in these pages. I hope you enjoy them, and would love to hear from you if you do. You can find them at my blog:\n\nhttps://jakomonchak.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/nanuet-fire-siren-1953-1954/#more-1082\n\nFran (Siegel) Marcus, January 2017:\n\nSure hope you don't still have the \"Letter People\"!\n\nI love reading the postings of your website, although I am far from done.\n\nThe site itself is wonderful. (Besides, I love seeing my name.)\n\nDaniel Silverman, you do me proud and I simply had to tell you.\n\nYour first grade teacher,\n\nFran (Siegel) Marcus\n\nJim Drumm, January 2017:\n\nHello Nanuet friends, lots of very kindly thoughts posted here. I grew up by the \"big woods\" on Steep Hill and Briar Rd. We actually all had rifles and and we shot up beer cans and things. Bruce Palmenberg actually got shot in the hand by Bobby Stumpf but he went on to survive. The biggest thing I remember about the Steep Hill/ Briar Rd. woods was the \"skunk tree\".\n\nIt was at least 4' in diameter and was long dead even in the 60\"s but hung and stayed there like a legacy. Many a girl had her first kiss there.\n\nSteven, December 2016:\n\nMy brother and I (spring valley 1966-87) came upon your site after googling in search of the name of the record store we used to go to (it was tapeville USA). Many great memories! I saw that you have book recommendations so here's one more: \"foreskins lament\" by shalom auslander.\n\nHe grew up in an ultra-orthodox community in Monsey and wrote about that experience (one memorable passage was about a visit to rickel's home center where I recall going with my dad). It's a great read.\n\nMichael Gillespie, November 2016:\n\nWould anyone have any information or photo's of Miss.Wight's School that was located across from Highview Elementary School? I belive it closed just before the turn of the century.\n\nSue M., October 2016:\n\nI loved seeing so much of Nanuet that was there in the 1950 & 60s . I know the \"If you knew Highview\" song. Can still sing it. But no one put in the High School Song... \"Come raise a song to Nanuet...Nanuet High, alma mater, we now sing our praise to thee...to thee whose name will live forever...\"\n\nLaura, October 2016:\n\nHey Dr. Dan,\n\ni recently discovered your website, and as time permits I've been enjoying memories of Nanuet - Thank you! I grew up in New City and spent lots of time in Nanuet :) Can you tell me what the address of the OM was? There is a Chiropractic & Podiatry office that is relocating from Pomona to 259 So. Middletown Rd, Nanuet. I beleive that this building was once the OM. My girlfriends and I loved hanging out at he OM (and Bamburgers) when we were 15 or 16 !\n\nBest regards,\n\nLaura\n\nJason Baisley, June 2016:\n\nHello there. I'm trying to find a family in nanuet or a family name. I recently just found out my grandfather was not my mothers birth father. She has since died and I'm sort of looking on my own. I only know the name jack morrow or marrow. He was married to my grandma Jean slapp.\n\nJust didn't know if I could get that out there and see if anyone knew anything of a family in that area.\n\nThank you\n\nMy email is Jasonalan3@yahoo.com\n\nJanet, May 2016:\n\nhi,\n\ni am a nanuet resident. i wanted to ask if you know anything about the house (which is now abandoned) that is near the Honda car dealership? I heard that the man who lived there was Bob Mayor or John Mayor. If you any information about them or the house please tell me, I am very interested in learning more about it. Also I live near St.Agatha and I really want to know what used to be there and just more about it in general. I remember when I was younger passing by St.Agatha and seeing a church-looking building and what my parents said was a orphanage. These building got torn down as the years passed by and now its a park that has barns. My friend and I went near the barns and saw these large flat stones that looked like gravestones on the ground. They were really in the ground and hard to move. I wanted to ask if you would know what they are. Please email me back if you know any information about any of these topics. Thank you\n\nBob Wells, March 2016:\n\nMy best friend and I went to the White Birch Inn in 67 on a dare.\n\nWe may have been the only white boys in the place. The music was fantastic and everyone was friendly. Went back a couple more times in 68 before moving west. Fond memories.\n\nEmma, February 2016:\n\nThis is for Robin Bassett who posted in May, 2015 that she would like to speak to anyone who remembers Club 59. I also worked there in 1968 and have wonderful memories. At the time, I lived in Hackensack. If you are still interested, please contact me through my email.\n\nTed Stephens, November 2015:\n\nBack in 1975 - 1976 I worked on a old construction \"Site\" where the construction company used to store their equipment and steel beams. Company I worked for was hired to remove all the metal from yard and sell it in Hunts Point scrap metal yard. Rumors had it the old building on site were from civil war period but when I look at Historic aerial topographic maps it looks like that area was not developed back then. The main building there was old...had tree trunks as beams and doors had counterweights to open an close. It is now what is the Versailles condos. I would send you an aerial shot I have from years ago but don't see a way to attach it here. Would you happen to know anything about this property? Looks like condos were built approx 2001\n\nDan, November 2015:\n\nDo you remember what the name of the BBQ restaurant that was on Rte 59 in Spring Valley across from the BMW dealer.\n\nThanks\n\nDan\n\nIan Ackroyd-Kelly, October 2015:\n\nAlthough I have followed your site for a while, I just took the opportunity to look at the pictures for the first time the other evening. You have a picture there that is of \"The Pines\" with a comment that you weren't sure where or what it was. I could be mistaken, but my memory - now much dulled by the passage of time -- tells me that the wall in the picture lay along the south side of Convent Road, east of St. Agatha's and across from Caravella lane and Grandview Avenue. Later on it became known as Knolls.\n\nBeyond that wall was at one time what appeared to be a track for horses.\n\nOver the years, the area grew in with trees and brush. I think they also kept cattle on the property as occasionally they would get loose and wander up onto out property on Duryea Lane, and my parents would call them up to come and repatriate them.\n\nAgain, I cannot be absolutely certain of the above, but I believe it to be true\n\nCharles Laggan, October 2015\n\nHutton & Johnson, Nanuet, NY\n\nDoing some historical research on the Hutton & Johnson Company in Nanuet, NY and came upon your site with all those remembering Nanuet years ago. Some great memories there.\n\nI grew up in northern NJ in the 1950's and 1960's and made many trips thru the Nanuet area and love that part of our country.\n\nI'm wondering if any of your folks can fill me in on any of the history of Hutton & Johnson Co (i.e. what their business was, how large did it get, are any portions remaining today, etc.).\n\nÂ c.laggan@sbcglobal.net\n\nRich Hogan, September 2015:\n\nMy family lived at 15 Fenner Lane in the late Fifties. We used to walk through the woods to the gas station at the corner of Middletown Road and the highway. From there, if my big brother or my parents were with me, we could cross Middletown Road and walk to Saint Anthony's school, or we could cross the highway and visit the hotel/Italian Restaurant or the bakery.\n\nOther than those businesses, and the Higgins funeral parlor--Danny went to Saint Anthony's and was in my class through fourth grade, I don't remember much.\n\nI did visit Nanuet again in 1982-4, when I was a postdoc at Rutgers, and I have been using maps and other materials that I can find online in my Community Organization class.\n\nIt would be nice to have access to a local history and a blog that I could in class with my students, to show how people can study their home towns--even when they are far from home.\n\nGary, July 2015:\n\nDo You Remember Nanuet?\n\nSure, I remember. I remember the great pizza at the Nanuet Restaurant and the summer day camp at Requa Lake where I learned to swim and hit the bullâs eye in archery. There were several different Day Camp groups there. They had names like Penguins, Turtles, Porcupines and Otters.\n\nI wonder why I remember that without remembering the name of my own group.\n\nAlthough we lived in Rockland County, most of the other kids there lived in the city. Iâd ask where someone lived and expect to hear something like âHaverstraw,â but get replies like â7th and 45th.â I played Little League baseball and went camping in the Ramapo Mountains. I rode my bike to Airmont School. I fished in the Mahwah River.\n\nMy parents owned the Dairy Queen in Monsey from 1956 to 1969 where the Kosher Castle is now, next door to the long closed Rockland Drive-In. Iâm glad the screen and sign survived the one-two punch of HBO and video rentals. Even if the Drive In had survived those two it never would have survived Netflix. Are there any Drive-ins left in America? We saw several movies there while it was still in operation - the Music Man, Exodus, and Barefoot in the Park and probably more. I remember wondering if âItâs a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Worldâ would have been just as mad if they had called it âItâs a Mad, Mad, Mad World.â\n\nI remember buying car models and baseball cards at EJ Korvetteâs, Bazooka Bubble Gum at the Hi-Health and getting haircuts at the shop across the street. My mother collected S&H Green stamps from the Grand Union. I was watching from the parking lot as Shopperâs Paradise burned down for the last time and was at Shea Stadium the day Pete Rose attacked Ken Harrelson.\n\nHe wouldnât have gotten my vote for inclusion at Cooperstown even before the new evidence was revealed.\n\nWe had a wall of photos of famous people who lived in the area and had bought ice cream from us beside the âwalk-in boxâ refrigerator. Among others there was Burgess Meredith and Wally Cox whom Iâd recognize as Batmanâs âPenguinâ and Mr. Peepers, respectively. There was also an actor that I didnât recognize from the screen but remembered from his many visits to the store. Many years later Iâd recognize (on the screen) the girl and boy heâd frequently send to the window to pick up his order - the ones Iâd come to know as Ellen and Jim. The âkidsâ were now appearing on Cagney and Lacey and Wings and acting under their middle names - Tyne and Tim â actor James Dalyâs daughter and son.\n\nI remember the time I got new skates and crashed through the thin ice in a pond at Bon-Aire Park and being pulled out by Jerry Johnson. I remember delivering newspapers (even though The Record thought I was too young for my own route) as a substitute for Jonah Shacknai â someone who would also find time in the publicâs eye -though Iâm sure we both wish he hadnât.\n\nIt has been many years since then. A family move to Florida in 1969, a stint in the Army, college, a successful marriage and career and 14 different addresses in 3 different states with lots of foreign travel have all intervened. Now as I write this approaching retirement, despite all Iâve recalled, Iâm trying to recall where all the time went.\n\nThese things I remember were only yesterday, werenât they?\n\nSteve Cuppek , July 2015:\n\nHey Dan\n\nI lived in Hastings-on-Hudson during the 50's & 60's. Our Recreation Dept. use to have several trips each summer to Requa. We had some great times there! I remember the pool behind the diving boards. The water was like 10 degrees colder than the main lake. I kept going back through my late teens and into my 20's. We continued in the 70's with my kids.It was a great place for families. BTW, I saw the Bee Gees in (late 60's early 70's) in Theatre In the Round. The lead in group for them at the time was Hall & Oates (no one had ever heard of them).\n\nIrene Kittrell, June 2015:\n\nHello, I'm enjoying the memories shared on your blog. I grew up in N.J. and when I was about five, my parents made me to go to \"Camp Penguin\" in Monsey, N.Y.\" It was located at Lake Requa, supposedly surrounded by the 300 acre Monsey Country Club. The camp director was George J. Koch. I wonder if you ever were a \"Penguin\" or if you knew anyone who was. Strange not to find anything about the lake on the Internet other than your blog. Does it still exist? Thanks in advance for any information you may be able to share!\n\nRobin Bassett, May 2015:\n\nClub 59 Nanuet 1969\n\nI have been actively searching for the name of this bar for over 2 years and waiting for 27 years! I would very much if possible like to speak to ANYONE that has memories of CLUB 59 in Nanuet. My mother worked at the club and met my father there back in 1969. He was a police officer that worked security at the door off duty. My father lived in Pearl River and resided off of Middletown Road at that time. I was born in Ridgewood, N.J. In 1970 and lived in the town of Waldwick. I moved to Arizona when I was 5 with my family and have been here ever since. I very much appreciate anyone's memories and assistance.\n\nReid Holloway, May 2015:\n\nDan,\n\nWhat I think your site captures is the \"New Yorkness\" of New York. And you can't explain that to somebody who doesn't already understand it; you can only exchange notes with someone who does.Â I grew up and went to school upstate.Â Then I lived in Europe.Â Then I moved to the city and spent the better part of three decades there that I loved prior to moving to Connecticut up in the Northwest Corner not too far from the Massachusetts border.Â These are all living experiences that together provide a kind of parallax to what the New York experience is and means over a lifetime of experience and growth.Â As a kid, the railroads were still a major part of the upstate region in people transport which they are not today.Â The Thruway was as \"space age\" an idea as the iPhone is now.Â The Erie Canal was a visual and striking presence that provoked curiosity as to its roots and what it meant about New York history and the connection between the upstate and downstate regions.Â My dad did business in the city and either took the train from upstate overnight in a sleeper car, arising in the morning to a shower and breakfast passing through places like Nanuet and getting ready for his meetings in Midtown.Â If you drove to the city you passed by Nanuet coming over the absolutely amazing engineering marvel of the Tappan Zee bridge.Â These things were mind boggling in an era when a dial phone was cutting edge because you could dial direct on what was once known as a long distance call.Â New York has a feel to it that is absolutely unique, in its appearance, its geography, its economy, its people--and all these things are connected in a uniquely New York way.Â New Yorkers are conscious that their history--as with New England's--is nearly as lengthy prior to the formation of the United States, as colonies, as our history as part of the United States.Â There is historical and temporal depth here that is not observable out West.Â The epitome of that New York feel is the Hudson Valley, from its junction with the Erie Canal up in Albany, down to and through Sleepy Hollow, and then down into the city and the upper and lower harbor.Â The way that you have captured this look and feel in your photos is massively evocative.Â Almost all the places you have depicted photographically are not only places I've visited, but done so on foot or by bicycle or both--and that includes your Catskill shots (like The Apple Restaurant), your Bear Mountain area shots, and even the snow in Cobble Hill.Â I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say that when somebody my age looks at what the once impressive \"Borscht Belt\" resorts have become, he is having a \"New York version\" of appreciation for the history of civilization that is in microcosm what looking at the ruins of the Coliseum in Rome is in macrocosm.Â Water--the lakes, ponds, rivers, especially the Hudson itself--are such a huge element of this feel and your Hudson Valley shots are excellent.Â Dan, you are a New Yorker through and through and you know your environment and your love of it and your family experience comes through.Â It is very much a \"flesh and blood\" thing.Â Sharing it with you is a pleasure and so aesthetically informative and pleasing.Â Thank you so much.\n\n...\n\nDid you ever read any Jack Finney, such as \"Time and Again?\"Â Very clever stuff he has done, but embedded in it some very thought-provoking ideas about time and how we conceive of and represent time with mechanical devices such as clocks and with concepts such as history.Â I am not at all surprised that Finney chooses New York as a setting for some of his best stuff.Â Finney indirectly contends (as I read him, anyhow) that time is misconceived when it is viewed as simply an accumulation of age and the accretion of revolutions of hands on the clock, so to speak; that we miss the significance of what time is when we see it in this literal and linear fashion.Â I first read some of Finney's stuff when I was in college, and I took his assertions with a large grain of salt.Â But then I also recalled from a course called \"The Philosophy of History\" that it is very different to make sense of many things by telling the story of actual events in the same sequence as they occurred.Â Many times the meaning and the context only fall into sensible and perceivable place when actual sequence is altered in order to provide context and decipherability.Â So my views about time have matured and changed \"over time.\"Â Heh-heh.\n\nNow let's put that little tidbit about Finney back in the file folder and come back to your photos and what we have been talking about.Â I remember many times playing a little game with myself when I lived in Manhattan, and sometimes I still play this game up in Connecticut too.Â I would take my fingers and hands and cover my eyes in such a way--let's say while looking southwest from the Hudson shoreline at the 79th Street Boat Basin--so that no building was visible on either the Jersey or New York sides, no trace of anything man-made or \"modern\" was in my field of view.Â And then I would say to myself, \"Here I am, standing in the midst of one of the largest and most concentrated urban populations on planet earth, and I have constructed an edited view that is virtually if not literally the same as it was \"before time began.\"Â Note that phrase, before time began, and what its use in this construct, in this little nutty exercise, demonstrates about time, and you can see for yourself that it has nothing to do with the way in which we usually conceive of time as an elapsing of units of existence.Â Time in this context is synonymous with the activities of human beings, or lack thereof, over an era or eras.\n\nNow if you conducted this little exercise, say, in the backwoods of Arkansas--especially with a New Yorker's sarcastic and condescending attitude--you might walk away muttering \"What's the difference?Â Of course it looks the same as it did 2,000 years ago.Â Nothing has ever happened in this part of Arkansas.Â It is as though time has stood still.\"Â Now there is an interesting phrase.Â Is it time standing still, or is it human progress (or absence of same)?Â And what exactly do we mean by progress when we're looking at the toll time has taken on a place like Hackensack (as one example)?\n\nNow come back to your photos, especially the ones of the ponds, the lakes, the water--and you can readily see that some of these have that quality.Â Had they been taken 200 years ago they would have looked much the same.Â And yet they are things observable right in the general proximity of one of the greater concentrations of activity in the course of human history.Â That's noteworthy, as far as I am concerned.Â It is a huge component of the experience of looking at a photo like that and what it means.Â To wit, you are not just looking at a pond per se.Â it is far more than that.Â You are looking at a very interesting phenomenon about time, and in New York the phenomenon resides at the extreme end of that phenomenon's scale of noteworthiness.\n\nThis I think is what Finney means when he says time is more of a \"mountain range\" than a mere chalking up of moments.Â And it is a phenomenon in bas-relief in New York.Â It is perhaps the most esoteric yet simultaneously the most dramatic aspect of the \"New Yorkness\" of New York.Â You stand in front of Federal Hall, for example, and you are at one and the same \"time\" seeing where George Washington was sworn in as president.Â You are looking at what was once a neighborhood with farms in the vicinity.Â You are in the middle of throngs of financiers texting messages to far-away places like Hong Kong and can be thinking about how during Revolutionary times and, say, the battle for Long Island, it might have taken most of a day for a messenger to move communications back and forth between Washington and his collaborators.\n\nReid.\n\nRobert C. Alfieri, May 2015:\n\nWas looking in your Nanuet Books section, and I noticed one not there. If you can, look up \"Born Again Irish\" by Fred Caruso, which is on the cover as \"O'Caruso\". In the early chapters, he mentions growing up in Spring Valley and Nanuet.\n\nI know this because he is my mother's brother. He lived for a time at 79 Blauvelt Road before moving west. In your letters section, I remember someone mentioning being cautioned because \"Mr. Caruso\" was sleeping, because he worked nights at Lederle Labs. My grandfather. *smiles* Someone I can blame my night owl tendencies on.\n\nWonderful site. Wish I was back there. Thank you for your efforts.\n\nRichard Colwell, February 2015:\n\nBeing a life long resident of Nanuet (1946-present) I have seen many changes over the years. We live at 211 Main Street, across from Keyrouce's Pharmacy where the Nanuet Restaurant now stands, my grandmother sold the property to the restauant and we moved up to Demarest Avenue near the Overmeyers & Goldsteins. I was a member of the first class to go though the entire Nanuet School system from K (Miss Buckman)-12 (Ms Meyer) graduating in 1965, in the past many students had attend another school for 7th and 8th grades. I remember ice staking on Starks pond and sled riding between Charlies butcher shop or on the hill above Demarest Avenue. The wonder time spent at Summer Playground with a weekly trip to Davies Lake or Memorial Day parade which ended by the base of Church Street. I had wonderful close friends as the Campbell's and the Krentz's. After my time in the service I lived in Arizona for a short time, then returned to Nanuet. I joined the Nanuet Vol. Fire Department in 1984. I still reside at my current address on Demarest Avenue.\n\nAlan Moskowitz, January 2015:\n\nEnjoyed the \"Nanuet Milk Farm\" postcards. Who knew?\n\nMy Dad's Uncle Harry at one time owned Eagle Day Camp, and lived in a big white house at the far end of the block where it dead-ended against the Thruway Property. His grounds and landscaping were always beautiful, and now I guess they were remnants of the milk farm. I spent a lot of time there as a kid, and went to \"Eagle\" early 70's as one of two non-orthodox kids (interesting), after my Uncle Harry sold the camp to a Rabbi from Brooklyn.\n\nVery Cool.\n\nIan Ackroyd-Kelly, November 2014:\n\nDr. Silverman,\n\nI am responding to the inquiry from Dolores Fitzsimons concerning her ancestor who was a nun at St. Agatha's in the early part of the last century.\n\nMy family lived on the top of Duryea Lane in the property that adjoined St. Agatha's Cemetery until my parents sold part of our lands to the Diltz family in the mid-1950's. I used to play in, and around, the cemetery quite often as a child and used to observe the occasional interments there.\n\nThere is a list on the internet of Rockland County cemeteries, by township and, then, by town (hamlet). Under that there is a further listing for St. Agatha's and searching that I came across a reference to the burial of a Mary Mark Fitzsimmons who died on 21 May 1947, (no birth date is given for any of the nuns.) This might be the person for whom Ms. Fitzsimons is seeking information.\n\nI enjoy reading your site; especially the reader responses. I lived in Nanuet from birth until I went off to college, and my family lived there from 1909 until 1990.\n\nDolores Fitzsimons, November 2014:\n\nHi, Firstly congratulations on the wonderful site which I came across while searching for St. Agatha's home, I really enjoyed the old pictures.\n\nI live in Dublin Ireland and believe my Grand Aunt was a religious sister in St Agatha's in the early 1900's. Her name was Bridget Fitzsimons born in Virginia, Co.Cavan, Ireland and she is in the 1940 census aged 60 in St.Agatha's Nantucket. I have very little information about her but think her religious name was Sister Thomas I don't know which order she was in.\n\nCould you advise me about where to search for further information, perhaps you know of a website or if you know which order of nuns ran the home are they still in Nanuet. I would appreciate very much any information you can give me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDolores Fitzsimons\n\nBrian Kearsey, November 2014:\n\nI lived in Stony Point but went to Albertus and had friends in Nanuet. In the early 70's there was a small \"head shop\" on Middletown Road just south of Route 59 where you could buy rolling papers, etc. I can still hear the Led Zepplin playing...\n\nJanine Rose Curry, August 2014:\n\nYour site is some of the best nostalgia I've had the pleasure to read.\n\nI grew up on my grandfather Charles Rose's farm known as Linley Farm on Scotland Hill near Pascack Road, which he bought from David Herring in 1893. I was Born in Good Samaritan Hospital delivered by Dr. Henry J. Kaplan.\n\nAttended Nanuet grammar in the early 1950s on Highview where my grandmother had taught in the 1920s Nanuet was such a beautiful area. All the stores and businesses mentioned by your responders are so familiar to me.\n\nMy uncle Charles worked at the Nanuet Dairy, my uncle Morgan worked at Lederle. My dad Ernest worked at Camp Shanks after the war.\n\nWe used to sleigh ride down Scotland hill with the nuns from St. Agatha's convent in the winter.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to contribute.\n\nGus Umlauf, May 2014:\n\nDan,\n\nI love coming to your site. I always end my visit with pangs of nostalgia. The most recent posts about Requa Lake raise a number of memories. While a resident of Lakeside School in the early 50's, I managed to land a summer job at Driscoll Cherolet (Hwy 59) and arranged to live with the wonderful Dennis family at the corner of Saddle River Rd. and Old Nyack Tnpke. I worked six days each week and I looked forward to sneaking the back way through the woods to Requa which was less than two miles distant. It rained nine of the ten Sundays I lived there and swam only once as chronicled in my just released memoir \"Ouda' Brooklyn.\" The 400+ page hard cover can be obtained only through me at a cost of 25. It continues the chronicle of my nine years in foster care and the years subsequent as I sought the Brass Ring.\n\nGus Umlauf\n\nPoke1@windstream.net\n\nJay Sclar, April 2014:\n\nWhile searching the Internet for information about a restaurant my family had gone to when I was a kid, I found Lee J. Lloyd's question on the same place posted here in October 2013. I now live in Bergen County, and a week ago I went up to New City, where I remembered Jerry Carnegie's had been. I knew it wasn't still there, but hoped that some landmark, like the church visible in the postcard image would give me a clue, but to no avail. I contacted members of the Historical Society of Rockland County, and they knew the answer. Jerry Carnegie's had been at the SW corner of Congers Road and American Legion Way where a modern building housing attorneys Neimark and Neimark now is located. The church I had looked for was St. Augustine's Catholic Church which is now the County Animal Hospital. I also remembered the aviation memorabilia in the restaurant, and found a reference on the Internet that Jerry had been a pilot during WWI. The Historical Society people also mentioned that after Jerry's passing, the restaurant had been renamed Ye Olde Tavern, and later Adie's, before it burned down.\n\nDon Erskine, April 2014:\n\nSometimes you find a jewel just stumbling around the internet. I was looking at Google Earth and spotted Nanuet. I worked at a day camp there in 1963. Also looked around Monsey for Requa Lake. My family used to go there EVERY Sunday in the early 50's. I was about 10 or 12. Thanks for the old photos.\n\nEmma Anderson, March 2014:\n\nClub 59 in Nanuet.\n\nHi Dan. Came upon your site today and saw an old post from \"Kathy\" dated January 2012. She asked if anyone remembered the Club 59. I certainly do remember, Kathy. I was a dancer there on weekends (1968-1969). Before that, I danced at the Hi Ho in Nyack. There were a lot of great bands at the Club 59. It was a lot of fun and I have great memories. Was so sorry when I learned it had burnt down. I also am from NJ, but spent lots of time \"upstate\" during the 60's.\n\nDonna Martemucci, March 2014:\n\nI have been searching for info on Requa Lake for years. We went with family and friends many time during the 50's and 60's.\n\nI am oldest of 5 from Jersey City. I am now 61 Requa Lake has for me some of my best memories of summer. I remember there was a certain way my parents and friends gained entry...some secret word or something...really. We would leave at the crack of dawn...travel up 17N...then some road I don't remember but the homes were unbelievable and very few...the picture showing the snack area burning made me sad but I figured it was gone long before 1990...Thanks for photos\n\nRich Mauro, February 2014:\n\nI was thinking aloud to my wife today of the most wonderful memories I had from visiting Requa as a boy and later through my wifeâs and I dating back in the seventies. I decided to search the internet to see if there were any like-minded souls in search out there in the void. The few pictures you have posted on the Nanuet site brought those memories rushing back. I believe that we still have a few photos ourselves tucked away. We were shocked to find housing developments in place after having missed a few years and returning. Your picture of the Rec hall fire is a tragic revelation.\n\nHereâs something you may or may not know or recall: there was another swimming pool out beyond the lake and picnic area which Iâd found while following the creek back out into the forests.\n\nOh, those were such beautiful times. Once we passed the Heller Post up on the hill and saw the Wooden sign and the big hill it was a day of bliss ahead for us.\n\nBTW, Iâm sixty three years old, originally from Jersey City. There were times when we could find half our city block up there in Monsey, all guests of the same fictional member of the association.\n\nWhat supreme joy!!\n\nThank you so much...\n\nCindy Costello, December 2013:\n\nMy sons went to a sleep away camp in Nanuet 1967-1969. My older son has been trying to locate the site for many years. I believe it was through a church on Third Avenue in the Bronx. Possibly through the catholic charities. All he remembers is trees, cabins, and a lake. I would appreciate any information you could give me. I spoke to a nun that I knew and she believed it was around St.Anthony's church.\n\nPamela Ann Martin, December 2013:\n\nI just came upon your website by chance! This is terrific. When I have more time I will read all of the posts. I was born a Good Samaritan Hospital in 1951. We moved from Pearl River to 6 Terrace Avenue in 1956. The school division went right through my bedroom and I ended up going to Bardonia Elementary and Clarkstown schools! I remember the Nanuet Diner, the old bowling alley, W.T. Grant (on the corner of Middletown Road and Rt. 59).\n\nRobert Vaughn (Solo on \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.) and the Cowsills were I remember along Middletown Road there was a victorian-looking house - rumor was that a woman was killed there. When I would walk to town, I would run past that house!\n\nI worked at the original Nanuet Mall when it was first built (Bamberger's!).\n\nAbout 33 years ago I lived in Miami. I went to a women's business club luncheon and started up a conversation with the woman seated next to me. She asked where I was from. When I said it was a little town she probably never heard from, and then said Nanuet, she pressed me me for the street name. I said Terrace Avenue. She asked what number. I said 6. She had lived down the hill on Terrace Avenue. What were the chances?\n\nI remember a girl named Nancy Taylor. Did anyone know her? I used to walk all the way to her house!\n\nDoes anyone remember the Weiher family? Or Wein?\n\nBrian Henkel, November 2013:\n\nMy guess is Kiddie Land closed in about 1972 latest. I Believe I went there three times. Although I always wanted to go, (before and during kindergarten), I used to have nightmares about the place. I remember vividly what the park looked like. More than half the rides would be broken. Different rides would be working or not working everytime you'd go there. There was a big ferris wheel that was usually not running and a very small ferris wheel for small children that would be running, but would smoke and have a puddle of oil leaking from it. Many horses on the merry-go-round had the tails broken off and they would have peoples initials carved into them. The little boat ride would be one of maybe three rides working that day and was scary because of how old it was and how dirty the water was. Just recently I saw an episode of \"The MONKEES\" and it looked like they were posing an goofing around infront of the entrance to it during one of the music segments of the show. All that stands there now is West Nyack Dump. I heard they left one ride standing, but I doubt its true. I never went that deep into the dump to investigate it.\n\nI recently moved to Tuxedo NY. It is about 15 minutes from where Jungle Habitat used to operate. Deep in the woods that surround Greenwood Lake Airport, in West Milford NJ, It's still there. I spent 2 hours walking around in it. Took some pictures, but couldnt figure how to display them on this site. It closed in 1976.\n\nHere's a few pics I took that day. I lost a great one of what looked like could have been a small souveneir shop. It was literally just the frame made of branches and has probably crumbled since that day. The first is the main entrance, the 2nd is what looks like they may have kept some type of reptiles or something and the 3rd is the track the little zebra painted jeeps used to run on ! Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you with the pictures.\n\nFor those of you who used to go to The Catskill Game Farm, which closed on Columbus Day 2006 after 73 years of buisness, the entire piece of land spans over 900 acres. 206 acres used for the main game farm and surrunding woods.The rest of the land was used for the animals to run free and breed. It turns out a young married couple bought the 206 acres and are turning 80% of it into a camping area for people with campers or big RV'S. The remaining 20% is the original entrance of the game farm which will have a Catskill Game Farm Museum and the petting zoo where you can feed small animals that run free, with crackers and baby bottles will re-open!\n\nLee J. Lloyd, October, 2013:\n\nDoes anyone you remember or have any information about a Restaurant/Bar called Jerry's. My family went there in the mid 1950's on Sundays. It had a very large fireplace and many artifacts from the crash of the Hindenburg in Lakewood, NJ. The owner, Jerry, would walk around the bar and talk about the crash. He had collected many items from the crash and displayed them throughout the restaurant.\n\nIt was in Nanuet, or Spring Valley or Nyack ... not sure. I was born in 1946.\n\nAny info you might share would be appreciated!\n\nLee J. Lloyd\n\nGrew up in Oradell, NJ\n\nPeter Jeuck, September 2013:\n\nI'd like to ask a question. My younger brother George (now deceased) had a second or third grade teacher Mrs Cross who taught at George Miller Elementary School. I remebered him saying that as a child she was one of the Our Gang Rascals. She used to tap dance for her class. She had two sons who went to Nanuet, one was Jeff Cross. I looked online for the cast of Our Gang but couldn't find her listed/mentioned. Does anyone know more definitively whether Mrs Cross was indeed a child actor with Our Gang...Little Rascals?\n\nSomeone mentioned the rock at Lederle. I heard a completely different story about the rock. All myths I think. But adds to the mystique of an area whose development dates back to Dutch colonization. The story I heard was that two children were lost in the woods and climbed to the top of the rock for protection from wolves. The story had them die on the rock before being saved. Their ghosts supposedly haunted the rock.\n\nThen another story I heard related to an Indian Princess who also died on the rock. Maybe this story was mixed up with Spook Rock in the Tallman area. Supposedly her ghost haunted the rock. Whatever the case there are stories a out that rock. My girlfriend Holly Gleason lived in apartments across Middletown Rd. just a couple hundred ft from the rock. We sat on the rock many times during the five years I dated her.\n\nLederle was an institution in Pearl River and Nanuet. My neighbor Mr Caruso worked graveyard shift there. My mother always told my brothers and me to play quietly so we wouldn't disturb Mr Caruso who slept during the day. When I was very young my mother worked on a packaging line at Lederle. In 1992 I got a job with Lederle as an environmental engineer. I saw many old schoolmates who worked there for many years... Especially Louis Mazzucca who went to George Miller school with me from Kindergarden (1960) through to Middle School. Debra Roth also worked there when I did. I left Lederle in 1994 when I took a job at Hoffmann LaRoche in Nutley. Both Lederle and Roche have closed. I'm involved in the remediation work at Roche now. Roche plans to sell the plant site in 2015. I don't know what happened with the Lederle site. If it is being sold or what. I do know they have some old landfills that date back to the beginning of operations there in 1906. Old apothecary bottles used to wash out of the landfills every so often when it rained hard. Some of those old bottles were types used in the 19th century and would have some historic value if not also having monetary value. I would imagine many if not all the buildings at Lederle will be razed and the property sold for housing developments in the not too distant future. That's what is happening to many old manufacturing sites. Change... Nothing stays the same. That's why web sites like this are important. To keep the memory alive.\n\nBob Fullem, September 2013:\n\nThanks for your blog about Nanuet. I lived at 53 Church St. from the late '40's until October of 1961 when we move to Strawtown Rd in West Nyack, and I transferred from the new Nanuet H.S. to Clarkstown H.S. I recall many of the names that others have mentioned in your blog, the stores and teachers and families. Edgar Milford's post reminds me of some times we spent together at my home and his. The long-gone pond next to our house was a constant fascination and Lake Nanuet a summer joy. The main shopping, though, was in Nyack, with Lulich's Bakery a big hit, especially those fresh crumbuns. The only correction I have to your posting is that the Nanuet public library started in a Main St. storefront.\n\nGeoff Knafou, August 2013:\n\nI remember the Memorial Day parade, I would play taps on the trumpet on the high school roof. Also, Chicken Unlimited where me and Alan Kostetsky ate them out of business. Sadly, Alan was murdered by one of his employees (who was stealing) when only in his twenties. Lederle Rock where Chief Nanuet was supposedly buried. Jocar, Rex, Nanuet Pizza, Fordham best pizzerias in Nanuet and Jimmies in Spring Valley.Nyack and Good Samaritan hospitals---spent lots of time there to my parents delight. Seems like any high spot in Rockland when the leaves were off the trees you could see the NYC skyline...Incredible. I worked at Marshalls as a stock boy, wonder if it is still there----Geoff Knafou, class of 76 grk003@att.net\n\nBob Renino (Bobby), August 2013:\n\nHi Dan- I came across your website by accident yesterday. Wow, talk about nostalgia! Great job, and I wish I had something to add but everything I could think of was in there. Your brother Ethan and I would often go to Rex's pizza on our bikes after school (slices were 30 cents) and I would \"ruin\" my dinner at home by eating too much pizza in the afternoon.\n\nI smoked my first cigarette in one of those \"woods\" off of Edsall Ave. (and gagged like mad). I remember how I felt when I saw those Steep Hill woods razed in the 90's (my sister and her husband bought one of those houses, they have since moved). There were displaced animals running around all over the neighborhood- fox, deer, muskrats, etc. Nanuet is practically unrecognizable to me now. It looks like Paramus NJ.\n\nPaula Royak, July 2013:\n\nJust finished watching a doc about photographer Bob Gruen who is known for working with rock & roll stars. He talked about Elephants Memory; Lennon's back up band from NY. Am I dreaming or is it possible that I saw them play when I was in Rockland County using my fake ID at a bar? It was somewhere in between 1969-71. Nanuet is where I see on your site they lived for a short time so does anyone else remember or was it just a dream?\n\nMary McCarthy, April 2013:\n\nIs there anyone out there old enough to remember the Reservoir in Congers, when it was homes, and a creek we used to swim in? Remember when West Nyack was a swamp, and there were signs everywhere, FREE DUMPING, and now there are million dollar homes there, and that is why the Palisades Mall is always flooded, and the Three Corners in Nanuet is under water every Spring? If anyone out there knows of Ralph Guglielmo, from SV, he was the Roadie for The Elephant's Memory, I was his \"straight\" old lady, LOL. Say hi for me.\n\nFrom Mary \"Jones\"\n\nLOVE your site, glad I found it, boy the stories I could tell you! LOL Born in Congers in 1945! LOL\n\nAugust (Gus) Umlauf, April 2013:\n\nYour Blog popped up during a search and I commend you for a valuable effort. I lived in Nanuet for only a short time with Don Sleight and his parents on Blauvelt St. However, both my wife (Sheila Sullivan-Congers) and I were long-time Rockland residents. Most of my years were as a resident of Lakeside School while attending SVHS. The notes and pictures from others are outstanding. Sheila and I had our first \"date\" at the Mapleways when she was bowling for the Lederle's house team. We bought our first crib and stroller at Buy-Rite, our first piece of furniture at Grant's, our son's first bike at Grandway, and thought there was no better pizza in the world than that offered at the Nanuet Hotel. Mary Eberling Venezia (posting below) is a dear friend from those years. Her posting jogs memories at an important moment for me as I conduct research. I have finished my first memoir entitled \"By Way Of Canarsie\" which concerns my earliest years in foster care and am embarked on the second book due out this summer. The Title is \"Outta' Brooklyn\" and traces my journey through five different foster homes as I move from Brooklyn to a farm in upstate NY and, eventually to Spring Valley. It ends when I meet my meet wife-to-be while we both worked at Lederle. To say I would enjoy hearing from anyone from that era, would be an understatement.\n\nAugust \"Gus\" Umlauf poke1@windstream.net\n\nCal Mendelsohn, December 2012:\n\nWhat an absolutely wonderful site and trip down memory lane. Way too much to say!\n\nStill live here, and I remember most of the oplaces at the top of your column--great memories of Hogan&#39;s, Mini golf, Mapleways Bowling Alley, pickup baseball games at the AC Field behind the Mall. Also, I remember fondly the interesting characters that inhabited my childhood, some of whom Jamie Kempton mentioned and who could regularly be seen saddling up to the Red Rail and other local gin joints on Main Street.\n\nI remember the Memorial Day Parades, pizza at Jocar, haircuts at Phil&#39;s Barber Shop and the opening of the Nanuet Mall in 1967, which was preceeded by a mass exodus of turtles that found their way crossing my yard on Prospect Street for about a year.\n\nVery glad to see Ron Lugo and Barbara Thomas's piece on Lisa's murder--she was a neighbor and friend and I'm glad that the effort to find herÂ killer(s) goes on even now.\n\nI hope everyone is in good health and spirits. Great to \"catch up\" on some of the doings of those who grew up here that I knewÂ directly or knew of through siblings or otherwise.\n\nThanks for letting me go on!\n\nAll the best,\n\nCal Mendelsohn\n\ncal@nativeweb.net\n\nKevin Sullwold, November 2012:\n\nHey Dan, nice website! I grew up in Valley Cottage/Nyack and was around Nanuet in the 1980s/90s/00s a lot before moving to Dutchess County in 2008 (I am 31 years old). I love figuring out where things used to be and seeing how they evolved. The question that I have on my mind at the moment is the fate of the Buy-Rite store. I see in the photos and descriptions that it was on the SW corner of Route 59/Middletown Road. I know the Ferretti's home (which is slated to be destroyed) is shown in the photos as well and I can only surmise that the Buy-Rite was on the corner when Route 59 was a much narrower road. I suppose that during the Route 59 expansion, Buy-Rite was demolished and the Ferretti house was suddenly at the corner of the newly expanded intersection. Is this correct? Thanks so much!\n\nJoe Komonchak, November 2012:\n\nAll the members of my large family have enjoyed your website devoted to memories of Nanuet. I am attaching three class photos taken at Highview Elementary School. They show my graduating class of 1952 in the fifth through the seventh grade. Feel free to post them on your website.\n\n(I am the priest in the family, and not my brother Andy, as someone said. I am retired now and live with Andy in Bloomingburg, N.Y., two exits past Middletown on Route 17.)\n\nPatti Heydeman, October 2012:\n\nDear Daniel, your site rekindled so many memories of my nanuet.Â My Dad was Louis Heydeman who owned the gunshop right in the center of town, near Keyrouses Drug Store who sold the most wonderful tasting cough syrup that realy worked, it had a licorice flavor.There was ice cream to. I remember the day when I got to have a sundae. something went very wrong with the container that had to be shaken firmly before whipped cream was ready, the thing got loose and sprayed whipped cream all over the place.Will add moreÂ at a later time.I'd love to hear from anyone.\n\nDiane Agostino Lillie, September 2012:\n\nMy memories of Nanuet are of a quiet rural town with glorious fall and spring seasons and winter wonderlands. I lived there from 1950 until 1967. Many times as a child I would walk in the woods behind my home on Highview Avenue picking blackberries in the summer and sledding down the winding path in winter. I remember the sledding hill at Lederles during Christmas vacation and straining in early morning to hear the siren that signaled \"no school\" during winter storms. Lake Nanuet was a refuge for me in summer and the woods became the perfect hiding place for me during troubled times at home. Many on this website have shared many wonderful memories of Nanuet but mine are a mixed bag. I do fondly remember Ms Buckman who was kind and caring and how I cried when she left. Through the good memories and the painful, God in His faithfulness always held me in the palm of His loving hand and continues to do so. The last time I visited Nanuet was in 1996 but the quaint small town I remember had vanished. The home I grew up in that seemed so big then was now not as big as I remembered. We visited our neighbors and their home was the same as it was years ago. Edgar Milfred, I remember you well and enjoyed reading your post. I remember walking in the woods with you and Ellen Kushner and that you lived on Middletown Rd and I think you mother taught school. I attended Highview Elementary School and still have my class pictures. God bless you all.\n\nJim Muller, August 2012:\n\nDan,\n\nThank you for all your hard work putting this together. It brings back SO many memories for me, not only the images, but the name of those who have posted before me.\n\nMy dad, Larry Muller, was the postmaster in Nanuet for many years.\n\nMom, Kay, got her first job at Highview Luncheonette (formerly Elliotâs).\n\nLater Mom went to work at an insurance office in Pearl River with &quot;Aunt&quot; Janie Mills.\n\nMom eventually worked at NYNEX in White Plains until her death in 1988.\n\nManyÂ of the close friends they had, so close in fact that they were all \"Aunt and Uncle\" to us kids have been mentioned here, or their children have posted here.\n\nWe lived on Kemmer Lane, behind the Holiday Inn and in fact spent many a summer day sneaking into their pool for a swim. The entire area is now the Home Depot Expo Center.\n\nI used to walk the train tracks and cross the trestle over the Thruway to an old abandoned pond in the woods. It used to be a swimming pool for the Juzek family before the Thruway was built.\n\nThe Juzeks were our neighbors andÂ it was one of the Juzek family that built the house I grew up in.\n\nI remember a couple of times when the swamps behind Grandway would flood and the entire parking lot, and most of 59 just below Dykes Park Road would be under several feet of water. I wonder if they ever solved that little problem.\n\nMy Grandmotherâs house on College Ave, just a couple doors down from 59A, across from St Anthonys was still there the last time I was home. It was a Century 21 Real Estate office I believe.\n\nI canât believe how much has changed over the years, but itâs good to know I can still share others memories of home.\n\nSeth Mendelson, August 2012:\n\nHi. Just found your site. I see some old friends here and even my own brother.\n\nI have some answers to some questions. Since I worked at the Journal News as a sports and news writers for a couple of years after college in the early 1980s, I can tell you that College Ave. was named becasue there was plans to build a college there in the late 1800s.\n\nBuy-Rite toy store was owned by my uncle Leonard Kurtzman. Yes, it was a dusty store, but it had a great selection and was the best thing around in the days before Toys R Us.\n\nSome other thoughts:\n\n*I love the Nanuet Restaurant and still visit, making a 30 mile trip from New Jersey every once in a while for a well-done mushroom and meatball pie.\n\n*Do you all remember our first good varsity football team. In the fall of 1972, I think we went 5-3-1 (tied Ramapo) and one of the Berich boys (I think it was Don) was a star running backÂ as a sophomore. I remember the Journal News called our game against North Rockland the game of the season. We lost and Coach Abeling was angry taht the marching band left at halftime because it was cold.\n\n*I loved Elliot's and went there after school at Highview.\n\n*Mr. Merkle &amp; Mrs. Rosenthal, who was my teacher in second AND third grade. She moved up with us.\n\n*Mr. Abt, Mr. Rizzuto, Mr. Burke...\n\n*Beating Pearl River\n\n*Daryl Brown and that great basketball team. He lives in Dallas now.\n\n*Tony Harlin and the shot-put.\n\n*The Nanuet Mall....basically lived there for a few years during my teens....i would leave empty pistachio nuts shells on teh floor until i got caught by a security guard who made me clean many up.\n\n*NicholsÂ Hill\n\n*The Schwinn bicycle shop in Spring Valley.\n\n*Jack in the Box in Spring Valley\n\n*Maximus in New City\n\n*The Ground Round right by the train trestle on Route 59\n\n*Knolls Day Camp\n\nAnd much, much more...Hello to my old friends back home.\n\nCliff Cortland, August 2012:\n\nDan,\n\nThank you so much for starting and maintaining this web site. I lived in Nanuet from 1960 to 1982 with a few years away at college in California; graduated Nanuet High in 1975. Donna Schubert-Thibault mentioned the Golfariâs farm at the end of Park. I have always wondered who owned that area. We lived at 38 Freund Drive in the development Donna mentioned. Mr. Boardman was the name of the builder and Freund was his lawyerâs name thatâs how the street got itâs name.\n\nThe development backs up to what was the Nanuet Golf land, miniature golf and driving range owned by Ernie Morrow. Ernie didnât want us to walk up along the driving range to play miniature golf because he was afraid we would get hit with a golf ball. All we had to do was call and he would send down one of his sons in the jeep they used to pick up golf balls and they would pick us up. There were also batting cages with pitching machines.\n\nErnie died in the 60âs and land was sold for the theater in the round. We saw a lot of great shows there, the Temptations, Frankie Valley and The Four S easons. I met a woman a month ago when she learned I was from Nanuet she said, âI played there at a theater, I was on of the backup acts I was one of The Gold Diggers.â Small world.\n\nMy memories of Nanuet are fond ones. It was a small town back then and a great place to grow up. Our family would ride bicycles down to the Memorial Day parade on Main Street and then off to Nanuet High for the carnival.\n\nWhen I was at Highview you could go to Elliotâs for lunch if you had a note from your parents. Mom would give me a dollar and remind me to leave a tip. I would get a cheeseburger, fries, a vanilla coke, leave a tip and buy some penny candy. A dollar went a lot further back then.\n\nSo many great memories; thanks for keeping them alive. Feel at liberty to print any or all of this and share my contact information.\n\nCliff Cortland\n\nccortland@msn.com\n\nDonna Schubert-Thibault, June 2012:\n\nHi Dan ,I know it has been forever but I was looking at \"our site\" and came across a Mary Eberling. If you hear from her ask her if she is related to the Eberlings from New City.My mom was the oldest of Hamilton and Sarah Eberling.I just found out about an old neighbor from Park Avenue that has passed away. She was Violet Hunter (her husband was Ted Hunter).She was a great friend and neighbor. My Mom and her worked at Lederle during the war and ended up next door neighbors.Also I wanted to mention that my father worked for Orangeburg Pipe for 30 years after the war. He was a millwrite A( all I know is that he worked maintenance. While there he met my freshman English teacher Mr. Burns.He would work there during summer vacation. Well Mr Burns loved telling us a few war stories in class and my Dad grabbed him and told him to stop the stories(he was only kidding) but English was a bit more boring when he stopped. Also I remember Miss Schroedor, my first grade teacher coming to my home one day. I thought I was in trouble but apparently my Mom used to babysit her as a child. I sure wish I could get a copy of the Eberling Drive sign,located at the County Courthouse in New City.I have heard that my grandfather and his father donated the land for the courthouse. I also want to mention Mike Higgins of Higgins Funeral Home on N.Middletown Rd(Main st to us)This dear man helped us bury many family members and was highly re guarded by my family.Did you know the Golfari's farm at the end of Park Avenue. They were there when I was very young until one day they were gone and they put the \"New development\" in. When we went down Nichol's hill we would go into the woods past Park .What a ride.I am hoping to stroll down Nanuet's memory lane before I go, so if the Lord lets me I will bring back more stories as I go around town and places jog my memory. If I have any more musings, I will write again soon Thanks- Donna\n\nRon Lugo, June 2012:\n\nHey Daniel, my name is Ronald Lugo, you may recall some time ago I submitted several photos of the pascack brook that ran through St. Agatha home. Well again I'd appreciate your consideration in posting what may very well be the most heartwrenching story in the history of Nanuet. I'm sure most longtime community residents including many of the individuals that have postings on your Nanuet page are aware of the occurrence in 1974 Lisa Thomas grisly murder behind what use to be the Nanuet Mall/Bambergers. The criminal/s are still at large and as a result of community outcry the case was recently reopened.\n\nBarbara Thomas has set forth a Facebook campaign \"Justice for Lisa Thomas\" in hopes that someone will come forward with any information pertaining to investigation. I've been doing what I can to help in the cause and In light of the recent stir I created a touching Youtube slideshow yesterday of family photos that express the sentiments felt by members of group along with friends and relatives of Lisa. The video seems to be circulating quite well.. Anyway, here's Barbara Thomas's news paper article, my Youtube link and an Image I created as well along with the Facebook group link..\n\nI'm not sure if this would be inappropriate subject matter for your site but it is a pertinent story relative to Nanuet.. Either way, thanks for sharing the memories of our town, It is a home where the heart lay fondest. I know Barbara Thomas, Family and friends alike would be deeply touched and gracious to see it up and i can't thank you enough.\n\nBe well and thanks again!\n\nRon Lugo\n\nFacebook community group \"Justice for Lisa Thomas\":\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Justice-for-Lisa-Thomas/257885657587145\n\nYoutube link Carole Kings: So Far Away . \"Justice for Lisa Thomas\"\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGoWi7fr40A\n\nIn Loving Memory of Our Friend Lisa Thomas \"Hopefully community exposure and public awareness about this case will bring forth the long awaited Justice for Lisa and bestow some closure for Lisa's Mother Barbara Thomas\" -Ron Lugo.\n\nOctober 7, 2012 will mark the 38th anniversary of the day that my daughter Lisa Thomas' body was found murdered behind the Nanuet Mall.\n\nAnother year has passed and we still have no answers.\n\nSometimes it's hard to believe that her tragic death occurred 38 years ago, yet most times its feels like yesterday. As I watched my beautiful 15 year old daughter go off to the mall to buy a blouse that day, I had no idea I would never see her alive again. Her murder remains unsolved and her murderer has gone unpunished.\n\nI would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to those of you who have kept Lisa's memory alive. For many years, I felt she was forgotten, with the exception of a few. Recently, I realized this is not true. I have read the messages on various web pages, and I am truly touched to know that not only friends have paid respect in Lisa's honor, but total strangers as well. Your thoughts, prayers and wishes have lifted my spirits.\n\nI pray that anyone with knowledge of this crime will search their soul and find it in their heart to come forward. My only hope in life is to have Lisa's murder solved so we can honor her precious memory and finally lay her to rest. She deserves that and so much more.\n\nBarbara Thomas\n\nNanuet\n\nJohn Clark, April 2012:\n\nAnyone remember my grandfather....Anthony Lombardi? He was a mailman for nanuet for 30 years. His route covered all of main street. I used to go with him delivering mail all the time as a kid. They actually dedicated the post office in honor of him 7 years ago. A nice little plaque sits by the front door. It was a tremendous day for my family.\n\nJackie Bowdon (Mills), April 2012:\n\nI was born and raised in Nanuet. I graduated from NHS in 1971.

A note for Kathy; Kathy your memory is fine. There was a Club 59 at the western end of shopping center where Cleats N Sneaks stands today. I spent a very cold night there in the early seventies as a member of the Nanuet Fire Engine Company, putting out a major blaze that destroyed the place. It was never re-built. I hope your memories of the place are good. jfickes34@optonline.net\n\nBobby Tremper, February 2012:\n\nHad an absolute ball reading all th info. on Nanuet.Â I to, lived on Blauvelt road, three houses up from the Smiths!!Â The only thing I can add is that the corner store on the corner of church was originally called Morgans.Â Mrs. Morgan ran it and lived up the street on College.Â Penny candy could be bought back then , for ten cents you went home with a bag!!!Â I go back about 3 times a year, as my son lives in the area with my Grandkids.Â Â Still miss it though. it was an awesome time to live and growup.

I lived in NJ but in 1968-69 my friend Mary and I spent many nights at a bar on Route 59. It was in a strip mall just west of where the Nanuet Mall is now, on the same side. It was called Club 59. I was wondering if any of your readers remember it. Mary and I are beginning to think we imagined all those nights of dancing, since we seem to be the only ones who remember it. You are welcome to publish this. I hope one of your readers will remember and - maybe - even used to go there. Thanks ~ Kathy\n\nJoe Fornaro, January 2012:\n\nJust read Craig Swan's memories of Nanuet...Monterey Pool...Sid's last name was Goldstein...\n\nCraig Swan, January 2012:\n\nMy name is Craig Swan and I stumbled upon your web site looking up stuff on Rockland County. Pretty cool site!\n\nI'm not from Nanuet (used to hang out there a lot till about '72 when I moved out west) but I grew up in Manhattan till I was 14, moved to Weschester County in '64 and then to Nyack in '65 (we had some older relatives living there) and before graduating from Tappan Zee in '68 I went to Nyack High School from '65-'66.\n\nIt was really a trip to see the name 'Monterey Swim Club' again! How long did it remain there? That really brings back memories. My first (full-time anyway) job was as a lifeguard there the summer of '66. I was 16 then. I worked there with a fellow Nyack High School swim team member (George Nikitin) after we had gotten our life saving certificates that spring. George and I used to meet up downtown Nyack at about 6:30 every morning from Monday thru Saturday and we'd take the Red & Tan Lines bus up to New City and walk south down Rte 304 to the club - it was actually called the 'Monterey CABANA Club' then. Big pool - I remember it being 180 ft. long and I think 80? ft. wide. We worked 10 hour days, six days a week for the whole frkn summer for $300.00 each for a guy (owner) whose first name I can only recall as \"Sid\". \"Sid\" would chomp on his cigar and peer down at us and the pool from the railing up on the hill (to the south) overlooking everything. He was a real character.\n\nAs the summer wore on (very hot summer) we became increasingly bored with mostly saving little kids at the shallow end (no babes in the deep end as we had envisioned) and we began to devise pranks on Sid. One of the best I can print without worrying about any statute of limitations was when we climbed down into the pit behind the diving board area (towards 304) and cranked open this huge wheel that controlled the valve that emptied the pool. As the day went on on Sid became increasingly nervous and began pacing back and forth away from his perch up on the hill and kept asking us what the hell was going on. We kept yelling \"there's no problem\"; only in the late afternoon to admit that we had found the valve mysteriously partially open and water rushing out. We then heroically fixed it and it took a couple days I think to refill the pool properly.\n\nAnyway the summer finally came to an end and we went to collect our $300.00 in wages (don't even want to figure what that was per hour) and Sid reluctantly shelled it out. He then tells us that if we empty and \"clean\" the pool he'd give us another $100.00 each. So naturally we said \"Yeah, OK\" and pretty soon we're pretty pissed because we did Not know what we were getting into. It was a back breaker. I mean we could barely keep up with the sweeping, raking and shoveling out of muck and silt that had collected all summer on the bottom of the pool as it emptied from the deep end. It had to be a couple inches thick. Sid peeered down at us the whole day barking commands and we (as discreetly as we could) kept stuffing our pockets with money we found on the bottom - George and I actually split about 200 bucks we found, so the summer ended up paying us about $400.00 each. I'd never do it again.\n\nSo, after 10 weeks of skin cancer 101 I travel down to the city to 47th St. to Manny's Music and with my $300.00 (and about another 200 bucks I'd made from my band starting up that summer) I blow the whole amount on a Fender amp - but it was worth it in the end lol.\n\nThanks for putting the site together - fun to read all the stuff,\n\nCraig\n\nEdgar Milford, November 2011:\n\nMorgan Park was to the east of Middletown Road off a road that ran parallel to rt 59 but south of rt 59. A small brook ran through the property and when I was a child it was well manicured and we used to walk through it catching frogs and such, but never knew what it was until I saw a postcard of the exact perspective of the brook that I knew so well labeled Morgan Park.\n\nRemember taking the Erie Lackawana to NY (Hoboken then across the river to downtown) in the days before the Parkway and Thruway. Fond memories of the 8 room schoolhouse Ms. Buckman, Miss Prentiss, the McGeary sisters, Mr. Barr the principal, Mr. Schubert the art teacher, and the tiny blacktopped thing in back where we used to run around.\n\nHelen Muller Farrington, November 2011:\n\nMy brother Charles and I go back into early Nanuet than most.Â We grew up in the 1930s and 1940s in Nanuet.Â We went to school in Nanuet and then Nyack High.Â I remember all the early markets as I shopped with my Mom.Â I remember during WW II the troop trains that shuttled through Nanuet on their way to Piermont and then the boys went overseas.Â I remember Dr. Weishaar's office and the church next door that my family went to.Â Great recollections of Chief Lieberman and his fellow officers.Â My Dad, Ernie, was a mainstay of the Nanuet Fire Dept.\n\nThanks for all the great memories.\n\nHank Feinerg, August 2011:\n\nJust found your website. Brings back a lot of memories. We moved to Nanuet in 1959 and are still living in Rockland County. I knew many of the people who are posted on your website. You didn't post Jolly Boys, Golden Chrysler Plymouth, Pergaments, Tinys Diner, G&amp; S Lawn Supply, Johnny's Sunoco, Keyrouse liquor Store, Charlies Citgo, Grants, The Driving Range on 59, Eagle Day Camp, The Army Navy Surplus Store, Bill Goodmans, Parsels Glass, The Triangle Pub, Swiss Trudy's just to mention a few.\n\nDaniel Mathys, August 2011:\n\nThe site is really great...I see it has no recent updates so I would like to add one or two...ref. to the picture of the Memorial Day parade next to Buy Rite is a Brown Building, that was where Bob's Taxi was located. When the Nanuet mall first opened my mom, who did not drive, would call Bob's and they were over in a flash. We lived off Middletown Road (north) just before the Palisades Parkway (about 3 miles away) entrance/before the New City borderline, as you may have remembered Middletown Road was a narrow 2 lane road, just after our street entrance was the famous high bump in the road, the actual pitch of this bump was quite radical and if anyone remembers their Dad perhaps especially my dad speeding up for us going over the bump was like a quick thrill.
