        "text": "Autumn in the Catskills is a work by British artist Thomas Cole (1801 - 1848). It's one landscape oil on panel painting created in 1827. The painting is owned by Arnot Art Museum - Elmira (NY), and is accessible to the general public. Thomas Cole was influenced by American Landscape, Romanticism, and Hudson River School, and made most paintings about landscape and figure and tableau.\n\nFor faithful reproductions, our artists will study the oeuvre and techniques of Thomas Cole. The original painting of Autumn in the Catskills is about 10\" wide and 7\" high. You may customize the painting's size and frame, for d√©cor or gifting, from 16\" by 11\" to size as huge as a wall. Our artists use oil on canvas by default. You may also request non-oil media. Covet a museum's antique frame? View wood carving frames or request a frame reproduction to go with your Autumn in the Catskills replica artwork."
