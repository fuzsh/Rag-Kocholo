        "text": "This post comes to us from Rena Tobey, Curatorial Intern.\n\nThe long summer days are here, and your thoughts may have turned to spending some time in nature, sketchbook in hand. Another alternative is to visit the Henry & Sharon Martin Gallery at the Museum. Here, you can immerse in nature as close by as New Haven and as far away as the California.\n\nIn the 1800s, the Hudson River School artists traveled to their favorite scenic spots in the Catskill, Adirondack Mountains and beyond, seeking out the same scenery we enjoy today. Over the winter months in their studios, they transformed their sketches into luminous landscapes that had come to represent America and its abundant natural resources.\n\nThomas Cole, the founding father of the Hudson River School, imbues the land with even more power. He inserted symbols and figures that represented philosophical ideas he hoped would sway his viewers’ beliefs and actions.\n\nCole came to the United States at 17 from industrialized England.

The cool crisp air, the changing leaves, the ripe apples, pumpkins, and seasonal holidays are all upon us. We also begin to see the changes in landscape. Autumn brings a variety of color out of nature that has inspired artists for centureis, especially the artists of the Hudson River School.\n\nReds, greens, browns, blues, pinks, and oranges are frequently found in their landscapes. The sensation of hiking through a mountain, walking on a trail, having a picnic with friends, and being outside for the last time before the bitterness of winter hits is often captured in these Hudson River masters’ artworks.
