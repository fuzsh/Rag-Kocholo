The postmark is 1905 and the recipient is Mary Berthena Irish, Joe's maternal grandmother. She would later marry Jay Ichabod Kissock, son of Charles Sabra Kissock who had a stone-cutting business in Windham. In contact with the Zadock Pratt Museum, they recognize Charles Sabra Kissock as one of the many persons who carved on the rocks. The name of James Kissock, Charles' father, was also found among records at the Zadock Pratt Museum and he is likely to have carved on the Rocks also. James Kissock had a stone-cutting business in Roxbury and the work of both is identified on headstones at the Sutton Hollow/Mountain Valley Cemetery outside of Ashland."
