MURPHY: Good morning, everyone. Please take your seats, we're about to begin the day's proceedings.\n\nI want to first begin the day by turning the microphone over to Dr. James Billington, the Librarian of Congress.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: Thank you. We're pleased to welcome everyone here to the Library of Congress Hearing on the Current State of American Television and Video Preservation.\n\nTwo weeks ago I presented the Library of Congress to our Congressional Appropriations Hearing and this morning I'm happy to be on the other side of the room facing witnesses. Today's hearing doesn't have the legal and physical implications of a Congressional hearing, but it's a very important event for the Library of Congress and for the archival community generally, and indeed, for everyone who shares concern about preservation of our television legacy.\n\nOur first public hearing on this subject was held in Los Angeles on March 6th. The panel heard statements from archives, major studios and educators and others who share this concern over preservation. We heard encouraging reports from the major products of prime time programming because as commercial enterprises they have sufficient economic incentives to maintain their materials under reasonably good conditions, and thus insure availability for future use. On the other hand, we heard from smaller organizations with little or almost no resources to safeguard and preserve the valuable television video materials in their care.\n\nThis is the second of three public hearings that the Library of Congress is conducting this month and they're intended to develop a report on the current state of American television and video preservation and a plan listing recommendations. Both the report and the plan will be published later in the year as a single document. This activity is authorized under the American Television and Radio Act of 1976--20 years later; it takes a little while to get around to these things in Washington, as you may have heard. But it's being pursued in response to a recommendation more recently from the National Film Preservation Board, which is another Congressionally created body for which we have a responsibility at the Library of Congress, and also from the many groups and individuals who helped draft Redefining Film Preservation, A National Plan, which the Library of Congress published in 1994.\n\nNow the American Television and Radio Act of 1976 authorized the Library of Congress to establish and maintain archives whose purpose is to preserve a permanent record of the broadcast programs which are the heritage of the people of the United States and to provide access to such programs to historians and scholars without encouraging or causing copyright infringement. These hearings and the report to follow will help the Library develop and refine ATRA'S policies--that's the acronym for American Television and Radio Archive--to insure that we carry out our work in concert with the other archives and libraries, and with production and broadcast organizations.\n\nThese hearings and the report then parallel our earlier film preservation study in several important ways. First, we seek the same goals; that is, to preserve the American heritage. In this case, television and video, and make it more accessible for educational use. Second, to obtain a wide range of views and opinions representative of the diverse interest that exists in the creation, preservation and research use of moving images in all its aspects, including arts and entertainment, news and documentary, public affairs, video art, community video, just to name some of the largest categories. Thirdly, we wish to encourage other archives and libraries to work with the Library of Congress to accomplish the very difficult task of preserving television video and making them available. Fourth, we wish to address the problem of funding, television and video preservations programs, both in public archives and industry, no easy task at a time when resources are scarce, relative to the preservation workload ahead. Public and private partnerships are essential and during the course of these hearings we hope to receive your recommendations on how these kinds of partnerships can be established.\n\nThere are other parallels with the film preservation report worth mentioning. Like American film, much of the early history of television, as I am sure most of you aware has already been lost, broadcasts were live and kinescope or film recordings were used selectively, Ampex introduced a videotape recording technology in 1956, and since then the industry has manufactured or adopted numerous incompatible video formats making technological obsolence a major archival issue. Like nitrocellulose, the staple of the film industry until 1951, videotape has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. We've entrusted our historical and cultural images to videotape and yet it's vulnerable to degradation and destruction. Like film, everything associated with video preservation is expensive, including specialized storage facilities, electronic equipment, a skilled technical staff, and reformatting costs. The very notion of reformatting large collections of videotape is a daunting one because their volume already exceeds the means of most organizations.\n\nYet the rewards for safeguarding and preserving our television and video heritage are immeasurable, no one can fully understand who we are as a people and what we've become as a society without having access to the recordings created by television and video production during the last 50 years. Historians, sociologists and other scholars, even politicians and parents, debate the causal relationship of television to the society-at-large and the future of such debates will be fruitless if the historical evidence to pursue them does not survive.\n\nI might say as not just the Librarian of Congress who is responsible to the Congress of the United States but as somebody who has been a resident of Washington for nearly a quarter of a century, it's been amazing to watch how official Washington and all its aspects increasingly feels that it's either legitimize or de-legitimize as sustained, vindicated, elected, dis-elected, whatever, through this media, and therefore, it seems to me that the interest in it and the concern for how it functions, what its legacy is, is only going to increase. So this problem is one that is very much a part of coming to grips with what we are becoming as a nation in the second half of the 20th Century.\n\nSo in conclusion, the Library of Congress encourages all of you in the audience to write down your opinions and recommendations an we will collect them up to April 29th. We hope to hear from people in writing who don't have a chance to speak today, and today we will hear from a number of distinguished individuals, some professionals in the field, others representing important organizations, that share the goal of preserving American television and video and to which, as I say, we have a special responsibility under the Congressional mandate that we're pursuing here today.\n\nBefore we begin, I'd like to thank David Francis to my left, our admirable head of the Library's Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division, and a long-time pioneer in the preservation business on two continents--we're happy that he's on ours right now; and Steve Leggett, extraordinarily industrious, always self-effacing, in the back of the room back there, just does simply wonderful work for the Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division. I can't say too much for all they're doing. They're real saints in this pursuit of preserving this important part of our cultural heritage, and particularly for their work on this project.\n\nAnd most especially the man to whom I'm going to turn over the microphone, Bill Murphy, on loan from our sister institution, the Washington National Archives and Record of Administration, who is doing an admirable job serving as the project's coordinator, who will moderate today's hearing and to whom I'm pleased to turn over the microphone.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you, Dr. Billington. At this time I would like to introduce the members of the panel. You've already met David Francis. To my right is Dr. Erik Barnouw; and next Mona Jimenez, the executive director of the Media Alliance; and last but not least, Jim Lindner, president of Vidipax, Inc.\n\nAnd so let us begin, but before we go into the proceedings, let me state some of the ground rules for the discussion and testimony in the interest of moving the proceeding along expeditiously during the rest of the day.\n\nFirst, we will ask each panel to sit together at the witness table when it is their turn to speak. Second, the speakers will make their presentations in the order listed; and third, each speaker should take approximately ten minutes to give a statement. If you have a longer written statement, that too will be published in the record. If you exceed your time limit, I will try to let you know politely so that you can bring your statement to a conclusion. Fourth, please speak into the microphone so that you can be heard in the back of the room. Your statement and the discussion are being recorded and transcribed and you will receive a copy of the transcript for your review. Fifth, the Library of Congress panel will ask questions and make comments when each group of witnesses has completed their statements.\n\nI'm sorry we don't have enough time to accept questions or comments from the floor, from the audience; but I encourage all of you to send us written statements which will be considered in the report.\n\nThis is all I'm going to say, and so with that let us begin with our first witness, Mr. John Cannon of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Good morning, Mr. Cannon.\n\nMR. CANNON: Good morning. I am the president of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and first of all let me tell you about who we are. We do represent I think goodness, kindness and we are the embodiment of not-for-profit activity, we are statesmen of the industry; but putting all that aside, we have a remarkable structure. We represent virtually the entire United States. We represent about 95 per cent of television in the United States and the concrete evidence of that is that we make available local awards, local Emmy awards throughout the country. And it is our belief that television is not in New York and Los Angeles exclusively, that television really is people in many, many cities and many, many places, and we, because of our structure, can reach out.\n\nI want to talk to you this morning about thinking of preservation of television material, documentaries and recorded history throughout the United States rather than solely thinking about great shows that we all saw on network television. But of course, again by our structure, because we represent the Emmy, the Emmy is the terribly, terribly distinguished award. In the world, anywhere you go, everybody knows the Oscar, everybody knows the Emmy. Now there are very few awards like that. I can give you two or three, four more, but by and large other awards are--they're nice, they're somewhat conveniences for having dinners, and kind of warming up for the main event; but the only people unhappy about Emmys are those who don't win them. Everybody wants an Emmy. And you would have to sit in the office or run from the office, which I frequently like to do, about people calling and saying they should have won and Emmy and how unjust the world is. But putting that aside, we find that--maybe I shouldn't put it aside, but really I find it very flattering and it only emphasizes how truly great this Emmy is.\n\nSo when we talk about having archives, and this is something very, very good, this is the kind of thing we have a total commitment to at least philosophically, if we can't do it physically which I don't think we can do, but from the very creation of this Academy we have always been proponents of it and we have found that the educational world has been quite marvelous at this and the Academy, which began in Los Angeles and New York, began this kind of activity. I know I was president at one time of the New York Chapter and we had a very active relationship with NYU in preserving materials. But we found that from a national viewpoint that we couldn't possibly do anything meaningful. So we support all kinds of organizations that want to do this and I'm sure you're all aware of the very, very major commitment that the Museum of Radio and Television has, and they have a great deal of money and they just opened, if you saw in The New York Times yesterday, they opened a branch, $16 million in Beverly Hills. And I do know that Mr. Paley, who started this, I don't think he ever made the short walk which is only one block from what is called Black Rock, CBS, over to ABC, it's from 53rd Street to 54th Street, and he never made that walk, but he did one day decide he would go over and see Leonard Goldenson. So he made the walk, went up to see Leonard Goldenson, he said, \"Leonard, I want you to support something,\" and it was his museum. And it never stopped from that point on. I've never seen anything in our industry supported so widely and with such deep pockets as that museum. So what your relationship is with that, I don't know. I will ask you later on what it is.\n\nBut I would like to focus a bit on some of the things that we have done in our Academy and maybe that we can open up some windows here for your thinking. We had, oh, ten years ago, suggested that each of our chapters encourage their community--let's say Phoenix, Arizona--to establish an archival reposit of what had been the best of television in Phoenix. Now this concept I think has a lot of merit. We can now envision--we have 17 cities and regions which as I tell you covers most of the United States; but I think it's very interesting if you're in Miami to have a place you can go and see what has been the best of Miami television. And I can further see occasions where people would gather in the industry to review their industry and all that's been accomplished there. Cities do this, local television is very, very strong, and people who have made great contributions to television in all the local markets are honored. They're honored by our organization and other organizations. But this is a step further. It's not easy to do. I would also encourage them to send material to the museum; but I think maybe if the Congress, if the Library of Congress would do this, it would have more impetus, it would have more motivation. But I try to open, as I say, open new vistas for you here and I think this is something that I don't think you'll hear from anybody else, of the concept of how much material there is that only those people, generally speaking only those people in their own communities saw and were a part of. But that to me is very, very valid and it fulfills what television should be.\n\nWe feel that television is--the viewer should be the boss of television. The view is the one who makes all the decisions. And nobody forces anybody to watch anything. Television will never be, or when we say television today we mean all of broadcasting, the telecommunications, whether it be satellite cable--this is all one family, one experience really. But it is the viewer that sets the standard an all the viewer has to do is turn it off. And so television will never be better than the viewer demands it to be and the more we as an Academy, our dedication is to excellence, and we are constantly talking to the people in the community if we can and tell them to be as demanding as they can.\n\nWe have a project in the Academy called Creating Critical Viewers. This is to educate young people, the high school age, how to watch television. We don't want them to grow up and be couch potatos. So we have made a very major effort and invested very major money in this so that we now have in 17 chapters around the country, we have a paid administrator who does this, and we engage--each chapter engages somebody from the educational world who can communicate with the schools. Television people are good at communicating with the public in general, but they are not educators and they don't quite know how to get into that world. But this is evidence of what can be done, what can be done for the public, and I think that's what we should all think about and that's why we should preserve the best of telecommunications, the best of these efforts for the public, not for private collectors, but for those who can benefit for the most, so we have a true heritage to pass on. And we in the Academy can educate young people so that they come out with a critical eye. We think that's very good.\n\nAnd also it's very encouraging that the management, the station managers around the country encourage this. They do not find it a threat to their commercial profits. They agree that the better view they have, the better television they'll all do. There is no downside to doing good television and there's no downside to having a program that doesn't have a big audience either. In News and Documentary, Dr. Billington was a presenter at our News and Documentary Awards. PBS has always done very, very well in those awards because they dedicate the time to it. And on the commercial networks, sometimes we don't get as high quality, although that varies, there's some very high quality actually in the networks; but if you put aside every so often the profit motive and say what can we do that is the best for the public, it will happen.\n\nSo what we can do here by talking to you is see if we can give you some ideas and give you a feeling for the whole broad spectrum of television in the 50 States of the United States, with which we have a relationship.\n\nI thank you all, and first of all being here is annulus; but particularly to the Library and its effort, I think this is very timely and it's a step forward, and just couldn't be any more admirable. So I thank you very much for listening to my few words and I would be very pleased to talk to you and answer questions. Maybe I'll ask you some questions.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you very much, Mr. Cannon. Questions or comments? David?\n\nMR. FRANCIS: I was very interested in what you said about the idea, I think you used Phoenix as the example--\n\nMR. CANNON: Yes.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: --of selecting in the different chapters the programs which are important as far as that part of the country is concerned, because one of the big problems with television is there is so much of it and it's not all national.\n\nNow it seems that this idea could be developed by the Academy so that each area was deciding what they considered were the most important programs. I think that would be a very valuable service, and it could lead to those programs being preserved in that area. What do you think about this? How successful have you been so far?\n\nMR. CANNON: Well, it didn't quite work. These things take a great deal of incentive and effort. The fire has to build up, you know. I think though I'm very glad to hear what you say. I think that it's worth another try. Ten years ago when we advocated this, I don't think the Academy was doing all the good things it's doing now. We have a very major scholarship program now, we're giving two $20,000 scholarships and that's pretty good, because I look around and there aren't that many $20,000 scholarships being given out. Most scholarships are for $2,000 and that will buy you books maybe, or $5,000; but we decided to go into this in a very major way.\n\nThe reason I cite this is that atmospheres change and when people realize what can be done and we're doing these things, maybe this is another step we could take. I really think it's worthwhile. And if we could get a letter particularly from Dr. Billington, if I could get a letter saying we encourage this, this kind of encouragement would be a very good thing for us and might bring this to a meeting and that's the way these things start. We'd have to think out how this can trickle some place, as I wanted to do it with the museum, but I think they've got a pretty full plate over there. Maybe we can do this through you. But we need to have it go somewhere too, as well as--do you agree with that?\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Yes, certainly.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Jim?\n\nMR. LINDNER: You were mentioning the role of education in regard to your membership and there's no question that your membership is certainly the movers and shakers of the television industry in many regards, and I was wondering since the membership is so large whether the Academy has published any brochures or other information to help educate your members on how to take care of their materials?\n\nMR. CANNON: No. We never have. No, no. That has never been done and that would never be done because there is no program that would call for it. But again, that's a good idea.\n\nWhat we offer here is an availability if somebody wanted to do that, the Academy has the structure that allows for a lot of communication, if somebody wants to come along and do that. What better way for distribution than to use us. That might be a good joint effort with somebody.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Okay. Thanks again, Mr.--\n\nMR. CANNON: Dr. Barnouw, I wanted to--\n\nMR. MURPHY: Go ahead.\n\nMR. CANNON: As I was joking with Dr. Barnouw, I said that I read his book since I was three years old, he said I was very precocious when I did that, and I said but he wrote with such clarity, how does he know that I didn't? But I want to take a personal moment here to ask you, Professor Barnouw, of what you do now. Do you lecture still at Columbia? Are you still writing book? I'd like to know that.\n\nDR. BARNOUW: I'm not lecturing at Columbia. I've retired some 20 years ago.\n\nMR. CANNON: I know that, but I thought--\n\nDR. BARNOUW: I am still writing books, yes.\n\nMR. CANNON: All right.\n\nDR. BARNOUW: I don't want to make this a personal advertising program.\n\nMR. CANNON: Okay.\n\nDR. BARNOUW: Yes, I just published a book called \"The Media Marathon,\" essentially a memoir which goes to my life in all the media.\n\nMR. CANNON: I'll certainly be looking for that. It's a privilege to be here with you. Yes, Dr. Billington?\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: I was wondering if either the Academy or the museum, which you mentioned, you mentioned in connection with the museum deep pockets. One of the fundamental problems with preservation is that there are virtually no pockets at all.\n\nMR. CANNON: That's right.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: And I wondered if you had any thoughts as to how first of all you organization, which does have all the prestigious and important people in it, do either they or the museum have any systematic institutional stated commitment to the preservation of the television heritage or have there been any major meetings or pronouncements devoted to it? I just wondered as a matter of history.\n\nMR. CANNON: I would highly recommend and I think I mentioned to Mr. Murphy when he came to see me, I highly recommend that you meet with first of all Frank Bennick, who is the chairman of it, and he is the president and CEO of The Hearst Corporation, all of television and all of the newspapers too. I think that would be a very worthwhile visit for you to have. They are the ones who would have that kind of resource and, of course, that's what they are doing. They are preserving television. The Academy no, the Academy does not and I don't think it's likely that the Academy would get resources exclusively for that. Anything could happen, but for when we talk about financial wherewithal and also the structure and actually doing it, I'd say the museum would be my prime target if I were you.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: I see.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Bill, can I ask something? Could I ask one small follow-up? Do you actually manage to preserve the Emmy award programs, the programs to which you give the awards?\n\nMR. CANNON: Yes, we do. We keep, one way or another, when we do a--when we do a telecast, by our contract one copy of it comes to us. Generally the networks keeps a copy too, the networks keep copies of things like that.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: But the individual programs?\n\nMR. CANNON: No, not in--only winning programs or--well, for instance, News and Documentary, we get some marvelous material and it's so much of it that we call up schools and see if they can pick it up or we just have to throw it out. There's just not-- there aren't enough buildings to put all of this in. They are going to take all our news and documentary winning programs and preserve them. So we'd like to find more opportunities like that and we'll find another college, I think we can do it for sports, and this concept of having someone's resource for it--we like the schools, we think the schools are great at this and they give a lot of attention to it and it's very beneficial to them because students of the communications departments can refer to this material and it's quite wonderful.\n\nBut for an organization such as ours that has no many award structures and so many awards programs to do, our biggest problem is to clean out the shelves and keep it moving out of our premises. We can't find a building big enough to hold all that.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Cannon.\n\nMR. CANNON: Thank you.\n\nMR. MURPHY: I think in the interest of time we have to move on and thanks again.\n\nMR. CANNON: Thank you. I hope you have a very successful day and a very rewarding experience. It's quite admirable.\n\nMR. MURPHY: We've been informed that Kitty Carlisle Hart will be delayed, so we will move on to the next panel of educators and we'll ask those people to come and take a seat.\n\nWell, good morning to you, and let us begin with William Boddy.\n\nMR. BODDY: Thank you. I'm going to read a five-page statement, so I should be ten minutes.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you this morning about a subject, television preservation, which is crucial to the work of scholars and educators across many fields and many academic institutions. My words today will, I hope, build--\n\nMR. MURPHY: Excuse me, could you pull the microphone closer?\n\nMR. BODDY: Sure. My words today will, I hope, build upon previous testimony in Los Angeles from educators, including Janet Bergstrom who spoke as a representative from the Society for Cinema Studies, an organization I have been actively involved with for over a decade. I would first like to acknowledge the work of the Library of Congress in film preservation, including the hearings which produced a 1994 report, \"Redefining Film Preservation, A National Plan.\" I will defer to the expertise of others here and elsewhere who will speak to you on technical matters of physical preservation and legal practice; what I wish to add is simply the voice from a community of scholars and educators whose work would be immeasurably impoverished without access to the national heritage of television and video material.\n\nWhile occasionally arcane and technical sounding, the work of television and video preservation, I believe, serves to support nothing less than the fundamental need of citizens in a democracy to understand their collective past and to actively shape their own cultural and political futures. I'd like to address the four central issues of storage, access, public/private partnerships, and funding, from the point of view of someone who earns a living teaching and writing about the history of American television. To briefly introduce myself, my work in television history began with a doctoral dissertation at New York University, a dissertation which ended up as a book at the University of Illinois entitled Fifties Television. Since then I have contributed two dozen articles on U.S. broadcast history to scholarly journals and monographs in this country and abroad. The subjects of these have ranged from television broadcasting efforts by CBS and others in the early 1930s to the post-war programming strategies of NBC and CBS, the quiz show scandals of the late fifties, the TV violence campaigns of the early 1960s, the rise and fall of the classic television Western, the contested role of American television programming in the U.S. image abroad, and the history of independent video in the United States. I'm currently writing a book on the social history of electronic technology for Oxford University Press, as well as a book on The Twilight Zone for the British Film Institute's TV Classics Series.\n\nBefore turning to these larger questions of what we ought to be preserving, allow me first to direct some specific remarks to the four issues of storage, access, public/private partnership, and funding, which were raised in the Library of Congress's report on film preservation. While, it seems to me that these can, in large measure, be addressed in similar terms to those involved in film preservation, there are a number of novel aspects to the world of television preservation. Concerning storage, for example, I believe the Library can make an important contribution by supporting the research and dissemination of optimal methods for the preservation of original materials and the conversion of original materials to new storage media.\n\nIt might be noted that the term \"television preservation\" involves original materials ranging from 35mm and 16mm film stocks as well as a plethora of technologically obsolete or endangered electronic recording systems. Unlike theatrical filmmaking, where film formats and viewing technologies have remained remarkably stable historically, television demands the preservation of rapidly changing hardware systems as well as program material. It seems to me that the Library of Congress can lead in the sharing of expertise concerning these historically fragile technological platforms, in order to insure continued access to the programming they support. Likewise, the Library can pool technical expertise in the conversion of these technologically endangered television materials to more permanent and accessible electronic formats, with the recognition that any new formats are themselves likely to prove historically transient. Finally, as in film preservation, it seems to be prudent to pursue both the conservation of original materials and the conversion to new electronic storage systems. The problem of access to television and video materials presents similar continuities and exceptions to the model of film preservation. There are common goals in insuring the widest possible access for scholars and educators to television collections, in simplifying procedures for copyright clearances and fair use, in enabling remote access to information about the holdings of private and public archives, and finally in moving to direct electronic access to non- copyrighted television and video materials. These issues of access are likely to be more complex and vexing than the challenges of physical preservation and storage, and copyright holders need to be protected from unauthorized commercial exploitation of their work, a concern more urgent with the prospect of a commercial Internet trafficking in full motion video and sound.\n\nHowever, and this is the most deeply felt point I would like to make this morning, there is an urgent need to preserve the distinction between educational and commercial uses of television and video archive material, and with that distinction, the practice of fair use of copyrighted material by scholars and educators, whether for research, classroom instruction, presentations at professional conferences or scholarly publication. The Library of Congress could encourage archives to devise donor agreements to maintain this fundamental distinction in order to insure access by scholars to copyrighted deposit material. Issues of copyright may be more complex in television than in film; unlike the model of the studio feature film, networks and station operators rarely own copyrights for the works they broadcast, outside of news and sports. Copyright is more often held by individual production companies operating in an unstable business marked by a rapid turnover of firms.\n\nRegarding issues of private/ public partnerships and the funding of television preservation, copyright owners must, I think, assume the major responsibility for insuring the physical preservation of, and scholarly access to, their television and video material. However, the Library of Congress can support these efforts by sharing information about the storage and transfer of primary materials and by encouraging and coordinating remotely accessible databases of archive holdings. Public efforts should also be extended to support the preservation of vulnerable television and video material which is either outside of copyright or which lacks immediate commercial prospects for its copyright holder. A public/private partnership in the form of a federally chartered foundation could also support efforts to preserve the diverse voices of artists and independent video makers whose television work may exist in endangered video formats and equally endangered non-profit institutions.\n\nI would like to conclude by speaking not of a ten most-wanted list of disappeared programs, but more generally about the special challenges of television and video preservation in deciding upon what is worthy of preservation. It is clear that television archives confront a fundamental challenge in their collective task; unlike the preservation of the collection of unique one-run theatrical films, the basic definition of a television artifact can be confounding. In the commercial television medium, which thrives on various forms of seriality, ought one to collect series pilots, or some sense of representative episodes, or entire seasons, or multi-year runs of a particular series? Even compared to the thousands of American feature film of the Hollywood era, the universe of television material potentially available for archiving is staggering, even more so in view of the on-going proliferation of program outlets via direct broadcast, satellite, cable, and broadcasting. Despite this multiplication of program sources, many of them recycling material from previous seasons, meaningful scholarly access to television's past cannot be insured to commercial syndication and to advertising supported cable, no matter how single-mindedly devoted to various forms of nostalgia they may be.\n\nThere is a host of contingencies which determines the entrance and survival of any particular network program in the syndication market, ranging from the original program genre and number of episodes, to the commercial and ideological needs of the current commercial programmer and broadcast advertiser. Television lacks film's cultural memory bank of the repertory cinema or the video shop, and In an understanding of television's role in our nation is impossible without scholarly access to a much wider universe of program materials than those of interest to the demographically minded programmers at Nick at Nite or The Family Channel.\n\nGiven this situation, let me offer an historian's plea for the preservation of the widest range of television material. Invaluable public institutions like the Museum of Television and Radio have taken on the dual task of both celebrating that which it judges of highest quality in the medium and also of assembling a collection which will illuminate television's role as cultural and political agenda- setter and battleground. However, historians need access not only to the prestigious prime time network hits, but also to less celebrated television material, from low prestige genres, from affiliate fringe time, from independent and community stations, and from the chaotic world of small format video and public access cable.\n\nMy own scholarly interests have been directed at understanding the role of television programming in wider cultural, intellectual and political contexts, including the shifting definitions of citizenship and the public sphere, the relation of American intellectuals to mass culture, the policy debates regarding broadcast regulation, the effects of television violence, and the international role of American commercial television. Addressing these sorts of questions in an historical context in a meaningful way is not likely to be accomplished by looking at a few critically privileged programs. Instead, understanding how commercial television became entangled in such larger cultural and political issues requires a broad consideration of as many relevant programs as possible; a consideration only possible with access to the resources of private and public television archives.\n\nMuch of the most productive recent historical work in film and television studies has indeed focused on the culturally marginal and excluded, guided in part by the proposition that what a society pushes to the margins of cultural expression can say a great deal about what is central to its beliefs and practices. Television preservation, therefore, must make available to future researchers and scholars the full range of what is to be found on our nation's screens. Likewise, future historians considering some of today's loudest public and political controversies associated with television, like the debates over the effects of negative political advertising or the cultural consequences of so-called trash TV, will depend on their access to the often culturally denigrated programs which provoked these controversies. My point is simply that contemporary critical taste cannot offer assurance about what future historians will find revealing about our contemporary culture, and absence such assurances, the prudent course seems to be to try to preserve the diversity of our television environment.\n\nThe challenges of preservation and access to the uncountable hours of our television past and present, a medium of both great cultural and political power and of an almost willful ephemorality, are indeed daunting. While my life in the classroom exposes me to students who bring what seems to be increasingly short cultural memories, there is also a genuine hunger among students and among the public for non-nostalgic confrontations with our cultural history. As television increasingly becomes the medium for historical representation and popular memory, it is vital that its own place in history be available for scrutiny and contestation. The often unglamorous work of television preservation is the necessary ground for such democratic interrogation and we neglect it at our peril. Thank you.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you, Mr. Boddy. I think we're going to skip Peter Herford for now and go on to Deirdre Boyle. Good morning.\n\nMS. BOYLE: Thank you very much. Thank you for inviting me to speak here today at this hearing. Others will make the case for why broadcast television news and entertainment programming need to be preserved. Rather than add to that resounding chorus, I will simply say that growing up in the '50s, as a member of the first television generation, I responded actively to television. At 12 I appeared on a local children's show to speak out about my gripe, that children should be seen and not heard. Arguing persuasively I believed at the time, that children would never grow up to be effective citizens and responsible adults if they were prevented from expressing their thoughts and testing their ideas; I exercised the power of television to shape public opinion. I thought we all had that right, that that was what television was there for.\n\nBecause television has not always served as an arena for public discourse and creative expression, members of my generation when presented with the first consumer video technology in the late '60s responded by setting out to re-invent television, to create a parallel system to the then monolithic world of network TV. They were inspired by the ideas of Marshall McLuhan and other media gurus; by the social and political movements sweeping the country at the time-- and the world I should add; and by a revolution in the arts that celebrated process, not product.\n\nSome of the most talented members of that first TV generation joined video collectives, not broadcast unions, producing lively video programs seen in Soho lofts, public library basements, community centers, on public access channels, in alternative art spaces, off-off Broadway theaters, and later on, on public television, network TV and eventually pay cable. It was independent video pioneers like TVTV, working outside the industry, who first brought the portapak to a major media event, the 1972 Presidential Nominating Conventions. TVTV demonstrated the versatility of portable video to networks still hardwired to cumbersome quad equipment, propelling the development of the first ENG cameras and the quick transition from vid-film to all-video news departments, and aesthetically influencing the look of television news and documentary programming. Without a consideration of the contributions of video pioneers such as these, any history of American television, not to mention recent American social history, will be incomplete, distorted.\n\nThe achievements of video artists and documentarists, many of whom worked within the experimental TV labs at public television stations during the '70s and '80s, are co-extensive with television but go far beyond it. Artists like Nam Jun Paike, for instance, produced single and multiple channel video works using video as a sculptural medium, creating environments never designed with television in mind. The task of preserving such art work is perhaps more daunting than tackling single-channel videotapes, but no less important if accurate records of the cultural history of the last half of this century are to be made.\n\nMy own area of research, the history of documentary video makers in the '70s, led me in 1983 on a cross-country journey in search of historic tapes and their makers. This was my first brush with the already alarming state of video preservation. In New Orleans, I excitedly located a tape I had read about and heard about, only to discover as I opened the black plastic box, a sickeningly sweet smell emanating from the encrusted white crud that covered the unplayable tape. The New Orleans Video Access Center had been inundated and their tape archive, housed in the basement, was badly affected. It was only one of many such disappointments encountered while researching: tapes mislabeled, tapes missing, tapes that played for five minutes then devolved into a series of morse code like black-and-white glitches, tapes made on machines that were unrepairable or nowhere to be found. Housed in garages, basements, in closets and footlockers, the precious record of an historic period lay vulnerable to fire, flood, heat, humidity, carelessness and indifference.\n\nI was part of the first wave of video historians, critics and curators who uncovered the array of preservation problems confronting individual artists, media art centers, video distributors, funders and exhibitors. Since then I'm happy to report progress has been made in launching this vast effort at locating historic programs, cataloguing them, providing archivally acceptable storage for these tapes and their playback equipment, developing reliable, low-cost methods for cleaning, restoring, and preserving tapes, and sharing information with others similarly engaged. All sorts of partnerships have been forged. Time prevents me from enumerating them, but in a monograph that I wrote a few years ago for the Media Alliance, Video Preservation: Securing the Future of the Past, I did outline some of this. The very fact that the Library of Congress has agreed to this hearing and to a serious inclusion of video and television programming within its preservation purview, is perhaps the best sign that the times are a-changing.\n\nClearly there are economic incentives that motivate broadcasters' interests in the preservation of classic entertainment programs and the archiving of broadcast news and public affairs programming. But economic reasons should be the least compelling ones when deciding video preservation priorities. Consider, for example, the tapes made by Broadside TV, a unique experiment in local origination cable programming produced by community video activists in Appalachia in the mid-'70s. Although the characters who appear in these tapes are not household names like Lucy or Uncle Walter, they helped extend the concept of oral history to video and gave isolated people living in the hills and hollers of Appalachia a tool to confront strip miners, state legislators, and future generations. From the viewpoint of the social historian, the student of American politics, communications and culture, the value of such tapes is immeasurable, and I'm happy to report that this collection is housed in the Archives of Appalachia in Tennessee.\n\nHere's one more scenario to consider. I think few people here would argue that Ken Burns' documentary series on the American Civil War was a signal broadcasting event. By coupling early photographic images--daguerro tintypes, carte-de-visite photos--with readings from the letters and diaries of both famous and ordinary ordinary individuals, Burns evoked the agony of a nation divided. His success depended upon the official documentary photos of battle scenes or of commanders-in-chief shot by artists like Matthew Brady, as well as anonymous portraits of raw recruits produced two for 12-1/2 cents. Burns employed the full range of photography, a visual medium barely 30 years old at the time.\n\nImagine if you will now a documentary producer 100 years from now who is interested in making a documentary about the recent Gulf War. She would need to have access to videotapes; not just to those broadcast as news by CNN or NBC, but those exchanged by military personnel and their families during the war. It was during this war that home video became a favored medium for the intimate exchange of ideas, images and memories, absorbing the functions of photography, letters and diaries. These homemade tapes were just as much a part of the war record as the orchestrated image of high-tech electronic war seen on television.\n\nSince videotapes have come to replace snapshots, audio tapes, Super 8 films, letters, and even written diaries for reporting the milestones of our lives, video has become the fabric of our family memories and by extension of our collective social history. We in this room know that video has a limited lifespan. The manufacturers of videotape and recording technology know this, too; but the millions of people who own handicams and record Billy's birthday party, Jennifer's soccer game, and the children's wedding on tape don't know that their precious memories will fade in time to mere snow on a flickering screen.\n\nWhat does this mean to a culture that has become increasingly dependent on visual images for its self-image, its view of the world, and its understanding of what is and isn't true? What does this mean if our databanks of images, those public and collective as well as those private and personal, fade into oblivion? I would argue that, without evidence of the past to re-examine and reconsider, we become increasingly vulnerable to the spin doctors of history who reshaped the past to serve other agendas. The entire spectrum of video recordings, from those professionally recorded for cultural institutions like network television, to those made by you and me to memorialize the events of our lives, demands our attention and concern. Were the public to realize just what is at risk if video as a medium is dismissed as ephemeral or someone else's concern, we would have a considerable lobby behind us and this enterprise.\n\nAnd my last comment is really made as an educator. When I completed the book that I had been working on for 13 years and heaved a sigh of relief, I gave it to my graduate assistant to read to find out how well I was communicating to someone who was born the very year that video and man first went to the moon. Needless to say, Alex was not very conscious of video during the period of time that is the subject of my book. I was gratified that he was very enthusiastic about what I had written and surprised at his amazement to discover that what I had to say about the '60s and the '70s was so different from what he had learned elsewhere in this culture. Bell-bottoms and peace signs and rock music of the period, was pretty much the lingering image of this time for him; and he is a very intelligent and sensitive person. We had a very interesting dialogue, and I shared a number of these tapes with him, and it convinced me that there was indeed a reason to make the images of this time period available to younger people. But more importantly, what really struck Alex was the sense of optimism that pervaded this time period, an optimism that was so much a part of my generation and that is not a part of his generation, a sense that one can change the world, that it is indeed the legacy of youth to feel empowered and to believe that it is possible to make a difference. And I think if for no other reason than this, making these historic materials available is necessary and perhaps increasingly a necessary counter-measure if we are to have a really vital society. Thank you.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you very much. Is Peter Herford in the room? Questions from the panel?\n\nMS. JIMENEZ: I have one.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Yes, Mona?\n\nMS. JIMENEZ: Yes, I was wondering if you could describe a little bit more about access to the materials, in addition to the physical problems that you were experiencing. Where do you actually find particularly independently produced video materials? Where do you find them--either one of you actually-- through what kinds of networks and what obstacles do you face in finding the materials?\n\nMR. BODDY: You're probably more expert on this.\n\nMS. BOYLE: Well, let's differentiate the act of researching and searching for things in the highways from the by-ways. As an educator I turn first to non- profit video distributors like Electronic Arts Intermix and Video Data Bank and a few sources like that, because given the infrastructure within the independent media community, distributors have taken on the role of maintaining, keeping alive, cataloguing, and otherwise making accessible the history of independent production.\n\nThere has been something of a bias toward art over documentary because art often seems to have a longer life than documentary works. There are other places to turn. I'm not sure if Media Network still has their information service, but it has been a source for locating more fugitive materials like documentaries that haven't always been seen as financially lucrative in terms of distribution. I think that people wind up having to read a great deal in order to find other sources.\n\nMR. BODDY: I would add that Electronic Arts Intermix, Video Data Bank, the Museum of Modern Art all have very active circulating collections. In terms of day-to-day teaching, those are the three sources I've used. They also do a very good job in documenting material, providing lots of information, bibliographies on artists and tapes, and are very forthcoming about allowing student access to material not for classroom use.\n\nIn New York City, the Donnell Film Library, and to a small extent the Museum of Television and Radio, collects and holds this sort of independent work. And I agree that there is a bias toward film or video about artists rather than in community activism and documentary.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Dr. Billington?\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: One of the things with film we've done is that--well the Congress has done really-- is to create this National Film Registry whereby we pick 25 sort of films for their historical, cultural, aesthetic significance every year, and that's designed to dramatize the need and also to pick out some important illustrative examples for preservation. Do you think something comparable would be possible and useful in the world of television, and related to that is the literature, the academic literature, does it provide a sufficient base of sort of shared critical standards that would enable one to pick such in this much more, in a way miscellaneous and diverse world of television, 25 such or some other number; we found that to be particularly I think a useful way of dramatizing the need for film preservation. Would it be--we always say at the time, it's my responsibility ultimately to pick these on the base of the board's recommendations, of course, and a lot of public input. We always say that it's not the Academy Awards, these are not the Academy Awards, but these are historically, culturally and aesthetic significance, that's the word that the Congressional Act has produced.\n\nDo you think it's possible to define such a universe and is it desirable to dramatize the cost of preservation?\n\nMR. BODDY: I think that the National Film Registry has had a good effect in the film studies community, particularly because it's obvious that you've looked beyond the Hollywood feature film with the major grosses or the critical successes of a particular year, and broadened the definitions and the cultural memory of film. I think it also provides a kind of window on the work of film preservation. I think those two aspects are important for the task of widening our definitions of television and television's past, especially about recovering the stuff that isn't an Emmy-award winning show, that wasn't aired on a network, that nevertheless may have had an incredible historical impact. So I think that designating a broad range of television material, to have something that was very mainstream and very prominent alongside something like TVTV or something from that independent community, would be very helpful.\n\nThe other part of the registry program, using public screenings to reinvigorate the theatrical film experience, I don't know if there is an analogy with the work of television preservation. And certainly the basic task of designating, of wading through and coming up with 25 or 75 titles, in television is a bit more daunting.\n\nBut I think the positive aspects of making the work of preservation more visible and of broadening the cannon, of redefining what it is to think about television, I think that would help.\n\nMS. BOYLE: To answer the second part of your question about is there a body of literature extant, I think there is more and more being written and our efforts are somewhat symptomatic of that. But I think that in order to make a selection of titles to preserve, you would have to assemble a body of experts from a fairly wide frame of reference because there are overlapping areas of expertise, but then there are other areas of expertise that don't overlap at all. And there would be considerable contention I think within, say, the wider community of independent video-- perhaps it's not all that different from looking at the tribes within the film community. I think one would have to throw a very wide net.\n\nAnd it may be worth considering in this larger debate criteria around endangered programs rather than only significant programming, or at least to give them some sort of equal status. With film, the problems of nitrate preservation created priorities. With video, I think urgency is less easily defined technically, but there are certainly works that are becoming unretrievable as time passes and there may be some need to factor that into decisions. But like Bill, I would agree to anything that gets public attention: if it's a list, and lists do tend to get people's attention, then by all means, use whatever will work.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Really, this is a follow-up on that question. Obviously the Library itself can only do so much. One of the things we're hoping that will come out of these hearings and out of the study is that we can engage the whole community more in dealing with these problems.\n\nWe've heard both here and in L.A. of the importance of particularly non-broadcast television to the academic community. Would it be possible for say S.C.S. to come up with a listing of key items, even if it only contains 200 or 500, not currently available which the academic community would like to have, so that the final plan could address some specific programs. Obviously there's a rights issue here as well, but if it was possible for say S.C.S. or any other body to come up with this endangered television list of material that would be widely used if it was available, I think this would be a very valuable step forward because it would give us something concrete which we could concentrate on. Do you think that's a feasible approach?\n\nThe second part of the question is do you think if there was agreement over this list, that the academic community itself in order to have these materials available, would be prepared to assist in some small way in preserving and making available the programs, subject obviously to copyright owner's agreement?\n\nMS. BOYLE: Even though I'm wearing my academic hat here, I wear several others, including that of a curator and a writer and someone who's been involved in other aspects of the independent media community. I think that there are certainly good reasons to go with an organization like S.C.S. in making these choices. But I think it leaves out some of the key players, for example, curators in museums, and the people who have been directors and producers within media arts organizations. While academics may have interests in this area or even have close ties, I think that there would be some problem in having the full breadth of independent media necessarily represented in their choices. Perhaps I'm being overly cautious here, but I think I'm a little reluctant to endorse the idea of turning it over to one academic group.\n\nMR. BODDY: Yes, I think that's appropriate. I think it's a good idea and I think that S.C.S. could collaborate with other people. I think those voices are important to bring to that question. So I'll bring it back to S.C.S. people.\n\nMS. BOYLE: The other part of your question about whether academic institutions would be willing to lend an economic hand in this matter--I don't know about other academic institutions, but my own doesn't lend economic hands to its own faculty. So I think that one has to then look to large institutions, and perhaps there is an advantage in creating partnerships with well-endowed institutions that permit public access to their collections. But I don't know if it's realistic to expect that this is going to be an overwhelming response.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thanks very much. We're now going to invite Miss Kitty Carlisle Hart to the witness table. Good morning.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: Good morning. Hello. Any one of these microphones will do?\n\nMR. MURPHY: Right in front of your name plate.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: I see. Now we all know who I am. This is indeed a welcome opportunity to speak to this distinguished panel. The issue of television and video preservation is dear to me personally, as Chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts, because as you probably know--\n\nMR. MURPHY: Excuse me, could I ask you to pull the microphone a little closer? Yes, that's good. Thank you.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: As you probably know, I spent quite a long time in my life in television. I was on a program called To Tell the Truth for about 17 years and I care a great deal about television. It's turned every town into a small town for me, because people come toward me smiling and they remember me from To Tell the Truth and other shows long before that. So I'm a veteran of Goodson/Todman and the early television, so this is something that I care about.\n\nNow speaking in my role as chairman of the New York State Council--can you hear me now? Good. Perhaps a bit of history will clarify why the Council is concerned about television and video preservation.\n\nThe Council was an early and ardent supporter of independent video. As early as 1966, the Arts Council had already helped experimental artists present video in a variety of performances and exhibitions. I remember the early performances and exhibitions on television, and let me tell you, they were pretty experimental. It was almost incomprehensible, but it was something, and it was the wave of the future, and my people at the Council said we've got to go for it, and I believed them, so we went for it.\n\nIn 1969, the New York State Council on the Arts provided a grant to start a series of video production networks for young people with the public television stations around the state. When the Council budget increased in 1970, sadly it's decreased remarkably, video flourished, community video centers were established across the state from Buffalo to Port Washington. Other groups emerged to explore the creative potential of the medium and put it in the hands of performing and visual artists. A study was commissioned to create the television lab at WNET, which was really very important.\n\nThis was a time of tremendous possibility and experimentation. Artists like Nam June Paik and Shirley Clarke were creating a new artistic medium. With small investment public funds, we created a weekly rural cable series in the Catskills and in Jamestown. Partnerships with public television brought the arts home to homes throughout the state and around the country. Innovative documentaries were being produced in ways not possible for film.\n\nIn the early 1980s the Council was funding over 80 organizations involved in video in New York State. Hundreds of productions had already been created and the Council was not alone in its investment in independent video. Other public funding agencies, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, public television, arts councils in many other states, were deeply involved in funding production and acquisition of this work.\n\nIn the next few years we would hear from museums and from distributors that their collections needed to be transferred to another video format. In a very limited way, the Council began to assist in the conservation of videotapes at the Museum of Modern Art and in the collections of several distributors. The Council felt that it was vital that the work continued to be available to the public in the present and also, obviously, for the future.\n\nWhere are all these tapes today? Very little is in traditional archives. Work of the most influential community workshops is stored in barns, attics, public library stacks. A few organizations have made heroic efforts in providing safe haven to whole collections, like the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester. A variety of institutions, scholars and curators are coming forward to assure that the very different creative uses of video are catalogued, conserved, and brought to the attention of the public. Working with Media Alliance, the Council has helped bring these organizations and individuals together to share their knowledge and foster collaborative efforts. Deborah Silverfine, the director of our electronic media and film program, will be submitting a statement of our activities, along with some recommendations for future plans.\n\nTo touch on some of our efforts, the Council has provided some support for cataloguing so that regional and specialized collections are reflected in the NAMID database being created. The Council has funded both lab costs and storage space, but it can't do it alone. It's not possible. The problem is far too big. We hope that the study being undertaken by the Library of Congress will point toward new partnerships, new solutions, and increased awareness of television and video preservation needs. And, so much of our contemporary culture and our history is being recorded on video by choice or by necessity, it is critical that we find ways for those images and sounds to endure.\n\nHave you any questions? It's quite a large subject. We all have a lot of questions.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Miss Hart, the achievements of the Council are well-known and are incredible. It's very sad to hear that funding is more difficult now than it was in the past.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: Oh, much.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: We heard when we were in Los Angeles from one of the people in Florida who said that Florida is operating a state lottery which gives a certain amount of money towards film and television activities. I wondered whether New York State had considered this; and whether you thought it was a feasible approach? You're aware probably of what's happening in the United Kingdom at the moment, that the lottery there is providing a resurgence of funding for all aspects of the arts. I wondered whether on a state level here, and particularly in a state like New York, this was a feasible approach to rebuilding funding?\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: The only time a lottery was approached to me by the lottery director Mr. Quinn was to do a lottery for the arts, and it died aborning, it didn't last very long. It was not properly publicized, it was not taken up properly, and it didn't quite work out. That's the only time. I've always opposed a lottery because I felt that the minute we had a lottery in this state, then the state would stop funding the arts, because they would say you're getting it this way, so we're not going to do it, and I wasn't sure that it would work.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Thank you.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: I have someone here named Debbie Silverfine, who is head of our electronic media and film, and she's very good about answering questions, if you want to ask any technical questions.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: Let me ask a non-technical question. First of all, thank you very much for being here.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: Delighted to see you again.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: For all the wonderful work you've done over the years, which would be impossible to fully document, but some day it's going to obviously become part of our--not merely New York, but our national history.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: Thank you.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: So we're really honored and pleased to have you. But as a public personality, how do you feel--this is a very non-technical question, but a rather essential one, perhaps second only to funding and perhaps even more important--how does one, someone who's been extraordinary successful in relating to the broader public and yet at the same time maintaining your own very high standards, how does an issue like this get across to the public? I mean the public watches television, but I've never seen an announcement on television saying could you help; we have phone-a- thons for everything else. Is there some way that television itself could contribute to its own preservation?\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: If you've been watching television, you will realize that not only would they not be interested, they're not interested in decent, first-class programming. I hope the press is here. I find the whole television spectrum a disgrace and I find that my friends only watch news, one or two programs, WNET, CNN, and some of the cable things like history; but it has fallen into total disrepute and the standard is so much lower than when I first came into television, that it is a disgrace.\n\nSo to ask a television studio to even understand what video, public or experimental television is, I don't know how you would get it across to them. I despair.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: But how then does one communicate about this to the general public? Surely it would be helpful in terms of the general, national consciousness of television to have a little more full knowledge of the richness and variety of what has actually already been achieved, albeit small ways and in various peripheral ways to the main enterprise perhaps. But that would seem to be all the more important for getting a broader range of the television experience preserved and made public. How does one dramatize the importance of that if television itself can't help?\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: I agree. I think that's absolutely true. The only thing I can think of is some cable stations that might be more open to this kind of suggestion. The networks certainly are not. But cable is beginning to come into its own, as you know even CBS and NBC are going into cable and there will be stations that will be interested, I'm sure. And one has to find them, you have to--we have to go after that. It's a very good idea.\n\nDebbie, where are you? Why don't you come up here and tell us what you think?\n\nMS. SILVERFINE: I think I'm not invited to speak today, but I will write them a statement.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: What do you think could be done to broaden the spectrum?\n\nMS. SILVERFINE: I'm Deborah Silverfine, I'm the director of electronic media--\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: I've explained.\n\nMS. SILVERFINE: --fine. We will be submitting some recommendations. But if we do find any partners who can make the plea, really do help us, and I think the work that American Movie Classics has done about raising the consciousness of the issues of film preservation are very helpful for the American public. And, they can be doing even more, talking about various aspects like the role of sound in film, the documentary, etc. And I think they might be one of our partners actually in bringing this consciousness to the fore about television history.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: Who is they in this case?\n\nMS. SILVERFINE: They, meaning the cable stations that repackage earlier programming. I agree with Mrs. Hart that we need to look to our public television stations and a number of the cable stations, and I think the networks might be more helpful if called on the right way. They will be important partners in this effort, because that's where people watch television.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Speaking of the networks, we do have to move on to the next panel.\n\nMS. SILVERFINE: They're up next.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: They're up next? Oh, good, I'll stay and listen.\n\nMR. MURPHY: I want to thank you very much for your statement.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: Thank you.\n\nMR. MURPHY: And please do stay and listen.\n\nMS. CARLISLE HART: I'm delighted to have had the chance to meet you all, and my friends again. Thank you.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Can the Broadcasters Panel A please take the witness table?\n\nGood morning to everyone. We'll start with Mr. Singer from NBC. Good morning, Stan.\n\nMR. SINGER: Good morning. I have a brief statement, just sort of a general overview. I'll be happy to answer any questions on what we're doing afterwards.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Could you speak closer to the microphone please?\n\nMR. SINGER: Yes, I will move it closer.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you.\n\nMR. SINGER: I'm Stan Singer, I'm the manager of the NBC News Archives. The NBC News Archives is responsible for preservation of news film and videotape, archival databases, film and tape libraries and warehouses worldwide for NBC News. NBC News has relied on its archives as a support mechanism for over 50 years. What began as a way of keeping a collection of major news events became a way to present broadcasts in a cost-efficient manner. If one show shot an image, a second show was not required to send a camera crew out to record it again if the archives could turn a clean, well-preserved copy quickly. Needless to say, our images are used every day, in every news show that airs on NBC. We also feel this great responsibility towards keeping the recorded history of this country during the second half of the 20th Century.\n\nAdditional attention has been focused on the collection, heightened by the rise of the number of our outlets, including the NBC Super Channel in Europe and the Microsoft joint venture. Cable and the Internet are just two growth areas that could produce an unlimited number of access points for the consumer. The problem is there is not an equal amount of programming to go with it; thus, the archives provides NBC with enormous flexibility to produce high-quality programs at a reasonable cost. But this new world is also fraught with perils for archives and I'll talk about that in a second.\n\nThe NBC News Archives is currently involved in a number of special projects to improve our collection. We've spent two years designing a powerful new database that will allow NBC personnel to perform sophisticated searches on the editorial content of the archives via visual write-ups, transcripts, and key words. They will be able to view or hear digitized portions of the collection and place electronic orders for the original material to our libraries and warehouses around the globe. We are designing a new facility to allow better climate controlled storage for our film and tape, as well as offering us the ability to separate duplicate copies of our broadcasts to prevent catastrophic loss.\n\nFor the past three years we've been transferring our oldest tape formats. Our two-inch tapes will be completely transferred to an analog and digital copy by the end of the year. Shortly we will begin the enormous task of transferring our 3/4-inch cassettes. The reason why these are the first on our list of preservation items are two-fold. The two-inch tape, though generally of good quality, will no longer have the hardware to play back in a very short amount of time. While there is an abundance of 3/4-inch hardware, these tapes have shown the most dramatic decay of any portion of our collection. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan are rapidly fading. This does not mean that other tape formats are much better; all videotape will require transfer in the not-too-distance future. This will present, as the previous speaker mentioned, an enormous crisis for the country and the world if we broaden the scope to include all consumer videotape that's in everyone's possession.\n\nThe digital era may help all this and I certainly will be the first to cheer when we leave the videotape era. But there's also this peril. We are feeling our way through the new mediums. In the process, the focus has been on producing, not preserving. What will happen to all those web sites? What will be a cost-effective way of archiving cable channels? What will be compatible to what? There are many ideas as to what is digital and many hope that computer and television meld together into one great unified and standardized entity.\n\nBut there is also the chance that the climate that produced the two-inch and the 3/4-inch videotape will simply repeat itself. During that period, the old medium film was being replaced by the first videotape, but that two-inch tape was too expensive and most was recorded over as a cost savings. This is similar to what we hear about high quality digital disks. Then other formats developed, some better than others, some that failed rather quickly, just like what's happening now. Libraries became splintered as different groups controlled their own formats. Much was lost because production groups did not focus on preservation. Much was lost when experimental formats were abandoned. Much was lost because hardware evolved. All the while, new information came pouring in and new ways with ever greater volume.\n\nAll these scenarios are occurring today and it's important that the Library take a leadership role. For you to set the standards of how best to preserve all tape formats and to keep a storehouse of the hardware, as well as the cassettes. Beyond this, the Library must anticipate the results of this next revolution and try to assist in setting guidelines for retention of all that is being produced in non- traditional ways, with multiple digital hardware and software formats, and to work towards a unified digital format, and to best determine how to save all the 24- hour per day streams of information.\n\nWe will face this at NBC and then much more, and we look forward to working with the Library and others in the field in sharing our experience.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you. Mr. Lang?\n\nMR. LANG: Thank you. In June of 1993, the senior corporate management of ABC gave its enthusiastic support to a project intended to ensure that the network's vast archive of own video material would be preserved. In the over two and a half years--\n\nMR. MURPHY: Closer to the microphone please?\n\nMR. LANG: In the over two and a half years since then, representatives from ABC News, Sports, Entertainment and broadcast operations and engineering, have worked together to build the foundation of what eventually will be a unified network film and tape archive carefully houses, properly maintained, and consistently indexed. The magnitude of this task is daunting. ABC now holds approximately one million separate reels and cassettes of network-owned material, most but not all of it news footage.\n\nAt the time we began contemplating the creation of a unified archive, these massive holdings had long been balkanized into different collections, located in different places, operated by different divisions or departments, catalogued in different ways and to different standards, and stored with different levels of care. Even worse, we soon realized that some unknown percentage of this material was in danger of being lost.\n\nFor example, during preparation for a retrospective Barbara Walters special, a number of field tapes were retrieved from storage for viewing as possible source material. Damage caused by adhesives once used in the assembly of reels was discovered on one important interview tape; other two-inch and even newer one-inch reels were found to be dirty, brittle and flaking; and there was mysterious warping damage that caused tracking problems on an interview tape that was only seven years old. It soon became obvious that no easy fix for this problem would be forthcoming. Even with all our resources, we could find no technological Heracles capable of quickly cleansing these, our video Augean stables.\n\nInstead, ABC Broadcast Operations and Engineering, the technical arm of the network, proceeded to design and construct the ABC Media Conservation Facility (the MCF) which is exclusively dedicated to the on-going process of preserving the network's videotape assets. Attached to our written submission is a description of the MCF prepared by David Chilson, the engineer who designed it. But I would like to briefly discuss in general terms both the facility and the way it works.\n\nThe physical space, approximately 2,000 square feet, is divided into two basic functional areas: one for screening and the other for dubbing. The screening area, which is not yet operational, will be where representatives from ABC News, Sports and Entertainment preview, when appropriate, endangered tapes in order to determine whether any of the existing material need not be dubbed to fresh stock. For example, unlike film, videotape cameras are often rolling several minutes before a newsmaker arrives at the podium or in the doorway, and sometimes reporters doing \"stand-uppers\" don't get it \"right\" the first time. When multiplied by the myriad of news field cassettes in the ABC inventory, excising repetitive shots of unoccupied podia or pre-occupied reporters may in the end save thousands of hours of dubbing time, which translates into hundreds of thousands of dollars in materials and labor costs. The costs of raw stock alone is almost $100 an hour: $75 for D-2 and $25 for beta oxide one hour cassettes.\n\nIn the dubbing area of the MCF, in order to satisfy operating requirements as well as meet our obligation to insure the long-term preservation of valuable material, two copies of each endangered tape are being made: an analog beta copy and a digital D-2 copy. Each fresh beta copy is returned to the shelves of the working library from which it was plucked, and the D-2 copy, the long-term archival storage copy, will be placed in an appropriate facility either on or off the company's premises, where it can quietly reside until another working copy is required.\n\nDuring our initial planning process, all parties had agreed that the deteriorating copy, once it had been dubbed afresh, could be discarded. Even a mildly skeptical observer, however, might easily conclude that only the intense pressure of overflowing shelves will force this cleansing the deaccession to occur.\n\nAlthough D-2 is our initial choice of format for long-term archival storage, it almost certainly won't be our last. For the moment, at least, considering the massive quantity of material with which we have to deal, it meets our most pressing criteria; it's digital, it's reliable, and it isn't ridiculously expensive. As other options become viable, disk-based media for example, we may move away from D-2. Indeed, when disks become economically competitive with tape, the random access capability of the disk format, plus the likelihood of a very extended shelf life, would certainly make it an attractive successor format.\n\nUnfortunately, with a perpetual archiving process that will involve changes in the selected storage medium, one of our most troublesome concerns is how to ensure that we continue to possess and maintain the technical equipment required to permit the playback of electronically stored images. Unlike printed paper which presents itself directly to the human eye, analog and digital signals are incomprehensible until played back through an electronic mediating device that converts them into recognizable pictures and sound. As formats evolve, the greater risk lies not in the eventual deterioration of properly stored archival media, but in the probable unavailability of the equipment, including spare parts, needed to play the stuff back.\n\nLike Proteus, formats and media will continue to change. But great caution should be exercised before scrapping one established archival storage medium and substituting another. Considering the volume of material with which we must deal, the possibility of reconverting all previously archived material to each successor medium to maintain some neat consistency and eliminate the need for more than one sort of playback device, would be both impractical and uneconomic.\n\nFor entities like ABC, with several hundred thousand hours of material on hand, the desire to achieve preservation at a reasonable cost is obvious. We must, therefore, seriously consider the possible use of compression. Compression technology would permit a radical reduction in the amount of both the storage medium required and the space in which to house it. The issue of whether it is archivally responsible to compress video material is, we understand, a highly charged one. Some opponents of compression pronounce it anathema, maintaining that to use it is to needlessly throw away a percentage of the material which we are committed to save.\n\nBut what is the material to be preserved? Is it the analog magnetic signal, or in the case of digital formats all those ones and zeros resting on the tape? Or is it instead the pictures and sound which are created when these invisible elements are processed by an electronic mediating device? If what we mean to save are the images and sounds, and if they can be created, using less electronic information, to a degree virtually undetectable by any human being, then we have preserved everything of value.\n\nIt is even possible to compress to a higher standard than that of human comprehension. Using so- called \"lossless\" compression, which is probably slightly under two to one, image creation can occur to a degree that preserves levels of sharpness and color well beyond the capability of the human eye to discern. And the difference between an uncompressed image and one created at this low level of compression would be virtually undetectable even to an electronic monitoring device. In either case, the pictures and the sounds will have been saved--at a significant savings. Obviously, for material which may be used for production purposes involving much editing or other electronic manipulation, the less compression the better. But for material which most likely will not be subjected to intensive processing, the notion of a compressed archival format should not be ruled out.\n\nIt would surely benefit ABC and the many other public and private organizations who have decided to preserve their respective videotape holdings, if these and similar issues could be discussed on some continuing basis. A forum is called for in which ideas and information pertaining to the preservation of videotape records can be shared. We certainly hope that one outcome of these hearings will be periodic gatherings at which the archival problems, both technical and conceptual, which we encounter individually, can be discussed and perhaps even solved together. Thank you.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you, Michael Lang. Joel Kanoff?\n\nMR. KANOFF: ABC News is a for-profit commercial network news organization providing news and public affairs programming. Although not widely seen at that time, the television network offered its first newscast in 1948. This was followed in 1952 by a weekly program called All Star News, and in the fall of 1953, eight months after ABC's merger with Paramount Theaters by Leonard Goldenson, ABC started a regular Monday through Friday news program anchored by veteran newsman John Daly.\n\nABC broke new ground in the fall of 1958 with the introduction of early and late evening news programming, and in the late '60s, ABC joined the other networks and increased its evening news program to 30 minutes. Barbara Walters became the first anchorwoman of a network evening news broadcast in 1976. Under Rune Arlege's leadership, innovative programs were introduced, such as World News Tonight, 20-20, Prime Time Live, This Week with David Brinkley, and Nightline, the first regularly scheduled late-night newscast of its kind to use satellite technology to bring together leaders and experts for in-depth discussions on the top stories of the day.\n\nOver the years, ABC News has built a unique and far-reaching news gathering organization domestically and throughout the world. Currently among other capitals there are bureaus in Beijing, London, Moscow, Paris, Tel Aviv, and Tokyo.\n\nAs you may well imagine, preservation of footage from past events and programming is of great importance in a television network news universe. While the majority of footage used is certainly newly shot, each show contains archival footage. In a typical World News Tonight edition, almost every spot contains older footage used to put a fine point on a subject, supply background, develop its history, or just remind us of the continuity of our way of government or of life itself.\n\nABC News will continue to collect the wide variety of materials that reflect U.S. and international news events, history and cultural trends, religion, science and technology, environment and wildlife. Our preservations efforts extend to footage of events of every day society and every level of magnitude. Footage of people from the most famous to the obscure, the entire range of human social activities, flora and fauna from everywhere, landscapes and even still lifes of objects. That is to say besides news, the collection includes a great deal of generic footage, children in schools, people working in factories, ships and airplanes, beauty shots, aerials, all of which can be reused in a wide variety of stories.\n\nOur core collection consists of approximately 850,000 units of film and tape dating to 1960. Another 60,000 tapes and kinescopes are off-air records of programs, current programs, as well as all but forgotten programs such as Scope, Directions, ABC Reports, The Reasoner Report, and Now. The core collection is film-based through 1975, mostly 16mm color reversal. Mixed film and eumatic through the late '70s, eumatic until 1986, and beta cam to the present. Roughly 12 per cent of the core collection is film; about 47 per cent of the collection is beta cam; the rest 3/4-inch. That is the core news collection used by all programs for production. We also have many millions of feet of film and many thousands of video cassettes in storage. These are trends and production elements for documentaries and magazine segments. The further use of these production elements is more restricted, so they do not circulate freely.\n\nRoughly speaking, we save over 4,000 tapes a month, about 5,000 in a political year such as this one. No, we don't save everything, there just isn't space. We immediately recycle a roll with a correspondent's stand-ups, since we don't feel it's important to save rehearsals for the final take, which is of course preserved on the air history anyway. We recycle graphic builds and multiple camera set-ups of minor importance to the event recorded. But, with regard to subject matter, because we try no to prejudge and therefore not to dictate what will be important to producers in the future, we tend to err on the side of inclusivity.\n\nBy necessity, however, we do have to make some difficult choices. Moreover, one shot may serve for dozens of diverse future production requirements, provided that the computerized description is sufficient for it to be located objectively. Keeping these issues in mind, library staff carefully evaluate materials turned in by producers and camera crews at all our bureaus and decide what materials to permanently archive or to recycle.\n\nNews production demands swift, accurate access of archive materials. However, the richness of the videotape recording greatly reduces the effectiveness of standard archival cataloguing methods. Key words and brief subject classifications at best do not do justice to, and at worst misstate and distort the moving image. For that reason, an extensive account of the visual an auditory contents of the recording is necessary. Producers, researchers and writers at ABC News rely on their ability to quickly get a functional, verbal likeness of the recorded image from our computer system. In proposing retrieval requests to the system, these users may cast their net as narrowly or as broadly as they like. They may call up specific documents or thousands of documents, although they may not request thousands of tapes.\n\nUnlike the comparatively more relaxed research done by documentary filmmakers, the television news producer is forever working against the tightest of deadlines to get the footage cut into that evening's broadcast. Full text retrieval is practically worthless without the hand of the diligent cataloguer. In the ABC News idiom, cataloging refers to the descriptive shot listing of the footage. The content field of a typical 20-minute field recording can go on for pages, depending on the substantive density of the footage. In this scenario, catalogers must ask themselves among the many things I see and hear, what is important to describe here? Also, how might this material be utilized again and within the guidelines of the classification method, the style sheet and the established lexical thesaurus, how will an army of different producers seek to access it? That is, what descriptive language will they use?\n\nCataloguing is a lengthy and continuing process an the focus and dedication required enjoins us from being as comprehensive as we would like. At present we are able to fully shotlist on a percentage of the new footage we acquire. Decisions must be made as the potential usefulness of the work and ultimately the significance of the story. Remember, everything does get a record in the computer, but only the top stories are catalogued. Nevertheless, cataloguing brings in the clients. In the news film tape world, the operative variant on \"build it and they will come\" is \"describe it and they will use it.\" It is axiomatic that there is a direct proportional relationship between the quantity and quality of catalogue detail and the use of particular tapes and film.\n\nWe have traditionally provided and continue to provide access to outside producers for the purpose of stock footage sales and research. In 1989, it occurred to us that what was lacking was a portable index to our holdings. This was in the dawn of CD Rom technology and in that format we were able to provide an excellent word-searchable index to our footage with retrieval software every bit as powerful as the Stairs application that runs on our mainframe. We distributed this to the outside source and sent many without cost to libraries and information resources throughout the world. Still, CD Rom disks are out of date from the moment they are cut and we look to the Internet and Worldwide Web to provide the means to distribute information about our collection to outside stock footage customers and to researchers in general.\n\nRight now the entire CD Rom catalogue of news footage, available for licensing from ABC News Video Source is available on FootageNet on the Web. We have great hopes for the future of electronic data, and in coming years even retrieval of footage itself on the Desktop. Unquestionably, the greatest benefit there will be the provision of low-cost footage access to educators at schools, universities, and non-profit organizations throughout the country.\n\nAs I have said, the archive is a very meaningful part of the production fabric. In fact, the television news moving image collection has matured into occupying a rather enviable status. It is not by chance that now at the end of this century of the moving image and electronic communication, that the television library has found new friends and loyal partisans. Having earlier learned the painful lesson that you can't go out and reshoot history, the networks are now more respectful of these valuable corporate assets and resolute that they endure.\n\nBesides the historical significance of this footage, there is an economic consequence. While the use of library holdings has enabled shows to keep costs down, entire program concepts like the 20th Century project at ABC and documentaries that we produce for cable, have been developed around pre-existing footage. Cost center libraries have become profit center libraries.\n\nMichael Lang has explained the MCF in detail, so I won't go into that, except to say that the news division in general and the news film library in particular, having a big stake in the success of the Media Conservation Facility, participated in the planning of the facility from the earliest stages and we are confident that appropriate, careful procedures are in place for the preservation in logical stages of the footage in our charge.\n\nHowever, I should like to call your attention to the fact that the preservation of footage in active TV news archives commences well before the preservation dubbing takes place. The term archive here tells only half the story. The other half is best characterized by the words circulating collection. In this respect, we are also quite distinct from other types of circulating TV collections like entertainment collections because of the volume of circulation and the extent of reuse. At any one time, we have an average of close to 90,000 pieces in circulation, and much like a public library, when original materials circulate off the library premises, they are at risk and we have to be concerned. Circulating tapes means tapes getting worn, damaged, or worst, lost. Each run across a recording head shave some of the magnetic stratum off a tape. Unlike published materials, much of the footage we collect is irreplaceable. It is true that we are at the outset of technological changes which will obviate the term wear and tear; that is, the optical disk for storage of master materials, as well as the concept of actual physical circulation. That is, images will be distributed electronically and digitally. Yet, for many years to come, we will be circulating our tape, there's so much of it.\n\nSo the point here is that we often can't wait for the scheduled preservation project to complete its good work, for we will always be beleaguered by physics as well as by the user who critically suffers amnesia when it comes time to remembering what he or she did with a cassette.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Can you bring your statement to a conclusion?\n\nMR. KANOFF: Sure.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you.\n\nMR. KANOFF: With the advent of the ABC News 24-hour channel, the library is again taking a vanguard role in expanding its operations and facilitating the use of the footage it maintains in ever more challenging ways. A nexus of technological, cultural and business advantages now in evidence, including the Internet, HDTV, Interactivity, new digital video formats, recent mergers, and an end of millennium public that gives news a privileged place in every day living, makes this a time of extraordinary opportunity for the television news collection.\n\nAt this juncture it is especially important for the Library of Congress, the National Archives and other government institutions to work more closely with the network archives to sponsor specialized discussions or conferences devoted to the problems of the TV news collection in particular and to cooperatively establish criteria for the on-going deposit of network news materials.\n\nMR. MURPHY: Thank you, Joel. Doug McKinney? I'm sorry, Donald DeCesare will go first?\n\nMR. DE CESARE: Thank you very much. We say DeCesare, by the way, although it defies linguistic practice.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for allowing me and my colleague from the CBS News Archives to participate in this important hearing.\n\nFirst I ought to give you a little background on myself. I've just completed six years as the executive in charge of the archives; if not the biggest, certainly one of the most respected collections of broadcast material in the world. While not a professional archivist myself, I've had to face many of the same challenges that the professionals in our organ"
