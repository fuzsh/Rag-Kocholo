        "text": "Hawthorne Fine Art is pleased to announce the opening of its upcoming exhibition, Soaring Sights: Luminist Landscapes by Female Hudson River School Painters (1825-1875). Featuring a selection of women artists who were active throughout the nineteenth century, the exhibition focuses on these women’s contributions to the history of the Hudson River School, Luminism, and American landscape painting. Spanning half a century, the paintings on view represent a cross-section of landscapes from painters with a unique points of view and various levels of formal training.\n\nWhile visitors will be familiar with the work of slightly more well-known artists—such as Sarah Cole, the younger sister of Thomas Cole, or Julie Hart Beers, whose brothers James and William Hart were renowned painters of the same style—the exhibition will also focus on equally talented painters whose work is more often obscured. Soaring Sights will include contributions from artists Isabella Bissett, Abby T. Oakes, Helen Mary Knowlton, Mary Josephine Walters, Julia Bacon, Agnes Brown, Ella Ferris Pell, Virginia Chandler Titcomb, Laura Woodward, and Susie M. Barstow. When viewed together, these landscape scenes will underscore the breadth, depth, and dexterity with which women met the challenge of painting the New England landscape with attention to its light and atmosphere, in unique compliment to their male peers."
