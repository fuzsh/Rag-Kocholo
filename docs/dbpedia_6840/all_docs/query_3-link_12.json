        "text": "A man stands on the ledge of a mountain, waving his hat with his right hand, and leaning on a cane-like object with his left hand. The view behind him is a hazy vista, featuring more mountains. There are trees protruding from the side of the ledge, as well as along the left hand-side of the image. There are two additional figures in the bottom left corner, which appear to be climbing up to the ledge. The three people are tiny figures in comparison with the vast landscape backdrop."
