Upon the edges of the cliffs of North and South mountains, overlooking the great plain and the Hudson River, how often his feet have stood! The very lichens there remember him.”[1]\n\nThe popularity of the Mountain House was expanded greatly by stagecoach line owner Charles L. Beach, who assumed control of the Mountain House in 1839 and full ownership in 1846. At that time, he began renovations on the hotel and created more hiking trails on the surrounding North and South Mountain terrain (which he also owned), which attracted visitors and artists. Beach also published a guidebook to the Mountain House and the area around it, with excerpts from poet William Cullen Bryant and from several travel writers of the era.[2] Unsurprisingly, the locale became a popular, and awe-inspiring destination. The tourist culture also helped to generate patrons for the Hudson River School artists.[3] Gifford was among the first to paint the views from these new paths.[4] His sketchbooks from 1861-62 and 1865-66 contain studies of the Mountain House."
