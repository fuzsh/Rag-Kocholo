Drawn from the collection of the New-York Historical Society, the exhibition explores the exchange of influence among this group of artists, their favored sketching grounds, and the legacy of Hudson River School painting today... The growing number of crowded industrial cities in the East gave rise to an appreciation for pictures of the landscape untouched by man. This closely-knit group of artists, together with like-minded poets and writers, forged a self-consciously \"American\" landscape vision and literary voice. Both were grounded in the exploration of the natural world as a rouse for spiritual renewal and as an expression of cultural and national identity. The Hudson River and the varied scenery along its banks provided the subjects for many of their landscape paintings.\".Accessed 9/23\n\nThe Poetry of Nature: Hudson River School Landscapes from the New-York Historical Society is a 2017 exhibit at the Allentown Art Museum which says: \"The Poetry of Nature, comprised of some forty paintings by twenty-five artists ranging in date from 1818 to 1886, features a variety of important paintings conceived in the style of the Hudson River School.

According to ArtBabble, \"Asher B. Durand is best known today for his enduring images of the American landscape, especially of the Hudson River Valley, the Catskills, and the Adirondack Mountains in New York. A founding member of the National Academy of Design, he studied engraving before devoting himself to landscape painting and was one of the primary painters of the Hudson River School. Durand's canvases reflect the great passion and unrelenting respect he possessed for the natural environment. In the detailed charcoal study for Landscape-Composition: In the Catskills, which he probably made on site, Durand included the small figural forms in the foreground; in this, the final painting of the subject, these tiny figures, juxtaposed with the immensity of the mountains and the breadth of the land before them, emphasize the awe-inspiring presence of the land itself.\" Accessed June, 2015. The San Diego Museum of Art also produced a video titled Thomas Moran, Below the Towers of Tower Falls, available online through ArtBabble. According to ArtBabble, \"ArtStops are 15 minute, staff-led tours of one to three works on view.
