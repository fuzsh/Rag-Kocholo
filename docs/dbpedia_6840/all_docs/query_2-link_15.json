Many of his recorded vignettes found their way into the final artwork, from the monumental fireplace and ornate ceiling decorations of the Morgan to the overflowing bookshelves and pressed-tin ceiling of Mendoza’s. Grooms’ sketchbooks for the project, as well as the maquette used to guide the installation, will also be on view.\n\nExhibitions are made possible by assistance provided by the County of Westchester.\n\nRivers Flow / Artists Connect\n\nThrough September 1, 2024\n\nView press images\n\nKindred Worlds: The Priscila and Alvin Hudgins Collection\n\nThrough March 2, 2025\n\nView press images\n\nIt Takes 2: Unexpected Pairings\n\nThrough March 2, 2025\n\nView press images\n\nA Feast for the Eyes: Sumptuous Still Lifes\n\nThrough December 1, 2024\n\nView press images\n\nFaces and Figures: Recent Acquisitions\n\nOngoing\n\nView press images\n\nCollection Spotlight: The Hudson River School\n\nOngoing\n\nView press images\n\nCollection Spotlight: The Art of Skywatching\n\nOngoing\n\nView press Images\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nAll events are free with general admission unless otherwise noted.\n\nView program images\n\nSunday, June 2, 1:30pm\n\nTour of Rivers Flow / Artists Connect Image\n\nExplore Rivers Flow / Artists Connect, featuring works by fifty artists who capture our profound, symbiotic relationship with significant rivers across the globe, and enjoy a scenic view of the Hudson River and Palisades, on an informative docent tour.\n\nFriday, June 7, 5–8pm\n\nFree First Fridays: The Muses Image\n\nCelebrate Pride Month and dance the night away with The Muses, a DJ duo helmed by Jack James and Daniel Walters that specializes in Parisian funk, house, disco, and underground pop.
