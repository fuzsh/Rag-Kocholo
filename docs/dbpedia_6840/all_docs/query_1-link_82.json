        "text": "Bruce Weber with Maria Yeye\n\nI hope you'll be able to attend the opening at the Historical Society of Woodstock on Saturday June 10th (from 1 to 5 p.m.) of the exhibition In Care of the Historical Society of Woodstock: A Selected Survey of Woodstock Art Colony Works on Paper, which I curated with Maria Yeye's assistance. I'll speak about the exhibition at 3:30 p.m., focusing especially on the four works the Historical Society is hoping to conserve with community support. In addition, I'll be giving a gallery talk on the exhibition on Saturday July 8th at 3 p.m. The exhibition closes on July 23rd.\n\nThe Historical Society of Woodstock is located at 20 Comeau Drive, and is open on weekends from Spring through Fall from 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free. In addition to the current show, you'll have the opportunity to see the newly opened tool shed and permanent historical exhibition.\n\nI'd like to thank Deborah Heppner for her valuable help in putting together the exhibition of works on paper, JoAnn Margolis and Letitia Smith for their collaborative work on the grant application, and John Kleinhans for providing needed photography.\n\nWilliam H. Arlt (1868-1952)\n\nFlowers, 1949\n\nGouache on paper\n\n19 x 10\"\n\nHistorical Sociaty of Woodstock 2007.27.269\n\nThe current exhibition at the Historical Society of Woodstock highlights the institution's significant collection of works on paper, the recently completed conservation by Sarah Dove of William H. Arlt’s Flowers, and the conservation needs of pictures by Marianne Appel, Judson Smith, and Harry Gottlieb. As a result of the generous support of the NYSCA/GHNN Conservation Treatment Grant Program, administered by the Greater Hudson Heritage Foundation over the past two years, conservation has been completed on Arlt’s Flowers, and the paintings Hervey White in His Studio, by Arnold Blanch, and Landscape, by Edmund B. Rolfe.\n\nThese efforts are part of a long-range plan to care for works in the fine art collections that are in special need of conservation, which will allow the greater public to become more aware of the strength of the institution’s fine art collection, and of the aesthetic achievements of the historic Woodstock art colony. It is our hope that with the support of people in the community we will soon undertake the care of the works by Appel, Smith, and Gottlieb. Information about the care and cost required of these four works is noted in the label text that appears below.\n\nFrom the time of the Historical Society of Woodstock‘s inception in 1929, the organization has been devoted to recording, documenting, and furthering interest in the history of the Woodstock art colony. In late September of that year a group of 20 individuals gathered at the home of Konrad Cramer, including fellow artists Marion Bullard, Alice Wardwell, Eva Watson-Schütze, Zulma Steele, Henry Lee McFee, Florence Ballin Cramer, Orville H. Peets and H. L. Jenkinson. The Historical Society of Woodstock's fine art collection currently numbers about 800 works, and was largely assembled in the 1980s by Sam Klein, who served as director of acquisitions, with help from the organization’s president Matthew Leaycraft.\n\nThis exhibition highlights three areas of the fine art collection: portraits of leading local individuals, among them artists and musicians; townscapes, with views of noteworthy houses, streets, land, places of business and other local or area architecture, and village scenes, including public events and activities, and nearby farms; and the collection’s small but exquisite collection of still lifes. Among the works on view are self-portraits by Kurt Sluizer, Manuel Bromberg, Franklin Alexander, Leslie Bender, Robert Angeloch, Sally Michel Avery, March Avery and Daniel Gelfand, as well as likenesses by Judson Smith of artist and photographer Sam Wylie and illustrator Miska Petersham, and Aline Fruhauf’s caricature of the author J. P. McEvoy. Among the outdoor scenes are works by Clarence Bolton, Reeves Brace, Wilna Hervey, Doris Lee and Mary James. Still lifes include pictures by Ernest Fiene, Harry Gottlieb, Georgina Klitgaard, Mary D. Smith, and Milton Glaser.\n\nPORTRAITS\n\nFranklin Alexander (1929-2005)\n\nSelf Portrait, c. 1990\n\nPencil on paper\n\n27 x 21”Historical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.267\n\nPainter, philosopher, writer and teacher Franklin Alexander was a native of New York City, and resided in Woodstock from 1955 to his death. After studying art in New York and working in advertising, he attended the State Art Institute in Florence in 1950 under the GI Bill, and began to devote his full attention to painting. Following a brief period as an abstract painter he began to specialize in figurative work and drawing in the early 1960s. Alexander was also active as a portraitist. This striking drawing served as a study for a self-portrait in acrylic of about 1990 (Estate of Franklin Alexander). Alexander taught widely, including at the Woodstock School of Art. In his classes in portrait painting he encouraged students to devote special attention to the analysis of facial expression and characterization, and shared his broad and thorough knowledge of classical methods and techniques.\n\nBW\n\nRobert Angeloch (1922-2011)\n\nSelf Portrait, 1950\n\nLithograph on paper\n\n15 x 11”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.024\n\nRobert Angeloch attended the Art Students League in New York from 1946-1951, where he first began studying painting with Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and also attended Martin Lewis’ graphics class in etching and lithography. In 1948 he was the monitor in Kuniyoshi’s class at the league’s summer school in Woodstock. Angeloch took up permanent residence in Woodstock in 1953. He served as the principal founder of the Woodstock School of Art, which in 1981 moved to the league’s former site on Route 212 outside the village. In addition to having an active career as a painter, printmaker, and teacher, from 1975 to 2000 Angeloch ran the Paradox Gallery on lower Mill Hill Road, which was devoted to showing both the work of contemporary artists and artists of the historic art colony. It was the first gallery in Woodstock of its kind, preceding that of the James Cox Gallery and Fletcher Gallery.\n\nBW\n\nMarch Avery (B. 1932)\n\nSelf Portrait, 1988\n\nFelt pen, black ink and wash on paper\n\n13 ½ x 10 ½”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.102\n\nDaughter of painters Milton Avery and Sally Michel Avery, March Avery began painting as a child – although as she tells it, \"I think I was painting in utero.” She began coming to the area for summers in the early 1950s when her parents resided in Byrdclifffe.\n\nBW\n\nSally Michel Avery (1902-2003)\n\nSelf Portrait, 1988\n\nPen and ink on paper\n\n10 ¼ x 8 ¼”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.084\n\nSally Michel Avery worked as a freelance illustrator for decades, enabling her husband Milton to paint fulltime. Following Milton's death in 1965, she devoted greater time to her own work, and had solo showings in Woodstock at the Jarvis and Bell galleries. Earlier she worked mostly on a small scale, and on paper. After Milton Avery’s second heart attack in 1960, the couple purchased a house in Lake Hill, near Cooper Lake. A few years after Milton’s death, Sally acquired ten acres of land in Bearsville, where she lived and worked during the summer months till her death in 2003.\n\nBW\n\nLeslie Bender (B. 1952)\n\nSelf Portrait, 1988\n\nEtching on paper\n\n10 x 8”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.013\n\nLeslie Bender first learned the art of etching and aquatint at the Art Students League in New York in 1972. Her next serious printmaking endeavor was at the Woodstock School of Art in 1986, when she served as the monitor in Robert Angeloch’s printmaking class. Bender, who has been active for almost forty years as an artist in the Hudson Valley, encouraged Angeloch to utilize the lithographic stones left by the league’s summer school following its departure in 1979 from Woodstock, where it had resumed its activity following World War II.\n\nBW\n\nLouise Brokenshaw (1907-1992)\n\nPortrait of Harry Cowell, 1973\n\nPastel on paper\n\n19 x 14 ½”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.177\n\nLouise Brokenshaw focused primarily on ceramics.

She taught ceramics out of her home and through the Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen. This pastel portrait features Henry Cowell, the world-renowned avant-garde 20th century composer, musical theorist, pianist, teacher, publisher and impresario who beginning in 1942 had a home in Shady with his wife Sidney, a pioneering ethnomusicologist and folklorist. Among Cowell’s private students were John Cage and Lou Harrison.\n\nMY\n\nManual Bromberg (1917-2022)\n\nSelf Portrait, 1955\n\nCharcoal on paper\n\n11 x 8”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.219\n\nManuel Bromberg was first drawn to Woodstock in 1941 by the painter Arnold Blanch, who invited the young artist to stay with him. He briefly returned to the area in 1950 when he and his wife lived in the Maverick art colony in West Hurley. Bromberg settled permanently in town in 1957 after he accepted a teaching position at SUNY New Paltz. In the mid-1950s, the artist was highly active as a portraitist. In 1954 he was commissioned to paint portraits of several of the NATO Generals. Among Bromberg’s later more abstract work is a series of innovative, monumentally scaled “Cliff Sculptures,” which were inspired by the landscape of the Catskills and cast in polyester and fiberglass.\n\nMY\n\nTode Brower (1898-1974)\n\nPortrait of Carl Walters, 1935\n\nCharcoal on paper\n\n11 x 9”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.175\n\nTode Brower came to Woodstock in the late 1920s with his artist wife, Jo Cantine, and settled in Bearsville. During the winters, the couple traveled throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America, gaining inspiration for their work. Although Brower painted mostly in watercolor, he was commissioned in 1935 by the WPA to paint a mural for the new armory in Kingston. The subject of this portrait, Carl Walters, was a painter and printmaker turned ceramic sculptor who came to Woodstock in 1922. Walters joined the Maverick art colony, where he focused on hand-molding sculptures and producing complex and original glazes for his work. A lithograph by Walters is featured in this exhibition.\n\nMY\n\nKonrad Cramer (1888-1963)\n\nSelf Portrait, 1933\n\nInk, pen and brush on paper\n\n8 x 5 ½”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.162\n\nKonrad Cramer was always open to working in new techniques, styles and media. A native of Germany, he met the aspiring painter Florence Ballin in Munich in early 1912. Following their marriage, they settled in Woodstock, where Florence had previously been studying, living and working. Cramer was deeply involved in the Woodstock community. Among other things he played a role in the founding of the Historical Society of Woodstock. During the Great Depression, Cramer seriously questioned the place that artists of the day had in relation to society. In 1933, he wondered what “place an artist had in relation to his time, of what social and ethical importance has he, is he showing a clearer way to a better life?”\n\nBW\n\nJulio de Diego (1900-1979)\n\nSelf Portrait, c. 1970\n\nLithograph on blue paper\n\n20 x 16 ½”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.009\n\nThe flamboyant Julio de Diego was born in Madrid, and left home at the age of 15. In 1924 he emigrated to the United States, where he became active in the art world of Chicago. In the late 1940s he exhibited with the Surrealists in Paris. Diego first visited Woodstock in 1950, and moved permanently to the town in 1961. Art writer Lester Burban remarked that the artist’s “fierce and mobile face, framed in jet black hair, is startlingly lighted by a pair or paradoxically compassionate forget-me-not blue eyes. It is not surprising, with his dramatic demeanor, that he acted in one of the early Spanish movies, was an extra with the Russian Ballet and a pantomimist with a Spanish theatrical company in Tampa, Florida.”\n\nBW\n\nJohn Fenton (1912-1977)\n\nSelf Portrait, c. 1960\n\nGraphite on paper\n\n17 x 12”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.007\n\nPainter, printmaker, poet, art critic and teacher John Fenton was born in Mountaindale, New York.

She spent summers in Woodstock in the early 1930s, where she created caricatures of artists Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Eugene Speicher, and Konrad Cramer, and the writer J. P. McEvoy, among others. McEvoy achieved renown as a playwright and scripter of the popular Dixie Dugan comic strip drawn by Woodstock illustrator John H. Striebel. In the 1920s and early 1930s, McEvoy and his artist wife Eugenie presided over a 20-acre estate in Bearsville, which included a manor house, two studios, a stable, and an Olympic-sized swimming pool.\n\nBW\n\nDaniel Gelfand (B. 1948)\n\nSelf Portrait, 1980\n\nEtching on paper\n\n12 ¾ x 9 ¾”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.193\n\nA native of Queens, Daniel Gelfand studied art at several schools in New York, including Southampton College, the Brooklyn Museum Art School, and the New York Studio School, and completed graduate work at C. W. Post College and SUNY New Paltz. He initially came to the Woodstock area in 1973, when he lived with his wife Jennifer in Mount Tremper. While residing later in Shokan he became close with artists André Ruellan and John W. Taylor. Following Taylor’s death in 1983 he built a house on the couple’s property in Shady. For many years Gelfand was deeply involved with the Woodstock artistic community.\n\nGelfand became interested in etching while studying printmaking in 1983 with Ben Wigfall and Joe Ramos at SUNY New Paltz. Self Portrait was his initial work in the medium. He drew six self-portraits on paper, placed them in front of himself, then proceeded to draw the image on the etching plate while editing from all six. He recalls that Taylor thought that Self-Portait “was terrific for a first etching.” In the course of the 1980s and 1990s, the artist was deeply engaged with etching and monoprints, and was active as a printer for other artists, including Ruellan and Norma Morgan. Gelfand currently resides in Saugerties.\n\nBW\n\nKurt Sluizer (1929-2009)\n\nSelf Portrait, June 1959\n\nCharcoal, crayon and chalk on paper\n\n16 ¼ x 11 ½”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.036\n\nKurt Sluizer was born in Holland and moved to the United States in 1939.

In 1921, he and his artist wife Mary left Detroit for a trip abroad. On returning to America later that year they visited Woodstock, where Judson was impressed by the art he saw on view at the Woodstock Artists Association, and was convinced the community would be stimulating. He settled with his family on part of the old Risely farm on Ohayo Mountain Road.\n\nSmith occasionally depicted artists he associated with in town, including Miska Petersham and Sam Wiley. Miska and his wife Maud were acclaimed writers and illustrators of children’s books. Born in Hungary, he traveled to New York in 1911, where he found work at the graphic studio International Art Service. He met Maud across the drawing board. The couple married in 1917, and in 1923 settled near the village of Woodstock in a house on the Glasco Turnpike.\n\nBW\n\nIn order to conserve Smith’s drawing, the paper conservator Sarah Dove will need to remove tape and adhesive from verso, water wash with filtered pH adjusted water to reduce soluble discoloration in the sheet, reduce discoloration with ammonium citrate dibasic, further water wash to remove chemicals, consider light bleaching to reduce the foxing further, size with methyl cellulose to further protect the paper, minimize the strong creases by lining the back of the drawing with Japanese paper and wheat starch paste.\n\nConservation Estimate: $625.00\n\nJudson Smith (1880-1962)\n\nSketch of Sam Wylie, 1923\n\nGraphite on clay-coated wove paper\n\n12 x 9”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.241\n\nSam Wylie was born in Indiana and grew up in Pennsylvania.

From 1932-1934 she attended Sarah Lawrence College and studied art with Peppino Mangravite and Bradley Walker Tomlin, a longtime resident of the art colony, who may have inspired Appel to attend the Woodstock School of Painting in the summer of 1934. There she studied with Charles Rosen, Konrad Cramer, Henry Lee McFee, Henry Mattson, and Austin Mecklem, whom she married two years later. Ski Town is a working drawing for the artist’s unlocated oil painting of the same title, which was shown at the Carnegie International in Pittsburgh in 1941. The location of the town is not known for certain, but it is probably based on a view of Phoenicia. Following Mecklem’s death in 1951, Appel relocated to New York City, where she achieved acclaim as a designer and fabricator of puppets for television and film productions.\n\nBW\n\nIn order to conserve Appel's drawing, the paper conservator Sarah Dove will have to mechanically remove the cardboard backing board to the adhesive layer with a scalpel (retaining the authentication stamp on the verso), reduce the adhesive as possible with the appropriate solvent, water wash with filtered pH adjusted water to reduce soluble discoloration in the sheet, reduce discoloration with ammonium citrate dibasic, further water wash to remove chemicals, consider light bleaching to reduce the foxing further, line overall with Japanese paper and wheat starch paste, and mylar encapsulate the authentication stamp removed from the verso.\n\nConservation Estimated Cost: $2,750.00\n\nClarence Bolton (1893-1962)\n\nAfter the Storm, February 1938\n\nLithograph on paper\n\n9 ½ x 12 1//4”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.094\n\nPainter, graphic artist and printmaker Clarence Bolton first settled in Woodstock in 1917.

Fortess attended the Art Institute of Chicago in the late 1920s, and then moved to New York City. From there he hitchhiked north, unsure of whether he wanted to travel to the artist colony in Woodstock or Provincetown, Massachusetts. During the course of his expedition he visited a police station to learn which place was closer. He hitchhiked the rest of the way to Woodstock and arrived with a few cents in his pocket. A person gave him a lift to West Hurley, where he met Maverick art colony founder Hervey White, who gave him an attic room to live in. At the Woodstock School of Painting, Fortess came under the tutelage of Yasuo Kuniyoshi, whose work influenced his direction and style as a landscape painter. Fortess remarked that during his formative years in the colony there were “two kinds of artists . . . younger or older, with a kind of protective arrangement between them.”\n\nBW\n\nMilton Glaser (1929-2020)\n\nWindow in Woodstock (Flowers in a Vase), 1986\n\nSerigraph on paper (Artist's Proof)\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.213\n\nMilton Glaser, a renowned artist and graphic designer, joined the Woodstock community as a seasonal resident in the 1950s and continued coming regularly for the rest of his life.

She first came to Woodstock in 1918 when she attended Winold Reiss’ summer art school. In 1924, she and her artist partner Nan Mason settled on a 4 ½ acre mountainside property in Bearsville. At the end of World War II, Hervey had an artistic breakthrough when artist Henry Lee McFee urged her to abandon her interest in drawing portraits in a traditional style indebted to Reiss’ example, and develop her own more personal vision. Working in various media, Hervey developed a folk art style, and pictured still lifes and images of local sites, such as the village green and post office.\n\nBW\n\nFlorence Tuttle Hubbard (1892-1968)\n\nView of Overlook Mountain from Artist’s Studio Window in Bearsville, 1922\n\nWatercolor on paper\n\n20 x 16\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.527\n\nThe little remembered artist Florence Tuttle Hubbard was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1892.

For more than three decades the fair was held every Saturday near the village green during the summer months. Woodstock historian Janine Fallon-Mower has noted that the artist Ethel Peets “developed the idea of Saturday Market Fairs in 1917 as a way to raise money for the Red Cross. Ethel and Marion Eames set about gathering a group of volunteer workers to run a street fair, patterned after similar fairs that were common in Europe. Table sellers, as they were known, set up on a vacant lot behind the village green in an area now occupied by the Garden Café.” Among other things, the fair was a popular place to buy flowers, jewelry and interesting odds and ends. The fair survives today in the guise of Mower’s Saturday Sunday Flea Market on Maple Lane in the village.\n\nBW\n\nDavid Huffine (1911-1973)\n\nLibrary Fair, 1948\n\nInk on paper\n\n25 x 20”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.135\n\nDavid Huffine was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, and began his residency in Woodstock in 1938.

Both Huffine and Florence Tuttle Hubbard have pictures of the Woodstock Market Fair in this exhibition. The Library Fair has been held on the home grounds in front of the library since 1931, four years after the library moved to its present home. The fair itself goes back to 1917 when it was begun as a fundraiser for the library when there was no library budget. From 1927-1946 the library borrowed the tent and tables belonging to the Saturday afternoon Market Fair, and the Library fair was held on Wednesday to avoid interference. The Kingston Daily Freeman reported that at the 1948 Library Fair the “crowd was larger. The costumes, booths, personalities and just about everything was gayer and livier than ever before.”\n\nBW\n\nNeil Ives (1892-1946)\n\nUntitled, 1923\n\nLithograph on paper\n\n6 ½ x 9 ¼”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.423\n\nNeil Ives was a native of St. Louis , where his father, Halsey C.

James’ prints of the period were usually made from direct observation in the landscape and from her experience of being outdoors in all kinds of weather. The etching in the exhibition is the only etching she created at the time that was based on a dream. James currently resides in White Plains, New York.\n\nBW\n\nDoris Lee (1905-1983)\n\nMountain Farm, c. 1942\n\nLithograph on paper\n\n7 x 8 ¼”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.109\n\nPainter and printmaker Doris Lee attended the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco in 1930, where she studied with visiting instructor Arnold Blanch.

The house (located at the juncture of route 212 and Chestnut Hill Road), had formerly been owned by artist and local philanthropist Alice Wardwell. The house’s backyard kitchen garden and barn resemble the those garden and barn that appear in in Mountain Farm, which dates from the early 1940s. Lee’s art at the time was grounded in her study and admiration for American Folk art of the 19th century, portraying country life with a sense of whimsy and joy.\n\nBW\n\nPatricia Hart Vinton Brown Ravenal (1883-1955)\n\nWoodstock, 1923\n\nInk and watercolor on paper\n\n14 ½ x 10 ½”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.422\n\nPatricia Hart Vinton Brown Ravenal was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and was the great-granddaughter of British-born architect Benjamin Latrobe.

Arlt established his own offices in the city, served as president of the American Textile Designers Guild, and taught at the Textile Evening School of Design, among other places. He first came to Woodstock in 1906, and studied painting under Birge Harrison. After summering in Woodstock for several years, Arlt built a group of artists’ cottages on the hillside along Glasco Turnpike, and established a small art and design school. A great lover of flowers, Arlt worked in his extensive gardens in his spare time, and created a group of vibrant and colorful floral still lifes.\n\nFor her work on Arlt’s Flowers, paper conservator Sarah Dove, mechanically removed the construction paper window mat and corrugated backing board to the adhesive layer with a scalpel, reduced the adhesive as possible with acetone, humidified, flattened between blotters and weight, mended tears, and filled losses with a comparable paper toned to match.\n\nBW\n\nErnest Fiene (1894-1965)\n\nStill Life, 1924\n\nWatercolor on paper\n\n19 x 13 ¾”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.247\n\nErnest Fiene was born in Elberfield, Germany, and immigrated to America with his family in 1912. His sculptor brother Paul came to Woodstock in 1919, when he bought several acres of property from the artist Caroline Speare Rohland, on what today is Speare Road. The following year Ernest joined his brother, and built a home and studio on the property. In the early 1920s the Fiene brothers (and Paul’s wife, the artist Rosella Hartman) were part of a tight-knit circle of artists and writers in town that included visiting poet Hart Crane and sculptor Gaston Lachaise. For ten years Woodstock was Ernest’s principal residence, and a major source of landscape subjects for his work. He also created floral still lifes, often featuring zinnias. He was included in an exhibition of flower pictures at Wanamaker’s Department Store in New York City in 1920, which featured fellow Woodstockers Paul Rohland and Konrad Cramer.\n\nBW\n\nHarry Gottlieb (1929-2020)\n\nStill Life, 1930\n\nWatercolor and graphite on paper\n\n8 ½ X 9 ½”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027. 238\n\nBorn in Romania, Harry Gottlieb settled with his family in Minnesota in 1907. From 1915-1917 he studied at the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts, where his fellow students included future Woodstockers Arnold Blanch, Lucille Blanch, and John Flannagan. Gottlieb lived in the Maverick art colony in West Hurley from 1922 to 1934, where he specialized in depicting landscape and industrial subjects, while creating an occasional tabletop still life. A lithograph featuring the Rondout in Kingston is also featured in the exhibition.\n\nBW\n\nGeorgina Klitgaard (1893-1978)\n\nStill Life, c. 1940\n\nWatercolor on paper\n\n13 x 10”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.075\n\nBorn in New York City, Georgina Klitgaard graduated from Barnard College and attended classes at the National Academy of Design. In 1917, she married the Danish mariner, writer and artist Kaj Klitgaard. They came to visit friends in Woodstock in 1920, and fell in love with the area. The couple bought a house on a steep ledge at the end of Cricket Ridge high above Bearsville, which provided panoramic views of the mountains and valleys of Woodstock. Best known for her landscape paintings of upstate New York, Klitgaard also created numerous still lifes of flowers in watercolor.\n\nBW\n\nMary D Smith (1877-1967)\n\nHollyhocks, 1923\n\nGraphite on paper\n\n13 x 9 ½”\n\nHistorical Society of Woodstock, 2007.027.282\n\nMary D. Smith was born in Detroit, Michigan, and moved to Woodstock in 1922. She was the wife of artist Judson Smith, whose work is also featured in this exhibition. Mary was one of the founders of the Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen, and was mostly active as a craftsperson. She began producing batiks, an Indonesian technique of wax-resistant dyeing, as early as 1918. She continued to produce these designs on fabric, which she called table pieces, for the rest of her career. In 1948, she started the Crafts Cooperative in Woodstock, a shop where craftsmen could sell their goods to help fund their crafts."
