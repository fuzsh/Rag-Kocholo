        "text": "Abstract art enthusiasts can see one of Al Held’s paintings on exhibit in the Detroit Institute of Arts. Those same enthusiasts can see 13 more Held paintings at the David Klein Gallery in Detroit. While the DIA is showing Black Nile V, an acrylic on canvas completed in 1973 and part of the museum’s permanent collection, the Klein Gallery is having a temporary exhibit through April 28 — Al Held Luminous Constructs: Paintings and Watercolors from the 1990s.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed working with Held’s paintings, watercolors and prints,” says Klein, who has featured Held images as part of larger-theme exhibits. “I had the opportunity to meet his daughter, Mara, a painter in her own right, and we decided it was time to have this exhibit in Detroit.”\n\nHeld, who was born in 1928 and died in 2005 after going through diﬀerent phases of abstract artistry, had one dominant characteristic — he worked very large, often with a mural approach.\n\n“We’re showing ﬁve large-scale paintings reaching 9 by 16 feet, and we have eight watercolors, some as big as 50 by 60inches,” Klein says.\n\n“The scale of the work, the color, the richness and the depth appeal to me. I like work that compels me to have a visceral response and is not too intellectual. His work does not require a didactic panel next to each painting.”\n\nHeld’s work had a black and white phase, 1967-78, with color added to work of other times. Deﬁned geometric forms were important to give dimension to the ﬂat surfaces on which he applied his approach.\n\nIn developing the Detroit exhibit, Klein worked with Daniel Belasco, executive director of the Al Held Foundation located where the artist had a home and studio in the Catskills. “The foundation was established to preserve the legacy of Al Held, educate artists and students in the community and invite groups to see how he worked and lived,” Belasco explains. “His studio is now used as a gallery.”\n\nHeld grew up in New York, raised by Jewish parents who were liberal socialists. He studied at the Art Students League and aspired to paint social realist murals. While working in Paris in the 1950s, he began to identify as a second-generation abstract expressionist.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, he applied paint thickly on his canvases, aiming to add structure to gesture. By the end of the decade, he began using acrylic paints for geometric shapes and gave his forms hard-edged clarity.\n\nIn the 1960s, the artist showed suggestions of the alphabet, each project moving into geometric forms. He went on to explore space and volume through interconnected geometric shapes with varying vanishing points. Withthe addition of color during the 1970s, he further extended architectural dimensions of the paintings.\n\nHeld spent six months at the American Academy in Rome in 1981 and became inspired by the perspective,volume and light important to Renaissance art. Throughout his last decades, Held’s work picked up on Baroque spatial complexity and luminosity, and he found a second home in Italy.\n\n“He had a beautiful villa,” says Klein, who notes that the artist was part of the generation that fought in World War II, enabling Held to learn about art under the GI Bill.\n\n“Because he loved Renaissance painting, his watercolors show a strong aﬃnity to the way Renaissance artists created a strong illusion of space, like the checkered-pattern ﬂoors going into the distance. That’s why he chose to make Italy his second home.”\n\nHeld had served in the Navy, was married three times and had the one daughter, who developed her interest in art by watching her father in his studio and using his materials to express her own creativity."
