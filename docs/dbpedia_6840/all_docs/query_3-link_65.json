        "text": "A contemporary art space and museum opened in the quiet town of Monticello, Sullivan County.\n\nBrooklyn-based Mexican artist Bosco Sodi and designer Lucia Corredor founded Assembly in 2022 in an industrial space, a restored Buick leadership in Monticello, Sullivan County, New York. Mexican architect Alberto Kalach renovated and redesigned the building that now serves as an art gallery and museum, but ultimately as a welcoming hub for local and international artists along with members of the town’s community. Sponsored by the non-profit Foundation for the Mexican Art and Culture, Assembly focuses on promoting the work of contemporary artists. Beyond the aim of creating a vibrant cultural community, the opening of the gallery also brought a glimmer of hope to an area that has largely remained neglected. The space revitalizes Monticello’s Broadway street. Like its name suggests, it also aims to become a community-driven place where people gather to learn, collaborate, and create.\n\nAssembly follows on the footsteps of Sodi’s previous project, Casa Wabi, which we’ve featured here. While the Tadao Ando-designed retreat and art center welcomes creatives in a tranquil, laid-back landscape on a beach in Oaxaca, Mexico, this art space in NY has a more neighborly feel, with residential buildings and shops spread across the street. Both spaces have exhibition areas and offer access to a range of educational events and workshops.\n\nA thought-provoking exhibition.\n\nTo mark the launch of Assembly, the founders organized a special exhibition. The show highlights one of the art world’s darkest secrets: the huge amount of artworks that remain hidden in storage. Curated by Dakin Hart, Assembly 1: Unstored introduces art lovers to a series of artworks previously trapped in a state of “suspended animation” in the artists’ studios. Set free in Assembly, these hidden but cherished pieces put a new twist on the concept of exchanging ideas."
