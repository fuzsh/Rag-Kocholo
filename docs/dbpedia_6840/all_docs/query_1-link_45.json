        "text": "SPACE\n\nMARCH 5 - APRIL 16, 2022, Laurel Gitlen\n\nOPENING MARCH 5, 12 - 8pm\n\nDavid Byrd, Owen Fu, Ryan McLaughlin, Dianna Molzan, Yu Nishimura, Adrianne Rubenstein, Tara Walters\n\nShatner almost immediately began to explain the feeling of escaping the Earth’s atmosphere, but waited patiently while Bezos stopped him to grab a bottle of champagne, which he sprayed on the other crew members as well as the assembled guests. “Everybody in the world needs to see it,” Shatner continued. “This comforter of blue that we have around us. We think, Oh, that’s blue sky. And then suddenly you shoot through it, all of a sudden, like you whip off a sheet when you’ve been asleep, and you’re looking into blackness. Into black ugliness.” He began to gesture down and then up, speaking in the trademark cadences that are so fondly familiar to fans of his appearances as Captain James T. Kirk, the commander of the Starship Enterprise, on “Star Trek.” “There is mother and Earth and comfort, and, there . . .” He gestured into the air, squinting toward the sun. “Is—is there death? Is that death? Is that the way death is?” Bezos, a longtime Trekkie who had a cameo role as an extraterrestrial in the 2016 film “Star Trek Beyond,” nodded. “I mean, whatever those other guys are doing,” Shatner added, likely referring to Bezos’s billionaire competitors at SpaceX (Elon Musk) and Virgin Galactic (Richard Branson). “What you have given me is the most profound experience I can imagine.” His voice cracked, and Bezos hugged him again. “I hope I never recover from this,” Shatner said.\n\n—Neima Jahromi, The New Yorker Magazine, October 14, 2021\n\nThis exhibition brings together seven painters whose work explores real, fictional and imagined spaces: painterly space, psychological space, meditative space, geographic and cosmic space. In turns odd, melancholic, humorous, twee, breezy, sublime, and absurd, the works in the show share an attitude more than any unifying style or subject matter. Painting and its ability to resist legibility, to contain multitudes of conflicting emotions, to craft truths and lies, and to oscillate between medium and image, is one central concern. But more significantly each artist in this exhibition manipulates space in their own idiosyncratic and mysterious ways confounding illusions of depth with marks that rest right on the surface like jam, dismantling depth of field with clunky angles and knowing omissions, and theatrical op-art tactics that read like a formal joke. The paintings in this exhibition open up possibilities to hide things, to describe feelings, to locate desire, to dream, and to consider spaces beyond terrestrial limits.\n\nDavid Byrd (1926-2013) David Byrd joined the Merchant Marines as a teenager and was later drafted into the Army. A drawing enthusiast, he used his G.I. Bill to study at the Dauphin School of Art in Philadelphia, and then later continued his studies at the Ozenfant School of Fine Arts. In 1958, Byrd took a position as an orderly in the psychiatric ward of a VA Hospital where he cared for patients damaged by their experiences in WWII, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. For the next 30 years, Byrd’s paintings and drawings focused on his extraordinary and empathetic observations of those in his care, and their interactions with each other and staff. After Byrd retired in 1988, he settled in the Catskills and worked full-time painting from memory the people and places from his past.\n\nStylistically, Byrd’s work bears influence from different art historical styles, including Cubism and Magic Realism. A luminous, dream-like haze suffuses detailed renderings of his subjects which combine realistic portrayals with fantasy and insert unsettling psychology into tranquil scenes. Subtle colors and a dry brush and thinned oil technique furthers a forlorn, melancholic tone in his paintings. His first solo exhibition was with Greg Kucera Gallery, Seattle in 2012, and he passed away only a few months later in 2013. Posthumous exhibitions include a two-person exhibition at Zieher-Smith & Horton (2015), and solo exhibitions at Fleisher Ollman Gallery, Philadelphia (2018) and White Columns and Anton Kern Gallery (2019).\n\nOwen Fu (b. 1988 Guilin, China; lives and works in Los Angeles, CA) Owen Fu’s paintings are both effortlessly informal and startlingly serious. Often depicting spaces that are dark, or just barely illuminated, they exist somewhere between confessional autobiography and spectacular fantasy, using avatar-like actors to depict desire, absurdist humor, common joy and aching loneliness. Ghosts, lamps, candles and barely-there faces further a sense of searching or worry as they dissolve into awkward homoerotic scenes, agrarian landscapes and diffuse backgrounds. Fu has Bachelor’s degrees in both Philosophy and Art, and an MFA from ArtCenter College of Design, Pasadena. Recent solo exhibitions include O-Town House, Los Angeles; Balice Hertling, Paris; and Mine Project, Hong Kong\n\nRyan McLaughlin (b. 1980, Worcester, MA; lives and works in Worcester, MA) Ryan McLaughlin’s paintings are simultaneously poetic and graphic, incorporating fragmented text, bits of signage and singular pictograms. His pictures reveal built-up surfaces in a muted and Morandi-like palette, and errant flecks of color meet between planes, using chance to suggest off-register printing, pixelation and subtle 3D vibrations. Sharing visual strategies with currencies, manuscripts, and logos, McLaughlin’s work points obliquely to systems of visual information and value-making, with his own wry pictorial language. “Space” is also a recurring theme in a sub-series of his pictures. Recent solo exhibitions include the Atlanta Contem­porary, Atlanta; Adams and Ollman, Portland, OR; and Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne. McLaughlin will have a solo exhibition at the gallery in Fall 2022.\n\nDianna Molzan (b. 1972, Tacoma, WA; lives and works in Los Angeles, CA) Dianna Molzan is most well-known for her paintings that explore the supports and limits of painting as sculptural objects, however, some recent works evince an equally astute interrogation of flat pictorial logic. In recent paintings of doors and mirrors, brightly painted prop-like compositions are also symbolic images of public life and passages. With dramatic, pop color and optical effects, these works also evoke everyday pastimes like grooming and self-contemplation. As Molzan herself notes, “the mirror remains an essential element for transforming our animal selves into something more transcendent.” Recent solo exhibitions include Kaufmann Repetto, New York; the ICA Boston and The Whitney Museum of American Art. Her work is included in numerous public collections including the Hammer Museum, and LACMA, Los Angeles; SFMoMA; the ICA Boston; The Walker Arts Center, Minneapolis; and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nYu Nishimura (b. 1982, Kanagawa, Japan; lives and works in Kanagawa) Yu Nishimura makes paintings which echo the haziness of a fleeting memory. Using traditional painting techniques, the Kanagawa born artist blurs and records landscapes and scenes that are at once recognizable and dreamlike. Layers of faces, roadside views, forests, oceans, cars and animals rise from the muted ether of his landscapes, as if viewed from inside a swiftly passing train. Recent solo exhibitions include Dawid Radziszewski Gallery, Warsaw; New York, KAYOKOYUKI, Tokyo; and Galerie Crevecoeur, Paris. Nishimura’s work is included in many public collections including: X Museum, Beijing, The Rachofsky Collection, Dallas, M Woods Museum, Beijing, and the Kanazawa 21st Century Museum, Kanazawa.\n\nAdrianne Rubenstein (b. 1983, Montreal, Canada; lives and works in New York, NY) Adrianne Rubenstein’s vibrantly hued and impressionistic paintings draw equally from memory, cookbook illustrations and art historical referents. Armed with a personal sense of humor bordering on the absurd, her paintings have a frenetic and piled-on quality that resists formulaic and easy approaches to image-making. Free-spirited and confident mark-making, and a personal lexicon of eclectic symbols like hearts, broccoli, mugs, and fruit elicits strangely honest and transcendent moments suspended in paint. Recent solo exhibitions include Broadway Gallery, New York; The Pit, Los Angeles; Deli Gallery, Brooklyn; and Tif Sigfrids, Athens, GA.\n\nTara Walters (b. 1990, Washington D.C., lives and works in Los Angeles, CA) Tara Walters makes large scale paintings using oil-based paints, pure pigment, and saltwater from the Pacific Ocean. Stained, rubbed, and subtly iridescent, Walters’ paintings combine swelling movement and transparency, optical effects that mirror her interest in celestial bodies, prismatic auras, and other sublime and romantic visions. Recent works depict gardens, secret gates (with skeleton keys), hot air balloons, butterflies, and hidden woodland creatures, imagery that is fantastic, magic and symbolic. Walters received a BFA from the Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, GA; and an MFA from the Art Center College of Art. Her recent solo show, Dropping In (Kristina Kite Gallery, Los Angeles) was included in Jack Bankowsky’s “Top Ten of 2021” for Artforum.\n\nJACKIE GENDEL + ADRIANNE RUBENSTEIN\n\nNOVEMBER 11 – DECEMBER 31, 2020\n\nSOCO Gallery is thrilled to present an exhibition of new work by artists Jackie Gendel and Adrianne Rubenstein. This will be Gendel’s second exhibition with the gallery, and Rubenstein’s first.\n\nThe exhibition is planned in conjunction with Tif Sigfrids, a contemporary art gallery based in Athens, Georgia. Works by Gendel and Rubenstein will be on view in both locations in an inaugural partnership of the two galleries. The exhibition includes works on canvas and on paper.\n\nGendel’s recent work furthers a neo-modernist motif as a means of constructing a fiction between fragmented figure and crowd, women becoming architecture and automatons becoming bodies of unfixed age, time, location and gender. Gendel pushes the viewer to contemplate the relationships between them, highlighting the movement of her often female subjects through abstracted form. In one work featuring a large crowd of overlapping women, muted colors connect the figures, while specific details call attention to their various personas. Seen frequently in composite and profile views, Gendel’s figures challenge the cohesion of self and sociability. They appear caught in a history that may or may not exist. Gendel’s work challenges viewers to come to terms with a scene that may feel at once unfamiliar and yet recognizable.\n\nIn a similar manner, Rubenstein’s work also evokes art historical references with its likening to Expressionism. Rubenstein distorts the familiar, painting scenes that challenge one’s understanding of the everyday. Through an intuitive process, Rubenstein repeatedly arrives at imagery that can make a head of Broccoli seem archetypal in its nature. In a recent Artforum review, Barry Schwabsky noted that \"the faint resemblance her forms have to their original sources of inspiration may in itself be best testimony to the inner image's staying power, free association means more than resemblance.\" The paintings, when coupled with their titles, consistently reveal a dry wit that may subvert their almost childish emotional ebullience. Like any good joke, however, there is always a kernel of sincerity buried deep within the layers of every painting.\n\nJackie Gendel (Houston, TX, B. 1973)\n\nJackie Gendel received her BA from Washington University, St. Louis in 1996 and her MFA from Yale University in 1998. Since 2000, she has participated in numerous group shows and solo exhibitions including Thomas Erben, New York (2019, 2016), Pratt Manhattan Gallery (2017), Jeff Bailey, New York (2013, 2012, 2010, 2006), Loyal Gallery, Malmö (2012), Moti Hasson, New York (2008), and Mixture Contemporary Art, Houston (2004, 2002). Reviews of her work have appeared in Modern Painters, Artforum, The New York Times, Art in America, The New Yorker, Art Papers, and Hyperallergic, among others. The American Academy of Arts and Letters awarded Gendel an Academy Award in 2007. She participated in the Marie Walsh Sharpe Space Program in 2010, and was an artist-in-residence at the MacDowell Colony in 2005. She is currently an Assistant Professor of Painting at the Rhode Island School of Design.\n\nAdrianne Rubenstein (Montreal, B. 1983)\n\nAdrianne Rubenstein (b. 1983) received her BFA in 2006 from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design and in 2011, her MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute. Recent solo exhibitions include Deli Gallery, Brooklyn, NY; Tif Sigfrids, Athens, GA; and The Journal, New York, NY. Her work has been featured in several group exhibitions both nationally and internationally, and Rubenstein has also served as curator for numerous shows. Her work has been featured in Artforum and The New York Times. Rubenstein currently works and lives in New York, NY.\n\nMargot Bergman\n\nCabin Boy, Auntie Gladyce and Three More\n\nJanuary 19th - March 2nd\n\nOrganized by Adrianne Rubenstein\n\nSigfrids / Howard's is pleased to announce “Cabin Boy, Auntie Gladyce and Three More” an exhibition of paintings by Chicago based artist Margot Bergman created between the years 2002-2012. The show will open with a reception on Saturday, January 19th from 4-6 PM and will remain on view through March 2nd.\n\nBergman’s paintings from this time period are created on thrift store canvases, her brushwork mixed together with the found imagery creating dreamlike apparitions of the human form. The double authorship invites an easter-egg-like experience for the viewer which feels uncanny and sentimental. One sympathizes with the worthless and forgotten artifact but it acts here as a centrifugal force over which Bergman’s flower grows. Eyes, lips and a silhouette disguise and destroy the preexisting painting. Clearly defined features are body parts and point to the corporeal yet their indication feels slight, like layers of makeup or the masking of a photograph.\n\nBergman acts in transgression of the original, creating another truer original which is also a container for the past. The paintings remind you of the forbidden aspects of drawing, furtive marks done in secret or where they are not supposed be. In “Cabin Boy” Bergman paints a flat round face in profile using the sunny blue sky to humor the background and foreground simultaneously. One eye with blue shadow over its lid and a perfectly modeled eyebrow float expansively above a dreamy looking domestic cabin encircled by freshly planted trees. Red lips are outlined over a slightly darker green shrub. The portrait is enclosed by two large trees crowning and a patch of sandy road is a shoulder or shirt.\n\n“Lulu”, “Beth Jo” and “Auntie Gladyce” are portraits painted atop other portraits. Little squinched faces peer out from between the eyes of the subjects, a single nose at the center anchoring all the unfolding features. The outer eyes appear to be tired as if from witnessing so much disintegration. In “Untitled (Flower Vase Portrait)” a potted plant has bloomed two shining eyes and a leaf with a smile. Bergman’s paintings are satisfying because they breach the protocol like a tear in the sky. They sit with you like candy stored in cheek, letting light enter their fallibility and making us feel better about our endeavor to categorize the sun and moon.\n\nMargot Bergman (b. 1934) has been an active member of the Chicago art scene since the 1950s.

The appropriation is utterly appropriate. The tableaux themselves are like vignettes from within a story, and let’s say that book is a bit archaic, and the scenes feel as if you’re discovering them by candlelight. You were sleeping in a dimly lit auditorium, spiderwebs accumulating along the ceiling; there was a brief discussion of female artists.\n\nBeaded Talisman for Unwell Daughter is a painting of a woman jaundiced from illness, her face a donut slathered in custard creme—a detailed prop among frilly blankets. The subject of the work is Anna Alma Tadema, a British artist from a family of artists, born in 1867 and deceased in poverty and obscurity in 1943. Tadema is remembered as a subject from within her more famous father’s paintings, although he died forgotten and penniless too. The basis for McKenzie’s painting is an exquisitely detailed self-portrait, a watercolor which somehow survived, and a cryptic memento—a finite collapsing of past and present.\n\nMcKenzie’s work is brazen and brash and addresses its subject obliquely, informatively. She is a detective, but isn’t cool or slick about it. Her works are painted on purses and cocktail pouches, the likes of which may have held lipsticks and tranquilizers. Among sequences of pastoral bliss, not that those are ever quite what they seem, McKenzie addresses paintings so historic that one can recognize them by the heft of their weaponry. Her version of Artemesia Gentileschi’s ‘Jael and Sisera’, painted in pinks on a cream colored clutch, features bodies with marbleized flesh and a chemically hued background of tinted crimson. The sequins feel like a botched version of pointillism, swapping exactitude for a quality of faded and stained lace. Tiny ersatz pearls line the scalloped exterior of the bag, framing the piece while camouflaging its zipper.\n\nThe concept of purse as canvas stems from the artist’s observation that men don’t really like purses and so, it’s a witching spell that jokingly tells them to stay away. Gravely but with glee, McKenzie describes a history that has been abbreviated through misappropriation and a general lack of attention. Do you know that meme that says ‘We riot at midnight’ hidden in the body of a text about eyeliner? McKenzie’s paintings are a tribute to a great many such riots, inviting us to experience the joy and fascination of telling one’s story through the channels of the past.\n\n– Adrianne Rubenstein, November 27, 2018\n\nPlease join us for the opening reception of Beaded Talisman for Unwell Daughter on Saturday, December 15th, 2018 from 6 – 9pm.

Her curatorial projects include work with Night Gallery and Venus in Los Angeles, Stems Gallery in Brussels, Belgium, Fourteen30 Contemporary in Portland, OR, and Brennan & Griffin, Regina Rex and CANADA in New York, NY.

An opening reception will be held on September 9, 2018 from 4-7pm, and the exhibition will be on view through October 21, 2018.\n\nIn her second one-person exhibition at The Pit, Adrianne Rubenstein will debut a suite of new paintings, which are some of her largest to date. Working in oil on panel, Rubenstein uses vibrant colors, direct form, and confident brushwork to depict raw memory in paint. Her paintings tell stories from her life, referencing moments from the just past and from long ago. In them, she is just as much a part of the subject matter as whatever it is she is painting, taking steadfast responsibility for her role as narrator. This vulnerability and resistance to neutrality allows Rubenstein to claim nostalgia not as an indulgence but as a powerful lens through which to view her place in and experience of the world.\n\nRubenstein is equally comfortable referencing art history and art’s current moment as she is her catalogue of personal memories. While works like Abstract Painting are a response to present-day trends in contemporary art and her faceted position within her community as a painter, gallery director, and curator, works such as Ladder with Ribbons—an homage to Ree Morton, whose work has been an influence on Rubenstein—refer to art history and her formation as an artist. In her dreamlike yet vivid compositions, Rubenstein’s explorations of memory and musings on art emerge as markers of a practice rooted in feminism: the personal is political.\n\nAdrianne Rubenstein was born in Montréal, Canada in 1983 and lives in New York, NY. She received a Master of Fine Art from the San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, CA in 2011 and a Bachelor of Fine Art from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax, Canada in 2006. One-person exhibitions of her work have been presented at venues such as Reyes Projects, Bloomfield Hills, MI (2017); Fourteen30 Contemporary, Portland, OR (2017); White Columns, New York, NY (2016); and David Petersen, Minneapolis, MI (2016). Rubenstein’s paintings have been featured in thematic and two-person exhibitions including Out of Control, curated by Sally and Peter Saul, Venus Over Manhattan, New York, NY (2018); Permanent Embrace, with Walter Robinson, Stems Gallery, Brussels, Belgium (2018); Say Yes, curated by Kimia Ferdowsi Kline, Elaine L. Jacob Gallery, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI (2017); Feed the Meter I & II, Ceyson & Benetiere, Luxembourg (2015 & 2017); and Bunnicula, with Jennifer Sullivan, Marvin Gardens, New York, NY (2016). Rubenstein is an active participant in the international community of artist-run spaces and artist-driven curatorial initiatives, and she was awarded the Emerging Artist Grant from the Rema Hort Mann Foundation in 2016."
