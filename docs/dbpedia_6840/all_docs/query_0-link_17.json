        "text": "I’m pleased to share my contribution to Roxbury Art’s current exhibition “Forgotten Spaces” at the Walter Meade Gallery in Roxbury NY, on view through April 13th, 2024.\n\nThe Last Sighting refers to the remembered rural landscapes of my youth. Landscape can be an unspoken part of identity, and I feel deeply connected to those places which now are just part of visual memories which keep changing over time. I grew up in the farmlands of the Mid-Hudson Valley. This work depicts a hillside and stand of trees which were later cleared for development. When I was younger, my siblings and I explored the countryside with the vague sense of ownership over places that children often feel. But the terrain is unrecognizable to me now, and so the last sightings are only in my imagination and paintings.\n\nIn this painting, I kept the aesthetic minimal and contemplative in palette and mood. To echo the vagueness which memories evoke, I left out detail and strived to keep the forms suggestive rather than defined or detailed.\n\nThe opening of the show last weekend was spectacular. It was great to meet so many of the participating artists, and the other works in the exhibit were beautiful, intriguing and evocative of the theme, each in its own unique way. I highly recommend visiting the show if you are in the Roxbury/Catskills area. And it was great to meet Ursula Hudak who did an outstanding job putting the show together, as well as Jenny Rosenzweig, who is Roxbury Arts’ Executive Director. I was really impressed by everything about the space and the organizers.\n\n“Last Sighting” is available for sale. It’s framed in a beautiful dark walnut floater frame and available for the very alluring price of $875. If you are interested in this piece or know someone who might be, please contact Ursula Hudak at the gallery: community@roxburyartsgroup.org or call Roxbury Arts during business hours at 607-326-7908.\n\nHere are some pictures and media from the opening- enjoy!"
