        "meta_description": "Since purchasing this old farmstead in Samsonville, NY, Walter has become obsessed with this place. For the last 18 years he painted what was around him till the obvious no longer held sway. Walter Strach's process now (at least one of them) is to do the same thing everyday. Get boards, paints and brushes and go to his studio which is his car (a Honda Element with an up and down tail gate and lots of interior space) and go wherever. As most of his property is inaccessible by wheel he sticks to the driveway, lawns and rocky ledges. Maybe it totals an acre or two but one's eye can penetrate deeper into the woods. He's not sure if this was a choice (to paint only on his land ) or because he had lost interest in searching for motifs; how he was painting was of more concern. So he ends up painting the same things over and over again, ending up with different solutions. In this show the works will show varying degrees of finish; some taking years and others days. What he finds on the boards spurs him on to start other pictures. These build up in number till he is constantly working on familiar situations until they are no longer familiar.",
