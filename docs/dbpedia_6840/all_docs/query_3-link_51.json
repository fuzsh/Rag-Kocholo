        "text": "Thomas Cole was already the most famous landscape painter in America when he died unexpectedly at the age of 47 in February 1848.\n\nOne of the Hudson River School of painters, Cole lived and worked in Catskill.\n\nHis death shook the American art world, according to Franklin Kelly, senior curator of American Paintings at the National Gallery of Art.\n\n\"It was as if one of the 'grandest summits' of the Catskill Mountains had suddenly disappeared,\" wrote poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant at the time of Cole’s death.\n\nKelly has been fascinated by what became of Cole's unfinished works — and the studio in which he was working at the time of his death — since he was a graduate student in the early 1980s.\n\nMillionaire mystery: In 1970, this Scarsdale man vowed to give away his inherited fortune\n\nHistory: Poughkeepsie's Bartlett Park once home to exclusive girls school\n\nArts: College students created sculptures for Mohonk's annual Tulip Festival\n\nForty years later, he has curated a new exhibition “Thomas Cole’s Studio: Memory and Inspiration,” which looks at the painter's last years and those unfinished landscapes. It opens April 30 at the Thomas Cole National Historic Site in Catskill, and then will travel to the Albuquerque Museum in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in November.\n\nThe exhibition presents a selection of artwork and artifacts that serve as a reimagining of what visitors would have seen upon entering Cole's \"New Studio,\" including personal items such as his guitar, and souvenirs from his travels.\n\n\"Every object presented in the exhibition (with the exception of support tables and printed matter) is known to have been owned and used by the artist himself,\" Kelly said.\n\nAlso on exhibit will be 26 Cole oil paintings from the collections of the Thomas Cole National Historic Site, as well as from the National Gallery of Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, as well as other museums, public and private collections.\n\n\"The works included in the exhibition are only a sample of the many more that were in the New Studio after Cole’s death,\" Kelly said. \" &mldr; They do give a remarkably full view of the totality of his achievements as a landscape painter — there are early, mid-career, and late career works. There are finished and unfinished paintings, there are studies, etc.\n\n\"The exhibition thus provides the opportunity to appreciate what Cole achieved, but also offers insights into his creative process in realizing his vision.\"\n\nVisitors will also be able to experience Cole's working environment in the reconstructed New Studio, said Kelly, who noted that little of its original content is available today.\n\nThe property remained in the Cole family until 1972, when it and a small plot of land surrounding it were sold, and the studio was demolished, said Kelly. Several years later the family was able to reacquire the land where the studio stood. Eventually, the Thomas Cole Historic Site painstakingly re-created it on its original footprint, using the artist's original design drawings and other information.\n\nOpened in 2015, the New Studio serves as a space for exhibitions and educational programing.\n\n\"There are no photographs known of the interior of the studio from Cole’s lifetime,\" Kelly said, \"but later images show other types of objects that were probably present as well: musical instruments like Cole’s guitar; souvenirs of travel, including rocks and pressed leaves and flowers; and assorted plaster sculptures.\n\n\"It is thrilling to reassemble a selection of the art and artifacts known to have been in the New Studio and show it to new generations.”\n\nAfter his death, many famed artists of the day, including Jasper Cropsey and Asher Durand, visited the New Studio. Kelly, too, visited the Cole site when he was in graduate school.\n\n\"I was told that the house was not open to the public, but that it should be okay if I just wanted to go look at the property,\" he said. \"While wandering I came upon a place where clearly there had once been a small building — I could see the vague outline of its foundations. I did not meet anyone while I was at Cedar Grove that day, but at some point someone confirmed that what I had seen was the location of Cole’s New Studio and said that it had been torn down just a few years before.\"\n\nKelly spent several years assembling the works and artifacts in the current exhibit, but says he is still intrigued by the possibility that many more exist somewhere.\n\n\"Are there still some unlocated works by Cole that I wish had turned up? Yes,\" Kelly said. \"Cropsey, for instance, mentions an unfinished 'Saint John in the Wilderness,' of which no trace whatsoever is known.\n\n\"The largest missing piece in Cole’s late career, however, is the trio of pictures he completed for what was to be a five-painting suite called ' '\"The Cross and the World.' We have four oil studies for the series in the exhibition, but those large (8-foot wide) canvases have been missing since the late 19th century. ... So, everyone should keep their eyes open for anything that looks like it might be by Thomas Cole. As I always told my students, you just never know what might be out there!\"\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: “Thomas Cole’s Studio: Memory and Inspiration\"\n\nWhen: April 30-Oct. 30, Fridays-Sundays; starting July 1, Thursdays-Tuesdays.\n\nWhere: Thomas Cole National Historic Site, 218 Spring St., Catskill, 518-943-7465; https://thomascole.org/\n\nTickets: $16-$18\n\nHighlights\n\nCurator Franklin Kelly offered some don't miss suggestions:\n\n\"Tornado in an American Forest\" (1831): This large, dramatic, early landscape has recently undergone complete conservation treatment and is now more legible visually than it has been for many years. As befits its subject, it is dark and turbulent, but all the more effective for it. Don’t miss the figure of the windblown man sheltering behind the shattered tree at the left center of the composition.\n\n\"View of Schroon Mountain\" (1838): This is a superb, energetic oil sketch done in the studio based on drawings Cole made on visiting the site; it served as the basis for a larger work now in the Cleveland Museum of Art that has long been recognized as one of Cole’s greatest masterpieces.\n\n\"Clouds\" (c. 1838): A beautiful, small oil sketch on paper; its immediacy and freshness suggest it was done in the open air.\n\n\"Frenchman’s Bay, Mount Desert Island, Maine\" (1844): A rare seascape by Cole, who did not paint many. Especially effective, although small in scale, in capturing the power of the waves pounding the rocky coast.\n\n\"Landscape with Clouds\" (c. 1846-47): One of several important unfinished canvases that remained in the New Studio; Cole’s usual method of beginning his paintings with the skies is easily seen here, where that section of the painting appears all but complete. The landscape below is only roughly sketched and empty, except for the figures of an angel and a child carrying a cross scratched in the wet paint at the lower left. We do not know for certain what Cole intended the subject for this painting to be, but it is evidence that he was working ambitiously at the end of his life to create a series of major works.\""
