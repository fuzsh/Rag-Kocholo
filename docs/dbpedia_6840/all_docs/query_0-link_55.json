        "text": "American Hudson River School Artist\n\n1796 - 1886\n\nSelf-Portrait:1835\n\nDurand was born in and eventually died in Maplewood, New Jersey (then called Jefferson Village), the eighth of eleven children; his father was a watchmaker and a silversmith.\n\nDurand was apprenticed to an engraver from 1812 to 1817 and later entered into a partnership with the owner of the firm, who asked him to run the firm's New York branch. He engraved the Declaration of Independence for John Trumbull in 1823, which established Durand's reputation as one of the country's finest engravers. Durand helped organize the New York Drawing Association in 1825, which would become the National Academy of Design; he would serve the organization as president from 1845 to 1861.\n\nAsher Durand's Engraving of John Trumbull's Painting John Trumbull's Painting of the Signing of the Declaration Independence\n\nHis interest shifted from engraving to oil painting around 1830 with the encouragement of his patron, Luman Reed. In 1837, he accompanied his friend Thomas Cole on a sketching expedition to Schroon Lake in the Adirondacks and soon after he began to concentrate on landscape painting. He spent summers sketching in the Catskills, Adirondacks, and the White Mountains of New Hampshire, making hundreds of drawings and oil sketches that were later incorporated into finished academy pieces which helped to define the Hudson River School.\n\nLuman Reed: 1844One of early America's great art patrons, the dry goods merchant Luman Reed of New York offered critical support to the careers of Durand, the landscape painter Thomas Cole, and the genre painter William Sidney Mount, and built a gallery in his house for the display of their work and that of the old masters. From Durand, Reed commissioned portraits of the nation's presidents and eventually encouraged the artist to abandon his original career as an engraver to become a painter. Still, he would not live to see Durand blossom as a landscape artist. Reed died untimely, just the year after the completion of this solid likeness. His passing was sorely mourned; Durand reminded Cole in a letter that Reed was \"the man whose equal we shall never see again.\" The artist did not exaggerate, but Reed's partner, Jonathan Sturges, for whom this portrait was painted, became an important patron in his own right of Durand, Cole, and their colleagues.\n\nQuoted From: Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum\n\nThomas Cole: ca 1837\n\nDurand is particularly remembered for his detailed portrayals of trees, rocks, and foliage. He was an advocate for drawing directly from nature with as much realism as possible. Durand wrote, \"Let (the artist) scrupulously accept whatever (nature) presents him until he shall, in a degree, have become intimate with her infinity...never let him profane her sacredness by a willful departure from truth.\"\n\nLike other Hudson River School artists, Durand also believed that nature was an ineffable manifestation of God. He expressed this sentiment and his general views on art in his \"Letters on Landscape Painting\" in The Crayon, a mid-19th century New York art periodical. Wrote Durand, \"[T]he true province of Landscape Art is the representation of the work of God in the visible creation...\"\n\nPictured L to R.: Henry Kirke Brown, Henry Peters Gray and Asher Brown Durand,\n\nphotographer unknown. Artists were members of the National Academy of Design: 1850\n\nDurand is noted for his 1849 painting Kindred Spirits which shows fellow Hudson River School artist Thomas Cole and poet William Cullen Bryant in a Catskills landscape. This was painted as a tribute to Cole upon his death in 1848. The painting, donated by Bryant's daughter Julia to the New York Public Library in 1904, was sold by the library through Sotheby's at an auction in May 2005 to Alice Walton for a purported $35 million. The sale was conducted as a sealed, first bid auction, so the actual sales price is not known. At $35 million, however, it would be a record price paid for an American painting at the time.\n\nKindred Spirits: 1849\n\nAnother of Durand's painting is his 1853 Progress, commissioned by a railroad executive. The landscape depicts America's progress, from a state of nature (on the left, where Native Americans look on), towards the right, where there are roads, telegraph wires, a canal, warehouses, railroads, and steamboats.\n\nProgress: The Advance of Civilization: 1853Two American Treasures, Sold - Hudson River SchoolThis is an interesting story about the sale of two significant pieces of American Art. Yet, I am not sure how I feel about this. ~ Senex\n\nIn 2007, the Brooklyn Museum exhibited nearly sixty of Durand's works in the first monographic exhibition devoted to the painter in more than thirty-five years. The show, entitled \"Kindred Spirits: Asher B. Durand and the American Landscape,\" was on view from March 30 to July 29, 2007.\n\nQuoted From: Asher Brown Durand - Wikipedia\n\nHeilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThe acknowledged dean of American landscape painters following the death of Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand exemplified the fresh ideal of naturalism for the second-generation painters that came to be called the Hudson River School. Born in Jefferson Village (now Maplewood), New Jersey, Durand first worked for his father, a watchmaker and silversmith, before apprenticing with the engraver Peter Maverick in Newark, from 1812 to 1817. In the latter year, he became Maverick's associate and established and led the firm's New York City branch until 1820, when he left following a dispute with Maverick over Durand's independent acceptance of a commission from John Trumbull to engrave his famous painting, The Declaration of Independence (1786; Yale University Art Gallery). Completed in 1823, the engraving significantly boosted Durand's standing in the New York art world, and in 1825 he joined with Samuel F. B. Morse, Thomas Cole, William Sydney Mount, and others in founding the New-York Drawing Association, soon to be called the National Academy of Design; shortly after, he was elected to the Lunch Club, ancestor of the Bread and Cheese Club, the Sketch Club, and the Century Association. Under the influence of his fellow artists, Durand in the 1830s turned more and more to painting, producing genre and portraits. The latter included a series of the American presidents commissioned by the liberal New York dry-goods merchant Luman Reed, who by 1835 had persuaded Durand to abandon engraving.\n\nAndrew Jackson: 1836 James Madison: 1833 John Adams John Quincy Adams\n\nReed was also an enthusiastic patron of Mount and Cole, and the latter's talent, ideals, and success as a landscape painter increasingly attracted Durand, who was among the first New Yorkers in 1825 to buy a Cole painting. The two eventually became fast friends and, as early as 1837, sketching companions in the Adirondacks and, in 1839, in New England. The earlier jaunt probably was pivotal in converting Durand to landscape painting; however, he had begun exhibiting the occasional landscape subject at the Academy a decade earlier. Durand's commitment to his new artistic career was reflected in his first and only journey abroad, from April 1840 to June 1841, visiting Britain, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, and, from October 1840 to the following May, Italy, from the lake district as far south as Naples. With him on part of the journey were two younger aspiring painters who had also started in the engraving trade, John Frederick Kensett and John William Casilear.\n\nGathering Storm: ca 1837 Study from Nature, Hoboken, N. J. ca 1837 Landscape Composition: ca 1838 Landscape - Sunset: 1838\n\nThough Durand copied the old masters extensively in the galleries of Europe and drew frequently outdoors, his most critical encounter abroad may have been in London, where the American expatriate Charles Robert Leslie showed him, Kensett, and Casilear paintings and plein-air oil sketches by the late British master John Constable, for whose estate Leslie was the executor. To one Constable painting, Durand responded that it evinced \"more of simple truth and naturalness than any English landscape I have ever before met with.\" On his return home, Durand seemed to take Constable's naturalism to heart, fortifying his conviction by reading Leslie's 1843 biography of the English master as well as the first volume, also published in 1843, of British critic John Ruskin's Modern Painters. Durand began making seasonal trips in the hills along the Hudson River, then in the Adirondacks and New England-often with other artists or with his family-to sketch in pencil and oil directly from mostly near-at-hand natural motifs. From these, he fashioned progressively vivid compositions typically of woodland interiors, culminating in masterpieces of organic verisimilitude, such as the Museum's In the Woods, 1855. In the same year, Durand cemented his reputation as the guiding philosopher of the second generation of New York landscape painters with the publication in nine periodical installments of his \"Letters on Landscape Painting.\" In these, he ardently promoted the practice of painting outdoors from humble natural objects as the route to learning and refining one's art as opposed to learning from other art or artists. Concurrently, Durand functioned as the personal exemplar to several of the younger painters who gathered about him in a veritable summer sketching colony in the White Mountains.\n\nIn the Woods: 1855In the Woods is not only arguably the masterpiece of Durand's career as a landscape painter but, executed a decade later than the Museum's Beeches, measures the artist's striking advance in the naturalistic ideals he set for himself following his travel to Europe in 1840â41. Admiring the works of John Constable on that journey, Durand recognized the critical importance of plein-air sketching in imparting a sense of natural verisimilitude to his studio paintings. In the late 1840s, moreover, the English critic John Ruskin's prescriptions of \"truth to nature\" only fortified Durand's aesthetic standard, honing both his perceptual and technical skills outdoors and in the studio, and expanding the appeal chiefly of his woodland scenes beyond the visual to the tactile: his sylvan surfaces of bark, lichen, and moss beg the sense of touch as well as of sight. At the same time, his compositions of converging, weathered trees, their leafage filtering celestial light, evoke the idealism of Durand's friend, the poet William Cullen Bryant, who in his \"Forest Hymn\" had asserted, \"The groves were God's first temples.\"\n\nQuoted From: Asher B. Durand: In the Woods-Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nBy 1855, Durand had also been president of the National Academy of Design for a decade and would remain so until the beginning of the Civil War, testimony not only to his personal qualities but to the preeminence to which landscape had risen by the mid-nineteenth century. The mantle of leadership he had inherited from Cole, who died in 1848, is exemplified in the commission he received the following year to portray Cole and Bryant together in the Catskills in what may be the most renowned of Hudson River School paintings, Kindred Spirits (1849; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas, on loan to The Metropolitan Museum of Art), executed in commemoration of Bryant's eulogy to Cole at his death. Durand never paid greater tribute to his inspiration, yet evidence in his 1840s correspondence with Cole, since 1836 living in Catskill, reveals evolving differences between them of aesthetic philosophy; envy on Cole's part of his acolyte's rising success in New York; and a corresponding degree of estrangement left unresolved at Cole's demise. In his \"Letters on Landscape Painting,\" then, Durand acknowledged Cole's originating contribution to American landscape painting but stressed the need to advance it beyond him.\n\nKindred Spirits: 1849Kindred Spirits (1849) is a painting by Asher Brown Durand, who was part of the Hudson River School. It depicts the painter Thomas Cole, who had died in 1848, and his friend, poet William Cullen Bryant, in the Catskill Mountains. The landscape painting, which combines geographical features in Kaaterskill Clove and a minuscule depiction of Kaaterskill Falls, is not a literal depiction of American geography. Rather, it is an idealized memory of Cole's discovery of the region more than twenty years prior, his friendship with Bryant, and his ideas towards American Nature.\n\nQuoted From: Kindred Spirits - Wikipedia\n\nDespite his fervent espousal of naturalism in landscape art, Durand failed to pursue it consistently, and many of the paintings of his long maturity-scrupulously executed as most are-reflect more conventional landscape modes based on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French and Dutch antecedents. Critical acclaim declined accordingly, especially as younger painters such as Frederic Church and Albert Bierstadt pushed the thresholds of both subject and technique with vast frontier landscapes of South America, the Arctic, and the West. However, even after Durand's retirement in 1869 to his native Maplewood, he was scarcely forgotten. In 1872, he was feted at home by twenty of his former colleagues from the National Academy, and his work continued to appear at such venues as the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. About 1879, in his ninth decade, Durand painted his last picture, seven years before his death.\n\nKevin J.

He commenced practice in Elizabeth. He served as a presidential elector in the 1796 Electoral College that elected John Adams. He was clerk of Essex County from 1785-1803, and was elected as a Federalist to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Schureman and served from February 28, 1801, to March 4, 1803. He lost his bid for reelection to the Senate in 1802. In 1803, Ogden was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, where he served until 1812. Ogden was elected trustee of the College of New Jersey (later to become Princeton University) in 1803, a post in which he served until his death. Ogden was elected as Governor of New Jersey in 1812.Ogden was nominated by President James Madison as major general of the Army in 1813, but declined the appointment. He became engaged in steamboat navigation in 1813, and was a defendant in the Gibbons v. Ogden case that denied New York State's attempted monopoly on steamboat operation between New York and New Jersey. Ogden moved to Jersey City in 1829 and resumed the practice of law. In 1830, he was appointed as collector of customs and served until his death in Jersey City.

Relying on the English poet Oliver Goldsmith's Deserted Village of 1770, which recounted the visit of an old man to the site of the town where he had spent his youth, Durand's painting functions as a cohesive picture of scenery, but more properly as a landscape of memory. What the old man sees reminds him of his own past. Childhood is represented by the schoolchildren, youth by the lovers seated beneath a tree, and adulthood by the man driving the hay cart.\n\nQuoted From: An Old Man's Reminiscences - Albany Institute of History and Art\n\nAriadne: ca 1831-35Durand painted this exquisite copy of John Vanderlyn's Ariadne Asleep on the Island of Naxos (1809-12; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts) as the model for his engraving of virtually the same size, published in 1835. Ariadne was the daughter of the king of Crete who helped the Greek hero Theseus escape the labyrinth, then was seduced and abandoned by him on the island of Naxos. Vanderlyn had chosen the subject of his original as a premise for painting a lifesize nude, the finest example of such in the early history of American art. However, the original was painted in Paris, the center of Neoclassicism, where nudity in art was practically the standard. Not so in the young republic of America, where Vanderlyn's exhibitions of the painting were controversial and the artist could find an interested buyer only in Durand, who had little more success selling his reproduction.\n\nQuoted From: Asher B.

The foreground shows highly detailed studies of the local plant life. A friend of both Thomas Cole and James Fenimore Cooper, Asher B. Durand was a leader of the Hudson River School. A successful engraver, portrait and genre painter, Durand and several other artists traveled to Europe in 1840 to develop their skills as landscapists. On his return to the United States, Durand won immediate acceptance as an established talent. This painting is a magnificent example of Durand's landscape style shortly after his return from Europe.\n\nQuoted From: Fenimore Art Museum | Hudson River Looking Toward the Catskills\n\nHudson River Scene: 1846 Hudson River Sketch: ca 1850-57 Ideal Head: A Suggestion from Life - 1836 In the Shade of the Old Oak Tree: Date Unknown Indian Rescue: 1846 Isaac Edrehi of Morocco: 1840 June Shower: 1854 Kaaterskill Clove: 1866The clove, a distinctive feature or \"cleft\" in the Catskills, was one of the places most painted by the Hudson River School artists. The rugged terrain of the clove was created by glacial action and the erosive forces of the streams that cut into its depths and cascade down its sides. Palenville, at the foot of the clove, became America's first art colony.Thomas Cole painted the clove from the top of Haines Falls, Asher Durand from nearby Santa Cruz Falls, and Sanford Gifford from near Poet's Ledge. Their paintings helped Americans form a sense of national identity. Here was a quality of nature wild, sublime, and distinctly different from anything known in Europe. The clove was of such importance to these painters that Durand chose it as the setting for the painting Kindred Spirits, his tribute to Thomas Cole with poet William Cullen Bryant. The area today is largely as it was in the 19th century due to its inclusion in the Catskill Forest Preserve.\"The peculiar fidelity and sentiment of nature with which Durand always depicts trees, is eloquently manifest. The aerial perspective, the gradations of light, the tints of foliage, the slope of the mountains - in a word, the whole scenic expression is harmonious, grand, tender and true.\" Henry T.

This synthetic prospect evidently illustrates \"the great tomb of Man\" which Durand's friend, the poet William Cullen Bryant, identified as humankind's earthly domain in one of his earliest and best known works, \"Thanatopsis\" (Greek for \"meditation on death\"). The poem embraces the cycle of life and death that both raises humankind, high-born and low, from insensible matter and returns him and her to it. Barely noticeable in the foreground grove takes place an actual burial, but the wider scene of forest, field, ploughman, shepherd, mountain, and the river winding toward an infinite marine horizon betokens nature's persistent rhythms and may well hint at the deceased's eternal reward.\n\nQuoted From: Asher B. Durand: Landscape-Scene from \"Thanatopsis\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nLandscape with Beech Trees: ca 1845 The Beeches: 1845Initially titled \"Landscape Composition,\" The Beeches originated in a plein-air study of beech and basswood trees that Durand made at an undetermined location probably not far from the banks of the Hudson River. Critics of the day distinguished the painting from the art of Durand's mentor, Thomas Cole, for its freedom from the narrative and allegorical freight that informed so many of Cole's pictures. In fact, the conception and vertical format of The Beeches distinctly reflect the suburban pastoral character and proportions of many works by the English master John Constable, whose paintings Durand had admired a few years earlier in London. Nonetheless, the warm, late-day glow of the prospect, suffusing the treetops at either side and highlighting the shepherd and his flock, resonates with the Italianate and French landscape antecedents that had marked most of Cole's production and would continue to affect Durand's work for several more years.\n\nQuoted From: The Beeches - 1845 - The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nLandscape with Figures Landscape with Birches: ca 1855 Monument Mountain, Berkshires: 1855-60 Mount Chocorua, New Hampshire: 1827 Mount Washington: 1855 Mountain Stream: ca 1848 Mountain Vista: Date Unknown Nature Study, Trees, Newburgh, N.Y. - 1849 Nature Study: A Birch Tree - ca 1860 Oerwesel on the Rhine: 1843Asher B. Durand was over 30 years old and the leading commercial engraver in the United States when he decided to become a painter. Accompanied by two other beginning American painters Durand traveled to Europe in 1840 to learn about high art.This painting of a German town, Oberwesel on the Rhine, resulted from that grand tour. Durand was later to argue that American artists should not bother to paint European scenery or to clutter up nature with historic ruins. He encouraged American artists to get their inspiration directly from the nature of their own experience, the American wilderness. Durand was a major painter in what became known as the Hudson River School.\n\nQuoted From: Wichita Art Museum\n\nPastoral Landscape: 1866 Pastoral Landscape: Date Unknown Pastoral Scene: 1861 Peter Stuyvesand and the Trumpeter: 1836 Picnic in the Country: 1863 Portrait of the Artist's Wife and her Sister: 1834 Rocky Cliff: ca 1860One of the leaders of 19th-century landscape painting in America, Asher B. Durand shared with his fellow Hudson River artists a love of nature and a sense of pride in the new country's natural resources. His early works are typical in style to those of Thomas Cole and Frederic Church: large canvases that showcase panoramic views of the American landscape. Durand also excelled, however, at closely-observed studies of native flora and fauna. Trained as an engraver, the artist relished the almost scientific precision of these smaller-scale works. In Rocky Cliff, Durand trades the sky and misty mountain backgrounds of traditional Hudson River scenes for a close-up view of a wild lichen-covered outcropping topped by gnarled, twisted trees. The artist, however, communicates his wonder at the beauty and natural diversity of the scene just as easily with this intimate work as he had with earlier landscapes on a grander scale.\n\nQuoted From: Reynolda House, Museum of Art\n\nRoman Head: 1840This painting along with Durand's other \"Head of a Roman\" paintings were exhibited at the National Academy in 1842.

This one directs the eyes downstream at left to the lowering sun, which is set off spatially by the three grand elms at right sheltering a few cows that accessorize the middle distance. More generic than any of the other American landscapes in the Jesup collection, which was bequeathed to the Metropolitan in 1914, Summer Afternoon is nonetheless consistent with those other Jesup \"chestnuts\" of Hudson River School art: John Kensett's Lake George, Sanford Gifford's Gorge in the Mountains (Kauterskill Clove), Thomas Cole's Mountain Ford, Frederic Church's Parthenon, and Durand's own Beeches.\n\nQuoted From: Summer Afternoon - The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nStudy from Nature, Stratton Notch, Vermont: 1853 Study from Nature Rocks and Trees in the Catskills, New York: ca 1856 Study in the Woods: 1853 Study of a Wood Interior: ca 1850 Woodland Interior: ca 1854 Summer on Lake George: Date Unknown Summer Stream: 1858 Sunday Morning: ca 1839 Sunday Morning: 1860 Sunset Souvenir of the Adirondacks: 1878 The Catskills: 1859This painting was commissioned by William T. Walters in 1858, when the 62-year-old Durand was at the height of his fame and technical skill. The vertical format of the composition was a trademark of the artist, allowing him to exploit the grandeur of the sycamore trees as a means of framing the expansive landscape beyond. Durand's approach to the \"sublime landscape\" was modeled on that of Thomas Cole (1801-48), founder of the Hudson River school of painting. The painters of this school explored the countryside of the eastern United States, particularly the Adirondack Mountains and the Catskills. Their paintings often reflect the Transcendental philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82), who believed that all of nature bore testimony to a spiritual truth that could be understood through personal intuition.\n\nQuoted From: The Catskills - The Walters Art Museum\n\nThe Durand Children: 1832John, Caroline, and Lucy M.

A boulder resting by the side of the road identifies our glorified pioneer by name as \"Graham.\" Using funds bequeathed by one of its founders, Augustus Graham, the Museum commissioned Durand to paint this work in 1855, thus officially establishing its collection of American art.

The Hudson River School, considered by many to be the first truly American school of painting, flourished between 1825 and 1875. The three generations of artists (71 in all) represented in the exhibition of 114 paintings are assembled from one private collection. According to Judith O'Toole, director of the Westmoreland Museum, \"American Scenery's themes of changing seasons, times of day, and weather conditions, inspired artists to create different views. The artists of the Hudson River School shared an interest in portraying different views of the untamed American landscape as reflection of our unique national character, and as a way of communicating universal truths and philosophical concepts.\"\n\nQuoted From: The Everhart Museum of Natural History\n\nWoodland Landscape: 1854 Woodland Scene: ca 1850 Woodland Stream: Date Unknown\n\nRelated Source Material:\n\nAsher B.
