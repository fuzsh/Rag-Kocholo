Any notice of this collection would be deficient which should fail to commemorate the name of Luman Reed, Patron of American Art. In this connection the Society was chiefly indebted to the liberality and cordial coöperation of one of their most valued members, who was himself the chief promoter of the original design of the New York Gallery of Fine Arts, Mr. Jonathan Sturges.\n\nThe Bryan Collection, presented to the Society in 1867 by the late Thomas J. Bryan, numbers three hundred and eighty-one paintings and are designated by the letter B. before each number.\n\nThe Durr Collection, presented to the Society in 1882 by the executors of the late Louis Durr, numbers, with subsequent additions, one hundred and eighty-one paintings, which are designated by the letter D. before each number.\n\nShort biographical sketches of deceased artists represented in the above collections have been added, together with indexes to Artists, portraits and donors.\n\nThe Marié Collection of miniatures is arranged alphabetically by subjects and is not included in the index of portraits.\n\n[Pg viii]\n\n[Pg ix]\n\nCONTENTS\n\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\nTHE NEW YORK GALLERY OF FINE ARTS\n\nAND\n\nREED COLLECTION\n\nWITH PAINTINGS DONATED TO THE GALLERY OF THE SOCIETY\n\n[Pg 2]\n\nLUMAN REED\n\nLuman Reed was born in Green River, Columbia County, N. Y., in 1785, and died in 1836. He removed when a boy to Coxsackie, N. Y., where he was educated in an ordinary school at the expense of an uncle. Later he was employed in a country store and subsequently became the partner and brother-in-law of his employer.\n\nHe made frequent trips to New York City on a sloop called the \"Shakespeare,\" belonging to the firm, selling produce of the farms around Coxsackie and purchasing goods in New York for his country store. Later he became a merchant in New York and between the years 1815 and 1832 he gained a fortune. It was then that he began to gratify other instincts and art attracted his attention. He became the patron of American Art and sought the acquaintance of artists, interesting himself in their labors, giving them many commissions for work.\n\nMr. Reed lived at 13 Greenwich Street, this city, the third story of which building he used as a picture gallery, to which visitors were admitted one day each week. This room was also a meeting place for the artists and literary men of the time. The paintings after Mr. Reed's death were purchased by his friends and subsequently constituted the New York Gallery of Fine Arts which, after an uncertain existence of about twelve years, was forced to close its affairs. Eighty of these paintings, presented in 1858, are now in the possession of this Society and known as the New York Gallery of Fine Arts.\n\nThe death of Mr. Reed was greatly lamented by the artists of his time and his name has come down to this generation as the Patron of American Art.\n\n[Pg 3]\n\nCATALOGUE\n\nOF THE\n\nGALLERY OF ART\n\nNO.\n\nSUBJECTS OF PAINTINGS.\n\nARTISTS.\n\n1-5. The Course of Empire. Thomas Cole.\n\nA series of five pictures, illustrating a nation's rise, progress, greatness, decline, and fall, and the consequent changes in the same landscape.\n\nNote.—The isolated rock, crowning a precipitous hill, in the distance, identifies the scenes in each of the series; but the observer's position varies in the several pictures.\n\n(Reed Collection.)\n\n(New York Gallery of Fine Arts.)\n\n[FIRST OF THE SERIES.]\n\n1. The \"Savage State,\" or \"Commencement of Empire.\" (61½X39.)\n\nThe sun is rising from the sea, over a wild scene of rocks, forests, and mountains, dissipating the clouds and darkness of night. Man, attired in skins, is seen engaged in the wild dance and the chase—the characteristic occupations of the savage life. In the picture, we have the first rudiments of society. Men have banded together for mutual aid. The useful arts have commenced in the construction of the canoe, the weapon, and the hut; and we may imagine the germs of two of the fine arts, music and poetry, in the singing usually accompanying the dance of the savage. The empire is asserted, to a limited extent, over sea, land, and the animal kingdom. It is the season of Spring—the morning of the nation's existence.\n\n[SECOND OF THE SERIES.]\n\n2. \"The Arcadian,\" or \"Pastoral State.\" (62½X39.)\n\nAges have passed; a change has been wrought in the scene—man has subjugated \"the untracked and rude.\" We now see the shepherd and his flocks; the ploughman upturning the soil, and the wafting sail; by the shore a village, and on the hill the ascending smoke of sacrifice. In this picture we have agriculture, commerce, and religion. In the aged man describing the mathematical figure, the rude attempt of the boy in drawing; in the female figure with the distaff, the vessel on the stocks; in the primitive temple, and the dance of the peasants to the music of the pipe, we have evidence of the advance made in science, in the useful and the fine arts.\n\nIt is early Summer, and the sun has ascended midway to the [Pg 4]meridian.\n\n[THIRD OF THE SERIES.]\n\n3. \"The Consummation of Empire.\" (75X50½.)\n\nThe rude village has become a magnificent city. From the bay—now a capacious harbor, with phari at the entrance, and thronged with war-galleys, and barks with silken sails—ascend piles of architecture, temples, domes, and colonnades. The massive bridge, the streets and squares, lined with palaces and adorned with statuary, clustered columns, and sparkling fountains, are crowded with gorgeous pageants and triumphal processions. It is a day of triumph—man has conquered man—nations have been subjugated. By wealth and power, knowledge, art, and taste, man has achieved the summit of human grandeur.\n\nThe sun is near the meridian.\n\n[FOURTH OF THE SERIES.]\n\n4. \"Destruction.\" (62½X38½.)\n\nAges have passed away since the scene of glory. Luxury has enervated, vice has debased, and the strength of the mighty nation has consumed away. A barbarous enemy sacks the city. The heavens are darkened by a tempest, and the storm of war rages beneath, amid falling walls and colonnades, and the flames of temples and palaces.\n\n[FIFTH OF THE SERIES.]\n\n5. \"Desolation.\" (61X39½.)\n\nThe moon ascends the twilight sky, near where the sun rose in the first picture. The last rays of the departed sun illumine a lonely column of the once proud city, on whose capital the heron has built her nest. The shades of evening steal over shattered and ivy-grown ruins. The steep promontory, with its insulated rock, still rears against the sky, unmoved, unchanged; but violence and time have crumbled the works of man, and art is again resolving into elemental nature. The gorgeous pageant has passed; the roar of battle has ceased; the multitude has sunk in the dust; the empire is extinct.\n\n6. Portrait of John Adams, (1735-1826.) (25X30.) A. B.

BRYAN\n\nThomas Jefferson Bryan was the son of Guy Bryan and Martha Matlock, his wife. He was born at \"Spring Hill,\" Philadelphia, Pa., about 1800, and died at sea, May 14, 1870, on board the French steamship \"Lafayette,\" while on his way to New York, four days out from Havre, France.\n\nMr. Bryan graduated at Harvard University in 1823 and studied law, but he never practiced his profession, as he had an adequate inheritance.\n\nMuch of his time was given to foreign travels in forming a valuable collection of paintings. For a time this collection, known as the Bryan Gallery of Christian Art, was displayed on the walls of a spacious room in a house on the corner of Broadway and Thirteenth Street, where an admission fee of twenty-five cents was charged to view the paintings, Mr. Bryan himself being the custodian in charge. He next deposited them in the Cooper Union, and in 1867 he deeded the entire collection to the New York Historical Society, which he catalogued, arranged and added to from time to time until his death in 1870.\n\n[Pg 57]\n\nTHE BRYAN COLLECTION\n\nBYZANTINE SCHOOL\n\nNO.\n\nSUBJECTS OF PAINTINGS.\n\nARTISTS.\n\nB-1.

Simone Memmi.\n\n\"Christ, with the cruciform halo, and the elliptical aureola, bordered with cherubim, appears in the heavens. Above, two angels, strangely enough colored entirely blue, sound the trumpet; below, the Virgin and St. John kneel upon the ground, from which rises the cross, on which two angels are looking. On the left, the elect, wearing crowns of gold, mount towards the sky, under the protection of a pitying spirit; on the right, the damned, covered with blood, are delivered to the demons by a minister of divine vengeance. Jesus himself wears a terrible expression. Michael Angelo is, therefore, not the first to have given him this menacing aspect. The general color of the picture pleases the eye by its extreme fineness: the Virgin and St. John by the beauty of their types.\" To this just and graphic description from the pen of M.

Botticelli.\n\nFrom the De Montor collection.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-22. Adoration of the Infant Christ. (79½X5½.) Perugino. [Macrino d'Alba.]\n\nThe Virgin Mary, St. John the Baptist, St. Jerome, St. Joseph, St. Michael, and the Pope Julius II., are kneeling before the divine infant. Three small Angels, also kneeling, carry the nails and the Cross, emblems of the torture which the new-born should suffer. The Christ bears a striking resemblance to that of the little Jesus, so much admired, in a painting of the same artist, now placed in the Louvre, after having decorated the gallery of the King of Holland. St. Michael strikes the beholder by his noble air and his martial type. The head is evidently the portrait of Gaston de Foix, the model of the chivalry of the day. St. John is the lean prophet of the desert, the ascetic, and the eater of locusts and wild honey. At the top of the picture, three Angels play upon different instruments. In the background are seen the Capitol, the image of Roman power, and the vast ruins of the Coliseum. The head of Joseph, who stands behind St. John, must strike the considerate observer by its close resemblance to the type of Joseph which we find in the Holy Families of Raphael. In the Cherub who holds the Cross, we also find great similarity to the little Angel who occupies so prominent a position in the famous Madonna of Foglino, from the same divine pencil. From the collection Errard. Signed and dated 1509.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-23. St. John, Weeping. (20½X16½.) Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nFor the authenticity of this picture, we have the high authority of Mr. Woodburn.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-24. St. John. (13½X10½.) Oval. Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-25. The Birth and Resurrection of Christ. (11X19½.) Raphael.\n\nIn the centre of the upper compartment, Christ, draped in red, and bearing the emblematic banner of the Cross, rises from an open tomb. His hand is raised with an expression of command. On each side are two soldiers sleeping, and two starting away in fright. A slender tree also is seen upon each side of the tomb; in the distance is a large hill. In the lower compartment are eight figures, besides the infant Christ. Six kneel in a semicircle about the new-born Saviour, who lies in the middle of the foreground. Three of these, on the left, are shepherds. On the right are the Virgin mother and two Angels. Next to Mary sits Joseph; and on the extreme left, a fourth shepherd approaches. Two slender trees here also appear on each side of the composition. In the distance are heavily undulating hills.\n\n[Pg 61]\n\nVery few Raphaels of this period exist. Those which are in the Vatican and the Louvre, show, in style and handling, an exact similarity to these pictures, which is absolutely conclusive. The donor wishes it to be understood, that, in his opinion, and in that of some of the accomplished and practised experts in Europe, there is not the slightest doubt of the authenticity of these pictures. Only the inexperienced and the uncultivated fail to trace in them the pencil of the divine Raphael.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-26. Madonna and Child. (28X21½.) Copy from Raphael.\n\nAn old and admirably executed copy of the Bridgewater Madonna.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-27. Dance of Cupids. (7X10.) Copy from Raphael.\n\nNine Cupids dance in a ring. On the left, one plays upon double pipes; on the right, another sits upon the ground. This copy is very fine, as it may well be, having been made by no less distinguished an artist than Sassoferrato himself.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-28. St. George, and St. Anthony of Padua. (47X22½.) Gaudenzio Ferrari.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-29. Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew. (17X28.) Fra Bartolomeo.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-30. The Repose in Egypt. (29½X35.) Giorgione.\n\nNo. B-17 is a specimen of the ancient Venetian style, which should be examined in connection with these productions of the glorious days of that school.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-31. Prince of Palermo—in Disguise. (22X17½.) Giorgione.\n\nSimilar to that in the Royal Gallery of Naples, it is distinguished by the Prince holding a flute, and not a staff, a ring on his finger and an amulet in his fur cap. From the collection of the Marquis Sommariva.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-32. A Concert. (31X37½.) Copy from Giorgione, by Watteau.\n\nTwo men and a naked female sit in the open air, diverting themselves with music. Another female figure peers at the group from the shrubbery, which is not in the original, but found only in Watteau's Pastiche, No. B-247.\n\n[Pg 62]\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-33. The Repose in Egypt. (32½X41½.) Titian.\n\nThis composition was repeated many times by Titian, and without great variation. This repetition is distinguished by the absence of some figures in the background, and the introduction of a rivulet in the foreground, and a butterfly upon a flower in the right corner. It has twice been found necessary to remove the picture from its canvas: the drapery of the Virgin has suffered somewhat from this and other causes; the other parts of the picture are somewhat injured.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-34. Portrait of a Lady. (43X40.) Style of Titian.\n\nFrom the collection of R. W. Meade, of Philadelphia.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-35. St. Jerome, in his Study. (39X29.) School of Titian.\n\nProbably a copy by Odvardo Fialetti, scholar of Tintoretto. This is a large copy of a print by Albrecht Dürer. Its color shows it evidently to be of the Venetian School.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-36. Virgin and Child. (43X36.) Oval. School of Titian.\n\nThis picture came from the Gallery of Louis Philippe, and on the back was written \"Dans la Chambre du Prince.\"\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-37. Portrait of a Presbyter. (20½X16½.) Tintoretto.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-38. St. Benedict. (91X54.) Oval Top. Francesco Zucco.\n\nThe Saint is prostrate before an altar, receiving the black stole from the Virgin: the head of the Saint is worthy the palette of Titian. Signed and dated. Found in New York, by the donor.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-39. Abraham discarding Hagar and Ishmael. (24½X19½.) Paul Veronese.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-40. Portrait of Charles, Constable de Bourbon. (23½X19.) Ludovico Brea.\n\nFrom the collection of General D'Espinoy.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\n[Pg 63]\n\nB-41. Christ Shown to the Multitude. (45X40.) Sebastiano del Piombo.\n\nThis picture, which is in very fine condition, and the principal figure in which much resembles that in the famous picture of Christ looking into Hell, in the Royal Gallery of Madrid, was purchased by the donor in Rome.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-42. Virgin and Child, with Angels. (44X34½.) Andrea del Sarto.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nEARLY FLORENTINE SCHOOL\n\nB-43. Virgin and Child, with St. John. (10X81.)\n\nIt will be noticed that gold is used freely in the halos, and upon the draperies, which fall in somewhat stiff but ample and not unpleasing folds. This picture is from the collection of the Abbé Genoude, known as the translator of the Bible, by which he accumulated a fortune.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-44. Adoration of the Shepherds. (35½X34.)\n\nThis picture is from the collection of the Sylvestre family, and was once improperly attributed to Raphael. It bears many of the marks of Garofalo's pencil.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-45. The Crucifixion. (33X23.) Andrea Mantegna.\n\nMr. Michiels, the distinguished critic employed by the Belgian Government to prepare a history of Flemish Art, says of this work: \"The Christ has a nobility in his attitude which few painters have been able to give him; the expression of the good robber is also grave and dignified. The whole picture bears the impress of a serene imagination; the coloring is sombre; the attitudes are distinguished by an air of majesty. We feel that the artist had, at the commencement of his career, severely studied the ancients. Two cuirasses, and some of the draperies, are gilded; gold is mingled with the other costumes, in the form of traits, designating the folds. We are particular about these details, because they indicate the primitive epoch in which the picture was painted, and the manner in which they passed from the use of gold grounds to the entire abandonment of that metal.\"\n\nIt should be observed that the Jewish type is preserved in the heads of many of the figures, which is the case of the works of very few other masters. It will be observed that there are in this crowded canvas no two pieces of offensive or defensive armor alike. This is worthy of particular remark, as Squarcioni, the master of Man[Pg 64] Tegna, had the largest and most varied collection of ancient arms which existed in his day.\n\nAside from its intrinsic merit, this picture is of the greatest interest when considered in connection with the St. Jerome (B-47) by Correggio, the disciple of Mantegna. In the peculiar mode of introducing gold in the lights of that noble painting, we notice an unmistakable similarity to Mantegna's use of the same material in the work before us; thus showing the direct connection between the manner of the two painters.\n\nIt is impossible to overrate the historical importance of the juxtaposition of this work of Mantegna with that of Correggio. There is afforded in no other gallery, public or private, in the world, a similar opportunity to study the master and scholar side by side in works of unquestionable authenticity and the highest intrinsic merit.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-46. Adoration of the Kings. (19X14.) Andrea Mantegna.\n\nFound in Venice, 1859.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-47. The Virgin and Child, Mary Magdalen, and St. Jerome (known as the St. Jerome). (19X14.) Correggio.\n\nOf this sketch M. Michiels remarks, that in it \"burns in all its grace the talent of Correggio. Never has the Ecstasy of piety, or the fervor of religious affection, been better expressed.\"\n\nThis picture differs from the large one at Parma, in the absence of the emblematic lion which stands in that by the side of St. Jerome; and also in the color of some of the draperies, particularly in that of the canopy, which in this is striped, while in that it is of one color. In this, too, we find gold used in the halos and in the draperies, which is not the case in the other; a fact which points to the earlier production of this picture, and which also connects it in a remarkable manner with the Crucifixion by Mantegna (No. B-45).\n\nThere can be no doubt that this picture is the finished sketch for the well-known St. Jerome, at Parma. The marked differences already alluded to in minor points, prove incontestably that it could not be the work of a copyist, who would, of course, reproduce his original with all possible fidelity. It is from the collection of Marshal Sebastiani, it having been nailed firmly to the wall in his bed-chamber.\n\n(Bryan Collection.)\n\nB-48. Virgin and Child. (34X27.) Correggio.\n\nIn support of the authenticity of this picture, we have the first authority in England,—that of Mr. Woodburn.

How he longs for the moment in which he shall appear before the Almighty! What enthusiasm animates his countenance! I doubt if the ardor of faith could be better shown.
