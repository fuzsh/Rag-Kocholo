But did you know that the Hudson River School style of painting began right here in Greene County? A single man started a wave of artistic inspiration that can still be seen, and experienced today.\n\nHave you ever laid eyes on an idyllic landscape painting depicting a wild, untamed American landscape? Chances are it is, or owes its style to, the Hudson River School, a style of painting inspired by the beauty that surrounds visitors to the Great Northern Catskills of Greene County on the daily."
