        "text": "About Claryville Art Center\n\nThe Art Center is one of the most beautiful art galleries in upstate New York. It houses the permanent collection of world famous Russian born American contemporary artist, Alexander Kaletski, including his Retrospective: “Forty Years in America.” Anna Zorina, the owner of the Anna Zorina Gallery in Chelsea, New York City, is the curator of the Claryville Art Center. Anna coordinates her efforts between her own gallery and the Claryville Art Center which affords her client artists both City and Catskill exposure.\n\nThe Claryville Art Center has different shows during the year displaying the arts and wares of local artists as well as Anna Zorina artists.\n\nEvents At The Art Center\n\nThe Claryville Art Center is connected to the Russian Mule Brewing Company which sits between the Claryville Art Center and the Claryville Event Center.\n\nSpecial events and weddings often utilize all three buildings.\n\nRussian Mule Restaurant & Tasting Room\n\nThe Russian Mule Restaurant & Tasting Room are annexed to, and part of, the Art Center with its own display of art by Alexander Kaletski including his masterpiece “The Russian Mule“, a special commission for the Russian Mule and an amazing 12′ by 6′ oil. So come and enjoy the cultural experiences of art and beer.\n\nArt Center’s History\n\nThe Claryville Art Center opened with great fanfare in July 2014. The building was originally a barn located in the front of the property. The barn was moved to the rear of the property in 2011 and was completely rebuilt into a two story art gallery large enough for the permanent collection of Alexander Kaletski as well as a separate floor for exhibitions."
