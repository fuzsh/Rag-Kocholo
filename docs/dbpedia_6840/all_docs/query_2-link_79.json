        "text": "It’s easy to tick off many of the things that make the Northeast such an interesting travel destination. You’ve got the dazzling fall foliage, and picturesque coastal playgrounds winter resorts; a wealth of acclaimed cultural attractions; plus the region’s central role in America’s Colonial, Revolutionary War and Underground Railroad history.\n\nThen there are the things you might not expect, like the region’s thriving winemaking and winery tourism industry. In fact, New York is one of America’s top wine-producing states. Beyond the vineyards, the Northeast is showing its green side through a variety of local sustainability initiatives. There are hotels and convention center buildings earning LEED certifications and implementing environmentally friendly practices, while new parks, hiking and biking trails are springing up to encourage the enjoyment and preservation of green spaces.\n\nThe destinations profiled here are located in or near some of the largest U.S. population centers — making them very accessible to meeting attendees — and many of the larger cities offer light rail, free downtown shuttles and other public transit options that make them easy to navigate once you arrive.\n\nHere’s a glimpse of what’s waiting to be discovered when you do.\n\nCONNECTICUT\n\nThe story of the Amistad, the Cuban schooner where the famous 1839 slave revolt took place off the Connecticut coast, is preserved and retold through several historical sites in the state. At the former site of the New Haven Jail, where the Africans aboard the slave ship awaited trial, stands the Amistad Memorial, created by African-American sculptor Ed Hamilton. New Haven also is the home berth of the Freedom Schooner Amistad, a recreation of the original ship that travels on educational missions. The Old State House in Hartford was the site of the first Amistad trial.\n\nMeeting attendees and other visitors can spend leisure time at one of Connecticut’s coastal resorts, or perhaps see a show and try their luck at a casino. Along with the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford, the Foxwoods Resort Casino, the MGM Grand at Foxwoods and the Mohegan Sun Casino contain the state’s largest meeting accommodations.\n\nDELAWARE\n\nFrom hanging out at Rehoboth Beach and other Atlantic coastal retreats to kayaking in the Delaware Bay, the First State offers a wide range of outdoor recreational attractions. Cape Henlopen State Park in Lewes, for example, is a popular spot for biking, swimming and hiking.\n\nThe Dover International Speedway, Fort Delaware State Park and the statewide Delaware Wine and Ale Trail are also among the area’s main attractions.\n\nHistory buffs may want to visit Dover’s First State Heritage Park or Wilmington’s Kalmar Nyckel — a recreation of the ship on which Swedish settlers first came to the Delaware Valley in the 17th century — or tour one of the du Pont family’s opulent estates in the scenic Brandywine Valley. While finding bargains at Delaware’s tax-free retail outlets may not make visitors feel quite as rich as a du Pont, the shops are nevertheless one of the state’s top tourist draws.\n\nMAINE\n\nHere’s one for the “Did You Know?” files of a state not readily associated with Black history: The first African-American college graduate in the United States, John Brown Russworm, received his degree from Maine’s Bowdoin College in 1826.\n\nSeveral notable Black heritage attractions make up Maine’s Portland Freedom Trail — 16 sites with links to with the Underground Railroad and the Abolitionist Movement, including the nation’s third oldest African-American church still standing. Nicknamed the Pine Tree State, Maine is renowned for its rugged natural beauty. Boasting 5,500 miles of coastland, the state is home to the largest fleet of windjammers in North America. Altogether Maine’s state and national parks — of which Acadia National Park is the largest and best known — encompass more than 540,000 acres.\n\nAlong with its natural scenery, Maine offers a unique man-made photo op: the world’s largest 3-D model of the solar system, laid out over 40 miles between Houlton and Presque Isle.\n\nMARYLAND\n\nTravelers to Maryland can choose from a lengthy list of Black heritage sites to explore. The capital city of Annapolis is home to the Banneker-Douglass Museum, the Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial and the Thurgood Marshall Memorial at the Maryland State House. The Frederick Douglass Museum and Cultural Center is located in Highland Beach, in Anne Arundel County. Columbia is the home of the African Art Museum of Maryland and the Howard County Center of African-American Culture, along with an exhibit at Columbia Air Center commemorating the site of the state’s first Black-owned and operated airfield. On Maryland’s Eastern Shore, the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center and other related sites in Cambridge pay tribute to the most prominent figure in the Underground Railroad.\n\nMaryland’s nearly 4,000 miles of shoreline, including the Chesapeake Bay and 31 miles of Atlantic Coast, provide great settings for fishing, sailing and beachcombing.\n\nBALTIMORE\n\nAmerican’s oldest civil rights organization is based in Baltimore. Visitors can see the NAACP Headquarters, along with a host of other Black heritage attractions in Maryland’s largest city. The list includes the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African-American History & Culture, the Eubie Blake National Jazz Institute and Cultural Center, the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum and the Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park, which honors a free African-American who founded the Chesapeake Marine Railway and Dry Dock Company, along with the famed abolitionist and orator.\n\nArt lovers will find free admission at the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Museum, just two of the city’s more than 20 museums and galleries. Those looking for picture-worthy outdoor scenery might opt for a cruise of the Inner Harbor or a bike ride along Glenn Falls Trail.\n\nThe Baltimore Convention Center, just 15 minutes from Baltimore-Washington International Airport, is easily accessible via the city’s light rail system. Specs at the 1.2 million-sq. ft. convention center include 300,000 sq. ft. of exhibit space, 50 meeting rooms and a 36,000-sq. ft. ballroom. The city offers more than 8,500 downtown hotel rooms, with more than 1,000 committable rooms adjacent to the convention center.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nFrom Plymouth Rock, the site of the 17th century Pilgrims’ landing, to Beacon Hill, where a large community of free African-Americans resided in the 19th century, the Bay State is home to some of the most iconic places in U.S. history.\n\nMassachusetts’ maritime history is evident in the lighthouses dotting its coastline. The home of one of the nation’s first Black sea captains is one of the 22 sites on the African American Heritage Trail on Martha’s Vineyard. That island and other seaside resorts like Cape Cod and Nantucket Island are among the state’s most popular recreational attractions. Outdoor enthusiasts traveling to Massachusetts will also discover plenty more options, from whale watching excursions in Stellwagen Bank to canoeing on the Concord River.\n\nNotable cultural attractions include the Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, the Fuller Craft Museum in Brockton and Jacob’s Pillow, and the nation’s oldest international dance festival, in Becket.\n\nBOSTON\n\nIn this very pedestrian-friendly city, you can walk to the riverfront park on the Charles River, stroll along the 40-mile Boston Harborwalk or follow the footpath of the Freedom Trail, Boston’s most popular tour, which links 16 of the sites that make up the Boston National Historical Park.\n\nAnother walking tour, the Black Heritage Trail, consists of 14 sites connected to the city’s 19th century free Black community. Those landmarks include two sites owned by the Museum of African American History: the Abiel Smith School and the African Meeting House. Constructed in 1806, the African Meeting House is the oldest existing African-American church building in the United States. Reopening in December 2011 following an $8 million restoration, it now offers space for receptions.\n\nThe African-American neighborhood of Roxbury is home to the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists and the Roxbury Center for the Arts at Hibernian Hall. The Isabella Stewart Gardiner Museum will open a new Renzo Piano-designed wing in January 2012.

There’s also lots of history to explore. In Portsmouth, you can visit Strawbery Banke, a site that depicts four centuries of community history. The capital city, Concord, is home to the Museum of New Hampshire History and 20 minutes away from the Canterbury Shaker Village.\n\nA trip to the Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee Region offers the chance to tour a historic summer estate at The Fells in Newbury and the campus of Dartmouth University in Hanover. Art and architecture buffs might be interested in the Currier Museum of Art and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Zimmerman House in Manchester.\n\nIf you bring your passport, you can take an international day trip just across the Canadian border to Quebec.\n\nNEW JERSEY\n\nOne of the most interesting places in New Jersey’s African-American history was the town of Lawnside in Camden County. This historically Black community came to be when a Quaker purchased land and resold the plots to former slaves. Today, visitors to Lawnside (originally called Free Haven) can tour the home of freedman Peter Mott, which served as a station on the Underground Railroad.\n\nOther Underground Railroad sites in New Jersey include the Goodwin Sisters House in Salem City, Mount Zion AME Church outside Swedesboro, Macedonia AME Church in Camden, Croft Farm in Cherry Hill, the Burlington Pharmacy in Burlington and Jacobs Chapel AME Church in Mount Laurel.\n\nThe historic homes, beaches, shops and restaurants of places like Cape May and the Wildwoods make the Jersey Shore a popular recreational retreat. The shore provides the setting for several food and music festivals.\n\nATLANTIC CITY\n\nWith its famous Boardwalk, gaming resorts and quirky area attractions like Lucy the Elephant already making it one of New Jersey’s favorite destinations, Atlantic City is adding more to see and do. A brand new hotel and casino resort, the Revel, is expected to open in spring 2012. Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City has completed its 45-story Waterfront Tower addition with 961 rooms, 80 suites and 18 super suites.

Museum and the Atlantic City Aquarium, located in historic Gardener’s Basin.\n\nThe largest area meeting venue, the Atlantic City Convention Center, has 486,600 sq. ft. of contiguous exhibit space, 45 meeting rooms, a roof-top solar power system, a recycling program and other green initiatives. For lodging, the city offers approximately 20,000 hotel rooms.\n\nNEWARK\n\nAmong the most interesting places to see in New Jersey’s largest city are African-American heritage sites like the Polhemus House, which once served as an Underground Railroad station, and the Kreuger Scott Mansion, which was once owned by the city’s first Black millionaire.\n\nThe Newark Museum is the city’s most prominent and prestigious cultural attraction, encompassing a planetarium, an 1784 schoolhouse, the Ballantine House — a restored 1885 Victorian mansion once that once belonged to the beer-brewing family — 80 art and science galleries, a miniature zoo and a sculpture garden.\n\nA night on the town might feature a concert at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and dinner in the Ironbound District, known for its Portuguese, Brazilian and Spanish restaurants.

The 6.1 million-acre Adirondack Park is larger than Yellowstone, Glacier, Everglades and Grand Canyon National Parks combined.\n\nBUFFALO/NIAGARA\n\nThe most prominent sites on Buffalo’s historically Black Michigan Street Heritage Corridor are the Michigan Street Baptist Church, once an Underground Railroad Station, and the Nash House Museum, the former home the church’s legendary pastor, who was the son of freed slaves.

Josiah Henson, the real-life fugitive slave who inspired the fictional character in the Harriet Beecher Stowe novel.\n\nAdventure lovers traveling to Ontario can go hiking along the Bruce Trail and see the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve. The area’s diverse landscape includes farms, beaches, wetlands and wildlife habitats, and there also are a number of historic inns along the trail. Pukaskwa National Park, situated on the shores of Lake Superior, offers a variety of outdoor recreation, from camping to cross-country skiing.\n\nTORONTO\n\nOntario’s capital is the fifth largest city in North America, boasting a wide array of cultural and entertainment attractions.

Lodging accommodations are provided by more than 38,000 hotel rooms citywide.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nHistorical attractions linked to Pennsylvania’s African-American heritage can be found in both small towns and big cities. Places like the Johnson House Historical Site in Philadelphia, the Kennett Underground Railroad Center in Kennett Square, the Blairsville Underground Railroad Museum in Blairsville and the Thaddeus Stevens-Lydia Hamilton Smith Historic Site in Lancaster highlight the state’s role as a refuge for slaves seeking freedom. That story is brought to life through an Underground Railroad re-enactment called “Living the Experience,” performed at Lancaster’s Bethel AME Church.\n\nThe pivotal Civil War battle is commemorated at Gettysburg National Military Park, while a key turning point in the American Revolution is remembered at Washington Crossing, the spot where George Washington famously crossed the Delaware River.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania Wilds region, one of the state’s top sightseeing attractions has become more accessible via a new pedestrian walkway at Kinzua Bridge State Park providing views of the Kinzua Gorge.\n\nPHILADELPHIA\n\nBlack historical and cultural attractions are abundant in the City of Brotherly Love.
