        "text": "WORCESTER - A new show at Worcester Art Museum of Hudson River School painters features its most famous artists, like Louisa Davis Minot and Mary Josephine Walters.\n\nYou’ve never heard of them?\n\nDon’t worry. The show, “The Poetry of Nature: Hudson River School Landscapes from the New-York Historical Society,” which runs Sept. 8 through Nov. 25, also includes the most famous painters of the group, which is, historically, an all-male cast that includes “founding fathers” Thomas Cole and Asher B. Durand. One of the more interesting aspects of the WAM exhibition of 40 unquestionably gorgeous paintings, however, is the inclusion of one work each from the above-mentioned female landscapists, whose contributions have been largely unheralded and, in Minot’s case, only recently discovered.\n\nMinot’s 1818 painting of Niagara Falls is the earliest work in the show, which is bookended by Albert Bierstadt’s 1886 work, “Autumn Woods: Oneida County,” a sweeping 54-by-84-inch homage to autumnal glory that greets you immediately as you enter the gallery. The Hudson River School was, in its time, really not so much a formal school as a loosely connected group of painters whose love of the pristine North American landscape launched what has been called the first uniquely American art movement.\n\nAmong other artists in the WAM show are Jasper Cropsey, John F. Kensett, George Henry Boughton, John Hiram Hotchkiss and William T. Richards. The exhibition, organized by the New York Historical Society from its extensive collection of Hudson River School paintings, reflects the painters’ reverence for America’s scenic splendor at a time when rapid industrialization and the uncontrolled cutting of our once vast forests were carving unsightly swaths on the landscape.\n\nFavored locations for the artists were the Catskills and Adirondack Mountains of New York, but also the White Mountains of New Hampshire and coastal New England. As European settlers continued to push ever westward, the landscape artists followed, painting scenes from the still pastoral Midwest to the grandeur of Yosemite. The WAM show focuses on locations closer to home, mostly upstate New York and New England.\n\nHistorians traditionally trace the Hudson River School’s roots to a trip that British émigré Cole (1801-1848) took to the Catskills in 1825, when the area was still largely wilderness. Cole was so enamored of the area’s unspoiled natural beauty, so different from the smoke-filled air and factory-spawned grime of London, that he began painting landscapes, although the dominant subject matter for painters at the time was portraiture.\n\nAsher B. Durand (1796-1886), a successful engraver and a man of means, came across some of Cole’s paintings in a New York bookstore and picture gallery shop and was so taken with them that he was inspired to become a landscape painter himself. The two became good friends, an association that essentially launched Cole’s career and the Hudson River School, as the history is currently written.\n\nBut, less than a decade ago, two paintings by Minot of Niagara Falls, one of which is in the show, were discovered by an art historian combing through the New York Historical Society’s vast holdings. The painting, of roiling waters thundering over the falls (in the days long before the electric utility that now regulates water flow there) evinces a similar worshipful regard for the natural world that one sees in all Hudson River School paintings, but especially in the somewhat Romantic tone of Cole’s work.\n\n“She painted it way before Cole, in fact seven years before he was discovered,” Erin Corrales-Diaz, assistant curator of American art at WAM, said, at a press preview for the show Sept. 6. “It predates what most art historians consider to be the beginning of the Hudson River School.”\n\nThere are only two known paintings by Minot, both in the New York Historical Society collection. Little else is known about her beyond that she was married with five children and still somehow managed to have a professional art career. She is one of two female landscapists in this exhibition. The other, Mary Josephine Walters, was a student of Durand’s. Her intimate study of a pine-graced pool in the Catskills follows her teacher’s style of focusing on the nature we find close at hand rather than the horizon-spanning vistas of Cole’s or Bierstadt’s work.\n\n“We only know about her because Durand’s son wrote Asher B. Durand’s biography and mentions Mary Josephine Walters,” Corrales-Diaz said. Little is known about her life, beyond that fact. “Again, she has sort of been erased from the narrative and we’re only able to pick out bits and pieces,” she said. Corrales-Diaz hopes further research can restore the female Hudson River Painters to their proper place in art history, especially for the trailblazing Minot.\n\n“You spend a little more time researching and you realize we had a woman artist who was painting the landscape in a similar way to Cole before Cole,” she said. “What would it be like if we rewrote the Hudson River School narrative to say that it started with a woman artist and she was married, had five children and still managed to have a professional artistic career? There’s only so much we know at the moment, but it just gives us a sense that there is so much more for us to learn about the female landscapists in this school.”"
