        "text": "View press images here.\n\nYONKERS, NY, October 17, 2019 — Thomas Cole’s Refrain: The Paintings of Catskill Creek, explores, for the first time as a series, Cole’s extraordinary Catskill Creek landscapes, which he created again and again from 1827 to 1845—virtually the whole course of his mature career. His fascination with Catskill Creek, which enters the Hudson River at Catskill, New York, speaks volumes about his artistry and his commitment to the environment. These iconic images—as timeless and timely as ever—are essential to understanding this pioneering artist and proto-environmentalist who captured nature’s beauty and underscored the essential need to protect the environment. The exhibition was organized by the Thomas Cole National Historic Site in association with the Hudson River Museum.\n\nCreated during an eighteen-year period that spans Cole’s mature career, the artist’s paintings of Catskill Creek constitute the most sustained sequence of landscapes he ever made. The views in the paintings are all anchored along a stretch of Catskill Creek near the Village of Catskill, where Thomas Cole lived and worked. Part of this waterfront, located less than a mile and a half from the Thomas Cole National Historic Site, has been preserved as a public park by the land conservancy groups Scenic Hudson and Greene Land Trust.\n\nCole’s repeated attention to Catskill Creek signifies his love of the views near his home and illustrates his development of a profound sense of place. The exhibition considers these paintings as a series unified by place as well as their stable composition and recurring motifs, even as they exhibit variations reflecting changes in the artist’s life and times, including intrusive development of the landscape. During Cole’s lifetime, Catskill Creek was increasingly threatened by industry, which is represented in the paintings by significant details.\n\nThe exhibition is based on new scholarship developed by H. Daniel Peck, Exhibition Curator and John Guy Vassar, Jr., Professor Emeritus of English at Vassar College, in his book of the same title, published by Three Hills, an imprint of Cornell University Press. “The exhibition tells the story of Cole’s discovery of Catskill Creek, with its Catskill Mountain background, and his ever-deepening attachment to it over the course of eighteen years. The paintings contain mysteries—enigmatic figures, evocative human structures, and symbolic landforms—that tell stories of their own,” notes Peck. Masha Turchinsky, Director of the Hudson River Museum states, “Just as Thomas Cole identified with Catskill Creek and the mountain scenery around his home, so too do we feel re-energized in our landscape along the Hudson. Cole’s revolutionary creativity and his perceptions of the wildness inherent in American scenery not only continue to reward our close looking, but inspire our ongoing environmental advocacy. We invite all to join us and to discover something new in these absolutely beautiful paintings.”\n\nExhibition Overview\n\nThe exhibition includes original oil paintings by the artist. Represented, as well, are paintings of the Catskill Creek scene by leading nineteenth century artists who were inspired by Cole: Asher B. Durand, Frederic Edwin Church, and Charles Herbert Moore. The exhibition features Thomas Cole paintings from private collections that have rarely been seen in public: Crossing the Stream, 1827, View Near Catskill, 1828–29, Settler’s Home in the Catskills, 1842, as well as major works from the collections of the New-York Historical Society, Yale University Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Art, Albany Institute of History and Art, Olana State Historic Site, the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, and the Currier Museum of Art. The exhibition first appeared at the Thomas Cole Historic Site from May 4 to November 3, 2019, receiving superb reviews from The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, and other notable press.\n\nExhibition Catalog\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a 186-page publication written by H. Daniel Peck, with forewords by Elizabeth Jacks, Executive Director of the Thomas Cole National Historic Site, and Masha Turchinsky, Director of the Hudson River Museum. With new scholarship and interpretations of both Cole’s major and little-known works, the publication also features maps and aerial photography identifying the artist’s vantage points along Catskill Creek for the various paintings.\n\nProfessor Peck is the author of books about writers Henry David Thoreau and James Fenimore Cooper and has published on painters Asher B. Durand and Georgia O’Keeffe. His work on this project was supported by an Andrew W. Mellon Emeritus Fellowship. The recipient of several NEH and ACLS fellowships, Professor Peck has chaired the Modern Language Association’s Division on Nineteenth-Century American Literature and has served as director of Vassar College’s American Studies Program.\n\nThomas Cole’s Refrain: The Paintings of Catskill Creek is published by Three Hills, an imprint of Cornell University Press, and is available for purchase at the Hudson River Museum and the Thomas Cole National Historic Site.\n\nAt the Hudson River Museum, major sponsorship is made possible by The Mr. and Mrs. Raymond J. Horowitz Foundation for the Arts. Additional support is provided by Generation Yonkers and the Ann and Arthur Grey Foundation.\n\nThe exhibition was also supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, Wyeth Foundation for American Art, Marshall Field V, the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York State Legislature, Empire State Development’s I LOVE NEW YORK program under the Market NY initiative, Greene County Legislature through the County Initiative Program of the Greene County Council on the Arts, the Bank of Greene County, the Bay & Paul Foundations, the Enoch Foundation, the Educational Foundation of America, Joan K.
