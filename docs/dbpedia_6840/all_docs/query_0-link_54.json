        "text": "William Bradford (1823–92)\n\nCoastal Scene with Figures (Grand Manan), 1863\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Gift of Tania and Thomas M. Evans Jr. in honor of Michael N. Altman P’22, ’24, ’26 for his enduring commitment to the McMullen Museum and the advancement of the study and appreciation of American art, 2019.13\n\nGrand Manan Island, New Brunswick, is the largest and most remote of the three major islands at the entrance to the Bay of Fundy. The island, which belonged to the United States until traded to the British in 1817, is known for its striking ancient geology. The imposing pyramidal cliffs beside the beach are mirrored in the majestic cloud formations over the sea on the left. A man and woman carry a canoe towards the water, while another figure approaches a boat beached on the sand.\n\nBradford first traveled to this region between 1854 and 1857, returning often in the 1860s. Bradford Cove, named for the artist, is the only safe anchorage on the west side of the island. Many American artists traveled to remote places to find scenes of unspoiled nature as a refuge from increasing industrialization and the strife of the Civil War. The New England poet John Greenleaf Whittier dedicated a poem to Bradford which makes this explicit with reference to the east winds from Labrador and “The sea-dipped pencil…[which] beguiles my pen away from the sharp strifes and sorrows of today.”1\n\nWilliam Bradford, Off the Coast of Labrador, 1866. Oil on canvas, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nWhile other paintings by Bradford are often highly Romantic, this is a work of quiet realism. Partly due to his Quaker background, as well as the influence of photography and Pre-Raphaelitism, Bradford’s style is clear and simple in its realism. In 1867, Henry Tuckerman observed that “Bradford felt that his own success depended on minute accuracy and patient observation of local characteristics.”2 This is echoed in a later painting of a similar scene, Off the Coast of Labrador at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n1. The full poem appears in Henry T. Tuckerman, Book of the Artists: American Artist Life, Comprising Biographical and Critical Sketches of American Artists; Preceded by an Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of Art in America (New York: G. P. Putnam & Son, 1867), 556.\n\n2. Tuckerman, 554.\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nGeorge Wesley Bellows (1882–1925)\n\nOld Lady with Blue Book, 1919\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Gift of Alexandria & Michael N. Altman P’22, ’24, ’26, 2019.4\n\nGeorge Bellows is most famous for his paintings of urban New York, particularly scenes of boxing and nightlife. A student of Robert Henri (1865–1929), Bellows is associated with the so-called Ashcan School, a group composed of Henri and his followers committed to depicting realistic scenes of poor neighborhoods and their inhabitants. Although Bellows shared some of the subject matter and broad painterly style of his fellow painters in the Ashcan group, he was less interested in painting as social commentary than he was in the freedom of artists to paint whatever they wanted. Bellows’s work flitted from city scenes to those of high society to seascapes; and from periodical illustration to portraiture.\n\nGeorge Wesley Bellows, My Mother, 1921. Oil on canvas, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThomas Eakins, Miss Amelia Van Buren, c. 1891. Oil on canvas, Phillips Collection, Washington, DC.\n\nHis title for Old Lady with Blue Book does not provide the name of the sitter, but she closely resembles Bellows’s mother as he depicted her in other works (see comparison). That the McMullen painting was in Bellows’s estate at his death suggests it was of personal significance. Stylistically, the loose brushwork shows the strong influence of Henri, while the dark, restrained palette and matter-of-fact realism recalls the work of Thomas Eakins (1844–1916), whom Bellows held in high esteem (see comparison).\n\nThe black dress with white lace collar and cuffs indicates the wearer is in either “second mourning” or “late mourning.” Complex rules dictated mourning attire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and changed with the passage of time from the death of a loved one. Some widows, especially the elderly, wore late mourning clothes the rest of their lives. The other indication that this woman is a widow is her brooch bearing the likeness of a man. While the early Victorian tradition was for mourning brooches to feature locks of hair or cameos of mourning figures, by the late nineteenth century photographs of the deceased, sometimes colored, were popular. By the early twentieth century, these markers of widowhood would have been recognized by viewers even if they were fading from practice. The blue book is a sewn cloth hardcover with gold blocking (embossed printing) on its spine. The electric blue is probably due to aniline, a petroleum dye discovered in 1856 that produces dazzling colors, including a bright indigo. Such colors were common in cloth bindings of the 1860s, but soon went out of fashion as later covers incorporated more overall printing and muted colors. Gold blocking was also popular in the years following the 1849 gold rush, but fell out of style after the Civil War drove up the cost. Taken together, these clues point to the book being an antique, and possibly a treasure for its owner.\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nWilliam Merritt Chase (1849–1916)\n\nAutumn Still Life, c. 1906\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Gift of Alexandria & Michael N. Altman P’22, ’24, ’26, 2022.113\n\nThe genre of still life—paintings depicting flowers, fruits, vessels, and other arranged, inanimate objects—became codified in Dutch painting in the sixteenth century. Through the domestic subject matter, an artist expressed ideals of abundance and taste, and sometimes allegorical meaning. A popular form for collectors, it was not granted much esteem. The Académie de peinture et de sculpture, which since its founding in 1648 dictated artistic taste and style through much of Europe, ranked still life as the lowest form of painting. But the genre’s reputation changed in the latter half of the nineteenth century, when impressionist and post-impressionist painters, interested primarily in capturing the psychology of vision, painted commonplace bourgeois scenes. For these painters, still life was an equally appropriate form as any other.\n\nWilliam Merritt Chase is widely credited for bringing impressionism to America. He shared with the movement’s other artists not only a painterly, light-focused style, but also an egalitarian approach to subject matter. The fruits of Autumn Still Life were chosen as an opportunity to employ lush colors and broad strokes on a large canvas. While this is not an allegorical painting, Chase’s choice of subjects—pumpkins, pomegranates, and what appears to be a parsnip and a dark bell pepper—is still full of meaning.\n\nFruit and Porcelain, 1908. Oil on canvas, private collection.\n\nPumpkins, while cultivated globally, are native to the Americas and strongly associated with the harvest season, as they only reach maturity in fall. Pumpkins must be cooked to be edible, but here Chase presents raw wedges, drawn perhaps to the lattice of strands and seeds that make up the core of the fruit and are suited to his loose and expressive brushwork.\n\nPomegranates also indicate the change of seasons. The fruit features in the myth of Hades, Persephone, and Demeter: its characteristic arils play a decisive role in the story of how autumn and winter came to be. Their cultivation is an inversion of the pumpkins, as pomegranates, while grown worldwide, are native to the Mediterranean. Chase himself was from the American Midwest but his career brought him to study in the artistic centers of Europe. His choice of objects reflects his cosmopolitan orientation. Chase traveled to Venice in 1877 and eventually purchased a villa outside of Florence in 1910, located next to a grove of pomegranates. He painted the fruit on many occasions (see image).\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nGiovanni Battista Salvi (Sassoferrato) (1609–85)\n\nMadonna of the Cherubs, c. 1650\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, 1988.72\n\nFramed by the cherubic messengers and the golden light of heaven, the Virgin Mary gracefully shifts her shoulders and lifts her head, eyes, and—we sense—mind to God. The rotation is stilled by her praying hands that gently stabilize her figure and crystalize her complete devotion. The brushstrokes of oil paint are applied smoothly to form the perfect contours of her face, and earth pigments are blended into her creamy-rosy complexion to depict soft shadows. The texture of the drapery is slightly rougher, hinting at the material world. Mary is at once corporeal and ethereal, the perfect embodiment of the union between the sacred and the earthly in the mother of God.\n\nBorn in the rural region of the Marche, northeast of Rome, Giovanni Battista Salvi, known as Sassoferrato after his hometown, was out of step with the exuberant baroque art of his time, but his paintings tell us much about Catholic devotional culture. He formulated a unique style through studying the Renaissance painters, Perugino, Andrea del Sarto, and especially Raphael, and classically minded seventeenth-century painters, such as Domenichino and Guido Reni, but restrained their palettes, compositions, and sense of energy. Sassoferrato dedicated himself to making images of the Virgin Mary. He developed a handful of types and repeated the compositions with small variations. At the time of his death, his inventory recorded 105 paintings in his possession, of which seventy were Madonna images.1\n\nGuido Reni (1575–1642), The Immaculate Conception, 1627. Oil on canvas, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nAs a Boston College undergraduate, Christine Papastamelos ’14, interpreted Sassoferrato’s Madonna of the Cherubs in the context of the Catholic Reformation: “The image of Mary as heaven bound and without child epitomizes the [Catholic] Marian theological position of the seventeenth century.” The painting celebrates Mary’s essential role in salvation and the grace that God uniquely bestowed upon her. Sassoferrato’s Madonna of the Cherubs is a short-hand version of the iconography of the Immaculate Conception, the belief that the Virgin Mary was exempt from original sin. Due to its size, the painting most likely functioned as a devotional work in a private setting, in comparison to Reni’s full length Conception (see image) that codified this iconography.\n\nSassoferrato’s Madonnas appealed to the Catholic faithful during his own day as well as succeeding centuries, with numerous popes prizing his paintings. Pius VII (1800–23) had a print made of his Madonna in Prayer to disseminate the image widely. The provenance of Boston College’s painting is unknown until 1947 when it was recorded in a photograph of Bapst Library.\n\nPraying hands were a key motif for Sassoferrato, and the McMullen Museum owns his drawing of this theme.\n\n1.

Oil on copper, National Gallery, London.\n\nCornelis Bloemaert (1603–92), after Annibale Carracci, Montalto Madonna, late 1630s. Engraving, British Museum, London.\n\nThe Holy Family is a reverse copy of a detail of Annibale Carracci’s famous Montalto Madonna, c. 1598–1600, now in the National Gallery, London1 (see image). Though small and partial, the painting tells the story of Italian art from the High Renaissance in the sixteenth century to the eighteenth-century Grand Tour, as well as the enduring appeal of this classical art tradition in nineteenth-century Boston.\n\nIn The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects of 1672, Giovan Pietro Bellori extolled Annibale Carracci (1560–1609) as the painter who restored Italian art to the ideal, harmonious style established by the celebrated Raphael (1483–1520), and he praised the beauty of Carracci’s Holy Family, made for Cardinal Alessandro Peretti Montalto. The so-called Montalto Madonna represents the robust yet elegant figures of the Virgin Mary and Christ Child, engaged physically and psychologically with the young John the Baptist on the left and Joseph on the right. Grounded in a monumental interior set against a naturalistic landscape, this interconnected and balanced figural group is the perfect blend of earthly domesticity and heavenly grace.\n\nAs an undergraduate at Boston College, Dr. Annie McEwen Maloney ’14 argued that this type of painting was prized by eighteenth-century Grand Tourists, educated Northern European travelers schooled in ancient history, literature, and art who were eager to see Renaissance art. Because original Raphael and Carracci paintings were rarely for sale, as Bellori said, “this little picture was copied continuously while it was in the Villa Montalto in Rome, it was already being worn away in the hands of copyists.”2 The McMullen copy could have been made to satisfy the demand for this renowned image. But it was not made directly from the original because the dimensions and colors differ and the composition is reversed. Instead, it might have been made from the engraving by Cornelis Bloemaert (see image).\n\nMcEwan’s research determined that unlike the original Montalto Madonna, which was eventually acquired by Sir Archibald Campbell of Succoth, Scotland, the McMullen Holy Family was not purchased by an English Grand Tourist. Instead, Isabella Curtis of Boston (1832–1915) bought the painting in Siena during her Grand Tour in the nineteenth century. In 1912, Isabella and her sister Mary gave the Holy Family to Mary Jane Regan (1842–1925), librarian of the Boston Athenæum. A devout Irish Catholic immigrant, Regan must have considered Boston College an appropriate home for the Holy Family, which she presumably donated to the University by 1933.3\n\n1.

Oil on panel, Museo del Prado, Madrid.\n\nParmigianino, The Madonna and Child, c. 1527–30. Oil on panel, Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth.\n\nFirst documented in 1933 in Bapst Library at Boston College, this graceful yet sturdy Madonna presents her child with an air of knowing confidence while he sits upright, ever so slightly springing forward, to bless the viewer. Mother and child are interrelated, yet autonomous, figures, connected by a deep human bond but aware of their sacred mission. Together, they foretell the future of the Christ Child, the Savior. The quasi-iconic central figures are offset by the diagonal placement of the elderly Joseph in the upper right corner and the infant John the Baptist at lower left, who dynamically leans forward to witness the Savior. The universal Catholic subject and the small dimensions indicate that the painting functioned as a private devotional work. The idealized beauty of the Madonna symbolizes her inner, spiritual grace.\n\nThe refinement of the poses, the physiognomies of small, elongated features, the preciosity of details, such as the tight curls of John the Baptist’s hair, and the complex coloristic effects in the draperies and the sky, recall the work of Parmigianino (Girolamo Francesco Maria Mazzola, 1503–40). Trained by his printmaking family in Parma, in the Emilian region of northern Italy, Parmigianino displayed a precocious talent for painting. In 1524, the young artist moved to Rome, where he sought to become a new Raphael, the great Renaissance painter who had died four years earlier. To win the patronage of Pope Clement VII, Parmigianino brought with him his first mature work, the Holy Family with Angels, c. 1524, now in the Museo del Prado (see image). In Rome, he made devotional paintings that combine the lessons of Raphael as well as Leonardo and Michelangelo, with his distinctive idealism and elegance known as mannerism, as seen in the Madonna and Child, c. 1527–30, in the Kimbell Art Museum (see image).\n\nDespite the affinities of style between the McMullen Holy Family and these paintings, differences in the handling of the paint suggest that this painting is not by the hand of Parmigianino but rather an as-yet unidentified painter of the Emilian school following the master.\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nPierre Subleyras (1699–1749)\n\nMeal at the House of Simon the Pharisee, c. 1737\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, 1988.38\n\nPierre Subleyras, Meal at the House of Simon Pharisee, 1737. Oil on canvas, Louvre, Paris.\n\nPaolo Veronese, Meal at the House of Simon Pharisee, 1567–70. Oil on canvas, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan.\n\nPierre Subleyras left France in 1728 when he was awarded a prestigious Grand Prix by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture to study in Rome. He worked in that city as one of the most celebrated painters, draftsmen, and printmakers for the rest of his life. In 1737 Subleyras received his greatest commission from the Canons Regular of St. Augustine at the Lateran for a monumental painting of the Meal at the House of Simon the Pharisee (see image) to hang in the refectory of their monastery, Santa Maria Nuova at Asti, near Turin. Napoleon’s armies seized the painting in 1799, transporting it to Paris where it eventually became the property of the Louvre.\n\nThe McMullen painting, along with another in the Louvre and one in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, appears to be either a preliminary sketch for or a smaller version of the Asti painting. Shortly after its completion in 1738, Subleyras produced an engraving to circulate the image of his famous painting, and in 1748 Subleyras’s wife, Maria Tibaldi, completed a miniature copy in watercolor on vellum (now in the Musei Capitolini in Rome) based on one of the smaller oil sketches.1 The scene of a sumptuous banquet captured in a moment of time follows the tradition of biblical paintings, with attention to still life details inspired by the Venetian Renaissance artist Paolo Veronese (1528–88) (see image).\n\nThe composition in all the versions is nearly the same with minor differences. In the monumental painting, Subleyras has the serving boy in the foreground face Christ, thereby enhancing the drama; in the smaller versions the boy turns toward the viewer. All depict the story from Luke 7:36–50 recounting that Christ agreed to dine at the home of an ungracious host, Simon the Pharisee, who did not offer him the usual hospitality. During the meal, a penitent prostitute, depicted on the left, knelt to wash Christ’s feet with her tears and tresses and anointed them with oil from an alabaster container, which lies open on the floor.

Her remorse and desire to serve Christ provide a lesson to Simon, the host, one of the two turbaned figures conferring at the other end of the table about what they have witnessed.

Lynch Collection, 2021.18\n\nAlbert Bierstadt was fascinated with the epic grandeur of the American landscape. With his brothers Charles and Edward, he capitalized on the new invention of stereoscopic photography. They opened a photography shop in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1859 and in 1860 published a catalogue of photos of the American West and views of the White Mountains of New Hampshire taken from viewpoints chosen by Albert.\n\nAlbert Bierstadt in a trick photograph by Charles Bierstadt, 1861. Carte de visite album of Edward Anthony, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nThe White Mountains were a popular destination in the growing tourist trade, and Bierstadt painted there often, visiting at least seven times between 1852 and 1886. This painting is refreshingly naturalistic, in contrast with some of his earlier works that combined imaginary European castles with the New Hampshire landscape. The heavily loaded hay wagon is returning to the farm, the harvest now secure from being ruined by the rain. The soon-to-be-lost light dances across the canvas, illuminating the hay wagon, workers, and slices of the landscape. Is the approaching storm perhaps a metaphor for the onset of the Civil War? Stormy weather was a fundamental symbol in nineteenth-century literature and art, and Bierstadt was sophisticated in the use of imagery to mirror emotion. His interrogation of reality can be seen here in a double image of the artist pouring himself tea, echoing a similar photo of the French realist Gustave Courbet.\n\nStorm in the Mountains, c. 1870. Oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nNature is the subject of most of Bierstadt’s paintings. A few depict European sites, primarily in the Alps. But most represent scenes in America; the majority of these were painted during Bierstadt’s extensive traveling in the mountainous areas of the West. Many of the mountain paintings are simply entitled “Rocky Mountains,” while others identify their location, for example, Mount Rainier. In addition to the paintings of mountains, there are many others that represent various natural sites. Some show winter scenes, at Yosemite, for example. Others depict rivers such as the Hudson, lakes such as Lake Tahoe, waterfalls as at Niagara, forests such as those in California where the giant redwood trees are located. Storms also figure prominently in many of Bierstadt’s paintings. In Storm in the Mountains (see image), Bierstadt represents the storm as a black mass sweeping across the valley with an off-white cloud suspended above it. The valley is empty of everything human; the landscape is pure nature. On the other hand, in the present work, The Approaching Storm, everything is different. The White Mountains lie in the distance, in contrast to the overpowering presence of the mountains in the other painting. Moreover, the scene is set on a field, an agricultural site, not a valley surrounded by mountains. The remainder of the subtitle identifies the objects in the scene, the hay wagon and figures, presumably the figures of the humans and the horses. The horse and rider on the right side of the picture head away from the approaching storm; another figure leads a child in the same direction, and the hay wagon (with two youths on top) is drawn also in this direction by two white horses. Yet hardly less than in Storm in the Mountains, the storm can be seen raging and threatening. What the painting makes visible is the flight of humans confronted by the force of nature, their flight from the field of their everyday labor, driven in hopes of reaching shelter from the storm.\n\nSaco River valley and the White Mountains from Cathedral Ledge (photo: Vivek Joshi, July 2023).\n\nToday, the White Mountains in New Hampshire are largely covered by forest (see image). This detailed painting is a reminder that in the mid-nineteenth century most of the land was cleared for agriculture—in this case growing hay in the flat valley and grazing land for sheep on the mountainsides. This is clearly a late summer scene, likely in the Saco River valley. We are lucky that Bierstadt provided such a careful record of a moment in time, because the forces of land conservation and climate change mean that the White Mountain landscape looks different now than it did a century and a half ago. What has not changed are the hard granite and metamorphic rocks that appear as boulders in the foreground and cliff bands in the background.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nAlbert Bierstadt (1830–1902)\n\nNear the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, 1863\n\nOil on panel\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S. Lynch Collection, 2022.45\n\nThis idealized view of an unspoiled natural landscape, with a soft glow of the setting sun, beckons the viewer toward the Rocky Mountains while deer drink peaceably from a pristine lake. The artist juxtaposes the sublimity of the mountains with a vision of a rich and hospitable landscape seemingly fated for west-bound settlers, reflecting the concept of “manifest destiny.”\n\nAlbert Bierstadt Brothers, Albert Bierstadt at His Easel, 1859. Stereograph (detail), private collection.\n\nBierstadt first traveled to the American West in 1859 as part of a survey expedition, followed by a second trip in 1863. He made oil sketches and drawings and chose views for stereographs. Bierstadt traveled as far as the South Pass of the Continental Divide in southwest Wyoming. The South Pass was the easiest route to California and the Pacific Northwest and had long been used by Native Americans. It was followed by wagon trains in the 1840s and 1850s as a key part of the Oregon Trail, and was the route of the transcontinental railway completed in 1869.\n\nWith notes and photographs, Bierstadt would later finish his paintings in his studio in the Tenth Street Studio building in New York City, surrounded by Native American artifacts (see image).\n\nThis work was created following Bierstadt’s first trip out West in 1859, when he accompanied Frederick W. Lander’s survey party to Nebraska Territory to determine the route of the transcontinental railroad. Bierstadt produced numerous photographs and sketches, which he then referenced in his New York studio. The South Pass was a significant locale where the Oregon Trail crossed the Continental Divide, a stretch that had tested numerous overland travelers. But by 1863, parts of the trail had been replaced by stagecoaches—and soon by the railroad. Paintings like this one invited his audience West in accordance with the idea of “manifest destiny” that envisioned white settlement of the West as inevitable and divinely ordained. His Romantic view of this Rocky Mountain landscape, with deer drinking from a luminous river, portrayed a timeless frontier that would soon be transformed.\n\nNo landscapes were more compelling to Bierstadt than those he observed in the Rocky Mountains. Among his paintings of the Rockies, there are depictions of sublime, snow-capped peaks, of violent storms in the mountains, of the colorful glow of sunsets over the mountains, of peaceful lakes and woods backed by mountain ranges. Many prominent contemporary critics praised Bierstadt’s work; for instance, in response to one of the artist’s paintings of a storm in the Rockies, one wrote: “No more genuine and grand work has been produced in landscape art.” An art historian described Bierstadt’s paintings: “He seeks to depict the absolute qualities and forms of things. The botanist and geologist can find work in his rocks and vegetation. He seizes upon natural phenomena with naturalistic eyes. In the quality of American light, clear, transparent, and sharp outlines, he is unsurpassed.” The painting Near the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains depicts much of what belongs to a peaceful, natural landscape: distant, unthreatening mountains, rocks and trees as they occur by nature, untouched by human intervention, a pond reflecting muted sunlight, two deer next to the pond, one drinking from it. The work as a whole gathers all that belongs most conspicuously to nature—earth, water, living beings both animate and arboreal. Peter Lynch regards Near the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains as one of his favorites. He recalls that he was inspired to acquire it following one of his more than twenty-five visits to US National Parks with his wife and three daughters.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nAlbert Bierstadt (1830–1902)\n\nOwens Valley, California, c. 1872\n\nOil on panel\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S. Lynch Collection, 2022.44\n\nBierstadt lived in California with a studio in San Francisco between 1871–73. He met the innovative photographer Eadweard Muybridge and traveled with him and the geologist Clarence King to the new Yosemite National Park in 1872. Muybridge photographed Native Americans and Bierstadt sketched the landscape and indigenous peoples. A stereoscopic photograph (see image) by Muybridge shows Bierstadt sketching out of doors, flanked by Native Americans.\n\nEadweard Muybridge (1830–1904), Albert Bierstadt’s Studio, 1872.

The Owens River and Lake area, two hundred miles north of Los Angeles and near Death Valley, was famed for its wildlife, particularly migratory birds. The river was diverted to Los Angeles in 1913, crippling the agricultural economy of Owens Valley, and leading to the “California Water Wars” that provided the plot for the film Chinatown (1974).\n\nTop: Valley of the Yosemite, 1864.

Oil on canvas, Birmingham Museum of Art.\n\nAlbert Bierstadt’s portrayals of beauty and plenty shaped the popular image of the American West. Bierstadt reassured Americans wracked by civil war that their young democracy possessed the grandeur of Europe—and might endure just as long. His sublime, tranquil paintings of Yosemite Valley in 1864–65 (see images) are one reason the United States has a National Park Service. Yet just as the creation of national parks led to the dispossession of Native communities, Americans who flocked to western lands often utterly remade those landscapes. Still water fills Bierstadt’s 1872 image of California’s Owens Valley; evening light reflects over a lush lakeside scene. Yet by the 1910s, that Owens Valley water was being pumped hundreds of miles to slake the thirst of the booming new oil town, Los Angeles. Desperate landowners in the 1920s set dynamite blasts in a failed campaign to sabotage the pipeline with which LA was sucking their lake dry. Bierstadt’s skill captured the bountiful grace of a valley his art was helping transform.\n\nWith thanks for lively discussions in the Boston College History/Environmental Studies class “This Land is Your Land: A Survey of US Environmental History” as well as the Boston College Bodies & Places workshop.\n\nThe Hetch Hetchy Valley, 1873, Oil on paper, laid on board.\n\nBierstadt traveled extensively out West in the summer of 1872, visiting Yosemite and the Owens Valley on the east side of the Sierra Nevada. In this painting, he captured the serene setting of the Owens Valley with the Mount Whitney mountain range in the background less than a decade after white wars against local Paiutes and Shoshone Indians opened the region for permanent white settlement. The work also offers a view of the valley wetlands some three decades before the city of Los Angeles would divert the Owens River for its own use, turning the area into a semi-desert. Like Bierstadt’s 1873 painting of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite (see image), which was later flooded by the city of San Francisco for a reservoir, his works show us the dazzling landscapes of the Sierra Nevada before they were transformed by urban demands for water in the arid West.\n\nToday, Owens Valley is primarily a desert situated between the Sierra Nevada and Inyo Mountains of eastern California. However, in 1872 the valley was a watery paradise, as Bierstadt’s painting attests. Before Los Angeles took the water from Owens Valley in the early 1900s, Owens Lake filled the valley, offering an attractive refuge for animal and plant life and human visitors. Just west of Owens Lake, majestic Mount Whitney stands over fourteen thousand feet high in the Sierra Nevada. This painting likely looks east at a sunrise over the Inyo Mountains. The year 1872 was notable in eastern California because the 7.9 magnitude Owens Valley earthquake uplifted the Sierra Nevada about ten feet in a major fault movement. Bierstadt may have experienced the earthquake around the time of the painting’s creation.\n\nAlthough Albert Bierstadt was born in Germany, he grew up in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He traveled extensively, returning repeatedly to Europe, where he had the opportunity to meet a number of internationally renowned figures. In Rome he and his wife visited the composer Franz Liszt, and in London he became acquainted with the American poet and educator Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. One of the most profound influences on his later work was a mountain climbing adventure in the Apennines, where, from above, he could observe the features of the mountainous terrain. This experience portended his engagement in producing paintings of mountain scenes, which became ever more enthralling as he traveled across the United States, painting in grand style the magnificent mountains, as in Yosemite, and the seemingly endless expanse of the prairies. To a friend he wrote: “The color of the mountains and of the plains, and, indeed, that of the entire country, reminds one of the color of Italy; in fact, we have here the Italy of America in a primitive condition.” Bierstadt traveled along the routes leading finally to California, and it was there that he produced his painting of Owens Valley. Even though the landscape itself is less than Italianate, the colors could indeed have reminded him of the light he had once observed in Italy—the reddish shades of dusk, the increasing darkness of the lake and the trees.\n\nOwens Lake in 2013 (photo: Kirk Siegler).\n\nBierstadt’s painting of a silhouette of a pair of herons and trees with a twilit sky behind provides a glimpse of how this place looked before much of its water was diverted to irrigate the farm fields and orange groves of southern California and fuel the growth of Los Angeles. Owens Valley is still one of the most beautiful places on Earth, but it would be hard to recreate this scene, as many of these wetlands are now dry salt flats (see image). The position of the sun and the distant mountains suggests sunrise because Bierstadt does not depict the steep front of the Sierra Nevada, which defines the western side of the valley. Another interesting aspect to contemplate is that Bierstadt visited Owens Valley in summer 1872, just a few months after a major earthquake. Evidence of this event can still be seen today, as ridges that show the Sierra Nevada pushed twenty feet up relative to the valley floor along the fault line. The painting does not provide obvious evidence of the earthquake, but Bierstadt must have seen the aftermath in both the sparsely populated settlements and the natural landscape.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nWilliam Bradford (1823–92)\n\nAmong the Ice Floes, 1878\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S. Lynch Collection, 2022.46\n\nTop: William Bradford, Steamer and Iceberg, 1873. Photograph, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Bottom: Nipped in the Ice, hand-colored lithograph, published by Currier & Ives, after painting attributed to William Bradford, after 1877, Mystic Seaport Museum.\n\nWilliam Bradford was a largely self-taught painter, drawn to scenes he described as “wild, strange and magnificent.” He instigated several expeditions to the Arctic, supplementing his sketches with photographs of the natural beauty and dangers of the polar regions. Reflecting popular interest in the heroic and frequently tragic voyages of explorers and whalers, he published a book titled The Arctic Regions, Illustrated with Photographs Taken on an Art Expedition to Greenland (1873). Bradford also provided images of these exotic and forbidding seascapes for mass produced lithographs by Currier & Ives (1835–1907). In this painting, small figures of sailors toil on the ice, while their three-masted ship sits with sails furled. Large icebergs balance the composition, and a distant vessel is shrouded in mist. It is an image of perilous work, adventure, and the sublimity of the polar regions.\n\nCaught in the ice floes, a group of men face a perilous moment in the Arctic. The painter, William Bradford, had confronted a comparable situation himself. In 1869, he traveled up the west coast of Greenland, turning back only when ice threatened to trap his ship in the uppermost reaches of Baffin Bay. This painting captures the overwhelming desolation that Bradford encountered there, where he saw what he described as an infinite expanse of ice that lay “perfectly unbroken, except where great icebergs pierced through it.”1 To capture the vastness of the landscape, Bradford here juxtaposes the triple masted ship in the foreground with a similar vessel in the distance, which appears miniature in comparison with the iceberg at the composition’s center. Ant-sized men shuttle across the ice between the ships, scarcely visible through the haze.\n\n“Hunting by steam, the party killing six polar bears in one day. Melville Bay Aug 10th 1869.” William Bradford, The Arctic Regions.\n\nAlthough Bradford based the painting on his experience, he did not seek to create a faithful record of his voyage. He generally composed his Arctic paintings by combining sketches from his trip, scenes recorded by the two photographers who accompanied him, and elements of his own invention. The ship in the foreground of this painting resembles the vessel from Bradford’s expedition, the Panther, but with a notable modification: Bradford here eliminates the smokestack for the Panther’s coal-fired steam engine, indicating that the men in the painting must rely on sail alone to extricate themselves from their predicament. Photographs of the Panther (see photo), by contrast, show a dark plume of smoke billowing from its chimney as it burns through the five hundred tons of coal that it carried as fuel.2 That carbon-loaded exhaust would, unbeknownst to Bradford, come to threaten the existence of the Arctic landscape that had struck him as boundless and eternal.\n\n1.

For the fuel capacity of the ship, see John Wilmerding, William Bradford, 1823–1892 (New Bedford: Whaling Museum of New Bedford, 1970), 16.\n\nViewed in the context of climate change, Bradford’s paintings depicting the frozen polar regions from one hundred fifty years ago conjure up feelings of anxiety and reminiscence in a geoscientist. Anxiety, because such Arctic scenes have already become far less pervasive than they were in Bradford’s time and point to a troubling climate future that is upon us. Reminiscence, because those icy scenes may someday be gone forever, preserved now only in memories, illustrations, and paintings like this and his Trapped in Packed Ice nearby. Every September, Arctic sea ice melts and reaches its annual minimum extent. Warming climates have reduced the areal coverage and thickness of Arctic sea ice by about 60 percent since 1878 when Bradford painted this work (see figures 1a, 1b), and all of that reduction has occurred since c. 1970. At its present rate of decline, summer Arctic sea ice will be completely gone sometime in the latter half of this century. While the opening of shipping lanes in the Arctic might seem attractive to mariners like the souls pictured in Bradford’s works (like the fabled Northwest Passage that opened for the first time in 2012, see figure 1c), the accompanying consequences of global warming will far outweigh this apparent benefit. Ice, a majestic blue-tinted rock in its own right, is slowly fading from the surface of planet Earth for the first time in human history. Bradford’s painting captures its story.\n\nArctic expeditions—like those depicted in this painting and Trapped in Packed Ice by William Bradford—were exercises in extremity. Driven toward the impossibly remote landscapes of the Arctic Circle, sailors endured extreme temperatures and traversed a harsh and unfamiliar ecosystem where the sun shines constantly in the summer and darkness falls for months every winter.\n\nHundreds of ships sought the perils of the ice over the course of the nineteenth century—to scout out and forge faster trade routes through the Arctic Circle. Most ships carried about fifty men, traveled in small fleets, and were provisioned for voyages of two to three years. Many were funded by European national governments, who imagined themselves to be building the infrastructure for global trade—through the icy ends of the Earth.\n\nWithin this world of extremes sits American painter William Bradford, cold—shivering, despite his layers of winter wear—sketching, drafting, and painting in subzero temperatures. This work captures the domineering, ice-chiseled landscape of the Arctic, where icebergs tower over ships, rendering sailors miniscule by comparison. Bradford’s brush also elaborates the eerie and uncanny light of the North for his viewers: Among the Ice Floes is haunted by haze and shadow. Light was scarce in the Arctic; Bradford’s brush finds it, pulls it from the frozen context, and works against the elements to preserve its effect in scenes on canvas.\n\nIn some respects, the Arctic expeditions of the nineteenth century were failures—the ice-bound passage was not a viable trade route, thousands of human lives were lost seeking it out, and the expeditionary and capitalistic values that charted the paths of these ships continue to be driving forces of climate change. These paintings by Bradford are some of the greatest successes of the expeditions (along with the travel narratives, ship-made newspapers, and other testaments to human fortitude under extreme environmental conditions). Bradford’s paintings attest to the formidable and otherworldly nature of the Arctic as it was in the nineteenth century—and inspire respect for a landscape that faces the greatest threat to climate change today.\n\nFor a nonfiction study of a broad range of polar media, read Hester Blum’s The News at the End of the Earth.

In 1871, thirty-three whaling ships, many from New England, were trapped and destroyed by pack ice off the Alaska coast. The motif of the “storm-tossed boat” was a key symbol of the perils of the “voyage of life” from the Romantic era onward, as seen in haunting images by the German painter Caspar David Friedrich (1774–1840). The delicate structure of the masts and rigging is juxtaposed with the implacable solidity of the massive icebergs. The small forms of the sailors on the ice remind the viewer of the fragility of humans who have tested themselves against the sublime power of nature.\n\nViewed in the context of climate change, Bradford’s paintings depicting the frozen polar regions from one hundred fifty years ago conjure up feelings of anxiety and reminiscence in a geoscientist.

Lynch Collection, 2022.58\n\nIn this watercolor study of a mother holding a baby, Cassatt demonstrates her ability to conjure a world with astonishing efficiency. A few lines define the contours of the figures, while a blue wash and touches of orange establish the major planes of color. Cassatt’s marks, though economical, create an atmosphere of deep intimacy and filial affection, fusing the mother and child into a cohesive unit. The blue of the child’s costume appears to merge with the bottom half of the mother’s dress, making it difficult to tell where one person’s clothing ends and the other’s begins.\n\nBaby in Dark Blue Suit, Looking Over His Mother’s Shoulder, 1889. Oil on canvas, Cincinnati Art Museum.\n\nThis study served as the basis for a larger oil painting (see image), now in the Cincinnati Art Museum. The final work is more tightly cropped around the upper half of the figures, accentuating the closeness of the embrace. Though it is more developed than the watercolor, the oil painting maintains the restricted palette and sparing touch of the smaller sketch. In both works, Cassatt integrates the mother and child through a patchwork of shared colors and interweaving lines, using formal relationships to convey personal bonds.\n\nMary Cassatt’s Mother and Child depicts an ordinary moment in domestic life: a mother holding a child who gazes out into space. The scene is reminiscent of a Madonna and child; even the blue color evokes Mary. But the figures here are not divine, but worldly. Traditionally the child Jesus may be shown seated and looking out toward the viewer of the painting, or gazing lovingly up to his mother’s face. Philosophical concepts can assist us in deepening our understanding of this work. In the present painting, this child’s gaze is directed neither at his mother nor to the viewer, but outward into space. The mother’s face is obscured so that we cannot see it; we have no sense of her individuality, only of her role as child bearer. This deliberate obscuration of the mother by her child, at the same time that she supports him, raises questions about recognition. Human identity is in part formed through mutual recognition, as the philosopher Paul Ricoeur has argued. Mature persons are both the subjects and objects of mutual recognition, as part of our fundamental ethical attitudes towards one another. Insofar as we fail to recognize another, it is an ethical failure. Here, Cassatt investigates the viewer’s recognition of the seated woman. Is her identity given by, or obscured by her maternity? To what extent is her sense of self apart from her maternal role “hidden”? How is motherhood both essential to her identity and a possible site of obscuration?\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nFrederic Edwin Church (1826–1900)\n\nNew England Landscape, 1849\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S.

Oil on canvas, Newark Museum of Art.\n\nThe twenty-three-year-old Frederic Edwin Church spent the summer of 1849 in New England, settling in the region of Cuttingsville, Vermont.1 This jewel-like study of a hilly field at sunset was likely made in the area. The painting’s diminutive size belies Church’s larger ambitions. Having recently become one of the youngest painters ever elected to New York’s National Academy of Design, he spent his time in Vermont producing small studies to incorporate into larger canvases that he would exhibit in New York the following year.2 Among the most important of these works were two paintings of sunsets over Vermont meadows: Ira Mountain, Vermont and Twilight, “Short Arbiter ’twixt Day and Night” (both shown here). Neither picture corresponds exactly to this study in its composition. What they share is Church’s attention to the spectacular effects of the sun’s passage over the horizon, when the sky sets itself ablaze and transforms terrestrial bodies into shadowy silhouettes.\n\n1. David Carew Huntington, “Frederic Edwin Church, 1826–1900: Painter of the Adamic New World Myth” (PhD diss., Yale University, 1969), 24.\n\n2. Franklin Kelly, Frederic Edwin Church (Washington, DC: National Gallery of Art, 1989), 43.\n\nThis small painting invites us into a sun-soaked world of sloping fields and a few trees. On the lower left, a farmer is driving a wagon along a fence line behind a group of sheep. At the spatial and thematic center, the sun illuminates the landscape from behind and the sky from below. Most likely focused on the task at hand, the farmer is nonetheless headed up toward and almost into the sun. The word “sun” appears over a hundred times in Thoreau’s Walden; or, Life in the Woods (1854), including in this passage from the “Economy” chapter that Church’s landscape brought to mind:\n\nTo anticipate, not the sunrise and the dawn merely, but, if possible, Nature herself! How many mornings, summer and winter, before yet any neighbor was stirring about his business, have I been about mine! No doubt, many of my townsmen have met me returning from this enterprise, farmers starting for Boston in the twilight, or woodchoppers going to their work. It is true, I never assisted the sun materially in his rising, but, doubt not, it was of the last importance only to be present at it.\n\nWhen Church painted this small landscape in August of 1849, he was only twenty-three years old, but he was already three years out from a two-year apprenticeship with the landscape painter, Thomas Cole (1801–48). With Cole, he had toured the Catskills of New York and the Berkshires of Massachusetts to sketch vistas for studio work; this scene evokes rural New England. It is at once very unlike Church’s famous mature paintings, yet nevertheless hints at his late work. First, it looks as if it were painted on scene, not worked up in the studio using sketches, as was Church’s norm. It has an immediacy and an intimacy absent from his famous grand landscapes. A naivete in Church’s brushwork here fits the modest, rural world of Yankee farmers. Yet, a blinding burst of sun threatens to immolate the scene, overwhelming the purple-gray hill in the distance, its late summer light held at bay only by small trees in the foreground. Church’s brushwork accentuates the sunburst with long, linear strokes that radiate from the focal point. The tiny figure riding away in his wagon, almost certainly a farmer given his white shirt and black vest and tall, wide-brimmed hat, seems both oblivious to and unaffected by the sublime, overwhelming sun-stroke and his wagon catching an unappreciated red lick of light on its side.\n\nBy the late 1840s, Church was falling under the influence of the German naturalist and philosopher, Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), who challenged artists to travel widely from home to give witness to the world’s glories. Within ten years, Church’s massive canvasses of majestic scenes would win him glory in America and Europe. Those later paintings cudgel viewers over the head with their monumental visions; this one invites them not to ignore the transcendent present amid the normalcy of nature, on a scale any of us could hang on our wall. Like the aptly named transcendentalists, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82) and Henry David Thoreau (1817–62), who were establishing their voices as writers in this decade, here Church wanted to illuminate the experience of awe in the nearness of the everyday in nature.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nSanford Robinson Gifford (1823–80)\n\nThe Ruins of the Parthenon, 1869–80\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S.

Oil on canvas, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.\n\nGifford specialized in landscape, first painting scenes of the Hudson River, the Adirondacks, and the mountains of Vermont. He traveled to Europe in 1855–57, when he met and traveled with Albert Bierstadt. Gifford served in the New York Militia during the Civil War from 1861–63 (see photo).\n\nIn 1868–69, Gifford made his second and last European visit, this time adding an excursion down the Nile and stops in Turkey and Greece. From sketches made at this time, he later created several important versions of The Ruins of the Parthenon, including a larger canvas in the National Gallery of Art (see image). His paintings are precise and filled with light, linking him to the luminists. The accurate detail of this painting suggests that he used photographic imagery as well as his sketches. The ruins of this still noble temple evoke comparisons of past and present. The ancient Greek civilization was widely seen as the birthplace of democracy; the enduring ruins were particularly poignant in the aftermath of the Civil War. It was one of his last works; Gifford died of malaria in 1880.\n\nIn the field of philosophy, “perspectivism” emphasizes the perspectival nature of all knowing. We perceive the world from particular points of view, and do not simply experience the world in its completeness. If I see one side of a mountain, its other side is obscured. Likewise, a mountain at a distance is experienced radically differently than one that I am hiking. The categories that we use in order to interpret the world are also perspectival. To define beauty as the harmonious captures one aspect of beauty, but not what Plato named as “Beauty itself.”\n\nFrederic Edwin Church (1926–1900), The Parthenon, 1871. Oil on canvas, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nSanford Robinson Gifford’s The Ruins of the Parthenon is deeply engaged with perspective. Many see this 1880 painting as a response to an 1871 one by Gifford’s friend, Frederic Edwin Church (see image). Both treat the subject of the Parthenon. Church takes a perspective from below the building, looking up at its decaying majesty central to the space of the painting. It is illuminated by sun and warm colors. Church’s ruins hark back to a nostalgia for the Athenian Empire under Pericles. Gifford, in contrast, places the Parthenon to the left of his painting, where it forms only one part of the larger landscape. In the distance, we see a mountain range, and in the immediate foreground, the tiny figure of a person near fallen stonework. The partially deteriorating Parthenon exists somewhere between the brevity of human life and the enduring mountains. Gifford’s work resituates our vision so that we can more clearly see human accomplishments as “in between.” In regarding this work in dialogue with Church’s, we are also invited to grow in our self-understanding as perspective takers and makers.\n\nAcropolis. Athens May 5th ‘69 (from the 1869 sketchbook). Graphite and chalk, private collection.\n\nRoom 18 in the British Museum, where the Parthenon Marbles have been displayed since the 1960s.\n\nGifford made several paintings, of which this is one, based on a sketch created during his visit to the Acropolis in Athens in May 1869 (see image). The artist professed they were “not…picture[s] of a building but…picture[s] of a day.”1 Regardless of his intent, the east portion of the Parthenon appears here as a relatively accurate representation of the Greek temple after it was stripped of about half of its original fifth century BCE sculpted frieze, metopes, and pediments by the Earl of Elgin and his agents between 1801 and 1812. Shipped shortly thereafter by Elgin to London, those sculptures by 1832 had become highlights of the British Museum’s collection (see image). Elgin claimed to have removed the marbles with the permission of the Ottoman Sultanate which exercised authority over Athens at the time and to which he was then British ambassador. Discussions between British and Greek officials continue to this day about whether the Parthenon Marbles were looted and should be returned to Athens, because of their cultural importance to Greece, where they could be appreciated by the public in proximity to the other Parthenon sculptures in the Acropolis Museum opened in 2009.\n\n1. His monumental, and presumed to be his final, painting of the scene now in the National Gallery in Washington, bears the date 1880. The present work could have been completed any time after the 1869 sketch, to which it is very close in detail, and Gifford’s death in 1880.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nWilliam Stanley Haseltine (1835–1900)\n\nRocks at Narragansett, 1863\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S.

Bottom: Indian Rock, or Hazard Rock, Hazard Avenue, Narragansett, Rhode Island, August 3, 2022. Photograph: Jeffery Howe.\n\nHaseltine spent the summers of 1862 and 1863 in Narragansett, Rhode Island, painting the rocky coast. Rocks at Narragansett depicts the site known as Indian Rock or Hazard Rock. Although the name Hazard Rock derives from the prominent Hazard family, it is known to fishermen as one the most dangerous places to fish in the United States. The exact location is confirmed by a related drawing that includes two fishermen (see image). The apparent flat expanse of rock is in fact the top of an underwater cavern, and the crashing waves create treacherous currents. The name Indian Rock also evokes Native legends and loss; as early as 1767 Narragansett tribal members lamented that all the land by the sea had been taken by the white colonists. The spectacular site was used for outdoor Episcopalian church services in the 1850s. In 1880 Rhode Island lawmakers declared the Narragansett extinct, seeking to erase them from the land.\n\nKnown for his precision and geologic accuracy, the artist captures a single moment and depicts the exact light of the sun hitting the rocks and reflecting off the water at that instant. Unlike his impressionist contemporaries, his work is clearly defined with a sharp realism. The eternal flux of the ocean is in tension with the seeming stasis of the rock, which nonetheless erodes with the waves. Art and science were seen as complementary by John Ruskin and many artists. Haseltine asserted that “every real artist is also a scientist, and scientists were also artists in the truest sense of the word.” Art historian Rebecca Bedell suggests that Haseltine may have been influenced by the popular public lectures on geological history given at Harvard by the now controversial scientist Louis Agassiz.\n\nHaseltine’s paintings are typical of the Hudson River school. As with most of the artists to whom this designation is applied, Haseltine established his reputation as a landscape painter. His paintings often drew from sketches of popular seaside resorts. Yet his most celebrated works were those portraying the rocky coast of New England. These “rock portraits” were geologically so precise that certain critics declared that they served both science and art. The southern coast of Rhode Island was among his favorite subjects, as in this depiction of rocks at a shore area around Narragansett. As with most of the works by artists of the Hudson River school, those of Haseltine display a close relationship with the natural elements and with the light and the configurations that bind them together. In Rocks at Narragansett it is the protrusion of the stones, appearing as though they emerged from the sea, that constitutes the primary subject. The pool splashing onto the rocks reflects the pale blue of the sky. These elements of nature—stones, water, sky—are thus bound together. The only sign of human presence in this natural setting are the sailboats far out at sea.\n\nHaseltine’s Rocks at Narragansett depicts a classic rocky New England coastline, reminiscent of scenes from this spot in Rhode Island to the famous shores of Acadia National Park in Maine. The particular rock of these cliffs is granite, the product of molten magma coalescing and crystallizing slowly, deep within the Earth’s crust about 275 million years ago. This was the time of Pangea—the great supercontinent that unified all land onto a single mass, with modern day New England sandwiched in the middle. Granite’s well-formed interlocking crystals of quartz, feldspar, and a few other minerals give granite its strength. The feldspar takes on a brownish or even pinkish hue that gives it its color. And its slow cooling history gives it the distinctive rectangular blockiness formed by uniformly oriented contractional “joints” or “sheets” in the rocks. Upon closer inspection, sometimes those cracks served as conduits for hot fluids deep in the crust that can precipitate other minerals on those surfaces, like pistachio-green coatings of epidote. Now as the cooler water of the waves sweep across these rocky shores and into those cracks, the ocean itself can precipitate crystals of salt reflecting the modern surface ocean. Meanwhile, at the bottom of the rocks, we see indications of marine life (seaweed) establishing a foothold on the rock itself, sure to last as long as sea level maintains its current place. Finally, in the distance, we see the faint outlines of sailboats, evidence of another remarkable lifeform that has left its own mark on our remarkable planet. Artists like Haseltine have the opportunity to capture the stories of fire and water and life juxtaposed in these rocks and waves.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nFrederick Childe Hassam (1859–1935)\n\nWater Hazard—Maidstone Links, 1923\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S. Lynch Collection, 2022.51\n\nTop: The Dome Green (Maidstone), 1923. Oil on panel, private collection. Bottom: East Course, Maidstone Club, 1926. Oil on board, private collection.\n\nWhen Hassam made this painting, golf courses and country clubs were relatively new features of American life, constructed with Gilded Age fortunes and shaped by a nostalgia for the landscapes of British manor estates.1 Hassam himself was an avid golfer and member of the Maidstone Club on Long Island, which he used as the setting for multiple paintings (see images). Several of these works depict women golfers, whose presence in American country clubs attracted extensive social commentary at the time. Many writers argued that country clubs provided an unprecedented degree of female autonomy.2 “It has brought our women out of stuffy houses and out of their own hopeless, aimless selves,” Munsey’s Magazine declared in 1902.3 Women’s roles in country clubs, however, remained circumscribed; when golfing, they were frequently relegated to secondary courses or allowed to play the regular eighteen holes only after proving their skill, as was the rule at Maidstone.4\n\nHassam’s depiction of women golfers may have been driven less by an interest in changing gender norms than by his fascination with the female form in the landscape, which he regarded as an ancient subject. The statue-like rigidity of Hassam’s golfers and their arrangement in the flattened configuration of a frieze reflect Hassam’s efforts in the 1920s and 1930s to evoke the archaic forms of the Classical world.5 His attachment to ancient culture was intertwined with what Barbara Weinberg has described as his growing “xenophobia and nativism,” according to which modernism was the corrupt product of “foreign” influence.6 By this late phase in his career, Hassam denied his obvious debt to French impressionism, and he was fond of quoting the critic Royal Cortissoz’s denigration of modernist painting as “Ellis Island art.”7 The Maidstone Club, like many country clubs at the time, provided a hospitable environment for these views, codifying them in its membership policies (Jews were first admitted to Maidstone in 1976, and the club reportedly had no Black members into the twenty-first century8).\n\n1.

Style, 10; Peter de Jonge, “Barbarian at the Tee: An Uninvited Non-Member Plays a Round at the Maidstone Club,” New York Magazine, Aug. 18, 2005.\n\nTwo women with their young caddies are enjoying a round of golf on a beautiful summer’s day. One woman has just hit her tee shot and looks at the result of her endeavor. The other patiently waits her turn, club in hand. Hassam captures the natural beauty of eastern Long Island, New York, with a small pond guarded by a thick growth of reeds in the foreground and an expanse of grass and sand in the background. The women are dressed in the bright colors and styles of the 1920s, as are the caddies. The timeless beauty of this golf course is enjoyed today in much the same way as it was a hundred years ago.\n\nWith its explosion of color and visible separate brushstrokes, Water Hazard—Maidstone Links shows the strong influence on Hassam by the impressionists. Philosophical ideas about the relationship between sensation and concept formation illuminate the name “impressionism” as did Monet’s advice to students to paint what they see, not so much objects but patches of color, which we see enacted in Hassam’s work. Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) argued that we take in raw sensation, for example, patches of color rather than fully formed objects, and only come to “see” things as distinct and three-dimensional objects by processing them, placing them in space (and time) and organizing them under concepts using reason. Moreover, Kant thought that the experience of pleasure in beauty is in the “play” of imagination and reason, using reason but not to organize impressions into fully formed defined objects, but rather to reflect back on the subject who sees and experiences. Hassam presents impressions of the scene on the links before they are turned into full-fledged objects, giving access to the naive sensations before they are processed. The grassy foreground is composed of disaggregated spots of color, while in the distance the color is blended into larger patches. According to Kant reason tells us that the grass we see in the distance is like the grass we see up close, that it is not really a single carpet of green but composed of multiple colors, but what we actually see, the sense impressions, in the distance is different from what we see up close, and this difference is what Hassam depicts. It is a new way of seeing that is both more “realist”—what we “really” see—and more “subjective”—about what is going on in the viewer’s mind, that brings us the pleasure in sensation itself, which is normally lost in the structuring and rationalization of experience.\n\nHassam paints a very ordinary scene from his present, not from history or allegory. Although playing golf requires wealth and privilege, he depicts the people here as ordinary, wearing basic golfing attire. It is a “modern” scene, where the women are playing the sport, attended by male caddies. Kant thought that we have to place the onslaught of sensation into three-dimensional space as well as into the sequence of time. This painting is of an unremarkable moment in time abstracted from any sequence without any evocation of a larger narrative. Nature rather than people was the most common impressionist subject, but here Hassam blends the people into the landscape. The landscape is not there to show them but vice versa. Hassam seems to have chosen to depict the people as “wooden” in an attempt to access sensation freed from concepts and three-dimensionality. In ordinary experience, visual data is subsumed under concepts—man, woman, male, female—and the visual details fade into that whole. We only see one side of an object and reason supplies the sides and the back, their three-dimensionality. Hassam brings us back to the experience of the human figures as bright and vibrant patches and dabs of color, flat rather than rounded. He focuses on the surface and patterns on their clothing, rather than on their depth. The depiction of the players is detached and also takes steps toward abstraction as they are rendered as shapes and patterns, and as elongated and still. The movement in the painting comes from the beautiful grasses on the shore on the bottom right that bend in the breeze.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nFrederick Childe Hassam (1859–1935)\n\nSpring Flowering Trees, c. 1900\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S. Lynch Collection, 2022.52\n\nApple Trees in Bloom, Old Lyme, 1904. Oil on panel, private collection.\n\nTrained in Boston, first as a wood engraver and then as a watercolor painter, by 1883 Hassam established himself in a studio on Tremont Street as a painter of city views and landscapes in the thickly painted style of the French Barbizons. Popular with American collectors, Barbizon artists like Jules Dupré (1811–99), focused on rural scenes (see his painting Landscape with Woman in Red displayed on this floor). From 1886 to 1889, while living in Paris and studying at the Académie Julian, Hassam began to blend impressionist brushstrokes with more solid figures. In 1889 he relocated his studio to New York, but to escape urban life traveled during the spring and summer months to various New England coastal towns, where he often indulged his lifelong attraction to painting the transient beauty of the natural world.\n\nBlossoming trees were a recurrent motif throughout his career, affording Hassam the opportunity to capture with impressionist brushstrokes flickering light on the flowers. In the present work, as in Apple Trees in Bloom depicting the foliage in front of his studio in Old Lyme, Connecticut (see image), he places an older, sprawling tree behind a more vital younger one, a juxtaposition interpreted by scholars as conveying the nostalgia for the past and optimism for the future prevalent among Americans at the beginning of the twentieth century.1\n\n1. Susan Larkin, “Hassam in New England,” in Childe Hassam, American Impressionist, ed. H. Barbara Weinberg (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2004), 157.\n\nThis painting is a luscious, cotton-candy depiction of flowering spring trees. It might be too “pretty” except that Hassam’s composition feels like a spontaneous and momentary glance, not “composed” in a classical sense. The large tree in the background is cut off at the side and top. It almost looks like it grows out of the tree in the foreground, and the composition is overbalanced on the left. Invoking the German philosopher Immanuel Kant’s (1724–1804) ideas that the placement of sensations into three-dimensional space and the distinction of objects from one another are the work of reason and not given in sensation or imagination, Hassam makes us observe the way our mind “corrects” the painting, realizing two distinct trees, one behind the other by some distance. Everything but the blossoms is dark and indistinct. If Hassam’s Water Hazard—Maidstone Links emphasizes an objective “just-the-sensations” where people are patches of color in the landscape, Spring Flowering Trees emphasizes the subjective experience of seeing the blooming tree. The tree takes over the painting so that we experience the joyful shock of the trees dressed in their temporary spring flowers. The painting displays the fleeting moment of full spring in ways we do not ever actually “see” it but captures how we “see” it subjectively. So while in the Maidstone Links painting nearby, objects are patches of color, disintegrated into what we “objectively see,” here the focus is blurred and the colors blended, presenting the trees in a single subjective flash of beauty and joy. Hassam captures the pleasure of seeing for and in the subject, Kant would say, conveying the essence of the experience such that we can almost smell the flowers.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nMartin Johnson Heade (1819–1904)\n\nOrchid and Hummingbirds near a Mountain Lake, c. 1875–90\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S. Lynch Collection, 2022.54\n\nInspired by Heade’s travels in Brazil during the 1860s, this painting was equally shaped by the art market that he encountered upon returning to the United States. In a competitive field of American landscape painting that was dominated by better-known contemporaries such as Frederic Edwin Church (1826–1900), Heade needed to find ways to stand out.1 Idiosyncratic views of foreign flora and fauna provided him with a commercially viable path. Heade’s tropical subject matter differentiated him from competitors, but what truly distinguished him was a compositional innovation: juxtaposing detailed studies of orchids and hummingbirds with distant vistas, he created a radical separation between foreground and background. The combination of micro and macro scales allowed Heade to incorporate the conventions of natural history illustration and landscape painting into something that transcended both traditions, turning birds and plants into dramatic actors on an exotic stage.\n\nHummingbirds and Orchids, c. 1875–90. Oil on canvas, Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\nThough set in nature, these scenes were carefully constructed products of the studio. The orchid in this painting, for example, was transposed from Heade’s stock repertoire of plant studies, which he repeatedly inserted into compositions either by tracing or through another means of mechanical transfer.2 Heade’s Hummingbirds and Orchids in the Detroit Institute of Arts (see image) contains a blossom that matches this one in almost every detail. In fact, the same orchid is present in at least twenty-one of Heade’s paintings—a number that testifies to the commercial success of these works (which may explain the artist’s need for expedient production methods).3\n\n1. For Heade’s efforts to establish a market for himself while in the shadow of Church, see Maggie M. Cao, “Heade’s Hummingbirds and the Ungrounding of Landscape,” American Art 25, no. 3 (2011): 48–75.\n\n2. Karen E. Quinn, “Passion Flowers,” in Martin Johnson Heade, ed. Theodore E.

Quinn, “Passion Flowers,” 113.\n\nThis painting is one in a series of hummingbird and orchid paintings that Heade produced between about 1875 and 1890. Painted more than a decade after his trip to Brazil in 1863, Heade pairs the flowers and birds in an imagined tableau synthesized from earlier sketches (see image), memory, and perhaps external sources. In these fanciful paintings, Heade is free to depict his subjects in a variety of lively poses and to fill the scenes with luminous and saturated color.\n\nTop: From Heade’s Brazilian Sketchbook and Journal, 1865. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nBottom: Passion Flowers and Hummingbirds, c. 1870–90. Oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nThe orchid is a ruby-lipped Cattleya. Cattleya is a genus of tropical South American orchids that are epiphytic (growing on other plants). They are not parasites, however, deriving their nutrients from the air, rain, and dust that fall on them. Like the hummingbirds, the orchids “travel” by flight, their microscopic seeds floating from tree to tree. This orchid variety is known for its large, showy flowers. Christopher Clark, associate professor of evolution, ecology, and organismal biology at University of California Riverside, identifies the top bird as possibly a black-throated mango and the bottom as a black-eared fairy. Heade probably mistakenly thought the two were from the same species. Clark also notes that while Heade paints the birds with six tail feathers on either side, all hummingbirds actually have two sets of five.\n\nHeade painted many dozens of similar scenes, most often with varieties of Cattleya orchids, but also several featuring passion flowers (see photo). In these scenes he portrays tropical jungles emerging from gray mist which all but obscures the mountains. These atmospheric effects emphasize the depth of view, setting off the vibrancy of the birds and flowers.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nMartin Johnson Heade (1819–1904)\n\nTwo Green-Breasted Hummingbirds, c. 1863–64\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S.

Hand-colored lithograph.\n\nThis painting is the only confirmed surviving study from The Gems of Brazil series, a group of twenty compositions that Heade planned to publish in a volume devoted to hummingbirds.1 Heade developed the concept for the project in 1863 during his trip to Brazil, where he secured at least sixty subscribers for the publication and received the endorsement of Emperor Dom Pedro II.2 But when Heade left Brazil for London the next year, he struggled to find additional funding for the work. London presented increased competition: John Gould’s Monograph of the Trochilidae, or Family of Hummingbirds had just been completed in 1861, and it contained ample illustrations of the same subjects (see image). The growing British expectation of verisimilitude in natural history illustration also may have clashed with Heade’s fanciful style. Seeking to imply narratives of domestic unity through his avian models, he tended to present pairs of hummingbirds cohabitating near nests with eggs, but he conceded that he had never observed such a moment in real life.3\n\nPerhaps the greatest obstacle that Heade faced was technical. Working with British publishers, he attempted to reproduce his paintings with chromolithography, but the process was costly and did not capture the subtlety of his original colors. A test print of this painting reveals some of the difficulties (see image in entry below). While the colors are vibrant, they notably diverge from those in the original painting, and they show signs of having been retouched by hand, which would have represented an additional expense. Dispirited by these setbacks and out of money, Heade soon gave up his ambition to create his “large and elegant album.”4\n\n1. Theodore E.

Hanbart.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, artists and naturalists alike turned their attention to the tropics. Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (1859) was written largely from observations in the Galápagos Islands. South America and the Pacific Islands were seen as laboratories in which evolution would be either proven or debunked. At the time, the practice of natural history focused on the discovery and cataloguing of animal and plant species. Popular illustrated works catalogued flora and fauna by type and region, modeled on Audubon’s successful Birds of America (1827–38).\n\nIn this context, Martin Johnson Heade undertook a voyage to Brazil in 1863 with the intent of depicting every South American hummingbird in a book of lithographs to be called The Gems of Brazil. Heade spent almost a year and a half in Rio de Janeiro collecting and painting specimens, sending many of his designs to the London lithography studio M. & N. Hanbart. Heade was disappointed, however, with the quality of Hanbart’s reproductions, particularly the dullness of their color. As a result, the printers produced only four finished lithographs before Heade abandoned the project (see image).\n\nTwo Green-Breasted Hummingbirds is one of about two dozen paintings Heade made while in Brazil preparing The Gems of Brazil. These works show the birds either perched in profile or facing forward with wings extended; Heade was not concerned with capturing motion so much as clearly depicting the distinguishing features of the species. The jungle and mountain setting is likely a fabrication, though perhaps based on Heade’s travels to the Serra de Tijuca mountain range.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nWinslow Homer (1836–1910)\n\nGrace Hoops, 1872\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S.

Oil on canvas, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nThis charming image of two girls playing a game in the late afternoon or early evening is one of Homer’s most engaging depictions of youth on the cusp of adulthood, including paintings of games of croquet played on the lawn of his father’s house in Belmont, Massachusetts, in the 1860s. Homer followed then-contemporary ideas of gender; these girls are graceful and genteel, unlike the rough-and-tumble boys playing Snap the Whip (1872).\n\nThe jeu des graces was a game invented in Europe in the early nineteenth century. Players try to pass and catch a circular hoop with two sticks, making graceful poses. Play is often a rehearsal for adulthood, and the striving for the ring may signify the desire for marriage or success in life. The hoop is suspended high in the air, with the girl on the right poised to catch it. The passage of time is embodied in this frozen instant, and temporality is also implied by the shadowed time of day, the age of the young women, and the flowers (including bachelor buttons) that surround them in the garden. Like Chardin’s Soap Bubbles (see photo), it is one of many images of the fleeting nature of childhood, a traditional vanitas theme.\n\nA wooden ring hangs in the air, paused in its flight between two young women. They are engaged in the “game of graces,” a popular form of nineteenth-century recreation in which players tossed and caught a hoop using a pair of handheld rods. The game, which had arrived in the United States from France, was said to encourage girls to move gracefully.1 The title of this painting clearly refers to the game, but it may also have been an allusion to the name of the woman in black. She is thought to be Grace Barrett Valentine, who owned Homer’s preliminary sketch for this work (see image), and her brother-in-law, Lawson Valentine, may have purchased the final painting.2\n\nGrace Hoops, 1872. Oil on canvas, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh.\n\nEncouraged by affluent patrons such as the Valentines (owners of a major varnish and paint factory in Boston), Homer increasingly painted such scenes of childhood leisure in the 1870s, turning away from the national strife that had been a recurring theme of his work as an artist-reporter during the American Civil War. Even when representing seemingly anodyne subjects, however, Homer maintained the precision and temporal specificity that had established the credibility of his journalistic work. In a period when lengthy photographic exposure times precluded split-second snapshots, Homer’s paintings conveyed a feeling of arrested animation that no camera could achieve. The hard-edged instantaneity of this composition saves it from mere mawkish sentimentality. Homer clearly delights in the fact that the airborne ring suggests a halo above the figures, but he is equally attentive to the physics of the object, refusing to transform it entirely into a saccharine symbol of angelic femininity.\n\n1.

Oil on canvas, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nA major figure in the Hudson River school, Inness was one of many artists and writers influenced by the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, the eighteenth-century Swedish mystic. A fundamental principle of Swedenborgianism is that everything in nature corresponds to a spiritual reality. Romantic artists easily extended this mirroring principle to use nature as a vehicle for emotion and symbolic content. Whether realistic or abstract, the artist’s marks on canvas can convey ideas or feelings. The fresh naturalism and broad brushstrokes of this dark and moody landscape also reveal the influence of the French Barbizon school. Seeking simplicity and unity of effect, Inness rejected “elaborateness in detail” as it “did not gain me meaning.” Like James McNeill Whistler, Inness painted from memory to help simplify his forms.\n\nThis quiet and intimate landscape reflects Inness’s meditative vision of American nature, particularly significant as a restorative in the aftermath of the Civil War. A seated hunter, perhaps a veteran, cradles a gun on his lap in a shadowy glade as he rests at the end of the day. The subtlety of this work contrasts with the more explicit call for peace in Winslow Homer’s Veteran in a New Field of 1865 (see photo). Although he was unable to enlist due to poor health, Inness paid soldiers who joined the Union cause in his stead.\n\nAn otherworldly light suffuses a clearing in a dense wood, where a hunter rests on a log. Without any sky visible in the scene, it is difficult to determine the time of day. The black void on the other side of the stream suggests the darkness of night, yet the trees and grass glow with an eerie vibrancy.\n\nNear the Delaware Water Gap, c. 1866. Oil on canvas, private collection.\n\nSuch supernatural effects became increasingly important to Inness’s work in the mid-1860s, when he worked within a small community of artists and writers in Eagleswood, New Jersey. Influenced by the painter William Page (1811–85), Inness began to explore Swedenborgian theology, according to which the visible world constituted a veil over the spiritual realm.1 Building on these ideas, Inness sought to move beyond the empirical study of nature, attempting instead to reveal a divine essence that lay outside of ordinary sensory perception.\n\nThe cultivated strangeness of this scene becomes especially apparent when we compare it with a smaller preparatory study that Inness produced for it (see image).2 While the study presents a naturalistic representation of a shady wood, the final painting establishes a tension between light and dark that charges the landscape with a paranormal atmosphere.\n\n1.

Lynch Collection, 2021.21\n\nTop: Mingo Beach, Beverly, Massachusetts, March 11, 2022, at low tide. Photograph: Jeffery Howe.\n\nBottom: Bash-Bish Falls, Massachusetts, 1855. Oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nJohn Frederick Kensett was a leading luminist artist, influenced by nineteenth-century Transcendentalism. His precise and accurate style was shaped by his early training as an engraver. This almost abstract vision of the rocky shore of Beverly, Massachusetts, depicts the Atlantic Ocean and horizon cloaked in a luminous mist. This evanescent realm of light and color is balanced by the harsh clarity of a rocky promontory with low trees at right. The stilled sea and split rocks have an elegiac undertone of calm after a storm, perhaps a metaphor for the end of the Civil War and desire for peace. The golden light of the distant sea also suggests a hope for freedom, transcending the burdens of earthly life.\n\nBeverly was a popular summer resort at this time, called by some the “Riviera of Massachusetts.” Kensett often sketched at the nearby summer estate of Charles Greeley Loring, later trustee and director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and completed more than twenty paintings of the area. Loring’s estate (now demolished, near the site of Endicott College) faced a trio of beaches, one of which has an intriguing history. According to local historians, Mingo Beach (see photo) was named for Robin Mingo, an African American or Native American enslaved person owned by Thomas Woodberry. Legend has it that Mingo was promised his freedom if a rare low tide ever made it possible to walk to a distant off-shore rock, an event that unfortunately only occurred in the year he died (1748).\n\nA further association of this locale with themes of freedom is found in the tradition that this beach was used as an escape route for those accused of witchcraft in nearby Salem; a local path is still called Witches Lane. Kensett chose scenes that were not only visually and geologically interesting, but had historic resonance. He painted Bash-Bish Falls in the Berkshires several times; the Falls were named for a Native American woman named Bash-Bish who had been condemned to death at that site (see image).\n\nEarly in his career Kensett traveled extensively in Europe, moving between London and Paris and settling for a period in Italy. When finally he decided to return to the United States, he expressed his desire in these words: he wanted “to get amid the scenery” of his own country, for, as he said, “it abounds with the picturesque, the grand, and the beautiful.” Upon his return, he set about painting scenes of the marshlands of coastal New England, as well as landscapes along the Hudson River, at Niagara Falls, in the Catskills and the Adirondacks. He established his reputation as the master of American luminism, a style that emphasizes smooth, seamless surfaces of light. Kensett alludes to a kind of luminism in a journal entry that reads: “the simplicity of strength and knowledge.” This expressionism is exemplified in a work such as On the Beverly Coast. In this painting much of the surface depicts water and sky; the work displays such simplicity that only the slightest shading betrays the division between sea and sky. A sense of strength is conveyed by the rocks, which are securely anchored. One can readily imagine that arboreal figure that backs them is a tree of knowledge, toward which the two human figures at the extreme right appear to be walking across a stony ledge, its color mirroring that of the large stone in the foreground of the painting.\n\nLynch Collection Index\n\nPermanent Collection Index\n\nFitz Henry Lane (1804–65)\n\nView of Gloucester Harbor, 1858\n\nOil on canvas\n\nMcMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, Carolyn A. and Peter S. Lynch Collection, 2021.20\n\nTop: Fitz Henry Lane house, Gloucester, Massachusetts, 1848–49. Bottom: Gloucester Harbor from Rocky Neck, March 25, 2022. Photographs: Jeffery Howe.\n\nAlthough a leading luminist painter, the artist’s name has been confused by historians. Born Nathaniel Rogers Lane in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1804, he legally changed his name to Fitz Henry Lane in 1831. In the twentieth century he was mistakenly identified as Fitz Hugh Lane, although recent discoveries have corrected this. In 1832 he moved to Boston, where he was influenced by the work of Robert Salmon and practiced the relatively new art of lithography. In 1848 he moved back to Gloucester to a house he designed with a top floor studio for panoramic views of the harbor (see photo). Lane was paralyzed as a child, probably by infantile polio, and was obliged to use crutches. Nonetheless, he became one of the most skilled maritime artists of his time. His style was very precise and detailed, leading to speculation that he may have used a camera lucida, an optical device for projecting images.\n\nView of Gloucester Harbor shows the outlook from a small promontory on Rocky Neck, with the distinctive Black Rock Spindle navigational aid in the foreground. Rocky Neck became the site of a vibrant artists’ colony that persists to this day. A variety of large vessels and smaller craft attest to the success of the fishing port. The soft glow of the sky veils the cityscape in the distance, and is reflected on the still surface of the harbor. The silhouette of the Spindle and the clearly defined ships in the middleground create visual interest against the backdrop of a thriving coastal community.\n\nFitz Henry Lane depicts sunset glow on the sails and water of busy Gloucester Harbor, north of Boston, before the Civil War. This painting captures not just the end of a day, but of an era. Eighteen-fifty-eight was one year before entrepreneurs began pumping petroleum from beneath northwest Pennsylvania, in a commercial and scientific development of world significance. Coal-powered steam engines had already begun to remake transportation. Within decades, commercial sailing vessels would all but vanish: by World War I, most working boats ran on coal or oil. Gone, too, the wooden cage-like structure in the foreground, a post lantern, one of many marking rocky outcrops and channel openings in harbors such as Gloucester. Fueled by whale oil and later kerosene, post lanterns became obsolete in an era of electrical illumination. This image of calm waters portrays a world about to be upended not only by the cataclysm of wa"
