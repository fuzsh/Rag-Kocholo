        "text": "LIVINGSTON MANOR, N.Y. — On Oct. 22, a stretch of Main Street in this hamlet in New York’s Sullivan County will join the list of often unexpected and rural places to see art installations by James Turrell.\n\nThe Catskill Art Space, a local arts nonprofit that is celebrating its half-centennial with a rebranding as a new art destination, will include not just a Turrell work, “Avaar,” but also two Sol LeWitt wall drawings. The three artworks are semi-permanent loans that will be on long-term view alongside rotating shows of works by artists with connections to the region.\n\n“Work by artists of this caliber is certainly a stretch for an organization of our size,” said Sally Wright, the executive director of the organization, which was known for 50 years, until last month, as the Catskill Art Society. It’s also a stretch for a town with a full-time population of under 1,000. Wright, 35, has headed the nonprofit since 2017.\n\n“Avaar,” a loan from the Seattle Art Museum, is among the pieces Turrell has called his “Space Division” or “Aperture” works. (There is some debate as to when Turrell conceived “Avaar,” but the Whitney Museum of American Art included it in his solo show that opened in 1980.) The colossal space is separated into a zone where visitors position themselves and look toward a second zone from which the light emits. Unlike some of the artist’s best-known works, which wow with saturations and transformations of color, “Avaar” is achromatic — using only white light.\n\nAs visitors enter a seemingly pitch-black space, the eyes need several minutes to adjust before the aperture becomes apparent, looming first like a flat field, then seeming to open into a never-ending abyss of pure light. The artist has compared such works to how, shortly after you turn off a porch light, your vision can penetrate the night — an experience Wright quickly points out is common in the countryside. She said those who have seen the work find it “meditative and also really reflective of the Catskills environment,” adding that Turrell has often cited the Hudson River School painters as an influence.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
