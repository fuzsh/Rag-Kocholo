        "text": "ART\n\n‘REVOLUTION’ Not long ago hardly any galleries in Chelsea were showing Asian contemporary art. Now there are dozens, including those specializing in Asian artists. Chinese art dominates, partly because the current market is boiling and partly because, simply, some of the best art being made today is from China.\n\nFor evidence you might visit ChinaSquare, a new gallery dedicated to Chinese art and located high in the Chelsea Arts Tower. Inside the gallery is a spirited group show put together by Fang Lei and Jonathan Goodman, featuring the work of a dozen contemporary Chinese artists, among them emerging talents like Cao Xiaodong, Shen Jingdong and Jing Kewen, as well as the veterans Zhang Hongtu and Li Luming. “Revolution” is the overarching theme, with the central idea being to spotlight the influence of propaganda imagery from the Cultural Revolution (about 1966-76) in the work of contemporary artists. It’s imagery that was made to serve political ends and promote revolutionary spirit among the Chinese people.\n\nThe show, not surprisingly, contains lots of tongue-in-cheek riffs on devotional portraits of Mao, along with images of cheery peasants in the countryside or model workers, like Mr. Shen’s glossy, idealized oil paintings of Chinese military personnel, above. Other artworks point to another sort of revolution: China’s current obsession with materialism. With luck this revolution won’t be as corrosive as the last. (Through Jan. 12, ChinaSquare, Chelsea Arts Tower, 545 West 25th Street, eighth floor, 212-255-8886, chinasquareny.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO\n\nMuseums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted.

Skills and motifs used in sacred art resurface in a surprisingly secular place: the carousel. In this exhibition, models of elaborate wooden synagogues and photographs of Jewish cemeteries with intricately carved gravestones in Eastern Europe are alongside paper cuts, which look like giant, precision-cut snowflakes mounted on colored paper. The lineage from synagogue to carousel is made explicit in a display that juxtaposes carved Torah arks with carousel horses fashioned in the baroque Coney Island Style. The show reveals a vibrant Jewish visual culture, where Judaism is often seen as text-oriented. It is also a great immigrant story in which skills learned in the shtetls of Europe made their way to the New World and, for a brief moment, flourished. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)\n\n★ ASIA SOCIETY: ‘THE ARTS OF KASHMIR,’, through Jan. 6. Set in the Himalayas amid Afghanistan, China and India, Kashmir underwent constant cultural fermentation, taking influences in, sending them out. Sacred to Hinduism, home to early Buddhism and a favored retreat of Muslim rulers, it was forever either struggling to sustain social balance or heading into conflict. This perpetual play of opposites produced, through molding and friction, some of the most beautiful art in the world. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org.\n\n(Holland Cotter)\n\nASIA SOCIETY: ‘ZHANG HUAN: ALTERED STATES,’ through Jan. 20. The Chinese artist Zhang Huan, the subject of this small, midcareer survey, is best known for the early, often poetic, sometimes sensationally masochistic performance work he did in the 1990s, which can only be seen in videos and photographs now. The objects in this show, which include giant fragments of Buddhist sculptures made from copper sheets and incense ash, are products of his new workshop-style studio in Shanghai. (See above.) (Cotter)\n\nBRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: ‘THE WORLD OUTSIDE: A SURVEY EXHIBITION 1991-2007,’ through Jan. 27. A product of the Cuban avant-garde of the late ’80s and now a resident of Santo Domingo, Quisqueya Henríquez has exhibited extensively in solo and group shows in North and South America. In her clever, ideologically pointed sculptures, installations, collages and videos, she aims to deconstruct prejudicial stereotypes about the arts and cultures of Latin America. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)\n\n★ BROOKLYN MUSEUM: ‘INFINITE ISLAND: CONTEMPORARY CARIBBEAN ART,’ through Jan. 27. This large show, with 45 artists and a collective of designers, photographers and architects from the Dominican Republic adding to the count, fills two floors of temporary exhibition space, and care has been given to the selection. Several of the most substantial pieces were commissioned for the occasion. Organized by Tumelo Moshaka, associate curator of exhibitions at Brooklyn, it’s an in-house job, a labor of love, though an uneven one. Too much work treads ground already covered by other art over the years. But what’s good is really good, and the very existence of a show about identity politics, out of mainstream fashion in 2007, is cause for serious reflection. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n\n★ FRICK COLLECTION: GABRIEL DE SAINT-AUBIN, through Jan. 27. One of 18th-century France’s greatest draftsmen, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin drew all the time and everywhere he went. He usually worked small, and in many cases you need one of the magnifying glasses provided at the museum to fully appreciate the subtlety and detail. Nevertheless, he had tremendous range. Whether conjuring epic visions of Ancient Roman history or recording intimate views of domestic quietude, he produced works of nonstop graphic liveliness, extraordinary sensuousness and hypersensitive alertness to perceptual reality. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)\n\nGUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: ‘FOTO: MODERNITY IN CENTRAL EUROPE, 1918-1945,’ through Jan. 13. This exhibition is the art historical equivalent of the ultimate real estate dream: You open an unfamiliar door in your apartment and  voilà  there’s an extra room you never knew about. In this case the room is full of the work of scores of mostly unfamiliar photographers who put the medium through its paces in interwar Central Europe. Learning about them gives modern photography  up to and including the experiments of the early 1980s  a whole new layout. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\n★ GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: ‘RICHARD PRINCE: SPIRITUAL AMERICA,’ through Jan. 9. This retrospective of one of contemporary art’s inveterate bad boys looks more beautiful in the museum’s rotunda than it probably should. Covering nearly 30 years, it includes photographs of photographs; joke paintings; car hoods; and parodies of de Kooning’s “Women” paintings that have undergone a sex change. It shows a body of work in which the supposed end-game of appropriation has fueled a constantly changing and developing aesthetic that exposes and wryly celebrates the dark and tawdry side of this country’s inner life. (See above.) (Smith)\n\nINTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: ‘GERDA TARO’ AND ‘THIS IS WAR! ROBERT CAPA AT WORK,’ through Jan. 6. There are a number of narratives running through these shows, from the story of two young people who fled Nazi Germany to the rediscovery of Taro’s career and the development of Capa as “the greatest war photographer in the world” (in the view of Picture Post magazine). Accompanied by a book written by Richard Whelan, the show delves into questions about Capa’s famous photograph “Death of a Loyalist Militiaman” and the tricky relationship between truth and fiction in war photography. The show also examines how technological developments in warfare, photography and magazine printing led to a new era of photojournalism during the 1930s and ’40s. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Schwendener)\n\nJAPAN SOCIETY: ‘MAKING A HOME: JAPANESE CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS IN NEW YORK,’ through Jan. 13. This is the first significant group show at Japan Society since Takashi Murakami’s 2005 “Little Boy: The Arts of Japan’s Exploding Subculture.” While it includes emerging artists like Misaki Kawai and Hiroshi Sunairi, the show carves out room for midcareer and long-established artists. Yayoi Kusama is not in the show, but her influence is especially palpable in a series of connected installations that make the most of Japan Society’s dark, airless galleries, transforming them into hypnotically introspective environments. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)\n\nTHE JEWISH MUSEUM: ‘CAMILLE PISSARRO: IMPRESSIONS OF CITY AND COUNTRY,’ through Feb. 3. This exhibition contains few out-and-out masterpieces, but it does give us a rare look at the radical philosophies behind paintings that to a modern eye appear harmlessly bourgeois. For Pissarro, an anarchist and a Jew (albeit a secular one) in 19th-century France, Impressionism was about much more than the fleeting effects of light. It was about labor, the elimination of hierarchies and an idealized balance between urban and rural life. Pissarro emerges from this exhibition as an artist who never quite resolved the conflict between labor and sensation, but whose subtly anti-authoritarian stance propelled painting into the next century. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\n\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM AND OTHER MODERN WORKS: THE MURIEL KALLIS STEINBERG NEWMAN COLLECTION,’ through Feb. 3. One of the Met’s most significant gifts of midcentury art, promised in 1980 and finalized last year, is taut and rich, reflective of a passionately discerning eye. Nearly everything is a standout, not just the rare de Kooning and the substantial Pollock, or works by Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Claes Oldenburg and Jules Olitski. Max Ernst’s portrait of Gala Eluard; sculptures by Giacometti and Jacques Lipchitz; paintings by Alfred Leslie and Mark Tobey; and a collage by Anne Ryan radiate an almost brazen self-sufficiency. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)\n\nTHE MET: ‘THE AGE OF REMBRANDT: DUTCH PAINTING IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,’ through Jan. 6. The Met has long advertised itself as a grand art multiplex, a cluster of several separate world-class museums under a single roof. And we get a demonstration in this display of its entire 17th-century Dutch painting collection: 228 pictures, of which roughly a third are usually on view at any time, and some never. In addition to the Rembrandts, there are five Vermeers, nearly a dozen Frans Halses, and the list goes on in an inventory of breathtaking scope and depth. How to package it? The Met has come up with a theme, and a perfect one for our time: money. The work has been sorted not by artists’ names or dates, but by the names and dates of the collectors who bought and gave the paintings to the museum. This is the history of the Dutch Golden Age according to the American Gilded Age. (See above.) (Cotter)\n\n★ THE MET: ‘BRIDGING EAST AND WEST: THE CHINESE DIASPORA AND LIN YUTANG,’ through Feb. 10. Focused on a single modern family art collection, this show weaves like a DNA strand through the Met’s Chinese painting galleries. The 40 examples of painting and calligraphy belonged to the writer and scholar Lin Yutang (1895-1976) and his descendants, who have divided their time between China and the West. Accumulated over years, the collection has the casual logic of a household photo album, with evidence of shared habits, tastes and temperaments, and of personal interchange between generations. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\n\nTHE MET: ‘DEPTH OF FIELD,’ through March 23. The Met’s recently acquired large-scale photographs finally have some room to breathe in the new Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography, a high-ceilinged, gray-carpeted sanctuary on the second floor. Curators at MoMA need not worry: The inaugural installation (a sampler rather than a thematic slice) is dominated by white, mostly male Europeans and heavily weighted with references to history and landscape painting. Despite its limitations, “Depth of Field” is not a bad debut. We can also expect more from future installations, which will explore themes like “photography about photography.” (See above.) (Rosenberg)\n\n★ THE MET: ‘ETERNAL ANCESTORS: THE ART OF THE CENTRAL AFRICAN RELIQUARY,’ through March 2. Sure to be one of the sleepers of the fall art season, this beautiful show has a universal theme: life as a cosmic journey homeward, with parental spirits, embodied in charismatic materials and images, counseling and chiding us every step of the way. European, Asian and African reliquaries sit side by side in the first gallery; then some of the world’s greatest Fang and Kota sculptures take over and sweep through to the end. (See above.) (Cotter)\n\n★ THE MET: ‘THE GATES OF PARADISE: LORENZO GHIBERTI’S RENAISSANCE MASTERPIECE,’ through Jan. 13. Remember when the Mona Lisa came to the Met? I don’t either, but it can’t have been much more thrilling than seeing 3 of the 10 gilded bronze reliefs that Lorenzo Ghiberti completed for the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence without having to leave town. “Adam and Eve,” “Jacob and Esau” and “David and Goliath” represent especially well Ghiberti’s new, almost cinematic fusion of action, emotion and narrative. Newly cleaned, they have never looked more golden or less oldie. (See above.) (Smith)\n\nTHE MET: ‘SILVERSMITHS TO THE NATION: THOMAS FLETCHER AND SIDNEY GARDINER, 1808-1842,’ through May 4. Blending neo-Classical kitsch, patriotic flair and superb craftsmanship, the Philadelphia silversmiths Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner pumped up the genre of the commemorative cup to works of awesome, small-scale monumentalism. Standing almost 30 inches from its hairy paw feet to the furrowed brow of a bellicose eagle mounted on the lid of its soup tureen bowl, an urn made in 1813 to honor Capt. Isaac Hull was at the time the heaviest, tallest and most complex work in silver ever produced in North America. It is still pretty impressive. (See above.) (Johnson)\n\n★ THE MET: ‘TAPESTRY IN THE BAROQUE: THREADS OF SPLENDOR,’ through Jan. 6. No one was fully prepared for the hullabaloo over the Met’s first big tapestry show five years ago, but it turned out to be an international sensation, and this one will too. The 44 Baroque tapestries here are among the largest nonarchitectural objects in the museum, and some of the most epically labor-intensive. But it is as studies in socioeconomic propaganda that their real interest lies. (See above.) (Cotter)\n\nMORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: ‘DRAWING CONNECTIONS,’ through Jan. 6. Four contemporary artists show their own works on paper along with pieces that they selected from the museum’s drawing collection. The result is not to the advantage of the living artists: Georg Baselitz, Ellsworth Kelly, Giuseppe Penone and Dorothea Rockburne. Nevertheless, the show affords a good occasion to ponder the breach between Modernism and traditionalist humanism, and the old master works, which range from pieces by followers of Mantegna and Perugino to drawings by Degas and Cézanne, are great. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.morganlibrary.org. (Johnson)\n\n★ MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: ‘PAINTED WITH WORDS: VINCENT VAN GOGH’S LETTERS TO ÉMILE BERNARD,’ through Jan. 6. Words, ideas, sensations and images are packed into this exhibition, a manuscript display that is also something more than that. Although 20 handwritten letters from van Gogh to Bernard, a French artist and writer 15 years his junior, are at its center, they are surrounded by nearly two dozen van Gogh painting and drawings, among them a splendid self-portrait. (See above.) (Cotter)\n\nEL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: ‘EL MUSEO’S BIENAL: THE (S) FILES,’ through Jan. 6. You feel the growing pains and attempts to stretch out in the fifth edition of “The (S) Files” (short for “The Selected Files).” The show provides a survey of 51 emerging artists based in New York and from this year’s invited guest country, Ecuador. Some of the works distinctly consider location, displacement and identity. Others are less concerned with issues that make for good biennial panel discussions and more interested in mining older art  Surrealism, Minimalism and Postminimalism  and employing craft techniques. Many of the artists in “The (S) Files” have appeared in other local survey shows, which raises the criticism often leveled at biennials: that in trying to cover the waterfront of contemporary art, they end up making the waterfront look, from every angle, increasingly the same. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Schwendener)\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2007: TANYTH BERKELEY, SCOTT MCFARLAND, BERNI SEARLE,’ through Jan. 1. So what’s new in photography? This is what you might hope to find out at this annual exhibition showcasing work by emerging  or “less familiar”  photographers. Tanyth Berkeley, a New York artist of the Diane Arbus school, is here, as well as Scott McFarland, a photographer whose modus operandi is digital manipulation (like his fellow Vancouverite Jeff Wall), and Berni Searle, a South African who works with serial formats. Their work doesn’t reveal much of what is truly cutting-edge in photography, but it offers a democratic, international scope. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener)\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘NEW PERSPECTIVES IN LATIN AMERICAN ART, 1930-2006: SELECTIONS FROM A DECADE OF ACQUISITIONS,’ through Feb. 25. Collecting Latin American art is a long-standing tradition at MoMA, but it languished a bit in the 1960s and ’70s. These recent acquisitions attest to its resurgence in the ’90s, with a shift toward various forms of Constructivist-based abstraction that emerged from that region, starting in the postwar period. Unusually oriented toward the body in its emphasis on optical perception and the possibility of function, these selections set the stage for subsequent generations of artists, many of whom are also represented here. The postwar works are especially exceptional, and historically important, but the choices throughout are for the most part excellent. (See above.) (Smith)\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘MARTIN PURYEAR,’ through Jan. 14. The Modern’s temporary exhibition galleries come into their own as containers for 40 of Martin Puryear’s elegantly thoughtful, mostly wooden sculptures. With five more exceptionally attenuated ones on the atrium level, the show sums up one of the most interesting bodies of work to develop out of and against Minimalism. Mr. Puryear subjected the movement’s emphasis on whole, static volumes to his commitment to working by hand, with poetic forms, to create a distinctive vocabulary of poetic meanings that move effortlessly among intimations of human, architectural and natural references. (See above.) (Smith)\n\n★ MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘GEORGES SEURAT: THE DRAWINGS,’ through Jan. 7. This sublime exhibition confirms that the classical remove of Seurat’s impeccable, stylized painting  along with his signature granulation of light and space  was distilled from an active engagement with the world. Famous drawings are abundant here, but so are less familiar views, like those showing the ragged outer edges of Paris seemingly lost in darkness. All four of the artist’s surviving sketchbooks are also included, along with excellent computerized facsimiles that visitors can browse through, thereby joining Seurat on his wanderings. (See above.) (Smith)\n\nNATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: ‘THE ABSTRACT IMPULSE: FIFTY YEARS OF ABSTRACTION AT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY, 1956-2006,’ through Jan. 6. This exhibition illuminates the troubled history of abstraction at the academy over the last half-century, with a selection of 47 paintings, sculptures and works on paper by its members, many only recently elected, who took part in movements like Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism and Kinetic and Op Art. Drawn almost entirely from the museum’s collection, it may not be an outstanding group of artworks, but it helps to explain how this once-celebrated museum and school lost much of its prestige. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)\n\nNEUE GALERIE: ‘GUSTAV KLIMT: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS REVIEW,’ through June 30. The first New York museum show devoted exclusively to this Viennese master is less a coherent Klimt exhibition than a Klimt-o-rama. The main draw is a veritable retrospective of the drawings, erotic and otherwise, and a smattering of paintings starring the new-in-town, gold-on-gold “Adele Bloch-Bauer I.” Also here: a photo mural of sections of Klimt’s most famous painted mural, the “Beethoven Frieze”; a period room; photographs and personal effects, including one of the artist’s signature caftans; and piped-in music, all written in Vienna of course, and available for purchase on CD. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)\n\nNEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: ‘UNMONUMENTAL: THE OBJECT IN THE 21ST CENTURY,’ through March 23. The New Museum has eked as much exhibition space as possible out of its new, elegantly bare-bones building and is devoting almost all of it to a raucous, polemical first show. The premise, as reflected in the work of 30 artists (among them, Rachel Harrison, Isa Genzken, Eliot Hundley, Carol Bove, Jock Bock and Sarah Lucas), is that assemblage sculpture is the most viable art form of the moment. Lo-tech, cheap, portable and rough around the edges if not actually falling apart, it reflects our fractured times and also resists easy absorption by the art market. While visually messy, way too hip and a tad monotonous, the show is a gauntlet thrown down to other New York museums. It says: Get your nerve on. Take a stand. Do something that inspires true argument, not just endless kvetching. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)\n\nNEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: ‘NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,’ through Jan. 13. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with “sacred” sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole’s epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, “The Course of Empire,” is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)\n\nNOGUCHI MUSEUM: ‘DESIGN: ISAMU KENMOCHI AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,’ through May 25 (extended). The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi’s “Japanese modern” furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi’s most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 32-37 Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)\n\nTHE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: ‘KORI NEWKIRK: 1997-2007,’ through March 9. Kori Newkirk first came to New York’s attention in the 2001 group show “Freestyle” at the Studio Museum. This Bronx-born artist, based in Los Angeles, is now having a solo at the museum, organized by its director and chief curator, Thelma Golden. This 10-year survey devotes plenty of room  nearly the entire double-height main gallery  to the shimmering pony-bead curtains for which Mr. Newkirk is best known. It also finds him pursuing more oblique forms of expression, particularly in his recent forays into video. It all adds up to a kind of maxed-out minimalism or, as Mr. Newkirk has described it, a “ghetto-fabulous conceptualism.” 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\n\nWADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: ‘FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,’ through Dec. 30. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you’ll find treasures like “Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy” (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico’s poignant, poetic fragment “Head of an Angel” (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbarán’s fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, “Saint Serapion” (1628). But the pièce de résistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer’s inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Grace Glueck)\n\n★ WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: ‘KARA WALKER: MY COMPLEMENT, MY ENEMY, MY OPPRESSOR, MY LOVE,’ through Feb. 3. Kara Walker’s exquisite, implacable, loose-cannon retrospective at the Whitney Museum is about race, whether in silhouette panoramas cut from black paper, in incendiary drawings or in narrative videos made with shadow puppets. They add up to one of the most important and stirring bodies of art produced by any American in the past 15 years. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)\n\nWHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: ‘LAWRENCE WEINER: AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE,’ through Feb. 10. Finally, one of the American progenitors of Conceptual Art receives his first full-dress retrospective in this country, filling the Whitney’s fourth floor a trifle too full with cryptic aphorisms, instructions and near-poetry in letters that come in all sizes and several fonts. Some have been acted on; others march across walls. A bit full, perhaps, but the career of this language-based sculptor is worth telling in detail and, in a time of art market excess, is just what the doctor ordered. (See above.) (Smith)\n\nGalleries: Uptown\n\nPHILIP GUSTON AND JASPER JOHNS This revealing two-gallery show intermingles efforts by Guston from his late, post-Abstract Expressionist phase (i.e., from about 1969 to his death in 1980) and pieces from most chapters of Mr. Johns’s career. There are remarkable differences, but so many parallels between the paintings, drawings and prints of each artist emerge, that it’s as if the two had been separated at birth. Both come off as fascinating monsters of creative self-absorption. Leo Castelli, 18 East 77th Street, (212) 249-4470, castelligallery.com; Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 925-4338, baeditions.com, through Dec. 22. (Johnson)\n\nKONRAD KLAPHECK: ‘PAINTINGS’ Mr. Klapheck’s second exhibition in New York in nearly 40 years reintroduces this German painter’s semi-abstract, wryly sexualized, exquisitely rendered distortions of everyday objects. Faucets suggest female bodies; chairs couple with smaller, more pliant appliances; and adding machines acquire the heft and monumentality of armored vehicles or ancient temples. The skewing of logical perspectives helps. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Dec. 22. (Smith)\n\nGalleries: 57th Street\n\nBARBARA KRUGER: ‘PICTURE/READINGS 1978’ These early text-and-image pieces, classics of their kind, combine off-kilter photographs of houses in Florida and California with first-person monologues written in the voices of their imagined (usually female) inhabitants. They reveal this influential artist’s debt to the subcategory of Conceptualism called Story Art, one of the few pockets of 1970s postminimalism that has not yet been colonized by the present. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com, through Dec. 22. (Smith)\n\nGalleries: SoHo\n\n‘DISPLAY’ The New York branch of the London gallery Museum 52 inaugurates its Lower East Side space with a stimulating group show. Sarah Greenberger Rafferty approaches the “display” theme literally, with elaborately mounted photographs of souvenir plates. George Henry Longly renders it subliminally in paintings that fade into the wall. A sculpture of broken mirrors by Philip Hausmeier makes a fragmentary thing of preening self-regard, while the talented young New York artist Sean Raspet turns vats of transparent hair gel into mini-exhibitions. Museum 52, 95 Rivington Street, between Orchard and Stanton Streets, (212) 228-3090, museum52.com, through Dec. 22. (Cotter)\n\nMARIKO MORI: ‘TOM NA H-IU’ This overproduced show provides three beautiful encounters with whiteness and rounded forms that seem closer to various kinds of New Age design than to art. The news release reveals connections to ancient Japanese culture, Celtic religion or, via computer, an observatory outside Tokyo. The artist’s interest in spirituality and science is more convincing in a series of relatively modest drawings that she made herself. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Dec. 22. (Smith)\n\nALAN SARET: ‘GANG DRAWINGS’ The gangs referred to in Alan Saret’s latest exhibition, the first major show of his work since a 1990 retrospective at P.S. 1, aren’t Angels or Outlaws, Bloods or Crips. Instead they are clutched fistfuls of colored pencils scraped, twirled or swept across the page. The earliest examples are from the late 1960s and executed on graph paper. Later Mr. Saret broke free of the grid, stretching out onto larger sheets of paper. Drawings like “Liquiacoriadance Entering” or “The Verg Integranxin Ensoulment” reveal Mr. Saret’s spiritualist bent, but works like “Triple Cluster” or “Three Circles Ruled & Free Sweep” leave you free to contemplate his draftsmanship without pondering its possible metaphysical functions. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through Feb. 7. (Schwendener)\n\nGalleries: Chelsea\n\nTHOMAS DEMAND: ‘YELLOWCAKE’ In eight large color photographs, this German artist reconstructs the scene of an alleged, seemingly minor crime: a burglary at the Niger Embassy in Rome that precipitated the forged documents used to justify the United States invasion of Iraq. A retroactive ominousness grates against the untouched innocence of the artist’s paper reconstruction. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com, through Dec. 22. (Smith)\n\n* KAMOINGE: ‘REVEALING THE FACE OF KATRINA’ The 10 artists in this group show are members of Kamoinge, a collective of African-American photographers founded in 1963. All traveled to different parts of the Gulf region in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and recorded, in distinctively different ways, what they found: ruined neighborhoods in a panoramic view of the Lower Ninth Ward by Gerald Cyrus; displaced citizens in portraits by Collette V. Fournier, John Pinderhughes, Herb Robinson and Radcliffe Roye; signs and memorials in pictures by Salimah Ali. The individual images are gripping; the cumulative record far more than that. HP Gallery at Calumet Photo, 22 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-8500, calumetphoto.com, through Dec. 28. (Cotter)\n\nADRIAN PACI: ‘PASSAGES’ In the better half of a rather too quiet double-gallery commercial debut, this talented Albanian-born artist, who lives in Milan, functions as a kind of Conceptual folklorist. He paints stills from videos of Albanian weddings on rough, free-standing plaster walls and, in a video that has also been shown previously, employs a professional mourner from the village of his birth to weep over his still-living body. (The second half of the show is at Smith-Stewart.) Peter Blum, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 244-6055, peterblumgallery.com, through Jan. 5. (Smith)\n\nCHARLES RAY In his first New York exhibition in nearly 10 years, Mr. Ray defines himself more clearly as a sculptor’s sculptor, parlaying his interests in scale, weight and illusion into meditations on sculpture’s presence  above all its stillness and its ability to mimic yet deny life. The works form a rich cat’s cradle of intersecting meanings. One shows a boy playing with a toy car. Another is a greatly enlarged plastic toy  in solid stainless steel. A third depicts a tiny chick breaking out of its egg, venturing into the world of space and objects. While consistent with everything that has preceded it, this show feels, similarly, like a brand-new place for Mr. Ray. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200047, through Jan. 19. (Smith)\n\nTHOMAS RUFF In recent years Mr. Ruff has settled primarily into gathering rather than taking photographs. The Internet is his primary source for images that explore what he has called the “grammar of the media.” Mr. Ruff gravitates toward photographs connected with grand historical events and landscape elements favored by 19th-century painters. Downloaded, digitally manipulated and delivered into the gallery as large-scale C-prints, they continue his longtime project of treating the color photograph as an object (of consumption, if you like) commensurate with easel painting. As disjointed pixel-grids, they offer plenty of perceptual rewards, but Mr. Ruff’s straining for historical significance often makes the Internet look, paradoxically, rather one-dimensional. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through Dec. 22. (Schwendener)\n\nGalleries: Other\n\n★ ‘EQUAL RIGHTS: REGGAE AND SOCIAL CHANGE’ A small show with a big, burning theme. This compact traveling exhibition from Plymouth State University in New Hampshire tells the intertwined stories of Jamaica’s social history and its politically charged music primarily through album covers and posters, beginning with calypso in the late 1950s, moving on to ska in the 1960s, then to reggae. International stars like Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston are considered individually, as are female singers like Marcia Griffith, Rita Marley and Judy Mowatt. With an excellent brochure essay. Danny Simmons’ Corridor Gallery, 334 Grand Avenue, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, (718) 230-5002, rushphilanthropic.org, through Dec. 22. (Cotter)\n\n★ URS FISCHER For his current solo this Swiss artist has destroyed the floor of Gavin Brown’s main gallery by smashing through the concrete and digging deep into the soil, leaving behind an open ditch and mounds of dirt and debris. The physical undermining of art institutions has a long history. Mr. Fisher doesn’t add much new to it, but his epic dig delivers a kind of visual shock almost never encountered in Chelsea, and as a metaphor for art’s digging its own grave, it has particular pertinence now. Gavin Brown’s Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, gavinbrown.biz, through Dec. 22. (Cotter)\n\n‘PAUL MCCARTHY’S CHOCOLATE FACTORY’ The Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy, like everyone else in the art world, has gone into business, specifically a line of expensive chocolate Santa Clauses for the holiday season under the name Peter Paul Chocolates LLC. To this end he has transformed Maccarone Gallery into a factory outlet, replete with a fully staffed confectionary kitchen and packaging department, and a retail office open to take orders seven days a week until the end of December. And even if you don’t want to buy  Santas go for $100 each  you can watch the operation at work. Maccarone Gallery, 630 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 431-4977, maccarone.net, through Dec. 24. (Cotter)\n\n‘MULTIPLE INTERPRETATIONS: CONTEMPORARY PRINTS IN PORTFOLIO’ Digitally produced fake mug shots of Bush administration officials by Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese have stirred up some controversy, but otherwise this is a mild, inoffensive show. Presenting works in various styles by 23 artists added to the New York Public Library’s print collection over the past 10 years, the show has a number of highlights, including Thomas Nozkowski’s eccentric, abstract etchings; wide-angle views of men trying on suits in a luxurious store, engraved by Andrew Raftery; and funny, absurdly rudimentary cartoons etched by David Shrigley. New York Public Library, (212) 592-7730, nypl.org, through Jan. 27. (Johnson)\n\nADRIAN PACI: ‘CENTRO DI PERMANENZA TEMPORANEA’ Half of a two-gallery commercial debut, this show presents a beautifully shot but generic video named after the camps where Italy detains illegal immigrants (“Center of Temporary Permanence”); in it a group of workers, none white, crowds onto a mobile stairway that (spoiler alert) is not attached to a plane. (The second half of the show is at Peter Blum.) Smith-Stewart, 53 Stanton Street, near Eldridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-2821, smith-stewart.com, through Dec. 22. (Smith)\n\n★ JUDIT REIGL Born in Budapest in 1923, Ms. Reigl fled Hungary in 1950 for Paris. There her fantastic figurative work caught the eye of André Breton. But Surrealism held little interest for her, and she moved on to do remarkable series of abstract paintings, changing her style to avoid settling into a routine. The examples in this small, beautiful survey run through the 1970s, and they document a career that fruitfully took alternative paths every step of the way. Janos Gat Gallery, 195 Bowery, at Spring Street, Lower East Side, (212) 677-3525, janosgatgallery.com, through March 1. (Cotter)\n\nPublic Art\n\nMAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, “Conjoined” and “Defunct,” and a glacierlike boulder, “Erratic,” by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is “Conjoined,” a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other’s end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio)\n\nOut of Town\n\n★ PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART: ‘RENOIR LANDSCAPES, 1865-1889,’ through Jan. 6.{cq} This quietly revisionist show momentarily banishes the apple-cheeked babies, buxom women, bathing beauties and flower still lifes that account for Renoir’s wild popularity to reveal the wide-ranging gifts of his inner landscapist. It erodes the image of Renoir as often on automatic pilot, churning out sentimental, rubbery-surfaced works by underscoring the variety and liveliness of his brushwork, his sensitivity not only to natural light but also to natural form and his ability to absorb from other artists without ever losing his own voice. Benjamin Franklin Parkway, at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)\n\n★ WALTERS ART MUSEUM: ‘DÉJÀ VU? REVEALING REPETITION IN FRENCH MASTERPIECES,’ through Jan. 1. It is helpful, before entering this show, to check your postmodern baggage. Few of the artists repeat themselves in the Warholian sense, although the beginnings of modern media culture  prints, photographs, reproductions in newspapers and journals  are much in evidence. “Déjà Vu” supplements collection highlights with international loans, creatively negotiating the divide between salon painters and independent spirits. In some cases the painting owned by the Walters is the original version; in many others it is one of several replicas. The show encourages you to linger over several variations of the same image, noting a reverse in direction, a change in scale or a shift in gesture from one canvas to the next. 600 North Charles Street, Baltimore, (410) 547-9000, thewalters.org. (Rosenberg)\n\nLast Chance\n\nHANY ARMANIOUS: ‘YEAR OF THE PIG STY’ The inaugural New York exhibition of this Egyptian-born Australian artist is a kind of riot of fabrication, conflict and mindless consumption, involving quantities of mud covering the floor, splattered on the walls and central to the art; numerous clogs cast from pink silicone; and a pig pen in which two flamboyant chunks of earth seem to be having a final showdown. The work is both familiar and obscure in familiar ways, but it conveys an impressive sculptural ease and an appealing, provocative bit of let-it-rip madness. Foxy Production, 617 West 27th Street, (212) 239-2758, foxyproduction.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)\n\nMARK BOOTH: ‘SUDDENLY ONE OF THE CARROTS ASKED: “WHAT IS CRIME?”’ Just when you thought you couldn’t take another piece of art with an amusing remark written across its front, or any more gallery walls peppered with unframed drawings, this talented Chicago artist, equally at ease with abstract painting and poetry, makes his New York debut. The words may conjure up a world of their own. And you may find yourself looking longer than you initially expected to. Hudson Franklin, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1189, hudsonfranklin.com; closes on Wednesday. (Smith)\n\nDOUGLAS GORDON: ‘SELF-PORTRAIT OF YOU + ME, AFTER THE FACTORY’ Unlike “24 Hour Psycho,” a signature work in which Douglas Gordon slowed down Hitchcock’s classic horror film to create a glacially paced but mesmerizing spectacle, his art here resorts to splashier measures, taking commercially available posters of Warhol paintings, burning them and mounting the remains on mirrors. The initial impression is of a Warhol-besotted art school project that borrows heavily from the slash-and-burn aesthetic of punk. The question is whether, in borrowing from Warhol, Mr. Gordon adds back enough to make the exchange worthwhile. Even though the show feels gimmicky, leaning heavily on the tired legs of Warhol and punk subversiveness, the installation offers, if nothing else, a kind of over-the-top nihilist update. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes on Saturday. (Schwendener)\n\n★ CLAIRE PENTECOST, JAMES WELLING AND MOYRA DAVEY A haunted, woozy show of photographs by three artists who share an eye for everyday accumulation as still life, and still life as an emblem of transience. Claire Pentecost’s wonderful big pictures of junk food, cigarettes and Asian gods suggest different modes of random consumption; Moyra Davey’s blurry shots of liquor bottles speak of one mode in particular; and James Welling’s bouquets of flowers are like memorials to the ruin that results. Orchard, 47 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1061, orchard47.org; closes on Tuesday. (Cotter)"
