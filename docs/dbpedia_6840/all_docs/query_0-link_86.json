        "text": "Hudson Valley Artists 2024: Bibliography\n\nCurated by Sophie Landres\n\nFebruary 4 – April 7, 2024\n\nChandler and North Galleries\n\nThis iteration of The Dorsky’s annual exhibition of contemporary work by regional artists uses books to situate artworks within a broader body of knowledge and to provide entry points for thinking about their aesthetic, social, or political implications.\n\nFeaturing work by Osi Audu, Alta Buden, Shari Diamond, Kerry Downey, Stevenson Estime, eteam (Franzisa Lamprecht and Hajoe Moderegger), Aki Goto, Adam Henry, Matthew Kirk, Niki Kriese, Melora Kuhn, Catherine Lord, Sean Sullivan, and Audra Wolowiec.\n\nPurple Haze: Art and Drugs Across the Americas\n\nCurated by Estrellita B. Brodsky with Raúl Martínez\n\nSeptember 9 - December 10, 2023\n\nMorgan Anderson Gallery\n\nPurple Haze: Art and Drugs Across the Americas examines the Americas’ ambiguous relationship with drugs and their representation in the media and the public imagination. Conceived as a collaboration with the Dorsky Museum and building on the 2018-2019 exhibition,Comfortably Numb: A Critical Investigation into the Cultural Impact of Drugs and Narcoticspresented at ANOTHER SPACE in Chelsea, Purple Hazewill bring together works by multigenerational international artists in a broad range of media, including video, photography, and installation. The exhibition will survey the pervasive presence of drugs in Americans’ daily lives as well as their impact on social,political, and economic relations throughout the two continents, north and south.\n\nBFA & MFA Thesis Spring 23\n\nCurated by the Department of Art and The Dorsky Museum\n\nApril 28 - May 21, 2023\n\nAlice and Horace Chandler and North Galleries\n\nAt the end of each semester, the Dorsky Museum is proud to exhibit new artwork by students earning Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts degrees.\n\nThe thesis exhibitions are the culmination of the students' fine art studies, akin to the final exam, research project, or dissertation required of students earning liberal arts or science degrees.\n\nBFA I\n\nOpening Reception: Friday, April 28, 5 - 7 pm\n\nAlemir Beltre, Bianca Cabrera, Cy Hinojosa, Parker Parenti, Joli Perfit, Nia Scott, Daryn Seiden, Brooke Vissichio, Conrad Wickham\n\nBFA II\n\nOpening Reception: Friday, May 5, 5 - 7 pm\n\nSarah Boudinot, Kayla Boyle, Raegan Cole, Rachel Gee, Talula Evan Baer, Hunter Larson, Jeremy McEvoy, Natalie Thomas, Jacob Wilt\n\nMFA\n\nOpening Reception: Friday, May 12, 5 - 7 pm\n\nBear Cooper, Yuting Du, Michael Fortenberry, Max Hodson, Joseph Kattou, Ibrahim Khazzaka, Jennifer Levine, Sofia Rock, Viktorsha Uliyanova\n\nHudson Valley Artists 2022: The Material, The Thing\n\nCurated by Nicole Hayes\n\nJune 22 – November 6, 2022\n\nAlice and Horace Chandler Gallery and North Gallery\n\nThe Material, The Thing, the 15th annual Hudson Valley Artists exhibition, considers how artists understand and reimagine the material culture we live in. Every time we walk into a big box store we are inundated by meaningless disposable things. We have collectively lost an understanding of the materials that make the things we live with. Who even knows how plywood is made, or what microcrystalline cellulose is, but we all have it in our homes. In this cultural moment artists and artisans become an essential conduit of understanding the materials and the things in our society.\n\nParticipating artists: Miguel Braceli | Louis Brawley | Royal Brown Jr. | Sydney Cash | Adam Chau | Monica Church | Melissa Dadourian | Shoshana Dentz | Dan Devine | Adriana Farmiga | Daniel Giordano | Romina Gonzales | Meg Hitchcock | Laetitia Hussain | Will Hutnick | Niki Lederer | Elisa Lendvay | Ashley Lyon | Patricia Miranda | Joel Olzak | Courtney Puckett | Jordan Rosenow | Julie Torres | Katharine Umsted | Melissa Weaver | Millicent Young\n\nBenjamin Wigfall & Communications Village\n\nCurated by Drew Thompson in consultation with Sarah Eckhardt of the VMFA\n\nSeptember 10 – December 11, 2022\n\nMorgan Anderson Gallery, Howard Greenberg Family Gallery, and Sara Bedrick Gallery\n\nThis exhibition provides the first retrospective of Benjamin Wigfall’s art, from his early career in Virginia in the 1950s to his founding of Communications Village, a community art space in Kingston, New York, in the 1970s.\n\nIt will also feature works by important artists with whom Wigfall collaborated during his career, including Benny Andrews, Mavis Pusey, Betty Blayton, Charles Gaines, Joe Ramos, Ernie Frazier, Mel Edwards, Bob Blackburn, Romare Bearden, and Ernest Crichlow.\n\nBenjamin Wigfall & Communications Village is organized by the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art, in partnership with the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nMary Frank: The Observing Heart\n\nCurated by David Hornung\n\nFebruary 5 – July 17, 2022\n\nMorgan Anderson Gallery and Howard Greenberg Family Gallery\n\nAs part of our Hudson Valley Masters series, this exhibition presents Mary Frank’s powerful artwork from over six decades, which has always centered on the twin themes of social justice and the preservation of the natural world. Acclaimed artist/activist Mary Frank has been making art in her Manhattan and Hudson Valley studios for over sixty years. She is an independent spirit who emerged during the years of rising feminism in the early 70’s and has always followed a personal vision distinct from prevailing art world fashion. Mary Frank: The Observing Heart is a gathering of sculpture, painting, drawings, prints, and photographs from throughout her illustrious career.\n\nThe Dorsky at 20: Reflections at a Milestone (Part II)\n\nCurated by Wayne Lempka\n\nFebruary 5 – July 17, 2022\n\nSara Bedrick Gallery\n\nContinuing to mark our 20th anniversary, we share more recent and promised gifts to the Museum’s permanent collection. It not only reflects on our twenty years of being an important cultural force in the region, but honors and celebrates the important individuals who have so generously given exceptional art gifts in order to ensure The Dorsky Museum will continue to be an abundant resource not only for the SUNY New Paltz campus community but for visitors far and wide.\n\nThis exhibition will be the second rendition of a two-part series where we reflect on our history, plan for our future, and honor all those who have helped to shape The Dorsky Museum into what it is today.\n\nSomewhere in Advance of Nowhere: Freedom Dreams in Contemporary Art\n\nCurated by nico wheadon\n\nFebruary 5 – April 10, 2022\n\nAlice and Horace Chandler and North Galleries\n\nSomewhere in Advance of Nowhere: Freedom Dreams in Contemporary Art lauds the vital role of artists in dismantling broken systems, envisioning new shared realities, and building future alternatives. Drawing inspiration from Robin D.G. Kelley’s seminal book, Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination, the exhibition takes up his provocation that “without new visions we don't know what to build, only what to knock down.” From interactive, site-specific installations to meditative photographs, videos, and works on paper, the featured works pose a series of existential questions, including: What are we trying to change? What must be built and what must be knocked down to best advance our efforts? What wisdom can be borrowed from the past in charting new paths forward? And, How do we manifest bold futures envisioned by people of color amidst systemic imbalances in structural power?\n\nLife After the Revolution: Kate Millett’s Art Colony for Women\n\nCurated by Anna Conlan\n\nSeptember 11 – December 12, 2021\n\nMorgan Anderson Gallery and Howard Greenberg Family Gallery\n\nIn the early 1970s, with the advance from her recently published book, Sexual Politics, writer and visual artist Kate Millett (1934–2017) bought an old farmhouse on a parcel of land just outside of Poughkeepsie. By the late 1970s, plans for a women’s art colony were underway. Women came to the Farm to help renovate the buildings and make living quarters, a dark room, a sculpture studio, and screen-printing facilities. Millett described this colony of artists working together as “life after the revolution,” where women could experience communal living and freedoms that weren’t yet possible elsewhere. This exhibition will share Millett’s vision for the Farm, featuring her artwork, and that of the artists who visited. A catalog accompanies the exhibition.\n\nThe Dorsky at 20: Reflections at a Milestone\n\nCurated by Amy Fredrickson and Wayne Lempka\n\nSeptember 11 – December 12, 2021\n\nSara Bedrick Gallery\n\nTo mark our 20th anniversary, we share an exhibition of recent and promised gifts to the Museum’s permanent collection. It not only reflects on our twenty years of being an important cultural force in the region, but honors and celebrates the important individuals who have so generously given exceptional art gifts in order to ensure The Dorsky Museum will continue to be an abundant resource not only for the SUNY New Paltz campus community but for visitors far and wide.\n\nThis exhibition is the first rendition of a two-part series where we reflect on our history, plan for our future, and honor all those who have helped to shape The Dorsky Museum into what it is today.\n\nHudson Valley Artists 2021: Who Really Cares?\n\nCurated by Helen Toomer\n\nJuly 7 – November 14, 2021\n\nAlice and Horace Chandler and North Galleries\n\nFor the 14th annual Hudson Valley Artists exhibition, curated by Helen Toomer, we invited artists to submit artwork that deals with the challenges of the past year and the re-imaginings of years to come, responding to the question “Who really cares?” asked by Marvin Gaye fifty years ago on the monumental album, “What’s Going On.”\n\nThe exhibition will feature a diverse group of twenty-eight local artists, chosen from over 380 applications:\n\nSharon Bates | Natalie Baxter & Julia Norton | Sean Bayliss | Natalie Beall | Vernon Byron III | Randy Calderone | Maureen Drennan | Jen Dwyer | Echo Goff | Carl Grauer | Norman Magnusson | Katrina Majkut | Christopher Manning | Maeve McCool | Patrick Meagher | Paul Akira Miyamoto | Ocean Morisset | Liz Nielsen | Richard Pantell | Gina Randazzo | Ransome | Macon Reed | Marcy Rosewater | Kristen Schiele | Renee Stanko | Amelia Toelke | Karen Whitman\n\nKathy Goodell: Infra-Loop, Selections 1994—2020\n\nCurated by Andrew Woolbright\n\nFebruary 6 – July 11, 2021\n\nMorgan Anderson Gallery and Howard Greenberg Family Gallery\n\nInfra-Loop explores the artistic practice of Kathy Goodell, whose work remains a mysterious synthesis. Associated with many movements and contemporaries, Goodell’s career charts a path and fills in the gaps of what we think about art in the ‘90s, ‘00s, and the present. Her practice has determined itself through a kind of non-specificity, one that resists easy classification and interpretation. The meaning of her work, and context through which we are to understand it, is simultaneous and withheld—west coast spiritualism meets east coast abstraction; procedural non-objectivity blends with painterly biomorphism; protean theosophy informs post-modernist contemporary. This survey of work explores the through-lines in Goodell's practice as a moving target, examining an artist that is constantly challenging and reinventing her practice.\n\nSupport for this exhibition was provided by a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Grant.\n\nWe Wear the Mask: Race and Representation in the Dorsky Museum Permanent Collection\n\nCurated by Jean-Marc Superville Sovak\n\nSeptember 12 – November 22, 2020\n\nSeminar Room Gallery\n\nTaking its cue from Paul Laurence Dunbar’s 1895 poem, We Wear the Mask pairs artwork from the Museum’s collection in a series of trans-historical, multi-cultural dialogues, using “remixing” as a strategy to unmask the ways racialized identities are presented and perceived.\n\nWe Wear the Mask stages the contradictions inherent in representations of race and in American culture as a whole—as exemplified by the Dorsky Museum Collection. Featuring a range of artwork and artifacts that span almost three-thousand years—from ancient Egyptian funerary figures to polaroid photographs by Andy Warhol, — eighteen works selected from the over six-thousand objects in the Dorsky Museum collection are paired into distinct juxtapositions. A trans-historical, multi-cultural “remixing,” this exhibition seeks a third space of meaning to better represent and understand racial diversity in this moment of cultural and political reckoning.\n\nDos Mundos: (Re)Constructing Narratives\n\nCurated by Juanita Lanzo and Stephanie A. Lindquist\n\nSeptember 12 – November 22, 2020\n\nSara Bedrick Gallery\n\nDos Mundos: (Re)Constructing Narratives is a curated exhibition, organized to present the photographs of 12 artists of color who are recipients of En Foco's Photography Fellowships. The current Dos Mundos theme is inspired by the 1973 Dos Mundos exhibition, and hopes to not only capture the contemporary duality of traditions and cultures in immigrant and ethnic communities, but to also revisit and demonstrate the challenges of systemic exclusion from the mainstream as described by the 1973 exhibition.\n\nFeaturing: Damarys Alvarez | Laylah Amatullah Barrayn | Tau Battice | Yu-Chen Chiu | Anthony Hamboussi | Daesha Harris | Erika Morillo | Danny Ramon Peralta | Antonio Pulgarin | Roger Richardson | Cinthia Santos-Briones | Aaron Turner\n\nJan Sawka: The Place of Memory (The Memory of Place)\n\nCurated by Hanna Maria Sawka and Dr. Frank Boyer\n\nFebruary 8 – November 22, 2020\n\nMorgan Anderson Gallery & Howard Greenberg Family Gallery\n\nJan Sawka (1946–2012) was a noted contemporary artist of Polish origin and global reach. His work is in the collections of over 60 museums worldwide. Sawka lived and worked in the mid-Hudson Valley from 1985 until his death, conceiving of and producing many of his most notable works in his High Falls, NY, studio.\n\nThis exhibition is made up of works that illuminate two aspects of his practice, his fascination with human consciousness, in this case, with memory, and his interest in place, and the places through which a human life passes. Sawka’s working method and artworks are truly visionary, in the sense that he always worked from mental images. Every work he did is open to his thoughts, his emotions, his mental associations, and, above all to memory.\n\nHudson Valley Artists 2020: New Folk\n\nCurated by Anna Conlan\n\nSeptember 12 – October 25, 2020\n\nAlice and Horace Chandler Gallery and North Gallery\n\nThis year’s annual Hudson Valley Artists juried show features twenty-nine local artists in a vibrant exploration of craft, cultural heritage, and the communities we create together. New Folk showcases artwork that distinctively captures the spirit of contemporary folk practice in the Hudson Valley today. It offers a vision of what folk art can be—highly skilled, locally-sourced, idiosyncratic, and resourceful. New Folk is also a catch-all for the long history of visitors and immigrants in our region, and the exhibition explores the inherited cultural traditions that “new folk” bring with them.\n\nCollecting Local: Twelve Years of the Hudson Valley Artists Annual Purchase Award\n\nCurated by Anna Conlan\n\nFebruary 8 – July 12, 2020\n\nSara Bedrick Gallery\n\nEvery year The Dorsky invites local artists to share their work through our juried Hudson Valley Artists exhibition. From hundreds of submissions, curators select artwork that resonates with a chosen theme. The aim is to gather exciting new work in a cohesive exhibition, whilst demonstrating the strength and diversity of contemporary art across the eleven counties. Each year artwork from the Hudson Valley Artists exhibition is chosen for the Purchase Award and becomes part of our permanent collection. Collecting Local allows the public to see these outstanding artworks displayed together for the first time.\n\nArtists in the Exhibition: Curt Belshe and Lise Prown | Laura Cannamela | Sharon Core | François Deschamps | Richard Edelman | Charles Geiger | Holly Hughes | Patrick Kelley | Barbara Leon | Deborah Lucke | Nestor Madalengoitia | Mollie McKinley | Stephen Niccolls | Libby Paloma | Gilbert Plantinga | Elisa Pritzker | Adie Russell | Thomas Sarrantonio | Jean-Marc Superville Sovak | Amy Talluto\n\nStay Home, Make Art: Hudson Valley, NY, Edition\n\nCurated by Anna Conlan\n\nApril – July 2020\n\nonline\n\nAt the beginning of April 2020, The Dorsky Museum asked Hudson Valley artists, how are you being creative during social distancing? We were humbled by the remarkable response we received. Over 250 Hudson Valley artists have shared what they have been making and we are exhibiting their art on the Museum social media channels. Stay Home, Make Art is a virtual exhibition that addresses how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted creative practice, keeps local artwork visible, and promotes safe social distancing.\n\nTo view Stay Home, Make Art: Hudson Valley, NY, Edition visit us on Instagram or Facebook at @dorskymusem\n\nWar!\n\nCurated by Wayne Lempka\n\nFebruary 8 – Juy 12, 2020\n\nSeminar Room\n\nAs our world becomes increasingly chaotic, the threat of war occurring on our home soil appears more likely to be a reality rather than a possibility. Since the beginning of time, both major and minor conflicts between individual ethnic groups and nations has had a significant impact on the course of history and on the power to shape and change our world.\n\nWas there ever a time in history when there was not some warring faction facing off against another group of people? One would be hard pressed to find a time period when the world was completely free of conflicts. Beginning with primitive man in the bronze age, to the earliest battles in ancient Mesopotamia, to medieval Europe, to today’s wars in the Middle East and beyond, armed conflict has been a primary preoccupation throughout history and its use has become deeply rooted in our culture.\n\nTotally Dedicated: Leonard Contino 1940–2016\n\nCurated by Anna Conlan\n\nJanuary 22 – April 5, 2020\n\nAlice and Horace Chandler Gallery and North Gallery\n\nLeonard Contino was a Brooklyn-born, self-taught abstract artist whose tenacious exploration of pictorial space spanned a fifty-year career. In 1959 at the age of 19, Contino was severely injured in a diving accident. Paralyzed from the shoulders down, he retained some mobility in his arms and hands, and needed to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. While in rehabilitation at the Rusk Institute in New York City, Contino met a fellow patient, the sculptor Mark di Suvero, who would become a lifelong close friend. Di Suvero challenged him to start making art. Until this point, Contino’s creativity had been mostly directed to “pinstriping” decorative lines onto hot rod cars in his Brooklyn neighborhood. With di Suvero’s encouragement and the help of a metal brace to support his wrist, he began to draw and then to paint. Contino went on to create extraordinary art for the next five decades. He became devoted to his daily practice of painting from morning to evening, and often then making collages late into the night. Contino later observed that being an artist was like a religious calling, you had to be “totally dedicated.” Featuring over eighty artworks, Totally Dedicated is the largest exhibition of Contino’s work to date and encompasses large hard-edge geometric paintings, playful collages, delicate reliefs and sculptures from the 1960s through the 2000’s. It also includes two painted steel sculptures that di Suvero and Contino made together.\n\nBFA/MFA Thesis Exhibition Spring 2020\n\nCurated by art faculty and students\n\nApril 24 – May 19, 2020\n\nAlice & Horace Chandler Gallery and North Gallery\n\nAt the end of each semester, the Dorsky Museum is proud to exhibit new artwork by students earning Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts degrees. The thesis exhibitions are the culmination of the students' fine art studies, akin to the final exam, research project, or dissertation required of students earning liberal arts or science degrees.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, BFA and MFA students have worked with one another, faculty advisors, and the Museum team to plan this exhibition, each student designing and installing their own work. We will showcase the talent of these emerging artists at the end of the 2020 Fall semester.

Between roughly 1750 and 1850, ukiyo-e prints moved well beyond the representation of their core subject matter of courtesans and actors (through which they helped create a celebrity culture with similarities to our own), and broadened out to include such themes as literary illustration and commentary, traditional folk tales that often had political subtexts, landscapes, and eccentric self-expression.\n\nMadness in Vegetables: Hudson Valley Artists 2019\n\nCurated by Alyson Baker and Candice Madey\n\nJune 15 – November 10, 2019\n\nAlice and Horace Chandler Gallery and North Gallery\n\nThe 2019 edition of the Hudson Valley Artists series is titled Madness in Vegetables: Hudson Valley Artists 2019. It calls for works that address the political and civic implications of choosing a rural life; the enticing beauty and repellant brutality of nature; our ever-changing climate; the wild character of plants, gardens, forests, and fauna; the relevance, power and forms of anthropomorphic mythmaking; and poetic and fantastical interpretations of the woodlands.\n\nExhibiting artists:\n\nBob Barry | Julie Evans | Mara Held | Virginia Lavado | Elisa Lendvay | Scott Serrano | Claudia McNulty | David Nyzio | Phyllis Gay Palmer | Libby Paloma | Lauren Piperno | Jackie Shatz | Linda Stillman | Jean-Marc Superville Sovak | Christina Tenaglia | scrap wrenn | Roberta Ziemba\n\nBFA/MFA Thesis Exhibition Spring 2019\n\nCurated by art faculty and students\n\nApril 26 — May 21, 2019\n\nAlice & Horace Chandler Gallery and North Gallery\n\nAt the end of each semester, students earning Bachelor of Fine Arts or Master of Fine Arts degrees exhibit art work in the Museum. The thesis exhibition is akin to the final exam, research project, or dissertation required of students earning liberal arts or science degrees.\n\nThe BFA and MFA students have worked with one another and with faculty advisors and museum staff to plan these exhibitions; each student has completed the design and installation of their own work.\n\nBFA: Kaitlyn Antoniadis | Amanda Aponte | Julia Betts | Kaitlyn Burch | Jack Burnham | Marissa Contelmo | Julianne Farella | Brandon Fiege | Sari Friedman | Shale |Zhike Gan | Isa Karis | Joseph Kattou | Liz Leupold | Brendan Komarek | Jingdi Ma | John William Murphy | Arielle Ponder | Irene Raptopoulos | Jonathan Renino | Alejandra Salinas | Marco Venegas\n\nMFA : Sylvie Lissa Alusitz | Julia Arvay | Emily Brownawell | Xiao Chen | B Jensen Hale | Tamar Hedges | Amanda Heidel | Lynn Herring | Bora Kim | Geuryung Lee | Betsy Lewis | Ruizhi Li | Rosa Loveszy | David Munford | Megumi Naganoma | Heather Rosenbach | Jolynn Santiago |Andrew Sartorious | Sharon Strauss\n\nJust My Type: Angela Dufresne\n\nCurated by Melissa Ragona and Anastasia James\n\nFebruary 9 – July 14, 2019\n\nMorgan Anderson Gallery and Howard Greenberg Family Gallery\n\nWhat’s in a face? In Angela Dufresne’s hands, a face is sometimes stretched to its absolute limits, becoming landscape, becoming monstrous, becoming pure color. Just My Type is a study in the topology of the face, as it transforms and morphs, never standing still long enough to zero in on a fixed “type.” The typologies in her paintings are hybrid machines; they threaten “categories” that identify us by normative names or force us into vulnerable positions. Dufresne wields heterotopic narratives that are non-hierarchical and perverse and poignantly articulate, porous ways of being in a world fraught by fear, power, and possession. Known for her impressive tableaux vivants that are both grandiose and humble, Just My Type: Angela Dufresne will feature intimate and rarely exhibited portraits of the artist’s friends, family, and community, as well as phantasmagoric beings that challenge our understanding of what makes a type.\n\nIn Celebration: A Recent Gift from the Photography Collection of Marcuse Pfeifer\n\nCurated by Wayne Lempka\n\nFebruary 9 – July 14, 2019\n\nSara Bedrick Gallery\n\nThrough the generosity of former New York City gallery dealer Marcuse Pfeifer, The Dorsky Museum is the recipient of a major gift of 19th and 20thcentury photographs representing some of the leading artists in the history of the medium. This exhibition will showcase over fifty photographs from the Pfeifer gift while tracing both the evolution of the medium and celebrating the generosity of the donor.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Marcuse Pfeifer was one of the first gallery dealers in New York City to exclusively show photographs. Her gallery gained the reputation as being one of the very few spaces where one could not only view but purchase images from both well-known and up-and-coming artists. Through Pfeifer’s efforts she was instrumental in helping to promote the medium of photography as an art form.\n\nMohonk Mountain House at 150\n\nCurated by Kerry Dean Carso\n\nFebruary 9 – July 14, 2019\n\nSeminar Room\n\nTo celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of Mohonk Mountain House, this small exhibition features art, photographs, postcards, and ephemera related to Mohonk and the Shawangunks, with contributions from students in Professor Kerry Dean Carso's fall 2018 art history course, \"Art of the Hudson Valley.\"\n\nIn 1869, Alfred Smiley made his first visit to Lake Mohonk and convinced his twin brother Albert to purchase Stokes Tavern, an inn on the lake. Under the Smiley family’s management, the tavern evolved into Mohonk Mountain House, an eclectic architectural assemblage of towers, balconies, and porches. A wonderland of picturesque carriage trails dotted with rustic summerhouses allowed guests to explore the mountain and lake scenery. Today Mohonk Mountain House transports guests to the heyday of the mountain house era, while also providing modern amenities.\n\nStudents have researched and written about images from the early days of Mohonk to the recent past, exploring themes such as art and architecture, landscape design, and recreational activities.\n\nLinda Mary Montano: The Art/Life Hospital\n\nCurated by Anastasia James\n\nJanuary 23 – April 14, 2019\n\nAlice and Horace Chandler Gallery and North Gallery\n\nLinda Mary Montano (b. 1942, Saugerties, NY) is a pioneer in contemporary performance art and her work since the mid 1960s has been critical in the development of video and performance by, for, and about women. Attempting to dissolve the boundaries between art and life, Montano’s work explores her own art/life through shared experience, role adoption, and intricate life altering ceremonies, some of which last for many years. This exhibition highlights Montano’s rarely screened video work, alongside new commissions and a performance that address acts of healing and issues surrounding death."
