Musically blessed comedy "Sister Act" is getting a revival, courtesy of Disney.

Producer Ally Sherman and writers Kristen "Kiwi" Smith and Carol McCullah are set to create a new take of the original 1992 film, Disney confirmed on Tuesday.

The film is still under development and no further details were released.

"Sister Act" starred Whoopi Goldberg, Maggie Smith and Kathy Najimy in a story about a singer finding sanctuary from mobsters as a nun in a convent; the sequel also starred a young Lauryn Hill.

Sherman produced this year's hit "Cinderella." Smith and McCullah's credits include "Legally Blonde" and "She's the Man."

"Sister Act" was also made into a Tony award-winning Broadway musical.
