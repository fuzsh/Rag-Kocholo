When disco diva, Deloris Van Cartier, witnesses a murder, she is put in protective custody in the one place the cops are sure she wonâ€™t be a found: a convent! Disguised as a nun, she finds herself at odds with both the rigid lifestyle and uptight Mother Superior. Using her unique disco moves and singing talent to inspire the choir, Deloris breathes new life into the church and community but, in doing so, blows her cover. Soon, the gang is giving chase, only to find them up against Deloris and the power of her newly found sisterhood.

A sparkling tribute to the universal power of friendship, SISTER ACT is reason to REJOICE!"
