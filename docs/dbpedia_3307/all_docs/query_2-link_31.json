        "text": "Broadway World\n\nMelissa Giordano\n\nI am a longtime fan of Whoopi Goldberg with her Sister Act movies ranking as some of my all-time favorites. So, as you can imagine, I am thrilled I finally had the opportunity to see the musical adaptation that Ms. Goldberg produced on Broadway at Long Island's Gateway Theatre. This lively production runs through July 18th at the gorgeous Bellport venue.\n\nLeading the brilliant Steven Beckler directed cast is Rashidra Scott (Broadway: Beautiful - The Carole King Musical, Hair, et. al.) as Deloris Van Cartier (Ms. Goldberg's role from the movie). The tale centers on sassy Las Vegas headliner Deloris as she, under police protection, hides in a convent from her mobbed up boyfriend, Curtis, portrayed by Apollo Levine, after witnessing him murder one of his associates. Ms. Scott is absolutely dazzling as Deloris. Her voice carries the Alan Menken (music)/Glenn Slater (lyrics) score so beautifully with loads of energy to boot.\n\nIncidentally, the stage incarnation (book by Cheri & Bill Steinkellner) primarily focuses on the first of the two movies with some changes (naturally).\n\nAlso a highlight among the stellar cast is Gateway vet Tina Johnson (Broadway: Damn Yankees, South Pacific, et al.) as Sister Mary Lazarus, Dierdre Friel (Broadway: Leap Of Faith) as the perky Sister Mary Patrick and Celeste Rose as mousy postulant Sister Mary Robert. They all work incredibly well together and it is apparent they are enjoying their time in this show. Another audience favorite is Jennifer Allen (Broadway: Bridges Of Madison County, Sister Act, et. al) as Mother Superior. Her rendition of \"Haven't Got A Prayer\" is met with an extended applause.\n\nThe entire company is truly top notch.\n\nAs for the creative team, Adam Koch is on point with the beautiful scenic design particularly with the deteriorating nunnery. Additionally, Dustin Cross' costumes are exquisite and relevant and special kudos to the incredible live orchestra headed up by Musical Director Brent Alan Huffman with Nancy Blair Wolfe conducting.\n\nAnd so, Sister Act is indeed another hit for the Gateway Theatre. An incredible cast and an exciting, dramatic, story make for a thrilling night of theatre. Next up for the Gateway is an exciting production of Billy Elliot which will run at The Patchogue Theatre beginning July 22nd.\n\nSister Act is presented by the Gateway Playhouse of Bellport, Long Island, through July 18th in collaboration with Ogunquit Playhouse in Maine. Music by Alan Menken, Lyrics by Glenn Slater, Book by Cheri & Bill Steinkellner, Additional Book Material by Douglas Carter Beane, Directed by Steven Beckler, Production Management by Brian Loesch, Casting by Michael Baker, Scenic Design by Adam Koch, Comapny Management by Bethany Sortman, Lighting by Rev. Jose Santiago, Stage Management by Karen Parlato, Costume Design by Dustin Cross, Sound Design by Don Hanna, Orchestrations by Doug Besterman, Vocal & Incidental Music Arrangements by Michael Kosarin, Musical Direction by Brent Alan Huffman, Conductor is Nancy Blair Wolfe, Original Choreography by Anthony Van Laast, Choreography Recreated & Adapted by Erin Henry.\n\nNY Theatre Guide\n\nKristen Weyer\n\nWhat do you get when you combine nuns, mobsters, and soul music? Sister Act! This crazy musical is based on the hit 1992 movie of the same name starring Whoopi Goldberg. It boasts original music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Glenn Slater and a book by Cheri and Bill Steinkellner with Douglas Carter Beane. Gateway’s production also features four members of the original Broadway production: Rashidra Scott, Jennifer Allen, Blake Hammond and Musical Director Brent Alan Huffman. Sister Act is an entertaining time for the whole family, a little bit campy, and a whole lot of fun.\n\nSister Act is a “fabulous” good time.\n\nAll that nightclub singer Dolores van Cartier (Rashidra Scott) wants is to be discovered and become famous. Unfortunately, her life develops complications the night she witnesses her mobster boyfriend, Curtis (Apollo Levine), commit a murder. Now a key witness in Curtis’ trial, she is on the run with her career on hold. Policeman Eddie Souther (Dashaun Young) knows she needs to be hidden from Curtis and his goons, and he finds the perfect place: a convent! However, neither Dolores nor the Mother Superior (Jennifer Allen) are particularly happy with this arrangement. With the church in disrepair and in imminent danger of closing, Dolores brings her own special style to the choir and starts filling the pews. This brings attention for the church, but attention is exactly what Dolores should avoid.\n\nThis cast jumps wholeheartedly into the energetic musical numbers and humorous situations. Rashidra Scott and Jennifer Allen play off each-other beautifully — both displaying stunning vocals and excellent characterization. Blake Hammond is hilarious as Monsignor O’Hara, while Apollo Levine’s smooth and deep vocals bring the perfect evil chill to Curtis. Who doesn’t love bumbling mobsters? Chris Cooke, Tyler Simahk and Avionce do justice to their comedic roles as Curtis’ trio of goons. Not to fear, your three favorite nuns are also present. Crotchety old-timer Sister Mary Lazarus, bubbly Sister Mary Patrick, and quiet Sister Mary Roberts are played by Tina Johnson, Dierdre Friel, and Celeste Rose, respectively. Their amusing, quirky characters are just what you’re hoping for, and their singing talents are a pleasure to hear. The entire ensemble does a wonderful job with spot-on singing and enthusiastic dancing.\n\nAdam Koch’s set design for this production is beautiful. Stunning faux stained glass pieces, soaring archways and intricate details all combine for an impressive display. The sliding and rotating pieces bring the church to life in a brilliantly executed cloister chase scene. Sparkling costumes by Dustin Cross did not disappoint, while Musical Director Brent Alan Huffman, Conductor Nancy Blair Wolfe, and the entire orchestra produced a wonderful score. The only disappointing part of the performance was the sound issues. Any time more than one person was singing, the words became drowned out by the volume. Sadly, this caused many clever lyrics to be lost in the general shuffle.\n\nDirected by Steven Beckler, Sister Act is a “fabulous” good time.\n\nThe Long Island Advance\n\nLinda Leuzzi\n\nA Sister Act that raises the rafters.\n\nPoor Deloris.\n\nShe has a mob boss for a boyfriend who’s nixing her talent in his nightclub and, what’s more, his unsubtle present on Christmas Day is his wife’s blue fur coat. If that’s not enough to dis a girl, Deloris accidently walks in as Curtis pops off one of his henchmen. Uh oh. She’s next.\n\nThe dead man was an informant and Deloris is spirited off by the Philadelphia police to a convent and church with a bunch of nuns for safe keeping until Curtis is reeled in.\n\nThis musical, a rouser straight from Maine’s famous Ogunquit Playhouse, where its cast precluded Gateway with a three-week stint, includes Rashidra Scott as Deloris Van Cartier. “It’s a coproduction launched in Maine first,” said Scot Allan, Gateway’s director of development and public relations. “It’s a great collaboration and we do like to brag about it.”\n\nScott played on Broadway and in the tour company of “Sister Act” as well as “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” and, simply put, she owns the role.\n\nOut of her league, the only prayer Deloris admits to is a plea for a white, sequined Donna Summers gown and a white fox stole and, while it doesn’t count, Mother Superior grudgingly assigns newly designated Sister Mary Clarence — that is, Deloris — a job, pulling riveting chords out of the badly languishing nun’s choir. “Bigger! Brighter! Bolder! Better!” Deloris shouts. As they hit the chords, the dozen or so nuns start to express their faith, not only in meditation, but also in song, unlocking a glorious, reveling and run-for-cover production numbers like “Raise Your Voice.”\n\nThe throwback to 1976 and its boogie disco nights is a delicious reminder of the times when sequins and bellbottoms ruled, but also the Catholic school nuns who taught some of us and it’s fun to see Deloris’s sisters, the monsignor and the altar boys get into the dancing and the glitz. The show is based on the 1992 movie with Whoopi Goldberg and Maggie Smith; Goldberg was a producer of the 2011 Broadway musical.\n\nCurtis (Apollo Levine) is positively Machiavellian. He’s a polished villain with his Temptation dance moves and pumping arms in “When I Find My Baby.” His yes men, Joey (Chris Cooke), Pablo (Tyler Simahk) and TJ (Avionce), who fantasize about hoodwinking the nuns with their charms to get to Deloris, bring the house down.\n\nThere’s a sweetness to this tale and maybe a lesson here, and it’s the evolution of two women, Mother Superior, played by Jennifer Allen (another Broadway alum), a spiritual leader earnest in her vision for a church that’s a safe haven away from throbbing music and crime-filled streets, and Deloris, the street-wise chick whose idea of success is big record deals and a fawning audience. These two pros face off flawlessly in song, dance and dialogue along the way and eventually get, well, religion.\n\nThe sets conjure up a convincing old church in need of renovation with its Gothic wood doors and stained glass windows and the nuns’ habits, staid throughout, but sometimes regaled with glitter, are a good backdrop for Deloris, who looks great in anything she wears. But it’s the entire cast letting loose with unbridled joy that’s enough to make you shout. As in ‘Hallelujah!’\n\nDan's Papers\n\nGenevieve Horsburgh"
