        "text": "I am sure I don’t need to give Sister Act much of an introduction. The first Sister Act movie, directed by Emile Ardolino was released in 1992, when I was just 12. The film, starred Whoopi Goldberg and was an iconic feel good comedy- full of laughter, friendship and energy. It has been YEARS since I saw the film, and I was really looking forward to Sister Act the Musical UK Tour – live at the Regent Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links.

She is placed under protective custody and is hidden in the one place she shouldn’t be found – a convent of course! The story develops and Deloris is encouraged to help the struggling choir, and she helps her fellow sisters find their souls and their true voices whilst unexpectedly rediscovering her own.\n\nFeaturing original music by Tony® and 8-time Oscar® winner Alan Menken (Disney’s Aladdin, Enchanted) and songs inspired by Motown, soul and disco, this spirited musical is uplifting and feel good.\n\nSister Act the Musical Review 2023\n\nI love a visit to the Regent Theatre. I love the hustle and bustle as you arrive at the theatre for the show, and I love the music, lights, choreography and pure talent on stage every single time. Sister Act didn’t let me down. Landi Oshinowo played the part of feisty, nun on the run Delores brilliantly. Landi has an amazing stage presence and charisma, and her voice… well it is just incredible. Mother Superior is played by Lesley Joseph who has wonderful stage presence, humour, wit and energy. The musical numbers included ‘take me to heaven’ and raise your voice’ and had everyone tapping their feet and clapping to the beat.\n\nSister Act is fun and feel good, and highlights the importance of friendship, sisterhood, growth and forgiveness. It is a show full of energy and laughter with plenty of sequins and show stopping music that will bring a smile to your face.\n\nSister Act the musical Theatre Cast\n\nDelores Van Cartier – Landi Oshinowo\n\nMother Superior – Lesley Joseph\n\nEddie Souther – Alfie Parker\n\nSister Mary Robert – Lizzie Bea\n\nCurtis Jackson – Ian Gareth-Jones\n\nSister Mary Patrick – Isabel Canning\n\nSister Mary Lazarus – Jackie Pulford\n\nMonsignor 0’Hara – Philip Arran\n\nSister Mary Martin of Tours – Lori Haley Fox\n\nSister Mary Theresa – Wendy-Lee Purdy\n\nTJ – Bradley Judge\n\nPablo – Damian Buhagiar\n\nJoey – Callum Martin\n\nMichelle – Esme Laudat\n\nTina – Amber Kennedy\n\nClement – Castell Parker\n\nCop/Bartender – Joseph Connor\n\nHOW LONG IS Sister Act the musical?\n\nThe show opens at the Regent Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent on Monday 25 September – Saturday 30 September 2023, with shows Monday to Saturday at 7.30pm, and a show at 2.30 pm on Wednesday and Saturday.\n\nThe Sister Act Musical has a running time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, including an interval.\n\nWHAT AGE IS Sister Act the Musical FOR?\n\nSister Act UK Live Tour has an age guidance of 12+.\n\nWHERE IS THE REGENT THEATRE, STOKE-ON-TRENT\n\nPiccadilly\n\nStoke-on-Trent\n\nST1 1AP\n\nTel: 08448717649\n\nPARKING NEAR REGENT THEATRE, HANLEY\n\nThere are a number of car parks within easy walking distance from the theatre.
