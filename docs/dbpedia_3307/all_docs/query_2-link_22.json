        "text": "Sister Act - October 2017\n\nDirected by Brad Rondeau\n\nA musical based on the motion picture (1992).\n\nFeaturing original music by Tony- and eight-time Oscar winner, Alan Menken (Newsies, Beauty and the Beast, Little Shop of Horrors), this uplifting divine musical was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\n\nWhen glitzy diva, Deloris Van Cartier witnesses a murder, she is forced to hide out until she can be a witness at his trial. The Mother Superior at the local convent agrees, reluctantly, to take her in temporarily. Disguised as a nun, she finds herself at odds with both the rigid lifestyle and uptight Mother Superior. Using her unique disco moves and singing talent to inspire the choir, Deloris breathes new life into the church and community but, in doing so, blows her cover. Soon, the gang is giving chase, only to find them up against Deloris and the power of her newly found sisterhood. This performance is full of fun for the whole family from opening to final bows.\n\nSister Act is directed by Brad Rondeau, music director, Beth Wondolowski, assistant director Sarah Robson. Sister Act features a cast of talented actors lead by Kelly Falls (Deloris), including Lynn Wilde Concannon (Mother Superior), Rich Staton (Curtis), Gary Thames (Eddie), and a chorus of quirky nuns from all around the Livingston County area.\n\n​\n\nShow dates:\n\nFriday, Oct. 13, Saturday, Oct. 14 AND Oct 21, 2017 @ 7:30 p.m.\n\nSunday, Oct. 22, 2017 @ 2:00 p.m.\n\nTickets go on sale to the general public on Monday, August 21, 2017.
