        "text": "In a parallel universe, audiences are enjoying a Sister Act movie directed by celebrated Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar. In an interview with The New Yorker, the Oscar-winning auteur shares that he was offered the 1992 musical nun comedy starring Whoopi Goldberg after the breakthrough success of his film Women on the Verge. Years later, he was also offered Brokeback Mountain—as many fans know by now. (Ang Lee went on to helm the heartbreaking love story, which Almodóvar ultimately loved—though he says he would have added “more sex.”)\n\nSo, why did Almodóvar turn down both Brokeback and Sister Act? There were a few reasons, as he tells The New Yorker:\n\n“Maybe it’s because I didn’t trust my English,” he says. “Or maybe it’s because, even though they always tell me I’ll have artistic liberty—final cut—there is always a moment when I don’t believe it.”\n\nSister Act went on to be helmed by Emile Ardolino and was a massive box-office success, later inspiring a sequel co-starring Lauryn Hill. Though the franchise already has its place in cinematic history, isn't it tempting to sneak into that alternate universe and imagine Almodóvar's version? Playful explorations of sexuality! Gender bending! A young Penélope Cruz! On the surface, the nun movie certainly aligns with the director’s established oeuvre: it’s another female-centric story with a comedic streak, plus religious appeal. (The director went to a Catholic boarding school when he was younger, and was a devout worshiper for a period of time.) He's also made a movie about nuns before, the 1983 black comedy Dark Habits . . . though it's decidedly nothing like Sister Act.\n\nUnfortunately, the director doesn't seem particularly interested in getting into the big-budget picture game. During the interview, he recalled being asked to adapt the World War II novel Suite Française, by Irène Némirovsky. Though he found the novel “marvelous,” its expansive story line and number of characters was just too daunting. “I’m always a little reluctant to get involved in a big production,” he tells The New Yorker. “The more money there is in the budget, the more compromises you have to make with that money.”\n\nInstead, Almodóvar would rather stick with his small-budget films. Even though they have their own particular set of issues, he says, the level of independence makes all the difference: “You are owner of that difficulty. And that is of the greatest importance.”\n\nCANNES FILM FESTIVAL\n\nMeryl Streep and Pedro Almodóvar Almost Made a Movie That Would've Blown Your Mind\n\nMeryl Streep and Pedro Almodóvar Almost Made a Movie Together\n\nThe holidays\n\nWhoopi Goldberg Is Designing “Christmas Sweaters with a Twist”\n\nBut don't plan on wearing them before December 1.\n\nholy trinity\n\nCan Martin Scorsese Just Make a Movie with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio Already?\n\nPlus, the surprising film De Niro really wishes had a sequel.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Universe According to Geraldine Viswanathan\n\nAfter breaking out in Blockers, the actor has continued to shoot for the stars, soaring toward her biggest year yet with a Will Ferrell–Reese Witherspoon comedy and a new role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nTelevision\n\nWho Are the Three New Dragon Riders on House of the Dragon?\n\nOn the penultimate episode of House of the Dragon season two, Rhaenyra has enlisted the help of three new dragon riders: Addam of Hull, Hugh Hammer, and Ulf the White.
