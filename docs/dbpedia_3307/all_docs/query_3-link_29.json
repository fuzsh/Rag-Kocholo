        "text": "Sister Act fans, rejoice and sing! There's another movie starring Whoopi Goldberg in the works to make this a trilogy.\n\nDisney announced on Thursday, December 10, that Sister Act 3 is officially a go for the corporation's streaming service, Disney+. According to Deadline, Goldberg will reprise her iconic role as Deloris Van Cartier and will also serve as a producer, alongside Tyler Perry.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe original film premiered in 1992 with Goldberg as a lounge singer who has to go into witness protection at a convent in San Francisco. Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (one of the all-time great sequel names) came out the following year.\n\nNow, almost 30 years later, fans will get a chance to revisit one of their favorite characters—and they're excited. “There is going to be a sister act 3. I repeat, there is going to be a sister act 3. Teacher says take off your motherfucking robes!!!!” Benj Pasek tweeted.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“For a long time they kept saying no one wanted to see it, and then quite recently it turns out that that may not be true,” Goldberg teased back in October. “People might want to see it. So we're working diligently to figure out how to get the gang together. Listen—bad singing, great singing, okay singing, and then nuns. What's better than that?”\n\nIndeed. Here's everything we know so far about Sister Act 3.\n\nThe release date. The project was just announced, so it's too soon to tell when it will be available in theaters or streaming. It likely won't arrive until 2022.\n\nThe cast. We know Goldberg will return to the role she originated, but the rest of the cast has yet to be announced. Everyone's fingers are crossed for a return performance from Kathy Najimy as well, but we will all just have to wait and see.\n\nThe plot. While we don't have details, we're going to go out on a limb and say there will be a church and singing involved. And hijinks, of course there will be high jinks!\n\nThis post will be updated as more details about the movie are released."
