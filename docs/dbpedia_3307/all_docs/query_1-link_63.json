        "text": "The Historic Royal Theatre proudly presents the Young Players in their “divine” production of Sister Act JR. This production, made possible by our sponsorship with Everett Buick GMC, will open July 2024. The musical tells the story of Deloris Van Cartier, a high-spirited aspiring singer, who witnesses a murder and is forced to enter the Queen of Angels convent under witness protection.\n\nThough Deloris Van Cartier is forced into the convent under witness protection, she quickly finds her place in the women’s choir. While Deloris does not share the faith and modesty of her fellow nuns, her newfound community of sisters offers her friendship and fellowship, and, in turn, Deloris teaches each woman how to raise her voice in beautiful praise. The choir’s new sound proves a big draw, attracting new worshippers at church services, sorely-needed donations, and community attention.\n\nWhen:\n\nThursday, July 11th @ 7pm*\n\nFriday, July 12th @ 7pm*\n\nSaturday, July 13th @ 7pm\n\nSunday, July 14th @ 2pm\n\nThursday, July 18th @ 7pm*\n\nFriday, July 19th @ 7pm\n\nSaturday, July 20th @ 7pm\n\nSunday, July 21st @ 2pm\n\n*Understudy performances are Thursday, 7/11 for Eddie Souther (Griffin Taylor) and Monsignor (Aubrey Nelson), Friday, 7/12 Mother Superior (Cadence Earles), Eddie Souther (Griffin Taylor) and Monsignor (Aubrey Nelson) and Thursday, 7/18 Mother Superior (Cadence Earles)\n\nWhere:\n\nThe Royal Theatre, 111 S.
