        "text": "Sister Act 3: Kicking the Habit, the highly anticipated third installment of the Whoopi Goldberg-led comedy, was first announced back in 2020. Now, musician and actress Tanya Trotter has provided a positive Sister Act 3 update, confirming that filming may commence soon.\n\nTrotter, who appeared in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit as a choir member, revealed the progress behind the planned third installment of Sister Act. While details about the film remain under wraps, Trotter’s recent update provides hope for Sister Act 3 ever happening.\n\nDuring this year’s CMA Fest in Nashville, Trotter confirmed that the script for Sister Act 3 is already complete, though she has yet to confirm whether or not she’s returning for the third film. However, if Goldberg — who’s expected to return — is involved, she’d definitely “say yes” should the opportunity arise.\n\n“Well, I can’t say [whether or not I’m a part of it], but I do know that the script is done . . . Anything that Whoopi Goldberg is a part of — ’cause she’s a legend, she’s an icon, she’s my mentor, hero — yes, I would say yes,” Trotter said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.\n\nTrotter’s latest update comes after Goldberg’s May interview with ET, saying that Sister Act 3 may arrive soon.\n\n“I can say it’s coming. It’s coming around the mountain when it comes. It’ll be here soon. I’m excited. It’s time for it, you know, it’s time. Because we need to laugh, you know? I don’t know what we’re going into, but whatever it is, I’m gonna need to chuckle a lot . . . I think I’m good when I make other people laugh, too,” said Goldberg.\n\nWhat is Sister Act about?\n\nSister Act, released in 1992, follows low-rent lounge singer Deloris Van Cartier (Goldberg), who is forced to take on the identity of a nun named Sister Mary Clarence after her mobster boyfriend commits murder. Deloris then gradually turned the once-struggling convent where she was sent for her protection into a vibrant, soulful one. The film then spawned a sequel in 1993 following Deloris as she helps her new-found nun friends save an old Catholic school from ultimately closing."
