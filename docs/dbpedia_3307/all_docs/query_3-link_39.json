        "text": "It was one of the best films of the early 90s starring Whoopi Goldberg as a lounge singer from Reno.\n\nShe was put in protective custody and forced to live at a convent and pretend to be a nun to escape a mob boss. We love the cast, the songs, everything about this flick.\n\nThe movie, which was followed by Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit in 1993, was a massive hit and it's often repeated on TV, making us feel as though it came out just yesterday.\n\nWhoppi is also a producer of the 2011 Broadway adaptation.\n\nHere we revisit the cast and while you might recognise the big-haired actress, some of the stars look completely different..\n\nWhoopi Goldberg - Deloris Van Cartier/Sister Mary Clarence\n\nThe actress and comedian is a living legend and doesn't really look any different these days, apart from her hair. We want what she's having.\n\nShe's appeared in countless films over the years including Girl, Interrupted alongside Angelina Jolie, while she also voiced the character of Stretch in Toy Story 3.\n\nWhoopi now co-hosts US talk show The View and has appeared in Glee.\n\nWendy Makkena - Sister Mary Robert\n\nWe barely recognised actress Wendy, who went on to star in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Law and Order, as well as a number of films and other TV series.\n\nShe looks very glam now she's not rocking Sister Mary Robert's fringe and looks years younger than 57!\n\nMaggie Smith - Reverend Mother\n\nMost people know who Maggie is as she won an Oscar for Best Actress for her role in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and Best Supporting Actress for her role in California Suite.\n\nShe was made a Dame in 1990 and more recently starred in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, along with the sequel this year, while TV lovers may know her as Violet Crawley from Downton Abbey.\n\nKathy Najimy - Sister Mary Patrick\n\nThe actress was our favourite star in Sister Act and she's also looking very glam these days while she continues to star in films and TV shows.\n\nShe appeared in Hocus Pocus and The Wedding Planner before Veronica's Closet until 2000.\n\nMore recently she has been doing a lot of voice-over work, lending her talent to Wall-E and American Dad.\n\nHarvey Keitel - Vince LaRocca\n\nAfter starring in Sister Act Harvey went on to land parts in a number of big movies, including Pulp Fiction and The Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nFun fact for you .. he appeared in Beyonce's music video for Pretty Hurts last year as the host of a beauty pageant. Who knew?!\n\nBill Nunn - Lieutenant Eddie Souther\n\nThe actor looks nothing like his character in Sister Act and has embraced his silver hair and beard more than 20 years on.\n\nHe went on to have supporting roles in flicks such as He Got Game and Kiss the Girls and appeared in all three of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies before landing a role in the 2012 film Won't Back Down."
