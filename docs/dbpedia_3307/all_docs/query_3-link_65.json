        "text": "Oh Happy Day!\n\nAfter almost three decades Whoopi Goldberg will reprise her role as Sister Mary Clarence in Sister Act 3.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor will also produce the film alongside Tyler Perry after it was confirmed by Disney Studios Motion Picture Production boss Sean Bailey.\n\nThe movie is already in development and will be released on DisneyPlus.\n\nGoldberg debuted in 1992 as Deloris Van Cartier, a singer in an adult club, who viewers came to know as Sister Mary Clarence — the singing nun.\n\nThe film was a box office success and became one of the top 10 grossing films that year.\n\nThe sequel Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit was released the following year and also starred Goldberg and Maggie Smith — who returned as the Reverend Mother.\n\nThe film marks the fourth collaboration between Perry and Goldberg who most recently worked on 2018’s Nobody’s Fool.\n\nIn 2018 it was revealed that Karin Gist who was executive producer of Revenge, Grey’s Anatomy and One Tree Hill and State of Georgia producer Regina Hicks were working on a script for a new Sister Act.\n\nThe films are also renowned for their soundtracks with songs like Rescue Me, My Guy, Ain’t No Mountain High Enough and Oh Happy Day featuring on the first two.\n\nThe new film comes as Disney announced a massive list of new movies and TV shows to ruffle their competitors feathers.\n\nChief executive at Disney Bob Chapek revealed the company would be unleashing 63 series and 42 films, many of which would be heading to its flagship streaming service Disney + including 10 new Star Wars projects, several Marvel spin-offs, remakes of classic films and much-awaited sequels.\n\nDisney+ launched just over a year ago and the streaming service has already amassed 86.8 million subscribers around the globe, picking up 12 million of those in just the past month."
