        "text": "Almost 20 years after Sister Act was released in the US, a nun who claims her autobiography was the inspiration for the film has launched a lawsuit against Disney and Sony Pictures, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nQueen Mother Dr Delois Blakely, a veteran campaigner who recently made headlines when she recruited activists from Occupy Wall Street to protest against the lack of maintenance in her Harlem apartment block in New York, will represent herself in the case. Her allegations include breach of contract, misappropriation of likeness, unjust enrichment and other claims.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Blakely was a \"young, black, singing nun serving the street people and youths of Harlem\", who published the autobiography The Harlem Street Nun in 1987.\n\nLater that year, she approached Tri-Star Pictures producer Cynthia Bowles, among other Hollywood figures, with a three-page synopsis. Bowles apparently sent her a letter in reply, expressing interest in the film rights.\n\nLater, according to the claims, producer Scott Rudin took a Sister Act project from Tri-Star to Disney. This became the film starring Whoopi Goldberg as Delois van Cartier, a worldly singer who, after witnessing a mob crime, goes undercover in a convent presided over by Maggie Smith. It made more than $230m at the box office, and spawned a sequel and a stage musical. The studios have declined to comment.\n\nBlakely's suit lays out the apparent similarities, and the plaintiff is now demanding an injunction against further violation of her publicity rights and equitable relief."
