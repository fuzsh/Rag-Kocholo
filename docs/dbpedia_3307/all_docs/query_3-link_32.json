        "text": "Whoopi Goldberg may be “back in the habit\" soon in “Sister Act 3.”\n\nGoldberg, 64, talked about her efforts to make the movie a reality on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.\"\n\nThe EGOT winner (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony), who lives in the Llewellyn Park section of West Orange, was responding to Corden asking why “Sister Act 3” hadn’t happened yet.\n\n“Because for a long time, they kept saying no one wanted to see it,” Goldberg said. “And then quite recently it turns out that that may not be true. People might want to see it, so we’re working diligently to try to figure out how to get the gang together and come back.”\n\nIn the first “Sister Act\" movie, released in 1992, Goldberg played Deloris Van Cartier, a lounge singer in Reno, Nevada who witnesses a murder and goes undercover in witness protection at a convent as Sister Mary Clarence. In the process, she injects a much-needed boost of energy into the lackluster church choir. In “Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit” (1993), she becomes Mary Clarence again to help mentor high school students including one played by New Jersey’s own Lauryn Hill.\n\nGoldberg summed up the “Sister Act” dynamic for Corden: “Bad singing, great singing, OK singing and then nuns ... what’s better than that?”\n\nWhen NJ Advance Media spoke to Goldberg last year, she was set to reprise her “Sister Act” role in a reworked musical adaptation of the film for a month-long run of shows on London’s West End, starting in July. (The first “Sister Act” musical debuted in 2006.) The performances were canceled due to COVID-19 and rescheduled for July and August 2021.\n\nOver the last few years, there’s been chatter about a “Sister Act” film in the works at Disney Plus, but Goldberg was reportedly not attached to star, though in 2017 she did float the idea of directing the movie. At the time, she said she wanted to pass the torch on to another actress who could play Sister Mary Clarence.\n\nGoldberg plays a 108-year-old woman who has visions in the upcoming limited series “The Stand,\" a post-apocalyptic drama based on the 1978 Stephen King novel premiering on CBS All Access Dec. 17.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
