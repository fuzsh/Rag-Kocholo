        "text": "From February 3 to February 18, Slow Burn Theatre Company is bringing the hit musical comedy, Sister Act, to the Amaturo Theater at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts. This feel-good show is based on the 1992 film and revolves around Deloris Van Cartier, a disco singer who witnesses a crime and finds herself in protective custody in an unexpected place – a convent. Initially, it appears as if she’s in a difficult situation, but as Deloris befriends the nuns, the convent experiences a shake-up. The musical’s captivating score, composed by Tony and Oscar winner Alan Menken with lyrics by Glenn Slater, is a heavenly mix of Motown, soul, and disco. Slow Burn Theatre Company’s production of Sister Act is made possible through a special arrangement with Music Theatre International. The Broward County Cultural Division, Cultural Council, and Broward County Board of County Commissioners, along with support from the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Arts and Culture, and the Florida Council on Arts and Culture, have played a significant role in backing Slow Burn Theatre Company. Tickets for Sister Act start at $54.00. For additional details on the show, tickets, and schedule, you can visit browardcenter.org."
