To escape the mob, a nightclub singer hides in a convent. While there, she helps her new sisters to discover their powerful voices while she finds her own. This uplifting, Tony-nominated musical features original music by Alan Menken (Newsies, Beauty and the Beast, Little Shop of Horrors). It is directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun (Broadway: Newsies, Ford’s: Violet, The Civil War, Freedom’s Song, Shenandoah). Awa Sal Secka as Deloris Van Cartier leads a powerhouse cast of D.C. favorite actors."
