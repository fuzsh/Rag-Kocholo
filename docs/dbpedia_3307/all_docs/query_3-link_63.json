        "text": "\"If you want to be somebody, if you want to go somewhere, you better wake up and pay attention.\"\n\nIYKYK, right???\n\nOne woman who knows better than most is veteran actor and TV personality, Whoopi Goldberg, who played the woman who famously uttered those words — Sister Mary Clarence, also known as Deloris Van Cartier — in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.\n\nThe cult classic was first released back in 1993. Yep, more than 30 years ago.\n\nAnd this week, the cast of the much-loved movie reunited during an emotional episode of Goldberg’s talk show, The View.\n\nFans of the iconic '90s movie would have been hard-pressed to hold back tears during the cast’s recreation of the 'Joyful, Joyful' choir scene at the end of the film, especially as Goldberg appeared as Sister Clarence, nun’s outfit and all.\n\nHill famously played the film's protagonist Rita, an immensely talented singer who struggled to gain her mother's approval to join the school choir and pursue her passion.\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt was also missing from the reunion, but she played a lesser-known character (if you didn't notice her in this movie, you're forgiven). And of course, there's Mother Superior herself, Dame Maggie Smith, who also did not attend but the 89-year-old is probably rather busy in the UK.\n\nBut aside from a few no-shows (rude!), the gang was all here!\n\nRyan Toby, who played Ahmal, performed with Goldberg’s daughter, with the stars joined by students from the LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts.\n\nAnd yes, Toby (aka Ahmal) even blessed us with a rendition of 'Oh Happy Day' like he was back in 1993. I'm not crying, you are.\n\nIn the sequel, Deloris Van Cartier has become a famous Vegas singer, having posed as a nun to hide from the mob in the first film. She becomes reunited with her friends from the convent who need help saving their school by working with some promising students to start a choir.\n\nIt's a God-tier movie. Unlike most sequels, many consider Sister Act 2 to be superior to the original.\n\nWe reckon now — more than ever — is the perfect time for a cheeky rewatch.\n\nFeature image: Touchstone Pictures/Instagram/@theviewabc.\n\nLove watching TV and movies?
