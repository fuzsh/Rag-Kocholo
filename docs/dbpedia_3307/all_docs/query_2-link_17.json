        "text": "Description\n\nA feel-good comedy smash based on the 1992 film that has audiences jumping to their feet and saying “Hallelujah!” Featuring original music by Tony and Oscar winner, Alan Menken, and nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Sister Act finds flashy disco diva Deloris Van Cartier, who witnessed a murder, in protective custody disguised as a nun in a convent. Struggling to fit in, and at odds with an uptight Mother Superior, Deloris uses her street smarts, dance moves and singing talent to inspire the convent’s choir and breathe new life into the church and community. Eventually, the bad guys give chase, only to find themselves up against the power of her newly found sisterhood. Filled with gospel music, inspired choreography and a moving story about finding your voice, Sister Act is a dazzling reason to REJOICE! Directed by David Smith."
