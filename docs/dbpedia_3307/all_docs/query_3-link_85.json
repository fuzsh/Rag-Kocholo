        "text": "In 1992, Buena Vista Pictures — now Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures — released its newest film, which starred Whoopi Goldberg in an unexpected role — as a nun. Now, she was not just any nun.\n\nDeloris Van Cartier (Goldberg) was a Las Vegas singer who was posing as a nun because she was in the witness protection program. Deloris’s love for the music and outgoing personality help her turn around the choir at the convent she is hiding in.\n\nOf course, things don’t go smoothly, and Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) doesn’t like Deloris, her sass, or the effect she is having on the nuns. However, in the end, even Mother Superior must admit that Deloris changed things for the better, making the nuns so popular that even the Pope stops by!\n\nOne year later, Goldberg returned as Deloris Van Cartier in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. This time, the nuns from the convent head to Las Vegas to seek Deloris out. They are teaching at an inner city San Francisco school and need Deloris’ help to stop it from closing.\n\nThere, Deloris realizes that the student choir has immense talent, and they can use that to win a national competition and bring the school the attention and money it deserves.\n\nIt’s been just over 30 years since Goldberg last donned a robe and veil, but she decided to shock and delight the audience on her talk show, The View, with a choir reunion!\n\nTo celebrate 30 years of Back in the Habit, Goldberg was joined on stage by cast members Sheryl Lee Ralph, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, Ryan Toby, Tanya Trotter (neé Blout), David Kater, Monica Calhoun, Dionna Nichelle, Alex Martin, Frank Odell Howard, Jermaine Montell, DeeDee Magno Hall, Ashley Thompson, and Deondray Gossfield. Marc Shaiman and Mervyn Warren, the movie’s original composers, were also there.\n\nRelated: ABC Star Bashes Millennials and Gen-Z\n\nFans of Sister Act 2 will know that “Oh Happy Day” is not the only memorable musical number in the film. At the end of the movie, the choir also performs the religious song “Joyful Joyful”. For this notable moment, the cast returned to the stage and brought out students from LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts.\n\nSister Act 3 Is In the Works!\n\nYou may be excited to learn that Sister Act 2 was not the end for Deloris Van Cartier and her band of devoted nuns. While many of the original actresses have passed away, there are still a few key members of the cast who are excited to return for Sister Act 3!\n\nThe third installment in the beloved franchise was confirmed back in 2022, and we know that progress is still being made on the film. In October 2022, Goldberg confirmed that there was a script in the works and that she would be back. We can also confirm that Hocus Pocus star Kathy Najimy will be back as Sister Mary Patrick and Wendy Makkena will return as Sister Mary Robert.\n\nAccording to IMDb, Keke Palmer and Jenifer Lewis will also be in the new movie, but we do not know what roles they will play. Disney fans will recognize Jenifer Lewis as the voice of Mama Odie in the hit 2009 animated film, The Princess and the Frog.\n\nGoldberg has also asked several other people to be in the movie. In the sequel, Sheryl Lee Ralph played the mother of Lauryn Hill’s character. Ralph returned for The View’s reunion, and was also asked to come back for the third film. Goldberg said that she also reached out to Maggie Smith, who played Mother Superior in the first two films.\n\nRelated: Controversial Disney Star Blasts “Anti-White” Comments\n\nGoldberg has also reached out to Pope Francis (probably a reach), Jimmy Fallon, Daisy Ridley, Nicki Minaj, and Lizzo.\n\nWe know that Tyler Perry is signed on to produce Sister Act 3, and it is being written by Karin Gist, Regina Hicks, and Madhuri Shekar. We do not yet have a premiere date, but Disney has said that it will premiere on Disney+ when it is finally released."
