Featuring original music by Tony- and eight-time Oscar winner, Alan Menken (Newsies, Beauty and the Beast, Little Shop of Horrors), this uplifting musical was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\n\nWhen disco diva, Deloris Van Cartier, witnesses a murder, she is put in protective custody in the one place the cops are sure she won't be a found: a convent!

When forced to hide in the convent, she initially refuses to embrace her new lifestyle but learns to embrace it when she works with the choir. Loud-mouthed, and sassy, but ultimately caring.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 25 to 35 | Vocal range: E3-F#5\n\nMother Superior\n\nThe head of the convent, sarcastic and a bit stiff. Extremely protective about keeping her sisters away from the outside world, which puts her in direct opposition to Deloris and her musical teachings.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 50 to 70 | Vocal range: D3-E5\n\nSister Mary Robert\n\nA postulant, abandoned as a baby and raised at the convent. Shy and soft-spoken, but singing with Deloris lets her find her voice. Her wallflower lifestyle has made her live a shell of a life.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 16 to 25 | Vocal range: F#3-A5\n\nSister Mary Patrick\n\nA nun of the convent. Consistently perky, enthusiastic, and easily excitable.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 35 to 50\n\nSister Mary Lazarus\n\nA nun of the convent and the head of the choir. Rather deadpan and the least welcoming of any of the nuns, but she gets caught up in Deloris's soul music.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 50 to 70 | Vocal range: F3-B4\n\nMonsignor O'hara\n\nOne of the heads of the convent. Constantly concerned with financial matters, though soul music surprisingly puts him in a different mood.\n\nGender: Male | Age: 45 to 60 | Vocal range: E3-G4\n\nCurtis\n\nA club owner, notorious gangster, and Deloris's boyfriend. Cocky and controlling, always on the verge of violence.\n\nGender: Male | Age: 30 to 40 | Vocal range: A2-Ab4\n\nEddie Souther\n\nThe desk chief at the Philadelphia police station and a high school classmate of Deloris who helps get her into hiding. Faces a lot of nerves when under pressure, causing him to sweat profusely. He still yearns for Deloris after all these years, and dreams of being her hero.\n\nGender: Male | Age: 25 to 35 | Vocal range: Ab2-B4\n\nTJ\n\nCurtis's nephew and one of his thugs. Deft and cognizant of the fact, constantly in a state of ignorant bliss.\n\nGender: Male | Age: 16 to 30 | Vocal range: Db3-Eb5\n\nJoey\n\nOne of Curtis's thugs. Believes himself to be quite the ladies' man.\n\nGender: Male | Age: 30 to 40 | Vocal range top: Bb2-Eb5\n\nPablo\n\nOne of Curtis's thugs. A natural follower, constantly speaks in Spanish.\n\nGender: Male | Age: 25 to 40 |Vocal range: C4-F5\n\nSister Mary Martin-of-tours\n\nA nun of the convent. Clearly in her own world, but has her moments of surprising clarity.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 40 to 60\n\nSister Mary Theresa\n\nA nun of the convent, the oldest of the group. Decrepit at a glance, but secretly packs a punch.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 60 to 70\n\nMichelle\n\nOne of Deloris's back-up singers. Lippy and always quick with a retort.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 20 to 30 | Vocal range: Bb3-F5\n\nTina\n\nOne of Deloris's back-up singers. A little thick and naive.\n\nGender: Female | Age: 20 to 30 | Vocal range top: Ab3-F5\n\nErnie\n\nOne of Curtis's thugs. Initially thought to be a mindless yes-man, he turns out to be an undercover police informant.\n\nGender: Male | Age: 25 to 35\n\nEnsemble\n\nNuns; Bar Denizens (Bar Patron, Waitress, Pool Player, Drag Queen); Homeless People; Fantasy Dancers\n\nAUDITION INFORMATION\n\nAUDITION DATE: Video submissions due by June 24, 2024.
