        "text": "30 years ago, the comedy Sister Act was released to rave reviews. Starring Whoopi Goldberg as Deloris Van Cartier (and Sister Mary Clarence), the film provided dozens of laughs and powerful musical performances from its diverse cast.\n\nThe movie begins with a young Cartier at her Catholic school being a class clown before cutting to her as an adult, performing as a lounge singer in Nevada. After witnessing her boyfriend kill a police informant, Cartier is then placed in witness protection as a nun in Saint Katherine’s Convent in California, setting in place a hilarious series of events, and making for one of the best films of 1992.\n\nAlongside Goldberg in the starring role, the cast of Sister Act includes Bill Nunn, Jenifer Lewis, A.J. Johnson, Maggie Smith, Harvey Keitel, Mary Wilkes, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, and Joseph Maher. Directed by Emile Ardolino and written by Paul Rudnick, the movie was a box office success, and was also recognized for several awards, including Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\n3 decades after its release, Sister Act still remains one of the funniest comedies of all time. In celebration of its 30th Anniversary, here is a look at its cast – then and now."
