        "text": "After a year long global search, 24 year-old US actress Patina Miller has been cast to make her West End debut playing the lead role of ‘Deloris Van Cartier’ in the divine new musical comedy “SISTER ACT”. Born and raised in South Carolina, Patina’s previous credits include the critically acclaimed 2008 production of Hair in New York. The role of Deloris in “SISTER ACT” was made famous by Whoopi Goldberg in the movie of the same name, and Goldberg is a co-producer of the stage version.\n\nStarring alongside Patina will be Sheila Hancock as ‘Mother Superior’. To many, a national treasure and a multi-BAFTA nominee, Sheila’s career spans theatre, television, radio and film and she won a 2007 Olivier Award for her performance in Cabaret. Dad’s Army and EastEnders actor Ian Lavender also stars as ‘Monsignor Howard’. “SISTER ACT” opens at the London Palladium on 2 June, following previews from 7 May.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg says:\n\n“I am proud to announce that we’ve finally found you an amazing girl to play Deloris. It wasn’t easy, but we did it. And boy, can she sing (unlike some people we know – me!). And in order to match her, we went for the best and we got the brilliant… Sheila Hancock is our Mother Superior, a legend and not just in my mind. I think together they will reinvent SISTER ACT and bring it to a whole new level…can you tell I’m excited?”\n\nAlso starring in “SISTER ACT” will be Chris Jarman as ‘Shank’, Ako Mitchell as ‘Eddie’, Katie Rowley Jones as ‘Sister Mary Robert’, Claire Greenway as ‘Sister Mary Patrick’ and Julia Sutton as ‘Sister Mary Lazarus’, Thomas Goodridge as ‘TJ’, Nicolas Colicos as ‘Bones’ and Ivan De Freitas as ‘Dinero’.

The book is by the award-winning team Cheri and Bill Steinkellner, whose writing credits include the classic television comedy Cheers, and the production is directed by Peter Schneider.\n\n“SISTER ACT”has musical supervision by Michael Kosarin, choreography by Anthony Van Laast, set design by Klara Zieglerova, costume design by Lez Brotherston, sound design by Mick Potter, lighting design by Natasha Katz and musical direction by Nicholas Skilbeck.\n\n“SISTER ACT” is produced in London by Whoopi Goldberg and Stage Entertainment, producers of Hairspray, Strictly Come Dancing The Live Tour!, High School Musical and Saturday Night Fever.\n\nBOOK SISTER ACT HERE\n\nSister Act\n\nDominion Theatre, London\n\nOffer: Save up to 50%\n\nBook tickets\n\n📷 Main photo: After a year long global search, 24 year-old US actress Patina Miller has been cast to make her West End debut playing the lead role of Deloris Van Cartier in the divine new musical comedy SISTER ACT\n\nRelated News\n\nMore >"
