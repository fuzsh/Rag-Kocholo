        "text": "The film is now in the production stage\n\nIt's been 30 years since Sister Act first came out in 1992, and we didn't have to wait long for the film's sequel which came out the following year. However, there is finally another sequel in the works, and the director has now shared details about how the film is progressing.\n\nRumours about another film joining the comedy movie series were circulating for a long time before Disney broke the news in December 2020. Tim Federle, the upcoming film's director, has now given an update on the film and revealed that it is finally under active production.\n\nIt was confirmed that Tim would be directing the film back in October, and he has shared that he hopes to start filming this year. Speaking to Collider, he said: \"I hope we are (filming this year). I think the Sister Act franchise is a big priority to the studio. Script's coming along and I think Whoopi is really excited.\n\n\"Now it's just about schedules and chips falling where they may. Scheduling is literally everything. It's literally like the availability of a convent and the availability of an EGOT!\"\n\nHe also commented that he is a \"Sister Act superfan\" so it seems like the film is in safe hands!\n\nTim reflected on taking on this new project, saying: \"The opportunity to sort of take a franchise like Sister Act, it's a complete honour and my dream is to get nuns singing all across the world.\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg will return in the sequel to reprise her role as Deloris Van Cartier, and will also be producing the film alongside Tyler Perry and Tom Leonardis. We can't wait to see what her character gets up to next!\n\nCheck out these amazing Disney live-action remakes:\n\nThe news of the third Sister Act film was announced by Disney at the end of 2020, along with news of several other films they had on the way including an Enchanted sequel, a film about Buzz Lightyear, Hocus Pocus 2, and a modern-take on Three Men and a Baby.\n\nA release date for Sister Act 3 hasn't been announced yet, but it will premiere on Disney +.
