        "text": "The US Oscar-winning actress, 68, who plays lounge singer Deloris Van Cartier in the series, said work on the script was ongoing.\n\nIt was first announced there would be a third Sister Act film in 2020, with director Tyler Perry on board.\n\nAsked for an update, she told People magazine: “It’s still on the way! It’s percolating.\n\n“They have not said, ‘We’re over you and this movie’,” apparently referring to studio executives.\n\nShe added: “We’re still in the process of writing the script.”\n\nAsked if she had a hand in that aspect, she replied: “Yes and no. It’s hard to do everything. And I like to think that I can, but I’ve come to the understanding that I can’t do as much stuff simultaneously as I’d like to.”\n\nThe first Sister Act film was released in 1992 and stars Goldberg as the singer who goes into witness protection after seeing a murder committed by her gangster lover.\n\nShe hides out posing as a nun in a California convent, taking the name of Sister Mary Clarence.\n\nIt also starred Dame Maggie Smith and Harvey Keitel.\n\nThe sequel Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit was released in 1993, with Lauryn Hill, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Alanna Ubach joining the cast.\n\nThere has since been a successful stage production of Sister Act, with Beverley Knight currently in the starring role in the West End.\n\nGoldberg had a run in the show at the London Palladium, taking on the role of Mother Superior."
