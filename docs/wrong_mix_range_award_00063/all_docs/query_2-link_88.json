        "text": "T\n\nspan class=\"inline inline-center\">\n\nMore than 1,000 Swiss people, including Swiss diplomats, living in Indonesia are celebrating today, Tuesday, their National Day. Indonesia and Switzerland as close friends are celebrating their 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations this year.\n\nSwitzerland is a small, mountainous country in Central Europe with not many natural resources and no access to the sea. Today, based on data from www.worldometers.info, the land-locked country has only 8.46 million people (latest data), including 2 million foreigners, or just 0.11 percent of the world population of 7.5 billion, ranking them 97th biggest in the world by population.\n\nWith just 41,285 square kilometers of total area, Switzerland is the 135th biggest country in the world by area.\n\nIndonesia may be big in area and population compared to Switzerland, but the tiny Alps nation outclasses giant Indonesia in nearly every field in terms of achievements. Indeed, Switzerland punches above its own weight.\n\nBased on data from the World Bank, the Swiss economy is the world’s 19th biggest economy with US$659.82 billion GDP while Indonesia’s economy is the 16th biggest with a GDP of $932.25 billion. Switzerland is not a G20 country, but its economy is much bigger than existing member South Africa, whose economy is 38th biggest with a GDP of $294.84 billion.\n\nSwitzerland, a peaceful and prosperous nation, has one of the lowest unemployment rates (3.3 percent), a highly skilled workforce and the second highest per capita GDP in the world – in 2016 it was $78,812, just below Luxembourg at $102,831.\n\nAround 1,150 Swiss nationals live in Indonesia. According to Swiss Ambassador to Indonesia Yvonne Baumann, there are 150 Swiss companies, including global giants like Nestlé, Novartis, Zurich, Syngenta and Hoffmann-La Roche, operating in Indonesia. They provided 21,000 jobs directly.\n\nWith almost $3 billion in bilateral trade with Indonesia, Swiss companies provide hundreds of thousands of jobs indirectly to Indonesian youths.\n\nWith a record $303 billion in exports in 2016, Switzerland is the world’s 15th largest export economy. Indonesia’s exports, meanwhile, stood at $145.18 billion in the same year. People may wonder how a small country with few resources and few people produce products in large quantities, exporting all over the world.\n\nEvery year Switzerland exports around $100 billion in gems, precious metals and jewelry. Its second biggest export sector is medicine, which stood at $67.1 billion last year. Other exports include $19.7 billion in clocks and watches, $19.3 billion in organic chemicals, $15.4 billion in optics and medical equipment and around $900 million in chocolate.\n\nSwitzerland’s biggest service sector, banking, manages $2.7 trillion. Its biggest bank, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), which was established in 1862, is the 27th biggest bank in the world with a market capitalization of $941 billion. It means the UBS market capitalization value is much bigger than Indonesia’s 2016 GDP of $932.25 billion.\n\nAnother bank, Credit Suisse, which has a market capitalization of $909 billion, is the 29th biggest bank in the world."
