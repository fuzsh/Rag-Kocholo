        "text": "Thrilled to announce that starting in March of 2022, I’ll be coaching a new writing group organized by the Junges Literaturlabor Zürich (JULL), a literacy foundation supported by the city of Zürich and, in this particular case, by the foundation of Nobel Prize-winning Swiss Poet Carl Spitteler. (Hence the writing group’s lovely name Extramundana, which is the title of one of Spitteler’s poems, and which means ‘beyond the physical realm’, though it also looks a bit like ‘very extremely mundane’. Tricky. I like it.)\n\nThe writing group will meet regularly in Zürich, in JULL’s lovely 17th century headquarters in the downtown area. It will be a place where writers can get feedback from each other and from the coaches, or just write and brainstorm in a creative and supportive environment. I’ll be joining fellow Swiss authors and all-around lovely people, Jyoti Guptara and Bettina Bellmont.\n\nSo! If you are a fantasy writer between the ages 16-30, and are looking to find like-minded folk, while also honing your craft and learning some tricks of the trade from writers who have been doing this for a long time, you can sign up by following the directions on JULL’s flyer below."
