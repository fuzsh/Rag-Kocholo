        "text": "Conclusion\n\nWhat, then, is the continuing importance of Thomas Mann to the world republic of letters? Before turning to this question, it is worthwhile to briefly reflect on the place he has occupied in literary history over the past seventy-five years, a period during which his former representative status in the United States was all but forgotten.\n\nUndoubtedly the most important event of this period took place in August 1975, when a small group of lawyers and literary critics assembled in Zurich to break the seals on four parcels wrapped in plain brown packing paper, on which Mann had written, “Daily notes from 1933–1951. Without any literary value, but not to be opened by anybody before 20 years after my death.”1 Mann’s diaries revealed his identity as a gay man to the wider world for the first time, and set in motion an inexorable process by which his private life ever more completely came to overshadow his public persona. Henceforth, both Mann’s representative strivings and his fictions would, with increasing frequency, be read as elaborately constructed masks the author had put on to redirect the intense pain caused by his repressed personal longings.2\n\nTwo seminal documents of US intellectual culture that were both published in 1987 document the long-range effects of this shift from the public to the private. The first of these is Allan Bloom’s The Closing of the American Mind, which in a characteristically polemical passage trots out Mann’s Death in Venice as an illustration of the dynamics that have led to the supposed decline of the public sphere in the United States. Death in Venice, Bloom readily acknowledges, is a complex work in which Mann dramatizes central problems of post-Nietzschean and post-Freudian thought. But none of this matters, because “this is not how it was received by Americans. They were titillated and really took to it as an early manifesto of the sexual-liberation movement.”3 Influenced by accounts of Mann’s own tragically repressed sexual longings, so Bloom suggests, readers on America’s college campuses adopted his protagonist Aschenbach as a hero, who in death finally discovers the erotic fulfillment that eluded him throughout all his civilizational labors. Making no mention of Mann’s valiant attempts to fortify the American public for the fight against fascism, Bloom instead indicts him for having contributed to the destruction of American liberal democracy by promoting an undue emphasis on personal wish fulfillment.\n\nThe second document charting this shift in Mann’s reception, also published in 1987, was “Pilgrimage,” an autobiographical essay by Susan Sontag that appeared in the New Yorker.4 Sontag had been arguably the last major American intellectual to meet Thomas Mann personally, when she visited him in his house in Pacific Palisades in December 1949 as a sixteen-year-old undergraduate at the University of Chicago. To put her unassuming essay in the company of The Closing of the American Mind may seem like a bit of a stretch, but “Pilgrimage” is perhaps best approached as the capstone in an aesthetic project that Sontag had been pursuing for the preceding twenty-five years, and with which she fundamentally altered literary culture in the United States. Back in 1964, Sontag had published her groundbreaking essay “Against Interpretation,” in which she decisively broke with the mid-century tendency to treat literary fiction as a form of intellectual argument by other means, and famously proposed that “in place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.”5 And ten years later, she wrote Illness as Metaphor, in which she warned against the dangers of treating diseases as metaphors of moral ailments. Though the book was inspired by her own struggle with cancer, it acquired a kind of manifesto-like quality during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.\n\nSontag had been a great admirer of Thomas Mann since her early youth, and the literary critic Kai Sina has recently documented what a long shadow the German author cast over her intellectual development.6 And yet the public reputation that Mann enjoyed in America during the early 1940s, when Sontag first discovered him, can hardly have been compatible with her later aesthetic trajectory. More than perhaps any other writer, Mann had been treated as the author of “intellectual” books that posed hermeneutical riddles to their readers. And more than perhaps any other novel, his Magic Mountain epitomized the literary tendency to treat illness as a metaphor. “Pilgrimage” can thus be seen as an attempt to rewrite Sontag’s relationship with her intellectual forebear. As Sina shows, Sontag introduced factual errors to her account—errors that must have been intentional, because she had never committed them in earlier attempts to tell the same story and also still possessed her notebooks from 1949. Most importantly, she predates her encounter with Mann to 1947, describing herself as a high-school student rather than an undergraduate. She also neglects to mention that her excursion to Pacific Palisades was preceded by a careful study of Clifton Fadiman’s 1943 primer Reading I’ve Liked, which contains several Thomas Mann passages.\n\nThe collective effect of these changes is to detach Mann from the cultural networks that had actually conditioned his reception during the 1940s, and of which both Clifton Fadiman and the Great Books course that Robert M. Hutchins had started at the University of Chicago were important exemplars. Instead, Sontag’s “pilgrimage” to Pacific Palisades is framed as a kind of spiritual quest, an intimate encounter over tea between a star-struck American intellectual and her world-weary European idol. Once again, the personal vanquishes the public and the political.\n\nBloom’s and Sontag’s interventions, diverse as they may otherwise be, at least have the common merit that they are serious attempts to examine the meaning of Mann’s literary legacy for contemporary thought. The last thirty years have arguably produced no such sustained interventions. Instead, they have given rise to a veritable cottage industry of biographical studies focused on the author and his family, many of them premised on the notion that the personal tribulations suffered by the Mann family are of greater interest than anything that Mann himself or his children ever wrote. In Germany there are now over twenty such works in print. There has also been a highly successful popular television series, the title of which, The Manns: The Novel of a Century, testifies to the way in which life has eclipsed art. In America, meanwhile, the past twenty-five years have brought four full-length biographies of Thomas Mann: not a bad harvest at a time when other prominent German authors would be lucky to receive even one.7\n\nThe times may well be changing, however. Amid rising currents of authoritarian populism, xenophobic nationalism, and transatlantic insecurity, Thomas Mann’s public attempts to position himself in opposition to fascism are interesting again. In a recent editorial in the New York Times, for example, David Brooks extols the author of “The Coming Victory of Democracy” as exactly the kind of intellectual our present era needs. Putting a new spin on the old tale about Mann’s ostensible struggles to channel his repressed energies into a more productive direction, Brooks writes, “Mann’s great contribution is to remind us that democracy is not just about politics; it’s about the individual’s daily struggle to be better and nobler and to resist the cheap and the superficial.”8\n\nThe political battles of the twenty-first century are unlikely to be won with the rhetoric of the twentieth, however. More importantly, it is possible to advance far more sophisticated arguments about the continuing relevance of Thomas Mann to the intellectual culture of our own day. The parameters that conditioned Mann’s rise to the status of literary celebrity and antifascist icon in the United States of the 1930s and 1940s foreshadow developments in the world republic of letters that did not fully come to fruition until after the Second World War, and that continue to affect global literary production in the twenty-first century. In many respects, Thomas Mann was a forerunner for experiences that have become commonplace for writers in our own day, especially those that hail from the periphery of the global literary community. There are at least six different ways in which this is true.\n\nNational Representation\n\nFirst, Thomas Mann instinctively grasped that writers in a globally interconnected world would inevitably come to be marketed as representatives of national literary traditions. At the same time, he realized that such branding always carries the danger of reducing authors to the status of mere mouthpieces for more powerful forces within their home countries, especially national governments. The contemporary world republic of letters remains full of examples in which authors are essentially fêted as delegates of their nations, much like Mann was in America. We see this at the Frankfurt Book Fair, for example, which shines a spotlight on a different country every year. (The 2018 fair, which is about to open as I am writing these lines, features the Republic of Georgia as a guest of honor, and amid receptions showcasing Georgian wine and culinary delicacies, visitors will be invited to discover authors such as Aka Morchiladze or Naira Gelaschwili.) Or we see it in the ongoing fracas surrounding the Booker Prize, and the question whether it should be open to any English-language novel or only those written by citizens of a specific set of nations. Perhaps the best illustration of this dynamic, however, is provided by the world’s oldest truly global literary prize, the Nobel.\n\nThe annals of the Swedish Academy, which has been awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature since 1901, are full of anxious reflections upon the issue of national representation. In 1913, for example, academy member Verner von Heidenstam compared the Nobel Committee to “a kind of foreign office” that had allowed the prize to be shared out “country by country.”9 And the following year, amid ever more ominous portents of the war to come, an internal academy report recommended that the Nobel might become “a restraining and counterbalancing influence on the excesses” of nationalism, if only it were awarded properly—for instance by honoring minor nations so as not to further inflate the blustering of the major European powers.10 (The 1914 prize consequently went to the Swiss author Carl Spitteler.)\n\nIn the century that has passed since then, the Nobel has often been compared to the Olympics, or to similar kinds of sporting competition in which athletes compete for their countries. The paradoxes and tensions implicit in this equation are most visible in the case of the two prizes that have been awarded to authors from the People’s Republic of China, a country that has striven more than perhaps any other to win recognition in the eyes of the global literary community. As the scholar and translator Julia Lovell has documented, China has engaged in an active quest to win the Nobel Prize in Literature since at least the 1980s, a phenomenon that has even been given its own name—the “Nobel complex” (Nuobeier qingjie).11 Government measures to redress the situation encompass both lobbying efforts and state patronage programs, and were crowned with an ambiguous sort of success in 2000, when the prize was awarded to Gao Xingjian. I say “ambiguous” because from the perspective of the Chinese government this was an unacceptable outcome, since Gao has lived in France since 1987 and became a French citizen in 1998. His novels and plays, furthermore, owe at least as much to European modernist influences (such as Samuel Beckett and Eugène Ionesco) than they do to traditional Chinese literary aesthetics. Worst of all, the literary works cited by the Swedish Academy in its Nobel commendation arguably all express dissident sentiments. The government in Beijing consequently responded to news of the award by denouncing the “political purpose” of the decision and declaring that the prize had lost all legitimacy.12\n\nContrast this with the very different reception afforded to Mo Yan, who in 2012 became China’s second Nobel laureate in literature. Unlike Gao, Mo had never sought to actively distance himself from his country of origin or its regime and had gone on record as admiring the aesthetic pronouncements that Mao Zedong had issued in the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art (1942). News of Mo’s prize won immediate acclaim from the Chinese government but equally quick condemnation from a number of influential world literary figures, including the Nobel laureate Herta Müller and Salman Rushdie, who in a Facebook post referred to Mo as a “patsy of the regime” and as the “Chinese equivalent of the Soviet Russian apparatchik writer Mikhail Sholokov.”13 The Swedish Academy also came under attack; the award was widely seen as an attempt to repair relations with the Chinese government that had frayed when the dissident intellectual Lu Xiaobo was awarded the Peace Prize in 2010.\n\nContemporary authors (especially those from outside Europe or North America), then, seem caught in a double bind. On the one hand, writers who stray too far from officially sanctioned traditions in their countries of origin risk being labeled as traitors and apostates if the international literary community embraces them. Those who play it safe, on the other hand, expose themselves to charges of aesthetic subservience, of being mere “patsies.” Thomas Mann, who was simultaneously attacked by the Nazis as a foreign propagandist and by American intellectuals such as James T. Farrell as a German apologist, certainly knew this double bind well.\n\nThe Burden of Politics\n\nOf course, not all authors who are accorded “representative” status in the eyes of the world are treated in the same fashion. This too is something that Thomas Mann understood. As we have seen, throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, Mann was far more likely to be fêted in America as a European writer, or as somebody extolling classical humanist values, than as a specifically German figure. Only in the middle of the 1930s, when the US public became increasingly interested in Nazi Germany, and when Mann publicly spoke out against Hitler, did this identification change. And as the interview that he gave on the deck of the Queen Mary indicates, this shift was accompanied by surging interest in his political and cultural writings. Soon Mann’s role as a commentator on contemporary events competed with, and even overshadowed, his literary reputation. Mann recognized the inevitability of this development, although he inwardly resented it. His diaries are full of anxious remarks about the amount of time his lecture tours took away from his literary activity, for example.\n\nIn the contemporary literary marketplace, it is mostly writers from the so-called Third World who are asked to shoulder this kind of political burden. The critic Timothy Brennan, for example, writing in the immediate wake of the fatwa issued against Salman Rushdie in 1989, has pointed out how this affair and its implications for discussions of artistic censorship, the future of Islam, and the state of relations between West and East have completely overshadowed any critical interest in the complex aesthetic structure of The Satanic Verses. “The prominence of politics in Third-World fiction,” so Brennan concludes, “or rather, our own tendentious projection of politics on to a mythical ‘Third World,’ is exactly what Western critics find attractive.”14 By extension, authors from such countries who refuse to engage in politics, or at least to submit to the formal dicta of what Fredric Jameson has called “national allegory” (i.e., to a form of narration in which the fate of individual characters sheds light on that of the entire community), have a much harder time finding success in the literary marketplace.15\n\nOf course Germany is not a Third World nation, and Thomas Mann was never perceived in the eyes of the American public as some kind of racial or religious “other.” Nevertheless, it is possible to draw a direct line from his own situation to those confronting contemporary writers from the Global South. For as more recent critics working on issues of global literary circulation have pointed out, writers from Africa, the Middle East, or Southeast Asia who are showered with attention by western readers frequently have one thing in common: they hail from places that have recently become of acute geopolitical interest, whether because of civil unrest, invasion by coalition armies in the name of the “War on Terror,” or natural disaster. The critic Gloria Fisk, for example, has written about Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk that his “canonization rests on his ability to render Turkish people and places eminently legible to readers who lack the facility to read his words without a translator or to locate his characters and settings with ease on a map.” Pamuk “gains currency,” Fisk continues, “from the strategic value of his geographic location, which prompts his readers to gesture towards their anxieties about Islamic terrorism and the wars against it when they describe the greatness of Orhan Pamuk in terms of his goodness as a citizen of the world.”16\n\nThomas Mann, writing at a time when the United States was rousing itself from isolationist slumber and reaching for the status of global hegemon, was arguably the first writer in literary history to “gain currency” in precisely this fashion. His novels were praised in America in no small part because of his perceived “goodness as a citizen of the world.” It’s true that the works Mann wrote during his exile are formally very different from those written by Pamuk or other contemporary writers who benefit from their “geographic location,” such as Khaled Hosseini (author of the 2003 novel The Kite Runner) or Amitav Ghosh (Sea of Poppies, 2008). Neither are they explicitly about Nazism nor do they employ realist aesthetics to tell the story of a people through the lives of individual protagonists (as Mann arguably still had done in his 1901 debut novel Buddenbrooks). And yet they too lent themselves to interpretation as national allegories, such as when Sir Hartley Shawcross quoted from Lotte in Weimar during the Nuremberg trials or when Harry Levin detected shadows of the Office of Price Administration in Joseph the Provider by the newly Americanized Thomas Mann.\n\nExile as a Transformative Condition\n\nThe third way in which Mann prefigured the fate of many a writer in the twenty-first century comes through his status as an émigré, and as somebody who recognized that a foreign reading public had now largely supplanted the domestic one that originally nourished him. Harry Levin, in his 1941 book on James Joyce, acknowledged that “Mann is a more typical and explicit figure than Joyce, possibly because he has worked in a narrower and heavier tradition. He has been exiled by fascism, not philistinism.”17 Indeed, over the course of the latter half of the twentieth century, the case of the writer exiled to a foreign country by violence or persecution would come to seem far more “typical” than that of the avant-garde figure who flees from mere misunderstanding and philistinism. Examples of this category would include Milan Kundera leaving post-1968 Czechoslovakia for Paris, Salman Rushdie relocating to the safety of a guarded compound in London following the Iranian fatwa, or Wole Soyinka taking up residence in New York following the Abacha military coup in Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to remember, of course, that exile is first and foremost a personal tragedy, not a mark of aesthetic distinction. And despite the uninterrupted current of political violence that connects Mann’s time with our own, the vast majority of successful writers over the past seventy-five years have never experienced displacement of this kind. But what nevertheless renders the exiled writer of the mid-twentieth century a “typical” figure for the present day is that authors like Mann, who were cut off from the personal and professional networks that nourished them during earlier parts of their careers, were forced to adapt to the needs of a new and more international audience in order to survive. In this, they foreshadow conditions also experienced by at least two different sets of contemporary writers: on the one hand, authors like Pamuk or J. M. Coetzee, who were forced to seek international markets after facing insult and slander, but not outright persecution, in their home countries. On the other, those writers who come from national traditions that are simply too small or too destitute to support an author of ambitious literary fiction and thus require a move to some other location, usually a western metropolis.\n\nTo a certain extent, this third criterion works in direct opposition to the first one. Western consumers (for it is western consumers, of course, who dictate demands in the “international” book market) tend to prefer literary fare that engages in active dialogue with globally established aesthetic norms. As the critic James English has pointed out, the first Nobel Prize to be awarded to an African author did precisely not go to Léopold Sédar Sen ghor of Senegal, president of his country for the first two decades following its independence, and a strong proponent of authentically African cultural traditions.18 Instead, it went to Wole Soyinka—no less noteworthy a literary figure, perhaps, but also an author who cast Nigerian subjects into literary forms that were clearly descended from the European modernist idiom. English compares this decision to the Grammy that the United States Recording Academy awarded in the same year to Paul Simon’s Graceland, an album that repackaged South African rhythms and melodies as “world music.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, however, Soyinka himself saw matters differently, and in his Nobel acceptance speech, which he delivered in a traditional Yoruba ceremonial robe, described the award as a “national honor” for Nigeria.19 The simple lesson here, perhaps, is that the international literary community prefers writers who are recognizably “from somewhere” in their personal demeanor, nonliterary pronouncements, and political activism, but who nevertheless write their poetic works in a globally accessible idiom. Here, too, Mann can be seen as a paradigmatic figure. Unmistakably German in his essays, speeches, and personal interviews, he nevertheless devoted a substantial portion of his time in the United States to rewriting stories drawn from the Old Testament, and thus to materials that would have been instantly recognizable even to US readers that knew nothing at all about German culture.\n\nStylistic Adaptations\n\nAuthors are not merely passive victims in a selection process whereby some writers find acceptance in the eyes of the international community while others falter, however. More often than not, they willingly alter their styles to appeal to a global readership. The critic Rebecca Walkowitz has spoken in this context of “born translated” texts—literary works written in the conscious knowledge that they would primarily be read in translation, and by a far-flung readership.20 Of the many characteristics of such texts adduced by Walkowitz and like-minded critics, two seem especially noteworthy. First, high literary (as opposed to pulp or genre) fiction that has been born translated tends to contain a metatextual element, in which authors directly reflect on the conditions of their global circulation. “While many books produced today seek to entice or accommodate translation, aiming to increase their audiences and the market-share of their publishers, born-translated works are notable because they highlight the effects of circulation on production,” Walkowitz writes. “Not only are they quickly and widely translated, they are also engaged in thinking about that process.”21\n\nThe critic Nergis Ertürk provides a good example of how this process works in her analysis of Orhan Pamuk’s novel Snow (2002), which features a scene in which the various residents of a provincial Turkish town come together to jointly deliberate how they would like to see themselves represented in a report that Pamuk’s journalist-protagonist Ka is about to file for a German newspaper.22 (The invisible editor of that newspaper, coincidentally, is named Hans Hansen, after a character from Thomas Mann’s Tonio Kröger.) But more than sixty years before Snow was published, Mann himself already employed a very similar dynamic in the seventh chapter of his novel Lotte in Weimar, which is, in a sense, all about how autobiographical confessions, second-hand testimony, critical studies, and other sources interlink to create an abiding image of an author entirely by textual means. And only a few years later, he wrote The Tables of the Law, his biblical narrative in which Moses is reinvented as an author-hero who struggles to invent an appropriate form through which a written version of the Ten Commandments might be spread to all the peoples of the earth, not just his own.\n\nA second feature of born-translated fiction is that it often (whether consciously or unconsciously) strives for an idiom that will lend itself to easy translation into other languages. The author and translator Tim Parks has been scathing of this tendency. “What seems doomed to disappear” in the new global novel, so he complains, “is the kind of work that revels in the subtle nuances of its own language and literary culture.”23 This, admittedly, is not an accusation that one might ever make against Thomas Mann. His prose toward the end of his exile is not in any way “simpler” or “less subtle” than the kind of writing that he produced during the 1920s, when he was still comfortably ensconced in Germany. Indeed, in many ways a novel like Doctor Faustus is more difficult, more Germanic, and more nuanced than anything that Mann wrote before. In particular, the famous conversation with the devil, which is written in the style of the Protestant Reformation, runs directly counter to Walkowitz’s observation that many texts to be born in translation consciously erase nuances of idiom and dialect when rendering dialogue between characters. Many of Mann’s interlocutors in the American publishing industry—from his translator Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter to the Book-of-the-Month Club judge Dorothy Canfield Fisher to his admiring exegete Clifton Fadiman—were driven to occasional vexation by his stylistic flights of fancy, and yet nobody ever exerted any meaningful pressure on Mann to simplify his prose.\n\nWhat is also true, however, is that Mann himself was aware of the difficulties presented by his style and responded to these in his authorial practice. Most obvious here are his instructions to Lowe-Porter to cut certain sections of his texts that he did not think would be readily intelligible to an American audience. Nowhere does he give the impression that he regarded these cuts as literary mutilations; he was comfortable with different versions of his works existing for different target audiences, and thus with the creation of what Walkowitz has called “multiples” of his works. As the example of Joseph the Provider shows, over time Mann also let American idioms and English loan words creep into his otherwise carefully controlled German. The result was a prose that, even if it had not been created with translatability explicitly in mind, was nevertheless touched by the quotidian reality of an exile existence and gave stylistic testimony to the fact that Mann refused to shut himself off from the English-speaking world.\n\nLiterature as Therapy and World Building\n\nThe fifth way in which the story of Thomas Mann’s American exile foreshadows developments in contemporary literature has less to do with the author’s own choices and predispositions than it does with the structural conditions that made his success possible. Each successive stage of Mann’s rise to fame in the United States took place amid distinct efforts of ordinary Americans to make sense of their own place in the wider world. First, there were the middlebrow reception networks of the 1920s and early 1930s, which attempted to commodify a vision of European cultural greatness for practical use by American audiences. This was followed by the Popular Front of the mid-1930s, which sought international solidarity under the sign of literary engagement. Then there were the efforts of various organizations ranging from commercial lecturing bureaus to the America First Committee, which helped (and sometimes cajoled) ordinary citizens to form an opinion on how their republic should relate to the world at large during the years immediately preceding Pearl Harbor. This, in turn, was followed by the creation of a military-industrial complex that transformed publishing and aimed to mobilize the American masses for a time of total war. And finally, there was the early Cold War, with its paranoia and anti-Communist hysteria.\n\nThe composite story told by these various endeavors to use fiction in an attempt to paint a picture of the world contrasts with some of the more traditional efforts to tell the literary history of this period. Surveys of modernism have often focused on the devotion to purity, honesty, and anticommercialism that created bonds of solidarity among a fairly small segment of the world’s writers and readers. Studies of the left-wing avant-garde have, on the other hand, generally focused on political engagement at the expense of other explanatory factors. But reframing the story of Thomas Mann in the ways I endeavor to do in this book not only results in a more democratic explanation for what he meant to ordinary readers in the 1930s and 1940s but also helps us connect his fate to that of later generations of authors.\n\nThe critic Timothy Aubry, for example, has spent considerable time reflecting on the ways in which ordinary readers in the twenty-first century utilize fiction to make sense of their lives amid conditions of globalized, late-stage capitalism. In contrast to Gloria Fisk, who describes much of contemporary world literature as an attempt to “market writers to guilty tourists,” Aubry speaks of a “therapy” culture and examines the various ways in which literary texts are employed for healing purposes in times of fragmentation, alienation, and financial precarity.24 One of his case studies concerns Khaled Hosseini’s bestselling phenomenon The Kite Runner and examines how western readers used this novel of a faraway country to soothe their fears about a rapidly escalating War on Terror. Jim Collins, in his work on popular literary culture in the twenty-first century, similarly stresses how book clubs, online literary communities, and crowd-sourced reviewing platforms not only provide their users with a sense of self-affirmation but also help them make sense of the world.25\n\nAgnes E. Meyer’s rhapsodic reaction to her reading of Joseph in Egypt in the mountains of Wyoming, or Ralph Ellison’s imaginative projection of himself into the North German world of Tonio Kröger (“I found it impossible not to identify myself with the character,” he wrote to Langston Hughes) show that the therapeutic culture discussed by Aubrey existed too in the case of Thomas Mann.26 And the online communities of the present day were foreshadowed by the Book-of-the-Month Club of the 1930s as well as, for example, the reading coteries that formed in US prisoner-of-war camps, where bored German soldiers engaged with Thomas Mann and learned to relate to the world in an entirely novel fashion. In other words, Mann became a star not only because he was a great writer but also because he was useful to his audience.\n\nPublishing Revolutions\n\nThe final way in which we might connect Mann’s American years to the present day has to do with his participation in the various publishing revolutions of the mid-twentieth century. As Rebecca Walkowitz has stressed, born-translated fiction is defined by a certain kind of style in combination with a self-aware relationship to novel media and distribution channels. Digital and multimedial texts play an important role in her twenty-first-century story—for example, in her discussion of the collaborative web artists Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries. So do reflections on the complex copyright regimes that govern the global distribution of literature, and on the multiple language- or country-specific editions of books that now exist simultaneously and in some cases blur the definitions of what counts as an original and what constitutes a translation.\n\nThomas Mann was not an artist who displayed any interest in multimediality, and he rarely intervened in the physical design of his books. In this he notably differed from many of his modernist contemporaries—for example, from James Joyce, with his doodles and experimental typefaces in Ulysses (1922). But it was precisely because, rather than despite, of this laissez-faire attitude that Mann’s works experienced the full force of a rapidly evolving global book market. What mattered to Mann first and foremost was that his works reached an audience, an ambition in which he found two eager partners in Alfred A. Knopf and Gottfried Bermann Fischer. At a time when worldwide war shook up the publishing industry, these two entrepreneurs were willing to compromise and innovate to place books into the hands of consumers. Their books were in various ways marked by the chaotic circumstances of their production. Is the Stockholm edition of The Magic Mountain a mere reprint or a substantially altered work, for example, given that it added a preface that challenged readers to reinterpret the novel in light of its author’s exile experience? Which editions of Mann’s works should count as “originals,” given that English- and German-language versions often appeared in close temporal proximity, and that during the war years, the US editions inevitably reached more readers by an order of magnitude than the German ones did? If the German-language editions deserve to be privileged, then which ones, given that there sometimes were multiple versions of the same work? Is the 1947 edition of Doktor Faustus a German or an American book, given that it was published in Germany but copyrighted in the United States? And is the German-language version of “Brother Hitler” that was published in Das neue Tage-Buch really primary to the translated version that came out in Esquire, despite the fact that the essay grew out of an American commission, the Esquire version slightly preceded the one in Das neue Tage-Buch, and Esquire also preserved Mann’s original title, which Das neue Tage-Buch changed without authorization?\n\nThen there were the circuitous journeys that Mann’s books—and Mann’s voice, recorded for his BBC radio addresses—took to avoid Nazi border posts, submarines, and fighter jets. In a very real sense, works like Lotte in Weimar or Joseph the Provider modeled a new form of world literature. This new form of literature circulated globally very soon after its original publication and it made its way into the hands of far-flung readers in places such as Shanghai or São Paulo despite the best efforts of governments and militaries to stop it.\n\nNowadays, large publishing houses are multinational enterprises as a matter of course, and new works by globally famous authors are sometimes released in many editions across multiple languages and countries all on the same day. Word processing and typesetting software, cloud computing, and print-on-demand technology have revolutionized global production and distribution processes just as surely as the freight container and the advent of the modern cargo ship. It is a long journey from the age of total war to the incontrovertibly global economy of the twenty-first century. Mann’s manuscripts, which would have passed from his writer’s desk in Pacific Palisades to his translator in New Jersey, from there to his publishers’ offices in Manhattan, and onward to copyediting, typesetting, and printing on the European continent, before they were finally distributed to a diasporic readership scattered across the globe, nevertheless point the way."
