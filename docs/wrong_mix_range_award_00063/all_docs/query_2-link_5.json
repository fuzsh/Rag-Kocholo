Each laureate (recipient) receives a gold medal, a diploma and a sum of money, which is decided annually by the Nobel Foundation.[2] They are widely recognized as one of the most prestigious honours awarded in the aforementioned fields.[3]\n\nFirst instituted in 1901, the Nobel Prize has been awarded to a total of 965 individuals and 27 organizations as of 2023 .[4] Among them, 28 Swiss nationals have been honored with the Nobel Prize.[nb 2] Additionally, four laureates acquired Swiss citizenship after the award: Wolfgang Pauli and Jack Steinberger were naturalized, while Kofi Annan was granted honorary citizenship from Geneva.\n\nTen organizations headquartered in Switzerland have received the Nobel Prize for Peace. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been awarded twice, and the International Committee of the Red Cross three times. Four of these organizations were also founded in Switzerland, and they all have their headquarters in Geneva, a city hosting more than 40 international organizations and 750 non-governmental organizations.[7]\n\nThe first Nobel Prize for Peace, awarded in 1901, went to the Swiss humanitarian Henry Dunant. The latest Swiss laureates are Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019. The 28 prizes are distributed as follows: nine for medicine, seven for chemistry, seven for physics, three for peace, and two for literature. No Swiss national has yet received a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.\n\nSwitzerland is among the countries with the highest number of Nobel laureates, both in total and per capita.[8][9] Several factors have been suggested as possible explanation, including large public funding for research,[10] the presence of highly ranked universities such as ETH Zürich and EPFL,[11] and the neutrality of Switzerland in the two World Wars, which attracted scientists from abroad.[9] The Nobel Prize has also been often recognized as being biased towards Western countries.[12][13][14] According to Nobel laureate Werner Arber, the large number of awards to Swiss nationals is \"likely a statistical anomaly\".[9]\n\nSwiss Nobel laureates Year Image Laureate Born Died Field Rationale 1901 , co-founder of the Red Cross 8 May 1828 in Geneva 30 October 1910 in Heiden Peace \"for his humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding\"[15]\n\nprize shared with Frédéric Passy 1902 , politician and director of the Permanent International Peace Bureau 21 May 1843 in Tramelan 16 March 1914 in Bern Peace \"for his eminently practical administration of the Inter-Parliamentary Union\"[16]\n\nprize shared with Élie Ducommun 1902 , peace activist and director of the Permanent International Peace Bureau 19 February 1833 in Geneva 7 December 1906 in Bern Peace \"for his untiring and skilful directorship of the Bern Peace Bureau\"[17]\n\nprize shared with Charles Albert Gobat 1909 , physician who introduced scientific methods in surgery 28 August 1841 in Bern 27 July 1917 in Bern Physiology or Medicine \"for his work on the physiology, pathology and surgery of the thyroid gland\"[18] 1913 , professor at the University of Zurich 12 December 1866 in Mulhouse, France\n\nacquired Swiss citizenship in 1894[19] 15 November 1919 in Zurich Physiology or Medicine \"in recognition of his work on the linkage of atoms in molecules by which he has thrown new light on earlier investigations and opened up new fields of research especially in inorganic chemistry\"[20] 1919 , poet and writer 24 April 1845 in Liestal 29 December 1924 in Lucerne Literature \"in special appreciation of his epic, Olympian Spring\"[21] 1920 , physicist, head of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures 15 February 1861 in Fleurier 13 June 1938 in Sèvres, France Physics \"in recognition of the service he has rendered to precision measurements in Physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys\"[22] 1921 , theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity 14 March 1879 in Ulm, Germany\n\nacquired Swiss citizenship in 1901[23] 18 April 1955 in Princeton, USA Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\"[24] 1937 , organic chemist known for his contributions on vitamins 21 April 1889 in Moscow, Russia 18 June 1971 in Zurich Chemistry \"for his investigations on carotenoids, flavins and vitamins A and B2\"[25]\n\nprize shared with Norman Haworth 1939 , chemist, professor at ETH Zurich 13 September 1887 in Vukovar, Austria-Hungary\n\nacquired Swiss citizenship in 1917[26] 26 September 1976 in Zurich Chemistry \"for his work on polymethylenes and higher terpenes\"[27]\n\nprize shared with Adolf Butenandt 1946 , poet, novelist and painter 2 July 1877 in Calw, Germany\n\nacquired Swiss citizenship in 1924[28] 9 August 1962 in Montagnola Literature \"for his inspired writings which, while growing in boldness and penetration, exemplify the classical humanitarian ideals and high qualities of style\"[29] 1948 , chemist at J.
