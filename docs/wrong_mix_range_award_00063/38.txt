More than 100 years ago, the writer Carl Spitteler was already dealing with current issues in our society. The understanding of democracy, the conditions in Switzerland, xenophobia and also homeland folly were already at that time the subject of his reflections, which was partly the reason why Spitteler was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1919. The agency eyeloveyou has accompanied with various measures the celebrations on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his award.

The central information medium is the website Spitteler.ch, which provides extensive information on the life and work of Carl Spitteler. In addition, it also serves with the daily updated agenda as a dynamic information portal for all events and celebrations that take place throughout Switzerland within the framework of the anniversary and are partly accompanied by the agency directly on site.

Additional measures in the form of business stationery and a reading booklet on the anniversary year were realized on the basis of the freshly developed branding. A deliberately Swiss color scheme and typography with dot drawings of historical photos are intended to emphasize the visual recognizability.
