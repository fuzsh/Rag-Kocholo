Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (2006)

Not Poltergeist. Poultrygeist! This Troma flick is set in a fast-food chicken joint that was carelessly built atop an ancient burial ground. Zombie chickens and a whole lot of other shenanigans, all of it raunchy and/or repulsive, ensue, including a scene in which the movieâs thinly veiled Colonel Sanders parody poops out an egg which then hatches into a zombie chicken that attacks him… and things only go sliding enthusiastically downhill from there. Did we mention Poultrygeist is also a musical?
