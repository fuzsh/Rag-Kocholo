Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead on DVD

When a fast food chicken restaurant is built on the site of an ancient Native American burial ground, the displaced spirits unite with the ghosts of exterminated chickens and transform into Indian Chicken zombies seeking revenge! Now it's up to a dim witted counter boy, his lesbian ex-girlfriend, and a burqa wearing fry cook to put an end to the foul-feathered menace once and for all. A hilarious mix of social satire, extreme gore, and hauntingly catchy musical numbers, this film is the most gut busting and outrageous movie! Also included is Poultry in Motion, the feature length behind the scenes cluckumentary on the making of Poultrygeist.
