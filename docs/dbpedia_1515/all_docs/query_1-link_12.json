        "text": "No gag is too obvious, no gross-out too disgusting and no pun too lame for Troma founder Lloyd Kaufman's vulgar horror comedy. Arbie (Jason Yachanin) has had a crush on Wendy (Kate Graham) all through high school, but they share their first and only kiss shortly before she goes away to college. Some months later, the lovelorn Arbie returns to the site of their blissful encounter – the Tromahawk Indian graveyard – only to find it buried under a new branch of racist fast-food magnate General Lee Roy's (Robin Watkins) American Chicken Bunker. Worse still, the crowd of protesters outside includes Wendy and her new girlfriend, anti-corporate activist Micki (Allyson Sereboff). To spite the unfaithful Wendy, Arbie gets a job at the Chicken Bunker, where it soon becomes apparent that something is very wrong. Employees begin dying in grotesque ways, while customers become possessed and develop explosive diarrhea. The souls of the Tromahawk dead are using the flesh of chickens sacrificed for General Lee Roy's greed to take their revenge! Though Troma films have become steadily more ambitious and marginally better funded indie production, they remain relentlessly gross, tasteless and juvenile. Kaufman runs a vaguely clever premise right into the toilet, both literally and metaphorically, and sight gags like animal rights activists expressing their horror at factory farming of chickens via \"I love cock\" placards are aimed squarely at sniggering 12 year olds. ."
