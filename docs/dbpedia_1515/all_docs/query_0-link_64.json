        "text": "Be prepared to reject fast food after watching this one! A group of workers at a military-themed fried chicken restaurant realizes too late that their business is built on top of an ancient Native American burial ground. And that’s when things get real plucked up! It’s up to them to fight off the evil zombie chickens that return from the dead to wreak havoc on fast food workers and consumers.\n\nHailed as one of Troma’s best films (and rightfully so after the hardships the filmmakers went through to make it, all documented in POULTRY IN MOTION: TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN CHICKEN), this absolutely insane and hilarious dark meat comedy is one any musical or horror aficionado can’t miss.\n\nThis is the third and final film in our GREETINGS FROM TROMAVILLE season – a tribute to Troma Entertainment, the longest-running independent film studio in North America, now celebrating 45 years of filmmaking. Primarily known for classic titles such as Lloyd Kaufman's THE TOXIC AVENGER, CLASS OF NUKE ‘EM HIGH, TROMEO & JULIET, Charles Kaufman’s MOTHER’S DAY and Tray Parker’s CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL!, Troma’s library of nearly 1000 films, cartoons, TV shows and shorts contains early work of many of today’s major star actors, directors and writers. Trey Parker, James Gunn, Eli Roth, Oliver Stone, Jenna Fisher, Kevin Costner, Vincent D’Onofrio, Marisa Tomei and Samuel L. Jackson are just a few. Troma Entertainment continues to be a haven for young and independent filmmakers during the era of corporate takeovers.\n\nTickets available for the other screenings here:"
