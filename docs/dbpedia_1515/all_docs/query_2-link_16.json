        "text": "Even though Troma's gore and T&A quotients may be high, the films remain a matter of the flesh being willing but the production values weak.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Oct 18, 2008\n\nKaufman manages to surprise with the extremes he takes his customary combination of low budget and high camp to in Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Jul 18, 2008\n\nCrosses big gross-out shock scenes with more in-the-know jokes about terrorists and nutrition, without ever realizing or acknowledging this chasm. I wish it had been a little smarter -- or dumber.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Jul 17, 2008\n\nIt's not pretty, and the humor is sometimes embarrassingly puerile, but for those with a passion for subversive trash, Troma Entertainment is still serving it on a bile-covered platter.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 17, 2008\n\nA heaping helping of political incorrectness gleefully spiced to offend just about every sentient being.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jun 13, 2008\n\nLooks convincing enough to be icky and fake enough to be hilarious.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Jun 12, 2008\n\nOne of the most entertaining flicks I've seen all year...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | May 25, 2008\n\nKaufman runs a vaguely clever premise right into the toilet, both literally and metaphorically.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/4 | May 9, 2008\n\nPoultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead is just about as perfect as a film predicated on the joys of projectile vomiting and explosive diarrhea can be.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | May 9, 2008\n\nOpen[s] with the best trying-to-unfasten-a-bra and zombie-finger-as-buttplug gags in movie history, which are closely followed by the most tasteless fisting scene since William Freidkin's Cruising.\n\nFull Review | May 7, 2008\n\nQuite possibly the world's first horror-musical-sex-comedy, the strangely impressive originality of Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead doesn't come even close to compensating for its everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink midnight-movie awfulness.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: .5/4 | May 6, 2008"
