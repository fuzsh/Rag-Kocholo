        "text": "Leisure Horror Titles From July to December 2009 (21 Jun 2009). Probably not useful to anyone anymore, but here is a list Leisure Horror's releases from July to December 2009.\n\nSix Vampire Movies I Can Watch Over and Over (11 Jul 2009). Maybe more than six, now, but here are the six that I can for sure watch over and over.\n\nDoug's Picks for Ten Honestly Effective Horror Movies (21 Jul 2009). I probably need to update it, but here you go.\n\nTen more horror movies (addendum to the other list) (27 Jul 2009). 10 more movies added to the original list, above.\n\nLet's talk some horror literature news: Brian Keene to be awarded WHC Grand Master and Faber Finds to reprint more Aickman (25 Mar 2014). Brian Keene is about to receive one of horror's top honors, and Robert Aickman stands to get to a boost in popularity as new editions of his books drift up for the centenary.\n\nThe 8 Basic Building Blocks of Most Horror (14 Dec 2009). I break down horror into what seems to be eight essential concepts: the monster, the victim, the isolation, the visitation, the consumption, the escalation, the legend, and the twist.\n\nHave you heard of Candle Cove? Like creepy things? You'll need to see this... (26 Aug 2010).\n\nThe Missing Disgusting Audiobook Problem (2 Jun 2012). About three years ago I semi-reviewed an audiobook. About two years ago, that book disappeared off the web. Leading us, naturally, to a very common question that I receive...\n\nSound-as-Horror: an audioscript I am writing using the concept, the scariest sound I have ever heard, and reference to \"The Pattern\" and \"A Neighbour's Landmark\" (and others) as example (30 Jul 2012). It is time for me to get around to writing this audioplay that has been in my head. About a strange sound in the woods, and the horrible consequences that result for those trying to solve it...\n\nA faux trailer about making smart decisions in horror movies, plus a bit about dramatic irony in horror (16 Oct 2013). Some people made a fake trailer for a movie called Hell No, about making smart decisions in horror. It's funny, but I need to make one point about dramatic irony in horror.\n\nMy Four Halloween Reads: Rickman's Curfew, Clegg's The Hour Before Dark, Cisco's The Divinity Student, and Campbell's Holes for Faces. (20 Oct 2013). There was a time when I would have a stack of books and movies to go through for Halloween. While I don't tend to have that energy, anymore, I thought it would be nice to designate four books as my Halloween reads this year: Phil Rickman's Curfew, Douglas Clegg's The Hour Before Dark, Michael Cisco's The Divinity Student, and Ramsey Campbell's Holes for Faces.\n\nThe next big thing in horror...what do you think it will be? I make my guess. Also, a horrible list of horror cliches to avoid, and my better list of avoidable things. (6 Nov 2013). I'm confused by a list of horror cliche's to avoid, and felt I should give you my five things I would suggest avoiding in horror. Also, what's the next the big thing? I take a stab at it."
