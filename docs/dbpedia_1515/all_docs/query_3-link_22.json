        "text": "David Gordon Green’s powerful sequel to the beloved Halloween shakes things up and effectively erases decades of tainted mythology.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nZachary Cruz-Tan\n\nThere have been so many Halloween movies as to lose count. Sequels upon sequels. Spin-offs upon remakes. I have not seen them all, thank god, so I was relieved to discover this new Halloween movie doesn’t require me to. It’s a direct follow-up to the great 1978 original, which means we can forget about all the nonsense that has polluted the past 40 years. Rightfully so – this sequel is a whole lot of fun, right down to the scene of a little boy clipping his toenails.\n\nOf course it’s not fun in any conventional sense. This is a movie where a gas station attendant gets his jaw smashed on a counter and a housewife is battered with a hammer. But the key to these Halloween movies is the way their characters draw attention away from the violence. Most slasher pictures glorify the bloodshed. They’re not so much about who is getting killed as about how much brain is being splattered. Halloween goes to great lengths to make its heroes and villains interesting, so that on some basic level, they are worth caring about.\n\nI, for one, care a great deal for the killer Michael Myers (played in unison by Nick Castle, James Jude Courtney and Tony Moran) and the frantic heroine Laurie Strode (Jaime Lee Curtis). Myers is a monolithic creature of murder, yes, but why? He kills in cold blood, but one gets the feeling there’s a labyrinth of dread and intelligence beneath that pale mask. Perhaps the mystery of his mind is why he’s always accompanied by a psychiatrist who wrongly believes he is exempt from Michael’s blade.\n\nCurtis, who originated the role in 1978 and returned in many of the forgettable sequels, is now a weathered grandma determined to see her tormentor perish. Her daughter and granddaughter are estranged, broken by years of paranoid delusions that Myers will return to finish them off. Her daughter Karen (Judy Greer), the poor girl, spent her childhood rigging booby traps and abusing mannequins as target practice. It’s a wonder she didn’t grow up to become G.I. Jane.\n\nNaturally, Michael escapes, on Halloween night no less, and at first I thought it was all going to happen again. Michael kills. Laurie and the cops try in vain to stop him. Michael flees. Roll the credits. But then the movie shifts by turning the plot from violence to intimacy. It becomes a showdown. A showdown between two well-acquainted predators. It’s very intense and very well-made, utterly thrilling, clever, at times funny, and totally worthy of John Carpenter’s great masterpiece. Seldom is a sequel this fulfilling.\n\nHalloween is available in Australian cinemas from October 25\n\nImage © Universal Pictures 2018\n\nEngulfed in a thick fog of tension, A Quiet Place is an early contender for the best horror film of 2018.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nRhys Graeme-Drury\n\nThe best horror movies are those that prey on very basic, primal fears; things like don’t breathe, don’t blink or don’t move. In A Quiet Place, writer/actor/director John Krasinski implores his audience and his characters to not make a sound. The film, set in the not-too-distant future, centres around a family who must navigate their lives in total silence after the world is overrun by vicious creatures who hunt via noise, where even the slightest tremor or tinkle could alert them to your presence.\n\nKrasinski really sells us on this bleak and unforgiving future. The fear and dread conveyed with every creaking floorboard or crunchy leaf underfoot is immediately arresting, and effective direction from Krasinski, in only his third feature film, envelops the theatre, getting under your skin and putting you on edge right from the get-go. Few films are as adept as crafting tension as A Quiet Place; prepare to peer though your fingers, dig your nails into the armrest and squirm like you’ve got an eel in your undies.\n\nA distinct lack of a dialogue – the characters communicate via subtitled American Sign Language –means the viewer is scanning the auditory soundscape for every scuffle and snarl as much as they are probing the frame for shadows. The absence of dialogue shifts the focus onto the facial expressions of the actors, as well as the subtle and unnerving sound design. Rising to the occasion, Krasinski and real-life as well as onscreen wife Emily Blunt are great in conveying this paralysing terror through their performances.\n\nThere are more than a few hair-raising jump scares that punctuate the tension, and the film doesn’t waste time in getting to the point; an in medias res prologue sets the scene before leaping ahead several months to establish the family in their new normal; fishing in the river and washing laundry all in total silence.\n\nAnd while the film is light on specifics – this isn’t a sci-fi/thriller that goes to great lengths to explore the how and why of its gruesome antagonists – it also isn’t a horror film where you never get a good look at the predator lurking in the bushes. The most immediate and obvious comparison is Ridley Scott’s Alien – the fear of the unknown and the undefeatable pervades every scene – but JJ Abrams’ Super 8 and M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs also spring to mind.\n\nAn overreliance on Marco Beltrami’s strings signposts some of the biggest scares and the rather simplistic concept feels a little strung out across the 95-minute runtime, with the finale arriving in a hurry, but this is a compelling and gruesome creature feature from Krasinski, and one that will enthral genre fans and general audiences alike.\n\nA Quiet Place is available in Australian cinemas from April 5\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nJosip Knezevic\n\nTis the season to be scary, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Here are horror films you might have missed that deserve to be ranked among the best.\n\nMay\n\nPossibly the least well known film on this list, May is one of the creepiest slow burns American cinema has produced. This is all credit to the leading actress Angela Bettis who plays a young shy misfit who begins to develop a crush on a man who takes a shine to her awkwardness. Without giving too much away, as does the trailer, May’s personality begins to take an obsessive turn and leads into one hell of a buildup that is bound to leave you with a weird taste in your mouth. If you don’t mind the slow burn nature of the plot and the semi low budget production values, May is definitely a film for you. Check it out.\n\nPandorum\n\nIt’s Dead Space meets Resident Evil meets The Descent – and it has Dennis Quaid. Pandorum is a sci-fi horror film that plays out like a lucid dream with elements borrowed from films such as Memento and The Matrix. I know. How much else can it take. But thankfully Pandorum takes the best of all those films and combines it into something that still maintains its originality. This is one of those films that truly makes you not want to gaze into the dark because what lies in the distance soon comes at you with visceral pace and fear. Ben Foster delivers a hell of a performance as well and again reminds us of the underrated abilities he possesses as an actor.\n\nFunny Games\n\nIt won’t matter if it’s the original French or remade American version, Funny Games delivers on Michael Haneke’s perfection of horror cinema that not only is completely terrifying but also incredibly smart. Both are directed by Haneke and deliver an experience that will be frustratingly difficult to watch without giving too much away. But this is the point. Set in a house by the lake, a family soon begins to be terrorized by two brothers who have a twisted game set up for its poor occupants. Shot expertly and written purposefully, Funny Games aims to horrify and comment on society at the same time. A masterpiece from a masterful director.\n\nMartyrs\n\nEasily the scariest film in this list, Martyrs follows the plight for revenge on those who kidnapped her and other young women but on her search, finds an even more horrifying truth. Criticized as grotesque torture porn, Martyrs is often overlooked as a B-grade horror film without any joy but this is what makes it deliver so crucially on the horror aspect. It’s a dark, bleak and terrifying film. This is horror in its purest form minus the Hollywood glam that has been drizzled upon in recent years. It also has one of the best endings of any horror film, akin to that of The Descent’s famous cliffhanger. For fans desiring to expand their horror catalogue, Martyrs is the film for you.\n\nPoultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead/Dead Alive (Braindead)\n\nFor the best scenes of explosive diarrhea and a lawnmower chopping faces off the undead, look no further than this double bill of Poultrygeist and Dead Alive. I’ve combined both these films into one as they follow the same trend of being some of the best over-the-top splatter films. The latter film being written and directed by New Zealand’s most famous export, Peter Jackson. Yes, before he was winning academy awards for epic films about Hobbits, he was busy killing the undead with basic kitchenware. Whereas Dead Alive follows the rise of the human undead, Poultrygeist bests it by introducing the rise of the chicken undead. I know. Can it get any better?! These films won’t be for everyone but if you love intentionally bad dialogue and laughing your head off to the most ridiculous scenes of prop gore, then this double bill should be right up your alley.\n\nAudition\n\nFinally. Japan. Enough of American cinema. Horror and the Japanese reach new heights when it comes to delivering tension and creepiness in ways you haven’t imagined, and Audition is yet another slow burning masterpiece that waits till the very end to bring in the ultimate pay off for what you wait for. Don’t get me wrong, the film is still interesting enough to watch throughout as we follow the life of a lonely widower who begins to seek love once more in that of a withdrawn but gorgeous woman. Slowly we realize there’s more to this lady than meets the eye and even if all the time you’re screaming out “there’s something wrong with her!”, nothing can prepare you for the final act.\n\nSpecial mentions: What We Do in the Shadows, Last Shift, It Follows, It Comes at Night, The Host.\n\nImages courtesy of Universal Pictures Video, Icon Film Distribution, Madman Entertainment, Kojo Pictures, Jigsaw Entertainment, Siren Visual Entertainment\n\nDespite dying all the way back in Saw III, Jigsaw is back for an eighth twisted and gruesome game after a lengthy absence.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nCorey Hogan\n\nMore than a decade has passed since John Kramer, a.k.a. the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell) – the man notorious for kidnapping people and putting them in traps that force them to mutilate themselves to escape death as a means of creating a newfound appreciation for life – and his circle of successors all met grisly ends. The violence has ceased, until now; as police shoot down a petty thug, a triggering mechanism is activated and sets in motion a new game played by five people trapped in a remote barn filled with diabolically lethal things at every turn. Mangled bodies start turning up, and as the investigative team, including Detective Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie) and forensic doctors Logan Nelson (Matt Passmore) and Eleanor Bonneville (Hannah Emily Anderson) dig deeper, all the evidence points to the late Jigsaw as the perpetrator.\n\nIt wasn’t too much of a stretch to predict that 2010’s Saw 3D was never going to be The Final Chapter as it claimed; nothing in Hollywood, especially in the horror genre (and especially one of the horror genre’s highest-grossing franchises) ever stays dead anymore, so by that logic Jigsaw was always inevitable. The good news is that its source is one of the genre’s most inventive, if not for the faint of heart series, and despite it having narratively driven itself into a dead end, this belated eighth entry manages to breathe a bit of new life into its corpse, doing its many fans justice and pulling off a few neat tricks of its own.\n\nTaking the reins from its Australian creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell (who remain as producers) is, appropriately, another Aussie horror filmmaking duo, The Spierig Brothers (Daybreakers, Predestination). Their biggest adjustment to proceedings is the visual style – gone is the grainy, low-grade camerawork, grungy bathrooms and rust as far as the eye can see, updated with slick cinematography and, for the first time, shiny and new-looking killing instruments. The Spierigs are aware that audience expectations have changed since Saw last soaked our screens in blood, and so the story deviates from the usual formula too; we follow the police investigation equally as much as the victims of the latest game, veering slightly away from the torture-porn trappings that later entries became and closer to the psychological thrills of the first film.\n\nWhich is not to say that Jigsaw isn’t gory; there are new traps here that rank up there with the series’ stomach-churning best, from the body-shredding spiral blade contraption to the flesh-cutting laser collars – fans can rest easy with the amount of blood and guts spilled. Pleasingly, after being sidelined for so long, the iconic Jigsaw himself takes centre stage once again, with the mystery of how exactly he has returned forming the core of the plot. Bell still dominates in his signature role, and the story that once again explores his backstory alongside his legacy makes a franchise that felt all out of places to go feel like it actually has plenty of fresh directions to take us in.\n\nUpdates aside, this is still quintessentially Saw, which does mean it shares the series problems too; most of which usually boil down to its writing. Though tricksy, it’s always relied on quite a large suspension of disbelief given the huge coincidences that cause everything to fall into place just right and push each plot point into place, and Jigsaw is no different. Again, the twist ending is awfully contrived and frankly ridiculous if you put even a smidgen of thought into it.\n\nBut though it doesn’t quite reach the franchise high point, Jigsaw surpasses a good portion of the sequels and exceeds expectations; though it won’t win Saw many new fans, and its potential as a series reboot remains to be seen, this is an interesting and satisfying enough long-awaited follow-up.\n\nJigsaw is available in Australian cinemas from November 02\n\nImage courtesy of Studio Canal Australia 2017\n\nJust when you thought found footage was dead, we’ve come full circle back to where it all started – and it might actually make you shit your pants this time.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nCorey Hogan\n\nTwo decades after his sister Heather went missing while shooting a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch, James Donahue (James Allen McCune) discovers a YouTube video that appears to be new footage of her experiences in the woods. His curiosity finally getting the better of him, James convinces his friends Lisa (Callie Hernandez), Peter (Brandon Scott) and Ashley (Corbin Reid) to meet the uploader of the video and venture into the forest to investigate. Shooting a documentary of their own, they soon begin to regret their inquisitiveness as unsettling occurrences reveal the legend of the Blair Witch to be lamentably true.\n\nLove it or loathe it, The Blair Witch Project has had an astounding impact since it took the world by storm back in 1999. Made on a shoestring budget and marketed as the product of a real event, not fiction, it broke the box office worldwide, popularised the found footage subgenre, and built fear by showing us as little as possible; leaving it up to our imaginations to conjure up the monster lurking in the darkness.\n\nDirector Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett’s (You’re Next, The Guest) surprise sequel Blair Witch is, save for the same story beats, almost entirely the opposite. Aware that the original’s guerrilla style, unglamorous techniques and slow pacing just isn’t going to cut it with modern horror audiences, they’ve glossed it up with an abundance of technology and made the scares considerably more frequent and in-your-face. Wingard and Barrett aren’t the least bit concerned with authenticity, or reinventing the wheel, or much of anything really; they’re simply here to do one thing – scare the pants off you.\n\nOur team of amateur filmmakers assembles itself, learns of some of the sinister tales and legends of the Witch, then bravely journeys into the woods. It mirrors the setup of the first, only this time there’s twice as many teens to expend, and thus half the character development. Sadly, these bland kids are copied and pasted directly from the contemporary horror template, and none are given enough time to form any kind of characterisation; they’re simply there to articulate exposition. The familial link to the first film is flimsy and far-fetched, and begs the question of why James would be stupid enough to follow in the footsteps of his sister.\n\nWhen things first start to go bump in the night, there’s a disheartening amount of cheap jump scares, but soon the threat becomes real and a supreme dread sets in. There’s been sixteen years of evolution in horror since the original and it’s all unleashed here. The sound department must be applauded for their design; this is the most impressively unnerving earful copped from a horror in years.\n\nIt’s frustratingly light on explanation, lacks the subtle smarts of its archetype and is a huge deal of substance short of achieving greatness, but it’s hard to complain too much when Blair Witch is what so many of its peers can only pretend to be – genuinely scary.\n\nBlair Witch is available in Australian cinemas from September 15\n\nImage courtesy of Roadshow Films\n\nThere’s evil in the woods – grab your crucifixes and prepare for a hell of a time as the creepiest folktale in years is unleashed.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nCorey Hogan\n\n1630’s New England. William (Ralph Ineson) and his family – pregnant wife (Kate Dickie), daughter (Anya Taylor-Joy), son (Harvey Scrimshaw) and twins (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson) are banished from their Puritan Christian town for preaching their religious superiority. Months later, the family have built a house and farm next to a large, ominous forest and William’s wife has given birth. Soon after, the mysterious disappearance of the newborn child begins a series of bizarre and increasingly unnerving events, causing the family to turn on one another. Though the real force behind their undoing is something far more sinister – the black magic of a witch living in the woods…\n\nThe first thing you need to know before buying a ticket to see The Witch is that it is best that you know as little about the film as possible before entering the cinema. The second is that it is one of those very rare horror movies that will haunt you for days afterwards; if you’re easy to scare, get ready for some sleepless nights.\n\nDebut director Robert Eggers must have a little satanic power of his own, because he’s managed to (witch)craft the scariest film in recent memory, possibly one to be remembered alongside the all-time classics of the genre. Traditional jump-scares are abandoned entirely for a gloomy, ever-growing sense of dread. It’s a genuinely uncomfortable experience, but an incredibly effective one that won’t leave you anytime soon.\n\nThe 17th century aesthetic is realised beautifully with visceral authenticity; the dull, washed out lighting emitted by the forever overcast sky perfectly sets an oppressive mood for our damned family. The old-timey 1.66:1 aspect ratio (framing vertically as opposed to horizontally) is equally effectual here as it was in last year’s Slow West, though here it has an almost claustrophobic feeling to it, as if designed to trap the viewer within this ghastly realm with no means of escape.\n\nEggers allows shots to linger on well past the point of suspenseful to become excruciating and terrifying, and every unnerving screech of Mark Korven’s fantastic score guarantees zero lapses in uneasy alertness. The dialogue – actually recreated from real 17th century writings – takes time to gain a grasp of, but is expertly utilised to further increase the authentic charm. Every careful detail seals Eggers as an enormously impressive writer and director to keep an excited eye on.\n\nAlmost equally astounding are the relatively unknown cast who comprise the cursed kin. Game of Thrones duo Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are both lovable and loathsome as the distraught parents, but it’s the kids who really shine here – especially first-timer Harvey Scrimshaw as the young son, who may or may not have something very dark and disturbing within him, and Anya Taylor-Joy, whose star-making performance carries much of the film.\n\nThe film’s final third is bound to have some viewing through their fingers; astonishingly unpredictable and achingly tense as Eggers ramps the freakishly evil happenings up to an 11. More than just a great horror, it’s a rich film with heavy themes – including a fear of God creating a fear of something much worse – that lingers long after the credits; I knew soon after that I had to see it again. Of course, films like this aren’t going to be for everyone; its slow build, lack of in-your-face frights and dense dialogue is bound to put off those with shorter attention spans. But for the naysayers, the film has been officially endorsed by The Satanic Temple as “a transformative satanic experience”. Abandon all faith ye who enter.\n\nThe Witch is available in Australian cinemas from March 17th\n\nImage (c) Universal Pictures 2016\n\nBy Zane Alexander\n\nIn my opinion, 2014 saw the best in Australian film releases since 1994’s Muriel’s Wedding, Priscilla, Bad Boy Bubby, and The Sum of Us. While Russell Crowe’s lukewarm The Water Diviner became our top grossing Australian film for the year (with $5.65 million in less than a week), other exceptional films were left in the dust.\n\nThe following list of Aussie films were all well received overseas, and some were screened at major film festivals such as Venice and Cannes to standing ovations. Nominated for a slew of international film awards; they accrued 36 wins in total. Unfortunately, not many Australians saw them, putting our already declining industry into panic. Like a prophet who is not received in his own town, our films seem to be more loved internationally than they are here.\n\nSpecial Mention: PREDESTINATION\n\nWhilst this science fiction thriller by the Australian Spierig Brothers is an excellent film, it does raise debate as to what constitutes an Australian production. For this reason, it has not been included in the top 8 below, but it is still definitely worth a watch.\n\n#8 THE LITTLE DEATH: Funny Foreplay Fuels Comedy Climax\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nThe title, which refers to an orgasm, is quite fitting for this riotous sex comedy that explores five couples’ weird sex fetishes. Similar to 2009 Aussie film My Year Without Sex, it lends itself more to being a TV sitcom, due to its episodic structure and characters you want to see more of. The witty script by debut writer/director Josh Lawson is cringe-inducing in the best possible way, and he builds the humour towards a hilariously awkward climax.\n\nAACTA Nominations (2015): Best Lead Actor (Damon Herriman), Best Lead Actress (Kate Box), Best Supporting Actor (Patrick Brammall), Best Supporting Actor (TJ Power), Best Supporting Actress (Erin James) & Best Supporting Actress (Kate Mulvany).\n\n#7 WOLF CREEK 2: Stylish Subversive Slasher Sequel\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nMessing with the horror convention in a similar way to Hostel 2, this film cleverly places serial killer and Aussie legend Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) in the sympathetic main role, so the audience now colludes in the murder and mayhem. While further exploring our cultural xenophobia, excellently constructed truck and car chases reminiscent of Terminator 2 give way to a “Who Wants to be a Millionaire” style quiz. If you want to live, you’d better know your Aussie history and pop culture!\n\n#6 THE TURNING: Winton Weaves Melancholic Tapestry of Australiana\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nSimilar in tone to Lantana, this collection of 17 short films is based on Tim Winton’s novel of the same name. Each vignette is helmed by a different director, including Justin Kurzel (Snowtown) and Warwick Thornton (Samson and Delilah) and it features many of our most loved stars in front of, and behind the camera. Though overlong at three hours, and occasionally disjointed due to its nature, it’s nevertheless an ambitious and rewarding portrait of regret, guilt and renewal.\n\nAACTA Awards (2014): Best Lead Actress (Rose Byrne)\n\nAACTA Nominations (2014): Best Picture, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Lead Actor (Hugo Weaving) & Best Supporting Actress (Mirrah Foulkes)\n\n#5 THE BABADOOK: Slick Spooky Psychological Thriller\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nAn ominous children’s pop-up book, and the love/hate relationship between parent and child form what is essentially a two-hander involving a sleep-deprived, grief-repressed mother, and her antagonising, kooky kid. Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman turn in remarkable performances under the tight and masterful direction of debut writer/director Jennifer Kent. With notable sound design and editing, the film creates a memorable fable exploring our fears, anguish, and the monster of unresolved emotion\n\nAACTA Nominations (2015): Best Picture, Best Direction, Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Original Music Score, Best Production Design & Best Lead Actress (Essie Davis)\n\n#4 THESE FINAL HOURS: Apocalyptic Thriller Burns Bright\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nThis apocalyptic road trip thriller by debut director Zak Hilditch is a no-holds-barred, end-of-the-world, anarchic free-for-all. Unlike 2011’s slow-burning doomsday drama Melancholia, it opens at 9 out of 10 on the intensity scale and holds us there until its satisfying climax. Along the way we are witness to the extremes of humanity; depravity, despair, hedonism, hope, and integrity. With standout cinematography, lighting, sound design and special effects, it stands up to anything similar Hollywood can deliver.\n\n#3 CHARLIE’S COUNTRY: Gulpilil’s Travels\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nHighlighting our modern and ancient culture clash, Rolf de Heer directs seminal Australian Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil to 2014 Cannes’ Best Actor glory, in one man’s frustratingly sad, yet often comically absurd battle to live under occupied rule. Its funnier moments are reminiscent of The Gods Must Be Crazy, however when art imitates life (it’s based on Gulpilil’s experiences) the dramatic material is elevated to sublime meta brilliance, creating an affecting film that both challenges and inspires us.\n\nAACTA Nominations (2015): Best Picture, Best Direction, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound & Best Lead Actor (David Gulpilil)\n\n#2 THE INFINITE MAN: Eternal Sunshine and a Not-So-Spotless Mind\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nSet in a remote desert hotel under the blistering South Australian sun, Dean (Josh McConville) repeatedly and obsessively re-creates the perfect anniversary for his girlfriend, in an attempt to thwart her ex-boyfriend’s advances, and his own self-sabotaging behaviour. This surreal, hilarious and loopy rom-com (by writer/director Hugh Sullivan) is inventively original with one of the most convincing time travel scripts that rewards on repeated viewings.\n\n#1 TRACKS: A Mesmerising Memoir and Outback Odyssey\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nIn this true story of Robyn Davidson, a young woman who trekked solo across 2000 miles of outback desert in 1977, Mia Wasikowska embodies the spirit of our explorers, giving an emotionally and physically raw performance, as she faces the harsh landscape both externally and within. Stylistically belonging in our golden era of film-making (the 1970s), it was shot on film (not digitally) allowing cinematographer Mandy Walker (Lantana) to drench the shimmering vistas in warmer, richer tones.\n\nAACTA Nominations (2015) : Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design & Best Lead Actress (Mia Wasikowska)\n\nFULL LIST OF AACTA 2015 NOMINEES (Feature Film Categories)\n\nBest Picture\n\nThe Babadook\n\nCharlie’s Country\n\nPredestination\n\nThe Railway Man\n\nTracks\n\nThe Water Diviner\n\nBest Direction\n\nThe Babadook\n\nCharlie’s Country\n\nPredestination\n\nThe Rover\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\n52 Tuesdays\n\nThe Babadook\n\nCharlie’s Country\n\nThe Water Diviner\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nPredestination\n\nThe Railway Man\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nFell\n\nPredestination\n\nThe Railway Man\n\nTracks\n\nBest Editing\n\n52 Tuesdays\n\nThe Babadook\n\nPredestination\n\nThe Water Diviner\n\nBest Sound\n\nCharlie’s Country\n\nFelony\n\nThe Railway Man\n\nThe Rover\n\nBest Original Music Score\n\nHealing\n\nPredestination\n\nThe Railway Man\n\nThe Rover\n\nBest Production Design\n\nThe Babadook\n\nPredestination\n\nThe Rover\n\nThe Water Diviner\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nPredestination\n\nThe Railway Man\n\nTracks\n\nThe Water Diviner\n\nBest Lead Actor\n\nDavid Gulpilil – Charlie’s Country\n\nDamon Herriman – The Little Death\n\nGuy Pearce – The Rover\n\nRussell Crowe – The Water Diviner\n\nBest Lead Actress\n\nEssie Davis – The Babadook\n\nKate Box – The Little Death\n\nSarah Snook – Predestination\n\nMia Wasikowska – Tracks\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nPatrick Brammall – The Little Death\n\nTJ Power – The Little Death\n\nRobert Pattinson – The Rover\n\nYilmaz Erdogan – The Water Diviner\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nErin James – The Little Death\n\nKate Mulvany – The Little Death\n\nSusan Prior – The Rover\n\nJacqueline McKenzie – The Water Diviner\n\nBest Visual Effects or Animation\n\nThe LEGO movie\n\nWalking With Dinosaurs 3D\n\nThe Water Diviner\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past\n\nIn Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 thriller The Birds, sophisticated socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), takes a drive out to Bodega Bay; an isolated, coastal community, in order to deliver a couple of lovebirds to lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in a tit for tat prank. Her silly little venture quickly turns sinister, however, when she is attacked by a seagull whilst delivering the lovebirds. This becomes the first attack of many in which huge flocks of various species of birds descend upon the people of the town, and proceed to scratch and bite them to death. At first there is a lot of cynicism surrounding the behaviour of the birds amongst the townspeople as no one can fathom why the birds would suddenly act in this manner, and therefore many believe that the attacks others speak of are simply an exaggeration. It is not until countless birds invade the central part of town, and commence to tear down buildings that there is widespread acceptance of the fact that there is a serious epidemic. Melanie and Mitch band together during this troubling time, and take refuge in the home of Mitch’s mother, Lydia Brennan (Jessica Tandy) with Mitch’s younger sister Cathy Brenner (Veronica Cartwright), but will they survive the bird attacks as they completely take over the entire bay?\n\nWhen I watched The Birds for the very first time, I must admit that I was quite disappointed by its narrative, and could not understand how it managed to reach higher levels of fame than some of Hitchcock’s earlier films, such as Strangers On A Train (1951). After other later viewings, however, the penny started to drop, and I began to recognise the brilliance of this film.\n\nHitchock’s signature visual style is as alive as ever in this film with the inclusion of carefully composed shots of particular details that significantly impact the mood of the film as a whole. One shot which is particularly memorable is a close up of a wheel slowly turning as a car eases forward between a mass of birds that have entered a state of calm after a recent attack. In one shot Hitchcock is able to place the viewer on tenterhooks; prior to this scene it has demonstrated that the bird attacks come in cycles, thus as the car disturbs the presently tranquil birds, the likelihood of an attack increases dramatically, and the audience is left in anticipation.\n\nIt is visual storytelling techniques such as this which are predominantly responsible for creating the dark and suspenseful tone of the entire film. Unlike Psycho (1960), which relies heavily on music to thrill the audience, The Birds contains no musical score whatsoever. Additionally, whilst Psycho contains many tense opening scenes that gradually build to a crescendo in the third act, The Birds opts for a lighter start with comical interactions between Melanie and Mitch. It is not until the very first bird attack upon Melanie that this mood starts to take a dark turn. This shift in tone was the idea of screenwriter Evan Hunter who Hitchcock brought in to adapt the original source material; a novella of the same name written by Daphne Du Maurier. Whilst Hitchock has been inspired by Du Maurier’s work before with his 1940 film Rebecca, the only similarity between his film and her short story is the concept of bird attacks. Apparently Transformers director Michael Bay is set to produce a remake of The Birds in which more of an emphasis will be placed on Du Maurier’s original storyline. I cannot understand why any filmmaker would see the need to touch any of Hitchcock’s classic films, but that is another matter all together.\n\nThe Transformers films are renowned for impressive special effects and excessive action sequences, therefore with Michael Bay at the helm of this remake it is logical to expect an overload of CGI at the expense of other elements in the film. Interestingly, Hitchcock approached the source material in a similar way in the sense that he chose to emphasise the birds over the human characters. In a behind the scenes documentary Rod Taylor admits that he was originally concerned that the performances would be lost to the special effects, but then he eventually realised that this was thepoint of the film. Evan Hunter also makes a comment in this documentary that the film is more of a mood piece than a traditional narrative, and I think this is what put me off the film initially. The birds in the film don’t only take over Bodega Bay, they also take over the entire story, to the point where the relationships between the characters (which have been so well developed up until the commencement of the third act) tend to be forgotten, and there is a lack of closure at the end of the film. Sometimes a vague conclusion can be very effective; I thoroughly enjoyed this choice in Martin McDonagh’s 2008 film In Bruges, but I was left feeling a little unsatisfied at the end of The Birds.\n\nEvan Hunter explains in the documentary that Hitchcock often explored the theme of a lack of appreciation for life, and that in The Birds it is not until the lives of the characters are significantly disrupted that they realise what they took for granted. I have also read that apparently Hitch chose not to superimpose the words “The End” over the final shot (as most films from that time did) as he wanted to put across the impression of never ending terror. Considering this, plus the idea of placing mood before narrative, the story structure makes a lot more sense, and although I would have preferred a stronger ending, I can certainly appreciate what Hitchcock was aiming to achieve.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s the effect of compositing two images together via use of a blue screen was becoming more and more popular, but due to fairly primitive technology, the effect was far from perfect. Light would often reflect off the blue screen and onto the subject, creating a blue halo around the actors when the screen was replaced with a background image. Nowadays computer programs can overcome these sorts of flaws, and films rely heavily on such software for all sorts of special effects, but one has to remember that Hitchcock pulled off The Birds without any of this technology. At the time of making The Birds Disney had perfected a new technique for compositing images in which the foreground was lit with one type of light, and the background with another, which allows for the same effect as a blue screen, whilst avoiding the dreaded blue halo. Hitchock employed this method for all of the bird attack scenes, and even though to the eye of the modern viewer it is quite obvious when some scenes have been shot in this manner (particularly the scene where Melanie takes a dinghy across a lake to reach the Brenner house), one cannot deny how well this effect was executed. Apparently the film includes a total of 370 effects shots, and the last shot is a composite of 32 separately filmed elements, which given when this film was made, is truly astounding.\n\nEven though the characters are placed second to these effects towards the end of the film, all of the actors deliver excellent performances throughout the entire duration of The Birds. Tippi Hedren was a model prior to bringing Melanie Daniels to life, and was discovered by Hitchcock through a particular beauty advertisement that used to air on television in between morning news programs. She certainly had one of the greatest acting coaches in Hitchcock, which would have assisted her performance immensely, but even so, Hedren deserves full credit for her impressive feature film debut. Her chemistry with Rod Taylor is fantastic to watch, as are her strained interactions with the legendary Jessica Tandy. Tandy is hands down the stand out performer in the film; her experience on both the stage and screen is evident in her presence in every scene, and her ability to convey so much through just a look.\n\nWhilst I personally prefer Psycho and Strangers On A Train to The Birds, I still find this film to be utterly breathtaking, and am blown away by the fact that Hitchcock achieved this feat with such limited technology. Although perhaps not as horrific as it would have been when it was first released in 1963 (as audiences have become more exposed to violence and bloodshed in horror films), The Birds remains a chilling film that will certainly make you flinch the next time you hear a crow caw."
