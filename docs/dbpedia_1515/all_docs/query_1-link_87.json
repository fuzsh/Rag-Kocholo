        "text": "When a fast food chicken restaurant is built on the site of an ancient Native American burial ground, the displaced spirits unite with the ghosts of exterminated chickens and transform into Indian Chicken zombies seeking revenge! Now it's up to a dim witted counter boy, his lesbian ex-girlfriend, and a burqa wearing fry cook to put an end to the foul-feathered menace once and for all. A hilarious mix of social satire, extreme gore, and hauntingly catchy musical numbers, this film is the most gut busting and outrageous movie!
