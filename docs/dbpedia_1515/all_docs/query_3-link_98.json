        "text": "We all have Netflix. If you don’t have Netflix then it’s probably because you don’t have internet. If you don’t have internet – how the hell are you reading this? Anyway, I always hear friends and acquaintances tell me that there are no good horror films on Netflix. I know that there is a lot of junk on Netflix. In a sense it lowered the bar for filmmakers. Instead of terrible horror films going direct-to-video they now have an easier option: direct-to-Netflix. The roles have been reversed and these days more and more great horror films are bypassing theaters and opting for direct-to-video or Video-On-Demand releases. I am digressing though, as that discussion is for another day. Because of the apparent rarity of good horror on Netflix I decided to look for as many great/good/watchable genre films currently on streaming status and came across almost 200 titles for you. They will be ranked alphabetically under the category of their greatness. Let’s begin.\n\nTHEY DON’T GE BETTER THAN THIS (10/10)\n\nBattle Royale (2001)\n\n– Battle Royale remains one of the most incredible and shocking flicks I have ever seen. Full-frontal direction of an ambitious story, where the corrupt youth of Japan are sent to an island to kill each other off until only one remains, makes this an experience you will never forget…and one you need to be a part of.\n\nEvil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn (1987)\n\n– Sam Raimi’s follow-up to The Evil Dead continues the demonic onslaught against one of horror’s greatest heroes. The insanity is at its utmost in this gore-soaked slapstick experience, leaving you wanting more and wishing films like this still existed in our modern day. Read my full review for this film here: Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn\n\nHellraiser (1987)\n\n– You’ve probably seen this already. Watch it again. If you haven’t seen it, you’re in for one Hell of a treat. Read my full review for this film here: Hellraiser\n\nSe7en (1995)\n\n– Both Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs gained notoriety in the 90s for their expert portrayal of diabolical serial killers, but Se7en’s brutality separates the two. After Alien 3. director David Fincher earned his stripes with this effort, which he executes to perfection. With an all-star cast consisting of Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and the incredible Kevin Spacey as the “John Doe Killer”, Se7en is a film you must watch again and again…even if the climax makes you sick to your stomach. Read my full review for this film here: Se7en\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\n\n– This two-hour film is worth watching for Anthony Hopkins’ 16 minutes of screen time alone. Read my full review for this film here: The Silence of the Lambs\n\nALMOST PERF (9/10)\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula (1992)\n\n– Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather series) directs this adaptation of Bram Stoker’s romance-themed horror film and gives us a visual masterpiece. Gary Oldman stars as Dracula, is accompanied by a solid cast, including Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, Carl Elwes, Tom Waits, and Monica Bellucci. Read my full review for this film here: Bram Stoker’s Dracula\n\nDay of the Dead (1985)\n\n– The final installment of George A. Romero’s initial Dead trilogy, Day platformed the zombie sub-genre in ways that had yet to be done. The zombies evolved, the gore was absolutely amazing, and as usual Romero’s social commentary was heavy – this time centering on the Cold War, apocalypse, and nuclear destruction. Read my full review for this film here: Day of the Dead\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn (1996)\n\n– You’ve probably seen Robert Rodriguez’s titty-twisting epic vampire tale. It’s so good you should watch it again. Read my full review for this film here: From Dusk Till Dawn\n\nHellboy (2004)\n\n– The majority of us love super heroes, and we also love Guillermo del Toro. He brings us his pet project about a supernatural super hero who saves the world from monsters, demons, and anything else the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense would rather you not know about. Read my full review for this film here: Hellboy\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986/1990)\n\n– Before everyone knew him as “Merle from The Walking Dead”, Michael Rooker gave one of the greatest performances in horror history as Henry Ray Lucas in this amazingly merciless experience. This will leave a hole in your soul. Read my full review for this film here: Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\n\nLet The Right One In (2008)\n\n– This Swedish masterpiece based on the incredible novel made the #2 spot on my Best Horror Films of the Decade list. Adapted by the original author, this vampire love story shows us that there is nothing scarier than love itself. Let Me In is the American version of this story. Read my full review for this film here: Let The Right One In\n\nNever Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy (2010)\n\n– A four-hour documentary about the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series. The amount of knowledge gained in this series is incurable and includes many of the stars and filmmakers associated with the series, including many scenes of Wes Craven and Robert Englund themselves. Read my full review for this film here: Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy\n\nRe-Animator (1985)\n\n– I really like medical-themed horror, and Re-Animator blends this with…well, re-animation in awesome fashion. This gory, wit-fueled experience is one of my favorite films and a recommendation I make to everyone. Read my full review for this film here: Re-Animator\n\nRosemary’s Baby (1968)\n\n– Roman Polanski’s classic horror epic follows a young woman possibly carrying the child of Satan. Heavy in atmospheric and ever-present impending doom, this is one of the greatest horror films of all time. Read my full review for this film here: Rosemary’s Baby\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods (2012)\n\n– This is the greatest horror film of this decade so far. Joss Whedon is a man of many filmmaking talents and he pens an incredible, metaphysical story unlike any other horror film. Zombies, J-horror, slashers, creatures, and several other sub-genres all make their presence in this one film. Read my full review for this film here: The Cabin in the Woods\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920)\n\n– Credited as one of the earliest horror films, this 1920 silent German expressionist effort is a beautiful watch that I highly suggest to you. It is sometimes mentioned in zombie lore as the first, or one of the earliest, zombie films, an assertion often debated due to its somnambulist character. At the very least, give this a look for historical reasons. Read my full review for this film here: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nYOU’LL RECOMMEND THESE TO YOUR FRIENDS (8/10)\n\nAntichrist (2009)\n\n– Lars von Trier is no stranger to controversy, and Antichrist has plenty of it. It’s also beautifully shot and contains a story that’ll leave you thinking for days. Read my full review for this film here: Antichrist\n\nBay of Blood / A Bay of Blood (1972)\n\n– This is one of the earliest known slasher films. It’s a damn good watch from the most influential Italian director of all time, Mario Bava. Read my full review for this film here: Bay of Blood\n\nBlack Sabbath (1964)\n\n– Italian maestro Mario Bava’s 1964 anthology gives us three chilling tales, including a vampire short starring classic horror icon Boris Karloff. Read my full review for this film here: Black Sabbath\n\nBlack Sunday (1960)\n\n– The great Mario Bava’s 1960 film debut, where a vengeful witch returns from the dead to lead a bloody campaign to possess the body of a beautiful look-alike descendent. Read my full review for this film here: Black Sunday\n\nChillerama (2011)\n\n– Adam Green presents a maniacal 5 film anthology heavy in gore, lulz, Kane Hodder, werewolves, zombies, and the giant sperm (my size) seen above. This is 2 hours of maniacal fun that brings us back to the days of drive-in movie features.

Anderson directed this atmospheric masterpiece. Nonetheless, you need to see this, either again or for the first time. Read my full review for this film here: Event Horizon\n\nFright Night (1985)\n\n– This is a sweet vampire flick with that 80s feel I keep talking about. The 80s was a great decade for vampire films. Read my full review for this film here: Fright Night\n\nGrave Encounters (2011)\n\n– One of the best found-footage films of all time, The Vicious Brothers struck gold with their debut film. Read my full review for this film here: Grave Encounters\n\nHatchet II (2010)\n\n– This sequel continues the gore-soaked carnage delivered by Victor Crowley, the best killer of this millennium. You don’t necessarily have to see Hatchet before this, however the original is the best in the series. Read my full review for this film here: Hatchet II\n\nHumanoids from the Deep (1980)\n\n– This is one of my all time favorites. It starts off as an environmental awareness story that spirals out of control into a gore-fueled, nudity-laden sleaze fest. I will always recommend this to everyone I come in contact with – except my mother. Read my full review for this film here: Humanoids from the Deep\n\nIchi the Killer (2003)\n\n– Ichi the Killer is not devoutly horror, but it contains scenes so horrific that it is appreciated by genre fans all over. Takashi Miike, one of Asia’s greatest horror directors, delivers this tale about a Yakuza enforcer who discovers a deranged killer capable of delivering pain never thought possible.\n\nIdentity (2003)\n\n– This is one of my favorite films to play when I have friends over. It is a highly-engaging mystery “who-dun-it” that will keep you guessing until the very end…literally. With top-notch direction displaying enjoyable kills, and John Cusack leading the charge to find the killer, you can’t go wrong with Identity. Read my full review for this film here: Identity\n\nJohn Dies at the End (2013)\n\n– This title is awesome. It’s also based on a hip novel and comes directed by one of the genre’s most beloved directors, Don Coscarelli (Phantasm series, Bubba ho-tep). Zany, hilarious, unpredictable, and co-starring Paul Giamatti, you need to see this. Read my full review for this film here: John Dies at the End\n\nLeprechaun (1993)\n\n– The film that started Jennifer Aniston’s career, Warwick Davis AKA Wicket W. Warrick (the lovable Ewok) is the perfect choice to portray this evil Irish munchkin seeking vengeance from those who possess his gold. It’s cheesy, but good cheesy. Read my full review for this film here: Leprechaun\n\nManiac (2013)\n\n– No. 9 on my Top 10 Horror Movies of 2013, this “remake” of the 1980 classic is nothing like the original and should stand as its own movie. Elijah Wood gives a tremendous performance that will shock viewers, especially those who would never expect to see him portray such a disturbed character. On top of this, good writing and execution from the filmmakers behind High Tension made this one of the creepiest films of recent time. Read my full review for this film here: Maniac\n\nMimic (1997)\n\n– Guillermo del Toro’s first American film is one of my favorites because it involves horror and my field of study: biology. Throw in a heavy creature element set in a spooky sewer / subway system and you have an atmospheric winner from one of the genre’s greatest directors. Yes, I know he hates what the producers did to this film. We still love it. Read my full review for this film here: Mimic\n\nNight of the Creeps (1986)\n\n– There really is nothing like cheesy (but good) 80s horror, and Night of the Creeps is a perfect example. No college fraternity is safe from keg stands or this alien parasite that turns them into zombies. If you liked Slither then you will love the film it mimicked. Read my full review for this film here: Night of the Creeps\n\nPoultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (2008)\n\n– Words cannot describe the insanity seen in Poultrygeist. Zombie chickens lay waste to unsuspecting staff and patrons of a shady fried chicken eatery. In other words, watch this immediately and experience the lulz. Read my full review for this film here: Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead\n\nScream (1996)\n\n– Wes Craven, still reeling the success of the A Nightmare on Elm Street series, created another monster with Scream. A self-aware pseudo parody of slasher films, Scream makes it fun to feel like a teenager again. Read my full review for this film here: Scream\n\nStake Land (2011)\n\n– I am admittedly not very big on vampire films, but I absolutely love Stake Land. Director Jim Mickle has since directed the We Are What We Are redo and the Cold in July adaptation – all fantastic works. Throw in Nick Damici as the lead and you cannot go wrong. I highly recommend this. Read my full review for this film here: Stake Land\n\nStitches (2013)\n\n– Killer clowns and the genre go hand in hand, but at the same time only a handful of these films are good. Stitches is one of the very best and a received a Top 10 nod in 2013. It’s heavy in spooky atmosphere and vengeance-fueled gory kills delivered by the best killer clown I have ever seen. Highly recommended. Read my full review for this film here: Stitches\n\nThe Host (2007)\n\n– South Korea loves its horror but it wasn’t until The Host made waves in 2007 that the world realized it. The effects are amazing, the story engaging, and director Joon-ho Bong delivers one of the best creature films there is. Read my full review for this film here: The Host\n\nThe Legend of Hell House (1973)\n\n– In the vein of The Haunting (original 1963 version) and House on Haunted Hill. If you’re in the mood for a classic haunted house film you must give this a watch. Read my full review for this film here: The Legend of Hell House\n\nThe Stuff (1985)\n\n– Genre legend Larry Cohen not only delivers great horror, via practical effects and full-frontal direction, but does so providing great social commentary on mankind’s blind consumption of unhealthy (literally crap) products. This experience is a crazy one. Read my full review for this film here: The Stuff\n\nTroll Hunter (2011)\n\n– One of the best horror films this decade, this Norwegian flick follows a documentary crew filming mysterious bear killings plaguing a small town. Little do they know, the bears are not being killed by a rogue human hunter, but gigantic trolls the authorities have been trying to keep secret. The visuals will leave you in awe. Read my full review for this film here: Troll Hunter\n\nVisiting Hours (1982)\n\n– A highly tense story pitting a mouthy journalist against her crazed stalker (portrayed by Michael Ironside). When he learns that she survived his initial attack, he makes an overnight visit to the hospital to finish her off. Great direction makes this a worthy watch and one of my favorite early 80s slasher films. Read my full review for this film here: Visiting Hours\n\nWolf Creek 2\n\n– The first film made waves in the genre back in 2005, and much to my surprise filmmaker Greg McLean returned 9 years later with a sequel even more terrifying than its predecessor. This is one of the absolute best horror films of 2014 so far. Highly recommended. Read my full review for this film here: Wolf Creek 2\n\nYou’re Next\n\n– It was a shame that Adam Wingard (V/H/S, V/H/S2, The Guest)’s film sat on the shelves for a few years before being released theatrically in 2013, but now you can watch one of the sweetest modern day slasher films out there. Not only do the killers wear animal masks like members of lame-wave bands, but the soundtrack is ironically one of my favorite element. Read my full review for this film here: You’re Next\n\nZodiac (2007)\n\n– David Fincher directs a notable cast, including Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr., in this 2.6 hour effort based on the true story of the Zodiac Killer. Read my full review for this film here: Zodiac\n\nYOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH… (7/10)\n\n100 Bloody Acres (2013)\n\n– This is a simple but pretty fun adventure about two brothers who collect roadkill and use it as a secret ingredient in their incredible fertilizer. Little does anyone know, their favorite additive is human flesh. Read my full review for this film here: 100 Bloody Acres\n\nAll The Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006/2013)\n\n– This female-driven slasher film starring Amber Heard sat on the shelves for 7 YEARS, from 2006 until 2013. In that time director Jonathan Levine directed three other films, including Warm Bodies. Now that it’s available to the masses you NEED to see this. Read my full review for this film here: All The Boys Love Mandy Lane\n\nAmerican Mary (2013)\n\n– One of my favorite horror films of 2013, the twin writing/directing Soska sisters struck gold with American Mary. The story involves the medical field, body modification, and stars my all-time favorite actress who is also my teenage / adulthood crush, Katharine Isabelle. Watch this ASAP. Read my full review for this film here: American Mary\n\nAmerican Psycho (2000)\n\n– I honestly prefer the Misfits song to this movie of the same name, but you can’t deny Christian Bale’s tremendous performance and the millions of internet memes it inspired. Thanks to Mary Harron’s direction this is also considered one of the best female-directed horror films. Read my full review for this film here: American Psycho\n\nAmityville II: The Possession (1982)\n\n– The original gets all the love, but this sequel gets the glory. It is not common for a sequel to surpass its predecessor, but Amityville II blows the original away in every element. It is actually scary, for one, and it gives us live-action demon horror in the vein of The Evil Dead. This is one of the most under-appreciated horror films there is. Read my full review for this film here: Amityville II: The Possession\n\nBad Milo (2013)\n\n– In what feels like a modern day Basket Case, Bad Milo follows an average guy living an average life, except for the demon growing within his anus. This film is insane, and I’m still laughing at how true the end of the first sentence is. Read my full review for this film here: Bad Milo\n\nBelow (2002)\n\n– If there is one place I’d rather not be with a deadly ghost on the loose, it would be a submarine. Written by Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan), this is an under-appreciated atmospheric spook-fest. Keep an eye out for Zach Galifianakis as Weird Wally. Read my full review for this film here: Below\n\nBerberian Sound Studio (2013)\n\n– A horror film told from the inside, where a sound engineer working on an Italian giallo (I love them and so should you) experiences psychological terror stemming from his work. I have recommended this flick to many due to its unique perspective. Read my full review for this film here: Berberian Sound Studio\n\nBig Ass Spider (2013)\n\n– From Mike Mendez (The Gravedancers), Big Ass Spider is a hilarious film where a lackluster exterminator (Greg Grunberg) is the only hope at stopping a giant spider laying waste to Los Angeles. Read my full review for this film here: Big Ass Spider\n\nBirth of the Living Dead (2014)\n\n– A solid documentary on the filming and impact of the 1968 classic that started the zombie craze, Night of the Living Dead. Starring icon George A. Romero. Read my full review for this film here: Birth of the Living Dead\n\nBlack Death (2011)\n\n– Set in medieval times, this Sean Bean-starring effort from the awesome Michael Smith centers on a group of knights investigating a pagan village that has reportedly been unaffected by the bubonic plague. If you like religious/cult horror this is for you. Read my full review for this film here: Black Death\n\nBruiser (2000)\n\n– A interesting breakaway film from George A. Romero about a loser with with stealing friends and a cheating wife. One day he wakes up without a face, and with this new identity he sees a grand opportunity to take revenge on those who have wronged him. The Misfits make an appearance as well. Read my full review for this film here: Bruiser\n\nCHUD (1984)\n\n– Heinous creatures lurk the sewers and lay waste to anyone who ventures beneath the surface. CHUD is one of my favorite 80s films and a solid creature feature. You already know. You love them or you don’t. Read my full review for this film here: CHUD\n\nCitadel (2013)\n\n– I really liked this dark, gloomy, and highly atmospheric horror/drama about a single father who must rescue his child from horrifying creatures living within an abandoned apartment complex. Director Ciaran Foy was recently tapped to direct Sinister 2. Read my full review for this film here: Citadel\n\nCockneys vs. Zombies (2013)\n\n– A simple but effected British horror/comedy about a retirement home under attack by a zombie invasion. It’s fun to watch slow-moving old people fight off slow-moving zombies. Read my full review for this film here: Cockneys vs. Zombies\n\nCreepshow 2 (1987)\n\n– Not as awesome as the first, but the first set a high bar. This is still one of the best horror anthologies of all time. Read my full review for this film here: Creepshow 2\n\nCropsey (2009)\n\n– A documentary about a grisly massacre that took place in what has been unofficially deemed “Cropsey’s Woods”. As children Zach and Barbara were told tales of a killer named Cropsey who lurked the neighboring woods where the murders took place. The duo now returns to the community to document whether the man charged with the crimes is the Cropsey that gave them nightmares as children. Read my full review for this film here: Cropsey\n\nDead Silence (2007)\n\n– Ventriloquists’ dummies – I don’t think there are many things scarier. From the guys behind Saw, you should expect a twist ending you won’t see coming. Read my full review for this film here: Dead Silence\n\nDead Snow (2010)\n\n– The first film to my knowledge to give us Nazi zombies (not to be confused with Nazi ghosts) and one of several Norwegian films on this list. The gore reigns heavy and the action rarely relents, making this great when you have friends over…as long as they can read subtitles. Read my full review for this film here: Dead Snow\n\nDeathwatch (2002)\n\n– A World War I themed ghost flick where British soldiers are hunted down by an unstoppable force, and it isn’t the Germans. Review coming soon.\n\nDetention (2012)\n\n– It’s been called a “hipster” horror film due to its unique (for a horror film) soundtrack consisting of Waaves and The Backstreet Boys. I call it Scream meets Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Hipster or not, I love this film. Director Joseph Kahn also directed the “Backstreet’s Back” music video. Read my full review for this film here: Detention\n\nDevil (2010)\n\n– Written by M. Night Shymalan and directed by John Erick Dowdle (As Above, So Below, Quarantine), Devil provides a claustrophobic experience where a group of strangers trapped in a stalled elevator realize one of them is a killer with supernatural abilities. I love nowhere-to-run scenarios like this one. Read my full review for this film here: Devil\n\nDoc of the Dead (2014)\n\n– Zombies are bigger than ever and this documentary explains how zombie culture became what it is today. Starring George Romero, Bruce Campbell, Tom Savini, and Simon Pegg, among many other notables. Read my full review for this film here: Doc of the Dead\n\nDread (2010)\n\n– Adapted from a Clive Barker story, Dread follows a college student preparing his thesis on people’s biggest fears, and goes to terrifying lengths to achieve his data. Read my full review for this film here: Dread\n\nDust Devil (1993)\n\n– Australian horror – simple and effective thanks to a great antagonist and steam punk director Richard Stanley(Hardware)’s direction. Read my full review for this film here: Dust Evil\n\nFrankenstein’s Army (2013)\n\n– I regret taking as long as I did to become a part of this spectacular experience. Set during the final stages of World War II, Russian soldiers meet their match when the struggling German army they expected to find has been replaced with an undead army of fallen Nazis pieced together by a descendent of Dr. Frankenstein. This flick, soaked in gore, is adorned with steam punk-influenced antagonists that make for a thrill I love to revisit. Read my full review for this film here: Frankenstein’s Army\n\nFido (2007)\n\n– A clever zombie comedy where the living dead can be productive members of society thanks to a domestication collar…so long as no malfunctions occur. Read my full review for this film here: Fido\n\nGrabbers (2013)\n\n– An awesome Irish flick about a sleepy seaside town that comes under siege by large creatures from another realm. This is a fun experience with good laughs and great creatures. Read my full review for this film here: Grabbers\n\nHannibal (2001)\n\n– Hannibal Lecter returns in this sequel to Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. It’s not as good as the others but still delivers thanks to good direction from Ridley Scott, as well as acting performances from Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman. Read my full review for this film here: Hannibal\n\nHansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013)\n\n– Heavy in action and gore, this film about a brother/sister witch hunting duo is more fun than I would have expected. You can turn off you brain for a while and enjoy the flick’s straight-to-the-point approach, which focuses on what matters most. Read my full review for this film here: Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\n\nHatchet III (2013)\n\n– After directing the first two installments, Adam Green graciously allowed his longtime cinematographer to direct the final chapter of the Victor Crowley vengeance saga. While it doesn’t live up to its incredible predecessors it still builds on the elements fans of the series know and love: live-action gore, Victor Crowley, and more live-action gore. Read my full review for this film here: Hatchet III\n\nHere Comes the Devil (2013)\n\n– A Mexican horror film where a vacationing couple’s two children disappear while exploring a mountain and mysteriously reappear the next day. It is obvious something is “different” about them, and the parents will soon learn the terrible events that look place on the forbidden rock. Read my full review for this film here: Here Comes the Devil\n\nHorns (2014)\n\n– Horns was one of the most hyped horror films of 2014, and rightfully so. Alexandre Aja, one of the genre’s favorite directors, returned to direct Daniel Radcliffe in what many assumed would be the most badass role he has ever taken on. I personally feel that this flick was overhyped and actually, a bit tame in comparison to its awesome trailers, but nonetheless this is a worthy watch for those who want to see Radcliffe do something “out there”. Read my full review for this film here: Horns\n\nHouse (1986)\n\n– Cheesy 80s fun. I miss films like this. Read my full review for this film here: House\n\nI Sell the Dead (2009)\n\n– This is a great Burke and Hare-inspired film (in other words it’s about grave-robbing) told in a comic book fashion. Director Greg McQuaid (V/H/S) broke onto the scene with this hip project, which stars Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings), Ron Perlman (Hellboy), horror director Larry Fessenden, and horror icon Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). Give this one priority over others. Read my full review for this film here: I Sell the Dead\n\nJack’s Back (1988)\n\n– This 80s flick centers on a LA-based serial killer who celebrates Jack the Ripper’s 100th birthday by committed similar gruesome murders. The story alone was enough to have me hooked. Read my full review for this film here: Jack’s Back\n\nKidnapped (2011)\n\n– This Spanish horror film is gut-wrenching. No holds are barred here. Watch it, feel sick, and hate me later. Read my full review for this film here: Kidnapped\n\nManhunter (1986)\n\n– This is Red Dragon before Red Dragon and pre-dates The Silence of the Lambs. Yes, Anthony Hopkins was not the first to portray Hannibal Lecter. It was the incredible Brian Cox. If you like the Lecter films you’ll enjoy this one and experience a different cast. Read my full review for this film here: Manhunter\n\nMindhunters (2005)\n\n– FBI profilers are killed off one by one in a deadly game with a serial killer. It looks cheesy, because it is, and you’ll like it thanks to good execution from Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4). Read my full review for this film here: Mindhunters\n\nMonsters (2010)\n\n– Gareth Edwards’ (Godzilla) debut horror film, Monsters is a dramatic horror flick about a couple who’s vacation in Mexico goes awry when giant alien monsters invade. Read my full review for this film here: Monsters\n\nNew Year’s Evil (1980)\n\n– I love holiday-themed slasher films, and New Year’s Evil is one of the most underrated alongside Christmas Evil. Watch them both and be amazed. Read my full review for this film here: New Year’s Evil\n\nOdd Thomas (2014)\n\n– This Stephen Sommers’ (Deep Rising, The Mummy) adaptation of Dean Koontz’s supernatural crime-fighting novel. It’s not very scary but it’s fun. Read my full review for this film here: Odd Thomas\n\nPhantoms (1998)\n\n– A very 90s horror film adapted from the Dean Koontz novel of the same name. It stars Ben Afflec, Live Shreiber, Rose McGowan, Peter O’toole, and creatures not of this world. Read my full review for this film here: Phantoms\n\nPontypool (2010)\n\n– Set in a radio station with nowhere to run, a unique method of contamination makes this a unique zombie film. Read my full review for this film here: Pontypool\n\nRagnarok\n\n– I love Norwegian horror, and I love creature features, so I enjoyed Ragnarok. The film is equal parts adventure film as it is horror flick, with the adventure aspect controlling the first 45 minutes and the horror closing out the show. At PG-13 and with no on-screen deaths, this could pass for some as a “family” film. Don’t let the family tag fool you though, I liked it. Read my full review for this film here: Ragnarok\n\nRavenous (1999)\n\n– One of the few notable horror films directed by a woman, this tense horror/thriller stars the versatile Guy Pearce in a disturbing tale about cannibalism. Read my full review for this film here: Ravenous\n\nRed State (2011)\n\n– Kevin Smith’s first horror film stars the incredible Michael Parks as the leader of a fundamentalist church that lures sinners to their deaths.\n\nReturn to Horror High (1987)\n\n– A young George Clooney makes his feature film debut here, where a movie crew recreating a high school slaying watches history repeat itself as the crew is killed off by an unknown killer. It’s cheesy 80s fun with good kills. Read my full review for this film here: Return to Horror High\n\nRigor Mortis (2014)\n\n– After a long hiatus I revisited my love for Asian horror and was very pleased with this Hong Kong film. You won’t believe this comes from a first-time director. The horror is good, the action is great, and the cinematography is absolutely amazing. This is worth a watch for the visuals alone, or if you are a fan of the Mr. Vampire films of the 1980s. If you know them then you’ll know why. Read my full review for this film here: Rigor Mortis\n\nRites of Spring (2011)\n\n– A pagan ritual ruins what would have been the perfect heist. I love films like this where criminals become the victims. Read my full review for this film here: Rites of Spring\n\nRubber (2011)\n\n– I know this is going to sound pretty insane, unless you seen the film, but this unique effort about a killer tire is pretty good and a fun experience. Read my full review for this film here: Rubber\n\nScream 4 (2011)\n\n– Wes Craven returned to the Scream series after a 10 year hiatus and gave us an entry that makes up for the sour Scream 3. Much like the other films, this self-aware flick comes with the usual notable cliches, laughs, and a twist ending. Read my full review for this film here: Scream 4\n\nSlugs (1988)\n\n– Here is a classic late 80s horror film about killer mutant slugs eating the residents of a small town. It’s a silly idea that is well-executed with loads of gore. Read my full review for this film here: Slugs\n\nSugar Hill (1974)\n\n– I love vengeance films, and in Sugar Hill a woman summons a powerful demon to attack the mob that killed her boyfriend. She only has one other demand for the demon: give her a front row seat to the action. Read my full review for this film here: Sugar Hill\n\nThe Bay (2012)\n\n– Barry Levinson, a non-horror director known for Rain Man and Good Morning, Vietnam, directs this found-footage film that includes an antagonist never before seen in the genre. As convoluted as the found-footage sub-genre is I always appreciate something new. Read my full review for this film here: The Bay\n\nThe Caller (2011)\n\n– A supernatural mystery tale about a divorcee being harassed by phone calls from a creepy woman claiming to be calling from the past. Read my full review for this film here: The Caller\n\nThe Conspiracy (2013)\n\n– A found-footage film where two documentary filmmakers investigating conspiracies find horror they never imagined when they stumble upon an ancient and dangerous secret society. The payoff is not what you’ll expect. Read my full review for this film here: The Conspiracy\n\nThe Deaths of Ian Stone (2007)\n\n– This is what I feel to be the best of the original original After Dark horror films that debuted as Horrorfest 2007. What makes this flick so great is its insane storyline, where every day Ian Stone wakes up in a different life and is brutally murdered, only to repeat the same thing when he awakens again. The flick is heavy in CGI but still delivers great antagonists and is adorned with solid kills. If you enjoy films like Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow then this is worth a watch. Read my full review for this film here: The Deaths of Ian Stone\n\nThe Den (2014)\n\n– If you have ever video chatted you need to see The Den. It’s not perfect, but it uses modern day social technology to deliver some good jolts. Read my full review for this film here: The Den\n\nThe Devil’s Carnival (2012)\n\n– Darren Lynn Bousman is one of the genre’s best directors, and he had his fun with The Devil’s Carnival – a musical where the dead are faced with the sins that landed them in Hell. Read my full review for this film here: The Devil’s Carnival\n\nThe Fourth Kind (2009)\n\n– Whether you believe in them or not, in this case aliens are real and they gave me goosebumps. Starring Mila Jovovich as a psychologist studying the odd sleep patterns of the residents of Nome, Alaska – a hotbed for alien abductions and missing persons. Read my full review for this film here: The Fourth Kind\n\nThe Gift (2001)\n\n– This under-appreciated sleeper from director Sam Raimi is written by Billy Bob Thornton and comes loaded with an A-list cast, including Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear, Hilary Swank, Gary Cole, J.K. Simmons and famed composer Danny Elfman. Read my full review for this film here: The Gift\n\nThe House of the Devil (2009)\n\n– Ti West’s babysitter-themed horror/mystery set in the 1980s is an atmospheric slow-burner that kicked off his career. Read my full review for this film here: The House of the Devil\n\nThe Hole (2001)\n\n– This is a great who-dun-it thriller starring Kiera Knightly, where four teenagers discover a secret underground bomb shelter and throw weekend-long party in it while their classmates are on a field trip. Little do they know, their weekend of fun and boozing will become a weekend of terror when they become stuck inside. Read my full review for this film here: The Hole\n\nThe Hole (2012)\n\n– This is one of my favorite films from 2012, however it sat on the shelf for 3 years after being completed in 2009. That happens too often these days, where great horror films like Trick ‘r Treat and You’re Next sit in purgatory while crap is released nationwide. Anyway, Joe Dante returned to the genre after 19 years (since Gremlins 2: The New Batch) to give us a chilling effort that’ll make you feel like a kid again thanks to its “family horror” feel. Don’t underestimate the film though, it’s full of spooks aimed at adults. The horror stems from a family that moves into a new home and discovers a locked door to a large hole in their garage. Boys will be boys, and upon unlocking the hole they release a supernatural entity that has been waiting to haunt again. If you have seen The Gate you’ll enjoy this. Read my full review for this film here: The Hole\n\nThe Horde (2010)\n\n– An awesome French zombie film where a group of rogue officers attempting to avenge the death of one of their own must now team with their enemies if they wish to survive an apocalyptic zombie invasion. This effort is heavy in gore and great action. Check it out. Read my full review for this film here: The Horde\n\nThe Horror Show (1989)\n\n– This movie kicks ass! Horror icon Lance Henriksen stars as a detective who finally nabs the elusive “Meat Cleaver Max”. He sits in on Max’s execution, but the electric chair only elevates Max to an even stronger killer and once again…the chase is on. Yeah it’s cheesy, and it is also one of the most underrated horror films there is. Read my full review for this film here: The Horror Show\n\nThe Human Centipede (2010)\n\n– One of the most hyped horror films of the decade. This Danish flick does the unthinkable and does it well. Read my full review for this film here: The Human Centipede (First Sequence)\n\nThe Initiation (1984)\n\n– An enjoyable slasher flick about a group of sorority “pledgers” who must break into a department store during rush week…where a killer is waiting for them. Read my full review for this film here: The Initiation\n\nThe Innkeepers (2011)\n\n– My favorite of Ti West’s films, this supernatural tale is one of the best horror flicks of 2011. It takes place during the final days of an old inn, where two employees seeking to expose the inn’s haunted past are visiting by old guests checking in for a final stay. Read my full review for this film here: The Innkeepers\n\nThe Nameless (1999)\n\n– The debut film of REC co-director/writer Jaume Balaguero, it debuted in 1999 in Spain but did not reach ‘Merica until 2005. Expertly executed, this is a dramatic story-driven horror/thriller from a master of horror. If you are a fan of films like Se7en then you will enjoy this. Read my full review for this film here: The Nameless\n\nThe Returned (2013)\n\n– This is a zombie film that offers a unique perspective – a “Return Protein” that allows the dead to return to society. However, things go awry when supplies of the drug run dry. Read my full review for this film here: The Returned\n\nThe Sacrament (2014)\n\n– Ti West’s most recent horror film is not what I was expecting it to be, but then again I went in “blind”. The suspense is good and he keeps you hooked on a slow-burning story that you will learn is based on a famed event of the past. If horror awarded Oscars (it does unofficially) Gene Jones would win for his performance as “Father”. Read my full review for this film here: The Sacrament\n\nThe Seasoning House (2013)\n\n– A very dramatic experience about the horrors of being forced into the sex trade – a rare topic for the genre. Stay tuned for my full review coming soon.\n\nThe Serpent and the Rainbow (1988)\n\n– Wes Craven delivers a voodoo tale starring Bill Pullman. This is one of his better yet more under-appreciated works. Read my full review for this film here: The Serpent and the Rainbow\n\nThe Shrine (2011)\n\n– An atmospheric piece packed with good chills when a group of nosy journalists investigating a cult stumble across horrors they were never supposed to see. This is a personal favorite of mine and comes from Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer auteur Jon Knautz. Read my full review for this film here: The Shrine\n\nThe Skeleton Key (2005)\n\n– I thought this supernatural film set in the bayous of Louisiana would suck but I was wrong. This is PG-13 horror done right. Read my full review for this film here: The Skeleton Key\n\nThe Town That Dreaded Sundown (1974)\n\n– This is one of the most under-appreciated horror films of all time. Based on a true story (“Texarkana Moonlight Murders” of 1946) about a killer slaying those who venture out at night in the sleepy town of Texarkana, we watch the cat and mouse game between Texas Ranger J.D. Morales and one of the most mysterious killers on record. Read my full review for this film here: The Town That Dreaded Sundown\n\nThe Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014)\n\n– This sequel to the 1974 classic is a joy to watch as it brings back the same look and feel of the original. Taking place 65 years after the original “Moonlight Murders” a new string of grisly deaths are shocking Texarkana. Could it be a copycat killer, or is something more sinister at hand? American Horror Story / Glee director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon does a fantastic job executing the horror here, which include some full-frontal kills that will please slasher fans and gorehounds alike. Read my full review for this film here: The Town That Dreaded Sundown\n\nThe Toxic Avenger (1984)\n\n– The one that put Troma on the map. This cheesy gore-soaked experience gives one of my favorite super heroes his silver screen debut. Read my full review for this film here: The Toxic Avenger\n\nThe Village (2004)\n\n– Fresh of the success of the awesome Signs, M. Night returned with The Village and moviegoers stormed theaters with high expectations. If you have seen the film then you know why countless patrons left disappointed. If you haven’t seen this, give it a watch. It’s still a good movie and will give you goosebumps on occasion.\n\nThe Ward (2011)\n\n– After a 9 year hiatus horror great John Carpenter returned with The Ward, a supernatural story I’ve seen a dozen times but one that stands above the rest thanks to Carpenter’s expert direction. It stars Amber Heard too. Read my full review for this film here: The Ward\n\nThe Woman (2011)\n\n– Jack Ketchum is a horror fiction novelist who has had several of his novels adapted to films, and The Woman is one of the most brutal. Directed by modern day veteran Lucky McKee, we see the consequences one overbearing family man experiences when he tries to domesticate the last surviving member of a rabid clan. Read my full review for this film here: The Woman\n\nTucker and Dale vs. Evil (2011)\n\n– This horror comedy came out of nowhere a few years ago and is still wildly appreciated by those who have seen it. In this case it’s cool to join the crowd. Read my full review for this film here: Tucker and Dale vs. Evil\n\nV/H/S (2012)\n\n– A modern day anthology that took the genre by storm, a slew of today’s young directors provide 6 tales (5 of them good) for the viewer to enjoy. If you are easily bored then an anthology is a good choice. Read my full review for this film here: V/H/S\n\nVHS 2 (2013)\n\n– This sequel gives us 5 more stories and improves on its predecessor. If you enjoyed the first you’ll enjoy this. Actually, regardless you’ll enjoy this. Read my full review for this film here: V/H/S 2\n\nWishmaster (1997)\n\n– Longtime effects guru Robert Kurtzman takes a shot at directing horror and finds success with this tale about a Djinn granting three wishes with an ulterior motive. Read my full review for this film here: Wishmaster\n\nWorld War Z (2013)\n\n– We knew this film adaptation of the popular novel was coming for years, and for the most part it lived up to expectations. Of course, that was a given with that Brad Pitt guy starring. Read my full review for this film here: World War Z\n\nMOSTLY POSITIVE (6/10)\n\n13 Sins (2013)\n\n– The US remake of the esteemed Thai film 13: Game of Death. The idea has been done before, but I still find it interesting when a strapped-for-class societal loser accepts extreme offers for large amounts of immediate cash, with each offer growing more intense. Read my full review for this film here: 13 Sins\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge\n\n– This sequel made the franchise what it is today after making more $$$ than the original – letting producers know they had a winning franchise on their hands. It’s not as good as its predecessor but it’s still a good watch and expands on Freddy Krueger. Read my full review for this film here: A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge\n\nAbsentia (2011)\n\n– This dark and moody piece is hailed by many for its unique story. Be sure and pay close attention if you give it a watch. Read my full review for this film here: Absentia\n\nAftershock (2013)\n\n– Three travelers in Chile have their vacation cut short by an immense earthquake. Surviving the earthquake is only half the battle, as an even deadlier foe awaits them. Horror director Eli Roth stars as one of the protagonists. Read my full review for this film here: Aftershock\n\nAll Cheerleaders Die (2014)\n\n– Two guys who have adapted Jack Ketchum novels into great films recreate their college film. I did not like this as much as others, but I dug the story of cheerleaders rising from the dead to seek revenge against the jocks who lead them to their graves. Read my full review for this film here: All Cheerleaders Die\n\nAlmost Human (2014)\n\n– Like many other films on this section of the list, it’s a basic story with one really good element. In the case of Almost Human it is the incredible kills. Read my full review for this film here: Almost Human\n\nAlyce Kills (2014)\n\n– It may not have fully lived up to the pre-release hype but Alyce Kills offers an interesting female-driven story. Read my full review for this film here: Alyce Kills\n\nAn American Ghost Story (2013)\n\n– This is not a good movie, but the scares and atmosphere are incredible in my opinion. It’s a simple ghost story where a writer intentionally moves into a haunted home for inspiration. Read my full review for this film here: An American Ghost Story\n\nAnaconda (1997)\n\n– I love killer animal films and this is one of my favorites as I have always loved big constrictors. With Ice Cube, J-Lo, starring you know to expect the usual clichés, and they are fun as hell here. Read my full review for this film here: Anaconda\n\nATM (2012)\n\n– Three co-workers are forced to hole up in a glass-encased ATM as a masked killer tries to make his way in. I like nowhere to run scenarios like this one. Read my full review for this film here: ATM\n\nBlood Glacier (2014)\n\n– The first horror film I have seen where the horror derives from climate change, as a melting glacier unleashes a long buried beast that will soon lay waste to the team of scientists hoping to prove climate change as a real phenomena. Due to its setting and creature element many have referenced John Carpenter’s The Thing when viewing this. Read my full review for this film here: Blood Glacier\n\nCabin Fever: Patient Zero\n\n– The third installment to the Cabin Fever series, comic book artist / director Kaare Andrews redeemed the series a bit after the poor Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever (so bad director Ti West disowns it). Heavy in gore and set in a nowhere-to-run scenario, the story also gives light to what started the heinous water-born virus. Read my full review for this film here: Cabin Fever: Patient Zero\n\nCandyman (1992)\n\n– Yeah I know. This film should be listed higher. Tony Todd’s voice alone makes this a worthy watch. Read my full review for this film here: Candyman\n\nCitizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV (2003)\n\n– The fourth installment of The Toxic Avenger series makes up for the mediocre second and third installments. Some even say this is the best of the series. Read my full review for this film here: Citizen Toxie\n\nDark Skies (2013)\n\n– Dark Skies surprised me because it was much creepier than I expected it to be. It won’t win any awards and won’t keep up with other recent alien visitation films like The Fourth Kind, but if you need a spooky alien flick then this might suffice. Read my full review for this film here: Dark Skies\n\nDead End (2004)\n\n– Ray Wise and genre vet Lin Shaye star in this horror / pseudo comedy where a nice gesture on a road trip proves to be a terrible idea. Read my full review for this film here: Dead End\n\nDevil’s Pass (2013)\n\n– A found footage flick where five young researchers document their investigation into the mysterious disappearances of a group of hikers in search of a mythical mystery. Read my full review for this film here: Devil’s Pass\n\nDNA (1997)\n\n– This is a straight-up cheesy creature feature. You love them or you don’t. I do. Read my full review for this film here: DNA\n\nEvidence (2013)\n\n– A cool concept where a team of investigators literally watch found-footage trying to catch a serial killer who laid waste at an abandoned gas station. Read my full review for this film here: Evidence\n\nEvolver (1995)\n\n– It’s not very scary, but I like the idea of a kid winning a killer robot as part of a virtual reality video game contest. Read my full review for this film here: Evolver\n\nExorcismus (2011)\n\n– A 15 year old’s seizures and violent outbursts leaves her in psychiatric treatment, but when her symptoms worsen a priest is called to exorcise her. Read my full review for this film here: Exorcismus\n\nFriday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)\n\n– One of my personal favorites of the series because of its awesome (and sometimes hilarious) kills. Read my full review for this film here: Friday the 13 Part VII: The New Blood\n\nGallowwalkers (2013)\n\n– Starring Wesley Snipes as an undead gunslinger, this western sat on the shelf for years before being released on DVD and Netflix. It’s not amazing, but it’s just cool as Hell to see Snipes donning western gear and a few Colt .45 six-shooters. Read my full review for this film here: Gallowwalkers\n\nHaunter (2013)\n\n– Vincenzo Natali’s third horror film, after Cube and Spliced, did not live up to my high expectations, but it could live up to yours. I have friends who claim this gave them nightmares. Read my full review for this film here: Haunter\n\nHellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992)\n\n– This one straight-up kicks ass. It abandoned the cult feel of the first two entries by employing a production aimed at appealing to the masses, yet it’s great effects and heavy metal-fueled soundtrack made it a cult classic of its own. Read my full review for this film here: Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth\n\nHellraiser IV: Bloodlines (1996)\n\n– Pinhead gets thrown into the future in this film about a descendent to the toymaker that brought Hell to Earth. Read my full review for this film here: Hellraiser IV: Bloodline\n\nInfection (2005)\n\n– Medical horror makes the list again in this Japanese horror film about the terrible consequences that arrive when a hospital team causes the death of a patient and falsifies the records to cover their asses. Read my full review for this film here: Infection\n\nInsidious: Chapter 2 (2013)\n\n– I expected more from this one in comparison to its incredible predecessor, but it’s still a haunting watch with a heavy emphasis on The Further. Read my full review for this film here: Insidious: Chapter 2\n\nInvasion (2007)\n\n– A found footage flick about a meteorite that delivers a deadly virus to a small town. Most of the film is told via a police vehicle’s dash cam. Full review coming soon.\n\nJug Face (2013)\n\n– A beautifully shot indie horror film about a backwoods community that goes to extreme lengths to appease a mythical beast living at the bottom of a pit. Read my full review for this film here: Jug Face\n\nKill List (2012)\n\n– This effort made waves in the genre when it debuted in 2012 but it did not appeal to me like it did to nearly everyone else. One could say this should be rated higher and I won’t argue that. It’s a dramatic effort for the extreme majority of the experience, but the payoff at the end is one of the best I have seen. Read my full review for this film here: Kill List\n\nKill Theory (2010)\n\n– A group of friends celebrating the end of the semester find themselves in a deadly game with a sociopath who forces them to kill each other in order to survive. Read my full review for this film here: Kill Theory\n\nMonkey Shines (1988)\n\n– George Romero’s film about a paraplegic’s killer pet monkey is far from the greatest of Night / Dawn/ Day of the dead, but it’s nice to see him do something different. Read my full review for this film here: Monkey Shines\n\nNightmare City (1983)\n\n– This crazy Italian “infected” movie from 1980 (released in the USA in 1983) is one of Quentin Tarantino’s favorite movies and where he got the name Hugo Stiglitz for Inglourious Basterds. Read my full review for this film here: Nightmare City\n\nNight Watch (2006)\n\n– An incredibly well-shot Russian fantasy horror flick where the forces that lurk daytime and nighttime go to battle. Read my full review for this film here: Night Watch\n\nProxy (2014)\n\n– One could argue whether or not this counts as a horror film, as the horror stems from the dramatic character play between several deranged individuals. Read my full review for this film here: Proxy\n\nQuarantine 2: Terminal (2011)\n\n– This sequel was much better than expected and leaves the protagonists holed up in an airplane terminal as the world around them falls to the “infected”.\n\nREC 3: Genesis (2012)\n\n– The first of the REC films to not be absolutely incredible. It’s still better than a lot of other junk out there. Read my full review for this film here: REC 3: Genesis\n\nResolution (2013)\n\n– An infie flick where a forced intervention from crystal meth and the terrible side effects are the source of horror, until things take an unexplainable turn for the worst. Read my full review for this film here: Resolution\n\nSaint Nick (2011)\n\n– I’ve said it before that I love holiday-themed horror, and this piece gives us St. Nicholas as an evil bishop who kidnaps and murders children when there is a full moon on December 5th. Read my full review for this film here: Saint Nick\n\nStorage 24 (2013)\n\n– When a military experiment is incidentally let loose upon the city of London, a city-wide lockdown leaves a group of friends trapped in a storage facility with one of the military’s most dangerous genetic weapons. This is a straight up creature feature. You love em or you don’t. Read my full review for this film here: Storage 24\n\nSurvival of the Dead (2010)\n\n– George Romero’s last ‘of the Dead film continues the evolution of the zombies he has been developing since the 1960s. Read my full review for this film here: Survival of the Dead\n\nThe ABCs of Death (2013)\n\n– This is the most colossal horror anthology of all time. 26 films delivered in about two hours. Some are really good, some are OK, and some are crap. Your best bet is to read my full review where I list each entry individually.\n\nThe Asphyx (1973)\n\n– An early 70s horror/sci-fi flick where the quest for immortality leads a scientist to capture a spirit represented in Greek mythology, The Asphyx. Read my full review for this film here: The Asphyx\n\nThe Awakening (2012)\n\n– Atmosphere is heavy in this British supernatural tale about a hoax exposer who must watch her beliefs (or lack thereof) fall apart when she confronts a supernatural force at a boarding school. Read my full review for this film here: The Awakening\n\nThe Bleeding House (2011)\n\n– A stranger with unfavorable intentions comes to spend the evening at a secluded home in the country, where the family he is staying with harbors a secret deadlier than his. Read my full review for this film here: The Bleeding House\n\nThe Collection (2012)\n\n– The obvious sequel to The Collection, the kills are crazier and the story expands exponentially. If you enjoyed the first you should enjoy this one. Read my full review for this film here: The Collection\n\nThe Final (2010)\n\n– If you love vengeance you may like this film about a group of outcasts who get even on those who persecuted them. Read my full review for this film here: The Final\n\nThe Fly II (1989)\n\n– The obvious sequel to the greatest “body horror” film of all time, the story follows the half-human son of The Fly and gives us one of the coolest kills in horror history. Read my full review for this film here: The Fly II\n\nThe Pact (2012)\n\n– Still struggling with the death of her mother, a woman’s past returns to haunt her when she visits her childhood home. Read my full review for this film here: The Pact\n\nThe Reeds (2010)\n\n– A group of young Londoners on a weekend boating adventure fall victim to a terrible secret hidden within the reeds. Read my full review for this film here: The Reeds\n\nTruth or Die (2012)\n\n– A vengeful tale where a game of Truth or Dare becomes Truth or Die. Read my full review for this film here: Truth or Die\n\nUnrest (2006)\n\n– My favorite film from the initial After Dark Horrorfest. It’s a spooky, medical-themed supernatural experience. Cadavers have never been scarier. Read my full review for this film here: Unrest\n\nWake Wood (2011)\n\n– A film genre peeps will say should be rated higher. In this effort a young girl’s grieving parents take on a pagan ritual that will allow them to spend three days with their deceased daughter. Giving her back will prove more horrific than they ever expected. Read my full review for this film here: Wake Wood\n\nWe Are the Night (2011)\n\n– A German female-themed vampire flick heavy in sensual flare. Read my full review for this film here: We Are the Night\n\nMEDIOCRE FILMS W/ GOOD HORROR\n\nHardware (1990)\n\n-Starring Dylan McDermott (American Horror Story) and Iggy Pop, this steampunk-influenced horror film has a die-hard following similar to Oakland Raiders fans. You could be one of them. Read my full review for this film here: Hardware\n\nHaunt (2014)\n\n– The atmosphere and ghosts sell the film. Everything else is basic, but if you like haunted house flicks then this may appease you. Read my full review for this film here: Haunt\n\nTorment (2014)\n\n– At least watch this until the iconic scene above occurs at the 24 minute mark. Read my full review for this film here: Torment\n\nThe Possession (2012)\n\n– Personally, I was not very fond of The Possession, but many other fans were and it has surprisingly good ratings. Read my full review for this film here: The Possession\n\nKeep in mind that there are MORE good horror films on Netflix. I just know it. There are quite a few I still need to see (We Are What We Are redo), including films I have never seen and films I have not seen in my adult life (The Prophecy), so peep this article on a regular basis to stay on top of what good horror is on Netflix. It won’t be easy, but I will do my best to keep this list a legitimate one where films are removed and added concurrently with those on instant streaming. Thanks for reading."
