        "text": "I have less to say on the other entries so I'm just gonna blast them out sans format because it's October 30th and I've another week's worth of writeups to do.\n\n20) Terror Firmer (1999)\n\nTroma goes meta, and makes a film with Troma co-founder and usual director Lloyd Kaufman playing a Troma director shooting a new Toxic Avenger sequel, while someone picks off the cast and crew. As such, it both parodies the general \"moral guardian\" reaction to Troma style films, and also parodies itself, so the nudity, slapstick, violence, bad taste and toilet humor is ramped up to eleven, dominating the movie while also being mocked as a crutch. Of course, invoking extra large amounts of smut as a joke still leads to a film with extra large amounts of smut regardless. There's some amusing meta jokes here and there, but it is a little aimless and over reliant on slapstick filling out scenes. Definitely the one most likely to offend someone's sensibilities.\n\n21) Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (2006)\n\nTroma in the Bush years, and also partly a musical. This was pretty weak. The basic Troma formula is there but the premise of haunted chicken creating zombies at a fast food joint doesn't really sustain the runtime. As such, the first half is padded out with random song numbers, and the second half with a lot of splatter gore, but it still runs out of steam well before the end. There was one line that made me cackle, a character who keeps having his name forgotten and having to remind the boss at one point says \"Denny! Like the country\", without elaborating. That kind of non sequitur reminds me of Zucker brother spoofs.\n\n22) Klown Kamp Massacre (2010)\n\nMore of a Troma adjacent film, this was distributed by them and features a Lloyd Kaufman cameo, but not produced by them. This one is a slasher spoof about a boot camp...for clowns. Where you learn to be a better clown. There's a lot of clowns; a character flips through TV channels with adverts, a political debate show, etc, but everyone in them is a clown.\n\nThere's some amusing clown gags, like a one clown in training spoofing the ICP instead of the traditional circus clowns like everyone. Now this one is cheap with a capital C, if they can afford capitals. It has that late 2000s shot on inexpensive digital look. But it's harmless, perfectly watchable.\n\n23) Father's Day (2011)\n\nA killer that kills fathers, on Father's Day. No relation to Mother's Day, also made by Troma way back when and was banned in the UK on release but was not put on the \"official\" list of of the so-called Video Nasties. That's kind of irrelevant trivia but barring doing a Video Nasty theme week which I don't have particular plans to do, when else would it come up? Anyway, this one starts out rather darker than most Troma films, which are mean but in an absurd manner; this one's just straight mean. However, once the protagonist shows up, it becomes much more silly and comedic. Despite this, there's kind of a tonal problem here. There's a whole lot of sexual violence directed at men featured, and not really in a played for laughs manner, but the rest of the film is goofball dialogue and parodic characters. Bit weird. It definitely went off the rails somewhere in the third act. Pretty decent 1980s slasher throwback score though, synths and stings everwhere.\n\nSo that is Tromania. I could have filled out the week with just the Toxic Avenger and Class of Nuke Em High sequels, but I wanted more of a broad selection over the decades.\n\n17. The Toxic Avenger (1984) Film of the Week\n\n18. Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986)\n\n19. Tromeo and Juliet (1996)\n\n20. Terror Firmer (1999)\n\n21. Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (2006) Dud of the Week\n\n22. Klown Kamp Massacre (2010)\n\n23. Father's Day (2011)\n\nI'm 3/3 this month on the first film of the week being Film of the Week, for some reason. Anyway, my last week has been my now regular final week for 31 Days where I catch up on some recent horror films I missed; Modern Malice Part III: The Final Chapter 3D.\n\n31 Days of Horror (2023) - The Torment of the Terrible Trios Continues...\n\nTrio 10 (Movies 28-30) In memoriam\n\nI like to work in some viewings to honour those in the horror world we lost throughout year, so this set is in memory of Julian Sands, Ruggero Deodato and Treat Williams. Instead of the obvious picks for Sands and Deodato that I haven't seen (Warlock and Cannibal Holocaust), I've decided to go with some more obscure choices. This is might be a bad idea, let's find out!\n\n28) Gothic (1986) (Oct 29)\n\n[In tribute to Julian Sands (1958-2023)]\n\nDirected by weirdo Ken Russell, Gothic is a fictionalized version of the what may have happened (and certainly didn't) during the Shelleys' visit to Lord Byron, that led to the writing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't really suit my tastes. The plot mostly consists of nightmares and delusions suffered by the characters and is just difficult to follow. Admittedly, I was really tired while watching it and struggling to stay awake by the end, but I honestly don't think my opinion would change much even if I did watch it under better circumstances. There's some nice visuals, Thomas Dolby's score is incredible, and I guess you could get some enjoyment out of the odd performances, but that's about it.\n\nOverall, the most interesting thing about Gothic, is that composer Thomas Dolby would later reuse quite a bit of his eccentric score from this film in the Sega CD FMV video game Double Switch, and that is by far the more enjoyable piece of entertainment. That's a piece of trivia you'll only get here, folks!\n\nPoor. 1.5 / 5\n\n29) The Washing Machine (Vortice mortale) (1993) (Oct 30)\n\n[In tribute to Ruggero Deodato (1939-2022)]\n\nOf course I found a way to work in just one more giallo. Ruggero Deodato didn't get around to directing any gialli until the later years of the subgenre. The Washing Machine was the last one he directed, and his second last full-length horror film in general.\n\nAnyone familiar with gialli will know how bizarre they started getting towards the end, and The Washing Machine is no exception. Unfortunately no, it's not about a washing machine that eats people. Drats! It's an erotic thriller with Deodato's touch, so you know it's gonna have some nastiness to it. I don't want to get into the plot, but there's the whole washing machine thing, and a fridge thing, and even an iron thing. This movie has a real weird appliance fetish!\n\nOverall, The Washing Machine is a strange little erotic thriller that's actually done pretty well, all things considered. And did I mention the killer Claudio Simonetti score?\n\nThe laundry isn't the only thing that's dirty. 3.5 / 5\n\n30) Deep Rising (1998) (Oct 30)\n\n[In tribute to Treat Williams (1951-2023)]\n\nI'm a big fan of Dead Heat, and Treat Williams is a big part of what makes that movie so much fun. He's just such a likeable lead, so I had to pay my respect to him by watching Deep Rising. Honestly, I don't think I've ever heard of it before picking my films last month, but I find horror movies from the late 90s pretty forgettable, so I might have just forgotten about it.\n\nThat's actually a bit of a shame, because Deep Rising was a lot of fun. The cast is great, and Treat lives up to his name by channelling his inner Kurt Russell. There's tons of fun little character bits that give everyone a lot of personality, and the writing is pretty witty for a big, dumb monster action movie.\n\nThe CG creature really sours it though. It doesn't look great, and the more of it you see, the worse it gets. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised about that though, considering the year it came out, and the fact that it's by director of The Mummy (1999).\n\nOverall, Deep Rising was a fun splash in the water with a great cast, but the CG monster really dates it.\n\nMoist, but not soggy. 3.5 / 5\n\nUp next: The Finale and Postmortem.\n\n29. Psycho - 5/5\n\nRewatch\n\nA Classic. Gets better with each viewing\n\n30. Psycho 2 - 3.5/5\n\nFirst Watch\n\nI said \"First Viewing\", but I actually watched this as a kid, but remembered absolutely nothing about it. I found it very interesting and I was engaged throughout. It genuinely felt like a fitting sequel to the original. It doesn't touch the first obviously, but does a nice job being it's own movie too, which sometimes fails sequels of classic movies. Definitely will be adding this to the rotation.\n\n31. Psycho 3 - 3/5\n\nFirst Watch\n\nI really enjoyed this one. It felt different to the first two, but had a really cool unique style. Anthony Perkins really nailed the direction in this and helps make it stand out.\n\n32. Friday the 13th: Part 3 - 3/5\n\nRewatch\n\nThis one is one of my least favorites and it's mostly on the characters. The only characters I cared for were the stoners lol. It's obviously important for the lore reasons too. Some of the 3D shots are so corny lol\n\n33. Friday the 13th: Part 4 - 4/5\n\nRewatch\n\nOne of the better sequels. In fact I'd rate it as my second favorite after Part 6. The characters in this were one of the better parts too. Having a family dynamic was a nice touch. Plus Crispin Glover was just perfect in this movie lol\n\n34. Friday the 13th: Part 5 - 2.5/5\n\nRewatch\n\nThe movie is fine, but always feels like the odd one out. It's definitely the most sleazy of the film's as the director did porn movies before this and it definitely shows. Still, it's not a bad movie, just a piss poor Friday the 13th movie for obvious (spoiler) reasons\n\n35. Friday the 13th: Part 8 - 2.5/5\n\nRewatch\n\nAnother less than sequel, but I have a soft spot for it. It's corny and has some stupid moments in it, but I can't help but like it a bit more than I should lol.\n\n36. Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - 3/5\n\nRewatch\n\nI've come around on this film lately. I still think it's one if my least favorites in the series, but it has some cool things about it that I appreciate more as I get older. One thing was the character of Jesse. He wasn't some macho kid who tried to \"man up\", he was scared at numerous times during the movie. His scream puts some scream queens to shame, but I'd be screaming too if I was in his position. The undertones of the film can't be ignored either and that's good too. Horror has always been a friend to the LGBTQ community and having this film be blatantly \"gay\" is a good thing imo\n\n37. Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - 3/5\n\nRewatch\n\nDefinitely not as good as 3, but it's a fun movie none the less. I kinda like how 3, 4 & 5 are connected. It helps flesh out the world and allows you to connect with some of the characters. Some of the supporting characters aren't too great tho, but they aren't awful or anything.\n\n38. Nightmare on Elm Street 5 - 3/5\n\nRewatch\n\nThis one was one I didn't like before, but have enjoyed it more with multiple rewatched throughout the years. Most of the characters in this are a vast improvement over the fourth. I didn't however care too much about the story. It's fine, but definitely one of the more hokey films in the series. Some really great kills in this one too. One of them was so cruel it is probably one of the most memorable deaths in the whole series.\n\n39. Freddy's Dead - 2/5\n\nRewatch\n\nThis one is the worst one, but the ending credits are awesome lol. The story is stupid and the movie just kinda ends. I would be pissed if this was the final movie in the series, but luckily New Nightmare exists and ends it on a much better note. Robert Englund was great in this tho. Definitely one of his more funny takes on Freddy. Felt like a cartoon character at times and that was one of the only highlights of the film.\n\nMovies I watched that I already posted about in last year's thread:\n\nNightmare on Elm Street\n\nNightmare on Elm Street 3\n\nWes Craven's New Nightmare\n\nFriday the 13th: Part 2\n\nFriday the 13th: Part 6\n\nFriday the 13th: Part 7\n\nI'll be back on Halloween night for two more movies. I'll also watch a few after Halloween too and post them in here (Ran out of time for everything lol)\n\nSince its 5 in the morning on Halloween, I'd like to wish everyone a Happy Halloween. Like I said above, I'll be back tonight with a few more reviews, so I'll wish everyone a happy halloween then too lol\n\nBatch #3 to finish out the month.\n\n#23 It follows.\n\nIt has a lot of style and good acting but I'm still not sure what to think about it. I'll put it at a 7/10.\n\n#24. I know What You Did Last Summer.\n\nIt was cheesy and campy as I expected but not so much as I expected a slasher from the 90's to be, it looses steam near the end and it has a great score and had a blast rewatching it so many years later. 7/10.\n\n#25. Indidious The Red Door\n\nUgh, the most unneeded sequels, nothing was really explained or went in to the lore, spooky Darth Maul still hangs out and they still haven't followed up on the cliff hanger of 3. 5/10.\n\n#26. The Nun II.\n\nI'm a sucker for the Conjuverse, way better than the first, well directed with some good effects. 7/10.\n\n#27. Jigaw.\n\nAll these years later and this is what they manage to scrap together? Saw 3D was decent compared to this. At least Toby gets paid. 6.5/10\n\n#28. American Psycho.\n\nFirst time watching this after seeing it refrenced all the time, holy cow. What a willd and bizarre ride, this was peak Christian Bale. 8/10\n\n#29. Saint Maud.\n\nMorfydd Clark can narrate anything and it can sound good, certainly a movie to think about and process, that ending sure leaves an impression. Wonderfully shot and acted. A good 8/10 from me.\n\n#30. Childs Play.\n\nAn all time classic, I forgot the films were called Child's Play and not just Chucky. 8/10.\n\n#31. Sister Death.\n\nA prequel that ties in to Veronica which I happened to have watched this October as well which was nice, fantastic film in the style of The Nun but done better. Highly reccomend it. 8/10.\n\nAnd that's been October! The first time I managed to complete the challenge and had a great time, can't wait for next year already.\n\nAlright, Halloween Day victory lap. Not a bad year, if I do say so. Probably won't watch many movies for a while now, since I've got a LOT of other stuff to catch up on now.\n\n42. The Thing (1982) *****\n\nWhat is there to say, really. This movie is just about perfection in my book. Effects are great, atmosphere, great. Literally just about everything is great. The only thing I don't absolutely love is like the last ten minutes (ending is good of course) but even then, they're not bad at all. There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said a million times.\n\n43. Evil Dead 2 (1987) *****\n\nAnother one that needs no introduction. Is it a perfect movie? No. But I think it's just about as close as it needs to be. There's no denying some of the effects are goofy (Linda's body being the standout example) but it's all part of the charm and they leaned into what they had to make everything work.\n\n44. Juon (2002) ****\n\nI realized on my rewatch that pretty much everything I thought was new or bad about the American remake actually was in the original. The hair CGI is worse in the reake though. I should have watched them closer together because as of right now I can't really think of anything that was actually new to the remake but somehow half of the original seems to have been cut out of it. I guess they spend more time epxloring the backstory because that seems to have been the thing to do at the time. The original doesn't mess with that as much. Quick scene at the beginning, some chatter from the cops, and then just everyone who so much as walks by the house is dead. Fun fact, I live not too far away from the actual house, but unfortunately it has been torn down now. Apparently, you used to be able to rent it out. So it goes. The ghosts are much bigger assholes here, and I think the reveal of their dynamic is actually much better done in the original.\n\n1. No One Will Save You 2023 (First watch) Rating: 7/10\n\n2.

Candyman 2021 (First watch) Rating: 7/10\n\n24. Zombieland: Double Tap 2019 (First watch)\n\n- A makeshift family goes trough internal struggles while trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. The cast is great and I really enjoy Woody Harrelson in these movies. The jokes are funny most of the time and the special effects are good. Story wise there's nothing too deep in it, but works well as Hollywood popcorn Zombie/Comedy. I think that most people who liked the original will like this too.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n25. Wyrmwood: Apocalypse 2021 (First watch)\n\n- A zombie apocalypse continuous in Australia. Decent acting, but pretty good special effects. I remember the first one being funnier. Decent plot. Some fun/interesting characters to follow. Overall a decent watch.\n\n26. Sissy 2022 (First watch)\n\n- Childhood friends re-unite after a decade and Cecilia/sissy is invited away on bachelorette weekend that also includes her former bully. The acting is pretty average. For a horror-comedy it's not that funny. The plot is pretty interesting. The special effects are somewhat hit and miss and the kills are pretty lame for a slasher. Overall a pretty average movie.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\n27. The Wind 2018 (First watch)\n\n- Mysterious incidents are happening to a woman in the harsh and lonely isolation of the untamed land in the 1800s. The performances are good, as is the story even tough the movie is a pretty slow in the beginning. There's also some really good dramatic elements. Not really a scary movie, but it does have a really good atmosphere. Overall a decent watch.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\n28. Antichrist 2009 (First watch)\n\n- A couple grieving their recently deceased child retreat to their cabin in the woods in hope to heal and fix their marriage. At the beginning I thought that this was going to end up being pretty pretentious, but when it really gets going it really is a effective art house horror film with some really good acting and some really beautiful imagery. A great movie.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n29. The Boogeyman 2023 (First watch)\n\n- An evil entity haunts a family that recently lost their mother. The acting is good and the creature design is really creepy. There are a lot of horror scenes that come at you with a pretty fast phase. The story works out well thematically. It's not necessary the most original horror movie of the year, but it's a really decent one.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\n30. Appendage 2023 (First watch)\n\n- The dark inner thoughts of a young woman manifest as a weird creature. Good acting and I really liked the design of the creature. The special effects are somewhat cheap, but work in a movie that is pretty likely influenced by the work of Frank Henenlotter. The movie manages to be funny at times. The movie is more weird than scary. Overall a decent film.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\n31. Hellraiser 2022 (First watch)\n\n- A young woman struggling with addiction comes into possession of a mysterious puzzle box that have the ability to summon the Cenobites. The performances are decent. The Cenobite designs and make up are great. The overall plot and story are quite good. Some good gore effects. I thought the voice of Pinhead was a little too overproduced. Overall a good comeback for the series.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nHappy Halloween🎃\n\nMovie #52 | Hell House LLC Origins: The Carmichael Manor, 2023\n\nMovie #53 | Brooklyn 45, 2023\n\n[Month So Far on Letterboxd]\n\nToday's double feature: New York ghost stories!\n\nFirst up - the new Hell House movie. Not high on my list but, fuck it, may as well complete the series while I'm here. Marginally better than the last two, but not anything to write home about; the clowns and cultists get less scary with every sequel.\n\nI mean, yes, the clown mannequins are creepy - but they work in the original because of the context of a haunted house attraction, a place where EVERYTHING is a spooky mannequin and you can't tell what is and isn't threatening. They don't make sense in dinner theater or generic scary mansions! They definitely don't make sense at a county fair, where a scary looking bald clown with bleeding eyes will NOT get you customers!\n\nThat being said, it's a competent found footage flick that balances the lore better than II or III; really liked that intriguing little nod to a masked production of Faust in the 80s. There are some creative scare sequences, like the photos in the video call, and we even get some spooky woods. Who doesn't love spooky woods?\n\nIt was pretty obvious they were setting up a \"haunted fair\" for the next one, and goddammit I'll probably come back for it, because I love that setting. I'm sure Shudder is pleased that they now have TWO mediocre found footage franchises that I'll nevertheless pay to watch every year.\n\nFar more pleased with this one - very much in the Twilight Zone, Tales from the Darkside, Night Gallery vein, where there's a supernatural element that mostly serves to get five people stuck in a room, unsure of who (and what) to trust. Featuring a murderer's row of character actors, each playing a former soldier (or intelligence officer, or government employee) attending a séance just a few months after the end of WWII. They all give it their all with some complex roles, which keeps you on your toes as well.\n\nThere's only so much you can do with these sorts of premises, and while it does push the ghostliness as things ramp up there's nothing here that you couldn't pull off on a stage performance. If you like those sorts of movies, though, it's a must-watch.\n\nI'd like to knock out one more movie before the end of the day - which would get me to 50 NEW movies, not just 50 movies total - but we'll see if I get to it. And then wrap things up tomorrow. Happy Halloween all!\n\n1: Nina Forever (2015)\n\n2: The Wolf Man (1941)\n\n3: The Neon Demon (2016)\n\n4: Stigmata (1999)\n\n5: Night of the Demons 2 (1994)\n\n6: Freaked (1993)\n\n7: In Dreams (1999)\n\n8: Angel Heart (1987)\n\n9: Possession (1981)\n\n10: Moon Garden (2022)\n\n11: Frankenstein (1931)\n\n12: Bride of Frankenstein (1935)\n\n13: Friday The 13th Part 3 (1982)\n\n14: Freddy vs Jason (2003)\n\n15: A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 4: The Dream Master\n\n16: Alucarda (1977)\n\n17: PussyCake (2021)\n\n18: Satanic Panic (2019)\n\n19: Night of the Devils (1972)\n\n20: The Long Hair of Death (1964)\n\n21: Infinity Pool (2022)\n\n🎃\n\nI like Antiviral and LOVE Possessor. But this one....i just looked at it with a blank face. Didn't care at all about what happened. Cool masks though...and great gore. But other than that this was one big bore fest.\n\n22: Happy Death Day (2017)\n\n🎃🎃🎃½\n\nNever seen this before but i had heard it was a fun slasher with a twist on the formula (i was not aware of what the twist was beforehand) I can see how the director is a perfect fit the next Scream movie. This was a really good time! Very fun spin on \"Groundhog Day\".\n\n23: Happy Death Day 2U (2019)\n\n🎃🎃🎃½\n\nHad really fun with the first one so i just had to jump in to the sequel. Was not expecting much more than a redo of the first one. And it is while instead of being straight horror comedy leans into sci-fi instead. They are really having fun with this concept and the sequel kept it fresh rather than doing just another sequel. Very enjoyable!\n\n24: The Changeling (1980, rewatch)\n\n🎃🎃½\n\nGeorge C. Scott is fantastic. As always. I have not seen this in 20 years. And while the mood and acting is superb. The \"old haunted house\"-trope rarely do it for me but i have been wanting to rewatch this for a long time. Outside of the mood and George and some of the other actors, the movie doesn't really excite me. But it does have some good imagery and mystique and a great musical score.\n\n25: The Last Voyage of The Demeter (2023)\n\n🎃🎃\n\nThe potential of this was huge. But it's not scary nor is it atmospheric. Would love to have seen a way more creepy direction with this. Either that or have some fun with it, like Jason Takes Manhattan. Not that the reception for this movie was any good to begin with, but i was still dissapointed.\n\n26: Hatchet (2006, rewatch)\n\n🎃🎃🎃½\n\nA nice homage to the slashers we love from the 80's. It's stupid as hell, and fun as hell and probably a bit offensive. It also feels like the movie has a mid 2000's watermark all over it. Classic horror actors like Tony Todd and Robert Englund having small parts and ofc Kane Hodder as killer Victor Crowley. Great practical effects and kills. In a time of remakes and cgi - i loved this movie first time around. I still like it. I never saw the sequels but i will get to them very soon. Not this october though. But i had to rewatch this one first. And it was worth it!\n\n27: A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)\n\n🎃🎃🎃\n\nShe put down the skateboard against the curb, grip tape down. Who does that?? Other than that...movies was kinda fine....not much of a plot going on for the most part. Or it's me and my fever having trouble keeping up with the subtitles? A vampire girl kills bad men. It's fine. Movie has a STRONG emphasis on the sound of footsteps for some reason.\n\n28: Terrifier 2(2022)\n\n🎃🎃🎃½\n\nThe first one actually gave me chills when it came out. I have never been the \"clowns are scary\"-person. Not even as a joke. I just think they are ugly and boring. However, Art thr clown scsred the shit out of. As a grown up. Though the movie was empty of any substance, i love it. So now it's finally time to watch the sequel. Terrifier 2 is so gruesome. I dont know if i should laugh. But i do when it looks too ridiculous. Art is still a scary sick character though. And so is the other clown. Not as good as the first though. I missed the creep factor.\n\n29: Halloween Ends (2022, rewatch)\n\n🎃🎃🎃🎃\n\nFirst time watching this i was so taken aback about it i had no idea what to really think about it. I didn't hate it. I was just confused about what i saw. But after this second rewatch i can saftley say this is really good. It's not good as a \"trilogy ender\" and the movies actual ending feels too tacked on and goes by too quick. But overall, hell yeah, Halloween Ends is absolutely one of the best in the franchise!\n\n30: When Evil Lurks (2023)\n\n🎃🎃🎃\n\nSecond Argentinian movie im watching this month. And this oneactually has a great red compared to Pussy Cake. And i can see why. This one has a consistent, depressing, tone and it's eerie, gutsy and gross. But i didn't really feel it was thaaat good. It's not bad. Mostly what's good are the bloody gory parts. I liked the borthers. The ex wife was just hysterical for sramatic purposes i guess. And i dont understand why since it seems what's going on was common knowledge. And the dog thing...i laughed at it. And im sorry. I think.\n\n31: Exorcist III (1990, rewatch)\n\n🎃🎃🎃🎃\n\nIt so extremely well acted, well directed, creepy and yet it's one of those movies where we barely see anything att all. George C Scott and Brad Dourff are so fucking good in this. Specialy Dourff who is eating up every piece of scene he is in. One of the most underrated horror films there are. I love it!\n\n----Bonus: Spooky video games-----\n\nResident Evil 4 Remake: Seperate Ways(2023)\n\n🎃🎃🎃\n\nIt's fun, it has some new locations and we get more Luis...and Wesker! And aome thibgs missing from OG RE4 are in this chapter so i was happy with that. It's fine. But nothing spectacular.\n\nEvil West (2022)\n\n🎃🎃🎃🎃\n\nFuck this was a huge ton of fun! Some really good monster designs, fun weapons and very fast paced combat. Story and characters is nothing special, neither is the level design. But realy fun as hell video game. And pretty challenging at times. Not a scary horror game, just horror themed. Some problems with the soundmix though and some voice recordings sound like they where recorded of a radio speaker.\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night (1997, replay)\n\n🎃🎃🎃🎃\n\nThird time playing this. It's a masterpiece when it comes to mysic and visuals. I love playing it, but i always feel the upside down castle is a bit bullshit. I still love the game though."
