There are only a few people who have not mutated in the restaurant, who hide under the counter out of desperation. They are rescued by a certain adult man who introduced himself as \"Arby from the future\". He destroys the zombies in the building with the help of a machine gun he has in store, but he dies himself. Despite the fact that the restaurant is free of zombies, the survivors cannot leave it, as many zombie chickens surround it from the outside. Arby and Wendy find the antidote. It turns out to be alcohol. The fact is that all zombies have Indian souls inside, which tolerate it very badly. When the beer runs out, an Arab Hummus kitchen worker volunteers to destroy the remaining zombies by blowing herself up among them. Arby and Wendy, along with the little girl they found in the pantry, leave the restaurant by car. Suddenly, the girl lays a large chicken egg, and Arby, shocked by what he saw, can't control the car, the car gets into an accident and explodes."
