        "text": "During his free time in the afternoons, Manek entertains his friends in his house with stories. Love stories of three women from his past -- Jamuna, a middle-class girl, is in love with her lower-caste neighbor, Tanna, but eventually marries a rich, kindly man; Lily, an educated girl ends up marrying Tanna and resents being in her marriage; Satti, an impoverished girl, dreams of love but is sold by her adopted father to a repulsive and much older man. Each story is told separately but linked together by connecting incidents, which are told from different angles, creating a tapestry of characters and experiences, and an interesting construct for the film. This film is based on Dharmavir Bharati's novel of the same title. Awards/Festivals: Best Actor Award, International Film Festival of India; Best Hindi Film, National Awards; Asia Pacific Film Festival; Singapore Film Festival; Hongkong Film Festival; Jerusalem Film Festival; Vancouver Film Festival; Chicago Film Festival 1994; London Film Festival; Cairo Film Festival."
