        "text": "In Hindu mythology, Surya travels through the sky on a seven-horse, twelve-spoked chariot, driven by Arun (the brother of Garud), with its arrival heralded by Usha, As the Sun begins its apparent journey towards the Northern Hemisphere (Uttarayan). Horses portray power, arrogance and speed. We are always in awe when we sight an impressive-looking steed racing away to his destination. The Sun God's seven horses represent the seven sins and his control over the same indicates the Devata's perfect control over the same. It also represents the way we need to control our base emotions so as to climb further and higher in the spiritual realm of our own lives.\n\nSurya's seven horses also represent the seven chakras in the chakras (spiritual centers in the subtle body or sukshma sharira), the blossoming of which leads to the rising of the power of Kundalini or the serpentine energy residing within us.\n\nThe seventh horse is the horse of dreams, aspirations and future. In the end it is shown that other six horses are injured and the seventh horse takes the sun into a hopeful future."
