As King James I of England he ruled for 22 years.\n\nFor the next few days I will focus on other royals that I find interesting and will provide some biographical information and the reasons why I find them interesting.\n\nHRH Princess Margaret of Connaught, Princess of the United Kingdom, Crown Princess of Sweden\n\nBorn: January, 15 1882. Died: 1 May 1920. She was the daughter of HRH Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia. Her father, the Duke of Connaught, was the third son and seventh child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\n\nFrom many of the pictures I have seen Princess Margaret was very beautiful. Along with her sister, Princess Victoria Patricia, she was considered one of the most eligible princesses in all of Europe. She had a deep interest in the visual arts including, drawing, painting and photography.\n\nHer uncle, King Edward VII of Great Britain, wanted her to marry a king or a crown prince. In 1905 the Duke and Duchess of Connaught visited Portugal and the court of King Carlos and Queen Amélie (born a princess of Orléans) where Margaret and her sister met with Luís Filipe, Duke of Braganza, and Prince Manuel (future King Manuel II). However, nothing came of these meetings.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Connaught continued their travels and in Cairo, Egypt Princess Margaret met Prince Gustaf Adolph of Sweden, grandson of King Oscar II of Sweden. The intent on this meeting was for Princess Victoria Patricia and Prince Gustaf Adolph to meet. However, for Princess Margaret and Prince Gustaf Adolph it was love at first sight. The prince proposed that evening and the couple were married June 15, 1905 at St, George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. This rapid romance and marriage may seem strange in our time but this was the common practice back then.\n\nPrincess Margaret became Crown Princess of Sweden in 1907 upon the death of King Oscar II of Sweden and the accession of Gustaf Adolph’s father as King Gustaf V of Sweden. Although the union was a happy one they had five children (four sons and one daughter) it seems Margaret was unhappy in Sweden. When World War I broke out Princess Margaret was supportive and active in the Red Cross.\n\nIn 1920, while pregnant with her sixth child, Princess Margaret under went a mastoid operation, developed a fever and died at the age of 38.\n\nI find myself attracted to her story because it is a life of an artistic princess that held so much promise that ended in tragedy. Incidentally, Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who passed away on May 5 of this year, was Princess Margret’s last surviving child.\n\nCount Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg 1916-2012\n\nHere are a couple of photos from the conclusion of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations.\n\nChurch service at St Paul’s Cathedral. Her Majesty is wearing a brooch that is worn infrequently. The brooch, know affectionately as “Granny’s Chips,” contain stones 3 & 4 of the Cullinan diamond. The larger stones, 1 & 2, are also part of the Crown Jewels and are fitted into the scepter and imperial state crown respectively.\n\nOn the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the serve. The absence of HRH The Duke of Edinburgh is sadly noted. I wish him a speedy and thorough recovery. Her Majesty is supported by her two eventual successors, HRH The Prince of Wales (the future King Charles III) and HRH The Duchess of Cornwall, TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (the future King William V and Queen Catherine).\n\nAlthough here in the United States we still have last night’s concert to watch, today’s ceremonies end the official Diamond Jubilee celebration.\n\nI completely enjoy the pomp and pageantry that surrounds the British monarchy and I have been very caught up in the emotions of the events. These are rare historic events. Jubilees do not come very often and this is only the second Diamond Jubilee in British History. The first was in 1897 when Queen Elizabeth II’s great-great grandmother, Queen Victoria celebrated her Diamond Jubilee.\n\nWith millions celebrating and cheering in Britain and around the world the support for the monarchy is high at this moment and any rumblings and complaints from the Republicans (those who want the monarchy abolished) have been drowned out by the cheers. I am grateful that I lived to see these events and pray that Her Majesty continues in good health and may she continue to reign for a long long time. Who knows? If Her Majesty has the long life her mother had she will easily reach 96 years of age ten years from now and will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee, 70 years on the throne!\n\nGrand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia was son of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, the third son of Czar Alexander II and Maria Alexandrovna of Hesse-Darmstadt, and his wife, Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In the summer of 1922 Grand Duke Cyril declared himself “Curator of the Russian Throne,” a made up title to represent his claim to the Russian throne. In 1924 Cyril finally assumed the title Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russias. Though he was the heir by primogeniture his claim to the throne was met with opposition because at his birth his mother was a Lutheran and not yet a member of the Russian Orthodox Church and this was a violation of the Pauline House Laws which stated all those in order of succession had to marry members of the Russian Orthodox Church. Since Russia followed suit of nearly every European royal family during the 18th and 19th centuries of selecting brides from the vast array of German royalty and upper nobility this issue was usually resolved with the perspective bride converting to Russian Orthodoxy prior to their marriage.\n\nThe controversy and the actions that questioned Cyril’s right to claim the throne came with his controversial marriage in 1905 to his first cousin, HRH Princes Victoria Melita of Edinburgh, Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. She was a grand daughter of Queen Victoria through her second son, HRH Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (1892-1900) and his wife HIH Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, daughter of Czar Alexander II and Maria Alexandrovna of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nOne of the primary issues with the marriage was that Cyril and Victoria Melita were first cousins and the Russian Orthodox Church forbade marriages between first cousins. But what made the marriage more controversial is that prior to her marriage to Grand Duke Cyril, Victoria Melita was married, and then divorced, from HRH Grand Duke Ernst August of Hesse and by Rhine, who also was the brother of Czarina Alexandra of Russia, wife of Czar Nicholas II. The Czarina did not like her former sister-in-law and first cousin and she greatly disapproved of the marriage. For his behavior Czar Nicholas II had his cousin Cyril stripped of his title of Grand Duke and his style His Imperial Highness and all other royal orders and his position in the Russian Navy and was banished from Russia.\n\nCyril’s position changed in 1908 when his uncle, Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia died and he became third in line to the Russian throne behind the Czarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, eldest son of Nicholas II, and Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, the Czar’s brother. Cyril was restored to all his former titles and styles and welcomed back to Russia. His wife was given the title Grand Duchess of Russia and was styled as Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna. Those that did not recognize the marriage as legal, although the Czar eventually did, accepted another of the Czar’s cousins, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, as the true claimant to the throne after the downfall of the monarchy.\n\nGrand Duke Cyril and his wife had three children: Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia (1907-1951) who married, Prince Friedrich Karl of Leiningen, Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna (1909-1967) who married, HIH Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, heir to the thrones of Imperial Germany and Prussia. Their last child was Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia (1917-1992). In 1938 Grand Duke Cyril died at the age of 62 and his son took over the claims to the throne of Russia.\n\nPart III will discuss the challenges to Grand Duke Vladimir claims to the throne and the emergence of other pretenders.\n\nAddendum\n\nHere are a couple of factoids about royal numbering that I did not include previously in the series.\n\nIn 1830 Prince William Henry, Duke of Clarence ascended the British throne. Initially he wanted to call himself by his second name and rule as King Henry IX of the United Kingdom. It was quickly pointed out that as recently as 30 years ago the last pretender to the British throne by the branch of the House of Stuart that had been excluded, was called Henry IX by his followers. Therefore the new king settled on his first name and called himself William IV.\n\nIn 1888 Crown Prince Friedrich of Germany and Prussia ascended the Imperial throne of Germany and the Royal throne of Prussia. He was the son of Wilhelm I, German Emperor and King of Prussia. He was also the son-in-law of Britain’s Queen Victoria, married to her eldest daughter, princess Victoria, the Princess Royal. He was the second Emperor of this new German Empire founded in 1871. However he mistakenly thought this new empire was connected to the old Holy Roman Empire and he wanted to call himself Emperor Friedrich IV. After being shown his mistake the new emperor settled on calling himself Emperor Friedrich III since as king of Prussia, he was the third king by that name.\n\nThis concludes my series on Royal numbering. Check back on Monday for a new series. As Royal news pops up over the weekend, such as the name of the new Danish princess, I will be posting that information so keep checking.\n\nYesterday for this topic I covered the Kingdom of England, today my focus will be on the union of England and Scotland. With numbering the kings and queens of Scotland there does not seem to be any similar problems as there was with England. It isn’t until England and Scotland are united does a problem begin to appear. In 1603 Queen Elizabeth I of England died without issue and was succeeded by James VI, King of Scots. Since he was the first king of England by that name he became known as King James I of England.\n\nAlthough England and Scotland shared a monarch they remained separate countries and retained their separate governments as well as ordinals for their monarchs accordingly. During this time period there were monarchs that had dual ordinals and some that did not. For example, Charles I and Charles II were the first two of that name in either England or Scotland so that did not present a problem. Charles II’s successor was his brother James who was known as King James II of England and James VII, King of Scots. King William III of England was also William II, King of Scots and these are two examples of monarchs that technically had dual ordinals, although you may not often see them regarded in that fashion.\n\nIn 1707 during the reign of Queen Anne (1702-1714) the Parliaments of England and Scotland were finally united creating the kingdom of Great Britain. When Ireland joined in 1801 the nation became the United Kingdom of Great Britain. This meant the separate titles of King or Queen of England and Scotland ceased to exist. There was also no need for two separate ordinals for the monarchs. This did not matter for the first four successors to Queen Anne, all named George, because there had never been a King George in either England or Scotland until that time.\n\nAfter the reign of King George IV, who died in 1830, it seemed that the ordinal numbers used in Scotland were to be ignored and those that had been used in England would take precedence. This is demonstrated by the fact that in 1830 with the accession of the Duke of Clarence as King William IV he was not called William III in Scotland and no one seemed to mind. He could have been called King William of the United Kingdom to reflect the new nation-state but I find no evidence if that option was ever considered.\n\nA little trouble was stirred up in 1901 with the accession of King Edward VII (1901-1910). Some theorized that since the United Kingdom was a new nation Edward VII and Edward VIII should or could have been called Edward I and Edward II.\n\nThe problem really reared its head in Scotland with the accession of Elizabeth II. Elizabeth I was queen of England only and the Scots never had a queen named Elizabeth reigning over them. An example of one of the objections made at the time of her accession was the use of the Royal Cypher “EIIR” anywhere in Scotland. The use of that particular cypher even instated violence. Today the cypher that is used in Scotland on all government and Crown property has no lettering and displays an artistic rendering of the Crown of Scotland from the Honors of Scotland.\n\nIn order to prevent any further problems with the numbering of the monarchs in the United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested that in the future the monarch should use the higher of the two numerals from the English and Scottish sequences. Therefore if there is another King James he will not be James III but James VIII. If there is a King Robert he will be Robert IV since there were three kings of Scotland by that name.\n\nThe last issue in numbering the British monarch is the use of the numeral “I.” In some monarchies a monarch with a new name previously not used will be called the first. Britain does not follow this tradition. That is why you do not see Queen Victoria being called Queen Victoria I. In Britain a monarch will not get a ordinal number until there is another monarch with the same name. Until there is another Queen by the name of Victoria the first Queen Victoria will simply remain Victoria. The same goes with king’s Stephen, John and Queen Anne.\n\nOne aspect Britain shares with other countries is that consorts are not numbered. The only acceptation are those that ruled jointly, where sovereignty was vested in both individuals. With King William III and Queen Mary II this is clearly evident as Parliament vested sovereignty in both people. Mary was the rightful successor to her father King James II-VII of England and Scotland but Mary refused to rule without her husband, Prince Willem III of Orange. He was also her cousin and he did have succession right but only after Mary’s sister Anne. The question about a consort receiving an ordinal number arises with Queen Mary I of England and her husband King Felipe II of Spain. He was the only male consort of a queen regnant in England to be given the title of King. Will there ever be a King Philip II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain? It remains to be seen. I will discuss that part of the issue in Part III tomorrow."
