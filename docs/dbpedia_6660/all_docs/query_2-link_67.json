        "text": "Canada and the Athlones had grown genuinely fond of each other.\n\nIt was in June 1940 that soldierly Alexander Augustus Frederick William Alfred George Cambridge, Earl of Athlone (known to his older sister, Queen Mary, as “Algie”) and his small, handsome wife, Princess Alice (granddaughter of Queen Victoria) took up residence in Government House. For five wartime years the Governor General and his Lady had quietly impressed themselves on Canadian life, performing viceregal duties with impeccable style and unfailing good manners.\n\nAt week’s end, after a strenuous round of protracted farewells, the Athlones were whisked off to Washington in a Liberator bearing Canada’s coat of arms and flying the blue standard. At the airport, an R.C.A.F. band played Will Ye No Come Back Again? Their last glimpse of Canada: Prime Minister Mackenzie King doffing his hat to lead the crowd in three cheers and a tiger."
