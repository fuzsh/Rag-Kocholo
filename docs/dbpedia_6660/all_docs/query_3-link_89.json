        "text": "These days, the Princess of Wales’s royal wardrobe extends far beyond the high-street dresses and nude pumps she was once known for, with choices that reflect the expansion of her role as a senior member of the family.\n\nIncreasingly, the Princess’s ensembles are beginning to echo the same style tactics the late Queen adopted: Kate chooses block colours that ensure she stands out in the crowd at public engagements, and she possesses a discreet diplomatic touch. On royal tours in particular she will use her wardrobe choices to nod to host nations, while spotlighting the work of British designers on an international stage. (Kate’s preferred designers – like Erdem, Alexander McQueen, the London-based Emilia Wickstead and Jenny Packham – have been a constant during her decade of royal duties.)\n\nShe is also unafraid to dial up the glamour and go into fairytale princess mode when the occasion calls. See the gold Jenny Packham caped gown she wore to the London premiere of the James Bond film No Time to Die, or the black opera gloves she added as a surprise twist to her BAFTAs look in 2023.\n\nIt was the then Kate Middleton’s bridal gown in April 2011 that truly introduced her as a fashion force to be reckoned with. The dress – made of ivory and white satin gazar and with a 2.7m long train – is arguably the most famous wedding dress of the 21st century. Made by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, the commission also arrived at a poignant time for the house, following the passing of Lee McQueen the previous year, and marked the beginning of a lasting partnership between Kate and the brand.\n\nOver the years Kate has established a distinctive personal style that incorporates signatures she stays fiercely loyal to, from coat dresses to neat blazers. As Sarah Harris, deputy editor and fashion features director at British Vogue, previously wrote: “She has carefully honed a silhouette that works for her – narrow tailored shoulders, cinched at the waist, fitted through the torso – but there is a common denominator in all of these looks: the hemline is now longer; always falling demurely below the knee, hitting midi length or more.”\n\nThe Princess of Wales is all too aware of how painstakingly her public outfits are parsed for messages and meaning, and always dresses accordingly. She nods to tradition and the history of the royal family with archival references, mixes in some high street pieces to remain approachable, re-wears and rents to promote sustainability, and champions British designers with her luxury looks. “First and foremost, and yes, it’s a boring one, but what she wears has to be practical,” writes Harris. “Working royals endure long days and so the clothes have to work, from being comfortable, to weather appropriate, to magically immune to wrinkling. Nothing can be too fussy, so forget a slit that’s tricky to navigate, or a collar that needs tending to.”\n\nAhead of the Coronation of King Charles III, and as Kate’s new role as the Princess of Wales is formalised, revisit her life in style, below."
