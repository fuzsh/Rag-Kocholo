        "text": "Extinct earldom in the Peerage of the United Kingdom\n\nThe title of Earl of Athlone has been created three times.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was created first in the Peerage of Ireland in 1692 by King William III for General Baron van Reede, Lord of Ginkel, a Dutch nobleman, to honour him for his successful battles in Ireland including the Siege of Athlone. The title also had the subsidiary title of Baron Aughrim. These titles became extinct in 1844 upon the death of the 9th Earl. The Earls also bore the Dutch nobility title Baron van Reede (hereditary in male line; still extant in the Netherlands).\n\nThe second creation was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, as a subsidiary title of the Dukedom of Clarence and Avondale, and was conferred in 1890 upon Prince Albert Victor of Wales, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. When he died in 1892, the title became extinct.\n\nThe third creation was in 1917, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, for the former Prince Alexander of Teck, younger brother of Queen Mary and great‑uncle of Queen Elizabeth II, along with the subsidiary title of Viscount Trematon. The earldom was given after the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, when members of the British royal family were forced to renounce their German royal titles. Alexander had two sons who predeceased him, and the titles became extinct after his death.[4]\n\nEarls of Athlone, first creation (1692)\n\n[edit]\n\nGodard van Reede, 1st Earl of Athlone (1630–1703)\n\nFrederick Christiaan van Reede, 2nd Earl of Athlone (1668–1719)\n\nGodard Adriaan van Reede, 3rd Earl of Athlone (1716–1736)\n\nFredrik Willem van Reede, 4th Earl of Athlone (1717–1747)\n\nFredrik Christiaan Reinhart van Reede, 5th Earl of Athlone (1743–1808)\n\nFrederik Willem van Reede, 6th Earl of Athlone (1766–1810)\n\nReynoud Diederik Jacob van Reede, 7th Earl of Athlone (1773–1823)\n\nGeorge Godard Henry van Reede, 8th Earl of Athlone (1820–1843)\n\nWillem Gustaaf Frederik van Reede, 9th Earl of Athlone (1780–1844)\n\nEarls of Athlone, second creation (1890)\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince Albert Victor Christian Edward, 1st Duke of Clarence and Avondale, 1st Earl of Athlone (1864–1892)\n\nEarls of Athlone, third creation (1917)\n\n[edit]\n\nAlexander Augustus Frederick William Alfred George Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone (1874–1957)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
