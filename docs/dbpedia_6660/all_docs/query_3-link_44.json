        "text": "After an historic 70 years on the throne, Britain's longest-serving monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, died at the age of 96 on Sept. 8, 2022. Her eldest son, Charles, became the new king immediately upon her passing, and his son, Prince William, moved up next in the line of succession.\n\nThen, in a coronation ceremony steeped in 1,000 years of tradition, King Charles III was formally crowned on May 6, 2023 in London.\n\nThere are detailed protocols governing the line of succession and who will take over after Charles' reign. In January 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced plans to pare back their royal duties. However, those plans do not include an abdication, and they remain in the line of succession, as do their two children.\n\nHere's a look at who on the royal family tree is in line for the throne, and the order of succession.\n\nKing Charles III\n\nSucceeding Queen Elizabeth II is her eldest son, Charles, who is now King Charles III. In Britain's monarchy, the heir ascends to the throne immediately upon the death of their predecessor. A formal ceremony and coronation are held later.\n\nCharles's wife Camilla now has the title of queen. In 2022, Queen Elizabeth said it was her \"sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort\" — an honor that had not always been assured. When the time came for Charles' coronation, the word \"consort\" was dropped and Camilla was simply referred to as queen.\n\nKing Charles III — formerly known as Charles, Prince of Wales\n\nRelationship to the throne: Son of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nBorn: November 14, 1948\n\nPhoto: King Charles III and Queen Camilla attend the Royal Maundy Service at York Minster on April 6, 2023 in York, England.\n\n1. William, Prince of Wales\n\nCharles's eldest son, Prince William, is now first in line to the throne.\n\nLike his father before him, he's been granted the title Prince of Wales, as well as Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge, and William's wife Catherine is now Princess of Wales.\n\nRelationship to the throne: Son of Prince Charles (now King Charles III) and Diana, Princess of Wales\n\nBorn: June 21, 1982\n\nPhoto: Prince William attends the National Service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral on June 3, 2022 in London, England.\n\n2. Prince George of Wales\n\nRelationship to the throne: Son of Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nBorn: July 22, 2013\n\nPhoto: Prince George with his mother at the Wimbledon men's singles final at All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club on July 10, 2022 in London, England.\n\n3. Princess Charlotte of Wales\n\nRelationship to the throne: Daughter of Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nBorn: May 2, 2015\n\nPhoto: Princess Charlotte visits Cardiff Castle on June 4, 2022 in Cardiff, Wales.\n\n4. Prince Louis of Wales\n\nRelationship to the throne: Son of Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nBorn: April 23, 2018\n\nPhoto: Prince Louis watches a flypast from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during Trooping the Colour on June 2, 2022 in London, England.\n\n5.

Prince Andrew, Duke of York\n\nRelationship to the throne: Son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n\nBorn: February 19, 1960\n\nPrince Andrew has been stripped of several titles in the wake of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal — and may lose more — but he remains in line for the throne.\n\n9. Princess Beatrice of York\n\nRelationship to the throne: Daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York\n\nBorn: August 8, 1988\n\nPhoto: Princess Beatrice attends Ladies Day on the third day of the Royal Ascot on June 21, 2012, in Ascot, England.\n\n10.
