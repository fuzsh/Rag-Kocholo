        "text": "'They liked the names... no more, no less': Palace reveals why Kate and William chose GEORGE ALEXANDER LOUIS for their baby\n\nKensington Palace revealed the baby's full name will be George Alexander Louis\n\nThe third in line to the throne will be known as Prince George\n\nGeorge was the bookmakers' favourite once Kate's pregnancy was announced\n\nThe Queen saw her great-grandson for the first time yesterday morning\n\nShe would have been told by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge of their choice\n\nSix King Georges have worn the crown throughout history\n\nRoyal biographer Robert Lacey said the choice of George would give the Queen 'great pleasure'\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have named their baby son George Alexander Louis.\n\nWhen he rules this country, perhaps not for half a century or more, he will be King George VII. Until then, he will be known formally as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Kate came to a relatively quick decision yesterday about the hugely anticipated name. George had long been the favourite, with bookmakers shortening the odds in recent days.\n\nScroll down for videos\n\nHeir to the throne: Kensington Palace revealed the baby's full name will be George Alexander Louis\n\nNew life: William and Kate's baby is third in line to the throne will one day be king\n\nWhile there will be much speculation as to the inspiration behind the names, palace officials were quick to insist it was simply ‘because they liked them – no more no less’.\n\nThe Mail understands that William and Kate had already decided by the time they introduced the Queen to her heir – and third great-grandchild – at Kensington Palace yesterday morning.\n\nThere is no royal protocol which dictates the sovereign must be given approval, but it is believed the couple discussed their choice with her during their 30-minute meeting.\n\nThey then told other members of their immediate family before making the news public at 6.15pm.\n\nA statement issued by their office at Kensington Palace said: ‘The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son George Alexander Louis.\n\n‘The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.’\n\nIt took only two days for the name to be released, compared with seven when William was born in 1982.\n\nAt around 1pm yesterday the new parents were seen leaving Kensington Palace in a Range Rover with their son. They were on their way to Bucklebury in Berkshire, where they will stay with Kate’s parents.\n\nFirst day at home: Kate, William and their baby left Kensington Palace today as they were seen for the first time since leaving hospital last night\n\nVery happy: Kate and William both smiled and waved to crowds outside the gates, but Kensington Palace would not reveal where they were heading\n\nNew mother: Kate waved with her left hand and appeared to have her right hand resting next to her baby\n\nIt is likely the Queen will have been thrilled by the choice of name, given that her father was George VI. He was christened Albert and was known to his family as Bertie, but monarchs are allowed to pick a name under which to rule.\n\nHe chose George in honour of his father, George V, and to create the impression of stability after the scandal caused by the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII.\n\nGeorge is also the fourth name of the Prince of Wales.\n\nHistorian and biographer Robert Lacey said: ‘George is obviously a tribute to the Queen’s father and will, I imagine, give Her Majesty great pleasure.’\n\nOn Tuesday, the BBC’s royal correspondent, Peter Hunt, asked William whether he would name his son George in line with the bookmakers’ predictions.\n\nThe duke laughed and said: ‘Wait and see.’\n\nLouis, the baby’s third name, is William’s fourth name – he is William Arthur Philip Louis. It was chosen by Charles as a tribute to his close friend and mentor, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh’s uncle. He was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979 when his boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of Ireland.\n\nThe less obvious choice is Alexander, although there are also some royal relatives: Prince Philip’s grandfather was Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, for example.\n\nThe first Prince George of Cambridge, born in 1819, led something of a scandalous life after refusing to have an arranged marriage because he fell in love with a commoner .\n\nWhen he wed actress Sarah Louisa Fairbrother, without the sovereign’s approval, she was already the mother of two of his children and pregnant with his third.\n\nHeading home: After half an hour with the new prince, Kate and William, where they may have discussed names, the Queen went back to Buckingham Palace\n\nDown the drive: Her Majesty visited without the Duke of Edinburgh, who is still at Windsor Castle recuperating after an operation last month\n\nA Royal name which is steeped in tradition and history\n\nBy naming their son George Alexander Louis, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have picked a name which is synonymous with British kings.\n\nThe middle name of Alexander will also prove popular in Scotland while Louis has deep significance in the Windsor family following the death of Lord Louis Mountbatten by the IRA in 1979."
