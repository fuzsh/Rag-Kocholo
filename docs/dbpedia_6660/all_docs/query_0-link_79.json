The eldest child of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany (youngest son of Queen Victoria) and Princess Helena of Waldeck-Pyrmont (her cousin was Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands through her mother’s side and her younger brother was the reigning Grand Duke of Saxe Coburg Gotha). Unfortunately, her father died a month after her first birthday. In 1903, Princess Alice married Prince Alexander of Teck, brother of Queen Mary. The couple had three children, but only their daughter survived them. In 1917, they renounced their German, Teck, title, and were made Earl and Countess of Athlone, though she retained her style of Princess as the male-line granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Princess Alice was one of the most well-traveled members of the royal family, visiting Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Malaya, Singapore, Siam (now Thailand), South Africa, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Uganda, Egypt, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, the West Indies, Canada, and the United States. Princess Alice was also the Vicereine of South Africa and Canada. The couple retired to their apartment in Kensington Palace after WWII, where she lived until she died in 1981. Princess Alice published her memoir, For My Grandchildren, in 1966.\n\nDiamond Palmette Tiara | Teck Ears of Wheat Tiara | Pearl and Diamond Tiara | Teck Sapphire Stomacher |Pearl and Diamond Corsage Brooch\n\nPrincess Alice’s Diamond Palmette Tiara\n\nProvenance: unknown, appeared in the 1920s.\n\nNotably worn: Wedding Ball of her niece, Princess Sibylla, and Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden in 1932, Coronation of the Queen in 1953, Queen Juliana’s 30th Anniversary Gala in 1967, and King Gustaf VI Adolf’s 90th Birthday Banquet in 1972\n\nCurrent location: unknown, auctioned at Christie’s in 1984\n\nTeck Ears of Wheat Tiara\n\nProvenance: Princess Augusta, Duchess of Cambridge, inherited by her daughter, Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck, and then by her son, by Prince Alexander of Teck.\n\nNotably worn: Wedding in 1903, Coronation of King George V in 1911, and the Coronation of King George VI in 1937.\n\nCurrent location: with her grandchildren.\n\nPrincess Alice’s Pearl and Diamond Tiara\n\nProvenance: Wedding Gift from King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra\n\nCurrent location: unknown, possibly dismantled in the 1920s to create the Diamond Palmette Tiara.\n\nTeck Sapphire Stomacher\n\nProvenance: Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, the Duchess of Teck, inherited by Prince Alexander of Teck.\n\nNotably worn: Coronation of King George V in 1911, Coronation of King George VI in 1937, Coronation of the Queen in 1953\n\nCurrent location: likely with her grandchildren.\n\nPrincess Alice’s Pearl Corsage Brooch\n\nProvenance: likely a wedding gift.\n\nNotably worn: Portraits in the 1920s and at the Wedding of her goddaughter, Princess Anne, in 1973\n\nCurrent Location: inherited by her daughter, Lady May Abel Smith, and likely in her collection.\n\nFor more information, check out:\n\nPrincess Alice’s Teck Ears of Wheat Tiara\n\nShare this:"
