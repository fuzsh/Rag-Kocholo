        "text": "LONDON — With a haste unusual in the royal family’s handling of such matters, Prince William and his wife, the former Kate Middleton, announced Wednesday that they had named their 2-day-old son George Alexander Louis — thus setting him on a course, assuming he ascends the throne, to one day become King George VII.\n\nOn his birth on Monday, the infant became third in line to the throne, after his grandfather Prince Charles and his father. Since Charles is 64 and William is 31, and Queen Elizabeth II appears in robust health at 87, the reign of a new King George, with all the resonance the name carries in the 1,000-year history of the British monarchy, could be decades away.\n\nThe announcement from Kensington Palace, where William and Kate will make their London home, said that the infant would be formally known as Prince George of Cambridge. The title derives from the decision of Queen Elizabeth to revive the titles of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, unused since Queen Victoria’s time, and bestow them on William and Kate when they married in April 2011.\n\nThe official naming announcement was brief, and with William, Kate and the baby having left London at lunchtime to stay with Carole and Michael Middleton, Kate’s parents, at their secluded country home west of London, the couple were unavailable for any comment on their decision. But the choice of George, at least, came as little surprise, since it had led the odds in Britain’s betting shops."
