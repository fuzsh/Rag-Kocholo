Alexander's sister, Mary married King George V. Rupert's mother was the daughter of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the fourth son of Queen Victoria, and his wife, Helene, Princess of Waldeck and Pyrmont. Leopold had died from the effects of haemophilia, and Rupert also suffered from this condition.\n\nPrince Rupert was a haemophiliac, which he inherited through his mother from his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, through his grandfather, the Duke of Albany who was also a haemophiliac.\n\nAt the request of King George V, Rupert's father relinquished for himself and his issue his German styles and titles and assumed by royal licence the surname of Cambridge on 14 July 1917. He was then created Earl of Athlone and Viscount Trematon in the county of Cambridge on 16 July. Rupert holding the courtesy title of Viscount Trematon from that date.\n\nRupert attended Trinity College, Cambridge. When his father, Alexander was bestowed the title, The Right Honourable, The Earl of Athlone; Rupert adopted the courtesy title of Viscount Trematon.\n\nHe had been educated at Eton, and Trinity College, Cambridge, but on 1 April 1928 at Belleville-sur-Saone, while on a motoring holiday in France, he swerved to avoid another vehicle and crashed into a tree. His passenger was killed and Rupert severely injured.\n\nOn April 1, 1928 Rupert was driving with two friends on the road from Paris to Lyon. While passing another car, Rupert's car hit a tree and flipped over. One friend died from injuries, Rupert was transported to a nearby hospital at Belleville-sur-Saône with a slight skull fracture. He died in hospital in the early hours of April 15, 1928 from an intracerebral hemorrhage. His funeral was held in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and was attended by King George V and Queen Mary. He was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, on 20 April 1928. The title of Earl of Athlone became extinct in 1957 when his father died with no male predecessor to inherit it. His brother Maurice had died 18 years earlier as an infant, in 1910.\n\nSources\n\nBede Clifford, ‘Cambridge, Alexander Augustus Frederick William Alfred George, earl of Athlone (1874–1957)’, rev.
