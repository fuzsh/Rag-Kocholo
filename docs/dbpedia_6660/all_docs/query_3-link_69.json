        "text": "Kate Middleton and Prince William have revealed to the world they've named the royal baby Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made the eagerly-awaited announcement shortly after they'd left Kensington Palace with their newborn and arrived safely at the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire.\n\nThe proud parents' decision to name their son George - the patron saint of England - was a bookies' favourite and is on par with the 2013 baby names trend.\n\nSarah Barrett, managing editor at BabyCentre, told Yahoo! Lifestyle George is one of the most popular names with new parents opting for \"respected, solid names\" this year.\n\n\"George was predicted by our mums. It's quite popular, our first half of the year results for 2013 show George was ninth,\" she said.\n\n[Royal couple reveal baby name to the world]\n\n[WATCH Prince George give his first royal wave!]\n\n[Prince George's diary: 'Uncle Harry has just bought me a ticket to Vegas 2031!']\n\nRevealing the meaning of the royal baby's full name, she explained: \"George means farmer, earth worker, while Alexander means to defend and Louis 'famous warrior.'\n\n\"It's a good mix of trend and tradition.\"\n\nAnd could there perhaps be some significance in the order of baby George's name, with a more down-to-earth moniker being considered first before names of leadership?\n\n\"I guess we'll never know,\" Sarah smiled. \"George is more down to earth. Plus it can't be shortened, so you won't get a nickname.\n\n\"And it goes well with Cambridge; something with more syllables may have been too much.\"\n\nNaturally, Sarah is expecting to see a huge rise in the names over the next year. But will such a traditional name come as a surprise to anyone?\n\n\"They probably would have never gone for something celebrity,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Babycentre mums were hoping for something traditional but with a modern twist, like Alfred which can be shortened to Alfie, or Albert which could be Albie.\"\n\nAnd Sarah believes the Duke and Duchess waited to reveal the royal baby's name until they'd met him to decide for sure.\n\nShe said: \"Kate and William probably practiced saying the name - some mums even shout it up the stairs!"
