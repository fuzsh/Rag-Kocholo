        "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced tonight their baby son would be called George Alexander Louis.\n\nWilliam and Kate’s baby will be known as Prince George and as third in line to the throne will one day be king.\n\nKensington Palace said in a short statement: “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son George Alexander Louis.\n\n“The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.”\n\nSix King Georges have worn the crown throughout history since the German-born George I, the first Hanoverian king of Great Britain, acceded to the throne in 1714.\n\nThe last was the Queen’s father George VI who died in 1952 but was known to his family as Bertie.\n\nGeorge was the most popular name with the bookies with betting firms William Hill, Coral and Paddy Power all offering short odds on the moniker.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF THE NAME GEORGE\n\nThe name George – chosen for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s baby son – is synonymous with British kings.\n\nIt has come to represent the continuity of the monarchy and remained the bookmakers’ favourite in the name-guessing stakes from the moment Kate’s pregnancy was announced.\n\nSix King Georges have worn the crown throughout history since the German-born George I, the first Hanoverian king of Great Britain, acceded to the throne in 1714.\n\nThe first name of the last King George – George VI – was actually Albert and he was known to his family as “Bertie”, but he selected George – his fourth name - to use as Sovereign.\n\nHe was the much-loved father of the present Queen and the new Prince George of Cambridge’s great-great grandfather.\n\nGeorge VI chose George in honour of his father George V and to create the impression of stability after the scandal caused by the abdication of his brother Edward VIII.\n\nGeorge is also the fourth name of the Prince of Wales – the baby’s grandfather. Even Edward VIII had George among his seven names.\n\nThe name means farmer or earth worker. It was the 12th most popular name for boys born in England and Wales in 2011.\n\nSt George, a fourth-century Christian martyr, is the patron Saint of England and represents honour, bravery and gallantry. The legend of George slaying a dragon and rescuing an innocent maiden is medieval.\n\nThere has only been one other Prince of Cambridge and he was also called George.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Charles reveals his close bond to new grandson at The Royal Welsh\n\nThe first Prince George of Cambridge was a grandson of George III and the only son of Prince Adolphus Frederick, the 1st Duke of Cambridge.\n\nPrince George of Cambridge was born in 1819 and refused to have an arranged marriage. He wed a commoner for love after falling for the actress Sarah Louisa Fairbrother, who was said to be a classic beauty and a graceful dancer.\n\nThey married in 1847 when she was already the mother of two of his children and pregnant with his third.\n\nBut the Duke did not seek the sovereign’s approval and the marriage was never recognised, hence his children were not eligible to inherit royal titles.\n\nMiss Fairbrother, who generated much scandal including having a portrait painted in which she showed off her bare legs, was ostracised by the royal family and never given a title.\n\nInstead, she became known by the nickname Mrs FitzGeorge and this surname was taken by George’s offspring.\n\nDespite his marriage, George had a wandering eye and soon after he wed he took up with mistress Louisa Beauclerk, who remained his lover for more than 30 years.\n\nHe went on to become the 2nd Duke of Cambridge after his father’s death.\n\nThe Duke was in the Army and served in the Crimean War. He was promoted to Commander-in-Chief in 1887 and an equestrian statue of him stands in the middle of London’s Whitehall.\n\nHe was said to have been a disciplinarian, who believed Army promotions should be based on social connections rather than ability. He died in 1904.\n\nHis father, the 1st Duke of Cambridge – who lived from 1774 to 1850 – was never a Prince of Cambridge, but was given the title the Duke of Cambridge by his father George III in 1801 when he was 27."
