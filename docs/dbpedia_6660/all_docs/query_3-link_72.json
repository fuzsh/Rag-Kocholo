        "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have named their son George Alexander Louis, Kensington Palace has said.\n\nThe third in line to the throne, who was born on Monday at 16:24 BST, will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.\n\nThe Queen was told of Prince George's name when she met him for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nThe family are at the Middleton home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, after spending a night at Kensington Palace.\n\nGeorge was the bookmakers' favourite for the first name of the prince.\n\nThe duke and duchess had been expected to pick a traditional royal name for their son, who was born at St Mary's Hospital in London, weighing 8lbs 6oz.\n\nRoyal infants usually have historical names which are passed down through the generations.\n\nThere have been six King Georges up to now, most recently the Queen's father, although his first name was Albert and he was known to his family as Bertie.\n\nThe name Louis is Prince William's fourth name and is likely to be a tribute to Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh's uncle and the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947.\n\nPrince Charles was immensely fond of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten. Known by the Royal Family as Uncle Dickie, he was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979.\n\nThe prince's other middle name - Alexander - is one that three medieval Scottish kings have had, and was also the name of the famous 4th Century ruler Alexander the Great. The Queen's middle name is Alexandra.\n\nBBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said George will be seen as a tribute to the Queen's father but the couple are said to genuinely like the name themselves.\n\nAlexander was a favourite of Catherine's, he added.\n\nThe BBC's Peter Hunt said Prince George does not have to be King George if he accedes to the throne - he can choose another name, as the Queen's father did.\n\n\"Royal names are diminishing. Edward VIII had 7; Prince Charles has 4; Prince William 4; Prince George 3. #princegeorge,\" he tweeted, external.\n\nCharles Mosley, author of Blood Royal, told the BBC he knew it would be George.\n\n\"It was the name of the sovereigns under whom this country became a world player - in the 19th Century, defeating Napoleon, and in the 20th Century, winning two world wars.\n\n\"Louis is a nod in the direction of the Mountbatten element in the Royal Family. And indeed the surname of the royal family is still Mountbatten. His (Prince George's) birth certificate and marriage certificate will say Mountbatten-Windsor.\"\n\nAs well as being an established regal name, George is also a saint's name. St George was an early Christian martyr and is the patron saint of England.\n\nThe Queen spent 30 minutes with her new great-grandson on Wednesday. At a reception at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening, the monarch said she was \"thrilled\" at the arrival of her third great-grandchild.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, and Catherine's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, paid visits to the hospital on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nLater that day, Catherine's sister Pippa Middleton went to Kensington Palace and Prince Harry also paid his new nephew a visit.\n\nThe duke and duchess left Kensington Palace shortly after the Queen's visit and were driven to Bucklebury. It had been expected that the couple would want to spend time at the duchess's family home but it is not known how long they will stay.\n\nPrince William has two weeks' paternity leave before he is due back to work in Anglesey where he is an RAF search and rescue pilot."
