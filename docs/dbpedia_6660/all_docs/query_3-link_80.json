        "text": "All bets are off becase the name game is finally over!\n\nThe royal family welcomed its newest prince on Monday. We saw his precious face on Tuesday. And now we know his name.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton have named their firstborn son George Alexander Louis.\n\nCue the fanfare—trumpets, please!\n\nHis Royal Highness was born at 4:24 p.m. (British Summer Time) in the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London, weighing 8 pounds, 6 ounces, bestowing the monarchy with its third royal in line to the throne and bringing to a full circle the public's potent fairy-tale fascination that began with the couple's drawn-out courtship and culminated in their storybook wedding in 2011.\n\nAs befitting the pomp and pageantry of aristocratic tradition, the baby's arrival—and the eventual announcement of its gender—was heralded via a royal declaration signed by Kate's doctor, taken to Buckingham Palace via police escort, and placed on an easel outside the palace, similar to the protocol that was observed when William was born 31 years ago.\n\nWilliam was by his wife's side when they went to the hospital, he was present during the child's birth and then he spent the night at St. Mary's with Kate and their newborn son.\n\n\"We could not be happier,\" the new dad said following the child's arrival.\n\nThe family of three left the hospital the following day, with Will and Kate introducing their baby to the world at 7:14 p.m. (BST)."
