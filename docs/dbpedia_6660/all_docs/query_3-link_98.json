        "text": "Work is under way to install 438 solar panels on the roof of Cambridge's iconic King's College Chapel.\n\nIt is hoped the panels will reduce the building's carbon emissions by more than 23 tonnes per year.\n\nHowever, the scheme was criticised by some with Historic England saying it came at \"some cost to the beauty of Cambridge's finest building\".\n\nThe Reverend Dr Stephen Cherry, Dean of the Chapel, said the work was a \"serious project\" and not a \"gesture\".\n\nHe said: \"We're doing this in such a way that the visual impact is minimised and yet it is real.\n\n\"I want people to read the solar panels as a statement of our stewardship of what we are doing.\"\n\nShane Alexander, college project manager, said installation of the solar panels was designed to dovetail with work to replace the Grade 1 listed chapel's lead roof.\n\nThe 15th century chapel's roof had \"exceeded its natural lifespan\" and was no longer watertight.\n\nThe roof restoration began in September 2022 and work on the solar scheme began in March.\n\nArrays of 219 panels will be fixed to each of the north and south slopes of the chapel roof and will generate an anticipated 123,000 kilowatt hours per year, the college said.\n\nThis will help the college in its ambition to decarbonise its operations by 2038 and reduce its carbon emissions by more than 23 tonnes each year, the equivalent of planting 1,090 trees, King's said.\n\nIt added that the new panels, combined with other existing ones including on an accommodation block, would reduce the annual electricity demand of the college's main site by around 5.5%."
