        "text": "← Paul Kincaid's From the Other Side, December 2016: Ken MacLeod, Jonathan Oliver, NewCon Press, Infinity Plus, and a farewell for now\n\nReview: Saiensu Fikushon 2016 (Haikasoru) →\n\nMarch newsletter: Mur Lafferty, Renee Ahdieh, Samantha Shannon, John Scalzi, Roshani Chokshi, Oak City Comicon, more events, awards news, writing camps, and more\n\nPosted on 2017-03-07 at 19:6 by montsamu\n\nVol 7 No 2. Monday, March 6, 2017: Thankfully February was a short month again this year, so I hope you’ll forgive me for not having a newsletter out last month. Unfortunately I must ask your further indulgence for still not including a full “news and notes” or even “new books and audiobooks” section in this newsletter, even as (especially) publication notes begin to pile up to the ceiling! But enough of my groveling, let’s jump right in and talk about some upcoming events:\n\nThe big event this week is actually tonight, March 7 (Tuesday) at 7 pm as Flyleaf Books hosts Durham author Mur Lafferty to discuss her new books Six Wakes: A Novel and the first collected volume of Bookburners.\n\nLater this month sees events with Renée Ahdieh (Quail Ridge Books, Monday March 13), Samantha Shannon (Flyleaf Books, Tuesday March 14), Asheville author Robert Beatty (Quail Ridge Books, Sunday March 19), John Scalzi (Quail Ridge Books, Wednesday March 22, and Flyleaf Books, Thursday March 23), and Roshani Chokshi and Ryan Graudin (Flyleaf Books, Thursday March 30), along with an even more “bigger” Oak City Comicon, this year called NC Comicon Oak City, on March 18 and 19 at the Raleigh Convention Center.\n\nLooking further ahead, there are a few more new events since the last newsletter:\n\nScott Westerfeld’s Quail Ridge Books appearane was rescheduled for Monday April 17, for his new young adult science fiction novel Horizon; Flyleaf Books announced that Cory Doctorow’s book tour for his new novel Walkway would be making a stop in Chapel Hill on Friday May 5; and there’s also a newly listed second local event for Raleigh author John Kessel in support of the publication of his forthcoming novel The Moon and the Other. For further details, see the full events listings!\n\nAll right, while I said that I don’t have a full news and publication notes roundup yet again, there is some big awards news to pass along this month:\n\nThe 2016 Locus Recommended Reading List includes NC writers Fred Chappell (A Shadow All of Light, Fantasy Novel), Renée Ahdieh (The Rose and the Dagger, Young Adult Book), Alyssa Wong (\"You'll Surely Drown Here If You Stay\", Novelette, and \"A First of Permutations in Lightning and Wildflowers\", Short Story), and Dale Bailey (\"I Was A Teenage Werewolf\", Short Story). And while the list of other books there is long and wonderful, I want to also single out former NC writers Gerry Canavan, whose book Octavia E. Butler is listed for Non-Fiction, Roshani Chokshi, for her first novel The Star-Touched Queen, and Kij Johnson, for her novella The Dream-Quest of Vellitt Boe. This list also serves as the non-write-in choices for the annual Locus Poll and Survey, which decide the Locus Awards, for which anyone can vote. The deadline for ballots is April 15, 2017.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) announced the nominees for the 51st Annual Nebula Awards, which also includes Alyssa Wong's novelette \"You'll Surely Drown Here If You Stay\" and short story \"A Fist of Permutations in Lightning and Wildflowers\".\n\nUnderground Book Reviews named as its Editor's Choice Novel of the Year The Last Great American Magic by Durham author L.C. Fiore, calling it \"more than just an American epic. Historic fiction with a mythical twist, this exquisitely written novel is both thought-provoking and page-turning.\"\n\nSpeaking of Chappell's A Shadow All of Light, Ahdieh's The Rose and the Dagger, Chokshi's The Star-Touched Queen, and Fiore's The Last Great American Magic, these are 4 of the 118 books on the final eligibility list for the 2017 Manly Wade Wellman Award, just announced yesterday. Nominations are and will remain open until Monday, May 22, and ballots have gone out to all previously registered voters. To register to place a nominating ballot, please submit a voter registration form; the only requirement is that you are or will be be a member of one of the North Carolina science fiction and fantasy conventions.\n\nThe last section of the newsletter, before the full events calendar of course, is focused on some regional summer writing camps.\n\nFor teens, Shared Worlds 2017 will be held July 16-29 at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Visiting authors this year include Gwenda Bond, Tobias S. Buckell, N.K. Jemisin, Kathe Koja, Terra Elan McVoy, Sofia Samatar, Ekaterina Sedia, and editor-in-residence Ann VanderMeer, along with camp co-director Jeff VanderMeer and assistant director Will Hindmarch. It’s a fantastic opportunity for creativity and writing, and registration is now open. Financial aid is also available, so if you are or know a rising 8th-12th grade student with a passion for writing stories of the fantastic, let them know about this camp!\n\nCloser to home, and also for teens, the Duke Young Writers’ Camp has three 2-week sessions for both residential and day camp, across June 18 to August 4. There’s an absolutely huge staff (across the 3 sessions), workshops, readings, lectures, and more activities besides.\n\nFor my fellow grown-ups, Frostburg State University (in Frostburg, Maryland) hosts its summer Nightsun Writers Conference on July 27-30. The writing track of interest to me, and I suspect anyone reading this, is, of course, the speculative fiction track under Andy Duncan, featuring workshops and craft sessions. “The conference is designed to generate new material for publication, hone the craft of creative writing, and initiate a larger writing community for participants.” The cost for participation is $350 plus accommodations and some meals, and I would be completely lying to you if I said I hadn’t already looked up and found a very inexpensive 8-bedroom house for rental that long weekend…\n\nAll right. Before I let you go, and this may seem almost like cheating or favoritism, but it’s worth it, I do want to at least mention the two most recent of the many, many NC authored books to have been published already this year:\n\nWothwood: A Broken Cities Novella is by (for now) Durham author Natania Barron, just published by Charlotte’s Falstaff Books. “For time out of mind, the Brezhian people have protected the Wothwood, their lore passed down for generations to each clan. While rumors of a lost city within the wood pervade their mythology, none dare enter the sacred grove, the living grave of their goddess, Noduuoret. But when the Therian army arrives, intent on learning the Wothwood’s secrets, three heroes arise to challenge the threat: Lon, the warrior in exile; Glannon, the young ruler who left him to die; and Aoda, the woman of science, disfigured but unbent. Together, they enter the Wothwood. Drawn by revenge. Drawn by desire. And drawn by the thirst for knowledge.”\n\nThe Stravinsky Intrigue by Charlotte author Darin Kennedy picks up after the events of his 2015 novel The Mussorgsky Riddle. “Nine months have passed since psychic Mira Tejedor last walked the halls of Anthony Faircloth’s adolescent mind. All but family now, Mira is relocating to Charlotte, NC, not only for a much-needed change of scenery, but to further her burgeoning relationship with Dr. Thomas Archer. On the eve of her move, however, a new threat emerges. Young girls from every corner of Charlotte are falling catatonic, a condition eerily similar to the illness from which Mira rescued Anthony the previous fall. Mira reluctantly agrees to help Detective Calvin Sterling with the case and soon finds herself pulled into a new pair of fantasy worlds, both borne from the brilliant mind of Igor Stravinsky.”\n\nAnd, lastly, for quite a few back episodes I haven’t mentioned in the newsletter yet, check out the Carolina Book Beat podcast. I’ve had the chance to talk with Rysa Walker, Brent Winter, Ursula Vernon, Joe McDermott, and (of course, as she’s my co-host) Mur Lafferty in recent months. Enjoy!\n\n-Sam\n\nUPCOMING EVENTS, MARCH 2017\n\nNEW: March 7 (Tuesday) 7 pm — Flyleaf Books hosts Durham author Mur Lafferty to discuss her new books Six Wakes: A Novel and Bookburners.\n\nMarch 7 (Tuesday) 7 pm — Quail Ridge Books hosts Charlie Lovett - ‘The Lost Book of the Grail’. “It takes a bibliophile to know one.

But instead of an icy landscape, they find themselves in a forbidding jungle, with impossibly bizarre flora and fauna.

Hubert Vernon Rudolph Clayton Irving Wilson Alva Anton Jeff Harley Timothy Curtis Cleveland Cecil Ollie Edmund Eli Wiley Marvin Ellis Espinoza—known to his friends as Hubert, Etc—was too old to be at that Communist party. But after watching the breakdown of modern society, he really has no where left to be—except amongst the dregs of disaffected youth who party all night and heap scorn on the sheep they see on the morning commute. After falling in with Natalie, an ultra-rich heiress trying to escape the clutches of her repressive father, the two decide to give up fully on formal society—and walk away. After all, now that anyone can design and print the basic necessities of life—food, clothing, shelter—from a computer, there seems to be little reason to toil within the system. It’s still a dangerous world out there, the empty lands wrecked by climate change, dead cities hollowed out by industrial flight, shadows hiding predators animal and human alike. Still, when the initial pioneer walkaways flourish, more people join them. Then the walkaways discover the one thing the ultra-rich have never been able to buy: how to beat death. Now it’s war – a war that will turn the world upside down.”\n\nMay 23-28 (Tuesday to Sunday) — The Durham Performing Arts Center presents Finding Neverland, which “tells the incredible story behind one of the world’s most beloved characters: Peter Pan.

Edsel Bronfman works as a junior executive shipping clerk for an importer of Korean flatware. He lives in a seedy neighborhood and spends his free time with his spirited mother. Things happen to other people, and Bronfman knows it. Until, that is, he gets a call from operator 61217 telling him that he’s won a free weekend at a beachfront condo in Destin, Florida.
