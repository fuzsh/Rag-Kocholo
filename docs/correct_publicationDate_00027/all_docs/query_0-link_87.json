Foundation 101, Winter 2007/2008 ; in Questionable Practices, Small Beer Press, [2014], pp. 210-214.\n\nJohn KESSEL\n\n“Another Orphan” The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, September 1982; collected in Meeting in Infinity, Arkham House, 1992 ; in The Collected Kessel, Baen Books, 2012.\n\n“Herman Melville is my hero.

With an Introduction by Nicholas Jenkins. [Printed for private circulation, 1991]\n\nWendy WALKER\n\n“A Document from the Secret Archive of Grent Oude Wayl, Esquire”, in Parnassus 20:1&2 (1995), pp. 338-355, and collected in My Man and Other Critical Fictions.

Tor, 1989.\n\nII — Works contributing to the evolution and understanding of the Critical Fiction\n\nIf It Had Happened Otherwise. Lapses into Imaginary History. Edited by J. C. Squire. Longmans, Green, 1932.\n\nThe « Sources of the Nile » in counterfactual history, the most notable here being Winston Churchill’s “If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg”; certain of the “lapses” perform as critical examinations of the literary work of their subjects (Byron, Swinburne).\n\nMichael BISHOP\n\nâThe Orchid Forest: A Metafactual Introduction to The Crystal Cosmos by Rhys Hughes by Miguel Obispoâ. The New York Review of Science Fiction 19:6 (February 2007).\n\nA playful and allusive fiction that also performs the function stated in its title; indeed when I first read E.F. Bleilerâs essay on Rhys Hughes in Supernatural Fiction Writers (2002), I thought Bleiler had invented him.\n\nP. H. CANNON\n\nScream for Jeeves. A Parody. Illustrated by J.C. Eckhardt. Wodecraft Press, [1994].\n\nParody is a sometimes more fluid mode, as the imitative (or pastiche) can sometimes co-exist with the transformative aspect: Pulptime (1984) by Peter Cannon is HPL-meets-Sherlock Holmes fan fiction; in Scream for Jeeves, something else occurs at the same time as the pastiche.\n\nStanislaw LEM\n\nA Perfect Vacuum. Perfect Reviews of Nonexistent Books. Translated from the Polish by Michael Kandel. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978.\n\n“ [A] brilliantly innovative series of [. . .] glosses at the borderland of fiction and treatise [. . .] which simultaneously characterize and persiflage their targets” — Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.\n\nPaul METCALF\n\nThe Collected Works of Paul Metcalf. 3 vols., Coffee House Press, 1997.\n\n(Many of Metcalf’s pieces do what the critical fiction does, but take historical events and/or texts as their subject.)\n\nFrederick ROLFE\n\nFrederick Rolfe’s “Reviews of Unwritten Books”. Edited and with notes by Donald Weeks. 4 vols., Tragara Press, 1985-8. Essays published in The Monthly Review, February to June 1903 and The Gentleman’s Magazine, December 1904.\n\nNot strictly critical fictions, but relevant for Rolfe’s practice of upending chronology in his collisions of author and incident, as in “Machiavelli’s Despatches from the South African Campaign” or “Herodotus’ History of England”; and for his articulation of the literary principle that effects influence causes, or: the impact of later works of literature upon earlier ones. The prose is dry and acerbic, salted with classical tags and allusions.\n\nLynne TILLMAN\n\n“Madame Realism: A Fairy Tale” (1988), in This is Not It. Stories. D.A.P., 2002.\n\nGene WOLFE\n\n“The Rubber Bend”(1974), in Storeys from the Old Hotel. Kerosina, 1988.\n\nPastiche of Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe, with allusion to C.L. Dodgson, Alice in Wonderland, and Charles Peirce: “ ‘Do you mean to say,’ I exclaimed, ‘that your reading led you to the solution of this remarkable case?’ ”\n\nVirginia WOOLF\n\n“The Lives of the Obscure”, in The Common Reader, Harcourt, Brace and World, 1953; “Dr. Burney’s Evening Party”, in The Second Common Reader, Harcourt, Brace, and World, 1960; and various other pieces in The Death of the Moth, Granite and Rainbow, and The Captain’s Death Bed.\n\n(Virtuoso fictional recreations that also discuss, drawing heavily upon literary sources.)\n\n« criticalfiction.net » is published by Temporary Culture, P.O. Box 43072, Upper Montclair, NJ 07043."
