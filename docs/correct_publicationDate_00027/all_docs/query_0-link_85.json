        "text": "Drunk on Ink Q & A with Thrity Umrigar and “The Secrets Between Us”\n\nDrunk on Ink is a blast interview series by Soniah Kamal author of the novel Unmarriageable a parallel retelling of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and set in contemporary Pakistan\n\nRead Jaggery Issue 11 Spring 2018\n\nThrity Umrigar is the author of a memoir, a picture book and eight novels, including The Space Between Us, The Secrets Between Us and Everybody’s Son. Her books have been published in over fifteen countries. She is the recipient of the Nieman Fellowship to Harvard and is a professor of English at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nAbout The Secrets Between Us\n\nBhima, the unforgettable main character of Thrity Umrigar’s beloved national bestseller The Space Between Us, returns in this sequel in which the former servant struggles against the circumstances of class and misfortune to forge a new path for herself and her granddaughter in modern India.Poor and illiterate, Bhima had faithfully worked for the Dubash family, an upper-middle-class Parsi household, for more than twenty years. Yet after courageously speaking the truth about a heinous crime perpetrated against her own family, the devoted servant was cruelly fired. The sting of that dismissal was made more painful coming from Sera Dubash, the temperamental employer who had long been Bhima’s only confidante. A woman who has endured despair and loss with stoicism, Bhima must now find some other way to support herself and her granddaughter, Maya. Bhima’s fortunes take an unexpected turn when her path intersects with Parvati, a bitter, taciturn older woman. The two acquaintances soon form a tentative business partnership, selling fruits and vegetables at the local market. As they work together, these two women seemingly bound by fate grow closer, each confessing the truth about their lives and the wounds that haunt them. Discovering her first true friend, Bhima pieces together a new life, and together, the two women learn to stand on their own.\n\nSoniah Kamal: First author/book you read/fell in love with?\n\nThrity Umrigar: East of Eden by John Steinbeck.\n\nTo unwind: chai, coffee, water, wine?\n\nWine, baby.\n\nA novel, short story, poem, essay, anything you believe should be mandatory reading?\n\nBeloved by Toni Morrison\n\nAny classic you wished you’d pushed through in your teens?\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude. I couldn’t understand it as a teenager, so I gave up reading it, back then.\n\nFavorite quote from your book\n\nOr perhaps it is that time doesn’t heal wounds at all, perhaps that is the biggest lie of them all, and instead what happens is that each would penetrates the body deeper and deeper until one day you fine that the sheer geography of your bones, the angle of your hips, the sharpness of your shoulders– as well as the luster of your eyes, the texture of your skin, the openness of your smile, has collapsed under the weight of your grief–\n\nfrom The Space Between Us\n\nFavorite book to film? And why?\n\nQ&A, which became Slumdog Millionaire. Because it was one of those rare occasions where the film was better than the book.\n\nFavorite Indie Book Store/s?\n\nLoganberry Books in Cleveland; Powell’s in Portland; Book Passage in Marin County, California.\n\nThe one think you wish you’d known about the writing life?\n\nThat people like me—female, brown, immigrant–could tell stories and didn’t have to ask someone’s permission in order to do so. And that everyone has a story to tell but most people get distracted by other things in life and so their stories remain untold.\n\nDoes writing/publishing/marketing get any easier with each story/novel published?\n\nNo. I still love the writing part. But the publishing and marketing doesn’t get any easier because publishers want the new, the young, the undiscovered. And more and more, writers are expected to market their own books on social media etc. so that you’re forever begging the same fifty friends to please buy your book. It’s hard and embarrassing.\n\nDog, Cat, Or?\n\nCat. But all animals, really.\n\nIdeal vacation?\n\nAny city with bookstores, sidewalk cafes, and museums that’s on the water.\n\nFavorite book cover?\n\nLove the classic “billboard” jacket from The Great Gatsby.\n\nFavorite song?\n\nA Day in the Life by The Beatles\n\nAny Lit Festival anecdote you want a share? A great meeting with a fan? An epiphany?\n\nFavorite memory is when an Indian reader, who was temporarily in the U.S., came to a book talk and pulled me aside and told me about the time she’d dismissed her maid in India after she caught her stealing a bottle of milk. After she read my novel, The Space Between Us, she said the novel changed her life. She had sought me out specifically to tell me that she’d resolved that when she returned to India, she would provide food and milk for the new maid’s children everyday. That’s the first time I realized the power of words to change hearts.\n\nRecommend a Small Press and/or Literary Journal?\n\nUnbridled Books publishes some great books.\n\nLast impulse book buy and why?\n\nLook At Me by Jennifer Egan because I love Jenny’s work but had never read this particular book.\n\nSoniah Kamal is an award winning novelist, essayist and public speaker. Soniah’s novel Unmarriageable is a Financial Times Readers’ Best Book of 2019, a People’s Magazine Pick, a Library Reads Pick, an NPR Code Switch Summer Read Pick, a 2019 Book All Georgians Should Read, a 2020 Georgia Author of the Year for Literary Fiction nominee and more. Her novel An Isolated Incident was shortlisted for the Townsend Prize for Fiction and the KLF French Fiction Prize. Soniah’s TEDx talk is about second chances and she has delivered numerous keynotes addreses. ‘We are the Ink’, her address at a U.S. Citizenship Oath Ceremony, talks about immigrants and the real American Dreams, her keynote at the Jane Austen Festival is about universality across time and cultures and she’s given keynotes at Writers Conferences. Soniah’s work has appeared in critically acclaimed anthologies and publications including The New York Times, The Guardian, The Georgia Review, The Bitter Southerner, Catapult, The Normal School, Apartment Therapy and more. www.soniahkamal.com\n\nShe’s on twitter and instagram @soniahkamal\n\nMore Drunk on Ink Interviews:\n\nMike Chen: Here and Now and Then, a novel\n\nRuth Franklin: Shirley Jackson A Rather Haunted Life, biography\n\nColleen Oakley: Before I Go, a novel\n\nEmily Midorikawa: A Secret Sisterhood: The literary friendships of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, and Virginia Woolf, biography\n\nShabnam Samuel: A Fractured Life, memoir\n\nElise Hooper: The Other Alcott, a novel\n\nAnne Boyd Rioux: Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy: The Story of Little Women and Why It Still Matters, non fiction\n\nDevoney Looser: The Making of Jane Austen, non fiction\n\nKristen Miller Zohn: The Currency of Taste- Gibbons Georgian Silver, coffee table book\n\nVanessa Hua, A River of Stars, novel\n\nChaitli Sen, The Pathless Sky, novel\n\nSonya Huber, Pain Woman Take Your Keys, memoir\n\nKathy Wilson Florence, Three of Cups, a novel\n\nSara Luce Look, Charis Books and More, independent book store\n\nS J Sindu, Marriage of a Thousand Lies, a novel\n\nRosalie Morales Kearns, Kingdom of Men, a novel\n\nSaadia Faruqi, Meet Yasmin, children’s literature\n\nRene Denfeld: The Child Finder, a novel\n\nJamie Brenner, The Husband Hour, a novel\n\nSara Marchant, The Driveway has Two Sides, memoir\n\nKirsten Imani Kasai, The House of Erzulie, a novel\n\nThrity Umrigar, The Secrets Between Us, novel\n\nJohn Kessel, Pride and Prometheus, novel\n\nLisa Romeo, Starting with Goodbye: A Daughter’s Memoir of Love After Loss\n\nRachel May, An American Quilt: Unfolding a Story of Family and Slavery\n\nRebecca Entel, Fingerprints of Previous Owners, novel\n\nJamie Sumner, Unbound: Finding from Unrealistic Expectations of Motherhood\n\nFalguni Kothari, My Last Love Story, novel\n\nTanaz Bathena, A Girl Like That, YA novel\n\nDrunk on Ink Q & A with John Kessel and “Pride and Prometheus”\n\nDrunk on Ink is a blast interview series by Soniah Kamal author of the novel Unmarriageable a parallel retelling of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and set in contemporary Pakistan\n\nRead Jaggery Issue 11 Spring 2018\n\nJohn Kessel’s speculative fiction includes the recently published Pride and Prometheus, the novels The Moon and the Other, Good News from Outer Space, Corrupting Dr. Nice, and Freedom Beach (with James Patrick Kelly), and the story collections Meeting in Infinity, The Pure Product, and The Baum Plan for Financial Independence and Other Stories. His fiction has received the Nebula Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award, the Locus Award, the James Tiptree Jr. Award, and the Shirley Jackson Award. Kessel teaches American literature and fiction writing at North Carolina State University where he helped found the MFA program in creative writing and served twice as its director. He lives with his wife, the novelist Therese Anne Fowler, in Raleigh.\n\nIn Pride and Prometheus, Pride and Prejudice meets Frankenstein as Mary Bennet falls for the enigmatic Victor Frankenstein and befriends his monstrous Creature in this fusion of two popular classics. Threatened with destruction unless he fashions a wife for his Creature, Victor Frankenstein travels to England where he meets Mary and Kitty Bennet, the remaining unmarried sisters of the Bennet family from Pride and Prejudice. As Mary and Victor become increasingly attracted to each other, the Creature looks on impatiently, waiting for his bride. But where will Victor find a female body from which to create the monster’s mate? Meanwhile, the awkward Mary hopes that Victor will save her from approaching spinsterhood while wondering what dark secret he is keeping from her. Pride and Prometheus fuses the gothic horror of Mary Shelley with the Regency romance of Jane Austen in an exciting novel that combines two age-old stories in a fresh and startling way.\n\nSoniah Kamal: First author/book you read/fell in love with?\n\nJohn Kessel: I can’t remember the first I ever read. I did fall in love with the early Andre Norton science fiction novels like The Stars are Ours, The Time Traders, Star Man’s Son. And my uncle gave me an anthology of sf stories he found in a house he rented, Groff Conklin’s Omnibus of Science Fiction, which I read cover to cover repeatedly.\n\nTo unwind: chai, coffee, water, wine?\n\nWine. I like Spanish reds.\n\nA novel, short story, poem, essay, anything you believe should be mandatory reading?\n\n“The Poacher” by Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nAny classic you wished you’d pushed through in your teens?\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird. I might have read it then but at this point probably never will.\n\nA favorite quote from Pride and Prometheus\n\n“. . . she had no power to change what the world would think and do. But that was the nature of love: one did not offer it with any assurance that it would change the world, even if in the end it was the only thing that could.”\n\nFavorite book to film?\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nFavorite Indie Book Store/s?\n\nQuail Ridge Books in Raleigh\n\nThe one think you wish you’d known about the writing life?\n\nYou always feel like it’s Sunday night and your homework is due tomorrow morning.\n\nDoes writing/publishing/marketing get any easier with each story/novel published?\n\nI may know more, but that does not make it easier. But it’s still worth it.\n\nDog, Cat, Or?\n\nCat, most definitely.\n\nFavorite book cover?\n\nMy own or somebody else’s? I like the cover of Karel Capek’s 1936 satirical novel War With the Newts. Of my own, I like The Moon and the Other from last year.\n\nFavorite song?\n\n“Solitude” by Duke Ellington\n\nFavorite Small Press and Literary Journal?\n\nTachyon Books of San Francisco\n\nLast impulse book buy and why?\n\nEnlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, by Steven Pinker. I had never read anything by him; I knew he was controversial and suspected I might not agree with everything he says; I believe in science, reason, humanism, and the possibility of progress; I wanted to hear some good news about the human race.\n\nSoniah Kamal is an award winning novelist, essayist and public speaker.

Her short nonfiction is listed in Best American Essays 2016, and has appeared in the New York Times, O The Oprah Magazine, Longreads, Brevity, Under the Sun, Hippocampus, The Manifest Station, Brain Child, Sweet, Inside Jersey, and many other places. She teaches in an MFA program and lives in northern New Jersey with her husband and sons.\n\nStarting with Goodbye, published by University of Nevada Press, asks if it’s ever too late to (re)connect with a parent. When Lisa Romeo’s late father drops in for “conversations,” she wonders why the parent she dismissed in life now holds her spellbound. Lisa reconsiders her affluent upbringing and the emotional distance that grew when he left New Jersey and retired to Las Vegas. She questions death rituals, family dynamics, Italian-American customs, midlife motherhood, and her own marriage as their new father-daughter relationship transforms grief and delivers powerful lessons about the bonds that last past death.\n\nSoniah Kamal: First author/book you read/fell in love with?\n\nLisa Romeo: From the time I could read at age 5, there were so many children’s books about horses that I read in nonstop gulps, and I can’t remember the name of a single one. The earliest books I remember for certain loving were National Velvet by Enid Bagnold, and Karen by Marie Killilea. The former because I lived and breathed horses, the latter I think because it was the first nonfiction book I read for pleasure and I was so taken by the idea that someone’s life—a non-famous person—could be in a book\n\nTo unwind: chai, coffee, water, wine?\n\nOne glass of Moscato or Riesling. Unless I’m hot, then I only want ice cold water!\n\nA novel, short story, poem, essay, anything you believe should be mandatory reading?\n\nHmm…this is tricky. I want to ask, mandatory for whom? But absent that, the way I’m feeling most days, I’d say “The Second Coming” by William Butler Yeats.\n\nAny classic you wished you’d pushed through in your teens?\n\nA lot of them! I read nonstop, but my schooling didn’t include a lot of classics…or maybe it did and I can’t remember. Which I suppose means I need to read or re-read them all. I think in my teens I would have had more patience for Jane Austen, especially because I always longed to live in England.\n\nA favorite quote from your book J\n\n“This father is gone, never was, and is sitting right next to me.”\n\nYour favorite book to film?\n\nI’m so easily and consistently disappointed by most film adaptations of books I’ve loved. Purely for fun I’d say, Under the Tuscan Sun! Based on the book by Frances Mayes.\n\nFavorite Indie Book Store/s?\n\nJust a few miles from home: Watchung Booksellers, Montclair, NJ. The staff really know their stock and make interesting recommendations but will also leave you alone; there are author events at the store several times a week; and it has that quiet but sublimely buzzy vibe I like in a bookstore.\n\nThe one thing you wish you’d known about the writing life?\n\nHow long the learning curve is, how that learning curve never ends, how you’re never really finished nor completely satisfied with what you’ve produced, even after it’s published!\n\nDoes writing/publishing/marketing get any easier with each story/novel published?\n\nI’ve just published my first book, so I can’t speak to what it will be like to move on to book two. Though I’m guessing: equally difficult! I’ve published hundreds of essays, articles, and other short nonfiction pieces, and each one poses its own challenge to write and place. It doesn’t get easier, you just know more and can avoid the obvious mistakes.\n\nDog, Cat, Or?\n\nI’m a horse person from way back. I had five horses over about 17 years, and I rode and competed in hunter-jumper horse shows from my teens to my early 30s.\n\nFavorite book cover?\n\nThis changes constantly! I suppose I should say my own, since it’s a photograph of my father that I took. But recently, my favorite cover is Still Life with Horses, a memoir by Jean Harper. A horse’s eye is very special and the artist (Benedicte Gele) captured it perfectly in pastels and chalk. Take a look, you’ll see.\n\nFavorite song?\n\nStrictly because it takes me back to meeting my husband and hearing him sing for the first time: “Cat’s in the Cradle” by Harry Chapin. (My husband, I must note, became the anti-thesis to the neglectful father in the song!)\n\nRecommend a Small Press and Literary Journal?\n\nSarabande Books does a lot of interesting things with essay and other nonfiction forms.\n\nMissouri Review, for overall consistency and readability. I’m never disappointed.\n\nLast impulse book buy and why?\n\nWorking Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner by Judy Melinek, MD and T.J. Mitchell. Because I was wandering through a bookstore after doing a reading, and my eye always lands on books about death and the many things that might come after! (I’m strange that way).\n\nSoniah Kamal is an award winning novelist, essayist and public speaker.
