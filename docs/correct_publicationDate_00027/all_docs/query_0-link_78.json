        "text": "The Kickstarter for Geek Theater, an anthology of science fiction and fantasy stage plays, launched yesterday. Thank you to everyone who has backed our project and who has helped to spread the word. We still have a way to go to hit our goal.\n\nWe thought the second day of our campaign would be a good time to introduce Geek Theater’s authors and playwrights. Please note that we are still in the process of building the Table of Contents, and more people and plays will be added as they are confirmed. However, we are thrilled to already have such a strong group of science fiction and fantasy authors and playwrights for Geek Theater.\n\nGEEK THEATER’S AUTHORS & PLAYWRIGHTS\n\n(in alphabetical order)\n\nJeanne Beckwith’s plays have been performed from coast to coast and in between.
