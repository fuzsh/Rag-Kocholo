Here he finds himself in a vicious circle of social stigma, poverty and exploitation. He represents a growing number of refugee migrant poor population who are forced to lead a life of penury.\n\nThis migratory population settle on the periphery of big cities and start doing menial jobs to earn a living. Due to extreme poverty Saheb’s parents are unable to provide for him and so he ends up picking rags for his own survival as well as to support his parents. The author says that Saheb scrounges for ‘gold’ in the garbage. Anything valuable like used clothes, shoes, bits of metal, plastic scrap, stray coins and currency notes can be termed as gold for them.\n\nQuestion 38. What change did Anees Jung see in Saheb when she saw him standing by the gate of the neighbourhood club? (Comptt. Delhi 2010)\n\nAnswer: Saheb was a poor ragpicker who later takes up a job at a tea-stall in an attempt to be a master of his own destiny. But unfortunately this move further enslaves him. His new job replaces his light polythene bag with a heavy steel canister.\n\nIt even deprives him of roaming around with his friends without a care in the world. Earlier, though he did not have the security of a regular income, he had his freedom, and later he did have an assured income at the end of the month but he had lost his freedom. He was no more a free bird and his own master. He appeared burdened and forlorn. He was now a bonded labour who had surrendered his freedom. From being a spirited free bird who was not answerable to anyone he has become bound.

All India 2010)\n\nAnswer: Most of the squatters at Seemapuri were refugees from Bangladesh.\n\nAlso: Most of the people like Saheb-e-Alam settled in Seemapuri were refugees from Bangladesh\n\nwho had fled their country and migrated to Delhi from Dhaka in the wake of the 1971 Indo- Pak war. Their dwellings were structures of mud, tin and tarpaulin with no sewage, drainage or running water. Picking garbage and rags helped them to earn their daily bread, gave them a roof over their heads and was their only means of livelihood and survival. Though these squatters of Seemapuri have no identity but they do have valid ration cards that enable them to buy grain. Living in Seemapuri, which is on the periphery of Delhi, is like living in hell. Children here grow up to become partners in survival to their parents. An army of barefoot children appears every morning, carrying their plastic bags on their shoulders and disappear by noon. They are forced to live a life of abject poverty that results in the loss of childhood innocence.\n\nSaheb, a ragpicker, roamed in the streets, scrounging for garbage, barefoot and deprived of education. Later he starts working in a tea stall but he loses his freedom and carefree life as he is no longer his own master.\n\nQuestion 40. What does Anees Jung tell us about life at Mukesh’s home in Ferozabad? (Comptt. AT 2010)\n\nAnswer: Mukesh’s father represents the underpaid, over exploited bangle makers of Ferozabad who is a victim of his own caste and is caught in a vicious circle of Sahnkars, middlemen, politi¬cians and policemen. He leads a hand-to-mouth existence in a shack with his family which includes two elderly parents, two sons and a daughter-in-law. Lack of education and awareness, the stigma of caste and a vicious nexus of people who exploit them have killed all initiative and drive in the young and the old. Time seems to stand still in Mukesh’s home in Ferozabad. There is no progress and no development despite years of mind- numbing toil. All the labourers of Ferozabad are victims of middlemen and touts. Their desire to dream and dare is snubbed in their childhood. They have no choice but to accept their subservience silently as their spirit is broken and their initiative dormant.\n\nDownload NCERT Solutions for Class 12 for free on Infinity Learn.\n\nQuestion 41. Give a brief account of the life and activities of the people like Saheb-e-Alam settled in Seemapuri. (Delhi 2011 )\n\nAnswer: Refer to Question 49, Page 166\n\nQuestion 42. ‘Lost Spring’ explains the grinding poverty and traditions that condemn thousands of people to a life of abject poverty. Do you agree? Why/Why not? (All India 2011)\n\nAnswer: ‘Lost Spring’ does indeed highlight the miserable plight of thousands of poor people whose life is completely marred by abject poverty and thoughtless traditions. They work extremely hard in the most pathetic conditions and accept poverty and exploitation as their destiny.\n\nThrough the lives of Saheb-e-Alam, a ragpicker, and Mukesh, a bangle maker, the author highlights the vicious circle of social stigma and poverty which these people are subjected to. Saheb and Mukesh also represent a growing number of refugee migrants and people who are forced to live a life of penury.\n\nNo one shows any kind of compassion or sensitivity to their pathetic plight and there is also no initiative or commitment for the upliftment of these downtrodden people. Acute poverty, no education and no infrastructural development has drained their energy and willpower and they have no choice but to accept their destiny of inevitable poverty.\n\nQuestion 43. What circumstances forced Mukesh not to pursue his family business of bangle making? Instead, what did he decide to do? (Comptt. Delhi 2012)\n\nAnswer: Mukesh dares to dream of a different life and decides not to pursue his family business of bangle-making. He does not want to accept his life of misery in the name of destiny. Though he is born in a poverty-ridden family in the caste of bangle makers he dreams of a better future.\n\nHe wants to break free from the vicious circle of sahukars and middlemen and carve a new beginning for himself by becoming a motor- mechanic. He knows what it is like to work in glass furnaces that are neither well-lit nor well- ventilated. They are dingy hovels with high temperatures.\n\nHe has seen that the youngsters are weighed down by the baggage of generations of subservience and have forgotten to dream of an alternative world. So Mukesh’s dream of going to a garage and learning to be a motor-mechanic is an attempt to break free off the mind-numbing toil.\n\nQuestion 44. In 1971 Bangladeshi migrants came to Delhi ‘looking for gold in the big city’. What kind of life are they living in Seemapuri now? (Comptt. Delhi 2012)\n\nAnswer: Most of the people like Saheb-e-Alam settled in Seemapuri were refugees from Bangladesh who had fled their country and migrated to Delhi from Dhaka in the wake of the 1971 Indo- Pak war. Their dwellings were structures of mud, tin and tarpaulin with no sewage, drainage or running water.\n\nPicking garbage and rags helped them to earn their daily bread, gave them a roof over their heads and was their only means of livelihood and survival.

Describe the difficulties the bangle makers of Firozabad have to face in their lives. (Delhi 2015 2012)\n\nAnswer: Through the story of the bangle-makers of Ferozabad, the author expresses her concern over their exploitation in the hazardous job of bangle-making. Extreme poverty, hard work and dismal working conditions result in the loss of the childhood of children who are in this profession.\n\nThe working conditions of all bangle-makers are pathetic and miserable. They work in high temperature, badly lit and poorly ventilated glass furnaces due to which child workers especially are at risk of losing their eyesight at an early age and get prone to other health hazards.\n\nThe stinking lanes of Ferozabad are choked with garbage and humans and animals live together in these hovels. There is no development or progress in their lives with the passage of time. They have no choice but to work in these inhuman conditions. Mind-numbing toil kills their dreams and hopes. They are condemned to live and die in squalor, subjected to a life of poverty and perpetual exploitation.\n\nQuestion 46. Describe the circumstances which keep the workers in the bangle industry in poverty. (Delhi 2015)\n\nAnswer: Through the story of the bangle makers of Firozabad, the author expresses concern over their exploitation in the hazardous job of bangle making and addresses the circumstances which keep the workers in poverty. They live in stinking lanes, choked with garbage in homes.\n\nTheir houses are hovels with families of humans and animals coexisting in a primeval state. They cannot organise themselves into cooperatives. Their families are caught in a web of poverty and in a vicious circle of the sahukars, the middlemen, the keepers of law, the policemen, the bureaucrats and the politicians who impose on them a baggage which they cannot put down. They move in a spiral from poverty, to apathy, to greed and to injustice.\n\nQuestion 47. How is Mukesh’s attitude towards his situation different from that of Saheb? Why? (Delhi 2015)\n\nAnswer: Mukesh’s attitude towards his situation is different from that of Saheb. Mukesh is more of a rebel who dares to be different and wishes to become a motor mechanic. Though, Mukesh too, like his community, is working in back breaking, mind-numbing glass industry but unlike his peers, the spark in him has not extinguished.\n\nHe wants to break free from the vicious circle which his community has been caught in. Saheb, on the other hand, has enslaved himself. By taking up work in the tea stall he is no longer his own master. The difference in their attitude towards their situation can be attributed to the fact that Saheb is a rootless migrant from Bangladesh and Mukesh is a citizen of India. Moreover, Mukesh dares to dream. The author too senses a flash of daring in Mukesh and this is what makes his attitude a little more aggressive than Saheb.\n\nAlso Check: NCERT Solutions For Class 12 English Flamingo Lost Spring\n\nQuestion 48. “It is his karam, his destiny” that made Mukesh’s grandfather go blind.

He mustered the courage to break free from the family lineage of bangle making.\n\nHe had seen his parents and others suffering because of the vicious circle of poverty and exploitation that they were caught in.

Mukesh dares to dream of a different life and decides not to pursue his family business of bangle-making. He does not want to accept his life of misery in the name of destiny.

Seemapuri houses around 10,000 ragpickers mostly Bangladeshi refugees, who have lived there for more than thirty years without an identity and without permits. These people live in mud structures with roofs made of tin and tarpaulin. The ration cards that enable them to get their names on voters’ lists and enable them to buy grain and garbage are their means of survival.
