        "text": "Nominations for a working Slipstream canon were received from F. Brett Cox, Paul Di Filippo, Ron Drummond, Theodora Goss, John Kessel, Victoria McManus, Graham Sleight, and Catherynne M. Valente, with supplementary titles suggested by John Crowley and Kelly Link.\n\nThe eight panelists then voted on every title on the resulting list of 264 books (plus four authors whose “complete works” were also nominated), assigning zero, one, two, or three points to each title. The results were tabulated and ranked by vote, and then separated into two lists.\n\nOn the primary list, “A Working Canon of Slipstream Writings”, which contains 112 books and three authors’ complete works, only works that received ten or more votes were included. Then, to sharpen the usefulness of the list, the top 27 items, listed in bold type, can be safely considered “The Core Canon of Slipstream”; these works all received 15 or more votes each. Only one work, Borges’s Collected Fictions, received 3 votes from all eight panelists, for 24 votes total (though the top nine titles received 20 or more votes each).\n\nIn creating the rankings, works sharing a single vote total are ranked chronologically by publication date, from earliest to latest (though posthumously-published collections and “complete works” are placed based on the year of the given author’s death). So, for example, Dhalgren and Burning Your Boats received 21 votes each, but the Delany is placed first because it’s the earlier work. Yes, the system is somewhat arbitrary, but the whole enterprise is as well: and this is a working list.A secondary list, of the bottom 152 titles (plus one author’s complete works), is provided as a list of “Other Important Non-Canonical Slipstream or Slipstream-related Writings”. Two supplementary lists are also appended: A list of women writers of slipstream, compiled by Theodora Goss from suggestions by panelists (see the previous two lists for specific suggested titles); and a list of slipstream-related works by the panelists themselves, compiled by F. Brett Cox.Panelist Ron Drummond compiled the voting list from panelists’ nominations, tabulated the voting results, researched the titles, compiled the primary and secondary lists and wrote their respective introductions.\n\nThe Core Canon of Slipstream\n\n1.
