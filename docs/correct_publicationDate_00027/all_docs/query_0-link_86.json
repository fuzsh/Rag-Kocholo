        "text": "“Pride and Prometheus,” a story in The Baum Plan for Financial Independence involving characters from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, is winner of the 2008 Nebula award for Best Novelette.\n\nAn astonishing, long-awaited collection of stories that intersect imaginatively with Pride and Prejudice, Frankenstein, The Wizard of Oz, and Flannery O’Connor. Includes John Kessel’s modern classic “Lunar Quartet” sequence about life on the moon.\n\n“A sustained exploration of the ways gender dynamics can both empower and enslave us. Kessel’s wit sparkles throughout, peaking with the most uproariously weird phone-sex conversation you’ll ever read (“The Red Phone”).”\n\n—Entertainment Weekly A-\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Baum Plan for Financial Independence [audio]\n\nEvery Angel is Terrifying [audio]\n\nDowntown\n\nThe Last American\n\nThe Invisible Empire\n\nA Lunar Quartet\n\n– The Juniper Tree\n\n– Stories for Men\n\n– Under the Lunchbox Tree\n\n– Sunlight or Rock\n\nThe Snake Girl\n\nIt’s All True\n\nThe Red Phone\n\nPowerless\n\nPride and Prometheus [part 1 | part 2]\n\nHardcover dustjacket easter egg:\n\nReviews\n\n— SciFi.com\n\n— Metro Arts\n\n— Foreword — Dependable Erection(!)\n\n— Book Sense Pick\n\n— Podcasts\n\n“One of the best collections of the year.” — Locus\n\n“These well-crafted stories, full of elegantly drawn characters, deliver a powerful emotional punch.”\n\n— Publishers Weekly\n\n“Kessel is a deft stylist and a master of all his tools, whose range is nearly limitless.”\n\n— SciFi.com\n\n“John Kessel’s writing exists at the edge of things, in the dark corner where the fiction section abuts the science-fiction shelves, in the hyphen where magic meets realism. Reading Kessel’s wonderful fabulations is like staying out too late partying and seeing strange angels while stumbling home in the dawn’s first light. This is one of those too rare short story collections that you can recommend with confidence to both the literary snob and the hard-core computer geek.”\n\n— Rich Rennicks, Malaprop’s Bookstore, Asheville, NC\n\n“Critics were all excited to see another anthology from Kessel … not only did Kessel pull off these stories with gusto but he did so in such a way that readers can enjoy his tales even if they have not read the original authors.”\n\n— Bookmarks Magazine\n\nLibrary Thing\n\nOn the web:\n\nJohn Kessel’s home page\n\nA sneak peek at the collection in the Raleigh News & Observer.\n\nScifi Weekly Interview with Kessel and James Patrick Kelly by John Joseph Adams (2006)\n\nScifidimensions audio interview (2002)\n\nStrange Horizons interview (2001)\n\nLocus Interview, Hour of the Wolf (w/Jim Kelly) (1997)\n\nInterview (1993)\n\nIMDB | ISFDB | Wikipedia | Library Thing\n\nFind The Baum Plan in a library near you.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJohn Kessel co-directs the creative writing program at North Carolina State University in Raleigh.
