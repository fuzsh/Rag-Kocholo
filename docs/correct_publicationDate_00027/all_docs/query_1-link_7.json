For other uses, see infinity (disambiguation) and infinity sign (disambiguation).\n\n∞ {\\displaystyle \\infty }\n\nInfinity symbol\n\nIn UnicodeU+221E ∞ INFINITY (&infin;)Different fromDifferent fromU+267E ♾ PERMANENT PAPER SIGN\n\nU+26AD ⚭ MARRIAGE SYMBOL\n\nU+221D ∝ PROPORTIONAL TO\n\nThe infinity symbol (∞) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. This symbol is also called a lemniscate,[1] after the lemniscate curves of a similar shape studied in algebraic geometry,[2] or \"lazy eight\", in the terminology of livestock branding.[3]\n\nThis symbol was first used mathematically by John Wallis in the 17th century, although it has a longer history of other uses. In mathematics, it often refers to infinite processes (potential infinity) rather than infinite values (actual infinity). It has other related technical meanings, such as the use of long-lasting paper in bookbinding, and has been used for its symbolic value of the infinite in modern mysticism and literature. It is a common element of graphic design, for instance in corporate logos as well as in older designs such as the Métis flag.\n\nBoth the infinity symbol itself and several variations of the symbol are available in various character encodings.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe lemniscate has been a common decorative motif since ancient times; for instance, it is commonly seen on Viking Age combs.[4]\n\nThe English mathematician John Wallis is credited with introducing the infinity symbol with its mathematical meaning in 1655, in his De sectionibus conicis.[5][6][7] Wallis did not explain his choice of this symbol. It has been conjectured to be a variant form of a Roman numeral, but which Roman numeral is unclear. One theory proposes that the infinity symbol was based on the numeral for 100 million, which resembled the same symbol enclosed within a rectangular frame.[8] Another proposes instead that it was based on the notation CIↃ used to represent 1,000.[9] Instead of a Roman numeral, it may alternatively be derived from a variant of ω, the lower-case form of omega, the last letter in the Greek alphabet.[9]\n\nPerhaps in some cases because of typographic limitations, other symbols resembling the infinity sign have been used for the same meaning.[7] One paper by Leonhard Euler was typeset with an open letterform more closely resembling a reflected and sideways S than a lemniscate (something like S),[10] and even \"O–O\" has been used as a stand-in for the infinity symbol itself.[7]\n\nUsage\n\n[edit]\n\nMathematics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn mathematics, the infinity symbol is typically used to represent a potential infinity.[11] For instance, in mathematical expressions with summations and limits such as\n\n∑ n = 0 ∞ 1 2 n = lim x → ∞ 2 x − 1 2 x − 1 = 2 , {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }{\\frac {1}{2^{n}}}=\\lim _{x\\to \\infty }{\\frac {2^{x}-1}{2^{x-1}}}=2,}\n\nthe infinity sign is conventionally interpreted as meaning that the variable grows arbitrarily large towards infinity, rather than actually taking an infinite value, although other interpretations are possible.[12]\n\nWhen quantifying actual infinity, infinite entities taken as objects per se, other notations are typically used. For example, ℵ 0 {\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0}} (aleph-nought) denotes the cardinal number representing the size of the set of natural numbers, and ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } (omega) denotes the smallest ordinal number which is larger than all natural numbers.\n\nThe infinity symbol may also be used to represent a point at infinity, especially when there is only one such point under consideration. This usage includes, in particular, the infinite point of a projective line,[13] and the point added to a topological space to form its one-point compactification.[14]\n\nOther technical uses\n\n[edit]\n\nIn areas other than mathematics, the infinity symbol may take on other related meanings. For instance, it has been used in bookbinding to indicate that a book is printed on acid-free paper and will therefore be long-lasting.[15] On cameras and their lenses, the infinity symbol indicates that the lens's focal length is set to an infinite distance, and is \"probably one of the oldest symbols to be used on cameras\".[16]\n\nSymbolism and literary uses\n\n[edit]\n\nIn modern mysticism, the infinity symbol has become identified with a variation of the ouroboros, an ancient image of a snake eating its own tail that has also come to symbolize the infinite, and the ouroboros is sometimes drawn in figure-eight form to reflect this identification—rather than in its more traditional circular form.[18]\n\nIn the works of Vladimir Nabokov, including The Gift and Pale Fire, the figure-eight shape is used symbolically to refer to the Möbius strip and the infinite, as is the case in these books' descriptions of the shapes of bicycle tire tracks and of the outlines of half-remembered people. Nabokov's poem after which he entitled Pale Fire explicitly refers to \"the miracle of the lemniscate\".[19] Other authors whose works use this shape with its symbolic meaning of the infinite include James Joyce, in Ulysses,[20] and David Foster Wallace, in Infinite Jest.[21]\n\nGraphic design\n\n[edit]\n\nThe well-known shape and meaning of the infinity symbol have made it a common typographic element of graphic design. For instance, the Métis flag, used by the Canadian Métis people since the early 19th century, is based around this symbol.[22] Different theories have been put forward for the meaning of the symbol on this flag, including the hope for an infinite future for Métis culture and its mix of European and First Nations traditions,[23][24] but also evoking the geometric shapes of Métic dances,[25], Celtic knots,[26] or Plains First Nations Sign Language.[27]\n\nA rainbow-coloured infinity symbol is also used by the autism rights movement, as a way to symbolize the infinite variation of the people in the movement and of human cognition.[28] The Bakelite company took up this symbol in its corporate logo to refer to the wide range of varied applications of the synthetic material they produced.[29] Versions of this symbol have been used in other trademarks, corporate logos, and emblems including those of Fujitsu,[30] Cell Press,[31] and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[32]\n\nEncoding\n\n[edit]\n\nThe symbol is encoded in Unicode at U+221E ∞ INFINITY[33] and in LaTeX as \\infty: ∞ {\\displaystyle \\infty } .[34] An encircled version is encoded for use as a symbol for acid-free paper.\n\nCharacter information Preview ∞ ♾ Unicode name INFINITY PERMANENT PAPER SIGN Encodings decimal hex dec hex Unicode 8734 U+221E 9854 U+267E UTF-8 226 136 158 E2 88 9E 226 153 190 E2 99 BE GB 18030 161 222 A1 DE 129 55 174 56 81 37 AE 38 Numeric character reference &#8734; &#x221E; &#9854; &#x267E; Named character reference &infin; OEM-437 (Alt Code)[35] 236 EC Mac OS Roman[36] 176 B0 Symbol Font encoding[37] 165 A5 Shift JIS[38] 129 135 81 87 EUC-JP[39] 161 231 A1 E7 EUC-KR[40] / UHC[41] 161 196 A1 C4 EUC-KPS-9566[42] 162 172 A2 AC Big5[43] 161 219 A1 DB LaTeX[34] \\infty \\acidfree CLDR text-to-speech name[44] infinity sign infinity\n\nThe Unicode set of symbols also includes several variant forms of the infinity symbol that are less frequently available in fonts in the block Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B.[45]\n\nCharacter information Preview ⧜ ⧝ ⧞ Unicode name INCOMPLETE INFINITY TIE OVER INFINITY INFINITY NEGATED WITH VERTICAL BAR Encodings decimal hex dec hex dec hex Unicode 10716 U+29DC 10717 U+29DD 10718 U+29DE UTF-8 226 167 156 E2 A7 9C 226 167 157 E2 A7 9D 226 167 158 E2 A7 9E Numeric character reference &#10716; &#x29DC; &#10717; &#x29DD; &#10718; &#x29DE; Named character reference &iinfin; &infintie; &nvinfin; LaTeX[34] \\iinfin \\tieinfty \\nvinfty\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAleph number\n\nHistory of mathematical notation\n\nLazy Eight (disambiguation)"
