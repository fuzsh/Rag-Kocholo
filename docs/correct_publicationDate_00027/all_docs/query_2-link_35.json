        "text": "I wrote this review sometime last year, but so far as I am able to tell it was never published. So I’ve decided to put it here:\n\nWe begin with the title. John Kessel has already written several stories featuring the matriarchal Society of Cousins on the moon, one of which, “Stories for Men”, went on to win the James Tiptree Award. That story took its title from a book that played a significant part within the story. It is perhaps no coincidence, therefore, that this novel-length work in the same setting (though some years later) also takes its title from a book featured within the story.\n\nIn this instance, the book within a book is something that was written after a mysterious youthful episode by one of the novel’s central characters. That book was called Lune et l’autre, and Kessel’s title here is a literal translation. But in the original French, Lune et l’autre is a pun, L’une et l’autre, which we might colloquially render as “one or the other”. In English, the pun is lost, but the spirit of the pun, the issue of choice that it represents, informs the whole book.\n\n(Parenthetically, it is also worth noting that Lune et l’autre was the title given to a French collection of Kessel’s four previous stories of the Society of Cousins, so the repurposing of that title here has yet more layers to it: homage, wordplay, not to mention a nightmare for future bibliographers.)\n\nBut let us consider more carefully what the title tells us about this book. The moon, yes, has been a familiar setting for science fiction since the days of Johannes Kepler and Francis Godwin, but for practically all of that time the moon we have seen has been a single place, a unified polity; if there is a moonbase, a lunar society, then it is all under one central government. But of late, where we see the moon presented declaratively in a title, in Ian McDonald’s Luna, for example, the moon is far from unified. And that is also the case here. Aside from the Society of Cousins, at least half a dozen other independent, self-governing communities on the moon are mentioned. And though there is an over-arching Organization of Lunar States, these polities are far from unified in their background, beliefs or governance. The moon here in the title, as in McDonald’s diptych, signifies a place of division rather than unity.\n\nIf the moon provides the setting, however, it is the second element in the title that provides the plot. Because throughout the novel we are confronted with different understandings of what the other might be. In the quietus of the novel’s coda, the one and the other are seen to come together in a marriage, but that is a rare show of understanding and commonality in a novel in which the one and the other are perpetually at odds with each other. Indeed, one of the issues that confronts the reader is deciding what, in this context, the other might be. The other is, of course, the outsider, the rival, the threat, the one who is not like us, and the novel is crowded with contenders for that role. Indeed, one of the things that the novel insists upon is that everyone is the other to someone.\n\nThus, on one level, the Society of Cousins is the other. The Society started in California as a utopian movement, but has now been established on the moon for many decades. It is a society in which women, specifically a Council of Matrons, rule, while men are denied the vote. Sex is liberally available and men are valued members of society, they just have no say in its governance. But this social structure is anathema to the other lunar states, where men are in the ascendant, and which are dismissed by the Cousins as the patriarchy. So, to the other communities on the moon the Society of Cousins is looked on as the other, a curiosity, a disturbance in the status quo, perhaps a threat. The other states are not exactly uniform; the one we see most of, for instance, Persepolis, is a liberal Islamic democracy modelled on pre-Revolutionary Iran, but that religious strain is not found elsewhere. Nevertheless, these states are united in their dis-ease in the face of institutionalized female rule, and so one of the novel’s plot strands involves the establishment of a commission by the Organization of Lunar States ostensibly to examine the position of men in the Society of Cousins, really to provide an excuse for the OLS to take over the Society, and secretively to act as a cover under which enemies of the Cousins might smuggle in the means to launch an attack.\n\nAll of which might provide the most dramatic moments in the novel, but it is hardly the most important plot element. The Society of Cousins is, inevitably, far less utopian than it might have set out to be. It may be more peaceful than other states, but not by much, and at a cost of resentments and dissension that are now coming to the surface, and incidentally playing into the hands of the OLS. For instance, the distrust that the Cousins feel for everyone outside their literal bubble (the Society of Cousins is established within a dome, unlike some of the other lunar communities which are established underground) leads at one point to them removing every scientific paper published within the Society from all public channels, which in turn fuels the OLS suspicion that the Cousins have developed a secret weapon. There are reform movements that are becoming ever more radical in their rhetoric, causing the Matrons to become more determinedly conservative, while an extremist Spartacist movement is turning towards sabotage. The cross-currents of these political tensions produce a variety of others. The reformers demanding votes for men are largely women, who thus put themselves at odds with their own society. Men are automatically others within this society, but en masse they are divided between those who demand equality and those who are happy with the way things are.\n\nThese political tensions are personified on the individual level by the novel’s three central characters. Carey, the author of Lune et l’autre, is a one-time sports hero and a member of the leading families in the Society of Cousins (despite its self-image, this is still a society of hierarchies). In most respects he is happy with his place in society, except when it comes to his son. Social practice among the Cousins is for girls to leave the family home early to learn independence and authority, while boys are retained within the family and in a sense infantilised by continued mothering. Any child of a liaison is automatically the responsibility of the mother, fatherhood has no legal status. But Carey wants to be a father to his son, wants to take on the rights and responsibilities of that role, and his legal challenge over the issue becomes a catalyst for the reform movement, even though he resists all attempts to recruit him into the campaign.\n\nMira is another at odds with her own society, in her case her rather formless resentments have their origin in her sense of guilt over the death of her younger brother some years before. She makes angry, polemical videos, issued under the nom de guerre of Looker, which are appropriated by the reform movement even though she herself resists any active engagement with the movement. She is an on-again, off-again lover of Carey, but testifies against him in his fatherhood hearing. None of the characters in the novel are one-dimensional mouthpieces for a singly position or perception, but even in these terms Mira is a mass of contradictions. She is other to those closest to her, and other to herself, but this does make her far and away the most interesting character in the book.\n\nThe final member of the triumvirate is Erno. Once a member of a radical movement in the Society of Cousins, he was involved in a terrorist act that unwittingly killed his own mother, and as a consequence he was exiled. Since then he has drifted from state to state, taking on a variety of menial roles, living hand to mouth, and moving on usually just one step ahead of the law. Then, in Persephone, an accident that severs his hand also gives him an opportunity to marry into the richest family on the moon, and to establish his own successful biotechnology business. As an outcast he is perpetually the other, and his experience of the patriarchy from the bottom has made him increasingly sympathetic to the Cousins. When he unexpectedly finds himself on the OLS commission to investigate the Society of Cousins, he is in an awkward position somewhere between his fellow commissioners who have made their minds up even before they arrive at the Society, and the Cousins who still regard him with hostility because of his earlier crimes.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily subtle novel. Characters act wrong-headedly for the best of reasons, or act sensibly for the worst of reasons. Our sympathies are directed towards the Society of Cousins only because its innumerable faults and flaws are clearly displayed. No individual or group acts according to a simple, straightforward motivation. Those whose desires and actions place them most firmly on one side or another, actually want nothing to do with either side. Violence does not work, except that violence may be the only way to end an impasse. It is a novel filled with contradictions, because it is a novel about the other, and everyone is the other.\n\nI don’t know if anyone has done a study of free will and determinism in science fiction, but if they haven’t, they should. I have an impression that most science fiction writers would prefer free will, but most science fiction universes are deterministic. Of course, this is partly because the Newtonian universe is deterministic: set something in motion and so long as you have all the requisite information you will know exactly where it ends. Science may have become less and less deterministic since then – relativity, chaos, etc – but that basic machine-like vision of the universe still tends to hold sway. Time travel stories are almost always deterministic, of course, and it is surprising how often science fiction stories, ouroburos-like, curl back upon themselves even if there is no overt time travel.\n\nThese thoughts are prompted by River of Gods by Ian McDonald (Simon & Schuster, 2004), in which he sets his story in probably the least deterministic culture on Earth, but when you analyse what is going on the story itself is deeply deterministic. This sets up a tension which works really well in terms of the narrative, but I found that paradoxically it drew my attention to the deterministic resolution of the story and that left me feeling uncomfortable, as if the story wasn’t really resolved.\n\nLet me say straight away that River of Gods is undoubtedly McDonald’s longest novel, and very probably his best. I’ve heard it described as McDonald doing Rushdie, though that strikes me as a knee-jerk response to McDonald’s oft-remarked on habit of taking on the colouration of other writers. And it was pretty obvious that, for instance, Sacrifice of Fools was him re-doing Gwyneth Jones’s Aleutian trilogy; though that didn’t stop it being a powerful and original work in its own right. River of Gods is nothing like that, all it really owes to Rushdie is the Indian setting and the fact that it is set around the centenary of Partition (though the publisher makes more of that that McDonald actually does).\n\nIt’s a big, fat book with a big, fat cast of characters. There are ten important, central viewpoint roles, which is perhaps too many. The first part of the book, in which they are introduced one by one, takes over 70 pages, a long time to hold on to our memories of those characters introduced first, and a long time to wait before their individual story threads can start to intertwine. It doesn’t help that he opens with one of the least attractive of the characters, though few of them are really attractive. Interestingly, although by the end of the book only two of them have been killed, all have suffered some major loss, and yet the book does not feel like a tragedy.\n\nWhat McDonald has done very cleverly is use the characters to show the complexity of the world. It is a long time, now, since science fiction writers were able to make one significant change to set their story in motion, and then have everything else, from politics to social habits, appear indistinguishable from 1950s America. But there is still something impressive in the very depth of McDonald’s world creation here. We have global warming affecting the monsoon in India (a country that has already, and inexplicably, fractured into independent statelets); but the resultant drought doesn’t just mean painting scenes of arid landscapes, though the way the different classes in society respond to water is subtle and illuminating, it affects the politics of the country, it brings about war, it changes power structures. And that is only one of the strands of complexity in the novel.\n\nThe strand that is most closely entwined with the over-arching plot is the development of Generation 3 AIs (I was being particularly dumb when I started this novel, I was many pages in before I realised what ‘aeais’ were). This, significantly, is not just a technological issue, as science fiction writers a generation or two back would have made it. Fear of technology is a commonplace, so America has some years before forced through an international ban on anything more than a Generation 2.5 AI. But, in a development of today’s outsourcing of call centres to India, more advanced AIs have been developed by semi-criminal organisations in India, with (of course) the tacit backing of the USA. So this plot strand already incorporates developments in crime and in international relations. The AI development has also allowed the emergence of neuts, a body of the sexually dispossessed who have themselves surgically transformed into something neither male nor female. It has also allowed for the creation of what are called ‘Brahmins’, the genetically manipulated children of the rich and powerful who develop mentally at a very quick rate and physically at a very slow rate, so they can reach the peak of their intellectual powers and still have the body of an apparent ten-year-old. So the technology has also affected the social and sexual make-up of the country. What’s more, and most significantly in terms of the plot, AIs are used in the creation of the world’s most popular soap opera; in fact even the actors playing the roles in the soap opera are computer programs.\n\nThe way all these various aspects of a believably messy world interrelate through the experiences of the ten central characters is one of the joys of this novel. But then he has to go and pull his deterministic trick at the end, through the almost literal deus ex machina of an alien body in near-earth space that has been a structural anomaly in the shape of the novel right from the first time it is mentioned. It is still a good science fiction novel, but I can’t help feeling that if he had been prepared to sacrifice this device (which is, after all, one of the driving forces of the plot) it could have been a great novel.\n\nFirst published at Livejournal, 1 December 2004."
