Heart surgeons believe if they practiced the way they did 5 years ago, they’d be sued for malpractice. Yet, in youth sport coaching we still practice the way we did when we were kids.\n\nJohn Kessel believes we should all be sued for malpractice because we have not evolved the game to meet the times.

In 2013 the American Volleyball Coaches Association inducted him as their 60th member of the AVCA Coaches Hall of Fame.\n\nJohn has been coaching since 1971 at the collegiate level or above, including Women’s U.S. Open titles in 1986 & 1987.
