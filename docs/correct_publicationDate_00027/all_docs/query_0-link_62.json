        "text": "We were hoping that wouldn’t be necessary, but it turned out that it was. We waited for four days for the blockage to clear by itself, but on Monday it became obvious that the tentative positive signs we had seen on Sunday were in fact only tentative. So I went right into surgery at 9:30am Monday.\n\nI do not remember the procedure at all. The last thing I remember was the anesthesiologist telling me he was going to give me something to calm me down. In the recovery room they told me the blockage was caused by a single band of scar tissue, so it was about as uncomplicated as could be. There’s no explanation where that scar tissue came from, though. And my guts were pretty angry from the blockage, so it’ll be at least several days until I can eat.\n\nRight now my pain is pretty well managed at a level 4-5 on a scale of 10. We have to wait for my intestines to start working again before I can go home, but I hope to start walking around today and that should help that happen. I’m still in room 833 at Providence Portland Medical Center on NE Glisan.\n\nThank you all for your kind words and good wishes. Orycon is iffy but we’ll see.\n\nI’ll be heading to San Jose this week for the World Science Fiction Convention. Here’s where you can find me:\n\nHistory of Online Fandom\n\n17 Aug 2018, Friday 13:00 – 14:00, room 230\n\nDavid D. Levine (M), R-Laurraine Tutihasi, Mike Willmoth, Ruhan Zhao\n\nOnline interaction is the simple fact of Fannish activity today. It wasn’t always so. Some fans were early adopters of the Internet and its early alternatives. Some had to be dragged in. How did online fan activity get to be the way it is today?\n\nAutographs\n\n17 Aug 2018, Friday 16:00 – 17:00, Autographing\n\nDavid D. Levine, SB Divya, William Ledbetter, Stephen W. Potts, Mariana Palova, John Kessel, Alasdair Stuart\n\nTor: Wild Cards Signing\n\n18 Aug 2018, Saturday 10:00 – 14:00 PM, Autographing\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin, Kevin Andrew Murphy, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Mary Anne Mohanraj, Marko Kloos, Caroline Spector, Saladin Ahmed\n\nThe long awaited reprint of Wild Cards VIII: One Eyed Jacks is August 28th. But you have an opportunity to get a copy while at Worldcon and to get autographs from many of the authors. This is a special group signing. Copies of the trade paperback will be available from Borderlands Books, in the Dealer’s area. The authors will ONLY be signing Wild Cards books.\n\nWild Cards: An Ongoing Shared Universe\n\n18 Aug 2018, Saturday 12:00 – 13:00 PM, room 210G\n\nKevin Andrew Murphy (M), George R. R. Martin, Marko Kloos, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Mary Anne Mohanraj\n\nWho knew when Wild Cards was released in 1987 that it would grow to over 2 dozen books and still be going strong over 30 years later. The latest installments are Texas Hold ‘Em and Knaves Over Queens. The eighth book, One-Eyed Jacks, is being reprinted and released during the convention. Join the creators and authors for this discussion about how it all started, and where it’s going to be going.\n\nKaffeeklatsch: David D.

Levine, Carrie Patel, Derek McCaw\n\nYour work is out there, and here come the reviews! What should writers know about reviews and how to handle them? Does the high of validation or the anxiety of public criticism ever go away? Let’s hear from a range of perspectives on how to deal with these feels.\n\nReading: David D. Levine\n\n20 Aug 2018, Monday 11:00 – 11:30, room 210G\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nMy third novel, Arabella the Traitor of Mars, the conclusion to the trilogy that began with the Andre Norton Award winning Arabella of Mars, comes out next week! The official release date is July 31. You can buy it from Powell's, University Book Store, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Kobo, Your Local Independent Book Store, or Amazon.\n\nIs there an ebook? An audiobook?\n\nThe ebook and audiobook of Arabella the Traitor of Mars should release simultaneously with the hardback, from all the major ebook vendors, without DRM.\n\nYou can hear an excerpt of the audiobook here. It's narrated by the brilliant Barrie Kreinik, same as the previous two volumes. I haven't seen a preorder page for the audiobook yet, but it should appear soon.\n\nThe previous volume, Arabella and the Battle of Venus, was recently released in trade paperback and is still available in hardback and all other formats. The hardback of Arabella of Mars is sold out in many places but the mass market paperback is still widely available, as are the ebook and audiobook.\n\nAre you planning a book tour?\n\nNot as such. But I will be appearing at the following events in the next few months:\n\nJuly 27-29, 2018: Confluence, Pittsburgh PA\n\nAugust 1, 2018: Powell's Books at Cedar Hills Crossing, Beaverton, OR\n\nAugust 3, 2018: University Book Store, Seattle WA\n\nAugust 16-20, 2018: Worldcon 76, San Jose CA\n\nAugust 23, 2018: Read for Pixels Reddit AMA, /r/Fantasy\n\nSep 4, 2018: Willamette Writers (in conversation with Wendy Wagner), Portland OR\n\nSep 6, 2018: Deep Dish reading series, Chicago IL\n\nSep 16, 2018: SF in SF reading series, San Francisco CA\n\nSep 30, 2018: Read for Pixels Google Hangout\n\nOct 5-7, 2018: Scintillation, Montréal QC\n\nOct 13, 2018: Words & Pictures Festival, Vancouver WA\n\nOct 31, 2018: Charm City Spec, Baltimore MD\n\nNov 1-4, 2018: World Fantasy Convention, Baltimore MD\n\nNov 6, 2018: Young Willamette Writers, Portland, OR\n\nNov 9-11, 2018: OryCon 40, Portland, OR\n\nAnd there might be even more! Check my Upcoming Appearances page for updates.\n\nIf any of these events is local to you, please come if you can. At the Powell's and University Bookstore readings next week I'll be appearing in costume and singing a new Hamilton-based song!\n\nWhat's the book about?\n\nFrom the publisher: Hail the conquering heroes! The tyrant, Napoleon, has been defeated with Arabella and the crew of the Diana leading the final charge. But, victory has come at a tremendous cost. Britain’s savior, Lord Nelson, has not survived the final battle and the good people of the Diana must now return to London as both heroes and pallbearers.\n\nAt last husband and wife, Arabella and Captain Singh seem to have earned the attention of great men, ones who have new uses in mind for the Mars Company captain and his young wife. Both Company and Crown have decided that it is time to bring Mars into the folds of Empire, and they think Singh is the perfect man to do it.\n\nNow, Arabella must decide between staying loyal to the man she loves and the country of her father or betraying all that she has known to fight alongside the Martians in a hopeless resistance against the Galaxy’s last remaining superpower.\n\nWhat can I do to help?\n\nYou should buy the book, of course. Buying it on the release date is helpful but not necessary. If you can't buy it, borrow it from the library. If you can't find it at your local library or bookseller, ask them to carry the book. Also, it's extremely helpful if you post a review on Goodreads, Amazon, your own blog, or anywhere else people might see it. It's okay if you don't like the book! Even a negative review can be helpful if you say why you didn't like it. (Reviewer: \"I hated this book! It has Martians and airships and girls dressing as boys! Yuck!\" Reader: \"Cool, that's just what I love!\") And please mention the book to your friends online and off.\n\nWhere should I buy the book? Is paper better than ebook?\n\nWherever and in whatever format you like to buy books. I get the same money wherever you buy it, and I don't care whether you read it on paper or on screen. There are benefits to me if you buy it on Amazon, but personally I'd prefer it if you would support your local independent book store. Or you could get it from Powell's, which is my local independent book store. You can even order a signed edition from Powell's, which I will sign for you at my reading on August 1.\n\nIs this the last book for Arabella and her universe?\n\nIt is, for now. I've been working in this universe almost exclusively for almost six years now and I think Arabella has done more than enough damage to her timeline—both of us deserve a rest.\n\nSince finishing Arabella the Traitor of Mars I have written an unrelated novella, a Wild Cards story, and a few other small projects, and I'm noodling on a new, completely unrelated novel which may or may not turn into a series. But right now, as you can see from my rather crowded travel schedule above, I'm spending more time on being an Author than being a writer. I hope to change that balance in the next few months.\n\nThank you all for your support! I hope to see you somewhere in the next few months, and if not in person there's always social media."
