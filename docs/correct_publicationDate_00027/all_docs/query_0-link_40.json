        "text": "I’ll be heading to San Jose this week for the World Science Fiction Convention. Here’s where you can find me:\n\nHistory of Online Fandom\n\n17 Aug 2018, Friday 13:00 – 14:00, room 230\n\nDavid D. Levine (M), R-Laurraine Tutihasi, Mike Willmoth, Ruhan Zhao\n\nOnline interaction is the simple fact of Fannish activity today. It wasn’t always so. Some fans were early adopters of the Internet and its early alternatives. Some had to be dragged in. How did online fan activity get to be the way it is today?\n\nAutographs\n\n17 Aug 2018, Friday 16:00 – 17:00, Autographing\n\nDavid D. Levine, SB Divya, William Ledbetter, Stephen W. Potts, Mariana Palova, John Kessel, Alasdair Stuart\n\nTor: Wild Cards Signing\n\n18 Aug 2018, Saturday 10:00 – 14:00 PM, Autographing\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin, Kevin Andrew Murphy, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Mary Anne Mohanraj, Marko Kloos, Caroline Spector, Saladin Ahmed\n\nThe long awaited reprint of Wild Cards VIII: One Eyed Jacks is August 28th. But you have an opportunity to get a copy while at Worldcon and to get autographs from many of the authors. This is a special group signing. Copies of the trade paperback will be available from Borderlands Books, in the Dealer’s area. The authors will ONLY be signing Wild Cards books.\n\nWild Cards: An Ongoing Shared Universe\n\n18 Aug 2018, Saturday 12:00 – 13:00 PM, room 210G\n\nKevin Andrew Murphy (M), George R. R. Martin, Marko Kloos, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Mary Anne Mohanraj\n\nWho knew when Wild Cards was released in 1987 that it would grow to over 2 dozen books and still be going strong over 30 years later. The latest installments are Texas Hold ‘Em and Knaves Over Queens. The eighth book, One-Eyed Jacks, is being reprinted and released during the convention. Join the creators and authors for this discussion about how it all started, and where it’s going to be going.\n\nKaffeeklatsch: David D. Levine\n\n19 Aug 2018, Sunday 10:00 – 11:00, room 211B\n\nSurviving The Review: A Guide\n\n19 Aug 2018, Sunday 15:00 – 16:00, room 210C\n\nCharles Payseur, K.M. Szpara, David D. Levine, Carrie Patel, Derek McCaw\n\nYour work is out there, and here come the reviews! What should writers know about reviews and how to handle them? Does the high of validation or the anxiety of public criticism ever go away? Let’s hear from a range of perspectives on how to deal with these feels.\n\nReading: David D. Levine\n\n20 Aug 2018, Monday 11:00 – 11:30, room 210G\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nMy third novel, Arabella the Traitor of Mars, the conclusion to the trilogy that began with the Andre Norton Award winning Arabella of Mars, comes out next week! The official release date is July 31. You can buy it from Powell's, University Book Store, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Kobo, Your Local Independent Book Store, or Amazon.\n\nIs there an ebook? An audiobook?\n\nThe ebook and audiobook of Arabella the Traitor of Mars should release simultaneously with the hardback, from all the major ebook vendors, without DRM.\n\nYou can hear an excerpt of the audiobook here. It's narrated by the brilliant Barrie Kreinik, same as the previous two volumes. I haven't seen a preorder page for the audiobook yet, but it should appear soon.\n\nThe previous volume, Arabella and the Battle of Venus, was recently released in trade paperback and is still available in hardback and all other formats. The hardback of Arabella of Mars is sold out in many places but the mass market paperback is still widely available, as are the ebook and audiobook.\n\nAre you planning a book tour?\n\nNot as such. But I will be appearing at the following events in the next few months:\n\nJuly 27-29, 2018: Confluence, Pittsburgh PA\n\nAugust 1, 2018: Powell's Books at Cedar Hills Crossing, Beaverton, OR\n\nAugust 3, 2018: University Book Store, Seattle WA\n\nAugust 16-20, 2018: Worldcon 76, San Jose CA\n\nAugust 23, 2018: Read for Pixels Reddit AMA, /r/Fantasy\n\nSep 4, 2018: Willamette Writers (in conversation with Wendy Wagner), Portland OR\n\nSep 6, 2018: Deep Dish reading series, Chicago IL\n\nSep 16, 2018: SF in SF reading series, San Francisco CA\n\nSep 30, 2018: Read for Pixels Google Hangout\n\nOct 5-7, 2018: Scintillation, Montréal QC\n\nOct 13, 2018: Words & Pictures Festival, Vancouver WA\n\nOct 31, 2018: Charm City Spec, Baltimore MD\n\nNov 1-4, 2018: World Fantasy Convention, Baltimore MD\n\nNov 6, 2018: Young Willamette Writers, Portland, OR\n\nNov 9-11, 2018: OryCon 40, Portland, OR\n\nAnd there might be even more! Check my Upcoming Appearances page for updates.\n\nIf any of these events is local to you, please come if you can. At the Powell's and University Bookstore readings next week I'll be appearing in costume and singing a new Hamilton-based song!\n\nWhat's the book about?\n\nFrom the publisher: Hail the conquering heroes! The tyrant, Napoleon, has been defeated with Arabella and the crew of the Diana leading the final charge. But, victory has come at a tremendous cost. Britain’s savior, Lord Nelson, has not survived the final battle and the good people of the Diana must now return to London as both heroes and pallbearers.\n\nAt last husband and wife, Arabella and Captain Singh seem to have earned the attention of great men, ones who have new uses in mind for the Mars Company captain and his young wife. Both Company and Crown have decided that it is time to bring Mars into the folds of Empire, and they think Singh is the perfect man to do it.\n\nNow, Arabella must decide between staying loyal to the man she loves and the country of her father or betraying all that she has known to fight alongside the Martians in a hopeless resistance against the Galaxy’s last remaining superpower.\n\nWhat can I do to help?\n\nYou should buy the book, of course. Buying it on the release date is helpful but not necessary. If you can't buy it, borrow it from the library. If you can't find it at your local library or bookseller, ask them to carry the book. Also, it's extremely helpful if you post a review on Goodreads, Amazon, your own blog, or anywhere else people might see it. It's okay if you don't like the book! Even a negative review can be helpful if you say why you didn't like it. (Reviewer: \"I hated this book! It has Martians and airships and girls dressing as boys! Yuck!\" Reader: \"Cool, that's just what I love!\") And please mention the book to your friends online and off.\n\nWhere should I buy the book? Is paper better than ebook?\n\nWherever and in whatever format you like to buy books. I get the same money wherever you buy it, and I don't care whether you read it on paper or on screen. There are benefits to me if you buy it on Amazon, but personally I'd prefer it if you would support your local independent book store. Or you could get it from Powell's, which is my local independent book store. You can even order a signed edition from Powell's, which I will sign for you at my reading on August 1.\n\nIs this the last book for Arabella and her universe?\n\nIt is, for now. I've been working in this universe almost exclusively for almost six years now and I think Arabella has done more than enough damage to her timeline—both of us deserve a rest.\n\nSince finishing Arabella the Traitor of Mars I have written an unrelated novella, a Wild Cards story, and a few other small projects, and I'm noodling on a new, completely unrelated novel which may or may not turn into a series. But right now, as you can see from my rather crowded travel schedule above, I'm spending more time on being an Author than being a writer. I hope to change that balance in the next few months.\n\nThank you all for your support! I hope to see you somewhere in the next few months, and if not in person there's always social media.\n\nMy second novel, Arabella and the Battle of Venus, sequel to the Andre Norton Award winning Arabella of Mars, comes out this week! The official release date is July 18, but I have seen copies in two bookstores already. You can buy it from Powell’s, University Book Store, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Kobo, Your Local Independent Book Store, or Amazon.\n\nIs there an ebook? An audiobook?\n\nThe ebook of Arabella and the Battle of Venus should release simultaneously with the hardback, from all the major ebook vendors, without DRM. I haven’t seen any sign of the audiobook yet, but for the previous book it followed the hardback release by a few weeks.\n\nAre you planning a book tour?\n\nYes! Here are the planned stops:\n\nJuly 18, 2017: Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing, Portland, Oregon.\n\nJuly 20, 2017: University Book Store, Seattle, Washington.\n\nJuly 22, 2017: Borderlands Books, San Francisco, California.\n\nIf any of these events is local to you, please come if you can. There will be music, costumes, and giveaways! Come in costume! Tell your friends!\n\nWhat’s the book about?\n\nFrom the publisher: The thrilling adventures of Arabella Ashby continue in Arabella and the Battle of Venus, the second book in Hugo-winning author David D. Levine’s swashbuckling sci-fi, alternate history series!\n\nArabella’s wedding plans to marry Captain Singh of the Honorable Mars Trading Company are interrupted when her fiancé is captured by the French and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on swampy Venus. Now, Arabella must find passage to an enemy-controlled planet in the middle of a war, bribe or fight her way past vicious guards, and rescue her Captain.\n\nTo do this she must enlist the help of the dashing privateer, Daniel Fox of the Touchstone and build her own clockwork navigational automaton in order to get to Venus before the dread French general, Joseph Fouché, the Executioner of Lyon.\n\nOnce on Venus, Arabella, Singh, and Fox soon discover that Napoleon has designed a secret weapon, one that could subjugate the entire solar system if they can’t discover a way to stop Fouché, and the entire French army, from completing their emperor’s mandate.\n\nWhat can I do to help?\n\nYou should buy the book, of course. Buying it on the release date is helpful but not necessary. If you can’t buy it, borrow it from the library. If you can’t find it at your local library or bookseller, ask them to carry the book. Also, it’s extremely helpful if you post a review on Goodreads, Amazon, your own blog, or anywhere else people might see it. It’s okay if you don’t like the book! Even a negative review can be helpful if you say why you didn’t like it. (Reviewer: “I hated this book! It has Martians and airships and girls dressing as boys! Yuck!” Reader: “Cool, that’s just what I love!”) And please mention the book to your friends online and off.\n\nWhere should I buy the book? Is paper better than ebook?\n\nWherever and in whatever format you like to buy books. I get the same money wherever you buy it, and I don’t care whether you read it on paper or on screen. There are benefits to me if you buy it on Amazon, but personally I’d prefer it if you would support your local independent book store. Or you could get it from Powell’s, which is my local independent book store. You can even order a signed edition from Powell’s, which I will sign for you at my reading on July 18.\n\nHow is Arabella of Mars doing?\n\nVery well, thank you! It won the Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy and was nominated for the Oregon Book Award, Locus Award, and Compton Crook Award. Sales have been quite satisfactory, and the mass market paperback was released on May 30.\n\nWill there be a book 3?\n\nYes! I just submitted the first draft last week, and it should be out about the same time next year. This third book, which is currently titled Arabella and the Winds of Phobos but might be called Arabella the Traitor of Mars, concludes Arabella’s story, but there are more tales which could be told about other people in other times and places of Arabella’s world.\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nAs you know, the last year has been an extremely difficult one for me. But I am doing better, and Arabella’s success has been a great comfort. I thank all of you for your support of me and of the book.\n\nIt was forty years ago today — June 17, 1977 — that I attended my first science fiction convention, X-Con ’77 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was Milwaukee’s first science fiction convention, put on by the Milwaukee Area Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Fans (MA2OSF3), and I found out about it only because my father, who was in charge of the computer lab at the university, saw someone running off flyers for the convention on one of the printers there and brought one home for me. I was a sophomore in high school.\n\nAt the convention I got autographs from guests of honor Gordon R. Dickson and Robert Lynn Aspirin (he was the Fan GoH, not yet a pro writer, and famous mostly for founding the Dorsal Irregulars; my badge bears the note “not a Dorsal Irregular” because I was wearing a black turtleneck) and spent most of the time playing the new-to-me game of D&D. A couple of weeks later, I got a letter from the organizers inviting me to attend a MA2OSF3 meeting. I attended, I had a good time, and I started hanging out with them. I went to a couple more conventions that year, in Chicago and Champaign-Urbana, and several more the next, including Wiscon 2. When X-Con ’78 rolled around the following June I was on the committee, as co-head of Gaming.\n\nSince then I’ve attended four or five cons a year. I have saved every convention badge, though I haven’t counted them lately — it probably totals something in the vicinity of 150 cons. I have been active in science fiction clubs: MA2OSF3 in Milwaukee, StLSFS in St. Louis, and PorSFiS in Portland. I have been a conrunner, fanzine editor, costumer, artist, gamer, and even dealer. I’m still involved in con running, maintaining the website and mailing lists for Oregon Science Fiction Conventions Inc., but most of my fan-related time now comes from attending conventions as a pro.\n\nThanks to Fandom I have traveled the world, made hundreds of fabulous friends and lovers, and met my spouse. I’ve laughed, I’ve cried, I’ve eaten far too many meals in hotel coffee shops. Fandom has been the spine upon which much of my life has been hung, and it is a marvel to me that I now find myself somewhere near the top of a field of which I have been a reader and fan for my entire life.\n\nMany of the people reading this have been part of this journey, and continue to be part of it. I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for being there for me, and I hope I’ve been there for you as well.\n\nNext stop, Helsinki!"
