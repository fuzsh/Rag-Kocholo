        "text": "HALL OF RECORDS COMMISSION MEETING\n\nThe Hall of Records Commission met on April 19 at the Archives. Judge Robert M. Bell, Chairman, called the meeting to order. Ed Papenfuse introduced the staff and special guests, consisting of members of the Archives of Maryland Advisory Board: George Callcott, Agnes Callum, Lois Carr, Suzanne Chapelle, Rhoda Dorsey, Charles Flanagan, and Whit Ridgway. Robert Barnes, Elizabeth Kessel, and Juan Williams were unable to attend.\n\nEd paid tribute to two colleagues, Gust Skordas and Phebe Jacobsen, by acknowledging their many contributions to the Archives. Gust had been assistant state archivist and after his retirement lived in California where he died on April 14. Phebe had been director of the church records program and reference services and continued to live in Annapolis until her death the morning of the 19th.\n\nEd outlined the special meetings of the Commission and celebratory events, including the George Washington's Birthday Ceremony held in the Old Senate Chamber on February 21. Presented then was a special edition of George Washington's Farewell Address recently located in the 1796 Laws of Maryland in the State Law Library. By resolution at that session, the General Assembly authorized the printing of the address. The Archives borrowed the book for the production of images for the Archives of Maryland On Line as Volume 105 and for Governor Glendening's Washington's Birthday Address. A web based, indexed version of the Farewell Address will be found at http://archivesofmaryland.net.\n\nEd reported on significant Archives and staff activities. With funds from the supplemental budget, the State House Trust will begin work on the Historic Structure Report and exhibits for the State House. Now available is an audio/video presentation of President Clinton's visit for the\n\nsigning of the gun control bill. This occasion represented the first time a sitting President was present for a bill signing in Maryland. At the last session the General Assembly renewed the Land Records Improvement Fund which provides funding for the Archives' plats recordation and imaging system for each of the circuit courts in the state. In his testimony before the committee considering the bill, Ed emphasized the importance of including in the project survey materials from county as well as state records. Another bill authorizes property line surveyors to survey land for patents.\n\nFor Black History Month Frontiers International produced two Archives of Maryland Documents for the Classroom CD's for use in the Anne Arundel County public schools. The Archives is developing an imaging proposal for the State Highway Administration field notebooks. The Archives furnished documents, information, and assistance for the Maryland Public Television production of Anne Arundel's Legacy.\n\nSpecial mention was made about several recent acquisitions for Special Collections. William Turpin donated two rare books on architecture and carpentry. One, A Complete Body of Architecture Adorned with Plans and Elevations from Original Designs, by Isaac Ware, 1767, was purchased by James Brice and used in construction of the Brice House in Annapolis. Another donor gave the Archives a signed receipt from John Shaw who borrowed the book when he was in charge of the State House. The second book, The British Carpenter by Francis Price, 1735, was presumably consulted during the building of Fort McHenry.\n\nAtwood S. Barwick donated his transcriptions of early Somerset County judicial records, 1670-1690. These transcripts and images of the original, handwritten pages are being incorporated in the Archives of Maryland On Line project as Volumes 86-91 and 106. Mary Elizabeth Kirby presented to\n\ncompilations, and proceedings of constitutional conventions. The 2001 budget continues the project with general fund support.\n\nA related endeavor will bring on line records pertaining to slavery and freedom prior to the Civil War in Prince George's County. In 1971 Louise Joyner Hienton indexed on cards the slave statistics and certificates of freedom of that county. The Archives will scan this index and link the entries to the records themselves. This activity will fit nicely with the goals of a bill creating a Commission to Coordinate the Study, Commemoration, and Impact of Slavery's History and Legacy in Maryland.\n\nThe meeting ended on a celebratory note in honor of Ed's silver anniversary as State Archivist. First, Senator Thomas V. Mike Miller presented Ed with a resolution from the Senate. Judge Bell handled the other three presentations -- a proclamation from the Governor, letter from Judge Bell, and resolution of the House of Delegates. Ed concluded the meeting by thanking the Commission for making possible his 25 years of service and by giving everyone present a Maryland quarter.\n\nHALL OF RECORDS COMMISSION MEETING\n\n(continued from page 2)\n\nthe Archives hitherto unknown copies of the Maryland Constitution of 1776 and the Articles of Confederation, both printed by Green and signed and annotated by Samuel Chase. Ms. Kirby's mother had rescued the material from the trash in the 1940s.\n\nEd discussed the Society of Senates Past Biographical Research Project that is part of the Archives of Maryland: Biographical Series. The objective is one of documenting the lives of people who make government work, both in the past and present. Interns this summer will continue to compile biographical information about state senators.\n\nA special presentation featured the Archives of Maryland On Line series that makes available on the Internet value added, accessible, and searchable archival records pertinent to legal history in the state. The project concentrated first on the 72 published volumes of the Archives of Maryland, with financial assistance through a grant from the Information Technology Fund. Now on line are an additional 38 volumes, including Kilty's Landholders Assistant, early codes and"
