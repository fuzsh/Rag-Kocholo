        "text": "This week’s episode of The Acolyte arguably held the fate of the series in its hands. Its main task was to reveal the show’s central mystery and in doing so, answer two questions: was it worth the build up, and was it bad enough to encourage the Jedi to cover it up?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer is not a yes. While there is definitely some stuff in there that doesn’t paint the Jedi in a great light, and showing the events of Brendok from the Jedi’s perspective was very interesting, I’m not sure the events of the episode were enough to justify the decision to keep this mystery under wraps this late into the season.\n\nIn fact, I would argue that this episode should have been combined with the first flashback episode to just get everything out there early on. Both flashback episodes do a good job explaining why Mae wants vengeance against the Jedi and why Sol feels guilty about Brendok. But after six weeks of build up, what we get is not really as scandalous as The Acolyte showrunners hoped it would be.\n\nIgnoring the payoff itself though, the rest of the episode was good. One long-awaited action scene has to go down as one of the most memorable in Star Wars for Wookiee fans — though not quite as impressive as episode 5 — and we learned some important things about the Jedi’s role at Brendok. Those who have been uncomfortable with the Jedi’s portrayal so far in The Acolyte can rest a little easier knowing that Sol and Indara’s intentions are not nearly as sinister as this show suggested they might be. The Jedi are certainly flawed, but they did not come to Brendok with an ominous purpose.\n\n“Choice” offers plenty to enjoy in longest episode yet of The Acolyte, but sadly the big reveal doesn’t quite live up to the hype.\n\nSpoilers ahead…\n\nIn trying to decipher whether or not the series’ big reveal was worth it, it’s worth going back through the things we learned about the Jedi in this episode. From the jump, we learn that they did not actually come to Brendok to monitor the Force cult. Instead, they were investigating a possible Force vergence (a location with a high concentration of Force energy, where Jedi tend to build their temples) when Sol stumbles upon Mae and Osha. It turns out in that scene where they sit under the tree, Sol had only just discovered them.\n\nHe follows them and infiltrates the cult base. From his point of view, it does look like the witches are treating the children cruelly for a second. Worst case scenario, they’re teaching them dark side magick and he immediately decides they need rescuing.\n\nSurprisingly, Master Indara wants to leave them all be, pointing out that the Council would never let the twins become Jedi due to their age. But Sol is clearly a slave to his emotions and couldn’t live with himself if he didn’t rescue the children, going so far as to say that he felt a connection with Osha after a single meeting! It’s very “Qui-Gon” to decide to take on a padawan no matter their age against the council’s wishes, but at least Qui-Gon had better control over his emotions than Sol does.\n\nWe get to see Torbin’s perspective on his mind getting invaded by Mother Aniseya. It’s clear that Torbin is not ready for a mission like this — and in fairness, they all thought this planet was uninhabited when they arrived — he’s impatient and eager to return to the clean and shiny temple on Coruscant from the get go. Mother Aniseya seizes on that discomfort and quickly lets it fester into fear. To be honest, it didn’t seem that intimidating beyond the initial fact that the Jedi padawan’s mind was invaded — if anything, Mother Aniseya appeared seductive rather than menacing — but Torbin is deeply disturbed by the ordeal.\n\nIndara reluctantly approves Sol’s request to test the twins and comes off much warmer when Mae is tested. We now know the reason she seemed so cold in Osha’s test is because she chafed at Sol’s attempts to form a bond with the girl. She comes off a much warmer person in this episode, like a kind traditional Jedi.\n\nTorbin analyzes the girls’ midichlorian counts and discovers they are exactly the same. This goes some way to explaining why Sol didn’t realize Mae was impersonating his old padawan in the previous episode. If they are exactly the same in the Force, then he wouldn’t be able to tell the two of them apart by his senses alone.\n\nTorbin lets his fear get the better of him. He is the catalyst for this whole mess, believing that the girls are key to getting off Brendok and away from the witch who invaded his mind. Sol hurries after him, intent on seizing this opportunity to run in and grab the girls.\n\nWe learn that Mae did in fact start the fire, though seemingly by accident. She stupidly seemed surprised that the book she set on fire actually started to burn and threw it at the door controls in a panic. Honestly that stupidity might be the most annoying part of the episode for me.\n\nWe also see that Mae’s Zabrak mother encouraged Mae’s anger and is also responsible for escalating the situation, rallying the witches to battle. In the end, the one who wanted peace — Mother Aniseya — is killed when Sol reacts to her entering her shadowy form by igniting his lightsaber and stabbing her mid-transformation. This is one of the big reveals of the episode, that Sol killed her without knowing her true intentions. He acted out of fear and ignorance, ruining any chance of a peaceful resolution.\n\nThen, in one of the more puzzling developments, Torbin states that he has fortified his mind against future invasions, but the witch reveals that they possessed Kelnacca’s mind instead. Either Torbin is lying or is wrong to believe that his mind is fortified, or Kelnacca was careless not to fortify his own mind. Despite this, it leads to some great Jedi-on-Jedi action and probably the best Wookiee fight scene in all of Star Wars, which should not be forgotten.\n\nWhile not as stylish as the episode 5 duel — Kelnacca is slower than The Stranger — it does an excellent job at demonstrating why a Wookiee’s strength is to be feared, as Torbin and Sol struggle to stay alive while Kelnacca throws them around like ragdolls. The conflict is ended when Indara jumps in and uses the Force to expel the witches from the Wookiee’s mind, which kills them.\n\nSo, the Jedi did not slaughter anyone. Perhaps Indara pushed too hard, but it seems the act of freeing one of their own from possession is what killed them all. We then see Mae and Osha’s confrontation from Sol’s perspective, learning that he was using the Force to keep both platforms from falling the whole time. The episode very clearly shows that Sol is struggling to keep both of them alive, and is forced to choose. He picks Osha and lets Mae fall to her supposed death, which is obviously the big secret that has been weighing on his mind all season.\n\nI can understand why Sol would harbor deep feelings of guilt over his decision. I can also understand Torbin was traumatized by the whole ordeal, as the mind invasion must give him PTSD and he must know he is responsible for escalating this whole event that ended up with dead witches. I can imagine Kelnacca might have also grappled with his guilt about letting his mind be possessed and nearly killing his fellow Jedi. But it doesn’t feel like a scandal worthy enough of keeping this from the viewers until the seventh episode in this eight-episode season of The Acolyte.\n\nIndara is the one who suggests covering it up and only telling the council a partial truth of what happened. But why? It doesn’t seem like a huge scandal. Ultimately, the witches only died because the Jedi acted in self-defence and there was no big reveal that Sol did anything truly terrible (Sol might argue he was provoked into killing Mother Aniseya, though that lets him off the hook too easily).\n\nThis episode of The Acolyte offers plenty to sink our teeth into and explains quite a few things regarding character motivations, but unfortunately the secrecy around the big reveal didn’t live up to the hype. It might help if someone acknowledges this is in the final episode, but at the moment it feels like the showrunner’s intentions have fallen flat.\n\nThe Acolyte has a lot to wrap up in its final episode, and those dissatisfied with the big reveal may feel it’s impossible for the show to stick the landing now. There’s a lot to do, but I hope the series can do it."
