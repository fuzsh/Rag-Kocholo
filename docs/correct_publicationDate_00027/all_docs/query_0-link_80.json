That moment of understanding drives the greatest science fiction stories and lies at the heart of Engineering Infinity. Whether it’s coming up hard against the speed of light and, with it, the enormity of the universe, realising that terraforming a distant world is harder and more dangerous than you’d ever thought, or simply realizing that a hitchhiker on a starship consumes fuel and oxygen with tragic results, it’s hard science fiction where sense of wonder is most often found and where science fiction’s true heart lies. The exciting and innovative science fiction anthology collects together stories by some of the biggest names in the field including Stephen Baxter, Charles Stross, Kristine Kathryn Rusch and Gwyneth Jones.\n\nThe Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Volume 1\n\nFor the first time ever, award winning editor Jonathan Strahan has assembled the best science fiction and the best fantasy stories of the year in one volume. More than just two books for the price of one, this book brings together over 200,000 words of the best genre fiction anywhere. Strahan’s critical eye and keen editorial instincts have served him well for earlier best of the year round ups in the Best Short Novels, Science Fiction: Best of and Fantasy: Best of series, and this is his most impressive effort yet.\n\nThe Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Volume 2\n\nThe depth and breadth of what science fiction and fantasy fiction is changes with every passing year. The two dozen stories chosen for this book by award winning anthologist Jonathan Strahan carefully maps this evolution, giving readers a captivating and always entertaining look at the very best the genre has to offer.\n\nThe Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Volume 3\n\nThe depth and breadth of what science fiction and fantasy fiction is changes with every passing year. The two dozen stories chosen for this book by award winning anthologist Jonathan Strahan carefully maps this evolution, giving readers a captivating and always entertaining look at the very best the genre has to offer. Jonathan Strahan has edited more than twenty anthologies and collections, including The Locus Awards, The New Space Opera, The Jack Vance Treasury, and a number of year’s best annuals. He has won the Ditmar, William J. Atheling Jr., and Peter McNamara Awards for his work as an anthologist, and is the reviews editor for Locus.\n\nThe Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Volume 4\n\nThe depth and breadth of what science fiction and fantasy fiction is changes with every passing year. The two dozen stories chosen for this book by award winning anthologist Jonathan Strahan carefully maps this evolution, giving readers a captivating and always entertaining look at the very best the genre has to offer.\n\nThe Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Volume 5\n\nThe depth and breadth of science fiction and fantasy fiction continues to change with every passing year. The twenty nine stories chosen for this book by award winning anthologist Jonathan Strahan carefully map this evolution, giving readers a captivating and always entertaining look at the very best the genre has to offer.\n\nEclipse 1\n\nAn eclipse is a rare and unusual event, when the world is transformed and the sky becomes a dark eldritch thing. It’s a time when anything could happen, when any kind of story just might be true. That sense of the strange and wonderful guides Eclipse: New Science Fiction and Fantasy, the first volume in an exciting new annual anthology series edited by acclaimed anthologist Jonathan Strahan.\n\nSet to become a major event on the science fiction and fantasy calendar,Eclipse: New Science Fiction and Fantasy gathers together new science fiction and fantasy stories by the best writers working today. You can see that in Eclipse 1, which features extraordinary tales by Peter S. Beagle, Jack Dann & Paul Brandon, Terry Dowling, Andy Duncan, Jeffrey Ford, Kathleen Ann Goonan, Eileen Gunn, Gwyneth Jones, Ellen Klages, Maureen F. McHugh, Garth Nix, Lucius Shepard, Bruce Sterling and Ysabeau S. Wilce.\n\nEclipse 3\n\nTo observe an eclipse is to witness a rare and unusual event. Under darkened skies the sun becomes a negative image of itself, its corona transforming the landscape into a strange space where anything might happen, and any story may be true…\n\nIn the spirit of classic science fiction anthologies such as Universe, Orbit, and Starlight, master anthologist Jonathan Strahan The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year presents the non themed genre anthology Eclipse: New Science Fiction and Fantasy. Here you will find stories where strange and wonderful things happen where reality is eclipsed by something magical and new.\n\nWings of Fire\n\nDragons: Fearsome fire breathing foes, scaled adversaries, legendary lizards, ancient ho*arders of priceless treasures, serpentine sages with the ages’ wisdom, and winged weapons of war…\n\nWings of Fire brings you all these dragons, and more, seen clearly through the eyes of many of today’s most popular authors, including Peter Beagle, Holly Black, Orson Scott Card, Charles De Lint, Diana Wynne Jones, Mercedes Lackey, Ursula K Le Guin, Dean R Koontz, George R. R. Martin, Anne McCaffrey, Elizabeth Moon, Garth Nix, and many others.\n\nModern Greats of Science Fiction\n\nFrom a distant future where both beer and rebellion brew in a tavern on Mars to an alternate WWII–where the cutting-edge science is quantum biology–and from a haunting story of a bizarre prison without guards or rules to a Bradbury-esque tale of small-town America, Modern Greats is a landmark collection of some of the finest short work in science fiction.\n\nThe Locus Awards\n\nNow, for the first time, the best of The Locus Awards for short fiction are gathered in one volume.
