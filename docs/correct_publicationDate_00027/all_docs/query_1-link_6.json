        "text": "April 23, 2024\n\nEinen Bewertungsschnitt von unter 3.0 findet man bei goodreads selten. Die Leser sind ja meist grosszügig. Bei \"Treffpunkt Unendlichkeit\" ist dies leider nicht unverdient. Es ist ein seltsames, unbefriedigendes Konglomerat von Ideen. Viele Ideen zu haben ist ja für einen kreativen Autoren (wie man hört) nicht das Problem. Die richtigen Ideen zu einem runden Ganzen zusammenzufügen ist die Kunst. Das ist Herr Brunner in diesem Buch sicherlich nicht gelungen.\n\nZum Plot:\n\nDer Mathematiker Tackit fand raus, dass man mit Raumkrümmungsmathematik den Wert von Pi verändern kann und schwupp, gibt es plötzlich 100000 alternative Planeten im Sonnensystem, die man mit Portalen besuchen kann (äh... wie bitte??). Es entwickelt sich ein reger Handel, dann verbreitet sich von einer dieser Welten \"der Weisse Tod\", eine Seuche, der 100 Mio Menschen zum Opfer fallen. Der Handel wird daraufhin streng reglementiert. \"Vertrauenswürdige\" Personen oder Syndikate können eine exklusive Handelslizenz für eine einzelne Welt erwerben, ein Garant für Reichtum ... und Korruption.\n\nNicht das erste Mal habe ich das Gefühl, dass Brunner einen guten Teil seiner Bücher mal so eben schnell \"hingerotzt\" hat. Es gibt einen Haufen von Personen, von denen nicht klar ist, welche davon die Hauptpersonen sein sollen. Die Handlung ist unfokussiert und geht in x verschiedene Richtungen.\n\nIch war anfangs wirklich entschlossen, das Ding mal zu Ende zu lesen, habe es aber dann nicht geschafft.\n\nJuly 26, 2014\n\nThe story's crystallizing moment tries to be a phildickian game changer, making the reader question everything before, but instead is its greatest failure.\n\nThe book starts with some truly silly blank verse and then launches into a rocketing jumble of plot and social conflict wrapped around a central theme: traffic and mercantilism among parallel Earths, and the resulting robber-baron plutocracy. It's a technothriller that throws the reader into the deep end (Who is Tacket? What is a 'franchise'? What is going on?) and almost requires the back cover text or a pithy summary in order to get up to speed.\n\nIt is revealed eventually that many characters have had their perceptions or behavior 'adjusted' by an outside force as part of an invasion, and that this entire conflict has been engineered.\n\nBut then Brunner fails to close the loop. A character suggests that the above information--extracted from an operative--is actually a planted lie, designed to distract the protagonists.\n\nI was about to start applauding Brunner for casting double-doubt on everything, but... nope. That idea gets dropped, resolved in about a page. Shame.\n\nFor the rest of it, it's so busy with stuff going on and ancillary characters and a supplementary \"rho function field\" concept that it failed to make a strong impression.\n\nJanuary 29, 2018\n\nI've been reading a lot of old science fiction lately...and this book? It was a strange one...\n\nParallel worlds? Cool! A crazy future government? Cool! Throwing me into a story with random characters loosely connected and then weaving a crap ton of intrigue into the plot line? Uhhhh sure? I guess?\n\nThis book was really scattered and not what I expected. I guess I thought there was gonna be more use of the parallel worlds rather than discussion on it? The beginning of the book speaks of clock hands and doom and how the players are unaware of their doom...that the end of everything had come. I don't feel like the ending lived up to that promise. I kept waiting for the end of the market and they systems..heck the whole planet.\n\nI dunno. I liked this, it was certainly interesting and kept me guessing. I just felt it was odd and scattered.\n\nMay 15, 2022\n\nThis isn't one of his best novels for sure, but it's alright. Brunner seems to have a thing for portal/dimensional travel type stories. This one is about an Earth that uses portals to trade with other worlds. A disease that came from another world has decimated the population and the big powers are the franchises that run these portals. The main action has little to do with using these portals. It is a mystery type story where the main characters are trying to hunt down a man with connections to the big franchise owner to figure out what he knows. All the while trying to defend Earth against an invasion from another dimension. Overall it is not his best. \"Webs of Everywhere\" and \"Infinite of Go\" were much better and based on a similar premise.\n\nJanuary 2, 2023\n\nFrankly, the first six chapters are a lot of work in which the reader really is not given much to work with. Characters are mentioned and they seem to be acting with purpose, but its all very closed to the reader at this point. Threads of a plot are everywhere, but they are not very accessible. In other words, it feels a bit frustrating because not only is the setting an unfamiliar future world, but the characters roles and relationships are difficult to consider.\n\nThis is one of those novels where as a reader, you have to continue on because you have faith and trust in the author.\n\nThe novel is, more or less, an action novel. However, the overarching structure is a sort of economic/sociological future that we are not really told enough about. I would say that this novel feels a lot like Foundation + A Clockwork Orange.\n\nIf the reader gets through the whole novel, a lot of the threads come together and make sense. There are resolutions and answers, to a point. However, the answers and connections seem irrelevant or paper-thin. As if a lot of work was put in to make an action novel that has all the correct elements, but none of the depth. It is a skeleton in some senses and one that takes a lot of work on the reader’s part.\n\nThis was a strange novel to read – difficult as heck to start, stubborn in the middle, and somewhat rewarding at the end. I feel like though I did not love it, there is something about it that lingers in my imagination after I finished it.\n\nMarch 3, 2020\n\nFull review: https://sciencefictionruminations.com...\n\n\"Readers from the first days of my blog might recall my rather dismissive comment in my review of John Brunner’s abysmal Born under Mars (1967),\n\n“I have still yet to find in Brunner’s early pulp(ish) novels any solid indication of his future brilliance that manifests itself so poignantly in his great novels of the late 60s and 70s (Stand on Zanzibar, Shockwave Rider, The Sheep Look Up, and to a lesser\n\nNovember 28, 2013\n\nreview of\n\nJohn Brunner's Meeting at Infinity\n\nby tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE - November 27, 2013\n\nThis is the 25th bk I've read by Brunner (if I count Ace Doubles as 2 bks) & reading his work still brings me a great deal of pleasure & stimulation. As is often the case w/ SF, the notes I took for this review were minimal since what I mostly wd've written about wd've been plot elements that I often avoid referring to to avoid spoilers.\n\nIt's interesting for me to note slight differences between Brunner bks that show his trying out writerly touches. EG: Meeting at Infinity begins w/ a prologue that I found 'poetic'. Here's the very beginning:\n\n\"On the stroke of twelve o'clock noon-for-doom of this day and no other: begins destiny. Begins death. Tick away time—heartbeat, clocktick, belltoll.\n\n\"THIS WAY OUT.\" - p 1\n\nCentral to the plot, is a thing called the \"Tacket Principle\" wch allows the exploration of parallel Earths. I found Brunner's explanation of the discovery ingenious:\n\n\"The great discovery—that of his celebrated Principle, which changed the world—was the fruit of an examination of pi. It fired his mind; his mind was explosive; the explosion came near to destroying everything.\n\n\"Pi, it seemed, was invariant. However, certain deductions from curved-space mathematics indicated conditions under which it would assume values different from the familiar 3.1416. It would remain an irrational number of course. But the physical conditions for altering its value could be described. Tacket's preoccupation with analogues of number did the rest.\" - p 24\n\n& Brunner, being a writer, rather than just an extrapolator of scientific possibilities, creates slang for the future environment he's describing:\n\n\"\"There was one in the crowd. Brown coverup, average height, automat barberclip, brown hair plain, all like anyone. But he didn't look like a dreg, didn't smell like a dreg, and when shouted out to Lyken he didn't sound like a dreg. In my tapes, that's curio.\" - p 35\n\nIt's fun for me, as the reviewer, to be able to quote a summation of sorts from near the end of a bk w/o having it actually spoil the plot. For the reader of this review, the following quote is too out-of-context to be overly revealing but may be intriguing as it stands:\n\n\"Allyn glanced at him. \"You have to regard it this way,\" she said. \"Physical and mental are conjoined and interdependent; you cannot have a mind discarnate, but it has to grow within a growing brain. Contrariwise, it appears to me, physical reality is a kind of sum total or common denominator of that which is perceived by consciousness. It is possible to act mentally on this physical reality so as to change not it itself, but the mode in which it is perceived. Do you follow me?\" - p 150\n\nPart of what interests me about the above is the idea of acting mentally on the mode in wch physical reality is perceived in order to, effectively, change what constitutes physical reality for ourselves. Beauty is in the mind of the beholder.\n\nMy Twitter name is \"Psychic Weed\" wch is NOT meant to imply that I consider myself a \"psychic\" (even tho I might be to a teeny extent) or to express an advocacy for pot (by all means make it legal - otherwise, I find pot of little value). Instead, it's a reference to my notion that freedom lies largely in the defiance of geometrical containers (both physical & conceptual) by biomorphic phenomena. Consider this:\n\n\"Also true, they made no allowance for the difference between their society—an oligarchy ruling a 'black-boxed' majority—and ours, so they never reckoned on Mr. Hole's yonder boys, or with Director Lanchery's animals and wild men.\"\" - p 151"
