This edition has been introduced to include inspiration with a view to refine the existing content. It is hoped that this book will be found useful by the students. We have tried to present this book in the simplest and easiest vocabulary that caters to the needs of all categories of students. Therefore, the entire book is compartmentalized into two semesters and each semester includes five units on the basis of latest syllabus. We have given quotations, pictorial representations to support and explain our views. This book would expose the readers not only to the basic concept of Physical Education but also impart further knowledge about related concepts. In spite of great care some errors might have crept in, so we request all who have been engaged in different segments of the field to provide us valuable feedback and constructive criticism, so as to make further improvement in this effort by the authors. Last but not the least, we want to express our sincere thanks to our teachers for extending their moral support and encouragement.

The system of receiving and giving education is prevalent world over in one form or the other. It is a systematic process of acquiring knowledge, experience, skills and values to bring positive outlook towards life and society. From his very origin, human being has been learning one or the other things, education not only effects his ordinary life but also his social life. Education brings change in his behaviour, manners and etiquettes in day to day living. It makes an individual civilized, refined and cultured. Mahatma Gandhi had defined education as âall round development of body, soul and mind.â The word education has its roots in the combination of two Latin words : Educareâwhich means \\\"to bring out\\\" and Educereâmeaning \\\"to lead out\\\" or \\\"to draw out\\\" The word education would then mean; \\\"a medium and to train out\\\". Thus, education is considered to improve the inbuilt powers of a person and increase internal powers and capacities. If we split the spellings their meaning would then be- E- means â \\\"from inside\\\", and duco- mean â\\\"to take out\\\". Thus, Education is considered to improve the inbuilt powers of a person. Some Important definitions of Education According to Aristotle, âEducation is to develop healthy mind in a healthy body.â According to Plato, âEducation is a process to develop physical, mental and intellectual capabilities of an individual.â According to Douglas and Holland, âthe word education used to project all the changes which occur during the life time of an individual.â According to T.P.Nunn, âEducation is the complete development of the individuality of a child, so that he can make an original contribution to human life according to his best capacities.â According to Mahatma Gandhi, âEducation is a means to all-round drawing out of best in child and human body, mind and spirit.â\n\nP:13\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 4 According to Dr. Radha Krishnan, âEducation should be manâmaking and societyâmaking, education without this remain poor and incomplete.â According to John Dewey, âEducation is the development of all those capabilities in the individuals, which will enable him to control his environment and fulfil his possibilities.â According to Comenius, âEducation is the development of the whole man. The ultimate end of man is happiness with God.â CONCLUSION OF DEFINITIONS Education is the act or process that leads a person to better understanding of the situations. It is the process of imparting and acquiring knowledge and training to grow one's intellectual and mental capabilities, so as to make mature decisions in different situations. 2.2 Physical Education 2.2.1 Meaning and definition of Physical Education, its aim and objectives Generally, Physical Education is to be understood for development of various organs of human body and we consider physical education as physical exercise only, but it is only a myth. Physical Education is not only a group of exercises but, it has a wider meaning, beyond the group of exercises. Literal meaning of the word Physical Education is education of human body but it is not limited to the human body alone. The word âPhysical Educationâ is the combination of two words i.e. physical and education. Whereas âPhysicalâ refers to the body and âEducationâ refers to the knowledge and for that we can say physical education means a wider knowledge of physical health, power, endurance, and also appearance. Physical Education from time to time has been addressed by using different and peculiar words. (a) Physical Training (P.T.) : Many people call physical education as Physical Training which means training of the physique of an individual. With the help of P.T. one can develop tolerant, strong and healthy body. (b) Physical Culture : This name of physical training was prevalent till the end of 19th century and people who value old pattern still follow this. In physical culture process of weight lifting is followed to develop outlook of the body. (c) Drill : Drill is yet another name given to Physical Education. This word is widely used in Army. Any work which is done in systematic manners in army called âdrillâ. Drill is occasionally carried out on the beat of the 'drums'âto synchronise individual exercise, with a group. (d) Sports : The word âsportsâ has a wide sense which includes all games like Football, Volleyball, Cricket, and Handball and so on. All jumping, throwing activities are part of it. Training through these one can develop all physical and social qualities. (e) Gymnastics : Some people call Gymnastics as Physical Education due to the effects of European thoughts on Physical Education, the word Gymnastics is used more as synonymous to Physical Education. Physical Education in fact is that part of education which is imparted through physical training programme. It is considered as education of the body which enables an individual to grow and develop fully. Physical\n\nP:14\n\n5 2. EDUCATION & PHYSICAL EDUCATION activities are the educational tools that promote optimum growth and development. Physical Education is not only doing physical activities but also related with health education, Recreation, Anatomy, Physiology, Psychology and Sociology. Some Important Definitions of Physical Education According to H.C. Buck, âPhysical Education is that part of the general education programme, which is considered with growth, development and education of children through the medium of big muscle activities is concerned with the growth, development and education of children. It is education of the child by means of physical activities. Physical activities are the tools. They are also selected and conducted to influence every aspect of child's life.\\\" According to Charles A Bucher, âPhysical Education is an integral part of the total education process and has as its aim the development of physically, mentally, emotionally and socially fit citizen through the medium of physical activities which have been selected with a view to realizing these outcomes.â According to J.B. Nash, âPhysical Education is a phase of education that deals with big muscle activities and their related responses.â According to J.F. Williams, âPhysical Education is the sum of man's physical activities selected as to kind and conducted as to outcome.â According to A.R. Wayman, âPhysical Education is that part of education which has to do with the development and training of the whole individual through Physical Education.\\\" According to D. Oberteufer, âPhysical Education is the sum of those experiences which come to the individual through movement.â According to C.C. Cowell, âPhysical Education is the social process of change in the behaviour of the human organism, originating primarily from the stimulus of social big-muscle play and related activities.â According to R. Cassidy, âPhysical Education is the sum of the changes in the individual caused by the experiences centering in motor activities.â According to Ministry of Education, \\\"A National plan for Physical Education and Recreation, âPhysical Education is education through physical activities for the development of total personality of the child in its fullness and perfection in body, mind and spirit.â According to American Association of Health, Physical Education and Recreation âAAHPERâ, âPhysical Education is the way of education through physical activities which are selected and carried on with regard to values in human growth, development and behaviour.â According to Marshal & Rees, \\\"Physical Education is but one aspect of the larger problem of education in general, and any system which divorces, or tends to divorce, the physical from the moral and intellectual aspects of life, is thoroughly unsound.\\\" According to Sharman, âPhysical Education should help to develop skills and attitudes which will be\n\nP:15\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 6 conducive to the wise use of leisure time and provide opportunities for emotional control, living according to acceptable social standards and self expression.\\\" According to Brownhill and Hagman, \\\"Physical Education is the accumulation of wholesome experiences through participation in large muscular activities that promote optimum growth and development.\\\" Conclusion of Definitions Physical education is an integral part of the general education which promotes harmonious growth and development. Through vigorous muscular activity a person modifies his behaviour. A person becomes physically, mentally, socially and emotionally adjusted within the society. Through physical activities a person improves and strengthens his body which is essential for leading a fruitful life. It promotes efficient functioning of the body. Aim and Objectives of Physical Education It has been said in various definitions of Physical Education that as a result of educational experiences, education bring changes, amendments and equilibrium in life. In the field of general education aim of education is to establish those values which by themselves educate people. In the field of physical education, these values, make the individuals secure. This way aim is the last objective. The aim is distant and general in nature. The aim of Physical Education is a generalized purpose. In 1964, William said, \\\"Physical Education should aim to provide skilled leadership, adequate facilities and ample time that will afford an opportunity for the individuals or groups to act in situations that are physically wholesome, mentally stimulating and satisfying and socially sound.\\\" According to L. Mastere, âAim of physical education is said to be healthy citizen, social status and stability.â Although all objectives can be aim, but some are so distant and general in nature, that to achieve them is difficult. Aim circles around object. This is abstract and presents a model. Aim of Physical Education According to K. W. Book Walter, \\\"Aim of physical education is maximum and attractive development of man from physical, social, mental and emotional view point. Overall development can be possible through games, exercises and gymnastics under suitable guidance.\\\" For the achievement of aim, following objectives should be considered : 1. Good physique 2. Control on physical activities of the bodies 3. To train good citizen 4. Preparation for vocations 5. Character building 6. Use of spare time Aim of physical education can be achieved through some principles 1. Aim of physical education is based on long term planning. 2. Aim of physical education is based on scientific facts.\n\nP:16\n\n7 2. EDUCATION & PHYSICAL EDUCATION 3. Aim of physical education is based on complete programme, not only one part. 4. Aim of physical education is based on new facts which is coming out from the implementation of the objectives. 5. Aim of physical education should be based on the principles generated from social necessities. AIM OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION (Overall Development of Personality) OBJECTIVES OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION Physical growth Mental Social Emotional Leadership and development Development Development Development Development According to J.B. Nash, âDevelopment of different human organs, muscles sensation, co-ordination and toning up is the objective of physical education.\\\" J.B. Nash gave following objectives of Physical Education : (a) Organic development (b) Neuro-muscular development (c) Interpretive development (d) Emotional development According to H. C.

To improve knowledge (a) Knowledge of the rules of game (b) Knowledge about games and physical exercise (c) Knowledge of education through the medium of games (d) Spirit of citizenship According to Irwin, Objectives of Physical Education are as under : (a) Physical development (i) Health (ii) Development of skill in physical activities (iii) Physical growth and development (b) Social development (c) Emotional development (d) Development of skill in recreational activities (e) Intellectual development. Properly planned physical education programme can easily attain all the aforesaid objectives of generating qualities of a good citizen. Ideal Objectives of Physical Education are as under: A. Development of organic fitness: The first and primary objective of physical education is to develop good physique. Through physical training the efficiency of organic systems like respiratory system, circulatory system, digestive system, endocrine system, muscular system and neuro-muscular system improves. These organic developments lead to the development of physical fitness components. The physical fitness includes strength, speed, flexibility, agility and endurance. Physical fitness enables a person to perform vigorous activities. Generally physical fitness and good health are considered same but it is wrong. A healthy person may be physically unfit because he may be lacking in any component of physical fitness. Regular vigorous exercise also increases the efficiency and capacity of an individual to lead a fruitful life. Therefore vigorous physical activities should be done for the physical growth and development. B. Mental development : Physical education involves the activities which increase intellectual power of man. For example a basketball player has to keep the ball safe from opponents, take care of footsteps and also throw the ball into the basket accurately. If a player is physically healthy but not mentally alert then he cannot become a good player. In this way, physical education provides a proper environment for physical and mental development.\n\nP:18\n\n9 2. EDUCATION & PHYSICAL EDUCATION C. Social development : Physical education develops the goodwill amongst human being. When we play with different players belonging to different places, it creates the environment of social development. It helps in the development of social qualities like feeling of brotherhood, cooperation, helpfulness and sympathetic attitude, etc. Every player attains knowledge about nature, customs and traditions of others. In this way, we acquire many new things and habits of others. It makes our living status higher. The aim of conducting inter-state and inter-university competitions is the social development among diversity. D. Emotional development : Sometimes a healthy and mentally sound person becomes emotional and instead of facing difficulties, he himself gets trapped. He begins to give undue importance to the feeling of pleasure, sadness, love and hatred. It leads to wastage of his valuable time and energy. The playground makes our aggressive emotions humble. An individual learns to control his emotions and provides constructive outlet to his emotion in the play-field. In this way physical education enables us to control our feelings and emotions. E. Leadership development: Sports develop qualities of good leadership. The scope of physical education is very broad. On many occasions, players have to become captains, secretary, referees or umpire. In this way we get skilled leaders. The leadership quality makes a person able to bear the burden of life and perform the duty of life efficiently. F. National unity: Physical education along with social goodwill creates the feeling of national unity. In inter-state competitions players come into contact with the players of other states and they gain knowledge about the customs, food, habits and dresses of each other. This results in national integration and feeling of brotherhood among the participants. Hence, Physical education is useful for an all-round development, good citizenship, human feeling and national unity. 2.2.2 Need and Importance of Physical Education in the Modern Society and its Relationship with other Subjects Need of Physical Education Physical Education does not mean physical fitness alone but it has its own effect on an individual. Moreover, it is all-round development of personality. Today's lifestyle has entirely changed, we purely depend on machines and gadgets. Physical exertion is hardly a part of our lifestyle and we do our daily task with the help of machines. Due to these helpful gadgets our health related risk factors have increased. Therefore, for making an individual busy and for constructive utilization of his spare time, physical Education programme is very useful. Some important points of view about the need of physical education are: Shri Ramkrishna Paramhans, âA person with weak intelligence is like rice soaked in milk, 'soft and swollen'; he is of no use and cannot achieve anything. A strong and well built 'He-man' is called valiant. He can do anything in life and achieve everything.â Probel, âIf we want complete development of an individual, we necessarily have to give physical exercise to each part of body.â\n\nP:19\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 10 Russo: âMind in a healthy body has easy and well pronounced working pattern.â Herbert Spencer, âFor complete manifestation of an individual, physical, moral and mental activities are necessary.â H.C. Buck says that, \\\"feelings for health splendour, capability and feeling of strong character are generated by well planned physical education\\\". Physical education programme has been considered necessary because of the following factors : (a) Natural life of an individual has changed because of scientific progress. (b) Individuals during earlier days used to produce all their daily need items through their own physical labour, but their work today is being done by machines. (c) An individual has more spare time because all his or her work is being done by machines. (d) Because less physical labour is distancing a person from good habits. (e) Physical exercise therefore has become necessary to keep the body parts, in regular use, and saving them from developing weakness. (f) Physical exercises increase the capability of body and protect it from diseases. (g) Physical education for youth is the most important to make the country strong and powerful. (h) Physical exercises are needed to correct the physical deformities. (i) Physical education is essential for physical and mental growth. (j) Physical education develop qualities like, courage, bravery, discipline and tolerance. (k) Physical education is essential to develop leadership qualities. (l) Physical education is essential for developing social integration. Importance of Physical Education Physical education has become a part of school curriculum all over the world. It explains about body movement and other physical activities. It involves variety of activities including individual and team sports. Participation in various games develops cooperation and unity. The need and importance of Physical Education is as follows: A. Harmonious growth and development : Harmonious growth and development is the most important objective of physical education. All living things grow. A tiny seed can grow into a huge tree. Adult elephants are 60 times heavier than baby elephants. Every living organism consists of cells. The cells can multiply and divide to form other cells. Physical Education also has relation with growth and development. Exercise may promote muscle strength. The regular physical training can improve various organs. B. Development of physical fitness: Through games and sports development of body takes place. A physically fit person can help others, whenever his help is required. The various components of physical fitness are speed, strength, endurance, flexibility and agility. Physical fitness enables a person to perform vigorous activities. Generally, physical fitness and good health are considered synonymous but, it is wrong.\n\nP:20\n\n11 2. EDUCATION & PHYSICAL EDUCATION A healthy person may be physically unfit because he may be lacking in some component of physical fitness. Regular vigorous exercise also increases the efficiency and capacity of an individual to lead a fruitful life. Therefore, vigorous physical activities should be done for the physical growth and development. C. Emotional Development: Many competitive sports develop the emotional qualities which are very essential for the socialization. For example a boxer while playing is emotionally aggressive but after the last bell goes he shakes his hands with the opponent by converting his anger into affection. Hence we can say that sports helps a lot for the emotional development. It is actually to learn the control over the emotions. D. Development of cooperative attitude: Especially in team games all the players of the team practice together to perform successfully. The lesson of cooperation is learnt within the team. The tactics involved in team games are successful due to cooperation of the players, e.g. in hockey, a player scores a goal with the cooperation of his team-mates. Hence team games helps in the development of cooperative attitude. E. Development of sympathetic attitude: While playing if somebody gets injured, all the players display affection and sympathy towards him. It can be observed in the cricket match also whenever any player gets injured all the players rush towards him sympathetically. F. ChanneIization of surplus energy: It is evident from surplus energy theory that every individual possesses extra energy which tends to play. Sports and games provide a healthy outlet of this energy otherwise, this surplus energy can lead someone towards antisocial activity. So, the proper channelization of energy helps in socialization process. G. Development of discipline: We have to play under certain rules and regulations of the game in the playfield. So, games and sports develop habit of remaining disciplined which is also an important social behaviour. Fear of disqualification in the match also directs a player to remain disciplined despite of emotional arousal. H. Development of National Integration: Physical education and sports help a lot in the process of national integration. Number of playful activities provide many opportunities to create feeling of brotherhood and cooperation. We can attain national integration through games and sports. I. Development of Socialisation : An individual can develop many social qualities through games and sports like dutifulness, discipline, loyalty, cooperation, sincerity, tolerance, regularity, punctuality, morality etc., which promotes the feeling of friendship and brotherhood. Hence we can say that games and sports contribute a lot towards the formation of healthy society. J. Knowledge of Health Education: Healthful living requires an intensive and extensive understanding of health. Health education guides a person to lead a fruitful life. Health education acts as public relations which gives information about health and disease. It is very essential for every community. Health education informs the people about the prevention of diseases particularly in epidemics. It motivates the people to develop clean habits and ways of living. For example, drinking of contaminated water leads to many health hazards which can be prevented by the use of safe drinking water. K. Knowledge of Human Body: Physical education provides knowledge and understanding of various systems of the human body. It enables a person to know about effects of exercise on various systems of the body. This knowledge can help an individual to protect his body from various diseases.\n\nP:21\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 12 L. Development of leadership: An individual gets many opportunities to lead in the field of physical education, like captain of cricket team who acts wisely, sincerely, impartially and effectively. Even leadership training is provided when a leader is appointed for warming up. Sometimes organisation of competitions also helps in the development of leadership qualities. The importance of Physical Education can also be felt after understanding the following quotations: According to Herbert Spencer, âThe perseverance of health is a duty.â According to Rousseau, âIt is the sound constitution of the body that makes the operation of mind easy and certain.â According to Froebel, âIf we wish to develop the whole being we must exercise the whole human being.â It is clear from the above quotations that physical activities lead to the development of harmonious growth and development of the body. In the conclusion we can say that physical education and sports should be popularised on massive scale and should reach even the rural areas to make a nation healthy. Physical Education : Relation with other Subjects Physical education is very broad area in itself. It is not only playing different sports on ground but, it conveys a very wide meaning. It is often believed that physical education is an art or science. Yes, it is combination of both art and science. Physical education consist of foundation of physical education which is related to History, Psychology and Sociology. These are all arts (education) subjects. On the other side Anatomy, Physiology, Kinesiology, Exercise Physiology, Sports Medicine etc., are related to Science. So we can say, physical education does not only impart knowledge of arts subjects but also gives knowledge of science subjects. Without the knowledge of arts and science, physical education is incomplete in itself. In physical education, students learn the art and science of human movement, which includes motor learning, physiology and psychology of human movement; the art of teaching and motivating potentials of an individual, and an art of appreciation with the help of communication skills. The interdisciplinary relevance and relation of physical education can be well judged with the help of career opportunities and scope available for the physical educationist. Apart from physical activities, the specialized training in this field has many career avenues like sports management, sports media, sports medicine, biomechanics, designing, testing sports equipments etc. The other specialized branches like exercise physiology helps in getting employment in health clubs, hospitals and massage and rehabilitation centres, yoga trainer and nutritionist etc. Hence, the vast area of physical education reflects the inter- disciplinary approaches of the subject with other subjects. Nowadays physical education has a vast scope. In recent times the scope has tremendously broadened. The various disciplines of Physical education are explained below : A. Philosophy : Today in the world drastic changes have been taking place, so it is necessary to know about philosophical aspect of Physical education. It gives professional knowledge of physical education and also explains about the career options.\n\nP:22\n\n13 2. EDUCATION & PHYSICAL EDUCATION B. Sports Sociology : This branch of Physical education explains the role of sports and games in the society. The sociology is concerned with social behaviour and human relationship. Many social qualities are developed through participation in physical activities. According to Maciver, \\\"Socialization is the process by which social beings establish wider and profounder relationships with one another in which they become more bind up with, and more perceptive of the personality of themselves and of others and build up the complex structure of nearer and wider association\\\". The above quotation explains that socialization leads to better social relationship within the society. Physical education plays a big role in the sociology. C. Sports Psychology : \\\"Sports psychology is concerned with behaviour in games and sports. This branch of Physical education deals with motivation, cognitive learning, effective learning and psychomotor learning\\\". According to K.M. Burns, \\\"Sports psychology' for physical education is that branch of psychology which deals with physical fitness of an individual through his participation in games and sports.\\\" Psychology is considered as science of mind and soul. It helps in understanding model of motor learning and the stages of learning and their implications for the teaching of physical education. It also helps to know the influence of readiness, psychological benefits from participation in sports. It also deals with the role of anxiety arousal and application of planning to improve performance. It also explains the crowd behaviour and its effect on the performance of a player. D. Sports Physiology : This is one of the most important branch of physical education which studies the effects of exercise on human body. It explains the importance of exercises which are meant for physical fitness. It deals with effects of training programmes on various systems of the body including circulatory, respiratory, muscular, nervous, digestive and endocrine systems. E. History of Physical Education: It deals with the study of the past of various games and enables us to trace the history of physical education and sports. It explains how in primitive time man had to hunt to satisfy his hunger and how he started using bows and spears for this purpose. Later these activities became competitive sports so it tells that these activities were present in primitive times and are now also present e.g. archery and javelin throw. The historical foundations of physical education and sports often help future developments of physical education. It also helps in identifying the event and the outstanding leaders of physical education. It also enables us to know about the history and the origin of various games. F. Bio-Mechanics : Bio-mechanics is a branch of physical education which deals with various forces which act on the human body. It deals with mechanical principles of action of human body and sports implements. For example; mechanical analysis of javelin throw. Kinesiology is further a branch of bio- mechanics which deals with the function and action of various joints, muscles and bony structures.\n\nP:23\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 14 G. Sports Medicine : Sports medicine explains the medical relationship with physical education. It explains about various sports injuries and their management. It also deals with nutrition, drugs and ergogenic aids, during the training programme. H. Anthropometry : This branch of physical education deals with various measurements of human body. The various anthropometric characteristics like length, width, diameter, girth of bones and joints helps in predicting the playing ability. I. Pedagogy: Pedagogy of physical education is concerned with the study of curriculum, teaching methods, administration and organisation of sports. J. Physical Activities: Since, physical education comprise of variety of physical activities like games, fitness programmes, yoga, etc. These activities are further classified as under : (i) Games and Sports: Many skills based activities like Athletics, Basketball, Badminton, Baseball, Cricket, Hockey, Football. Volleyball etc., are included in Physical education programmes.

Rhythmic exercises are done on particular rhythm which can set through drum beats or music. Rhythmic exercises are helpful in developing endurance, flexibility and co-ordinative abilities. The activities like set drills, group dance, lezium marching, P.T. drills are best rhythmic exercises. Dancing is one of the important rhythmic activities. Most children jump up and down when they listen music. In dancing, people perform movements of their bodies in rhythmic patterns. The other important rhythmic exercises are done by the Rhythmic gymnastics. In this type of gymnastics, gymnasts perform a dance while co-ordinating with a piece of hand-held equipment. The equipment may consist of a ball, club, ribbon or rope. These activities are also important in physical education programmes. (iv) Yoga : Yoga is not simply a physical exercise but it gives relief to physical and mental ailments. The practice of yoga has curative value for many diseases. (v) Recreational Activities: Hiking, trekking, fishing, river-rafting, camping etc., are much needed after undergoing vigorous physical training programmes. Hence physical education has a very vast scope. Physical education teachers, coaches, sports scientists, and sports administrators are among the persons who help in running the Physical education programmes efficiently.\n\nP:24\n\n15 2. EDUCATION & PHYSICAL EDUCATION 2.3 History of Physical Education 2.3.1 Pre Independence Development of Physical Education in India History of physical education development can be divided into two periods (a) Ancient period (b) Medieval period. Pre-independence development of Physical Education in India ANCIENT PERIOD MEDIEVAL PERIOD Pre- Vedic period Historical period Nalanda period British period Vedic period Epic period Rajput period Maratha period Muslim period A. ANCIENT PERIOD : (a) Pre- Vedic period (b) Vedic period (c) Epic period (d) Historical period B. MEDIEVAL PERIOD: (a) Nalanda period (b) Rajput period (c) Muslim period (d) Maratha period (e) British period. A. Ancient Period (a) Pre-Vedic period (3250 BCâ2500 BC): With the evolution of earth humans were also born. To fulfil their requirements they were indulged in many physical activities, even there were no education, and awareness of fitness was zero. But, need for food took them towards physical activity. They lived in caves and they were purely based on hunting. They were doing throwing, running, archery, etc. to fulfil the need for food. These activities made them physically fit. As the time passed these civilizations flourished and reached on their peak, the evidence of this is excavation of Mohanjodado, proves that these early civilizations were actively engaged in physical activities. The activities like dancing (group dance), animal fighting and boxing were being practised by the people during that period. (b) Vedic period : (2500 BCâ600 BC) : The Hindu Vedas considering being ancient books in the world but there is no direct hint for physical fitness during this period. Yoga especially asana (surya namaskar) originated in vedic period. People used to do Asana and Pranayam for purification of soul. Generally, people were very strong and they quarrelled amongst themselves. Archery, wrestling, horse riding, chariot riding, gymnastic were meant for the soldiers and warriors.

(c) Epic period (1000 BCâ600 BC) : This period also refers to as Mahabharata and Ramayana period. Epic period was said as developed period. Kings of this time maintained big armies and people remained busy in war games. Fitness during this era meant for war-training of warriors. It was clearly mentioned in Ramayana, the holy book of Hindus that of Ram-Raven yudh (war). Ram was good in archery and Hanuman was the strongest warrior and wrestler. Even today in India we can see wrestlers worshiping\n\nP:25\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 16 hanuman as their founder guru. In this period we also got idea from Mahabharata, another holy book of Hindus that 'kashatria' children in their early adolescent age were trained in weapon training. For education, universities were established in their kingdoms, Patliputra, Taxshila, Kannoj were great examples of this. We had example of Arjuna, he was very perfect in archery and Bheem (brother of Arjuna), Lord Krishna, Balram were famous for wrestling. The physical activities that were preferably performed by the people were Archery, Javelin throw, Gada fight, Wrestling, Sword fight, Swimming, Chauser, Dancing and Music, etc. During this period royal families used to involve themselves in hunting. One of the important features of this period was practicing fighting with animals. (d) Historical period (320 ADâ1000 AD): The time of Mahatma Buddha was considered as historical era. Entire North India was conquered by Maurya dynasty. During this period weapons were used only during wars. The movement of Mahatma Buddha and Mahaveer were on their peak. In peace time physical activities like Wrestling, Running, Hoping and jumping, Javelin throw, Horse riding, Archery, marble shooting were part of their daily routine. During this period, yogic exercises were more practiced. Gautam Buddha himself taught yogic activities, as he believed in controlling powers and thoughts. B. Medieval Period (a) Nalanda period (600 BCâ300 BC) : In this period, systematic teaching was given much importance. Physical health was considered to be important means for improving spiritual health of the people.

(b) Rajput period (300 ADâ1200AD) : Rajputs were fought for tribes. They were divided in thousands of tribes. Rajputs believed in good health. They gave full attention to physical fitness and training. They used to fight for the sake of supremacy. During this period, females were taught horse riding without saddle. Maharana Partap, the great warrior was proficient in throwing javelin (bhala, neza) and he was a perfect horse rider. Sword Training, horse riding, dance, music, archery, wrestling, chess, hunting etc were famous physical activities in this era. (c) Muslim period (1200 ADâ1750 AD): Muslim came up as a superior power. They paid a lot of attention on military training.

EDUCATION & PHYSICAL EDUCATION (e) The British period (1858 ADâ1947) : During this period East India Company entered India for trading and in 1858 entire country came under British rule. English people were very fond of games and sports. Cricket, hockey, football, gymnastics were introduced for the first time in India. Here we highlight few important aspects about development of Physical Education: l In 1833, the British government was toying with the idea of declaring physical education as compulsory education. l In 1882, the first Indian Education Commission recommended that schools should introduce Physical Education in their curriculum. l In 1894, the government desired that Physical Education should be made compulsory. However, this idea did not click at that time. l 1914, Guru Hanuman set up Vyayam Prasarak Mandal in Amravati. l In 1920, YMCA College was introduced by H.C.Buck for scientific study of Physical Education. l In 1924, the Gujrat Vyayam Shalla Mandal was set up in Ahemdabad and Vyayam Prasarak Mandal in Bhavnagar and Maharashtra. l In 1927, Indian Olympic Association was formed with great efforts of Dr. A.G.Noehren, Mr H.C. Buck and Mr Sorabji Tata. l In 1931, Government College of Physical Education, Hyderabad was established. l In 1938, Training Institute of Physical Education, Kandivali (Bombay) was started. Post Independence Development of Physical Education in India In 1947 after the independence the development of Physical Education came into prominence. The role played by various committees and institutes is described below: (A) Dr. Tara Chand Committee In 1948 Dr. Tara Chand committee was formed which mentioned about the introduction of Physical Education. This committee gave emphasis for the training of teachers in the field of Physical Education. The introduction of Post Graduate level course in Physical Education was done by the recommendation of this committee. In addition to this, the committee suggested to establish Gymnasia, Sports Clubs and Akhadas.

This committee gave following suggestions : (a) Establishment of Central organization for Physical Training. (b) Establishment of Training centers for Physical Education. (c) Starting of one year Practical degree course in Physical Education. After the valuable suggestions of the committee, Laxmibai National College of Physical Education was established in âAugust 1957 at Gawalior (MP) but it was then managed by Sports Authority of India and known as LNIPE (Laxmibai National Institute of Physical Education).\n\nP:27\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 18 B.P.Ed course was offered by LNIPE and to get admission in this the eligible condition was to pass 10+2 examination. The subjects included in the B.P.Ed course are as follows : 1. Methods of Research 2. Measurements and Evaluation 3. Study of progress of Physical Education in different countries. 4. Formation of Organizations for Physical Education and Recreation and their management. (B) Central Advisory Board of Physical Education and Recreation Later in 1950 Government of India constituted Central Advisory Board of Education which contributed a lot for the development of Physical Education in India. With the recommendation of Tara Chand Committee this committee comprised of ten nominated members. The Central Advisory Board had a strong vision to raise the standard of Physical Education Organizations in the country and also to put them into 2nd Five Year Plan to get better grants. For better recommendations, board called meetings and conferences with the Principals and Physical Education teachers in various inspections.

(f) To give directions to the state governments for improving Organization of Physical Education in their respective states. The inaugural meeting of the reconstituted board was held in 1961. The board made various committees to examine in detail important issues like place of Physical Education in the school's curriculum. It also suggested the ways and means of improving the quality of training Physical Education in the colleges. Most important contribution of the board was inclusion of two syllabi of Physical Education for boys and girls separately up to the higher secondary stage. (C) Rajkumari Amrit Kaur Coaching Scheme Government of India introduced Rajkumari Amrit Kaur Coaching Scheme for Games and Sports in 1953. The aim of scheme was to impart training to sportsmen. The scheme received wide popularity since famous players like Major Dhyan Chand and Dr. Ram Singh worked under this scheme. After eight years it was merged with the national coaching scheme of National Institute of Sports, Patiala. (D) All India Council of Sports (AICS) The Union Ministry of Education constituted All India Council of Sports in 1954. Gen. K.M. Kariapa was nominated as first president of AICS. The major role of this council was to advice the government in all the matters related with sports. This council also coordinated between government and various sports bodies. To check proper utilisation of the funds given by government was its top priority.

The Greek calendar was based on the Olympiad, the four-year period between games. The first games were held in the wooded valley of Olympia in Elis. At that time the Greeks erected statues and built temples in a grove dedicated to Zeus, supreme among the gods. The most famous shrine was an ivory and gold statue of Zeus. Phidias created this sculptor. It was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The games which were held in 776 BC were not the first games, but rather the first games held after they were organized into festivals held every four years. The gap period was known as Olympiad. A peace agreement was done in between the city- states of Elis and Pisa. The Eleans traced the origin of the Olympic games to their King Iphitos, who was told by the Delphi Oracle to plant the olive tree from which the victor's wreaths were made. The first Olympic event was a 200-yard dash. This was the only event until 724 BC. In 708 BC the pentathlon was added and wrestling became part of the games. This pentathlon, a five-event match consisted of running, wrestling, leaping, throwing the discus, and throwing the javelin. Later boxing, chariot race, and other events were included. The winners of these games were crowned with wreaths from a sacred olive tree that grew behind the temple of Zeus. Hercules, the founder of the games planted this tree. The Olympics were considered as a religious event for the Greeks. The site Olympia was dedicated to Zeus. There was a gold and ivory statue of Zeus. Fairy Tales of Olympics : Some of the fairy tales about Olympic being quite very popular are given below : According to one fairy tale, these games were started to celebrate the victory of \\\"Zeus over\\\" \\\"coronas\\\". Two Gods who lived in the high mountains of Olympia, Coronas and Zeus fought with each other to gain supermacy over earth. Zeus won the war. Olympics games then started to celebrate this victory. According to another fairy tale, temple of Hera sister of God Zeus is situated on the\n\nP:36\n\n27 3. OLYMPIC GAMES, ASIAN GAMES AND COMMONWEALTH GAMES ground where Olympic games were held. According to Historians and archeologists, this temple may have been constructed about two hundred years, prior to 776 BC when Korovas won 200 yards race for the first time. These games started at least two centuries, prior to that wars used to be stopped one month in advance from the date of commencement of Olympics. All athletes aspiring for participation in Olympics, used to assemble at one place, and present themselves in front of the selectors for training. Two days prior to the full moon day, all athletes would march towards Olympic. No cheating and malpractice was used to win. A player indulging in such practice was punished. The games were held every four years from 776 BC to 393 AD. These games were abolished by the Christian Byzantine Emperor Theodosius I. The ancient Olympic Games lasted for 1170 years. Rules for the Competitions Rules which governed the Ancient Olympic Games were as follows: (a) Athletes were Greek citizens with good health. (b) The slaves and foreigners were not allowed to participate. (c) Women were not allowed to take part or witness these games. (d) Every player required to stay in Olympia and they had to take an oath that they have received training. (e) On the day of competition all the family members and relatives used to gather in the council hall. (f) As per the historical records, games were conducted for the period of five days. (g) All the winners of the competitions received rewards for example; animal, food grains etc. Later on, it was stopped and garlands or bouquets of olive leaves were given to the winner. (h) In the year 394 AD the Olympic Games were stopped by king Theodosius. Decline of Ancient Olympics Games : The following factors were responsible for the decline of Ancient Olympic Games : (a) Greece was conquered by Rome. (b) Romans were not much interested in games. (c) After their defeat in war Greeks also lost their interest in games. (d) Players in these games and other games played, more with the spirit of winning rather than spirt of nationalism. (e) Professionalism entered the games. (f) Professionalism brought lot of malpractices in the games. (g) Bribe was given to the officials. (h) King of Rome Nero participated in the Chariot race and won it by cheating. (i) In Boxing, iron was first used, which resulted in the death of one of the competitor. Ultimately, in the year 394 AD Roman Emperor Theodosius banned these games. Theodosius 2nd ordered to demolish the wall of Olympic stadium. About a century after this, a strong earthquake ruined remnant of Olympia.\n\nP:37\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 28 3.1.2 Modern Olympic Games The revival of the Olympic Games was entirely the result of work done by Baron Pierre de Coubertin. In 1875, a group of German archaeologists began to excavate the ruins of the stadium and temples of Olympia. These remains were destroyed by earthquake and buried by a landslide. These excavations motivated Baron Pierre de Coubertin to organise Modern Olympic Games. In 1893 renowned sportsmen from all over the world were called for a meeting. But the meeting could not get success due to poor response. Baron Pierre de Coubertin again invited the delegates from United Sates of America, England, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Russia, Greece and France to discuss revival of Olympic Games. During the meet he said, âLet us export our oarsmen, our runners, our fencers to other lands. That is the true free trade of the future and the day it is introduced into Europe the cause of place will be received a new and strong allyâ. The successful campaign to revive the Olympics was started in Baron Pierre de Coubertin France by late in the 19th century. The first Modern Olympic Games were opened on Sunday, March 24, 1896, in Athens in Greece. Athletics, Wrestling, Weightlifting, Swimming, Shooting, Fencing, Gymnastics, Cycling and Tennis were included in the first Modern Olympic Games. The details of years and venues are given below: Olympic Venue Year Olympic Venue Year Tokyo 1964 Athens 1896 Mexico 1968 Munich 1972 Paris 1900 Montreal 1976 Moscow 1980 St Louis 1904 Los Angeles 1984 Seoul 1988 London 1908 Barcelona 1992 Atlanta 1996 Stockholm 1912 Sydney 2000 Athens 2004 Antwerp 1920 Beijing 2008 London 2012 Paris 1924 Rio De Janeiro (Brazil) 2016 Tokyo (Scheduled) 2020 Amsterdam 1928 Los Angeles 1932 Berlin 1936 London (1940â1944 Not held) London 1948 Helsinki 1952 Melbourne/Stockholm 1956 Rome 1960\n\nP:38\n\n29 3. OLYMPIC GAMES, ASIAN GAMES AND COMMONWEALTH GAMES Olympic Symbols Flag and Rings Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the Modern Olympics, designed the flag in 1913. The flag has no border and displays five interlocking rings in the centre on a plain white background. Each ring is assigned a different colour of blue, black, red, yellow, and green. It was thought that these colours were chosen because at least one colour can be found in the flag of every continent of the world. The various rings represent the continents of Africa, America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. The red ring represents Australia, the green Europe, the yellow Asia, the blue America and the black Africa. All these rings are interlocked that represent brotherhood and cooperation in different continents. The Olympic Flag was first used at the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium. After the games are completed, the mayor of the host city presents the mayor of the future host city the Olympic flag. This flag then remains with the future host city for four years until the Opening Ceremony of the next Olympic Games. Motto The Olympic motto is Citius, Altius and Fortius, which are Latin words meaning faster, higher, stronger respectively. The motto was proposed by the father of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, who got it from a speech given by his friend, Henri Didon, a Dominican priest and principal of an academy that used sports as part of its educational program. The Olympic Oath At the beginning of each Olympics, every athlete promises to play fairly and obey all of the Olympic rules. An athlete from the host country takes the oath at the Opening Ceremonies on behalf of all the athletes. The chosen athlete holds a corner of the Olympic Flag while repeating the oath. The oath is as follows: âIn the name of all competitors I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, committing ourselves to a sport without doping and without drugs, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams.â Baron Pierre de Coubertin wrote the oath. It became part of our Modern Olympic Games in 1920. The Olympic officials also have to take an oath. Like the athletes, an official is chosen to hold a corner of the Olympic Flag and repeats a similar oath on behalf of all the officials.\n\nP:39\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âI, SemesterâI) 30 The oath taken by Official is as follows: âIn the name of all the judges, I promise that we shall officiate in these Olympic Games with complete impartiality respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship.â The Olympic Flame The concept of lighting of the Olympic Flame came from the ancient Greeks. During the Ancient Olympic Games the sun rays were used to light the sacred flame at Olympia. The flame is lit until the Games are over. The flame was first introduced in Modern Olympics at the 1928 Games held in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Since then, the flame symbolizes âthe light of spirit, knowledge, and life.â Torch Relay The Torch Relay started in the Olympics in 1936 in the Berlin Games. Originally, the torch was lit at Olympia, Greece and then was carried by relay to the host city of the games. During the Opening Ceremony the last runner carries the torch into the Olympic Stadium. The flame is then lit from the torch and stays lit until it is extinguished in the Closing Ceremony. The Torch Relay symbolizes Olympic traditions being passed from one generation to the next. The first relay took place during the 1936 Berlin Games. 3,331 runners brought the flame through Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. Similar relays are organised for every Summer Games. Olympic Creed The Olympic Creed is also known as the Olympic Message. It has appeared on the scoreboard of every modern Olympic Games during the Opening Ceremony. It states the following: âThe most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph, but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered, but to have fought well.â Olympic ideals, Objectives and Values The main objective of Olympic Games is global unity. Baron Pierre de Coubertin explained the objective of Olympic games in his speech at 1908 Olympic Games. According to Baron Pierre de Coubertin, âThe most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part. The essential thing in life is not conquering but fighting well.â Olympic Games draw attention of the world towards the importance of physical training. It develops health and produces better citizens. The development of loyalty, brotherhood and team spirit takes place through participation in games. The various diversities due to different castes, racial differences, languages, cultures the difference between countries widens the outlook of sports persons. Olympic Games bring all the nations on one platform.\n\nP:40\n\n31 3. OLYMPIC GAMES, ASIAN GAMES AND COMMONWEALTH GAMES Colourful ceremonies begin the Olympic Games. The opening ceremony is made impressive to create excitement in the Olympics. The athletes of Greece always march first into the stadium. This honour is given because Olympic Games originated from Greece. The other teams come in alphabetical order. The host country comes at the last. The opening ceremony is followed by raising of Olympic flag and the lighting of Olympic flame. The fire was lighted in Greece by using a mirror to concentrate sun rays. The flame burns throughout the games. 3.1.3 Asian Games Introduction Asian Games are the biggest multi-sport games after the Olympic Games.
