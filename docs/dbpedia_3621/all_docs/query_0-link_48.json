In the olden times psychology was considered to be science of soul. The word psychology is derived from two words-psyche and logus. Here, Psyche means \\\"soul\\\" and Logus means \\\"to talk\\\". Earlier the meaning of psychology was\\\"talking about the soul\\\". Later, it was called the science of soul\\\". Since, the evolution of nature and origin of soul was not known, this concept of psychology was discarded. After that the old concept of psychology, as a \\\"science of soul\\\" changed to \\\"science of mind\\\". Again it was criticized because we cannot read the mind of others. Later, psychology was defined as \\\"science of consciousness\\\" which was also discarded, because it could not explain the self-conscious and unconscious states of mind. At last, psychology is accepted as a science of behavior. This whole concept was well explained by Woodworth, âFirst psychology, lost its soul then it lost its mind, then it lost its consciousness, it still has behavior of sort.â Hence, it can be said that psychology is a study of inner behavior of an individual through outer expression. According to Skinner C. E., âPsychology deals with responses to any and every mankind of situation that life presents. By responses or behavior it is meant all forms of processes, adjustments, activities and expressions of the organism.â According to Pillsbury, âPsychology may be most satisfactorily defined as the science of human behavior.â According to Mc. Dougall, âPsychology is the positive science of conduct and behavior.â According to Warren, âPsychology is the science which deals with the mutual interrelation between an organism and environment.â According to Munn N.L., âPsychology is a positive science of experience and behavior interpreted in terms of experience.â\n\nP:13\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 4 According to Crow and Crow, âPsychology is the study of human behavior and human relationship.â According to Watson, âPsychology is the positive science of behavior.â According to Bernard, \\\"It is the study of the organism's adjustment to its environments.\\\" According to Drever, âBehavior is regarded as an expression of that inner life of the thought and feeling which we call mental life.â Conclusion of Definitions: Psychology is defined as the science that studies the human organism as influenced by heredity and dynamic forces of experiences and environment. Psychology studies human behavior in terms of its growth and change, so that the behavior becomes meaningful and significant in the life of the individual and for the society in which he/she lives. Meaning of Sports Psychology Physical Education has various branches, and sports psychology is one of the most important branches of physical education. Many researchers have shown that performance in sports largely depends upon various psychological factors. Psychology of sports deals with various psychological theories which help individuals to achieve their optimal performance. According to Rushall (1989), \\\"Performance improvement are mainly due to the application of principles of the enhancement sport science (physiology, bio-mechanics and sports psychology). In practical situation it is difficult to determine whether improvement occur because of change in fitness level (a physiological contribution) or improved behavioral/appraisal factors (physiological contribution). Sports psychology deals with the human behavior, arousal, motivation, and aspiration in particular sports situations.\\\" Today, sports is no more a pleasure sport, it is a competitive process, where every athlete tends to achieve success at any cost. This constant urge to earn success has made this process more complicated. It involves the scientific training of an athlete and his behavior inside and outside the playfield. Moreover, in order to have optional performance at the time of competition seek the involvement of behavior scientist i.e. sports psychologist. Hence, sports psychology is a behavioral science related to the experimentation and analysis of mental and emotional behavior of a sports person during competitive situation. According to R. N. Singer, âSports psychology is encompassing scholarly educational and practical activities associated with the understanding and influencing of selected behaviors of people in athletics, physical education, vigorous recreational activity and exercise.â 2.1.2 Psychological Factors Effecting Physical Performance To excel in games and sports, an individual must be psychologically ready. Many psychological factors effect the performance in sports. A common example of cricket can easily clear this concept. A person doing batting near to his century becomes disturbed. Some of the factors are explained below: (a) Mental Capability: Various people differ in mental capacities like concentration, thinking power, confidence, etc. Due to these differences, the performance level of athletes also differ. A person having better mental ability tend to perform better if all other factors are same. The enthusiasm and will-power also has great impact on the performance level.\n\nP:14\n\n5 2. PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION (b) Aggression: All the competitive sports need aggression to excel. Particularly games like boxing, wrestling, judo, fencing, etc. require optimal level of aggressive behavior to excel. So the low or even high level of aggression can also affect the performance in sports. (c) Interest: Different individuals have different levels of interest. Some are interested in sports whereas some avoid playing and enjoy the company of books. The less interest towards sports certainly affects the performance in games and sports. (d) Motivation : High level of motivation is required in every phase of learning and towards attainment of goal. Without motivation it is impossible or difficult to achieve the aim. So, motivation is required at every step of learning process whether a player is undergoing a training or participating in a competition. Lack of motivation definitely affects the performance in games and sports if all other factors are same. (e) Social Nature : Individuals differ from one another in respect of social nature. Some are introvert in nature and some are extrovert in their behavior. A person with introvert trait will feel difficulty in performing well in team games where the involvement as group participation is required more. So, it is also taken into consideration while selecting the sports for an individual with extrovert nature should preferably take part in team games. (f) Attitude : Prolonged interest becomes attitude of an activity. It leads to the mental setup of an individual towards the activity. Poor attitude towards sports in the family can affect the performance in sports. Even the lethargic attitude cannot give good results in sports. For example a person says, \\\"I love to play basketball and other person feels he does not like playing basketball\\\". This makes a difference in the performance. (g) Confidence: Psychological conditioning makes a person confident in a particular game. A player having faith in his training becomes more confident in achieving good results in sports. Lack of confidence yields poor results in games and sports. (h) Competitive Spirit: âWill to Winâ and 'Killing instinct' are important in winning. A person having strong will-power and desire to win the competition often exhibits good performance. Some players display good skills in practice however they fail to perform well during competition. The competitive spirit has great impact on the performance in sports. (i) Tolerance: In games and sports a player has to tackle with different individuals. A player who lacks in tolerance may lose his temperament which can adversely affect his performance in games and sports. (j) Staleness: Repeated performance of a particular activity may create boredom which can affect the performance in games and sports. 2.1.3 Meaning of Learning Learning is the fundamental and social process of human life. Everybody in this world is learning from birth to death. The learning process continues for the entire span of life. It begins in cradle ends in coffin. Learning is considered to be the modification of behavior to experiences. Learning is a process of acquiring new, or modifying the existing knowledge.\n\nP:15\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 6 According to Pressey, Robinson and Horrocks, âLearning is an episode in which a motivated individual attempts to adapt his behavior so as to succeed in a situation which he perceives as requiring action to attain a goal.â According to Henry P. Smith, âLearning is the acquisition of new behavior or the strengthening or weakening of old behavior as the result of experience.â According to Woodworth, âAny activity can be called learning so far as it develops the individual and makes him alter behavior and experiences different from what they would otherwise have been.â According to Kingsley and Garry, âLearning is the process by which behavior is originated or changed through practice or training.â According to Crow and Crow, âLearning is the acquisition of habits, knowledge and attitudes. It involves new way of doing things, and it operates on individual's attempt to overcome obstacles or to adjust to new situations. It represents progressive changes in behavior.â According to Gates, âLearning is the modification of behavior through experience and training.â According to B. F. Skinner, âLearning is a process of progressive behavior adaptation.â According to Brook, âLearning is a process of acquiring the ability to do things which the learner never did before.â Conclusion of Definitions Learning is finally considered as modification of behavior of an individual. On the whole learning is acquisition of habits, knowledge, attitude and retention. The process of learning is not always positive it can be on either way. 2.1.4 Laws of Learning In early 1900's Edward L. Thorndike world renowned Psychologist from America put forward the three laws of learning. He formulated these laws on the basis of experiments conducted on animal learning. The following are the Primary laws of learning (A) Law of Readiness The Law of Readiness depicts that a person can learn only when he is physically and mentally ready to learn. It is found that a person learns best when he is ready to learn a particular activity. The learning takes place effectively when a person is curious and ready to learn. So, motivation before any kind of learning is very important aspect. When trainee pays attention, feels interested and becomes curious to learn, better learning takes place. For example you can take a horse to a pond, but cannot make him drink, if he is not thirsty. Similarly if a person is not interested to learn particular sports then he will not learn at any cost. According to Thorndike, âWhen any conduction unit is ready to conduct, for it to do so is satisfying. When any conduction unit is not in readiness to conduct, for it to conduct is annoying, when any conduction unit is in readiness to conduct, for it not to do so is annoying.â\n\nP:16\n\n7 2. PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION (B) Law of Effect This law is also known as law of pleasure and pain. It involves the emotional reaction of the learner. When learner faces satisfaction and joy in learning process he always learns effectively. Learning is strengthened when it is accompanied by a pleasant or satisfying feeling. On the other side learning is weakened when it is associated with an unpleasant experience. According to Thorndike, âWhen a modifiable connection between stimulus and response is made and is accompanied or followed by a satisfying state of affairs, that connection's strength is increased. When made and accompanied or followed by an annoying state of affairs, its strength is decreasedâ. (C) Law of Exercise The Law of Exercise states that constant repetition of any activity leads to the development of adequate responses. On the other side if a single exposure is given the chances of learning and retention are rare. This law is further divided into following two parts: (a) Law of use: This law is supported by a well known proverb 'Practice makes a man perfect'. The more practice of the activity strengthens the learning. (b)Law of disuse: This explains that if a learned concept is not revised the chances of retention are very less. So the need of repetition of learnt things is important. According to Thorndike, The law of use, \\\"When a modifiable connection is made between a situation and response that connection's strength is, other things being equal, increased.\\\" Law of disuse, âWhen a modifiable connection is not made between a situation and response, during a length of time, that connection's strength is decreased.â The following are the Secondary laws of learning (A) Law of Recency This law states that the things that are most recently learned have better retention. Repetitive review and summarization always help in remembering. (B) Law of Primacy This law explains that activities learnt first have more impact on learning. So what is taught first time must be accurate. The proverb first impression is the last impression supports this law. (C) Law of Intensity of Stimulus The more intense stimulus of the activity, the more likely it is retained. So it is found that the activity should be started with full efforts. (D) Law of Attitude Learning depends on attitude to a great extent. The mind set plays vital role in any kind of learning. The learner executes the task properly and efficiently if he has got positive attitude towards that task. (E) Law of Freedom This law states that the things freely learned are best learned. If the learners are given more freedom they learn with sense of enjoyment and responsibility. The knowledge of these laws always helps the teacher for better understanding of learning behaviors of the students.\n\nP:17\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 8 (F) Law of Disuse When for something there is no changeable contact between situation and reaction, in that case association power decreases. Disuse decreases links between the stimulus and the response. (G) Law of Disposition Learning of any physical activity is directly proportional to the attitude of student. If student is not mentally ready, in that case he shall remain unsuccessful in performing that activity and will definitely repeat mistakes. (H) Law of Association To perform an already done activity in the same manner but, under different circumstances, is called law of associations. (I) Law of Purpose If a learner is clear about the purpose of doing an activity and if that activity fulfills the aim of student he will learn quickly. (J) Law of Belongingness If response belongs to the situation, connection is more easily learned. 2.1.5 Learning curve, its types, characteristics and implications in Physical Education and Sports Meaning of Learning Curve Everybody in this world is learning from birth to death. The learning process continues for the entire span of life. Learning is an experience in which a provoked individual try to assume his behavior so as to accomplish something in a situation which he perceives as requiring action to attain a goal. During the learning process, the teacher as well as the students are always curious to know about their progress. To see the performance at a glance, graphs are used for this purpose. These graphs are known as learning curves. According to C. E. Skinner, âA learning curve is a progress representation of a person's improvement (or lack of improvement) in a given activity.â According to Alexander, A. Scheneiders, âWhen graphically represented this record constitutes a curve of learning.â Learning curve is a graphic or pictorial representation of learning process. In the graph, period of training is taken along X-axis whereas progress is taken along Y-axis. Since learning is a complex process, the learning curve can show up and down in the learning. Types of Learning Curve Learning curves are mainly of four types which are given below: (a) Straight line curve (b) Negatively accelerated curve/convex curve (c) Positively accelerated curve/concave curve (d) Combination curve/'S' shaped curve\n\nP:18\n\n9 2. PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION Progress (Y-axis) Progress (Y-axis) Progress (Y-axis) Training period (X-axis) Training period (X-axis) Training period (X-axis) Straight line curve Negatively accelerated curve Positively accelerated curve (a) Straight Line Curve Straight line curve shows constant rate of improvement. It is very rare because learning progress shows up and down trends. But according to this graph, the learner achieves the improvement and progress in learning skills at a fast pace. This is mainly observed during the initial phase of learning. But with the passage of time the rate of progress slows down. (b) Negatively Accelerated curve (Convex Curve) This type of learning curve is also considered as convex shaped curve. It shows rapid increase in the beginning but afterwards the learning slows down. This may happen because at the initial stage learner may feel easy whereas learning process slows down with the time due to difficulty in the task. In this type of graph, stagnation may occur at the end of the learning process. (c) Positively Accelerated Curve (Concave Curve) This type of learning curve is just opposite to the negatively accelerated curve. It is also called concave curve. In this curve there is slow progress in the beginning, however after some time learning gradually increases. This type of trend is achieved when the learner feels difficulty in acquiring new and tough skills. But later on feels comfortable and interested in learning skills. (d) Combination Curve ('S' shaped Curve) This curve combines the negatively accelerated, positively accelerated and straight line curve. That is why it is called combination curve. It is also known as 'S' curve, because it resembles English alphabet 'S'. As shown in the combination curve, spurts, declines and plateaus often occurs. So it is important to know about them and is explained ahead. Progress (Y-axis) f g h e b a cd Time (X-axis) Combination Curve\n\nP:19\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 10 Spurt: Spurt depicts rapid learning, whenever it occurs first time in the combination curve then it is called initial spurt (a to b shown in the figure). Before the final limit, when the learner acquires progress that segment of the curve is called end spurt (e to f as shown in the figure). Decline: This part of the learning curve represents decline in rate of learning. It can also be classified as initial declines (b to c as shown in the figure) and end decline (f to g as shown in the figure). Plateaus: Plateaus are often seen in learning curves. It shows stagnation in the learning progress. In this stage, the rate of learning neither increases nor decreases. The curve becomes straight and horizontal. (In the figure initial plateau is represented by c to d and end plateau is represented by g to h). According to Woodworth and Marquis, âA long flat stretch in the learning curve, a long period of almost no improvement is picturesquely called a plateau, provided it is followed by more improvement.â According to C. E. Skinner, âPlateau is a horizontal stretch indicative of no apparent progress.â Plateau is the most crucial period of learning process because it creates boredom in the activity so it is necessary to know about the causes and remedies of plateaus. Plateau may occur due to the following causes: (a) Lack of interest in the activity (b) Fatigue (c) Wrong teaching methods (d) Lack of practice (e) Feeling of satisfaction (f) Use of old equipment (g) Staleness (h) Too much difficulty in the learning process (i) Physical limit (j) Transfer of errors from one activity to another activity (k) Age How to Overcome Plateau Plateau is an unavoidable stage in the learning process but the teacher should utilize all his efforts to break the plateau. (a) Change in the teaching methods If the plateau occurs, teacher should concentrate on his work. He should utilize latest and effective teaching methods which can break the plateau. He can also take the help of audio-visual aids for better understanding of the skill. (b) Rest Fatigue or staleness often occurs due to overtraining which leads to the plateau. Proper rest should be given in the learning process. (c) Motivation High level of motivation should be given to the trainees, which can inspire them to overcome the plateau. Reward and punishment can be used to make it effective.\n\nP:20\n\n11 2. PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION (d) Change in the task Introduce change in the task to avoid boredom. This temporary change can make learner fresh in spite of plateau. (e) Exposure Whenever an athlete faces plateau, he feels depressed. If the environment is changed and exposure to the new environment is given that can overcome plateau. (f) Feeling of satisfaction When athlete starts feeling that he or she has achieved the best, the plateau occurs. The athlete should be encouraged to break the feeling of satisfaction which can cause plateau. Characteristics of learning curve (a) The initial phase of learning curve may have a sudden spurt or slow pace in the beginning. (b) The learning curve cannot be uniform throughout the learning process. Otherwise, it would have been a straight line. It always shows mixed pattern of ups and downs in the learning process. (c) The last stage of learning curve hardly shows any improvement despite continuous efforts. (d) There seems a stagnant or plateau stage in-between the initial and last stage of learning process. It neither shows improvement nor downfall in the learning. (e) It may show improvement in the learning process after state of plateau by changing learning conditions. (f) In learning curve this shorter period of evaluation is always better to show complete trend of learning. Implications of learning curve (a) Learning curve may prove beneficial to the teachers in order to compare the performance of students in a learning process. The pictorial representation can easily show the difference among these learners. (b) Whenever a coach observes start of downfall in the performance, he should detect errors and try to remove those as early as possible. (c) The learner can easily assess his progress and make comparison with his fellow learners. (d) It helps in maintaining the record of various stages of learning process. 2.1.6 Psychological Characteristics and Problems of an Adolescent Meaning of Adolescence The word 'adolescence' is derived from Greek word 'adolescence' which means 'to grow to maturity'. Generally, this period is referred to \\\"teenage\\\". During this period, a young boy or girl emerges from childhood to adulthood. In fact it is an age of great changes and transformation. According to Stanley Hall, âAdolescence is a period of great stress and strain, storm and strife.â According to Rogers, âAdolescence is the period of achieving the attitudes and beliefs needed for participation in society.â According to Jean Piaget, âPsychologically adolescence is the age where the child becomes integrated into the society of adults; the age when the child no longer feels that he is below the level of his elders but equal to at least in rights.â\n\nP:21\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 12 According to Sadler, âAdolescence is that period in which a child tries to become capable of doing everything by himself.â Conclusion of the Definitions The above definitions describe this period as a period of tensions and full of drastic changes. Great behavioral changes take place in this age. It is an age in which the adolescent gives up the childhood habits and tries to take initiative in doing something new by him. Adolescent is considered a person who is no longer a child but not yet an adult. Generally, the age of adolescent corresponds to the teenage years. So it varies from 13 to 18 years of age. It is considered that boys and girls have outgrown childhood. Characteristics of Adolescents Characteristics of adolescence can be defined as physiological development, mental development, social development and emotional development. (A) Physiological Development During this period, lot of physical changes appear in the body. They are explained as under: (a) Development of height and weight: There is sudden development in height and weight in both the genders. In boys the height and weight increases rapidly due to hyper-activity of endocrine glands. Girls grow rapidly and they are heavier and taller than boys at the age of 13. (b) Development of body organs: Different body parts grow at different pace till they attain maturity. Boys look masculine as their muscles of legs and arms are tougher than girls. While girls look like a feminine as their muscles of arms and legs remain soft. (c) Development of body functions: In this period functions of body parts are little hyper due to secretion of glands, as a result voice of boys become hoarse and high-pitched, while girls have sweet and shrill voice. (d) Development of sex organs: During this age, sex organs like genital organs get development. In girls growth of the breast and broadness of pelvis appears. (e) Development of internal systems: During this age, all systems like circulatory, respiratory, and digestive system acquire full growth. (B) Mental Development During adolescence period, some changes appear with relation to mental development. They are explained as under : (a) Development of intelligence: Adolescence is the age where maximum growth and development of intelligence is achieved. Intelligence sometimes differs due to individual differences. (b) Development of abstract thinking and logical reasoning : Abstract thinking and logical reasoning is developed during this period. Adolescents can think, concentrate and find answers scientifically. They talk critically and begin to think more like adults. They still tend to be egotistic and inexperienced in some of their thoughts.\n\nP:22\n\n13 2. PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION (c) Development of Memory and imagination : The memory in adolescence period develops tremendously sharp and they also possess excessive imagination. They have a great curiosity in them to know more and more about people, places and principles. They are exceptionally imaginative and most of the time, they live in day-dreaming. (C) Social Development (a) Influence of peer group: The lifestyle of an adolescent is greatly guided by his/ her peer group rather than those of the elders in the family. There is often a tendency for hero worship. Heroes may be great athletes, film actors, etc. They discuss their problems with friends only. (b) Sex consciousness: Adolescents are more conscious about other gender. Both the boys and girls get attracted towards each other. They want to have friendship with opposite sex. (c) Social consciousness: Adolescence is a very sensitive period. Adolescents always like that they are praised by friends, parents and teachers. They want that their opinion must be considered. Their behavior is more clam and mature. They take part in social activities. Most of the adolescents are extrovert by nature. They are very social. At this age, they form bigger groups of friends. In this period, they spend most of their time with their peer group. The adolescents develop self-confidence and welcome the opportunity to take responsibility and that is why they move out in bigger social circle. (d) Group loyalty and Peer acceptance: When children enter in teenage, they are not aware of realities of society. They are loyal, believe in social services and live in ideology. They are very loyal towards their friends and can do anything for them. Peer acceptance makes adolescence socially effective which help them to develop as normal human being. The adolescents who are not well accepted by friends tend to be anxious and restless. (D) Emotional development Emotional development can be defined as love, anger, fear, laughter and tears etc. Adolescence is the period of âstorm and strifeâ. The following are the emotional characteristics that develop in adolescence period: (a) Development of love and affection : The emotions of love and affection are very important for the teenagers. Love and affection towards opposite gender is not only the emotions in the adolescence but instead of this they love themselves, they love their body parts, they love to dress up and spend most of the time to beautify their faces. They are indulging in sexual activities for pleasure and get disturbed. (b) Development of emotion of anger : A teenager always needs their special place in the society. They always want that their ideas may be listened otherwise they may get angry. They get aroused when they are stopped to do what they want to do. (c) Development of emotion of joy : This is the another type of emotion which is found more in the teenagers when they get special position in the class, in peer groups or achieve something special in examinations or in elections.\n\nP:23\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 14 (d) Development of emotion of worry: Worry is the imaginary fear which can be seen in adolescents when they do not achieve what they want. (e) Development of unpredictable emotions: Adolescents experience lot of changes in mood. They are very emotional and emotional arousal is at its peak in this period. Sometimes it is difficult for them to control their emotions. The adolescents hate strongly whenever someone hates them. Adolescent Problems Adolescence is the period when a child is moving towards the adulthood age. During this period, many biological, psychological and behavioral changes take place. Due to this reason, adolescents face many problems which are described as under: (A) Physical problems: Physical problems are common in both girls and boys. The teenager girls go through menstruation problem which irritates them. They are often suffered with pain, backache, headache, cramps and feel depressed. Boys also face some sexual problems as they experience enlargement of genital organs. They also feel shy when their voice becomes hoarse. For the first time sexual glands become active which may lead to sexual problems. (B) Adjustment problems: Adolescence is a transition from childhood to adulthood, which effects their adjustments. They are expected to behave in a more matured manner. If they fail to do so they face many problems. (C) Sex behavior and sex problems: During the teenage, rapid growth and development of sex organs and secretion of hormones often lead them to experience fear, worries, anxieties and complexes. In this way, they invite many sex problems. (D) Aggressive behavior: Most of the adolescents possess and display aggressive behavior, especially when they are compelled to do an activity which is against their desire/liking. Sometimes, they are rebellious towards criticism. The adolescents display rebelliousness towards their parents whenever there is a conflict between them. The peer rivalry is more intense in adolescents because they have stronger emotions. (E) Emotionality: Adolescents are very emotional. This excited state of mind makes them mentally disturbed. It is observed that sudden changes of mood are very normal part of growing up. Adolescents might feel happy at one moment and sad at the other. Even they have tendency of committing suicides. Feeling of self-hate and anxiety can make adolescents very depressed. Any depression that lasts longer can lead to a serious problem. (F) Social status: Every adolescent desires significant social status. He is very much conscious of his self- respect. He wants social recognition. Due to increase in the body size, the adolescents feel sense of personal identity. They start considering themselves as completely grownup persons. However, most adolescents become involved in same age friendships. The adolescents are more conscious about their place in the society whenever they are compared with their peer group members. If their position and prestige is hurt, it can cause a problem for them. This problem becomes intense whenever their self-respect is hurt in front of their friends.\n\nP:24\n\n15 2. PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION (G) Projections: All adolescents always try to protect themselves by pointing out similar faults in others. Such poor attitude can put them in a problem. The adolescents are not interested in routine. They are interested in having new experiences. Generally, they commit a mistake and try to protect themselves by projecting similar mistakes of their friends. (H) Freedom: Every adolescent needs freedom but he/she should neither be over-protected nor under- protected. They tend to make themselves free from parental control. They should be given freedom and responsibility. If the freedom is not given, it can put them in a problem. (I) Juvenile Delinquency: The adolescents may indulge in offences like mischief, thefts, stealing and driving away cars, shop-lifting and violent behavior. It is also found that teenage boys often form street gangs. These tendencies are found to be more where parents fail to perform duties in the proper upbringing of their adolescent children. Sometimes, adolescents do destructive activities just to attract the attention of others. (J) Drug Abuse: Drug abuse is found to be more among teenagers. Many drugs are physically harmful if taken regularly. But if a single overdose of some drug such as heroin is taken, it can result into death. Adolescents experiment with drugs due to curiosity, lack of knowledge and peer group pressure. The habit or addiction to dangerous drugs is largely confined to period of adolescence. Conclusion: Adolescence is the age where a teenager grows very fast. Rapid growth and development leads to many problems. They should be properly guided and taken care both by parents and teachers. 2.1.7 The Role of Physical Education and Sports in Solving the Problems of an Adolescent Management of Adolescent Problems The above explained problems can be solved by adopting the methods given below: (A) Parental Guidance to Adolescents Being a wise parent to an adolescent has always been a difficult task. Most of the adolescents are not enemies of their parents but they are disturbed due to dozens of new adjustments they have to make. Parents should guide them properly at every step. (i) Sympathetic and Affectionate Attitude: Such attitude can make adolescents free of complexes and conflicts. The rude behavior of parents makes adolescents irritable and aggressive. Thus parents should have a liberal attitude. (ii) Democracy in the Family: Parents should create democratic atmosphere in the family for the proper growth and development of the child. (iii) Father-Mother Relationship: There should be cordial relation between the father and the mother. It is observed that adolescents are found to be introvert when their parents are not having a healthy relationship. (iv) Cooperative Attitude of Parents: Parents should cooperate with the school and college staff so that it can help in solving various difficulties of adolescents. Parents should provide pleasant atmosphere to their adolescent children so that it makes them free of tensions and worries.\n\nP:25\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 16 (B) Participation in Co-Curricular Activities Everybody needs recreational activities after a day's work which can make one mentally fresh for the next day's work. Every adolescent should be encouraged to participate in co-curricular activities which make them free from stress and strain. Participation in physical exercises, games, dancing, hiking, trekking, etc. can be a good source for healthy channelization of surplus energy present in the adolescents. Even activities like debates, dramatics, painting, music, etc., can also be helpful for the intellectual development of the adolescents. (C) Recognition of Individuality The correct and genuine opinion of adolescents should be given recognition. Wrong opinions should be discouraged. Sometimes the adolescents feel disturbed whenever they are treated like small kids. So parents should give them due respect and responsibility. They should be given same social status as their parents are having. (D) Religious Education Religious education should be given to adolescents which helps in the development of good character. Parents should visit along with adolescents to the various religious places like churches, gurudwaras, temples, etc. The religious speech and atmosphere greatly influences social behavior of an individual. (E) Appropriate Sex Education and Health Education Sex education should be given to the adolescents in a frank and scientific manner. Every sex related problems should be explained to adolescents so that they don't remain under confusion or fear. Sex education should be given at schools so that the adolescents can know about the physical changes that are taking place in them. All the questions regarding rapid physical changes should be answered in a straightforward scientific manner. For example, girls can be taught about menstruation so that they can tackle this situation without any problem or fear. (F) Independence and Freedom Adolescents should be given freedom and responsibility which makes them more responsible and confident. In the end we can say that adolescents have various problems which can be managed through intelligent handling and proper education. Hence, it is the responsibility of teachers and parents to channelize their energies towards constructive activities for the social welfare.\n\nP:26\n\n17 2.

It is a process in which the learner is made eager towards attainment of the goal. It is a psychological force which creates interest for the attainment of the aim. Motivation is essential for any kind of learning that is why it is called the heart of learning. It is also considered as golden road to learning. While highlighting the importance of motivation Kelly has written, âMotivation is the central factor in the effective management of the process of learning. Some type of motivation must be present in all kind of learning.â Hence, motivation is key to accomplishment, it may be regarded as some thing that compels, prompts and energizes an individual to act or behave in a particular manner at particular time for attaining some specific goal or purpose. Definition of Motivation Without motivation, it is very difficult to achieve the aim. Some of the important definitions of the motivation are as follows: According to Crow and Crow, âMotivation is considered with the arousal of the interest in learning and to the extent is basis to learning.â According to Atkinson, âThe term motivation refers to the arousal of tendency to act, to produce one or more effects.â According to Guilford J. P., âAny particular interval factor or condition that tends to initiate and sustain activity.â According to Bernard H. W., âMotivation refers to all those phenomena which are involved in the stimulation of action towards particular objectives where previously there was little or no movement towards those goals.â According to Hebb D. O., âThe term motivation refers to (i) existence of an organised phase sequence (ii) its direction and content and (iii) its persistence in given direction or stability of content.â According to Drever James, \\\"Motivation is an effective conative factor which operates in determining the direction of an individual behavior towards an end or goal consciously apprehended or unconscious.â\n\nP:28\n\n19 3. MOTIVATION AND TRANSFER OF TRAINING According to Goods, âMotivation is the process of arousing, sustaining and regulating activity.â According to Maslow, âMotivation is constant, never ending, fluctuating and complex and is an almost universal characteristic of particularly every organismic state of affairs.â According to Johnson, âMotivation is the influence of general pattern of activities.â According to Thomson M. K., âMotivation covers any and every factor of the springs of human action from the beginning to the end, i.e. attitudes, bias urges, impulse, drive, craving, incentives, desires, wish, interest, will, intention, longing and aims.â According to Fredrick McDonald, âMotivation is an energy change within the person and is characterized by effective and anticipatory goal-reaction.â According to Lowell, âMotivation may be defined more formally as a psychological and internal process initiated by some need, which leads to the activity which will satisfy that need.â According to Colman, âMotivation is inner condition of the organism that initiates or directs towards a goal.â According to H. N. Nunn, âAnything that initiates activity internal or external is motivation.â Conclusion of Definitions Hence, it can be concluded from the above definitions that motivation is to give reason, enthusiasm or interest that leads to specific action or certain behavior. Motivation is present in every function of life such as simple act of eating, drinking are motivated by hunger and thirst respectively. Types and Methods of Motivation Motivation is related with goals. Motivation is more or less a force which inculcates a person's interest in learning that activity to attain desired goal. Knowledge regarding various forms of motivation is essential to understand the real meaning of the term. It can be divided into two parts. (1) Internal/intrinsic motivation or natural motivation (2) External/extrinsic motivation or artificial motivation (A) Internal Motivation This type of motivation comes from within the individual. It is also known as natural motivation because it is a natural urge or inherent interest which compels an athlete to initiate and maintain the activity. Motivation is always intrinsic when the force comes from within oneself. For example when a person indulges in any sports to have perfection to display superiority or to gain social approval is an intrinsic motivation. (a) Bodily needs: Needs of the body like hunger, thirst and sex can also act as motivational force towards an activity. For example, sex can move a person towards unsocial activity. (b) Instinctive: Many inborn qualities can be prime movers of our behavior. Sometimes innate tendencies also push towards some goal. The individual is motivated to achieve higher level of skills in sports because of social status or prestige in the society. (c) Social: Many social motives can move a person towards an aim. Everybody wants social status, e.g. Kapil Dev has achieved name and fame in the world of cricket. This type of social motive can also create interest in sports.\n\nP:29\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 20 (d) Emotional: Emotional behavior can also influence us for the fulfillment of aim. Love and affection can also direct the behavior of an individual. (B) External Motivation It is also called artificial motivation. When external factors compel the person to do something then it occurs. Motivation is always extrinsic when external forces positive or negative produce a behavioral change. Reward, punishment, praise, blame or cash prize are examples of extrinsic motivation. It has been found that such methods motivate some persons more strongly than other factors. In fact extrinsic motivation includes factors that motivate the individual in achieving the goals. Some kind of artificial motivation are explained below. (a) Knowledge of the goal: The first and important artificial motivation is to provide knowledge about the goal. A learner must be made mentally ready towards the attainment of the goal. The goal selected should be according to the capacity of the player. The advantages of attaining the goal should also be explained to the learner. The learner must be acquainted well with the aim and objectives of the goal. For example, we can present clear-cut target in front of the trainee. A trainee can be instructed to achieve the distance in the prescribed time in case of jumps. This target can create interest in the given activity. (b) Knowledge of the result: A learner always wishes to know the results of his learning process. Periodic evaluation always acts as a strong motivational force. It helps the trainee to know about his progress from time to time. For example, in high jump, the trainee will always like to know about the height cleared. The knowledge of the result always creates interest and enthusiasm in the jumper. Learning graph can be utilized for this purpose. The proper evaluation of the trainee in terms of good or bad points proves as an effective incentive for the attainment of goal. (c) Reward: Rewards can be effectively used in the learning process. It can be observed even in the children of small age. We often give them rewards in the form of things like sweets for the attainment of desired goal. Rewards can be given in the following terms: (i) Cash prize: Prizes in the form of cash can also act as strong motivational force. For example, the Indian Government announces cash prizes for the players who get first three positions in Olympics. Asian games champion and world champions are also given cash prizes in the form of sports stipends to create interest in the respective games. (ii) Job : Good sportsmen are also given jobs in various departments like Indian Railways, Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India, Indian Police, Customs, Banks, etc. Job security also attracts to achieve well in sports.\n\nP:30\n\n21 3. MOTIVATION AND TRANSFER OF TRAINING (iii) Social rewards : It can be given in the form of shields, certificates, trophies, etc. Like Arjuna award, Rajiv Khel Ratna award, Padama Shri and Padama Bhushan is given to prominent sportsmen who excel in various sports at international level. Even Dronacharya award is given to the coaches to motivate them in the field of sports for preparing sportsmen at international level. Reward is considered as positive motivation. Students like it very much. A player can be motivated in the field of sports by appointing him the captain of the team. (d) Punishment : Sometimes punishment is required to motivate an individual, in case the method of reward has failed. It can be given in the form of fear of failure, pain, rejection, losing social status, etc. It is considered as negative motivation. It may also give good results. As far as possible, the use of punishment should be avoided. (e) Active participation : The coach should give stress on active and regular participation in the activity. Trainees should freely interact with coaches for better understanding. (f) Audio-visual aids : Audio-visual aids have great impact on the learning process. Audio-visual aids help in better understanding of the subject. For example, various techniques in the games can be explained with the help of video movies. (g) Competition and Co-operation: Competition among the learners always acts as a source of encouragement. Desire to do better than others always influence the individual to work hard. Competition, sometimes creates jealousy and rivalry which may hinder the learning process. Therefore coach should develop co-operative atmosphere within the group in spite of competition. For example, goal can be scored only with the co-operation of players. Whereas instinct of jealousy can disturb the coordination within the members of the team. Therefore co-operation as well as competition should be used in combination. (h) Teacher-student relationship: Teacher should direct students with sympathetic and affectionate attitude. He should have a charming personality which can impress students. A well prepared teaching plan always impresses the students. The teacher and the student should have a cordial relationship which helps them to interact in a direct and easy manner. (i) Latest equipment and good environment: Latest equipment should be provided to players to create interest in the activity. For example, if a player is practicing pole-vault with the help of aluminium pole and feels that he has achieved the maximum, he will try to stop the activity. Then he can be motivated by giving him a fiber-glass pole. Even well-maintained grounds also attract the individuals to\n\nP:31\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 22 participate in games. For example if an athlete is given a chance to run on synthetic track, it will certainly create interest and enthusiasm. (j) Effective Teaching: Teacher must be equipped with latest teaching methods. He should be aware of the latest research and development of the subject. For example, there is no use if we teach about high jump with old techniques like western roll, scissor style, straddle, etc. The latest style, the fossburry flop which is most advantageous should be adopted for creating interest in the activity. (k) Spectators : If there is a huge number of spectators, it will have a positive effect on the players. But its effectiveness depends upon the experience and maturity of athletes. If an inexperienced athlete participates in competition which is full of spectators then he will not be able to perform well in comparison to an experienced athlete. An inexperienced athlete is usually overpowered by fear. (l) Verbal Comments : Various factors of motivation are applied at various levels. Verbal comments should be used during competition. It also varies according to the past experience of the players. Experienced players are not generally motivated by verbal comments, whereas, beginners are motivated by this technique. Verbal comments should be used immediately. (m) Coaching and Guidance : Positive self-talk is a technique that can be used to enhance motivation. With proper repetition of self-talk one can alter a sports person's belief system. Mohammed Ali the world famous boxer of USA used to apply this technique. He used to repeat. \\\"I am the greatest\\\". He repeated his claim that his opponents believed it. The various techniques which have been mentioned above, plays a significant role in motivating a player towards the achievement in sports and games. It depends upon coaches to know which technique or a combination of techniques is more applicable upon an athlete. Sometimes a single technique cannot yield much. At this point, a combination of techniques can have positive effect. The coaches should also bear in mind the age of athlete and his past experience of competitions. It is tedious job for the coach to ascertain what technique or combination of techniques inspires a particular athlete to perform and to help him or her in acquiring these techniques for better performance. 3.1.2 Importance of Motivation in Physical Education and Sports Motivation is considered to have an essential and important place for the better performance of sports. Until a player is really motivated, neither he can learn anything nor he can develop interest in learning anything. Motivation plays a vital role in inculcating interest in children to have love for sports. It arouses many sorts of feelings in the minds of players. There are number of factors which contribute to effective and successful performance, e.g., physical stature, environment, degree of conditioning, personality, level of ability and motivation. All have a direct impact upon the effectiveness on the athlete's performance; however, if one factor was to be selected as most important, it would undoubtedly be the motivation. In order to achieve goal or aim, the player withstands many difficulties and obstacles. Successful athletes, with high levels of motivation are often able to deal with stress and arousal in a manner which allows them to optimize their performance over a wide range of situations. Research studies have shown that more motivated athletes are able to reduce their arousal levels in the crucial moments just prior to competition, whereas less motivated fail to do so.\n\nP:32\n\n23 3. MOTIVATION AND TRANSFER OF TRAINING Motivation serves to energize, select and direct performance. It helps in setting tough goals and in directing the energy and effort to achieve those goals. Intrinsically motivated athletes strive hard to master the skills and are propelled by the inward drive to accomplish the task while at the same time they do enjoy the challenging situations encountered during competition. Thus, we can say that the contribution of motivation in the performance of games is very important and useful. 3.2 Transfer of Training 3.2.1 Meaning, Definitions, Types and Factors Affecting Transfer of Training Transfer of learning occurs when learning in one area is shifted to another area. For example, learning to ride a bicycle helps a person later to learn more quickly to drive a motorcycle. It is easy to learn handball if the learner is a basketball player. The learned attributes often help in other activities which have common skills. It is found that many things performed by us are often influenced by already learnt things. It is usually carrying over of habits, attitude, skills and techniques from one area to another area. According to Crow and Crow, âThe carry-over of habits of thinking, feeling or working, of knowledge or of skills, from one learning area to another usually is referred to as the transfer of training.â According to Guthrie and Powers, âTransfer may be defined as a process of extending and applying behavior.â According to Sorenson, âTransfer refers to the transfer of knowledge, training and habits acquired in one situation to another situation.â According to Bigge, âTransfer of learning occurs when a person's learning in one situation influences his learning and performance in other situations.â According to Kolesnik, âTransfer is the application or carry-ones of knowledge, skill, habits, attitudes or other responses from a situation is which they are usually initially acquired to some other situation.â According to H. C. Ellis, âTransfer of learning means that experience or performance on one task influence, performance on some subsequent task.â According to James Drever, âThe improvement of one mental or motor function by systematic training of another allied function.â Conclusion of Definitions It is observed that many things we perform in day-to-day life are often influenced by our own previous experience of learning. For example a person playing basketball can easily learn skills related to handball. Types of transfer of training are explained below : (A) Positive Transfer This usually occurs when two skill acquisitions are similar in some way. The previous learnt skills make learning easier. The coaches can take benefit of this aspect of transfer of training. So, already mastered skills can be incorporated in the new skills which are being taught. For example teaching Squash to a tennis player is easier.\n\nP:33\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 24 (B) Negative Transfer When previously learnt activity hinders and interferes to learn new activity, this is known as negative transfer. A person driving in India may face problem when he drives in United Sates of America as they drive vehicle in different direction as compared to India. In sports setting learning of tennis may hinder the learning of badminton skills as in tennis the wrist should be firm whereas in badminton the player should have flexible wrist. (C) Zero Transfer When previous activity does not interfere or helps in learning new skills, this kind of transfer is known as Zero transfer. This occurs when both the activities do not have anything common in them. For example learning to play basketball may not help or hinder learning to play baseball. Theories of Transfer of Learning that explains factors affecting transfer of training Many theories were put forward to explain the pattern and factors of the transfer while learning new learning from old acquired learning. (A) Theory of Identical Elements This theory was introduced by Thorndike and later it was supported by Woodworth. The theory describes that the transfer of learning is facilitated in the second situation into the extent that it contains identical elements or factors which occurred in the learning situation earlier. The identical elements are like concepts, actions, facts, attitudes, principles, techniques, skills, etc. (B) Theory of Generalisation This theory was explained by Charles Judd. He claimed that the degree of transfer is proportional to the degree of generalization. Crow and Crow gave justification of this theory as, âThe developing of special skills, the mastery of specific facts, the achieving of particular habits or attitudes in one situation have little transfer value unless the skills, facts, habits are systematized and related to situations in which they can be utilized.â (C) Spearman's Two Factor Theory Charles Spearman explained that the learning depends on two factors and named them as G-Factor and S-Factor. He described G-Factor as General Factor whereas S-Factor as Specific Factor. He found the transfer is more when G-Factor is used as compared to S-Factor. (D) Gestalt Transposition Theory This theory was introduced by Gestalt. He explained that if the learner understands the relation of old and new activity then the transfer will be more. The transfer depends on insight and understanding of both the activities. Conclusion : Hence, transfer of training is influenced by the common factors, conditions, skills, concepts and techniques used in the sports involved. If the degree of relation is more then the transfer of training would be more beneficial in the related sports.\n\nP:34\n\n25 3.

These masks were used by Roman actors. That time personality was considered as an outer view of the person as seen by others. Personality is a dynamic and organised set of characteristics possessed by a person that influences his/her self-perception, habits, traits, attitudes and ideas of an individual. Generally personality is the sum of those characteristics that make a person unique. Personality is considered to be the interaction of biological and cultural heritage with the social environment. Personality has been viewed from various angles and as such its definition has never been fixed. It has been changing from time to time. Some important definitions are given below: According to G. W. Allport, âPersonality is the dynamic organization within the individual of those psycho-physical systems that determine his unique adjustment to the environment.â According to J. P. Guilford, âAn individual's personality then, is his unique pattern of traits- A trait is any distinguishable, relatively enduring way in which one individual differ from another.â According to G. W. Hartman, âPersonality is integrated organization of all pervasive characteristics of an individual as it manifests itself in local distinctions from others.â According to Sherman Mark, âPersonality is the characteristic pattern of behaviors, cognitions and emotions which may be expressed by the individual and or manifest to others.â According to Fredenburg, âPersonality is a stable system of complex characteristics by which the life pattern of the individual may be identified.â According to R. B. Cattel, âPersonality is that which permits a prediction of what a person will do in given situation.â\n\nP:36\n\n27 4. PERSONALITY, SPORTS AND SOCIALIZATION According to J. W. McDougall, âPersonality is a synthetic unity of all mental features and functions in their interplay.â According to Muir, âPersonality is the whole individual considered as whole. It may be defined as the most characteristic integration of an individual's structure, modes of interests, behavior, capacities, abilities and attitudes.â According to John Locke, âPersonality is a thinking being that has reason and reflection and can considered self as itself\\\". According to Dashiell, âPersonality is the total picture of one's ordained behavior, especially as it can be characterized by his fellow men is a consistent way.â According to Warram, âPersonality is entire mental organization of a human being at any stage of his development.â According to J.B Watson, âPersonality is the sum of activities that can be discounted by actual observations over long enough period of time to give reliable information.â Conclusion of Definitions All definitions stated above are not complete in all aspects but if we sum all these then the term personality can be understood. So personality is defined as a spectrum of qualities, characteristics, and behavior that an individual exhibits that makes them unique. Personality consists of a person's characteristics like, physique, appearance, intellect, knowledge, psyche, conduct, expressions or performance. It can also be concluded that personality is the sum of inner and outer capability of an individual. Characteristics of Personality (a) Uniqueness : Personality is something which is unique in each individual. Every personality differs from other personality. Personality is so unique that even two twins are not same or identical. No two individuals behave identically in a given situation. (b) Dynamic: Personality represents a dynamic orientation of organism to his environment. Personality is variable and it keeps changing continuously with the changing situation and circumstances. Hence, allows an individual to adust in the social environment. (c) Social necessity : Since man is a social animal, his personality develops in the social environment. Society for the development of personality creates different type of organizations. Whatever the personality may be, individual and society is responsible towards each other. Personality is greatly influenced by the social interaction. (d) Persistent qualities: Personalities refer particularly to constant attributes of the individual which are basic and not susceptible to frequent changing situation. (e) Self-consciousness: Each individual remains conscious about his personality. Personality exists because of self-consciousness. Self-consciousness helps in the personality development of an individual. Through this medium; one does evaluation of his behavior.\n\nP:37\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 28 (f) Adjustment: As man is a social animal and he continuously adjusts himself in various circumstances. These changing processes bring him to personality development which makes him more dynamic and confident person in the society. (g) Completeness: Personality is unique organization and the dimensions of personality like sentiments, wisdom and activity are inseparable, which itself makes the personality complete. (h) Consistent pattern: The unique organization of characteristics is seen as a consistent pattern of the behavior. (i) Heredity and environment creations: Personality is influenced by both heredity and environment. An individual gets some qualities from his or her ancestors, and these heredity characteristics interact with the environment factors which mould and shape his personality. (j) Goal directness: Human behavior always has a definite goal and he tries to achieve more goals. One can make a conclusion about his personality by finding out about his behavior and goal. Dimensions and Traits of Personality The dimensions of personality can be broadly classified under four headings : (a) Physical dimension : The physical stature or the physique is the basic aspect or dimension of human personality. Heredity plays a significant role in moulding this aspect of personality. But heredity alone would be helpless if conducive external environment is not provided to a child or vice versa. Physical dimension of personality includes features, shape, height, weight, endocrine system, nervous system, etc. No doubt, physique of a person gives first impression of personality. A healthy, tall, stout, handsome and 'V' shaped body asserts a positive impact on others. Whereas, a weak, small, ugly deformed physique has sort of repulsion about it. A muscular physique, a grooming phase and tall stature draws everyone's attention. A healthy individual is an asset to himself and the society because he contributes to his well-being as well as to that society. On the basis of physical dimension, the personality of an individual is classified as under. According to Kretschmer, \\\"Kretschmer classified the types of personality according to built of the person. These types are as explained below: A. Aesthetic Aesthetic type of people are tall and lean built. They withdraw from the world. B. Athletic Athletic individuals are muscular. They possess balanced body and personality. C. Pyknic They are short in height and fat. Their mood swings in abnormal way. Sheldon classified types on the basis of physique and temperament.These types are described below: A. Endomorphic Endomorphic body type is solid and soft. They have tendency to store fat. They also have wider and higher waist. Their built is shorter with thick limbs. They are very fond of comfort and are sociable.\n\nP:38\n\n29 4. PERSONALITY, SPORTS AND SOCIALIZATION Ectomorph Mesomorph Endomorph B. Mesomorphic A person having mesomorphic physique has large bones and muscles. They easily gain or lose weight. They are assertive and energetic. They also love adventure. C. Ectomorphic An ectomorphic physique is a typical skinny person. They have a light build with small joints and lean muscles. Temperament of ectomorphs is marked by inhibition and restraint. (b) Mental dimension : Human being is the only animal who is blessed with highly developed brain and nervous system. The human intelligence mainly comprise of mental process such as thinking, memory, generalisation, recapitulation and reasoning, etc. Human personality without mind and intellect simply has no meaning. A well build physique of an individual without intelligence and mental processes is just like a statue without life. It is a well known fact that, Man is a psycho-physical organism i.e mind and body unity and one part is incapable of effective survival without the other. Mental and intellectual capabilities of an individual helps an individual to adjust new changing social circumstances and overchanging social circumstances and overchanging situations of present day life in a most appropriate and conducive way. On the basis of mental aspect personality has been classified as follows : According to Burgess The objective/Direct â Equability, enthusiasm, aggressiveness. Introspective type/indirect â Imaginative, sensitive, inhibited form of thinking. Psychopathic â Ego centrism, emotional instability, strong sense of inferiority, depressed. (c) Social aspect : Man is known to be a social being and liking to be with other people. Nature created man simply as an animal, society made him a social being. The real recognition to one's personality comes from society. The way an individual interacts with others, and influenced by others and influences others, the way he adjusts himself in the changing social environment come under this aspect of personality. The social behavior, social acceptance, social impact, social views and social adjustment are of prime concern for the personality.\n\nP:39\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 30 A person should possess social qualities like feeling of brotherhood, sympathy, helpfulness, cooperation, sacrifice, sense of responsibility etc. in order to have balanced personality. This would help him in modification of behavior according to the changing scenario of the society in most appropriate manner. On the basis of social dimensions personality can be categorized as follow : According to Jung Extrovert â Social, cheerful, confident, take more interest in others. Introvert â Self conscious, shy, lovers of solitude. Ambivert â Mixture of both traits in balanced manner. (d) Emotional dimension : In the discussion of personality emotional stability cannot be overviewed. An emotionally unstable person falls into uncertainty and possess a constant threat to himself and society. Emotions must be trained, channelized and sublimated in order to have balanced personality. Emotional stable individual is a person who is able to control his emotions and channelize these emotions in constructive manner. Emotional dimension includes behavior like happiness of mind, depressed, courageous, coward, lack of control over thinking, aggression, fear, love and affection, etc. Psychologists believe that functioning of endocrine glands is responsible for emotion control. It is not dependent on heredity rather depends on environment. A person reacts differently in different situation as per his emotional state. Emotionally developed person is able to express right emotion at right time. According to Freud According to Morgan and Gilliland ID â Immoral self â unsocial self Elated â Happy/optimistic Ego â Social self Depressed â Pessimistic Super Ego â Saint self â High spirit Irritable â Short-tempered Unstable â Imbalanced H. J. Eysenck developed a very influential model of personality for explaining its dimensions. He described it on the basis of the results of factors analysis in responses to personality questionnaires. He identified three dimensions of personality which are explained below: A. Extroversion Eysenck classified extroverts as sociable and active people who enjoy meeting people. They are very fond of attending social gatherings. Extroversion is associated with leadership behavior. They are more likely to assert themselves in groups. Extroverts are less likely to experience anxiety over negative feedback. They possess positive outlook. They are friendly to other people and possess high energy. They adjust quickly to the situation. Those high in extroversion are often described as having a very positive outlook on life as well as being friendly, energetic and highly adaptable. All of these tendencies can serve a person well, particularly in certain social situations. B. Neuroticism Eysenck described neuroticism as reflecting differences in the intensity of emotional experience. These people are sensitive in nature. They have trait of anxiety and negative emotionality. Generally it is expected\n\nP:40\n\n31 4. PERSONALITY, SPORTS AND SOCIALIZATION that individuals high in neuroticism might be more likely to use drugs in order to reduce or avoid negative emotional states. C. Psychoticism The Eysenck's third dimension is less well defined than extroversion and neuroticism. The individuals high on psychoticism are tough-minded. They always try to take risks. Sometime they may engage in antisocial behavior. Personality traits related to psychosis lead to characteristics of aggression, aloofness, antisocial behavior and impulsive actions. Traits of Personality Meaning: Personality traits referred as qualities of an individual. As Woodworth stated that âA trait is some particular quality of behavior which characterizes the individual in a wide range of his activities and which is fairly consistent over a period of time.â A trait is permanent reaction tendency which represents behavior and generalized feelings e.g. aggressiveness, emotional stability, a tendency towards group affiliation considered as a trait. According to Allport,â Traits are as a group of characteristic reaction which reveals a typical adjustment of the individual to his environment.â According to Guilford,â A trait is any distinguishable relatively enduring way in which one individual differs from another.â There are five major traits which effects personality. These traits are extroversion, openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism and are explained below. (a) Extroversion/Introversion: A person having extroversion quality, must be outgoing and social and draw attention from crowds. They tend to be assertive and cheerful in their social interaction. Introversion, on the other hand are confused with shyness. Shyness implies a fear of social interactions or an inability to function socially. (b)Openness: A person who has openness trait must have willingness to try new things and experiences. They are adventurous and curious towards imagination and try to do new things. (c) Conscientiousness: Carefulness of a person must have the quality of motivation. They are organized and have a strong sense of duty. They are disciplined and achievement focused. (d)Agreeableness: A person having agreeableness trait must possess attributes such as trust, altruism, assertiveness and high amount of emotional expressiveness. (e)Neuroticism: Neuroticism refers to a person's emotional instability. People high in neuroticism worry frequently and easily slip into anxiety and depression. Modern view of dimensions of personality are referred as the âbig fiveâ personality traits. There is a significant literature supporting this five-factor model of personality. These five categories are described below. A. Extroversion The first dimension of personality is considered as extroversion. These display the characteristics such as excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness and high amounts of emotional expressiveness.\n\nP:41\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 32 B. Agreeableness This personality dimension includes attributes such as trust, altruism, kindness, affection and other pro-social behaviors. They always show amicability. C. Conscientiousness The people having attributes of this dimension show high levels of thoughtfulness, good impulse control and goal-directed behaviors. Those high in meticulousness tend to be organized. D. Neuroticism Individuals possessing high neuroticism display emotional instability, anxiety, irritability and sadness. E. Openness This trait refers to imagination and insight. The individuals having openness tend to have a broad range of interests.

They are very fond of day dreaming. Nowadays the personality has four basic types and are referred as A, B, C and D. These are explained below: Type âAâ Personality Type A personalities are described as competitive, self-critical and high achievers. They have high sense of time and always try to finish their job in time. They are always busy struggling against the clock. Such people can be easily aroused to anger, hostility and aggression. They are more prone to heart ailments. Type âBâ Personality Type B personalities are extrovert in nature. They are very entertaining and not easily stressed. They can be achievers but still they do not want to be competitive. They can delay the work and try to do at the last moment. They are able to cope with stress effectively. They are not overachievers and overambitious in life.\n\nP:42\n\n33 4. PERSONALITY, SPORTS AND SOCIALIZATION Type âCâ Personality Type C personalities try to spend a lot of time on finding about how the things work. They are very cautious and reserved in nature. They are not assertive and always suppress their own desires and emotions. They are very susceptible to depression as compared to type A and type B. They are lethargic, passive, hopeless and pessimistic. Sometimes, they even deny their own needs. They feel alone and their loneliness begins at an early age. Type âDâ Personality Type D's possess a negative outlook towards life and are pessimistic. They are characterized as those people who resist any form of change and prefer the monotony of routine. They are not adventurous and always resist responsibility. They withdraw as a result of fear of rejection. The main cause of depression is suppressing their emotions for long periods of time. Such individuals are usually prone to heart disease. They are susceptible to high BP, hypertension and depression. They usually lead a poor quality of life. 4.1.2 Factors Affecting Development of Personality (Heredity and Environment) Every individual differ from each other in every aspect especially in physical appearance, temperament and motives. This can become more complicated with increasing age and maturity. They acquire more characteristics as a result of their interaction with the environment. Personality is influenced to a great extent by both the factorsâheredity and environment. Effects of heredity on personality development Heredity is mainly a convenient term for the genetic relation between succession generations. Heredity factors start influencing child's personality development right from the time of conception. Heredity determines what the child gets through the transmission of chromosomes and genes of its ancestral stock from its immediate parents. It is considered to be the nature's process of transmitting certain physical and mental characteristics to next generation. These factors determine the following: (a) Gender of the child: At the time of conception, each mature sperm and ovum produces 22 matched chromosomes which determine the growth and development of a child but 23rd chromosomes of sperm and ovum is sex linked cell. It could be either x or y. It is sex linked chromosomes of father that play determining role of the neonate. (b) Physique: Physical appearance like height, weight, complexion of an individual largely depends on heredity. (c) Health and fitness: A person who has good health, strength, energy and vigour generally develops emotionally balanced attitude towards life and take part in various types of competitions. Whereas, physically less active person may develop unbalanced personality due to inability to take part in these activities. (d) Intelligence: It is mainly heredity that is responsible for the intelligence of an individual. There is direct relationship between intelligence and personality. Intelligent persons can make better adjustment in home and school or any other place. Intelligence plays an important role in the development of personality.\n\nP:43\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (B.A.âII, SemesterâIII) 34 (e) Endocrine Glands: Endocrine glands play an important role in the development of personality of an individual as their malfunctio"
