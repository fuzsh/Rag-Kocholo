        "text": "Job\n\nHayes Theater\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nMany of the early openings in the new theatre season are plays that have been transferred from off-Broadway to Broadway as there is the opportunity to do so with many small Broadway theaters becoming available. Having already played at the off-Broadway Soho Playhouse, and the Connelly Theater, Max Wolf Friedlich’s Job has been recently transferred to Broadway for a limited engagement at the Hayes Theatre.\n\nThis two-hander is about Jane (played by Sydney Lemmon), a suspended tech worker going through a personal re-evaluation of her life and her career in the industry, and Loyd (played by Peter Friedman), a therapist, who holds Jane’s future in his hands as he can or not certify her to be reinstated in a job at a tech company – a love/hate relationship that seems to be a conundrum for her.\n\nJane was compelled to take a leave from the company, User Care, because of the repercussions generated by a video of herself, in a state of mental distress, that went viral. Her desire is to return to the workplace as soon as possible whether this is a realistic possibility or not – or whether it would be detrimental to her own well-being. However Loyd is the person who must approve her return to work, and his instincts tell him that Jane’s work is doing more harm to herself – than good.\n\nJob is a mystery and thriller which takes its audience to the dark regions of the internet. The play is combative with the flashpoints of the conflict heightened by photos of the two protagonists taken at intervals which are appropriately highlighted by the black outs on stage.\n\nAnd then the questions come up. Among those questions was whether Jane’s presence at the therapist office was a cry for help — as she reveals her unhappy childhood, an unhappy love life which involved a traumatic abortion, and her job’s requirements to monitor the worst of human kind’s actions against other humans, which caused the trauma depicted in the viral phenomenon that resulted in her being suspended from her job.\n\nAnd there is Loyd, Jane’s therapist, who holds Jane’s future in his hands. He describes the therapy session as a hostage situation, and through the course of Job there are the revelations of his own baggage that he carries – and even the suspicion that Jane may have chosen him as her therapist for reasons beyond the help she needs from him to be reinstated in her job.\n\nWith all of these ingredients including confusion, haze, and doubt, Job becomes more than just the depiction of a therapy session, but also the unravelling and revelations of a murky and highly-charged suspenseful mystery. And as the playwright doesn’t provide an ending to the play – it is up to the individual audience members to balance the facts and red-herrings, and decide for themselves what the play’s conclusion might be or could be.\n\nDirector Michael Herwitz is assigned the task for acting as a counterweight to tune in and tune out the arguments expressed by these two characters, and does so meticulously with timing the revelations in small and large doses, and the fits and starts of the play itself. And this “dispute” or “discussion” or “therapy session” is presented in a concise 80 minutes.\n\nSydney Lemmon and Peter Friedman are the superb actors who portray these complicated characters in a complicated situation, and do so giving a master class in acting.\n\nJob is a thought-provoking play with the added responsibility of the audience to determine how it all ends — a play with a message for our time.\n\nElizabeth I: In Her Own Words\n\n59E59 Theaters\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nConcluding the East To Edinburgh 2024 presentations at the 59E59 Theaters is Carol Levin’s Elizabeth I: In Her Own Words. Produced by Flying Solo! Levin’s play, which has Tammy Meneghini portraying Queen Elizabeth I of England close to the end of her reign as Britain’s monarch in 1601, is one hour of frank and lucid emotional confessions as she contemplates her fears, and concerns — at a time of religious strife, international wars, exploring economic opportunities in the New World, and as a woman establishing herself in a position of authority in a male-dominated society.\n\nWe see Queen Elizabeth I in the contemplative state of reading before retiring to bed for the remainder of the evening. As she informs the audience, she has banished her ladies-in-waiting, and the audience members have now become her confidants. An intimate conversation that Queen Elizabeth I would not be able to have with her own peers at the time.\n\nShe sets the scene referring to William Shakespeare’s Richard II to allow her to ruminate about her life, loves, and triumphs – with particular focus on her feud with her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots including Mary’s self-generated conspiracies, and recklessness – and Queen Elizabeth’s struggles with her conscious about the Queen of Scots’ execution.\n\nQueen Elizabeth also wrestles with her religious beliefs, how she survived the accusations of being involved in conspiracies against her sister, Queen Mary of England, as well as her passions, and also the intervention of weather that made the English victory over the Spanish Armada possible.\n\nHowever what was most important was that Queen Elizabeth I was a brilliant tactician of state craft and diplomacy, and put her loyal country men first.\n\nIn Elizabeth I: In Her Own Words, Levin’s employs Queen Elizabeth I’s letters – and those letters written to her – references to Shakespeare as a willing propagandist for her regime – and what results is a portrait of a political savvy and brilliant ruler.\n\nLynn Nichols directs this personal story bringing out Tammy Meneghini’s dramatic gifts and the emotional outpouring that Queen Elizabeth I wishes to express, defiantly, and also with some regret.\n\nAlthough most of the facts, and stories contained in this play are not new to aficionados of Queen Elizabeth I, this portrait of Queen Elizabeth I is uncanny, informative, and a wise look back on a historical figure who can provide guidance to those people who are making history today.\n\nAmerican Ballet Theatre – Like Water for Chocolate\n\nMetropolitan Opera House\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nChristopher Wheeldon’s Like Water for Chocolate was given its world premiere by the Royal Ballet in 2022, and in what is a co-production arrangement with American Ballet Theatre, American Ballet Theatre presented its East Coast premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House in June of last year. Like Water for Chocolate has returned to American Ballet Theatre’s repertoire for the last week of the company’s Metropolitan Opera House season.\n\nMuch anticipated when it premiered Like Water for Chocolate is a 3-act ballet based on Mexican writer Laura Esquivel’s novel which was published in 1989, and was adapted into a successful film in 1992. Esquivel’s participation as a collaborator enhanced the realization of Like Water for Chocolate in its transition from the page to the ballet stage, along with the opulent costume and scenery designs by Bob Crowley, and the video designs by Luke Halls.\n\nThe complicated plot focuses on the love affair of Tita (portrayed by Skylar Brandt) and Pedro (portrayed by Carlos Gonzalez) with the theme of food as an important ingredient. The story is set against the chaos created by the Mexican Revolution in 1910 represented by flashbacks of past relationships, and flash forwards of weddings, the births of babies, deaths – much of which is communicated through the frequent appearances and re-appearances of ghosts.\n\nTita, the youngest daughter of the De la Garza household, is in love with Pedro, son of a neighboring rancher – but family tradition prevents their marriage as Tita is obligated to care for her mother in her old age. As Mama Elena (portrayed by Zhong-Jing Fang), Tita’s mother, disapproves of the match, she manipulates Pedro into accepting marriage to Tita’s sister, Rosaura (portrayed by Betsy McBride), which Pedro rationalizes in order to be close to the family, and most especially to remain close to Tita.\n\nAs marrying Pedro is out of the question, Tita develops a romance with Dr. John Brown (portrayed by Jarold Curley), a family physician, but she ultimately breaks the engagement. When Pedro’s wife dies, Tita and Pedro are united – finally but only after Pedro’s daughter is married to Dr. Brown’s son – providing one of the few happy endings in this story.\n\nThroughout Like Water for Chocolate, it is Mama Elena, patriarch of the Dela Garza family, who sets these passions into motion – along with many sub-plots – even manipulating the family members from the grave as a ghost – and also reveals herself and her own insecurities when the content of her diary is read after her death. But Tita’s love for cooking provides her with the optimism to survive the many calamities that she is facing.\n\nChristopher Wheeldon works within the familiar dance idioms of ballet and modern dance but the episodic nature of the story forces Wheeldon to create a series of dance vignettes rather than presenting a linear narrative story. Also as in other of Wheeldon’s full-length narrative ballets, composer Joby Talbot is a lynchpin member of the creative team.\n\nMuch of the ballet’s choreography is employed to bring clarity to what is a great deal of exposition, but there are divertissements and non-narrative sections as well. But as noted at its East Coast premiere last season, Wheeldon’s strengths are in his choreography for the abstract moments in Like Water for Chocolate rather than in the narrative moments.\n\nThe ballet’s climax, which is the impassioned pas de deux danced by Tita and Pedro, however, represents Wheeldon’s best choreography in the ballet. During this pas de deux, there is the introduction of a song performed by soprano Kara Dugan, and ends with a scenic coup de theatre.\n\nMore than anything else an excellent cast brings Wheeldon’s vision, and Esquivel’s story, to life with fervent performances by Skylar Brandt as Tita, and Carlos Gonzlez as Pedro, and equally passionate and vividly fulfilled performances by Zhong-Jing Fang as Mama Elena, Betsy McBride as Rosaura, and Jarod Curley as the stoic Dr. John Brown. The dancers draw their characters not only in their dancing but also in the dramatic images that they create through their acting skills.\n\nCreating a narrative ballet on this scale with such a complicated and mystical tale to tell, has its challenges in making for a compelling and memorable ballet. Unfortunately, even on this second viewing, Like Water for Chocolate does not fulfill its ambitions. However it does make for an excellent showcase for the talents of American Ballet Theatre’s dancers.\n\nSmuin Contemporary Ballet\n\nJoyce Theater\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nThe Smuin Contemporary Ballet is based in the San Francisco Bay Area – where it performs and tours. Returning to perform at the Joyce Theater after an absence of about 20 years, the Smuin Contemporary Ballet is presenting a program of dance, from July 9-14, 2024, that represented choreographers whose primary artistic vision is contemporary ballet, and modern dance.\n\nNamed after the company’s founder, Michael Smuin, a choreographer and former artistic director of the San Francisco Ballet, the Smuin Contemporary Ballet was established to be a creative outlet for Smuin, and made its debut in San Francisco in 1994. Celia Fushille took over Smuin’s legacy in 2007, and added the works of other contemporary choreographers to the company’s repertoire. Later this year Fushille will be passing the torch of leadership to the Smuin Contemporary Ballet’s current associate artistic director, a choreographer in her own right, Amy Seiwert, who will take over the artistic direction of the company.\n\nFor this engagement by the Smuin Contemporary Ballet, in terms of repertoire, the references are a reflection of the company’s future rather than musing about its past as not one of Michael Smuin’s dance pieces was presented on this program. All three works presented on this program are New York premieres but the choreographers have had their works performed in New York frequently in the last few decades.\n\nVal Caniparoli was represented by Tutto Eccetto il Lavandino, choreographed to music by Vivaldi and which had premiered in 2014. With the title that can be simply be translated as “everything but the kitchen sink,” Caniparoli has created a 15-dancer ensemble work that keeps moving – and moving – Caniparoli transitions from one style of ballet to another. There were ensembles dances, duets, and solos in which the dancers were compelled to keep up a high-energy level throughout this dance piece – and in the end – sliding on to the stage was a kitchen sink – offering a bit of irony and self-deprecating humor.\n\nFollowing was a work choreographed by the company’s incoming artistic director, Amy Seiwert – Renaissance – with music by the Kitka Women’s Vocal Ensemble,\n\nWhat followed offered an important punctuation to this program, and that Seiwert’s dance piece had premiered in 2019. Seiwert’s choreographic response to this special brand of “sacred” and ritualistic music offered an obvious and odd flavor of ritualism.\n\nThe structure of the piece was threading together the recurring ensembles, solos, and duets, which were non-stop and also made Renaissance seemed like it had a similar choreographic blueprint as Caniparoli’s piece seen earlier in the program. Seiwert created a similar choreographic blueprint as Caniparoli had in his piece which was dancing with the speed of a demon with influences from distinguished masters of American modern dance. Renaissance was also an ensemble work although, in this instance, there was the couple of Terez Dean Orr and Tess Lane that possessed the distinctive dancing personalities to lead the cast.\n\nIn contrast was Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s recent work, Tupelo Tornado, which is inspired by the life of Elvis Presley. This “tribute” of sorts was choreographed to Presley’s recordings, snippets from documentaries, and a specially commissioned soundtrack, noting Presley’s drug use and his appropriation of the art of black recording artists. Tupelo Tornado was premiered in 2024, and had an ensemble cast led by Brandon Alexander as Elvis, who was more of a bystander than a participant in this piece.\n\nAs it might be with a non-American choreographing a piece like this, which is about a preeminent American icon, all seemed to be perplexing and out-of-place, with new choreography that didn’t even try to be a pastiche of dance styles that would be notable and identifiable to any audience member who would have been familiar with them during Presley’s Golden Age. Also in the costuming of Brandon Alexander mostly in Presley’s signature white jump suits – there was an odd use of a television set put over Alexander’s head. This added to the perplexing nature of Tupelo Tornado that contrasted with the reasons for Presley’s success – including his special connections with his audiences which made then die-hard fans for life, and his interpretation of both popular, and sacred songs.\n\nI would propose that Ochoa’s Tupelo Tornado might have had more of a s success if Ochoa had done more research on Presley’s life and his contributions to American culture before embarking on this project.\n\nThe artistic direction and philosophy of the Smuin Contemporary Ballet has changed, and I hope that the company will perform in New York again without long intervals getting in the way in order to appreciate where the next chapter of this company’ artistic legacy will be.\n\nAmerican Ballet Theatre – Romeo and Juliet\n\nMetropolitan Opera House\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nSince 1984, Kenneth MacMillan’s production of Romeo and Juliet has been part of American Ballet Theatre’s bread and butter repertoire – remaining popular for decades. Before American Ballet Theatre’s acquisition of the ballet MacMillan’s Romeo and Juliet was known to New York audiences by virtue of the frequent performances of this version of Romeo and Juliet danced by the Royal Ballet in the decades prior to 1985. It is fair to say that MacMillan’s Romeo and Juliet has become a very familiar ballet in American Ballet Theatre’s repertoire, and has now been presented in the last three of the company’s Metropolitan Opera House seasons. This season from July 9-13, 2024.\n\nMacMillan’s Romeo and Juliet was choreographed to the score composed by Serge Prokofiev in a grand opera house manner. Beautiful designs by Nicholas Georgiadis, and appropriately dramatic choreography that created splendid choreographic tableau, and dramatic vignettes to tell Shakespeare’s familiar, and tragic story.\n\nMacMillan, in his version, does include an added solo for Romeo to dance in the Act I Ballroom Scene. But for the most part he followed a similar blueprint and structure that have been embraced in other productions of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nAn added ingredient is that MacMillan effectively employs the darkness of Prokofiev’s score as a layering for his own dark interpretation of Shakespeare’s well-known tragedy.\n\nAt the July 10th’s evening performance the roles of the star-crossed lovers were danced by Isabella Boylston and Herman Cornejo, who are seasoned artists. Boylston employing every aspect of her dancing, and acting skills by infusing every bit of narrative choreography into her characterization of Juliet. Other details in her performance included recklessness, and passion rather than caution. Cornejo’s emphatic, and romantic nature of his interpretation of Romeo – and being a supportive partner to his Juliet – were exhibited in Cornejo’s mature artistry.\n\nJake Roxander as Mercutio, infused comedy and wit into the interpretation of his character, as well his pin perfect execution of the choreography. Roxander also brought those same attributes to the pre-Ball Pas de Trois which was danced by Roxander, Cornejo, and Luis Ribagorda as Benvolio. Also notable were Roman Zhurbin’s commanding performance as Tybalt, and Andrii Ishchuk’s subtle performance as Paris.\n\nWhen American Ballet Theatre performs Romeo and Juliet it is a company effort which was very much on display in this performance.\n\nAmerican Ballet Theatre – Swan Lake\n\nMetropolitan Opera House\n\nJuly 4, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nIn the third week of its Metropolitan Opera House season, American Ballet Theatre is dancing its current production of the 19th century classic ballet, Swan Lake – the current production staged by Kevin McKenzie with designs by Zack Brown – which has been danced by American Ballet Theatre since 2000. American Ballet Theatre continues to dance Swan Lake through this weekend, and it shouldn’t be missed as it is where the company as a whole puts its best foot forward.\n\nMcKenzie’s signature is all over his production of Swan Lake including the Prologue in which Von Rothbart transforms Odette into a swan, reordering of musical pieces, and combining the four acts of the ballet into two acts with only one intermission. But a great deal of Tchaikovsky’s glorious music is included in this production – a foundation for the story which is also in McKenzie’s generally traditional staging.\n\nBut any performance of Swan Lake is only as good as the principal dancers in the roles of Odette/Odile, and Siegfried which on July 4th were danced by Catherine Hurlin and James Whiteside.\n\nDancers who dance the dual role of Odette/Odile either let the choreography tell the story, or some use their dramatic skills. But Hurlin combined both qualities in her performance. Hurlin proved to be eloquent as the White Swan, but her technical and dramatic strengths were most evident in her Black Swan – particularly in the Black Swan Pas de Deux’s solo variation and coda – where she played with Tchaikovsky’s music a bit for dramatic effect, and offered her own pyrotechnics.\n\nJames Whiteside was a stalwart partner, and a boyish Siegfried whose strength was portraying Swan Lake’s plot’s twists and turns – and surprises – which allowed the audience to experience the story of Swan Lake through Siegfried’s eyes.\n\nTwo different dancers portrayed the role of the evil Von Rothbart in this production with the guardian of the lake Von Rothbart suitably portrayed by Cy Doherty, as compared to Andrii Ishchuk who portrays more malevolent aspects of Von Rothbart’s personality – particularly in the Ballroom Scene as Odile’s mentor, and his flirtations with the female guests at the ball.\n\nFangqi Li, Sunmi Park, and Carlos Gonzalez literally sparkled in the Act I Pas de Trois, and Luigi Crispino and Melvin Lawovi offered a special brand of male dancer virtuosity in the Neapolitan Dance – and ABT’s excellent corps de ballet supported this performance of Swan Lake admirably.\n\nNotably Swan Lake is the only 19th century classic ballet that American Ballet Theatre is presenting during its Metropolitan Opera House season, and there is little time to catch a performance before this week’s performances come to an end.\n\nAmerican Ballet Theatre – Woolf Works\n\nMetropolitan Opera House\n\nJune 27, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nWayne McGregor, recently knighted, is one of the Royal Ballet’s resident choreographers, and through his choreographic career his one-act works have been seen here in New York danced by his own company, domestic ballet companies and ballet companies from abroad. Those works have been choreographically influenced by Merce Cunningham and William Forsythe, and have their self-identification in terms of the music McGregor’s work is choreographed to, and its design. Recently McGregory has moved away from one-act pieces to full-length pieces with ideas that take up the width and breath of a large stage.\n\nMcGregor, like many choreographers today, is searching for a new structure in which to express narrative in a full-evening work. Yet at the same time McGregor focuses on grappling with abstract ideas. However with such a combination, an audience could be lost at sea without being familiar with the story that is being told.\n\nIn 2015 Mr. McGregor choreographed Woolf Works for the Royal Ballet, a full-length dance piece that was inspired by the novels, letters, essays and diaries of British writer Virginia Woolf – and her life – in collaboration with composer Max Richter. McGregor is credited with the concept, direction and choreography for Woolf Works, with assistance from dramaturg, Uzma Hameed.\n\nWoolf Works has now been acquired by American Ballet Theatre which gave Woolf Works its company premiere in California earlier this year, and is now being performed by American Ballet Theatre at the Metropolitan Opera House in its New York premiere from June 25-29, 2024.\n\nWoolf was among the foremost proponents of the narrative device of stream of consciousness – which in a sense McGregor is also evoking in his choreography in Woolf Works. Woolf is best known as a respected member of a group of writers called the Bloomsbury Group, and just as much for what was considered an unconventional personal life.\n\nThis 3-act full-length dance piece leads off in the first act titled “I now, I then” inspired by Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway, where in this performance, Hee Seo played the roles of Virginia Woolf herself, and also of the Older Clarissa Dalloway in the novel with its plot taking up the time and space of 24 hours with parallel stories about a society hostess preparing for a party, and a war veteran, Septimus Smith (danced by Calvin Royal III), being given a psychiatric examination, and diagnosis.\n\n“I now, I then” is the most conventional of the three acts of Woolf Works which has portrayals of characters from Mrs. Dalloway, among them, Richard (danced by Corey Stearns), Young Clarissa (danced by Fangqi Li), Peter (danced by Aran Bell), Sally (danced by Skylar Brandt), Rezia (danced by Breanne Granlund), and Evans (danced by Patrick Frenette). However these characters are not given choreographic leitmotivs, and even in the minimal references in terms of costuming fail to identify the conflicts and relationships between these characters. Most notably the stage is dominated by three moving frames which create more obstacles in knowing the characters, and their motivations, as the dancers hide behind them, and re-appear with no apparent effect.\n\nWoolf’s Works’ second act is “Becoming,” based on Woolf’s novel, Orlando. The novel has an ageless hero that has a reference to changes of gender. But in “Becoming” McGregor goes for the totally abstract dance motif, where at this performance, a group of dancers led by Isabella Boylston and Skylar Brandt, appear first in period costumes – and those references to period are stripped away in a fast-moving plotless dance piece. McGregor’s abstract interpretation lends towards ambiguity, and no plot points.\n\nThe third and final act of Woolf’s Works, “Tuesday,” is based on Woolf’s novel The Waves, which opens with a recording of Gillian Anderson reading Woolf’s suicide note – in so doing fueling Woolf’s fear of madness. Woolf looks back on her life to some degree before coming to terms with her inability to cope with life. The only significant piece of choreography is in pas de deux danced by Seo and Bell – and ultimately Woolf succumbs to the unpredictable nature of the images of the waves and movement of water in the river Ouse.\n\nWoolf Works is a complicated and confounding dance piece – and also haunting and ghostly which is appropriate for the themes of Woolf’s novels.\n\nHowever the lack of narrative, and the McGregor’s repetitive choreography results in obscurity and not clarity – and in visualizing a story in dance, choreography, and design should be combining to illuminating the story rather than obscuring it.\n\nAlthough American Ballet Theatre’s dancers make a commitment and present an earnestness in reflecting McGregor’s vision, it would take much more for Woolf Works to be the satisfying work it could have been.\n\nAmerican Ballet Theatre – Onegin\n\nMetropolitan Opera House\n\nJune 20, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nAmerican Ballet Theatre has opened its summer season at the Metropolitan Opera House with a revival of John Cranko’s Onegin, which was given its company premiere in 2001 — a ballet missing from the company’s repertoire for about 7 years.\n\nCranko is mostly known on American shores as the artistic director of the Stuttgart Ballet which provided Cranko with an atmosphere for his creative process. American Ballet Theatre has not taken many of Cranko’s works into its repertoire, but Onegin seems to be the Cranko ballet that has staying power with American Ballet Theatre audiences.\n\nOnegin was created for the Stuttgart Ballet first in its original version in 1965, and then fully revised in 1967. Cranko used the source of Alexander Pushkin’s narrative poem of the same name which had also inspired Tchaikovsky’s opera. However Cranko chose to use little known pieces of Tchaikovsky’s music for the score of this ballet version of Onegin which was expertly orchestrated by Kurt-Heinz Stolze. In so doing it sounds like the score was especially composed for this ballet.\n\nThe story focuses on Eugene Onegin, an arrogant and self-involved man, who is visiting the Russian country side with a friend, Lensky, a poet. As Tatiana notes in her letter to Onegin she questions why Onegin would want to visit what is described as a “backwoods habitation.” But the reason for the visit to the Larina Estate is that Lensky is engaged to the family’s younger daughter, Olga, However it is Olga’s older sister, Tatiana, who is attracted to this odd, and sophisticated man.\n\nTatiana amuses herself with romance novels, and she imagines a youthful infatuation for Onegin. Tatiana writes a “love letter” to Onegin, and Onegin’s first reaction was rejecting Tatiana’s affection, and then flirts with Olga, encouraging the jealously of Lensky. That breach of honor escalates to the point of Lensky challenging Onegin to a duel which results in Lensky’s death.\n\nMany years later Onegin has been invited to Prince Gremin’s home, and is introduced to a grown-up Tatiana who is now Prince Gremin’s wife. Onegin has flashbacks to the past when he reacted negatively to Tatiana’s attentions, his duel with Lensky – all with regret — and attempts to win over Tatiana with his unrequited love all these years later. Whether in disgust or simply being empowered to make her own choices, Tatiana rejects Onegin.\n\nIn telling this story Cranko used concise gesture and choreography that moves the narrative forward at a quick pace in the space of three acts. Even in the ensemble dances plot points are revealed – and Cranko also imbues his choreography with the direction that one would aim for by a director of a play.\n\nThere are moments of high emotions in the story that are conveyed with equivalent emotional choreography, and humanity which are also underscored in the arrangement of Tchaikovsky’s music. Perhaps the most moving moments are in the Mirror/Letter Pas de Deux at the end of Act I, and Act III’s concluding Pas de Deux, both duets dance by Tatiana and Onegin, which provide the passionate and emotional climaxes in the ballet.\n\nAs ABT has not performed Onegin in about seven years, there are many dancers making their debuts in the principal roles. The performance on June 20th, 2024 featured such a debut cast.\n\nYoung soloist, Chloe Misseldine danced the role of Tatiana showing artistic maturity as she expressed child-like qualities and evolved into a mature woman, while Thomas Forster danced the title role portraying Onegin as cold, moody, and calculating which made his desperate expression of love for Tatiana that much more effective. Aran Bell danced the role of Lensky with lightness and airiness, and besotted with love for Olga. Catherine Hurlin danced the role of Olga as a bit of a flirt and the feeling that all was right with the world until tragedy struck. Jarold Curley brought a great deal of regalness and maturity to the role of Prince Gremin which could potentially seem like cipher in this grand opera dramatic ballet.\n\nFor these performances American Ballet Theatre is employing the sumptuous costumes and scenery by Santo Loquasto that had been designed for the National Ballet of Canada’s production of Onegin.\n\nUnfortunately the American Ballet Theatre’s Metropolitan Opera House season is only offering 7 performances of Onegin. This was a performance of here and now by the cast that danced it, and I hope there will be the opportunity for this cast, and other casts to grow in their roles in Onegin in the future.\n\nAppraisal\n\n59E59 Theaters\n\nJune 14, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nThe 59E59 Theaters is now presenting another provocative play as part of its Brits Off-Broadway. From June 12-30, 2024, being presented is Tim Marriott’s two-hander, Appraisal in which Marriott co-stars with Alex Sunderhaus.\n\nWith the sponsorship of the Twilight Theatre Company and Smokescreen Productions, Appraisal offers a comic and witty sparring match which focuses on the uncomfortable situation all of us have experienced at some time in our lives when our employers evaluate our work performance – and in Appraisal there is a comic side and also a dark side.\n\nAppraisal opens with Jo (played by Tim Marriott), a department head, practicing his golf strokes, and seems under prepared and flummoxed when Nicky (played by Alex Sunderhaus) arrives. Nicky being a middle management employee who is to be given her yearly review. After the niceties of tea being offered – and actually also alcohol – the conversation tends to move in the direction of an alphabet soup of business and analytical terms for evaluating an employee’s performance while the personal relationships of both Jo and Nicky, inuendo, gossip, and then Jo exercising his authority becomes combustible until the review becomes more supercharged.\n\nWhat would seem to be a routine conversation in an office setting becomes far more complicated as Jo is trying to leverage Nicky out of her job to make room for a favorite employee. This process is also colored with charges of crossing the line between business and personal in their interactions – and sexism that exists in the work place. Confrontational it is!\n\nThe question then becomes who is reviewing the other in terms of this annual review as Jo and Nicky switch back and forth between positions of power, and being more subservient – and then there is the surprise ending, and the question is who has the most leverage over who!\n\nTim Marriott and Alex Sunderhaus aim their barbs and arrows with split-second precision, with director Margarett Perry keeping focus on the verbal tennis game that is occurring. In the short time space of an hour all is revealed – although there is the uncertainty of what will happen after the play-ending surprise.\n\nAppraisal reflects the workplace of today with its systemic problems that come up between employer and employee – and in this case makes for an absorbing and cheeky angle on these relationships while also being a stimulating theatre entertainment.\n\nCranko – The Man and His Choreography\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nPublished by Matador, Cranko – The Man and His Choreography by Ashley Killar, examines and honors the choreographic career of John Cranko – a choreographer and his dance works perhaps somewhat loosing visibility as the decades go by and since Cranko’s passing in 1973 – in what was a short life and an even shorter span of his life as a choreographer.\n\nIn John Percival’s biography of John Cranko, “Theater in My Blood,” Cranko’s personal life was the focus, but Killar’s monograph reveals more biographical, and historical information, and also examinations of Cranko’s exemplary works from the point of a view of a dancer – and also a choreographer himself.\n\nKillar danced with the Stuttgart Ballet from 1962 through 1967 and thereafter pursued his dancing career with Western Theater Ballet and the Sadlers Wells Royal Ballet. When Killar was associated with the Stuttgart Ballet, this was a pivotal point in Cranko’s career, and he was able to observe Cranko at work, and in the creative process. Besides writing this monograph with his unique observations also included are photos and letters that are interwoven into the narrative of Cranko’s personal and artistic life. Also there is the added bonus of a detailed catalogue of Cranko’s works\n\nCranko was born in South Africa and received his early training there before pursuing his dance career in Great Britain. He arrived in London in 1946, and became associated with the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet. During the time he was working with the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet, Cranko had the opportunity to observe Frederick Ashton as a choreographer, and also choreographed opera ballets. Ninette de Valois wanted to develop choreographers from within the company. Cranko was one of three anointed protegees – the others were Kenneth MacMillan and Peter Darrell. However reviews and arbitrary choices had impact on them being in and out of favor with the ballet’s management, and ultimately perceived by Frederick Ashton as threats to his own position at what became the Royal Ballet.\n\nShortly after arriving in London had significant choreographic commissions including The Witch choreographed for the New York City Ballet in 1950 – which was premiered at the Royal Opera House. In fact Killar’s book reveals that George Balanchine was Cranko’s idol and that he had a great influence on the choreography that Cranko created.\n\nOther significant creations were Pineapple Poll in 1951, and The Lady the Fool in 1954 both created for the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet. Just as prestigious was Cranko creating the choreography for La Belle Helene at the Paris Opera in 1954, and creating the musical revue, Cranks, in 1955 which Cranko wrote and choreographed – a revue that also toured Great Britain, and was transferred to Broadway. And in 1958, a not well received musical, Keep Your Hair On!\n\nIn development over a period of years was Cranko’s major commission, the full-length ballet Prince of the Pagodas, based on a story inspired by The Sleeping Beauty, with a commissioned score by Benjamin Britten, and finally had its Royal Ballet world premiere in 1957. Although receiving a mixed reception, the ballet was performed during an American tour, and was acquired by La Scala and the Stuttgart Ballet. Ironically it was this commission that led him to the directorship of the Stuttgart Ballet.\n\nA cryptic statement made by Cranko about his relationship with Ninette de Valois was that “Someone has to build a bicycle. Ninette built one and lots of us tried to ride it. Some stayed on, some fell off.” It was Killar’s interpretation that perhaps Cranko meant that he wobbled and had fallen off – and in so doing he fell out of favor with de Valois, and was encouraged to move on from the Royal Ballet.\n\nCranko had a negative experience in an interview with The Stage and his negative comments about the Royal Ballet resulted in hurting his reputation and no work was offered from the Royal Ballet in 1958. However in that same year he was invited to create a Romeo and Juliet for La Scala with Carla Fracci as Juliet, and Cat’s Cradle for the International Ballet of the Marquis de Cuevas.\n\nIn 1959 Cranko was arrested for homosexual soliciting and the story hit the major newspapers. Yet he also created Antigone for the Royal Ballet that same year, and a dance version of Sweeney Todd with music by Malcolm Arnold that was created for the Royal Ballet Touring Company.\n\nCranko also followed up on his revue, Cranks, with New Cranks, and what proved to be a rocky road as director for the world premiere of Benjamin Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream in Aldeburgh – but not being a success he wasn’t engaged to be the director of the Royal Opera premiere of this opera.\n\nAlthough Cranko continued to be the Royal Ballet’s resident choreographer through 1960, the Royal Ballet’s lack of interest in commissioning work from him was influenced by the negative reaction to his dance pieces, and his arrest.\n\nIt was in 1960 that Cranko received the offer from the Stuttgart Ballet’s artistic director Nicholas Beriosov to restage his Prince of the Pagodas for the company. After the company premiere of Prince of the Pagodas, the general director of the Wurttenberg State Theatre, Walter Erich Schafer offered Cranko the directorship of the opera house’s ballet company resulting in the uncomfortable circumstance that Cranko was asked to replace Beriosov, who invited him to stage his major work for the Stuttgart Ballet.\n\nCranko served as artistic director of the Stuttgart Ballet from 1962, where he also served as choreographer, until his death in 1973. A short amount of time for any choreographer to make his mark in the dance world, but Cranko managed to do just that.\n\nIn Stuttgart, Cranko had his challenges in raising the standard of the dancers but according to Killar he didn’t have the inclinations of a teacher and his focus was on organization, and his own choreography – at a difficult time in Germany when it was still divided between East and West during the Cold War.\n\nCranko’s production of Romeo and Juliet was based on his production that he created for La Scala employing only 35 dancers – and by utilizing clever designs by Jurgen Rose, choreography and a feel for underlying aggression, this proved to be a major success.\n\nCranko also commissioned new works from Kenneth MacMillan – most notably, Song of the Earth, and Cranko created his own versions of Daphnis Chloe and the Firebird – and also added George Balanchine’s Apollo and La Valse to the company’s repertoire. There was also Cranko’s reinterpretation of The Nutcracker in 1966 which made only a few references to its original source, and was structured in three acts. It was described by those who had seen it as rather grim, and didn’t last long in the repertoire.\n\nIn his narrative ballets Cranko used minimum gesture and florid choreography in order to tell his stories. However the development of Cranko’s most notable work, Onegin, had a story of its own. Based on Pushkin’s narrative poem, this was an idea that Cranko had proposed to the Royal Ballet not once but twice. When he promoted Onegin to the Royal Ballet for the second time Cranko pitched the ballet as a star vehicle for Rudolf Nureyev in the title role with Antoinette Sibley as Olga and Anthony Dowell as Lensky.\n\nHowever it wasn’t until he became artistic director of the Stuttgart Ballet did this project reach fruition although Cranko continued to make revisions in his version of Onegin after its premiere in 1965 through 1967. With an orchestrated score by Kurt-Heinz Stolze compromising mostly minor Tchaikovsky works, and Jurgen Rose’s evocative designs, all came together for a unique dance experience – and has proved to be a standard work in the repertoires of many ballet companies all over the world.\n\nHowever Cranko felt restricted in his role at the Stuttgart Ballet, and in an effort to keep him in Stuttgart, an arrangement was developed for him to be artistic director at the Bavarian State Opera Ballet in Munich becoming Chief Choreographer in 1967 while also retaining his position as artistic director of the Stuttgart Ballet.\n\nThis latter development was also a reflection of politics in the German dance world, and also the dance world in Great Britain. Kenneth MacMillan became another defector from the Royal Ballet when he became the artistic director of the Berlin State Opera Ballet, and during his regime he was visited by the Royal Opera House’s David Webster, who promised him the directorship of the Royal Ballet succeeding Frederick Ashton. Cranko had ambitions for that same position and perhaps after his success in Stuttgart felt he deserved the opportunity. But now the door was closed to him.\n\nAnother one of Cranko’s full-length ballets was The Taming of the Shrew based on Shakespeare’s play – and at that time there were few, if any, dance versions of Shrew. Cranko conceived the ballet as a comic ballet but had to find a way to override its misogynistic tone. The verbal sparring in Shakespeare’s play was translated into the choreography as physical comedy. In the end Petruchio and Kate earn each other’s trust as the basis of their relationship. It has also been suggested that Cranko found his inspiration in Cole Porter’s musical version of Shrew, Kiss Me Kate – but as attitudes about misogyny have developed into the 21st century, this ballet has virtually disappeared from ballet companies’ repertoires.\n\nAlso during this period of time Cranko created the plotless Brouillards, and Poeme de l’Extase as a vehicle for Margot Fonteyn – which was later danced by the Royal Ballet. However at the same time the friendship between Cranko and MacMillan was tested in the development of MacMillan’s new ballet for the Stuttgart Ballet, Miss Julie, over design costs – also Cranko loosened his ties with the Bavarian State Opera Ballet.\n\nTowards the end of his life further creations included a 70-minute version of Carmen created for the demands for repertoire for American tours, Initials R.B.M.E. (a tribute to his closest dancers Richard Cragun, Birgit Keil, Marcia Haydee and Egon Madsen), Traces, and Song of My People for the Batsheva Dance Company.\n\nThe Stuttgart Ballet was offered touring engagements, and while performing in Vienna in 1966, Martin Feinstein of Hurok Concerts attended performances, and the American debut of the company took place three years later. The Stuttgart Ballet heralded Cranko’s work on the global stage in extensive American tours for what were regular visits to the major capital cities in North America – at least until 1979 – and thereafter more sporadically. However through those tours Cranko’s achievements were recognized.\n\nCranko died in 1973 on a flight from Philadelphia to Stuttgart. There was speculation about suicide being the cause of his death but the coroner’s verdict was that Cranko’s death was accidental caused by a mild drug to assist in sleeping.\n\nAlthough Cranko’s full-length ballets, Romeo and Juliet, and Onegin are frequently performed by ballet companies all over the world, the one-act story ballets and contemporary ballets are rarely performed these days. All of these works have their charm, and challenges for the dancers, but also represent Cranko’s unique approach to choreography and his emphasis on story-telling.\n\nNot to be forgotten is Cranko’s contribution to the development of a new approaches in creating story ballets, and Killar’s Cranko: The Man and His Choreography strengthens that legacy.\n\nCity Center Encores – Titanic\n\nCity Center\n\nJune 15, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nFor its last presentation of the season City Center Encores has produced a concert version of the musical, Titanic, which had premiered on Broadway in 1997, and won the Tony Award for Best Musical. As conceived by composer/lyricist Maury Yeston, and librettist Peter Stone, this epic story was told with massive scenery and a large cast in its Broadway debut which would make it economically impossible for it be performed on Broadway in this day and age.\n\nCity Center Encores, in a concert adaptation directed by Anne Kauffman, has focused on Titanic’s essentials in this presentation – nearly all sung-through and operatic in its scope. The large cast of 32 plus 30 musicians in the orchestra, under the expert and masterful guidance of Rob Berman, playing Jonathan Tunick’s magnificent original orchestrations underlined Titanic’s grand proportions. This concert adaptation of Titanic is a stunning, and compelling success.\n\nYeston has focused on the British side of this disaster, and has researched the lives of some of the people who perished and those who survived when the Titanic hit an iceberg in the Atlantic in 1912. In so doing he has infused a great deal of humanity into his telling of this larger-than-life story – and attention-grabbing disaster – the sinking of the “ship of dreams,” an enormous accomplishment of human and scientific ingenuity that ended in disaster when the hubris, recklessness, and arrogance of the ship owner, the designer of the ship, and the captain of the ship took over, and couldn’t avoid what would be an inevitable tragedy. Forces were at play that would destroy the ship – speed, visibility, and ice. With 1,178 passengers on board the Titanic, there weren’t enough lifeboats to save all of those passengers – and the musicians played on until the Titanic sunk.\n\nBut Titanic’s passengers – in all classes – perceived a voyage on the Titanic as the early 20th century equivalent of taking a space ship to the moon – and along with them they took their hopes, dreams, and optimism to make better lives for themselves.\n\nEgged on by the competing Cunard Line on the same transatlantic route, the White Star Line’s owner, J. Bruce Ismay (played by Brandon Uranowitz) pushes Captain Smith (played by Chuck Cooper) to increase the Titanic’s speed so that the Titanic could make the voyage 1 day sooner. However at the end of Act I, the Titanic hits an iceberg, which begins the uncertainty, and the ultimate tragedy of the Titanic’s maiden voyage.\n\nIn the course of Act II, passengers come to terms with their fate – and those saved by the Carpathia, think about what if different decisions could have been made – Titanic might have lived up to its reputation as a “ship of dreams.”\n\nBut as Captain Smith stated, it’s only God who sinks ships.\n\nThrough the course of Titanic we meet the passengers — several of which reveal themselves in haunting songs. Most notably stoker Frederick Barrett (played by Ramin Karimloo), with radio man, Harold Bride (played by Alex Joseph Grayson), who wants to send a telegram to his waiting girlfriend back in England with the promise of marriage when he returns home in “The Proposal/The Night Was Alive”, and the farewell of Ida Straus (played by Judy Kuhn) and Isidore Straus (played by Chip Zien) who sing the showstopper “Still” – and also the opening of Titanic with the company singing the Titanic’s praises in “Ship of Dreams”.\n\nThe score has influences from the musical style of Edward Elgar which lends an authenticity to the period in which the story unfolds. And in this production of Titanic, the focus is on Yeston’s magnificent score, and the representation of people on the ship from all economic classes – each song is a story unto itself — some expressing optimism, some regret, and some foretelling of the tragedy yet to come.\n\nThe optimism is expressed by passengers and onlookers singing “Godspeed Titanic” and in “We’ll Meet Tomorrow,” especially haunting and ironic when the passengers are coming to terms with their fate.\n\nThe City Center Encores cast is an embarrassment of riches from the portrayals of the smallest parts to the principal parts. Notable were Bonnie Milligan, with superlative comic timing, playing Alice Beane, a social climber wanting to experience what the upper classes do on the ship – supported by her passive and frustrated husband Edgar played empathetically by Drew Gehling — and Brandon Uranowitz as J. Bruce Ismay, in a sense the villain of the piece, who is among the survivors.\n\nThen there are the Irish Kates seeking better lives in the States with Samantha Williams expressing her desires to be a lady’s maid in America – with Lilli Cooper and Ashley Blanchet.\n\nHowever the performances of Ramon Karimloo as Frederick Barrett, Judy Kuhn and Chip Zien as the Strauses, and Chuck Cooper as the stalwart Captain Smith were the anchors in this remarkable and emotional story of tragedy, and disappointment.\n\nAlso plaudits to director Anne Kauffman whose simple and light touch allowed the music and the text to tell the story which emphasized the poignancy and ironic nature of the tragedy that has embraced the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nIf you haven’t planned to see the City Center Encores production of Titanic there is still a week of performances left – an experience of a life time to see this brilliant and impressive musical.\n\n&Juliet – A Second Visit\n\nStephen Sondheim Theatre\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nThe enjoyment of revisiting a play or a musical for a second or multiple times is having the opportunity not only to revisit the play or musical, but also to see new actors portraying pivotal roles – and what they bring to the roles. Replacements and understudies add dimension to these plays and musicals if they have extended engagements.\n\n&Juliet, which opened in November 2022, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, continues to be re-charged during its Broadway engagement with new cast members. With a score comprised of jukebox material by Max Martin, and a book by David West Red, who provides the winning comic lines and wit, &Juliet remains the entertaining, and witty musical that it has been at a time when Broadway is a bit crowded with new musicals.\n\nThe premise of &Juliet is what would happen if Juliet decided to make a different choice, and did not choose the same fate as her beloved Romeo. What would life be for Juliet had she decided to take control of her life.\n\nIn &Juliet, William Shakespeare’s wife, Anne Hathaway (played by Betsy Wolfe) persuades her husband, William Shakespeare (played by Oliver Tompsett) to take over the storytelling in his planned new play, Romeo and Juliet – and Anne Hathaway sets Juliet on a different course in her life.\n\nJuliet, facing the grief of losing her husband, and her parents demanding that she be sent off to a nunnery, is given the choice of deciding what her life could be – making her own choices. With the support of her Nurse, Angelique, (played by understudy Megan Kane), her new found friend in Anna Hathaway, and May (played by Justin David Sullivan) – and with Shakespeare as the carriage driver – Juliet sets off for Paris to find her future adventures where she also meets a whole crew of interesting characters.\n\nIn the course of their travels Shakespeare and Hathaway spar as they re-invent the story of Romeo and Juliet – from a woman’s point of view.\n\nIn Paris Juliet befriends Francois (played by understudy Makai Hernandez), who is being pressured by his father Lance (played by David Bedella) to get married. It is Lance who is hopeful that Francois will find a suitable wife at the Renaissance Ball. Although Francois finds Juliet at the Ball and they enter into an engagement – Francois also meets May – and they instantly click as well.\n\nTo complicate matters Lane and Angelique, who were romantically linked in the past, rekindle their relationship, and there is the surprise of an important person in Juliet’s past who also reappears to add to the complications.\n\nHowever Juliet realizes that she has settled on another relationship that is a bit reckless and without much thought.\n\nTo justify the many twists and turns in the story Anne Hathaway reminds William Shakespeare of Shakespeare’s plays in which men are dressed as women, women are dressed as men, and there are also mistaken gender identities – and mistaken tragedies.\n\nBut in incorporating the ingredients of love and mutual respect, Hathaway and Shakespeare can also explore a new chapter in their own relationship.\n\nThe story is told cleverly by David West Read with the insightful inclusion of Max Martins’ song catalogue with Luke Sheppard’s direction peppered with wit and perfect comic timing.\n\n&Juliet remains as spontaneous and entertaining as when it premiered on Broadway with the outstanding performances of a new Juliet, Maya Boyd, and a new Lance, David Bedella, and a new William Shakespeare, Oliver Tompsett – the latter two having essayed these same roles in the London production of &Juliet – the mainstay performances of original cast members, Betsy Wolfe as Anne Hathaway, and Justin David Sullivan as May – the additional energy of understudies, Megan Kane as Angelique, and Makai Hernandez as Francois – and original cast member, Ben Jackson Walker as Romeo who mysteriously reappears.\n\nEven if you have already seen and experienced &Juliet, it is worth a second visit if for nothing else to enjoy the performances of original cast members and the newbies in the cast who together create a high energy alchemy.\n\nWatson The Final Problem\n\n59E59 Theaters\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nThe heroes of action movies and solvers of mysteries often have sidekicks – some remembered and some forgotten. Watson The Final Problem, a solo play written by Bert Coules and Tim Marriott, takes up the task of putting the spotlight on the famous sidekick of a famous and infamous mystery detective, Sherlock Holmes – and that is Dr. John H. Watson, who offered scientific insight into the mysteries that Holmes solved.\n\nGiven its American premiere as part of the 59E59 Theaters’ Brits Off Broadway, the Twilight Theatre Company’s Watson The Final Problem is directed with surgical precision by Bert Coules, and portrayed with equal precision and sensitivity by Tim Marriott.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle’s short story, The Final Problem, was to be Doyle’s last mystery novel in which Holmes was the protagonist. However public outcry changed his mind – but one problem — Holmes met his maker at the end of the story, and Doyle had to resurrect him.\n\nIn Watson The Final Problem, the intrepid Dr. Watson is living in London circa 1894 three years after Holmes seemed to have plummeted to his death in the icy and treacherous waters of the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland – along with Holmes’ nemesis Dr. Morarity – and their bodies could not be recovered. Watson returns to London in the aftermath of this tragedy, and now in flashbacks, Watson tells the tales of his adventures with Holmes, the death of Watson’s wife, Mary, and the pursuit of Holmes’ enemy Dr. Morarity.\n\nA much younger Watson describes his return to London after his military service in Afghanistan to find his life quite at a loss until he has an unexpected meeting with a former colleague who happens to have a friend who needs someone to share his lodgings. That “friend” is revealed to be Sherlock Holmes striking up a life-long friendship, and experiencing a multitude of crime-solving adventures.\n\nWatson is caught up with Holmes’ cases, and Holmes’ constant battle with his criminal nemesis – Dr. Moriarty – the most notorious criminal in Europe. Watson is guilt ridden about Holmes’ mysterious demise in Switzerland because he felt partially responsible for leaving him alone at the Reichenbach Falls when he was surreptitiously called back to the local hotel to treat a sick hotel guest – which proved to be fraudulent, and set up by Dr. Moriarity.\n\nThe death of Watson’s wife, Mary, also adds to the grief that Watson is experiencing. Two of the most important people in his life are now gone – but Watson also wanted to refute the many false reports, rumors, and gossip that continue to harm his reputation.\n\nHolmes always warned to expect the unexpected which reflects the cliffhanger ending of Watson The Final Problem – with an unexpected knock on the door.\n\nWhether you are or not a Sherlock Holmes aficionado, or you are curious as to what happened to Holmes and Watson, you will be entertained and mystified by Watson The Final Problem, and how well Tim Marriott brings to life the quixotic fictional character that Dr. John H. Watson seems to be.\n\nChopped Liver & Unions\n\n59E59 Theaters\n\nMay 25, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nThe 59E59 Theaters’ Brits Off Broadway, through a presentation by the Blue Theatre Co., offered another lesson in history, and a multifaceted performance by an actor in J.J. Leppink’s Chopped Liver & Unions, a biographical mini-play with music focusing on Sara Wesker, a London-born trade union activist at a tumultuous time in British history during the 1920’s through the 1930’s. An age in Great Britain that has now caught the attention of many British historians.\n\nWesker grew up in London, and became an activist in the trade union movement, and organizing female garment workers. During strikes Wesker had the idea of the women workers singing “strike songs” as a means of raising money and awareness as the strikes were not recognized by the leadership of the unions.\n\nIn London the primary factory workers were women – coming from Jewish families, and Irish migrant families who lived and worked in the Hackney section of London. Some of these women had associations with trade unions, and would receive support from those unions during disputes which focused on the bread-and-butter issues of wages, work hours, and especially working conditions. The play reflected the usual platitudes about women – and women in the work force during that time period — and also the dignity of the workers. There was enough information and facts in Chopped Liver & Unions that revealed how extraordinary these women were.\n\nSam Elsbury and Sara Wesker were both officials of the NUTGW in Hackney, and they led a strike in 1928 against the owners of Rego Clothiers – the dispute related to a relocation of the factory. In response to new working conditions and other related hardships, 600 workers in the clothing factory participated in a 12-week strike.\n\nUltimately Wesker’s union work resulted in being elected to Great Britain’s Communist Party’s Central Committee, expressing a philosophy that Wesker believed in but did not result in fruition.\n\nWesker also took part in the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936, a clash in East London – with a large Jewish population – that was between the Metropolitan Police protecting a march by members of Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, and demonstrators with competing interests which included trade unionists, Communists, anarchists, British Jews, and socialist groups.\n\nIt should also be noted that Wesker’s nephew, Arnold Wesker became a noted playwright, and in Chopped Liver & Unions, Sara Wesker mentioned that her nephew included remembrances of her, and the Wesker family in his plays.\n\nSara Wesker was an extraordinary woman among extraordinary women, and having passed on in 1971, she lived to see some of the goals she worked for – achieved.\n\nIn Chopped Liver & Unions, Wesker, as portrayed by Lottie Walker, tells her story through her own political lense, and also through the “strike songs” that were sung by the strikers – and strike supporters – through words and music. Walker’s performance told Wesker’s story with great wit, charm, and humanity which was guided by Laura Killeen’s keen direction.\n\nAlthough a great deal of obscure British history is the core of Chopped Liver & Unions, the play is not a history lesson – but a lesson reminding us all that history repeats itself making it very relevant to the present time. The intimacy of the production of Chopped Liver & Unions was the equivalent of having Wesker sitting with you in a living room and engaging in a conversation with her listeners – and there is a great story to be told.\n\nAt the same time Chopped Liver & Unions is an engrossing and involving theatrical experience.\n\nJust Another Day\n\nTheatre555\n\nMay 11, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nRare it is for an actor to attempt writing a play much less starring in it as well. However that is what is the challenge facing actor Dan Lauria (known for being a star of the television series, The Wonder Years) who has written a new play, Just Another Day, and is also starring in it, at Theater555 in a limited engagement through June 30, 2024.\n\nJust Another Day, co-starring Patty McCormack, is a two-hander about a comedy writer and poet in their seventies who form an acquaintanceship, and meet daily at a park bench to exchange their thoughts on what they see in the park – with the particular agenda of discussing the subject matter of old movies – and also realizing that they have a stronger bond than just an acquaintanceship – at least on the days that they get together – and during the time they spend together.\n\nAnd setting the scene is Graham Russell’s especially composed song that opens Just Another Day and the projections of highlights of the movies that are mentioned and quoted.\n\nHowever is this acquaintanceship merely an acquaintanceship? Do these two people, only identified as a Man and a Woman, know each other well or don’t they? Revealed through the course of Just Another Day is that these two characters have a remarkable command for remembering dialogue from their favorite movies, and also examining the universal truths in those dialogues. However is there more, and who is that bellringer who seems to interrupt these conversations.\n\nIt is ultimately revealed that these two characters are patients at a nursing home, beginning to suffer from dementia, who began their friendship in the home’s garden. In their conversations they recollect their former lives which they have had difficulty in remembering. However the bellringer is their nurse who beckons them back to the nursing home at various times of the day – somewhat intimidating, and reminding these two patients where they are.\n\nConversations run the gamut to the aforementioned movies to famous comedy routines, and creating one of their own. One of those creations was a parody of the television show, “You Are There,” which is “You Should Have Been There,” in which the pivotal character is Vito Bel Duce, who is God’s Special Effects Man.\n\nBut in all these instances the characters are taking their limitations in stride, and it is not maudlin. You feel like these characters are pondering rather than trying to hark back to their previous lives which is difficult for them to recall.\n\nWhat is most important is that you are watching two acting pros acting their hearts out – and watching them is an acting master class – as they tell so well the bitter sweet and effecting story that Lauria has written in play form.\n\nDirector Eric Krebs has helped these two fine actors to find their characters and how to portray them – and then let the story-telling begin and unfold. In short you can’t get anything better than this as a theatrical experience – and it is worth exploring off-Broadway to get acquainted with these smart, and what seem to be ordinary characters – and played so genially and perfectly by Dan Lauria and Patty McCormack.\n\nThe Brief Life & Mysterious Death of Boris III,\n\nKing of Bulgaria\n\n59E59 Theaters\n\nMay 5, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nAs part of the 59E59 Theaters’ Brits Off Broadway, another unique piece of British theatre has reached our shores, the Out of the Forest Theatre’s production of The Brief Life & Mysterious Death of Boris III, King of Bulgaria, co-authored by Sasha Wilson and Joseph Cullen, who both have pivotal roles in the performance of the play.\n\nBack in the 19th century when many of the European nations were finding their identities and mapping out their territories, they were ruled by absolute monarchs. However some of the royal lines of these countries died out or royal families abdicated, and the countries sought out princes from an alternate royal line to take over the existing monarchy. Many of those royal candidates came from the ruling families of Denmark and Germany – whichever had a spare prince around with not much to do – would be suitably appropriate.\n\nBulgaria was one of those countries, and found itself being ruled by the German princely line of the House of Saxe-Coburg Gotha that even had connections to Queen Victoria – who seemed to be connected to every Royal House in Europe.\n\nDepicted in The Brief Life & Mysterious Death of Boris III, King of Bulgaria, is Boris III (played by Joseph Cullen) who assumed the throne of Bulgaria in 1918 and was ultimately caught up in the Nazi invasion of Europe that evolved into World War II. Either being hapless or very cunning – or sometimes circumspect, and sometimes baffling and confused, King Boris III is portrayed of having prevented the Nazis from deporting all of Bulgaria’s Jewish population to concentration camps, facing many moral choices, and norms until his suspicious death after meeting with Adolf Hitler in 1943.\n\nDuring the World War II years King Boris III played along with the Nazi games, bluffing antisemitism and loyalty to the Nazis, but as depicted in this play he managed to confront the major and awkward choices he had to make regarding compromise and appeasement, and also wanting to restore foreign territory back to Bulgaria.\n\nIn Great Britain and in other parts of Europe dictatorial predators are mocked in theatrical presentations rather than revered or feared as a method of ridiculing these creatures. Wilson and Cullen do absolutely that in this play when it comes to the expanding power of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi cohorts with Cullen playing King Boris III as if he is falling apart in a farce – yet manages to pull the wool over the eyes of the Nazis in the process.\n\nThis tale is told with wit and also music in a commedia dell’arte style – with the music inspired by Bulgarian and Jewish folk tunes – and superbly acted and performed by a gallant troupe of farceurs, singers as well as musicians that include Cullen, and Wilson (playing the three parts of Queen Giovanna, Dannecker, and Liliana Panitza) as well as Lawrence Boothman (playing Filov), Clare Fraenkel (playing Gobrovski and Anka Lazarov), and David Leopold (playing Belev, and Metropolitan Stefan) playing all of the key figures in this story about Boris III, under the watchful eye of skilled director, Hannah Hauer King. These are skilled farce performers while at the same time adeptly reveal an important historical story.\n\nThe question is what is history – that is history that is included within the covers of book or what is passed on from person to person through generations. The Brief Life & Mysterious Death of Boris III, King of Bulgaria, has brought to light a key historical figure that would be unknown to most of us – not to mention his bravery at a time of crisis.\n\nThe combination of the story and how it is interpreted make for an ironic and clever theater experience – and even getting rave reviews from Boris III’s grandson, HRH Prince Kyril of Bulgaria, and great grandson, HRH Prince Boris of Bulgaria.\n\nThe Brief Life & Mysterious Death of Boris III, King of Bulgaria is history, provocative, and entertaining – and also well-written and performed. The formula for a unique theatrical experience.\n\nWindrush Secret\n\n59E59 Theaters\n\nMay 4, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nBeing presented as part of the 59E59 Theaters’ Brits Off Broadway 2024 Season, Windrush Secret is a unique condemnation of a government policy that can be explained as bureaucratic bumbling, antiquated aspects of British Imperialism – or in simplistic terms — racism.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1973, more than a half million of people from the Caribbean were persuaded to migrate to Great Britain to add to labor force to rebuild British infrastructure after World War II. Although there was racism and discrimination in Britain over the years, these migrants became part of the tapestry of the British population – until 2018.\n\nIn 2018 new immigration laws were passed by Britain’s Parliament in what could only be described as disturbing, and a misuse of power. With the stroke of a pen thousands of who were described as the “Windrush” generation were suddenly subjected to possible deportation, lost their jobs, lost their homes, and denied their healthcare.\n\nIn Windrush Secret, written, directed, and performed by Rodreguez King-Dorset, the fictional characters of a black Caribbean diplomat from Trinidad, a white far-right party leader, and a white government official who is a special assistant to the Home Secretary – all played by King-Dorset – try to explain, and illuminate what had happened in creating this crisis, and the political and social outrage that resulted when this self-inflicted and newly-created problem was imposed on the “Windrush” generation – an unnecessary political blunder – either by accident or with intent.\n\nSet in 2018 Marcus Ramsay, a black Caribbean diplomat, speaks to a large crowd in Parliament Square – speaking against the then Home Secretary Theresa May’s newly-minted policy to deport Caribbean Britons who had migrated to the United Kingdom after 1948. Ramsay questions this policy on the basis of how much Caribbean Britons had contributed to the United Kingdom after the war, and were being showed little gratitude by the British government.\n\nTrevor Smith, a leader of the English for the English political party, speaks to a small crowd at a Woolwich social club – he spews the hatred of admiring slavery, Adolf Hitler, Oswald Mosley (British Union of Fascists leader), and quotes former Prime Minister Boris Johnson as well. The racial epithets flow, and ultimately Smith comes to terms with his own family connections.\n\nAnd a government official, Charles Henry Williams, from the Home Office, who speaks to the even smaller audience of a House of Commons select committee made up of six British politicians – in which he defends the decision to deport British Caribbeans who cannot provide documentation of their immigration status – in spite of the fact that such documentation had been destroyed by the Home Office in 2010.\n\nAlthough these three men are fictional, their thoughts and beliefs were taken from official documents and contemporary newspaper articles. But to appreciate Windrush Secret and King-Dorset’s performance one would have to do a little research about this unique British scandal – although not untypical of similar scandals in other Western countries.\n\nKing-Dorset, in playing all three men in Windrush Secret, assumes their profiles including their beliefs and entitlements – in a powerful and riveting performance.\n\nHell’s Kitchen\n\nShubert Theatre\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nRecording star and composer, Alicia Keys, has now joined the Broadway community of composers – incorporating her music and lyrics – into an autobiographical musical, Hell’s Kitchen, with a book by Kristoffer Diaz, which had its Broadway premiere earlier this month at the Shubert Theatre.\n\nHaving already been acclaimed at its Public Theatre engagement, Hell’s Kitchen has now moved to Broadway, and is reaching a wider audience. On the day of the performance I attended Hell’s Kitchen celebrated its thirteen Tony nominations including one of them for Best Musical of the 2023-2024 Broadway season.\n\nFollowing the best advice Keys has written about what she knows, and Hell’s Kitchen is a semi-autobiographical exploration of Keys’ childhood, and rite of passage – finding herself and discovering her passions in life.\n\nIt is the 1990’s, and 17-year-old Ali (played by Maleah Joi Moon) is living in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen. She feels constrained in her every day routine – including the contentious daily dinners with her over protective mom, Jersey (played by Shoshana Bean), and would rather be hanging out with her friends and flirting with an older friend, a drummer, Knuck (played by Chris Lee) – a relationship that is not approved by Ali’s mother nor any of the adults in Ali’s life.\n\nAs Ali takes her daily elevator rides in the Manhattan Plaza apartment complex where she lives, Ali hears opera and music emanating from the apartments at each elevator stop – and also knowing that poets and other artists are similarly at work. Confused about her relationship with her parents, and wanting to lead her life in an impulsive fashion, clearly Ali is the quintessential rebellious teenager.\n\nBut because her estranged father, Davis (played by Brandon Victor Dixon) is a musician, it is fate that Ali wanders into the Ellington Room in her apartment complex, when she is trying to cope with the crisis in her relationships with her mother, and her boyfriend Knuck, where Ali develops a relationship with Miss Liza Jane (played by Kecia Lewis). Miss Liza Jane gets Ali instantly, and she uses her persuasion, and her task master manner to get Ali to learn how to play piano, and develop her musical talent. Ali finds that music is a way of expressing her herself and her emotions. As Miss Liza Jane informs Ali, music is handed down from one generation to the next.\n\nBut Hell’s Kitchen is a story of a young woman coming of age with an organic narrative that is influenced from the atmospherics of living in New York City in the 1990’s, and provides a launching pad for Keys’ music. Key’s music is inspired by fire and emotion, and when appropriately sung and employed in the narrative of Hell’s Kitchen, makes for some stirring theatrical moments.\n\nMoon generates those fiery emotions when she sings “Girl On Fire,” and in the inspiring finale, “Empire State of Mind,” Bean reaches emotional and dramatic heights when she sings “Pawn It All,” and Lewis brings passion and love to “Perfect Way To Die.” Unfortunately not all of Key’s songs are weaved well into the narrative.\n\nHell’s Kitchen’s director Michael Grief keeps a grip on the cast in focusing them on the story at hand, and Camille A. Brown offers her signature choreography to enhance the ensemble numbers.\n\nOverall it is the high-powered performances by Maleah Joi Moon, Shoshana Bean, Brandon Victor Dixon, and Kecia Lewis that make Hell’s Kitchen come alive as a theatrical event not to be missed.\n\nNT Live – The Motive and the Cue\n\nSkirball/NYU Auditorium\n\nApril 28, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nThere are times when you feel you would have liked to have been a fly on the wall during the rehearsal process of a major theatrical event. NT Live, at Skirball/NYU, presented such an opportunity in the screening of Jack Thorne’s new play, The Motive and the Cue, which focuses on the evolvement of the revered and controversial 1964 Broadway revival of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet which starred Richard Burton, and was directed by John Gielgud.\n\nThis historic revival of Hamlet starred a young Richard Burton at the beginning of his stardom – then married to movie star, Elizabeth Taylor – returning to Broadway in a revival of a classic play – a play that has catapulted many a British actor to major stardom and legend. A true test for an actor and a rite of passage as well. This production was guided and directed by another legend, Sir John Gielgud, himself an exemplary and opinionated Shakespearean. And therein lies the crux of this account of Hamlet – and also The Motive and the Cue.\n\nThis revival of Hamlet had 137 performances on Broadway, and The Motive and the Cue puts into context the production itself, and the contentious relationship between Burton and Gielgud in the evolvement of the revival.\n\nAmerican actor William Redfield, who played the role of Guildenstern, in this revival of Hamlet chronicled the tortuous rehearsals in his book, “Letters From An Actor,” and as a character in The Motive and the Cue, is a participant, and also an objective observer of those contentious rehearsals.\n\nGielgud’s intent was to stage this revival of Hamlet as it was during its last rehearsal, performed with the actors in street clothes, and in a rehearsal studio space. Established American actors were recruited to play supporting roles as it was thought this would be a great opportunity to learn from Gielgud, the master, but also to participate in what could be the glamour event of that Broadway season.\n\nIn The Motive and the Cue, one can witness the power struggles in the rehearsal room for this production with Gielgud and Burton testing each other – at first playing a polite tennis game with witty banter and degenerating into a verbal brawling – not bringing out the best out of them – the push and pull between director and actor was in evidence – as well as the jealousies and differences between a mentor and a mentee. Each of them brought their own emotional baggage into the rehearsal room.\n\nIn abundance were Gielgud’s clever, but hurtful put downs while Burton was taking the play’s emotional resonance to heart as Gielgud was providing Burton with subtle direction but not kindling the fire that Burton wanted to give to the role. Burton was trying to find the diffidence in the character of Hamlet, and trying to interpret it in his own manner – with Gielgud and Burton giving deference to Shakespeare in their familiarity referring to Shakespeare as Uncle Will.\n\nThe Motive and the Cue chronicles how this production came to be, as well as the battle between generations who had different points of view in interpretating the Bard’s work for present day audiences. With intermittent highlights from Hamlet, The Motive and the Cue is a play within a play.\n\nAlthough the focus of the play are the sparring partners, Gielgud and Burton, it is how Burton contests Gielgud’s authority over him, and how Gielgud keeps a good face on in the course of the battle. Gielgud trying to do it with subtlety and some control, whereas Burton is portrayed as out of control – even incorporating alcohol into the rehearsal proceeding which sets off Burton and other cast members – and ultimately how there is a meeting of the minds between Gielgud and Burton in regard to the interpretation of the play that should be presented. And all of these battles take place while the ghosts of some of the great actors of all time are egging on the battle, and trying to influence the current day actors.\n\nGielgud also spars with Elizabeth Taylor, then Burton’s wife, who is the outsider looking in – and without being in the rehearsal room – is protecting her husband Richard Burton – and attempts to be the diplomat to try to resolve the problems that Gielgud and Burton are having.\n\nThe Motive and the Cue, aptly directed by Sam Mendes, is led by a cast of actors that perform well as an ensemble and also support the principal players, Mark Gattis (as Sir John Gielgud), and Johnny Flynn (as the young Richard Burton). Gattis and Flynn give epic yet also subtle performances in The Motive and the Cue creating electricity between these two great actors, and also notable Janie Dee as Eileen Herlie, Tuppence Middleton as Elizabeth Taylor, Luke Norris as William Redfield, and Allan Corduner as Hume Cronyn.\n\nAnd if you want to know what The Motive and the Cue means, its relevance, and where the phrase comes from, you will have to see the play – an experience you would not want to miss.\n\nPatriots\n\nEthel Barrymore Theatre\n\nApril 27, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nPeter Morgan, who is best known as the writer of the mini-series, The Crown, has written an absorbing and complex historical play, Patriots, that has already been performed in London and has now made it to Broadway. The subject matter is far afield from The Crown but is a of significance – an attempt to explain the political realities now existing in Russia – and how it happened.\n\nIn 1991, the year of the fall of the Soviet Union, the only politically powerful assemblage was a loosely organized of Russian oligarchs who had amassed their fortunes during the Soviet regime. They were the power-brokers who could save what was left of the Soviet Union, and possibly realign the political will of the people to new leadership. Perhaps even a Western-style democracy\n\nOne of those power brokers was Boris Berezovsky, one of Russia’s oligarchs who made his money in cars, oil and television, and who had gained his political and economic influence during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin – by initially currying the favor of Yeltsin’s daughter. He became the kingmaker, when it was necessary to find a successor to Boris Yeltsin. To that end Berezovsky had been cultivating a relationship – and becoming a mentor to – the young deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, Vladimir Putin.\n\nThrough Berezovsky’s influence Putin was groomed for a greater role in Russia as Putin was placed in the powerful position of Prime Minister, and was positioned to succeed Yeltsin as President. Berezovsky increased his political ambitions further by running as a successful candidate for the Russian Duma.\n\nBerezovsky also used his influence to increase his wealth through business partnerships with other oligarchs including Roman Abramovich – who was among the oligarchs who turned against him.\n\nAs soon as Berezovsky’s protégé succeeded Yeltsin, it became evident that Putin’s ruthless power grabs threatened Berezovsky’s own influential position setting off a confrontation between Putin and Berezovsky. Putin turned on all of the oligarchs who put him in power, and perhaps engineered an assassination plot against Berezovsky – and ultimately resulted in Berezovsky’s exile to England. Berezovsky and another key player oligarch Roman Abramovich, lived in the UK, and another Alexander Litvinenko, was killed in the UK. With so many exiled Russian exiles in England, London was often referred to with the moniker of being Londonograd.\n\nBerezovsky saw himself as a patriot and so did Putin – but it was Putin, no longer a “little puppet” who won the power play.\n\nPlayed like a human chess game, Peter Morgan sets the scene in a Las Vegas-style bar with appropriately illuminated neo signs of Russian power – that is the playing field and it all builds to a thrilling conclusion.\n\nThe theatrical impact of Patriots is Rupert Goold’s pinpoint direction and inserting some humor into this epic struggle between two men who wanted to succeed to and hold their political power.\n\nMichael Stuhlbarg, playing Boris Berezovsky, and Will Keen as Vladimir Putin are both equal to the task in typifying the incremental moments that heightened the conflict between these two larger than life human beings who destroyed their alliance. A conflict that is the equivalent to a Shakespearean tragedy in a brutal battle for power. Also notable is Luke Thallon as Roman Abramovich, who reflected a young and idealistic interest in partnering with Berezovsky in his business deals, and then ultimately turned on Berezovsky.\n\nPeter Morgan’s Patriots is a complex play about complex people who were making history while also solidifying their influence and political power – and making those conflicts come alive, explaining them in order to understand where such conflicts lead — the betrayal of betrayers. These are the ingredients for an electrifying, and exciting theatrical experience.\n\nLincoln Center Theater – Uncle Vanya\n\nVivian Beaumont Theater\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nPerformances of Anton Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya are popping up on stages all over the world. The Lincoln Center Theater is now presenting a production of its own that has been adapted into a new version by Heidi Schrek (author of What The Constitution Means To Me) with the intent of giving this classic play a modern-day slant.\n\nUncle Vanya was first produced by the Moscow Art Theatre in 1899, and as in the case with all of Chekhov’s plays, they are often focused on the lives of upper-class Russians who are landowners or in the professions or petty government officials, and the big question is whether they should be played as comedies or dramas – or a mix of both. Schrek’s version has chosen the comic route, and certainly not a traditional take on Chekhov’s play.\n\nThe play, Uncle Vanya, focuses on relationships that evolve through the course of the play but have their roots in the past — the place, a family farm (which seems to be in a generic geographic location in this new version), currently the home of Sonya (played by Alison Pill) and her Uncle Vanya (played by Steve Carrell) who find their lives upended when surprise visitors arrive at the farm.\n\nOne of them, Alexander (played by Alfred Molina), a retired university professor – and Sonya’s father – who had been living on the income of his first wife and living in the city — now wants to sell the farm in the hopes of using the money for a long-term investment that would increase the income for himself and his current wife, Elena (played by Anika Noni Rose). It seems Alexander has made this decision without much consideration of how this decision would impact Sonya and Vanya – as well as those working on the farm. And the indecision and procrastination represent the core of the play which at its roots is a family drama – or comedy.\n\nPast relationships include those of romantic love, flirting, and unrequited love. Elena is attracting the attention of Vanya, and also that of the local doctor, Astrov – and Sonya has her own mysteries, and her feelings about Astrov that are not returned.\n\nThe dramatic thread of the play is that of talking and drinking – boredom – misplaced love. Vanya whining – while Astrov is focused on his patients, medicine, and saving trees. Even rain distracts from the boredom – which explodes when the family, and family retainers attack each other in Act II of the play.\n\nThe fact is that boredom is contagious, and all goes back to normal after the visitors leave – after the family drama, and Alexander’s plan to sell the farm was no longer on the table.\n\nThe setting for Schreck’s version of Uncle Vanya seems like a rural part of America with the language filled by American colloquialism. The only original Russian references from Chekhov’s play are the names of the characters. There are blanks to fill in in this version of Uncle Vanya as well.\n\nUncle Vanya is played wonderfully by the comic actor Steve Carrell – he has a natural feel for the stage, and is adept at the comic timing required in the title role in this new version of the play. Sonya is played by Alison Pill, with earnestness – and Alexander is played by Alfred Molina with the appropriate arrogance and lack of awareness of how his decision would change the lives of Vanya, Sonya, and the family, as well as family friends, and the family’s loyal retainers.\n\nThe extraneous characters – but certainly important – are Waffles played by Jonathan Hadary, Astrov played by William Jackson Harper, Maria, Vanya’s mother, played by Joyne Houdyshell, and Marina, the household’s cook, played by Mia Katigbak – all trying to influence the decision that is to be made, and the impact on their futures as they await Alexander’s proposal and decision – and each character is played with the appropriate eccentricities that are required.\n\nWasn’t certain what journey director Lila Neugebauer wanted to take the audience on. I guess that was in the eye of the beholder\n\nThis new version of Uncle Vanya has all of the elements to illuminate this provocative new slant on Chekhov’s play. On the other hand the alchemy is not always consistent. But then again it is worth the journey.\n\nThe Wiz\n\nMarquis Theatre\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nReviving musicals has now become a unique – and can be a magical — artform, and has special challenges when reviving musicals that were products of the social and political times that inspired them. A case in point is the musical, The Wiz, based on L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which has returned to Broadway in a major revival at the Marquis Theatre.\n\nA gloss on Baum’s book, but with an urban edge, and with a black cast, The Wiz had premiered on Broadway in 1975. With a score by Charlie Smalls including the memorable, “If You Believe,” “Ease On Down The Road,” and “Home” — and with an imaginative book by William F. Brown, The Wiz offered an alternative interpretation of Baum’s series of books.\n\nThis revival, with additional material by Amber Ruffin, and a somewhat different perspective from director Schele Williams, attempts to update The Wiz to make it fit into puzzle within the norms of the 21st century while also retaining its energy and emotional power. In this larger-than-life revival, this new revival of The Wiz mostly succeeds.\n\nEven in its original production The Wiz seemed to be a series of vignettes from the well-known source, and the story-telling aspects were diminished or felt to be unnecessary. The audience knows the story, and but for transforming The Wizard of Oz into a musical with an all-black cast, nothing more in terms of the story-telling was necessary.\n\nIn The Wiz, Dorothy (played by Nichelle Lewis) is an unhappy young girl, who had been living in a large city. She was orphaned when her parents were killed, and she was taken in by her Aunt Em, who owns a farm in Kansas. Dorothy feels she is not fitting in, missing her parents, and also her past life in the city. Knowing that there was something more out there in the world, Dorothy has aspirations beyond being limited to life on a farm no matter how much loving support she had living with her Aunt Em.\n\nA tornado strikes, and Dorothy is transported to the land of Oz, and in the midst of doing so, her Kansas farm house topples on Evamean, Wicked Witch of the East, and that’s when Dorothy’s problems really begin.\n\nWith the advice of other Witches to ponder – including Addaperle (played by Allyson Kaye Daniel), the Good Witch of the North — and Dorothy’s desire to return home, Dorothy seeks out a means of getting back home. And the only way to do just that is to pursue the assistance of the Wizard of Oz. Her journey down the Yellow Brick Road offers her opportunities to meet up with a peculiar party of misfits who are also seeking out better prospects in their lives.\n\nDorothy meets up with the Lion (played by Kyle Ramar Freeman), the Tinman (played by Phillip Johnson Richardson), and the Scarecrow (played by Avery Wilson) in search of their own goals and needs from the Wizard in Emerald City. However the Wizard of Oz (played by Wayne Brady) proves to be a bit of a fraud, and requires Dorothy and her fellow travelers to kill the evil Evelline (played by Melody A. Betts), Wicked Witch of the West – and then the Wizard reveals his true self, abandoning Dorothy and her new-found friends, and also enjoying his freedom after feeling imprisoned under a spell he was placed under by Evelline.\n\nDorothy is encouraged by Addaperle to seek out the assistance of Glinda (played by Deborah Cox), the Good Witch of the South to find her way home. Glinda informs Dorothy that she always had the power to get back home and that was in the power of Evamean’s silver shoes – and by clicking them three times she is transported back home, although missing all of those friendly people she met in Oz.\n\nThis is a telling of the familiar story with more wit and street sense than is portrayed in Baum’s stories.\n\nThe Wiz is an unforgettable musical adventure as its score not only lends a hand in telling the story, but also provides star-powered moments for all of The Wiz’s characters. Dorothy has the emotionally and powerful song, “Home” to sing, Glinda has “If You Believe”, and even the Wizard has his own song to introduce himself and set up himself as the fraudster he turns out to be.\n\nBut the music cannot live on its on without the performers to make the music sing, and carry over the footlights to the audience, and the cast for this revival of The Wiz is superlative.\n\nNichelle Lewis’ emotionally charged performance as Dorothy – and also her adeptness in The Wiz’s comic moments – is a highlight of The Wiz – but also just as impressive are Deborah Cox as Glinda, Allyson Kaye Daniel as Addaperle, Melody A. Betts in the dual role of Aunt Em and Evillene, Avery Wilson as the Scarecrow, Phillip Johnson Richardson as the Tinman, Kyle Ramar Freeman, as the Lion, Wayne Brady as The Wiz, and the talented ensemble of singer/dancers who make this stunning and joyous revival of The Wiz, a revival of The Wiz for the 21st century.\n\nThis revival of The Wiz is an unforgettable musical adventure, and gives an audience a great deal to celebrate.\n\nSuffs\n\nMusic Box Theatre\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nUnique among this Broadway season’s musical offerings is Suffs which tells the story of how the fight for women’s rights, and the right for women to vote, emerged in the United States in the early part of the 20th century – and notably emphasizing that the fight continues.\n\nHaving had its premiere at the Public Theatre last season, the Public Theatre along with other producers — among them Hillary Rodham Clinton and Malala Yousafzai – have taken on the high risks to make it possible for Suffs’ to be transferred to Broadway this season. This major commitment, I hope, will make it possible for a wider audience to experience the embarrassment of riches that is Suffs’ gift.\n\nSuffs, which recently opened at the Music Box Theatre, is the one-person artistic enterprise of Shaina Taub, who has composed the score and wrote the book for this musical – and she also appears in Suffs in the pivotal role of Alice Paul, one of the women’s rights’ leaders.\n\nIn 1913, with a women’s movement also emerging in Great Britain, the American women’s movement became energized – represented by the suffragists who were seeking a woman’s right to vote. In spite of President Woodrow Wilson’s reluctant support, the culmination of those efforts – and the right to vote– was the approval of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920 which institutionalized a woman’s right to vote removing a patchwork of conflicting laws from state-to-state.\n\nUnique in this social and political movement was that it crossed generational, economic, and ultimately racial lines – and Suffs tells the story of the fight, the struggles among the activists in the movement, and references the efforts still ongoing in terms of women’s rights.\n\nAs in any political movement there are conflicts within the movement, and the contrasts between Carrie Chapman Catt and Alice Paul, represents the focus of Suffs, along with references to how black women would be involved in this complicated political and social equation. A story that has local connections as the women’s movement in the United States was spawned in New York State and New Jersey – it is our local history – but also national history.\n\nYou feel the seriousness and earnestness of this issue in Suffs’ opening number, “Let Mother Vote” which in plain terms cleverly sets the scene for the story being told in Suffs, as well as the conflict of the generations in “The Young Are At The Gates.”\n\nThe focus is the chess game between feisty Alice Paul (played by Shaina Taub) representing the younger generation, and the upper-class and lady-like Carrie Chapman Catt (played by Jen Colella), representing the older generation, in terms of the strategy, the methods, and sacrifices enshrined in Suffs about the road blocks and successes in reaching the goal for women to get the vote – with the ultimate and affirming vote by the Tennessee State Legislature approving the 19th Amendment. Suffs also touches on the inclusion of black women in the movement – and overall, telling the story with humor and irony.\n\nShaina Taub’s score and book bring intimacy to this important story, and Leigh Silverman’s direction brings this compelling story to life. Those women portrayed in Suffs are unique in their own right which is reflected in the score, book, and Silverman’s focused direction.\n\nThe all-female cast is the life-blood of Stuffs, most notably Taub as Paul and Colella as Catt, but also the performances of Hannah Cruz as Inez Milholland and Kim Blanck as Ruza Wenclawska, bringing these unique characters to life. Additional standout performances are given by Anastacia McCleskey as Mary Church Terrell, Nikki M. James as Ida B. Wells, Grace McLean as President Woodrow Wilson, and Emily Skinner in the dual roles of Alva Belmont and Phoebe Burn.\n\nSuffs is not merely a work of art that teaches us a great deal about American history, but also a moving, and stirring musical theatre experience.\n\nLempicka\n\nLongacre Theatre\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nBy Mark Kappel\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nSome of the new musicals during this current Broadway season have been inspired by romantic novels, life on the fringe, and historical events – and strong female figures in history. The new musical, Lempicka, which recently opened at the Longacre Theatre falls into many of these categories, but for certain it is a biographical musical about a cultural icon, a painter, whose work has been embraced by committed collectors and celebrity collectors. But remains an unfamiliar postscript from the past.\n\nLempicka is about the life and experiences of Polish-born painter, Tamara de Lempicka, who lived and worked in Europe, and ultimately migrated to the United States. She was known as a socialite, a personification of an artistic icon, and as a painter who was influenced by – and contributed to — the Art Deco movement.\n\nShe was born to Polish parents in the 1890’s and when in Saint Petersburg, Russia, she met and married a Polish lawyer, Tadeusz Lempicki. As depicted in Lempicka, Russia was on the brink of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1916 at which time Tadeusz was arrested by the Bolsheviks. Sacrificing her dignity and her morality – Lempicka was able to obtain Tadeusz’s release, and they escaped St. Petersburg travelling across Western Europe and finally settling in Paris in 1918.\n\nIn order to survive, Lempicka turned to her childhood talent for painting, and she began selling her paintings understanding the market for personal portraits, and also the trends in painting including Futurism and Cubism. In all instances her art reflected the times it was created in with Europe having survived World War I, and the rumblings of being on the brink of World War II.\n\nLempicka found the subjects of her paintings not only among the elite of Paris, but also in the underbelly of Paris which included her pursuit of her muse, Rafaella, who inspires her to paint female nudes with a unique perspective – opening up Lempicka’s proclivities as a bi-sexual, and also experimenting with the recreational drug use of the time.\n\nLempicka became the mistress of Baron Raoul Kuffner, and they eventually married.
