Sana ok ang coverage ng NBN... Sana ok ang coverage ng NBN.. Sana ok ang coverage ng NBN..\n\n7. I'm hoping that we'll see a bright young Filipino star to emerge this year (much like Sheila Mae Perez 2 years ago).\"\n\nTaekwondo star Donald Geisler, wushu fighter Rene Catalan, gymnast Roel Ramirez, karate queen Gretchen Malalad and pool champion Alex Pagulayan Jr. are among those who are not returning to defend their titles.\n\nBetween them, they account seven of the 114 gold medals won by the Filipinos two years ago at home.\n\nGeisler and Malalad retired following their failed bids in the Asian Games last year in Doha, Qatar.\n\nRamirez, Catalan and Pagulayan did not make the team for various reasons.\n\nRamirez, who won two gold medals, quit the national team over differences with the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines (GAP).\n\nCatalan, on the other hand, failed to qualify during tryouts for the Games. Pagulayan, a former world pool champion, wont be able to defend two titles due to previous international commitments.\n\nAmong Asian Games gold medallists, only pool star Antonio Gabica will see action.\n\nBoxers Violito Payla and Joan Tipon, and Catalan  the other Asiad gold winners  are not included in the 593-strong RP contingent.\n\nEven before they plunge into action, Filipino athletes have virtually lost 39 gold medals due to non-inclusion of some events and the absence of several gold medallists.\n\nHardest hit is wushu which has only five returning champions. Six of the 11 events won by the country had been scrapped.\n\nBilliards won eight golds two years ago, but three of these have been stricken out of the calendar, including the 15-ball rotation won by Ronnie Alcano.\n\nBoxing, which accounted for eight golds, had no defending champions in its mens lineup, but all of its four women gold medallists will be back to defend their crowns. They are Annie Albania, Alice Kate Aparri, Jouvilet Chilem and Mitchelle Martinez.\n\nThe Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines (ABAP) has opted to send some of its best boxers to Olympic qualifying events, including Payla, Tipon and Olympian Harry Tañamor.\n\nAll nine gold medalists in athletics are returning and so does judoka John Baylon who is gunning for an unprecedented seventh gold medal in as many Games appearances.\n\nThe nine defending athletics champions are Henry Dagmil, Arniel Ferrera, Danilo Fresnido, Rene Herrera, Aing Jimar, Mercedita Manipol, Christine Hallasgo, Mary Joy Tabal, Christabel Martes, Marestella Torres and members of the men's 4 x 400-meter relay squad.\n\nSwimmer Miguel Molina will be back to improve on his three-gold showing, but teammate Miguel Mendoza, the only other winner at the pool two years ago, has retired.\n\nDiver Sheila Mae Perez, another three-gold winner, will also see action, but is concentrating on individual events following the retirement of partner Cesiel Demenios.\n\nOn GMA's sister network Q Channel 11, at 10 a.m. before and 1 p.m. after Balitanghali is the Men's Downhill Mountain Bike final led by Joey Barba and 1 p.m. is the\n\nOpening Ceremonies will be on December 6. It will be telecast live over NBN on Thursday at 6:30 p.m.\n\nThe opening ceremony which is divided into eight segments was held on 6 December 2007 at 7 p.m. (8 p.m. local time) at the 80th birthday stadium.\n\n4-time swimming gold medalist Miguel Molina was named the Most Valuable Male Player of the 2007 SEA Games, the third Filipino (and also the third Filipino swimmer) to bag the major award for outstanding SEA Games performance after Akiko Thomson in the 1989 Kuala Lumpur Games and Eric Buhain in the 1991 Manila Games.\n\nMolina won three gold medals in men's 400-meter individual medley, 200-meter individual medley and 200-meter breaststroke last December 7, 8 and 10, 2007.\n\nHis fellow swimmers and Beijing Olympic qualifiers Ryan Arabejo, James Walsh, and Daniel Coakley are winning the gold medals in men’s 200-meter backstroke, 1,500-meter freestyle, 200-meter butterfly, and 50-meter freestyle.\n\nThe Philippines had a total haul of 228 medals, second only to Thailand.\n\nBut the SEAG standings are based only on the gold haul, thus the Philippines’ sixth finish. Of the 228 medals, 41 were for gold, 91 for silver, and 96 for bronze. The 228 medalists compose some 40 percent of the 593 athletes who were fielded for the SEA Games in Thailand.\n\nAre our artists participating in the SEA Games in Thailand? I can only count three: Japoy Lizardo – ABS-CBN star magic talent – he is the defending champion in pinweight in Taekwondo. Enchong Dee – another ABS-CBN star magic talent – we already witnessed what happened to this kid in swimming. finished last in the finals of his two events (100-meter and 200-meter butterfly) and Andrew Wolfe – part-time actor and model – he a part of the rugby team who won the silver medal.\n\n\"I have checked the NBN website and I saw this as their TV schedule on December 9, 2007:\n\n1:00 pm - 5:00 am:\n\nTennis (Dec. 8)\n\nBEACH VOLLEYBALL ( M ) ( Dec. 8)\n\nSWIMMING - FINALS ( Dec. 8 )\n\nBILLIARDS - FINALS ( Dec. 8)\n\nBASKETBALL (W) Philippines vs. Singapore\n\n7:00 - 9:00 pm: BASKETBALL ( M ): Philippines vs. Indonesia\n\n9:15 pm - 1:00 am -\n\nBoxing\n\nSwimming (Finals)\n\nWushu\n\nDANCESPORT\n\nPENCAK SILAT\n\nSwimming:\n\n\"Men's 100m Butterfly\n\nPHI lane 5 James Walsh\n\nPHI lane 8 Ernest Dee\n\nSana makakuha tayo ng gold.\n\nREPORTER: Sen.
