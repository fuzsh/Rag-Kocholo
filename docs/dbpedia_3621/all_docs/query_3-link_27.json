        "text": "Each and everyone of us have our own share of problems and challenges in our lives, but giving up should not be an option. Many of us have lost their jobs, some are trying hard for jobs, some are facing business losses whereas some are facing challenges in their personal lives, but we should not let these problems break our motivation to live an optimistic life. We should learn from people like Nick Vujicic as he didn't allow his disability to stop him from becoming a motivational speaker, an artist, a swimmer, a surfer, a sky diver and an author. We should always be thankful for whatever we have and always strive our best in what we can do in life. Take care and have a great day ! Let's try to be like Nick - the man without limbs and without limits ! 😊😊😊👍👍👏👏👏 - Syed Mahmood Hussain Naif Basaar Dina Muhammad Eslam Shaden Firas Al Msaddi Abidha Muhammad Shahid Bawa Purity Ng'ethe Joseph Saheb Youssef Strati Francesco Sadaf Shahzaib Nicholas Edward Richa Khanna Yousef Abboud Jabir Sohaib Faisal Abel Bayart Shankar Chatterjee Jamadah Bbuye SIDDIQA Walaa Piyush Liaqat Syed Wasif Mehdi Mohammed Aatif Khamis Mubarak Fabien Ghys Leo Nonesa Lisa Mitchell, ACC, CTDP Mariam Maher Aboud Hila Hira Laith AL Riyami Aisha Zahid Khan Meghna shivangi\n\n“𝗣𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝘆 𝘀𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗢𝗡𝗟𝗬 𝗢𝗡𝗘 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿.

Her blazing effort after falling halfway in the run showcases what mental toughness, grit and never say die attitude is all about! The learning here is that you are always in competition with your own self. The team will help you prepare and do everything possible to get you in the best shape. But when the competition starts it is just YOU who has to manage everything on your own (your body and your mind). As an athlete one has to learn to find strength and bounce back when you hit rock bottom. The whole world was watching Heather when she fell down but she kept her focus on the goal and didn't sit there disappointed. Possibly she was the ONLY ONE who believed it wasn't over. It is never too late to turn things around. I feel this applies generally to everyone because in life we all are faced with challenging moments and we ultimately have the power to change the final outcome.
