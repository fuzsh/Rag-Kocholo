        "text": "This weekend is the start of the Asian Games in Hangzhou. In 2018, at the 18th Asian Games in Jakarta, I was honoured to be part of the national squash team after all these years working in finance. It was an honour to represent my country and a privilege to be around these excellent competitors and many of them preparing for the Olympics. Through them and these experiences, I have learned so much. Many of these athletes have overcome tremendous adversity, social and economic, to excel in their respective sports. To represent their countries, they have also relied on their sport associations and/or private supporters to help them to continue to train and compete at an elite level. Talent is essential but is not the only important factor to success. Team work, support systems, resilience and continuous training & learning are similar things that have helped me through my career. Thank you for all your dedication and good luck to all the athletes!\n\nBritish Open Squash Masters finalist for over40s! I am grateful to still compete at top level after all these years whilst working. Thankful to my support network at home, at PIMCO, at Coolhurst & the Hurlingham Clubs that enable me to perform and be better every day. Wouldn't be able to do this without great team work and inspiration\n\nFortunate to win the first medal for the Philippines in the World Squash Masters Championships in Poland for the +40 Womens. Especially after the pandemic, watching the over +70,+75, +80 year age groups still competing and moving like half their age has been very inspirational. Age is just a number. Many of the players showed so much resilience, hard work, comradery and positivity through the tournament. I hope I can be as agile as them when I get their age! Such a privilege to still be competing at a high level & grateful for the experience. #bronzemedal #positivemindset #worklifebalance #inspiration #rolemodels #healthyliving https://lnkd.in/e4MyCZ7m"
