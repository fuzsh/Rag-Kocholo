        "text": "Charles Borromeo, the 1982 Asian Games 800m gold medallist, on the sidelines of an event here on Monday, said the performance of India’s track and field athletes in the 2018 Asian Games indicates the change in the mindset that they have the capability to win.\n\n“That mindset is there now because they are well-supported, well-protected, so that they are fine financially, physically and morally.\n\n“Now, after 2018, we are definitely not going to look back. We are only going to go forward.”\n\nTraining abroad\n\nReportedly, last year was the first time India’s track and field athletes had gone abroad to train for the Asian Games. They had gone to Thimphu (Bhutan) for high-altitude training.\n\nHealthy funding\n\nResponding to it, he said there is healthy funding for athletics nowadays which has made it possible.\n\nHe added that most of the athletes now train abroad in general, and that there is a healthy competition among themselves in each discipline.\n\nOn looking forward to the Tokyo Olympics, he said, “Throughout 2019, they (the athletes) will be exposed to a lot of international competitions.\n\n“Also, since 2020 Olympics is in an Asian country, the conditions will be favourable for the Indians, I feel. Be it javelin throw, or 400m, or any event, we can expect encouraging results.”"
