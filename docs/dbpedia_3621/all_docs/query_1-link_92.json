Some of his hobbies include spending time with his family as well as outdoor activities, such as fishing, golf and snowboarding.\n\nHe barely survived making his first confession. He cried and cried the night before, worrying, worrying about what he would say, what the priest would say, what would happen next. He cried to his mother, confessing his awful sin- that for two straight years he had been stealing candy from the corner grocer. It was bad, very bad. What made it worse was that his mother owned the grocery store!\n\nBut by the wisdom of his mother, the sense of humor of the priest hearing the confession, and the grace of God, he did survive and went on to become the Father J. Thomas Heron. Father Heron is currently retired, residing at Holy Savior in Norristown. He is Pastor Emeritus of St. Matthew’s in Conshohocken, where he served the parish for 11 1/2 years, from June 2011 – November 2022.\n\nHe entered St. Charles Seminary in September of 1970 to deepen his relationship with the Blessed Trinity and to seek “satisfactory responses” to the many questions he had about life and its meaning and purpose.

He also taught at Archbishop Kennedy and Bishop McDevitt high schools and served as chaplain at Hahnemann Hospital.\n\nFather has authored two books, We Are All Called, An Introductory Guide to Spirituality. He is currently working on a third book, a novel.\n\nThe Eagles, Notre Dame, shooting a basketball, swimming, and listening to music, are his major interests, but prayer and preaching are THE essential components in his life.

Andre has been a friend of priests of the Marian Movement as a layman since 1992 and through the priests and laity of the MMP (Australia) was encouraged to seek the priesthood at a late age.

Ken Geraci, CPM, lived the life of the prodigal son for most of his young adult life. Raised in a nominally Catholic family, who only lived the externals of the faith, Fr. Ken left the Catholic Church for many years. During that time he earned a business degree and worked as a business profession in Advanced R&D and software testing; a few years into his career he joined a few of his co-workers in establishing a $4.5 million Internet software company. Focused on money, fitness, and success, he made little room for God; but God did not give up on him. During this journey, God presented him with challenges that forced him to question his personal beliefs and the question “What is Truth?” Through a series of conversions, years of struggle, study and questioning, Fr. Ken found his way from agnosticism, to non-denominational Christianity, and ultimately back to the Catholic Church.\n\nFr. Ken joined the Fathers of Mercy in 2006 and was ordained in 2012. For two years, he served as an associate pastor of a medium sized parish and currently serves as a Missionary, webmaster and vocation director for the Fathers of Mercy. Fr.

For thirty-three years she worked under the guidance of the late Abbess Mother Angelica, foundress of EWTN. During that time she fell in love with the Divine Will writing of the Servant of God, Luisa Piccarreta from a book received from her Grandmother.\n\nIn 2009, Mother Gabrielle received a sabbatical during which time she made a retreat at a Benedictine monastery with her friend and spiritual director, Fr. Jacques Daley, OSB. While on retreat, they felt God placed a call on their hearts to found a new monastic community in Italy dedicated to Eucharistic Adoration and Luisa Piccarreta’s writings on how to live in God’s Most Holy and Divine Will.\n\nIn 2011, this became a reality when Msgr. Luigi Negri accepted the Benedictine Daughters of Divine Will in the Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro. The Benedictine Monks followed later under Bishop Andrea Turzaai.

St. Anthony Shrine in downtown Boston happened to be my first contact with the friars. Their joy and ministry immediately impressed me.\n\nAfter working for ten years as a salesman in Boston, I entered the Franciscan brothers training program in Rye Beach, N.H., followed by a year in the novitiate in Paterson, N.J. During these formative years, we practiced discipline and learned the rule of the Order of Friars Minor, plus the history of the Order and of the Province. My love for the Order and Province grew deeper.\n\nIn mid-summer 1957, I was transferred from the lush rolling hills of the scenic Delaware Valley at St. Joseph Seraphic Seminary in Callicoon, N.Y., to the gritty, noisy, busy streets of midtown Manhattan, a half-block from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. It proved to be quite an adjustment for me. As always, the community of friars — 77 in number — at St. Francis of Assisi Church on 31st Street was welcoming and fraternal.\n\nJeannine Peters is a certified Spiritual Director.

Denis has been actively involved in pro-life concerns since before Roe v. Wade. In the 80s he personally witnessed to the “rescue” movement and thereby developed ecumenical ties from the expression of common faith in God as the Author of Life. Beyond preaching and teaching on campus he has now traveled to over 750 venues in 47 states, Canada, Mexico and Europe, delivering the Gospel of Life and supporting the local pro-life efforts of clergy and laity.\n\nFr. Denis writes: “There is sadly no more dangerous place to live than the womb. This bizarre situation of a culture of death propped up by law and camouflaged as medicine perpetuates a lie of a colossal order. Its consequence is a dead end street to baby, mother and civilization.\n\n“Our days, seen against this backdrop, can be foreboding. But they can also serve as a national and church wake-up call to act on the promise God has given us all – to thwart evil and reclaim His Victory over death. A priest therefore needs to be at the front, side by side and supporting his flock in this battle for life. Ours is not an option to wait for someone else to come along. What a joy it is to know that God is in charge and will not fail to lead us forward to end this ‘unspeakable crime’.”\n\nJohnnette B Williams is Founder and President of Women of Grace®, a Catholic apostolate for women featuring a number of outreaches including conferences, media, study groups and more.

Dan and Joanne’s story of how God led them to each of their children is a truly powerful and inspiring one about how a personal relationship with God and obedience to Catholic teaching will lead you to a love you would otherwise have never known. As a father in a biracial family, Dan is especially in awe of how God has made his dinner table a place where in many ways the sons and daughters of former slaves and former slave owners sit together at the table of fellowship as Martin Luther King dreamed. However, Dan shares his story with great honesty and humor revealing that being a dad for Christ in his house is not always so dreamy! Dan’s journey as a father is a reminder that God’s plans are always greater than our own and that a personal relationship with God, while not always easy, is always worth it.\n\nThe Blessed Mother was instrumental in bringing Gloria Coyne back to the one true faith in 1996.

Zealous for the glory of God, the spiritual renewal of the Church, and the sanctification and salvation of souls amidst a secular and hostile culture, they are consecrated to a contemplative religious life of prayer and sacrifice. Thus united to Christ Crucified and the omnipotent prayer of that Great High Priest, they intercede for persons especially in those matters which only prayer and divine grace can remedy: “Human activities cannot help us, but only the suffering of Christ. It is my desire to share in it” (St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross). However, in addition to the hidden influence of the community’s prayers and sacrifices, the community’s priests offer a specific, zealous apostolate of theological education, moral formation, spiritual direction, conferences, and retreats, especially for Catholic leaders, thus invigorating the spiritual vitality of the heart of the Church and deepening the Christian formation of priests, religious, seminarians, and the lay faithful. The community also produces spiritual writings and works to re-publish out-of-print Catholic spiritual, theological, and devotional books for the intellectual education and spiritual edification of the faithful. In addition, the Hermits translate into the English language spiritual and theological works that do not yet have an extant English version. Thus, striving to emulate their saintly predecessors, the Hermits labor night and day to form the next generation of Catholics at the most vital levels of their Catholic faith and spiritual life in order to bring the light of Christ into the darkness of the modern world and effect authentic spiritual renewal in the Church. The community has its monastery foundation in Fairfield, Pennsylvania, where it is working to accommodate its many young vocations, with an average age of 27 years of age in the Order.

Upon completing his assignment at St. Joseph Church in Milton Louisiana, he was re-assigned by Bishop Michael Jarrell to extension work in the New Evangelization.\n\nEighteen years ago Deacon Cody encountered St. Louis Marie de Montfort and his spirituality of baptismal renewal and total consecration to Jesus through Mary in his classic work “True Devotion.” Since then the saint has remained the guiding force of his ministry of spiritual missions, retreats, workshops and days of recollection. Deacon Cody is a musician, a missionary troubadour like his patron St. Louis Marie. Before ordination to the diaconate, Cody spent many years as a professional recording artist and composer. Since being ordained to the diaconate, he has written, produced and performed five CDs inspired by the spirit of Montfort’s canticles. His songs are essential to Cody’s missionary work as they were to the missionary work of his patron. Cody’s missions are increasingly popular among young people. In them through his words and music, he seeks to root their hearts in Jesus through his Mother by living the consecration, no matter what their life calling might be. He has designed a new mission on Montfort’s “Secret of the Rosary” which cultivates a listening heart for Jesus and His Blessed Mother by deep contemplation and meditation on the Rosary’s mysteries.\n\nDeacon Cody has become increasingly engaged both nationally and internationally as a spiritual director in the work of recruitment and formation for the Legion of Mary. It is not surprising that Cody was led to this work since the charism of the Legion’s founder Frank Duff was inspired by Montfort’s spirituality of “True Devotion”. Deacon Cody has been active in formation work at the praesidium, curia, senatus, comitium concilium levels of the Legion.\n\nHe has collaborated with Fr. Stephen McGraw and students of Christendom College in extended home-outreach evangelization to homes in Venice, Florida. Deacon Cody attended Loyola Institute of Ministry in the Master’s Program of Pastoral Ministry. He and his wife Cyndi have been married for 37 years and own and operate Astro Products Inc. in Milton, LA. Their son, C. J. Miller is a practicing attorney working in Lafayette La.\n\nMsgr.

I also help save souls by assisting our priests, who are the spiritual doctors of our soul. In union with our priests and our Church, I help bridge the gap of faith and reason for regular everyday life so LOVE and MERCY can cross over to hearts and minds. I am a lay emissary to re-evangelize people so they can go back to the Catholic Church, our spiritual hospital, and experience more fully the saving medicine of God from the Divine Physician Himself and from his priests, through the sacraments and sacramentals.” -Dr. Antone Raymundo\n\nFr Scott Reilly LC is from Kankakee, IL.

Paul Schenck is a married Catholic priest. You may think that’s a poorly written sentence that should read “…a former Catholic priest who is now married.” But, no, Schenck, of York, really is a married Catholic priest, one of about 200 in the nation and another 200 worldwide. He and his wife, Becky, have been married 37 years and have nine children, including “one in heaven.”\n\nAnd that’s not all. Schenck, 57, was raised Jewish, converted to Christianity at age 16 and was a Protestant pastor for about 20 years before becoming Catholic in 2004.\n\nOrdained in the Catholic Church in 2010, Schenck has served as director of respect life activities and continuing education for clergy in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg since 2008 and chairs the Washington, D.C., National Pro-Life Center, an ecumenical mission at the Supreme Court, which he founded in 2004.\n\nSchenck’s journey began in Western New York, where he was raised. There he attended Hebrew school for six years, learning Babylonian Aramaic. When he was in ninth grade, two classmates — one a son of a United Methodist minister and the other who became the first female minister ordained in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America — introduced him to Christianity.\n\n“I listened to them very closely,” Schenck said. “I grew up in a home where Jesus was respected. I was told Jesus was a great rabbi that Christians mistakenly turned into a God. “He began reading the New Testament, which he found very familiar, with names such as Isaiah, Solomon and David and references to circumcision and bar mitzvahs. “There was nothing non-Jewish about it,” he said.\n\nSchenck used the Yiddish word mishmash to describe his family, explaining that his mother was baptized a Catholic and raised an Episcopalian before marrying the son of Jewish refugees and converting to Judaism to please her husband’s father. The priest, whose twin brother is a UMC pastor in Chicago, confirmed his mother and baptized his father in the Catholic Church before they died.\n\nSchenck graduated in 1979 from Elim Bible Institute, in Lima, N.Y. He then attended the Institute of Jewish Studies at the State University of New York because he wanted to study the Old Testament in Hebrew. He graduated from Luther Rice Seminary in 1982. By then, he and his wife, who married at 19, had six children and lived in a garage apartment without enough heat. “We were in desperate straits, but we didn’t know it. We were enormously happy. Our family life and ministry fulfilled us. Our children were our treasures and still are.”\n\nAlthough Schenck was a Protestant clergyman, he said he felt Catholic. When he learned that Pope John Paul II would grant pastoral provisions to married Anglican priests, allowing them to become Catholic priests, he joined a Reformed Episcopal Church, a member of the worldwide Anglican communion.\n\n“I have tremendous respect and admiration for my brother unmarried priests,” Schenck said, “because they voluntarily surrender what is a right that every Christian man has — a wife and a family. They do that for the love of Christ and his church. And I think that’s heroic.”\n\nMichael Skinner is the founder of Gratia Reflections and the author of Men of Virtue Rosary, a special Marian devotion designed for men and their families. Inspired at Malvern during the 2016 Our Lady of Fatima retreat, Men of Virtue – and its motto “There has never been a greater need for good men!” – debuted at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore on the Feast Day of Our Lady of Victory. Since then, Men of Virtue has grown in popularity across the world, and has been featured in the Catholic Review, on Radio Maria USA, and at Mount Saint Mary’s University. In 2017, during the centennial year of the Fatima apparitions, Michael was invited to share his testimony and the story behind Men of Virtue on the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), the largest religious media network in the world with a reach of 250 million households. Today, the Men of Virtue podcast (available on iTunes and Google Podcasts) has been downloaded in 40 countries across the world and in 48 states in the U.S. Michael is blessed with his wife of 25 years and their three wonderful boys, and is inspired by Saint John Paul II’s declaration, “The future of humanity passes by way of the family.”\n\nFather Michael P. Sullivan, O.S.A., travels the country year-round providing parishes with unique and dynamic retreats.\n\nThe letters from pastors seeking his services come to the Province Office, where Father Sullivan reviews them and sends a letter of confirmation if the time and place are suitable to his schedule. If airfare is required the Parish reimburses the Augustinians for expenses incurred. Father Sullivan only asks for a ‘love offering’ that is taken up the last day of the retreat. This offering goes to retired Augustinian priests. This is all that Father Sullivan requires for his services.\n\nFather Sullivan’s mission schedule concentrates on the seven Sacraments. The first night is Baptism, Confirmation, and the power of the Spirit. The second night is reconciling, healing, and forgiveness. The third night is fidelity and commitment. The fourth night is “call to be one bread, one body.” Father Sullivan makes his message known while adding a bit of humor and fun to the mission. Fear is not part of Father Sullivan’s mission talk approach. People leave with a smile, his message well taken, and a feeling of pride in being Catholic.\n\nSister Anne Winkelmann is the Chief Clinical Officer of SODAT of New Jersey, Inc.
