        "text": "Mrs. Amy Terry\n\nAssistant Principal\n\nResource Coordinator\n\n[email protected]\n\nMasters of Science in Education\n\n26 years of Experience in Catholic Schools\n\n​What I love the most about St. Charles is that we are truly one large family!\n\nMs. Becky\n\nPreschool Teacher - 3 year old class\n\nI have been working at St. Charles School for 25 years. I started with the 4 and 5 year old preschool class and\n\nnow teach the 3 year old preschool class. I love these little ones. They keep you on your toes\n\n​and make everyday an adventure.\n\nMrs. Michele Graf\n\nPreschool Teacher\n\n[email protected]\n\nBio coming soon!\n\nMrs. Ashley Spreen\n\nPreschool Teacher\n\n[email protected]\n\nI am thrilled to begin my journey as a preschool teacher at St. Charles! In 2009, I graduated from Indiana University with a bachelor's degree in tourism management. This led me into a career as a corporate meeting and event planner, where I worked and traveled throughout North, Central, and South America. After six years, I realized my desire for a more meaningful vocation, prompting me to pursue a transition to teaching program and ultimately attain a master’s degree in elementary education. The majority of my teaching experience took place in southern Indiana, teaching Kindergarten in the public school system. This year, I have been working at St. Charles, helping children individually and in small groups in grades 1 - 5. You might recognize me from chasing after my own four children, all of whom attend St. Charles: Wren (3rd grade), Olive (1st grade), Otto (preschool), and Wells (preschool). In my free time, you can find me at home enjoying our hobby farm with our goats and sheep, or at one of my children's many sporting events!\n\nMrs. Kilah Galvan\n\n6th Grade Teacher\n\n​[email protected]\n\nI'm thrilled to be the new social studies, math, and religion 6th-grade teacher at St. Charles! Born in Okinawa, my wanderlust began early, leading me to explore over 25 countries, and even obtaining a History Certificate from the University of Kent in Canterbury, England, before settling down and calling Bloomington home. I got married to my husband Jaime (at St Charles Borromeo Church) and graduated from Indiana University with a BA in History and International Studies. I soon thereafter traded in my frequent flyer miles for the joy and organized chaos of raising six incredible kiddos (all St. Charles students except the itsy bitsy one who is still mastering the art of speech) and a brood of chickens. In my rare moments of downtime, you'll find me immersed in a good book, exploring new destinations (mentally, anyway), basking in the outdoors with my kiddos, or cheering them on in their various endeavors, all fueled by enough coffee to power a small army of superheroes. I am genuinely thrilled and honored to be here, and I am looking forward to a fantastic year ahead!\n\nMrs. Natalie Godsil\n\nMiddle School Math Teacher\n\n[email protected]\n\nI am blessed to have the opportunity to join the St. Charles School community. My husband, Joseph, and I have four children who all attended Catholic elementary school and graduated from Cardinal Ritter High School in Indianapolis. After several years as a parent volunteer at her children’s school, she returned to college to pursue a teacher education program.\n\nMy education background includes a BS in Welding Engineering from Millikin University and an MA Ed from Lewis University. I hold an IN license in elementary grades K-8 and middle school subjects in math, science, and social studies. This is my 15th year teaching in a Catholic school setting which includes experience with intermediate grades and middle school math and social studies at Saint Susanna and St. Michael-St. Gabriel Catholic Schools. Before teaching, I spent over 13 years in the manufacturing industry including Pratt & Whitney as a manufacturing engineer and Caterpillar as a welding engineer.\n\nWhen not in the classroom, I enjoy reading, volunteering, and traveling with family. I have a true passion for working with young adults and celebrating their personal and spiritual growth. I also enjoy integrating my background as an engineer into my classroom to inspire students to appreciate math.\n\nMrs. Emily Black\n\nMiddle School Social Studies Teacher\n\n[email protected]\n\nI am thrilled to be joining the St. Charles community in the 2024-2025 school year. My husband, Brad, and I moved to Bloomington in 2020. I am originally from Louisville, Kentucky where I attended Catholic grade school and high school. As a product of Catholic schooling, I feel passionate about the value of Catholic education. I attended college at the University of Louisville, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Middle and Secondary Education with a concentration in Social Studies and a minor in History. I also have a Master’s degree in Teacher Leadership from the University of the Cumberlands and earned my National Board Certification in 2020. I am currently in my ninth year of teaching. I have experience teaching at the middle school and high school levels. Outside of school, I love spending time outside, reading, and being with my family.\n\nMrs. Kylie Hartley\n\nLiteracy Coach\n\n[email protected]\n\nI look forward to being the Literacy Coach at St. Charles in the 2024-2025 school year! Although I've lived most of my life in Indiana, I am thankful for opportunities to have lived in Florida and most recently Ontario, Canada. My husband, Robert, and I are happy to call Bloomington home and look forward to raising our three daughters here. All three of them are St. Charles students, which is such a blessing for our family. I have been in the field of education for nearly 20 years with various jobs including research, evaluation, and teaching. My teaching experience ranges from early childhood through graduate school and although I've enjoyed each of these teaching experiences for different reasons, working with primary students is my favorite. I earned a doctorate in learning and developmental sciences from Indiana University in 2015 and have a passion for helping students foster their literacy skills. When I’m not working, you will most likely find me reading or outside, preferably doing something active with my family.\n\nMs. Caitie Groth\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologist\n\n[email protected]\n\nCaitie is a Bloomington native. She graduated from DePauw University in 2014 and from Indiana University in 2023 with her Master's in Speech-Language Pathology. She is proud to provide speech services at St. Charles and two other private schools in the area!\n\nMrs. Susan Laughlin\n\nSchool Nurse\n\n[email protected]\n\nBio coming soon!\n\nMrs. Adele Boese\n\nPreschool Teaching Assistant\n\n[email protected]\n\nBio coming soon!\n\nMrs. Kathy Wicker\n\nKindergarten Teaching Assistant\n\n[email protected]\n\nHello, I have worked at St. Charles School since 2001. I have an associates degree in business. I have three wonderful children, who all attended St. Charles School. I very much enjoy the outdoors. I love hiking and taking long walks. Working at St. Charles School brings me joy! I really love working with children and helping them in any way that I can! I feel very blessed to work in such a wonderful, caring and loving place.\n\nMrs. Mandy Sparzo\n\nPreschool Teaching Assistant\n\nMy husband and I moved to Bloomington two years ago as he assumed the role of Chief Medical Officer at IU Health. After meeting each other as students at IU in the late 80’s, we married and raised our four children in Avon, Indiana. After many years as a stay-at-home mom, I returned to continue working in Early Childhood Education in both private and public school settings. I have had the opportunity to teach in general education as well as in special education. I am thrilled to continue this work at St. Charles this year. My husband and I enjoy attending sporting events and are fans of live music as well. We look forward to spending time with our adult children whenever possible. I am excited to learn and work with the students, families, and staff of St. Charles.\n\nMrs. Wanida Bruggeman\n\nOffice Manager\n\n[email protected]\n\nI was born and grew up in Thailand. I moved to the United States in 2005, after I graduated from university and worked for a couple of years. I got my master's degree of Science in Healthcare Management from California State University in Los Angeles, CA. We moved to Bloomington, IN in 2010 and I came into the Catholic church at the Easter Vigil in 2018. I started helping with religious education class (Sacramental Prep 1) soon after. In the fall of 2021, I started working as a teacher aid in the preschool class and this is my first year as an Office Manager. I have three children and all of them are at St. Charles School. I enjoy crafting, decorating for events, and sewing. One thing I love about St. Charles School is that we are a family here and I can feel God's presence and His love everyday.\n\nMrs. Siobhan Dennis\n\nAdministrative Assistant\n\n[email protected]\n\nI have been working in the office at St. Charles School since November of 2004. Mrs. Arther is the 4th principal I have worked for and both of my daughters graduated from St. Charles School. I enjoy playing golf, reading, and gardening in my spare time.\n\nMrs. Monica Duncan\n\nBookkeeper\n\n[email protected]\n\nI studied accounting and have a Bachelor of Science in Business from Indiana University. I have had 25 years of accounting experience. I am married with three grown sons - ages 36, 33, 30; a grandson and a granddaughter. I enjoy gardening, crocheting, reading and spending time with my family. The thing I love most about St. Charles School is the kindness and love shared among the faculty and staff.\n\nMs. Jen Pipher\n\nCustodian\n\n[email protected]\n\nI attended Purdue University and earned a degree in Dietetics. Before coming to St. Charles in August of 2020, I worked at Indiana University and St. Paul’s Catholic Church. Being the school “Jenitor” or janitor, I get to be a part of the St. Charles School family. I love being at St. Charles; it is a beautiful school.\n\nI am devoted to the Blessed Mother and a member of the Franciscan M.I.M. (which stands for The Mission of the Immaculata Mediatrix). I attend Mass every day. I also enjoy decorating my “farmhouse” and having coffee breaks with faith-sharing friends."
