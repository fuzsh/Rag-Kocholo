        "text": "India’s Jinson Johnson claimed the gold medal in the 1500 metres race at the Jakarta Palembang 2018 Asian Games on Thursday.\n\nJohnson clocked 3:44.72 seconds to claim the top honours ahead of Iran’s Amir Moradi, who turned in a timing of 3:45.62, his season’s best. Johnson earlier won a silver in the 800m event.\n\nEnding with a bronze was Bahrain’s Mohammed Tiouali (3:45.88).\n\nManjit, who had stunned one and all with his 800m gold, took the fourth position with a timing of 3:46.57. This is also India’s 12 gold medal at the ongoing Asian Games 2018.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Manjit Singh scorched the track and upstaged pre-race favourite Jinson Johnson to win gold as India achieved a rare one-two in men’s 800m at the Asian Games.\n\nNever considered a medal contender, Manjit surprised one and all by pipping more fancied Johnson to clinch the gold with a timing of 1:46.15, which was .20s faster than the Asian Championship medallist from Kerala, who bagged the silver.\n\nIndia’s last gold in men’s 800m was won by Charles Borromeo in the 1982 Asian Games.\n\nIt was India’s only second one-two finish in 800m at the Games since Ranjit Singh and Kulwant Singh achieved the feat at the inaugural edition held in New Delhi in 1951.\n\nCoached by India Army’s Amreesh Kumar, Manjit bettered his personal best mark of 1:46.24 set in Guwahati this year at the Nationals to claim his maiden major international medal.\n\n-With PTI inputs."
