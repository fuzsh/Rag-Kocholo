        "text": "(This is a book and video documentary on television and YouTube wrote by Loren Legarda, the executive producer of The Inside Story aired on ABS-CBN from 1990 to 1998, later Senator from 1998 to 2004, 2007 to 2019 and 2022 to present.)\n\nExactly 12 years, 10 months, 24 days after Pope John Paul II visit the Philippines for the 10th World Youth Day on January 12 to 16, 1995, now 620 Filipino athletes who participated in the 2007 SEA Games in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand from December 6 to 15, 2007.\n\nIn a few months of preparation from July 1 to December 5, 2007, the country's leading free to air broadcast networks such as ABS-CBN, GMA, PTV, ABC, RPN, QTV, IBC, Studio 23 and CLTV and cable TV provider Sky Cable as the official broadcaster of the said event. It was formally signed and approved the contract on October 29, 2007 at the Restaurant 9501, 14th floor of the Eugenio Lopez Jr. Communications Center in Diliman, Quezon City, exactly three days after former President Joseph Estrada was pardoned after a six-year plunder trial case.\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, led by ABS-CBN Chairman, President and CEO Eugenio Lopez III and Chief Operating Officer for Broadcast Cory Vidanes, this coverage would last for nine days with no sign off and assure our viewers that the coverage will be successfully.\n\nRival network GMA has its banners and button pins for the event.\n\nThe title of the coverage is A Time for Heroes.\n\nKasabay ang pagsisimula ng buwan ng Disyembre ay ang Seremonya ng Pag-iilaw ng Christmas Tree o Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, ang unang bahagi ay ang Anticipated Sunday Mass sa ganap na alas-sais ng gabi, kasunod pa sa simula ng programa, tatayo muna at kinakanta ang Lupang Hinirang at Awit ng Maynila.\n\nAndiyan dito sa seremonya ay ang alkalde ng Maynila na si Alfredo Lim.\n\nSa himpilang DZRH bago pansamantalang winawakasan ng aming pagsasahimpapawid: “Oras sa buong Pilipinas, saktong makalipas ang ikalabing-dalawa ng madaling araw, ngayon po ay Linggo, ika-dalawa ng Disyembre, taong dalawang libo at pito. Apat araw na lang, 24th Southeast Asian Games na, 23 araw na lang, Pasko na at 30 araw na lang, Bagong Taon na!”\n\nKahit alas-dose na, nagpapahinga ang DZRH sa araw na ito hanggang alas-kuwatro ng madaling araw babalik kami para sa aming regular na pagprograma.\n\n\"to the flag ceremony past midnight, signaling the end of the day’s programming.\"\n\nx x x\n\n\"The network immediately aired the Philippine national anthem which normally airs at midnight at the end of the broadcast day.\"\n\nSa pagpupulong ni TAPE, Inc. President & CEO Antonio P. Tuviera at Senior Vice President and COO Malou Choa-Fagar noong Linggo, ika-2 ng Disyembre, taong 2007, na sinasabing hindi po madadamay ang pambansang palabas or sikat na top-rated noontime variety show dahil sa coverage ng 2007 SEA Games in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.\n\n(In the meeting of TAPE, Inc. President & CEO Antonio P. Tuviera and Senior Vice President and COO Malou Choa-Fagar on Sunday, December 2, 2007 when the noontime variety show titled \"Eat Bulaga!\" due to the coverage of the 2007 SEA Games in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.)\n\nThe noontime show will have an out-of-studio tour in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates entitled Eat Bulaga! sa Abu Dhabi at the Abu Dhabi National Theatre, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates last December 5, 2007, when the noontime show’s taped episode on the same day before the opening ceremony of the Games.\n\nThe SEA Games Update aired on all programs of DZXL RMN Manila 558, DZBB Radyo Bisig Bayan 594, DZMM Radyo Patrol 630, DZRH, DZRB Radyo ng Bayan 738, DWWW 774, DZRJ Radyo Bandido 810 AM, ZNN Radyo Veritas 846, DWIZ 882, DZSR Sports Radio 918, DZIQ Inquirer Radio 990, DZAR Angel Radyo 1026 and DZEC Radyo Agila 1062.\n\nThe opening ceremony which is divided into eight segments was held on 6 December 2007 at 7 p.m. (8 p.m. local time) at the 80th birthday stadium.\n\nThe country is looking to improve its 6th place finish where it hauled 41 gold, 91 silver, and 96 bronze medals.\n\n4-time swimming gold medalist Miguel Molina was named the Most Valuable Male Player of the 2007 SEA Games, the third Filipino (and also the third Filipino swimmer) to bag the major award for outstanding SEA Games performance after Akiko Thomson in the 1989 Kuala Lumpur Games and Eric Buhain in the 1991 Manila Games.\n\nMolina won three gold medals in men’s 400-meter individual medley, 200-meter individual medley, and 200-meter breaststroke last December 7, 8, and 10, 2007.\n\nHis fellow swimmers and Beijing Olympic qualifiers Ryan Arabejo, James Walsh, and Daniel Coakley are winning the gold medals in men’s 200-meter backstroke, 1,500-meter freestyle, 200-meter butterfly, and 50-meter freestyle.\n\nThe Philippines had a total haul of 228 medals, second only to Thailand.\n\nBut the SEAG standings are based only on the gold haul, thus the Philippines’ sixth finish. Of the 228 medals, 41 were for gold, 91 for silver, and 96 for bronze. The 228 medalists compose some 40 percent of the 593 athletes who were fielded for the SEA Games in Thailand.\n\nAre our artists participating in the SEA Games in Thailand?
