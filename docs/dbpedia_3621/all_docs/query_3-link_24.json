        "text": "South Korean middle-distance runner\n\nThis article is about the runner. For the South Korean television series, see Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-joo.\n\nIn this Korean name, the family name is Kim.\n\nKim Bok-joo (born 17 October 1960) is a South Korean former middle-distance runner who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics.[1] He also competed in the 800 m heats at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics and 1983 Summer Universiade.[citation needed]\n\nKim won his first major regional medal at the 1982 Asian Games, taking the 800 m silver medal behind India's Charles Borromeo (athlete). He was the 1986 Asian Games gold medallist in the 800 m and a silver medalist in the 1500 m.[2]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Asian Games medalists in athletics\n\nSouth Korea at the Asian Games\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nSome English-language sources, such as GBR Athletics,[2][3] erroneously state that Kim Bok-joo was winner of the 1990 men's 800 m and the 1500 m silver medallist, as well as the 1991 Asian Championships runner-up. Contemporary English and Korean sources indicate it was his similarly named teammate Kim Bong-yu who achieved these feats.[4][5][6]"
