Gran Canaria.

Today we went on a trip to Las Palmas and the north of the island. It was a whistle stop tour, covering the Old Town of Las Palmas and the mercado, the Las Palmas Botanical Garden, the crater of the extinct volcano Bandama, then back to Las Palmas for a couple of hours near the Playa de las Canteras.

Lolita Pluma (1904 - 1987) named at birth as María Dolores Rivero Hernández, was a famous person of the 20th century in the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

Her parents were from Argentina, although she was born in the Canarian neighbourhood of La Isleta, into a family nicknamed Pluma due to the fact that they were the few who knew how to write with this utensil in their city.

Lolita Pluma was well known in Santa Catalina Park, due to her extravagant outfit and makeup, and the fact that she was surrounded by the park's cats, which she fed. There she sold paper flowers, chewing gum and postcards to tourists. She was named Queen of Santa Catalina Park in 1984.

The singer and composer Braulio paid tribute to her in one of his songs and even earlier, around 1968, the master of Canarian song Miguel León Martín also dedicated the waltz “A Lolita” to her. On one occasion, this same author performed the song with the group Bentayga on the Tenderete program, on Spanish Television, in 1984. The group Los Gofiones covered the song "Lolita Pluma" on the album "Cronistas de la Música Popular "in the year 2002.

Currently, a statue by F. Ávila (1998) commemorates her in Santa Catalina Park as a symbol of freedom, muse of tourism and artists, protector of animals. She was buried in the San Lázaro de Las Palmas cemetery. Her tomb (tomb niche 5420) is equipped with a sepulchral plaque from the Las Palmas City Council.
