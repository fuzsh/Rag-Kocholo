        "text": "The Las Palmas de Gran Canaria Carnival is now officially a Fiesta of International Tourist Interest. By a resolution of 8 February, the Secretary of State for Tourism granted the title for which the most important festivity in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria had applied: the order was published in the Official State Gazette on Thursday 16 February 2023. The Minister of Trade, Industry and Tourism, Reyes Maroto, came to present the accreditation on 25 February. It was a great day for the Carnival, and the announcement was made on the actual stage in Santa Catalina, where the festival’s main events take place.\n\nThis distinction is a testimonial to the city and its residents, who see the Carnival as much more than just a festival: they see its effects on industry and how it creates wealth, jobs and enthusiasm.\n\nThe new regulations, beyond a mere statement of the Carnival’s track record, require the festival to take place within a setting properly equipped for the tourism sector, with a strong presence in the national and international media and communication duly tailored to visitors. They also demand an international promotion campaign designed not only to highlight the appeal of its programme of events but also to reinforce the prestige of the tourist destination where it is held and the values of its autonomous community and the Spain brand. In addition to all this, evidence of the economic and social impact of the Carnival must be provided.\n\nTHEME\n\nThe theme chosen by the Carnival organisers was Studio 54, a tribute to the legendary New York nightclub. In the year when we returned to normality after years of being on hold or faced with uncertain scenarios due to the pandemic, it had to emphasise the spirit of the festival. Studio 54 achieved just that: it turned the city into an exquisite dance floor that brought those amazing nights of the seventies back to life with music that kept thousands of people dancing for 21 days, just like the celebrities who answered the call of the glamorous nightclub every night."
