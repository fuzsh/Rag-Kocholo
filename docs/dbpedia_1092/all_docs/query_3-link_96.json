        "text": "For decades, famous actors, musicians and dignitaries have called the Coachella Valley home.\n\nLiberace, the superstar pianist, once owned four homes in Palm Springs. Elvis Presley, the King of Rock 'n' Roll, had the Honeymoon Hideaway before purchasing a home nearby in Little Tuscany.\n\nWhile it isn't necessarily a celebrity home, Sunnylands, the former Annenberg estate, has hosted U.S. presidents and foreign leaders.\n\nAs more celebrities, like the Kardashian-Jenner family, continue to buy property in the valley, here's a look at some of the desert's most famous residences.\n\nElvis Presley\n\nThe most iconic Presley estate is often referred to as the \"Honeymoon Hideaway,\" \"Alexander Estate\" or \"house of tomorrow.\"\n\nLocated at 1350 Ladera Circle, a few blocks west of Palm Canyon Drive, the home was built in 1962 by developer Robert Alexander.\n\nThe home has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and is more than 5,000 square feet. It is designed from four circles, which float on three different levels.\n\nPresley leased the home for one year from 1966 to 1967, according to the Palm Springs Bureau of Tourism. It was there where he and Priscilla Presley began their honeymoon.\n\nMore: Elvis honeymoon house in Palm Springs is on the market, and cheaper, at $3.26 million\n\nMore: Elvis Presley's Coachella Valley legacy lives on through Stagecoach\n\nVisitors can walk around the home daily by taking guided tours.\n\nA few years after leasing his first Palm Springs home, Presley bought one nearby at 845 W. Chino Canyon in 1970.\n\nThe four-bedroom, seven-bathroom home was built in 1946 and is more than 5,000 square feet. Designed by Albert Frey, the Chino Canyon home was one of Spanish colonial design.\n\nFollowing Presley's death in 1977, musician Frankie Valli purchased the home for $500,000.\n\nLiberace\n\nThe famous pianist and entertainer owned several homes throughout Southern California, including four in Palm Springs.\n\nHis most iconic residence was The Cloisters, located on on Alejo and Belardo roads. The home, built in the 1920s across the street from Our Lady of Solitude Church, was originally named Villa Theresa for the builder's wife.\n\nThe home was purchased in 1936 by Muriel Fulton and expanded before becoming a bed and breakfast called The Cloisters. Liberace later bought it.\n\nHe also owned a home off North Kaweah Road in the Las Palmas neighborhood. The home, which he lived in during the late 1950s and early 1960s, was open to the public during Modernism Week in 2015.\n\nMore: Liberace fans congregate in Palm Springs for late entertainer's 100th birthday\n\nMore: 11 reasons why Milwaukee's own Liberace, whose 100th birthday is today, is a bigger deal than you think\n\nMore: 'The world' visited Sinatra's Rancho Mirage compound\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nSinatra was first introduced to the Coachella Valley by Jimmy Van Heusen in the 1940s.\n\nIn his middle and later years, Sinatra lived in Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and Palm Desert.\n\nOne of his former residences, known as the \"Twin Palms\" home in Palm Springs, can be rented for photo shoots and events. But others, such as the Rancho Mirage compound, are private residences.\n\nDinah Shore\n\nMore: Modernists gather at Leonardo DiCaprio's Dinah Shore estate\n\nThe 1964 Wexler at 432 W. Hermosa Place sits on 1.3 acres and includes 6 bedrooms and 7.5 bathrooms. In addition to the main house, there's a guest house and tennis court casita.\n\nIt's now owned by Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nThree of the home's bedrooms are part of the \"guest quarters\" wing. The main bedroom near the entrance is tucked away behind a door without a doorknob.\n\nThe home also has floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nBob Hope\n\nMore: Bob Hope house sold to investor Ron Burkle for $13M\n\nMore: Bob Hope house, Pond estate sales cap off hot Palm Springs summer\n\nThe most gargantuan celebrity home in the Coachella Valley previously belonged to Bob Hope.\n\nBuilt in 1980 for the Hope family, the 23,000-square-foot spread is located on Southridge Drive and overlooks the entire city of Palm Springs. It was sold in 2016 for $13 million.\n\nSunnylands\n\nThe Rancho Mirage estate is the former home of the late Walter and Leonore Annenberg.\n\nThe couple, publishers of TV Guide and other periodicals, gave more than $3 billion in grants and gifts to universities, medical centers and other cultural and civic organizations.\n\nSunnylands currently offers guests a garden and visitor center and the former estate is a meeting place for U.S. and international leaders. In 2013, President Barack Obama met with China's President Xi Jinping at the estate.\n\nMore: Explore the Coachella Valley: Sunnylands\n\nMore: Walter Annenberg's deep love for birds reflected in new Sunnylands exhibit by National Geographic photographer\n\nShane Newell covers breaking news and the western Coachella Valley cities of Palm Springs, Cathedral City and Desert Hot Springs.
