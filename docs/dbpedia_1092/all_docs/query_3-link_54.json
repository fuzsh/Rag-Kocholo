        "text": "As the festive season rolls to a close for most of Europe, in Spain, January 6th marks one of the most long-awaited days of the year. The Three Kings Day, otherwise known as Reyes is a vibrant and joyous fiesta celebrated by families across the entire Iberian Peninsula and Spanish islands. The three kings travel from the East bringing with them desired gifts delivered to households across Spain on the night of January 5th. The day after, the 6th, is a day for spending with loved ones and sharing gifts. For the traveller seeking an authentic experience while travelling to Spain during this time of year, the celebration of the three kings is not to be missed.\n\nHave you ever wondered what the ’12 days of Christmas’ actually are, beyond just an excuse for a good sing-along? Officially, Christmas kicks off on the 25th of December and carries on until the 6th of January. In the UK, the 6th of January is the day you’re meant to take your Christmas decorations down, as leaving them up any longer is supposed to be bad luck.\n\nHowever, in Spain, the Feast of the Epiphany or the Three Kings’ Day is a celebration of the adoration of the baby Jesus by the Three Wise Men, also known as the Magi or the Three Kings. Melchior, Caspar and Balthazar travelled to present baby Jesus with three symbolic gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. They’re said to have ridden on a horse, a camel and an elephant. In many Catholic countries, it’s also a bank holiday, but in most places, it isn’t associated with gift giving, despite the Three Wise Men’s gifts.\n\nWhether you are staying in a beachfront hotel in the Canary Islands or a city centre hideaway in Madrid, everyone celebrates in Spain on January 6th. Since the 19th century, Spanish towns and cities have been putting on parades to mark the occasion. There might be floats with effigies of each of the Three Wise Men in the parade, or they might be played by local dignitaries. Either way, these are big, colourful parades that make their way through the main streets of the town, throwing handfuls of sweets out over the crowds. These are fun, light-hearted parades, in contrast to the sombre parades during Holy Week, or Semana Santa.\n\nJust like children waiting for Father Christmas, Spanish children have to get to bed early after watching the parades to ensure they don’t miss the Wise Men bearing gifts. They leave their best pair of shoes, sparkling clean, outside their doors to be filled with gifts. Again, just like with Father Christmas, Spanish children write letters to the Three Wise Men before the big day and leave out snacks and drinks for their camels. Naughty children might get sweet ‘coal’ in their shoes instead of gifts.\n\nIn Spain on January 6th, families gather together and cut into a sweet treat called Roscón de Reyes - a circular cake filled with cream. If you slice into it and get a figurine of a king - you are a king for the day. If however, you get a bean, you have to pay for the cake. This sweet tradition is a non-negotiable during the festive season. Yet, its roots originate back to Roman times when it was distributed at the Saturnalia festival to mark the arrival of sunnier days after the winter solstice.\n\nWhat better way to kick off a new year than treating yourself to a holiday? There might not be any Three Wise Men coming to bring you presents, but that doesn’t mean you can’t give yourself the ultimate gift and spend a few days in Spain around January 6th. Skip the depressing, post-New Year slump when the nights are at their shortest and all the Christmas lights are being taken down and head south for some much-needed sunshine.\n\nHead to the Spanish capital and check into Barceló Torre de Madrid, situated in the heart of the city, offering the best views of the Plaza España Christmas lights. This magnificent location is ideal for being a stone’s throw from the action during Epiphany in Madrid. The city’s famous parade attracts crowds of locals and tourists alike, all keen to see the elaborate floats and the opulence of the three kings. Stroll along the city’s elaborately illuminated Gran Vía and neighbouring streets and marvel at the Christmas light displays. This area is also home to many flagship stores, ideal for some late Christmas shopping. Recharge your batteries by tucking into an individual portion of the classic roscón cake, baked by El Horno de Babette, a local bakery, for the La Santa María restaurant at Barceló Torre de Madrid.\n\nIf you are thinking of celebrating Epiphany in Barcelona, you are in for a real treat. In general, Catalunya goes all out when it comes to celebrating the festive season and they even have their own, weird and wonderful ways to celebrate. Book a stay at one of Barcelona’s top hotels and head out onto the streets to join in the joyful Three Kings parade. For a truly authentic experience, dive into Catalan traditions and embrace the whimsical ritual of Caga Tió - a log, dressed up and fed festive treats before it is hit with a stick so that it can poop out presents. After this bizarre experience, refuel at La Boquería, the city’s famous food market where you will also be able to taste the traditional roscón cake before heading off to explore the city’s museums and other points of interest.\n\nHead to the land of flamenco and tapas to enjoy a few days exploring the historical city of Granada. In between visiting the Alhambra and the Mirador de San Nicolás take time to indulge in some seasonal festivities as well as relax at the Palacio Gran Vía, a Royal Hideaway Hotel. There are over 30 nativity scenes in Granada, each one competing for the town hall’s prize. The majority can be found dotted around the centre, close to the cathedral and they are worth a visit thanks to their intricate decorations. Once the sun begins to fade, admire the city’s Christmas lights and head to one of the many flamenco bars in the city to watch a show. On the 5th, the Three Kings parade kicks off from the Plaza de Deportes and snakes through the winding city streets, filling them with joy. Granada also has its own Christmas market which is held in the Plaza Bib-Rambla. Stock up on souvenirs or head to Puerta Real where you will find an artisan market alongside big high street stores. Granada is the ideal place to be in Spain on January 6th.\n\nSpend the king's day living like royalty at Gran Canaria’s top hotel, the Santa Catalina, a Royal Hideaway Hotel. If you are thinking of spending January 6th in Spain, where better than the warm, sun-kissed city of Las Palmas? Here, one of the big attractions is the sand sculpture nativity scene on Las Canteras beach, right in the heart of the city. This is the biggest of all the city’s nativity scenes and adds a tropical feel to the festivities. The three kings parade through the city is a fun-filled event that starts its route in the Castillo de la Luz. After this, head to the neighbourhood Triana, a stone’s throw from the hotel, to enjoy an evening of markets and concerts. Once you are all partied out, refuel with an exquisite dinner at Poemas by Hermanos Padrón, a Michelin-starred hotel within the grounds of the hotel."
