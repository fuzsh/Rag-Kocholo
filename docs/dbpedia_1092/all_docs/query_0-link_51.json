        "text": "Host Bangladesh gave the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2016 a momentous start with a 43-run victory over defending champion South Africa in Wednesday’s opening Group A match which was produced by the ICC TV and aired around the world by 15 broadcasters.\n\nIn a Group C fixture at the MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong, Dan Lawrence and Jack Burnham hit centuries as title contender England brushed aside Fiji by 299 runs.\n\nBangladesh, which elected to bat on a slow pitch at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong, lost wickets just when the batsmen appeared to have settled down and was restricted to 240 for seven in its 50 overs.\n\nNazmul Hossain hit 73 off 82 balls to boost the total after useful contributions from Pinak Ghosh (43) and Joyraz Sheik (46).\n\nThe target proved too tough for South Africa, which was bowled out for 197 in the penultimate over despite a defiant 100 from opener Liam Smith.\n\nSmith batted till the 45th over before being the seventh batsman out, caught superbly in the covers by Bangladesh captain Mehidy Hasan.\n\nMehidy, leading his nation in the second successive ICC U19 Cricket World Cup, picked up three for 37 with his off-spin. Seamer Mohammad Saifuddin took three for 30.\n\nIt was Bangladesh’s first win over South Africa in the ICC U19 World Cup following four previous defeats, but Wednesday’s victory was its 12th in 15 matches against the same opponents over the past two years.\n\nWith Scotland and Namibia the other sides in the group home team’s victory makes it the favourite to secure top place from Group A and avoid a possible quarter-final clash against Rahul Dravid-coached India.\n\nNazmul Hossain, who was named man of the match, said the slow wicket made their total a challenging target.\n\n“The ball was not coming on to the bat, so we thought it was a good total,” said Nazmul. “I just wanted to bat as long as possible and hold one end up. But I was still a bit disappointed that we could not get another 20-odd runs.”\n\nNazmul insisted his team will not relax after beating South Africa.\n\n“We can’t afford to relax or lose focus,” he said. “We have just put one game away but we must concentrate on the next match and then the next. In a tournament like this there is no room for comfort.”\n\nSouth African captain Tony de Zorzi said Smith’s century was a great positive to come out from what was a disappointing defeat for his side.\n\n“I think Smith played superbly,” said de Zorzi. “240 was certainly not a bad total to be chasing but we did not have wickets in hand. We lost the game in the second half. Hopefully we will do better in the next match.”\n\nIn their next matches in Cox’s Bazar on Sunday, Bangladesh will take on Scotland while South Africa will face Namibia.\n\nMeanwhile, England piled up 371 for three in its 50 overs against Fiji, with Essex’s Lawrence smashing 174 off 150 balls with 25 boundaries and a six, and Burnham of Durham making 148 off 137 balls with 19 fours and four sixes.\n\nThe pair put on 303 for the second wicket after opener Max Holden had been dismissed in the third over.\n\nEngland, whose squad includes nine players with experience of senior county cricket back home, bowled Fiji out for 72 in only 27.3 overs.\n\nPeni Vuniwaqa was the lone batsman to offer any resistance with 36 as four batsmen failed to score and five others did not reach double figures.\n\nLancashire seamer Saqib Mahmood grabbed three wickets for two runs in his five overs and his new-ball partner Sam Curran of Surrey took three for 22.\n\nEngland next plays the West Indies on Friday and Fiji takes on Zimbabwe the same day.\n\nThe 11th edition of the biennial 16-nation tournament features nine Test-playing nations and seven Associate and Affiliate Members – Afghanistan, Canada, Fiji, Namibia, Nepal, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nTeams have been divided into four groups with the top two in each advancing to the Super League quarter-finals and the other two qualifying for the Plate championships.\n\nScores in brief:\n\nGroup A – Bangladesh beat South Africa by 43 runs in Chittagong\n\nBangladesh 240-7, 50 overs (Nazmul Hossin 73, Joyraz Sheik 46, Pinak Ghosh 43; Wiaan Mulder 3-42)\n\nSouth Africa 197 all out, 48.4 overs (Liam Smith 100; Mohammad Saifuddin 3-30, Mehidy Hasan 3-37)\n\nGroup C – England beat Fiji by 299 runs in Chittagong\n\nEngland 371-3, 50 overs (Dan Lawrence 174, Jack Burnham 148)\n\nFiji 72 all out, 27.3 overs (Peni Vuniwaqa 36; Saqib Mahmood 3-2, Sam Curran 3-22)\n\nThursday’s matches:\n\nGroup D – India v Ireland, Mirpur\n\nGroup D – New Zealand v Nepal, Fatullah\n\nGroup B – Pakistan v Afghanistan, Sylhet\n\nGroup B – Sri Lanka v Canada, Sylhet\n\nSailors opening their curtains in Miami this morning would have been welcomed by a pleasant breeze that was enough to put a grin on their faces.\n\nUpon arriving at the venues of Sailing World Cup Miami presented by Sunbrella their grins were to turn into a smile as a 14 knot south eastern breeze whipped its way around Biscayne Bay.\n\nPredicted to hold throughout the day, the breeze was unable to sustain its tempo, dropping early afternoon and in the words of Australia’s Jason Waterhouse it was a day to ‘have your head on a screw.’\n\nIn the end, only the 49er, Laser and Paralympic fleets completed their full schedule of racing for the day with the remainder either completing three, two, one or in the RS:X Women and Finn fleets case, no races.\n\nNacra 17\n\nJason Waterhouse and Lisa Darmanin (AUS) arrived back at Regatta Park, a new venue for Sailing World Cup Miami presented by Sunbrella, late in the day with a consistent day of racing under their belts in tricky conditions.\n\nA 3-4-3 in stable conditions is a day to be proud of, but in the Miami shifts, that’s impressive. The trick? “Have your head on a screw,” exclaimed Waterhouse. “Just keep looking around and making good tactical decisions. The first race was a boat speed race and the next two were tactical chess playing races.\n\n“It was a lot of fun out there and I’m sure there were a lot of ups and downs and we are happy to come away on the right side of it. We had a really good day and were really consistent, it was tricky and typical of Miami. We can take it forward for the rest of the regatta.”\n\nThe Australians are two leading lights in the Nacra 17 fleet, modest in their approach, humble in their ways yet full on and intense in the racing arena. They won gold at the Aquece Rio – International Sailing Regatta 2015 and are backing that performance up with further results to match.\n\nAfter five Nacra 17 races they lead the way on 13 points, Mandy Mulder and Coen de Koning (NED) follow on 20 and Santiago Lange and Cecilia Carranza Saroli (ARG) sit third on 26.\n\nRace wins on the day went to Iker Martinez and Julia Roman (ESP), Gemma Jones and Jason Saunders (NZL) and Paul Kohlkoff and Carolina Werner (GER).\n\n49er and 49erFX\n\n‘Keeping it consistent’ is a term every racing sailor aspires to and that term could not be more appropriate in the Olympic sailing arena.\n\nSailors don’t necessarily have to win a race to claim a medal. Regular results at the front of the pack can go a long way to ensure you’re there at the end when it counts.\n\nArgentina’s Victoria Travascio and Maria Sol Branz are well known for their light breeze consistency and they personified that once again by picking up a 2-1-2.\n\n“We did very good and it was really cool,” explained Travisco. “We managed three good starts and that was it really. The first we went on the left, had a good start and stayed on the left.”\n\nThe Argentineans demonstrated their light wind nous in the middle of 2015, winning Pan American Games gold on Lake Ontario in Toronto, Canada. Miami’s conditions on Tuesday suited them and they have leapt up the leader board, tied for third with Brazil’s Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze (BRA).\n\nRagna and Maia Agerup (NOR) hold their overnight lead with Alex Maloney and Molly Meech (NZL) in second.\n\nDefending Miami 49er champions Nico Delle-Karth and Nikolaus Resch (AUT) took over at the top of the pile after four races. They opened up with a 13th, which they discarded before swiftly following up with a fourth, second and a first. They occupy first overall on 12 points.\n\nJames Peters and Fynn Sterritt (GBR) are second on 19 and overnight leaders Jorge Lima and Jose Costa (POR) drop to third on 24 points.\n\nMen’s and Women’s 470\n\nToday, on the Women’s 470 course at the Sailing World Cup Miami presented by Sunbrella, it was all about the pressure. From the wind, that is. As with yesterday, a promising breeze in the morning dwindled quickly. By noon it was decidedly in the single digits. By mid-afternoon it was on the edge of being unsailable. By that time, however, the women 470 sailors, were ashore, washing off their boats and thinking about what went right or what went wrong—or maybe a little of both—in their two races.\n\n“When it’s so light, the pressure [is most important],” said skipper Fernanda Oliveira (BRA), who, along with teammate Ana Luiza Barbachan, scored a first and a second today and are currently first, by 3 points over Lara Vadlau and Jolanta Ogar (AUT). “You have to be paying attention all the time. I think that we did well downwind, and rounding the marks we could gain some points. It’s going well, lets see what happens in the next few days.\n\nOliveira also stressed staying sharp before races, especially when there are postponements and general recalls.\n\n“I think that a routine is the best way to keep focus on our goal,” she said. “We are trying to just be checking, all the time, the wind and the current, the courses if they change something, paying attention all the time. If you relax and relax and relax, and try to start it again, it’s complicated. The routine is the most important thing so you make all the times the same thing and then it’s easier to be ready to go.”\n\nWith the class’s world championship scheduled for next month in South America, the fleet at the Sailing World Cup Miami is smaller and not quite as deep as in past years. But Oliveira stressed that it’s just as important to stay focused.\n\n“We are trying to do our best; we are trying to train, to make this event like a training for the world championships,” said Oliveira. “But we have a lot of young teams here that are sailing very well, so we have to pay attention to them.”\n\nSome top Women’s 470 teams have skipped this event to rest for the world championships, but Oliveira said that with the pressure of a home Olympics looming on the horizon, she is happy to stay busy.\n\n“The pressure will come for all sailors, and for all Brazilian sailors also,” said Oliveira. “We have to keep paying attention. It will not be easy, it’s a special [Olympics]. I think we are OK; we already did a Games together so we have some experience as a team. In six months we’re going to be ready to go. From now until April, we have a lot of events, so there’s no time to be thinking on it.”\n\nSo the motto for the day: on the water, seek out the pressure; off the water, try to keep it at bay.\n\nIt was also the experienced Men’s 470 teams that rose to the top, with the top five teams in the overall standings after three races each featuring at least one former Olympian. At the head of the class is the home team, Stuart McNay and David Hughes, who won both races today by a combined 90 seconds. McNay is looking to head to his third Olympics this summer. Two points in arrears—each team has discarded its worst finish—are Onan Barreiros and Juan Curbelo Cabrera (ESP) with Matthias Schmid and Florian Reichstädter (AUT) in third.\n\nLaser and Laser Radial\n\nDutch sailor Rutger van Schaardenburg continued his solid start to the regatta with a first and sixth today. It was a slight step down from his 2-1 yesterday, but it was still the best score of the day, nipping Filip Jurišić (CRO) by virtue of a tiebreaker. Van Schaardenburg retains command of the overall lead, six points ahead of Jurišić. Behind the Croatian sailor, however, lies a tightly packed mob of top Laser talent; just 23 points separates second from 22nd. Included in that group is five-time Olympic medalist Robert Scheidt (BRA) in 13th and American medal hopeful Charlie Buckingham (USA) in 14th. Buckingham is in the first stage of the selection series for the U.S. Olympic Team. While US Sailing Team Sperry teammate Chris Barnard (USA) is not off to a good start, Erik Bowers (USA) is just 2 points behind Buckingham in the overall standings.
