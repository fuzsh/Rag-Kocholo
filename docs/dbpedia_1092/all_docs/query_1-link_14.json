        "text": "· The Monte Real Yacht Club organizes from March 29 to April 3 with the sponsorship of Cenor the most important event of national children’s sailing\n\n· There will be two days of preparation and four days of competition that will bring together 150 boys and girls from 10 autonomous communities in the Galician fishing village\n\n· Galicia is the region that will bring the most athletes into the fray, followed by Andalusia, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands and the Valencian Community\n\nThe fishing village of Baiona (Galicia) will host the Spanish Optimist Championship – Cenor Trophy, the most important event for national children’s sailing in 2021 at Easter. The Royal Spanish Sailing Federation has delegated the organization of the competition to the historic Monte Real Yacht Club, from March 29 to April 3.\n\nThe event, which will be held thanks to the sponsorship of the Cenor Group and with the collaboration of the Royal Galician Sailing Federation and the Spanish Association of the International Optimist Class (AECIO), will include two days of preparation and four days of competition, which will meet in Baiona to 150 boys and girls from 10 autonomous communities.\n\nGalicia will be the autonomy that puts the most sailors into contention, since to the 19 summoned by qualifying ranking, another 3 athletes will be added that the Royal Spanish Sailing Federation grants to the Galician community as organizer of the event. Thanks to this concession, the Galician team closed with a total of 22 contenders for the title.\n\nThey are followed in number of sailors by Andalusia, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands and the Community of Valencia, who will attend the national competition with 20 athletes each. Catalonia will compete with 19, Murcia with 11, the Basque Country and Cantabria with 6 each, and Madrid with 4.\n\nThere will be a total of 150 boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 15 who will compete for four days for the titles of best U16 and U13 athlete in the male and female categories. Within the framework of this championship, the Spanish Autonomy Championship will also compete, which will reward the community with the best results in the Optimist class.\n\nIn the official presentation of the event, held this morning in Baiona, the vice president of the Monte Real Yacht Club, Alejandro Retolaza, described the championship as “one more step in the objective of Monte Real to promote grassroots sailing, where it is – he said- the future of this sport” . Retolaza recalled when the club held the first Galician Optimist championship, in 1970: “Of the 17 children who participated in that edition we went to 120 last year, in the Optimist Galician; and this year we will have 150 in the national. Definitely -he assured- an evolution for which we feel very proud” .\n\nThe celebration of the Spanish Optimist Championship 2021 will be possible thanks to the sponsorship of the Galician appliance and technology group Cenor, which has maintained a firm commitment to sport for years. Its general director, Javier González, assured that “This event is one of the proposals to which we could not say no for several reasons: because it is in Baiona, because returning to the MRCYB after many years is a satisfaction and because children and sport is something that generates us great enthusiasm ” . “It is a pride for Cenor -he said- appear on this poster, and that our brand linked to sport be recognized” .\n\nFramed in times of COVID, the Spanish Optimist Championship 2021 – Cenor Trophy will have an extensive security protocol that will include measures for both the competition in the water and for the moments on land. Each community will have its reserved space so as not to mix with the rest and the traditional inaugural team parade will not be held. In addition, temperature controls will be carried out at the entrances to the club and the use of a mask, which is not mandatory in the water because it is sailed alone, but will be required on land and when approaching the port and other vessels.\n\nRegarding the sports development of the competition, the championship will include 2 days of preparation, on Monday 29 and Tuesday 30 March, for registration and measurements. The following three days, Wednesday March 31, Thursday April 1 and Friday April 2, will be devoted to a qualifying series from which the sailors who will compete in the final series on Saturday April 3 will come out.\n\nEach day will include a maximum of 3 tests, so, if all of them can be held, the national team would reveal its winners after 12 scoring rounds. On the last day of competition, Saturday April 3, the award ceremony for the winners will also be held, starting at six in the afternoon in the gardens of the Monte Real Club de Yates.\n\nAs a recreational-tourist complement to the competition, the sailors will be able to participate in a dramatized track race through the streets of Baiona. A tour that, with the aim of solving a riddle, will allow you to discover the ins and outs of discovery, to figures as prominent as Diego Carmona, Vasco Gallego, Isabel la Católica or Pinzón; and places like the Church of Santa María, the Monolito de la Arribada, the nuns’ fountain or the Pinta caravel, among others.\n\nOTHER DECLARATIONS OF THE OFFICIAL PRESENTATION\n\n“For us it has been, is and always will be a pleasure to work side by side with this club, and in the times we are experiencing, the events at Monte Real are a guarantee of quality and safety. What we are looking for is that all the people who come to visit us and participate in this regatta also get to know us a little more and, above all, our history”\n\nCarlos Gómez, Mayor of Bayonne\n\n“We want to praise Cenor’s commitment to sporting events and sports. Companies are essential for the development of these events, especially in times like the one we are living in, since betting on sport is betting on health. Baiona is a very active town and the MRCYB has shown in the last year that it is capable of organizing events in exceptional circumstances”\n\nGorka Gómez, sports deputy of the Pontevedra Provincial Council\n\n“The MRCYB is always a guarantee for its organizational capacity and for the great work they do. For the Xeral Secretariat for Sport, sailing is a sport with a lot of presence and we are in a modality that is the door to start, to grow. Galicia offers the possibility of sailing all year round and we want to lay all the foundations so that Galicians continue to enjoy it”\n\nDaniel Benavides, provincial head of sports of the Xunta de Galicia\n\n“It is an important championship for Galicia and to which we will come with our sailors from the Galician team. We hope that very good conditions can be enjoyed and that Galicia obtains great results”\n\nManuel Villaverde, president of the Royal Galician Sailing Federation\n\n“From the club we like that sports events are linked to another form of participation, so that the kids have a good time and it is a complete experience for them and not just a regatta. How could it be otherwise, we will have a strict prevention protocol for Covid-19 and we hope, as always, that there is a good wind and that everything goes normally “\n\nIgnacio Sánchez Otaegui, Commodore of the Monte Real Yacht Club\n\nOPTIMIST SPANISH CHAMPIONSHIP 2021 · CENOR TROPHY\n\nMONDAY, MARCH 29\n\n10:00 – 19:00> Regatta office.

Despite recovering pace in the other two, in which he achieved a second and a third place, he had to settle for the second step of the provisional podium.\n\nJust the opposite happened to Fernando Yáñez’s Cansino. It started strong, with a second place, but it lost steam as the regatta day progressed; and the fourth and eighth places that he signed in the rest of the races did not allow him to climb positions beyond the third place that he had dragged from the first stage.\n\nIn fourth position is Juan Carlos Ameneiro’s Alboroto, in which this Saturday the presence of the Spanish J80 champion, Javier Aguado, was noted. His good work helped the crew climb positions from 12th to 4th place. It was, without a doubt, the climb of the day, for one of the sailboats with the best results (one first, one second and one fourth in the tests held).\n\nClosing the Top 5 of the Baitra J80 Winter League we find Santiago Estevez’s Spaco, which does not change its position with respect to the first day. They are followed by Luna Nueva by Juan Luis Tuero; the SDN Cormorant of Francisco J. Martínez; and the Ferralemes by Jaime García.\n\nFurther down the classification we find Maija by José Luis Pérez; The Galley of Miguel Fernández; Rafael Blanco’s Due; Joao Nuno Allen’s Ifaclinic.com; and Jaime Barreiro’s Petrilla. And they close the list of Luis de Mira’s Namasté; the Pazo de Cea by Iago Carballo; the Miudo by Nacho Salgueiro and the Mondo by Bernardo Macedo.\n\nThe Baitra J80 Winter League organized by the Monte Real Club de Yates with the sponsorship of Baitra Accesorios Navales will return to the bay of Baiona on April 10 with three new tests that will take the monotypes into the halfway point of the competition.\n\nPreviously, the Monte Real will host the Spanish Optimist Championship during Easter, between March 31 and April 3, which will be officially presented next Tuesday at one in the afternoon at the club’s facilities.\n\nBAITRA J80 WINTER LEAGUE MONTE REAL YACHT CLUB\n\nClassification after the second day held on March 20\n\n1.

The organization of the circuit, one of the three most important nautical events in the world, has decided to cancel all the regattas scheduled for the start of the 2021 season, including those that were to be held in Galicia .\n\nThe situation derived from COVID19, the numerous restrictions that are still in force in numerous points and the great efforts necessary to guarantee a safe event in the midst of the pandemic are behind a decision that the Monte Real Club de Yates, which was going to host of the event next June, they greatly regret.\n\nFor the president of the historic Baion club, José Luis Álvarez, it is a shame not to be able to count on this prestigious circuit this year in Galicia, but he is confident – he said – that the COVID situation will improve in the coming months and allow the BAIONA to be held SAILING WEEK in 2022.\n\nÁlvarez said he understands the circumstances that have led the organization to make this decision and conveyed to the organizers the club’s commitment to the circuit. “In 2022 -said the president of Monte Real- We will be more prepared than ever to receive the SUPER SERIES and it will be an equally special edition, since it will coincide with the Xacobeo extended by COVID until next year”.\n\nWith high performance and great international prestige, the 52 SUPER SERIES are one of the three most important nautical events in the world, along with the America’s Cup and the World Sailing Tour.

The organization of each of the stages involves the movement of some 500 people, up to 12 megayachts and numerous support boats.\n\n“The suspension of the Saint Tropez, Baiona and Cascais regattas has been a very difficult decision to make, but the circuit attracts teams from all over the world and there is still not enough certainty to ensure a safe and competitive event.

Some time ago we could see him carrying the Miudo by Storax rod, also in the J80 league; and on this occasion another of the new additions to the Baiona J80 fleet will board Joao Nuno Allen’s Ifaclinic.com.\n\nAlso with a Portuguese accent, Manuel María Cunha’s Marías (with José Valentim Cunha, José María Cunha, Antonio María Cunha and Vasco Tinoco) will participate in the Baitra J80 Winter League; whom we will foreseeably see giving war to Javier de la Gándara’s Okofen, aspiring to revalidate the title achieved in 2020. It is the boat that has the most titles in J80 del Monte Real leagues and will take Gándara’s sons Jaime and Javier, and Diego Fernández on board.\n\nThe crews that last year won silver and bronze in the winter one-design competition, Juan Carlos Ameneiro’s Alboroto and José Luis Pérez’s Maija, also repeat in this new edition and will be, if they manage to maintain their good track record, two of the boats that we will surely see in the highest positions of the classification.\n\nJuan José Lago and Javier Lago remain in the Alboroto de Juan Carlos Ameneiro, and another historical sailor in Galicia is added as a novelty, Miguel Lago, who for a long time sailed in J80 and who lately is common to see with the fleet of the 6 meters.\n\nCompleting the list of contenders to win the Baitra J80 Winter League are Santiago Estévez’s Spaco (with Pablo Franco, José Quiñones and Javier Martínez), Fernando Yáñez’s Cansino (with Manuel Fernández, Alejandra Suárez, Pilar Fernanda Amaro and Ignacio Sánchez Otaegui ), Juan Luis Tuero’s Luna Nueva (with Miguel Cidras, Rogelio Torres and Pedro Núñez), Rosario García’s Ferralemes (with Jaime García, Oswaldo Álvarez and Roberto Montero), Luis de Mira’s Namasté (with Susana Baena, Amparo Molla, Luis Gutierrez and Javier Torroja), the Pazo de Cea by Iago Carballo (with Rita Hernández, Cristina González, María González and Carolina Terrón) and the SND Cormorán by Francisco Javier Martínez (with Julio Hidalgo, Alfonso Otero, Miguel Alonso).

It also facilitates procedures such as boat rental or the processing of nautical insurance in other countries.\n\nIts training method is eminently practical, focused on real navigation, and a student-instructor ratio that does not exceed 5 to 1, which guarantees a more complete training and personalized attention. International certificates are also awarded through a demanding practical test with a qualified examiner on board.\n\nCourses on “Competent crew” (course for crew members who want to go from being passengers to being active members of the crew, which is carried out on board a sailboat for 5 days, learning navigation techniques, and which enables them to navigate daytime crossings in familiar waters), “Day skipper” (course for aspiring skippers with experience in sailing equivalent to the PER qualification but more practical and in English, which enables day and night coastal navigation), “Coastal skipper” (course that requires a greater number of requirements to obtain the title and that provides theoretical knowledge equivalent to a yacht skipper, to navigate day and night voyages without losing sight of the coast) and that of “Yachtmaster offshore” (course for expert sailors who will be able to act as skippers in sailboats of up to 200gt and 150 miles from the coast),\n\nThe Baionese club will be able to offer these courses thanks to an agreement signed with the Julio Verne Náutica company, which will be in charge of providing training, both theoretical and practical, at the Monte Real facilities.\n\nThe process of homologation of the courses has suffered a delay due to the situation derived from COVID19, but it is expected to culminate in the near future and it will be this year when they begin to be taught in Baiona.\n\nIn addition to turning it into an RYA training center, the agreement signed with Julio Verne Náutica will also allow Monte Real to complement its training offer with the possibility of obtaining the Navigation license , the GNP , the PER , the extension of the powers of the PER or the qualifications of Skipper and Yachtsman .\n\nAlso, at the club’s Cruise Sailing School, new training will begin on route planning, meteorology, night navigation and watchkeeping, or electronic aids, among others . In all of them, as in the RYA courses and in obtaining the rest of the qualifications, Monte Real members will have priority access to the courses and special discounts on their prices.\n\nMore information: 986 385 000 / secretaria@mrcyb.com\n\n(Photo © David Fontan)\n\n· The new regulations approved by the Xunta de Galicia further restrict the practice of sports in our community\n\n· The impossibility of maintaining courses and training normally has forced the Sailing School to temporarily suspend its activity\n\n· The restrictions published this Tuesday in the Official Gazette of Galicia will last until next February 17\n\nThe tightening of the restrictions derived from the serious situation of COVID19 in Galicia has forced the temporary suspension of the activity of the Monte Real Club de Yates Sailing School.\n\nThe new regulations approved by the Xunta de Galicia and published yesterday, Tuesday, in an extraordinary edition of the Official Gazette of Galicia , further restrict the practice of sports in our community and make it impossible to maintain courses and activities as usual.\n\nTo the obligation to maintain the safety distance, wear a mask at all times, not exceed the perimeter closures of the municipalities, comply with the “curfew” set at 10:00 p.m. and not use changing rooms or classrooms, now add the demands that all activities be exclusively outdoors, keeping all indoor facilities closed; and are practiced only individually.\n\nThe obvious repercussions that this has on the Sailing School have forced the club to suspend its activity until the restrictions are relaxed and allow courses and training to resume normally, at which time an attempt will be made to recover the classes that have been lost during this January.\n\nThe Baitra J80 Winter League, included in the group of regional sports competitions that have been suspended due to COVID19, is also still on standby without having a return date set for the moment.\n\nFrom the Monte Real Club de Yates we hope that you are all well and that the serious health situation in which Galicia finds itself today can be resolved, with the support and help of all, as soon as possible.\n\nDOG No. 16-Bis / Tuesday, January 26, 2021 / Page 4683\n\n3.15.

So far, all had shown their usual regularity. All but one, the Monte Real Club de Yates team that has been superior from the beginning in its waters and with a one-design that shows they know perfectly. The regattas of the crew led by Manuel María Cunha, together with Jaime de la Gándara, Antonio María Cunha, Vasco Tinoco and Marta Ramada, have been counted by victories throughout the qualifying series, ascending from eighth to fifth position in the provisional upon completion of these.\n\nThe moment of truth had arrived. Arrecife won the first of the final regattas, followed by Valencia and Baiona, which did not alter the positions in the table but brought the team from Monte Real a little closer to fourth position. Those from Cunha pressed the accelerator again and a new first in their locker, a third from Gran Canaria and a fifth from Torrevieja put those from Gran Canaria on the third step of the podium, those from Monte Real in fourth position and dropped to those of Torrevieja up to the fifth.\n\nThe first two places were decided, the Real Club Náutico de Valencia was the virtual winner of the Loterías y Apuestas del Estado Trophy ahead of the Real Club Náutico de Arrecife, but the third step of the podium was still up in the air and three teams with a margin of two points between them.\n\nThe Monte Real Club de Yates de Baiona won the last regatta followed by the RCN de Arrecife and the RCN Gran Canaria, thus signing a splendid final and achieving a deserved third place in the general classification.\n\nThe team from the Real Club Náutico de Arrecife, led by Gonzalo Morales together with Fátima Diz, Roberto Molina, Tomás Fuentes and Ricardo Terrades, were unable to retain the title, but did secure a convincing second place.\n\nAnd the Real Club Náutico de Valencia sealed its first participation in the Spanish Sailing League with a victory cultivated from the first bars. Axel Rodger, Pau Chirivella, Antonio Puig, Quicorras Urios and Mª José Algarra received their well-deserved winner’s trophy from the president of the Royal Spanish Sailing Federation, Julia Casanueva, and the president of Monte Real, José Luís Álvarez.\n\nThe sports delegate of the Pontevedra Provincial Council, Gorka Gómez, accompanied the mayor of Baiona, Carlos Gómez, in the delivery of the trophy to the second-placed Real Club Náutico de Arrecife.\n\nAnd the head of the Provincial Sports Service of the Xunta de Galicia, Daniel Benavides, together with José Luís Álvarez, handed over the third-placed prize to the Monte Real Yacht Club team.\n\nJulia Casanueva, president of the Royal Spanish Sailing Federation, recognized the success of this new edition of the Spanish Sailing League and the achievement of its objectives: “The RFEV had been trying to start this project for several years and thanks to State Lotteries and Bets last year we managed to start it.\n\nIt is a great initiative, the proof is in the incorporation of new crews this year. With the complex year we are experiencing, we have 11 teams that have opted for La Liga. In addition, it is noteworthy that there are many very young crew members who are joining older crews and this is very important; we are achieving what we wanted: to connect sailing between the different generations. There is a great projection also at European level because this league will continue in the European League and this greatly encourages all athletes “.\n\nAxel Rodger, skipper of the RCN Valencia team, was proud of the success of his crew and was grateful for the celebration of the State Lottery and Betting Trophy, the Spanish Sailing League, “because it has been a complicated year in which we have sailed very little. We appreciate the courage shown by the RFEV, the CN of Calpe and the MRCY of Baiona, in addition to the support of Loterías y Apuestas del Estado for this event”.\n\nClassification II SPANISH SAILING LEAGUE – State Lottery and Betting Trophy\n\n1 RCN Valencia/ Axel Rodger: 57.20 pts\n\n2 RCN Arrecife / Gonzalo Morales: 63 pts\n\n3 MRCY Baiona / Manuel Maria Cunha: 74.95 pts\n\n4 RCN of Gran Canaria / Onán Barreiros: 77 pts\n\n5 RCN Torrevieja / José Manuel Ballester: 82 pts\n\n6 CN Altea / Alejandro Arroyo: 103.20 pts\n\n7 RCN Calpe / Juan Carlos Albelda: 80.25 pts\n\n8 RCN Palma / Albert Torres: 82.45 pts\n\n9 RCR Alicante / Nacho Campos: 83.50 pts\n\n10 CN El Balís / Bárbara Cornudella: 87.20 pts\n\n11 CN Campello / Iván Moreno: 106.95 pts"
