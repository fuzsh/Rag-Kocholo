        "meta_description": "In the early 20th century, the British Club was the center of the social life of the British expatriate community in Gran Canaria, one of the islands in the Canary Islands archipelago. Located next to the Metropole Hotel in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, and close to the English (Protestant) Church, it was a place for leisure and recreation as well as for business meetings for its members. This photograph from the 1890s shows elegantly dressed men and women dancing at a garden party at the club. In the background to the left is the Atlantic Ocean. Among the famous British visitors to the Canary Islands was the novelist and mystery writer Agatha Christie, who spent several weeks there in 1927, staying at the Metropole. Two of her collections of short stories, The Mysterious Mr. Quin (1930) and The Thirteen Problems (1932), are partly set in the islands. The photograph is in the collections of the Foundation for the Ethnography and the Development of Canarian Crafts (FEDAC).",
