        "text": "The big story out of Austin today is well…Austin. With the 20th anniversary of the SXSW Film Festival, the Texans are making quite the showing amongst the 109 features that will be gracing the screens of the Paramount, the State and the Drafthouse between March 8th through 16th. From recent Sundance hits such as Richard Linklater’s “Before Midnight,” Jeff Nichols’ “Mud,” Hannah Fidell’s “A Teacher” and Yen Tan’s “Pit Stop” to world premieres of Jacob Vaughan’s comedy “Milo,” Bryan Poyser’s “The Bounceback,” and Geoff Marslett’s “Loves Her Gun,” the festival will offer up plenty of local flavor amidst an already incredibly exciting lineup that sees the return of past SXSW favorites whether it’s the U.S. premiere of “Cabin in the Woods” scribe Joss Whedon’s “Much Ado About Nothing,” the North American premiere of regular attendee John Sayles’ “Go for Sisters” or “We Always Lie to Strangers,” the long-gestating documentary about Branson from “Gigantic” director AJ Schnack and David Wilson.\n\nIn the statement accompanying the lineup announcement, Festival Producer Janet Pierson said, “It’s an incredible privilege to sift through so much exciting work, and every year brings new surprises. Though trends emerge after the fact, not consciously while we’re programming, much of this year’s program embraces love and the need/search/desire for connection. Many films reflect importantly on our culture and include intimate looks at iconic figures, and we’re lucky to have a plethora of hugely entertaining and audience pleasing films. Even more thrilling is the opportunity to support so many filmmakers we’ve followed for years who’ve made enormous creative leaps in their work.”\n\nIndeed, as the festival enters its third decade, the establishment of an identity apart from other festivals, not to mention their own wildly popular music and interactive festivals, is the most impressive aspect of today’s lineup announcement, a place where some of the most promising filmmakers around feel comfortable returning to and inviting a host of new ones to the weeklong party.
