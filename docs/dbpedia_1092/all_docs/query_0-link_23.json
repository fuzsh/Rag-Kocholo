        "text": "Surgical ablation of ventricular tachycardia secondary to congenital ventricular septal aneurysm.\n\nPubMed\n\nGraffigna, A; Minzioni, G; Ressia, L; Vigano, M\n\n1994-04-01\n\nThree patients underwent surgical ablation for ventricular tachycardia resulting from an aneurysm of the membranous portion of the ventricular septum. Two patients had a definite history of cardiac murmur during infancy, and one of them was found at the time of operation to have a left-to-right shunt through the apex of the aneurysm. The earliest ventricular activation sites were located around the neck of the aneurysm and were ablated in 1 patient by encircling the endocardial ventriculotomy and by cryoablation in the remaining 2. After focus resection had been completed, aneurysm resection and ventricular septal reconstruction were performed. All patients were alive and free of ventricular tachycardia and did not need medication as of 61, 66, and 88 months postoperatively. Spontaneous closure of a ventricular septal defect may lead to the formation of an aneurysm in the ventricular septum that may sustain ventricular tachycardias. Such arrhythmias can be effectively treated using electrically guided surgical techniques.\n\nThe chance finding of a ventricular septal defect in a 2-day-old newborn infant.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatanÃ¨, Salvatore; Marte, Filippo; Dattilo, Giuseppe; Tulino, Viviana; Pagano, Giuseppina Tindara; Sturiale, Mauro\n\n2011-11-03\n\nCertain congenital cardiac defects may go undetected for several years due to lack of symptoms and signs.Ventricular septal defects can occur as part of more congenital cardiac malformations or as an isolate finding. The natural history of ventricular septal defects depends on the size of the defect and on the pulmonary resistance. We present a case of the chance finding of a ventricular septal defect in a 2-day-old newborn infant with an interatrial septal aneurysm. Copyright Â© 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A total of 43 patients with membranous ventricular septal defect complicated with tricuspid regurgitation were observed by echocardiography and the changes in length, area and volume of tricuspid regurgitation prior to and following ventricular septal defect occlusion were measured. There were four different mechanisms of membranous ventricular septal defect complicated with tricuspid regurgitation. The various indices of tricuspid regurgitation volume were significantly reduced following occlusion. Ventricular septal defect occlusion significantly reduces tricuspid regurgitation volume complicated with membranous ventricular septal defect and echocardiography is an ideal method to detect these changes.

It is not surprising that few reports exist in the literature, so that prevalence of these anomalies is unknown in wild species. We report a case of a ventricular septal defect documented in a free-ranging crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). This animal presented with rapid, labored breathing, and on physical examination, pulmonary crackles and a holosystolic murmur were auscultated. The echocardiogram with Doppler showed discontinuity of the dorsal section of the ventricular septum, which allowed a turbulent systolic flow to move from the left to the right ventricle. The postmortem examination confirmed the absence of a dorsal connection between the septum and the atrioventricular junction, and pronounced left ventricular myocardial dilation was observed on histopathology. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect in a crab-eating fox.\n\n[A case report of a ventricular septal defect with congenital portosystemic venous shunt].\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshino, Hiroomi; Kayashima, Kenji; Yamamoto, Katsumi; Okada, Hisano; Kataoka, Kazunori; Kinoshita, Yuki; Ikezaki, Akira\n\n2010-11-01\n\nA three-month-old baby boy was scheduled for a ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair. The patient was complicated with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and congenital portosystemic venous shunt (CPSVS). Because it was unclear whether the CPSVS was the main cause of the PH or not, the PH was treated with ordinary methods for the management of anesthesia for VSD patients with PH. He underwent the repair of the VSD, and his postoperative course was uneventful. The mechanism of PH in patients with CPSVS is different from that in those with VSD. We speculated that his pulmonary arteries were not affected with the CPSVS, because no PH was observed after the repair of VSD. Fresh frozen plasma was effective for hemostasis during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, because he could not produce enough coagulation factors.\n\nSimultaneous transcatheter treatment of perimembranous ventricular septal defect and other congenital cardiopathies.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Xu-Dong; Bai, Yuan; Chen, Xiao-Li; Liu, Su-Xuan; Zhao, Xian-Xian; Qin, Yong-Wen\n\n2014-12-01\n\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of simultaneous transcatheter corrections of perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) and other congenital cardiopathies. From 2004 to 2012, 56 patients (25 male, 31 female), aged 14.2Â±10.1, with compound congenital cardiovascular abnormalities underwent simultaneous transcatheter interventional procedure. Of the 56 patients, 32 had VSD and atrial septal defects (ASD); 17 had VSD and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA); and seven had VSD and pulmonary valve stenosis (PS). Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (PBPV) was performed before the closure of VSD, PDA, or ASD. The combined transcatheter interventional procedure was successfully performed in all patients. Among these, two occluders were implanted in each of 49 patients, seven patients with VSD combined with PS underwent successfully balloon valvuloplasty and VSD closure. The size of VSD, ASD and PDA detected by TTE was 4.8Â±1.7 mm, 9.0Â±5.0 mm and 4.5Â±2.5 mm, respectively. The occluder diameter of VSD, ASD and PDA was 7.6Â±2.2 mm, 14.3Â±6.2 mm and 7.9Â±3.2 mm, respectively. The peak-to-peak transpulmonary gradient decreased from 60.4Â±19.7 mmHg to 15.0Â±5.0 mmHg (p<0.001) in seven patients with VSD combined with PS. One patient with VSD and ASD had a permanent pacemaker implanted because of third-degree atrioventricular block two months after the procedure. There were not serious adverse events in relation to the combined procedures during the 23.8Â±20.7 months of follow-up in other 55 patients. The simultaneous treatment of VSD and other congenital cardiopathies using transcatheter-based procedures is safe and effective, which can provide satisfactory results.

M.\n\n1970-01-01\n\nSuccessful surgical correction of the complex anomaly of interruption of the aortic arch and intracardiac ventricular septal defect is reported. The patient was a boy 5 years old when he first came under treatment. The total correction was performed in two stages. At the first operation, at the age of 7 years, continuity of the aortic arch was achieved by insertion of a Teflon graft, employing left heart bypass. The ventricular septal defect was closed at the age of 13 years on total cardiopulmonary bypass. Two and half years after the total correction the boy is alive and well. The difficulties in diagnosing the condition are discussed. The role of left heart bypass is emphasized.

Coronary CT angiography images of 2093 adult patients were evaluated retrospectively in order to determine congenital left ventricular wall abnormalities. The incidence of left ventricular clefts (LVC) was 6.7% (141 patients) and statistically signiï¬cant difference was not detected between the sexes regarding LVC (P=0.5). LVCs were single in 65.2% and multiple in 34.8% of patients. They were located at the basal to mid inferoseptal segment of the left ventricle in 55.4%, the basal to mid anteroseptal segment in 24.1%, basal to mid inferior segment in 17% and septal-apical septal segment in 3.5% of cases. The cleft length ranged from 5 to 22 mm (mean 10.5 mm) and they had a narrow connection with the left ventricle (mean 2.5 mm). They were contractile with the left ventricle and obliterated during systole. Congenital left ventricular septal aneurysm that was located just under the aortic valve was detected in two patients (0.1%). No case of congenital left ventricular diverticulum was detected. Cardiac CT allows us to recognize congenital left ventricular wall abnormalities which have been previously overlooked in adults. LVC is a congenital structural variant of the myocardium, is seen more frequently than previously reported and should be differentiated from aneurysm and diverticulum for possible catastrophic complications of the latter two.

Methods and Results To identify a more favorable pacing strategy with fewer adverse effects, 80 patients who had complete atrioventricular block with normal cardiac function and who were treated with either RVAP (n=42) or RVOT septal pacing (n=38) were recruited after an average of 2 years of followâup. The data from electrocardiography and echocardiography performed before pacemaker implantation and at the end of followâup were collected. The patients in the RVOT septal pacing and RVAP groups showed similar demographic and clinical characteristics before pacing treatments. After a mean followâup of 2 years, the final maximum Pâwave duration; Pâwave dispersion; Qâ, Râ, and Sâwave complex duration; left atrial volume index; left ventricular endâsystolic diameter; ratio of transmitral early diastolic filling velocity to mitral annular early diastolic velocity; and interventricular mechanical delay in the RVOT septal pacing group were significantly less than those in the RVAP group (P<0.05). The final left ventricular ejection fraction of the RVOT septal pacing group was significantly higher than that of the RVAP group (P<0.05). Conclusions Compared with RVAP, RVOT septal pacing has fewer adverse effects regarding atrial electrical activity and structure in patients with normal cardiac function. PMID:25896891\n\nAnatomy of the ventricular septal defect in outflow tract defects: similarities and differences.\n\nPubMed\n\nMostefa-Kara, Meriem; Bonnet, Damien; Belli, Emre; Fadel, Elie; Houyel, Lucile\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe study objective was to analyze the anatomy of the ventricular septal defect found in various phenotypes of outflow tract defects. We reviewed 277 heart specimens with isolated outlet ventricular septal defect without subpulmonary stenosis (isolated outlet ventricular septal defect, 19); tetralogy of Fallot (71); tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (51); common arterial trunk (54); double outlet right ventricle (65) with subaortic, doubly committed, or subpulmonary ventricular septal defect; and interrupted aortic arch type B (17). Special attention was paid to the rims of the ventricular septal defect viewed from the right ventricular side and the relationships between the tricuspid and aortic valves. The ventricular septal defect was always located in the outlet of the right ventricle, between the 2 limbs of the septal band. There was a fibrous continuity between the tricuspid and aortic valves in 74% of specimens with isolated outlet ventricular septal defect, 66% of specimens with tetralogy of Fallot, 39% of specimens with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, 4.6% of specimens with double outlet right ventricle, 1.8% of specimens with common arterial trunk, and zero of specimens with interrupted aortic arch type B (P < .005). When present, this continuity always involved the anterior tricuspid leaflet. The ventricular septal defect in outflow tract defects is always an outlet ventricular septal defect, cradled between the 2 limbs of the septal band. However, there are some differences regarding the posteroinferior and superior rims of the ventricular septal defect. These differences suggest an anatomic continuum from the isolated outlet ventricular septal defect to the interrupted aortic arch type B rather than distinct physiologic phenotypes, related to various degrees of abnormal rotation of the outflow tract during heart development: minimal in isolated outlet ventricular septal defect; incomplete in tetralogy of Fallot, tetralogy of Fallot\n\nLeft ventricular rotation and torsion in patients with perimembranous ventricular septal defect.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhuang, Yan; Yong, Yong-hong; Yao, Jing; Ji, Ling; Xu, Di\n\n2014-03-01\n\nAssessment of left ventricular (LV) rotation has become an important approach for quantifying LV function. In this study, we sought to analyze LV rotation and twist using speckle tracking imaging (STI) in adult patients with isolated ventricular septal defects. Using STI, the peak rotation and time to peak rotation of 6 segments in basal and apical short-axis were measured, respectively, in 32 patients with ventricular septal defect and 30 healthy subjects as controls. The global rotation of the 6 segments in basal and apical and LV twist versus time profile were drawn, the peak rotation and twist of LV were calculated. All the time to peak rotation/twist were expressed as a percentage of end-systole (end-systole = 100%). Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by biplane Simpson method. In patients group, the peak rotation of posterior, inferior, and postsept wall in basal was higher(P â¤ 0.05) and LV twist was also higher (P â¤ 0.05) than healthy controls. There were no significant differences between 2 groups in the peak rotation of the other 9 segments and left ventricular ejection fraction. Different from the control group, the time to peak rotation of the 6 segments in basal were delayed and the global rotation of the base was delayed (P â¤ 0.05) in ventricular septal defect group. Left ventricular volume overload due to ventricular septal defect has significant effect on LV rotation and twist, and LV rotation and twist may be a new index predicting LV systolic function.

This anomaly is reported infrequently in human patients and was identified in a 45-day-old Humboldt Penguin, Spheniscus humboldti, with signs of poor growth and a cardiac murmur. This case report describes the findings in this penguin and summarises the anatomy and classification of this cardiac anomaly.

Clinical data including clinical examination, electrocardiography daily after the procedure for a week, chest-X-rays and TTE before discharge and at 3-5 days after the procedure were analyzed from 604 patients underwent percutaneous closure of a pmVSD with MDVO at our department between December 2001 and December 2008. Procedure was successful in 576 out of 604 patients (95.4%) and 583 VSD occluders were placed. Endocarditis, thromboembolism, or deaths were not observed after procedure. Conduction block occurred in 81 patients (56 RBBB, 14 LBBB) and transient nonparoxysmal ventricular tachycardia in 31 patients after the procedure. Complete heart block occurred in 11 patients, 9 of them recovered in 3 weeks, permanent pacemaker was implanted in 2 patients (one had transient III degrees AVB before the procedure, the other underwent simultaneous closure of ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect). Trivial/small residual shunts were found in 69 patients (12.0%). The residual shunts disappeared in 31 patients and remained unchanged in 38 patients (6.6%) 7 days after procedures. Aortic regurgitation developed in 5 patients (2 trivial/small, 3 small/moderate), and tricuspid regurgitation was present in 35 patients (32 trivial/small, 3 moderate). Five patients developed haemolysis (device retrieved via catheter in 1 patient due to persistent haemolysis, the other 4 patients recovered 3-14 days post procedure). Pseudoaneurysm of femoral artery occurred in 1 patient, and disappeared by pressure dressing. Device was successfully replaced in 2 patients with either device embolization (n = 1) or device misplacement (n = 1) after device retrieval by catheter. It is safe and effective to close congenital perimembranous ventricular septal defect with domestic-made occluder device.\n\nRegional and global right ventricular dysfunction in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with congenitally corrected transposition.\n\nPubMed\n\nTulevski, Igor I; Zijta, Frank M; Smeijers, Anika S; Dodge-Khatami, Ali; van der Wall, Ernst E; Mulder, Barbara J M\n\n2004-04-01\n\nPatients with congenitally corrected transposition are at risk of right ventricular dysfunction and failure. With this in mind, we examined 13 patients with congenitally corrected transposition, 7 not having undergone surgery, and 6 after physiological repair, comparing them with 6 healthy subjects matched for age and sex, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, at rest and during dobutamine stress, in order to determine regional and global right ventricular response to stress. At rest, the patients had significantly decreased overall wall motion compared to their healthy peers (7.2 +/- 0.5, versus 9.8 +/- 0.4 mm). During infusion of dobutamine, overall wall motion increased to 12.8 +/- 0.4 mm in the healthy subjects, versus 8.8 +/- 1.0 mm in patients. At the regional level, significant differences in mural motion were found between patients and controls in the anterior (9.5 +/- 1.1, versus 13.2 +/- 0.6 mm), posterior (10.2 +/- 1.6, versus 13.2 +/- 0.8 mm), and septal segments (5.0 +/- 0.8, versus 11.2 +/- 0.6 mm). At rest, overall mural thickening in patients was similar to that of controls, but significantly less in patients during stress. During dobutamine stress, patients showed significantly less regional wall thickening than controls, particularly in the septal (2.7 +/- 0.6, versus 6.0 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively) and in the anterior segments (4.2 +/- 0.6, versus 7.8 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively). Right ventricular ejection fraction strongly correlated with mural motion and thickening, both at rest and during stress. Abnormal regional function in the systemic morphologically right ventricle may occur in patients with congenitally corrected transposition, which strongly correlates with right ventricular ejection fraction. Our findings support the hypothesis that, in patients with congenitally corrected transposition, ischemia of the right ventricular myocardium contributes to the development of right ventricular dysfunction.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging at a high field strength of ventricular septal defects in infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaker, E J; Ayton, V; Smith, M A; Parsons, J M; Ladusans, E J; Anderson, R H; Maisey, M N; Tynan, M; Fagg, N L; Deverall, P B\n\n1989-10-01\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging at a high field strength has potential benefits for the study of the heart in infants, which is when most congenital heart disease presents. Seventeen infants with various anatomical types of ventricular septal defect were studied by this technique. Good quality, high resolution, images were obtained in every case. There were no major practical problems. The morphology of the defects in all 17 hearts was displayed in great detail. In some instances, the interpretation of the images resembled that of equivalent images from cross sectional echocardiography. But this new technique allowed imaging in planes that cannot be obtained by echocardiography. One particularly valuable plane gave a face on view of the inlet and trabecular components of the septum. This allowed very precise localisation of defects in these areas. The relation between the defects and the atrioventricular and arterial valves was exceptionally well shown in various different imaging planes. One patient in the series had multiple trabecular defects that were clearly shown. Magnetic resonance imaging gives detailed morphological information about ventricular septal defects.\n\nTranscatheter closure of ventricular septal defect with Occlutech Duct Occluder.\n\nPubMed\n\nAtik-Ugan, Sezen; Saltik, Irfan Levent\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPatent ductus arteriosus occluders are used for transcatheter closure of ventricular septal defects, as well as for closure of patent ductus arteriosus.

We treated three patients with post-traumatic ventricular septal defects caused by stab wounds with knives. After the heart wound was repaired, patient examinations revealed ventricular septal defects with pulmonary/systemic flow ratios (Qp/Qs) of over 1.7. The post-traumatic ventricular septal defects were closed percutaneously with a patent ductus arteriosus occluder (Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., LTD, Guangdong, China) utilizing standard techniques. Post-operative transthoracic echocardiography revealed no residual left-to-right shunt and indicated normal ventricular function. In addition, 320-slice computerized tomography showed that the occluder was well placed and exhibited normal morphology. Our experiences indicate that closure of a post-traumatic ventricular septal defect using a patent ductus arteriosus occluder is feasible, safe, and effective.\n\nPercutaneous closure of a post-traumatic ventricular septal defect with a patent ductus arteriosus occluder\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXi, Er-Ping; Zhu, Jian; Zhu, Shui-Bo; Yin, Gui-Lin; Liu, Yong; Dong, Yong-Qiang; Zhang, Yu; Xia, Feng\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: Ventricular septal defects resulting from post-traumatic cardiac injury are very rare.

A single observer evaluated 31 patients, with a mean age of 52.09 months, standard deviation of 55, and with a range from 2 to 264 months, with atrioventricular septal defects, of whom 17 were boys. Ventricular imbalance, observed in nine patients, was determined by two-dimensional assessment, and confirmed at surgical inspection in selected cases when a univentricular strategy was undertaken. Offline analysis using multiplanar re-formatting was performed. A line was drawn though the length of the ventricular septum and a second line along the plane of the atrial septum, taking the angle between these two lines as the atrioventricular septal angle. We compared the angle between 22 patients with adequately sized ventricles, and those with ventricular imbalance undergoing univentricular repair. In the 22 patients undergoing biventricular repair, the septal angle was 0 in 14 patients; the other eight patients having angles ranging from 1 to 36, with a mean angle of 7.4Â°, and standard deviation of 11.1Â°.The mean angle in the nine patients with ventricle imbalance was 28.6Â°, with a standard deviation of 3.04Â°, and with a range from 26 to 35Â°. Of those undergoing univentricular repair, two patients died, with angles of 26 and 30Â°, respectively. The atrioventricular septal angle derived via multiplanar formatting gives important information regarding the degree of ventricular hypoplasia and imbalance. When this angle is above 25Â°, patients are likely to have ventricular imbalance requiring univentricular repair.\n\nGenome-wide copy number variant analysis for congenital ventricular septal defects in Chinese Han population.\n\nPubMed\n\nAn, Yu; Duan, Wenyuan; Huang, Guoying; Chen, Xiaoli; Li, Li; Nie, Chenxia; Hou, Jia; Gui, Yonghao; Wu, Yiming; Zhang, Feng; Shen, Yiping; Wu, Bailin; Wang, Hongyan\n\n2016-01-08\n\nVentricular septal defects (VSDs) constitute the most prevalent congenital heart disease (CHD), occurs either in isolation (isolated VSD) or in combination with other cardiac defects (complex VSD). Copy number variation (CNV) has been highlighted as a possible contributing factor to the etiology of many congenital diseases. However, little is known concerning the involvement of CNVs in either isolated or complex VSDs. We analyzed 154 unrelated Chinese individuals with VSD by chromosomal microarray analysis. The subjects were recruited from four hospitals across China. Each case underwent clinical assessment to define the type of VSD, either isolated or complex VSD. CNVs detected were categorized into syndrom related CNVs, recurrent CNVs and rare CNVs. Genes encompassed by the CNVs were analyzed using enrichment and pathway analysis. Among 154 probands, we identified 29 rare CNVs in 26 VSD patients (16.9 %, 26/154) and 8 syndrome-related CNVs in 8 VSD patients (5.2 %, 8/154). 12 of the detected 29 rare CNVs (41.3 %) were recurrently reported in DECIPHER or ISCA database as associated with either VSD or general heart disease. Fifteen genes (5 %, 15/285) within CNVs were associated with a broad spectrum of complicated CHD. Among these15 genes, 7 genes were in \"abnormal interventricular septum morphology\" derived from the MGI (mouse genome informatics) database, and nine genes were associated with cardiovascular system development (GO:0072538).We also found that these VSD-related candidate genes are enriched in chromatin binding and transcription regulation, which are the biological processes underlying heart development. Our study demonstrates the potential clinical diagnostic utility of genomic imbalance profiling in VSD patients. Additionally, gene enrichment and pathway analysis helped us to implicate VSD related candidate genes.\n\nThree pledget technique for closure of muscular ventricular septal defects.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharma, Rajesh; Katewa, Ashish\n\n2012-07-01\n\nWe propose a modification of the simple, horizontal mattress, pledgetted suture technique for closing the small muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) by interposing an oversized third pledget on the left ventricular (LV) aspect of the defect.\n\nPercutaneous treatment of atrial septal defects, muscular ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus in infants under one year of age.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrada, Fredy; Mortera, Carlos; Bartrons, Joaquim; Rissech, Miguel; JimÃ©nez, Lorenzo; Carretero, Juan; Llevadias, Judit; Araica, Mireya\n\n2009-09-01\n\nAmplatzer devices are used for the percutaneous closure of ostium secundum atrial septal defects, muscular ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus. However, very little experience has been gained in using these devices in infants under 1 year of age. Between January 2001 and January 2008, 22 symptomatic infants aged under 1 year underwent percutaneous treatment: three had an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, 15 had patent ductus arteriosus, and four had a muscular ventricular septal defect. All the procedures were completed successfully. No immediate or medium-term complications were observed. Closure of these types of defect using an Amplatzer device in infants under 1 year of age, who would otherwise require surgery, is a safe and effective procedure.\n\nComparison of right ventricular septal pacing and right ventricular apical pacing in patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators: the SEPTAL CRT Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeclercq, Christophe; Sadoul, Nicolas; Mont, Lluis; Defaye, Pascal; Osca, Joaquim; Mouton, Elisabeth; Isnard, Richard; Habib, Gilbert; Zamorano, Jose; Derumeaux, Genevieve; Fernandez-Lozano, Ignacio; Dupuis, Jean-Marc; Rouleau, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Tassin, Aude; Bordachar, Pierre; ClÃ©menty, Jacques; Lafitte, Stephane; Ploux, Sylvan; Reant, Patricia; Ritter, Philippe; Defaye, Pascal; Jacon, Peggy; Mondesert, Blandine; Saunier, Carole; Vautrin, Estelle; Kacet, Salem; Guedon-Moreau, Laurence; Klug, Didier; Kouakam, Claude; Marechaux, Sylvestre; Marquie, Christelle; Polge, Anne Sophie; Richardson, Marjorie; Chevallier, Philippe; De Breyne, Brigitte; Lotek, Marcin M.; Nonin, Emilie; Pineau, Julien; Deharo, Jean-Claude; Bastard, Emilie; Franceschi, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Habib, Gilbert; Jego, Christophe; Peyrouse, Eric; Prevot, Sebastien; Saint-Joseph, HÃ´pital; Bremondy, Michel; Faure, Jacques; Ferracci, Ange; Lefevre, Jean; Pisapia, Andre; Davy, Jean-Marc; Cransac, Frederic; Cung, Tien Tri; Georger, Frederic; Pasquie, Jean-Luc; Raczka, Franck; Sportouch-Dukhan, Catherine; Sadoul, Nicolas; Blangy, Hugues; Bruntz, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Freysz, Luc; Groben, Laurent; Huttin, Olivier; Bammert, Antoine; Burban, Marc; Cebron, Jean-Pierre; Gras, Daniel; Frank, Robert; Duthoit, Guillaume; Hidden-Lucet, FranÃ§oise; Himbert, Caroline; Isnard, Richard; Lacotte, JÃ©rÃ´me; Pousset, FranÃ§oise; Zerah, Thierry; Leclercq, Christophe; Bellouin, AnnaÃ¯k; Crocq, Christophe; Deplace, Christian; Donal, Erwan; Hamon, CÃ©cile; Mabo, Philippe; Romain, Olivier; Solnon, Aude; Frederic, Anselme; Bauer, Fabrice; Bernard, Mathieu; Godin, Benedicte; Kurtz, Baptiste; Savoure, Arnaud; Copie, Xavier; Lascault, Gilles; Paziaud, Olivier; Piot, Olivier; Touche, Thierry; Delay, Toulouse Marc; Chilon, Talia; Detis, Nicolas; Duparc, Alexandre; Hebrard, AurÃ©lien; Massabuau, Pierre; Maury, Philippe; Mondoly, Pierre; Rumeau, Philippe; Pasteur, Clinique; Boveda, Serge; Adrover, Laurence; Combes, Nicolas; Deplagne, Antoine; Marco-Baertich, Isabelle; Fondard, Olivier; MartÃ­nez, Juan Gabriel; IbaÃ±ez Criado, JosÃ© Luis; OrtuÃ±o, Diego; Mont, Lluis; Berruezo, Antonio; Eduard, Belu; MartÃ­n, Ana; Merschon, Franco M.; Sitges, Marta; Tolosana, JosÃ© MarÃ­a; Vidal, BÃ¡rbara; Hebron, H.

The optimal right ventricular (RV) lead position being a matter of debate, we sought to examine whether RV septal (RVS) pacing was not inferior to RV apical (RVA) pacing on left ventricular reverse remodelling in patients receiving a CRT-defibrillator. Methods and results Patients (n = 263, age = 63.4 Â± 9.5 years) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to RVS (n = 131) vs. RVA (n = 132) pacing. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) reduction between baseline and 6 months was not different between the two groups (â25.3 Â± 39.4 mL in RVS group vs. â29.3 Â± 44.5 mL in RVA group, P = 0.79). Right ventricular septal pacing was not non-inferior (primary endpoint) to RVA pacing with regard to LVESV reduction (average difference = â4.06 mL; P = 0.006 with a â20 mL non-inferiority margin). The percentage of âecho-respondersâ defined by LVESV reduction >15% between baseline and 6 months was similar in both groups (50%) with no difference in the time to first HF hospitalization or death (P = 0.532). Procedural or device-related serious adverse events occurred in 68 patients (RVS = 37) with no difference between the two groups (P = 0.401). Conclusion This study demonstrates that septal RV pacing in CRT is non-inferior to apical RV pacing for LV reverse remodelling at 6 months with no difference in the clinical outcome. No recommendation for optimal RV lead position can hence be drawn from this study. ClinicalTrials. gov number NCT 00833352.

The experimental study was conducted at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Islamabad, from 2006 to 2007. The experimental and control groups were further divided into three subgroups based on the day of sacrifice. The experimental group was exposed to ethanol vapours produced in a specially-designed vapour chamber and then compared with age-matched controls. There were 90 eggs in each of the two groups. The development of inter-ventricular septum completed at day 7 of development in chick embryo. Ethanol vapour exposure produced a small discontinuity at day 10 of development in a chick embryo which may be labelled as ventricular septal defect since ventricular development is completed by day 7. Interatrial septum formed till day 7 with small perforations which persisted till hatching. Ethanol vapour exposure may lead to ventricular septal defect.\n\nGrowth of left ventricular outflow tract and predictors of future re-intervention after repair for ventricular septal defect and aortic arch obstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nJijeh, Abdulraouf; Ismail, Muna; Alhabshan, Fahad\n\n2017-09-01\n\nVentricular septal defect and aortic arch obstruction are usually associated with a narrow left ventricular outflow tract. The aim of the present study was to analyse the growth and predictors of future obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract after surgical repair. We carried out a retrospective review of patients who underwent repair for ventricular septal defect and aortic arch obstruction - coarctation or interrupted aortic arch - between July, 2002 and June, 2013. Echocardiographic data were reviewed, and the need for re-intervention was evaluated. A total of 89 patients were included in this study. A significant left ventricular outflow tract growth was noticed after surgical repair. Preoperatively, the mean left ventricular outflow tract Z-score was -1.46Â±1 (range -5.5 to 1.1) and increased to a mean value of -0.7Â±1.3 (range -2.7 to 3.2) at last follow-up (p=0.0001), demonstrating relevant growth of the left ventricular outflow tract after repair for ventricular septal defect and aortic arch obstruction. After primary repair, 11 patients (12.3%) required re-intervention with surgical repair for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction after a mean period of 36Â±21 months. There were no significant differences in age, weight, and indexed aortic valve and left ventricular outflow tract measurements between those who developed obstruction and those who did not. Significant left ventricular outflow tract growth is expected after repair of ventricular septal defect and aortic arch obstruction. Small aortic valve and left ventricular outflow tract at diagnosis are not risk factors to predict the need for surgical re-intervention for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in future.\n\nDown Syndrome with Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, and Pulmonary Vein Stenosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMahadevaiah, Guruprasad; Gupta, Manoj; Ashwath, Ravi\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe prevalence of congenital heart disease in infants with Down syndrome is 40%, compared with 0.3% in children who have normal chromosomes. Atrioventricular and ventricular septal defects are often associated with chromosomal aberrations, such as in trisomy 21, whereas hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is chiefly thought to be secondary to specific gene mutations. We found only one reported case of congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and atrioventricular septal defect in an infant with Down syndrome. Here, we report atrioventricular septal defect, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary vein stenosis in a neonate with Down syndrome-an apparently unique combination. In addition, we discuss the relevant medical literature.\n\nNormovolemic hemodilution using hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (Voluven) in a Jehovah's Witness child requiring cardiopulmonary bypass for ventricular septal defect repair.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaliberte, Bryan D; Nath, Dilip S; Costello, John P; Nuszkowski, Mark; Kaplan, Richard F\n\n2014-08-01\n\nSurgical repair of congenital heart disease during cardiopulmonary bypass is common, and performing these complicated procedures in the absence of blood transfusions is especially challenging. A case of a Jehovah's Witness child who underwent surgical repair of a ventricular septal defect utilizing a new tetrastarch for autologous normovolemic hemodilution is reported. A successful operative repair was achieved without the need for non-autologous blood transfusion.

Most observations have noted tricuspid valve clefts or dysplasia. We describe another mechanism for production of TR in association with paramembranous VSD. In 8 patients, we found significant TR produced by the VSD jet pushing the tricuspid anterior leaflet forward to open the tricuspid valve orifice. In these patients, a moderate paramembranous VSD extended slightly below the septal tricuspid leaflet with only partial obstruction of the VSD jet. All patients had restrictive VSD with low right ventricular pressure. This mechanism to produce TR was best defined by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, but current higher resolution imaging should allow correct diagnosis. We believe that when this mechanism for TR is found in association with a moderate VSD, surgical VSD closure is warranted.\n\nEffects of morphologic left ventricular pressure on right ventricular geometry and tricuspid valve regurgitation in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.\n\nPubMed\n\nKral Kollars, Catharine A; Gelehrter, Sarah; Bove, Edward L; Ensing, Gregory\n\n2010-03-01\n\nCongenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) is associated with tricuspid regurgitation (TR), which has been postulated to arise from the effect of ventricular septal position on the attachments of the tricuspid valve. This study was performed to determine the effect of left ventricular (LV) pressure on right ventricular (RV) and LV geometry and the degree of TR. Serial echocardiograms were reviewed from, 30 patients with CCTGA who underwent pulmonary artery banding to train the morphologic left ventricle (n = 14) or left ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit placement and ventricular septal defect closure in conjunction with physiologic repair (n = 16). The degree of TR, the LV/RV pressure ratio, RV and LV sphericity indexes, and tricuspid valve tethering distance and coaptation length were analyzed. After pulmonary artery banding, an increase in LV systolic pressure to > or =2/3 systemic resulted in a decrease in TR from severe to moderate (p = 0.02). The percentage of patients with severe TR decreased from 64% to 18% (p = 0.06). The RV sphericity index decreased (p = 0.05), and the LV sphericity index increased (p = 0.02). After left ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit placement, a decrease in LV pressure to < or =1/2 systemic resulted in an increase in TR from none to mild (p = 0.003). In conclusion, these data indicate that LV pressure in patients with CCTGA affects the degree of TR and that septal shift caused by changes in LV and RV pressure is an important mechanism.

Minimal skin incisions and partial sternotomy reduce surgical trauma, however these techniques might not be successful in treating a number of congenital pathological conditions, particularly for combined congenital defects. We focused on cases with a combined presentation of ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus. We studied 12 infants who successfully underwent surgical treatment for a combined single-stage ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus closure through a lower ministernotomy without using cardiopulmonary bypass and X-rays. No intraoperative and early postoperative complications or mortality were noted. Postoperative echocardiography did not reveal residual shunts. The proposed technique is safe and reproducible in infants.

Twenty-one patients with these malformations are described. Twenty had an associated ventricular septal defect with ventriculoarterial concordance, and one also had transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and obstructive pulmonary valve ring. The clinical features, cardiac catheterisation findings, and angiocardiographic results are presented. Twelve patients underwent cardiac surgery. Three patients died, one in the early, and the other two in the late postoperative period. The results, according to the surgical technique employed and postoperative cardiac catheterisation findings, showed that patients in whom the bioprostheses were implanted in the pulmonary position had a better late follow-up.

The present study investigated the prevalence of abnormal right ventricular systolic pressure response in 20 adult (age 30-45 years) patients who underwent surgery for early ventricular septal defect closure and its association with impaired ventricular function, pulmonary function, or exercise capacity. The patients underwent cardiopulmonary tests, including exercise stress echocardiography. Five of 19 patients (26%) presented an abnormal right ventricular systolic pressure response to exercise â©¾ 52 mmHg. Right ventricular systolic function was mixed, with normal tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and fractional area change, but abnormal tricuspid annular systolic motion velocity (median 6.7 cm/second) and isovolumetric acceleration (median 0.8 m/second2). Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function was normal at rest as measured by the peak systolic velocity of the lateral wall and isovolumic acceleration, early diastolic velocity, and ratio of early diastolic flow to tissue velocity, except for ejection fraction (median 53%). The myocardial performance index was abnormal for both the left and right ventricle. Peak oxygen uptake was normal (mean z score -0.4, 95% CI -2.8-0.3). There was no association between an abnormal right ventricular systolic pressure response during exercise and right or left ventricular function, pulmonary function, or exercise capacity. Abnormal right ventricular pressure response is not more frequent in adult patients compared with adolescents. This does not support the theory of progressive pulmonary vascular disease following closure of left-to-right shunts.\n\nEchocardiographic detection of ventricular septal defects in large animals.\n\nPubMed\n\nPipers, F S; Reef, V; Wilson, J\n\n1985-10-15\n\nVentricular septal defects in a foal, a 2-year-old filly, and 2 calves were demonstrated with M-mode and two-dimensional real-time echocardiography. The studies were performed with the animals unsedated, either standing or in lateral recumbency. Cardiac windows were located between the 4th and 7th intercostal spaces, approximately at the level of the olecranon. In each case, the septal defect was visualized high in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum. Defects were visualized by use of sector scanning or linear-array ultrasonic equipment, with transducer frequencies of 2.25 to 3.5 MHz.\n\nCurrent topics in surgery for multiple ventricular septal defects.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshimura, Naoki; Fukahara, Kazuaki; Yamashita, Akio; Doki, Yoshinori; Takeuchi, Katsunori; Higuma, Tomonori; Senda, Kazutaka; Toge, Masayoshi; Matsuo, Tatsuro; Nagura, Saori; Aoki, Masaya; Sakata, Kimimasa; Sakai, Mari\n\n2016-04-01\n\nIn this review article, we describe several topics, including the sandwich technique, the transatrial re-endocardialization technique, the limited apical left ventriculotomy approach and device closure. The sandwich technique was introduced for the closure of muscular ventricular septal defects (VSD) by sandwiching the septum between two felt patches placed in the left and right ventricle. This technique requires neither the transection of muscular trabeculae nor ventriculotomy. Although the sandwich technique has resulted in the improvement of surgical outcomes, cases of postoperative cardiac dysfunction have been reported. Multiple smaller VSDs have been closed with transatrial re-endocardialization. Septal dysfunction may be avoided through this technique, in which the septal trabeculae are approximated in two layers of superficial, endocardial running sutures. Recently, a number of reports have recommended a limited apical left ventriculotomy approach. With this technique, a much shorter incision of around 1Â cm at the apex of the left ventricle may be sufficient for achieving the complete closure of apical muscular VSDs. The transcatheter or perventricular device closure of muscular VSDs has increasingly been performed with good results. Although favorable early and mid-term results of device closure have been reported, this method is not always safer or less invasive than surgical closure. Long-term evaluations should be performed to determine whether the right and left ventricular functions are affected by treatment with relatively large devices in the heart.\n\nNovel mutation of GATA4 gene in Kurdish population of Iran with nonsyndromic congenital heart septals defects.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoheili, Fariborz; Jalili, Zahra; Rahbar, Mahtab; Khatooni, Zahed; Mashayekhi, Amir; Jafari, Hossein\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe mutations in GATA4 gene induce inherited atrial and ventricular septation defects, which is the most frequent forms of congenital heart defects (CHDs) constituting about half of all cases. We have performed High resolution melting (HRM) mutation scanning of GATA4 coding exons of nonsyndrome 100 patients as a case group including 39 atrial septal defects (ASD), 57 ventricular septal defects (VSD) and four patients with both above defects and 50 healthy individuals as a control group. Our samples are categorized according to their HRM graph. The genome sequencing has been done for 15 control samples and 25 samples of patients whose HRM analysis were similar to healthy subjects for each exon. The PolyPhen-2 and MUpro have been used to determine the causative possibility and structural stability prediction of GATA4 sequence variation. The HRM curve analysis exhibit that 21 patients and 3 normal samples have deviated curves for GATA4 coding exons. Sequencing analysis has revealed 12 nonsynonymous mutations while all of them resulted in stability structure of protein 10 of them are pathogenic and 2 of them are benign. Also we found two nucleotide deletions which one of them was novel and one new indel mutation resulting in frame shift mutation, and 4 synonymous variations or polymorphism in 6 of patients and 3 of normal individuals. Six or about 50% of these nonsynonymous mutations have not been previously reported. Our results show that there is a spectrum of GATA4 mutations resulting in septal defects.

As safety data are scarce for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients the study aims to evaluate ICD lead performance in the mid-septal position. A total of 299 ICD recipients (79% male, aged 65.2 Â± 12.1 years, 83% primary prevention of sudden cardiac death) were randomized to receive the RV ICD electrode either in a mid-septal (n=145) or apical (n=154) location. Event-free survival was evaluated at 3 (primary endpoint) and 12 months (secondary endpoint). Events included a composite of lead revision, suboptimal right ventricular electrode performance (including defibrillation thresholds (DFT)>25 J) or lead position not in accordance with randomized location. Event-free survival at 3 (12) months was observed in 80.6% (72.3%) of patients randomized to a mid-septal and in 82.2% (72.1%) of patients randomized to an apical lead position, p=0.726 (p=0.969). Pre-defined margins for non-inferiority were not reached at 3 or 12 months. High DFT was found in 7 patients (5.0%) of the mid-septal and in 3 (2.2%) patients of the apical group (p=0.209). In ICD recipients electrode positioning to the RV mid-septum or the RV apex results in slightly different rates concerning the survival free of lead revision, suboptimal right ventricular electrode performance or non-randomized lead position.

Woodrow; Ivy, Dunbar; Perryman, M.B.; Garrett-Sinha, Lee Ann; Grossfeld, Paul\n\n2010-01-01\n\nCongenital heart defects comprise the most common form of major birth defects, affecting 0.7% of all newborn infants. Jacobsen syndrome (11q-) is a rare chromosomal disorder caused by deletions in distal 11q. We have previously determined that a wide spectrum of the most common congenital heart defects occur in 11q-, including an unprecedented high frequency of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). We identified an â¼7 Mb âcardiac critical regionâ in distal 11q that contains a putative causative gene(s) for congenital heart disease. In this study, we utilized chromosomal microarray mapping to characterize three patients with 11q- and congenital heart defects that carry interstitial deletions overlapping the 7 Mb cardiac critical region. We propose that this 1.2 Mb region of overlap harbors a gene(s) that causes at least a subset of the congenital heart defects that occur in 11q-. We demonstrate that one gene in this region, ETS-1 (a member of the ETS family of transcription factors), is expressed in the endocardium and neural crest during early mouse heart development. Gene-targeted deletion of ETS-1 in mice in a C57/B6 background causes, with high penetrance, large membranous ventricular septal defects and a bifid cardiac apex, and less frequently a non-apex-forming left ventricle (one of the hallmarks of HLHS). Our results implicate an important role for the ETS-1 transcription factor in mammalian heart development and should provide important insights into some of the most common forms of congenital heart disease.

Methods An observational retrospective study was performed at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Recife, Brazil. 103 infants with presumed congenital Zika syndrome. All infants had microcephaly and head computed tomography findings compatible with congenital Zika syndrome. Zika IgM antibody was detected in cerebrospinal fluid samples of 23 infants. In 80 infants, the test was not performed because it was not available at that time. All infants had negative serology for HIV, syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis. A complete transthoracic two-dimensional, M-mode, continuous wave and pulsed wave Doppler and color Doppler echocardiographic (PHILIPS HD11XE or HD15) examination was performed on all infants. Results 14/103 (13.5%) echocardiograms were compatible with congenital heart disease: 5 with an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, 8 had a hemodynamically insignificant small apical muscular ventricular septal defect and one infant with dyspnea had a large membranous ventricular septal defect. The echocardiograms considered normal included 45 infants with a persistent foramen ovale and 16 with a minimum patent ductus arteriosus. Conclusions Preliminarily this study suggests that congenital Zika syndrome may be associated with an increase prevalence of congenital heart disease. However the types of defects noted were septal defects, a proportion of which would not be hemodynamically significant.

From January 2008 to December 2012, a total of 70 patients (men: 33, women: 37; mean age: 30.0Â Â±Â 17.1Â years) with at least mild TR before VSD closure were examined in 508 consecutive congenital perimembranous VSD patients to investigate the outcomes of TR. After VSD closure, the jet area decreased from 3.4Â Â±Â 2.5 to 1.2Â Â±Â 2.5Â cm(2) (pÂ <Â 0.001); however, no significant decrease was found in 3 patients (mean age 59.7Â Â±Â 2.5Â years) with severe TR (12.0Â Â±Â 1.2 versus 11.2Â Â±Â 3.2Â cm(2), pÂ =Â 0.668). Compared to the early outcome after VSD closure, the jet area detected by TTE at 6-month follow-up had further decreased (1.2Â Â±Â 2.5 versus 0.9Â Â±Â 2.2Â cm(2), pÂ <Â 0.001). In 6 patients, a slight residual shunt was detected immediately after VSD closure and diminished in 3 patients at 6-month follow-up. The hemolysis occurred in one of these six patients and recovered after 3Â days. In conclusion, functional TR was ameliorated after percutaneous VSD closure, although persistent abundant TR was common in patients with severe TR before procedure.\n\nRight ventricular septal pacing: the success of stylet-driven active-fixation leads.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosso, Raphael; Teh, Andrew W; Medi, Caroline; Hung, Thuy To; Balasubramaniam, Richard; Mond, Harry G\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe detrimental effects of right ventricular (RV) apical pacing on left ventricular function has driven interest in alternative pacing sites and in particular the mid RV septum and RV outflow tract (RVOT). RV septal lead positioning can be successfully achieved with a specifically shaped stylet and confirmed by the left anterior oblique (LAO) fluoroscopic projection. Such a projection is neither always used nor available during pacemaker implantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate how effective is the stylet-driven technique in septal lead placement guided only by posterior-anterior (PA) fluoroscopic view. One hundred consecutive patients with an indication for single- or dual-chamber pacing were enrolled. RV septal lead positioning was attempted in the PA projection only and confirmed by the LAO projection at the end of the procedure. The RV lead position was septal in 90% of the patients. This included mid RV in 56 and RVOT in 34 patients. There were no significant differences in the mean stimulation threshold, R-wave sensing, and lead impedance between the two sites.In the RVOT, 97% (34/35) of leads were placed on the septum, whereas in the mid RV the value was 89% (56/63). The study confirms that conventional active-fixation pacing leads can be successfully and safely deployed onto the RV septum using a purposely-shaped stylet guided only by the PA fluoroscopic projection.\n\nA systematic review of trends and patterns of congenital heart disease in children in Nigeria from 1964-2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdulkadir, Mohammed; Abdulkadir, Zainab\n\n2016-06-01\n\nCongenital heart diseases cause significant childhood morbidity and mortality. Several restricted studies have been conducted on the epidemiology in Nigeria. No truly nationwide data on patterns of congenital heart disease exists. To determine the patterns of congenital heart disease in children in Nigeria and examine trends in the occurrence of individual defects across 5 decades. We searched PubMed database, Google scholar, TRIP database, World Health Organisation libraries and reference lists of selected articles for studies on patterns of congenital heart disease among children in Nigeria between 1964 and 2015. Two researchers reviewed the papers independently and extracted the data. Seventeen studies were selected that included 2,953 children with congenital heart disease. The commonest congenital heart diseases in Nigeria are ventricular septal defect (40.6%), patent ductus arteriosus (18.4%), atrial septal defect (11.3%) and tetralogy of Fallot (11.8%). There has been a 6% increase in the burden of VSD in every decade for the 5 decades studied and a decline in the occurrence of pulmonary stenosis. Studies conducted in Northern Nigeria demonstrated higher proportions of atrial septal defects than patent ductus arteriosus. Ventricular septal defects are the commonest congenital heart diseases in Nigeria with a rising burden.\n\nCoarctation of the aorta and ventricular septal defect: should we perform a single-stage repair?\n\nPubMed\n\nIsomatsu, Y; Imai, Y; Shin'oka, T; Aoki, M; Sato, K\n\n2001-09-01\n\nOptimal management for coarctation of the aorta and ventricular septal defect remains controversial. The current study was undertaken to determine outcome, including recoarctation after 2-stage repair, at our institution. Between 1984 and 1998, 79 patients younger than 3 months with coarctation and ventricular septal defect underwent 2-stage repair at our institution. The first-stage operation consisted of subclavian flap angioplasty and pulmonary banding. The median age at the time of first operation was 28 days (range, 4-90 days), and median weight was 3.2 kg (range, 1.2-5.1 kg). Hypoplastic aortic arch was present in 27 patients, and coexisting anomalies were present in 13 patients. After a mean interval of 10.4 +/- 9.6 months, they underwent a second-stage repair, with closure of the ventricular septal defect and pulmonary debanding. There were 2 hospital deaths and 4 late deaths. Mean follow-up was 9.2 +/- 4.9 years (range, 2.0-18.3 years), and actuarial survival was 92.3% at 10 years (95% confidence interval, 86.6%-98.3%). Age at first operation, body weight, hypoplastic arch, and coexisting anomalies had no significant influence on overall mortality. Freedom from recoarctation rate was 90.4% at 10 years (95% confidence interval, 83.7%-97.2%). To diminish mortality and the recoarctation rate and also to decrease the possibility of complications related to circulatory arrest and allogeneic blood transfusion, 2-stage repair is still an effective technique for coarctation of the aorta associated with ventricular septal defect.\n\nTraumatic ventricular septal defect following a stab wound to the chest.\n\nPubMed\n\nIto, Hideki; Saito, Shunei; Miyahara, Ken; Takemura, Haruki; Sawaki, Sadanari; Matsuura, Akio\n\n2009-03-01\n\nA 51-year-old man who had been suffering from depression stabbed himself in the chest with an ice pick. At presentation, an ice pick lodged in the left fifth intercostal space was moving synchronously with his heartbeat. Echocardiography revealed that the tip was penetrating the anterior wall of the right ventricle. Because the patient was tamponading, an emergency operation was carried out. The ice pick was removed following the establishment of a cardiopulmonary bypass and pericardiotomy. The perforation of the right ventricle was closed with a pledget-reinforced mattress stitch. On postoperative day 12, a holosystolic murmur was detected on auscultation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a ventricular septal defect 5 mm in diameter located near the apex. The pulmonary-tosystemic flow ratio was 1.1 by echocardiographic measurement. No sign of heart failure was present. Although it was agreed to manage the ventricular septal defect conservatively, careful echocardiographic follow-up is mandatory.\n\nCongenital heart defects in cats: A retrospective study of 162 cats (1996-2013).\n\nPubMed\n\nTidholm, Anna; Ljungvall, Ingrid; Michal, Jenny; HÃ¤ggstrÃ¶m, Jens; HÃ¶glund, Katja\n\n2015-12-01\n\nTo study the prevalence and distribution of congenital heart defects in cats presented at two referral centers in Sweden between 1996 and 2013. 162 client-owned cats with congenital heart defects. Case records of cats diagnosed with congenital heart disease were reviewed retrospectively. The overall prevalence of congenital heart disease was 0.2% of the total number of patient cats, and 8% of cats diagnosed with heart disease. A total of 182 heart defects were identified as 16 cats were diagnosed with more than one defect. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) was most prevalent, found in 50% of cats, followed by tricuspid valve dysplasia (11%), pulmonic stenosis (10%), atrial septal defect (10%), aortic stenosis (9%), mitral valve dysplasia (9%), tetralogy of Fallot (5%), patent ductus arteriosus (3%), common atrioventricular canal (2%), and the following defects that each accounted for 0.6% of cats: double chamber right ventricle, double outlet right ventricle, endocardial fibroelastosis, dextroposition of the aorta, persistent right aortic arch, and pulmonary atresia. The prevalence of congenital heart disease was 0.2% of the total number of patient cats, and 8% of cats diagnosed with heart disease. Ventricular septal defect was the most common congenital heart defect in this study. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Bedside echocardiography revealed ventricular septal rupture at the basal posteroinferior wall with a large left-to-right shunt. Right ventricular free-wall intramyocardial dissection and tricuspid chordae rupture were noted. Coronary angiography demonstrated occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery, which was treated by balloon angioplasty and stenting. While preparing for surgical repair, the patient's overall cardiac and renal function deteriorated and surgery was contraindicated. The patient died 16 days after discharge.

The suture-related inadvertent injury to an AV leaflet can produce leaflet perforation with aortic regurgitation after ventricular septal defect repair (VSDR). We report three consecutive patients who had iatrogenic aortic leaflet perforation during VSDR in other hospitals and referred to our hospital for reoperation. In all three cases, the perforated AV leaflets were preserved and repaired by autologous pericardial patch or direct local closure.

Echocardiographic indicators such as atrioventricular valve index, right ventricle/left ventricle inflow angle, and size of the ventricular septal defect have been identified as relevant discriminators that may guide surgical strategy. Our purpose is to describe another metric to refine surgical decision-making. We outline a geometrical description of the anatomic features of atrioventricular septal defect and describe equations that help explain the interplay between the main echocardiographic variables. A new metric called \"indexed ventricular septal defect\" is defined as the size of the defect in relation to the valve diameter. We derive a final equation relating this index with the atrioventricular valve index and the right ventricle/left ventricle inflow angle. In the light of that equation, we discuss the interdependence of variables and employ data from a Congenital Heart Surgeons' Society study to set the limits of the new index. Combined use of indexed ventricular septal defect and atrioventricular valve index might help clarify surgical decision-making in patients with mild and moderate unbalance (modified atrioventricular valve index between 0.2 and 0.39). For indexed ventricular septal defect smaller than 0.2, biventricular repair may be recommended. Between 0.2 and 0.35, this strategy could probably be achieved depending on other factors. However, other strategies should be considered for those patients showing an indexed ventricular septal defect between 0.35 and 0.5. For values above 0.5 to 0.55, univentricular palliation might be a reasonable strategy.\n\nOff-pump repair of a post-infarct ventricular septal defect: the 'Hamburger procedure'\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarker, Thomas A; Ng, Alexander; Morgan, Ian S\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe report a novel off-pump technique for the surgical closure of post-infarct ventricular septal defects (VSDs). The case report describes the peri-operative management of a 76 year old lady who underwent the 'Hamburger procedure' for closure of her apical VSD. Refractory cardiogenic shock meant that traditional patch repairs requiring cardiopulmonary bypass would be poorly tolerated. We show that echocardiography guided off-pump posterior-anterior septal plication is a safe, effective method for closing post-infarct VSDs in unstable patients. More experience is required to ascertain whether this technique will become an accepted alternative to patch repairs.

The limits for, and the specific outcomes after anatomical vs univentricular repair still remain to be established. Between 1993 and 2011, 36 consecutive patients presenting with double-outlet right ventricle or noncommitted ventricular septal defect (21 inlet, 10 muscular, and 5 central perimembranous) and 2 adequately sized ventricles underwent surgical repair at 2 centers. Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction was present in 18 of 36 patients (50%). A total of 21 patients had undergone previous palliative procedures. Anatomical repair (group I) by means of intraventricular baffle construction was performed in 24 (associated right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction in 12 and arterial switch in 5) at a median age of 10.5 months. Ventricular septal defect was surgically enlarged in 12 (50%) patients. The remaining 12 patients underwent univentricular repair (group II). There were 4 hospital deaths (11%), all in group I (P = 0.30 vs group II). A total of 8 of 20 patients in group I survivors underwent 13 reoperations after a median delay of 24 months: subaortic stenosis was the main cause for reoperation in 6 of 8 patients. There was 1 late death in group I and 2 late deaths in group II. The median follow-up was 5.6 years (95% CI: 0.2-9.8). The 10- year actuarial survival rate and freedom from reoperation were 74.7 Â± 5% and 58 Â± 5% in group I and 71 Â± 7% and 70 Â± 7% in group II, respectively. At the last visit, all survivors were in New York Heart Association class I-II. Univariate analysis showed that atrioventricular septal defect and isolated mitral cleft were associated with death (P = 0.04) and need for reoperation (P = 0.038). In conclusion, anatomical repair, associated with substantial rates of mortality and need for reoperation, should be considered with caution.

We sought to evaluate changes in RV function after temporary RV cardiac resynchronization therapy. Twenty-five patients aged median 12.0 years after repair of tetralogy of Fallot and similar lesions were studied echocardiographically (n=23) and by cardiac catheterization (n=5) after primary repair (n=4) or after surgical RV revalvulation for significant pulmonary regurgitation (n=21). Temporary RV cardiac resynchronization therapy was applied in the presence of complete right bundle branch block by atrial-synchronized RV free wall pacing in complete fusion with spontaneous ventricular depolarization using temporary electrodes. The q-RV interval at the RV free wall pacing site (mean 77.2% of baseline QRS duration) confirmed pacing from a late activated RV area. RV cardiac resynchronization therapy carried significant decrease in QRS duration ( P <0.001) along with elimination of the right bundle branch block QRS morphology, increase in RV filling time ( P =0.002), pulmonary artery velocity time integral ( P =0.006), and RV maximum +dP/dt ( P <0.001), and decrease in RV index of myocardial performance ( P =0.006). RV mechanical synchrony improved: septal-to-lateral RV mechanical delay decreased ( P <0.001) and signs of RV dyssynchrony pattern were significantly abolished. RV systolic stretch fraction reflecting the ratio of myocardial stretching and contraction during systole diminished ( P =0.001). In patients with congenital heart disease and right bundle branch block, RV cardiac resynchronization therapy carried multiple positive effects on RV mechanics, synchrony, and contraction efficiency.

CTA data of 35 ToF patients were collected to prepare l:l 3D solid models using digital 3D reconstruction and RPT, and the resultant models were used intraoperatively as reference. The operations of all 35 patients were completed under the guidance of the 3D solid model, without difficulty. Intraoperative findings of the patients were consistent with the morphological and size changes of the 3D solid model, and no significant differences were found between the patches obtained from the 3D solid model and the actual intraoperative measurements (t = 0.83, P = 0.412). 3D reconstruction and RPT of multislice spiral CTA can accurately and intuitively reflect the anatomy of ventricular septal defects in ToF patients, providing the foundation for a solid model of the complex congenital heart.\n\nThe cardiac proteome in patients with congenital ventricular septal defect: A comparative study between right atria and right ventricles.\n\nPubMed\n\nBond, A R; Iacobazzi, D; Abdul-Ghani, S; Ghorbel, M T; Heesom, K J; George, S J; Caputo, M; Suleiman, M-S; Tulloh, R M\n\n2018-03-20\n\nRight ventricle (RV) remodelling occurs in neonatal patients born with ventricular septal defect (VSD). The presence of a defect between the two ventricles allows for shunting of blood from the left to right side. The resulting RV hypertrophy leads to molecular remodelling which has thus far been largely investigated using right atrial (RA) tissue. In this study we used proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis in order to determine any difference between the proteomes for RA and RV. Samples were therefore taken from the RA and RV of five infants (0.34â¯Â±â¯0.05â¯years, meanâ¯Â±â¯SEM) with VSD who were undergoing cardiac surgery to repair the defect. Significant differences in protein expression between RV and RA were seen. 150 protein accession numbers were identified which were significantly lower in the atria, whereas none were significantly higher in the atria compared to the ventricle. 19 phosphorylation sites (representing 19 phosphoproteins) were also lower in RA. This work has identified differences in the proteome between RA and RV which reflect differences in contractile activity and metabolism. As such, caution should be used when drawing conclusions based on analysis of the RA and extrapolating to the hypertrophied RV. RV hypertrophy occurs in neonatal patients born with VSD. Very little is known about how the atria responds to RV hypertrophy, especially at the protein level. Access to tissue from age-matched groups of patients is very rare, and we are in the unique position of being able to get tissue from both the atria and ventricle during reparative surgery of these infants. Our findings will be beneficial to future research into heart chamber malformations in congenital heart defects. Copyright Â© 2018.

Cardiac MR revealed a small subaortic VSD in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum. The atrioventricular portion was intact. Cardiac MR clearly showed flow jet through the VSD, impinging on the anterior tricuspid leaflet during systole, and bouncing back into the right atrium as TR. This ricochet mechanism of TR in VSD may be misinterpreted as Gerbode defect or as evidence of pulmonary hypertension.

VSD models were successfully established by transseptal ventricular septal puncture via the right jugular vein in 15 out of 18 canines. Two types of VSDOs were implanted, either with pcVSDOs (n = 8) as the new type occluder group or with the commercial ventricular septal defect occluders (VSDOs, n = 7, Shanghai Sharp Memory Alloy Co. Ltd.) as the control group. Sheath size was 10 French (10âFr) in two groups. Then the general state of the canines was observed after implantation. ECG and TTE were performed, respectively, at 7, 30, 90 days of follow-up. The canines were sacrificed at these time points for pathological and scanning electron microscopy examination. The devices were successfully implanted in all 15 canines and were retrievable and repositionable. There was no thrombus formation on the device or occurrence of complete heart block. The pcVSDO surface implanted at day 7 was already covered with neotissue by gross examination, and it completed endothelialization at day 30, while the commercial VSDO was covered with the neotissue in 30th day and the complete endothelialization in 90th day. The study shows that pcVSDO is feasible and safe to close canine VSD model and has good biocompatibility and shorter time of endothelialization.\n\nSurgical technique of double switch procedure: Senning with arterial switch operation for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect.\n\nPubMed\n\nIlin, Alexey S; Teplov, Pavel V; Sakovich, Valeriy A; Ohye, Richard G\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe present a case of 12-month-old boy with congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries with L-looped ventricles and L-transposition of great arteries and ventricular septal defect. When admitted to the hospital, the patient had the appearance of congestive heart failure due to moderate to severe tricuspid valve regurgitation and right ventricle dysfunction. The pulmonary artery (PA) banding was required first because of low systolic pressure in the morphological left ventricle less than 70% confirmed by catheterization. Three months later, the patient appeared to be a good candidate for anatomical repair and a double switch procedure-Senning with arterial switch-was performed. The early postoperative period was relatively smooth and uneventful. Tricuspid valve insufficiency was resolved immediately after surgery. Mild systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with mild mitral insufficiency was confirmed by the 2D strain method of echocardiography on the second day of the postoperative period and it improved over the next 21 days. Thirty days later after the procedure, the patient underwent catheterization of his superior vena cava tunnel because of the slightly increased blood flow velocity diagnosed by echocardiography. In 3 months after the surgery, the boy was asymptomatic and was doing well. The patient's functional status was I according to the NYHA classification. Â© The Author 2016.

Turk J Pediatr 2017; 59: 225-232. Williams syndrome (WS), also known as Williams-Beuren syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder involving multiple systems including the circulatory system. However, the etiologies of the associated congenital heart defects in WS patients have not been sufficiently elucidated and represent therapeutic challenges. The typical congenital heart defects in WS were supravalvar aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis (both valvular and peripheral), aortic coarctation and mitral valvar prolapse. The atypical cardiovascular anomalies include tetralogy of Fallot, atrial septal defects, aortic and mitral valvular insufficiencies, bicuspid aortic valves, ventricular septal defects, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, double chambered right ventricle, Ebstein anomaly and arterial anomalies. Deletion of the elastin gene on chromosome 7q11.23 leads to deficiency or abnormal deposition of elastin during cardiovascular development, thereby leading to widespread cardiovascular abnormalities in WS. In this article, the distribution, treatment and surgical outcomes of typical and atypical cardiac defects in WS are discussed.\n\nHybrid approach for closure of muscular ventricular septal defects\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaponiuk, Ireneusz; Chojnicki, Maciej; Jaworski, Radoslaw; Steffek, Mariusz; Juscinski, Jacek; Sroka, Mariusz; Fiszer, Roland; Sendrowska, Aneta; Gierat-Haponiuk, Katarzyna; Maruszewski, Bohdan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground The complexity of ventricular septal defects in early infancy led to development of new mini-invasive techniques based on collaboration of cardiac surgeons with interventional cardiologists, called hybrid procedures. Hybrid therapies aim to combine the advantages of surgical and interventional techniques in an effort to reduce the invasiveness. The aim of this study was to present our approach with mVSD patients and initial results in the development of a mini-invasive hybrid procedure in the Gdansk Hybrid Heartlink Programme (GHHP) at the Department of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Pomeranian Centre of Traumatology in Gdansk, Poland. Material/Methods The group of 11 children with mVSDs was enrolled in GHHP and 6 were finally qualified to hybrid trans-ventricular mVSD device closure. Mean age at time of hybrid procedure was 8.22 months (range: from 2.7 to 17.8 months, SD=5.1) and mean body weight was 6.3 kg (range: from 3.4 to 7.5 kg, SD=1.5). Results The implants of choice were Amplatzer VSD Occluder and Amplatzer Duct Occluder II (AGA Med. Corp, USA). The position of the implants was checked carefully before releasing the device with both transesophageal echocardiography and epicardial echocardiography. All patients survived and their general condition improved. No complications occurred. The closure of mVSD was complete in all children. Conclusions Hybrid procedures of periventricular muscular VSD closure appear feasible and effective for patients with septal defects with morphology unsuitable for classic surgical or interventional procedures. The modern strategy of joint cardiac surgical and interventional techniques provides the benefits of close cooperation between cardiac surgeon and interventional cardiologist for selected patients in difficult clinical settings.

This study evaluated feasibility and safety of implanting the polyester-coated nitinol ventricular septal defect occluder (pcVSDO) in the canine model. Methods and Results. VSD models were successfully established by transseptal ventricular septal puncture via the right jugular vein in 15 out of 18 canines. Two types of VSDOs were implanted, either with pcVSDOs (n = 8) as the new type occluder group or with the commercial ventricular septal defect occluders (VSDOs, n = 7, Shanghai Sharp Memory Alloy Co. Ltd.) as the control group. Sheath size was 10 French (10âFr) in two groups. Then the general state of the canines was observed after implantation. ECG and TTE were performed, respectively, at 7, 30, 90 days of follow-up. The canines were sacrificed at these time points for pathological and scanning electron microscopy examination. The devices were successfully implanted in all 15 canines and were retrievable and repositionable. There was no thrombus formation on the device or occurrence of complete heart block. The pcVSDO surface implanted at day 7 was already covered with neotissue by gross examination, and it completed endothelialization at day 30, while the commercial VSDO was covered with the neotissue in 30th day and the complete endothelialization in 90th day. Conclusion. The study shows that pcVSDO is feasible and safe to close canine VSD model and has good biocompatibility and shorter time of endothelialization.

Without significant tricuspid valve malformation, associated defects such as ventricular septal defect and left ventricular outflow obstruction can be repaired surgically. The mortality and long-term outcome appear to be linked strongly with the severity of tricuspid valve regurgitation. Some patients with an intact ventricular septum and no right ventricular dysfunction will live long lives without detection, and some women will successfully complete pregnancy.\n\nCoexistence of congenital left ventricular aneurysm and prominent left ventricular trabeculation in a patient with LDB3 mutation: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nShan, Shengshuai; He, Xiaoxiao; He, Lin; Wang, Min; Liu, Chengyun\n\n2017-08-19\n\nThe coexistence of congenital left ventricular aneurysm and abnormal cardiac trabeculation with gene mutation has not been reported previously. Here, we report a case of coexisting congenital left ventricular aneurysm and prominent left ventricular trabeculation in a patient with LIM domain binding 3 gene mutation. A 30-year-old Asian man showed paroxysmal sinus tachycardia and Q waves in an electrocardiogram health check. There were no specific findings in physical examinations and serological tests. A coronary-computed tomography angiography check showed normal coronary artery and no coronary stenosis. Both left ventricle contrast echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance showed rare patterns of a combination of an apical aneurysm-like out-pouching structure with a wide connection to the left ventricle and prominent left ventricular trabecular meshwork. High-throughput sequencing examinations showed a novel mutation in the LDB3 gene (c.C793>T; p.Arg265Cys). Our finding indicates that the phenotypic expression of two heart conditions, congenital left ventricular aneurysm and prominent left ventricular trabeculation, although rare, can occur simultaneously with LDB3 gene mutation. Congenital left ventricular aneurysm and prominent left ventricular trabeculation may share the same genetic background.\n\nSurgery for doubly committed ventricular septal defects.\n\nPubMed\n\nShamsuddin, Ahmad Mahir; Chen, Yen Chuan; Wong, Abdul Rahim; Le, Trong-Phi; Anderson, Robert H; Corno, Antonio F\n\n2016-08-01\n\nDoubly committed ventricular septal defects (VSDs) account for up to almost one-third of isolated ventricular septal defects in Asian countries, compared with only 1/20th in western populations. In our surgical experience, this type of defect accounted for almost three-quarters of our practice. To date, patch closure has been considered the gold standard for surgical treatment of these lesions. Our objectives are to evaluate the indications and examine the outcomes of surgery for doubly committed VSDs. Between October 2013, when our service of paediatric cardiac surgery was opened, and December 2014, 24 patients were referred for surgical closure of VSDs. Among them, 17 patients (71%), with the median age of 6 years, ranging from 2 to 9 years, and with a median body weight of 19 kg, ranging from 11 to 56 kg, underwent surgical repair for doubly committed defects. In terms of size, the defect was considered moderate in 4 and large in 13. Aortic valvular regurgitation (AoVR) was present in 11 patients (65%) preoperatively, with associated malformations found in 14 (82%), with 5 patients (29%) having two or more associated defects. After surgery, there was "
