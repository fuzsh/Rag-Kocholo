Investigation by the Competition Authorities

EFTA's Surveillance Authority, assisted by the Norwegian Competition Authority, today began an investigation of possible price co-operation within i) the area of publication paper, which includes newsprint and magazine paper and ii) the purchase of recovered paper. The investigations are taking place at the company's headquarters in Lysaker, Norway.

The competition authorities also conducted an investigation regarding possible price co-operation among producers of publication paper in 1995-96, but the case was closed in 2002 without any violations being discovered.

Norske Skog has long established strict internal rules for compliance with competition laws, both in the EU and other places where the company is active. Pursuant to these rules, the company will co-operate with the competition authorities. The company has no further comments at this time.
