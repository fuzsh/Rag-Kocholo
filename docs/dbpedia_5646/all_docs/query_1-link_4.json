        "text": "Norske Skog is a Norwegian paper group founded in 1962 by a group of forest landowners. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, the company grew rapidly in Norway during the 1980s. A period of international expansion followed, including the construction of the first site outside Norway – in Golbey, in 1990 – and the establishment of the group in Australia and New Zealand in 2000.\n\nNorske Skog has a total production capacity of 1.7 million tonnes of publication paper as of 2022, making it one of the world leaders in this field. Norske Skog manufactures several types of newsprint, magazine and packaging paper in its mills. Publication paper is mainly used for printing newspapers and magazines, but also catalogues, inserts/leaflets, supplements, free newspapers, directories, direct mail, brochures, etc. Packaging paper consists mainly of containerboard sold to corrugators for the production of corrugated sheets and then boxes, crates, displays, etc.\n\nNorske Skog’s goal is to be a reliable partner for all its stakeholders. It defines the organisation, governance and role of each of its Business Units based on an operational model and a best practice guide. It guarantees fair competition and compliance with anti-corruption and anti-fraud laws.\n\nAll Norske Skog group employees must respect these standards and work in compliance with ethics and the law. There is zero tolerance for behaviour considered to be non-compliant. The group adheres to the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance.\n\nEstablished in the Vosges area since 1992, our company is one of the leaders in the Western European newsprint market. We are diversifying into packaging, with the aim of producing containerboard by 2024, that will be sold mainly in the European markets."
