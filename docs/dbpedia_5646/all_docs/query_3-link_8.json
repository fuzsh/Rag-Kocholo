I had a word with the founder at an event and i somehow instantly trusted the brand and i am so happy that using their product on my skin only made me trust them more. I love the brand, the founder, how transparent they are and their products are all natural. great quality, gentle and show results. i highly recommend skog to anyone who prefers quality products\n\nMy sister in law sent me this product as a recommendation. to my surprise 2 days later I bumped into this brand at the mall. So I picked up the gel and i was very skeptical but I have to say that this actually works. My acne has been a big big issue for me and as my skin is sensitive, i cannot just try anything. This one has really worked so so well for me and I would recommend this to anyone who has acne prone skin and nothing is working for them. Thank you skog team for doing what you do\n\nI can't express how grateful I am for this acne clarifying gel. It's made a significant difference in my skin. My breakouts are under control, and my confidence is back. Truly a game-changer! In just 2 days, my acne has significantly reduced.\n\nreally happy with the results in just 2 weeks. my acne is almost gone, i have struggled with this for really long and I could not have imagined a product all natural will help me at the end of the day. thank you skog\n\nreally happy with the results in just 2 weeks. my acne is almost gone, i have struggled with this for really long and I could not have imagined a product all natural will help me at the end of the day. thank you skog\n\nI have a very sensitive skin so I cannot use just anything on my skin.
