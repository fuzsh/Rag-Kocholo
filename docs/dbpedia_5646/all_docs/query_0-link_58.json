        "text": "Commercial status of direct thermochemical liquefaction technologies\n\nJul 2023\n\nPublications\n\nThe full report is available here.\n\nDirect thermochemical liquefaction (DTL) of biomass is an important pathway to produce liquid biofuels and biochemicals for the circular economy. DTL technologies include fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and solvolysis processes.\n\nThe aim of this report, commissioned by IEA Bioenergy Task 34 (biomass liquefaction), is to highlight how DTL technologies currently have a role to play in mobilizing biomass into the energy (heat, power and transport) and chemicals sectors, and to highlight the key features of commercially successful DTL operations. The report covers current commercial activity, near-to-market activities (e.g. demonstration plants) and some recently decommissioned plants.\n\nDetails of 11 commercial and 15 demonstration scale DTL plants that are either operational or under construction/late-stage development, spread across 14 countries, are provided. There are currently 6 operational commercial plants, all based on fast pyrolysis technology. The growing interest in Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is illustrated by the presence of 6 demonstration plants in the report and the start of the first commercial plant, expected in 2023. While most of the liquid products from the precursor plants were produced for heating applications, more and more processes include an upgrading of the liquid product into transportation fuels or chemicals.\n\nThe information presented shows that DTL technologies have matured to become a key vehicle for bioenergy commercialisation. Increasing number of pilots have succeeded bridging the technology valley of death by advancing the technology readiness level beyond TRL6 at reasonable costs to demonstrate scalability and financial viability. Commercial-scale DTL plants require significant investments that are financed through mechanisms such as equity, debt financing, shareholding and government grants. Favourable policy initiatives will further increase the number of commercial DTL plants, contributing to increasing bioenergy production.\n\nLead authors: François-Xavier Collard, Suren Wijeyekoon and Paul Bennett (Scion, New Zealand)\n\nA database of DTL activities that includes pilot-scale operations is also available on Task 34 website\n\nInfo sheets included in the report:\n\nCommercial Direct Thermochemical Liquefaction Plants:\n\nCountry Project Owner Technology provider Technology Status Brazil Aracruz Project Ensyn & Suzano Envergent (Ensyn RTP®) Fast pyrolysis Under development Canada Chuntoh Ghuna facility Arbios Biotech Licella (Cat-HTRTM) Hydrothermal liquefaction Under development (for 2023) Canada Côte-Nord pyrolysis facility Bioenergy AE Côte-Nord Envergent (Ensyn RTP®) Fast pyrolysis Active since 2018 Canada Ensyn Ontario facility Kerry Group Ensyn (RTP®) Fast pyrolysis Active since 2006 Canada Onym Montreal East Onym Group Onym Group Fast pyrolysis Under development (for 2023) Finland Green Fuel Nordic facility Green Fuel Nordic Oy BTG-BTL Fast pyrolysis Active since 2020 France ReSolute project Circa Group Circa Group (FuracellTM) Catalytic pyrolysis Under development (for 2024) Netherlands Empyro Twence BTG-BTL Fast pyrolysis Active since 2015 Sweden Pyrocell pyrolysis plant Pyrocell AB Technip FMX & BTG-BTL Fast pyrolysis Active since 2021 USA Ensyn Georgia project Ensyn Ensyn (RTP®) Fast pyrolysis Under development USA Red Arrow facilities Kerry Group Ensyn (RTP®) Fast pyrolysis Active since 1995\n\nDemonstration Direct Thermochemical Liquefaction Plants:"
