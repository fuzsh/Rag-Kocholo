Abe took these lessons to heart.\n\nAbe’s own career began at non-union Columbia Distributing, and he went about joining the Teamsters the hard way: by organizing his coworkers. After a long and difficult campaign, Abe and his 300+ coworkers voted to join Teamsters Local 174, and he has never looked back.\n\nAbe stayed involved with the Union and eventually met Secretary-Treasurer Rick Hicks, who encouraged him to get more involved in Local 174.

He has negotiated hundreds of contracts, and coordinated a team of Business Agents responsible for over 5,000 Local 117 members.\n\nMarcus also has meaningful leadership experience. He was elected to serve as a Delegate to the last two IBT Conventions, and he was appointed to the Local 117 Executive Board as Vice President in 2015. He was then reelected to continue serving in that position until 2019, when he departed Local 117 to join the staff of Teamsters Local 670 in Salem, Oregon.\n\nIt was in Salem that he first cut his teeth in the world of UPS, serving as UPS Business Agent – this on top of his roles as food production Business Agent and Organizer. Within UPS, he was responsible for multiple package centers and feeder hubs."
