        "text": "Numerous studies have demonstrated a close association between mean consumption and the prevalence of alcohol related harm (1), which has been a motivation for policies that aim to reduce total consumption of alcohol in societies. The prime theory that has been used to explain and understand this connection and to justify the control policies, is Skog's theory of the collectivity of drinking cultures (2). As the theory has significant implications for prevention strategies and it has been very influential for alcohol policy (3), its constituent parts also require careful empirical testing.\n\nWhen developing his theory, Skog's point of departure was the strong regularity in the distribution of alcohol consumption that had been reported in several studies (4-6). Skog hypothesized and demonstrated, first, that – due to stochastic multiplicativity – the distribution was strongly skewed to the right, as also illustrated by the finding that 10% of drinkers consume more than half of the alcohol (7). Secondly, he showed that the population mean was very strongly associated with the proportion of heavy drinkers (2), a key group with respect to chronic alcohol-induced harm in particular. The third, and from a policy point-of-view the most important prediction, was that temporal changes as well as differences between populations take the form of a parallel, i.e. a collective, displacement of the whole distribution of consumption: the change or difference is seen in all consumption categories, including light, moderate and heavy drinkers. It should be noted that the second prediction follows from the third one, but not vice versa, i.e. in principle it is possible for mean consumption and heavy drinking to correlate without collectivity (8). According to the theory, the collectivity is caused by social interaction and interdependence of drinkers (2, 8).\n\nThe reason for why the collective nature of the change is so central lies in the policy implications: if the changes are collective, a universal alcohol policy aiming to control mean consumption of the population is rational, whereas if the connection between mean consumption and heavy drinkers is limited to heavy drinkers only, then the connection would seem to be driven by changes in heavy drinking, and universal policies were less justified.\n\nThe data used by Skog (2)as evidence of collectivity was mainly cross-sectional. By comparing populations he showed that, for example, in one population with twice the mean consumption of another, both moderate drinkers (whose consumption corresponds to the 50th percentile value) and the heavy drinkers (whose consumption corresponds to the 95th percentile value) drank roughly twice as much as the corresponding consumer groups in the other population. Also most of the other empirical support for the theory so far stems from comparisons of different populations (e.g. (2, 9)). Although the theory is often applied to predictions of within-population temporal change, there are few studies that have addressed this empirically. For this reason, there has been skepticism towards using the theory to make predictions for within-population temporal change (3). The numerous studies demonstrating close associations between mean consumption and indicators of heavy drinking (1) do not necessarily imply collective displacement. It should be noted that Skog's theory does not make predictions about individual-level change, but of marginal distributions (e.g. what happens to heavy drinking in the population) (8). Therefore, repeated cross-sectional data are more optimal than panel data for testing the predictions and an additional benefit is that problems relating to regression to the mean are avoided.\n\nIn his 1985 article, Skog stated that more data on changes over time were needed. Fifteen years later, Gmel and Rehm (3) noted that there was still surprisingly little empirical evidence, especially recently, to support Skog's key assumptions. With regard to observations of changes over time, they referred to eight studies applying such data within populations. Only two of these (10, 11) examined empirically the question of collective displacement over time. These two studies provided empirical support for Skog's theory. In his response to Gmel and Rehm (3), Skog (8) referred to two additional studies of relevance in this respect (12, 13), which illuminated how other social factors (e.g. strict formal or informal control, or structural factors such as income or prices) may result in exceptions to collective displacement over time yet not contradict the theory. In addition to these few studies, we have conducted a literature search and examined the following studies: all studies referring to Skog (2) (n=264); to Lemmens and co-workers (11) (n=12); to Gmel and Rehm (3) (n=17) and Skog (8) (n=11). This search retrieved only one further study of this kind (14). It showed that among Stockholm youth, alcohol consumption was reduced for most drinkers over the 2000-2010 period, while the heaviest consumers mostly increased their consumption (14). Moreover, in recent years there have been some examples of diverging trends in alcohol consumption and alcohol related harms (15, 16), which may suggest that mechanisms other than collective changes in drinking behavior have been at work. Thus, empirical studies that have put Skog's theory to test are still surprisingly few and the findings are mixed with respect to the extent to which temporal changes follow the expectation derived from the theory.\n\nGiven that Skog's theory has been so influential with respect to alcohol policy, efforts to overcome several suggested weaknesses of its empirical testability are warranted (3). Among these weaknesses are: 1) the limited empirical support for collectivity in changes of drinking behavior over time, and 2) the question of symmetry in collective changes, i.e. whether collective changes occur in the same way both when mean consumption goes up and when it goes down.\n\nThe aim of this study is to put these aspects of the collectivity theory to further empirical test by analyzing data over time within three populations for which population drinking has either significantly increased or decreased over time and for which good-quality survey data comparable across this time exists: the Finnish and the Norwegian population (mainly increasing trends), and the US population (mainly decreasing trend). More specifically, we wanted to assess 1) whether a change in mean consumption is accompanied by a change in the prevalence of heavy drinkers and, more importantly, 2) whether this mean change reflects a collective displacement in the whole distribution of consumption, and 3) whether a collective displacement is found for both an upward and a downward shift in mean consumption.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAnalyses of data on changes over time from three countries produced findings in line with predictions of Skog's theory of the distribution of alcohol consumption and thus add to the empirical evidence on the theory. The findings further suggested that collective displacements in alcohol consumption are seen both when overall consumption increases and decreases.\n\nOur finding that changes in mean consumption were positively correlated with changes in the prevalence of heavy drinkers is well in line with previous studies, which demonstrated that changes in mean consumption are associated with changes in levels of harm typically seen in heavy drinkers (20-22). However, this finding alone is not sufficient to offer any evidence about collectivity. Even a strong association between mean consumption and heavy drinking does not indicate, as a logical necessity, that a change in mean consumption is accompanied by a change in the same direction by all consumer groups (8). As alcohol consumption is strongly skewed and the heaviest drinkers account for a large proportion of the total consumption, changes in heavy drinkers’ consumption could, in principle, account for the changes in mean consumption (3). If that had been the case, we would not have found positive associations between mean consumption and low and medium percentile values and the corresponding lines in would not be ascending. Our findings suggest, however, that changes in mean consumption in the three countries studied have reflected changes in consumption at low and medium as well as high levels of consumption. This was further illustrated by the positive association between the prevalence of heavy drinkers and the mean consumption among other than heavy drinkers. In other words, changes in heavy drinking seem to be part of collective changes, represented by the mean consumption, and changes that occur in the population are reflected both in the population's heavy drinking and other forms of drinking.\n\nOur findings mirror those of Skog (2), although there are also differences. Skog's analyses were mainly based on regional differences rather than temporal changes. The variation in population drinking in his data was very large; i.e. the mean consumption varied by a factor of 20, which rarely occurs in temporal variation. Moreover, Skog found that the regression coefficients were larger for the lighter drinking groups; i.e. a change in mean consumption was accompanied by a relatively larger change at lower consumption levels and he interpreted this as light drinkers being more susceptible to variations in the cultural climate than heavy drinkers (2). While this seems generally plausible, such a tendency was only clearly found in the Finnish data in this study.\n\nThe few studies that have previously addressed collective changes in alcohol consumption over longer periods of time produced mixed results (10, 11, 14). Whereas the Dutch studies found empirical support for a collective displacement over a period with increasing consumption (10, 11), this was not the case in the Swedish study of youth alcohol consumption addressing a period with an overall decreasing trend in consumption (14). An analysis of the Finnish panel data from 1968 and 1969, when alcohol consumption increased by about 50 %, demonstrated also a collective change in all consumer groups (23). The present findings from the Finnish and Norwegian data are well in line with the above-mentioned previous studies (10, 11, 23) reporting a collective upward change in consumption in all consumer groups when total consumption increases. Our findings from the US data do not, however, resemble those from the Swedish study (14), but rather suggest a symmetry in the collective displacement, i.e. all consumer groups move collectively in the same direction, both when mean consumption increases and decreases. Our findings thus lend empirical support to Skog's phrase “As a main rule, the population tends to move in concert up and down the scale of consumption” (2).\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThe data applied in these analyses cover fairly long time periods with significant changes in mean alcohol consumption in three different countries, and comparable population samples and measurements within each country were applied. The number of population samples was fairly small for each country, which reduced the test power and increased the risk of non-statistically significant associations (i.e. a Type II error). Methodological changes (e.g. falling response rates) may have affected the inclusion of heavier drinkers, and if this were the case, the variation in estimates of mean and high percentile values may have been deflated. However, the coverage rates have not systematically changed with time, which suggests that heavy drinkers have not increasingly dropped out of the studies. Moreover, the selection of empirical cases was limited to a small number of high income countries where alcohol consumption is fairly widespread and culturally well integrated.\n\nImplications\n\nThe importance of the present findings pertain both to public health and to the choice of strategies to prevent alcohol related harms at the population level. If changes in mean consumption were attributable only to the heaviest drinkers, one could argue that prevention strategies should be aimed at this high-risk segment of the population. However, the observation of a collective displacement of consumption suggests that universal prevention strategies that target all consumer groups (population strategies) may be more appropriate. They reach all consumer groups, moderate and heavy drinkers alike. By affecting the whole drinking culture collectively, they may actually be an efficient way to affect the heaviest drinkers.\n\nWhile the present study lends support to Skog's theory with respect to collective changes over time, this literature is still very limited. Further studies are therefore warranted, including studies that address individual changes over time in relation to collective changes and studies from other drinking cultures and other parts of the world."
