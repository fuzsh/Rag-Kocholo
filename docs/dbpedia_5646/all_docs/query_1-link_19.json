        "text": "London. GSO Capital Partners (“GSO”) is pleased to have reached terms with Norske Skogindustrier ASA (the “Company” or “Norske Skog”) for a deleveraging and liquidity injection that, we believe, will give management greater flexibility to execute its business plan to benefit from the cyclical upswing in paper prices.\n\nAs a result of the transactions, GSO will have a large minority equity interest in a substantially strengthened group with a favourable operational outlook. By ensuring that Norske Skog continues as a stronger business, we believe these transactions will preserve existing jobs and that they are in the best long-term interests of stakeholders. GSO intends to work closely with management to allow Norske Skog to play an active role in industry consolidation.\n\nFor further information:\n\nAndrew Dowler\n\nGSO/Blackstone\n\n+44 (0)20 7451 4275\n\nGSO\n\nGSO Capital Partners LP is the global credit investment platform of Blackstone.
