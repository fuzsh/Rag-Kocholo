        "text": "Seeking Federal Funding: A Guide for Local Governments\n\nSkog Rasmussen LLC is grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this resource produced by client Urban Sustainability Directors Network for its network of local government members across the country. Although tailored for local government, the document contains pro tips and insights about the grant process and examples of grant applications that can be valuable to anyone seeking federal grants.\n\nInnovative Partnership Award to Hua Nani Partners\n\nHua Nani Partners recently won the 2024 Innovative Partnership Award—one of the Climate Leadership Awards rewarding exemplary leadership in response to climate change—for their work on the State Funding Readiness Project (SFRP). Skog Rasmussen LLC is honored to be a part of this team.\n\nSFRP was awarded the Innovative Partnership Award, which recognizes organizations working collaboratively on leading-edge climate initiatives that are above and beyond business-as-usual. As a partnership between program manager, Hua Nani Partners, and strategic partner, the U.S. Climate Alliance, SFRP strengthens subnational leadership and unlocks the full potential of federal climate investments. This unique, cross-sectoral model—funded by philanthropy, managed by a woman-owned small business, and guided by a non-profit alliance—fills critical capacity gaps in subnational jurisdictions and channels federal funding to ambitious, equitable climate projects.\n\nEPA Solar for All Grant Projects\n\nIn collaboration with McAllister & Quinn and Hua Nani Partners, Skog Rasmussen LLC is humbled to have been able to contribute to $1.2 billion in EPA Solar for All grant projects touching almost every state—including Hawaiʻi!—and two territories. Overall, 60 selected applicants will create new or expand existing low-income solar programs to enable more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from distributed solar energy. Read more about the commitments here.\n\nHawaiʻi Community Foundation Regional Water Infrastructure Environmental Finance Center\n\nSkog Rasmussen LLC is glad to be a part of the team for a new Hawaiʻi Community Foundation Regional Water Infrastructure Environmental Finance Center (EFC). The EFC launched in January 2024 with Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funding under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help communities across the state access federal funding for infrastructure projects that improve public health and environmental protection.\n\nUrban and Community Forestry Grant program\n\nCongratulations to our clients who were awarded a total of $58 million through the Urban and Community Forestry Grant program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service. Skog Rasmussen assisted with three successful applications including those from Kupu in Hawaii ($20 million); Hennepin County in Minnesota ($10 million), and the Urban Sustainability Directors Network, operating across the United States and Canada ($5.6 million for organization, $22.4 million for subawards). Read more.\n\nUSDN 2022 Annual Report\n\nSkog Rasmussen helped to design and continues to implement the Federal Funding Technical Assistance program for the Urban Sustainability Directors Network which has members in 270+ local governments in Hawaiʻi, across the U.S., and in Canada. Under this program USDN delivered hundreds of hours of coaching, technical assistance, and training and helped communities secure over $100 million in state and federal funding with proposal assistance. View the USDN Annual Report.\n\nMorning Beat - Hawaii Farmers Could Use Some Help Landing Grants That Would Boost Farm Operations\n\nThe reality is that Hawaii does not have a full-fledged “grant culture,” and could be doing more on several levels, according to Melissa Unemori Hampe of the economic development consultancy Skog Rasmussen. “People need to understand the basics, the terminology, and they need help,” Hampe said.
