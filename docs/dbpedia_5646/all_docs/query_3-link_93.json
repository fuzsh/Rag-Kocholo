        "text": "I love to tell stories of transformation. I believe one of the reasons the Lord led me to The Dwelling Place (TDP) was because there are stories to be told. In the short time that I have gotten to know Jacquie, I have realized she is a catalyst for growth in the lives of the women at TDP. She is a witness to the renewal taking place in many different ways, whether it is here at TDP, through her clients, and her own story. I was eager to learn more, and I wanted to share with you some of the insight and passion she brings to our mission every day. I hope you are as encouraged as I was when you read her words.\n\nMeagan: How long have you been involved with TDP? What ways have you served over the years?\n\nJacquie: I’ve been involved in the TDP ministry since 2006 as a board member, board chair, support group leader, alumni group leader, intercessory prayer team member, and professional Counselor for the residents.\n\nM: What changes have you seen during this time?\n\nJ: The growth of the mission and ministry of TDP has been progressively more effective, compassionate, and responsive to the needs of the residents and their children. Since 2006 when I first joined the board, the facilities have grown from 2 homes in a crime ridden neighborhood with a capacity of 4-6 women and their children to 5 homes equipped to serve 57 women and their children. In 2006, there were 3 dedicated employees and several volunteers who ran the ministry. Today, we have over 20 professional and passionate staff and consultants, and over 100 volunteers to collaborate care with the Christ-centered, in-depth programming.\n\nM: What makes TDP unique from other transitional housing for Domestic Violence?\n\nJ: TDP is unique in that we proclaim Christ and teach Biblical truths about every woman’s identity in Christ as the primary goal for all phases of the TDP program. All programs are designed to provide compassionate care by responding to the needs of each woman and her family according to their expressed desires.\n\nOur staff is equipped to identify symptoms of trauma and give trauma-informed care to address anxiety, anger, depression, post-traumatic stress flashbacks, chemical dependency, and other negative life-controlling behaviors that interfere with the stability of the residents and their children. The Intercessory Prayer Team specifically prays for the needs of our residents and their children, staff, volunteers, board members, as well as our donors and their families. The team meets monthly and publishes a prayer list several times each month. The team is comprised of dedicated believers in Christ who share the belief that faith in Christ plus education in a safe environment are the answers for the healing of the lives of those caught in the web of enemy and abuse.\n\nThe Alumni Support Program engages the residents after they have graduated from the TDP program and are out on their own. The response from former residents has been encouraging. At each alumni gathering, a family of volunteers provides and serves a meal to the women and their children. After dinner, the volunteers engage the children in active play in the safety of our meeting space. While the children are at play, their mother’s meet with staff to discuss a specific topic in which they are encouraged to share their thoughts and experiences. Sharing has been rich with past, present, and future implications for each woman.\n\nM: What trends in domestic violence are you seeing in your private practice since 2020\n\nand into 2022?\n\nJ: Although the calls for help decreased somewhat across the nation, the incidents of DV did not change. In my practice, there has been a twenty percent increase in client’s reporting that the isolation made things more difficult at home. Fear, anxiety, and depression were more troublesome in marriage relationships which interfered with the ability to maintain stable parenting methods and regulate intense emotions. The stress that parents and children felt from the worry and fears about the pandemic contributed to a loss of safety in the families seeking help from counseling professionals.\n\nM: What would you say to a donor who is curious about the value of their giving?"
