        "text": "In 1989, plans were announced to build a paper mill in Golbey. Before that, there was nothing, as you can see from this photo!\n\nIt all started in 1990 with the laying of the 1st stone at Norske Skog Golbey.\n\nAfter 2 years of work, newsprint is on PM1.\n\n6 months later, the teams are proud to celebrate the production of the 100,000th tonnes of paper.\n\n7 years after the start-up of PM1, we built and launched newsprint production on a second machine (PM2).\n\nIt started at a speed of 1,509 m/min. However, the PM2 very quickly increased its output and set world speed records. These records still hang in front of the control room today!\n\nIn 2002, we obtained the ISO 9001 certification for our quality management.\n\nIn 2005, we obtained the ISO 14001 certification for our environmental management.\n\n2006 marked a major turning point in our history: from a production unit, we became a Business Unit. This status gives us a bigger degree of autonomy in our decision-making and strategic vision.\n\nIn 2011, in patnership with the Epinal urban community, we launched an Industrial and Territorial Ecology (ITE) project: the Green Valley. In 2014, it was awarded the Circular Economy prize by the French Minister for the Environment, Ségolène Royal.\n\nIn 2012, we published our first CSR report, formalising our approach to Corporate, Environmental and Social Responsibility.\n\nIn 2015, our company was restructured. Our group, Norske Skog, which is experiencing financial difficulties, is initiating a plan to reduce the workforce in all its Business Units. Norske Skog Golbey will have to reduce its workforce by 70 people, including 40 early retirements and 10 voluntary departures.\n\nIn 2016, we obtained the ISO 50001 certification for our energy management system.\n\nIn 2016, we began research and development projects focusing on the bioeconomy.\n\nIn 2017, the Norske Skog group filed for bankruptcy. After a year of uncertainty, it was bought by the OceanWood investment fund in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, we opened our first biogas production unit. This would enable us to produce biomethane and inject it into the local gas grid. A second biogas unit has been built as part of our diversification. By the end of 2024, the biogas produced will be used to generate steam for our production process.\n\nIn 2019, as part of the CRE5 call for projects, the French energy regulation commission gave its go-ahead for the construction of a biomass cogeneration boiler on our site. Coordinated by the GVE project company, the foundation stone for this boiler was laid in November 2022 (see the picture).\n\nDue to the structural decline in the newsprint market, we decided in 2020 to diversify into a new market: the recycled containerboard market.\n\nIn 2021, the first work linked to our diversification began at our mill. In place of the visitor car park, there is now a fully automated warehouse for storing reels of containerboard.\n\nIn the second half of 2024, we will launch production of containerboard on our PM1 (Paper Machine no. 1). The biomass cogeneration boiler built to the north of our site and managed by GVE will also be operational by the same time."
