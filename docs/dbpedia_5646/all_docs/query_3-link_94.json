        "text": "Inspired by the Swedish way of life - the peaceful balance of the eco-conscious way of living and being mindful of nature. SKÖG was started on the east coast of Sweden in 2018 by Gautami Agarwal with an eye on capturing the very essence of Swedish bliss.\n\nOur B.Cult(ure) community members, including model, actress and entrepreneur Vahbiz Chinoy, were among the first in Singapore to test and review the Daily Care Kit. Read on as Vahbiz shares her experience and views of SKÖG’s Daily Care Kit, a collection of the Clarifying & Brightening Serum, Under Eye Repair Oil and Frizzy Hair Serum.\n\nHi Vahbiz, thank you for joining us today on a review session for the Daily Care Kit from clean beauty brand SKÖG. Before we dive right into the products, you have beautiful flawless skin. Can you share with us a little background on your skin type and concerns?\n\nFirstly, I’d like to thank you for your kind words. I’m very passionate about skincare and I try my best to constantly adapt my skincare routine based on the changing needs of my skin. Presently, my main concerns are redness and irritation, especially around the nose, cheeks and chin area.\n\nExposure to the sun and mask-wearing tend to cause these issues for me, which is why my current skincare routine is heavily focused on using sunscreen to keep my skin protected from the sun and using a hydrating moisturiser to keep my skin happy and hydrated under the mask.\n\nA good first impression can work wonders! What was the first thing that popped into your mind when you first came across this set?\n\nCLEAN. That was the first thought I had when I looked at the set. There is a simplicity about it which is very attractive as it reflects well on the ingredients and brand’s philosophy. SKÖG is all about using fresh, natural and clean ingredients to formulate their range. At first sight, I noticed that the packaging is also mostly made out of recyclable materials, which is brilliant in my opinion. That’s because I believe it’s very important to simultaneously care for the planet while caring for your skin\n\nSKÖG’s products have a relatively strong and unique scent from its unique natural oils and ingredients. Some find it calming and soothing to their senses while others aren’t fans of it. What’s your take?\n\nPersonally, I thoroughly enjoy scented products as they stimulate my senses in a similar way to aromatherapy. I adore natural, floral and sweet scents and SKÖG’s range has a very unique scent that falls somewhere between natural and floral. The notes of tea tree oil and birch sap remind me of a forest and provide a delightful calming experience for my senses while I am applying my skincare. The fragrance isn’t too overwhelming or overpowering and it tends to linger for a short while which is something that I appreciate!\n\nLet’s dive right into the details! First up, the Clarifying & Brightening Serum. This moisturising treatment oil is made from a unique blend of cold pressed botanical oils that can help prevent breakouts, smoothen complexion and brighten skin tone. What was your experience like?\n\nI had a wonderful experience with SKÖG’s Clarifying & Brightening Serum! I use it just before my moisturiser and I feel that it hydrates and locks in moisture with its nourishing oils. I reach out for this, especially on days when I find that my skin needs more moisture and deep nourishment; after using this serum my skin feels more soft and supple. It also doubles up as a primer for me, I apply a few drops on my face before going in with my foundation and it applies so smoothly, leaving a dewy natural finish.\n\nMoving on to the Frizzy Hair Serum. Singapore’s humidity coupled with the intense UV rays can wreak havoc on our tresses. How do you think this serum has helped with managing your (frizzy) hair?\n\nMy hair tends to have a lot of flyaways and frizz, especially on extremely hot and humid days. SKÖG’s Frizzy Hair Serum comes to the rescue on days like those! I like to apply the serum when my hair is damp after a wash as this helps seal in the deep conditioning oils. My hair looks noticeably shinier and healthier while remaining tangle-free as well. A little bit goes a long way for this serum, it’s very nourishing and smoothing on the hair without making it greasy or adding any weight.\n\nThe Under Eye Repair Oil contains another interesting ingredient, Apricot Oil. Effective against dryness, dark circles, puffiness and fine lines, what was your experience using this oil treatment?\n\nI have very sensitive and delicate skin around the eye area and even the slightest tugging results in bruising around my eyes so I have to be very mindful when applying any product here. SKÖG’s Under Eye Repair Oil has a roll-on applicator which, for me, is the perfect solution for a gentle application on the delicate skin near the eyes.\n\nThe oil itself is very rich and hydrating, it moisturises and keeps any dryness at bay which I believe is key in preventing dark circles and puffiness under the eyes. I make sure to use this before applying any makeup around my eyes as it makes the application buttery smooth and reduces the chances of creasing.\n\nWhich is your favourite item in this set?\n\nHonestly, all three products from SKÖG’s Daily Care Kit are such a joy to use, but if I have to choose one it will definitely be the Under Eye Repair Oil. It's one of the best, natural, under eye products I’ve used as it delivers rich and deep hydration that lasts all day with an easy applicator. The skin around my eyes are also noticeably healthier and more resilient since I started using it.\n\nWhat more would you like to see or experience from this set?\n\nI would love to see sunscreen from SKÖG in this set as I believe it is a daily essential. Based on my wonderful experience with their range so far I would have very high hopes for this sunscreen and wish for it to be introduced someday soon!\n\nCould you share some tips with new users looking to try this set?\n\nWhether you are a beginner just starting your skincare journey or an expert in building your personalised skincare routine, I think this set can work for you either way. It's simple enough to be very beginner-friendly but has elements that can serve a purpose and pull their weight in a more complicated skincare routine as well.\n\nMy biggest tip to new users is to slowly introduce elements from the set into your skincare routine. This ensures that your skin doesn’t become overwhelmed with new ingredients all at once and provides better long term effects.\n\nFinally, would you recommend this set to your friends and family with a similar skin profile as yourself?\n\nI recommend this set to anyone who is looking for nourishment and hydration of the skin and hair as it delivers beautifully on this front. I think it can work on all skin types, especially for those who have dry, normal and combination skin. It’s absolutely worth it if you’re looking to build a skincare routine and can even function as an essential travel kit for your vacations."
