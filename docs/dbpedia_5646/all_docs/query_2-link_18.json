        "text": "Sweden's forest policy was fundamentally changed in 1993. Timber production and maintenance of biodiversity then became objectives of equal dignity. In the past, timber production had been the single primary aim of Swedish forest policy. The strategy established for maintaining biodiversity is based on a system of forest reserves and management of the matrix that mimics natural processes and builds in natural structures at the stand and, when applicable, the landscape level. One reason for not basing the strategy on reserves only is that almost all Swedish forests have been intensively managed and, as a consequence, there is a shortage of areas suitable for reserves. The new forest policy presupposes a consensus in the forestry sector of the importance of maintaining biodiversity. Training and information are as important as legislation. Maintenance of biodiversity is not an operative goal. This makes it difficult to predict the outcome of the policy and, consequently, there is a need for monitoring routines to enable changes to policy implementation. Such routines have yet to be developed."
