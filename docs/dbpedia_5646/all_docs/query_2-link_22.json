        "text": "Skog, my PhD Advisor, Friend, Mentor and Boss\n\nDr. Prathapar from Australia wrote a glowing tribute to a friend on his birthday, yesterday. Professor Skogerboe, we always called him Skog, died in 2006. Had he lived, he would have been 80 years old yesterday. The post included a beautiful portrait of the writer with colorful background. First I was planning to respond him on the Facebook, so, I wrote him: “What a beautiful background, Dr. Prathapar. Is it in Australia? With the charm of the background, you look very graceful too. Wish you to stay healthy and wealthy”. Then I decided to use LinkedIn instead, I went on to add the following text:\n\nWhat a wonderful world that we all perceive the happenings in our lives based on the information at hand to make us believe so. The senior staff you mentioned, he knew the outcome when acting DG, prior to David Seckler’s selection as DG, had to take a U-turn to cancel his arrangements in the process and the orders issued regarding the transfer of the referred staff to Sri Lanka. As a consequence, the senior staff ended up in Lahore. Even a naive person like me got the message for the things to come.\n\nThere were other reasons in this drama, I was told by Prof. Skogerboe that he had applied 2-3 times in different positions with IIMI/ IWMI. But each time, there were some old good “friends” at the HQ who made sure that he (Skogerboe) was not even shortlisted. This was very discouraging for Professor Skogerboe to endure.\n\nIn the seventies, since Skogerboe happened to run a successful water management project in Pakistan with a huge appreciation and experience of Pakistan, I for one was very keen to have Professor Skogerboe take up the position of director, IIMI-Pakistan. I, therefore, played a role to motivate him to join IIMI to make IIMI-PK also as one of the most performing centers. My one to one meeting with Dr. Roberto Lenton, DG of IWMI, in Cairo and my contacts with Dr. Zafar Altaf, Chairman of IIMI's BOD, and other support links like the DG of OFWM (MA GILL) and Dr, Shahid of PARC managed to get Prof. Skogerboe as the director of IIMIPK.\n\nSince the professor only gave his consent to accept the job if offered, but he refused to apply again, Dr. Lenton asked me to nominate Skogerboe for the job to initiate the process. This was done and somehow we got our favorite person to head IIMI-Pakistan. Soon after that appointment, Dr. David Seckler was selected as the new DG of IIMI and I knew that David Seckler and Professor Skogerboe were not the best friends. Both honorable persons came from the Colorado State University, but I never met Dr. David Seckler even as a consultant on the project that Professor Skogerboe was heading in Pakistan. There were many professors of Economics Department who visited Pakistan, but David Seckler did not, as far as I remember. Now, when the tables were turned, it is quite possible that score settling opportunity might have played some role in the resignation of the most successful director of IIMI.\n\nAs explained in my earlier response, Dr. David Seckler did not have anything personal misgiving against me, though I was considered to be a close friend of Skoerboe. However, when the selection process was in progress, my two senior colleagues brought me a petition to sign on behalf of the Acting DG to be considered as another candidate for the top position of IIMI. As a principle, the Acting DG was not supposed to request so, but he made his PhD student and Sr. Staff of IIMI-Sri Lanka to act as a proxy to initiate the process. I did something awful and against my own principles on the persuasion of the Sri Lankan Colleague and my two senior team members (one was the team leader) in Egypt to sign the petition. Interestingly, my two senior team members themselves never signed the petition and I was ending up in a wrong camp just because going along the flow of friends. My naivety? What else it could be? To my regret, I supported a person who was not supposed to apply as per his deal of accepting the acting position of DG. That could have created some misunderstanding between Dr. David Seckler and I.\n\nThere was one more happening that was another factor that might not have made me a favorite person of the new DG. We participated in a seminar organized by David Seckler and Jack Keller in Cairo, where they presented their new theory of water management. I did not accept Keller-Jack thesis of dry and wet water as I took the side of Dr. Wayne Clyma in Seminar on the new water management or no management concept. Obviously, my stated position on his perceived innovative theory might not have made me a right person to promote Keller-David theory of water management in IIMI.\n\nAfter the referred seminar in Cairo, there was a conference in Kenya that was attended by the newly selected DG, Dr. Seckler and the Acting DG of IIMI. This was a few months earlier when David Seckler took up his assignment of DG, IIMI. During this transition, the acting DG had issued orders of my transfer to Colombo and all arrangements were made. However, what transpired in Kenya, any guess is as good as mine, the Acting DG had to reverse my prior transfer orders and relevant arrangements in Colombo, direct from Kenya. So, that decision was taken much before you, Dr. Prathapar, joined IIMI. Since that day of June 1995, I have known and told everyone in Sudan and Pakistan about the end of my job with IIMI.\n\nDr. Prathapar, I am sure that there would have many shortcomings in me too, but those deficiencies were also there earlier when I got special awards of excellence for more than one year. Since it's a rerun of your tribute to Skogerboe, I thought it appropriate to present my views on the same subject. In my view, you were not a replacement of the referred senior staff of IIMI, you could take it as a compliment that you were sent to replace Skogerboe. Glad that you both found some common ground to appreciate each other, even at a late stage, but David Seckler got his sweet revenge as Skogerboe kept Dr. David Seckler away from the Water Management Project in Pakistan that is now the program opted in all four provinces of Pakistan.\n\nAnother piece of information, Sgokerboe resigned after his and your meeting with Zafar Altaf in Islamabad. Dr. Zafar Altaf was then facilitated with an office and a research assistant by IWMI by the courtesy of your office. Skogerboe was very sure to have the support of Dr. Zafar Altaf the way he was managing the IIMI program in Pakistan, but Professor Skogerboe was let down by Dr. Zafar Altaf, a trusted friend. In my view, that was the last straw that broke the camel's back and Skogerboe decided to resign. Thereafter, it was a race down the hill for IIMI in Pakistan. Today, IIMI/ IWMI-PK appears more like the Harappa remains..\n\nSince Professor Skogerboe was my PhD advisor, friend, mentor and boss, I have an honor to stand by him at an extremely difficult time in IIMI. I kept working without salary and other benefits for almost 2 years just to let him keep helping Pakistan. Dr. Wayne Clyma and Professor Skogerboe remain my top mentors and teachers who did all the grooming of me, from nobody to become somebody. This is the second part of my story of life as a commoner in Pakistan.\n\nHad I signed the new extension letter for the water down benefit package for two more years in June 1997, even if I resigned after six months, it would have entitled me to enjoy life long medical insurance. For a person like me, who had a heart problem/ suffered a heart attack, that opportunity was very tempting. Instead I resigned, it sounds a bit stupid on my part. However, if I campare with what the above referred two professors did for me, Professor Clyma and professor Skogeroe, such an insurance means not much. My gesture remains untainted to keep helping my friend even without salary and other benefits for straight two years. You will be astonished to know that the reffered professors were not friendly to each either, rather, the only common thing between them was I as a friend. On the lighter side, when Skogerboe and his wife were separated, I was a common friend to keep them calm. In other words, a sincere and selfless friendship among all races happens and it will continue to happen so."
