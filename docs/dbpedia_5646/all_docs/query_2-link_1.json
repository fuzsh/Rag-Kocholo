        "text": "Introduction\n\nA large body of research has documented a positive association between total alcohol consumption and related harm at the population level [1]. This observation forms a cornerstone of alcohol epidemiology, and acts as the main motivation for general population approaches that aim to prevent alcohol‐related harm by reducing the total consumption [2, 3, 4, 5]. Such approaches mainly involve policy measures targeting the price and availability of alcohol [6].\n\nThe key theory for understanding the mechanism underlying the population‐level association between alcohol and harm is provided by Skog's theory of the collectivity of drinking cultures and focuses on how alcohol consumption tends to shift within populations [7]. According to Skog, individual drinking behaviour is heavily affected by mechanisms of social interaction, both through direct personal interaction and in the form of more indirect social control. This social process aggregates up to a complex pattern of interdependencies between individual members of a group, or even an entire society, so that it displays a strong collectivity in its drinking behaviour. More specifically, Skog predicts that changes in overall mean consumption tend to occur as collective shifts across drinkers at all levels of the consumption distribution, including heavy drinkers [8]. As a result, changes in overall mean alcohol consumption tend to be positively associated with changes in alcohol‐related harm, and for this reason, alcohol policy measures that reduce mean alcohol consumption will also tend to lower the prevalence of alcohol‐related harm [3].\n\nSkog's own empirical research was based on survey‐derived consumption data from cross‐sectional samples of different populations, and did not actually assess temporal changes within populations. However, the theory has more recently been tested on temporal data within countries, and received strong empirical support for adult populations [7, 9] as well as for youth [10, 11, 12].\n\nStill, few studies have tested if changes in mean consumption tend to occur as collective shifts also across subgroups of the population, for instance, across different socioeconomic strata—which is the focus of the present study. This question is highly relevant from a policy perspective, considering the increasing evidence of an alcohol harm paradox, that is, the observation that groups with low socioeconomic position (SEP) experience a disproportionally large share of alcohol‐related harm, although they tend to drink less, or at least not more, than other social strata [13, 14, 15, 16]. Moreover, a recent study applying auto‐regressive integrated moving average time series modelling to Swedish data for the period 1990–2017, found that a 1 L increase in per capita consumption was associated with a larger increase in the number of alcohol‐related deaths among low than among highly educated groups [17]. A possible explanation of this finding is that there has been a differential development in SEP‐specific alcohol consumption trajectories, with increases in per capita consumption disproportionally allocated to low SEP‐groups, which would imply an exception from the pattern of collectivity.\n\nAccording to Skog [18], exceptions from the pattern of collectivity are plausible under some circumstances. First, the network effect underlying the synchronisation of drinking may be constrained by social and cultural boundaries between population subgroups, resulting in more or less diverging drinking trajectories across social strata. Second, Skog noted that consumption is influenced by numerous structural factors, for example, real income and alcohol prices/taxation, and that changes in these factors may have a differential impact on the alcohol consumption across SEP‐groups. In line with this, some studies have found diverging trajectories of consumption and/or related harm across SEP‐groups following changes in the economic availability of alcohol [19, 20, 21, 22]. One such case is Finland, where a 33% reduction of alcohol excise taxes in 2004 resulted in increased alcohol‐related mortality mainly among less privileged groups (unemployed and early‐age pensioners) [19]. However, other findings are more inconclusive. For instance, one study tested the hypothesis that the increased affordability of alcohol in Sweden that followed from the EU membership in 1995 would be associated with an increase in SEP‐differences in alcohol‐related mortality [23]. Findings suggested that this was the case for women but not for men. Furthermore, a more recent and systematic study from Germany [24] explored possible explanations for diverging trends in alcohol consumption and related harm by testing for polarisation in drinking within and across SEP‐groups. Although the rate of change tended to be larger among higher consumption levels, all SEP‐groups showed a general decrease in consumption during the study period. Still, to our knowledge, no study has applied Skog's analytical approach to directly test whether changes in mean consumption tend to reflect collective shifts also across SEP‐groups.\n\nAgainst this background, the present study aims to perform a more comprehensive test of whether Skog's notion of collectivity of drinking is also valid across SEP‐groups. To this aim, we will apply Skog's analytical approach on data from a unique, annually repeated national Swedish cross‐sectional alcohol use survey, and assess whether yearly changes in the mean consumption of alcohol between 2004 and 2014 have occurred as collective shifts across educational groups. Moreover, because SEP‐differences in heavy episodic drinking (HED) tend to account for a larger proportion of the social gradient in alcohol‐related mortality and morbidity than does the average volume of consumption [25], we also test whether changes in per capita consumption are echoed in collective shifts in the prevalence of HED across educational groups.\n\nIt should be noted that Skog's theory makes predictions about marginal distributions, not about individual‐level changes in drinking. Thus, the finding that an increase in total consumption by, say 10%, reflects an increase by about 10% in all consumption groups, from light to heavy drinkers, does not imply that every individual drinker has increased his/her drinking by 10%. Some may have increased more, some less (or even decreased) [see Ref. 18]. The degree of divergency in the pattern underlying these collective movements is of interest in itself, but it is not the issue that our study addresses. Our methodological approach is thus the same as that which has been applied in other tests of Skog's theory of collectivity [7, 10]. The novelty of our study is that we test whether the theory of collectivity is valid not only across consumption groups (light to heavy drinkers), but also across SEP‐groups.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis is the first study that applies Skog's approach to test whether changes in overall mean alcohol consumption tend to reflect collective shifts in drinking across different socioeconomic strata. Our findings suggest that Skog's notion of collectivity of drinking indeed is applicable across SEP‐groups. That is, during the period 2004 to 2014, yearly changes in overall mean consumption in Sweden are echoed in collective shifts in drinking across groups with basic, intermediate and high educational level. There were also indications that changes in overall mean consumption reflected collective shifts in the prevalence of HED across educational groups, although some groups did not quite conform to the expected pattern (men and women with basic education, and women with intermediate education). Moreover, while the magnitude of the associations for both average volume and HED differed somewhat in strength across the educational groups, they were clearly in the same, positive, direction. Our findings thus correspond to the notion of soft, rather than hard collectivity, as discussed by Holmes et al. [28].\n\nThe observed collective changes in drinking indicate that factors influencing consumption during the study period have had a similar effect across educational groups. According to Skog's theory, this could reflect an absence of strong social and cultural boundaries between educational groups in relation to drinking behaviour. However, while the study period saw gradually increased affordability of alcohol in Sweden [29, 30], no substantial alcohol policy initiative focusing on price and availability was undertaken. To further our understanding of under what circumstances the notion of collectivity of drinking applies across SEP‐groups, future studies should replicate our analyses on cases and study periods with more tangible changes in alcohol policy.\n\nMoreover, our results do not support the hypothesis that the differential association between per capita consumption and alcohol‐related mortality across educational groups in Sweden, as reported in a recent study [17], may be explained by differences in consumption trajectories. Rather, our findings of a collectivity in drinking across educational groups suggest an explanation where a mechanism assumed to underlie the alcohol harm paradox—differential vulnerability—aggregate up to the population level. Recent studies have found that the alcohol harm paradox can largely be attributed to a differential vulnerability to the harmful effects of alcohol, so the same levels and patterns of drinking are associated with a higher risk of alcohol‐related harm in lower, compared to higher SEP‐groups [31, 32, 33]. When such differential vulnerability exists, changes in exposure that occur collectively, as found in the present study, will have a larger impact on the harm rates in more vulnerable groups, which in our case tend to be the more disadvantaged parts of the population [34]. Moreover, a recent systematic review concluded that up to 30% of the social gradient in alcohol‐related morbidity and mortality may be explained by a differential exposure to hazardous patterns of drinking across SEP‐groups [25]. In line with this, our finding of a negative social gradient in prevalence of monthly HED suggests that the differential effect of per capita consumption on alcohol‐related mortality, may in part be attributed to a higher prevalence of hazardous drinking patterns in low SEP‐groups.\n\nTaken together, the results presented in this study and in Norström and Landberg [17] add a socioeconomic dimension to the evidence of a population‐level association between alcohol and related harm. That is, changes in per capita consumption tend to reflect collective shifts in drinking across SEP‐groups, which, together with differential vulnerability, may contribute to a social gradient in the association between per‐capita consumption and rates of alcohol‐related harm. These findings have important policy implications; given that changes in per capita alcohol consumption tend to have a larger impact on related harm among the more disadvantaged part of the population, policy measures that effectively regulate the total consumption of alcohol across different SEP‐groups will not only have the potential of decreasing rates of alcohol‐related harm, but may also reduce the social gradient of this outcome.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nOur analyses are based on a large nationally representative sample that has been collected monthly, using the same survey methodology, over a long period of time. This has provided us with a unique opportunity to analyse trends in drinking across SEP‐groups, minimising the risk that the results are artefacts of methodological changes. Moreover, as the recall period for the applied quantity and frequency scale only is 30 days, distorting memory effects are assumed to be smaller in our study than in studies using longer recall periods, for example, 12 months [35]. Still, some limitations of the study should be noted. The increasing non‐response rates may have affected the inclusion of heavy drinkers, which would lead to an overestimation of the temporal decrease in consumption. However, the coverage rate of the self‐reported volume of consumption, when compared to the estimated per capita alcohol consumption, has remained stable, at approximately 45% of the estimated per capita consumption [36], suggesting that this is not a significant problem in the present study. Lastly, marginalised heavy drinkers, for example, the institutionalised and the homeless, are probably over‐represented among the non‐responders, which limits the generalisability of our results."
