It will have no end in view.\n\nIt is free from unsparing endeavor.\n\nBy Harry Martinson\n\nFrom Passad, 1945\n\nTranslated by Stephen Klass\n\nPublished with the permission of Eva Martinson\n\nLi Ti’s Advice\n\nIf you own two coppers, said Li-Ti on a journey,\n\nbuy one loaf of bread and one blossom.\n\nThe bread is there to fill you\n\nThe blossom you buy is to tell you\n\nthat life is worth the living.\n\nBy Harry Martinson\n\nFrom Gräsen i Thule, 1958\n\nTranslated by Stephen Klass\n\nPublished with the permission of Eva Martinson\n\nThe electrons\n\nWith their round dance the electrons spin\n\nchrysalises of that which abides,\n\nthe inmost cocoons\n\nwhich do not open of their own accord\n\nbut are of that which abides.\n\nThere it is not a matter of hatching out.\n\nThere it is a matter of tending and protecting\n\nthe metamorphoses of the inmost\n\ndeeper-down swaying,\n\nthe innermost playing of women in dance.\n\nBy Harry Martinson\n\nFrom Dikter om ljus och mörker, 1971\n\nTranslated by Stephen Klass\n\nPublished with the permission of Eva Martinson\n\nThe inner light\n\nIn the inmost of the smallest of all spaces\n\nruns a mute and constant play of color, inaccessible to eyes.\n\nIt is the light shut in that once in the moment of creation\n\nwas born inward and abode there, going on,\n\nonce it had broken up into the smallest of spectra\n\nin keeping with prismatic law\n\nat frequencies that by the sighted would be called colors\n\nif they encountered eyes able to see.\n\nIt moved in periods\n\nunimaginably small for time and space\n\nbut still with time and space enough for the least of the small.\n\nIn fact it found it had ample room and time.\n\nIt moved in cycles of nanoseconds and microspaces\n\nfrom white light and the colors of the spectrum and back to white light.\n\nA kind of breathing for light.\n\nThe photons breathed and pulsated with one another,\n\nalternating signs and levels.\n\nSo the light kept going in spectral balance\n\nfrom dense light to split\n\nand back to dense light and split,\n\nin spectral cycles infinitely repeated.\n\nIt was like a play of fans,\n\nin keeping with the same law that holds for rainbows,\n\nbut with spread and folded fans\n\nalternating with one another\n\nin keeping with the law of light inscribed in them.\n\nIt was the light when it dances enclosed\n\nwhen it is not traveling abroad and seen.\n\nIt belongs to the nature of light\n\nthat it can be shut in\n\nand still not die out in its movement\n\nthat it preserves itself thus in the darkness\n\nas thought, intent and aptitude,\n\nthat it remembers its changes\n\nand performs its dance, its interplay.\n\nWith this art the light keeps together\n\nthe innumerable swarms of matter\n\nand sings with light’s spectral wings\n\nthe endless song in honor of the fullness of the world.\n\nBy Harry Martinson\n\nFrom Dikter om ljus och mörker, 1971\n\nTranslated by Stephen Klass\n\nPublished with the permission of Eva Martinson\n\nThe great trouble\n\nNature’s laws are already on the way\n\nto stand us all against the wall.\n\nThat wall is law’s own nature.\n\nIt is missing an evangel.\n\nThat great trouble all of us must share.\n\nThen it will be possible to bear.\n\nThe great trouble is to take great trouble.\n\nThat is what all of us must learn.\n\nAmid all shoulds and should have beens\n\nthere is one must for all.\n\nAll must learn to take great trouble with the world.\n\nNow that man has gotten power enough\n\nto bring about the trouble of the world\n\nthe time is now\n\nto heal the trouble of the world in time\n\nbefore all nature has become\n\neverybody’s troubled child.\n\nThis is called taking trouble in time.\n\nTrue trouble\n\nwhich sees in time to what it sees.\n\nBy Harry Martinson\n\nFrom Dikter om ljus och mörker, 1971\n\nTranslated by Stephen Klass and Carolyn Skantz\n\nPublished with the permission of Eva Martinson\n\nAlong the paths of echo\n\nAlong the paths of echo backwards.\n\nThere the words lie in the chest of their old meanings.\n\nBut, sad, so foreign. What is it they are saying, those lips.\n\nThey speak of different connections and conditions.\n\nAs you listen to them speaking\n\nthey form a thing that is also changed by them\n\nspell in a language even farther removed\n\nin still another of the chests\n\ninside the mount of the seven chests\n\nthousands and thousands of years before Babylon.\n\nBy Harry Martinson\n\nFrom the posthumous collection Längs ekots stigar, 1978\n\nTranslated by Stephen Klass and Carolyn Skantz\n\nPublished with the permission of Eva Martinson\n\nPoems selected by Ulf Larsson, The Nobel Museum."
