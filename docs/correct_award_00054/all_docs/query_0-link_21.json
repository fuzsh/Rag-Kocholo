        "text": "Harry Martinson was born in 1904 in Jämshög in Blekinge county and died in Stockholm in 1978. After his father’s death, he was accorded as a parish child. However, he escaped and worked as a sailor 1919-1926.\n\nHarry Martinson was awarded many different awards in his life time, including the De Nios Prize (1938), the SvD Literature Prize (1944), the\n\nBellman Prize (1951 and 1962), the Grand Prize for Literature Promotion (1955) and the 1974 Nobel Prize together with Eyvind Johnson. He became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1949 and a honorary doctor in Gothenburg 1954. He was married to the Swedish writer Moa Martinson 1929-40.\n\nHarry Martinson’s previously light life – intoxicating poetry deepened over time and he gained a large register; heartfelt pieces of nature, stinging satire of time and an astronaut’s poem that in brilliant symbols describes the situation of modern man and poetry. Tender and self-critical depictions of childhood, exotic sailor memories and natural impressions oscillate between microscopically precise attention to detail and breath-taking cosmic perspectives."
