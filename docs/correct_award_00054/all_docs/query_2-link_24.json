        "text": "Birth Name: Harry Frederick Martinson\n\nBirth Date: May 6, 1904 (Died: February 11, 1978)\n\nBirth Place: Jämshög, Sweden\n\nHarry Martinson (1904-1978) was a Swedish author, poet, and translator.\n\nHe was born in Jämshög, a small village in southern Sweden, and grew up in poverty.\n\nMartinson was orphaned at a young age and spent much of his childhood living with foster families.\n\nAs a young man, he worked as a sailor and traveled extensively.\n\nIn the 1930s, Martinson fell on hard times and began living homeless as a vagabond on country roads, eventually arrested for vagrancy.\n\nThese experiences had a profound impact on Martinson and his work, and he often wrote about themes of isolation, poverty, and the human condition.\n\nDespite his difficult circumstances, Martinson was a prolific and highly regarded writer.\n\nHe published numerous collections of poetry, as well as several novels and plays. In 1956, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature for his “writing that through its union of poetic depth and breadth of insight gives life to the contemporary history of the human spirit.”\n\nMartinson continued to write and publish until his death in 1978.\n\nReferences"
