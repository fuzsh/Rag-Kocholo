        "text": "Harry Martinson (May 6, 1904 – February 11, 1978) was a Swedish sailor, author and poet. In 1949 he was elected into the Swedish Academy. He was awarded a joint Nobel Prize in Literature in 1974, \"for writings that catch the dewdrop and reflect the cosmos.\", together with fellow Swede Eyvind Johnson. The choice was very controversial, as both Martinson and Johnson were members of the academy and had partaken in endorsing themselves as laureates.\n\nHe has been called \"the great reformer of 20th century Swedish poetry, the most original of the writers called 'proletarian'.\"\n\nDetailed Biography: http://authorscalendar.info/harrymar.htm"
