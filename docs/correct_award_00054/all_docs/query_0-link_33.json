        "text": "Template:Refimprove\n\nHarry Martinson (May 6, 1904 – February 11, 1978) was a Swedish sailor, author and poet. In 1949 he was elected into the Swedish Academy. He was awarded a joint Nobel Prize in Literature in 1974 together with fellow Swede Eyvind Johnson. The choice for Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson was very controversial as both were on the Nobel panel. They and Graham Greene, Saul Bellow and Vladimir Nabokov were the favored candidates that year.\n\nLife[]\n\nMartinson was born in Jämshög, Blekinge County in south-eastern Sweden. At a young age he lost both his parents whereafter he was placed as a foster child (Kommunalbarn) in the Swedish countryside. At the age of sixteen Martinson ran away and signed onto a ship to spend the next years sailing around the world visiting countries such as Brazil and India.\n\nA few years later lung problems forced him to set ashore in Sweden where he travelled around without a steady employment, at times living as a vagabond on country roads. In the city of Malmö, at the age of 21, he was arrested for vagrancy.\n\nIn 1929, he debuted as a poet. Together with Artur Lundkvist, Gustav Sandgren, Erik Asklund and Josef Kjellgren he authored the anthology Fem unga (Five Youths), which introduced Swedish Modernism. His poetry combined an acute eye for, and love of nature, with a deeply-felt humanism. His popular success as a novelist came with the semi-autobiographical Nässlorna blomma (The Nettles Flower) in 1935, about hardships encountered by a young boy in the countryside. It has since been translated into more than thirty languages.\n\nOne of his most famous works is the poetic cycle Aniara, which is a story of the space craft Aniara that during a journey through space loses its course and subsequently floats on without destination. The book was published in (1956) and became in 1959 an opera composed by Karl-Birger Blomdahl. The cycle has been described as an epic story of man's fragility and folly.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1940 he was married to the Swedish writer Moa Martinson. The sensitive Harry found criticism in the 1970s after the Nobel prize hard to cope with, and attempted suicide[1] with a pair of scissors. He died of February 11, 1978, at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm.\n\nThe 100th anniversary of Martinson's birth was celebrated around Sweden in 2004.\n\nBibliography[]\n\nTitles in English where known.\n\nNovels[]\n\nNässlorna blomma (Flowering Nettles) 1935\n\nVägen ut (The Way Out) 1936\n\nDen förlorade jaguaren (The Lost Jaguar) 1941\n\nVägen till Klockrike (The Road) 1948\n\nEssays[]\n\nResor utan mål (Aimless Journeys) 1932\n\nSvärmare och harkrank 1937\n\nMidsommardalen (Midsommer valley) 1938\n\nDet enkla och det svåra (The easy and the hard) 1938\n\nVerklighet till döds (Reality to death) 1940\n\nUtsikt från en grästuva (Views From A Tuft of Grass) 1963\n\nPoems[]\n\nSpökskepp 1929\n\nNomad 1931\n\nPassad (Trade Wind) 1945\n\nCikada 1953\n\nAniara 1956\n\nGräsen i Thule 1958\n\nVagnen 1960\n\nDikter om ljus och mörker 1971\n\nTuvor 1973\n\nRadio plays[]\n\nGringo\n\nSalvation 1947\n\nLotsen från Moluckas 1948\n\nStage play[]\n\nTre knivar från Wei 1964\n\nPsalms[]\n\nDe blomster som i marken bor\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nHarry Martinson\n\nA translators look at Flowering Nettles Swedish book review\n\nHarry Martinson's Photo & Gravesite\n\nPreceded by\n\nElin Wägner Swedish Academy,\n\nSeat No.15\n\n1949-1978 Succeeded by\n\nKerstin Ekman\n\nTemplate:Nobel Prize in Literature Laureates 1951-1975\n\nPersondata Name Martinson, Harry Alternative names Short description Date of birth May 6, 1904 Place of birth Jämshög, Sweden Date of death February 11, 1978 Place of death Stockholm, Sweden\n\nThis page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia.
