Bartlett\n\nCompany Will Replace Map Image Man Says Shows the\n\nBody of His Slain 14-Year-Old Son\n\nZoom in to the furthest down square on the map\n\nand there he is: white shirt, white sneaks, tan pants.\n\nHe lies near a curved track. Four boxcars wait\n\nto the east, on the straight track his was set to meet.\n\nTo the south, warehouses and empty lots.\n\nNorth and west: wasteland and more trains.\n\nBetween the tracks, three men in brown and\n\nkhaki wait. As far as they can get from it.\n\nAnother walks to a dusty cop car\n\naway from the body, which looks\n\nsmall and flat and casts no shadow.\n\nThe legs are poker straight, splayed,\n\nthe waist is tilted slightly. You could swear\n\nthere's no head, but hope it's the angle.\n\nAfter all, what can be seen from space?\n\nNot blood surely nor wounds, only this:\n\nA place one might want to know about.\n\nAnd so this day, this hour, this second, a satellite passing,\n\nmerely making a map, clicking a camera, and capturing\n\na dead boy near tracks, and four long shadows.\n\nRebekah E.

Black, sporty prescription sunglasses, left on a Metro train\n\n2. My favorite wool sweater, in some cabin in West Virginia\n\n3. A dying Fitbit, in a hotel room in Seattle\n\n4. My innocence, not technically lost, but stolen\n\n5. My first love, lost to the physical manifestations of my deepest wound\n\n6. At least two wallets in the backseats of cabs, before the days of Uber\n\n7. Mint green prescription sunglasses, in a wave off Maui (you idiot!)\n\n8. Countless phone chargers, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere\n\n9. A matryoshka doll set from my great-grandmother, in a move\n\n10. Ownership of my body & the ability to discover it for myself\n\n11. An elm tree, consumed in an August wildfire\n\n12. A ragdoll cat named Lincoln, taken far too soon as a kitten\n\n13. My brother, the monster of my childhood, who pulled me onto the gray basement floor\n\n14. A bumper sticker that read, The fact that no one understands you doesn’t mean you’re an artist\n\n15. The sense that I knew what would come next, gone like snow one March morning\n\n16. My parents, though still living, distant as Europa\n\n17. A whole chapbook full of poems, discarded but not forgotten\n\n18. My wedding band, in a resort pool, found by an 8-year-old in goggles\n\n19. My desire to be the perfect son, gone forever\n\n20.

They don’t know a hymn\n\nto sing into them for their unwanted children, and the wagon’s\n\nwheels are broken beneath the wooden box, there is no escape.\n\nI was in an artificial room with women when the governor signed\n\nthe document in a real room with men. There were six women\n\ntoo, I don’t want to look up their names. There were smiles and poses.\n\nThere were claims of widespread support. In the artificial room\n\na woman described a woman’s bitter jokes as “playful.”\n\nIt meant she wanted her to stay safe. We were blowing soap bubbles\n\nlike accordions, like applause, like the rough skin on our elbows\n\nwe try to salve away. I don’t know if the other women had heard\n\nthe news because it wasn’t safe to speak of it. Those meetings\n\nmight be recorded. What do we think about socks? What do we think\n\nabout suicidal fathers? What do we think about where we go next?\n\nAlready I have heard myself whirring as if I screamed into fan blades.\n\nI sound like an ostrich, I sound like a dove, I sound like a dead canary.\n\nThe woman who says “playful” when she means “cruel” is pregnant,\n\nso she might be safe, and I am old, so I might be safe, and I might be\n\nlying because we don’t know what safety is or we would’ve named it\n\nand fought for it. There isn’t even a sign on a dirt road. There isn’t even\n\nthe thinnest of pamphlets, a folded sheet of lined paper. There isn’t\n\na code scrawled on skin with a ballpoint pen. There is no ink\n\nand there are no ears, just heads shaped like bullets or basketballs.\n\nWhen I say I am beside myself, I see the unmistakable shape of me\n\nnext to me, holding on. We are thinking about how we got here,\n\nto this artificial room in this real country where we do not belong,\n\nthe medical procedures, the professionalism, the joy of starting over.\n\nWe are afraid to say any words that get too close to the fact of lives\n\nwe thought we had. When I ask about dark humor, I get startled looks.\n\nThis isn’t funny, this is the last day, all the answers have dried up\n\nunder the rocks, and we are the rocks. I want to pack my bags,\n\nbut when I open the closet door, they’re already gone, like an odor\n\nand I am suddenly one of the damaged ones, whose brain lost its bulbs\n\nfor sensing, and it’s legal now for me to speak of nothing, only\n\na particular nothing, there long ago when I didn’t want it to be.\n\nLisa Lewis has published eight collections of poetry, most recently Taxonomy of the Missing (The WordWorks, 2018) and a chapbook titled The Borrowing Days (Emrys Press, 2021). Recent work appears or is forthcoming in New Letters, Florida Review, Isele, Posit, Interim, Diode, Agni Online, and elsewhere.

(1961-2021)\n\nAll night a rising where rest and dark should be,\n\nthe star is in my throat emitting a wakefulness,\n\nthe grit of Lenten ash across my body.\n\nIn my shadow hands, the ones I bend toward in dream\n\nI hold the thin pages of your letters that surface\n\nyour libertarian rants, your greetings, the love\n\nin the cursive of your teenage fingers. Later\n\nour friendship, I’ll call it love, was locked into long FaceBook messages.\n\nThey are there and I can read them if I want,\n\neach comment to a post of mine like a sweet wink,\n\na laughter. You were right not to recognize\n\nhow crazy I was for you at 17, as you knew so well\n\nyou could not return it. But in your death now\n\nyou’ve taken that girl who could not have been who she was\n\nwithout knowing you. It’s a weird component of death―\n\nthe little death it creates in the living, the pieces\n\nmissing or misplaced. You were one person, I think,\n\nwho liked to imagine me sitting here, writing.\n\nJulia Lisella’s most recent collection, Our Lively Kingdom, (Bordighera Press 2022), was named a finalist for the Lauria/Frasca poetry prize.

I took the drop ceiling down,\n\npartially-, I tore most of the rug from the kitchen floor. I didn’t want\n\nto move the gas stove or fridge, although I took all the pictures from\n\nit’s perfect white face, and the magnets of the states I drove through\n\nmostly sober mad grin on the highway just the semi’s and I, owl night.\n\nAnd of course the alphabet letters that spelled out only “why” in\n\nmismatched colors, those are gone. There’s a lone black magnet in the\n\ncenter of the sly surface saying what I know I’m thinking, waiting for,\n\nI find it upstairs in a dozen books. It ought to be a law, it ought to be the\n\ndeclaration of our independence. It says the barns burned down now I\n\ncan see the moon. And I saw the moon before. I mean I really saw it,\n\nwhen I looked, which was seldom. Not never, but hardly at all. I painted\n\nall the hallways blue, and not a blue that would have been a compromise,\n\na blue that makes me think of Mayans, and the virgin Mary, for all three\n\ncoats of paint I used the smallest brush that I could find that I could use to\n\nmake it mine. I moved the everything that used to be a place and now that\n\nplace is somewhere else. The hardwood floors are all the same. The closets\n\ndidn’t want to give up, so I let them be, but then I tricked them into folded\n\nshapes which made them want to play and now they’re all away. At first\n\nI wondered where you were. I wondered but I didn’t ask the dust that\n\ncovered all the steps that led down to the street.\n\nTim Moder is a member of Lake Superior Writers and The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.

Moore ​\n\n​Mother Worry\n\n“An infernal angel passed in flight\n\njust now along the avenue\n\nin a crush of thugs....”\n\n—Eugenio Montale, “The Hitler Spring”\n\nCan I exercise-exorcise\n\nmother worry, father doubt\n\nwalking the April park?\n\nA mile away, I-64’s\n\nnever exhausted tires\n\nwhish, thud, whish, bearing goods―\n\nrakes, carburetors, doll-\n\nbabies―and whole\n\nfamilies driving, still able\n\nto wish themselves elsewhere.\n\nThugs shot songbirds in the woods\n\nlast week, and torches\n\nmarched not long ago―\n\npitch, spit and tar-hiss,\n\nboot thump, the winged\n\nmaple seeds―samara, they’re called―\n\ncrunched like bird bone\n\nunderfoot. The men carried\n\nthe confederacy’s skewed\n\nred-white-blue\n\nand Hitler’s four-winged\n\ngod symbol.\n\n​We’re thugless today.\n\nThe air is bearing a crowd\n\n​of pollen, of futures.\n\nEnlarged in photos,\n\nthey’re spheres, ovoids,\n\nporous and spiky,\n\nsome like miniature\n\nland mines. They’ll explode\n\ninto what I don’t know:\n\nmy daughter’s bouts of lupus,\n\nmy ornery heart tripped up,\n\ntorch-light’s jump dance.\n\nDon’t worry, be happy,\n\nsays a dead man in my head.\n\nThere’s dogwood, the crucify-tree\n\nin the legend, blossoming.\n\nTouch the buds, and they nod,\n\nclutches of green buckshot\n\ncentered in the blood-stained\n\nsepals, as if flourish\n\nwere all, or kill. Wary\n\naims forward too,\n\ndarker than wish. Portent\n\nflowers everywhere. Aware\n\nis its mother, thud its bad god.\n\nMary B.

I have dodged the nights that urge me\n\nnot to leave with my life. I am the son of a son and a daughter. I am\n\nawash in some desire of novice appeal. I have noted the solid craft of\n\nmy windshield wipers. Retribution snakes around me like a forgone\n\ndisease. There is a knot of apricots fraying in my skull. I know that I\n\nam neither normal nor extraordinary. I live on the contrary side of town.\n\nI have smoothed out my body under bossa nova sunlight. I have wandered\n\ndown soggy paper trails in the rain. I believe that every border should be\n\nreplaced by a big sloppy kiss. My chopped hair is shaped into a monument.\n\nI have aired human sacrifice on television. I have wound a procession of\n\nrope around willing lovers. I have viewed the profile of my body through\n\nthe eyes of a satellite self. I have signed my own petition to consider a\n\nnew set of primary colors. Spontaneity cannot be overstated, but nothing\n\nis really momentous anymore. My heart is a hidden beach in central\n\nArkansas. I have ripped away the perforated part of my soul.\n\ncitizen_permutation.bee_morris.pdfFile Size: 45 kbFile Type: pdf\n\nDownload File\n\nBee Morris is the author of Alive on Planet Earth, released as part of Ghost City Press's 2021 Summer Series.

I learned how to swallow in the nick of time. I had a lump of alcoholism stuck in my throat. Literacy was a big red dog tied to a fence, a stack of medical records taller than the tomato plants in my backyard, and the fear of pregnancy followed me into the locker room. I never swore in front of my parents, but I did cook ketamine on baking sheets that were passed down to my mother from her mother and from her mother. From her mother. Moral judgement is missing an ear. It needs a mouth, but that’s missing, too.\n\nThe subtext of memory has very few words and no hands. When I unload the dishwasher every morning, I use both hands. I also use both hands with my wife. Two hands to water the plants, to drive my car, to deposit money in the bank. I think in terms of tricks and bingo rituals and VHS tapes and the absence of power and books I never read and the kitchen sink and cooking fresh from the garden and what it means to face danger with confidence and how to cut baby heads of cauliflower at the neck and boil them whole. On beautiful days in September, outside my bedroom window, dozens of blow-up clowns deflate in the middle of the street. This is how I’d describe 5th grade, which is when I learned how to read and pull my pants down in school.\n\nMy earliest memory of reading is the same as my earliest memory of lying. The first time I cut my own hair and rebalanced my father’s checkbook and jumped off the curb of every street corner in town and shaved with shaving cream and imitated a rotisserie chicken and held my breath the longest without blinking. It’s easy to remember what it was like to be ten when I had a crush on Mary Tyler Moore and my 5th grade gym teacher and my softball coach and Becky and Mary and the science teacher, Ms. P, and the girl who sat in front of me in English, and when she’d stand to say the pledge of allegiance, use her fingertips to pick her underpants then place her palm on her chest. I wanted to get inside books that deleted women and wave my hands above my head to get her attention.\n\nThe refrigerator door in my childhood kitchen didn’t close all the way and the phone cord curled around my torso, tied my hands behind my back and my feet to—My mother, who was always cooking a chicken. I remember. My grandmother’s red lipstick. She drank herself to death. I sucked a dozen beer cans in the back seat of a 1989 Chrysler. We had a picnic in the graveyard. It was a beautiful day. Clouds dappled with pink and orange light. And the breeze just right. And the ragweed in bloom.\n\nI think I think we both have to die, I think. The problem with this sentence is the thinking. And the timing is terribly off. I haven’t even mentioned you. You, my brother. You, shame. You, washing dishes. You, the birds in my backyard. You, the worm. the tomato. the suffering. Your square head and missing teeth are connected to my guilt bone. My guilt bone is connected to my courage bone and tailbone and hip and ribs and shoulder and jaw. And this is my voice stuck in my cheekbone and my nerve. And my whole face is pink fruit fermenting on the stem about to fall.\n\nNicole Santalucia is the author of The Book of Dirt (NYQ Books), Spoiled Meat (Headmistress Press), and Because I Did Not Die (Bordighera Press).

The other groans.\n\nHe’s coming here? She grabs a bear claw, bags it,\n\ngrabs another. No, not here, the first one says,\n\nthrough gritted teeth. But I can’t let him in my house.\n\nHe can just lay his head down somewhere else.\n\nThe other cashier rings me up. You have a brother?\n\nNo, not anymore, I tell her. Good, she says.\n\nTheir talk continues as I leave.\n\nTyler Robert Sheldon’s six poetry collections include When to Ask for Rain (Spartan Press, 2021), a Birdy Poetry Prize Finalist.

She, who\n\npeppered the house with Post-It notes,\n\nwas losing her memory, but she cued\n\nhim from the passenger seat\n\nwhen the light changed.\n\nUntil\n\nwe haggled for months, he asked\n\nher to drive, his impatient keys\n\ncradled in a glass bowl.\n\nUntil\n\nthe day in the driveway when she\n\nfroze―mascaraed eyes focused\n\non the strangeness of dials and tiny letters.\n\nShe whispered, I don’t remember\n\nhow to start the car. He told me\n\nover the phone, It’s all right,\n\nshe doesn’t go very far.\n\nThat night I dreamt of my young lover\n\nwho kept driving her red truck\n\nafter brain surgery,\n\nuntil\n\na seizure\n\npropelled the truck into a yellow crosswalk.\n\nShe killed a man in a blue shirt, and\n\nher dog’s back legs were paralyzed.\n\nFrom 300 miles away I drove\n\nto ask their doctor to file a report,\n\navert a tragedy. No luck.\n\nUntil\n\nI buried my mother’s keys in my bag.\n\nAt home I imagined\n\nhow she would scour each room\n\nuntil\n\nshe forgot what she was looking for.\n\nGail Thomas’ books are Odd Mercy, Waving Back, No Simple Wilderness, and Finding the Bear.
