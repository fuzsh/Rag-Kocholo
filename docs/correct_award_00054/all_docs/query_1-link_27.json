        "text": "That should be the headline. Tomas Tranströmer, an 80-year-old “surrealist” or “mystical” poet from Stockholm, became the fourth Swedish writer to be recognized by the Swedish Academy with the Nobel Prize in literature. He was the first Swede to be honored since the novelists Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, two writers on every reader’s shelves, shared the prize in 1974. (The German-Jewish poet Nelly Sachs, who split the 1966 prize with Israeli novelist Sh. Y. Agnon, was living in Sweden at the time.)\n\nMore Swedish writers have now taken home the award than Italian (three), Spanish (three), Polish (two), Greek (two), Australian (one), or Indian (none), Canadian (none), or Dutch writers (none). Who knew that Sweden was a world power in literature? Tranströmer became the first poet in a decade and a half to win the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe poets say that he is something of a transnational figure. In a review of Tranströmer’s New Collected Poems published in the Guardian early this summer, Paul Batchelor calls him a “non-English-language poet who has been fully accepted into British and US poetry in his own lifetime.” In an essay on him at the Academy of American Poets’ website, Tom Sleigh says the reception of Tranströmer’s poetry in this country “is now part of American literary history.” Both of them mention that Tranströmer is associated with Robert Bly’s “Deep Image” movement. (For those of you keeping score at home, Bly’s “deep image” is not exactly the same as Jerome Rothenberg or Clayton Eshleman’s “deep image,” but is no less fuzzy in conceptual content.)\n\nBly explains helpfully that the “deep image” is a “geographical location in the psyche,” but the critic Kevin Bushnell seems to be on firmer ground in saying that it is “the first attempt in American poetry to incorporate fully the theories of Freud, Jung and other depth psychologists into the poet’s expression.” Tranströmer, a trained and practicing psychologist, would be attracted to such a conception for obvious reasons.\n\nTranströmer’s poems are serene and unfazed, even when describing the “terror” of an automobile accident as in “Alone” (translation by Robin Fulton):\n\nI\n\nOne evening in February I came near to dying here.\n\nThe car skidded sideways on the ice, out\n\non the wrong side of the road. The approaching cars—\n\ntheir lights—closed in.\n\nMy name, my girls, my job\n\nbroke free and were left silently behind\n\nfurther and further away. I was anonymous\n\nlike a boy in a playground surrounded by enemies.\n\nThe approaching traffic had huge lights.\n\nThey shone on me while I pulled at the wheel\n\nin a transparent terror that floated like egg white.\n\nThe seconds grew—there was space in them—\n\nthey grew as big as hospital buildings.\n\nYou could almost pause\n\nand breathe out for a while\n\nbefore being crushed.\n\nThen something caught: a helping grain of sand\n\nor a wonderful gust of wind. The car broke free\n\nand scuttled smartly right over the road.\n\nA post shot up and cracked—a sharp clang—it\n\nflew away in the darkness.\n\nThen—stillness. I sat back in my seat-belt\n\nand saw someone coming through the whirling snow\n\nto see what had become of me.\n\nII\n\nI have been walking for a long time\n\non the frozen Östergötland fields.\n\nI have not seen a single person.\n\nIn other parts of the world\n\nthere are people who are born, live and die\n\nin a perpetual crowd.\n\nTo be always visible—to live\n\nin a swarm of eyes—\n\na special expression must develop.\n\nFace coated with clay.\n\nThe murmuring rises and falls\n\nwhile they divide up among themselves\n\nthe sky, the shadows, the sand grains.\n\nI must be alone\n\nten minutes in the morning\n\nand ten minutes in the evening.\n\n—Without a programme.\n\nEveryone is queuing at everyone’s door.\n\nMany.\n\nOne.\n\n“Antitheses such as isolation and society are brought together, generating a powerful field of force,” Batchelor says in his Guardian review, commenting on this poem. “The poem offers no explanation for its abrupt change of scene, and we soon learn that a Tranströmer poem can change with the speed of a dream.”\n\nWhat else do we learn? Batchelor does not say, and I have no idea. Perhaps, as he implies, the learning is contained wholly within the poem, like a bird in a cage. Even when Tranströmer addresses an outside world, he is not likely to refer to it with any distinguishing exactness. Here is a poem called “November in the Former DDR,” although we never learn why the location is specified (translation, again, by Fulton):\n\nThe almighty cyclop’s-eye clouded over\n\nand the grass shook itself in the coal dust.\n\nBeaten black and blue by the night’s dreams\n\nwe board the train\n\nthat stops at every station\n\nand lays eggs.\n\nAlmost silent.\n\nThe clang of the church bells’ buckets\n\nfetching water.\n\nAnd someone’s inexorable cough\n\nscolding everything and everyone.\n\nA stone idol moves its lips:\n\nit’s the city.\n\nRuled by iron-hard misunderstandings\n\namong kiosk attendants butchers\n\nmetal-workers naval officers\n\niron-hard misunderstandings, academics!\n\nHow sore my eyes are!\n\nThey’ve been reading by the faint glimmer of the glow-worm lamps.\n\nNovember offers caramels of granite.\n\nUnpredictable!\n\nLike world history\n\nlaughing at the wrong place.\n\nBut we hear the clang\n\nof the church bells’ buckets fetching water\n\nevery Wednesday\n\n—is it Wednesday?—\n\nso much for our Sundays!\n\nIron-hard misunderstandings, poets! How far we have drifted from a time when poetry was an art of reflection, measuring thought in exact units. Tranströmer’s award may explain why no poet has won the Nobel Prize in 15 years, and why the Swedish Academy, in an age in which poets no longer perform any public function, was at a loss when it came time to pick the greatest poet now writing, and settled for one of its own."
