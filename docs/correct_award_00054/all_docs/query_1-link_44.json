        "text": "Our History\n\nThe name, ANIARA, is derived from the poem, Aniara - penned by the Nobel Prize winning author, Harry Martinson. The poem tells the tale of the spaceship, \"Aniara.\" The spaceship and its select crew are launched into space, away from Earth, which has been doomed by a nuclear war. The mission: to explore space and discover a new planet on which a better society can be created. Like this adventuresome crew and its ship, ANIARA was launched on a journey to medical exploration and discovery, leaving other providers far behind."
