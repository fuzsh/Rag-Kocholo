Bellman Prize (1951 and 1962), the Grand Prize for Literature Promotion (1955) and the 1974 Nobel Prize together with Eyvind Johnson. He became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1949 and a honorary doctor in Gothenburg 1954. He was married to the Swedish writer Moa Martinson 1929-40.

Harry Martinson’s previously light life – intoxicating poetry deepened over time and he gained a large register; heartfelt pieces of nature, stinging satire of time and an astronaut’s poem that in brilliant symbols describes the situation of modern man and poetry. Tender and self-critical depictions of childhood, exotic sailor memories and natural impressions oscillate between microscopically precise attention to detail and breath-taking cosmic perspectives.
