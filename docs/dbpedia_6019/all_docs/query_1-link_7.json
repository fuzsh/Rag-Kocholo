        "text": "In “Zookeeper,” residents of Boston’s Franklin Zoo break their vows of silence in order to help their beloved caretaker find love.\n\nThese bickering bears, the grouchy lion couple, the smart-aleck monkey, the hip-hopping rhyming giraffe, among others, hope that if Griffin is happy, he’ll stick around.\n\nHusky comic actor Kevin James portrays the zookeeper who believes his job is getting in the way of a lasting relationship.\n\nIn its opening moments, “Zookeeper” reveals how Griffin arrived at such a boneheaded notion: The mild-mannered zookeeper goes impressively romantic on a beach with his girlfriend, only to be shot down by the fashion-forward Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Evidently, he can’t be a keeper if he’s just a zookeeper.\n\nbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\nIt’s her problem, of course. But as much as he loves his job, he makes her doubts about his prospects his own when he sees Stephanie five years later at his brother’s engagement party. She’s interested. But has she changed her mind about changing him? What do you think?\n\nLuminous and game for a comedic stretch, Rosario Dawson plays Kate. She’s a veterinarian visiting the zoo to introduce two eagles to cohabitation.\n\nWill Griffin change Stephanie? Will Stephanie ruin Griffin? Can the beast lighten his burdens? And what about Kate?\n\nThere is little in this PG comedy that — nods to Sebastian the Wolf — any sharp-nosed moviegoer won’t smell coming from miles away. But that doesn’t get in the way of its pleasures.\n\nDid we mention that things just go better with Kevin James?\n\nWell-trodden comedy hooks become strangely more amusing. Goofball physical shtick elicits broader smiles. The bumblingly stupid is made endearing. (I remain fond of the lamebrained but innocent “Paul Blart: Mall Cop.”) When Griffin takes flight at his brother’s wedding (don’t ask), he looks blissed, though a crash is inevitable.\n\nAmusingly sturdy support comes by way of the voice cast of the creatures.\n\nWhat would a Kevin James movie be without Adam Sandler (and vice versa)? He gives hilarious voice to Donald, a wiry, wisecracking capuchin monkey who’s all about thumbs.\n\nAnd “Zookeeper” makes the casting of Cher and Sylvester Stallone as a couple seem long overdue. Sly plays Joe the lion. Cher is Janet, the power behind this pride of two.\n\nNick Nolte provides the grim if hopeful observations of Bernie, an exiled gorilla.\n\nNot all the zoo workers, it seems, are animal lovers. Bernie’s had a run-in with one. Donnie Wahlberg portrays Shane as just a shade shy of being too cruel for the audience’s youngest.\n\nAll the animals in the film are played by actual animals except Bernie, which the movie uses to amusing affect.\n\n“Zookeeper” swings on the notion of a kind of reverse anthropomorphizing, with the animals projecting their habits and experiences onto Griffin.\n\nMark your territory with style, the wolf schools him. “Lead with your pudding cup,” the bears advise. It’s a phrase worthy of a Prince ly ric and pretty much as naughty as things get in this PG tale.\n\nAmong the biped performers, comedian Kim Jeong is alternately deadpan and slithering toward sleaze as Venom, the zoo’s reptile expert.\n\nIt’s time to caution the talented Jeong about the pitfalls of doing one riff too well. (He had similarly unhinged moments in the “Transformers” sequel and in “The Hangover Part II.”)\n\nWe laughed a lot. We teared a couple of times. Mostly — and it’s becoming a habit — we just appreciated the blundering wonder that is Kevin George Knipfing, a.k.a. Kevin James.\n\nFilm critic Lisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567 or lkennedy@denverpost.com; also on blogs.denverpost.com/madmoviegoer\n\n“ZOOKEEPER.”\n\nPG. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
