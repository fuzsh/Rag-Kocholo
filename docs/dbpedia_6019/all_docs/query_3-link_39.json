        "text": "‘Madagascar’, is a 2005 computer-animated comedy film produced by Dreamworks animation, which tells the story of four Central Park Zoo animals who attempt to escape from the Zoo and when caught, are mistakenly shipped back to Africa, getting shipwrecked on the island of Madagascar.\n\n(Image source: brandchannel.com)\n\nThe film starts out at Central Park Zoo, located at 64th and 5th Avenue New York, where the animals have spent most of their lives in blissful captivity. Central Park Zoo is a small 6.5-acre zoo which was built in 1894, and showcases animals from tropical, temperate, and polar zones around the world (Madagascar Wiki, 2010).\n\nUpon visiting the Central Park Zoo, one of the first things that stood out to me was that although the film is an animated depiction of the zoo, there are a vast amount of similarities in terms of the layout of the zoo, the clock tower entrance, and various other sculptures that are positioned around the zoo. A solid example of this is the clock tower entrance to the zoo that is also displayed in the film – the animated version shows a very similar representation of it, with only a few minor details having been adjusted.\n\n(Image source: filmapia.com)\n\n(Image source: deviantart.net)\n\nHowever, although there are a number of similarities between the animated depiction of the zoo and the real zoo itself – I couldn’t help but notice one distinct difference. The main characters that are featured in the film consist of a lion, a hippopotamus, a giraffe, and a zebra all becoming involved in various crazy antics. However, none of these particular animals are actually featured in the real life zoo.\n\nRegardless of this, upon visiting the gift store on my way out, I noticed that a large majority of the stuffed animal toys that were available for purchase consisted of both lions and giraffes – two animals that were featured in the film, however are not displayed in the real life zoo itself.\n\nAs well as this, the animated zoo is represented as a popular, large, and well known tourist attraction that makes up a significant part of New York. However, upon visiting the real life zoo, I noticed not only that it was incredibly small, but there seemed to only be a small crowd of people that were visiting, nor did many people realise that a zoo inside Central Park actually existed. It is extremely hidden away, with only around 6 – 7 animal exhibits in total.\n\n(Image source: onthesetofnewyork.com)\n\nAt the beginning the film where the opening scene is taking place in Central Park Zoo, it is obvious to the audience that although Central Park Zoo is host to a number of various animals from around the world, its most popular attraction is Alex the lion, who had been rescued as a cub from being adrift in a crate at sea. This is in contrast to that of the real life Central Park Zoo, where currently, the main attraction lies in the sea lion pool that is located in the center courtyard. According to the Central Park Zoo website, the new design ‘features glass sides so that viewers can watch these sleek carnivorous mammals gliding and spiraling under water’. This differs to the film in terms of the center courtyard instead displaying Alex the lion’s giant lion pen, where he is on display as the main attraction in the center of the zoo.\n\n(Image source: http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net)\n\nIn conclusion, the primary similarities between the animated zoo that is depicted throughout the film against the real life version, mostly come down to only the zoo layout. In terms of the size of the zoo, popularity of the zoo and the animals that are featured, there are stark contrasts between them.\n\nWorks cited:\n\n‘Central Park Zoo official website’ (2011), webpage, accessed 12/1/15 http://www.centralparknyc.org"
