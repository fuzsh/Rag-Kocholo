        "text": "ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) â€” The Detroit Zoo has a part to play in a movie screening Monday at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York.\n\nThe zoo in Royal Oak serves as a backdrop for several scenes in the Jenna Fischer romantic comedy \"The Giant Mechanical Man.\"\n\nAlthough the scenes are set at the fictitious Fillmore Park Zoo, it's not hard to make out such Detroit Zoo staples as the Arctic Ring of Life and Rackham Fountain.\n\nIn addition to Fischer, \"The Giant Mechanical Man\" features Chris Messina, Malin Akerman and Topher Grace.\n\nThe Detroit Zoo scenes featuring the movie's lead characters were shot in December 2010.\n\nDetroit Zoo Executive Director Ron Kagan says \"it should be very exciting to see the zoo on the silver screen.\""
