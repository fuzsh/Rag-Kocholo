        "text": "Hello, Spongey here.\n\nhttps://letterboxd.com/spongey444/film/a-cinderella-story-if-the-shoe-fits/\n\n(I was supposed to have a little thing explaining why we’re doing this instead of what I teased but I forgot and also I explained it here anyway)\n\nWe’ve talked about some lackluster movies so far this year, but nothing too bad. That is, until today. I might have …overcorrected a tad though.\n\nYou all remember A Frozen Christmas, right? I don’t want to but I do. It seemed like just another ripoff movie but ended up being the worst movie I ever reviewed. If you need a refresher, that’s the “movie” that was just a bunch of badly read stories over a screensaver, with random stolen CGI assets.\n\nThat movie was directed by Evan Tramel and brought to us by Wownow Entertainment. They’d made tons of movies on that level of quality, but they have made some that actually do count as movies.\n\nIn the sense that they have stories where events happen, at least. I knew there’d be no point in watching any of the “A Frozen X” stuff, so I decided to see how those actual movies fared.\n\nI watched two, the other being Star Paws. I was unsure which one to go with but I chose to do this. Oh, Star Paws is more mockable due to its weird mix of horrifying CGI that barely moves and real dogs that can talk without moving their mouths.\n\nBut it seemed to at least be trying to go for stylistic suck in some points. For some reason it reminded me of those Thumb movies, but even less amusing. This movie however, has no excuse for being as bad as it is, so I went with it.\n\nI watched this for the first time in a stream with friends. They’re actually part of the same group chat that introduced me to A Frozen Christmas. I swear we don’t hate each other. It was certainly more fun to go through hell with friends…but it’s still hell.\n\nThis is indeed better than A Frozen Christmas but only because it can almost call itself a movie. That’s about it for positives. For some reason, this is on Amazon Prime so if you have it, you can peek at this and see it for yourself.\n\nAlso, this came out in 2018 and was indeed that movie I was referring to. Get ready for Show Dogs to look like Old Yeller! Let’s just get into it.\n\nThis, is Zoo Wars\n\nThe movie starts with a text crawl explaining that two opposing sides are looking to find the most powerful thing in the universe: The power of the sauce. The good guy side is called “The Nice side”.\n\nWe just started, people. The villains are called the Mice Side, by the way. Well, really that side is just full of mice and is only evil because their leader is. The leader is named Boo Boo Squeal. We haven’t even seen a single frame of animation and I’m about ready to tap out.\n\nWe join Boo Boo as he’s telling his incompetent henchmen what he’s doing, because the text crawl wasn’t enough explanation. Boo Boo has an annoying voice that is very pleasant to listen to.\n\n“Now go get me some guacamole. I must replenish my sauce power!”\n\nThis movie doesn’t deserve that amazing sentence.\n\nAfter a boastful speech, we get a title sequence that really should have come before the text crawl. We meet our hero, Nuke, an elephant with a boring desk job who will in no way be a chosen one. He longs for a life of adventure, which he surely won’t get. I’d complain more but this level of cliche shows an understanding of narrative I wasn’t ready to see in this thing.\n\nSuddenly, Nuke gets a call inside his head from someone with an annoying voice that sounds like Patrick Star with a really bad cold. He tells him that he has a destiny he can fulfill by pressing enter on his keyboard.\n\nAfter some stupid back and forth and a bathroom joke, he pushes enter and ends up on a spaceship called The Sparkle Express. These names, I swear. It’s even owned by Princess Sparklefeather. The Princess has been kidnapped and they need help to rescue her from the clutches of Boo Boo. There’s also a robot named B-52 and just incase that joke was too subtle for you, Nuke explains it to you.\n\nThe voice introduces himself as Bongo Bananas and helps them make it through a meteor shower. They make it through but then they make me wish they didn’t.\n\n“Don’t you follow social media? Twitter? Snapchat?”\n\nOf course they have that in…the…future? Sci-Fi past? I don’t know where this is even set.\n\nThey meet up with our Han Solo in the form of a rebel squirrel named Squeezy Whistle. I think now is a good time to talk about the animation: It’s bad, but in a weird way.\n\nThe models don’t look too bad at first glance, but then you see them in “action”. And by that I mean they barely move and mostly just stand there and talk. That is if they can even move their mouths, which they often can’t. It’s not as flat out glitch-y and ugly as Trollland but as a result is way less fun to make fun of, and looks super low quality. This most certainly had no budget but even Video Brenquedo put more effort into the quality than this.\n\nYou read me. That animation is still terrible but this is worse. But anyway, Boo Boo gets into an extremely long conversation with his lackey about stupid things that isn’t funny and we get back to the heroes.\n\nSuddenly, they are attacked by a bounty hunter named Coot Coot. Okay, I know these names are supposed to be silly but it’s not even funny anymore. It’s almost cute to see this movie attempt an intense action scene though.\n\nBoo Boo boards Sparklefeathers ship and tries to get her to say where the chosen one is by reading her mind and mentioning a bunch of sauces. This is the life I chose.\n\nThe heroes escape the peril and go back to rambling, this time about how Squeezy and Sparklefeathers used to be a thing. This goes nowhere. And they call the robot U2 and Sum 41 because every kid is going to get those jokes.\n\nBut anyway, they stumble upon the princess’ ship.\n\n“She’s a princess, not your kind”\n\nDang, that’s racist.\n\nBoo Boo has captured the princess now and she sends a message telling them to find the leader of the Nice Side so that they can find the chosen one. Because it hasn’t hit them yet that Nuke is the chosen one. By the way, the robot doesn’t question how Nuke got on the ship but seems to be the one who brought him there? I don’t get it.\n\nThe guy they are looking for is Bongo Bananas, the guy who talked to Nuke earlier. They keep talking and I’m bored so here’s an out of context line:\n\n“My pistachios are rock hard”\n\nSqueezy tells them he knows someone who can help them, named Jabber the Jaw. Because why not at this point. They head out when a moose randomly approaches their ship to stall the plot even further.\n\nThey blow him up and move on so that was pointless. They arrive at Jabber’s place which is full of what sounds like crappy dubstep. Jabber tells them that Bongo is alive but is in hiding until the return of the chosen one.\n\nAlso, the subtitles flat out call him Jabba in this scene, even Amazon knows how dumb this is. Otherwise, the scene is more talking that goes on forever but at least plot is being progressed.\n\nNuke tries to contact Bongo but he just ends up staring blankly for a bit, which is a little funny. There, there’s one unironically positive thing I can say and really it’s mostly funny for how awkward it is. Bongo eventually speaks up but he only says Nuke must “remember”.\n\nWell, that was helpful. Now we’re stuck with these guys rambling for ages again. And after a quick scene with the villain, they’re still rambling when we get back. As you can tell, this movie doesn’t use its time very well.\n\nNuke finally remembers what he is supposed to remember: Bechamel. I have no idea what that is but saying it teleports them to Bongo Bananas. Bongo explains that he faked his own death long ago so he wouldn’t have to do with this dumb war and had hoped a chosen one would come along to help bring peace.\n\nI love how they try to make this talking scene more interesting by just spinning the camera a lot, to the point where it gets really annoying.\n\nHe goes on to say that he once trained someone who turned out to be a traitor. They assume he’s talking about Boo Boo, because even they know how cliche that would be. But…\n\n“I’m talking about you, Nuke!”\n\n…What.\n\nApparently he was the heir to the Nice Side throne and after he randomly became an evil jerk, Bongo erased his memory Thankfully, no hint of his later evil-ness remained at all and I guess he’s now considered trustworthy enough to be a good guy.\n\nAlso, Boo Boo had indeed been an in training Nice Side warrior but the others didn’t accept him because he was a tiny mouse and of course he turned evil as well. So much for subverting expectations.\n\nOh and Sparklefeathers is actually Nuke’s sister. And he showed slight interest in her earlier. Gross. Anyway, I do like this random idea of the hero having been a villain before, it’s the closest this gets to a deeper story.\n\nBut it’s just randomly thrown in there and isn’t explaindc that well. I mean, you were going to just try again with this guy even after seeing how he could get corrupt? Maybe try someone you didn’t have to mindwipe?\n\nAnd it’s a good thing no one ever recognized him given how important he was. Seriously, this is like if Luke had Anakain’s backstory but even that would likely be handled way better than this.\n\nBut to be fair, it turns out Nuke isn’t The Chosen One. Nah, the Chosen One is actually is a flea that lives in Nuke’s earlobe.\n\nI’m not making that up. The main reason Fillipo couldn’t do much before was because of all the earwax up there. What even is this movie now. We don’t even see the flea because that would be too hard to animate I guess.\n\nWhatever, I don’t care. They head out and finally start their final battle with Boo, with the help of a flea. Fillipo somehow gets over to Boo Boo’s ship to annoy him a lot with his tiny scratching.\n\n“Tickle tickle tickle!”\n\nI hope Episode 9 ends exactly like this.\n\nEventually Boo Boo gives up and the day is saved. Clearly that was the most epic climax ever. With that, we cut to later as both sides agree to a truce. Then Squeezy and Sparklefeathers get married despite barely interacting.\n\n“Make no mistake foolish warriors, The Zoo Wars are not over!”\n\nYeah, there’s a sequel for some reason. The subtitle is…Into the Zoo Wars. Oh fuck off with that title. The end, thank Christ. I’m not even surprised by the abrupt ending, I’m just glad its over.\n\nAlso, the scrolling credits are reaaaly slow for some reason.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nWell, that sucked. Honestly, I was less angry watching it this time since I already knew what was ahead of me, but it was still quite terrible. It comes dangerously close to being a movie at least, but not quite.\n\nThere’s at least one thing that provides us with an okay idea, as that weird twist is almost a bit clever and subversive. If this were produced like a real movie, it would work. But as it is, it’s just weird and random.\n\nThat’s still better than the rest, which is super boring. Above all this, this was super tedious to sit through. Every single scene goes on forever, because they didn’t have the time or budget to actually have things happen.\n\nI get restrictive budgets, but even Trollland had their characters move! Nothing ever moves the way it’s supposed to, but I went over the animation already. This thing is only an hour but it feels so much longer because no one will shut up. Yet my summary makes it seem shorter!\n\nThe actual story is just a discount version of Star Wars, there nothing really happens. It’s supposed to be a parody but pretty much all the jokes either bomb, or barely exist. That twist is the closest it gets to real parody but it’s too little too late.\n\nThe characters are either annoying or barely do anything and tend to ramble a lot. Honestly, I’m not sure what to say because this movie barely has anything going on. It has a plot yet it still feels empty!\n\nIt at least feels like a poor attempt at a movie this time, but it’s a failed attempt. So much of this drags and barely anything really happens. It just feels like a big time waster to make kids watch. Pretty much all of this companies movies are like that though, so I shouldn’t be surprised.\n\nI have less ire at stuff like this an A Frozen Christmas since at least this feels like they tried to make a money. How hard they tried is up for debate. That’s not a hard bar to clear.\n\nPlenty of movies make me angrier but this still one pretty bottom of the barrel stuff. One amusing moment and an interesting twist isn’t enough to save it. I don’t quite think it warrants anger like I expected going into this review but it’s still pretty terrible.\n\nRating: Bad\n\nI don’t plan to do anymore movies from these people, as they tend to fail for the same reasons. Also, I want the worst movies I reviewed each year to be at least be somewhat of a surprise, ya know?\n\nI don’t know what next time is, we’ll see what happens. I will say that my next two blog posts will also be quite negative, and I apologize in advance for that. I didn’t notice until I looked at the schedule. I promise August will be less negative.\n\nSee ya."
