        "text": "Published July 7, 2011 by PETA Staff. Last Updated October 14, 2013.\n\n< 1 min read\n\nPETA members converged on the Hollywood premiere of the new movie Zookeeper to remember Tweet, a giraffe who collapsed and died on set during the movie’s production.\n\nAn elephant used in the film may also have been abused. Animal Defenders International took video footage of elephants as they were beaten and shocked by trainers at Have Trunk Will Travel, the company that provided the elephant for the movie.\n\nMoviegoers may be surprised to learn that the presence of American Humane Association (AHA) representatives on a movie set is no guarantee that animals were not exploited, hurt, or even killed during production. AHA representatives only monitor what occurs during filming, not what happens during off-set training sessions, where abuse is most likely to occur.\n\nPlease don’t reward the producers of Zookeeper—which, incidentally, is receiving scathing reviews—for exploiting animals. Don’t buy a ticket."
