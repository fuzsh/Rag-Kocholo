        "text": "This is a brilliant film. I want you to understand that it is a brilliant film before I explain in a significant degree of detail how disturbing it is. Wait, don’t leave! Stay here- HEAR ME OUT. It’s a feminist war film about a woman who co-runs a zoo in Warsaw, Poland with her husband, but when World War Two comes along they decide to use the zoo to hide Jewish people. And- bonus- it all happened in real life*!\n\nIs it a feminist film? Yes! The main character- Antonina Zabinski (just looked up her name on google; this is one of those films where you get to the end and don’t know the names of any of the characters)- is an awesome character because, apart from anything else, she never makes any of those stupid decisions you see women making in films and just want to caption with a thousand question marks. Not only is she determined to help people and risks her life to do so, she- absolute clincher for me- is obsessed with animals. At first, I was like, “What! She loves animals, but she runs a zoo where they live in cages!” But by the end, when the words ‘they rebuilt the zoo’ came up, my face was covered in a huge grin. I had been sedated by all the rabbits, skunks, pigs, and that bit where she gives a baby elephant CPR. Antonina looks after literally dozens of people, hundreds in real life, only two of whom don’t make it. The most notable of the people she saves is a girl called Urszula, who’s been abused by Nazi soldiers, and who won’t talk when they rescue her. Antonina knows what to do: she gives her a rabbit and some colouring pencils, with which to draw on the walls and expose them all to the Nazis (sorry, that was inappropriately flippant. That part of the film is actually very sweet, and suffice to say that when the war is over Urszula comes to live with them, so it’s a happy ending after all.)\n\nIs it disturbing? Yes, very. I don’t want to put you off this film- it’s empowering and beautiful- but I am now going to list, carefully, all the potentially upsetting things in this film you should be aware of. There are: multiple shootings of animals, images of burnt animal carcasses, bombings, things being burnt down, an off-screen r*pe of a young girl, an on-screen attempted r*pe**, multiple shootings and killings, and emotional moments like when someone thinks her son has been shot. On the upside, even though they run a pig farm, no pigs are killed! Yay!\n\nAnd… does it pass the Bechdel test? Yes it does (aargh, why will my blog still not accept the word ‘Bechdel’ after more than fifty reviews?)\n\n*I very much doubt it actually all happened in real life. If you watch it you’ll see what I mean.\n\n**I am really angry that in one review I read, the reviewer described this scene as, instead of what it obviously is- A VIOLENT ATTEMPTED R*PE- a ‘sexually charged’ scene where ‘one (character) interprets the situation very differently than the other.’ The scene is then later referenced as ‘A man throws a woman on a bed and seems set on assaulting her but doesn’t.’ Funny- I’d call what happened an assault.\n\nAnd, on a lighter note: The picture I used here is small because it had a foul and repellent Nazi on the right hand side of it so I used that lovely thing called ‘snipping tool’ to cut him out of it. Ha."
