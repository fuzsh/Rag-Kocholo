        "text": "The story of Dartmoor Zoo might be a familiar one, but there's always something new happening. Though the film We Bought A Zoo, starring Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson, came out over a decade ago, Zoo CEO Benjamin Mee says its still capturing new audiences.\n\nWhen Benjamin moved into the 13 bedroom, 30 acre property with his family in 2005, he explained the house \"just so happened to have lions, tigers, bears, wolves, and flamingos in the garden\". Despite thinking it was \"insane\", the family took a look at the then-failing zoo, only to get swept away by the animals and their rocky future.\n\n\"We were silly enough to come and look at it, to rule it out,\" Benjamin said. \"And, of course, we got caught up in the whole drama that, if it was going to close, which it looked like it was, most of the animals would be destroyed. So we pulled out all the stops and went through lengthy negotiations for about six months and managed to buy the zoo as a broken closed zoo without a license.\"\n\nRead more: Dartmoor Zoo CEO's heartbreaking story of love, loss and cancer\n\n\"Miraculously, we got it back on its feet within about eight months and opened to the public - and then the real rollercoaster started to begin of actually keeping it going amid recessions and rain. There was a lot of unseasonable rain for many years, which meant that the summers were washouts.\"\n\nAfter managing to get the place up and running, Benjamin - who was a journalist before becoming a zoo CEO - wrote a book about the trials and tribulations of running a zoo, and the tragic loss of his wife, Katherine, just after the family moved in.\n\nIn 2011, We Bought a Zoo came to screens for the first time, putting Dartmoor Zoo - or Rosemoor Zoo as it's known in the film - on a global stage. It was a two-year process before Benjamin and his two children, Milo and Ella, got to sit down at the premiere and see their lives on the big screen, thinking \"what did they do to my story?\"\n\n\"Actually, they made a fairly sympathetic - a very sympathetic film. About 50 per cent of it you could relate to as factual. Then, you know, there's a lot of drama and it's a much shortened story. But it was extremely surreal to see it with my kids, and see Matt Damon on the screen.\"\n\n\"The first jarring moment... he picked up the phone and says 'Benjamin Mee' - woah, why's he saying that, that's weird?! And there were certain little vignettes from the film that were based on real events but then a lot of drama. They played my son as a grumpy teenager, but he was actually six when we bought the place, and very much in favour of the whole thing.\"\n\nBenjamin adds that it was also \"nerve-wracking\" to see their story for the first time. Despite having read through the script beforehand, changes are common before films are finally finished, and Benjamin was worried about \"serious blunders\".\n\n\"There were some things, some animal related things in the film that I wish they'd talked to me about. There's a bit where Dylan, who plays my son Milo, kicks a snake and it's like 'oh dear, you shouldn't do that'. This kind of thing just does not happen and could not happen.\n\n\"But once the overall impact of the film was evident - that it was a good, positive message - even though it was factually a bit inaccurate, it was then just a question of answering lots of questions, the same questions, again and again in hotel rooms all across the world hoping it brought people to the zoo.\n\n\"We didn't get a lot of money from the film but we did get a lot of attention and that was the main motivation for doing it.\"\n\nWhile some of the moments in the film were pure Hollywood fiction - such as a huge tree falling down and blocking the zoo entrance on opening day - other moments were based on reality. While the film shows a bear escaping from the zoo and managing to make it to a Home Depot car park, Benjamin said it was actually a jaguar that got out to have a scuffle with a tiger.\n\nBenjamin explained: \"A very junior, untrained person who wasn't really supposed to be there, but we hadn't quite gotten around to figuring out who was doing what, made an error and let the jaguar out, down this path that we're standing on. He came out of the door, ran down the path and, luckily, jumped across the moat to this tiger enclosure to fight the tigers he'd had his eye on for eight years.\n\n\"When he got close up to the tigers, he figured out just how big they were and he slowed right down. To his credit, he carried on with his mission there was as scuffle but, amazingly, no animal or human was injured in the whole process, and we did get him back safely.\"\n\nHe added the experience was \"hugely formative\" for him at the time - knowing they didn't know how to run a zoo and having to learn on the job, they saw first hand the very real risk to people and animal's lives.\n\nMore than 10 years after the film initially aired, it is still regularly watched by people across the world, and it still shown on TV, including this weekend on Channel 4 at 13:25 on Sunday, January 8. In the interim, Dartmoor Zoo became a charity, allowing them to accept more donations from kind-hearted visitors, and save money in other areas. As the film clearly points out, it is very expensive to run a zoo.\n\nBenjamin said: \"It used to be £1,000 a day, and it's more like three or four thousand a day to do it properly, to comply with all the regulations and give the staff a decent wage, give the animals the right care and enclosures the right security.\"\n\nWhile locals have loved and been a part of Dartmoor Zoo's journey from even before Benjamin was involved, re-showings bring it to new audiences, which brings in more funding, which goes directly back into the animals who live there, as well as further conservation efforts. This year, Benjamin says they are focusing their efforts on finishing the enclosure for the Amur Leopards the zoo is hoping to acquire.\n\nAmur Leopards are one of the rarest species on the planet, with only around 90 left in the wild, and Dartmoor Zoo is working towards a breeding program which could see their numbers increase in the future. The zoo is currently fundraising to finish building the enclosure, which recently had a platform added by Hands On, who run work programs for companies.\n\nDespite it being the off season for the zoo, they are currently open Fridays - Mondays from 10am, and will be running a number of offers throughout the year to make visiting even easier and more affordable during the cost of living crisis. Through January, the zoo are running Members Month - any Dartmoor Zoo member can bring up to four guests in for 50 per cent off.\n\nFor Valentine's Day, the zoo will once again be running 'Name A Cockroach After An Ex', as well as two for one tickets, and later in the year, mums will be going free on Mother's Day, while Dads go free on Father's Day.\n\nWe Bought A Zoo will be airing on Channel Four on Sunday, January 8 at 1.25pm.\n\nClick here to subscribe to the South West TV Talk newsletter, bringing you the latest showbiz news, gossip and features from across the West Country every week.\n\nRead next:\n\nStranger Things star Noah Schnapp comes out as gay in TikTok video\n\nNeil Gaiman play brings EastEnders star Charlie Brookes to Theatre Royal Plymouth in 2023\n\nThe Apprentice has returned and viewers already hate Sir Alan Sugar's candidates\n\nBBC's That's My Jam: Jason Derulo and Becky Hill star in next episode on Saturday"
