        "text": "Looking for a new show to binge? You're in luck, Taylor Sheridan's highly anticipated Paramount+ series 'Tulsa King' places Sylvester Stallone in his dream mob role with a unique setting — Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nBringing another taste of Hollywood to T-Town, Sylvester Stallone stars as Dwight “The General” Manfredi, a New York mafia capo that was just released from prison after serving a 25-year stint behind bars. After being exiled by his former boss, he has to set down roots in a place that’s completely different than he’s used to — and with some unlikely characters.\n\nWill he be able to find his way in this fictionalised version of Tulsa and build an empire with a new crew? That’s the excitement to come with 'Tulsa King.'"
