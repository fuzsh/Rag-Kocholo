        "text": "Would you have done what Antonina Zabinski did?\n\nShe is the title character in “The Zookeeper’s Wife,” the true story of a woman played by Jessica Chastain who sheltered Jews and resistance fighters in the Warsaw Zoo right under the Nazis’ noses during World War II.\n\n“That’s the big question of the film: What would you do if something like this happened today?” says Chastain about the film, which opens Friday.\n\n“So many of us would immediately jump to, ‘Of course, I would help others.’ But to do that is to trivialize the danger. Antonina sacrificed the safety of her children to be compassionate. She opened her doors to strangers.”\n\nThe film by Niki Caro is from Diane Ackerman’s book, which is based on the diary of Antonina Zabinski, who, along with her husband, Jan Zabinski (played by Johan Heldenbergh), had been running the zoo before the war.\n\nThe Zabinskis had until then led a fairly idyllic life caring for their son and the animals. When the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, they ruthlessly bombed the city of Warsaw, including the zoo. Some of the animals roamed the city until they were shot down.\n\nA Nazi zoologist, Lutz Heck (Daniel Bruhl), took the best of the surviving creatures for his selective-breeding program, but the Zabinskis persuaded the Germans to use the zoo as a pig farm to provide food for Nazi soldiers. Secretly, though, they began to hide Jews and even smuggled them out of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nAs the war went on, much of the burden for hiding refugees and members of the Polish underground fell to Antonina after Jan joined the resistance and was captured in the Warsaw uprising of 1944.\n\nAfter the war, the state of Israel honored the Zabinskis for their efforts.\n\nTo prepare for the film, Chastain talked with the couples’ daughter, Teresa, who was born during the war.\n\n“She told me things that weren’t even in the book about Antonina,” says the actress, who also visited Auschwitz “because though I had studied concentration camps, I wanted to know what it meant to be on the ground.”\n\nChastain notes there are many films about World War II and the Holocaust, but most are from a male perspective.\n\n“We’ve had many films that focus on the darkness and the violence and murder, but we’ve never had a film that focuses on the light and the goodness in people during the time of war — and the feminine and the compassionate.”\n\nThe actress credits Caro for that. The director was first approached about the project some seven years ago. So getting “The Zookeeper’s Wife” to the screen was a slog.\n\n“I was really inspired by the Zabinskis,” says the New Zealand director. “They did the right thing for no other reason than it was the right thing to do. That level of humanity and decency really spoke to me. Then there was Antonina herself, so soft and so strong. She showed me that I could make a new kind of Holocaust movie that was profoundly feminine and could honor her experience.”\n\nChastain describes Antonina, whose parents were killed by Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution and had an affinity for animals, as a typical housewife of the time.\n\n“She was shy and deferential to her husband, but eventually she was responsible for caring for all these individuals and making life-or-death decisions.”\n\nWhat was extraordinary was that the Zabinskis were doing all this while surrounded by German troops. Some refugees were hidden in animal cages, others in the basement of the villa at the zoo.\n\nWhen a Nazi soldier approached, Antonina would play one piece on the piano. When the danger was gone, she would play another.\n\n“She was an ordinary housewife and an extraordinary heroine,” says Ackerman. “I think as people we think of heroes as not being afraid, but they are and they act anyway. She is an example of the difference one person can make.”\n\nThe author says Antonina “felt intricately woven in the fabric of nature. She wasn’t just adopting and nurturing endangered animals but was adopting and nurturing endangered people.”\n\nCaro adds that Antonina’s instincts for caring about animals extended to humans when the war came. “Her instinct to protect the vulnerable was deep.”\n\nAll the animals used in “The Zookeeper’s Wife” are real, which can create some unpredictability on the set but was something that Chastain enjoyed. “Everyone says never work with an animal or child, but I’m the opposite of that. For me, working with an animal or child is a great exercise in being in the moment.”\n\nCaro calls the actress “a genuine animal whisperer. She had this crazy, otherworldly connection with the creatures that made it very organic and authentic.”\n\nChastain says she loves “listening to people and what they can teach me. Being with an animal, though, you really have to be open to what might happen.”\n\nChastain, too, worked with animal handlers. “That was really helpful, because I wanted to make sure that when I was on a set with an animal that they were cared for and protected and they were never distressed. I wanted to understand what these animal whisperers do.”\n\nThese are busy times for the actress. Chastain recently finished “Molly’s Game” for Aaron Sorkin, a film about a woman who ran a real-life high-stakes poker game that became a target of the FBI. She has also completed “Woman Walks Ahead” for Susanna White, a movie about an 1890s-era woman who travels out West to paint Sitting Bull’s portrait only to get involved in the Lakota people’s fight for land rights.\n\nAhead is “George and Tammy.” in which she plays country legend Tammy Wynette opposite Josh Brolin as George Jones.\n\nAs to why she takes on roles of strong women, Chastain says she thinks every woman is a strong woman.\n\n“It’s just that I’m taking roles that are fully dimensional characters,” she says. “I think in the past women were written as objects and often were there to serve the male protagonists in a story. So they weren’t fully realized as human beings.\n\n“Even characters like Maya in ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ or Celia from ‘The Help’ may seem very different — one is very loving and generous and one is very brittle and revengeful and closed — but both are strong women. Both defied expectations of what they should be doing in society. I just think that the parts are getting better and more fully dimensional.”\n\nChastain says the question of what she would do in Antonina’s place stuck with her throughout the making of “The Zookeeper’s Wife.”\n\n“We knew we were making an historical drama, but that it was also so contemporary because so much is going on in the world now,’ she says. “It’s not just about asking yourself what would you do then but asking yourself what am I doing now?”"
