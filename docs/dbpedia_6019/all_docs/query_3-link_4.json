However, shortly after purchasing their new pet, Marley, they soon realize that they got a little more than they had planned.‘The World's Worst Dog’ due to the fact that he’s a big troublemaker. According to page 24, “He cleared coffe tables, scattered magazines, knocked photos off shelves, and sent glasses flying.” This behavior shows how destructive Marley is throughout the story. He also has a taste for chewing on carpets and couch legs, and he enjoys pulling toilet paper all around the house. Even as Marley grows old, he continues to stay energetic. Ever since he was a puppy,\n\nThe book I chose to read is called Finding Zoe: A Deaf Woman’s Story of Identity, Love, and Adoption by Brandi Rarus and Gail Harris. Brandi lost her hearing at the age of 6 due to spinal meningitis. Her mother wanted her to continue to be oral, so she was mainstreamed. As she got older, she began to realize that something was missing in her life, but she couldn’t figure it out what it was.\n\nGram also changes internally because of sal's story. Sal teaches her grandma about phoebe, a rather paranoid girl. Where they become BEST friends. Sal makes a lot of friends. This teaches gram about how nice and friendly gram is. Later in the story, she becomes nicer and nicer. gram said that after only one spurt of Old Faithful we can go. That right there takes tremendous amounts of sacrifice. Like phoebe was talking about. Another change was her memory. She and gramps most likely forgot about Gloria, a kid similar to phoebe, but back in there time. Grams has a lot of change internally by listening to those\n\nIn summary, the film The Zookeeper’s Wife takes place in 1939 in Warsaw, Poland. It tells the accounts of how Antonina Zabinski and her husband Dr. Jan Zabinski went from saving the life of one close friend to courageously working to save the lives of as many Jews as possible. On September 1, 1939, the Nazi’s invaded Poland causing extreme damage to the country and their people. The Warsaw Zoo, a prominent animal attraction, was damaged as used as a military post for Nazi Soldiers. Antonina and Jan Zabinski devised a plan to convert the Zoo into a pig farm for Nazi soldiers, only so they could carefully smuggle Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to safety.\n\n“I had a very difficult childhood I was surrounded by people who had both parents, which made me feel different because I had to do all the work myself in order to succeed.” In the stories, Behind the Beautiful Forevers and Rabbit- Proof Fence the authors used different techniques and good strategies.Katherine Boo did a better job at explaining the challenges faced by the characters by using good dialogue, descriptions and details\n\nPretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful are two films both written by John Hughes and directed by Howard Deutch. They depict themes similar to that of The Breakfast Club. Central themes such as class and popularity along with secondary themes of angst, love, self-discovery, fitting in, and the need to connect with others are prevalent throughout both of these films. Pretty in Pink is a prime example for the depiction of class and popularity. Its strong main characters, Andie and Blane, contrast in both of these categories and they develop into deeper story lines as the movie progresses. Class is a strong theme throughout the entire film and is presented in unforgettable scenes. Everyone is nervous walking into their first big high school house party, but the look on Andies face as her and Blane walk through the door is unforgettable. Clearly someone of a different social status, Andie, a true fashion icon, dresses how she desires but sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the upper-class teens. No one can forget the iconic line, “Nice pearls. This isn’t a dinner party, honey”, uttered at Andie in this scene. The clear and evident vulnerability of Andie shows just how uncomfortable she is in this setting along with the guiltiness of Blane for having brought her there. Class divides their two worlds and creates conflict throughout the film. A secondary theme that is very popular and might be controversial in the ending is love. Notable with John Hughes films are\n\nLilo’s ordinary world is in Hawaii and stitch’s ordinary world is that he was made as experiment 626 13:16. Lilo and Stitch is a Disney which was aimed for kids but the author used Campbell's technique to give a better understanding of the story not only for kids. This justifies that hero's are not always followed by very godly-like leaders. The proof of Lilo and stitch being created based on the mono myths helped show that the Hero's journey is ambiguous. The odyssey was an overall heroic theme with a splash of patriarchy added to show the dominance of men. The mono myths helped create an entertaining plot of a heroic kind of story. The hero journey throughout the novel as Odysseus undergoes many obstacles and learns great\n\nA stereotypical teenager consists of always being moody, defiant, and never listening to a word their parents have to say. Dylan Mee was a stereotypical teenager. In the movie, We Bought a Zoo, Dylan Mee is a fourteen-year-old boy who has recently gone through a tremendous tragedy; the loss of his mother. With this loss, comes anger and sadness and with his hormones, comes defiance and irrational decisions. After becoming expelled from school, his father, Benjamin Mee believed that the best thing to do was to move out of the city; so, they did, to a property that contained a zoo. These changes have an enormous impact on Dylan’s psychosocial and cognitive development while in his adolescent stage.\n\n“ As I am now, I am no wife for you”(Ibsen 887) This statement is from Henrik Ibsen’s play, A Doll House, is a play based in 1879, and it sets the tone of the remainder of the story. Ibsen seems to be making a statement that women need to mature and be independent before they have a family of their own. All of the women in this play leave their loved ones behind to gain their independence. Ibsen’s statement and character portrayal helps make Ibsen’s play take on feminist characteristics. Ibsen’s play shows that women must mature and be independent before they are ready to have a family. This is exemplified through Nora, minor characters such as Krogstad’s wife and the Nurse, and Christine. With this being one of the major themes"
