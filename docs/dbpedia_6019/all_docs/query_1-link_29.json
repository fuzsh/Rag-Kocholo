        "text": "Zookeeper with Kevin James plays 5:30 p.m. Friday to Sunday at Bear Tooth Theatrepub. Here's a review from The Christian Science Monitor to give an idea of what you're getting yourself into:\n\nThe great film director John Huston was once asked what he would wish for if he had only one wish. He replied that he'd like to get together with all the animals he had ever known and loved in his life and have a conversation with them.\n\nIf Huston were alive today and saw \"Zookeeper,\" he might have second thoughts. He might also, to his credit, walk out on this numbingly inane comedy. I, dear reader, had to stick it out.\n\nKevin James plays Griffin, a Boston zookeeper jilted by his golden girl fianc√©e, who discovers that the animals in his care are capable of talking to him. What they say, however, is so unfunny and uninspired that you kind of wish they would just shut up. This goes double for the humans. How is it possible that a movie with five credited screenwriters can have such a nothing script?\n\nAs long as we're on the subject of animals, I think there should be a subdivision of the ASPCA -- American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Audiences.\n\nGrade: D (Rated PG for some rude and suggestive humor, and language.)\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Christian Science Monitor and is republished here with permission."
