        "text": "The City Zoo is a private non-profitable, volunteer and professional service organization, started in 1905 when “Samantha Fresaer donated a hedgehog to the city park” when it was run by the City itself, until the year 1982 the ownership has been transferred to the Zoological Society. Ever since the City Zoological Society took over the leadership the local economy increased and the zoo made almost 8% in local economy for each tax dollar it\n\nPeople think that animals want to be in zoos, but they really do not. In some zoos the owners or zookeepers see how the environment is making the animals feel bad or good and they try to change it by giving the animals a similar habitat to where they came from. All three stories “The Stripes Will Survive”, “The Zoos Go Wild”, and “Our Beautiful Macaws and Why They Need Enrichment” deal with protecting animals but they all do so in different ways.\n\nIn summary, the film The Zookeeper’s Wife takes place in 1939 in Warsaw, Poland. It tells the accounts of how Antonina Zabinski and her husband Dr. Jan Zabinski went from saving the life of one close friend to courageously working to save the lives of as many Jews as possible. On September 1, 1939, the Nazi’s invaded Poland causing extreme damage to the country and their people. The Warsaw Zoo, a prominent animal attraction, was damaged as used as a military post for Nazi Soldiers. Antonina and Jan Zabinski devised a plan to convert the Zoo into a pig farm for Nazi soldiers, only so they could carefully smuggle Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to safety.\n\nThe Zoo Of Death is very ironic in various ways and various reasons. The Zoo of Death is not the kind of zoo where you would want to go with your family and spend a fun day. . The Zoo of Death was made for Prince Humperdinck in the book “The Princess Bride”. The prince loved to hunt. More than anything in the whole world, he loved to hunt. The Zoo of Death was made to keep animals underground so Prince Humperdinck could hunt them and then watch them suffer as they died. The ironic thing is, they were kept in best shape. Most people would think that they would be in best shape so they wouldn't look sick to all the people. But Prince Humperdinck wanted them to be in best shape so he could have a challenge while he killed them. Normally the\n\nOne of the most fun, visually amazing functions to visit are zoo's. Growing up as a kid going to the zoo was so much fun and basically guaranteed a great day out. People have been complaining and questioning the role of zoo's for a long time now. Some claim that it actually kills the animals off faster. Others claim that zoo's actually help protect and preserve the lives of these animals. Only one can make a reasonable argument by studying sources, and finding out statistics. Based off of the articles, \"The Stripes Will Survive\", \"The Zoos Go Wild\", and \"Our Beautiful Macaws and Why They Need Enrichment\", we can truly get in-depth analysis about the role zoo's play.\n\nAs is written in the article, “He says zoos play a major role in educating people about animals and promoting wildlife conservation.” Ultimately, what the person is trying to clarify is how zoos play a vital role in our associations to conserve flora and fauna. Conjointly, without zoos, people will waste the wildlife and continue to pollute the earth. Without zoos, animal life would cease to exist. You may go against the grain and consider that zoos must be banned for the fact that they are very deadly to the environment. Nevertheless, I still hold my conviction that zoos are a must. At length, zoos persuade the public to conserve the\n\nLily Atkins 4/18/2018 Lit 2000 Professor Farmen Analysis Of: What Is The Zoo For What In “What Is The Zoo For What,” Patricia Lockwood paints a portrait of nature. Nature is violent and free; it embodies a sense of chaos and unruliness that society has tried to control through the invention of captivity. Inventions of captivity can be described as zoos, but is also anything that holds another thing; like a fountain holding water, a song containing sound. Many forms of captivity are described while words are redefined to point out the very abstract invention of captivity, which is language.\n\nAs the animal rights movement has developed and grown substantially in recent years, there has been an increased focused on the welfare of captive animals. A popular institution that has received much attention for keeping animals captive is the zoo. Because of this focus, zoos have responded by publicizing their positive benefits for existence in order to justify keeping these animals on display. Since the term “zoo” can have a wide variety of meaning and characteristics, it is important to define what constitutes a zoo in this essay. Zoos are defined as a facility in which animals are confined within enclosures, displayed to the public, and\n\nIn the article “Zoos Are Cruel and Unnecessary,” Earth Times posed a question, “With the internet, as well as DVDs, 3D TV, etc., are zoos really necessary to teach people about animals in the 21st century?” In the response given by Liz Tyson, director of the Captive Animals’ Protection Society, she argues an animal and its environment in a zoo is “out of context” and there is no substitution for an animal’s natural habitat. Therefore, viewing animals in such environments distorts the message that a zoo’s primary purpose is to conserve these habitats in the wild. By focusing solely on the artificial habitats, Tyson fails to mention the educational opportunities that zoos and zoological parks can provide, such as interactive visitor programs, breeding and rehabilitation programs, and up-close animal encounters.\n\nZoos present a certain blend of nature and culture. They have always provided a way to bring natural wildlife and urban Americans together as a means of entertainment. Yet, throughout the years the role of zoos have changed. Though once used for amusement, zoos are now being used for education on preservation and the welfare of endangered species. One may wonder where and how the idea of zoos started and just how they, and the environment around them, have changed throughout history.\n\nThis reveals that The Zoo of Death is made for darker purposes than any ordinary zoo. The Zoo of Death is very ironic compared to any other zoo. An ordinary zoo is created for the fun of seeing the variety of all the different animals. It is also created to care for the animals that may be becoming extinct. The Zoo of Death was made for fun, but it was the fun of killing the animals."
