        "text": "NEW YORK — Kevin James doesn't buy the cynical old caution attributed to W.C. Fields, “Never work with children or animals.”\n\nIn his new film, “Zookeeper,” the former star of TV's long-running “The King of Queens” and regular-guy sidekick to bigger stars in movies such as “Hitch,” “I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry” and “The Dilemma” continues his transformation to top-line star status in a comedy that has him literally talking to the animals, “Doctor Dolittle”-style.\n\nThis movie follows James' last headlining role in “Paul Blart: Mall Cop,” casting him again as a chubby, likable schmo who loves his work but can't get any respect (except from the animals he cares for so diligently). He plays zookeeper Griffin Keyes, whose frivolous on-and-off girlfriend (Leslie Bibb) wants him to leave the zoo and find a more glamorous, lucrative career.\n\nSo, in an effort to retain their beloved keeper, the nervous zoo animals — led by a regal lion and a surly gorilla — elect to break their long-held code of silence, reveal to Griffin that they can talk and tutor him on earthy wildlife rules of courtship.\n\nJames, talking about the movie at a news conference hosted by Columbia Pictures in the sky-high Mandarin Oriental Hotel, within sight of the Central Park Zoo, allowed that animals can teach humans a thing or two about wooing the opposite sex.\n\n“Animals act on complete instinct, and in some ways it works and it's a lot better,” he said “Maybe we need to go back to that and just act on our instincts. But some of those behaviors can go a little bit off — like marking your territory or throwing poop.\n\n“But it was just a fun world to be in,” James said. “Because animals don't play games; they don't pretend to be something they're not. They just go out and do it, and that's it. They might get killed or eaten or whatever, but whatever happens just happens, and it's completely natural. And that's the way I'm going to live from now on.”\n\nReal and imagined\n\nThe menagerie of animals starring opposite James — lions, bears, giraffes, elephants, wolves and a very mischievous capuchin monkey — was composed of real zoo animals, with the exception of a hulking, startlingly realistic animatronic gorilla named Bernie (voiced with sentimental gruffness by Nick Nolte).\n\nJames, who had a number of up-close buddy scenes with the gorilla, said he was astounded by how believable the giant mechanical animal was.\n\n“We had two guys who wore the gorilla suit,” James said. “And they were great. Comedically, they were awesome to act with. The movements and the face of that gorilla, it's so insane what they can do with it. Literally, I saw more real emotion from them than some human actors I've worked with.”\n\nDirector Frank Coraci said much of the creative technology that went into building Bernie was cutting edge.\n\n“We just wanted to have a gorilla that looked real since all the other animals in the movie were real,” the director said. “And we brought in this company, ADI. We looked at all the gorillas that had been built for prior movies, and we wanted to have control of Bernie's personality and how he looked, and so we decided to create a new gorilla for our movie with the latest technology and servomotors and stuff. But it was fun because we got to create a personality for Bernie from scratch.”\n\nGood sports\n\nCoraci also gave high marks to James for being a good sport in getting up close with his wild-and-woolly co-stars.\n\n“Kevin was pretty brave,” the director said. “Obviously, with the bears and the lions, you couldn't put anybody next to them. But they were on set with us, and Kevin was brave enough to get in with the wolf and massage the wolf, and he seemed like he liked it.”\n\n“I did not like it,” James piped in.\n\n“And the elephant and those other animals were really great,” Coraci said. “But I admire Kevin for being brave enough, because I actually wouldn't go near the wolf.”\n\n“The bears were close to us (on set), and all I would do is plan my escape route,” James said. “I know I'm faster than Coraci, and I know the cameraman's a smoker — I push him aside, and I'm out the door and already back in my trailer. That's the way I would plan it, and it was scary at times.\n\n“But the lion was the one that was most intimidating,” James said. “You know, the bears were huge and goofy, and they felt sweet. But that lion came on the set and boy … and when it was done working, it was done, that was it.”\n\nCoraci added, “Getting the animals' attention was a big part of directing them. It was like look right, look left. It would be about food first with the lion, then he would get full, and he would almost be done. If we still needed his attention, they'd come out with a crazy mask and that would get his attention. Then it was like, OK, bring out the horse, and they would literally bring out a beautiful black stallion 60 feet away, and the lion would suddenly perk up.”\n\n“Then, when the horse wasn't working anymore,” James said, “they'd walk me around.”\n\nStory about people\n\nBut despite all the care and attention paid to the movie's animals, James said they were there in service of a real human-scale story. Griffin gets into trouble when, at the urging of his shallow girlfriend, he forsakes his natural career, takes on a new, high-powered job and tries to become someone he's not.\n\n“I can't speak for anyone else,” James said, “but I've tried in the past being someone I'm not to impress somebody and to try and be who I think they want me to be. And ultimately it ends up being a mistake. I think when you find out who you really are and find someone who loves you for that, that's when it works the best. I think the movie is kind of about being yourself. And if that doesn't work, throw poop at them.”"
