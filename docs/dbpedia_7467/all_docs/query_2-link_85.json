        "text": "Bullitt County Delay Birth Certificates\n\nMary Hatton has made a list of delayed birth certificates for Kentucky, and the ones for Bullitt County are listed below. We are very grateful to Mary for making this available.\n\nMary makes these comments: \"Kentucky started keeping birth and death records in 1852, stopped in 1862, started again in 1874, but didn't get serious about it until 1 January 1911. Before that date, births and deaths were recorded at the county level and copies were forwarded to the state once a year. Surviving birth records are mostly for the years 1852-1861, 1874-1879 and 1900-1910. Because of official indifference and neglect, no records are extant for many of the years before 1911.\"\n\n\"People lacking official certificates could file delayed birth certificates with the state. This became common starting around 1940 due to the requirements of Social Security and military service.\"\n\n\"Delayed birth certificates contain name, date of birth, place of birth, sex, race, parents' names, ages, etc. similar to regular birth certificates. Plus two older witnesses, one related one unrelated.\"\n\n\"In Kentucky, the Department of Vital Statistics has most of the delayed birth certificates. There is an index on microfiche which can only be consulted at the Department. The Kentucky Historical Society also has 45 rolls of microfilmed delayed birth certificates.\"\n\n\"This index has name, date of birth, county, mother's maiden name, volume & certificate number. Copies of certificates may be ordered from the Department of Vital Statistics, 275 Main St., Frankfort KY 40601. Cost is $9 each.\""
