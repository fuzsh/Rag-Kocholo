        "text": "The legal and policy framework on statelessness in Germany has both positive and negative aspects. Germany is State Party to relevant human rights instruments but retains two key reservations to the 1954 Convention concerning travel documents and social security entitlements. Comprehensive population data is published online, including on statelessness, but without a dedicated procedure to identify and determine statelessness, estimates for the stateless population remain inaccurate. There are other administrative procedures through which statelessness can be identified and some case law on the determination of nationality status; however, without a dedicated mechanism in place, stateless people are not granted a protection status nor rights, unless also recognised as refugees.\n\nThe law establishes that a country of removal must be set prior to detaining, and procedural safeguards are in place to protect against arbitrary detention. However, Germany has entered into readmission agreements that allow stateless people to be removed to countries of former residence without guarantees of protection. German nationality law has provisions to prevent statelessness in some cases, but there is a legal residence requirement for children born stateless in Germany to acquire nationality, and problematic birth registration practices lead to inconsistencies in recording key data and access to birth certificates. Provisions on deprivation of nationality may result in statelessness only when it was acquired by deception, and deprivation of nationality on national security grounds is not permissible.\n\nGermany is party to all the relevant regional and international instruments, except for the Convention on the Avoidance of Statelessness in Relation to State Succession (which it has signed but not acceded to) and the Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers. Customary international law has direct effect in Germany, but international treaties must be incorporated into domestic law. Three of the core statelessness conventions have been incorporated; however, on incorporating the 1954 Convention, Germany reserved the right not to implement Article 27 on travel documents, and to apply Article 23 on access to social welfare only to stateless people who are also recognised as refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention.\n\nPopulation data in Germany is comprehensive, with the Federal Statistical Office publishing a wide range of statistics. The online Genesis Datenbank allows for searches on a range of topics including nationality, legal basis for acquiring nationality, and types of residence permit held. A ‘stateless’ category is included but there are also overlapping categories, such as ‘unclear nationality’, ‘without indications’, and ‘Palestinian’. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees regularly publishes asylum statistics, and parliament has undertaken inquiries into stateless refugees and asylum seekers, including on detention. However, there is no clear mechanism for identifying and determining statelessness in Germany, little awareness of the issue, and it is not clear how statelessness is recorded in administrative procedures. Detention data is not disaggregated by nationality status, and as each federal state collects its own detention data, not all of it is aggregated and published at national level.\n\nIdentifies whether countries have a definition of a stateless person in national law that aligns with the 1954 Convention, and whether they have a dedicated statelessness determination procedure (SDP) leading to a dedicated stateless status. If an SDP is not place, it assesses whether there are other procedures in which statelessness can be identified or other routes through which stateless people could regularise their stay or access their rights. Countries are subdivided in three groups to enable comparison between those with an SDP leading to protection, those with other procedures, and those with a statelessness status but no clear mechanism to access protection. The existing procedures and rights granted to stateless persons are examined and assessed against international norms and good practice. Assesses whether stateless people fleeing war have access to temporary protection.\n\nThere is no dedicated statelessness determination procedure (SDP) in Germany, though statelessness may be identified during other administrative processes, such as refugee status determination or applications for residence or travel documents. However, none of these has determination of statelessness as an objective. There is no obligation to consider a statelessness claim, although some guidance has been developed by the administrative court on the determination of nationality status. The definition of a stateless person in German law is in line with the 1954 Convention, but without any residence rights attached to identification, protection is limited. In most cases, stateless people refused refugee protection are subject to removal and issued a ‘tolerated stay’ permit, which enables access to very basic assistance and restricted employment for the time they cannot be removed. Positively, a new law adopted in 2022 has introduced the right to stay for people who have held a tolerated stay permit for more than five years, although this is still not a statelessness-specific protection status.\n\nA range of different types of immigration detention are provided for in German law under different rules and procedures, which include some protections against the arbitrary detention of stateless people. There is a requirement that a country of removal is identified prior to detaining someone. However, even where nationality status has not been confirmed, readmission agreements allow for stateless people to be removed to places of former residence. The law provides for relatively strong procedural safeguards, including a time limit, ex officio reviews, and judicial oversight. However, on release from detention, tolerated stay is often granted, which maintains the obligation to leave the country and does not protect stateless people from re-detention. In 2019, grounds for immigration detention were expanded, a new category of tolerated stay for people with undetermined identity was introduced, and detention and deportation rules were significantly tightened.\n\nSome safeguards to prevent statelessness are provided for in German law, including in the case of foundlings, adopted children and children born abroad to German nationals if they would otherwise be stateless (though registration is required). However, there is no full safeguard to prevent statelessness in the case of children born in Germany and there are practical barriers to birth registration, including that registry officials are required to report people with irregular residence status to the authorities and birth certificates may not always be issued in practice. Provisions in German law require at least five years of continuous, legal residence, as well as evidence of statelessness in some cases, before stateless children born on the territory can acquire German nationality. All children born in Germany since January 2000, who have one parent with at least eight years legal and habitual residence, acquire German nationality automatically. There are provisions on deprivation of nationality that could render a person stateless.\n\nLibrary of resources, legal instruments, publications and training materials on statelessness, specifically relevant to this country. More regional and international materials, as well as resources from other countries, are available on the Resources library. Domestic case law can be consulted in the Statelessness Case Law Database (with summaries available in English).\n\nPlease note that we are in the process of adding new resources, so check back soon."
