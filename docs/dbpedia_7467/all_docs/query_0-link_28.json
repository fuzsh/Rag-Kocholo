Born in Hamburg, water comes from above, water comes from the front, water number one, nothing is that important.\"\n\n- Jan Delay, using a self-quotation from the song \"Wassermann.\"\n\n\"Water is a precious commodity, and making it available, in the best possible manner, is our daily mission. With Jan Delay, we have found a partner who, in his own style, can convey this message to the minds of many like no other\".\n\n- Dr Günter Stoll, General Manager of Grünbeck Wasseraufbereitung GmbH.\n\nAs part of the collaboration between the artist and the company, Jan Delay and Grünbeck have produced a joint music video focusing on our most important resource - WATER!\n\n\"Together we are celebrating our most important element.\" (Quote from Joern Heitmann - Director)\n\n“Water is No.1 for us“ (Quotation Jan Delay)\n\nA successful partnership is based on trust, honesty and communication. We believe that this means being open and honest with each other. In doing so, directness and sincerity define the common denominator of the partnership. Anyone who knows Jan Delay knows about his honest and direct nature. This is exactly what we value and demand at Grünbeck. Pursuing a common goal and at the same time being critical and honest with each other.\n\n\"And now it is actually the first time that a company has approached me, and I've thought that this is somehow positive and a good thing. The product is good, what they're doing is good and, above all, the company is good and I can do something with it. And I can stand up there and say this is a good thing, this is easy to represent.\"\n\n– Jan Delay\n\n\"...it's exactly about me being able to say how it should be and that they trust me on this and that they don't want to have someone they have to tell what to do. And that’s exactly what I loved.”\n\n– Jan Delay\n\n\"Water treatment doesn't have to be a dry topic. We are all directly or indirectly affected by it. With his groove, Jan conveys exactly the feeling we need for our brand, and the sanitary, heating and air-conditioning industry, to reach current and future target groups.\"\n\n- Matthias Wunn, Marketing Manager of Grünbeck Wasseraufbereitung GmbH.\n\n\"And this is where I come in wearing colourful suits. I don't know exactly how it will turn out yet, but it'll be exciting and also fun. It's not meant to be an \"in-your-face\" advertisement, but simply something that entertains you and is very tasteful. I can't give too much away at this point. But the content will definitely be entertaining and creative...\"\n\n– Jan Delay"
