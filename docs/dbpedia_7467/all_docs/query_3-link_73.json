        "text": "If you start receiving benefits at age 67 you get 100 percent of your monthly benefit. If you delay receiving retirement benefits until after your full retirement age, your monthly benefit continues to increase.\n\nThe chart below explains how delayed retirement affects your benefit. The increase is based on your date of birth and the number of months you delay the start of your retirement benefits. If you start receiving retirement benefits at age 70, you'll get 124 percent of the monthly benefit because you delayed getting benefits for 36 months.\n\nWhen you reach age 70, your monthly benefit stops increasing even if you continue to delay taking benefits.\n\nIf you decide to delay your retirement, be sure to sign up for Medicare at age 65.\n\nIn some circumstances, medical insurance costs more if you delay applying for it.\n\nHow Delayed Retirement Affects Your Social Security Benefits"
