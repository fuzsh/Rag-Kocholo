        "text": "The question of how a delay in a C section can lead to a birth injury is one which comes to the minds of some mothers as they replay their labor and delivery, especially when they have been informed that their child has suffered a birth injury. An emergency C section can sometimes be the last thing standing between a baby who is delivered with no birth injury and one who has suffered a birth injury.\n\nOne of the main purposes of this Maryland birth injury article is to talk about the dangers of fetal distress and the importance of a C section when a child is no longer tolerating a vaginal delivery.\n\nWHAT IS FETAL DISTRESS?\n\nFetal distress in this context is essentially a baby receiving a lack/reduced level of oxygen during labor and delivery. During a vaginal delivery, doctors and nurses can use the electronic fetal heart monitor to help assess the baby’s wellbeing. In addition, in some instances an electronic fetal scalp electrode can also be used to asses the baby’s wellbeing.\n\nThe above devices can alert doctors to some of the possible red flags during the labor and delivery such as:\n\n· Late decelerations\n\n· Minimal variability\n\n· Bradycardia\n\n· Tachycardia\n\nMeconium, which is the baby’s stool, coupled with the above can also be supportive evidence that the baby may be in distress.\n\nHOW A DELAY IN A C SECTION CAN LEAD TO A BIRTH INJURY\n\nAs a mentioned above, fetal distress in this context is a baby receiving a lack/reduced level of oxygen. Without oxygen, injury to the brain can occur. Because this is the case, it is imperative that doctors timely diagnose and treat fetal distress.\n\nDoctors can use certain treatments like repositioning the mother, giving oxygen, etc.… However, if these things do not alleviate the fetal distress, as evidenced by the readings from the fetal heart monitor, or fetal scalp electrode, then an emergency C section may be warranted. The C section can help remove the baby from whatever is causing the distress.\n\nWAS YOUR BABY IN FETAL DISTRESS AND DOCTORS FAILED TO TREAT IT?\n\nHopefully after reading this educational article, and watching the accompanying video, you have a better understanding of how a delay in a c section can lead to a birth injury.
