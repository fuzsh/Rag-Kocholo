        "text": "DUSSELDORF, GERMANY, December 24, 2010 /24-7PressRelease/ -- One of Germany's top hip-hop artists is set to delight his fans when he plays live in Dusseldorf next month.\n\nJan Delay, the Hamburg-born musician also known as a member of La Boom and Absolute Beginner, will perform at the city's Philipshalle venue on Friday January 21st 2011.\n\nDelay's Bahnhof Soul tour is due to call at several venues in Germany and Austria as he continues to promote recent album Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Soul, which was one of the bestselling records in Germany last year.\n\nFor Dusseldorf hotel guests, the Philipshalle show could provide an opportunity to experience some German music that people outside the country are not usually exposed to.\n\nThe artist - real name Jan Phillip Eissfeldt - is known for his distinctive nasal voice, preference for Nike Air Max trainers and tendency to change his stage name depending on his mood and the style of music he is performing.\n\nAs well as hip-hop, Delay's recorded output has spanned genres such as reggae, dub and funk.\n\nAccording to MTV, the performer \"likes to hide behind sunglasses and under hoods\", while his songs are characterised by lyrical content that is often \"humorous and political\".\n\nHe started out on the Hamburg hip-hop scene in the late 1990s, forming his own record label to support underground talent.\n\nTickets for Delay's upcoming appearance in Dusseldorf are available to buy online for EUR34.25 (GBP29). The show is due to begin at 20:00 local time.\n\nFor more information on this event, visit the Philipshalle website or contact the venue on (+49) 0211 775057.\n\nLateRooms.com recommends a range of accommodation in Dusseldorf, including the Relexa Hotel Ratingen City.\n\nEditors Notes:\n\nwww.LateRooms.com is part of the B2C sector of TUI Travel PLC's Accommodation and Destination Division.
