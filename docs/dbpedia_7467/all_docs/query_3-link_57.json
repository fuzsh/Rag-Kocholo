        "text": "Tom DeLay (born April 8, 1947, Laredo, Texas, U.S.) is an American Republican politician who served as a representative from Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives (1985–2006). He served as majority whip (1995–2003) and majority leader (2003–06) but resigned from the House in June 2006 in the face of corruption charges.\n\nDeLay spent a good deal of his childhood in Venezuela because of his father’s career in the oil and gas industry. He attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, before earning a biology degree from the University of Houston (1970). He owned and operated an insect-exterminating business before winning election to the Texas State House of Representatives in 1978. He remained in office until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1984.\n\nIn the House, DeLay rose swiftly through the ranks of the Republican leadership, earning the nickname “The Hammer” for his persistence and for his ability to bring fellow Republicans into line through the use of threats. In 1994 the Republican Party ousted the Democrats from power in the House of Representatives for the first time in four decades. DeLay subsequently was elected majority whip, at the same time that Rep. Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House. DeLay was a strong supporter of the Contract with America, a Republican-initiated legislative agenda that included tax cuts and a balanced budget. A vocal detractor of the Environmental Protection Agency, he was roundly criticized by Democrats for supporting a proposal to repeal air-quality regulations enacted in 1990 by amendments to the Clean Air Act. In 1998 he sharply criticized Democratic Pres. Bill Clinton for apologizing for America’s role in the slave trade; DeLay said it was not right for a president to “attack” his country in such a way. Later that year DeLay helped to lead the successful Republican effort to impeach Clinton."
