        "text": "Airing times\n\nCro\n\nGermany\n\nPresentation:\n\nRap and pop are together, again! Eurochannel invites you to meet one of the greatest German artists of the last decade, whose ventures not only include music but also design and other performing arts. Eurochannel is proud to present you with the panda that has revolutionized German pop and rap by mixing them with unprecedented success. Welcome to a special with Cro.\n\nGerman rap superstar Cro has racked up millions of clicks on the Internet, won two Echo Awards, and his debut album Raop went gold five times already. Not bad for a man who wears a panda mask and appeared out of nowhere three years ago. Now with his second album, Melodie, already on the store shelves, he has been topping the German charts since July 2014.\n\nAs part of the new wave of German rap, which includes artists such as Musi and Casper, Cro represents another trend of the genre. Much nicer and with a different style that sets him apart from the traditional ghetto image, he has conquered a wide base of fans. Even his colleagues praise him; as German Hip-Hop and Funk legend Jan Delay said, Crois the \"future of German rap.\"\n\nNow, to celebrate the release of his most recent album, Melodie, Eurochannel pays homage to Cro and invites you to surrender to his mind-blowing mix of rap and pop.\n\nBiography:\n\nCarlo Waibel, better known by the stage name Cro, is a German rapper, singer, producer and designer, born on January 31, 1990. He describes his music as a blend pop and rap, which he calls \"Raop.\" Cro began recording at the age of 13 while learning piano and guitar. In 2009, he released his first mixtape,Trash. In 2011 he signed with Chimperator Productions and his first album, Raop, was released in 2012. In July 2014 he released his second album, Melodie."
