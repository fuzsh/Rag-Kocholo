        "text": "When we think of Brazilian music we think of samba, bossa nova, a cool breeze on the beach and the Girl from Ipanema. But what do you think of when you think German music? Do you think of laid-back melodies and velvety vocals? Or more industrial staccato and alveolar trills?\n\nWhatever your particular associations may be, today I’d like to share a few German songs that are in many ways the antithesis of the type of sound commonly associated with bands like Rammstein. I’ve added both some classics and contemporary titles and some really strange stuff as well. Also you can find a link to the full albums on Spotify for a deeper dive and the lyrics below.\n\nReady? Put on your Kopfhörer and let’s go!\n\nFreundeskreis – Leg dein Ohr auf die Schiene der Geschichte\n\nCircle of Friends – Put your Ear onto the Rail of History\n\nreleased: 1997\n\nalbum: Quadratur des Kreises\n\ngenre: conscious rap\n\nThis song by Stuttgart hip hop group Freundeskreis, from the acclaimed album Quadratur des Kreises (squaring of the circle), was released at the start of a new wave in German hip hop, just two years after the wildly popular release by one of the founding groups of German hip hop Die fantastischen Vier (also hailing from Stuttgart) released their album Lauschgift, and one year before the Absolute Beginners‘s Bambule made Hamburg hip hop a household name.\n\nIt’s all about encouraging a general historical awareness: the remembrance of injustices, the tyrannies of war, chemical weapons, Tchernobyl etc., and it’s perhaps the song that firmly cemented Freundeskreis’ reputation as a politically and socially aware group that fused intellectual ideas with smooth grooves.\n\nEven if you don’t like Freundeskreis’ somewhat didactical approach to storytelling (lyrics below) it’s simply a great laid-back tune.\n\nIch war ein ABC-Schütze in der Zeit um ’80\n\nMan las von ABC-Geschützen in der Zeitung, ein Streit entfacht sich\n\nI was a school starter in the time round ’80\n\nYou read about ABC weapons in the paper, a conflict is ignited\n\nLyrics: Genius\n\nJan Delay – Vergiftet\n\n“Poisoned”\n\nreleased: 2001\n\nalbum: Searching for the Jan Soul Rebels\n\ngenre: reggae\n\nAfter the overwhelming success of the aforementioned Hamburg hip hop group Absolute Beginners, one of their members, Jan Delay recorded a solo album which proved once and for all that reggae in German isn’t only possible, but for some strange reason sounds much better than you’d expect.\n\nThe lyrics are admittedly easier to follow than the somewhat highbrow approach of Freundeskreis, and may actually provide some good practice opportunities for German learners because the whole song follows the template of “X doesn’t like Y, because he/she/it is poisoned.” Enjoy this Gift to humanity!\n\nSam mag den deutschen Hip Hop nicht, denn der ist vergiftet\n\nUnd Jochen mag keine “Klingeling”, denn das ist vergiftet\n\nSam doesn’t like the German Hip Hop, because it’s poisoned\n\nAnd Jochen doesn’t like no “ding-a-ling”, because it’s poisoned\n\nLyrics: Genius\n\nEins Zwo – Die Omi aus dem ersten Stock\n\n“One Two – The Granny from the First Floor”\n\nreleased: 1999\n\nalbum: Gefährliches Halbwissen (“Dangerous Superficial Knowledge”)\n\ngenre: rap\n\nSince we’re reminiscing about the golden age of German hip hop around the turn of the millenium, here’s another absolute classic for you, by yet another legendary Hamburg hip hop group. It’s this heartfelt little vignette about an old lady that lives upstairs from rapper Dendemann:\n\nWir wohnen nicht Wand an Wand nur meine Decke ist ihr Boden\n\nBald im ganzen Land bekannt die Omi von oben\n\nWe don’t live wall to wall, just my floor is her ceiling\n\nsoon to be known all over the land, the granny from above\n\nLyrics: Genius\n\nTua – Bettler und das Meer\n\n“The Beggar and The Sea”\n\nreleased: 2014\n\nalbum: Stevia\n\ngenre: electronica (?)\n\nAfter our stroll through the past, here’s an atmospheric track by Tua, who originally started out as a rapper as part of the group Die Orsons but soon expanded beyond the narrow confines of the genre with atmospheric textures and stream of consciousness storytelling.\n\nSchlaf holt mich am Tag ein, wie jemand, der mir dringend noch was sagen will\n\nIch folge der staubigen Straße bis runter zum Meer\n\nNachts treffen sich alle, die ich kenne in meinem Kopf und reden gleichzeitig\n\nSleep catches up with me like someone who wants to tell me something urgently\n\nI’m following the dusty road down to the sea\n\nAt night all the people I know are meeting in my head and talking simultaneously\n\nLyrics: Genius\n\nAntoine feat. Teddy Teclebrhan – Lohn Isch Da\n\n“Paycheck is Here”\n\nreleased: 2019\n\ngenre: rap\n\nThe Eritrean-born German comedian, actor and comic Tedros Teddy Teclebrhan first came to my awareness because of this video titled “Einbürgerungstest” (citizenship test) which was a mockumentary interview with an immigrant (played by himself as Antoine) who is generally clueless about all things German, e.g. when asked who the German chancellor is, says: “Something … Angelo? Angelo Merte?”\n\nSome people fell for it of course and started sharing the video as proof for failed integration, while Teddy was counting clicks and giggling away. Anyhow, back to the song in question, in which Teddy raps with a Swabian accent (what do they put in the water in Stuttgart?) and horridly hilarious grammar, which I shouldn’t share with you guys. But this catchy tune about … the joy of … pay day (?) is just too good not to be shared.\n\nEy, Arbeitsamt hat Geld auf Konto gewiesen*, hey\n\nLohn isch da\n\nEy, unemployment office transferred money on account, hey\n\npaycheck is here\n\n*Correct: “Das Arbeitsamt hat Geld auf das/mein Konto überwiesen”\n\nLyrics: Genius\n\nYung Hurn – Bist du Alleine\n\n“Are you alone?”\n\nreleased: 2018\n\nalbum: 1220\n\ngenre: cloud rap (I guess)\n\nWe’re continuing with one of the youngest artists on this list, Yung Hurn from Vienna, whose music and artistic personality divides opinion like no other. Some people say he’s a braindead addict who can barely get through a song without stuttering, others say he’s a musical genius on the level of Drake and Kanye West.\n\nOne thing that’s for sure though: the formula of Viennese accent + Autotune + sharp beats and smooth pads creates a very unique sound. When it comes to the lyrics, they are somewhat … plain. Lack of skill or sheer genius? Judge for yourself!\n\nSie wollen mich am Boden sehen\n\nSie werden mich nie verstehen\n\nIch will Diamanten auf mei’m Ring\n\nDiese Zahl auf mei’m Hals, sie glänzt\n\nThey want to see me on the floor\n\nThey will never understand me\n\nI want diamonds on my ring\n\nThis number on my neck it blings\n\nLyrics: Genius\n\nDeichkind – Richtig gutes Zeug\n\n“Dykechild – Really good stuff”\n\nreleased: 2019\n\nalbum: Wer sagt denn das?\n\nDeichkind originally started out as one of the better known Hamburg hip hop groups in the late 90s. But while many of these groups got older and chucked their baggy pants, Deichkind slowly morphed into a strange Dadaist electropunk art project with infamous stage shows, outrageous costumes and the strangest music videos. Their 2019 album “Wer sagt denn das” is a brilliant (or insane?) reflection about fake news, consumerism and vapid party culture.\n\nThe song “Richtig gutes Zeug” is a persiflage on the mind-numbing consumer society of the 21st century in which we talk about common commodities as if they were holy relics from some Indiana Jonesian temple.\n\nRichtig gutes Zeug, richtig gut\n\nMega schwer zu kriegen, wirklich schwer zu kriegen\n\nRichtig gutes Zeug, richtig gut\n\nMusst du mal ausprobier’n, ausprobier’n\n\nRichtig gutes Zeug, richtig gut\n\nScheint ganz gut zu sein\n\nDa musst du richtig lange suchen für\n\nRichtig lange recherchier’n\n\nReally good stuff, really good\n\nSuper difficult to obtain, really difficult to obtain\n\nReally good stuff, really good\n\nYou gotta try this, try this\n\nReally good stuff, really good stuff\n\nSeems to be pretty good\n\nYou really gotta look hard for it\n\nResearch really hard\n\nOther highlights on this album include Wer sagt denn das?, Dinge, Keine Party and if you still need to get that Teutonic fix after all, also check out their brachial hymn on the Thousand-Year-Long Empire Of Beer.\n\nLyrics: Genius"
