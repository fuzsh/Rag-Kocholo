        "text": "John Yang:\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been a dramatic increase in the number of young children who have been slow to develop language skills. Pediatric speech delays more than doubled for children aged 12 and younger. PBS Wisconsin reporter Zac Schultz spent time with students and teachers to find out what's behind this increase and whether schools have the resources to help children speak up.\n\nZac Schultz:\n\nThe children in this early headstart classroom are your typical two to three year olds. But they were born during the COVID-19 pandemic and some are at risk of developing a speech delay.\n\nNichole Spooner:\n\nThey were facing isolation, stress with their families, trauma, things of that nature. And so they're coming in now with really some challenging behaviors, speech delays, things of that nature. I think we're up about 10 percent right now and children who have speech delays diagnosed.\n\nZac Schultz:\n\nMegan Bohlken is one of four full time speech language pathologists at Platteville School District in southern Wisconsin. Each of their case loads is maxed out. And once a student is diagnosed with a speech delay, federal and state law mandates the district provide the services, whether they have the funding or not.\n\nMegan Bohlken:\n\nAre definitely kids who will just hand you stuff and expect that you know what they want to do with it and not say anything to you.\n\nRebecca Alper, University of Wisconsin at Madison: Early language skills are one of the best predictors of academic social vocational outcomes.\n\nShakeda Caldwell, Teacher:\n\nThese events are going to record the amount of interactions that we're having with each other, it's going to tell us how often we talk to each other because talking is very important.\n\nShakeda Caldwell:\n\nWell guess what is going to do, it's going to help you this talk more, and it's going to help your teachers talk to you more. And we're going to build lots of vocabulary together.\n\nTonya Hameister, Director of Education Services, Next Door: They are actually recording the frequency of the interactions between the teachers and the children.\n\nZac Schultz:\n\nTonya Hameister is the Director of Education Services at Next Door. She says from the LENA device, they download the data, which creates a chart to show the number of times a student and teacher talk to each other, that lets the teachers know which students need more attention.\n\nShakeda Caldwell:\n\nSo if I have that child who scored lower who wasn't having many interactions, then I will plan to, okay, I'm going to have a one on one with this child. Maybe I'm going to read more books with him. I want him to name I'm going to ask him what does he see in the book so I can get those words out of hand.\n\nTonya Hameister:\n\nWe saw an increase, especially in the children that were not as verbal that is expressive. We saw a pretty significant increase in the amount of interactions. So the teachers were doing very targeted interactions with children and trying to increase that opportunity for them to be expressive.\n\nZac Schultz:\n\nHameister says Next Door is fortunate enough to have a lot of community support. But she worries about schools that are dealing with a budget crunch and a surge in speech referrals.\n\nIn the last state budget, Governor Tony Evers proposed using the budget surplus to put an extra billion dollars into special education funding, Republicans in the legislature only allotted an extra 107 million statewide over the next two years, just a 2 percent increase.\n\nZac Schultz:\n\nMegan Bohlken says burnout in her industry is a real concern. And while they're doing okay right now, next February, they start screenings for the 4k students. The next wave of speech delays is waiting to be identified.\n\nMegan Bohlken:\n\nThose referrals keep coming as those kids are evaluated. And if they qualify, getting them added onto my schedule, that's when it's going to start to be okay, now I feel like I'm drowning. Now, what are we going to do."
