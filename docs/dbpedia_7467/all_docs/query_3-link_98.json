I am going to try to share some of these with other finishers who belong to my quilt guild to get more quilts finished.\n\nI recently took a little break from community quilts and pieced and completed 4 quilts recently for gifts. I am also completing Sleep in Heavenly Peace Quilts pieced by the members of our guild first, as there is a competition this guild year (ending in August), and entries for prizes based on community quilt donations. That is part of the reason for only completed 3 quilt tops donated by your blog readers since the last time.\n\nI took 12 completed quilts today to Sleep in Heavenly Peace workshop for distribution and we had a Sleep in Heavenly Peace Quilt Sew Day in late April and made a good start on another 11 quilt tops.\n\nOf the 12 donated one was pieced by Annie from Washington State and 2 pieced by Kathy of North Carolina. Here are pictures of those quilts.\n\nThe top by Annie measures 57X61 and she provided backing fabric. I used the pantograph Crazy Puzzle for quilting on all three of the donated tops. I used fabric from my bolts for backing on the tops donated by Kathy.\n\nThe two by Kathy, one measuring 57X76 with a Nautical Theme…\n\nand one with bright strips measuring 59X80.\n\nI have received the following quilt tops and thought I would add those receipts here because of the delay in completing them.\n\nI received 5 tops from Elaine from New York. I received a 2 quilt tops and blocks or pieces that can be made into 2 more from Jeanne from Tucson.\n\nI also received a quilt top from you, and am assuming that it was from the Cresco, Iowa ladies, but am not sure.\n\nAny of these that are not a good fit for Sleep in Heavenly Peace will be finished and donated to churches in mission for the shelters in town.\n\nThanks again for helping to facilitate donations for our Sleep in Heavenly Peace Community Quilts.\n\nWhat great quilts!! Thanks so much for sending them all Karen’s way!!"
