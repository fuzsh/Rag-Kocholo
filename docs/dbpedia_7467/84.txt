About Jan Delay

Jan Phillip Eißfeldt, better known as Jan Delay is a german hip hop-artist. He is a member of La Boom and Beginner, formerly Absolute Beginner. Besides hip hop many of his songs can be considered as reggae, dub or funk.

Jan Delay's lisping, nasal voice is one of his most important characteristics. He likes to hide behind sunglasses and under hoods. Furthermore he is famous for his preference for Nike "Air Max" shoes, seen on several Beginner covers. His lyrics usually are very humorous and political.

In the German hip hop magazine Juice he was the only national artist receiving the "6 crowns", the highest rating possible, for his solo album Searching For The Jan Soul Rebels.

In August 2006 he released his second solo album "Mercedes-Dance" also containing the single "klar". In contrast to his debut album Jazz and Funk sounds dominate and the lyrics are less sociocritical.
