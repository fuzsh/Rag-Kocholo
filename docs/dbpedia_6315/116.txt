Insensitive, cynical insurance salesman Dave Gold (Michael Rapaport) must deal with his dysfunctional family - while they do their best to deal with him. His wife, Vicky (Anita Barone) can be as obnoxious as him; his daughter Hillary (Kaylee DeFer) is constantly misbehaving; his eldest son, Larry (Kyle Sullivan), is emotional and flamboyant; and his youngest, Mike (Dean Collins) is going through the turmoil of puberty. Their chaotic lives are frequently punctuated by Dave's exasperated monologues, made to the audience at home.
