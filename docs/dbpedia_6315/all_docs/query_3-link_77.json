        "text": "Nominated for nine Oscar and 14 Baftas (the Oscars' British equivalent), the English-speaking film industry has shown its appreciation of Edward Berger's German feature film. That admiration is surely due to the film's showiness, though this new adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's novel only briefly appeared in theaters and can now be seen on Netflix. This version of All Quiet on the Western Front runs from the summer of 1917 to the armistice of 1918, but the images of men killing each other, suffering and dying in the mud of an eternal European winter are so striking because they are reminiscent of what we have glimpsed of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThat does not make the film a masterpiece, unlike the 1930 adaptation by Lewis Milestone. In Berger's version, German high school students from a small, wealthy town do not join the Imperial Army in the enthusiastic first days of the war, but in 1917, when the Russian Empire collapsed and the United States entered the war. Nevertheless, they left for the French front, ready to fight. Immediately, through spectacular sets and digital special effects, Berger portrays the scale of the catastrophe that had already been raging for three years.\n\nAn impression of utilitarianism\n\nHe opens by illustrating how the conflict had become an industry. The first scenes detail the process of recovering uniforms from the corpses of men killed in combat. Dressed in these mementoes, the main character, 17-year-old Paul Baümer, and his comrades – who had seen themselves as heroes – are immediately reduced to cogs in a monstrous machine. Except the cogs are made of flesh and blood, and Berger does not leave any mystery about what may happen to them. From bayonets to flamethrowers to tanks fresh out of weapon engineers' imaginations, there are so many ways to break and dismember bodies.\n\nNothing – neither the lyricism of Steven Spielberg's War Horse nor the technical virtuosity of Sam Mendes' 1917, to mention only two films recently devoted to the First World War – is used to soften the brutality. Its bluntness is also due to the soulless accuracy of digital effects.\n\nRather than depicting the conscripts' furloughs and the dialectic between the front and the rear, Berger preferred to show the efforts of politician Matthias Erzberger (Daniel Brühl) who, in the fall of 1918, tried to convince the German general staff to ask for an armistice from the inflexible Marshal Foch (Thibault de Montalembert). The effort to broaden the film's scope to geopolitics leaves an impression of utilitarianism, as if an educational appendix could make some sense of full horror.\n\nNationalist fever\n\nThat is why watching the 1930 film is necessary. Although it was shot in California with English-speaking actors, it manages to develop well-rounded portraits of sacrificed young men (in the role of Paul Baümer, Lew Ayres is remarkable) and to demonstrate the passage of time (including through the disappearance of the early war period's pointed helmets in favor of steel ones), which makes the characters' survival a little more unlikely every day.\n\nThe scene in which Paul returns to his village – which was still gripped by nationalist fever, whereas no one at the front had any illusions about the conflict's conclusion – is as cruel as it is heartbreaking, as are the film's final shots. Filmed when talking movies were only two years old, Milestone's version makes the soundtrack an essential element in the terror that engulfs its young characters.\n\nWhen Universal began distributing the film in Germany, the Nazis unleashed a campaign of terror against theaters that screened it. They managed to get the authorities to ban All Quiet on the Western Front. That hatred is worth all the Oscars.\n\nThomas Sotinel\n\nTranslation of an original article published in French on lemonde.fr; the publisher may only be liable for the French version."
