From the East and Horn of Africa to Brazil, families have been flooded out of their homes, with nowhere else to go.\n\nSadly, disasters like flooding are only going to become more common, as the climate crisis creates more extreme weather patterns and drives more people to flee their homes.\n\nUNCHR is on the ground responding to these climate emergencies, helping people rebuild after losing everything. But we donâ€™t stop there. UNHCR is also working with affected communities to better prepare and adapt to extreme climate conditions.\n\nPlease donate to support this vital work."
