        "text": "I grew up watching a lot of war movies. As a child I was quite fixated on World War II, but after most likely an oversaturation of the genre through war movies and comics I looked toward other modern conflicts. Vietnam and Korea were very interesting to learn about but the wider ideological conflict of the Cold War began to capitvate me.\n\nI’d been alive through the last few years of it, however at the time I’d never really thought too much about it, the biggest notice I took was when I saw that on the atlas’ we used the big country that previous said ‘Union of Soviet Socialist Republics’ had now changed to ‘Russia’.\n\nGetting into alternate history novels by Harry Turtledove and Robert Conroy was the biggest catalyst for me wanting to make something like ‘The War At Home’ and after I played the ‘World In Conflict’ on the PC in 2007 I was hooked on the idea of an alternate history story where the Cold War turned hot. But the twist could be that instead of the usual American or European frontier being the setting, how about my own homeland of New Zealand?\n\nI started The War At Home in 2014 it was first aimed at attempting to make a movie through the usual film and television channels here in New Zealand, but after about three years of leads and dead ends in 2017 I decided to just try and make it myself.\n\nThus from 2018 until now I have been slowly putting together episodes using the scripts I wrote during the 2014-2017 period, breaking up portions of it and fleshing it out further and then animating them into episodes with a full voice cast, music (thanks Chris Hurn) and a hopefully captivating storyline.\n\nSince it’s just me animating this all, the process is extremely slow going, but I’m constantly finding ways to make things quicker and with help from patrons and supporters, it’s all up from here!"
