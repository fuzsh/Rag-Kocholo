        "text": "In writing my preview of Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s epic 10-part documentary The Vietnam War, which is now airing on PBS and streaming on the network’s app, I couldn’t stop thinking about one particular figure who reappears throughout the series: an eloquent, soft-spoken veteran named John Musgrave. In recent days and weeks, I have learned, other viewers and professional reviewers have found Musgrave equally captivating. Why? Take heed that some big spoilers lie ahead in the next paragraph, if you haven’t yet watched the full series.\n\nIt isn’t only that Musgrave is able to vividly summon the fear and pain he experienced as an 18-year-old Marine serving in Con Thien in 1967, but also that he underwent a profound evolution after suffering grievous wounds and then coming home to an America that was in no mood to honor its veterans. As the documentary advances, Musgrave, who grew up in a Missouri town where his father and his neighbors were revered for their World War II service, retreats into depression, considers suicide, and ultimately evolves into an anti-war activist and member of the organization Vietnam Veterans Against the War (V.V.A.W.). One of the series’ most dramatic moments comes in a later episode, when a bearded, long-haired protester first glimpsed in a still near the very top of Episode 1 is revealed to be the formerly clean-cut Musgrave: a transformed man.\n\nFor my V.F. article, I spoke by phone earlier this year with Musgrave, who now lives outside of Lawrence, Kansas, and has published volumes of poetry about his wartime experiences. Here are some previously unpublished excerpts from our conversation, about the documentary, his life, and the pride Musgrave still takes, despite everything, in having served as a Marine in Vietnam.\n\nVanity Fair: Did you feel ready to tell your story to Ken and Lynn in a way that perhaps you wouldn’t have a decade or two earlier?\n\nJohn Musgrave: There are certain aspects of your stories that never change. But my perspective certainly has. The last two decades have been pretty extraordinary for our country. And for me as well. My story would have been changed somewhat, simply because I wouldn’t have had the 20 extra years of experience and maturity to formulate those opinions. The war that we’re fighting is frighteningly similar to Vietnam. And I think Americans need to be reminded of our war, and what came of it, what came of those types of political decisions. And, hopefully, strike a chord.\n\nBy “the war that we’re fighting,” do you mean our ongoing presence in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the war on terror?\n\nYes.\n\nThe biggest reveal to me in the whole series is when they again show the guy with the beard and long curly hair, and, oh my God, it’s John Musgrave!\n\nIt was a shock to me, too.\n\nIt hits home, how changed a person can be by experience.\n\nI never would have believed that I would have found myself in that position. I went into V.V.A.W. in, I think, December of 1970 or early 1971, and I was medically retired from the Marine Corps in ’69. If you’d had told me in 1969 that I’d be doing that two years later, I would have told you you were full of shit! That would never happen. But in those two years, I discovered I had no choice. I couldn’t call myself a citizen and a veteran if I didn’t do something.\n\nWe have a guilty conscience as a nation about how we treated our Vietnam veterans, and now there’s this automatic response when we meet someone who is in the armed forces: “Thank you for your service.” When, in your experience, did that change?\n\nGulf War. The first one. Desert Storm. I saw a rapid change. Vietnam veterans around the country, guys who hadn’t said a thing for decades, were speaking out. Vietnam veterans were saying, “Don’t treat those guys like you treated us. Never again.” I think Americans looked back, those who were alive in that period, and took a good hard look at themselves, and realized that they had made the horrible mistake of blaming the warrior for the war. But they did make a concerted effort to make sure that those veterans returning from Iraq knew that Americans appreciated their service. Looking back on it, as far as I can remember, that was the moment.\n\nWe honor soldiers now during the seventh-inning stretch of baseball games, but, in general, we still don’t provide sufficient aid and support to our returning veterans. There’s a lot of lip service to “Thank you for your service.”\n\nRight. There are times when I watch old movies, the ones that were made in the early days of World War II. They’re very patriotic. And the documentaries about the guys coming home. And then I remember what it was like for us, and I add to that what I’m seeing now, with America openly expressing its gratitude. And it sometimes brings tears to my eyes. Because . . . I wanted that. That’s what we expected. We were children of those heroes who came home in 1945, in 1953, to a nation overflowing with gratitude. I don’t think Americans realized how hurt we were. That the best that we could hope for was indifference.\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Vietnam War Is Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s Most Ambitious Project Yet\n\nThe filmmakers will bring their latest documentary epic, more than a decade in the making, to PBS in September. The pair did their best to avoid tired tropes by interviewing those with firsthand accounts, from Vietcong guerrilla fighters to Army deserters.\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nHow Don Hewitt Invented 60 Minutes and Changed Journalism Forever\n\nIn his new book Fifty Years of 60 Minutes, Jeff Fager reports on the rise of CBS’s flagship newsmagazine and the role the producer played in making America’s must-watch TV news program a dynasty.\n\nCelebrity\n\nBlues Legend John Mayall Is Dead at 90\n\nA giant of the great British blues boom of the 1960s was a musical change-agent who revered and honored his forebears.\n\nTelevision\n\nJohn Oliver Tears Into Trump’s “Disastrous” Attack on Kamala Harris’s Multiracial Identity\n\n“Putting Trump in front of a Black audience and asking him to speak on race was never gonna get more elevated than, ‘The lady said she was both Indian and Black—that is cheating!’”\n\nStyle\n\nAs Tensions Continue to Flare Over the War in Gaza, the Upper East Side Is Divided\n\nTalking about the war in Gaza is complicated for Jewish Americans, and in Manhattan’s wealthiest circles, disagreement has created social cloisters.\n\nTelevision\n\nJohn Oliver Called JD Vance’s Campaign to Ask If He’d Ever Had Sex With a Couch\n\nAfter a joke about Vance’s (fictional) fondness for futons went viral, the Last Week Tonight host added his voice to the chorus: “If you ask me to draw a man that f--ks his couch, 10 times out of 10, I’m drawing this guy.”\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Nothing Else\n\nWhen the ex-president is desperate, he gets stuck on the 2020 election—and racist taunts.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nStyle\n\nIf J.D. Vance’s Spotify Account Is Real, Well, It’s On-Brand\n\nHis political views put him outside of the Millennial mainstream, but the 39-year-old VP nominee might have music tastes that place him firmly in the early 2010s."
