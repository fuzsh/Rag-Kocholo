        "text": "The federal government and industrial leaders attempted to reassure a skeptical public and limit the potentially radical gender changes that women’s work posed by casting them as patriotic and necessary and by portraying women workers as the epitome of femininity. “Rosie” might have taken on new roles riveting airplanes or producing munitions, countless posters, films, and newsreels, but she remained feminine with manicured nails, carefully applied lipstick, and styled hair. Moreover, despite her confident attitude and capabilities, she was only a temporary aberration, eager to give up her welding goggles and steel-toed boots for domestic bliss at the war’s end.\n\nWhen victory came, some women were more than ready to return to domestic life, but even those who wanted or needed to continue working found their options severely limited as men returned home and demands for war materials decreased. Without the war to justify the unconventional work of women, many employers pushed women out of the higher-paying positions they had held during the war, out of the workforce entirely, or into lower paying and less secure “pink collar” jobs. Wartime work proved transformative for many women who had embraced its challenges and enjoyed its benefits, but personnel policies at the end of the war moved men and women back into the roles that aligned with prewar gender understandings.\n\nMen on the Home Front likewise found that the war introduced a number of potential challenges to common understandings of their proper roles. While many men perceived the expanding roles of women as a threat, their own status as civilians posed another. The popularization of combat soldiers as ideal men excluded civilian men on the Home Front who, in response, associated themselves with acceptable ideas of masculinity in other ways."
