        "text": "“Civil War” is the movie to watch if you want to see a brutal battle, but there is no side to pick.\n\nThe movie, released April 12, follows journalists traveling through a war-torn U.S. to hopefully get an interview with the president.\n\nThe country has divided and is now battling itself. Alex Garland who wrote and directed “Civil War” does an incredible job of not giving you a political party. There is no Republican, Democrat or any other affiliation.\n\nLee Smith, played by Kirsten Dunst, is the main photojournalist in the movie. There is an edge to Lee. The images that she has captured are on a reel that plays in her head. Lee’s humanity is lost, but not gone.\n\nHer co-worker Joel, played by Wagner Moura, is the journalist wanting the quote from the president. Sammy, played by Stephen McKinley, is a journalist that has a long history with Lee. The character Jessie, played by Cailee Spaeny, sees Lee as a role model and wants to be a photojournalist too.\n\nThe four journalists set out to get the interview that can change their lives. Instead, their lives are changed by what they experience.\n\nThe United States is divided and battling for control of the government. Garland takes the viewer on a road trip of the horrors of war. The brutality of humanity in a lawless country is frightening. Jessie is horrified at what people are doing to each other. She is trying to understand. Lee is brutal in sharing the consequences of the job.\n\n“Once you start asking those questions you can’t stop,” Lee said. “So, we don’t ask. We record so other people ask.”\n\nJessie is trying to prove to Lee she has what it takes to be just like her.\n\n“I’ve never been so scared in my entire life,” Jessie said. “And I’ve never felt more alive.”\n\nGarland was in a hurry to finish this movie due to the current political times we are in, according to the Atlantic, which did an interview with director Alex Garland.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 lockdowns started in 2020 is when Garland finished the script. Garland was also concerned that his passion for the project would fade.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, which had the opportunity to interview Garland, felt it was important to have journalists be the heroes. This is strongly portrayed in the movie. In the movie, the vehicle that is driven has press in big letters written on the side of it. The journalists constantly show their credentials to protect themselves from either side.\n\nIt feels as though Garland is giving a warning as to what could happen to this country if another civil war breaks out. The fear that he displays is real. This is not an easy movie to watch. It will have you questioning your ethics.\n\nMaybe that is what we need in this country, because as journalists there is always hope that people will begin to understand the horror that comes from wars.\n\n“Every time I survived a war zone,” Lee said. “I thought I was sending a warning home. Don’t do this. But here we are.”"
