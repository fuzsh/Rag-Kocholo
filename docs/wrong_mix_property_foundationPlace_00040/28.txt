What's a word for the city in which a person is born? I wanted to use "birthplace" but I feel like it's only used for famous people. What can I use instead of "birthplace" in this sentence?

My birthplace, Venice, is known as one of the most charming cities on the planet.

I would use "birthplace" solely for the place I was actually born. I'd use hometown for the town I grew up in. In my case, for example, I was born in Heston*, we lived in Brumley* until I was 2 years 11 months old, then we moved to Shettenbridge* where I grew up and where, with the exception of a couple of brief sojourns to other places, I still live. (*I haven't used the real town names for obvious reasons!)

Therefore, for me, my birthplace was Heston, my hometown is Shettenbridge, and I really wouldn't mention Brumley at all because I was very young and I remember nothing about it.

For some reason, I would always say 'place of birth' rather than 'birthplace' if I used the noun.

Come to think of it, so would I. I think it's probably because that's how it's worded on most forms we fill in in the UK.

Shettenbridge sounds like a lovely town!

What if you lived about one decade of your life in each of those towns? What would you call them then?

Birthplace can be deceiving. I never lived in the city where I was born. There's no hospital in the place that is my hometown.
