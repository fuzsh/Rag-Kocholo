        "text": "A. General Requirements for Acquisition of Citizenship at Birth\n\nA person born in the United States who is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is a U.S. citizen at birth, to include a child born to a member of an Indian, Eskimo, Aleutian, or other aboriginal tribe.[1]\n\nIn general, a person born outside of the United States may acquire citizenship at birth if all of the following requirements are met at the time of the person’s birth:\n\nThe person is a child[2] of a U.S. citizen parent(s);\n\nThe U.S. citizen parent meets certain residence or physical presence requirements in the United States or an outlying possession before the person’s birth in accordance with the applicable provision;[3] and\n\nThe person meets all other applicable requirements under either INA 301 or INA 309.\n\nUntil the Act of October 10, 1978, persons who had acquired U.S. citizenship through birth outside of the United States to one U.S. citizen parent had to meet certain physical presence requirements to retain their citizenship. This legislation eliminated retention requirements for persons who were born after October 10, 1952. There may be cases where a person who was born before that date, and therefore subject to the retention requirements, may have failed to retain citizenship.[4]\n\nAn officer should determine whether a person acquired citizenship at birth by referring to the applicable statutory provisions and conditions that existed at the time of the person’s birth. These provisions have been modified extensively over the years.[5] In some cases, an officer may need to determine whether an applicant’s parent or grandparent acquired citizenship before the officer can determine whether the applicant acquired citizenship. Officers may request additional evidence needed to establish the U.S. citizenship of the applicant’s parent or grandparent. The following sections provide the current law.\n\nB. Child Born in Wedlock\n\nUSCIS must determine whether a child is born in wedlock[6] or out of wedlock at the time of birth in order to determine which citizenship provision is applicable.[7]\n\nUSCIS considers a child to be born in wedlock when the legal parents are married to one another at the time of the child’s birth and at least one of the legal parents has a genetic or gestational relationship to the child.\n\nUSCIS views post-birth formalization of the legal relationship between a parent and a child as establishing the relationship from the time of the child’s birth. This is because the relevant jurisdiction’s recognition of the legal relationship between the parent and child is based on the circumstances of the child’s conception and birth, including, for example, the existence of a valid surrogacy contract memorializing all parties’ understanding of parental rights pre-conception. This rule applies unless otherwise specified in the law of the relevant jurisdiction or in the applicable court order.\n\nA child born outside the United States acquires U.S. citizenship at birth under INA 301 if at the time of the child’s birth:\n\nThe person is a child[8] of a U.S. citizen parent(s);\n\nThe child’s legal parents are married to each other and at least one legal parent is the genetic or gestational parent of that child at the time of the child’s birth; and\n\nThe parent meets the residence or physical presence requirements under the applicable law and the child meets all other applicable requirements under INA 301.\n\nThe tables below provide examples of different relationships and whether USCIS considers the child to be born in or out of wedlock at the time of birth in each scenario.\n\nIn-Wedlock Determinations Sample Scenarios: Legal Genetic and Gestational MotherMarriage Between[9] …… andIn or Out of Wedlock?Legal genetic and gestational motherLegal genetic fatherIn wedlockLegal genetic and gestational motherNon-genetic legal mother or fatherIn wedlockLegal genetic and gestational motherNon-legal mother or fatherOut of wedlock\n\nIn-Wedlock Determinations Sample Scenarios: Legal Genetic and Non-Gestational Mother[10]Marriage Between[11] …… andIn or Out of Wedlock?Legal genetic and non-gestational motherLegal genetic fatherIn wedlockLegal genetic and non-gestational motherNon-genetic legal mother or fatherIn wedlockLegal genetic and non-gestational motherLegal gestational motherIn wedlockLegal genetic and non-gestational motherNon-genetic and non-legal mother or fatherOut of wedlock\n\nIn-Wedlock Determinations Sample Scenarios: Legal Gestational MotherMarriage Between[12] …… andIn or Out of Wedlock?Legal gestational motherLegal genetic mother or fatherIn wedlockLegal gestational motherNon-genetic legal mother or fatherIn wedlockLegal gestational motherNon-genetic and non-legal mother or fatherOut of wedlock\n\nIn-Wedlock Determinations Sample Scenarios: Legal Genetic Father[13]Marriage Between[14] …… andIn or Out of Wedlock?Legal genetic fatherLegal genetic mother or legal gestational mother (or both)In wedlockLegal genetic fatherNon-genetic, non-gestational legal mother or fatherIn wedlockLegal genetic fatherNon-genetic, non-gestational, and non-legal mother or fatherOut of wedlock\n\nIn-Wedlock Determinations: Cases Involving Gestational Carriers[15]Marriage Between[16]…… andIn or Out of Wedlock?Legal genetic mother or fatherLegal genetic mother or fatherIn wedlockLegal genetic mother or fatherLegal non-genetic mother or fatherIn wedlockLegal non-genetic mother or fatherLegal non-genetic mother or fatherOut of wedlock[17]\n\nParent’s Residence and Physical Presence Requirements\n\nDepending on the law applicable at the time, the U.S. citizen parent(s) also have residency or physical presence requirements in the United States to transmit citizenship to a child.[18] The following table provides the current requirements under INA 301 based on the parents' citizenship.\n\nResidence and Physical Presence Requirements for Parents Before the Child's BirthParents' Citizenship StatusResidence or Physical Presence RequirementChild of Two U.S. Citizen ParentsAt least one parent had resided in the United States or one of its outlying possessions.Child of a U.S. Citizen Parent and a U.S. Noncitizen NationalThe U.S. citizen parent was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of at least 1 year.Child of A U.S. Citizen Parent and Noncitizen Parent who is NOT a U.S. NationalThe U.S. citizen parent was physically present in the United States for at least 5 years, including at least 2 years after 14 years of age.[19]\n\nC. Child Born Out of Wedlock\n\n1. Child of U.S. Citizen Father\n\nGeneral Requirements for Fathers of Children Born Out of Wedlock\n\nThe general requirements for acquisition of citizenship at birth[20] for a child born in wedlock also apply to a child born out of wedlock[21] outside of the United States (or one of its outlying possessions) who claims citizenship through a U.S. citizen father. Specifically, the provisions apply in cases where:\n\nA blood relationship between the child and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence;\n\nThe child’s father was a U.S. citizen at the time of the child’s birth;\n\nThe child’s father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the child until the child reaches 18 years of age; and\n\nOne of the following criteria is met before the child reaches 18 years of age:\n\nThe child is legitimated under the law of his or her residence or domicile;\n\nThe father acknowledges in writing and under oath the paternity of the child; or\n\nThe paternity of the child is established by adjudication of a competent court.\n\nIn addition, the residence or physical presence requirements contained in the relevant paragraph of INA 301 continue to apply to children born out of wedlock, who are claiming citizenship through their fathers.\n\nWritten Agreement to Provide Financial Support\n\nIn order for a child born out of wedlock outside of the United States (or one of its outlying possessions) to acquire U.S. citizenship through his or her father, Congress included a requirement that the father agree in writing to provide financial support for the child until the child reaches the age of 18.[22] Congress included the language to prevent children from becoming public charges.[23] USCIS interprets the phrase in the statute “has agreed in writing to provide financial support”[24] to mean that there must be documentary evidence that supports a finding that the father accepted the legal obligation to support the child until the age of 18.\n\nThe written agreement of financial support may be dated at any time before the child’s 18th birthday. If the child is under the age of 18 at the time of filing an Application for Certificate of Citizenship, the father may provide the written agreement of financial support either concurrently with the filing of the application or prior to the adjudication of the application. USCIS may request the written agreement of financial support at the time of issuance of a Request for Evidence or at the time of an interview (unless the interview is waived).\n\nAlternatively, if the applicant is already over the age of 18, he or she may meet the requirement if one or more documents support a finding that the father accepted his legal obligation to support the child. In such cases, the evidence must have existed (and have been finalized) prior to the child’s 18th birthday and must have met any applicable foreign law or U.S. law governing the child’s or father’s residence to establish acceptance of financial responsibility.[25]\n\nIn all cases, the applicant has the burden of proving the father has met any applicable requirements under the law to make an agreement to provide financial support. A written agreement of financial support is not required if the father died before the child’s 18th birthday.[26]\n\nWritten Agreement Requirements\n\nIn order for a document to qualify as a written agreement of financial support under INA 309(a)(3), the document:\n\nMust be in writing and acknowledged by the father;[27]\n\nMust indicate the father’s agreement to provide financial support for the child;[28] and\n\nMust be dated before the child’s 18th birthday.\n\nIn addition, USCIS considers whether the agreement was voluntary.\n\nOther Acceptable Documentation\n\nA written agreement of financial support may come in different forms and documents. USCIS may consider other similar documentation in which the father accepts financial responsibility of the child until the age of 18. Some examples of documents USCIS may consider include:\n\nA previously submitted Affidavit of Support (Form I-134) or Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864);\n\nMilitary Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) enrollment;\n\nWritten voluntary acknowledgement of a child in a jurisdiction where there is a legal requirement that the father provide financial support;[29]\n\nDocumentation establishing paternity by a court or administrative agency with jurisdiction over the child’s personal status, if accompanied by evidence from the record of proceeding establishing the father initiated the paternity proceeding and the jurisdiction legally requires the father to provide financial support; or\n\nA petition by the father seeking child custody or visitation with the court of jurisdiction with an agreement to provide financial support and the jurisdiction legally requires the father to provide financial support.\n\n2. Child of U.S. Citizen Mother\n\nThe rules that determine whether a child born out of wedlock outside of the United States derives citizenship at birth from the U.S. citizen mother vary depending on when the child was born.\n\nChild Born On or After December 23, 1952 and Before June 12, 2017\n\nA child born between December 23, 1952 and June 12, 2017 who is born out of wedlock outside of the United States and its outlying possessions acquires citizenship at birth if:\n\nThe person is a child[30] of a U.S. citizen parent(s);\n\nThe child’s mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of the child’s birth; and\n\nThe child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for 1 continuous year before the child’s birth.[31]\n\nChild Born On or After June 12, 2017\n\nA child born on or after June 12, 2017, who is born out of wedlock outside of the United States or one of its outlying possessions acquires citizenship at birth if:\n\nThe person is a child[32] of a U.S. citizen parent(s);\n\nThe child’s mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of the child’s birth; and​\n\nThe child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for at least 5 years before the child’s birth (at least 2 years of which were after age 14).[33]\n\nEffect of Sessions v. Morales-Santana Decision\n\nPrior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sessions v. Morales-Santana,[34] the physical presence requirements for children born out of wedlock were different for a child acquiring citizenship through a U.S. citizen mother than for those acquiring through a U.S. citizen father. An unwed U.S. citizen mother could transmit citizenship to her child if the mother was physically present in the United States for 1 continuous year prior to the child's birth.[35] An unwed U.S. citizen father, by contrast, was held to the longer physical presence requirement of 5 years (at least 2 years of which were after age 14) in the United States or one of its outlying possessions.[36]\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in Sessions v. Morales-Santana, that the different physical presence requirements for an unwed U.S. citizen father and an unwed U.S. citizen mother violated the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.[37] The U.S. Supreme Court indicated that the 5 years of physical presence (at least 2 years of which were after age 14)[38] requirement should apply prospectively to all cases involving a child born out of wedlock outside the United States to one U.S. citizen parent and one noncitizen parent, regardless of the gender of the parent.[39]\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively eliminated, prospectively, the 1 year continuous physical presence requirement that previously applied to unwed U.S. citizen mothers, and replaced it with the higher physical presence requirement that previously applied to unwed U.S. citizen fathers.[40] After Sessions v. Morales-Santana, the 1-year continuous physical presence requirement[41] remains in effect only for those children born prior to June 12, 2017 outside of the United States to unwed U.S. citizen mothers.\n\n3. Child of Two U.S. Citizen Parents\n\nFor children born out of wedlock to two U.S. citizen parents, USCIS determines whether the child acquired citizenship from either parent individually. Once the child acquired from one of the parents, the child is a U.S. citizen, and the officer need not determine whether the child also acquired from the other U.S. citizen parent. Whether a child born out of wedlock outside the United States acquires citizenship at birth from two U.S. citizen parents depends on when the child was born.\n\nChild Born Out of Wedlock On or After November 14, 1986[42]\n\nA child born out of wedlock on or after November 14, 1986, is a U.S. citizen at birth, if:\n\nThe person is the child[43] of two U.S. citizen parents;\n\nBoth of the child’s parents were U.S. citizens at the time of the child’s birth; and\n\nEither the U.S. citizen father meets the requirements to transmit citizenship under INA 309[44] or the U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous[45] period of 1 year before the child’s birth.[46]\n\n4. Summary of Physical Presence Requirements for Parents of Children Born Out of Wedlock\n\nThe following table outlines the physical presence requirements under INA 309 based on the parents’ citizenship.\n\nPhysical Presence Requirements for U.S. Citizen Parents Before the Child's BirthParents’ Citizenship StatusPeriod Child was BornPhysical Presence RequirementU.S. Citizen Father and Noncitizen Parent Who is Not a U.S. NationalOn or after December 24, 1952, and before November 14, 1986The U.S. citizen father was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions (OLP) for at least 10 years before the child’s birth, including at least 5 years after the age of 14.On or after November 14, 1986The U.S. citizen father was physically present in the United States or OLP for at least 5 years before the child’s birth, including at least 2 years after the age of 14.U.S. Citizen Mother and Noncitizen Parent Who is Not a U.S. NationalOn or after December 24, 1952, and before June 12, 2017The child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or OLP for 1 continuous year before the child’s birth.On or after June 12, 2017The child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or OLP for at least 5 years before the child’s birth, including at least 2 years after age 14.Two U.S. Citizen ParentsOn or after November 14, 1986, and before June 12, 2017\n\nThe child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or OLP for 1 continuous year before the child’s birth; or\n\nThe child’s U.S. citizen father satisfies all of the requirements in INA 309(a), and at least one parent resided in the United States or OLP before the child was born.\n\nIf the U.S. citizen father does not meet all the requirements for the child to acquire through the U.S. citizen father, then the U.S. citizen mother must satisfy 1 continuous year of physical presence in the United States or OLP before the child’s birth.\n\nIf the U.S. citizen mother does not meet the physical presence requirements, then the U.S. citizen father must satisfy all the requirements in INA 309(a), and at least one parent must have resided in the United States or OLP before the child was born.\n\nOn or after June 12, 2017\n\nThe child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or OLP for 1 continuous year before the child’s birth; or\n\nThe child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or OLP for at least 5 years before the child’s birth, including at least 2 years after age 14;[47] or\n\nThe child’s U.S. citizen father satisfies all of the requirements in INA 309(a), and at least one parent resided in the United States or OLP before the child was born.\n\nIf the U.S. citizen father does not meet all the requirements for the child to acquire through the U.S. citizen father, then the U.S. citizen mother must satisfy 1 continuous year of physical presence in the United States or OLP before the child’s birth, or 5 years of physical presence in the United States or OLP, at least 2 years of which were after age 14, before the child was born.\n\nIf the U.S. citizen mother does not meet the physical presence requirements, then the U.S. citizen father must satisfy all the requirements in INA 309(a), and at least one parent must have resided in the United States or OLP before the child was born.\n\nD. Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600)\n\n1. Submission of Application\n\nA person born outside the United States who acquires U.S. citizenship at birth is not required to have evidence of such status. However, if the person seeks documentation of U.S. citizenship status, the person may file an Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600) with USCIS.[48]\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security has jurisdiction over the administration and enforcement of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) within the United States, and the Secretary of State has jurisdiction over claims of U.S. citizenship made by persons who are abroad.[49] Therefore, generally, an Application for Certificate of Citizenship is submitted by persons who claim U.S. citizenship and are present within the United States. However, USCIS accepts a Form N-600 filed by a person who does not live in the United States, but USCIS does not adjudicate the application on the merits until the person is present in the United States in order to ensure that USCIS has jurisdiction over the application.[50]\n\nA person who is at least 18 years of age may submit the Application for Certificate of Citizenship on their own behalf. A parent or a legal guardian may submit the application for a child who has not reached 18 years of age.\n\nUSCIS issues proof of U.S. citizenship in the form of a Certificate of Citizenship if the Application for Certificate of Citizenship is approved and the person takes the Oath of Allegiance, if required to do so.\n\nUSCIS does not mail Certificates of Citizenship outside the United States except when a military member is issued a Certificate of Citizenship under INA 320[51] or a military member’s dependent child naturalizes under INA 322(d).\n\n2. U.S. Passport or Consular Report of Birth Abroad as Evidence of Citizenship\n\nA person may also apply for a U.S. passport with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) to serve as evidence of their U.S. citizenship.[52] A parent or legal guardian of a U.S. citizen child born outside the United States may also apply to the local U.S. embassy or consulate for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA or Form FS-240).[53] A U.S. passport is valid for a limited time as established by DOS policies and standards on passport issuance.[54] Once a passport is expired, it is no longer conclusive evidence of citizenship.[55] Neither a CRBA nor a Certificate of Citizenship expires.\n\nA valid, unexpired U.S. passport or a CRBA serves as evidence of a person’s U.S. citizenship.[56] An applicant for a Certificate of Citizenship may submit a valid and unexpired U.S. passport or a CRBA as evidence of U.S. citizenship.[57] The officer must review the valid U.S. passport or CRBA and the documentation submitted with the application and contained in the record to determine if it was issued properly.\n\nThe officer approves the Application for Certificate of Citizenship if the applicant is a U.S. citizen and meets all requirements.\n\nRequest to Revoke U.S. Passport or Cancel Consular Report of Birth Abroad\n\nIf the officer determines that the applicant is not a U.S. citizen or has evidence indicating that a U.S. passport or CRBA submitted as evidence was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously, the officer reviews the case with USCIS counsel. Then, if appropriate, the officer may request that DOS revoke the U.S. passport or cancel the CRBA.[58]\n\nOnly DOS has the authority to revoke a U.S. passport or cancel a CRBA.[59] DOS may revoke a U.S. passport or cancel a CRBA in cases where the passport or CRBA was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously.[60]\n\nUSCIS provides the following information to DOS in the passport revocation or CRBA cancellation request:\n\nThe applicant’s complete biographic information, including name and any known aliases;\n\nThe applicant’s last known address;\n\nAll previous unexpired U.S. passport numbers and alien registration numbers (A-numbers);\n\nA copy of the CRBA or of the biographical page of the U.S. passport submitted as evidence (if available);\n\nAn explanation for requesting revocation or cancellation, including reasons for the request, analysis of the facts and dates used in determining that the passport or CRBA should be revoked or cancelled, and evaluation of evidence indicating that the applicant did not acquire U.S. citizenship;\n\nCopies of all documentary evidence in support of the request, including certified translations of any documents written or originally prepared in a foreign language; and\n\nThe contact information of the USCIS office making the request.\n\nAdjudication of Application with a U.S. Passport Revocation or Cancellation Request\n\nAfter reviewing the case on the merits and requesting a revocation of a U.S. passport or a cancellation of a CRBA from DOS, the officer generally may not complete the adjudication of the Application for Certificate of Citizenship until DOS responds.\n\nIf DOS notifies USCIS that it does not intend to revoke the passport or cancel the CRBA, USCIS approves the Application for Certificate of Citizenship.[61] However, in cases with unusual or complex circumstances, USCIS may further consult with DOS.\n\nIf USCIS has evidence indicating that a U.S. passport submitted as evidence was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously, and the passport was valid at the time of filing, but is expired at the time of adjudication, the officer should review the case with USCIS counsel and DOS before adjudicating.[62]\n\nIf DOS revokes the U.S. passport or cancels the CRBA, the officer denies the application in cases where the applicant does not otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for issuance of a Certificate of Citizenship.\n\nE. Citizenship Interview and Waiver\n\nIn general, an applicant must appear in person for an interview before a USCIS officer after filing an Application for Certificate of Citizenship. This includes the U.S. citizen parent or legal guardian if the application is filed on behalf of a child under 18 years of age.[63] USCIS, however, may waive the interview requirement if all the required documentation necessary to establish the applicant's eligibility is already included in USCIS administrative records, or if the application is accompanied by one of the following:\n\nConsular Report of Birth Abroad (FS-240);\n\nApplicant’s unexpired U.S. passport issued initially for a full 5 or 10-year period; or\n\nCertificate of Naturalization of the applicant's parent or parents.[64]\n\nF. Decision and Oath of Allegiance\n\n1. Approval of Application, Oath of Allegiance, and Waiver for Children under 14 Years of Age\n\nIf an officer approves the Application for Certificate of Citizenship, USCIS administers the Oath of Allegiance before issuing a Certificate of Citizenship.[65]\n\nHowever, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) permits USCIS to waive the taking of the Oath of Allegiance if USCIS determines the person is unable to understand its meaning.[66] USCIS has determined that children under the age of 14 are generally unable to understand the meaning of the oath.\n\nAccordingly, USCIS waives the oath requirement for a child younger than 14 years of age. If USCIS waives the oath requirement, USCIS issues a Certificate of Citizenship after the officer approves the application.\n\n2. Denial of Application\n\nIf an officer denies the Certificate of Citizenship application, the officer must notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for denial and include information on the right to appeal in the notice.[67] An applicant may file an appeal within 30 calendar days after service of the decision (33 days if the decision was mailed).\n\nFootnotes\n\n[^ 1] See INA 301(a) and INA 301(b).

See Appendix: Nationality Chart 1 - Children Born Outside the United States in Wedlock [ ] for additional information.\n\n[^ 19] Time outside the United States counts as physical presence in the United States if the time spent outside the United States was:\n\nAs a member of the U.S. armed forces in honorable status;​\n\nUnder the employment of the U.S. government or other qualifying organizations; or​\n\nAs a dependent unmarried son or daughter of the household of a person described in one of the above categories of such persons.\n\n[^ 20] See INA 301(c), INA 301(d), INA 301(e), and INA 301(g). See Section A, General Requirements for Acquisition of Citizenship at Birth [12 USCIS-PM H.3(A)].\n\n[^ 21] See INA 309. See Appendix: Nationality Chart 2 - Children Born Outside the United States Out of Wedlock [ ].\n\n[^ 22] A separate agreement or contract is not required for the father to satisfy the requirement. See INA 309(a)(3). See the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. 99–653 (PDF) (November 14, 1986).\n\n[^ 23] See the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1986, Pub. L. 99–653 (PDF) (November 14, 1986). The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) was intended to keep families together and generally construed in favor of family unity and the acceptance of responsibility by family members. See Solis-Espinoza v. Gonzales, 401 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n[^ 24] See INA 309(a)(3).\n\n[^ 25] In many cases, the issue of whether the father agreed to provide financial support depends on foreign law. The applicant bears the burden of proving the father has met any applicable requirements to make a binding agreement under the law. See Matter of Annang (PDF), 14 I&N Dec. 502 (BIA 1973). Officers should consult USCIS counsel about any requirements under the law.\n\n[^ 26] See INA 309.\n\n[^ 27] A court document may be signed by a judge rather than the father, but may still serve as evidence to meet this requirement if there is an indication in the record of proceedings that the father consented to the determination of paternity.\n\n[^ 28] Since the statute only provides for the agreement of the father to provide support and does not provide for any loss of citizenship if the agreement is not met, USCIS does not consider whether the father actually provided financial support.\n\n[^ 29] For example, a birth certificate or acknowledgement document submitted and certified by the father. Under U.S. jurisdictions, a written voluntary acknowledgement of a child generally triggers a legal obligation to support the child. However, under foreign jurisdictions, a voluntary written agreement may not always trigger a legal obligation to support the child. The officer may consult with local USCIS counsel for questions regarding the effect of the law.\n\n[^ 30] For the definition of a child, see Chapter 2, Definition of Child and Residence for Citizenship and Naturalization [12 USCIS-PM H.2].\n\n[^ 31] See INA 309(c).\n\n[^ 32] For the definition of a child, see Chapter 2, Definition of Child and Residence for Citizenship and Naturalization [12 USCIS-PM H.2].\n\n[^ 33] See INA 301(g). See Sessions v. Morales-Santana (PDF), 137 S.Ct. 1678 (2017).\n\n[^ 34] See Sessions v. Morales-Santana (PDF), 137 S.Ct. 1678 (2017).\n\n[^ 35] See INA 309(c).\n\n[^ 36] See INA 301(g).\n\n[^ 37] See Sessions v. Morales-Santana (PDF), 137 S.Ct. 1678 (2017). See U.S. Constitution, amend.

Morales-Santana (PDF), 137 S.Ct. 1678 (2017).\n\n[^ 40] See INA 309(c).\n\n[^ 41] See INA 309(c).\n\n[^ 42] For periods before November 14, 1986, see Appendix: Nationality Chart 2 - Children Born Outside the United States Out of Wedlock [12 USCIS-PM H.3, Appendices Tab].\n\n[^ 43] For the definition of a child, see Chapter 2, Definition of Child and Residence for Citizenship and Naturalization [12 USCIS-PM H.2].\n\n[^ 44] See Section C, Child Born out of Wedlock, Subsection 1, Child of U.S. Citizen Father [12 USCIS-PM H.3.(C)(1)].\n\n[^ 45] The term “continuous” means that the physical presence in the United States is uninterrupted, without any absence.\n\n[^ 46] If both parents of a child born out of wedlock are U.S. citizens, the mother’s physical presence requirement continues to be 1 year of continuous physical presence in the United States or outlying possessions (OLP) as INA 309(c) required before Sessions v. Morales-Santana (PDF), 582 U.S. 47 (2017). The Supreme Court decision in Morales-Santana did not address the situation where a child is born out of wedlock to two U.S. citizen parents.\n\n[^ 47] On or after June 12, 2017, if the child’s U.S. citizen mother does not meet the requirement of being physically present in the United States or OLP for 1 continuous year before the child’s birth, the U.S. citizen mother may meet this requirement if she was physically present in the United States or OLP for at least 5 years before the child’s birth, including at least 2 years after age 14, consistent with Sessions v. Morales-Santana (PDF), 582 U.S. 47 (2017).\n\n[^ 48] See 8 CFR 341.1.\n\n[^ 49] See INA 103(a)(1) and INA 104(a)(3).\n\n[^ 50] See INA 341(a).\n\n[^ 51] See 8 U.S.C. 1443a.\n\n[^ 52] See 22 CFR 50.4.\n\n[^ 53] See 22 CFR 50.5. See 8 FAM 101.1-2, Introduction to Consular Reports of Birth Abroad.\n\n[^ 54] See 8 FAM 101.1, Introduction to U.S. Passports and Consular Reports of Birth Abroad.\n\n[^ 55] See 22 U.S.C. 2705.\n\n[^ 56] See Matter of Villanueva (PDF), 19 I&N Dec. 101 (BIA 1984) (Unless void on its face, a valid U.S. passport issued to a person as a citizen of the United States constitutes conclusive proof of the person’s U.S. citizenship). See 22 U.S.C. 2705 (A valid U.S. passport or CRBA has the same force and effect as proof of U.S. citizenship as Certificates of Naturalization or Certificates of Citizenship issued by USCIS). See 22 CFR 50.2.\n\n[^ 57] A U.S. passport or CRBA does not serve as evidence of citizenship for noncitizen nationals.\n\n[^ 58] See 22 U.S.C. 211a. See 22 CFR 51.60. See INA 361. See Rules Governing the Granting, Issuing, and Verifying of United States Passports, 31 FR 10603 (PDF) (Aug. 5, 1966).\n\n[^ 59] The process to request cancellation of a CRBA to DOS is the same as that for a passport revocation. The same process should be followed to request the revocation of a parent’s or grandparent’s U.S. passport or CRBA, when USCIS, while adjudicating an Application for Certificate of Citizenship, determines that it was issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously.\n\n[^ 60] See INA 361.\n\n[^ 61] See Matter of Villanueva (PDF), 19 I&N Dec. 101 (BIA 1984).\n\n[^ 62] An expired U.S. passport may not be accepted as sufficient evidence of citizenship. In these cases, officers may need to request other evidence of U.S. citizenship.\n\n[^ 63] See 8 CFR 341.2(a)(2).\n\n[^ 64] See 8 CFR 341.2(a).\n\n[^ 65] See INA 337(a). See 8 CFR 341.5(b).
