And for Matt Schwartz. | | Chapter 1 (I) An image flashed. The cat clock. tick tick tick tick And unbidden words in her head: It's Sleepytime, Kathy. She frowned then, blinked it all away, and went to light her hourly cigarette... The thought came with no volition at all. It never did. The mail's here, Kathleen Shade thought. Every day she seemed to sense the approach of the squat, cumbersome white vehicle. Was it premonition? By the prickling of my thumbs, she thought, quoting Shakespeare. Ordinarily, she might've laughed, but she never laughed about the mail. The mail provided her only turnstile to the outside terra incognito that was the world. The world felt removed from her. It honed her oneness, erecting her into shining, crumbly dark. The mail truck, and its singular sound the way its brakes squealed, the rumble of its muffler called to her much in a way like lust. The honest urge to touch oneself, for the pleasant yet ersatz sensation. Never to climax. Just for the feeling. The urge had eluded her these days. Odd comparison, she considered. The mail, and precursory masturbation...\n\nShe'd been working on her \"Verdict\" column. Dear Kathleen: My boyfriend, with whom I've been living for three years, recently suggested that we \"swap.\" It was at a work party. I didn't know what he meant until a friend explained. He wanted us to switch sexual partners with my boss and his wife! When I refused, he (my boyfriend) took me aside and told me it would be good for my career! Can you believe it? I really love my boyfriend, but this suggestion leaves me shocked. What should I do? Kathleen typed her response: Dear Shocked: Any man who needs to \"swap\" simply offers more proof of his own male sexual defectivity. Not only does he insult your love for him, he offends himself by verifying his lack of real domestic priority. And in his further coercion, i.e. his suggestion that trading partners would enhance your career status, he commits an even less forgivable slight the traditional male two faced rationalization: the pursuit of his own kinky pleasure as an excuse. Your boyfriend, therefore, demonstrates his utter unworthiness. He is selfish, immature, and prevaricating. Dump him. There. Short and sweet. Kathleen's \"Verdict\" column had become a hit. She'd merely applied, citing her sociology degree and a few published writing samples. \"We like your edge,\" the senior editor had told her. Besides, teaching had bored her. Though the $600 per month she made from '90s Woman didn't pay all the bills, it made her feel she was doing something. It also made her feel... What? Connected to something. A moment later she turned to the next letter (she received several dozen per week) and the thought rang: The mail. She could even be napping, and would wake to realize the mail had arrived. One man she'd dated years ago had told her, \"All women are psychic.\" I guess that's how I knew you were an ass before we even met, she thought now. When she'd caught him sleeping around, he'd claimed, \"You gave me no choice!\" She severed the memory. The mail, the mail, she thought. In cutoff jeans, an old white Bud Burma men's longsleeve shirt, and barefoot, she went to retrieve the all important mail. No check this week; God knew she could use the money. Her father always came through, at least. Because\n\nhe loves me? Or because of guilt? It scarcely mattered now. \"I'm very proud of you,\" he'd said when she'd been given \"Verdict.\" \"Your mother would be too.\" What about Uncle Sammy? she'd wanted to ask. Do you think he'd be proud of me? Should I send him the magazine in prison? She opened the front door and peered out. Washington, D.C. had a smell no matter where you lived. It wafted up the open stairwell. The hall stood empty. I haven't had sex in a year, she thought. But why think that? And why now? Sex often made her feel totally alone; it made her feel unwanted, which never made sense to her. What more proof did she need of being wanted than an erect penis? She sometimes smirked when she saw lovers holding hands in Georgetown Park, or couples kissing in public. Her neighbors infuriated her, their passion raging through the wall. Mr. and Mrs. Bedsprings. Stop fucking! she yearned to yell at the wall every night. The mail. Why did it seem so important today? It whispered false promises to her, as Uncle Sammy had, and many of the men she'd made love to. \"I ascend to the blinding light,\" she whispered, descending the apartment steps. A boot lifted away in the sunlit entrance the mailman. Before the glare, and the heat shining off cars, it looked like a foot stepping into hell. The August humidity made her feel pallid and dry. She got her mail out of the gray row of boxes, and went back up. As she climbed, she felt the sensation of descending. Since turning 30 three years ago she felt choked in a web of opposites: she felt chilled in the heat, she felt bright in utter darkness. I'm weird, she thought. She did weird things sometimes, like eating only peanut butter for days, or looking at the Spiegel catalogue upside down to see how funny the faces became. She rarely wore clothes in the apartment. Nakedness offered up a reality to her, an encompassing one. She watched TV naked. She read, cleaned, ate, did laundry she even wrote her column naked. Why wear clothes inside? she reasoned. No one can see. Who'd want to see, Fattie? a darker voice inquired. She insisted she was fat, though she really wasn't. She could stand to drop 10 pounds (maybe 15 would be better) but she wasn't really fat. According to the woman shrink on the radio at night, Kathleen had acquired a \"negative self concept continuum.\" She had a bad image of herself. It was all childhood, according to the woman shrink. Constancy hypothesis from Womb Exit. Reactivity to gender realization. Connate impressions during the formative years. Uncle Sammy probably had a lot to do with it, too. She wore her self perceptions like a winter jacket, which wrapped her in contradictions. I'm an unsocialized sociologist. Frequently she felt phony. \"Verdict\" required her to apply deft sociological interpretations, as well as solutions, to the love related quandaries of her readers. The column thrust her forward as an expert on love, when she'd never really been in love at all. She'd loved men, she supposed, but that wasn't the same. If they only knew! she thought. God. Womanhood, which her column exalted, often felt like a curse to her personally. She didn't know\n\nwhat to do with it. She didn't really even know what it was... She closed and locked the door. She took the mail to the kitchen. AT&T bill, WG&E bill, MasterCard bill. A renewal notice for Cosmopolitan. A renewal notice for Allure. And the weekly carrier envelope from her editor. Readers sent their problems to \"Verdict\" care of the magazine, and the magazine sent them to her. Several dozen envelopes spilled out of the carrier, most of them the standard 4 1/8 x 9 1/2. And then there was one larger envelope The cramp popped in her loins. Shit! she thought. Her period always arrived like a sniper shot. Menstruation pissed her off; it didn't seem fair. If women have to bleed from their vaginas, men should have to bleed from their penises. Blood trickled. It felt hot. Just as she would make tracks for the bathroom, though, she caught herself standing still, staring. She was staring at the larger envelope. It was 9 x 6, manila. Her name and the magazine's address had been typed neatly on a white adhesive label. Kathleen opened it, wincing at the steady cramp. First, there was an index card on which had been typed: DEAR MS. SHADE: YOU ARE A GREAT WOMAN. IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE SENDING YOU MY STORY. CONSIDER IT A PROPOSITION. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT STORY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO MY STORY? Kathleen's frown turned her face up. There was no return address on the envelope. What story? she wondered. Her fingers delved deeper. Something else in here. A thin foil packet wrapped in plastic. Unbidden, she thought of drugs. They wrapped drugs in foil, didn't they? Kathleen had never used drugs herself. Too scary. She'd never even smoked pot because she heard it increased appetite. But she remembered from her college days, kids brought hash into the dorm wrapped in foil, and LSD tabs. Curiosity throbbed with the cramp. She opened the packet on the kitchen counter, peeling away first the plastic, then the foil.\n\nInitially it didn't seem to be what it undoubtedly was. It seemed flattened, like a twist of raw chicken skin. Kathleen could have sworn that her heart stopped for the full minute that ticked by before she called the police. (II) Flesh gorgeous, shining shellacked in blood. It's the image she craves. It's the truth behind the image. And The Cross. She remembers the others, and sighs. She remembers The Cross. It's an anticipation: to see the flesh shining in blood. The Amytal always keeps them out. I hope you liked the back rub, she thinks. I give good back rubs, don't I? His face looks childlike in this ponderous unconsciousness. It's a wonder. His skull seems to glow beneath his face. Skulls mean death, her mother says. She Crazy Glues his eyes shut. She daintily ruptures his eardrums with a Skeele 1.75 mm biopsy curette. With lovely violet suture and an Ethicon FS 3 radial needle, she sews his lips shut. She likes that. Questions kiss her, they lick her.\n\nIt's very erotic, these questions. What do they think when they wake up? What goes on in their minds? They can't see, they can't hear. They can't speak. They can't even move. But they can feel. She always gives them a lot to feel. Here he comes. \"You're back,\" she says. She caresses his penis. \"I give good back rubs, don't I?\" she asks, not that he can hear the question, oh no, not with his eardrums punctured. \"I never lie. I told you I give good back rubs.\" She imagines his horror: deaf, dumb, blind, immobile. This imagining arouses her, it lifts her smiling to her tiptoes, swells her perfect nipples, glows between her legs. Soon he's snapping his wrists and ankles against the Peerless Model 26 detention cuffs. It's a lovely, bracing sound, the sharp metallic snap snap snap! Lovelier still: the way his entire face lengthens to misshape, his eyes trying to open, his mouth trying to open, and the frantic swallowed sounds from his throat. \"What are you thinking?\" She rubs his flexing stomach. \"What's going on in your mind?\" She works on him for a long, long time. He keeps going out, and the hypodermic keeps bringing him back. \"Skulls mean death,\" she says matter of factly. Bruns serrated plaster shears. What they are, exactly, is a nine inch long pair of angled stainless steel scissors, designed for cutting off plaster casts. The Miltex version costs $52.50 per pair, not that she had to buy them. \"No plaster casts today,\" she says. The shears open.\n\nHe's still alive. The shears close. \"There.\" His hips heave. The buried scream rages in his throat. \"Did that feel good?\" To her left is The Box of Souls. To her right is The Window. In the Window she sees The Cross, all white in light. She smiles. Her surgical gloves are beautiful bright red now. His blood is on her; it feels lovely, hot, exotic. And here is the image she's awaited: to see him shine in his own viscid, wet beauty. She lets him simmer down some. She looks at what she's done. She looks at her slick red hands. She hopes that Kathleen Shade will want to do her story. Â«Â« Â»Â» Clay Adams dissecting pin. What it is, exactly, is an 18 inch long stainless steel rod, the width of a knitting needle, designed for pushing organs aside during autopsies. He's numbly convulsing.\n\nHe's still alive. She inserts the Clay Adams dissecting pin into his left nostril and with her palm very slowly drives the rounded steel point deep into Mother! Mother! she thinks. his brain. | | Chapter 2 (I) \"Faggot.\" Spence was standing in front of the mirror at the HQ bathroom. He was straightening his tie when he turned to face the person who'd just entered. Some LT from District Four Narcotics; Spence couldn't place the name. \"What did you say?\" Spence asked. \"I said you're a faggot. Get that tie nice and straight. You want to look pretty for the boys.\" Spence finished his tie. \"What's your problem, man? What's your beef with me? You don't even know me.\" D4 glared back. \"A police department is no place for homos.\" Spence, in resolute calm, rammed his fist into the LT's mouth so hard there was an echo in the tiled room, a sound like five pounds of raw sirloin hitting the floor. What also hit the floor was this D4 lieutenant. His eyes crossed at once, and he fell hard. Spence leaned over to finish the tune up when his beeper went off. He grabbed D4's collar and gave a good shake. \"Listen, asshole. The only reason I'm not going to flush you down the toilet is because I just got beeped. But don't ever cross my path again, all right? Don't even walk down the same hallway as\n\nme unless you want to get aired out like somebody's laundry.\" Groggily, D4's eyes focused, blood on his lip. \"I I'm gonna file charges.\" \"Go ahead,\" Spence said. \"You picked the wrong homo to fuck with today. See how far you get filing charges against an MCS officer. See how long it takes before you're spending the rest of your career emptying parking meters.\" Spence, then, let him go, checked his tie one last time, and walked out of the bathroom. He was not offended, nor agitated, nor pissed off. He couldn't have cared less. (II) \"So. You're the feminist writer.\" The voice: monotone, dark. He'd identified himself as Lieutenant Jeffrey Spence. His face looked ruddily handsome; he seemed fit, and wore a nice baby blue dress shirt, suspenders, and a dark silk tie. Broad shoulders, well styled short dark blond hair. Kathleen guessed he must be about 30. She also received the immediate impression that he didn't like her. \"I'm a magazine writer,\" she corrected. \"I do a monthly column.\" \"For a militant feminist magazine,\" Spence added. \"Do you make a living? From this feminist column?\" \"It's not a feminist column. It's a self help column.\" \"Ah. Well. Do you make a living from it?\" \"No,\" Kathleen said. D.C. Police Headquarters occupied an entire block of Indiana Avenue; it reminded her of a vast above ground crypt. At the front desk, an old sergeant with chin mole that looked like a tumor directed her down a hallway longer than an airport concourse. Is this the secret hall? she thought. It was empty, silent. She frowned, heels tapping. She'd worn a flowered billowy wedge dress, and she feared now that it made her derriere look huge. Fattie, she condemned herself. Go back on Slim Fast.\n\nHQ MAJOR CASE SECTION read crisp black block letters across the blond wood door. It reminded Kathleen of other letters, which now felt stamped across her eyes: WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO MY STORY? Spence looked like an irked statue behind the desk. To his right a computer screen blinked SYSTEM DOWN in pretty amber. \"Do you know a man named Stephen W. Calabrice?\" Spence asked. \"No,\" Kathleen said. \"Is he the victim?\" \"That's right. Hot shot trademark attorney. Upper , upper class bar hound. This guy's bar tabs were more than most people make in a year.\" \"He's dead?\" \"What? Did you think he was recovering? Take two aspirin and call me in the morning? Is that what you thought?\" Asshole, Kathleen thought. \"May I smoke here?\" she asked. \"No,\" Spence said. \"You live at \" He glanced down at some nondescript sheet. \"At 3660 Leiber Street, number 307?\" \"Yep.\" \"Nice place?\" Was there some purpose hidden behind the tangents of Spence's questions and comments? Or was he just a nut? \"It's all right, I guess,\" Kathleen said. \"It seems to be one of the safer apartment complexes.\" Spence tilted his head. \"Insinuating?\" \"Pardon me?\" \"You're insinuating that other apartment complexes aren't safe because of police negligence?\" \"I was making an objective comment.\" \"Oh. Yes. Of course.\" Spence pushed back in his seat. Yes, he was very muscular; Kathleen sensed the great girth of his upper chest, his shoulders, and she could easily picture a\n\nbodybuilder's physique out of the tailored, quality clothes. All ripples and hard lines, and zero body fat. \"Did you know that Stephen W. Calabrice,\" Spence went on, \"had been tortured for an extended period?\" \"How could I know that?\" \"His body was found three days ago in an underground parking garage near the corner of M Street and l9th. He lived in Georgetown. He was murdered in an unknown location. We believe he was picked up in a bar called Jonah and the Whale, taken to the killer's home, tortured, murdered, then dumped. The killer stole his car, a brown Audi Quattro.\" Kathleen remembered a joke, which often rang true. What's the difference between a porcupine and an Audi? A porcupine has pricks on the outside. \"Do you have any acquaintances in the medical field?\" \"No,\" Kathleen said. Spence cleared his throat. \"We believe that a high quality cutting tool was used to, uh...you know. A scissor like implement with one flat blade and one serrated blade. There were drugs in his bloodstream, not street drugs, but pharmaceutical drugs, skillfully administered.\" \"You think the killer's a doctor?\" \"Maybe,\" Spence answered. His eyes stared. \"Do you?\" All right, Kathleen thought. \"You think that I know her?\" \"Her?\" \"The killer?\" Spence put his elbow on the desk. \"Why did you say her?\" \"I...well...\" Kathleen looked at her feet. \"You think the killer's a man?\" \"I want to know why you think the killer's a woman.\" \"I presumed...\" Presumed what? she wondered. \"You just said he was picked up in a bar.\"\n\n\"Maybe Calabrice was gay. Did you consider that possibility? Gays go to bars too, don't they?\" Spence was treating her like an idiot child. Kathleen wished she had a drink to spill on him. Then she thought: Drinks. \"But Jonah and the Whale isn't a gay bar. It's a straight singles club.\" \"Ah, so you hang out there.\" Jesus Christ! \"No,\" she said. \"I don't hang out there.\" \"But you've obviously been there. How else would you know that it's a singles bar?\" \"All right, I've been there a few times.\" \"To pick up men?\" \"To have a drink.\" \"You drink a lot? Writers drink a lot, don't they?\" \"That's a stereotype \" \"Is it? Is it really? I just read an article in Regardie's or somewhere about occupational dispositions of clinical alcoholism. Guess which occupation hosts the highest percentage of alcohol abusers?\" \"Police Lieutenants?\" Kathleen joked. Spence didn't react. \"Writers. Creative people in general but writers in particular. Faulkner, Hemingway, Poe, Thomas, Fitzgerald \" \"All men.\" \"Sure. But also all writers. It was an interesting article. There's even a suggestion that the genetic propensity toward alcoholism is the actual root of one's propensity toward writing, not the other way around. Most people who become writers were born later in the mother's life, after 30. It's amazing the commonalities in genetics and behavior of those who were born after their mothers were 30. Like night and day.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Kathleen said, \"I just read an article in Discover or somewhere about the subconscious motivations of men who gravitate toward police work. It all revolves around the gun, a phallic symbol, which actually reflects deeply rooted sexual inadequacies.\" \"What does that have to do with your being here?\" Spence asked. \"Nothing,\" Kathleen said. \"I see. In other words you're discreetly implying that my observations about the genetic predispositions of alcoholism have nothing to do with your being here either.\" \"That's exactly what I'm implying, Lieutenant.\" \"And that I made those observations, in truth, to discreetly harass you.\" \"Yes,\" Kathleen said. Spence nodded. His face never changed. It seemed to sit there on his skull. Frozen. Blank. \"Then you've misinterpreted me completely,\" he went on. \"I raised the topic, not to harass you, or to suggest that you're an alcoholic, but to open an avenue of conjecture that's relative to almost every sexually motivated homicide.\" Kathleen didn't know what he was talking about. \"Okay, so what you really want to know is do I drink a lot?\" \"Yes,\" Spence said. \"No,\" Kathleen answered. When Spence set his chin in the crook of his thumb and index finger, his upper arm bulged to the extent of nearly bursting his shirt. \"Do you have any close female friends who hang out in singles bars, or who are alcoholics?\" \"No,\" Kathleen said. \"Is that your natural hair color? Brown?\" Kathleen gawped at the query. \"What?\" \"Or do you have any close female friends with red hair?\"\n\n\"Yes to the first ridiculous question, no to the second.\" \"The reason I ask \" Now Spence moved his chin from one propped up hand to the other. \" is that our technical services crew found several red hairs on the body. Hairfall is quite common in sexually motivated crimes.\" \"She's a redhead, in other words,\" Kathleen observed. \"Who?\" Kathleen rolled her eyes. \"The killer.\" \"There you go again. Your absolute certainty that the killer is a woman.\" Should I leave? Kathleen asked herself. Is there any reason why I should put up with this? \"It's not an absolute certainty. I told you, it's a presumption, and a pretty logical one, I think.\" Spence nodded again, blankly. \"Sure. Oh, and we discerned days ago that Calabrice wasn't gay. I'm just curious as to the basis of your...presumption. But it occurs to me now \" He paused, and tapped himself on the head. \" that it's a pretty stupid curiosity on my part. Of course you presume the killer's a woman. You're a militant feminist.\" \"I'm not a militant fem \" \"This looks pretty militant to me.\" Spence withdrew the May issue of '90s Woman from his desk, and read off some of the table of contents. \"The Man Trap: Don't Walk Into It; What He Doesn't Know Won't Hurt Him; When He's Lying To You: The Giveaway Signs; Exploitation In The Workplace: How To Survive In A Man's World.\" \"They're legitimate articles about some very important topics in our society,\" Kathleen told him. \"Ah, and here we go. â€˜Verdict.'\" Spence looked up. \"In four out of five segments in your column, you recommend that a relationship be terminated in, I must say, some highly specialized terms. â€˜Thumbs down.' â€˜Give him the ax.' â€˜Don't punish yourself, his baggage isn't your problem.'\" Spence smiled very faintly. \"I like this one best of all. â€˜Dump him.'\" Pea brain, Kathleen thought. \"It's a process, Lieutenant, of applying a combination of style and colloquialism that readers can relate to, in response to their relationship problems.\" \"Oh, is that what it is? Style and colloquialism, yes.\" Spence put the magazine down. \"I just don't understand your refusal to admit that you're a militant feminist.\"\n\nKathleen tensed up as she leaned forward. \"Listen to me. I'm not a militant feminist God, that term went out a decade ago. I'm a magazine writer. I'm a sociologist. And that's all.\" \"Ah. I see. A sociologist. I'm sorry.\" Spence kept his voice dead flat, to steepen the obvious sarcasm. \"And these terms, these terms here â€˜Thumbs down, Give him the ax, Dump him' these are accepted sociological designations?\" \"You're an asshole, Lieutenant,\" Kathleen said. \"I resent that. But I also realize that your opinion of me is irrelevant. Are you left handed?\" \"Wha \" Suddenly Kathleen was squinting. Clouds had moved off, leaving the sun glaring in her eyes. \"Would you please close the blinds.\" \"Sorry, they don't work, I'm afraid,\" Spence said. \"Are you left handed?\" Now she couldn't see him at all, just an erect smear before the window. She tried to shield her eyes. \"Yes,\" she eventually answered. \"Why?\" \"The killer's left handed too. Our hand writing analyst could tell by the note.\" \"But the note was typed, not hand written.\" \"We call it strike impactation. The graphology section has special microscopes that measure the depth, in microns, of any planar impactation. The typewriter, by the way, is a Smith Corona Coronet. And we know the killer's left handed because the letters on the left hand side of the keyboard made deeper impactations. Of course, we already had a good idea that the killer was left handed for two other reasons. One, the angle of the...cut.\" Only now did the imagery commence, the scarlet fact driving into Kathleen's psyche like a nail driven into new wood: Just exactly what someone had done to someone else... \"What's the second reason?\" \"Most sex killers are left handed.\" Kathleen could not fathom what he suspected. He can't possibly be that stupid, that rude, she thought. No. No way. \"Let me ask you something,\" Kathleen said. \"What makes you think the killer's a man?\"\n\nSpence looked fuddled at her. \"We don't. We're quite certain that the killer's a woman. The hairs found on the body fusiformally matched a typical female scale count.\" \"Then why \" Kathleen stopped to think, to contain her now bristling anger. More quietly she said, \"Then how come you've been all over me for my presumption that the killer's a woman?\" \"I was merely assessing the motive of the presumption.\" Spence opened his hands flat on the desk. They were big hands, sturdy. \"Most of what I do,\" he said, \"revolves around the simple recognition of inter personal similarities in homicides. There's always something, you know?\" \"No, I don't know.\" \"What kind of word processor do you use?\" \"I don't use one. I use a typewriter.\" Spence's brow did a trick over the blank face. \"I thought all writers used word processors or computers.\" \"Some do, some don't.\" In her eyes, Spence's own computer screen continued to blink in amber: SYSTEM DOWN. \"I don't,\" she said. \"I use a typewriter. And, no, it's not a Smith Corona, it's a Xerox MemoryWriter.\" \"Hmm. Another... Let me think of the right word.\" Spence seemed to drift off behind the stone facade, a big hard finger tapping the blotter. \"Parity,\" he said. \"What?\" \"Another interesting parity. You know. The killer's a woman, you're a woman. The killer's left handed, you're left handed. The killer uses a typewriter, you use a typewriter \" \"This is the most ridicu \" \"The killer was abused as a child, you were abused as a child,\" Spence finished. Kathleen's shock seemed to turn her to a pillar of salt. Spence stared at her. \"As far as the killer goes, I'm only making a, to use your word, a presumption based on known typical psycho social statistics. It's a very reliable denominator, that most sex killers were abused as children.\"\n\n\"What about me?\" Kathleen's voice croaked. \"I ran your name in the records computer.\" \"Bullshit. Your computer's down.\" \"We have more than one computer here.\" No, she thought. Somehow, he knew. \"You guessed, didn't you?\" For the second time, Spence smiled, but this was a sheepish smile, like that of a child caught doing something forbidden. \"All right,\" he admitted, \"you're right. I guessed. Or I should say I deduced.\" He pointed behind him, to his psych degree. \"After all, I'm trained as a psychologist.\" \"If you were trained as a psychologist, why are you a cop?\" \"I felt phony. I wanted to act, rather than counsel.\" Another cut. It was Spence's way of saying that she, as a trained sociologist writing for a woman's magazine, was phony. Just what the hell are you driving at? It was all building up: the policeman's unfounded dislike for her, his insults, his prejudgment, and the preposterous implications... Kathleen's fists clenched in her lap. \"What kind of car do you drive?\" Spence asked next. Kathleen couldn't resist. \"An Audi Quattro, a brown one. I just got it three days ago.\" \"Funny. But there's nothing funny about any of this, is there?\" \"You tell me. You seem to be getting a kick out of it.\" \"I've never been more serious,\" Spence said. \"Do you think Calabrice is laughing? Now, what kind of car do you drive?\" \"Why didn't you just look in your computer?\" \"The computer's down.\" The screen continued to blink: SYSTEM DOWN. \"As you have already observed.\"\n\n\"I drive a 1997 Ford Thunderbird.\" \"Black, probably. Right?\" Kathleen grit her teeth. \"Yes.\" \"And didn't you tell me, shortly after you came in, that you actually didn't make a living as a writer?\" \"Your memory is without equal.\" \"'97 Ford T Bird. That's an expensive car, isn't it? Twenty thousand dollars, 25?\" \"I don't know how much it cost. It was a gift.\" \"From who?\" \"From my father. He helps me out financially sometimes.\" Spence remained expressionless as a stone bust of Caesar. \"Is your father the one who abused you as a child?\" Kathleen sucked a deep breath. \"No.\" Spence looked disappointed. \"Then who was?\" Her nails dug into her thigh, through her dress. Don't...let him...do this to you. \"It's none of your business.\" \"Technically, none of these questions are my business, so why have you answered so many of them?\" \"Because you're a police officer, or facsimile thereof. I've always been taught to cooperate with the police.\" \"So you've been involved in police matters in the past?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Would you elaborate?\" \"It's none of your business!\" Spence did not react to Kathleen's holler. He looked at her a moment, then said very quietly, \"Don't get hostile. Don't get...militant. I'm only asking objective questions.\" \"No you're not,\" Kathleen countered. She felt sweat trickling at her sides, at her armpits. \"There's nothing objective about any of this. You've been absolutely intolerable. I came in here because I was asked to; I'm trying to be of some assistance to you. And in return, you've interrogated me. You're practically accusing me of cutting off a man's penis and mailing it to myself.\" \"Now we're way off base,\" Spence said. \"And you can bet your ass that I'm going to send a letter of complaint to the commissioner.\" \"Chief,\" Spence said. \"What?\" \"We don't have a commissioner, we have a chief. Address your letter to The Office of the Chief of Police, Metropolitan Police Headquarters, 300 Indiana Avenue, Northwest, 20010.\" \"You haven't liked me since the instant I walked into this grubby little office of yours. Why?\" Spence steepled his fingers on the desk. \"I can tell you that. You want me to be honest with you, right? It's not difficult to figure out. You're an unfulfilled columnist for a militant feminist magazine who doesn't even make a living at it. We have a psycho killer on our hands, and for some reason, that psycho killer is very impressed by you, impressed enough to actually write to you, and to send you physical proof of a very heinous crime. The killer's note indicates that she wants to collaborate with you; she wants you to write her story. I'm certain that this idea appeals to you it's the only chance you'll ever have for real fame. You want to turn this very sick person's life into a sensationalist book that will make you rich and famous.\" \"You're an asshole,\" Kathleen reasserted. \"But that's not even my chief complaint. That's not the complete reason I don't like you.\" Kathleen stood up, glaring down. \"What is?\" \"I believe that your selfish, contrived, and very militant magazine writing has directly incited\n\nsomeone to commit an appalling murder, and that because of your written insights, this person will continue to murder people.\" \"I'm leaving,\" Kathleen said. \"You're free to do so. In fact, I encourage you to do so because, to be blunt, your presence in my office unsettles me. But before you go, I'd like your permission to put a tap on your phone and to have your mail rerouted to our technical services division.\" \"If you do either of those things, I'll sue you. I'll also write a feature article about you and your inexcusable treatment of me. '90s Woman has a circulation of 750,000. I will nail you to the wall in print, Lieutenant. By the time I'm through with you, you'll be walking a beat in Alaska.\" Spence nodded. \"And don't get any ideas about concealing evidence.\" Kathleen wanted to slap him. She actually wondered what would happen if she did. Would they put her in jail? \"As usual, I don't have any idea what you're talking about.\" \"Yes, you do. Whether you like it or not, you are very much involved in this case. Anything the killer sends you is district evidence, and if you fail to notify us of your receipt of any such evidence, I will have you arrested for misprision of a felony, obstructing a criminal investigation, citizen failure to report the knowledge of a crime, and tampering with evidence.\" He gave her his card, staring at her, his face forever deadpan. \"Anything you even think might be correspondence from the killer you will not open or even touch. You'll call me, and I'll send a forensics technician to pick it up. I'm quite serious about this. Do not tamper with evidence.\" Yes, she thought, I really should slap him. \"Because,\" Spence finished, \"there's one thing you can count on. This killer, this sick, demented, sociopathic madwoman, is going to be contacting you again very soon.\" | | Chapter 3 (I) A long drooping banner hung along the front of a Mass Avenue hotel: 75 YEARS OF THINKING OF THE FUTURE. The future of what? Kathleen wondered as the banner floated by in the windshield. The city\n\ncommingled with itself, like something pressured together by force: the endless crush of cars, bodies, cement, and heat. Summer wrung sweat out of the air. The future of what? she thought again, and stopped short. Pay attention! Pedestrians plodded sightlessly, their faces wet and pallid under the beating sun. Car exhaust hung in sheets. In spite of the heat, Kathleen kept the a/c off. Washington felt more real with the windows down; she could taste its clarity and its hot, noxious scents. Her own sweat drenched her in minutes as the T Bird lurched on, and her period felt like a hot living sponge, tickling her. Did the heat purge her? And if so, what did it purge her of? In the packed, ornery traffic she felt free in open space. The chaotic pedestrian droves made her feel joyously alone. Perhaps she was alone in her own mind. Her mind hummed. She passed a row of newspaper boxes; each hosted a plastered sign. SILENCE = DEATH. STRANGE BOUTIQUE/MAGAZINE w/HOWARD DEVOTO at D.C. SPACE! And an old one: U.S. OUT OF EL SALVADOR! A young man in a business suit read The Washington Times before the DON'T WALK light. Kathleen eyed him. He looked successful, handsome in some keen way. A pang of animal lust flared, then abated as quickly. Someone like that, her insecurities calculated, most likely would not even pass the time of day with her, or at best he'd acknowledge her only long enough to hump her and climax. Animal lust was relative, she supposed. What would the radio shrink say? she wondered. \"Your open negativity, your activated cynicism and distrust of men, has become the fulcrum between your failed romantic experiences and your unfounded low self concept,\" she'd accounted to one caller. \"Am I the same way?\" Kathleen asked herself. The image relit: the lust. She gasped for real. The man with The Washington Times, now bereft of business suit, was very adroitly pressing her knees back to her face, drawing his penis, which felt long and thin, in and out of her. He's so attractive, she thought, catching breath. Her bed felt like clouds, it seemed small. The man didn't say anything in the slow ministrations of his pelvis. Kathleen felt much more secure in silence; she could concentrate more deeply. He parted her legs, grasping the backs of her knees, and she leaned immediately up to watch. She could see his penis going in and out of her, which seemed fascinating. It seemed like proof of something. \"Almost. Almost. Alm Here,\" he said. But the voice could not have been his.\n\nAt once something crushed her. Some sad, disillusioning truth. A child's hand reached forward in bedroom daylight... Behind her, a carhorn brayed. The light had changed, and the image exploded. \"Oh, blow me!\" she shrieked as the horn behind her continued to blare. The T Bird jerked through the light. In her rearview, the accosting driver's head jiggled in silent tirade, a black with one of those anvil haircuts. He leaned on the horn. \"Inconsiderate anal retentive type A asshole!\" she screamed when the car whipped by. Traffic backed up at the very next street. You can walk faster in this city than you can drive! Rows of cars percolated, going nowhere in the still heat. Was Spence the cause of her bad mood? She didn't think so. One thing she prided herself on was her skill at leaving unpleasantries behind her, or at least so she thought. Up ahead she spied A.V.'s, a wonderful Italian Ristorante where they served delicious, crunchy fried squid. A grad student had taken her there the year she'd finished at Maryland. Kathleen remembered that she'd liked him a lot a snapping wit, short blond hair, blue eyes, and a well lined tanned face yet she couldn't remember his name. He'd been working on his masters in business, at Georgetown, which she'd heard was one of the best schools in the country for that curriculum, and one of the most expensive. She'd slept with him, and he'd never called her back. Months later she'd run into him at the Torpedo Factory Art Gallery in Old Towne. He'd pretended that he didn't know her. Am I that bad in bed? she wondered now, in traffic. Am I that fat and dull? Just before the light changed, she saw Uncle Sammy. Her knuckles whitened on the wheel; blood seemed to tint her vision. In less than a few seconds Kathleen was out of the T Bird and running down the sidewalk, a flowered billowy blur whose feet pounded with her consciousness. Long, unpleasant looks chased after her. \"Sam! Damn you, Sam! Stop!\" He'd been sentenced to 13 years: Lorton. Though it had been part of a federal sting, Sam had plea bargained out of the longer federal charges, 30 years' worth. One of the bailiffs had told Kathleen's father, \"Lorton's one of the worst cuts on the east coast. It's bad time,\" which was fine with Kathleen. And the prosecutor's office had guaranteed that Sammy wouldn't even be eligible for parole until late next year. Liars! She wanted to cry she was so mad. She flew down the sidewalk like something on rails... \"Goddamn you, Sam, you goddamn bastard! STOP!\" He didn't stop. Kathleen's shoes flew off. Way behind her a cacophony of car horns lowed like animals dying en masse. Kathleen stumbled, nearly fell, and sprinted on.\n\nShe nearly collided with the oblivious back. She grabbed the shoulder, wilting at the contact, and spun him around. Her entire face felt wilted shut as she shrieked \"What the HELL are you doing out of pri \" The incredulous face looked contorted. \"Lady, you must be nuts.\" Oh my God. It wasn't Uncle Sammy at all. The summer weight suit looked like good material, a plush pinstriped tan. Stuck under a crisp sleeve she recognized in dread The Washington Times. From somewhere faraway, so distant it wasn't even real anymore, a voice said: Almost. Almost. Alm Here. \"I'm very sorry. I \" The young man jerked a shock of blond hair off his brow. \"You better be. I'm a fucking lawyer. You go grabbing people like that in public and you'll wind up getting sued.\" \"I'm so sorry,\" Kathleen said. She blushed, then turned slowly white. \"I thought you were someone el \" \"Yeah, well next time be more careful.\" The man with The Washington Times turned crisply and walked away. Kathleen thought of a child's plastic cat clock, eyes ticking. The city surged on. Â«Â« Â»Â» She wanted a cigarette but her rule was only one per hour. More than that she wanted a drink but she rarely kept liquor at home. \"I'm losing it,\" she said aloud. She closed the door and locked it. Am I hallucinating now? Am I seeing things? She examined her mail on the kitchen counter. New Woman, Vogue, Woman's Day, and a junk ad selling special cylindrical lightbulbs that cut your electricity bill but cost $15 each.\n\nThat was all. She turned on the radio Sports Talk and turned it back off. She'd already finished this month's column; there was nothing to work on, and the lady shrink's show wouldn't be on for hours. She took off her dress and bra and sat on the couch. The TV fizzed on: soap operas. Their progressiveness, or degeneration, (Kathleen wasn't sure which) amazed her. No more neo victorian love/anguish stories; soap operas, today, rose with the times. Hackneyed plots of ransom schemes, murder, blackmail, sex scandal. Here was one fatally attractive man revealing to his bride that he was gay, while the astonished woman burst into tears, wearing skimpy purple and black lace lingerie. On another channel a young couple lay in bed, trying to figure out who kidnapped Candice's baby? Was it her estranged husband? Her bartender boyfriend Carl? Or Sally Ann, her true love? Yes, television had come a long way. The woman was obviously nude beneath the sheer bedsheets. Kathleen turned off the set and closed her eyes. The killer was abused as a child, you were abused as a child. Spence. How had he known? The bitter anger had drained. Spence was just an obnoxious, typical policeman, an annoyance. If I let him bother me, he wins, she realized. She could feel the perspiration dry up on her skin. She wished she could lose some weight, start exercising, help herself look better. Her inability to do so made her feel envious, and Spence had implied the same thing, hadn't he? He'd implied that she was a smalltime writer looking for the bigtime. The words tapped out in her mind again, in bold film ribbon print: WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO MY STORY? Would I? The answer fell on her, like bricks dumped out of a wheel barrow. Yes. Spence was right, on the wrong grounds. He can go to hell, she dismissed. Of course she wanted to do the story. What writer wouldn't? Spence branded her as a phony opportunist looking for any chance to get out of the rut. But I'm not in a rut, she reminded herself. If a story did come out of this, then she'd do it only because it was a story that deserved to be told.\n\nIck, she thought. She hated wearing clothes when there was no reason, and her panties qualified as clothes. She couldn't very well take them off now she needed them to hold the Always pad in place. At least nature had graced her with little periods, not the great red tides that many women complained of. She seemed, though, to sense them getting even smaller as she aged. Disuse, she thought. Perhaps her psyche had given up on the prospect of her ever having children and her reproductive system was drying up as a result. Once a reader had written to her, a paraplegic. I feel atrophied, she'd said. I feel like rotting fruit. The radio shrink commented one night about tubal ligation, citing essentially the same thing. \"Sex drive will often diminish, as the body realizes that the capacity for reproduction no longer exists.\" I'm rotting fruit, Kathleen thought now. She envisioned her ovaries as desiccated plums, their seeds old and dead. Her vagina felt like a shriveled flower. No taproot to give it fleshy life, just unrequited desire dry as salt. She rarely even masturbated, which seemed pointless and just as dry. It only bottled up her lust, pressing the cork deeper. The red circle on her calendar caught her eye. Oh, Jesus. Tomorrow she had a speaking engagement, a local writers group. TWAW, they called themselves: The Writer's Association of Washington. Kathleen wondered if there was a similar group in Tucson, and hoped not, considering the initials. Suddenly, she didn't want to do it. I'd rather think, she thought. Think about what? some other voice asked. The bizarre query letter reformed in her mind. YOU ARE A GREAT WOMAN. IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE SENDING YOU MY STORY. CONSIDER IT A PROPOSITION. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT STORY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO MY STORY? Kathleen stared. Should she feel guilty? Was she really just a sensationalist? Something awful had happened, after all. Something unspeakable. Something disgusting. But the idea of doing this story excited her. It excited her to no end. And in her mind, the cat clock ticked, its plastic tail and eyes switching back and forth... | | Chapter 4 (I)\n\nShe bites down hard on the towel. She needs to be careful. Her beauty is her power. Her teeth are beautiful, and she doesn't want to break them. The pain is extraordinary. The needle sinks again. She thinks of The Box of Souls. The sad, little pile sinking into itself. Newspaper clippings turning yellow like jaundice on the old people at the hospital. She thinks of her mother. She thinks of Daddy. She thinks of Daddy's Room. Go ahead, Rocco, give 'em both a pop. It hurts so much. But the pain absolves her. In pain there is truth. The pain makes her beautiful. The needle sinks again. She still has the book. Bizarre World, it's called. Warning label: NOT FOR SALE TO MINORS. She'd found it in Daddy's Room. It's black, hard bound. It makes a little crunching noise whenever she opens it, sort of like the crunching noise when she stuck the Yale 13 gauge biopsy needle into that U Street guy's brain stem to see how long he could live with a subdural\n\nmembrane full of motor oil. He hadn't lived long. It was still fun, though. The book whispers many things. Secrets. It's all tribal. INITIATORY RITES is her favorite chapter. Even today, society is a tribe, no different in function than the Uru Wau Waus, the Kushites, or the Druids of eons ago... Pain presses tears from her eyes. She looks up in the mirror. She's placed her feet against the warm glass. She sees her face there, between her pretty legs, looking back. Her face so red from pain it's nearly purple. In the mirror she sees her fingers poised. In the mirror she sees her sex. In her eyes she sees The Cross. Of course! Her story! This will be the first part of her story! She'll begin it tonight. She'll share her secrets. After all, they're both women. They're both from the same tribe. She'll share her secrets with Kathleen Shade.\n\nBut for now... The needle sinks again. She rests awhile. Minutes or hours. Time means nothing to her. She looks at her pretty, bare feet against the mirror, wriggles her pretty, painted toes. She's very smart. She knows lots of things. She's like the tribes. They knew lots of things, too secrets. But who told them the secrets? God? \"It's absolutely unbelievable that your grades are so poor,\" the lanky counselor said. Years ago. She barely graduated. She couldn't concentrate. \"You have an IQ of 177. Do you know what that means?\" \"That means I'm a genius.\" \"Yes, it does.\" She thinks that she would like to put a pencil in his eye. \"You have an eidetic memory. That means that if you applied yourself, if you buckled down to your studies, you could write your own ticket.\" She would like to buckle him down, with shackles. She would write his ticket. She would like to aspirate all of his spinal fluid. She would like to scrape his face off with a Red Devil razor. Just a fantasy. \"Skulls mean death,\" she whispers. Sometimes she walks in her sleep. Sometimes she sees her mother. She's the midnight mopgirl at the hospital. She has no aversions to the job, she enjoys it. When patients excrete in their beds, she likes to clean it up. When patients vomit on themselves, she likes to clean it up and look at it later. Mopping up blood in the ER is her favorite. Seeing the flesh writhe in gunshot agony, or gilled\n\nby knife slits. Innards quivering in opened abdomens. Faces smashed flat by baseball bats. She likes to watch the doctors operate. She likes to see the doctors cut people open. It must be wonderful to get paid to cut people open. Sometimes she rushes to her closet, to masturbate. She lives in a little box of memories, a little box of nightmares. Daddy's House. Though it's really her mother's. Daddy's House is in a little town called Cottage City. Just down from the district line. The old house sits back on the corner, in darkness. No one bothers her. No one can hear. Sometimes she forgets things. Sometimes the lights go out because she forgets to pay the bill. Sometimes she forgets to have the grass mowed, and the neighbors complain. Once she left the garage door open all night. The car a bright green Ford Pinto could be seen from the street 'til dawn. No one said anything, though. Once she forgot to close the window in Daddy's Room. She'd been cutting a man's belly open, to feel his insides, and he'd been screaming. He'd screamed even more when she'd begun to take his insides out of him. How could she forget something so important? No one heard anything, though. Now she sews their mouths shut so they can't scream. She keeps the prostitute down in the basement. Out of the light. Mother gave her the idea. She needs to be very careful. She needs to be smart, like the counselor said she was. The prostitute is secured to Daddy's old workbench. Wrists chained to the hook on the wall. Waist tied down. Ankles chained to the table legs. She's cut a gap in the table, so the prostitute can excrete into a bucket. She's read all about it in the books she ordered from Thomas and Elsevier. Radio immune assay. SEM radiography. Cuticular microscopy. There's no other way. \"I'm sorry,\" she says to the prostitute. \"There's no other way. Please understand. You must understand.\" The prostitute, of course, cannot reply. Her lips, too, are sewn shut by high grade vicryl surgical suture. The suture is a bright pretty violet color. It comes in sterile packets, like condoms.\n\n\"Vanilla?\" she asks. The gap between two stitches leaves enough space for her to feed the prostitute with a convalescent squeeze bottle. She feeds her a nutritional drink called SEGO. It comes in several flavors: vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, and Dutch chocolate. What are you thinking? she thinks. What's going on in your mind? The prostitute's green eyes are dull. She's rack thin stretched out like this, and her ribs show. Nipples so pale they're almost invisible. Nearly invisible marks inside her thighs, where men have burned her with cigarettes. Her throat makes muffled animal gulping noises as she sucks the SEGO through the squeeze bottle's flexible straw. \"I'm saving you. Did you know that? I'm saving you from yourself. You give them power over all of us when you let them use you for their devil. Mother called it the Devil's Horn.\" The prostitute's throat wobbles as she gulps. \"I know. You couldn't help it. Neither could Mother. Sometimes we have to do things we don't like.\" She smiles down. \"Let's get you pretty now.\" She brushes the prostitute's plush hair. She sponges her off and empties her bucket. She clips her nails. She shaves her legs and her armpits. \"There. Better?\" The prostitute's head lolls against the wood. Â«Â« Â»Â» Back upstairs she drinks cold wine called Mouton Cadet. It makes her feel good. It rounds off the hard edges of the pain. Cricket sounds come in through the kitchen window.\n\nIt's hot out. She likes hot nights. When she's in bed, she can see The Cross in the window. Sometimes she walks all the way down Bladensburg Road at night, to look at it up close. The Cross stands huge and beautiful in the middle of the road, in a ring of white light, and it reminds her of something, but she never knows what. It reminds her of something but she never knows what. It reminds her of something but she never knows what. Once she saw the town police shoot a retarded man in the subshop across the street. The man was drooling. The man was having a fit, a seizure, or epilepsy, and a knife fell out of his pocket, and when he reached, drooling to pick up his knife, the police shot him. July's '90s Woman is opened on the table. \"Lose 10 Pounds In 14 Days And Keep It Off!\" reads one article before \"Verdict.\" Folded back next to it is The Washington Post BookWorld. When she closes her eyes she sees beautiful blood. The flesh writhing. Their smothered screams are the herald. To her? To her mother? To The Cross? Later she will type. CALENDAR OF LITERARY EVENTS reads the BookWorld caption. The Writer's Association of Washington, American University, Pickman Fine Arts Center, 7:30 p.m., lectures by abstractionist poet Maxwell Platt and feminist columnist Kathleen Shade. Tomorrow she will go and see Kathleen Shade. (II) Midnight in the city was yellow, an endless shroud of pallor lain by innumerable sodium lights. Spence thought of lost worlds. Metropolitan Police Traffic Branch occupied a pie wedge of 100 year old asphalt where New York Avenue crossed L Street, a high, shabby brick building stained\n\nby age. The desk sergeant, a young black man, seemed enthusiastic, sharp, yet on an instant edge. Spence was no stranger to this regard. Anyone from Major Case Section got it: glints in the eye like subtle terror. They were spooks. The Department Occupational Designation was classified. Nobody really knew who they were or what they did. If you made even an insignificant error in front of any Major Case personnel, you were reassigned. Poor kid, Spence thought. Don't shit in your pants on account of me. \"It was a priority system flag,\" the sergeant said. \"I hope I didn't disturb you, sir.\" The sergeant had called Spence at home. \"If you hadn't disturbed me, you'd have been transferred to Warehouse Division in the morning,\" Spence said, trying to make a joke. The sergeant didn't laugh. \"I diverted them en route on their way to impound. What is it?\" \"GTA,\" Spence said. He was looking at the printout. AUDI 4DR, GR. WT. 3700, TYPE: A, STEPHEN WILLARD CALABRICE. \"GTA? How come it's not on the hot sheet?\" \"You ask too many questions, sergeant. It's a GTA.\" \"Yes sir.\" Through the smudged window he could see the tow truck from District Impound lowering the car off the ramp. Traffic Branch had picked up Spence's priority code on the computer when the vehicle's plates had been run. They'd found it blocking a hydrant in front of a gutted Northwest rowhouse. Parking Section, thanks to budget cuts, didn't even get near that area until after dark now, and A prostitute would know that, Spence considered. Lots of prostitutes shacked up out that way, in the deeper blocks. And no one would fuck with the car an Audi Quattro fearing it might be a pimp's. Hmm, Spence thought. Had the car been parked there deliberately, or for convenience's sake? \"When did your guys tag it?\" \"About 40 minutes ago,\" the sergeant said. He restrained his obvious curiosity. What was the big deal? Cars parked in front of hydrants weren't rare in this city. \"PS's tied up all night these days.\" \"Thanks for moving on this,\" Spence said. \"And call Mobile CES, will you?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" Spence walked outside. He wore tailored shirts from a Korean clothier on Connecticut Avenue, 80 bucks a pop. He had broad shoulders, well developed arms. Keeping fit and wearing good clothes let him feel vividly separate from the city that was falling in on itself. He'd been promoted two years ago he was 36 now from 2nd District Homicide, after solving a rash of crack related murders. \"Major Case Section needs men like you, Spence,\" his deputy chief had told him. \"And I presume you'd prefer to work alone you know, because, uh, because \" \"Because I'm gay, sir?\" Spence asked. \"Well, uh, yes.\" \"I don't prefer to work by myself because I'm gay, sir,\" Spence explained. \"I prefer to work by myself simply because I get more work done.\" \"Excellent. And, well, I want you to know that...well, here you're only judged by your performance record, not by, well, you know, any sexual, uh, preference you may have.\" Spence didn't like to be patronized. He'd merely left, and thanked the man for the promotion. But the new assignment pleased him only because it granted him a professional solitude. He got to work, essentially, alone. Spence was gay. He was also celibate for the last decade due to a steepening anti sociability. Eighteen years ago, when he'd joined as a cadet, gays weren't allowed on the force. Now they had support groups and monthly meetings. Spence had driven a sector beat and gone to night school throughout his twenties, and once he'd gotten his psychology degree, he'd found that the world had changed without him. He saw many tragic things which, over time, cauterized him. He looked at death as a clinician. By now he wasn't even the least bit interested in looking at himself. One night several winters ago, a stool had set him up. Spence wound up killing three guys in an abandoned textile factory near Brentwood. They took shots at him, so Spence hunted them down and killed them. Simple. Then he did the paperwork, went home, and caught the last two minutes of a Redskins/Giants Monday Night game. The Skins lost, and Spence was pissed. A flashback, then, a whisper of memory. Too many years ago to remember, his last lover had broken up with him on a night in the middle of May. The man's name was Reginald, and Spence had loved him.\n\n\"You don't love anyone, Jeffrey. Your job eats you up. You're still half in the closet, pretending.\" \"No, I'm not,\" Spence said. \"I don't give a shit what anyone thinks about me.\" \"You don't care about me. You don't even care about yourself.\" \"That's not true!\" Spence bellowed. Then his voice cracked, like wood splintering. \"Please don't leave me.\" It was the first plea he'd ever made in his life, to anyone. \"Be real, Jeffrey. There's nothing left.\" \"I'll do anything for you,\" Spence croaked. \"Whatever it is you're looking for,\" Reginald said, \"I truly hope you find it. Good-bye, Jeffrey.\" Spence punched holes in the wall when he got home. He bit his tongue 'til he bled, tears in his eyes like hot acid. Goddamn it! You can't do this to me! he thought. I love you! I love you! But the next day it was all gone. He knew he had no choice but to make it go away, like he always had. Reginald was right. (III) The yellow sodium light looked like gas. The tow driver, in Fleet Management overalls, disconnected the Audi from the ramp hook. Spence showed the driver his ID. \"Has this vehicle been inventoried?\" \"Nope. Dispatch rerouted me on my way to the impound lot.\" \"Good,\" Spence said. \"Have you touched anything inside the vehicle?\" \"Nope. Don't need to on a ramp tow.\" The driver was tall and lanky, with disheveled blond hair. \"Sliphammer the trunk.\" The driver's mouth formed some silent objection. He scratched his head. \"Let me slimjim the door. There's probably a trunk button in the glove box.\"\n\n\"I don't want anybody going inside the vehicle. Sliphammer the trunk.\" \"You want me to do a couple hundred bucks' worth of damage for no reason? It's private property. You're telling me to bust up a $40,000 car. All he did was park in front of a hydrant. It'd be easier if I slimjimmed the door and used the trunk but \" \"Take my word for it, the owner won't file a complaint. I don't want anyone but CES people inside the vehicle, for reasons that are none of your business. Neither of us have time to stand here and argue. The Metropolitan Police Major Case Section is fully authorizing you to sliphammer the trunk. So do it.\" The driver scratched his head again. He wasn't a cop, he was just a car jockey. He returned in a moment with a sliphammer and screwed it into the Audi's trunk lock. \"Look,\" he said, \"I'm not going to be held responsible for any dam \" \"Sliphammer the fucking trunk!\" Spence yelled. Two hard strokes on the metal sleeve tore the lock out of the trunk. The night swallowed up the sound, and at the same time a mobile unit from the Criminal Evidence Section pulled into the pie shaped lot. The grotesque sodium light made the brown car look green. As if covered with pollen, or mist. Spence, for whatever reason, thought of his mother. \"Jeffrey, how come you don't go out with friends?\" I don't have any friends. When the trunk lid raised, the towman turned away. Spence gazed down into a trunk full of body parts. (IV) At 3:15 a.m., Kathleen Shade, naked and drenched in sweat, lay deep in REM sleep. She was dreaming. This is a dream, she thought, as though it were of paramount importance that she acknowledge that fact. It made her feel safe.\n\nShe was dreaming that she lay awake in her bed late at night. The moon gazed in at her like an eye behind the window. Darkness hung about her in strangely precise angles. One of the angles was a figure. Was it a ghost? Kathleen didn't think so; she didn't believe in them. I'm in bed dreaming, she thought, and I'm dreaming that I'm awake in bed. She was naked on the mattress, having kicked the sheets fully off. Her nipples, inexplicably, stood erect. The figure, standing to her side, leaned over. It seemed to be holding something out, offering something. What are those? In the moonlight, Kathleen's skin looked dead. The sweat all over her felt like warm slime. \"Who are you?\" she asked. The figure didn't answer. \"What's that in your hand?\" \"Pictures,\" the figure said. It was a woman's voice, one Kathleen didn't recognize. It sounded clement, soft in care. Kathleen's eyes tried to focus upward... Pieces of the darkness itself composed the figure's form. Its hands were black bones. Its face was an abyss. The hand opened. A stack of pictures, Polaroids, fell into Kathleen's naked lap. \"Embrace your hatred,\" the figure said. Kathleen didn't know what that meant. She squinted at the pictures, but it was too dark to make any of them out. The cat clock ticked... \"Would you like to do my story?\" the figure asked. | |\n\nChapter 5 (I) It was disappointment that had dogged her all day, and that made her wonder. The only mail today had been a credit card solicitation and a Neiman Marcus catalog. Nothing forwarded from the magazine. Nothing from the killer. Her cramps were fading. The weatherman said today had almost broken records: 103 degrees. Kathleen had turned the a/c off and opened the windows and the slider, and had sat around all day in her panties. She was thinking about \"the story,\" hoping the heat would incite her. She didn't even know if a story existed. What if the killer never contacted her again? And even if she did, how could Kathleen make a story out of it? What do you look like? she wondered. What's your name? What do you do? She closed her eyes, lax on the couch, and tried to visualize this red haired human cryptogram who'd seen fit to mail her a severed penis. The red hair was as far as she got. The rest stood upright in her mind as only black smears, like a charcoal sketch. Red hair atop a faceless head. A body of shadow. Hands like black bones. The Dream. Of course. The figure in the dream symbolized the killer. You didn't have to be a psychiatrist to figure that one out. And the photographs? Kathleen vaguely remembered. Quite a bit had been booked as evidence at Uncle Sammy's trial. One exhibit had been a King Edward cigar box filled with snapshots of naked children. That's what the nightmare had been about: backwash of her past colliding with her horrific speculations regarding the killer. Embrace your hatred, the figure had said. Kathleen hated Uncle Sammy. She smoked one cigarette per hour; it was a long road. She'd gone from Salems to Merits to Nows, which were the lowest tar she could find. She'd tried cold turkey several times, and had been miserable. Weaning herself slowly made more sense. She discovered, oddly, that anticipating the next hour's cigarette kept her on a sparkling creative edge. It gave her something to look forward to. But that's my life, she thought. Not much ever happened now. All her hopes seemed to exist in the future. She'd lose weight in the future. She'd have a lover in the future. She'd become famous as a writer in the future. I want something now. The sunlight through the sliding glass door made her feel dark. The heat chilled her. She\n\nattempted to masturbate on the couch but gave up after a diligent 20 minute effort. Images of male models left her unimpressed; they weren't real to her. Her fingers dawdled over her pubis for nothing. Often she'd picture herself in bed with past lovers, and would moisten. But then the desire shut down like a power failure when the memory elucidated her own body. It wasn't the men, because Kathleen was much older when Sammy was caught. There was one guy she'd dated in her freshman year at Maryland. He was the only one she'd ever told about Sammy. After a mixer at the Student Union, they had gone back to his dorm and begun to make love, but suddenly, well into the act, Kathleen had gone dry as pumice. She'd had to stop, gushing apologies. \"It's all right,\" the guy had said. \"It's that goddamn uncle of yours, isn't it? I'd like to strangle the bastard.\" But that wasn't it at all. Thanks to a private counselor her father had sent her to, Kathleen was cured of Uncle Sammy's horrific memory within a year. \"Rape Conclusion Substitution,\" the technique was called, and it worked. She knew it wasn't Sammy who sabotaged her sexual desire. She knew it was herself. The image she had, and the concept she had, of Myself, she thought. At 6 p.m., she turned on the radio shrink. \"...and it makes me feel dirty,\" a caller was confessing. \"It makes me feel absolutely perverted. It can't be normal for a woman to become excited while she's breast feeding her baby. I'm so ashamed.\" \"Don't be,\" the radio shrink replied. \"Sexual excitation during breast feeding is not only normal, it's a clinically acknowledged component of primal genetic motherhood. Cave women had a lot of perpetual worries worries that make the stresses of our own lives seem quite paltry such as starvation, predators, inclement weather. Today we worry about our next pay raise; our ancestors, however, had to worry about getting eaten by saber toothed tigers. Its part of the cerebro chemical design of motherhood to feel sexual pleasure while breast feeding. It's an inducement, an additional reason to feed our babies when we might otherwise be worrying about more dire things, and it's not to be confused with any sexual aberration. It's normal and it's healthy and it's nothing to be ashamed about. Many women, in fact, experience minor orgasmic spasms while breast feeding. Think of it as your body's way of reminding you of the importance of keeping your baby well fed...\" This seemed interesting to Kathleen, yet grossly disconnected. She didn't like to hear about babies because it reminded her that she didn't have one, and probably never would. Who'd want to have a baby by me? she asked herself. Her thighs spread on the couch, and her spreading buttocks stretched her panties. When she leaned up, a roll of fat at her waistline looked like a seam in dough. You're a Fattie, Kathleen. You've got to lose weight. But there she went, slamming herself again, doing exactly what she advised her own readers not to do. How many times had readers written in, depressed because their boyfriends had left them for slimmer women? Kathleen always told them that they were better off without men like that, and that better men awaited them. Hypocrite. Fattie. She looked at the clock. Ten after seven. The lecture! Holy shit!\n\nÂ«Â« Â»Â» \"Isn't it wonderful?\" the group president elated. She was an elderly, pale woman, quite misdressed in a shiny black evening gown. Kathleen sat with her in the back of the auditorium, at a table where tickets were sold. \"We sold over 200 non member tickets tonight,\" the older woman said. Kathleen had arrived late. Thank God there's a speaker before me. A voice echoed hollowly, amplified through the PA system. Rows and rows of people in chairs faced a long draped stage. The first speaker, a long haired blond man, looked tiny behind the distant podium. \"He must be pretty well known,\" Kathleen remarked, noting the packed auditorium. There must be 300 people here tonight, she realized. \"Who? Platt?\" the older woman said. \"Oh, no. He's just a local poet. Usually we don't even sell 50 non member tickets. All these people, Ms. Shade, are here to see you.\" Kathleen felt remotely flattered. She'd spoken at writers groups before but never to a crowd this large. Had all these people really come just to see her? \"He'll be done in a minute,\" the older woman said. The voice echoed on. Kathleen fidgeted. I hope I don't smell, she fretted. She'd skipped showering. She'd fixed her hair as best she could and had jumped in her car. She couldn't imagine how embarrassed she'd have been if she hadn't made it. She looked on, over a plethora of heads. The poet, whose name was Maxwell Platt, had read several poems and then broke into a commentary about the function of aesthetics. \"...and I can think of no better way that humanity defines itself than through its art. All art really is, after all, is the decryption of our feelings and our views into creative terms, and poetry, the ultimate art form, best discharges this function. Where would we be without it? Where would we be a million years from now when our ruins are discovered and all we have to show for our existence are sitcoms and Schwartzenegger movies? I thank God we have better than that. We have Shelley and Stevens and Pound. We have Owens and T.S. Eliot. We have Shakespeare. But more important than that, we have you. We have all of us, mindful people in chaotic times, the new poets of the new dark age...\" This sounded insightful, but the words kept shifting away. Kathleen scarcely knew what she would talk about when her turn came. These people had paid money to hear her talk. What am I going to give them back? she thought.\n\nNow Platt was saying, \"...and I'd like to finish by reading you my latest. It's called â€˜Exit.'\" The crowd hushed. Kathleen was thinking about the dream. She was thinking about the killer, and the things Spence had said... Platt began, \"Cenote or ziggurat, so shall it be, to end this riven hatred which beckons me, like torture into the light of the past. The dreams of some are the nightmares of others, blessings assigned or black lots cast, in the most wretched adieu. I glimpsed the light, the light went out. All my dreams come true.\" Dreams, Kathleen thought. Applause rose. Platt smiled behind the long blond hair that hung in his face. He held up a finger and said into the microphone: \"Thank you all very much. And let me add one more thing... We are all the progeny of creation. I bid you to create.\" Kathleen's heart fluttered. It's my turn now, she thought as the older woman said at the same time, \"It's your turn now.\" The poet came off the stage as the applause subsided. I must look fatter than Roseanne in this dress, Kathleen feared. The lavender crepe swished behind her as she followed the older woman up. She sensed her heels on the waxed wood sounded like mallets pounding. The older woman tapped the microphone, a formality. \"It's my great pleasure,\" she said, \"to introduce our next guest, the renowned columnist from '90s Woman, Ms. Kathleen Shade.\" Kathleen addressed the podium. The applause deafened her and seemed to go on and on her propped up smile made her feel like Arsenio Hall. Stop clapping! she thought. Let me start, even though I haven't got the slightest idea what I'm going to talk about. She felt sorry for the poet; he'd received only half the applause. When they finally died down, Kathleen began, \"I'm grateful for the opportunity to be here tonight \" At the edges of her vision, though, at the back of the auditorium, she noticed two men in suits standing by the door. Another similarly dressed man stood at the forward entrance, arms crossed as if bored. Kathleen began her talk, which occurred to her somewhat unconsciously. Words flowed from her lips without her really hearing them. The crowd stared up raptly. \"Feminism has evolved in many unique ways over the past decade,\" she was saying, \"and what I'd like to talk about tonight, among other things, are the ways in which we, as critical writers, can assert...\" And while she was talking, her eyes drifted across the crowd, and there, sitting in the middle of the front row, was Spence.\n\n(II) She's thinking of blood. She's thinking of cutting off skin. Don't go in. You shouldn't go in. Her mother's a ghost. Her mother sits beside her in the little car. She's waiting in the lot for 7:30, to go in and see with her own eyes, the Great Woman, when her mother says, Don't go in. \"But why?\" They could catch you. Her eyes want to explode. Sometimes she just doesn't think. \"I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.\" That's all right, honey. Her mother dissolves. For a moment she wants to cry. The sun is an orange, bright ball creeping past the edge of the city. She presses a fingernail into her palm until blood comes out. Then she feels better. No, she mustn't go in. She's about to back out of the parking lot, which is full of cars all coming to see the Great Woman. It's 8:15 now. A big car whips into the lot. A big black Ford Thunderbird. The Great Woman is late. She watches the Great Woman get out in a fluffy lavender dress and rush toward the pillared\n\nbuilding. She writes down the tag number and leaves. Bright lights buzz over her head. Tiles shine. She hears screaming. A man screaming. It's a sweet sound. It makes her want to go to the custodial closet and touch herself. On her way to work, she drove past The Cross. She sees The Cross now, in her head. The screaming lets her see The Cross. The body on the crash table convulses under the bright lights. A black man. Multiple knife wounds to the throat. \"Cut down!\" one doctor yells. \"Stat!\" \"Clamp it!\" yells another. People yell in the ER a lot. The black man's feet kick. Blood flies across one doctor's face as if shot from a squirt gun. Another squirt hits him right in the eye, like Daddy. Her head lightens. The image: licking the blood off and sliding an Arista #24 scalpel up his crotch at the same time. Several times a month she sneaks into the prep station at night to watch the charge nurse fucking one of the interns. The nurse is on her belly, her white skirt pulled up and her white pantyhose off, on a transport gurney with the rails down gritting her big white teeth in a mindless grin. The intern always slaps her big flabby buttocks as his hips thrust. She always fantasizes sneaking up behind them and snipping off the intern's testicles while he fucks the fat nurse, with something nice, like Westcott umbilical scissors, or the shiny Bruns serrated plaster shears.\n\nBut it's only a fantasy. Instead she sneaks away because this is the best time to steal, while the charge nurse is busy fucking the intern. The other nurses are on their bed checks so she can go into the supply room and take what she needs. She can also go into the med station for pharmaceuticals of lower control classifications. The barbiturates like diazepam and Amytal, and the amphetamines like Desoxyn and methamphetamine HCL are strictly controlled and inventoried, so she can't steal those. She gets those instead during the post ops in the ER where things are always very hectic and everybody's going in different directions. She takes what she steals out in a gym bag since all custodial personnel are required to bring a complete change of clothes every shift in case someone throws up on them or bleeds on them. She steals all kinds of neat things. Tissue forceps, hemostats, brain spatulas, rib cutters, disposable S,K,&F packaged tourniquets. The ER doctors disperse, snapping off their gloves, when the black man dies. She leans over to wring a clean mop. Pine smelling water spurtles through plastic holes. Her vagina hurts. She smiles at the truth of the pain. She sees The Cross. When they've all left the ER cove, she starts to mop up all the beautiful blood. | | Chapter 6 (I) Was Spence smiling? His blatant, arrogant blank face seemed to mock Kathleen throughout her speech. It provided a distraction she didn't need. Maintaining eye contact with the audience was important during a lecture, yet as she spoke, and wherever she looked, she could feel the cold police face gaze on her.\n\nShe was so mad she wanted to shriek. Her speech seemed to go well, however. She began with a short biography of her life and credentials leaving out, of course, Uncle Sammy and then she spent the rest of her time proposing insights and speculations about the woman's market in general and the new feminist philosophies in particular. Psycho social dynamics, counter subjugation, interpersonal domestic designs of the '90s, etc. When she was done, the auditorium tremored with applause. Several women actually asked her for an autograph. The older woman, who turned out to be the treasurer of the writer's group, gushed gratitude, as did many of the group's other officers. Then things began to thin out. \"I thought you gave an excellent talk,\" a male voice came up along her side. It was Maxwell Platt, the poet. He had dressed neatly in jeans, a midnight purple shirt, and a black tie. \"Thank you,\" Kathleen said. \"So did you.\" \"I read your magazine regularly. It's much more diverse than a lot of the others, and much less sexist.\" Kathleen wasn't sure what he meant by that last clause. She lit her hourly cigarette, which by now she was dying for. \"That's a little unusual, isn't it? I mean, a man reading a women's magazine?\" \"Why?\" Platt said. \"What better channel can men have to the feminine mystique?\" Kathleen could've laughed. She hadn't heard that term in years. She was about to ask him about his poetry when another, less welcome voice rose at her other side. \"You are an absolute hallmark of civil irresponsibility.\" She knew it was Spence before she even saw that blank, arrogant face of his. She could feel his bulk shadow. \"I'm not surprised,\" she said, \"that I have no idea what you're talking about.\" Spence smirked stolidly. \"I can't believe your incognizance. A public speaking engagement. An advertised public speaking engagement. And you didn't even tell us.\" \"Why on earth would I tell you?\" Kathleen sucked her cigarette, hoping the kick of nicotine might quell her rage. \"Am I supposed to notify you every time I go somewhere? To the library? The mall? The toilet?\"\n\n\"Fortunately I caught the announcement in BookWorld \" \"Oh, you read?\" Kathleen interrupted. \" and was able to get some men down here.\" \"Why?\" Kathleen asked. \"What's the big deal?\" \"The big deal is \" Spence lowered his voice, honed his glare \" there's a certain person who's taken quite an interest in you. And that person could very easily have seen one of the advertisements for this little talk of yours. In other words, that person could be here right now.\" Kathleen opened her mouth, then closed it. She hadn't thought of that at all. Had the killer attended the lecture? But then she dismissed it, if only to save face. \"That's ridiculous, like everything else I've heard you say...\" And then her rebuttal trailed off. Past Spence's shoulder she saw some of the men in suits at the back of the auditorium questioning five or six women with red hair. \"You've got to be kidding me. You're harassing women just because of their hair color?\" \"We're following a normal investigative protocol,\" Spence said. \"And the next time you decide to give a lecture open to public, you will notify me first. At least then we'll be able to give you some protection.\" Protection, she thought. Is that what she needed? Did they actually think that this woman might try to kill her? Spence adjusted his tie for no apparent reason. At least he dressed well. \"Have you had any further contact with our friend?\" he asked. \"No. I only get a carrier from my editor once a week.\" \"What about the normal mail channels?\" \"I'm unlisted. So don't worry.\" \"Oh, but I am worrying. Your obliviousness amazes me, as does your outright refusal to acknowledge the gravity of this matter. And, by the way, I thought your lecture was heinously biased, unrealistic, self serving, and ideologically useless.\" Spence let his stare soak a moment. Then he added, \"I'll be in touch.\" Eat shit, Kathleen thought. She winced at him as if shooting a gun. She would have liked to kick\n\nhim in the pants as he strode toward the back of the auditorium to further his harassment of the red haired women. What nerve, she thought. \"Wow,\" Platt remarked. \"What was that all about?\" \"Long story,\" she excused. What could she say? Well, you see, the other day a female killer mailed me a severed penis, and that guy is the cop investigating the case. And he doesn't like me because I happen to be a woman. She felt like a dissident in some totalitarian regime, shadowed by policemen. Spence's audacity was outrageous, unconscionable. \"You want to go somewhere and have a drink?\" Platt said. Kathleen wasn't sure if he wanted to have a drink with her or just wanted a ride home; Platt didn't have a car. She didn't care, though. The innocuous talk helped get her mind off Spence, and she found something comfortable about chatting idly with another writer, despite how little they had in common creatively. She drove downtown in somewhat of a daze; then they were sitting in a bar. But only after her first drink did she realize exactly what bar it was. Jonah and the Whale, the same bar where Stephen W. Calabrice had made the last pickup of his life. \"I kind of lied,\" she admitted. \"I didn't really hear much of your talk; I was really late. But I liked your poem.\" \"I've written better,\" Platt said, \"and I've written worse, a lot worse. Poetry's weird; it never succeeds unless the poet realizes its utter failure.\" \"That sounds like something a poet would say.\" She sipped her Cardinal. Platt on the other hand ordered the cheapest beer they had on tap, which seemed appropriate for a poet. \"I guess none of us succeed as real people,\" she theorized, \"unless we realize all our own failures.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well, like your poem, â€˜Exit.' It was about failure. It was an acknowledgment of your failure with a woman.\" Platt nearly spat out his beer. \"How did you I mean, what makes you think that?\" Did I touch a nerve? Kathleen hadn't meant to. \"I only assumed... That's not what the poem was about?\" \"That's another thing about poetry. It's about whatever the reader perceives it as being about.\"\n\nYeah, I touched a nerve, she thought. The first drink went frightfully fast. Platt was nursing his; he mustn't have much money. The bar seemed fairly full for a week night: legs flashing beneath sleek dresses, guys in expensive suits checking the time to deliberately show off their Rolexes. Mecca of Yuppies. Her thoughts felt split like logs. She ordered another drink, chatting and thinking. Then she ordered another drink. Music droned: some dismal song by The Cure. \"Do you make a living writing poetry?\" she asked. Platt threw his head back and laughed, a bit too loudly. \"I teach a couple classes at GW. There's no money in poetry but that's how it's supposed to be. It wouldn't be real if you got paid for it. Whenever I get offered money for a poem, I send the check back. If it was an article, or an expository piece, that would be different; I'd take money for that.\" Platt sipped his beer. \"This may sound corny, but poetry comes from my heart. And my heart is not for sale.\" It didn't sound corny only because of the indifference with which he'd made the statement. At least he has convictions, Kathleen thought. She wondered what her own convictions were and couldn't think of any. My hormones are skewed tonight. Images and thoughts sideswiped her; she listened to Platt but often didn't hear him over her own ponderings. The music and the voices and bodies around them coalesced to gentle chaos. The macabre question titillated her: Exactly what had the killer done to Stephen W. Calabrice? Spence said he'd been tortured. \"What?\" she said. \"I said you should order some food.\" \"Not hungry.\" She'd ordered another Cardinal without really realizing it. Platt's suggestion was a polite reminder as to how much alcohol she'd consumed. I'm not drunk, am I? she thought. She almost never drank to excess; getting drunk made her feel stupid. She often found a silly joy in watching others get drunk in bars. They knew they'd get drunk, they knew they'd make asses of themselves eventually, yet they continued to drink. \"Have you ever thought,\" she said to Platt (and for the life of her she couldn't remember his first name), \"about the actual social symptomatology of drinking? It's absurd. It's like bars are places where people go because it's acceptable to make jackasses of themselves.\" \"I've, uh, I never thought of it that way,\" Platt said with a brow tightening. \"I mean, look at this. People would never act like this in other public places, would they?\" Behind them, three young guys in baggy Dockers laughed uproariously. One of them chugged a full bottle of dark brown beer in less than 15 seconds. At another table, two girls giggled as their dates conversed loudly about their jobs. A girl at the end of the bar shouted to the barkeep, \"Hey, Craig, can I have your kids?\" It was an arena of silliness. An overdressed dolt with a face like\n\nChris Isaak squeezed next to her and ordered a Stoplight shooter as his friends cheered him on. Chaos, Kathleen thought. \"I guess we better go,\" Platt said. \"Why?\" \"You seem pretty bored.\" \"I'm sorry,\" she said. He must think she didn't like him. \"I'm not bored, I'm thinking. I have this habit of thinking about lots of things at once.\" Platt at last ordered a second beer. \"What are you thinking about?\" \"I... Well...\" But what was she thinking about? She scanned the long bar for redheads. She wondered where the killer had sat, what she'd worn, what type of drinks she'd had. What had Stephen W. Calabrice's last drink on earth been? I hope it was a good one, she thought. Eventually, she answered Platt, as more overdressed patrons squeezed past, \"A project.\" \"You mean a writing project?\" \"Yeah.\" She caught Platt's brow ticking again when she ordered another Cardinal. \"You're a writer. Have you ever considered writing a book?\" Finally she'd given him something to talk about. \"Oh, sure,\" he said. \"I'm always toying with the idea of writing a novel, but I know I never will. I prefer poetry. It seems to me I mean for my own creative purposes that even the best novel can never be more truthful creatively than a poem. You never know what your motives are with a novel.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Is the novel motivated by money, by status, or by aesthetics? You never know,\" he said. \"Why can't it be all three?\" \"Well, it can, but that doesn't appeal to me. I know a lot of novelists, and most of them are just prostitutes. Soon they're writing books based on the needs of the market instead of the needs of their muse.\" Kathleen thought about that. These were more of Platt's convictions. She remembered what Spence had implied at the police station: that she was looking to sensationalize a tragedy. That\n\nwasn't it at all. Maybe she just wanted something to do. \"What about you?\" Platt asked. \"Are you considering writing a novel?\" \"I'm not sure if it's a novel. It might be, or it might not be, or it might be something in between.\" The Cardinal was making her buzz a little. \"All I know is that it will be a book.\" \"What's the book going to be about?\" \"A killer,\" she said. She sipped the rich drink, closed her eyes. \"It's about a female psycho killer.\" | | Chapter 7 (I) When Kathleen woke, at about 6 a.m., she had to pressure her brain to give up the memory. Where am I? she thought at first, and then the headache reminded her. She lay seeping with sweat; Platt's apartment, an efficiency off of P Street, was not air conditioned. Morning light poured in from the balcony as if caught off guard, Kathleen quickly pulled the sheet up over her. Platt lay asleep beside her. You bad girl, Kathleen. What would the radio shrink say about this? That she'd gotten drunk on purpose as a ploy to sleep with Platt? And we did more than sleep, she reminded herself. Extended periods of inactivity in your sex life, the radio shrink would say, have imbued rigid feelings of self doubt. Not having sex makes you feel unwanted. In becoming intoxicated, you have manufactured a situation which will increase the potential of a sexual encounter. Is that what I did? she wondered now. She only vaguely recalled Platt's insistence that she not drive home. \"You're too drunk,\" he'd said. \"I'll call you a cab, or I'll drive us in your car back to my place. I'll sleep on the couch.\" Platt had not taken advantage of her by any means. Kathleen supposed the opposite, that she took advantage of him. She took a cold shower, checked herself to see that her period had stopped. Her pubic hair looked a little straggly so she stood there ludicrously over the toilet trimming at it with a little pair of scissors she found in the cabinet. It was all so calculated that she scarcely believed it of herself. He was lying on the couch, as promised, under a sheet, when she emerged wrapped in a towel. A small lamp glowed; he was reading a book of Anne Sexton poems called The Death Notebooks. For a moment his long straight blond hair made him look girlish. Maybe he's gay, she considered.\n\nP Street and Dupont was certainly a gay area. But the poem he'd read was about a girl; she felt certain of that. He looked up at her then and said, \"The bed's right over th \" \"I'd rather sleep here,\" she said. She turned off the light, let the towel fall, and climbed on top of him, squeezing Anne Sexton between their chests as they kissed. At first Platt was stifled, not quite sure what to make of this. In the dark she felt completely unrestrained; she felt like someone else, someone she was watching in a dirty movie, or someone people gossiped about. She knelt beside the couch, pulled the sheet off, pulled off his briefs. His skin felt smooth and cool as she ran her hands up and down his right side. She let her hands be her eyes in the dark, and was content by what she saw. No, he's not gay, she concluded; his penis average length, thin, and uncircumcised had already become erect before she even touched it. She squeezed it gently; Platt stifled a moan. I have a man's penis in my hand, she realized, and I don't even remember his first name! How embarrassing. She leaned over and began to fellate him; he stifled another moan. She let her tongue glaze over the glans, wiping away small drops of salty, precursory fluid. His hand slid up and down her back as his legs stiffened. \"Kathleen,\" he whispered. \"You better stop. I'm getting ready.\" At least he's a gentleman, she thought. She didn't care; in fact, she was flattered, remembering the old joke about a man's three biggest lies: I love you, I was just about to call, and I promise not to come in your mouth. His testicles, caged in her fingers, drew up. She noticed with some fascination that the right one drew up farther than the left, and that it was minutely larger. Her mouth sucked harder, increasing the wet friction, and there he went again, whispering in panic, \"Kathleen, Kathleen...\" \"Um hmm,\" was all the reply she was able to make at the moment. She could sense with her lips a nervous throbbing building up. When he began to ejaculate, she squeezed his testicles; the right one by now had all but constricted into his groin. She'd only done this a few times before. I hope I'm doing it right. Is it the same for men? Even her own past could attest: of the times when men had gone down on her not many times there were an array of ways to do it wrong. You practically had to read off a list of guidelines. She flinched at the first few spurts which launched to the back of her throat. His fingers ranged in her shower wet hair. When she was done, she let the fair volume of semen fall out of her mouth onto his stomach. \"Let's get you cleaned up,\" she said. She felt around in the dark for a Kleenex but found none. Would it be rude to wipe him off with his sheet? Maybe I should have swallowed it, she thought, but she really didn't want to do that. \"There's no tissues here,\" he said, and suddenly there was a tearing sound. Kathleen laughed. \"It that how poets smite each other?\" she asked. \"Actually,\" he said, \"it's sort of an esoteric compliment. I wouldn't consider it an insult at all, creation merging with creation.\" He wiped himself off with a page he'd ripped out of the Anne Sexton book. He brought her to her feet in the dark. She was glad for the dark he couldn't see her fat. She felt deliciously hot in the un air conditioned apartment. \"Come on,\" he said, leading her toward the bed. \"The condoms are over here.\"\n\nÂ«Â« Â»Â» After another cool shower, she sneaked around the efficiency, draped in the sheet from the couch. Platt snored slightly, brazenly naked on the bed. Nearly as brazenly herself, she stepped onto the balcony in the dawn light and smoked a cigarette. Below stretched an ugly pay parking lot beside P Street. The man in the booth looked like Uncle Sammy until she blinked and saw that he was black. Another man walking briskly down the street with a briefcase looked like Uncle Sammy too. She blinked him away. Retrograde shock jags, the counselor had called them. Not hallucinations but tricks of memory. She hadn't had them in years. Why now? What's Sam doing now? she asked herself. Masturbating in his cell? Thinking of me? she wondered. Then she thought about the killer, who, according to the all knowing Lieutenant Spence, had also been sexually abused. Who had abused the killer? And how? At what age and how many times? She would have to know all these things for the book. And if the killer never wrote to her again, there'd be no book. Spence's threat loomed: \"Do not tamper with evidence.\" She made a mental note: Call New York, ask about mail. Back inside, she perused Platt's work space, which was much less organized than her own. A little Brother electric typewriter sat on a big desk with a fake woodgrain top. A piece of paper hung out of the platen like a tongue. Creative people often had quirks. Weird superstitions about new work. Territorialism. Was she violating some poetic law by looking? But Platt remained asleep, now curled into a naked ball. On the paper, he'd typed: EXIT by Maxwell Platt Maxwell! Kathleen celebrated. Now at least she knew his first name. But hadn't \"Exit\" been the title of the poem he'd read at the writers lecture? This was different. Through twilit nights my love still soars. I am forever and ineffably yours. One the desk rested a manila folder. Dare I? she thought. She had no right to look at his work without his permission. She looked at it anyway; poets intrigued her, especially poets who gave her orgasms. The first poem in the folder read, again: EXIT by Maxwell Platt\n\nDid he title all his poems \"Exit?\" An exit fixation, she thought. Like my killer fixation. The poem, dated December 12, 1990, read: Ah, love it leaves us bleakly blessed, either that or sweetly cursed. I watch you take your heart from me, you watch my heart burst. But upon this night, exactly one year ago, I remember: you and I were kissing in the snow. Kathleen closed the folder. She felt ashamed, even though Platt would never know. My God, she thought when she looked down. Leaning against the corner of his work area stood a stack of publications, four feet high: magazines, newspapers, trade sized digests, small press and literary journals all the places Platt had been published. It was literally a pillar of poetry. She picked up the top magazine, The Annapolis Critique, and thumbed the contents. EXIT by Maxwell Platt... page 8 Yet another poem called \"Exit.\" This began to fascinate her. She turned to page 8 and read: I always got less than the least from you. Now I hope that the rats come and feast on you. Platt the altruist finally shows some bitterness. Yes, it was obvious to her: these poems were about women from Platt's past; he was a love poet. This seemed totally real to her, totally honest, not corny. Too much of today's poetry dismissed love as a trifle. They deemed it more \"important\" to write about politics or nuclear weapons. But such a bitter poem, she thought. Bitterness didn't seem to suit Platt. As for herself, when men had stopped seeing her, or stopped calling, Kathleen never felt bitter. She felt fat and disillusioned but never bitter. Or maybe she'd never loved anyone enough to feel bitter over a relationship's demise.\n\nBut this is just sexual, she pointed out to herself. Platt, though not a physical specimen, looked trim and enticing. There's no way he could ever love a Fattie like me. This impression of herself did not depress her at all; it made her feel proudly objective, not weighing, of course, the hypocrisy. When readers wrote in, fearing rejection due to being overweight, Kathleen reassured them that looks meant nothing in a real relationship. Dump them, she'd advise. Still draped in the sheet, like a disheveled statute of liberty, she padded to the bed to look down at Platt. Every few minutes he shifted positions in sleep. Now he lay arms out and spread legged on the mattress, his face covered by blond hair. Her headache was dissolving. Should I just leave? she wondered. She really did want to call her editor and ask if any letters had come in for her. On the floor lay three condoms tied in knots, their reservoir ends laden with proof that Platt could rise to an occasion. Her memory unreeled like clippings of film: he'd made love to her voraciously, constantly concerned for her pleasure. It got to aggravate her to a point. He'd ask her \"which way feels the best for you?\" or \"does it feel better this way or that way?\" She felt like saying, Look, Platt, I haven't been laid in a year. Any way feels good, so be quiet and just do it. She'd had several bouts of orgasms, but the best came when he finished her off. He'd slid her buttocks to the edge of the bed and knelt on the floor, laving her clitoris with his tongue while two fingers stroked in and out of her vagina. She'd shrieked as her climax spasmed, then purred grinning in the dark as the lovely pulses drew on. Platt kept his condoms a brand called Sheik in an odd little cup with a hinged lid atop the nightstand. She took one and very carefully crouched at his hips. The deflated penis lay across his pubic patch like something exhausted. She touched its underside very gently she didn't want to wake him then leaned forward and began to lick it. She could smell her own musk laced with the scent of the condom lubricant and sperm. It came erect fast as a spring popping. She rolled the condom over it, then shook him. \"Maxwell?\" she said. Or did he prefer to be called Max? How do I know? \"Maxwell? Wake up.\" She leaned up and kissed him on the mouth as his eyes slowly opened. Her fingers gently kneaded the sheathed penis. \"Maxwell? I have to go soon.\" \"Hmm?\" he said. \"I have to go home soon. But can we do it one more time first?\" He leaned up and groggily glanced down at his groin. \"It looks like the decision has already been made,\" he remarked.\n\n(II) Earlier that morning at the CES morgue, Kohls told Spence, \"What we've got here, Lieutenant, is a little of the old Human Jigsaw.\" Spence was familiar with the jargon; he'd seen stuff like this before. This was what crack dealers did to stools, or other dealers moving on the wrong turf. Bodies taken apart with chainsaws or axes. Parts often stacked up like cordwood. Kohls, the MCS evidence tech, had lain the body parts found in the Audi's trunk onto three stainless steel dissection tables. The tables came complete with run off gutters and filter traps. \"Three bodies,\" he said. \"We'll call them One, Two, and Three. One\" he pointed \"has been dead about a week according to the potass levels in the humor. Two and Three several weeks, maybe a month. T.O.D. is always tough to pinpoint this time of year, the heat and all. Depends on where the parts were kept.\" \"Where are the heads?\" Spence asked. \"In the fridge. You want to see them?\" \"Uh, no. All I want from you now is the quickest read you can give me. I want any significant similarities and differe"
