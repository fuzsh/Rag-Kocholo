The data and areas of interest covered are intentionally broad, ranging from the trends relating to sharing across the travel, retail, food and apparel industries, to emerging technology, to an in-depth look at the major for-profit firms (which we call “THE SHARING & GIG ECONOMY 150”) within the many industry sectors that make up the sharing, gig economy and on-demand arena. This reference book is designed to be a general source for researchers. It is especially intended to assist with market research, strategic planning, employment searches, contact or prospect list creation and financial research, and as a data resource for executives and students of all types. PLUNKETT’S SHARING & GIG ECONOMY, FREELANCE WORKERS & ON-DEMAND DELIVERY INDUSTRY ALMANAC takes a rounded approach for the general reader. This book presents a complete overview of the entire sharing and gig economy industry (see “How To Use This Book”). For example, you will find trends in the hotel room, car, bicycle and aircraft sharing markets, along\n\nwith easy-to-use charts and tables on all facets of sharing, gig economy and on-demand services in general, from the sales and profits of the providers to projected growth in the industry. THE SHARING & GIG ECONOMY 150 is our unique grouping of the biggest, most successful corporations in all segments of the sharing & gig industry, including housing, transportation, food, apparel and related services. Tens of thousands of pieces of information, gathered from a wide variety of sources, have been researched and are presented in a unique form that can be easily understood. This section includes thorough indexes to THE SHARING & GIG ECONOMY 150, by geography, industry, sales, brand names, subsidiary names and many other topics. (See Chapter 4.) Especially helpful is the way in which PLUNKETT’S SHARING & GIG ECONOMY, FREELANCE WORKERS & ON-DEMAND DELIVERY INDUSTRY ALMANAC enables readers who have no business background to readily compare the financial records and growth plans of large sharing and gig economy companies and major industry groups. You’ll see the mid-term financial record of each firm, along with the impact of earnings, sales and strategic plans on each company’s potential to fuel growth, to serve new markets and to provide investment and employment opportunities.\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nNo other source provides this book’s easy-tounderstand comparisons of growth, expenditures, technologies, corporations and many other items of great importance to people of all types who may be studying this, one of the fastest growing industries in the world today.\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\naffiliations, divisions and activities within a firm’s corporate structure. •\n\nThis volume is intended to be a general guide to a quickly evolving industry. That means that researchers should look to this book for an overview and, when conducting in-depth research, should contact the specific corporations or industry associations in question for the very latest changes and data. Where possible, we have listed contact names, toll-free telephone numbers and internet site addresses for the companies, government agencies and industry associations involved so that the reader may get further details without unnecessary delay.\n\nIn addition to individual company profiles, an overview of sharing and gig economy markets and trends is provided. This book’s job is to help you sort through easy-to-understand summaries of today’s trends in a quick and effective manner.\n\n•\n\nTables of industry data and statistics used in this book include the latest numbers available at the time of printing, generally through the end of 2021. In a few cases, the only complete data available was for earlier years.\n\nWhatever your purpose for researching the sharing and gig economy field, you’ll find this book to be a valuable guide. Nonetheless, as is true with all resources, this volume has limitations that the reader should be aware of:\n\n•\n\nWe have used exhaustive efforts to locate and fairly present accurate and complete data. However, when using this book or any other source for business and industry information, the reader should use caution and diligence by conducting further research where it seems appropriate. We wish you success in your endeavors, and we trust that your experience with this book will be both satisfactory and productive.\n\nBy scanning the data groups and the unique indexes, you can find the best information to fit your personal research needs. The major companies in the sharing and gig economy field are profiled and then ranked using several different groups of specific criteria. Which firms are the biggest employers? Which companies earn the most profits? These things and much more are easy to find.\n\n•\n\nFinancial data and other corporate information can change quickly. A book of this type can be no more current than the data that was available as of the time of editing. Consequently, the financial picture, management and ownership of the firm(s) you are studying may have changed since the date of this book. For example, this almanac includes the most up-to-date sales figures and profits available to the editors as of late 2022. That means that we have typically used corporate financial data as of the end of 2021.\n\n•\n\nCorporate mergers, acquisitions and downsizing are occurring at a very rapid rate. Such events may have created significant change, subsequent to the publishing of this book, within a company you are studying.\n\n•\n\nSome of the companies in THE SHARING & GIG ECONOMY 150 are so large in scope and in variety of business endeavors conducted within a parent organization, that we have been unable to completely list all subsidiaries,\n\nJack W. Plunkett Houston, Texas February 2023\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\n\nThe two primary sections of this book are devoted first to the automotive industry as a whole and then to the “Individual Data Listings” for THE SHARING & GIG ECONOMY 150. If time permits, you should begin your research in the front chapters of this book. Also, you will find lengthy indexes in Chapter 4 and in the back of the book.

However, we have indicated what our best efforts reveal to be the apparent number of women who either are in the posts of corporate officers or sit on the board of directors. There is a wide variance from company to company. Hot Spot for Advancement for Women/Minorities: A “Y” in appropriate fields indicates “Yes.” These are firms that appear either to have posted a substantial number of women and/or minorities to high posts or that appear to have a good record of going out of their way to recruit, train, promote and retain women or minorities. (See the Index of Hot Spots For Women and Minorities in the back of the book.) This information may change frequently and can be difficult to obtain and verify.

A sometimesmisunderstood term, the “sharing economy” is a system of peer-to-peer services, exchanges or rentals facilitated through a digital intermediary (a platform dedicated to helping consumers find and purchase specific services). Often associated with the ridesharing company Uber, many goods and services can be provided through similar platforms, such as\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\ndelivery of restaurant meals; grocery shopping and delivery; personal assistants (such as dog walkers); specialty contractors (such as TaskRabbit workers who will assemble IKEA furniture); and internetbased scheduling of everything from restaurant reservations to heavy equipment rentals. Plunkett Research estimates the size of the global sharing economy at $280 billion for 2022. There were mixed results for this sector due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Ride-sharing companies saw plummeting revenues because of the shelter-athome, work-from home environment. Likewise, accommodation-sharing platforms such as Airbnb and Vrbo saw large drops in revenues at first, while people were in shelter-at-home mode, but later saw business return as travelers sought options to hotels. At the same time, meal and grocery delivery services like GrubHub and Instacart soared—they were the perfect answer to closed restaurants and COVIDconscious consumers. Closely intertwined with the sharing economy is the expansion of “gig” and freelance work. While such short-term or one-time (“contingent”) work arrangements are not new, today’s digital platforms enable a far greater number of people who desire gig or freelance work to connect with consumers and businesses that want to hire them. These platforms allow increased access to services and workers in ways never seen before. This segment is often referred to as the “gig economy.” The sharing and gig economy is a truly disruptive development that was enabled through the rapid, worldwide deployment of the smartphone and through the ease of development of massive webbased services via databases and other systems hosted in the cloud. The nature of this industry is disruptive because the sharing economy offers very advanced solutions to everyday problems, saving time and effort for consumers, and often saving costs and creating efficiencies in the process, whether it’s the ability to let graphic designers bid on a small job for a business, the ease of getting a restaurant meal ordered and delivered to the home or the convenience of getting a ride from an airport to a hotel. Examples of how the Sharing and Gig Economy is Disrupting Business and Industry: a. The traditional taxi business has been literally overwhelmed by competition from ride-hailing services such as Didi, Uber and Lyft. Taxi service, particularly in the United States, can be incredibly frustrating—there is nothing worse than waiting in the rain for an empty taxi to\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nd.\n\ne.\n\ncruise by. In contrast, platforms like Uber have given consumers the power to hail a ride from their smartphones, watch on a digital map as the vehicle nears the pickup destination, and pay seamlessly via a saved credit card or other payment option such as PayPal once the ride is completed. This is such an advancement that the world’s largest automobile manufacturers are now planning for the day when a massive segment of global consumers will opt to use ridehailing as their everyday transportation, declining to purchase and own personal automobiles. A new descriptor has been coined to describe this trend: “mobility services.” In the near future, self-driving vehicles will boost this trend. Meanwhile, bicycle-sharing platforms, particularly the massive networks in China, are offering a highly popular mode of convenient, inexpensive, instant urban transportation for millions of consumers daily who are willing to pedal a bike. This is a global trend. Equally frustrating to many consumers is the task of assembling furniture and cabinetry purchased in-the-box from retailers like Ikea. TaskRabbit will send a highly experienced agent to your home to quickly assemble that new purchase for you in a cost-effective manner. This is so vital an idea that Ikea acquired TaskRabbit. While shopping online via ecommerce and then awaiting your purchase to be delivered via UPS or a similar courier or freight service is rapidly gaining global market share over traditional store-front retailing, there is still immense demand for items that will be used in the home on the same day as ordered. Groceries are the perfect example. Thus, shopping/rapid delivery services such as Instacart are changing the face the grocery industry. Instacart will let you select items that you want from your favorite store, send an agent to do the shopping or the pickup, and then deliver the goods promptly to your home. This is such a breakthrough idea that giant U.S. retailer Target acquired Instacart competitor Shipt, U.S. supermarket chain Kroger launched its own delivery service and a large number of the world’s largest retailers have or will run their own delivery services. Amazon is a global leader in this regard with its same-day delivery (Amazon Fresh”) of groceries and other staples. Traditionally, the provision of hotel rooms and other overnight accommodations was managed by hotel, motel and resort companies, with minor market share going to inns, bed and breakfasts,\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nf.\n\n2)\n\nand long-term furnished-apartment firms. The sharing economy has turned the hospitality industry in an entirely new direction as Airbnb makes millions of rooms, flats and houses available for nightly rental worldwide, and services like Vrbo and Onefinestay specialize in booking travelers into any of millions of vacation homes, condos and urban apartments. Suddenly, travelers can benefit from short-term rental of fully furnished and equipped accommodations, often with features such as multiple bedrooms and baths, laundry facilities and kitchens, and sometimes with fabulous views, swimming pools or gardens. A U.S.-based firm called Rent the Runway grew quickly with its unique business model. This company rents clothing, shoes and accessories, focused on fashion-conscious women. Consumers choose what they want to wear online, and the company ships the items promptly via UPS. When the short-term rental is over, the customer simply puts the item into a special shipping bag and drops it off at a UPS store for easy return. Back at the company, the item is cleaned and restocked to the rental inventory. In fact, the firm has turned into the world’s largest dry-cleaning operation.\n\nThe Coronavirus’ Effect on the Sharing & Gig Economy As with many business sectors, the Coronavirus had a profound effect on the sharing and gig economy, both negative and positive. On the negative side, early shelter-at-home mandates devastated on-demand ride services such as Uber and Lyft, as well as shared workspaces. On the positive side, online ordering and home delivery for groceries as well as prepared meal services skyrocketed. While the early months of the Coronavirus saw plummeting demand for travel and for accommodations, short-term home rental sites such as Vrbo soon found booming business among travelers who wanted to avoid hotels once the shelter-at-home restrictions were relaxed. Travelers were often booking properties close to home and traveling with family members rather than friends. Meanwhile, soaring numbers of travelers with means were soon flying privately, especially through charters and fractional ownership. Massachusettsbased Sentient Jets (www.sentient.com) reported that 50% of its business in June 2020 was first-time customers, up 127% over 2019. NetJets\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\n(www.netjets.com) reported its best month for new customer business since 2007. The onset of the Coronavirus pandemic rocked the car sharing industry, undermining ridership as people stayed home. With the gradual reopening of many businesses, Uber and Lyft later saw an uptick in ridership under stringent new safety and cleanliness policies, but they nonetheless had very disappointing revenues. With regard to online grocery shopping, the virus escalated the practice exponentially. Data analytics firm Inmar found in a recent poll that 78.7% of respondents shopped online for groceries after the pandemic outbreak, up from 39% before. This was a boon for companies such as Instacart and Amazon, and it spurred virtually all supermarket chains to increase delivery options. In fact, Texas-based supermarket chain HEB acquired delivery company Favor and Target acquired Shipt in order to control their own home delivery systems and infrastructure. The fundamentals of shared workspace business models such as WeWork were challenged by the Coronavirus. Problems included difficulty in social distancing in shared spaces, soaring unemployment and the rapid escalation of work-from-home, which hurts the market for office space of all types. 3)\n\nThe Sharing & Gig Economy’s Effect on Employment, Work Life and Careers The sharing economy is disrupting the nature of work,\n\nemployment and entrepreneurship. Most sharing/gig economy workers are working as independent, contract workers, not employees. This means that they do not qualify for company-provided benefits such as health coverage or retirement plans. Many of them conduct work for two or more sharing economy firms. That is, a worker might drive for Uber at night, do installations for TaskRabbit on weekends and shop for Instacart on weekdays. They may vary the schedule according to the demand level, which can be constantly monitored via smartphone. In one-on-one interviews, Plunkett Research has found that many sharing/gig workers consider themselves to be “entrepreneurs.” While they may not have created a new company that employs others or makes products, they nonetheless work for themselves, independently, using their own tools or vehicles and setting their own schedules. In that regard, they are literally running a business, in the same way that a one-man plumbing shop is a business.\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nWorking independently in the sharing/gig economy generally requires no specialized education, and no licensing beyond a drivers’ license. This type of work lends itself very well to people, such as retirees or students, who only want to work part-time, or who want a part-time sideline in addition to a regular job. One study (MBO Partners) found that 49% of part-time independent workers also had a full-time traditional job. MBO Partners publishes an annual report “The State of Independence in America,” that studies the independent worker market. MBO estimated the 2022 level of independent workers in the U.S. at 64.6 million, up 26% from 2021’s 47.8 million. (Their total includes three categories of independent worker: full-time, part-time and occasional. Many of these people have multiple jobs.) For 2022, independent workers generated approximately $1.35 trillion in revenue, up from $1.30 trillion in 2021, according to Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA). There is a significant debate underway in many nations as to whether or not people working as Uber drivers, Instacart shoppers and similar agents are actually employees, rather than contract workers. Legislative reform may well be attempted on large scale in this regard. In some cases, class action lawsuits have been filed by the contract workers. If governments rule that such workers are employees, it would have a massive effect on the business models of sharing economy firms. In the U.S., for example, it would mean that firms were subject to paying payroll taxes such as Social Security, and were subject to very high levels of labor, safety, health and anti-discrimination laws. This debate will likely continue for many years to come, and may well lead to legal reform in some nations. Another outcome may be the formation of contractor workers’ unions or union-like organizations that might demand better pay or working conditions. The “Independent Drivers Guild” now exists in New York City, representing tens of thousands of local Uber drivers, but not quite acting as a true labor union. Over time, there could conceivably be massive changes within gig-based companies of all types. Multiple laws and regulations that protect employees and regulate the ways in which firms must treat them could come into effect, such as minimum wage, unemployment coverage, employer’s liability, OSHA, EEOC and a long list of additional rules. On the other hand, there is already intense competition among gig economy employers, such as Uber and Lyft, to find and hire new workers. Sign-on bonuses, incentives, perks and better revenue share for\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nworkers are now common. Better treatment and pay may have the effect of neutralizing calls to turn contract workers into true employees. 4)\n\nGig Workers’/Drivers’ Rights & Employment Status Evolve One of the perks for independent workers is choosing when and where to work. Uber reported that as of late 2019, 92% of its drivers worked less than 40 hours per week, and 45% work fewer than 10 hours per week. RBC Capital Markets conducted a survey of Uber and Lyft drivers in 2019 which found that 70% of respondents being “extremely” or “very” satisfied with their job experience. There is a significant debate underway in many nations as to whether or not people working as Uber drivers, Instacart shoppers and similar agents are actually employees, rather than contract workers. Legislative reform may well be attempted on large scale in this regard. In some cases, class action lawsuits have been filed by the contract workers. If governments rule that such workers are employees, it would have a massive effect on the business models of sharing economy firms. In the U.S., for example, it would mean that firms were subject to paying payroll taxes such as Social Security, and were subject to very high levels of labor, safety, health and anti-discrimination laws. This debate will likely continue for many years to come and may well lead to legal reform in some nations. Another outcome may be the formation of contractor workers’ unions or union-like organizations that might demand better pay or working conditions. The “Independent Drivers Guild” now exists in New York City, representing tens of thousands of local Uber drivers, but not quite acting as a true labor union. In September 2019, the state of California passed landmark legislation, California Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), that requires firms that rely on gig (contract) workers to consider these workers to be classified as employees. Legislation of this type can create massive changes within gig-based companies of all types. Multiple laws and regulations that protect employees and regulate the ways in which firms must treat them is coming into play, such as minimum wage, unemployment coverage, employer’s liability, OSHA, EEOC and a long list of additional rules. Unions are extremely excited at the prospect of unionizing the gig industry’s hundreds of thousands of California workers. In late 2019, the Competitive Enterprise Institute released the results of a study in which it estimated that reclassifying Uber drivers as employees would cost the firm in excess of $21,000\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nper worker and increase fares between 30% and 50%. A California court ruled in early 2020 that the law does not apply to trucking companies. (Many other industries had successfully lobbied for an exemption from the law.) Shortly after AB5 was signed, companies directly affected by it, such as Uber, Lyft, Instacart and Postmates, helped to raise what was the largest voter referendum funding campaign in California to-date, totaling $204 million dollars. The money was used to pay for massive petition signature drives, in order to get proposed legislation begun that would modify AB5, as well as advertising campaigns to encourage voters to support the new proposition. The result, Proposition 22, was placed on the California ballot and approved by California voters, in November 2020. While Proposition 22 enables sharing and gig companies to continue to classify their people as contract workers, it also provides those workers with new levels of protection. For example, the proposition provides workers with minimum compensation levels, health insurance subsidies (to drivers who meet certain qualifications), medical costs for on-the-job injuries and a prohibition to keep drivers from working more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period for a single company. It also requires companies to develop sexual harassment policies, conduct criminal background checks and require safety training for drivers. Proposition 22 will have widely felt effects on the gig economy as a whole. It can be very interesting to compare the rights of gig workers in other nations to those in the U.S. In the U.K., an officially commissioned review for the British government recommended stronger protection for gig economy workers. In March 2021, Uber was ruled against in its efforts to fight court decisions that require the firm to reclassify its U.K. drivers as workers, not as independent contractors. This “workers” status grants significant rights to drivers, but is a peg below true employees. Uber announced that it would grant minimum wages to these drivers, and the ruling will likely make Uber responsible for paid time-off and pensions. (Uber currently pays health insurance costs in many of its markets, as well.) However, considerable legal wrangling may continue between Uber and U.K. regulators over how to interpret and implement requirements going forward. In March 2020, a French court ruled that a former Uber driver should be recognized as an employee, enabling the driver to seek severance and back pay from Uber. As of early 2021, gig economy companies in Europe were working to negotiate labor\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nagreements with workers and unions as a way of averting rulings that would establish drivers as employees. In China, the Beijing Jiaotong University and ecommerce giant Alibaba conducted a survey of gig economy workers and found that couriers for ecommerce deliveries number more than 1.2 million. As many as 25% of them work more than 12 hours per day, seven days per week, while a majority work eight hours per day each day of the week. Some work directly for retailers such as JD.com or for delivery services such as SF Express. Others work for a group of delivery companies, including ZTO Express, Best Express and STO Express. The Jiaotong survey further found that most couriers make between $300 and $600 per month, or about the same earned by migrant factory workers in China. The going rate for couriers is about 15 cents per package. In late 2021, the Chinese government established new rules to protect ride-hailing drivers. The rules include time off, benefits such as insurance and guidelines for ride hailing companies to publicly disclose fees charged per fare. 5)\n\nRepairs, Errand-Running, Pet Walking and Assembly-on-Demand Businesses Evolve Another sector in the flourishing gig economy prior to the Coronavirus pandemic capitalized on busy consumers simple “to-do list” needs such as repairs, running errands, walking pets, shopping and assembling furniture, appliances and toys. Major players in this area include TaskRabbit, which was acquired by Ikea in late 2017; Handy, offering furniture assembly, moving help, TV mounting and home cleaning; Thumbtack, which provides lists and reviews of professionals to accomplish a variety of tasks in all 50 U.S. states; and Porch, which focuses on home projects such as appliance installation, landscaping, gutter cleaning and art hanging. 6)\n\nSharing Economy Gains Market Share in Travel with Online Sites Like Airbnb, Vrbo and Many Global Competitors One of the most remarkable growth stories in ecommerce has been the advent of new ways to book non-traditional accommodations for travelers. This “sharing economy” (also known as collaborative consumption) affords consumers the ability to rent or borrow everything from hotel rooms to cars to\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nprivate homes. As with all hospitality sectors, shared accommodation has been hard hit by the Coronavirus pandemic. Many travelers may feel safer in small independent properties, away from crowds, rather than in large hotels. While the early months of the Coronavirus saw plummeting demand for travel and for accommodations, short-term home rental sites such as Vrbo soon found popularity among travelers who wanted to avoid hotels. Vrbo, which stands for Vacation Rental by Owner, is a site that allows property owners, especially owners of second homes and resort condos, to advertise their properties online to people seeking vacation accommodations. Vrbo was acquired by startup HomeAway, Inc., a firm that originated when venture capital firm Austin Ventures agreed to back entrepreneur Brian Sharples in this promising business sector. HomeAway also owns Travelmob, a sharing-economy accommodations site focused on Asia. HomeAway was acquired by Expedia in 2015 for $3.9 billion, and the HomeAway name was dropped in favor of Vrbo. Internet platforms that focus primarily on hotel room reservations are also adding homes and apartments as alternative places to stay. For example, Booking.com, a major presence in online hotel room booking and a subsidiary of Priceline, is also offering shared-space and vacation property listings on its site. The biggest disruptor to the hotel industry is San Francisco-based Airbnb, Inc., founded in 2008. Airbnb.com members who are willing to let travelers stay in their homes can post their information, including pricing and accommodation details. The accommodations range from a bedroom in an occupied house or apartment to a luxury apartment or condo reserved entirely for the guest. In turn, travelers may search in a given market for members who are willing to accommodate them. Airbnb offers more than 5.6 million accommodations in 220 countries. Members are encouraged to write reviews describing the positive and/or negative aspects of their stays. These reviews are partially encouraged so that renters and travelers may view profiles and feedback before staying in homes or letting others stay in their homes, thereby reducing the risk of danger or other negative situations. The Airbnb network is also connected to Facebook, allowing members to search the social networking platform for additional information regarding certain hosts and guests. Airbnb charges room owners a 3% host fee and an additional fee of 6% to 12% per guest.\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nThe average commission is about 12% of total revenues. The typical guest stays longer, on average, than a guest in a traditional hotel. Airbnb has expanded to offer local-led activities in cities around the world. Activities are varied and may include bike rides, walking tours or fishing trips, to name a few, and are typically provided by Airbnb hosts. The company offers Airbnb Plus, a luxury service that matches higher-paying guests with quality-inspected home or apartment rentals. Airbnb is establishing new standards for hosts with regard to cleanliness, communication and cancellations, and offers a mobile app to facilitate communication between hosts and guests. Hosts are encouraged to earn badges for “business travel ready” listings that offer such amenities as Wi-Fi and hairdryers. In growing numbers of cities, hosts are now required to purchase short-term rental licenses and collect and remit municipal taxes. Literally hundreds of competitors and imitators have sprung up around the world. Some are focused on particular locales, travelers or types of accommodations. For example, OneFineStay.com (which was acquired by AccorHotels) is focused on renting a curated collection of better homes and condos in major cities, including New York, Paris, Los Angeles and London as well as resort destinations in the Caribbean, Hawaii and Central America, among others. Despite their wide popularity, room- and homesharing sites face multiple challenges. Fraud has been a problem, with unscrupulous site members collecting fees for rentals of properties that they claim to own but are in fact owned by others. Guest safety is a serious issue. There have been accidents, dog bites, even a guest locked into his room by a host seeking sexual favors. At most sites, there are no room inspections and no way to enforce room standards. Guest room rentals may not be covered under a homeowner’s insurance policy. Likewise, such rentals may not be allowed under homeowner’s association rules and municipal law. Last, but not least, the market may become saturated, with only a limited number of properties available to add to inventory. Nonetheless, the traditional hotel industry sees room-sharing as a significant competitive threat that is already taking market share. The long-term result may be hotel chains creating their own branded sharing sites, listing both their own hotel properties and rooms or condos owned by others. Hotels may build hybrid properties as well, with apartment\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\ntowers for room sharing next door to traditional hotel properties. The hotels could run the apartments to high standards, and could build oversized pools, spas and other common area facilities to be shared with guests from the apartments next door. Marriott International offers a vacation propertysharing venture called Homes & Villas by Marriott International. The division offers 2,000 luxury properties worldwide with options ranging from onebedroom homes to a castle in Ireland. Marriott is partnering with LaCure and Lloyd & Townsend Rose to vet and manage unique properties. SPOTLIGHT: Short Term Apartment Rentals Compete with Hotels Travelers are finding furnished apartments in cities around the world available for short term rentals. In some cases, large buildings built especially for this apartment-hotel purpose are springing up. Similar to an Airbnb stay, the apartments offer kitchens and washers and dryers for about 20% to 30% lower nightly rates than hotels. Management companies typically lease a few floors in a condo or apartment building, although Sonder Corp. (www.sonder.com) manages all 270 units in the Butler Brothers building in downtown Dallas. Another company that is active in this segment is Domio, Inc. (www.staydomio.com). 7)\n\nPrivate Jet Sharing and Rentals Soar Prior to the Coronavirus pandemic, many wealthy travelers could not justify the expense of private air travel. The latest business jets can cost $75 million or more for the largest long-range aircraft—airplanes that can travel 7,000+ miles nonstop on intercontinental flights. Small to mid-size jets cost $10 million to $50 million, depending on size and range. A pre-pandemic McKinsey study found that 90% of those who could afford to fly privately chose not to do so. During the onset of Covid in 2020, soaring numbers of affluent travelers began flying privately, especially through charters and fractional ownership plans. Massachusetts-based Sentient Jets (www.sentient.com) reported that 50% of its business in June 2020 was first-time customers, up 127% over 2019. NetJets (www.netjets.com) saw a boom as well and increased its fleet by more than 50 new jets in 2021 with plans to add 60 more in 2022. Under the fractional concept, users commit to fly a given number of hours yearly. They pre-purchase the right to use one or more types of aircraft for those\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nhours. Fractional ownership management firms then acquire, staff, maintain and operate the aircraft, keeping them ready and waiting for their user base. Leading companies in this field include NetJets (owned by conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway), Sentient Jet, Flight Options (www.flightoptions.com) and Flexjet (www.flexjet.com). NetJets is especially dominant in the fractional niche. Customers wanting to make only a modest commitment are typically sold “membership” cards. These cards are generally priced in prepaid amounts of $50,000 to $350,000. They allow the card holder to call upon aircraft on an as-needed basis, with the cost deducted from the balance remaining on the card. Flexjet, offers a JetCard available in 25-hour increments. Fractional ownership and lease options are also available in 50-hour increments. A few companies are offering aircraft membership plans that operate in a similar manner to scheduled airlines. The most notable is California’s Surf Air (www.surfair.com), flying Pilatus turboprops around the San Francisco area, Los Angeles area and Las Vegas, with newer routes to Texas and the Florida panhandle. Reasonable monthly fees enable members to fly as often as they want. Wheels Up (wheelsup.com) uses its growing membership to provide better prices on hourly charter. It offers membership pricing for family and corporate levels. Fees include a one-time initiation cost plus annual dues and hourly charges. The fleet includes King Air turboprops and Cessna Citation jets. A new twist to private flight is startup XO Global (flyxo.com), formerly JetSmarter, Inc., which offers empty seats on private jets available through a smartphone app to its members. Flights include scheduled shuttle flights on major routes or emptyleg trips, which utilize planes being flown empty from one airport to another in preparation for a scheduled flight. 8)\n\nUber, Lyft and Didi Dominate the Car on Demand (Ride Hailing) Industry Uber, Inc. is a California-based creator of the Uber mobile app which connects drivers and ridesharing services with passengers. Uber operates in hundreds of cities worldwide. Upon receiving a ride request, Uber sends the closest driver to fulfill it. Riders can rate their experiences with drivers for other riders to view. The company retains a fee from each ride that it books and then passes the balance of\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nthe fare to the drivers. Uber’s major U.S. competitor is Lyft. Uber has expanded very aggressively on a worldwide basis, although it merged its operations in China with local competitor Didi Chuxing, after Uber incurred massive losses in China. This enabled the firm to concentrate its expansion efforts and cash in other markets, including the vast market in India where it is investing heavily. Uber is a major competitor in India, where it has been purchasing cars and leasing them out to local drivers who want to work with the firm. UberEATS is a restaurant-prepared meal delivery service that is available in dozens of cities worldwide. Uber, through its cutting-edge technologies and industry-leading experience base, is in a position to potentially revolutionize the freight trucking dispatch industry. Meanwhile, China’s Didi Chuxing is working to push into new markets and invest in developing driverless technology. It recently expanded into Japan and Latin America. Other ride hailing services include India’s Ola, Korea’s Kakao Taxi, Singapore’s Grab (which acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia ride sharing and food delivery business in March 2018) and the EU’s Gett. According to Lyft in its “2021 Economic Impact Report,” a survey of its customers found that 45% of Lyft riders do not own or lease a personal vehicle, and because riders are able to use ride-hailing services, own more than 9 million fewer vehicles. 9)\n\nSelf-Driving, Autonomous Cars Receive Massive Investments in Research and Development Worldwide The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)announced a 15-point safety assessment guideline to be used by manufacturers planning to produce self-driving vehicles. The list covers data sharing, data privacy, safety systems, crashworthiness and consumer education, among other things. A car’s systems must be able to easily switch from machine driving to human driving when needed. All features must be submitted to the NHTSA for certification.\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nThe Levels of Self-Driving Technologies Level 0: The driver is always in total control, with no assistance. However most new cars today come with automated safety features that may adjust traction and braking under certain circumstances. Level 1: Very simple driver assistance, such as cruise control and parking assist. The driver always controls the direction of the car on the road. Level 2: The car can steer itself under certain situations, such as a slow-moving traffic jam. Requires constant monitoring by the driver. Level 3: The car can largely steer, brake and adjust speed by itself. However, the car realizes its own limitations and may ask the driver to retake control at any moment. Technologies employed may include such items as adaptive cruise control and automatic lane centering. Level 4: This is the lowest level of truly autonomous driving. The car is able to perform all driving tasks under most driving conditions. Level 5: This is full automation, as no driver is required at all. The vehicle may be operated unoccupied. Today, self-driving technology is largely a reality, although it will require continuous refinement to make it capable of meeting the demands of day-today transportation in a safe manner. Armed with sensors, cameras and cutting-edge software, these vehicles can navigate themselves completely. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are key to the development and operation of reasonably safe, practical autonomous vehicles. The more that such vehicles are tested on the road, the greater the ability of their systems to learn the endless variations of road conditions, traffic flow, pedestrian activities and highway hazards. Ford Motor Co. acquired Argo AI, an artificial intelligence research and development firm. GM has invested in Cruise Automation, a similar firm. In June 2022, Cruise Automation became the first company to operate a commercial driverless ride-hail service when it was granted a permit for use in San Francisco by the California Public Utilities Commission. This allows the firm to carry passengers who pay a fare. Driverless technology also relies on maps that are constantly updated as roads and conditions change. A company called HERE Technologies (originally owned by Nokia but acquired by BMW, MercedesBenz and Audi) is mapping roads in the U.S. and Europe using data acquired from truckers equipped with scanners. Google is also working on precise mapping using technology that uses lasers\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\ntransmitted from specially outfitted cars that create images of roads and their surroundings. Another company, Mobileye, makes camera systems that enable vehicles to detect obstacles and apply the brakes to avoid collisions. Volkswagen and BMW are equipping models with Mobileye and will gather and analyze the images to create maps in a crowdsourcing model. Google’s self-driving effort has been placed into a special subsidiary named Waymo. It has been conducting tests of self-driving cars for several years. Passengers have the use of buttons to start the vehicle, pull the vehicle over, lock or unlock doors and contact a call center. Waymo has been partnering with Lyft to offer rides in the Phoenix metro area in 10 driverless Waymo One vehicles (with human safety observers onboard). In July 2019, the firm received permission from California legislators to transport passengers as part of the state’s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service pilot. In October 2020, Waymo began offering rides in fully driverless vehicles in the Phoenix area. Thousands of driverless rides have been provided since then without incident. Uber instituted a test program for driverless vehicles in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in September 2016, and later launched tests in the Phoenix, Arizona area. Tragically, in March 2018, an Uber self-driving car (while under minimal supervision by an observer riding in the car) struck and killed a woman who was pushing a bicycle in a street in Arizona. Uber has realigned its effort by agreeing to work with Toyota in the self-driving field. Toyota announced that it would invest $500 million in Uber and that technology from both firms will be integrated into Toyota vehicles to be built for use on Uber’s ride-sharing platform. Taking the driver out of the vehicle would save as much as two-thirds of the cost of ride-sharing trips. It’s no surprise that Uber, Lyft and Didi Chuxing (in addition to Google and Chinese search engine firm Baidu) are all investing in driverless technology. Proponents of driverless cars argue that they are infinitely safer than traditional vehicles. Such automated cars may be able to react to potential crashes and safety hazards much more quickly and effectively than human drivers. In addition, their constant communication with nearby vehicles would enable more cars to be safely moving at a steady speed on a given stretch of road at one time, cutting traffic jams and enhancing transportation efficiency. McKinsey & Co. estimated that a widespread\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nadoption of self-driving cars and trucks could eliminate 90% of all auto accidents in the U.S. and prevent up to $190 billion in damages and health care costs yearly. A $6.5 million, 23-acre testing site opened at the University of Michigan where AVs are tested in simulated congested urban conditions. Robotic pedestrians and cyclists dart into traffic while vehicles navigate any number of potentially hazardous conditions including traffic circles, bridges, tunnels, gravel roads and obstructed views. Texas A&M University’s Transportation Institute oversees the Center for Transportation Safety, an organization that conducts research and outreach programs funded at approximately $5 million per year. The school has recently launched its new RELLIS campus on 2,000 acres for research, testing, training and development related to advanced transportation. Driverless trucks (18-wheelers) are also on the horizon. Although truckers and the firms they drive for tend to be slow to adopt new technologies, some are using automation to enable “platooning,” or a caravan of two to three trucks equipped with video cameras, advanced cruise control systems and radarbased braking systems. The lead truck on a convoy controls acceleration and braking for all trucks in the line which are precisely spaced at distances as close as 30 feet. A real-time video camera beams a feed to the following truck drivers so that they can see the road ahead. Traveling single file affords aerodynamic drag reduction resulting in fuel savings of up to 10%. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) tested selfdriving trucks on five 1,000-mile routes between Phoenix and Dallas in May 2019. The trucks were provided by TuSimple, an autonomous trucking firm. TuSimple also has an agreement with UPS and Ryder. Another driverless truck provider is Aurora, which has partnerships with FedEx and Werner Enterprises. Both TuSimple and Aurora hope to offer fully autonomous trucking services as soon as late 2023. Driverless vehicles raise significant safety concerns. The software necessary to run the vehicles is vulnerable to hacking. 10) Bicycle Sharing Grows in Major Cities, But Finances Are Challenging Cycling, both as a means of recreation and as a means of transportation, has grown dramatically. Cyclists who pedal to work are also proliferating. Bicycle sharing systems are responsible for part of\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nthis growth, both in the U.S. and in other parts of the world, but many of these new services are off to a shaky start financially. In some cases, operating costs have been higher than expected, in others equipment losses have been high or ridership has been low. Nonetheless, local governments are generally very supportive of encouraging this emissions-free, exercise-inducing form of transportation. Advertising firm JCDecaux backs a bicyclesharing program in Paris. Sturdy, comfortable bikes called Vélíbs are currently available at hundreds of rental stations throughout the city. Riders can rent bikes by the day or the week, but there are also annual subscriptions that allow unlimited 30-minute maximum rides for a modest yearly fee. Members create an account using their credit cards, which includes permission for the company to charge them if a bike is not returned. Bike sharing has spread to cities including London, San Francisco and Singapore. Mexico City has a bike rental service called Ecobici with hundreds of pickup stations. The City of New York launched its own bike share program in 2013, with sturdy bikes maintained by Alta Bicycle Share of Portland, Oregon. The program includes thousands of bikes. Called Citibike, it is sponsored by banking giant Citigroup. More than 1 million miles were traveled on its bikes in the first month of operation. The history of the most popular bike sharing system is complicated. Bixi, a Canadian firm that designed and manufactured both bicycles and related technology for bike sharing systems, was originally formed by the City of Montreal, and later spun-off as a free-standing company, eventually supported through a large loan from the city. Bixi’s technology is highly advanced, utilizing solar power for the pickup stations (called “docking stations”), as well as wireless communication networks for management. These features make it possible to install a new docking station virtually anywhere, without wiring or power. In addition to developing the technology and bikes, Bixi operated the sharing systems in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. The company eventually sold the international rights to its system to a third party, PBSC Urban Solutions, which is headquartered in Quebec, Canada. PBSC systems are in operation in cities around the world. However, while PBSC sells the equipment, the systems themselves are typically operated by yet another firm, Alta Planning + Design. Alta specializes in design, planning and\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nimplementation of bicycle systems, as well as pedestrian, greenway, park and trail corridors. PBSC also sells equipment to companies other than Alta. One of the largest bike systems in the world is the bike program in Hangzhou, China, with tens of thousands of bikes. Competition among bike sharing firms is fierce in Beijing where firms including Mobike, raised substantial capital and worked to attract riders. Bicycle Sharing, a Logical Solution for Global Problems: Bicycle sharing networks are a perfect fit with many of the world’s dominant trends. With relatively low capital costs and the ability to rapidly launch new bicycle sharing networks with little new infrastructure, the trend is likely to continue to grow very rapidly around the world. It is a logical response to the following global conditions: • Obesity (bicycles are a practical means of exercise that can be used by almost anyone) • Traffic congestion (commuters on bicycles can speed past traffic jams) • Air pollution (no emissions) • Growing need of transportation in urban centers in emerging nations (as more and more workers move into crowded metro areas like Beijing and Mumbai, bicycles are a logical way for them to have inexpensive access to transportation) Source: Plunkett Research, Ltd. Greater consumer convenience was enabled in bike sharing with the “dockless” station. Bikes are activated by smartphones, eliminating the need to build central parking and pickup stations. Consequently, the bikes can be dropped off anywhere, at the convenience of the rider, and then picked up by the next user. However, this also enables consumers to simply dump bicycles anywhere, often in poor condition, leading to massive losses for bicycle firms. Bicycle safety will be a growing issue as more cyclists take to the roads. In the U.S., approximately 800 deaths and more than 500,000 emergency room trips related to cycling happen each year. Head injuries typically account for two-thirds of hospitalizations, according to the University of Wisconsin. However, accidents might lessen as drivers become more aware of cyclists. For example, in the Netherlands, where cycling has long been a part of urban living, drivers are encouraged to open their car doors with their right hands, therefore forcing them to look back, over their left shoulders,\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nfor oncoming cyclists before opening doors. In Boston, stickers alerting taxi passengers and drivers to look before opening doors were installed in 2013, with similar stickers appearing in all cabs in Chicago. The National Association of City Transportation Officials created an urban bikeway design guide for implementing bike safety plans, including buffered bike lanes, intersection signals and more. 11) Demand for Home Grocery Delivery Service Such as Instacart and Amazon Fresh Soars Food retailing, with its highly perishable inventory, is a low-profit-margin enterprise—one in which consumers tend to make multiple trips to the market each month to select and purchase first-hand. The Coronavirus pandemic escalated online grocery shopping exponentially. Data analytics firm Inmar found in a recent poll that 78.7% of respondents shopped online for groceries after the pandemic outbreak, up from 39% before. A lasting, postCoronavirus trend has been consumer demand in ordering groceries online and picking up completed orders at special supermarket parking spots. One of the most closely watched online grocers is FreshDirect LLC, a unique business launched in 2001. FreshDirect is an online retail grocery business serving customers in New York City and the surrounding areas. It offers fresh food and grocery items, including fruits and vegetables, meat, seafood, deli items, cheese, dairy, coffee, tea, bakery goods, pasta and frozen food as well as kosher, gluten free, local and organic produce, health and beauty items and wine. It also provides catering services and a full line of ready-to-heat meals prepared by its on-staff chefs. FreshDirect owns and operates a 300,000square-foot state-of-the-art processing facility, which enables the company to process and ship fresh meats, produce and dairy products quickly and efficiently. The company is also sometimes able to offer lower prices than traditional retail grocers, due to the lack of the need to operate expensive retail stores. Customers can also pick up their orders at the distribution facility. The firm served select counties in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware. FreshDirect customers have the ability to shop by lifestyle, by clicking on gluten-free, kosher, organic or other groups. Satisfaction is 100% guaranteed. In late 2020, FreshDirect was acquired by Ahold Delhaize NV, which owns a number of supermarket chains including Giant and Stop & Shop. This may lead to fast expansion for FreshDirect.\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nPeapod, an aggressive home grocery delivery service that has been in business since 1989, has built a base of online shoppers slowly but surely. Peapod has a presence in a number of major cities and suburban areas, including cities in Massachusetts, Virginia, Maryland, Wisconsin, Washington, D.C., Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, Illinois, Indiana and New Jersey. Peapod entered the New York City market for the first time in 2011, where it must compete directly against FreshDirect. Customers order online via Peapod.com and, for a fee, receive home delivery of their groceries, which are packed at warehouses near participating supermarkets. Despite its lengthy history and wealth of experience, Peapod struggled financially at first. It was acquired in 2001 by one of the world’s largest supermarket chains, European-based Royal Ahold, through its Ahold USA unit. In February 2020, Ahold USA shut down the stand-alone Peapod online grocery operation in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. However, the onset of the Coronavirus spurred new growth in the company, with supermarket chains Giant Food and Stop & Shop announcing the integration of Peapod’s ecommerce technology and services into their businesses in 2020. Amazon has been getting deeper into the grocery sector for many years, both through internal development and through acquisition. In late 2014, Amazon launched Prime Now, which delivers groceries and consumer goods in as little as one to two hours. Amazon has been aggressively rolling out warehouses in major cities all over the U.S. to serve its growing Prime Now business. In late 2016, Amazon opened its first brick and mortar grocery store called Amazon Go in Seattle, Washington. The 1,800 square-foot store offers prepared foods and grocery staples and requires shoppers to scan a smartphone app linked to an Amazon account upon arrival. The app maintains a virtual cart of the items selected by the shopper and charges the related account accordingly when the shopper leaves the store, without any interaction with a human cashier. Initially open only to Amazon employees for testing, the company opened the store to the public in 2017. In addition, Amazon had opened 44 stores under its Amazon Fresh brand, focusing on urban grocery stores, by August 2022, in eight U.S. states and Washington D.C. In 2017, the firm acquired specialty supermarket firm Whole Foods Market, Inc. for $13.7 billion, sending shockwaves through the grocery industry. This is an extension of Amazon's grocery strategy. In\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nSeptember 2020, Whole Foods opened its first online-only store in Brooklyn, New York. Brick and mortar grocers are scrambling to fulfill the shift in consumers’ shopping habits that was spurred by the Coronavirus. Walmart offers Walmart Grocery, a pickup and delivery service in which online orders can be picked up at store drive-through lanes, often on the same day. The firm also offers same day delivery in most U.S. markets. Online grocery shopping is rapidly becoming commonplace at major supermarket chains, with consumers’ options ranging from ordering online and picking up curbside, to delivery to the home. For example, the massive grocery firm Kroger offers a click and collect service called ClickList in stores nationwide, including many of its subsidiary brands such as Fred Meyer and Smith’s. Another twist on grocery shopping online is Instacart, a San Francisco-based company that models online shopping, somewhat on the same business model as Uber. Customers use an app to enter a list of groceries and other items they want, and nearby shoppers pick up the items and deliver them using their own cars, bikes or other transportation. Shoppers are independent contractors. This work may be attractive to people like students or stay-at-home parents who want to control their own schedules while making extra money. Instacart charges a delivery fee and marks up store prices for each item delivered. Demand for Instacart’s services soared during the Coronavirus pandemic. In December 2017, Target Corporation announced its $550 million acquisition of grocery delivery startup Shipt, an Instacart competitor. Grocery delivery in China has become commonplace. Dozens of startup companies, including Quick Bee, New Dada and Dianwoda, employ couriers on electric motorbikes who pick up orders from supermarkets, convenience stores and independent shops for quick delivery. The firms charge for each delivery (starting at about five yuan or 72 cents U.S. per package) and receive commissions from retailers. Retail giants Alibaba Group Holding and JD.com are investing heavily in these startups. Alibaba spent nearly 1 billion yuan ($150 million) on Dianwoda in 2016, and New Dada is 40% owned by JD.com. Alibaba’s Freshippo concept combines a grocery store with a restaurant and a delivery app, which together utilize robotics and facial recognition to speed logistics and payment.\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nSPOTLIGHT: Micro-Fulfillment Centers The Coronavirus brought sweeping changes to the retail sector—basically a rapid restructuring of the entire sector. Retail foot traffic slumped while ecommerce soared for everything from groceries to household items to apparel. These changes have significant implications for supply chain and distribution. Since consumers frequently demand same-day (and often two-hour) availability of goods that they have ordered online, a superior level of rapid distribution may, in many cases, only be provided by creating “micro-fulfillment centers.” These centers are small, local warehousing, packing and distribution areas that may be only a few hundred square meters in size. They may be located in a special area within a retail store, or they may be freestanding facilities, often near the store. Thus, the centers are typically within dense population areas. (This is a sharp contrast to traditional fulfilment centers that typically are of massive size and often located a significant drive-time away from densely populated markets.) Micro-Fulfillment works best when coupled with systems and equipment designed especially for this purpose, and specialized robotics and related software are a great tool for this strategy. 12) Meal Kits from Firms like Blue Apron Make It Easy to Prepare HomeCooked Meals Firms such as Blue Apron and HelloFresh have gained a reasonable level of popularity in home kitchens throughout the U.S., the UK, much of Asia/Pacific and the EU. Customers subscribe to these services, which provide pre-portioned meal ingredients and recipes, and promise fresh, highquality meats and produce that average about $10 per meal. Consumers order their meal kits online, which are delivered by UPS or similar ground services in high-tech packaging that keeps raw ingredients chilled and fresh. Demand was greatly spurred by the Coronavirus pandemic. Supermarkets are responding aggressively to the meal kit trend. For example, Walmart, HEB Grocery Company and Kroger are offering meal kits. Reachin coolers filled with attractively packaged, modestlypriced meal kits are in high traffic areas in such stores. Shoppers can grab and go, and quickly put together a fresh meal at home using recipe cards that are inside of the packages. Alternately, shoppers can order these meal kits online, and then pick them up at curbside—a highly convenient way to organize tonight’s dinner without entering the store. HelloFresh has sold its branded meal kits to Giant\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nFood & Stop and Shop stores, and Blue Apron Holdings has sold meal kits at Costco stores. A firm called Plated has offered its kits through Safeway and Albertson stores, among others. Consumers using these complete meal kits want to create fresh, home-cooked meals that do not require a shopping trip to the supermarket. At the same time, however, they want innovative menus and recipes that they can enjoy cooking and serving. HelloFresh SE is the world’s leader in this sector, with headquarters in Berlin, Germany and distribution centers in many nations worldwide. One of its brands, Factor75, delivers fully cooked meals, a wide departure from the traditional raw ingredients kits offered by HelloFresh’s other brands. HelloFresh boosts it appeal by offering meal kits to fit a broad variety of dietary interests. For example, its Green Chef unit offers selections that are vegan, keto and paleo diet appropriate. 13) Grubhub, DoorDash and Others Deliver Restaurant Meals and Household Items to Homes Apps that enable users to order restaurant meals for home delivery are now popular in cities around the world. Users create accounts on these apps, with payment card information as well as home address. Nearby restaurants appear on the smartphone app including complete menu information. Users make their choices; the app sends the order to the selected restaurant and dispatches a delivery courier. Delivery fees and driver/courier tips are added to the price of the food and charged to the credit card, PayPal or digital wallet account on file. Meal delivery services were a savior for many restaurants during the Coronavirus crisis. Major players in this niche include Grubhub, Seamless (which is part of Grubhub), DoorDash and Uber Eats in the U.S.; Delivery Hero and Takeaway.com in the EU; Just Eat in the U.K. and Deliveroo in the U.K, the EU, Asia and Australia. Uber’s meal delivery unit saw soaring growth during the Coronavirus, helping to offset a decline in its traditional car service. Restaurants pay very substantial fees, usually about 15% to 30% of the total per order to the meal delivery firms. Some restaurants may elect to hire their own dedicated drivers, but this can be challenging to manage, and a well-run system would include the cost and effort of implementing ordertaking technology along with hiring delivery drivers. At least 25% to 30% of a restaurant’s orders need to be for delivery in order to cover the expense, according to analysts at Boston Consulting Group.\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nMany restaurants are opting to outsource deliveries to firms such as Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. Often, these restaurants raise their prices on meals sold through the apps in order to recoup the costs. During the Coronavirus pandemic, more than 70 U.S. cities and states temporarily capped fees charged by delivery apps and paid by restaurants. In New York City, permanent caps were set. However, in September 2021, DoorDash, Grubhub and Uber Technologies’ Eats division filed suit against the city, stating that a permanent cap would necessitate rewriting contracts with restaurants, reduce marketing efforts and raise prices for customers. Cheaper alternatives are providing competition for these firms such as Spread, a Manhattan food order and delivery website for that charges $1 per order and no commissions are paid by the restaurants. The big apps themselves are also taking steps to give restaurants a break. DoorDash is building websites for small restaurants, charging them a flat fee for delivery rather than a commission. The firm is also allowing restaurants to choose from three fee rates (15%, 25% or 30% in the U.S.), with varying degrees of marketing and product support. Uber Eats offers a similar flat fee service as does Grubhub. The food delivery business model is cost intensive, and companies in this sector are innovating to increase order size. DoorDash, Uber and others are offering delivery of groceries, alcohol and a variety of household goods in addition to restaurant fare. Conversely, Grubhub, which was acquired by Just Eat Takeaway.com in June 2021, plans to focus on online marketing and delivery for restaurants exclusively. Notably, Grubhub announced plans in mid-2021 to roll out food delivery robots on college campuses in the U.S. in partnership with Yandex NV. Starship Technologies (www.starship.xyz) has small, wheeled units in testing around the world. Starship Technologies’ robots maneuver along sidewalks at speeds of up to four miles per hour with a range of two miles, making them applicable for the last-mile delivery stage of consumer or business shipping. When the units reach a delivery address, the addressee is alerted and uses a smartphone app to unlock the knee-high robot and remove the package(s) inside. The robots can carry up to 40 pounds. By early 2023, 4 million autonomous deliveries had been completed. The company’s founders also started online telephony firm Skype.\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nSPOLIGHT: Restaurants with No Seats The preponderance of delivery apps and services are fueling a new concept in restaurants: those with no seats for customers. In fact, customers aren’t allowed in. These kitchen-only establishments do not have the overhead that comes with seating areas, waitstaff, signage, high-traffic real estate and related costs. Instead, the kitchen cooks to orders taken by app and needs only a central pickup counter or window where interactions with delivery service runners take place. Delivery service Grubhub invested $1 million in Green Summit Group, a startup in Chicago, Illinois, to build a central kitchen which produces dishes for nine different “virtual restaurants.” Each appears as a separate establishment with unique menus but is prepared in the same kitchen by the same staff. Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has launched a well-funded firm called CloudKitchens that buys relatively inexpensive commercial real estate and converts it into locations where entrepreneurs can rent delivery-only kitchen space. His firm has also launched its own delivery-only restaurant brands, such as Excuse My French Toast. CloudKitchens’ investments are global, ranging from China and India to the U.S. and UK. Walmart’s Canada division is partnering with Ghost Kitchen Brands to offer online ordering and delivery. Creating Culinary Communities (C3) operated 800 “ghost kitchens” in mid-2022 and hoped to grow very aggressively. C3 investors include Simon Property Group and Accor S.A. 14) Fashion Rental Pioneered by Online Apparel Firm Rent the Runway Rent the Runway, an online site that rents dresses, jewelry and accessories, makes luxury affordable to its 134,240 subscribers (as of July 2022), up from 95,245 in mid-2020. The site offers tens of thousands of dresses, tops, pants, skirts, as well as accessories and jewelry (many from top designers such as Badgley Mischka, Herve Leger and Vera Wang) which members rent for a few days and return in prepaid and addressed folding garment bags. The company’s warehouse operations are housed in a 160,000-square-foot facility. In addition to packing and shipping, the facility has been carefully designed to incorporate dry-cleaning and sterilization of returned apparel, making Rent the Runway the largest dry-cleaning operation, in one building, in the U.S. Members may also purchase clothing and accessories, rather than rent.\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nStarting in 2017, Rent the Runway varied its offerings from one-time, one–-item rentals to monthly subscriptions, including RTR Unlimited which allows the rental of unlimited numbers of pieces on rotation with no return dates. Rent the Runway also opened a small number of brick-andmortar stores. The company reported that most people wear only 20% of their closets. This indicates that a continual stream of rented attire may have great appeal to certain consumers. The Coronavirus pandemic hit Rent the Runway hard. Much of its business focused on clothing for the office or for parties, proms, weddings and other social gatherings and special events. By mid-2020, the firm had closed its brick-and-mortar stores permanently, and instituted layoffs. It also expanded its drop-off and pickup locations for online orders, utilizing some of its former stores. Business rebounded by late 2021, and the company conducted a successful IPO in late October of that year. There are a number of fashion rental web sites, each with a particular focus. For example, Gwynnie Bee offers plus-size subscribers access to clothing in U.S. sizes 10-32, while Style Lend offers subscribers designer clothing from members’ closets, generally in sizes 0, 2 or 4. Taelor offers men’s clothing to monthly subscribers. Top Fashion Rental Companies: Gwynnie Bee, closet.gwynniebee.com Le Tote, www.letote.com Rent the Runway, www.renttherunway.com Style Lend, www.stylelend.com Taelor, taelor.style 15) Shared Spaces for Co-Living and CoWorking Face Challenges While WeWork became famous for offering hip, shared office and workspaces, spawning many imitators both large and small, this innovative firm faced dismal news during 2019 and 2020, including huge financial losses and a cancelled stock IPO. (In 2021, the company successfully completed an IPO after reducing expenses and generally revamping operations.) The office sharing trend also led to a boom in shared apartment space, with common kitchens and social spaces. The fundamentals of these business models were challenged by the Coronavirus, including the obvious problems of difficulty in social distancing in shared spaces, soaring unemployment and the rapid escalation of work-from-home, which hurts the market for office space of all types.\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\nLiving Space Sharing: In major U.S. cities such as New York and San Francisco, apartment rents are so high that developers have been testing “co-living” spaces where tiny apartments share kitchens, lounges and communal atmospheres. The Coronavirus pandemic took a toll on many co-living companies, with several closing or consolidated. In mid-2020, WeWork shut down its WeLive program. Common (www.common.com) had buildings in 10 U.S. cities including New York, New York; Los Angeles and San Francisco, California; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Washington, D.C. as of 2023. Common acquired Starcity’s 7,500 units (which were part of the branded Ollie co-living spaces in New York, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Los Angeles, California) in mid2021. Manhattan-based Outpost Club (outpostclub.com), which offers apartments and houses in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Philadelphia, took over Stoop, Bedly and Quarters. Other startups are focusing on leasing furnished and unfurnished apartments with short-term flexible leases. For example, Sentral (www.sentral.com) offers a network of 3,000 apartments in seven U.S. cities, that allows renters to book units for any length of stay. Sonder Corp. (www.sonder.com) and Mint House, Inc. (minthouse.com) offer similar leasing options. This can be particularly useful to renters who are on short-term work assignments who are not sure of how long the work will last, as well as people who want to try out a new city temporarily before they make a commitment to move there. In China, co-living has been popular with millennials. Unlike co-living arrangements in the U.S., China’s renters have been willing to share bedrooms in addition to bathrooms, kitchens and living areas. You+ offers co-living spaces in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou for about $300 per month. Buildings offer amenities including gyms and bars. Although primarily focused on young, single Millennials, married couples are welcome at You+ as are pets, but children are not allowed. Residents over age 45 are discouraged. Workspace Sharing: A leader in this niche is WeWork. The company leases large offices, such as entire floors or buildings, divides the space and then sublets to other companies. The company had more than 800 locations in 39 countries as of late 2022. Work spaces are provided in two ways: On-Demand and All Access. On-Demand is a pay-as-you-go product that offers customers access to workspace on an as-needed basis. All Access is a subscriptionbased model that provides members with the ability\n\nwww.plunkettresearch.com\n\nto work from any WeWork location. Partnerships are available for brokers, landlords and event planners, among others. The firm also offers Business Solutions, a professional services platform in partnership with VensureHR, offering single-point access to a suite of human resource services. WeWork also offers the WeWork Services Store, an integrated hub for business services. The Services Store is a software platform that is much like an app store. It allows users to find, manage and purchase services with recommendations from members and special offers for WeWork members. Starting in late 2019, WeWork was changing its methods and attempting to stem operating losses, after a failed effort to IPO the firm’s stock. The firm announced plans to cut thousands of employees and to close several new business experiments that were draining funds. Low demand during the Coronavirus pandemic led some firms to file for bankruptcy, including Knotel (which took bankruptcy in early 2021), once a very large operator, and Serendipity Labs. Several business entities linked to IWG PLC’s office suite rental business also took bankruptcy. As an alternative to signing long-term leases for space, there is a growing tendency for shared workspace operators to sign management agreements. These agreements allow for the operators to apply their expertise, marketing and digital platforms, while providing the building’s owners with a share of the revenue, as opposed to a guaranteed rental payment. 16) Gig Economy and Self-Driving Cars Pose Insurance Challenges and Underwriting Opportunities Transportation industry analysts believe that, over the mid- to long-term, more and more consumers will forgo car ownership in favor of ridehailing services (such as Uber, Didi and Lyft). This has profound implications for the future of the automobile insurance industry, in the same way that it will deeply affect the automobile manufacturing sector. Consequently, insurers are scrambling to devise policy options that cover drivers (or riders, which may include paying passengers) in a wide variety of transportation scenarios. Allstate subsidiary Arity is working to analyze staggering amounts of telematics (digital automobile trip records) data on personal driving habits to help develop such insurance options for the future. Arity says it has access to more than 1 billion miles of new driver information per month on\n\nPlunkett Research, Ltd.\n\ntop of 10 years of archival data from Drivewise, another Allstate subsidiary. Analysis of this data may help Allstate form a benchmark for future rates in emerging mobility services trips. The Holy Grail for insurance companies will be the ability to sell more expensive and more comprehensive policies to these drivers for Uber and similar firms. However, Uber and similar drivers are on limited budgets and may be resistant to higher operating costs. There are business opportunities for insurance startups that hope to serve the ride-hailing market. Zego, for example, brokers third-party liability insurance for food and package couriers working in the UK, Ireland, France and Spain, including those carrying orders for firms ranging from Deliveroo to Amazon. While ride-hailing poses challenges to insurers, self-driving vehicles are even more complicated to insure. Some experts believe that self-driving cars will reduce accidents, citing data that indicates that as much as 94% of all accidents are caused by human error. This may create significant drops in revenues for insurance underwriters. For example, there may be fewer automobile-related wrecks, fatalities and personal injuries in the future, not to mention fewer individual car owners. It is possible that insurance premiums will become much more competitive and drop if accidents become rarer. This will drive insurance industry innovation and force insurance firms to create new types of products aimed at multiple types of consumers: traditional car owners, makers of self-driving vehicles and the software and other technologies that guide them, ride-hailing firms such as Uber, and individual consumers who want better personal coverage when they are riding in vehicles that they do not own. 17) The Future of the Sharing Economy and Gig Workforce: Regulation, Benefits, Licensing and Soaring Growth There is a significant debate underway in many nations as to whether or not people working as Uber drivers, Instacart shoppers and similar agents are actually employees, rather than contract workers. Legislative reform has already been attempted on a large scale in this regard. In some cases, class action lawsuits have been filed by the contract workers. If governments rule that such workers are employees (rather than independent contract workers"
