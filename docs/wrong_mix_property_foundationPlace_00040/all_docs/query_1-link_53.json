        "text": "were sold in deals brokered by Igloo.com (a firm that has booked some $120 million in domain name and website transactions) but due to NDAs we don't know the prices paid for the two domains. It is quite likely both came close to or hit seven figures though, something only one publicly reported sale has done so far this year.\n\nRegarding the Realty.com purchase that was just completed this month, Tessa noted, \"The purchase of Realty.com by former CEO of Host Gator, Lance Custen, would be charted as this years second highest domain sale if the sale price were made public. Serving as CEO & President of Realty.com, Custen intends for his new venture to create technology on the site which will revolutionize and disrupt the real estate industry.\n\nRealty.com was acquired from Dan and Andy Denton. Dan said, I was surprised and very happy with how fast and smooth this sale took place, from contract to funding. Igloo stayed in constant communication through every step of the transaction, giving us confidence that the sale would be complete, and it did, in record time as far as Im concerned.\n\nWhile we are extremely grateful for all of the sales data that has been made public over the years, giving all of us greater insight into the domain aftermarket and the value of specific domains, it is good to remember that the market is much bigger than what we see in the weekly sales reports - and the significant value of high quality domains continues to be recognized and utilized by Internet savvy businesses around the world.\n\nThe first WorldHostingDays conference ever held in America - WHD.usa - came to a close Wednesday night (May 20, 2015) at the Seven Springs Mountain Resort in western Pennsylvania. WHD is known for both the quality of the shows they run and their preference for gorgeous but remote locations that keep attendees close together in one place. The locations they choose and their creative approach to social activities creates an ideal atmosphere for networking and relationship building. You'll see what I mean in the photos & highlights from the final day of WHD.usa below.\n\nAbove: In one of the most interesting morning sessions Wednesday Weebly.com Vice Presidents Chris Sheridan (left) and Nick Dellis (right) provided insight into who is building websites today and the key trends in the website creator space (a space where Weebly is one of the most dominant players). They emphasized their growing focus on enabling people to build sites that are universally mobile friendly. Sheridan summed it up as \"your vision on every device\" (all the way down to smart watches).\n\nBelow: WHD.usa also scored a coup by landing Tim Wu as a featured speaker for the noon hour. Wu is the Columbia University Law School Professor who created the term \"net neutrality\" and authored the book The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires.\" Wu laid out all of the compelling reasons why the Internet must remain an open playing field with no single (or small number) of mega corporations controlling the pipeline and what flows through it.\n\nThe daytime business sessions ended at 1:30pm when lunch was served. Then the rest of the day was devoted to some special outdoor networking activities that were tremendously effective in bringing people together. Attendees could choose from golf tournaments (9 hole or 18), riding ziplines through the sky or sporting clays shooting. Looking for something out of the ordinary (at least for us) we split our time between the Screaming Hawk Zipline and Sporting Clays.\n\nAbove: With an instructor looking on Felipe Guacache of Open-Xchange tries his hand at shooting clay targets. I met Felipe for the first time in Pennsylvania, only to learn that he lives just a few miles from me in Tampa, Florida!\n\nBelow: Re-loading before another set of targets is released.\n\nWhile the novice marksmen were shooting (above) others were getting ready to test the Screaming Hawk Zipline a few miles away (below). I jumped on a shuttle bus to go check out what they were doing.\n\nBefore you can go flying through the sky on a zipline safety consideratins requires some careful preparation. Above: Instructors fit WHD.usa guests with harnesses, hooks, ropes and gloves.\n\nBelow: While still at ground level, an instructor shows everyone what they need to know and do when they get up on the platform and go airborne.\n\nAbove: One of the hardest parts is climbing the long rope net to the launch platform!\n\nBelow: Finally! A chance to fly with the eagles across the Pennsylvania mountainside.\n\nBelow: After landing on a narrow perch a couple of hundred yards away, it is time to take the return flight!\n\nThe afternoon activities had everyone buzzing when they returned to the hotel for the final events of WHD.usa 2015.\n\nAbove: At 6:30pm, Erik Martin (left), the former General Manager of Reddit who is now the US GM at Depop was interviewed by Servint President (and i2Coalition Chairman) Christian Dawson in a pre-dinner session that was both highly informative and delightfully funny thanks to the off kilter sense of humor the two men share. They would have fit right in on David Letterman's final show tonight.\n\nBelow: An hour later the curtain came down on the first WorldHostingDays show in America with a VIP Executive Dinner that put an exclamation mark on an awesome week.\n\nOf course, with conferences, they are never really over until you are in the car or on the plane headed home. As soon as I left the closing night dinner I ran into a half-dozen friends lingering outside and just had to stop to spend another half hour or so trading stories and figuring out where our paths would next intersect down the line. It's a good thing I stopped too because I stumbled upon some breaking news. Popular domain industry veteran Frank Michlick (DomainCocoon.com) finally got a haircut! I never knew why our friend from Canada wore glasses because his hair always covered them anyhow! Frank (below) allowed that the shorter hairdo has indeed improved his vision dramatically. Thanks to this less than extreme makeover, we also now know that Frank is not only one of the smartest guys in the business, but one of the best looking too!\n\nSo, now it is time to fly back to Florida, though for some reason I have an itch to go by zipline rather than airline. A big thank you to WHD.usa (who made a great first impression on the side of the pond) and InterNetX who invited me to come up and see what a hosting conference looks like. I learned some things I didn't know about the relationship between the domain and hosting businesses - a relationship there is reason to believe will get closer in the years ahead. I'll expand on that and some other topics inspired by this trip in an upcoming Cover Story.\n\nThe first WorldHostingDays conference ever held in America - WHD.usa - got underway Tuesday (May 19, 2015) at the beautiful Seven Springs Mountain Resort in western Pennsylvania. Here are photos and highlights from a very busy opening day and night at the two-day event that will conclude tonight.\n\nAbove WHD.usa Hosts Emily Parker and Soeren von Varchmin opened the show with\n\nwelcoming comments Tuesday morning at the Seven Springs Mountain Resort.\n\nBelow: The highlight of the morning sessions was a live interview (via Skype) with\n\nWikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales conducted by Ms. Parker (the author of the book\n\nNow I Know Who My Comrades Are: Voices From the Internet Underground).\n\nExhibitors in the WHD.usa Exhibition Hall came up with some unique ways to attract attendees to their booths. During the morning coffee break I stopped by the InterNetX booth (above) to try my hand in their Server Lifting Challenge (below). While being timed you had to hold a server in the air as long as possible. My time was less than stellar but everyone who accepted the challenge won as they were given nice InterNetX gift bags.\n\nAfter several more morning business sessions in the Grand Balroom, WHD.usa invited guests to take part in a variety of leisure activities available during the two-hour lunch break - a perfect opportunity to explore the lush surroundings at Seven Springs and have some while you were at it. Above is a view of one of the mountainsides that features an undulating 2,000 foot alpine slide. Below, DomainNameWire's Andrew Allemann raises a fist in the air after a exhilarating ride from top to bottom.\n\nOther lunch-time activities included chairlift rides up the mountain (above) and Segway rides at the Adventure Center. For those who like indoor sports better, the resort's own bowling lanes were open to all.\n\nAbove: Right after lunch ICANN VP for Stakeholder Engagement, Christopher Mondini, was featured in a wide ranging interview conduced by Emily Parker.\n\nBelow: A WHD.usa panel discussion devoted entirely to the latest developments in the domain name business followed Mr. Mondini's talk. From left to right are Alexander Siffrin (CEO, Key-Systems), Ken Hansen (CEO, .CO.COM), Jeff Sass (CMO, .CLUB), Brad Lemire (VP, Business Development for North America, at Sedo) and moderator Monte Cahn (RightOfTheDot.com)\n\nAbove: Some of the day's final business sessions were held in a breakout room - the Snowflake Forum - that is set up like a college classroom. This session featured InterNetX Global Sales Manager Helena Schindler. InterNeX is a major power in both the domain and hosting worlds.\n\nBelow: With business out of the way it was time for the big evening social event, Weebly.com's ConneXion Party held at the Foggy Goggle night club. It started with a great buffet dinner, drinks and networking as dusk was falling on a pleasant evening in the western Pennsylvania mountains.\n\nAbove (left to right): Chris Sheridan (Business Development star at Weebly.com, the party hosts who made it a great evening with good food, drinks and live entertainment), David Woroch, Jeff Sass (.CLUB) and Christine Hoh (Sr. Account Executive at MailChannels).\n\nBelow: There was some great entertainment inside of the Weebly.com Stage. They brought in the lovely and talented Joseph Sisters (below) as well as bonafide hitmakers Snap!, who stormed the charts in 1990 with \"The Power\" (which went to #2 in the U.S.).\n\nAs I write this day two is underway at WHD.usa. I will have photos and highlights from the closing day of the big event for you in my next post from Pennsylvania.\n\nWe got an early taste of what is ahead last night when CPanel welcomed early arrivers to their pre-show Come2gether Party at the Lake Tahoe Lodge.\n\nAbove: There were some light showers on and off last night, but it was easy to get undercover, even on the outdoor deck where you could take a table under the expansive roof as these four familiar faces did. Clockwise from left are Paul Goldstone (President of the .CO.COM Registry and Founder of registrar DomainIt.com), Monte Cahn (Co-Founder of RightOfTheDot.com), Ken Hansen (.CO.COM CEO) and Steve Albert (DomainIt.com). Monte will be moderating a high profile session on the domain name market this afternoon at 3:45pm.\n\nBelow: It was also cozy (and dry) inside the Lake Tahoe Lodge. No rain is forecast today so the weather should be perfect for getting outdoors during the two-hour lunch break to enjoy the scheduled networking activities (including Segway tours, an alpine slide and chairlift rides) or just explore the mountaintop surroundings (though we have been warned to keep an eye out for bears)!\n\nAbove: Though we knew some long time friends from the domain business were going to WHD.usa it was a very pleasant surprise to bump into some we didn't know were coming and whom we hadn't seen for awhile. They included Louise Munck (left), now based in Copenhagen, Denmark as the Business Development Manager at Ascio (who many of you know from her days at Winged Media) and Jason Miner (center), who is now the General Manager of domain focused brands at Endurance International Group after a long and successful run with NameMedia. With them at right is Kevin Kopas, Channel Manager for the Americas at Radix Registry.\n\nBelow: The outdoor deck was still buzzing with activity when we left about 10pm to get ready for a very busy two days ahead. WHD.usa officially opens at 9am this morning with a welcoming speech from Emily Parker, author of Now I Know Who My Comrades Are. One of the day's highlights will be a 10am Keynote Speech from Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales. I will have photos & highlights from today and tonight's activity at WHD for you in my next post from Seven Springs tomorrow morning."
