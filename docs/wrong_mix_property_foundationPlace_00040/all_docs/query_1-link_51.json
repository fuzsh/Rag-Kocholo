Well, the short of it is that you’d get unprecedented insight into how companies are started – with access to all the talks, constantly being around founders, and working directly with YC Group Partners. Our GPs are possibly the 12 most knowledgeable people in the world about starting companies. You’d be hard pressed to work here and NOT learn something new about startups every day – which might be helpful if you’re interested in starting a company yourself.\n\nSoftware also touches everything YC does. When I went through YC in 2013, the core pieces of the YC batch were a dinner each week, a 1-1 with your group partner, and an end-of-batch Demo Day event to raise money. Today, YC offers so many software tools to help founders build their companies, including:\n\nDemo Day website, which has helped founders raise $3B+ over the last 3 years Work at a Startup, where 1000s of companies have hired from a pool of 1M+ job seekers Bookface, a tool for YC founders to support and help each other build their companies\n\nYC software runs kind of like a startup: we have a small engineering team (15 people) full of full-stack software developers (Rails, React, Postgres) who talk to our users, ship fast and iterate often. YC’s great for people who like to move fast and learn quickly. As a member of our team, you’d work with and learn from some pretty experienced people who were early at Facebook, Carta, Salesforce, Twilio and other top companies.\n\nMany of us have also been founders, and seven former employees have gone on to start startups that were funded by YC. If you want to start a startup but don’t have a great idea yet, we welcome you to spend a couple years here to learn, and then launch your own. On the flip side, if you can see yourself writing code indefinitely, we’d love to keep you happy here at YC for a long time. Either one works for us.\n\nBuilding software at YC isn’t for everyone – YC’s real product is the Batch program and the Group Partners’ advice and help for the life of your startup. Our software team is often in the background, helping scale YC’s ability to help more companies, and in a way that means more 1-1 attention and support for each founder. What keeps me motivated is continuing to scale and improve YC through software, and getting to work with some of the most kind and talented people of my 20+ year career.\n\nIf you have questions, I would love to answer them here. (It would help me understand how I can make our role & work more clear!) And if this resonates with you, shoot me an email with what you’d most be excited to work on (job descriptions below) – ryan@ycombinator.com\n\nY Combinator, Product Engineer on Bookface - https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=00c6950f-341f-...\n\nY Combinator, Product Engineer on Work at a Startup - https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=ef00c8d1-76e7-...\n\nY Combinator, Product Engineer on Internal Tools - https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=bbf8f36d-60bf-...\n\nStainless | Generalist Engineers, First AE | NYC ONSITE | Full-time\n\n(We were on hn recently: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40146505)\n\nStainless is building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs. Our first product is SDKs as a service. When you `npm install openai` or `pip install openai`, for example, you’re downloading code that we generated. (I built the codegen system at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.)\n\nNext, we want to make it easy to build amazing REST APIs. REST is simple and ubiquitous, but right now it’s also messy, chaotic, and hard to get right. We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection/expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.\n\nWe’re ~2y old, ~10 people, have strong revenue (could choose to be profitable), and great customers (including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare). We’re backed by Sequoia.\n\nAs one of our first ten engineers, you’ll get autonomy to build great products, skilled peers, opportunity for tremendous impact, competitive salary, and a very competitive ownership stake.\n\nWe’re looking for exceptionally productive, thoughtful, tasteful, and kind people with a passion for making software development better for everyone.\n\nWant to build the future of API tooling?

We've built an automated end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.\n\nAt Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. We’ve built something really good, something that clinicians really need and love. We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing high quality care. It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections).\n\nWe are a team of 27 with strong product market fit — in Q4 last year we’ve had to push out onboarding because engineering can’t build quickly enough, something we’ve scaled out of and will hopefully not bottleneck growth again. You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get clinicians back to work helping kids.\n\nEmail me directly at jade@juniperplatform.com!\n\nHatchet (https://hatchet.run) | New York City (IN-PERSON) | Full-time\n\nWe're hiring a founding engineer to help us with development on our open-source, distributed task queue: https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet.\n\nWe recently launched on HN, you can check out our launch here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136.

Dioxus is a popular crossplatform GUI library for Rust that, imo, is the easiest way to ship apps that are beautiful, fast, and robust.\n\nDioxus is quite popular, almost 20k stars on GitHub, and we recently raised a sizable seed round from \"top vcs.\" We have a lot of exciting projects on the horizon:\n\n- in-place binary patching for rust hotreloading (http://github.com/jkelleyrtp/ipbp)\n\n- a WGPU powered HTML/CSS renderer (http://github.com/dioxusLabs/blitz)\n\n- experiments with LLM-based component generation (http://github.com/dioxusLabs/dioxus-ai)\n\n- upcoming mobile tooling\n\n- TUI-based devtools for a ruby-on-rail like experience\n\n- a deploy platform for web/desktop/mobile/backend and all the fun that entails...\n\nI'm looking for a founding systems engineer passionate about Rust, WASM, apps, the web, compilers, linkers, and devex - basically someone who's not afraid of anything. Dioxus is a very lean organization and we've been able to move so quickly since we keep our team small and high trust. No annoying standups or corporate bureaucracy. If you want to contribute to OSS, move the needle, and work in a startup that's closer to deeptech with hard problems, this role is for you.\n\nI'm specifically looking for people who are excited by this space and doing this type of work. If you're just looking for a job then this probably isn't the right role for you.\n\nApply on our yc page or are reach me directly at jon at dioxuslabs dot com\n\nhttps://www.ycombinator.com/companies/dioxus-labs/jobs/dRPOo...\n\nNeurosym labs | Zurich (maybe NY/Boston, maybe SF/Bay area) | ONSITE, INTERNS, VISA | Full-time\n\nI am considering starting an AI/ML research company in the field of neurosymbolic programming (which sits at the intersection of deep learning, program synthesis and probabilistic programming). The goal is to be 100% focused on producing research that is made publicly available, guided by intellectual curiosity and a desire to move the field forward.\n\nI am looking for co-founders or early employees. Although there is an existing company & office that will be ready by the end of summer, not all details are figured out yet. The location is 80% likely to be Zurich (keeping the current office), but could be in the US. The funding is privately secured by other ML-related ventures I was involved with in the past. The name is also a placeholder name and will change. I can give more details privately.\n\nRoles and compensation:\n\n- Full-time employees: base of around 100-250k USD/annum + equity with standard vesting (negotiable). - Interns or residency program: base of around 80-180k USD/annum (Other research interests: self-play, world models, common sense reasoning, program induction, causality, bayesian inference)\n\nTo apply, send me an email to b.crouzier at gmail and including \"Neurosym labs application\" in the title. Please reach out also if you just have pointers or other things you want to discuss, as I'm still exploring all options available.\n\nPinterest Advanced Technologies Group | Staff Engineer, iOS and applied ML | US remote or hybrid in SF/NY | Full-time\n\nWe’re looking for strong engineers to help us build consumer AI products within Pinterest’s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), our in-house ML research division. You’d be working with a full-stack team of ML researchers and product engineers on projects that bring LLMs, diffusion models, and other core models in the generative multimodal ML and computer vision space to life inside the Pinterest product. Projects include assistants, new ways to search, restyling of boards / pins / rooms, and many other new applications. Your work will directly impact how millions of users experience Pinterest.\n\nTracks:\n\n*iOS engineer*: You’ll craft beautiful and intuitive user experiences for our new AI products. Strong command of iOS and UI/UX craftsmanship required. Bonus points if you’re an opinionated product thinker with 0-1 mentality or have experience working with ML models.

The team consists of long-tenured employees who care deeply about both the quality of the Pinterest experience, and taking full advantage of the new capabilities emerging in the ML space over the last two years. ATG more broadly has spent the past decade+ bringing various ML technologies into the Pinterest ecosystem, and values publishing our work, building long-term infrastructure, and a collaborative and remote-friendly culture (though we do expect everyone to join company onsites a few times a year).\n\nNuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco & Remote friendly (US only)| Full-time | Visa Transfer\n\nIn the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.\n\nMoreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.\n\nHow can this be, and how can we change it?\n\nNuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.\n\nToday, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.\n\nBut -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?\n\nAbsolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.\n\nIn 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.\n\nNuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.\n\nOur dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.\n\nOpen positions include:\n\n* Senior Product Designer, Consumer\n\n* Senior Data Scientist, Algorithm Development\n\n* Sr Software Engineer, Rewards Backend\n\n* Senior Data Scientist, LLM\n\n* Senior Software Engineer, AI/ML Productionization Engineer (LLM/RAG)\n\n* Lead Software Engineer, Rewards AI/ML\n\n* Sr Flutter Mobile Software Engineer, Rewards\n\n* Lead Software Engineer, Data Platform\n\n* Lead Business Analyst\n\n* Lead Software Engineer, Program Engine\n\n* Lead Software Engineer, Developer Infrastructure\n\n* IT Manager (for engineering org, NOT operations)\n\nJobs Board: https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board\n\nFrontend: React, Typescript, Flutter (Android and iOS)\n\nBackend: Django, Python, Kotlin, Scala\n\nCloud: AWS\n\nQuestions?

It’s designed to give developers a better end-to-end user experience than traditional SQL databases. We provide a more expressive schema modeling & query language (EdgeQL), and \"batteries included\" features such as built-in schema migrations and a graphical schema browser, data explorer, and access control/auth.\n\nWe offer a hosted cloud service for EdgeDB, with the goal of doing developer-friendly cloud hosting \"the right way\" - we want users to use our hosted service because it's great, not because they're locked-in by restrictive licensing or cloud-only features.\n\nWe are looking for experienced SREs / infrastructure / devops engineers to help scale out our cloud. Unlike many infrastructure roles, this is not supporting a separate product team - for us, our infrastructure is our product.

Over the past year Radar has been used from 100M+ devices doing 10,000 qps. We are are a small but mighty engineering team (13 engineers!). Our main languages are Rust and TypeScript, and we also use languages relevant to mobile development and offline pipelines (Python, Scala, and Terraform). We're based in NYC with our HQ in Union Square. There's a ton of opportunity to make an impact and work on a variety of things, as we're a pretty fluid team: Backend (Our Rust geocoder and other high-throughput data infra), Mobile (e.g. open-source mobile infrastructure, building a control system that automatically configures optimizing battery-life and location accuracy for different use-cases over time), Full-Stack (e.g. build tools to visualize and debug location data at scale) What you'll do:\n\n- Work on core Radar infrastructure (mobile, backend, or full-stack)\n\n- Embody our \"Walk a mile\" value by walking around to QA and debug the Radar SDK\n\n- Have your work run on 100's of millions of devices\n\n- Talk to Radar customers and prospects, hear their feedback, incorporate it into your work and make them successful\n\nCheck out our jobs page here: https://radar.com/jobs#jobs\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reply here or you can e-mail me at tim@radar.com\n\nStreak | Remote Only | Staff UI Engineer | https://www.streak.com/careers/staff-ui-engineer\n\nStreak (www.streak.com) is a CRM built on Gmail. We’re a remote-first team of 35 people across North America. We’re growing and very profitable, and we have customers that love our product. We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.\n\nWe want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.\n\nLastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.\n\nLanguage REACTOR\n\nMe and Ognjen are based in BULGARIA / Serbia. Most of the time REMOTE, but, generally we like to meet up 2-3 times a year for a few weeks in a nice location.\n\nWe make software for learning languages. The focus is on making tools, rather than content. It's a competitive field. That means understanding learners' needs, and relentlessly applying ingenuity and resourcefulness to make something of value. We manage well though, and the financial side is solid.\n\nWe run bare metal servers at Hetzner, and a number of big GPU machines in Bulgaria.\n\nSalaries are ~Western European. Additionally, special effort will not be unrewarded. I can help arrange an EU Blue Card / VISA if needed. Bulgaria is Schengen now, taxes among the lowest in the EU, lots of mountains and pine trees, cost of living still relatively low. No hard rules around work hours or vacation. If you are reliably helping the project progress, and are available during critical weeks, I don't mind what time you drink your coffee or what timezone you are in.\n\nAs a minimum:\n\n-- Thoroughly comfortable writing Typescript (or experience with similar language)\n\n-- Familiarity with HTML/CSS\n\n-- ..and linux terminal.\n\nThere's a substantial amount of mostly decent code, some even pretty good. It will take some time to become familiar. Noone will be standing over your shoulder, you need to be able to make yourself useful. You will be creating new features. Somewhat open-ended, rather than just taking bug tickets. Things need to be polished and hardened before launch, and some older code needs rewriting from time to time.\n\nOther skills that would be highly useful:\n\n-- Backend skills (linux admin, ZFS backups, postgres tuning etc.)\n\n-- Knowledge around ML/DL, Python, NLP, fine-tuning LLMs, ASR and TTS.\n\n-- Strong React and CSS skills (we use MUI for our website, and have an unfinished RN Tamagui prototype).\n\n-- Doing some server hardware maintenance or upgrades (server hardware is mostly like PC hardware with some extra bits).\n\n-- Not adverse to occasional travel to meet a potential collaborator, or some occasional non-code work.\n\n-- Experience or connections in highschool/university language education.\n\n-- Knowledge of languages, particularly East Asian.\n\n-- Electronics design and manufacture (yes).\n\nI'm not adverse to teaching what I know, but then it's probably going to need to be more in-person then.\n\nI'll be honest here: this could be a dream job for some, and rather demanding for others.\n\ndioco@dioco.io\n\nNooks (https://nooks.ai) | Software Engineers (full-stack & backend/applied ML) | Full-time | Onsite in SF (hybrid)\n\nHi, I’m one of the founders of Nooks — we’re trying to re-invent how sales teams work with real-time collaboration and AI.\n\nNooks is: - A virtual office: you can work from anywhere in the world, but still work with your team and get feedback and coaching like you’re sitting side-by-side. - and an AI co-pilot. We learn how your team works, identify “winning” strategies and behaviors, then share them with the whole team during and after calls!\n\nWe’re working on fun engineering challenges including complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms & infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You'll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)\n\nRight now we’re a small eng team (~12 ppl) growing super quickly - doubling revenue every quarter, and recently hit $4M ARR!\n\nLooking for experienced engineers who love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers. Excitement about language models, few-shot learning and other recent AI advances is also a plus :)\n\nI’d love to chat: reach me at nikhil [at] nooks.in or apply at the link below: https://nooks.breezy.hr/p/bbc06c1a1bb4-software-engineer\n\nAnvil (https://anvil.works) | Senior Developer, Developer Advocate | Cambridge, UK | ONSITE, VISA | Full-time/part-time/flexible\n\nWe make an open-source web framework, an online code editor, a GUI builder, and a PaaS hosting platform. Together, you can build and host a full-stack web application - and all you need is a little Python. (Yes, even the client-side code - we compile Python to JS and provide a GUI framework!)\n\n---\n\n1. Senior Developer:\n\nWe’re looking for an experienced all-rounder to work on the core Anvil platform, with a focus on the back-end. Our stack is mostly Clojure, Javascript, Python, Postgres, and container tools – but we're looking for someone who isn't afraid to jump into something you haven't used before.\n\nYou’ll be working with other seriously good all-rounders, including the founders (relevant PhDs, kernel contributors, builders of backyard dancing fountains) and senior colleagues (eg: a former maths teacher who reverse-engineered our drag'n'drop editor just to build more UI components), as well as our other developers and developer advocates. We're bootstrapped and profitable, with a small, smart, friendly and diverse team.\n\nBuilding dev tools is great! We're solving problems we've experienced ourselves, our customers are developers just like us, and platforms have the most fun engineering problems.\n\n---\n\n2. Developer Advocate:\n\nWe’re looking for a developer with great communication skills to show people how to build awesome things with Anvil, and to make Anvil better to use.\n\nYou’ll be writing how-to guides, blog posts and tutorials, building example apps, presenting Anvil at conferences, and helping our users – from individual developers to huge companies – build their web applications. You’ll then use what you’ve learned to help us make Anvil better to use. That might mean deciding what examples to build, or it might mean deciding that we need to redesign the first-run experience for the Anvil Editor – and then doing it.\n\nIt's rewarding work – developers love being introduced to Anvil (we get mobbed at conferences!). Plus, there are all the advantages of an early-stage startup: seriously smart colleagues, small team, lots of autonomy, and huge impact. (Did I mention we're diverse, friendly and supportive?)\n\n---\n\nFor full job descriptions, and to hear what it's like working here, go to https://anvil.works/jobs.\n\nWe work hybrid (in the office Tue-Thu, wherever you like Mon/Fri).

We are currently working with some the largest names in the AI space and growing rapidly.\n\nWe have a few full-time, fully-remote roles available:\n\n1. [Entry-level OK] Data Ops Managers live between the client and the rest of the team, capturing details about the projects and coordinating between the different teams to ensure the data labeling gets done. If you're familiar or experienced with project management then this is a role you'll excel in, but we're equally open to bringing on entry-level people looking to gain experience --> https://coda.io/d/_dVweWtFuF-G/_suJlq\n\n2. [Targeting Mid-level] A role suitable for 'hackers' who enjoy working with mixtures of technologies on constant short and medium term (few weeks to a few months) projects for more custom labeling projects. In the last few weeks this has involved things like overlaying text over screen recordings with ffmpeg, SQL + Python scripts to clean and prepare data for annotation, building a Django dashboard that collates information from multiple sources, and so on. Almost all greenfield, requires coordinating with clients to interpret the project requirements, estimating the complexity and eventually choosing the right tools for the job and executing on the work. A truly 'whiteboard to deployment' role where you get to have full ownership. This team is currently just made up of senior devs, so we're largely targeting mid-level devs at the moment to round it out --> https://coda.io/d/_dVweWtFuF-G/_suZtt\n\n3. [Mid-Senior level] Customer Support Manager. Requires a decent amount of overlap with PST and PHT hours --> https://coda.io/d/_dVweWtFuF-G/_sujaL\n\nThese are exclusively full time roles -- we can't accept part time or fixed term contracts. Code-writing roles require a strong command of Python fundamentals. We are a fully distributed, remote-first company with an engineering team spread around the world. There is essentially no restriction on where you're located as long as you're able to be present for our core collaboration hours of 8am PST to 1pm PST.\n\nNo recruiting agencies or similar, we're only interested in filling the open full-time roles.\n\nPlease mention me directly or HN when applying to avoid getting caught up in the screening flow.

My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I'm an early Uber engineer.\n\nFirst, we are looking for a Community and Social Media Rep. who will put our platform in the front the eyes of the right people, foster the right kind of community and be our voice online.

We make the internet a bit better every day by winning over customers currently using Google reCAPTCHA.\n\nWe’re a fast-growing, profitable, fully bootstrapped company. Our revenue mostly comes from medium to large European enterprise and governments.\n\nWe are currently hiring for two roles: a DevOps infra-focused Engineer, and a (polyglot) Integrations Engineer.\n\nFor the DevOps engineer a great fit would be a pragmatic builder who prefers to keep things simple (perhaps boring is the right word?). We prefer to design so that we don't need a dedicated team to maintain any part. You should be productive in Go, and a good knowledge of modern DevOps/SRE practices is expected (IaC, GitOps, etc...).\n\nFor the Integrations Engineer it's perhaps less well defined. We think investing in a great developer experience through documentation, SDKs and plugins will pay dividends - and it makes sense for us to grow our team in that direction. The role involves helping us build integrations and plugins for various platforms, but also talking to customers to learn where we can improve. We think the right hire will shape the role themselves.\n\nOur engineering team is remote across Europe, we meet up once per quarter or so. You can work either 4 or 5 days per week, remote or (partially) from our Munich office.

We are a small team of sharp and motivated engineers working on advancing the art of data analysis and visualization for everyone from business analysts to data scientists. And we're looking for talented and interested engineers to join us.\n\nProspective is a professional toolchain for analyzing and visualizing data on your local machine. It's a graphical tool that runs in a web browser and is able to slice and dice gigabytes of static or realtime data. It's built on the popular OSS framework Perspective https://github.com/finos/perspective . Prospective runs as WebAssembly in modern browsers, so it's fast, portable, and memory-efficient. It has its own in-memory data store, but can also plug into any database or streaming platform with a straightforward adapter API. Prospective integrates with existing data tools like Python and Jupyter, and all the dashboards created can be shared to ease collaboration. Our goal is to expand beyond financial services and become the standard toolchain for anyone whose job is to make sense and find patterns in large datasets.\n\nProspective offers a great opportunity to dig into complex software. On any given day we might be optimizing how the database executes queries in C++, implementing API features in Rust, writing new language bindings for our API, speeding up our Bazel build process, or implementing new charting or query features in our graphical UI. Prospective is engineered to be fast and stable. We write good tests, and once a bug is fixed it stays fixed.\n\nOur team has a culture of mentorship and collaboration, and we work with each other knowing that every team member is always either teaching or learning. We pair-program regularly as a way to share our thinking and get feedback on our solutions. We hold each other to a high quality bar for performance and aesthetics, a constraint that we think creates a healthy environment for creative problem-solving. Every day has a brief \"stand up\" in the morning and a \"stand down\" in the afternoon to share what we've learned and what we're stuck on. Every Friday afternoon we demo what we're building for each other, which we call \"dogfooding\". And we talk regularly to our users, both paid and open-source, to create product feedback loops to understand where the rough edges are and what folks find extremely valuable.\n\nWe'd love to chat with you if you have experience in WebAssembly, Python native extensions, C++, Rust or Jupyter. But regardless of your experience, we're very intentionally looking for people who are interested, motivated, and passionate about deeply learning WebAssembly and pushing the boundaries of what a browser can do. We believe smart, passionate people will channel that energy into learning how the tech stack works; and we believe that aligning people's work with their interests correlates with long term business success. We're currently looking for two additional engineers to join our five-person team. We're open to more-junior and more-senior engineers, and are committed to making a competitive offer based on experience and skill level.\n\nContact andrew@prospective.dev\n\nRollbar | https://rollbar.com | Remote US, Remote Europe, Budapest | Engineering, Technical Solutions\n\nAbout Rollbar:\n\n* We're a ~30-person team (SF, Budapest, remote US and Europe) with a mission to help developers build software quickly and painlessly\n\n* We help tens of thousands of developers find and fix errors faster.\n\n* Our backend handles billions of errors with low latency and high reliability\n\n* Our front-end allows developers to discover and drill down across millions of errors in real-time\n\n* Our customers are some of the best engineering teams in the world, including Twilio and Shipt\n\n* Our values are honesty, transparency, pragmatism, and dependability\n\n* Our tech stack includes Python, Node.js, TypeScript, and React; MySQL, Kafka, ClickHouse, Elasticsearch, and Redis; Kubernetes, Terraform, and Google Cloud Platform.\n\nWe're currently hiring for:\n\n- Senior Software Engineer, Full-stack (Europe)\n\n- Senior Software Engineer, Front-end (US)\n\n- Product Solutions Architect (US)\n\nPlease apply via: https://rollbar.com/careers/\n\nSpacelift | Remote | Europe | Full-time | Senior Software Engineer | $80k-$120k\n\nWe're a VC-funded startup building an automation platform for Infrastructure-as-Code, adding a Policy-as-Code layer above it, in order to make IaC usable in bigger companies, where you have to take care of state consistency, selective permissions, a usable git flow, etc.\n\nOn the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives.

And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog[5] and YouTube channel[6].\n\nWe have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy & we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can \"choose their own loss function\". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders & problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)\n\nWe're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales & field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.\n\n[1]: https://roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring0624\n\n[2]: https://roboflow.com/universe?ref=whoishiring0624\n\n[3]: https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill\n\n[4]: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision\n\n[5]: https://blog.roboflow.com/?ref=whoishiring0624\n\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/@Roboflow\n\nBonside | Senior Full Stack Engineer | New York City (NYC) | Onsite few days a week | https://bonside.com/\n\nBonside is an NYC-based fintech startup providing financing to brick-and-mortar businesses (https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/bonside-growth-capital-bri...).
