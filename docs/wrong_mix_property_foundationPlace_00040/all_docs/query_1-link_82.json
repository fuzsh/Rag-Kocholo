The use of funds from the city’s surplus to offset increased budget figures, Including salary raises and an accelerated pro¬ gram of public works, kept the tax rate from going even higher. The amount of surplus funds ap¬ plied to taxes was $252,378.98 from Surplus Available and $381,- 687.15 from the Water Depart¬ ment. The upward revision in the estimated receipts from income and corporation taxes announc¬ ed by State Tax Commissioner Long, was also a factor in keep¬ ing the rate from going still higher.

Bradford has signed House Bill No. 201, in¬ troduced by Rep. George E. Rawson of Newton. This act, now kryown as Chapter 353 of the Acts of 1947, provides that a state-wide recount of votes in our election shall not be made on be¬ half of any candidate for gov¬ ernor, lieutenant governor, sec¬ retary, treasurer, auditor, at- toney general or U. S. Senator whose total of votes is more than half of 1 per cent less than that of the winning candidate. It repeals a previous law under which a losing candidate could leave a recount if he was not more than 1 per cent behind the winner. This gave rise to numer¬ ous recounts for state-wide office which cost the Commonwealth and the cities and towns large amounts of money, and yet have never unseated a winning can¬ didate. The most expensive of all was the Kelley-Barnes recount for attorney general in 1944.

Fielding, Monager Entered ns scrotid-rlM* mail matter nt the post office at Boston, Mass., under the Act of March 3, 1879 The War Against Fire Intensifies Tn a recent address, W. E. Mallalieu, general manager of the National Board of Fire Underwriters, observed that the war against fire has made great progress. Thousands of lives and enormous sums in property values have been saved by organized prevention work. But this is not enough. Fire waste is in¬ excusably high. There are now more than 800,000 fires each year in this coun¬ try. Our dollar fire loss is at an all-time record level. If the present rate of increase is maintained, this loss will reach the shocking figure of $1,000,000,000 a year by 1950. Mr. Mallalieu spoke of what has been accomplished in dealing with other menaces to human life and welfare. Diph¬ theria took a toll of 125 lives for each 100.000 of the population in 1885—in 1945 it took but 1.2. In 1885 typhoid accounted for 50 deaths per 100,000 Americans—now it has been practi¬ cally wiped out. So it goes, down a long list. Comparable progress can be made in controlling the menace of fire-r-if only we attack it with determination. The recently-concluded President's Conference on Fire Pre¬ vention, in Washington. D. C., was a milestone in the battle against fire. Some 3000 delegates, representing even- state, at¬ tended, and they will bring to their regions an all-inclusive program for dealing with every phase of the fire problem. But they cannot do the job alone. Success will depend upon the active, informed support of the public at large. Congress has an imperative duty to protect the workers. Congress must not be intimidated or coerced by threats that labor union bosses will call strikes and promote labor strife if Congress dares to do its duty. . . . Honest unions, democratically operated unions, unions that can hold their own in any debate in a court of public opinion when the true facts arc permitted to come to light would be a credit to American democracy. Union bosses who operate and control unions with the totalitarian tech¬ niques of fascist dictators cannot be tolerated in free America. —David Lawrence. Politics With Color by 1*. w. t:.

Maine, has been won by Patricia Ann Blake, daughter of Rev. and Mrs. William E. Blake of 40 Lincoln park, West Newton. A senior at Nevyton High School, Miss Blake is editor-in- chief of the Newtonian, the school year book, and is a mem¬ ber of Orange Shield and the school legislature. She was elected to the National Honor So- i ciety in her Junior year. She is vite-president of the Tusitala Club and was secretary of the Art Club in her Sophomore year and treasurer in her Junior year. Her father is pastor of the Lin¬ coln Park Baptist Church. Cornelius Dalton of the Boston Traveler has a very smart 1 political mind. Many readers of the Herald-Traveler have not, j perhaps, realized this fact, partly because William E. Mul¬ lins of the Herald is given more publicity by his employers. The point I wish to make now is that Dalton has probably given his readers the best explanation i to date of the whys and where- 1 fores of the gradual decline in 1 prestige of our fine young Governor. It is quite simple. Governor Bradford is one of the very few Chief Executives in this State who has NOT come to the top via the State Legis¬ lature. It would require some research on my part to find more than one or two Governors who did not, at some time in their careers, serve in one of the two branches of the Legis¬ lature. Off hand, my impression is that former Governor Alvan T. Fuller did not serve in cither ! 1 branch. Calvin Coolidge and i Frank G. Allen were President j of the Senate before their elec¬ tion as Governor. Channing H. Cox and Leverett Saltonstall were both Speakers of the House. Cox also served as Lt. Governor, whereas Saltonstall jumped straight to the - Gover¬ nor's chair. In the interest of | strict accuracy it should be mentioned that the amazing Frankie Kelly defeated Leverett Saltonstall for Lt. Governor prior to our Senior U. S. Sen¬ ator's election as Governor in the fall of 1938. Now, the idea is simply this. Any man who sits in either branch of our State Legislature gets to know “the boys” and all their various methods and prae* tices. It is just like President Truman’s position in relation to Congress. Mr. Truman, having served in the U. S. Senate, has a great advantage over men 4ike the two Roosevelts, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. If my memory serves me none of these Presidents served in Congress prior to their Presi¬ dential terms. There is scarcely a week during which some politi¬ cal writer or radio commentator Prince Albert gave Victoria a golden ring fashioned as a snake composed wf fourteen hinged i joints, twelve of them set with | diamonds. docs not comment on the Presi¬ dent’s ability to get along amic¬ ably with Congress, despite the fact that the G.O.P. is in control. He knows just how to handle the average Democrat, except, of course, some of the more recalcitrant Southern Congress¬ men. Mr. Truman knows how these gentlemen operate arid he is able to avoid all sorts of headaches and mistakes. In Massachusetts, however, we have a Governor who jumped directly from the position of District Attorney of Middlesex County to the Lt. Governorship. Later on he was elected Gover¬ nor. Of course. Governor Brad¬ ford numbers among his friends and acquaintances a great many of our politicians and statesmen, if I may make a subtle distinc¬ tion. He had not however had the benefit of close association with them in either of the two legis¬ lative branches. As a result he has not, apparently, appreciated the tremendous importance of keeping in constant touch, not only with the big leaders of the Legislature but also with, as many as possible of the rank and file. Some of these gentle¬ men are extremely sensitive about their prerogatives and responsibilities. If they think the Governor is going over their head or in any way by-passing them, they resent it and I mean resent. What I am getting at in somewhat roundabout fashion is the Governor’s tax program and the manner in which it seems to have bogged down. First Rep. Dickie of Reading and then the powerful Rep. Henry L. Shattuck of the Back Bay have publicly turned thumbs down on the sales tax. It occurs to some of us that it would have been smart for the Governor to have ascertained just where .these men stood before publicly announcing his program. To be sure, Governor Bradford may have done just that and may have learned of their objections to part of his program and then decided to go ahead anyway. Perhaps he could think of no other solution to the terrifically difficult taxation problem. Even so, it does seem unfortunate that the Governor should have gone so far out on a limb, only to have the members of his own party cut it off. My Impression, at the moment, is that the salcs-tax is. dead as a door nail for the current session of the Legislature and that the balance of the recommended legislation will probably be passed. That will mean that one of the two major parties will be forced to propose some other means of raising money before the Legislature adjourns. The chances are that som ( c relatively half-baked and therefore un¬ satisfactory legislation will be hurried through prior to the close of the session. Too bad. PENDING LEGISLATION May I suggest that my readers keep a close watch on the Legislature for the balance of this session. Watch what happens to pending Elevated legislation; also the taxation situation. Newtonians are aware of the fact that one of our residents is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Boston Elevated. This influential gentleman is Edward E. Whit¬ ing of Newtonville. Present in¬ dications are that the present Elevated bill will go through. It has already passed its second reading. To be sure, even under the proposed Metropolitan set¬ up, there may not be many, if any, changes in the personnel of the public trustees. Here again, our Governor is being subjected to considerable pres¬ sure to promise to appoint certain gentlemen as the new trustees. Watch this. P.W.C. PffiCf tfRIN&V^NflVTON EUCrftKAPPtIMtf (0.

Thus far the number of donors needed to fill Newton’s require¬ ments has not been reached! It can only be reached by every one’s cooperation. All healthy people between the ages of 18 and 60 are eligible. If you have given before, you know it takes only a half hour of your time; and you quickly remake the blood and feel no after-effects. But if you have never given, this is your opportunity to par¬ ticipate in a program designed to protect you and the members l of your family. Remember a | pint of your blood and a half hour of your time assures any member of your family the blood they may need FREE OF CHARGE any time in the year ahead. This is vitally essential Insurance to every resident of Newton. Can you overlook this opportunity to help those who need blood NOW . . . and pro¬ tect your family in the year ahead. The Newton Methodist Church is sponsoring the 16th of June. The Bloodmobile of the Massa¬ chusetts Department of Public health will be at the Chtirch from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. on that day to receive blood for the State blood bank.

Veduccio- (Continued from Page 1) undergoing treatment In the Middlesex County Sanitarium and countless others in hospitals throughout the state. While veterans’ organizations and their auxiliaries visit the larger. hospitals to cheer their comrades, Chief Veduccio con¬ tinued, similar calls are seldom made at the smaller institutions where only a few of the tuber¬ cular veterans can be accom¬ modated, creating the impres¬ sion among the lonely ones that they have given their all, only to be forgotten and forsaken. The Murphy General Hospital, the chief concluded, would be Ideal for the purpose of treating tubercular veterans in eastern Massachusetts, the hospital in Rutland to care for those in the west. The veterans’ administra¬ tion, organizations and associa¬ tions should make every effort to obtain the hospital, he added, for the centralization of all that modern medical science can muster in an all out offensive against the dread disease, and for the definite step-up its acqui¬ sition would give the ebbing morale of the men fighting their own personal battle for life.

Mayor Paul M. Goddard will extend the greetings of the city and the guest speaker will be Hugh H. Clegg, Assistant Director, Fed¬ eral Bureau of Investigation with headquarters at Washing¬ ton, D. C. Mr. Clegg is the ideal speaker for such an occasion. He is a native of Missisippi and entered the service of the F.B.I. over twenty years ago, as a Special Agent, then graduated from the ranks, and continued climbing until he reached his present high position in the world’s leading law enforcement unit. Mr. Clegg served as a special agent for sev¬ eral years, then was assigned as Special Agent in charge of sev¬ eral of the Country’s important field offices, including Chicago, I1L, and Washington, D. C. In the early 1930’s he was brought to Headquarters at Washington. During the plague of terror kid¬ nappings and bank robberies in the 30’s he was extremely active in the arrests of a number of the Nation’s \"Public Enemies,” whose names were universally known. Since 1935, he has been Asst. Director in charge of the Divi¬ sion of Training and Inspection of the F.B.I. This Division super¬ vises the training of all recruits U. S.

S. and possessions, Canada, Great Britain and China. The speaker’s practical experience combined with a thorough knowledge of the theoretical and scientific as¬ pects of law enforcement, makes him the appropriate man to ad¬ dress a group of police officers. The graduation exercises will be public and citizens of New¬ ton, Needham and Weston who may wish to attend will enjoy an interesting program and will also get an insight into how their first line of defense is keeping pace with the perpetual enemy \"Crime.” Chief Veduccio plans to make the training school a permanent unit of our Police Department.
