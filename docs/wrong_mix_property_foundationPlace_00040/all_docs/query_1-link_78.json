        "text": "a worldwide community of legal scholars working in the fields of property, construction and the built environment. Its focus is on the application of law in these contexts and our membership includes those with expertise in property, construction, housing, planning and environmental law as well as the many other areas of law which impact on the wider built environment. Its activities embrace all forms of legal scholarship including theoretical, doctrinal, empirical and comparative law research. Our international membership provides us with a unique opportunity to undertake collaborative comparative law studies across multiple jurisdictions and we welcome enquiries from legal scholars worldwide who would\n\nIn recent times, with the increase in population, land areas that can accommodate the traditional school design model are becoming difficult to come by in urban areas or expensive. Therefore, for urban schools to accommodate the increasing population, school designs have shifted from outward horizontal arrangements to upward vertical designs. Consequently, this study examined the compliance of vertical accessibility components in high-rise buildings in Covenant University, Ota in Nigeria, with universal design strategies, with a view to identifying areas for further improvements, towards contributing to ways of promoting social inclusion in educational environments. The research is a qualitative case study of a tertiary institution that investigated two high-rise buildings on the university campus. An observation guide developed for the study and a digital camera were used to collect primary field data. The data were content analysed and presented using descriptive approach with the aid of texts and pictures. The findings revealed that ramps, steps/staircases and lifts are the vertical accessibility components provided in the high-rise buildings, all of which were found to exhibit various levels of inconsistencies with universal design strategies. One of the key recommendations of the study is to retrofit the buildings with necessary accessible features where they are lacking or inappropriately provided, where possible. The study will be useful to researchers, students, educators, policy makers and building design professionals in addressing issues relating to universal design of the built environment, particularly as it relates to the provision of equitable vertical movement features in high-rise public buildings.\n\nIn terms of the building development construction or space with the designation as activity place and mass facility, it must comply with the rules of standards safety, security, convenience and comfort building as well as standards requairement. Accessibility in a building is very important, especially the building as a place of activity or public services, such as a lecture hall building which of course will accommodate a large number of people. For those reasons a good planing that can meet the security and safety requirements in the building itself from the impact of unwanted natural disasters. This study evaluates the existing condition of accessibility in the lecture building of the architecture department of the Musamus University of Merauke. The results of this study are the results of measurements and assessments of the physical condition of the building against the technical standard regulations that have been set by the government, the building of the lecture hall building..."
