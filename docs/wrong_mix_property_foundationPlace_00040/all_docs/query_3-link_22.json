What can I use instead of \"birthplace\" in this sentence?\n\nMy birthplace, Venice, is known as one of the most charming cities on the planet.\n\nI would use \"birthplace\" solely for the place I was actually born. I'd use hometown for the town I grew up in. In my case, for example, I was born in Heston*, we lived in Brumley* until I was 2 years 11 months old, then we moved to Shettenbridge* where I grew up and where, with the exception of a couple of brief sojourns to other places, I still live. (*I haven't used the real town names for obvious reasons!)\n\nTherefore, for me, my birthplace was Heston, my hometown is Shettenbridge, and I really wouldn't mention Brumley at all because I was very young and I remember nothing about it.\n\nFor some reason, I would always say 'place of birth' rather than 'birthplace' if I used the noun.\n\nCome to think of it, so would I. I think it's probably because that's how it's worded on most forms we fill in in the UK.\n\nI would use \"birthplace\" solely for the place I was actually born.

What would you call them then?\n\nI would use \"birthplace\" solely for the place I was actually born. I'd use hometown for the town I grew up in.

I never lived in the city where I was born. There's no hospital in the place that is my hometown."
