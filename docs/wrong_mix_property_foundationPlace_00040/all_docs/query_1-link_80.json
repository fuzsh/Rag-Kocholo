But there are specific people to whom I am especially indebted. While these individuals share in the quality of the book, any errors or limitations are mine alone. My thanks go to Song Jiaheng, who taught me how to be a scholar and introduced me to Canadian studies at Shandong University; Peter Mitchell, who has never let me down as a good mentor and who introduced me to the topic and to the Menzies family; William Westfall, Margo Gewurtz, and Bernard Luk, who supervised the writing process of the thesis; Bernard Frolic, who taught me Sino-Canadian relations; Bob Wakabayashi, who introduced me to Japanese culture and history; and Alvyn Austin, who patiently read the second draft of the thesis, correcting my writing almost sentence by sentence, and reformatted the thesis for publication, making it more interesting. Marion, Frances, and Arthur Menzies, James's children, allowed me unconditional access to the family collection of letters and manuscripts. Fang Hui shared his thoughts on Menzies's scholarship.

The ground had just been harrowed for cotton planting, and the farmers had thrown the freshly ploughed up potsherds and rubble to the edge of the fields. A number of potsherds of a very early date attracted the rider's attention, and led him on from sherd to sherd to a bend in the river ... This was the Waste of Yin.1\n\nThe young man on the old horse was a Canadian Presbyterian missionary named James Mellon Menzies and the year was 1914, the third spring of the Republic of China. The place was a village named Xiao tun (old spelling Hsiao-t'un), literally 'Little Village,' on the broad North China Plain in North Henan (old spelling Honan). Menzies was an unusual missionary, for he was educated initially as a civil engineer and Dominion land surveyor, and had spent his summers surveying the northern Ontario bush. Although he had been in China for only three and a half years and at Zhangde (which he spelled Changte) for only a couple of months, he had heard of an ancient ruin nearby. As he made his evangelistic tours of the rural districts, he knew what he was looking for, and when he found it, with eyes trained to see signs on the surface of the earth as indicators of what lay below, he understood its significance. He believed he was guided by providence that day, for as he reflected years later: 'God seemed to guide me when he placed in my hands the discovery of the \"Oracle Bones,\" the actual relics of the ancient religious life of the Chinese at 1400-1200 B.C.'2 The discovery of the 'Waste of Yin' and its excavation by the Academia Sinica after 1928 was as important to the archaeology of ancient China\n\n4 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nas Howard Carter's discovery of King Tut's tomb (1923) was to Egyptian archaeology or Leonard Woolley's work at Ur of the Chaldees was to Mesopotamian. The Waste of Yin was as spectacular as the famous, more recent discovery of the pottery army of the First Emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, at Xian - and a thousand years older. About 1395 BCE (traditional) or 1300 BCE (revised), China's formative Bronze Age civilization known as the Shang dynasty (1766-1122 BCE traditional, 1700-1045 BCE revised) constructed its seventh and last capital city at a bend in the Huan River about seventy miles north of the Yellow River. They called the place Yin and renamed the dynasty itself Yin, the Shang-Yin. Twelve Shang kings ruled at Yin for 273 years, until 1122/1045 BCE, when the Shang was conquered by the Zhou people. The Zhou sacked the city so completely that it was known to history as Yin-xu, the Waste (or ruins) of Yin. The ancient records that survived the book burning of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, are fragmentary and over the millennia the location of Yin was forgotten. Several centuries later, a city was built near the site: named Anyang, it was later renamed Zhangde and relatively recently has reverted to its old name of Anyang. By the beginning of the twentieth century, some historians doubted the existence of the Shang, viewing it as, at best, a 'semilegendary' state like its supposed predecessor, the Xia (old spelling Hsia) dynasty. In 1899, an eminent Qing (old spelling Ch'ing) scholar named Wang Yirong made a startling discovery in Beijing. When an illness occurred in his family, the prescribed medicines included something called 'dragon bones.' These had been used in Chinese medicine as far back as the Han dynasty (206 BCE-221 CE) to treat illnesses such as dysentery, gallstones, fevers and convulsions in children, internal swellings, paralysis, women's diseases, and malaria. Similarly, 'dragon teeth' were also used to appease unrest of the heart and calm the soul. In both north and south China, ancient bone fossils served as 'dragon bones.' To Wang Yirong's great astonishment, he found 'chicken scratches' on the bones that looked like primitive Chinese characters. Although he was a scholar of ancient bronze and stone inscriptions, he could not decipher the characters except for a few simple ideographs. The Book of Shang in the Book of History, one of the five Confucian Classics, speaks of the Shang custom of divination using animal bones, usually the plastron (lower shell) of turtles or the scapula of sheep or oxen. Wang realized these inscribed 'dragon bones' were actually oracle bones containing the oldest form of Chinese writing. It is difficult to exaggerate the\n\nIntroduction 5 importance of Wang's discovery. It revolutionized Chinese paleography and paved the way for the development of archaeological science in China. Wang immediately ordered his servant to purchase all available inscribed dragon bones from drugstores in Beijing. Since the dealers were loath to reveal their sources, Wang never discovered that they came from the Little Village at a bend in the Huan River. James Menzies, a shy, almost self-effacing man, never claimed that he had discovered the Waste of Yin: the villagers had known and used those ancient bones for centuries, after all. Rather he was, he claimed, 'the first foreign or Chinese archaeologist to visit the Waste of Yin with a purely scientific interest in these objects' (italics added). Shard by shard, he became the foremost non-Chinese expert on Bronze Age China and helped decipher the oracle bone script. The collecting of potsherds and fragments of bone - so many that his missionary colleagues nicknamed him affectionately 'Old Bones' - started as a hobby, but became his obsession. Working with Western and Chinese colleagues, he helped create the field of scientific archaeology and taught the first related university course (in Chinese), at Cheeloo (pinyin Qilu) University in Jinan, Shandong province. Above all, James Menzies became a collector of oracle bone fragments and an expert on deciphering the ancient script. In the last hundred years, the Waste of Yin has yielded about 150,000 pieces of inscribed oracle bones. Excluding those destroyed by warlord soldiers, the extant inscribed oracle bones collected by Menzies total 35,913 pieces, to which he added another 23,000 ancient artefacts. To put this effort in context, he gathered the largest private collection of oracle bones on the meagre salary of an ordinary missionary. It was mainly through his own economy that he helped collect and preserve these Chinese cultural treasures. The Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto approached him several times to act as its purchasing agent in China, but Menzies declined because he had no interest in sending art and artefacts out of China to be 'preserved' in the West. With his strong religious motivation, he conducted his collecting activities according to a set of principles and ethical standards that set him apart from other collectors. He did not collect clandestinely. He bought from the peasants around him or simply picked up bits of bones from the fields outside his station at Zhangde. He collected in China, for China, and intended to leave his collection in China. After Menzies refused the ROM's request, his place was taken by Bishop William Charles White, bishop of the adjoining Anglican mission\n\n6 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nat Kaifeng in southern Henan. Between 1923 and 1934, White sent an astounding number of ancient and medieval Chinese art to Toronto, making the ROM Chinese collections supposedly the largest in the world outside of China. Then war intervened. In 1936 James Menzies left for a furlough in Canada, without knowing that he would never be able to return. The next year, North China was occupied by Japanese armies, and Cheeloo University was forced to evacuate to Free China in Sichuan. Since he could not return, Menzies utilized his 'detention' in Canada by volunteering his services to the ROM and registering at the University of Toronto as a PhD candidate. He wrote his dissertation on the Shang Ko (pinyin ge), the typical bronze weapon of the Shang, and received his PhD in 1942. He spent the rest of the war working first for the United States Office of War Information in San Francisco and then the State Department in Washington as a China expert. His working career was ended by two heart attacks in 1946. Until his formal retirement in 1953 he continued to push his mission board to send him back to China to complete his mission there. However, the rapidly changing political situation in China made his plans impossible to realize. To the very end of his life, Menzies kept both his commitment to the missionary enterprise in China and an active interest in Chinese culture and archaeology. The life and work of James M. Menzies has never been told - perhaps, some might assert, deliberately. Menzies's 'true story' includes a significant intersection with the story of Bishop White. This book raises serious questions regarding Bishop White. The 1920s, when White gathered the astounding collection later housed within the ROM, began a 'now or never' period, a window of ten to twelve years when North China was stripped of many of its ancient treasures. In 1920-1 Henan suffered the worst famine in modern history; in 1922, 1923, 1925, and 1927-8, it was civil war; in 1937, the Japanese invasion. Modernization seemed equally destructive as railways levelled burial mounds and motor roads cut through city walls. Poverty and warlordism combined to create both the means and the justification for large-scale exportation of Chinese art and artefacts. At bargain costs, many public and private collections in Western countries benefited enormously from those conditions. The ROM, through its agent, Bishop White, was one that benefited greatly. There have always been questions concerning Bishop White's collecting. 'It required ingenuity, imagination, and diplomacy,' his biographer Lewis C. Walmsley wrote diplomatically. 'It required too the mind of a detective to trace accurately the origin of artifacts, and even more to\n\nIntroduction 7\n\ndistinguish between genuine objects and forgeries. It demanded patience, insight, and a quick alertness to what was happening in the Chinese archaeological world if one were to be first on the scene of each new discovery and procure its choicest treasures. Beyond that, it called for a man of position who could deal with unscrupulous officials.'3 The official history of the ROM, The Museum Makers, is more candid: concerning White's correspondence with C.T. Currelly, the museum's founder and director, Lovat Dickson wrote: 'Reading through the hundreds of letters that passed between them, one sometimes has the eerie feeling of listening to the whispered conversation of conspirators.'4 Indeed, the Menzies/White relationship raises the issue of 'intellectual property.' That is a very modern term, and in this earlier era it was rarely raised in academic circles. Initially, as the museum's purchasing agent, White relied on Menzies's direct experience with the Waste of Yin materials for decisions on the authenticity and provenance of artefacts. Later, when White began lecturing and publishing on the ROM collection, the question of academic originality ('intellectual property') came into play. Menzies complained to C.T. Currelly that White's treatment of him as a doctoral student and research assistant was 'inhuman, for he seemed to take an unholy delight in forcing me to tell him what he would then pass off as his own research. A dozen times a day and often for long stretches of time, he would question me on the objects on which he was lecturing to his classes,' and then hold the lecture within Menzies's earshot. Finally, in desperation, Menzies asked Currelly to stop White from publishing two monographs that contained information and ideas 'borrowed' from Menzies's PhD thesis.5 These are serious charges worthy of detailed examination. Although this issue has been well known within the North Henan mission family and whispered in the ROM itself, this book is the first direct examination of the full details of the two men's relationship. One can say that L.C. Walmsley, Bishop White's successor as head of the Department of East Asiatic Studies at the University of Toronto, in his biography of White deliberately obfuscated the bishop's relationship with Menzies. This book is the corrective, attempting to set the record straight. I do not intend to be judgmental but rather to let the facts and documents speak for themselves. This biography of James Mellon Menzies is not limited to his life. Instead, it examines the complex world of this rural evangelist turned missionary scholar who tried to 'negotiate' with multiple forces: Christian missions and imperialism, Chinese nationalism and intellectual\n\n8 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nstudies. This book tries to shed new light on the modern encounter between China and the West, especially the missionary enterprise. The theoretical framework is neither the 'impact/response' dichotomy nor the post-colonial theories of 'orientalism' and 'cultural imperialism.' Although such general theories do raise important questions about power and coercion, they can also force historical figures into categories that limit multidimensional historical analysis. To highlight the issues that Menzies had to negotiate, I try to put his life and work in the historical context in which he lived. For this purpose, I refrain from applying generic explanations. Instead, historical data from family and archival collections in Canada and China, supplemented by personal recollections, are given the opportunity to play the major role in this reconstructed historical drama. Hence, this study intends to capture the intricate relationship among the forces in modern Chinese history through a detailed study of the complex life of one individual missionary. In the past two decades, a number of studies of Canadian missions to China have been published.6 They have explored a wide range of issues such as missions' history, the transfer of medical knowledge, educational reform, famine relief, and rural reconstruction. They focus essentially on the secular aspects of Canadian missions without attempting to evaluate the religious work of the missions in the Chinese context, since few have been able to utilize Chinese archival and oral-history materials. One of the few that does is Karen Minden's history of the medical college at West China Union University, Bamboo Stone: The Evolution of a Chinese Medical Elite.7 As a result, they are told from a Canadian perspective. This study's use of Chinese materials provides another level of understanding. The missionary encounter in China was dynamic in nature and multiple in interaction, as the growing scholarship on China missions attests. The story of both Protestant and Catholic missions has to be presented from multiple perspectives. It has been recognized that one lasting contribution of the mission enterprise, far eclipsing their evangelical efforts, was their involvement in China's educational modernization and the transfer of Western medical knowledge and skills. Yet, as Jean-Paul Wiest has observed, treating mission history like secular history deprives it of its religious dimension; therefore, study of the missionary enterprise has to be conducted at two levels, the historical as well as the theological.8 In this study, both secular and theological aspects of James Menzies's missionary life and work are examined in a balanced approach. Since most studies of Canada's involvement in China missions are\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nessentially Canadian, they fail to recognize the two-way dialogue in which Canadian missionaries were involved. I have tried to reconstruct, as much as possible, this two-way dialogue as experienced by James M. Menzies. It is based on primary sources from both China and Canada, supported by secondary sources in English and Chinese. The most important primary source is the extensive Menzies Family Papers, which are used here for the first time. These are currently at the Ottawa home of Arthur Redpath Menzies, James's son.9 In addition, I have interviewed people who knew Menzies in China and Canada, including his students, Chinese and Canadian scholars, members of his family, and other Canadian 'mish kids.' To verify and supplement this personal information, I have consulted the major Canadian archives. The United Church of Canada Archives contains the records of the North Henan mission, which was Presbyterian from 1888 to 1925 and United Church after 1925. The University of Toronto Archives has a useful biography file, as well as records of the University YMCA and the Student Volunteer Movement. Bishop White's papers are divided among three archives. The Anglican Church of Canada General Synod Archives contains his mission correspondence. His correspondence as museum collector and curator are in the Royal Ontario Museum and the files of the Registrar's Office and the Far Eastern department in the University of Toronto Archives. His personal and scholarly papers are in the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto. These contain two files often letters from Menzies to White between 1928 and 1934, and one letter from White to Menzies, as well as a copy of Menzies's doctoral thesis, annotated in White's hand. These are discussed in later chapters. Other North American archives include those of the Harvard-Yenching Institute at Harvard University and the Yale Divinity School. Chinese sources include the records of Cheeloo University, Shandong University, the Shandong Provincial Archives, Shandong Provincial Museum, the Nanjing Museum, and the Beijing Palace Museum. In addition to theoretical considerations, this study tries to make a specific contribution to the study of Canada's role in the China missionary movement. As Peter Mitchell and Margo Gewurtz pointed out when they established the Missionary Studies Program at the University of Toronto - York University Joint Centre for Asia Pacific Studies: Canada's relations with East Asia demonstrate the need for fuller understanding of the missionary movement, both at home and overseas. While\n\n10 Cross Culture and Faith still an underdeveloped colony evolving into conscious nationhood, Canada eagerly joined this international missionary effort ... Until well into the twentieth century, the Canadian presence in East Asia was a missionary presence. While diplomatic and economic ties lagged far behind, East Asia became the dominant focus of Canadian mission enthusiasm, as Canadians became the third or fourth largest national group among mission communities in China, Japan, and Korea.10\n\nThe first chapters of this book discuss the early life of James Mellon Menzies chronologically. He was born in 1885 at Clinton, Ontario, and lived at several places in rural Ontario before attending high school in Leamington. His grandparents, who had emigrated from Scotland fifty years earlier, bequeathed their piety to the family. Although his family was conventionally religious, he had little opportunity to attend church or Sunday school since Clinton lacked a Presbyterian church. Many missionary biographies stress the influence of a pious mother or an inspiring minister, but Menzies came to his missionary calling when he enrolled in 1904 at the School of Practical Science, the engineering faculty at the University of Toronto. He quickly came under the influence of the fervent missionary enthusiasm then sweeping the college students. He became active in the YMCA and the Student Volunteer Movement, the foremost recruiting agency for college-educated missionaries, whose watchword was the expansive 'Evangelization of the World in This Generation.' Since the Canadian Presbyterian church did not employ so-called secular missionaries (even male doctors and educationalists had to be ordained), Menzies attended Knox College, the Presbyterian seminary at the University of Toronto, graduating in 1910. A few months later, he was on his way to China as an evangelist of the North Henan Mission, which in 1925 became the North China Mission of the United Church of Canada. He spent more than two decades in North Henan (1910-32), making evangelistic tours of rural towns and villages, building schools, and even finding opportunities to apply his civil-engineering knowledge. The main issues of these early chapters are rural evangelism and Menzies's reflection on missionary policies under the challenge of militant Chinese nationalism. His declining interest in rural evangelism and increasing interest in Chinese culture brought him into direct conflict with his conservative mission. His tenure in China was broken by a three-and-a-half-year interlude as captain in the Chinese Labour Corps during the First World War, which\n\nIntroduction 11 sheds light on an overlooked aspect of that war. In 1917, before China entered the war, the British government recruited 100,000 labourers mainly from Shandong to act as non-combatant workers in France. This was considered an important part of the British war effort, but its operations in China and France were entrusted mainly to Chinesespeaking missionaries. Like other young men from North Henan, Menzies had to choose between God and King when the British government pressured them to enlist in the Chinese Labour Corps. The later chapters dealing with Menzies's advancing years are more thematic, as they explore the mind of a scholar. Although Menzies became a recognized archaeologist, he did not feel that scholarship and Christian higher education were ends in themselves, but rather were the means or components of a new evangelism: a living church led by educated Chinese Christians aided by an indigenized gospel. This was far different from the old evangelism imported by foreign missionaries and preached in terms of foreign religious concepts. He gradually came to the view that in order to survive in China, Christianity must be inculturated within Chinese culture as Buddhism had been 'sinicized' fifteen hundred years earlier. This was the path of accommodation or synthesis pioneered by the seventeenth-century Jesuits such as Matteo Ricci (1551-1610) and Protestant missionaries such as W.A.P. Martin (1827-1916) and Timothy Richard (1845-1911).n Menzies's ideas started to evolve while he was in North Henan, but their mature evolution was stimulated by the dynamic intellectual atmosphere at Cheeloo University, where he taught archaeology from 1932 to 1936, the happiest and most productive years of his career. In his studies of Shang religion, Menzies carne to the conclusion that the ancient Shang people who lived about the time of Moses in the Bible had worshipped a god they called Shangdi (usually translated as 'Lord on High'). This was not a new idea, as it had been promulgated in the seventeenth century by the Jesuits who, with no scientific evidence, speculated that the Zhou people later introduced the idea of Tian or 'Heaven,' a supreme impersonal moral force that governs the universe and mankind. This loosely defined idea later became an important concept of Confucianism. Shangdi, the Jesuits speculated, was a monotheist creator similar to Jehovah and they used the term to translate 'God the Father.' The term Shangdi was rejected by successive popes during 'the Chinese rites controversy' at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and consequently Roman Catholics had to invent a new name for God: Tianzhu, the 'Lord of Heaven,' which had no accretions of\n\n12 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nmeaning within Chinese culture. Ironically, after many years of debate over 'the term question,' most Protestants adopted Shangdi in their translations of the Bible. As a missionary, Menzies tended to stand with the Jesuits, although as a scientist, he wanted to prove with scientific methods that God, the universal lord of creation, did not exclude the Chinese. In other words, he wanted to find how 'grace' operated in the ancient Shang culture. Once he had identified the ancient ideograph of di or god, he believed he had found the scientific evidence. This became his 'mission' in life: the search for God in ancient China. Menzies's search for God was a tedious and painstaking process. For two decades he collected oracle bones and related archaeological artefacts, and spent his spare time identifying the archaic oracle-bone inscriptions that bore information about the religious concepts and practices of the Shang Chinese. Working in 'the still watches of the night,' he studied all periods of Chinese calligraphy and epigraphy to decipher the original meaning of each character. 'Some of us,' he wrote, have to 'school ourselves in Chinese thought, and ideas, so that we know something of the soul and mind of China as well as the outside form.'12 After moving to Cheeloo University, he started to theorize his distinctive interpretation that the Shang were worshippers of 'God' or Shangdi, a religious belief that continued for millennia thereafter in one form or another. Out of his experience in North Henan, Menzies concluded that the conversion of China could only be achieved by adapting the Christian gospel to the Chinese reality. As he reflected in the early 1950s: 'While I have counted 1000 persons baptized and many more prepared for the catechumens, yet perhaps my work on the bones permeated deeper into Chinese life than my work among the schools and churches of North Honan ... When one starts from the premise that God is the God of the Chinese and was so recognized by them, Christianity no longer becomes a foreign religion in the eyes of the Chinese and you have a firm foundation for your Christian preaching.'13 Chapters 9 to 14 present a picture of Menzies's transition from a rural missionary to an archaeologist and introduce his scholarly studies. The final chapters detail the frustration of the years (1937-51) that he spent in North America, waiting. They examine his doctoral studies at the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum, his war service with the United States government, and especially his efforts to return to China. During this time, he wrote numerous letters to the Overseas Mission Board of the United Church of Canada, expressing his strong\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ndesire to return to China to complete his mission, even at the price of personal safety. The fate of the Menzies collections of oracle bones and other ancient artefacts is told in detail in the Conclusion and Epilogue; briefly, of the 35,000 oracles he collected, over 30,000 bones remained in China. They were dispersed among the Shandong Provincial Museum, the National Palace Museum in Beijing, and the Nanjing Museum. After his death, his study collection was acquired by the Royal Ontario Museum from his family, who also deposited a smaller collection at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria (British Columbia). James Menzies had a unique career and left a distinctive legacy. He was quiet and modest with a strong sense of humility. At the same time, he was a man of commitment, determination, and principle. Physically, he was short, but intellectually, he had a larger presence than most people of his times. He was a rigorous scholar with a mind capable of philosophical thinking. All these personal qualifications made it possible for Menzies to follow a unique career path by crossing gaps that seemed too huge for others to attempt. Specifically, Menzies crossed three gaps in pursuing his life mission as a missionary expatriate. He was a trained civil engineer who saw the link between engineering and foreign mission, and crossed from mechanical science to foreign evangelism. After more than two decades' evangelical efforts in North Henan, Menzies was ready for the second crossing. This time the gap was between rural evangelism and archaeology. Again, his colleagues could not see the natural link between the two subjects. Once convinced that it was his mission to find God in ancient China, he devoted himself to the study of ancient Chinese cultures and religions. The last and most important gap was that between Western culture/ faith and Chinese culture/faith. We now live in a world of rapid globalization, with gradually declining barriers between different cultures and faiths. James Menzies's world was very different, with peoples alienated from each other by cultures and faiths. Ethnocentrism was the order of the time, even within the missionary movement. In the process of pursuing his life's mission, Menzies successfully broke the yoke of ethnocentrism and became an advocate of intercultural and inter-religious understanding. Shard by shard, he discovered the concept of Shangdi and crossed the gap between two very different cultures. James Menzies pursued his life mission quietly. In the same fashion, he passed away quietly without leaving a personal monument, even though he could have done so. Now, half a century later, scholars in China have\n\n14 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nstarted to recognize his unique achievements in Shang-Yin archaeology and culture, particularly as a collector and scholar of oracle bones. In 1996, his Oracle Bone Study was published and reissued by Qilu Press. A dozen papers have appeared in books and academic journals that recognize his important contributions to the study of Shang archaeology and culture. Wang Ruxing, an eminent scholar of oracle-bone studies, wrote: 'Menzies, through his studies, contributed to the development of Oracle Bone Studies, not only in the pioneering stage, but also in pushing its transition from the pioneering stage to the development stage.'14 In the 1950s Menzies was condemned in China as a cultural imperialist and thief of Chinese cultural artefacts. For decades, he was among those foreigners that Chinese scholars tried to forget or avoid. Thus, the recent activities constitute a rehabilitation of Menzies. This process culminated in 2000 with the 'James Menzies Conference' held at Shandong University, which had inherited part of Cheeloo University where Menzies taught in the 1930s. Out of this conference came the publication of a biography by Fang Hui, one of the key persons involved in rehabilitating Menzies. Dr Fang is a professional archaeologist well positioned to evaluate Menzies's academic achievements. As it always does, the Canadian government missed no opportunity to celebrate another Canadian hero recognized in a foreign land. As the official Canadian representative to the conference wrote: 'How honoured Canada is to know that the first non-Chinese archaeologist of China was Canadian.'15\n\nChapter 1\n\nRural Ontario, 1885-1903\n\n'I look back now to my childhood and think of our old home in Clinton,' wrote James Mellon Menzies in 1919, when he congratulated his father on his eighty-second birthday. James was 'somewhere in France,' engaged in the melancholy task of supervising a battalion of Chinese workers mopping up the batdefields of the First World War. 'I can see it in my memory now. I think I see the spring coming. The snow is melting and the green sodden grass is beginning to push its fresh sword like blades toward the warm sun. I can see the steam rising from the ground and I watch a robin hop across the lawn that slopes down to the artistic picket fence with its thick creamy paint. The chestnuts along the fence have sticky leaf buds and later the leaves come out like little umbrellas.'1 How characteristic of James Menzies, when surrounded by the ravages of man's inhumanity, still to remember the feel and smell of the earth, the grass steaming in the sunshine, the robin pecking for earthworms scenes of his idyllic rural childhood. It was a bitterly cold day, 23 February 1885, when James Menzies was born at the comfortable home of David Redpath Menzies and his wife, Jane McGee, in Clinton, Ontario, Canada. He was their second son, born twelve years after Robert. Four years later, in 1889, Margaret was born. Of the three, James would be the brightest and best educated. Like his father, Robert was a worker rather than a scholar, and found farming and managing the family business more interesting than the schoolroom. Margaret was also well educated, a graduate of the University of Toronto who married a fellow student of her brother James, Jack Judge, an engineer who became a prominent civil servant in Alberta in charge of road building for the province. She had a special bond with James and took personal responsibility for keeping the family ties strong.\n\n16 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nJames Menzies's grandparents, Robert Menzies and Catherine Redpath, emigrated in 1832 from Chapel Hill, Logic Almond, in Perthshire, along the shore of Loch Tay in the Central Highlands of Scotland. Nothing remains of the village today except a stone cairn marking the location of the chapel. The Menzies clan's progenitor, who was of Norman origin, from Mesnierzies'es, near Rouen, was granted lands in the Lothians in the twelfth century. The Menzies Castle, built in the early 1500s, saw its share of the turbulent history of the Highlands, for it was occupied by Cromwell's forces in the 1650s and sided with the Jacobites in 1715. Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed there for two days during his retreat from Stirling, which ended in the tragedy at Culloden. The official history describes the Menzies as a small, 'relatively peaceful clan, predominantly siding with law and order and the established monarchy ... Differences with their neighbours were mainly resolved [through] diplomacy, litigation or convenient marriage and they became the oldest family in Strathtay.'2 Perhaps we can see some of these characteristics in James Menzies. After the Napoleonic Wars, tens of thousands of Highlanders were driven off their ancestral lands by the tragic 'Highland Clearances,' when the lairds fenced in their estates and turned them into sheep farms. The tenant clansfolk were simply 'cleared,' often in brutal, dehumanizing fashion, and their houses and crops were burned to prevent them from returning. Perthshire was effectively cleared without the violence of other estates. The displaced crofters made their way to ports such as Perth, Aberdeen, and Glasgow, and subsequently dispersed to form proud ethnic pockets in all the far corners of the British Empire in Nova Scotia and Upper and Lower Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand. The clearances were an important episode in Scottish history, for they depopulated the Highlands, giving the glens the empty feeling they have today. Sometimes the refugees left in small numbers, as individuals or families, but more often they left en masse. In 1829, sixty families, over three hundred individuals, left Perthshire for Carleton Place, Upper Canada, where they named the villages of Perth and Glenquaich after their old homes.3 The Menzies clan seems to have thoroughly dispersed, if James Menzies's grandparents were any indication. In 1832 young Robert Menzies sailed to Upper Canada with his younger sister Nellie. On the same boat was another Scotsman, Robert Redpath, with his sister Catherine. The two families became friends on the long voyage, and soon after landing the two Roberts married each other's sister. The couples settled near each other in 'the Scottish block' back of Hamilton.\n\nRural Ontario, 1885-1903 17\n\nImmediately, they became victims of the heated politics of the colony. Robert and Nellie had come on the invitation of an uncle who had no children and wanted to make them his heirs. However, they were cheated out of his farm by a deceitful lawyer, a member of the notorious 'Family Compact' that ran the government and dispensed patronage. No wonder that five years later, when the red-haired Scottish firebrand William Lyon Mackenzie called for revolution against the oligarchy, Robert Menzies joined the rebels. The family story is that when Mackenzie's band was fleeing to safely on Navy Island in the Niagara River, a messenger brought news that Catherine had given birth to a son, David Redpath, on 21 February 1837.4 Born within the sound of rebellion, David Redpath Menzies, James's father, was the second of seven children that Robert and Catherine raised on a 100-acre farm near Milton. He grew up as a farm boy and left home at age fourteen to earn his own living. He apprenticed himself to a woodworker and became proficient in fine cabinetry, specializing in ornate desks and organ cabinets. Working in lumber camps in the winter and farming in the summer, David saved enough to buy a farm at Clinton, where in 1872 he married Jane McGee, whose parents had come from County Antrim in Northern Ireland. David became co-owner of the Doherty Organ Factory in Clinton, which turned out two to three hundred organs a month, sold as far away as England.5 By the time James was born in 1885, David was successful enough to have built a large house to provide his family with a gracious life.6 Located in the rich agricultural area of Huron County, Clinton was a prosperous yellow-brick town on the road from Stratford to Goderich on Lake Huron. Surrounded by forest and farmland, it had sawmills and grain mills that serviced the local farmers. By the 1880s, like most Ontario towns, Clinton's main street had its share of churches. The earliest settlers were Bible Christians, a radical Methodist sect based in Devon, England, who built the first chapel in the 1850s. After the Bible Christians joined the Methodist church union in 1884, there were two Methodist churches, a Baptist chapel, an Anglican church, and even a Salvation Army hall. David Menzies and his family were Presbyterians, and the family atmosphere was deeply religious. The children were imbued with a spirit of sober devotion. They did not believe in dogmatic principles, but rather in faith exemplified in their daily lives. Theirs was a private faith, nurtured within the family, especially as Clinton did not have a Presbyterian church. Although the children went to Sunday school whenever pos-\n\n18 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nsible, their parents were not able to attend church regularly. As James Menzies explained in his application to the Foreign Mission Board in 1910, 'our home life was of the very best, but there was no Presbyterian church in the community. A Methodist Church was built by the community but was abandoned after a year or so. Sunday school was kept going. During my boyhood we organized a Boys Club and S[unday].S[chool]. Class. In that I was trained. At high school, no opportunity afforded itself for the course in my life for I was at home part of the time.'7 The moral tone of the Menzies home was typically Victorian. Restraint in all things, honesty, thrift, industry, kindness, and charity were fundamental to the development of a 'Christian character.' Of course, they had Bible readings and prayers at meals and bedtime. The parents did not have much formal education, but like most Presbyterians they grounded their religious beliefs on reason and conscience rather than emotion. There was no sense of mysticism or emotional extremes in the family. This devotional, highly personal, non-institutional, and moderate religious experience had a long-lasting influence on James, whose religious life was to remain prominent once he left home.8 The family moved from Clinton to Goderich - 'just a sojourn' - where David owned the Goderich Organ Company, and in 1894 (when James was nine) to Staples in Essex County, near Windsor. Like many self-made entrepreneurs, David invested in land. He bought a six-hundred-acre farm at Staples because it contained the best grove of black walnut trees in the area, the finest wood for organ cabinets. Essex County, which includes Point Pelee, the most southerly point of Ontario, contains some of the best agricultural land in the province and was particularly known for its flourishing canning industries as well as tobacco farming. In addition to the farm, David ran a general store and lumber company and travelled as far as Winnipeg selling organs. He invested in land in what became downtown Winnipeg: this he later sold at a good profit, enabling him to retire comfortably and to send money to his poor missionary son. David remained on the Staples farm until 1919, when in his eighties he moved to Edmonton to retire near his daughter Margaret and within visiting distance of his son Robert. He died there in 1929 at the age of ninety-three. David was a practical man, and as a good Christian he felt that making money honestly and diligently merited God's reward for his 'stewardship' of money and resources. He never tired of telling James the importance of hard work. Writing in 1894 from Staples before the family arrived, he described his daily activities: 'The house here is cold and\n\nRural Ontario, 1885-1903 19\n\nsmall and made of rough boards. The wind blows through them and they are very cold when it is windy. Our house is papered with old newspapers. We get up early here. We have breakfast at 6:30 and I am in the office before daylight and make the fire and sweep out by lamplight and do not leave the office until 10 at night.'9 He was then nearly sixty. If father instilled a belief in the dignity of work, mother encouraged their offspring not to 'neglect your duty to your maker ... Do not mingle with bad company for their influence is for nothing good ... We are told in His word that we should acknowledge Him in all our ways and He shall direct our paths. You see we have the promise of his guidance providing we do our part. Otherwise we should not expect the promise. They are only a condition.'10 The symbiotic nature of work and faith was a hallmark of the parental legacy to the Menzies offspring. The family circle in the Staples farm home was enlarged with the addition of Aunt Lizzie, Mrs Menzies's widowed sister, and her son Harvey. When James and Harvey were ready for high school, David installed Aunt Lizzie as housemother of a rented house in Leamington.11 Margaret later joined them when she also reached high-school age. Father David did not have much schooling, having moved into the middle class through hard work and business acumen. But he encouraged his children to stay in school and be good students. In 1901 he wrote to James in Leamington, expressing a common lament of the pioneer generation: 'We did not have as good schools and as good a chance to learn when I was a boy as you have. I always think if I had been a better scholar, I could have done better than I have and made money faster by filling positions that now but men of good education can fill. I hope you will push on at school as you are doing and that I will have the pleasure of seeing you some day filling the place of some of our great men.'James was a good student - 'a good second if not first' but David projected his own fear of examinations on his son. 'Lots of good scholars have been beaten and plucked as they called it at examinations, even would be members of parliament get beaten at elections and it often happens that the best man gets beaten. So, remember it is no disgrace to get beat if you do not come out first, take a more determined stand next time to come out ahead and no doubt you will accomplish it.'12 Perseverance thus brought its own rewards. To his parents' delight, James Menzies passed the university entrance examination in 1903 with flying colours and was accepted by the School of Practical Science at the University of Toronto, majoring in civil engineering. The first stage of James Menzies's life was coming to a close. He\n\n20 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nhad completed his high-school education with good standing and was now ready to move towards a professional career. The idea of becoming a missionary had not yet entered his mind. Nevertheless, his rural Ontario childhood had unconsciously prepared him for the eventual call to China. Moving from Clinton to Staples to Leamington to Toronto developed in him an ability to adjust to new environments, an important prerequisite for a missionary without permanent residence either in the field or in Canada. This spirit of adventure made it easier for James to sail away later as a missionary. Why would a university-trained civil engineer give up a comfortable life to be a missionary to remote China? Historians of missions frequently probe the question of motivation. Piety was important, the desire to save souls. However, piety was not the only factor in the creation of a missionary. James Menzies followed a unique path to the mission field. He was the first trained engineer to become a Canadian overseas missionary. Unlike most missionaries, he was not inspired primarily by a pious Sunday school teacher or family influences. Rather, the commitment to mission work came to him gradually as a young student through the influence of the missionary movement then sweeping the colleges and universities of North America. Parental influences were thus important but not totally determinant. Although he welcomed the dedication to hard work and faith, Father David was disappointed that his favourite son did not inherit his business acumen and showed little interest in money. James always considered money as a necessary evil. Later in life, the few dollars he saved from his small mission salary were spent on bits of ancient bones and pots that had inestimable value for the study of ancient Chinese culture but little immediate intrinsic worth. James's life amplified the lessons on the virtue of frugality learned from his mother and the dignity of work stressed by his father. Throughout his life, he tried to spend every minute doing something meaningful. This religious view of work sustained him through the years in China.\n\nChapter 2\n\nToronto, 1903-1905\n\nThe Skule of Practical Science\n\nWhen James Menzies arrived in September 1903, 'Toronto the Good' was the metropolis of English Canada. It was almost one hundred years old and yet everything seemed new, built within the last decade or two. It was a big, bustling North American city with electric lights, streetcars, and 'skyscrapers' as befitted its self-proclaimed image as 'the Queen City.' The railways and mass media - national magazines like Saturday Night and the Presbyterian Record as well as the Eaton's department store catalogue - carried Toronto's ideas and products to every part of the Dominion. It must have been thrilling for a rural youth to move to the big city, but Menzies had no time for sightseeing. He had registered several weeks late for classes and had to catch up. Only gradually did he become familiar with Toronto, appreciate its physical beauties and rich social life, and develop a strong sentimental attachment to the city.1 Years later the 'wandering missionary' wrote, 'I am glad to be back in Toronto. Somehow I feel that I belong here. It is 46 years since I came to Toronto first in 1903 and ever since then Toronto has seemed more my home than any place outside of China.'2 At that time, Toronto was one of the great evangelical cities of the world, run by and for evangelicals. Ninety per cent of the population were Protestants, with the Methodists counting almost one-third and the Presbyterians not far behind. A decade earlier, the Toronto Daily Mail held a contest to determine the most popular preacher of the day. The winner received 160,000 votes, while the runner-up received 140,000: this was in a city of 100,000 people! The idea that preachers were\n\n22 Cross Culture and Faith\n\ncelebrities may seem astonishing in our secular age, but it was a successful gambit as the newspaper's subscriptions rose dramatically.3 Toronto not only had famous preachers and beautiful churches but also the headquarters of the five national Protestant denominations: Methodist, Presbyterian, Church of England (Anglican), Baptist, and Congregational. Toronto also had six seminaries: Catholic St Michael's, Methodist Victoria College, low-church Anglican Wycliffe, Presbyterian Knox, high-church Anglican Trinity College, and the Baptist McMaster University on Bloor Street. Toronto was also a city of schools. Its post-secondary institutions absorbed a diverse, never-ending stream of young men and women from the farms and small towns of Ontario, educated and professionalized them, and then sent them to the far corners of the earth. Established as a non-denominational provincial college in 1850, University College was an exception. In 1887, it federated with two denominational colleges (Methodist Victoria and Roman Catholic St Michael's), three seminaries (Knox, Trinity, and Wycliffe), and professional faculties such as medicine, engineering, dentistry, and architecture to become the University of Toronto. In addition to the two universities (Toronto and McMaster), there were business colleges, normal schools and teachers' colleges, deaconess training schools, and the Toronto Bible Training School for missionaries and lay workers. Thus, post-secondary education was strongly associated with religion in the Arts while the relationship was less secure in the 'modern' subject areas of business and science. The School of Practical Science (SPS) was the engineering faculty of the University of Toronto, located in the southeast sector of the campus. Founded in 1873 as a diploma school, SPS started granting four-year Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc.) degrees in 1892 after its incorporation within the new University of Toronto. The term 'practical science' had two rather different meanings at the time, as the official history states: 'For some, it meant \"serving a useful purpose,\" and its antonym was \"impractical\": thus, practical science would include the thermodynamics of steam engines, the chemistry of ore refining, or the statistics of bridge building. But to science educators at the time, it referred instead to the new style of teaching by involving students in laboratory work teaching, in other words, by allowing students to \"practice\" science.'4 Although officially designated as the Faculty of Applied Science in 1900, the old name SPS - or its irreverent nickname, 'Skule' - continued to be used for many years. SPS was known as 'Galbraith's school' after John Galbraith, the first\n\nToronto, 1903-1905 23\n\nprofessor of engineering in 1878, then in the middle of his long and illustrious career that spanned thirty-six years until his death in 1914. He 'led the school from an ill-defined concept in the minds of the government and university administrators into a flourishing school of engineering with a place, a mission, and a tradition of its own, a success that should not be taken lightly.'5 An earlier SPS history was more fulsome: 'The early engineering graduates have not only played a conspicuous part in the building of the Canadian transcontinental railways, and in other public works, but have been almost exclusively the engineers of that epoch-making venture in public ownership, the development of power by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. This is a striking proof of the high quality of the instruction given in the School from the beginning.'6 With the increasing demand for trained engineers, the all-male student body of SPS doubled from 223 to 475 in the three years from 1900 to 1903, and would redouble by 1908.7 The original 'little red schoolhouse' was jammed, despite several additions and the construction of new buildings. Although new courses and specialities were added, the basic thrust of the curriculum had barely changed. In addition to mathematics, physics, mineralogy, the strength of materials, and chemistry of various types, all students had to spend several afternoons a week in surveying. The centrepiece of the engineering program was 'engineering drawing, a subject that was actually a mix of many things - technical drawing, mapping and topography; the study of projections and perspectives, descriptive geometry; and even such practical matters as drawing out stone-cutting patterns. Students spent fourteen of their forty hours a week on this, and were expected also to spend any free time at their drafting tables. Instilling the skill of visualizing was, obviously, the heart of engineering education.'8 This intense scrutiny of objects and drawing them in pen and ink was to stand James Menzies in good stead once he became an archaeologist. Then as now, the engineering students had a reputation as the pranksters of the university. Their lives were filled with hard work and long hours, expanding horizons and plenty of good fun. Fun, the school history notes, 'was something new. Fun was not something that students had much experience of at university before the 1880s. But student life in these turn-of-the-century years was indeed changing, as the old discipline of college life, kept in place for years by small student numbers and traditional respect for authority, was lost once and for all. Students\n\n24 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nbegan to organize and take part in extracurricular activities as they never had before, to socialize away from the eyes and rules of the authorities, and, perhaps most striking of all, to demand a say in the affairs of the university.' Sometimes, they got into 'hustles' and 'scraps' that degenerated into 'organized brawls, with hundreds of young men fighting hand to hand outside the university buildings.' When the authorities tried to intervene, the students went on strike. In 1906, several rowdies were suspended after being caught red-handed painting medical students with red ink, prompting the engineering students to boycott classes.9 It was during James Menzies's student years (1905) that two lines were added to the engineer's identifying yell after a riotous rugby game: We are, we are, we are the Engineers, We can, we can, we can demolish forty beers.10\n\nJames Menzies never got caught up in the 'laddish' side of engineering life. He was quiet and shy by nature, a scholar not an athlete, and sports were not an important part of his life. Below average in height and sturdily built, he was never moved by the cult of games, but kept in good health by regular evening walks. Yet the rowdiness unconsciously prepared him for the turbulent nationalism in China when his middleschool students went on strike in order to attend an anti-imperialist parade. Although James Menzies registered late for classes, by the end of the first term he was able to catch up and become 'the foremost in a class of about 200 pupils.' He spent his first year almost exclusively on surveying, drawing, and books, with little time for extracurricular activities. 'I have only been to an entertainment once,' he wrote his mother, 'so you see I am not spending much that way.'11 He worked so hard at exam times that his father advised him not to 'sit up all night, go to bed and get your rest and you will feel fresh in the morning for the ordeals of the day.'12 An important part of training in civil engineering was summer internships with land survey teams in the bush. Surveying was becoming an important role of the government as Canada opened vast new territories for mining and agriculture. Before lands could be settled or exploited, they had to be surveyed and registered. To meet the demand, the Canadian government created the Dominion Land Surveyor licence system. In the summer of 1904, Menzies went on his first expedition to New Ontario, the northern land acquired in the 1880s after a long legal battle with the Dominion government. The following summer, he went\n\nToronto, 1903-1905 25\n\nto the Northwest Territories (now Saskatchewan and Alberta). In 1906 he and his father started a joint venture prospecting for minerals at Cobalt, Ontario, after the discovery of silver sparked a treasure-hunting fever there.13 After James spent two months in the deep woods and found nothing, he was hired as a topographer by a Geological Survey Team.14 In 1907 and 1908 he went again to the Prairies. These summer expeditions in the newly opened north and west territories gave James an opportunity to practise the skills he had learned in school. At the same time, they opened his eyes and mind to the wild side of nature. The adventure of living on the frontier tested his capacity for adaptation to unfamiliar living conditions, which later became essential in his life as a missionary in China. Until 1909 when the four-year degree became compulsory, SPS still operated on an optional basis: a one-year diploma in surveying, a threeyear diploma, or an additional fourth year leading to a BASc. Because of the high demand for engineers by expanding Canadian industry, many students chose one of the diploma options. However, James Menzies chose the four-year program and graduated with honours in 1907. He was an outstanding student. Decades later he wrote to Arthur, his son: 'I had always stood near the top of my class. I stood first in civil engineering in my first year and always took honours.'15 If he had chosen to follow his father's wishes, James could have been 'at the head of some noted engineering staff.'16 However, to David's disappointment, James chose a much more demanding and rewarding career: that of a foreign missionary. The Student Volunteer\n\nJames Menzies arrived at the School of Practical Science with a deep but private faith, although he seldom attended church or Sunday school and certainly had no plans to become a missionary. Mission apologists stress the formative importance of the family in the creation of missionary heroes: as one historian has noted, 'The seeds that would ripen into a sense of obligation and ultimately bear fruit in a missionary vocation were often planted in the home.'17 Others have highlighted the early influence of a local minister or Sunday school teacher.18 Still this does not explain James's conversion to foreign missions. His parents were good Presbyterians, but they opposed their promising son's call to China. Instead, his dedication came from his university experiences. In one of the most secular sections of the university, Menzies became exposed to 'public religion', the modern piety expressed through public\n\n26 Cross Culture and Faith\n\norganizations such as the YMCA, bible study groups, and mass student religious conventions. His decision to give up civil engineering for the ministry was not sparked by a sudden and emotional conversion but by gradual, inexorable changes in his spiritual and intellectual life. These changes came naturally, without a traumatic spiritual experience. Menzies spent his first year at SPS engrossed in his studies. He felt profoundly lonely. When he confided that fact to his high-school friend, Mary MacGregor, she advised him to take up some pastime such as skating, or to join a Christian Endeavour society where he could meet nice young people.19 Christian Endeavour, an American import that appealed mainly to Presbyterians, brought young men and women together 'for social and cultural activities in a protected setting and a devotional atmosphere ... Its formula for success was the provision of busy-work: each member was expected to participate in every meeting, if only by reciting a Bible verse.'20 Interestingly, Menzies chose to join the Young Men's Christian Association instead. The University College YMCA was founded in 1873 and by 1900 was the third largest university association in North America, with a membership of three thousand, and its own building and branch in every college and faculty.21 The YMCA offered more intellectual content such as scientific lectures and boys' parliaments, although it had the same sense of religious excitement and the involvement of every member. James Menzies was the ideal candidate for the YMCA: a lonely male student from a respectable, small-town religious background, adrift in the big city. He began to attend the SPS branch of the YMCA in 1904. As he summarized in his application to the Presbyterian Foreign Missionary Committee in 1910, this led him into student and social activism: I have been a member of the University YMCA Executive as Councillor, Recording Secretary, Bible Study Convenor and Student Volunteer Chairman. I have been closely associated with City Mission work, being an advisory member of the Committee. I am also an advisory member of the Canadian College Mission. Almost all my time has been spent on religious work in the University. I have done some work in the city in young people's work, city missions, street preaching, prison work, and personal work during Revivals. This last summer I spent on the mission field of Lake Joseph, Muskoka... I have been connected with the Laymen's Missionary Movement and Young People's Missionary Movement at their conferences, also Student Conferences. I have led normal Bible Study groups. In college I have led Bible Study and Missionary Classes.22\n\nToronto, 1903-1905 27\n\nFor James Menzies, Christian activism in a campus setting was the first step to lifetime commitment. The YMCA had two serious purposes. The first was the training of student leaders, 'the statesmen of the next generation' who would go forth to Christianize Canadian society. The second was to train foreign missionaries to take the gospel to the ends of the earth. Canada had a special place in God's plan of redemption, YMCA leader Newton Rowell stated, which was 'to lead the world in the work of world-wide evangelization.' A young country with limited resources and a vast 'uninhabited' West to be settled, Canada was to be the 'lynch-pin' of a new AngloAmerican alliance whose 'high mission' was 'to give light, liberty, peace and good government, civilization and Christianity to all races of men.' Canada's contribution to the world missionary enterprise, noted Alvyn Austin, 'like its contribution to the First World War, was larger than its share: it has been said that in proportion to their size and resources, the churches of Canada sponsored more missionaries overseas than any other nation in Christendom.'23 The overseas wing of the YMCA was the Student Volunteer Movement, which became the foremost recruiter of educated foreign missionaries. Founded at Northfield, Massachusetts, in 1886 under the direction of American evangelist Dwight L. Moody, the SVM did not send missionaries on its own but recruited college students for denominational missions by encouraging a signed pledge, T will, God willing, volunteer to go as a foreign missionary.' From the beginning, Canadian students sent delegates to Northfield and other SVM conventions and started Canadian conferences at Niagara-on-the-Lake, which became known as the 'Canadian Northfield.'24 With its slogan 'The Evangelization of the World in This Generation,' it was a powerful recruiting agency. By 1920 it had sent nine thousand North American college graduates to foreign missions.25 As enthusiasm for missions coursed through Canadian churches in the 1880s and 1890s, the SVM stimulated the denominations to establish overseas missions. It became 'de rigeur for each denomination to be represented in at least one \"heathen\" country.'26 Because of its decentralized structure, the Presbyterian Church in Canada developed a patchwork of small unrelated missions around the world. The Eastern Division, based in Halifax, was responsible for missions in the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), Korea, Trinidad, and British Guyana, while the Western Division, centred in Toronto, supported missions in India, Taiwan, and China. The Ontario Presbyterians sent their first overseas missionary in 1871,\n\n28 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nthe redoubtable George Leslie Mackay, who established the first independent foreign Canadian mission. He set out 'in Abrahamic ignorance' of his destination and arrived in Taiwan. Two years later, two professionally trained schoolteachers, Marion Fairweather and Margaret Rodger, became the pioneers of the Canadian mission at Indore, India.27 On mainland China, the Presbyterians had three missions. North Henan was founded in 1888 by the firebrand from Oxford County, Jonathan Goforth, his wife, the noted painter Rosalind Bell-Smith, and the scholarly Donald MacGillivray. MacGillivray was subsequently seconded to Shanghai, the second Presbyterian mission, where he contributed his literary skills to the Christian Literature Society. At Guangzhou (Canton) a small medical mission was sponsored by the Presbyterian Women's Foreign Missionary Society of Montreal. By contrast, the Methodist Church of Canada, highly centralized in Toronto, concentrated on two large, prestigious missions in Japan and West China. Every year during Menzies's school career, a large party of twenty or thirty enthusiastic young people - mostly married couples and single women - would bid farewell from Toronto. Their widely circulated letters described how they enthusiastically set the Yangtze gorges ringing with the Victoria College cheer. By the 1920s, the West China mission had over two hundred missionaries and was regarded as one of the most professional anywhere in the world. The Anglican Church of Canada erected overseas dioceses in Japan, India (Kangara), and China (Henan). The Canadian Baptists sponsored missions in India and Bolivia, while the Congregationalists had Angola. Every four years - one student generation - the SVM held a mammoth conference. Massey Hall, the largest auditorium in Toronto was the venue for the 1904 convention, described by Alvyn Austin in Saving China: 'The stage was draped in flags and bunting, representing the hoped-for alliance of British and American churches.' Among the 2000 registered delegates from all over North America were 494 Canadians representing 54 institutes of higher learning. Even the Toronto Daily Star reporter put aside objectivity to rhapsodize: The platform in Massey Hall these days commands a farther skyline of life and service than any meeting in legislature or parliament. The real statesmen are here. It is they who deal with big affairs, and put their hands on vast enterprises. What are our poor parish politics compared with the worldwide sweep? What is our trade policy compared to the evangelization of the world in this generation? Is it any wonder that such a movement has drawn to it the best and the brightest?28\n\nToronto, 1903-1905 29\n\nThese conventions introduced James Menzies to the heroic image of a foreign missionary, but equally important was the inspiration of returned missionaries. In 1904 Menzies 'took a decided stand' and joined Dr McTavish's Central Presbyterian church, a mission-minded congregation. There he heard addresses by Presbyterian missionaries from many parts of the world, especially from North Henan, with which he gradually developed 'a strong attachment.'29 In 1908, Menzies, as the chair of the university SVM, was the organizer for John Mott's visit to Toronto. Mott's call for men of ability for foreign fields deeply impressed the young student. In a letter to his mother, he wrote, ' [H]ow I wish you and father could be here to hear inspiring addresses and meet people who are moulding our country and the world.'30 It is clear that people such as Mott helped nourish James's spiritual life, shape his life direction, and strengthen his commitment to the foreign-mission cause. James was a person of commitment. In 1905 and 1906 he kept a diary and seldom did a day pass without some activity related to Bible study or the YMCA. In one typical week, he wrote: October 8th [1905], Sunday: ... went to church. Rev. [R.P.] MacKay, Foreign Mission Secretary of the Canadian Presbyterian Church preached ... Bible class this afternoon ... Church tonight. October 9th: sent $10 to International Committee YMCA ... I hope it will help them in turning some man's life as they turned mine while at Lakeside ... Got the invitations to our freshman reception and put them in the envelopes ... Went to Business meeting of YPSCE [Young People's Society of Christian Endeavour]. October 10th: distributed the invitations ... Waited at YMCA after 5 till 6:30 for the fruit to come for our reception. Our reception was all right. October llth: made a plan of our Bible Study leaders. October 12th: get some Lakeside Bible Study notes. Saw Gordon about holding our model group. October 13th: I saw several of the fellows about having a model group class of Bible Study. October 14th: I spent considerable time in getting the fellows to promise to come ... to the group tonight... I had to hurry through dinner to get over to the YMCA to the model group ... It was a success. 16 men out, 10 groups have been started and I have at least 5 more to start right away and expect as many more as soon as we get rightly started.31\n\nThis week was not the exception but the norm for Menzies's university career.\n\n30 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nAs chair of the Bible Study Committee, he recruited leaders to set up small groups of four to five members. He organized rallies and receptions, inviting church leaders such as James A. Macdonald, editor of the Toronto Globe, to deliver inspiring speeches.32 In the committee report for 1907-8, Menzies wrote: To increase the efficiency, Normal classes were organized for the leaders ... The majority of these Normal classes met on Friday evenings in the YMCA. Each evening the little building was crowded to overflowing and the leaders were well fitted to conduct their groups, which met at a time and place arranged for each group. The campaign was opened by a Rally in Convocation Hall on October 6th, when President Falconer presided and Mr. J.A. Macdonald, of the Globe, made a very powerful address. The canvass that followed resulted in the enrolment of 1,050 men. Of these, 748 [members of 106 groups] attended regularly for eight weeks or more.33 The president of the university referred to this remarkable accomplishment in his report: It will not be invidious to make special reference to the work of the Bible Study Committee. The large number of men engaged in daily study of the Scriptures constitutes a force for good that was only excelled in dynamics by the normal classes of young leaders who came together every Friday evening to study under the Professors who gave their services to such good effect.34\n\nAs a member of the university YMCA executive, Menzies attended conferences at Northfield, Massachusetts, Lakeside, Ohio, and Niagaraon-the-Lake, Ontario. The liberal but devotional atmosphere of these conferences served as a stimulant in directing him to the cause of foreign missions. The conference participants spent regular hours on Bible study, student work, and world problems. The whole atmosphere of the conference was such as to encourage the development of a new conception of the Christian leader as a man of intelligence and insight in both theological and social matters, yet interested in games and sports and concerned with the spread and application of the Christian ethic in the world.'35 In the summer of 1905, Menzies wrote, 'I went to the student conference at Lakeside, Ohio and there decided to become a foreign missionary.'36\n\nChapter 3\n\nFrom Commitment to Departure, 1905-1910\n\nSearch for a Venue\n\nFor James Menzies, the year after Lakeside was a period of intense spiritual struggle to confirm and strengthen his new commitment. Many times Menzies felt weak, and prayed for God to guide him and give him strength. At other times he thought he was too sinful to be useful for God's cause on earth. One such day was 4 September 1905, when he started his diary with 'SIN!' in capital letters, followed by: 'I have fallen in sin. Oh God, when I should be striving onward, I have been defeated.'1 He did not mention the specific sin, but three days later he asked God to 'Create in me a clean heart, Oh God and renew a right spirit within me.'2 When Menzies volunteered as a foreign missionary, he planned to become a self-supporting engineer/missionary overseas, where he could teach the gospel in his spare time. By 1900 Western engineers were found at every corner of the world. As imperialism became the dominant force in world politics, engineers were sent to construct railways and ports, to open mines, and to build the physical structures for imperial dominance over the world. Working in colonial countries, they were the representatives of modernization on an exploitive Western model. With their relaxed morals, engineers and businessmen had a bad reputation overseas. As a Christian, Menzies was embarrassed by this tarnished image and, as he explained to the Foreign Mission Committee (FMC), 'I felt I was needed there to offset the bad influence of many engineers.'3 This was a bold but impractical idea, prompting Menzies to explore the possibility of going out as a YMCA secretary. By this time, the YMCA\n\n32 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nwas expanding in many parts of the non-Western world such as China, India, and Japan. The first Canadian overseas secretary was Arthur W. Beale, a graduate of Queen's University sent to Japan in 1888 by the International Committee with financial support from the Montreal YMCA.4 In 1905 David Willard Lyon, an American, arrived in Shanghai as the first YMCA secretary in China.5 To prepare himself as a potential YMCA secretary, James planned to take a few courses at Knox College. Yet he was not sure how the YMCA could fit into the mission fields. He wrote, 'I believe YMCA work at home is due to the failure of the various churches to meet the needs of young men. This should not be so in the foreign field where there is but one denomination in each district.'6 This was, of course, a simplistic view of foreign missions, which in many ways shared the denominational divisions of the homelands. Nonetheless, it was this attitude that led him to broaden his search for a more conventional way to serve overseas. Although the Presbyterian Church in Canada had sent a few nonordained educational missionaries overseas, such were the exception. The first trained educationalists in North Henan were women, such as Margaret Brown, who became the mission historian. All male missionaries had to be ordained, including the medical doctors who had degrees in medicine and theology. Ordination would mean another three years of study after graduating from civil engineering, and Knox College had never accepted an engineering student. On the other hand, while the YMCA did not require ordination, there seemed to be no room for engineers in their system. 'I am away at sea as to what to do,' wrote James in his diary. 'Gracious God, in whose hands I have placed my destinies and life. I beg of thee to guide me and place me in the world where I can do the most for thee ... Oh God, throw more light on things now and help me to utilize every moment in such a way that it will prepare me for what shall be of service for Thee in my coming life.'7 Since he wanted to live among the Chinese people, Menzies finally chose to pursue the conventional route as an ordained evangelist under the Presbyterian church. As he wrote in his application to the Foreign Mission Committee: 'I want to put my life where I can reach the people directly in evangelistic effort... So, I desire to become an evangelist and to do what I can for the people over whom I am placed.'8 Another factor was that the FMC was willing to bend the rules. Through the YMCA work, Menzies had come to know the foreign secretaries R.P. MacKay and A.E. Armstrong, who between them dominated the Foreign Missions Committee (and its successor, the Board of Overseas Missions)\n\nFrom Commitment to Departure, 1905-1910 33\n\nfrom 1888 to the 1950s. MacKay praised Menzies as a young man of 'good judgment,' and Armstrong said he was 'exceptional' and could 'educate the church at home.' The FMC concluded that if they could do anything to 'recruit James into their missionary force,' they would be glad to assist him in gaining entry into Knox College.9 The summer of 1907 was a brief excursion in the life he might have led as a professional engineer. With his BASc. from the Faculty of Applied Science, James left for the Prairies in charge of a reconnaissance party for the Dominion Land Survey, charged with drawing the demarcation line between what would become the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. He had spent several summers in the west serving his apprenticeship for the Dominion Land Surveyor licence. It was hard work and sometimes dangerous. His band kept moving on the featureless grassland, most of the time on foot. Besides mosquitoes, they were attacked by bears. However, James relished this pioneer life, reporting in letters his excitement with hunting, collecting natural specimens, and 'wild thinking' under the star-lit prairie sky.10 Knox College\n\nIn September 1907 Menzies registered at Knox College, graduating in 1910 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree. Knox College was an all-male world like the School of Practical Science and the YMCA, but if SPS was like a fraternity house, Knox was a combination of seminary and boarding house. It occupied an impressive gothic structure just west of the University of Toronto campus on a spectacular site in a circle in the very middle of Spadina Avenue, facing down the broad boulevard to Lake Ontario. The building, unfortunately, had deteriorated over the years, with poorly ventilated, gas-lit classrooms downstairs and draughty dormitories upstairs. Five years after Menzies graduated, Knox College moved to its present building on the main campus, a designated architectural landmark. Like SPS, Knox College saw itself as a 'practical' institution dedicated to training a class of professional men rather than a few scholars, professionals who learned by 'practising' theology. As Principal William McLaren stated in 1907: ' [The work of the Canadian church] is not to indulge in speculative theology, but to give the gospel and its institutions to a new land. And we venture to think that one of the safeguards which has helped to preserve our theology pure and wholesome has been the concentration of the thought and energy of the Church on its great\n\n34 Cross Culture and Faith\n\npractical work, the salvation of souls and the upbuilding of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ.' Brian Fraser in the official history, Church, College, and Clergy, describes Knox College's mission in this period as the creation of 'a progressive church for a nation transformed.'11 Knox was the most important of the five seminaries maintained by the Presbyterian Church in Canada. Founded in 1844 by Free Church Secessionists, Knox was long regarded as a citadel of conservatism, but by 1900 it had moved from confessional orthodoxy, based on the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Shorter Catechism, to progressive orthodoxy, the belief that God speaks in different ways to each generation of human history. Hired mostly from Scottish universities, the professors 'combined a solid grounding in the evolutionary moral and religious worldview of Idealist philosophers, the historical methods of the believing practitioners of higher criticism, and the movements among university students, inspired by Dwight L. Moody and Henry Drummond, to spread the intellectual and social benefits of Protestantism throughout the world.'12 The years that Menzies was at Knox, 1907-10, were particularly significant in its history. The respected conservative principal William Caven died in 1904 and his successor, William McLaren, retired in 1908. Alfred Gandier, a noted liberal, was appointed principal and professor of practical theology, a position that he occupied from 1908 until Church Union in 1925. Among the illustrations in Fraser's history is the composite photograph of the 1910 graduating class, twenty students in gowns including James Menzies. Fraser noted that, of the eight faculty, seven were 'progressives' or 'liberals,' the sole exception being Principal Emeritus McLaren. John Edgar McFadyen, who taught Old Testament, was a leading exponent of higher criticism. T.B. Kilpatrick was a prolific and passionate proponent of optimistic nationalism and of progressive and aggressive Protestantism. Robert Law challenged his students to bring out with new fullness and urgency the social significance of Christianity as embodied in the ideal of self-sacrificing service seen in Christ.13 Although Knox College did not have the divisive heresy trials that characterized confrontations between liberals and conservatives - or modernists and anti-modernists as they were called - in Scotland and the United States, the transition to progressive orthodoxy was not smooth. As Knox College and the other seminaries were moving away from denominational identity to train a generation of ecumenical ministers who would implement the United Church of Canada, the conservative wing was moving toward fundamentalism.\n\nFrom Commitment to Departure, 1905-1910 35\n\nOne sign of the increasingly bitter conflict occurred in Menzies's second year, when Jonathan Goforth returned from China and accused some Knox professors of teaching heresy. A stormy presence in the North Henan mission, Goforth had launched a dramatic revival campaign in Korea and Manchuria in 1907 that he called the 'Holy Ghost revival.' He tried to revive the church at home using the same methods, but was received with shocked silence when he called upon the General Assembly to confess their sins publicly. 'I do not remember another man who came home with such an asset, and who made so little of it,' R.P. MacKay confided. Unsuccessful at rooting heretics out of Knox College, Goforth returned to China and seemed 'to consider it his duty to hunt for heresy' among his missionary colleagues.14 Paradoxically, James Menzies - an engineer and archaeologist, a theological liberal, and a representative of the new professional - was to live at the same mission station at Zhangde with the Goforths. James Menzies was the first student to enter Knox with an engineering degree. This caused some problems. The college stressed the importance of liberal arts to 'develop the mental and moral powers needed to communicate the Gospel in meaningful language.'15 Professor McFadyen supported Menzies's application because 'a mind trained in science was for the purpose of beginning Greek or Hebrew just as good as one trained in philosophy or history.'16 He proved to be correct, because Menzies always stood near the top of his class.17 The practical side of theological studies was reinforced through field work. Some students worked among Eastern European immigrant communities in Toronto, while others took rural charges for practice preaching. Menzies spent two summers in home missions. He returned to the Prairies in 1908 as an itinerant minister at places so remote that his father could not locate them on the map.18 The following summer he spent among the native people in Muskoka, Ontario. Compared with the Prairies, Muskoka was much more pleasant. The land was covered with dense forest and hundreds of lakes, the 'cottage country' of today. He enjoyed the sojourn, which helped him to get away from 'so much hurry and study.' Although the YMCA remained high in Menzies's agenda, his focus shifted to the Student Volunteer Movement. He was president of the university SVM and convenor of the Student Volunteer Band. To stir up young people's interest in foreign missions he organized monthly meetings and annual conferences. Leading evangelists were invited to speak: the 1908 speakers included J.A. Macdonald, R.P. MacKay, J. Harvey\n\n36 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nBruce, a missionary on furlough from North Henan, the prominent mission historian Kenneth S. Latourette, and Samuel M. Zwemer of the international SVM.19 Between 1886 and 1925, the SVM was the most efficient recruiter for foreign mission fields. It provided a pool of volunteers from which came one-half to three-quarters of the North American Protestant missionaries sent overseas.20 For Toronto, the number of volunteers was 225 in 1908 and 235 the following year. James, however, seemed disappointed with the lack of interest in missions among the university's young people. 'If Toronto is to do her share of the evangelization of the world in this generation,' wrote James in the SVM annual report, 'she must not only give $500,000, but maintain a contingent of 600 volunteers of whom not 87, but 200 should be members of the University.'21 As James expanded his religious activism beyond the campus, he took on more responsibilities. His diary for this period is a record of meetings. In 1908 he served on fifteen committees, which included the Foreign Mission Committee of Knox College, the Student Volunteer Union, the Knox Volunteer Band, the Laymen's Missionary Movement, the Council of Canadian College Missions, the City Mission, and the Missionary Committee of Central Presbyterian Church.22 A Lifetime Partner\n\nOne happy result of James's involvement in the SVM was his acquaintance with Annie Belle Sedgwick, who would become his wife and partner in mission work. She was a deaconess-in-training at the Anglican Deaconess Training School, while her brother Arthur Sedgwick was Menzies's fellow student at the School of Practical Science. Her sister Maude was also attending the deaconess school. Three years older than James, Annie was born in 1882 at the family farm at Cottam near Windsor, Ontario, not far from the Menzies farm at Staples. (This was to become an important part of the Menzies's family life, since they could alternate visits with an extended family of cousins on both sides.) She was the second oldest of six sisters and a brother and grew up on a mixed farm growing corn, tobacco, and hay, with horses, cows, pigs, and chickens. 'Mother's family background was upper middle class English,' wrote her daughter, Marion F. Menzies Hummel, in her affectionate memoir.23 Her great-grandfather was a friend of the Duke of Wellington and his sister a Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Adelaide. The Sedgwick pedigree had\n\nFrom Commitment to Departure, 1905-1910 37\n\ncome down somewhat in the world after Annie's grandfather, a well-todo director of a London bank, lost most of his money in Irish railways. Annie's father, John Finch Sedgwick, the second youngest of seven, emigrated to the colonies in 1870 and settled at Brantford, Ontario, where he worked as a builder with another English emigrant, John Wright, on the construction of the School for the Blind. He cemented the partnership when he married Wright's daughter Annie Marie, a trained seamstress. They bought the farm at Cottam, where they remained until John Sedgwick's death in 1904. Annie Belle loved sewing and became a fine seamstress. She was taken out of school to provide clothes and alterations for the other children. 'She learned to make patterns just from looking at an illustration in a ladies' magazine,' Marion wrote. 'This skill came in very handy years later on the mission field where she made all our clothes. She even remade my father's clerical suit when it was becoming greenish. She remade it by turning it inside out... Mother was a lady. She held herself very upright to emphasize her pride in being descended from landed gentry in England. She had the skills treasured by the gentry, - letter writing, hospitality, dressmaking, making a charming and restful home for her husband and family.'24 After John Sedgwick's death, Mrs Sedgwick sold the farm and moved to Windsor, where she invested in rental houses to support the family. At twenty-two, Annie's life changed. Since she now had to support herself, she started training as a nurse in Boston, but her feet gave out after four months. The family life had revolved around the local Anglican church at Cottam, which her father had helped build. He had been a warden and his wife leader of the choir, while Annie had been secretary of the Young People's Association and led a women's Sunday school class. This experience led her and her sister Maude to apply to the deaconess school that had just opened in Toronto in 1906. They both graduated in its first class of 1909. Annie also attended theological classes at Wycliffe, where she was elected to the executive of the Student Volunteer Union, of which James Menzies was president. She too had decided on a China mission career, and after a temporary appointment at All Saints Church in downtown Toronto, she was appointed to join Bishop William C. White, who had just been consecrated as 'Bishop in Honan' and designated to establish a Canadian diocese at Kaifeng. Their courtship had many ups and downs,' Marion wrote tactfully. Although James was deeply attracted to the young deaconess, he was a shy, stuttering man who could not speak of his feelings until he finally\n\n38 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nwrote her a letter just before she left for China. Then he told his mother his 'little secret': I love a lassie. I did not know how much I did until I tried to love another. We have known one another for a couple of years or more, very superficially just at volunteer meetings and casually in the city... She is loved by everyone from the little raga-muffins on the street to the highest church dignitaries ... I liked her and remembered her voice and how bewitching she looked, just imagine a Deaconess bewitching. I could not get away from the visions of the little Deaconess and ended with my spending some pretty anxious days, pondering all the problems concerned and I resolved to let my heart have its way. So, I wrote a letter that took me three days. Well I told her in a clumsy blunt brutal way that I admired her from the crown of her head to the soles of her shoes.25\n\nThe two sisters, Annie and Maude, were both appointed to Henan. Since they were the pioneers, they were given a grand farewell from the train station, hoisted on the shoulders of Wycliffe students. James could not get near her through the crowd, and so he bought a ticket to the next station and got on the train. There he proposed for the umpteenth time and gave her a diamond engagement ring engraved 'JMM to ABS 1910.' This time she accepted, on condition that she complete her fiveyear commitment to the Anglican mission before they were married. A Career Launched\n\nIn January 1910, as if making a New Year's resolution, James Menzies applied to the Foreign Missionary Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. This was done pro forma, since the FMC had had their eye on him for many years. He was accepted at the next meeting, along with Dr Frederick M. Auld, a medical doctor from Montreal General Hospital, and both were designated for North Henan. A.E. Armstrong wrote to congratulate him 'upon the wonderful privilege which is yours in investing your life in [what] is without question the greatest opportunity for service in this world.'26 David and Jane, James's parents, heard their son's news through the newspaper, the Toronto Globe, before they received a letter from him a week later. Although they had expected this outcome for some time, they were still not ready to see their son sailing thousands of miles away to a country about which they knew almost nothing except for its poverty\n\nFrom Commitment to Departure, 1905-1910 39\n\nand violence. The Boxer massacre had occurred only ten years earlier. Father lost sleep the night the news came, worrying that, at the age of seventy-three, he would never see his son again. Yet, despite his pain, he wrote James an encouraging and loving letter: We received the news with pleasure and pain. We are glad to think you have been called by a higher power and chosen by your fellow men for the work, that of winning souls to Christ and trust you and your mate will succeed in evangelizing your share of the world in this generation. We are sorry when we think of being separated from you by so great a distance and in all possibility never to see you again.27\n\nEven at this late moment, practical-minded David did not give up hope that James would become a fully qualified engineer. He pressured his son to complete his exam for the Dominion Land Surveyor licence. Are you going to write off your D.L.S. before leaving? I think it would be a mistake if you did not, as it would give you a standing with the official class of the country and strengthen your influence. The men of influence to my mind are the parties to reach and anything that would assist you in that way would be a benefit. Think that matter over seriously and if at all practical, I would like to see you finish your D.L.S. as that is the part of your education I took so much interest in and even looked forward to seeing you at the head of some noted engineering staff. Any financial assistance you require to finish that course I will be glad to furnish you only let me know what is needed.28\n\nJames Menzies wrote the final test three months before he left for China. His father's advice turned out to be quite useful, for later he often benefited from his Dominion Land Surveyor credentials. The FMC never let its new missionaries leave the country quietly. It required them to tour Canada to arouse people's interest in foreign missions, which needed not only volunteers but also financial supporters. In February 1910 James undertook a deputation tour of Ontario and Quebec, the central support region for Presbyterian missions. From Quebec, he wrote: 'The church was full last night, full to overflowing with chairs in the aisle. I spoke four times yesterday.'29 In May, two churches competed for the honour of holding the solemn but joyful ceremonies of ordination and designation. He was ordained at Central Presbyterian church in Toronto by Dr McTavish, who had been an\n\n40 Cross Culture and Faith\n\nimportant influence ever since Menzies took his first communion there in 1904. Then at his home church in Staples, Dr Smith held the formal farewell service. On 21 May 1910 James Mellon Menzies, accompanied by his sister Margaret (engaged to another engineering friend, Jack Judge), boarded a ship at Montreal. As they sailed down the St Lawrence River, the young missionary left behind aging parents and many friends whom he might never see again. The farewell songs seemed particularly poignant. 'Honey Boy, must you really sail away, my Honey boy,' one woman sang: Must you go - Don't you know When the ship sails down the bay, my Honey Boy I'll be true, my Honey Boy, to you For I love you best of all, my Honey boy Don't you sigh - Time will fly When you're on the deep blue sea, Try and think sometime of me I'll be waiting anxiously, Honey Boy30\n\nHis experiences and education had provided James Menzies with the resilience and adaptability - that indefinable quality called 'character' that would stand him in good stead overseas. His family had given him a deep private faith, but the missionary fires in his heart came comparatively late, through the campus evangelism of the public religion of the YMCA and SVM. As he worked with these organizations, his horizons widened. 'My training in Hebrew and Greek did not make me either a Hebrew scholar or a Greek expert,'James wrote years later, 'but they did give me the background of all my linguistic research in Chinese language.'31 His theological training at Knox College was progressive, giving him an open mind when he had to face hostile Chinese nationalism and anti-Christian movements. It made it possible for him to appreciate Chinese culture and search for the hand of God within Chinese religious belief and life. His practical, scientific training would remain dormant but not forgotten. His uncanny ability to read the landscape and visualize objects was little utilized until he discovered the oracle bones at the Waste of Yin. James Menzies had come to his missionary career by a unique path that ensured he would have a unique career.\n\nChapter 4\n\nNorth Henan, 1910\n\nLove and Marriage\n\nThe experience gained growing up among the rolling hills of Ontario farmland and surveying the unmapped Prairies seemed to breed a love for travel in James Mellon Menzies. Given the chance, he always took the longer route to any destination. His first trip to China set the pattern: instead of the normal trans-Pacific route"
