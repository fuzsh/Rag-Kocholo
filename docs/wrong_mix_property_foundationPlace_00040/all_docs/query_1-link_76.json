This document discusses the history of conservation and resource management. It explains that as early as ancient Greece, writers warned about the negative environmental impacts of activities like deforestation and soil degradation. Throughout history, overpopulation and resource depletion led to issues like the collapse of the Mayan civilization. The industrial revolution further degraded the environment through pollution. In the 19th century, figures like George Perkins Marsh and Henry David Thoreau brought greater attention to environmental issues and sustainability. The conservation movement grew in the late 19th/early 20th century with the founding of groups like the Sierra Club and policies under Theodore Roosevelt to manage resources sustainably. The modern environmental movement accelerated in the 1960s due to issues like pollution and species decline.",
