        "text": "This article argues that the Internet possesses the potential to challenge corporate and Statist domination of digital space. Mapping Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s concepts of the rhizome, smooth/striated space, and the nomad onto the idea of digital connectivity, I show how hacktivism can initiate change both online and off. In the first section, I argue that the Internet is characteristic of a rhizome. As a rhizome, the Internet’s structure affords it a flexible, morphological, and ultimately a vibrantly powerful configuration. As a result of its connective and generative power, corporate and State entities seek to control digital space. These controlling institutions stratify, segment, and claim ownership over the flat, smooth space. The second section, then, shows how the Internet becomes striated through corporate and State interests. As a remedy, the third section advocates for hacktivism as a form of nomadic action. In this section, I focus on the Distributed Denial of Service attack as a form of deterritorialization that redistributes the flow of information. Acting as a digital machine de guerre engaging in online direct action, and against the legal apparatus of the State, hacktivists create a rupture in the rhizomatic structure and form smooth spaces within a striated network. In the final section, I advocate for sustained smooth digital spaces that allow for new modes of association that radiate outward from the digital to the physical world.\n\nIn recent years, designers, activists and businesspeople have started to navigate their social worlds on the basis of concepts derived from the world of computers and new media technologies. According to Otto von Busch and Karl Palmås, this represents a fundamental cultural shift. The conceptual models of modern social thought, as well as the ones emanating from the 1968 revolts, are being usurped by a new worldview. Using thinkers such as Michel Serres, Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda as a point of departure, the authors expand upon the idea that everyday technologies are profoundly interconnected with dominant modes of thought. In the nineteenth century, the motor replaced the clockwork as the universal model of knowledge. In a similar vein, new media technologies are currently replacing the motor as the dominant 'conceptual technology' of contemporary social thought. This development, von Busch and Palmås argue, has yielded new ways of construing politics, activism and innovation. The authors embark on different routes to explore this shift. Otto von Busch relates the practice of hacking to phenomena such as shopdropping, craftivism, fan fiction, liberation theology, and Spanish social movement YOMANGO. Karl Palmås examines how publications like Adbusters Magazine, as well as business theorists, have adopted a computer-inspired worldview, linking this development to the dot.com boom of the late 1990s. Hence, the text is written for designers and activists, as well as for the general reader interested in cultural studies.\n\nHacktivism, a portmanteau of “hacking” and “activism”, indicates the politically motivated use of technical expertise like coding. It addresses network infrastructure or exploits the infrastructure’s technical and ontological features for political or social change: activists seek to fix society through software and online action. Recent example of hacktivism include Anonymous, an online community whose self-identified members engage in disruptive activities using electronic civil disobedience techniques in support of digital freedoms. Hacktivism is a highly contested concept, and different groups of people associate different objectives and tactics under its umbrella, not all of which are compatible. With this contention in mind, this chapter explores the main features of hacktivism as a radical media practice. It offers a historical overview of the phenomenon, and a sociological analysis of hacktivist organizational patterns. It explores hacktivists’ tactics and their approach to institutions and social norms, and the challenges that hacktivism faces in the present and near future, touching upon issues of repression, accountability, and impact.\n\nIn the essay \"The Work of Artists in a Databased Society: net.art as on-line activism,\" I discuss two forms of on-line resistance as executed through two artist projects that use the networked database structure as a tool for social contestation. First, TO INFORM: Brooke Singer exposes her own electronic data to enlighten a general public of one's freely available data. Second, TO SUBVERT: iSEE, a collaborative project between the Institute for Applied Autonomy and the Surveillance Camera Players makes use of the database structure to subvert the monitoring of the public sphere. An excerpt from the essay's introduction states that: If we accept Walter Benjamin's statement that property and possession belong to the tactical sphere, the computer age in conjunction with our networked reality have introduced a new tactical sphere - - the marketplace of information. At the heart of this sphere is the database, the warehouse of information. Each public sphere is part of a civil domain that is governed by a set of laws and policies. Therefore, just as any civil, public space, the Internet must have its own set of policies that mirror those of our physical space. Amongst the on-line policies and regulations currently being established are decisions pertaining to appropriate policing and monitoring of cyber space, and determining the boundaries of privacy in a networked society. The questions surrounding on-line privacy are complex and encompass a wide number of issues such as ownership, which in itself introduces a chain of other questions. It is impossible to present an answer to these involved questions as they will continue to arise. However, I do contend that unless non-governing independent groups protect the Internet as a space for independent production, dissemination and open discourse, the radical potential of the Internet will be consumed, largely through its very nature. Therefore, if there exists today an artist avant-garde, looking to merge art with daily social life, it is the growing number of socially active artist engaged in cyber resistance as a critical practice in which the network and the database represent tools for engagement.\n\nThe glitch art practice is celebrated as a generative post digital tool which also carries disruptive, destabilizing form with radical potential. It embraces the brokenness of data and the aesthetics of failure. It celebrates faults, malfunctions, bugs, errors and other deviant anomalies bringing a political dimension to arts practice. The failure to communicate breeds miscommunication and error is hence communicable as noise. This method of deviation or misdirection breaks open the logic of control and leaves room for variance, play and unintended outcomes. Miscommunication thus becomes a reconceptualization of what cannot be raised with the existing social and cultural practices. Glitch becomes a destabilizing force offering strategies of misdirection that can serve both as cultural and artistic interventions. Hence I’m arguing in defence of the poor image and lo fi aesthetics which utilises these imperfections to show any media in a critical state and to criticize the inherent politics underlying the medium itself. While it’s crucial to study and reflect upon the creative potential of error, noise and glitch and its subversive quality, however it’s equally necessary to understand that cybernetic systems created these networks of a participatory new media culture that operate within a dominant structure. It is precisely these attempts at breaking the status quo, that underlying tension that I find most interesting if not revealing.\n\nThe development of the sociotechnical apparatus shaping our Post-Digital space and culture ran simultaneously with the conception of a relational and processual reality and the development of computation and networks, which are becoming ubiquitous. These technologies have embedded in our physical space, giving birth to a fuzzy system that struggles between the opportunities for collective engagement, offered by the networked communication, and the capacity of control of a pervasive and opaque system. Art has been experimenting with these new technologies from its in ception thus assuming the aesthetical and political commitment to develop strategies capable of disrupting the codes of domination and promoting a collective and constructive appropriation of space. These strategies refer to practices of embodiment and enc ounter, capable of promoting new assemblages towards the accomplishment of the Right to the City, the new citizenship proposed in the theories by Lefebvre and the actions of the Situationists."
