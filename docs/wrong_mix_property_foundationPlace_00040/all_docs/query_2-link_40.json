Chapter I Using Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications.............................................. 1 Pankaj Kamthan, Concordia University, Canada Hsueh-Ieng Pai, Concordia University, Canada In this chapter, the authors view the development and maintenance of high-quality electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications from a Web engineering perspective. A methodology for deploying patterns as means for improving the quality of e-commerce applications is presented. To that regard, relevant quality attributes and corresponding stakeholder types for the e-commerce applications are identified. The role of development process, the challenges in making optimal use of patterns, and feasibility issues involved in doing so, are analyzed. The activities of a systematic selection and application of patterns are explored. Examples illustrating the use of patterns during macro- and micro-architecture design of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce applications are given. The implications of the use of patterns in a Semantic Web context are briefly highlighted. Chapter II Informing Industry via Academic Research in ICT Skill and Capability Development....................... 26 Krassie Petrova, Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand Dawn Medlin, Appalachian State University, USA In recent years significant changes have occurred in the skill sets underpinning the undergraduate information systems and information technology curricula. It is imperative that educators comprehend the needs and demands of the industry where their graduates are going to need to apply their acquired\n\nknowledge and skills. It may be argued that employers and job recruiters also need to be aware of what skill sets and capabilities new graduates may be expected to come equipped with, in order to develop successful strategies for retaining and growing staff in an environment where the demand for professionals in information and communications technologies (ICT) exceeds the supply. In this chapter, a research framework representing the dynamics of the ICT profession supply and demand of graduates with relevant skills and capabilities is used to facilitate the initiation of a dialogue between industry and academia with the objective to identify issues raised from the lack of alignment between the two and to suggest a way of using academic research results to address these issues. The discussion is supported by the findings of two relevant case studies. Chapter III The Impact of New Trends in the Delivery and Utilization of Enterprise ICT on Supplier and User Organizations.......................................................................................................................... 46 Jiri Vorisek, University of Economics Prague, Czech Republic George Feuerlicht, University of Economics Prague, Czech Republic Enterprise information systems have rapidly evolved over the last decade. We expect these changes to accelerate during this decade as a result of new trends in enterprise computing. We argue in this chapter that ICT remains strategically important to organizations in the 21st century despite the prevailing trend to outsource ICT and related business processes. We have identified a number of important trends that include the move towards the software as a service (SaaS) model for enterprise applications, increased commitment to process orientation, and emphasis on managing the relationship between business and ICT using services. These trends lead to more effective management of ICT and closer integration of ICT with entrepreneurial activities and business processes in organizations, resulting in improvements in return on investment. These trends will have dramatic impact on both the suppliers and users of ICT, and will necessitate the reevaluation of the approach to ICT education as both the composition and qualifications of ICT workforce will undergo a fundamental change. Chapter IV Enterprise 2.0: Collaboration and Knowledge Emergence as a Business Web Strategy Enabler.......... 61 Javier Soriano, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain David Lizcano, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain Marcos Reyes, Telefónica I+D, Spain Fernando Alonso, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain Genoveva López, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain This chapter explores the Internet’s present and future potential in relation to information sharing, knowledge management, innovation management, and the automation of cross-organizational business transactions. It points out how a business Web strategy that takes into account this potential will help not only to improve the existing information sharing and knowledge management processes, but also to protect investments in technology that would otherwise have resulted in expensive failures and severe losses. The suggested approach is based on the emerging Web 2.0 vision and will help to minimize the risk of key information and knowledge being lost or simply not being available on time for the stakeholder, projects started and never finished, worse time to market, results not meeting expectations, failure\n\nof global, cross-organizational IT integration processes or even incoherencies between technology and company strategy or structure, and so on. All managers, and particularly IT leaders, must be aware of this new potential and its implications in order to come up with innovative and effective answers to both known and new problems related to information sharing and knowledge management within their organizations. The chapter’s contents are designed to guide entrepreneurs, managers, and IT leaders through the adoption of the latest Internet technologies, such as Web 2.0, Enterprise 2.0, and the global service-oriented architecture, and their application to their everyday work with a view to setting up a business Web strategy. Musser and O’Reilly (2006) claim that by defining and following a set of architecture building blocks, architectural design decisions, and normative guidance, they can build flexible, extensible, and reusable solutions for exploiting the best features of the emerging Web 2.0 technology suite to achieve the best ROI by leveraging the upcoming Web of user-centered services. Chapter V Customer Relationship Management (CRM): An In-Depth Analysis................................................... 94 Mahesh Raisinghani, TWU School of Management, USA Abdu Albur, Ministry of Education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Dhahran, Eastern Province Sue Leferink, Montana Department of Commerce, USA Thomas Lyle, PNC, USA Stephen Proctor, CSC, USA This chapter discusses customer relationship management (CRM) as a customer focused business strategy enhanced by technology that automates and enhances business processes to proactively manage profitable and long-term customer relationships. CRM solutions span a continuum of implementations from a narrow tactical implementation of a specific technical solution to a broad strategic implementation of a customer centric solution. Furthermore, the authors hope that understanding the underlying assumptions and theoretical constructs through the use of CRM will not only inform researchers of a better CRM design for studying e-commerce and Internet marketing, but also assist in the understanding of intricate relationships between different factors. Chapter VI Different Web Strategies for Different E-Marketplaces...................................................................... 118 L. Geppert, Catholic University of Milan, Italy This chapter presents two possible models of electronic marketplaces put in place at the beginning of this century, which, after their introduction, the first incoming wave of connected economy-based paradigms was ended. Both the two models show a particular use of Web-based information technology in order to exploit their mission and represent meaningful cases of application of well-defined Web strategies. Even though, at the moment, the initially built up Web sites supporting those related business have been closed and merged with other Web sites, they may introduce examples of a Web strategy approach having a relevant historical meaning that may be still redefined in practical implementations once revised and adequately updated. The mentioned cases described in this chapter are usteel.com and up2gold. com, two examples of Web-based business in two well-defined supply chains: the “steel” chain and the “gold and silver” chain.\n\nSection II Aligning Web Strategy to Corporate Strategy The second section is dedicated to the subject of the Web strategy alignment with the corporate strategy. The six articles hosted in this section discuss this theme focusing their attention not only on the aspects related to the development of the public presence on the Web (Memmola and Tzannis; Frigerio), but also through an analytical perspective which can either be a technique (Yen; Wen-Chen Hu, Yanjun Zuo, Lei Chen and Chyuan-Huei Thomas Yang), or integrate other technologies (Axel C. Schwickert, Bernard Ostheimer) or integrate cost measurement and performance management processes (Massimo Memmola, Giovanna Palumbo and Mauro Rossini). Chapter VII Trends of Web Services Adoption: A Synthesis................................................................................... 134 Vincent C. Yen, Wright State University, USA The technology of Web services has been a hot area in the software industry for many years. Many organizations in the past 5 years have conducted surveys designed to get a profile of the state of Web services adoption in various subject areas. Some of those survey results are available free from the Internet. Since conducting a large scale Web services survey takes time and significant financial commitment, the research conducted in this chapter is a synthesis from published free survey results. All sources of surveys indicate Web services are being adopted more or less in all mid-size to large organizations because of realized benefits, and are anticipated to become a viable component of information systems infrastructure. Some of the current issues in Web services adoption and implementation are standards, training, and security. Chapter VIII Web & RFId Technology: New Frontiers in Costing and Process Management for Rehabilitation Medicine................................................................................................................. 145 Massimo Memmola, Catholic University, Italy Giovanna Palumbo, Ospedale Valduce, Italy Mauro Rossini, Ospedale Valduce, Italy Radio frequency identification (RFId) has recently begun to receive increased interest from practitioners and academics. This type of technology has been widely used in healthcare organizations for different purposes, like to localize patients, devices, and medical instruments. This chapter presents the results of a study in which we used RFId technology and modern systems of cost management methodologies (e.g., activity-based costing, activity-based management, and process management) in a “proof of application” aimed at defining some specific data on care needs of a person with a disability, costs of the main activities performed during the person’s rehabilitation process, and level of performance which could be reached in order to improve the “disability management” process, from a clinical as well as a managerial perspective.\n\nChapter IX The Web Strategy Development in the Automotive Sector................................................................. 170 Massimo Memmola, Catholic University, Italy Alessandra Tzannis, Catholic University, Italy Especially in recent years, indeed, a transformation is ongoing: the Web, besides being a means of information sharing (internal-external), becomes a powerful tool for saving costs, reducing the distribution structure, initiating distance transactions, and ever more becomes a mechanism of integration with the external environment and a catalyst of experiences for all stakeholder. Starting from the identification of the key elements, potentialities, and of the impact of the Internet on firms’ performance, competitiveness, effectiveness, and efficiency, this chapter is focused on the changes in the automotive sector due to the integration between business strategy and Web strategy. Therefore, starting from the consideration of a clear identification and subsequent sharing need of strategic goals, a research work will be presented exploring, on the basis of an interpretative model, the Internet potential in the automotive sector, in order to achieve the identification of an optimal path definition and development of Web strategy. This objective will be developed through a desk analysis focused on the strategic positioning of the current businesses in the automotive sector (i.e., complexity evaluation of the presence on Internet, strategic architecture, quality, and effectiveness of the presence). Chapter X Adaptive Mobile Web Browsing Using Web Mining Technologies.................................................... 198 Wen-Chen Hu, University of North Dakota, USA Yanjun Zuo, University of North Dakota, USA Lei Chen, Sam Houston State University, USA Chyuan-Huei Thomas Yang, Hsuan Chuang University, Taiwan Using mobile handheld devices such as smart cellular phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) to browse the mobile Internet is a trend of Web browsing. However, the small screens of handheld devices and slow mobile data transmission make the mobile Web browsing awkward. This research applies Web usage mining technologies to adaptive Web viewing for handheld devices. Web usage mining is the application of data mining techniques to the usage logs of large Web data repositories in order to produce results that can be applied to many practical subjects, such as improving Web sites/pages. A Web usage mining system must be able to perform five major functions: (i) usage data gathering, (ii) data preparation, (iii) navigation pattern discovery, (iv) pattern analysis and visualization, and (v) pattern applications. This approach improves the readability and download speed of mobile Web pages. Chapter XI Integration of Public University Web Sites and Learning Management Systems............................... 208 Bernard Ostheimer, University of Giessen, Germany Axel C. Schwickert, University of Giessen, Germany Internet technology has found its way into all areas of business and research. The World Wide Web is also used at universities to achieve different goals. On the one hand, it acts as a means of outer appearance (target groups: potential, current, and former students, researchers, lecturers, press, the interested publicity, etc.), on the other hand, as an instrument of knowledge transfer and knowledge examination (target\n\ngroups: potential, former, and current students and lecturers). There exist other purposes in addition to those named above. Often different systems are used to achieve the different goals: usually, Web content management systems (WCMS) are used for the outer appearance and learning management systems (LMS) for transfer and examination of knowledge. Although these systems use the same medium (i.e., the WWW), it can be stated that often there is a heterogeneous landscape of systems. Resultant is the object of investigation of the present chapter. It analyzes the challenges concerning the integration of public Web sites and learning management systems (LMS) a typical European university has to face. The research framework used for investigation thus can be divided into two categories regarding the system types used: WCMS and LMS. In praxi, there is more than one system per system category implemented at a university because of the organizational conditions explained in this chapter. Chapter XII Innovating through the Web: The Banking Industry Case................................................................... 219 Chiara Frigerio, Universitá Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Italy In recent years, the financial services industry has been witness to considerable consolidation and organizational progress in order to sustain two main objectives: efficiency and commercial effectiveness. In order to sustain customer-oriented and efficiency strategies, banks have started to explore new ways of conducting their business, introducing areas of innovation in their services, practices, and structures to offer the most complete array of services possible. On the other hand, new services and products drive retail banks to explore new ways of producing or delivering these novelties. This is true especially for Internet banking services that offer services to customers 24/7, and it becomes clear that adding new services, that is, trading online or bill payments, is easily and quickly geared towards improving commercial effectiveness. The following chapter aims at describing to what extent the Internet has developed new services and businesses, and what are the main figures of the phenomenon in Europe. Moreover, the Tnternet has introduced new coordination processes within each financial institution. Let us think about Intranet portal, content management tools, and business process management suites, which are now quite spread in banks due mainly to their technological easy of use. Thus, the Internet is representing an innovation wave extremely relevant for the financial industry as a whole, and the effects on banks’ performance is emerging. What do we expect in the near future? In all probability, the usage of Web-based application will be bigger and bigger also in other contexts of the bank processes, even if some risks could occur when clear strategies and change management practices do not direct the innovation. Section III Applications of Web Strategy The six chapters of the third section present the results of research work and empirical evidence on the application of Web strategy’s principles and methodologies in various operational contexts. Chapter XIII An Action Research Case Study of the Facilitators and Inhibitors of E-Commerce Adoption........... 236 Orla Kirwan, National University of Ireland, Ireland Kieran Conboy, National University of Ireland, Ireland\n\nThis research has studied an established Irish retail business as it takes its first tentative steps into the e-commerce arena. Although the adoption of e-commerce is widely studied in the academic world, only a small percentage of these studies focus on the small to medium size enterprise (SME) retail sector. SMEs account for 97% of Irish companies and employ up to 800,000 people (Chamber of Commerce Ireland, 2006). While examining the SME’s adoption of e-commerce, the factors that affected the adoption process were specifically identified and understood. This was achieved by conducting an action research case study. Action research merges research and practice, thus producing exceedingly relevant research findings. This chapter demonstrates how the research was undertaken, and also discusses the justification, benefits, and limitations of using action research. The research concluded that the adoption of e-commerce within the SME sector tends to be slow and fragmented, the presence of a “Web champion” is paramount to the success of the project, and Internet adoption is faster with the recognition of a business need. It also supported the evidence that an SME is more likely to adopt e-commerce when the SME owner has a positive attitude towards IT. Chapter XIV Acceptance of the Mobile Internet as a Distribution Channel for Paid Content in Germany............. 248 Svenja Hagenhoff, University of Goettingen, Germany Christian Kaspar, University of Goettingen, Germany Lutz Seidenfaden, University of Goettingen, Germany Björn Ortelbach, University of Goettingen, Germany This chapter is about a survey based on 7,178 valid responses which analyses the mobile content usage in Germany. Key findings are that paid mobile contents will not be a mass market in the medium term. Nevertheless, we found that respondents that are familiar with mobile radio and handset technology and read specialized printed media on a regular basis showed the highest acceptance of mobile paid contents. The mobile Internet is perceived as a chance for the media industry to generate additional revenues from paid contents. Successful business models for the mobile Internet will only be possible if mobile content formats generate added consumer value. In this context, media companies planning to establish mobile services for content distribution are facing the problem that acceptance of mobile services has not yet been researched thoroughly. Chapter XV Information Quality Satisfaction of Communication Portals: A Study of Central Cyber Government Office (CCGO) of the Hong Kong Government............................................................. 264 Kevin K.W. Ho, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Information quality is critical for a communication portal because there are a myriad of information types, including textual, audio, video, and other complex information types, which an organization has to manage. In this study, we examine whether information generated from an in-house developed communication portal of the Hong Kong government would have higher quality than those sister portals developed by individual government departments using commercial packages. We conducted a surveybased study to understand how users evaluate the information quality of these communication portals. This portal case is interesting because (1) Hong Kong Government has invested millions of US dollars in its implementation and (2) the number of potential users is huge (over 140,000).\n\nChapter XVI The Evaluation of IT Investments through Real Options.................................................................... 277 Maria Alice Frontini, University of São Paulo, Brazil Fernando José Barbin Laurindo, University of São Paulo, Brazil The decisions about IT investments are increasingly more complex, due to technical uncertainties and to the dynamics of organizational and strategic issues. One promising alternative for solving this problem would be the use of real options. Thus, this chapter intends to apply a relatively new methodology, called real options, used in corporate strategy for evaluating and deciding about new investments in IT. In order to do so, an analytic review of the literature is presented, The real options methodology is particularly recommended in two situations: in the case of existence of a significant level of uncertainty about the benefits to be achieved by IT investments, or when IT benefits do not impact directly the current business but create a platform for future investments, capable of producing future new business impacts. Chapter XVII Strategic Use of the Internet and Organizational Structure for E-Business: “Celta” Case at GM Brazil................................................................................................................... 298 Silvia Novaes Zilber, UNINOVE, Brazil The Internet provides a global network infrastructure that is shifting business models, strategies, and processes. Many authors reflect on the importance of incorporating e-business into the firm’s global strategy. This chapter deals with these issues in discussing the introduction of e-business activities by General Motors Brazil, specifically in connection with the launch of the Celta car, an entry-level car designed to be sold on the Internet. A historical examination of e-business strategy shows that many organizations have formulated excellent conceptual strategies for e-business but failed to deliver sound execution. A key to successful Internet strategies is the leadership shown by senior management. Technological demands may also conflict with the successful implementation of e-business initiatives, requiring greater interaction between the CEO and CIO. The organizational structure implemented for the launching and sales of the Celta car warranted the integration between employees on the business side and in IT in the context of GM Brazil’s strategic objective of growing the market share for lowerpriced cars. Chapter XVIII On the Use of Soft Computing Techniques for Web Personalization.................................................. 318 G. Castellano, University of Bari, Italy A. M. Fanelli, University of Bari, Italy M. A. Torsello, University of Bari, Italy Due to the growing variety and quantity of information available on the Web, there is urgent need for developing Web-based applications capable of adapting their services to the needs of the users. This is the main rationale behind the flourishing area of Web personalization that finds in soft computing (SC) techniques a valid tool to handle uncertainty in Web usage data and develop Web-based applications tailored to user preferences. The main reason for this success seems to be the synergy resulting from SC paradigms, such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. Each of these computing paradigms provides complementary reasoning and searching methods that allow the use of domain\n\nknowledge and empirical data to solve complex problems. In this chapter, we emphasize the suitability of hybrid schemes combining different SC techniques for the development of effective Web personalization systems. In particular, we present a neuro-fuzzy approach for Web personalization that combines techniques from the fuzzy and the neural paradigms to derive knowledge from Web usage data and represent the knowledge in the comprehensible form of fuzzy rules. The derived knowledge is ultimately used to dynamically suggest interesting links to the user of a Web site.

In this fast changing world, it is not easy to predict the future. To fully grasp the way the Internet has changed our lives, consider how you worked and lived ten years ago and compare that to your current habits. Now try to extrapolate into the future and imagine living in this world in the year 2018. Amazingly, in 1946 a science fiction author using the nom de plume of ‘Murray Leinster’ introduced the concept of the Internet in his short story ‘A Logic Named Joe’. As highlighted by Franson (2001), Leinster’s story included desktop computers in virtually all homes and businesses with country-wide networked databases (including video), keyboards and vision screens, natural language interface, interactive customizable software, and online financial and weather reports. Unfortunately we do not all have Leinster’s crystal ball and so we need to take a formal approach to strategic planning. The provision of IT services to business is more complex then ever before. Many organisations engage in an intricate network of contracts involving providers of software, services, infrastructure, and data sources. The global economy has opened endless options include outsourcing and off-shoring IT development and service management. There are many stakeholders involved in IT today – no longer does IT focus on supporting back-office processes. Increasingly, thanks to the Internet, customers and suppliers have direct access to corporate data, systems and services. It has become more important than ever before for IT management to participate in business strategy formulation. An organisation’s ability to implement corporate strategies and achieve corporate goals depends on its capacity to effectively use IT. Investment in IT, and especially in web technologies can provide six strategic business objectives: operational excellence; new products, services and business models; customer and supplier intimacy; better decision making; competitive advantage; and ultimately, survival (Laudon & Laudon 2006). Organisations find it challenging to ensure adequate governance and compliance requirements are met whilst retaining the flexibility and agility to respond to changes in the market. It is difficult to balance the temptation to adopt ‘bleeding’ edge business models and technology while remaining cognizant of concerns about the business value and risks of such investment. This book provides a wealth of information across the lifecycle of web-enabled business processes from strategy through design to implementation. Managers need to be aware of new technologies such as RFID and mobile devices which have the potential to extend the reach and richness of information to enhance the relationship between the organisations and its customers. Another important contribution of this book is in its presentation of rigorous recent academic research to the practitioner community. Many chapters offer insights by describing real-life applications which span public and private sectors. These case studies describe best practices and also provide valuable les-\n\nxvii\n\nsons learned to industry leaders. Others suggest innovative business models and frameworks to evaluate the business benefits from web-based business systems. I hope that this book provides valuable and timely assistance to researchers, IT practitioners and business managers to look to the future and see the possibilities from the increasing trends of Internet adoption and web-based applications.

The book covers theoretical and conceptual frameworks, concepts, trends, challenges and opportunities, performance measurement, and applications of Web strategies. It comprises 18 chapters organized into three sections: Web strategy design, Web strategy alignment, and Web strategy applications. The book provides insights and support for researchers, managers, and practitioners concerned with the subject of strategic approach to the Internet.\n\nInt roduct ion The Internet is fully integrated into western societies, and is rapidly growing in developing economies. Via the Web we can search for information, make communicate, establish social relations, buy goods and services, play games, carry out financial transactions, study educational courses, and much more. The Web potential and its exploitation will certainly grow further thanks to the spread of mobile communication devices, a process which has already started. The Web has changed our way of living, our habits, the way we work, the way we interact with the people we know, and, all in all, the way we deal with the thousands of tasks we are confronted with in our daily lives. We do not need to go personally to a bank any longer, we order bank transfers or check our balances by connecting to our bank’s Web site. We just click on the site of a tour operator and carry out the required operations to book our holidays. If we are looking for software that meets our requirements but we do not want to bear the expenses of the related licenses, we just need to find it in one of the many open-source communities that are present on the Web. If we want to tell other Web users about ourselves, about what we do, our hobbies, and maybe even our dreams, what we need to do is to open a blog. Likewise, if we want to establish a social network or expand it, we can simply access one of the many free or pay-services present on the Web, such as Facebook, Myspace, and so forth. We could present an endless list of examples here. We may even go further and say that people live increasingly more on the Web. To be more precise, actions, relations, and in general certain moments in our lives up to some time ago could have taken place only in the real world, but are now progressively moving onto the Web virtuality. Naturally, this transition from reality to virtuality inevitably modifies the way we interact with each others and with time and costs. The following statistics provides an up-to-date picture of percentage and growth of Internet users population:\n\nxix\n\n1.\n\nThe number of Internet users in the world reached 1.4 billion persons in 2007; that is one fifth of the world population (Internetworldstats, 2008). 2. Web access is common nowadays in the most economically developed areas of the world: about two out of three U.S. citizens (71.1%) regularly access the Internet. In Australia and in Europe the percentage of Internet users is 57.1% and 43.4%, respectively. In Europe, however, there are some geographical areas where Internet penetration is considerably higher than the North American average; this is true for Norway (88%), the Netherlands (87.8%), and Iceland (85.4%) (Internetworldstats, 2008). 3. The Internet is growing exponentially. The number of Internet users increased globally by 265.6% during the period 2000-2007 (Internetworldstats, 2008). 4. Interestingly, the growth rate in the number of Internet users in the developing countries during 2000-2007 is higher than that in developed countries (Internetworldstats, 2008). The increase in the number of Internet users in North America, Australia, and Europe in the period 2000-2007 was equal to 120.2%, 151.6%, and 231.2%, respectively. The growth rates of Internet users in Middle East (920.2%), Africa (882.7%), Latin America (598.5%), and Asia (346.8%) are astoundingly high growth rates. 5. The global number of Web sites was approximately 550 million in January 2008, witnessing an increase by 25% as against the same period in 2007 and by roughly 648% in comparison with January 2000 (Internet System Consortium, 2008). 6. A survey carried out by Burst Media (2008) finds 67.7% of the respondents (13,000 Web users) emphasize that their daily routine would be disrupted if Internet access was not available for one week. Furthermore, 42.9% of respondents stress that the daily disruption would be significant. 7. The same survey finds that the majority of Internet users 45 years and older believe online content is focused on younger age segments (Burst Media, 2008). The survey finds that younger respondents are interested more on entertainment information (44.7%) in comparison to only 34.1% for shopping and product information. While older respondents indicate that they regularly seek local/national news (55.9%) followed by shopping/product information (44.0%). 8. A survey carried out by Nielsen (2008a) in the U.S. shows that 146.6 million users accessed Internet during March 2008, 51.35% of them women. The amount of time spent online nearly reaches 71 hours/month for men and 65 hours/month for women. 9. Nielsen (2008b) reports an estimated 8 billion searches were conducted in the U.S. during April 2008. An estimated of 62% of the search queries were conducted at Google Search. 10. The Internet in the UK is mainly used to send e-mails (91%), access general information (82%), purchase (72%), manage bank accounts (57%), download music, films, and videos (46%), play games (36%), chat or talk (40%), and trade online (16%) (Ofcom, 2005). Virtually, all organizations in developed countries create Web pages to advertise their product/services. Literature indicates that firms rely on Web access for variety of reasons, including increasing efficiency, enhancing effectiveness, cost reduction, sharing of managerial know-how, time-to-market reduction, customer satisfaction, improved corporate image and branding policies, and increasing market share (Barua, Whinston, & Yin, 2000; Bovet & Martha, 2000; Cox & Koelzer, 2004; Evans & Wurster, 2000; Porter, 2001; Ries & Ries, 2002; Wilson, 2002). Empirical studies indicate high satisfaction of organizations from the investment on Web technologies. A worldwide survey indicates that more than half surveyed organizations (2847 respondents) declare to be satisfied with the outcome of their investments on Web technologies over the past five years; almost three-quarters of the interviewed companies declare to be wanting to continue or increase the invest-\n\nxx\n\nments in Web technologies in the coming years (McKinsey, 2007). A recent survey (Awareness, 2008) shows that 96% of the surveyed organizations are happy with their investment on Web technologies. The survey concludes that the Web can be used to improve communication and collaboration (91% of surveyed organizations), selection and allocation of professional resources (81%), sharing information (78%), and increase brand awareness and customer retention (64%). Notwithstanding the benefits of investment on Web technologies for organizations’ well-being, studies highlight a concern among firms that the Web may create additional managerial problems and may not actually be the panacea for their existing problems and when an organization has managerial problems it will probably translate the same problems to the virtual space. Outcomes of some empirical studies reflect detrimental and adverse outcomes: 1. 2. 3.\n\nAn empirical study conducted by Clearswift (2007) reveals that 23% of 700 directors of human resources involved in the study are not familiar with the Web technologies. According to the research carried out by Awareness (2008), 53% of the respondent organizations state that they are not aware of how the social media tools of Web technologies could be useful to their company. The empirical study carried by Clearswift (2007) shows that 72% of organization do not allow accessing social networking sites during business hours for a variety of reasons, including concerns about lowered productivity (85%), security and leak of confidential information (58%), sites content (39%), and the ownership of intellectual property placed on those sites (31%).\n\nAim of the B ook and Target Aud ience There has been evidence which highlights how investments in technology have often resulted in expensive failures and severe losses because: projects started and never finished, results did not meet expectations, there was incoherence between technology and company strategy or structure; and of the inability to evaluate results, and, therefore, it was difficult to know if the initiative had been successful or not (Fattah, 2002; Minard, 2001, 2002; Iacovou & Dexter, 2005; Kappelman, McKeeman, & Zhang, 2006). These studies point to the lack of a sound Web strategy and a gap between the firm Web strategy and other strategies, including corporate strategy and ICT strategy (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. The interaction of Web strategy with other strategies and actors\n\nw eb s t RAt e g y\n\nIc t s t RAt e g y\n\ne xt e Rn Al Ac t o Rs (c us t o me Rs)\n\nInt e RnAl Ac t o Rs (e mPl o y e e s )\n\nc o RPo RAt e s t RAt e g y\n\nxxi\n\nLike any other project entailing technology and changes in the way people work within an organization, the skills of employees and their competence are critical elements in the planning of a Web wtrategy (Internal actors—Figure 1). In addition, the positive interaction or satisfaction of customers (external actors—Figure 1) with the organization’s Web forms one of the major challenges for the organization willing to develop a successful Web strategy. This book addresses the gap in business Web strategy, considering positive interaction of external actors as well as skills and competence of internal actors. It aims to present cutting-edge research on the theory, applications, and challenges facing the design, development,t and implementation of the Web strategy. This book is mainly oriented to people who, for different reasons, recognize that the Web is a powerful tool for supporting business strategy. Managers such as CEOs, general directors, plan and control responsible, and IT responsible will be considered as privileged actors. In general, the natural users of this book will be not only the ICT vendors, but also those managers, consultants, and trainers who must offer innovative and effective answers in this new business field. The Web strategy topic, both in industry and in academies, has grown rapidly over the past decade, and continues to grow. The book provides insights and support for the following groups of people: • •\n\nProfessionals and researchers in the field of information system in general and in Web strategy in particular. Managers, practitioners, and consultants called to work out the most efficient and effective solutions for Web strategy, design, and implementation.\n\nB ook S t ructu re The book comprises 18 chapters organized into three sections: design, alignment, and applications. The following is a brief description of each section and the chapters included in them.\n\nSection I. Design Web Strategy The first section of this book features six chapters that deal with customer value and various trends, patterns, and methodologies affecting the design of Web strategy. The first chapter, “Using Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications” is authored by Pankaj Kamthan and Hsueh-Ieng Pai, who present a methodology for deploying patterns for improving the quality of e-commerce applications and identifying relevant quality attributes. The authors analyse the role of development processes and the challenges facing optimal use of patterns. They explore the use of patterns during macro and microarchitecture design of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce applications. Web technology has a strong impact on corporate processes and ultimately, requires new ICT skills and new training paths. “Informing Industry via Academic Research in ICT Skill and Capability Development” by Krassie Petrova and B. Dawn deal with these two aspects. This chapter designs a framework representing the dynamics of the ICT supply and demand for graduates with relevant skills and capabilities. The framework facilitates the dialogue between industry and academia, aiming to identify issues raised from the lack of alignment between the two and to suggest a pathway for using academic research results to address industry requirements. The framework is supported by the findings of two relevant case studies.\n\nxxii\n\nInternet does not only change processes, but also corporates logic and attitude toward ICT. Within the same scope of Chapter II, Jiri Vorisek and George Feuerlicht, in Chapter III, “The Impact of New Trends in the Delivery and Utilization of Enterprise ICT on Supplier and User Organizations” have identified a number of important trends within the framework of “software as a service (SaaS)” model. These trends lead to more effective ICT management of ICT. The authors emphasize that these trends will have dramatic impact on both the suppliers and users of ICT, and will necessitate the reevaluation of approaches to ICT education. The logic for Web usage has been changing quickly over the past years. Javier Soriano, David Lizcano, Marcos Reyes, Fernando Alonso, and Genoveva López, in their chapter, entitled, “Enterprise 2.0: Collaboration and Knowledge Emergence as a Business Web Strategy Enabler,” explore the Internet’s present and future potential in relation to information sharing, knowledge management, innovation management, and the automation of cross-organizational business transactions. They point out how a business Web strategy protects investments in technology that would otherwise have resulted in expensive failures and severe losses. The chapter guides entrepreneurs, managers, and IT leaders through the adoption of the latest Internet technologies, such as Web 2.0, Enterprise 2.0, and global service oriented architecture with a view of setting up an effective business Web strategy. The fifth chapter is this section, entitled, “Customer Relationship Management (CRM): An In-Depth Analysis” by Michael Raisinghani, Abdu Albur, Sue Leferink, Thomas Lyle, and Stephen Proctor, discusses customer relationship management (CRM) as a customer-focused business strategy that enhances business processes to proactively manage profitable and long-term customer relationships. The authors argue that understanding the underlying assumptions and theoretical constructs of CRM is an important factor for designing effective Web strategy. Luigi Geppert in Chapter VI, “Different Web Strategies for Different E-Marketplaces,” presents two possible models for electronic marketplaces. Both models show a particular use of Web-based information technology representing meaningful cases for application of well-defined Web strategies.\n\nSection II. Aligning Web Strategy to Corporate Strategy The second section of this book contains six chapters focusing on the alignment of Web strategy with other business strategies. The chapters discusses the Web strategy alignment from various perspectives, including public presence on the Web (Memmola, Tzannis, and Frigerio), analytical perspective (Yen, Hu, Zuo, Chen and Yang), integrating technologies (Schwickert and Ostheimer), or cost measurement and performance management (Memmola, Palumbo, and Rossini). Many organizations in the past 5 years have conducted surveys designed to get a profile of the implementation of Web services in various subject areas. In the first chapter of this section, “Trends of Web Services Adoption: A Synthesis”, Vincent C. Yen develops analyses of the results of these surveys. The chapter shows that all sources of surveys indicate that Web services are being adopted almost in all medium and large organizations because of realized benefits, and is to become a viable component of the information systems infrastructure. Some of the current issues in Web services adoption and implementation are standards, training and security. Radio frequency identification (RFID) has recently begun to receive increased interest from practitioners and academics. This type of technology has been widely used in healthcare organizations for different purposes. In Chapter VIII, entitled, “Web and RFId Technology: New Frontiers in Costing and Process Management for Rehabilitation Medicine,” Massimo Memmola, Giovanna Palumbo, and Mauro Rossini present the results of a study in which they integrate RFID with Web technology for a test application aimed at defining some specific data on care needs of a disabled person, costs of the\n\nxxiii\n\nmain activities performed during this person’s rehabilitation process, and level of performance that could be reached in order to improve the “disability management” process, from a clinical as well as a managerial perspective. Mobile handheld devices such as smart cellular phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are used to browse the mobile Internet. However, the small screens of handheld devices and the slow mobile data transmission make the mobile Web browsing awkward. In Chapter X, entitled “Adaptive Mobile Web Browsing Using Web Mining Technologies,” Wen-Chen Hu, Yanjun Zuo, Lei Chen, and Chyuan-Huei Thomas Yang present a research that applies Web usage mining technologies to handheld devices. Web usage mining is the application of data mining techniques to the usage logs of large Web data repositories in order to produce results that can be applied to many practical subjects, such as improving Web sites/pages. A Web usage mining system must be able to perform five major functions: (a) usage data gathering; (b) data preparation; (c) navigation pattern discovery; (d) pattern analysis and visualization; and (e) pattern applications. This approach improves the readability and download speed of mobile Web pages. Axel Schwickert and Bernard Ostheimer, in Chapter XI, “Integration of Public University Web Sites and Learning Management Systems,” address the Web’s potentials supporting learning pathways at universities. The World Wide Web is used as an instrument of knowledge transfer and knowledge examination. The chapter addresses the utilization of Web content management systems (WCMS) for learning management systems (LMS) to transfer and the examination of knowledge. Chiara Frigerio, in her chapter named “Innovating through the Web: The Banking Industry Case,” deals with the Web’s strategic role in the banking industry. The chapter provides statistics indicating significant increases in the utilization of Web technologies during 2001-2007. The chapter describes in details the role of Internet in facilitating services and developing new products for the banking industry.\n\nSection III. Applications of Web Strategy The third section of the book presents six chapters focusing in the Web strategy applications. It contains results from several case studies and empirical research. In Chapter XIII, entitled, “An Action Research Case Study of the Facilitators and Inhibitors of ECommerce Adoption,” Orla Kirwan and Kieran Conboy study the adoption of e-commerce by small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). The authors employ action research methodology and use an established Irish retail business as a case study. The authors demonstrate how the research was undertaken, and discuss the justification, benefits, and limitations of using action research. The research concludes that the adoption of e-commerce within the SME sector tends to be slow and fragmented. It also supports the evidence that an SME is more likely to adopt e-commerce when the SME owner has a positive attitude toward IT. Chapter XIV, “Acceptance of the Mobile Internet as Distribution Channel for Paid Content in Germany,” by Svenja Hagenhoff, Christian Kaspar, Lutz Seidenfaden, and Björn Ortelbach presents a survey based on 7,178 valid responses which analyses the mobile content usage in Germany. The authors found that respondents who are familiar with mobile radio and handset technology and read specialized printed media on a regular basis show the highest acceptance of mobile paid contents. The mobile Internet is perceived as a chance for the media industry to generate additional revenues from paid contents. The authors conclude that media companies planning to establish mobile services for content distribution are facing the problem that acceptance of mobile services has not yet been researched thoroughly. Information quality is critical for communication portals because there are myriads of information types, including textual, audio, video, and other complex information types. Kevin K.W. Ho, in his\n\nxxiv\n\nchapter entitled, “Information Quality Satisfaction of Communication Portals: A Study of Central Cyber Government Of.ce (CCGO) of the Hong Kong Government,” presents a study that examines whether information generated from an in-house developed communication portal of the Hong Kong government would have higher quality than those portals developed by individual government departments using commercial packages. He conducted a survey-based study to understand how users evaluate the information quality of these communication portals. The case-study presented in the chapter is interesting because (1) the Hong Kong government has invested millions of US dollars in its implementation and (2) the number of potential users is huge (over 140,000 users). Performance assessments of Web projects and IT investments in general is one of the most debated subjects in literature. Maria Alice Frontini and Fernando Jose Barbin, Laurindo present an interesting methodological approach to the subject, based on the “real options” method. The chapter, entitled “The Evaluation of IT Investments through Real Options,” underlines how chief information officers (CIOs) face prejudice from top management, and who are concerned with the real benefits that IT can bring to business. This chapter concludes that the technological uncertainties make it very difficult to estimate the value that can be extracted from the usage of new IT solutions. Silvia Novaes Zilber, in her chapter, “Strategic Use of the Internet and Organizational Structure for E-Business: “Celta” Case at GM Brazil,” presents an interesting study about the introduction of e-business activities by General Motors Brazil, specifically in connection with the launch of the Celta car, which is an entry-level car designed to be sold on the Internet. The organizational structure implemented for the launching and sales of the Celta car warranted the integration between employees on both business and information technology (IT) sides, in the context of GM Brazil’s strategic objective of growing the market share for lower-price cars. The last chapter of the book, Chapter XVIII, is authored by G. Castellano, A. M. Fanelli, and M. A. Torsello and is entitled “On the Use of Soft Computing Techniques for Web Personalization”. The authors discuss Web-based applications and emphasize that these applications become increasingly necessary, because of the growing variety and quantity of information available on the Web. In their chapter, the authors emphasise the suitability of hybrid schemes combining different soft computing (SC) techniques for the development of effective Web personalization systems. In particular, the authors present a neurofuzzy approach for Web personalization that combines the fuzzy and the neural paradigms to derive knowledge from Web usage data and represent it in the comprehensible form of fuzzy rules.\n\nRefe rences Awareness.

A methodology for deploying patterns as means for improving the quality of e-commerce applications is presented. To that regard, relevant quality attributes and corresponding stakeholder types for the e-commerce applications are identified. The role of development process, the challenges in making optimal use of patterns, and feasibility issues involved in doing so, are analyzed. The activities of a systematic selection and application of patterns are explored. Examples illustrating the use of patterns during macro- and micro-architecture design of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce applications are given. The implications of the use of patterns in a Semantic Web context are briefly highlighted.\n\nInt roduct ion Over the past decade, electronic commerce (ecommerce) (Kalakota & Whinston, 1996) has opened new vistas for many sectors of society including businesses and has revolutionized the way business is conducted. In particular, e-com-\n\nmerce applications have revolutionized the way business is conducted today, and reduced the gap between small-and-medium size enterprises (SMEs) and large corporations. Although e-commerce applications have offered rich prospects, they have also brought various concerns to the providers (Kamthan, 1999).\n\nCopyright © 2009, IGI Global, distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited.\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nIndeed, the successes have come with their share of failures (Nguyen, Johnson, & Hackett, 2003), many of which have been attributed to issues of quality (Pertet & Narasimhan, 2005). A commitment to “high-quality” is both an imperative and a challenge to the providers of e-commerce applications. Indeed, empirical studies have shown (Sharkey, Scott, & Acton, 2006) that the quality of an e-commerce application is directly related to its “dimensions” of success. At the same time, it is crucial that efforts towards assuring the quality of these applications remain predictable and feasible in the long-term. In this chapter, our interest is in a systematic approach of engineering large-scale and qualitycentric e-commerce applications based on the knowledge garnered from past experience and expertise (Kamthan, 2008). For that, we rely on the notion of the problem-solving approach of patterns (Appleton, 1997; Buschmann, Henney, & Schmidt, 2007). As discussed later, the use of patterns has several advantages over other approaches in terms of quality improvement, including that the approach is preventative rather than curative (Dromey, 2003), is supported by developmental processes, and provides practical solutions along with their reasoning for problems that have been tackled in the past. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. We first outline the background necessary for the discussion that follows, and state our position in that regard. This is followed by the presentation of a pattern-oriented electronic commerce applications methodology (POECAM) for systematically addressing the quality of e-commerce applications. POECAM includes a model consisting of quality attributes at different tiers and the role of patterns as means for addressing them. Next, challenges and directions for future research are outlined. Finally, concluding remarks are given.\n\nBa ckg round In this section, we present the motivation for a systematic approach to address the quality in e-commerce applications and a synopsis of patterns.\n\nC hallenges to D evelopment of E -C ommerce Applications There are certain defining characteristics that make e-commerce applications unique compared to other software applications, and lead to special considerations towards their quality management. The market may often dictate the direction of the development and the evolution of an ecommerce application. Typically, e-commerce applications have relatively short time-to-market. This additional constraint on scheduling can adversely impact the activities related to quality assurance and evaluation that the provider of an e-commerce application needs to contend with. For example, a provider may have to compromise the time allocated to verification (say, via inspections or testing). Furthermore, the information in e-commerce applications may also have to be frequently modified to reflect the state-of-the-art and/or to maintain competitive advantage. The consumers of an e-commerce application need not be colocated; indeed, they may be in different jurisdictions in the same country or in different countries. The laws that govern the provider and the consumers of an e-commerce application may be different. For example, let A and B be two different jurisdictions and let P be a product available for purchase in jurisdiction A. Then, although browsing information on P may be legal in B, purchasing it may not be.\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nThe consumers of an e-commerce application may reside in different locales with different time zones. The expectations of the consumers with respect to the uninterrupted servability of the application can place unique constraints on the providers, particularly towards maintenance. There can also be stark variations in the personal preferences and abilities of consumers and their computing environments. For example, it cannot be assumed that every consumer may be familiar with the intricacies of the Web or that the consumer may be using a high-end computer with a specific user agent. The providers of e-commerce applications need to deal with such diversity. The “faceless” nature of e-commerce can contribute to unfavorable perceptions related to trustworthiness, particularly in the time of crisis, such as (frequent) failed transactions. The providers of e-commerce applications once again need to take steps to establish credibility (Kamthan, 2007a) with the consumers.\n\nAn E ngineering View of E -C ommerce Applications The need for managing increasing size and complexity of Web applications and the necessity of a planned development has led to the discipline of Web engineering (Ginige & Murugesan, 2001), which has been treated comprehensively in recent years (Kappel, Pröll, Reich, & Retschitzegger, 2006; Mendes & Mosley, 2006; Rossi, Pastor, Schwabe, & Olsina, 2008). We define Web engineering as a discipline concerned with the establishment and the use of sound scientific, engineering, and management principles and disciplined and systematic approaches to the successful development, deployment, and maintenance of Web applications. For the sake of this chapter, we will consider an e-commerce application to belong to a special\n\nclass of Web applications that is product of a Web engineering process. In particular, an e-commerce application can be viewed as a heterogeneous combination of views, that is, an interactive information system in a distributed (client-server) environment with a commercial intent.\n\nQuality of E -C ommerce Applications There are different views of quality (Wong, 2006). From the ISO/IEC 9126-1: 2001 Standard, we define quality to be the totality of characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs. In our case, this entity is an e-commerce application. The need for e-commerce applications to exhibit “high-quality” is critical to all stakeholders involved. If unaddressed, there is a potential for a resource in an e-commerce application to be inaccessible by a visually impaired customer, abruptly crash upon customer interaction, or be prohibitive to maintenance by an engineer. This could seriously impact the viability and evolvability of the e-commerce application in question, and undermine the bottom line of the business that owns the application. There have been a few initiatives for addressing the quality of e-commerce applications (Albuquerque & Belchior, 2002; Hasan & Abuelrub, 2006; Offutt, 2002; Oliveira & Joia, 2005; Stefani & Xenos, 2001). However, these efforts are limited by one or more of the following issues: although the quality attributes relevant to e-commerce applications are given, the relationships between them including trade-offs are not always indicated; the results are restricted to empirical studies based on one class of e-commerce applications; means for addressing the quality attributes are either suggested informally or not at all; or the focus is less on assurance (prevention) and more on evaluation (cure).\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nT he Interplay of Patterns, D evelopment Process, and Quality of E -C ommerce Applications The reliance on past experience and expertise is critical to any development. A pattern is an entity of knowledge that provides a proven solution to a recurring problem in a given context (Appleton, 1997). Formally, a pattern is typically described (Meszaros & Doble, 1998) using an ordered list of elements (highlighted in italics in the rest of the chapter) labeled as (pattern) name, author, context, problem, forces, solution, example, and related patterns. At times, the labels may vary across community, and other (optional) elements, such as those related to metadata, may be included to enrich the description. The name element of a pattern is often a metaphor reflecting what the solution may be about, the author element gives the identity of the pattern author(s), the context element provides the situation or preconditions within which the problem occurs, the forces element provides the constraints that are resolved to arrive at a solution, the solution element provides an abstract solution to the problem and is shown to work in practice via an example element, and the related patterns element outlines any other pattern(s) to which a pattern is related to in some way. In the past decade, patterns have been discovered in a variety of domains of interest, including those that are applicable to the development of Web applications in general and e-commerce in particular. There are collections of patterns available in print form (Adams, Koushik, Vasudeva, & Galambos, 2001; Marks & Hong, 2006; Montero, Lozano, & González, 2002; Rossi & Koch, 2002; Rossi, Lyardet, & Schwabe, 2000; Van Duyne, Landay, & Hong, 2003; Weiss, 2003). There are collections of patterns also available in electronic form (over the Web) such as the Portland Pattern\n\nRepository, the Amsterdam Collection of Interaction Design Patterns, and the Yahoo! Design Pattern Library. Indeed, patterns have been used for the development of certain e-commerce applications (Garzotto, Paolini, Bolchini, & Valenti, 1999; Markiewicz, Lucena, Alencar, & Cowan, 2002; Montero et al., 2002; Montero, López-Jaquero, & Molina, 2003). However, in these cases, the relation of patterns to any development process and/or to the improvement of quality is not discussed explicitly. In general, patterns are especially suitable as means for addressing quality concerns. They go through a comprehensive review by other experts in the domain that enables them to be appropriately described and documented. They provide solutions that are specific to problems in a given context, balance competing forces, are based on established principles, are rationalized, and are proven to work in practical situations. The evaluation of usability of e-commerce applications by determining the absence/presence of design patterns has been carried out (Georgiakakis, Psaromiligkos, & Retalis, 2006; Sartzetaki, Psaromiligkos, Retalis, & Avgeriou, 2003). There are some patterns available specifically for addressing maintainability concerns of ecommerce applications (Weiss, 2003). However, in some cases the solutions are highly technology-specific, not all the mandatory elements of a pattern are appropriately documented, and the integration of patterns into any development process is not mentioned. There are also some patterns available for addressing usability concerns of e-commerce applications (Graham, 2003; Perzel & Kane, 1999). However, usability is viewed as an atomic (nondecomposable) concept, the patterns are strongly oriented towards user-interface design, and their integration into any user-centered development process is not shown explicitly.\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nA S ystem at ic Appro ach fo r Integ rat ing Patte rns in E -C omme rce Appl ic at ions In this section, we introduce POECAM, which is inspired by previous work on integrating patterns and Web engineering (Kamthan, 2008). POECAM consists of the following interrelated and nonlinear sequence of steps: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.\n\nSetting Goals Identifying Stakeholders Selecting the Development Process Model Identifying and Organizing Quality Concerns Acquiring and Selecting Suitable Patterns Applying Patterns\n\nFrom a practical standpoint of integrating patterns in e-commerce applications, each of the steps\n\nmust be feasible. If it is not, we revert back to it and move forward once the necessary modifications are made. The feasibility study could be a part of the overall e-commerce application project management planning activity. Figure 1 gives an overview of the steps in POECAM. We now discuss the work involved in each of these six steps in detail.\n\nS tep O ne: S etting G oals It is known that a project without clear goals will not achieve its goals clearly (Gilb, 1988). A POECAM approach must be based upon high-level organizational (business), social, and/or technical goals that need to be accomplished. For instance, a technical goal for integrating patterns in the overall development strategy could be to rely on past experience and expertise in the domain to produce high-quality e-commerce ap-\n\nFigure 1.

For a goal to be realized in practice, however, it must also be feasible.\n\nS tep T wo: Identifying S takeholders There are systematic approaches for identification and refinement of stakeholder classes (Sharp, Galal, & Finkelstein, 1999). We identify two broad classes of stakeholders with respect to their roles in relationship to an e-commerce application: a producer (provider, manager, engineer, or maintainer) is the one who develops, deploys, or maintains the e-commerce application, and a consumer (novice or expert user) is the one who uses the e-commerce application for some purpose. We emphasize that the above classification is based on the role of a stakeholder. For example, both the engineer and the user could be the same person, but their roles with respect to the interaction with an e-commerce application are different. The viewpoint-oriented requirements definition (VORD) (Kotonya & Sommerville, 1998) also gives us a way of classifying aforementioned stakeholders of interactive systems in a clientserver environment such as e-commerce applications. From a VORD perspective, the provider and the manager are indirect viewpoints, while the engineer and the maintainer are direct viewpoints in their relationship to the e-commerce application.\n\nS tep T hree: S electing the D evelopment Process Model The inclusion of patterns in the development of e-commerce applications cannot be ad-hoc or an afterthought. We recommend POECAM within the framework of an existing process environment that already has broad community and tool support in order to keep the cost to a minimum and the learning curve low.\n\nIn light of the unique characteristics of e-commerce applications, is crucial that the development process be flexible and user-centered. A flexible user-centric process for developing e-commerce applications will typically be nonlinear (iterative and incremental) and, to that regard, we recommend the adoption of one of the following process models. Extreme programming (XP) (Beck & Andres, 2005) is a mature and broadly-used agile methodology for software development. XP places “lightweight” requirements on resources and is suitable for SMEs. On the other hand, the unified process (UP) (Jacobson, Booch, & Rumbaugh, 1999) is an archetype of model-based and uses a case-driven process framework, of which the rational unified process (RUP) (Kruchten, 2004) is an instance. RUP requires heavy business and technical modeling and documentation, and is especially suited for large businesses. Both XP (Kappel et al., 2006; Wallace, Raggett, & Aufgang, 2002) and RUP (Kappel et al., 2006) have been “customized” for Web applications and by reference to e-commerce applications. There is provision of the use of patterns during the design phase in both XP and RUP.\n\nS tep F our: Identifying and O rganizing Quality C oncerns For the purpose of this chapter, we focus on the semiotic quality of e-commerce applications. From a semiotics (Shanks, 1999; Stamper, 1992) viewpoint, we can view an e-commerce application as an information system on six interrelated levels: physical, empirical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and social. In this chapter, we shall restrict ourselves to the discussion of the pragmatic level, which is responsible for the relation of signs to their interpreters. Next, we contend that pragmatic quality is a multidimensional concept, and decompose it into granular levels that consist of known attributes that can be addressed directly or indirectly. For the definitions of these quality attributes, we\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nresort to the IEEE Standard 1061-1998, the ISO 9241-11:1998 Standard, and the ISO/IEC 9126-1: 2001 Standard. Finally, we assign patterns as means for improving the quality attributes. Table 1 summarizes this construction. We contend that the quality attributes in Table 1 are necessary, but make no claim of their sufficiency. We also note that the pragmatic quality attributes (discussed later) in Table 1 cannot (at least mathematically), with respect to stakeholders, be completely satisfied. For example, an a priori guarantee that an e-commerce application will be usable to all users at all times in all computing environments that the users deploy, is not realistic. The quality attributes in Table 1 are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, the quality attributes in Tier 3 depend on that in Tier 2, which in turn depend on Tier 1. For example, if a user cannot read, the user cannot comprehend the information in an e-commerce application, and thereby cannot use it to its full potential. Similarly, for an e-commerce application to be reliable, it must be available.\n\nFurthermore, the quality attributes within the same tier in Table 1 are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, the steps taken towards improving reliability (say, fault tolerance) may lead to redundant source code or data (that can be unfavorable to maintainability) but enable easeof-use (that can be favorable to usability).\n\nThe Quality-Stakeholder Contract For the sake of this chapter, we view pragmatic quality as a contract between an e-commerce application and a stakeholder. For simplicity, we will limit ourselves to the discussion of (not necessarily mutually exclusive) stakeholders of the type end-user and engineer. The relevance of quality attributes in Table 1 varies with respect to stakeholder types: •\n\nPragmatic-Tier 1. The quality attributes of direct concern to an end-user are aesthetics, availability, familiarity, and readability. The quality attribute of direct concern to an engineer is space and time efficiency.\n\nTable 1. A model for the pragmatic quality of e-commerce applications Semiotic Level\n\nQuality Attributes\n\nMeans for Quality Assurance\n\nSocial Quality Concerns [Tier 3] Maintainability, Usability Pragmatic\n\n[Tier 2] Comprehensibility, Performance, Reliability\n\nPatterns\n\n[Tier 1] Aesthetics, Availability, Efficiency, Familiarity, Readability Physical, Empirical, Syntactic, and Semantic Quality Concerns\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nPragmatic-Tier 2. The quality attributes of direct concern to an end-user are comprehensibility, performance, and reliability. The quality attribute of direct concern to an engineer is comprehensibility. Pragmatic-Tier 3. The quality attribute of direct concern to an end-user is usability. We will view accessibility as a special case of usability (Mendes & Mosley, 2006). The quality attribute of direct concern to an engineer is maintainability. We will consider modifiability, portability, and reusability as special cases of maintainability (Buschmann, Meunier, Rohnert, Sommerlad, & Stal, 1996).\n\n◦\n\nFinally, we note that the significance of quality attributes will vary across business models (Bambury, 1998) as well as different types of ecommerce applications. For example, the quality needs of a music shopping portal will vary from that of a fine art auction application.\n\n◦\n\n•\n\n•\n\nS tep F ive: Acquiring and S electing S uitable Patterns The challenges in the patterns’ acquisition and selection process stem from a variety of factors: •\n\n•\n\nAvailability of Patterns. For an adoption of a pattern-based approach to the development of e-commerce applications, it is important to have design and implementation patterns that can sufficiently “map” the solution space. However, there is no a priori guarantee that for every quality-related problem, there will be suitable pattern(s) available for it. Findability of Patterns. There are currently several challenges that inhibit our ability of detect and find desirable patterns (Manolescu, Kozaczynski, Miller, & Hogg, 2007). We consider three of these challenges:\n\n◦\n\nClassi. cation of Patterns. There is no currently unique classification of patterns. There are some patterns that may be classified into familiar categories (like “structural” or “behavioral”) while others may be presented as a loosely related informal collection. Apart from some isolated efforts (Van Welie & Van Der Veer, 2000; Schumacher et al., 2006), patterns are currently not organized by quality attributes and in only very few cases organized as directly relevant to e-commerce. This could adversely impact the task of locating desirable patterns (Segerståhl & Jokela, 2006). Relationships among Patterns. Often, patterns do not exist in isolation and are part of an overall vocabulary (e.g., a “pattern system” or a “pattern language”) that attempts to solve a larger problem than possible with an individual pattern. The relationships among patterns can be implicit or explicit. Indeed, due to the context-driven relationships among them, the use of one pattern can lead to the commitment of using other pattern(s). For example, selection and application of a pattern for a shopping system would place us in a context that would require the selection of a pattern for payment, which in turn would require the selection of a pattern specific to authentication. Similarity among Patterns. The name of a pattern plays a crucial role in acquiring and selecting desirable candidates. There are some patterns that have similar or same names but have semantically different functionality. There are also other patterns in different pattern collections that have similar intent or functionality but have\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\n•\n\ndifferent names. For example, the NEWS pattern (Rossi et al., 2000) is similar to the WHAT’S NEW PAGE pattern (Van Duyne et al., 2003). These patterns may have been (re)discovered independently. Cost of Deploying Patterns. There is evident cost associated with the deployment of patterns that cannot be disregarded. It is known that patterns are means of conceptual reuse, and there is a cost in terms of time, effort, and resources of learning and adaptation involved in any reuse. The issue of cost is particularly acute in educational contexts where affordability of commercial resources (such as books on patterns) is a constant concern.\n\nS tep S ix: Applying Patterns There are three main nonmutually exclusive concerns in the application of patterns: the understanding of the pattern description, the order in which patterns are applied, and the result upon the composition of patterns. 1.\n\n2.\n\nUnderstanding the Pattern. The understanding of the underlying problem, the context in which it occurs, and the trade-offs and consequences of the proposed solution are imperative. For example, patterns that suggest solutions involving the use of different colors will not be applicable in contexts where the underlying monitor does not support it (such as when the screen is monochrome) or if the user is color blind. Order of Application of Patterns. In the design phase, the patterns for a high-level (macro-architecture) design are applied first, followed by the patterns for a low-level (micro-architecture) design. In each of these\n\n3.\n\nlevels, the order of the application of patterns does matter and, if ignored, it may not be at all possible to apply other patterns and/or lead to a nonoptimal result. Composition of Patterns. The relationships among patterns can be favorable, unfavorable, or neutral. Even when a certain order in the application of patterns is followed, it is the result upon the composition of patterns that should appear suitable. Although the application of individual patterns may appear acceptable, the result with a multiplicity of patterns may not.\n\nFor the remainder of this section, we will assume that, among the given possibilities (Adams et al., 2001), the e-commerce application under development is of the type business-to-consumer (B2C) and being accessed via stationary devices (e.g., desktop computers) or pseudo-stationary devices (e.g., notebook computers). Furthermore, even though patterns are applicable to all the phases of a development process, including requirements, design, and implementation for considerations of space, we will limit ourselves in this chapter to addressing the role of patterns in the design phase of e-commerce applications. As evident from the discussion that follows, the patterns presented here form a skeleton sequence that traverses through several existing collections of patterns. Our selection of patterns is based on their generality, neutrality with respect to any specific application domain, broad availability, parity to the quality attribute at hand, suitability of the context and the forces (where available), and the reputation of the authors. In order to distinguish the patterns from the main text, their names are listed in uppercase. The Appendix summarizes the quality attributes and patterns mentioned in this section.\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nMacro-Architecture Design of E-Commerce Applications The macro-architecture design is the place where high-level design decisions, independent of any implementation paradigm or technology, are made. Patterns Applied from a Business Viewpoint An e-commerce application will implicitly or explicitly target some domain. The choice of the domain name (such as .net or .com) does not always or automatically reveal the nature of the domain. There are patterns available for certain common genres, like ENABLING INTRANETS (for businesses in general), PERSONAL E-COMMERCE (for small businesses), VALUABLE COMPANY SITES (for large organizations), and STIMULATING ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT (for news organizations) (Van Duyne et al., 2003). The use of such genre-specific patterns can increase user familiarity with the e-commerce application.\n\nFurthermore, the organization owning an e-commerce application may wish to serve (potential) consumers in diverse cultural and/or geopolitical situations (i.e., in different countries and using different natural languages). This could be done using the LOCALE HANDLING pattern (Busse, 2002). In retrospect, it increases maintenance responsibilities. Patterns Applied from a Technical Viewpoint The macro-architecture patterns that we suggest are based on the fact that e-commerce applications are a class of distributed request-response-type interactive systems. Specifically, the applicable patterns are the CLIENT-SERVER pattern (Schmidt, Stal, Rohnert, & Buschmann, 2000), followed by the APPLICATION SERVER pattern (Manolescu & Kunzle, 2001), which in turn is followed by the MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER (MVC) pattern (Buschmann et al., 1996). The CLIENT-SERVER pattern supports maintainability. For example, a server or resources on\n\nFigure 2. A view of the macro-architecture design patterns in the development of e-commerce applications\n\n10\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nthe server-side could be modified without impacting the client. Also, a single server can support multiple clients simultaneously, or a client could make simultaneous requests for resources residing on multiple servers. The APPLICATION SERVER pattern also supports maintainability: it isolates the e-commerce application from other aspects on the server-side such that the communication between the application itself and the Web server takes place via the SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS (Yoder & Barcalow, 1997) pattern. This separation allows the e-commerce application to evolve independently. In applying the MVC pattern, the principle of separation of structure from presentation of content in a markup document leads to a separation of semantically-different aspects into three components, namely model, view, and controller. This minimizes the coupling between these components. Therefore, the same model in a MVC could be used with multiple views and multiple controllers. For example, the same information could be transformed and delivered to different browser environments or user needs. This improves the maintainability of an e-commerce application. Figure 2 presents an abstract view of the aforementioned macro-architecture design patterns. There are several implementations of MVC available in a variety of programming languages such as Java and hypertext preprocessor (PHP), and application frameworks like asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and Rails. The CUSTOMIZED PRESENTATION TO HOST pattern (Adams et al., 2001) mimics some aspects of MVC. It aims to improve usability by providing a user-friendly interface. However, there is a tight coupling between the customized presentation view and the host application. Hence, any changes to the host application may require changes to the presentation view. This is unfavorable to maintainability.\n\nReliability Design For addressing reliability (specifically, availability) concerns, the macro-architecture design of server-side components of an e-commerce application could use a number of patterns (Ahluwalia & Jain, 2006; Manolescu & Kunzle, 2001). For example, the extra measures to support the availability of an e-commerce application (unrelated to the functionality of the application) could be included by using the INTRODUCE REDUNDANCY pattern. One way to introduce redundancy is to have a cluster of multiple servers such as suggested by the FAIL-OVER THROUGH CLUSTERING pattern, where if one (primary) server fails, the other (secondary) server takes over the responsibility. In retrospect, redundancy also increases maintenance responsibilities. If and when the need arises, a failure message could be relayed directly using the FAILURE NOTIFICATION pattern or indirectly using the HEARTBEAT pattern, where an engineer is informed via periodic broadcasts that a specific Web server is available; the absence of such a message would then imply its unavailability.\n\nMicro-Architecture Design of E-Commerce Applications The micro-architecture design is the place where low-level design decisions are cast. For the rest of the section, we will focus only on the design aspects that impact pragmatic quality. As such, in the following, our attention is geared more towards client-side rather than server-side concerns. Interaction design (Preece, Rogers, & Sharp, 2002) is perhaps the most crucial client-side concern among e-commerce applications. The goal of interaction design is to make both the content and the user interface useful, easy-to-use, and enjoy-\n\n11\n\nUsing Patterns for Engineering High-Quality E-Commerce Applications\n\nable. Many of the patterns available for interaction design for interactive systems in general are also applicable to e-commerce"
