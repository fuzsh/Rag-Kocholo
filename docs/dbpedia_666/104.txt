Adolph Von Menzel ( December 8, 1815 – February 9,) was the most successful artist of his era in Germany; and along with Caspar David Friedrich, one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century. He was best known for demonstrating scenes from the life of Frederick the Great. He wanted to capture the monarch as a man who was both hated and admired, simply as he was. Menzel is now also famous for capturing, with amazing detail and precision, the scenes and objects of everyday life.

During Menzel’s life, his paintings were appreciated by Otto von Bismarck and William I, and after his death they were appropriated for use as electoral posters by Adolf Hitler.
