        "text": "Adolph Menzel (German, 1815-1905) exhibited tremendous powers of observation and an interest in a wide range of subjects. This art book collects the best of his drawings, watercolors, pastels, and gouaches, many of which have never been published before.\n\nMenzel’s plein air studies——portraits, animals, architecture, and landscapes——were revered by contemporary realists for their truth to nature and technical accomplishment. Menzel was also a master of historical illustration, and this collection includes some of his best examples of imaginative realism.\n\nThe drawings and paintings in this volume were selected by Dinotopia author James Gurney, who also provides an informative introduction. This is the finest collection in print of the drawings and watercolors of an unjustly overlooked artist.\n\n130 images, includes 32 pages of color, 8.5 x 11 inches. Signed by the author/editor James Gurney.\n\nFollow me on Mastodon"
