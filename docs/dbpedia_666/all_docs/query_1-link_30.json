        "text": "His graduation from the Academy was followed by a series of lithographic commissions, including works by Goethe and a history of the Frederick the Great.\n\nAdolf von Menzel (Polish/German, 1815-1905) Meissonier in his studio at Poissy (1869) Oil on panel. 8 1/4 BY 11 3/8IN. Private collection.\n\nIn 1855, Menzel traveled to Paris for the first time. The occasion was most likely the influential Paris Exposition Universelle, with thousands of artists’ works on display in series of pavilions organized by nationality. There Menzel saw Gustave Courbet’s “Pavillon du Réalism,” which led to a more naturalistic approach to his paintings. From that time forward, he would make regular trips to Paris and came to know some of the city’s most important artists.\n\nAdolf von Menzel (Polish/German, 1815-1905) Aufbewahrungssaal während des Museumsumbaus (1848) Pastel on paper. 46 BY 57CM. Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin.\n\nBy the end of his life, Menzel was considered one of Berlin’s greatest artists. He joined the Royal Academy of Art in 1853, and was a teacher at the school from 1875 until his death in 1905. He had been decorated as a Knight of the Black Order, given the rank of Privy Councilor with the title “Your Excellency,” and awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Berlin."
