Millions of devoted readers and listeners have soared on the glittering wings of Anne's imagination, following book by book the evolution of one of science fiction's most beloved and honored series. Now, for the first time, Anne has invited another writer to join her in the skies of Pern, a writer with an intimate knowledge of Pern and its history: her son, Todd. Young Kindan has no expectations other than joining his father in the mines of Camp Natalon, a coal mining settlement struggling to turn a profit far from the great Holds where the presence of dragons and their riders means safety and civilization. Mining is fraught with danger. Fortunately, the camp has a watch-wher, a creature distantly related to dragons and uniquely suited to specialized work in the dark, cold mineshafts. Kindan's father is the watch-wher's handler, and his son sometimes helps him out. But even that important job promises no opportunity outside the mine. Then disaster strikes. In one terrible instant, Kindan loses his family and the camp loses its watch-wher. Fathers are replaced by sons in the mine--except for Kindan, who is taken in by the camp's new Harper. Grieving, Kindan finds a measure of solace in a burgeoning musical talent...and in a new friendship with Nuella, a mysterious girl no one seems to know exists. It is Nuella who assists Kindan when he is selected to hatch and train a new watch-wher, a job that forces him to give up his dream of becoming a Harper; and it is Nuella who helps him give new meaning to his life. Meanwhile, sparked by the tragedy, long-simmering tensions are dividing the camp. Far below the surface, a group of resentful miners hides a deadly secret. As warring factions threaten to explode, Nuella and Kindan begin to discover unknown talents in the misunderstood watch-wher-talents that could very well save an entire Hold. During their time teaching the watch-wher, the two learn some things themselves: that even a seemingly impossible dream is never completely out of reach...and that light can be found even in the deepest darkness.… (more)\n\n▾Tags\n\n▾LibraryThing Recommendations\n\n▾Lists\n\n▾Will you like it?\n\nLoading...\n\nSign up for LibraryThing to find out whether you'll like this book.\n\n▾Conversations (About links)\n\nNo current Talk conversations about this book.\n\n» See also 19 mentions\n\n▾Other authors\n\n» Add other authors (5 possible)\n\nAuthor nameRoleType of authorWork?StatusAnne McCaffrey—primary authorall editionscalculatedMcCaffrey, Todd J.—main authorall editionsconfirmedEdwards, LesCover artistsecondary authorsome editionsconfirmedYoull,PaulCover artistsecondary authorsome editionsconfirmed\n\n▾Series and work relationships\n\n▾Awards and Honors\n\n▾Common Knowledge\n\nYou must log in to edit Common Knowledge data.\n\nFor more help see the Common Knowledge help page.\n\nCanonical title Original title Alternative titles Original publication date People/Characters Important places Important events Related movies Epigraph Quotations Publisher's editors Blurbers Original language Canonical DDC/MDS Canonical LCC\n\n▾References\n\nReferences to this work on external resources.\n\nWikipedia in English (3)\n\nAnne McCaffrey bibliography\n\nDragon's Kin\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject National Register of Historic Places/coordsF\n\n▾Book descriptions\n\nBeginning with the classic Dragonriders of Pern, Anne McCaffrey has created a complex, endlessly fascinating world uniting humans and great telepathic dragons.
