The realization of the first edition of Beyond and Before in 2011 was a long time coming, but it benefitted from a number of important studies published in the late 1990s and from the dramatic resurgence of progressive rock albums and performances, in their many guises and forms, since the millennium. For this ten-year edition we have also benefitted from an additional decade of listening to and thinking about progressive rock across an expanded sound palette, which gives added musical texture and cultural range to this updated 2021 publication of Beyond and Before, especially to our third section ‘Beyond’, to which we have added a new chapter. We would particularly like to thank Leah Babb-Rosenfeld at Bloomsbury for being such a supportive and accommodating editor, our universities in Nottingham and Leicester, and all the artists and bands whose artwork and stills feature in this book for being so generous with permissions. We would both like to thank Ben Andrews, Colin Harrison and Michael Hoar for helping sow the seeds for Beyond and Before in the 1990s, and we want to thank, separately, a number of friends and colleagues who have helped, either tangibly or tangentially, to bring both the first and second editions to fruition.

The dream of The Sex Pistols to break free from rock cliché was over, ended in a farce of hype, self-indulgence and musical stasis. Punk was born in 1976 from a fury of destruction and renewal, and its principal target was progressive rock, whose alleged self-indulgence and pretension would be brought to a close by the fresh and angry authenticity of a newly stripped-down version of rock, invigorated through simplicity. The dominant discourse in music history is that progressive rock was victim to punk’s return to basics, albeit a basis that imagined it needed to destroy all that had gone before in order to proclaim a new beginning. In practical terms, nothing of the sort happened. Commercially successful rock bands remained so, and some, such as Genesis and Rush, increased in popularity during the late 1970s. Critically speaking, though, progressive rock remained doomed, as a generation of supporters of punk, particularly in Britain and centred on the weekly music paper the New Musical Express, moved into academia (with the growth of the new discipline of cultural studies) and into the mainstream press. A well-established American rock journalism alive to ‘authenticity’ in rock contributed to a narrowly conceived vision of an Anglocentric genre that was in the process of inflating and bursting. To this day, a suspicion lingers over anything that recalls the experimentation practised by mid-1970s progressive rock bands. For example, in 1998, The Observer ran an article, ‘Oh No, It’s Yes: Where Even Irony Fears to Tread’, which noted the rise of nostalgia for the 1970s but claimed that progressive rock remains ‘utterly unforgiven’ in media circles.1 The article’s author, David Thomas, goes on to say that in 1973–4 many of us huddled against the cold of the power cuts and the three-day week in Afghan sheepskins, earnestly debating the secret meaning of the latest\n\n2\n\nBeyond and Before progressive rock concept album and pondering great questions of life like, who was the best bass player, Greg Lake or John Paul Jones?2\n\nAlthough Thomas here recoils from a formative phase of his own musical education, the limitations of this perspective have been, to our mind, fatally exposed, primarily because since the late 1990s progressive rock has renewed itself as a major cultural force without recourse to the musical vocabulary assumed to be the staple of all progressive styles.3 The obvious approach to a new study of progressive rock is to pretend that its hostile reception around the time of punk simply never occurred. Yet this might lead to a wistful or nostalgic view of 1970s progressive rock, cut dead in its prime by the assault of punk or undone from within by the excesses of the rock industry. This book wishes to avoid such nostalgia by pursuing two other aims. We focus on the long and varied musical history of progressive rock, first, to counter social histories of 1970s Britain that marginalize it as a major musical form, and, second, to problematize the received orthodoxy that punk did away with prog.4 Such strategies enable us to examine how progressive rock works across its cultural, historical and musical range, rather than attempting to justify or deny a single generation’s polarizing veneration of or hostility towards prog. Since the first edition of Beyond and Before appeared in 2011, the significance of 1976 and the apparent end of prog has faded from musicians’ and fans’ consciousness. As we argue in the ‘Beyond’ section of this book, over the last twenty years musicians across all genres of popular music have, wittingly and unwittingly, continued to delve into the methods and modes of progressive rock in its effort to reconfigure music as a rich open-ended and fusional genre. This is not to resurrect 1970s prog at the expense of punk. The punk attack on progressive and stadium rock undeniably occurred and the inspiration created by punk – to open music up to all, rather than its being the province of musical virtuosos – was significant, creative and powerful. It is also true that the rock criticism emerging as a serious force in the late 1970s had much to say, notably on what Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the mid-1940s called ‘the culture industry’ which, to their eyes, replaced cultural creativity with standardized products that have only surface attraction or ‘style’.5 For all the virtues of Bill Martin’s book Listening to the Future: The Time of Progressive Rock (1998), he is wrong to caricature punk as an example of cynical music for a cynical society that totally rejected the utopianism of the mid1960s and its bearing on the youth cultures of the 1970s.6 Above all, though,\n\nProgressive Rock across Time and Genre\n\n3\n\nwe cannot write off the historical reception of progressive rock. Martin joins Edward Macan, author of the other major late 1990s book on progressive rock, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (1997), in acknowledging the power of that critical paradigm. But they each do so largely unconsciously, effectively accepting the characterization of progressive rock offered by its critics. In Beyond and Before, by way of contrast, we realize the need to accept the reality of the punk criticism of prog rock, but without believing all of it to be true. More books have appeared in recent years, and, whilst being more open to the cross-genre potential of prog, still return to what are for us, caricatures, even if well intended. In A New Day Yesterday (2020), Mike Barnes focuses on a particular time, location and set of styles. He acknowledges the input of other genres to progressive rock, but all the music he cites remains resolutely the most obvious bands and approaches. In Experiencing Progressive Rock (2018), Robert G. H. Burns also insists on the value of progressive rock as a genre that can encompass all. Yet his apt inclusion of math rock and other examples such as metal, whilst echoing our own approach, plays on the value of virtuosity and musicological worth of the music of 1970s and 2000s alike.7 David Weigel’s The Show That Never Ends: The Rise and Fall of Prog Rock (2017) promises to explore the time beyond progressive rock’s heyday, but again discusses mostly virtuosic progressive metal as the inheritance of prog, following his review of the 1970s period.8 Both Burns and Weigel acknowledge Steven Wilson but little else. Jerry Ewing’s Wonderous Stories (2017) includes many more musicians from later decades and strongly acknowledges the legacy of 1980s prog, but the book is heavily weighted to the ‘classic’ period.9 All four of these recent books take for granted the easy definition of progressive rock as complex, innovative music that had a certain time in which it took place. Thus, they almost repave the way for the critiques made of the genre in the late 1970s. The problem is not that punk-inspired criticism is entirely wrong or misguided. The fault lies in the limited view of what progressive rock actually was – and still is. To this day, mention the words ‘progressive rock’ and many will conjure images of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage-sets and costumes, and a dedication to technical skill bordering on the obsessive (all reiterated as positives, or as loveable quirks, by recent writers). A few moments in its history have come to represent the whole, such as the much repeated image of the massive tour buses that Emerson, Lake and Palmer used to carry around the band’s vast array of musical and stage equipment in the mid-1970s, or Led\n\n4\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nZeppelin’s luxuriously fitted Starship One aeroplane used for the band’s 1975 US tour. But these images tend to be a spurious metonymy of convenience. If we move up a notch in ‘what was wrong with prog’, we still encounter a range of disparaging – often recycled – references limited to Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, and Emerson, Lake and Palmer (ELP). Although these bands have certainly been responsible for melodramatic moments in their histories, even the most virulent opponent could not deny that they were highly popular in the 1970s and, for the most part, experimental in their compositions, albums and performances. Beyond these nemeses of authentic rock lie the more interesting cases of King Crimson, Soft Machine and Van der Graaf Generator, bands that never received the same amount of vitriol as the aforementioned foursome, with Lydon himself keen on Van der Graaf Generator and its portentous singer Peter Hammill in particular (much to the disgust of The Sex Pistols’ manager, Malcolm McLaren). What is curious is that Martin, Macan, Barnes and Burns all use the same categorization to defend and explicate progressive rock. We will argue throughout this book, in different ways according to the type of progressive rock discussed, that prog is an incredibly varied genre based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, and that it taps into broader cultural resonances that link to avant-garde art, classical, jazz and folk musics, performance and the moving image. One of the best ways to define progressive rock is that it is a heterogeneous and troublesome genre, a formulation that becomes clear the moment we leave behind characterizations based only on the most visible bands of the early to mid-1970s. In doing so, we need to explore the roots and sources of progressive rock, such as jazz, and how they continued to inflect prog throughout; earlier examples of the concept album and song-cycle; the variety of prog during the 1970s; and its legacies and parallels in rock music since the late 1970s, including neo-progressive and post-progressive revivals in the 1980s and late 1990s, through to the immense sprawl of metal into progressive methods, styles and forms. Over the last twenty years or so, groups that update progressive rock have been massively successful – think of Radiohead, Steven Wilson, Tool, Muse, The Mars Volta and Porcupine Tree, among other innovative bands that have helped to resuscitate its long-lost credibility. New genres have arisen that echo prog’s inventiveness, and other musicians, such as Kate Bush, have returned, arguably more ‘progressively’ than ever. In addition to sales, concert attendance and internet activity, the resurgence of interest among fans and practitioners of progressive rock can be seen in the ongoing success of Classic Rock Presents Prog\n\nProgressive Rock across Time and Genre\n\n5\n\nmagazine, launched in spring 2009. The German magazine Eclipsed has also grown, and now has an online version in English. Other signs of this resurgence can be seen in the mainstream press. An article on contemporary music styles covered by the Sunday Times in January 2009 makes the claim that watching and listening to bands such as Radiohead, Muse and The Secret Machines is ‘to witness all the mad splendour of prog rock, alive and well three decades after its heyday (and apparent death at the hands of punk)’.10 Bemoaning the stereotyping of prog bands and style, the article continues: Back in the days before prog and art rock were seen as two separate entities, the best practitioners not only justified their mission – to make music of a greater complexity and inventiveness than the standard rock song format allowed for – with some superb albums, they also pointed the way towards the music of similarly unfettered and adventurous contemporary bands.11\n\nLeaving aside the uncritical celebration of ‘unfettered and adventurous’ music, it is clear that progressive rock has equally complex legacies and genealogies, as explored in a Guardian feature in July 2010 that coincided with the inclusion of a dedicated progressive rock stage at that year’s High Voltage festival in Victoria Park, London.12 Media interest, beyond the music press (now focusing on portmanteau guides such as Uncut’s Prog Rock Archive Guide of November 2019), has slackened over the decade to 2021, bar Kelefa Sanneh’s 2017 article ‘The Persistence of Prog Rock’ in The New Yorker.13 Weigel’s book received some predictably sneering coverage that at points acknowledged that prog may have started out well, but it became terrible as it ignored the African American elements of rock. The opening chapters of Beyond and Before aim to dispel that convenient myth. Partly this diminishing interest is about prog now being one old genre among many, and so individual groups and artists are certainly covered and not just ageing or dying 1970s superstars. Steven Wilson receives some interesting coverage, to take one example. The Guardian gives him backhanded praise in the 2017 interview ‘Steven Wilson: The Prog Rocker Topping the Charts without Anyone Noticing’ and Le Figaro offers matter of factness in showing Wilson as a figure of prog renewal upon the release of To the Bone.14 The genre discussion may have lost relevance as the generation of anti-prog writers becomes less representative of listeners, and as all eras of music have become equally available. More seriously of course, it reflects the fragmentation of media and the displacement of online ‘magazines’ in favour of social media, as opposed to telling us anything interesting about the reception of prog today.\n\n6\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nAs well as expanding the what of progressive rock, we will extend the when. As the title of this book suggests, we are interested in the ‘before’ and ‘beyond’ of prog, as well as its high phase, from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. This explains the three sections of the book: the first part deals with the ‘before and during’ of progressive rock, tracing its conceptual and historical roots; the second focuses on prog transitions in response to punk and into its neo-progressive guise of the 1980s; and the third and longest part looks at the ‘beyond’, to a renegotiation of the legacy of prog and the renewal of musical possibilities over the last thirty years. Our full title, Beyond and Before: Progressive Rock across Time and Genre, indicates that time features in many intersecting ways: the temporal reach of progressive rock; its interest in experimental time-signatures; and time as a recurring theme in lyrics, song-cycles and concepts (such as Rush’s 2010–11 Time Machine tour), linking to parallel times, past times, future imaginings, which we take up in Chapter 15 with our discussion of contemporary albums that stretch time. In addition, we will expand on the where of prog. Bill Martin notes that prog was the first ‘world music’, because of its synthesizing of nonEuropean elements with the already semi-global European classical music and English rock.15 We want to make the case that it is literally a global music, spreading rapidly beyond England, crisscrossing the Atlantic and emerging in various European countries including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, and building on (but also complicating) the countercultural moves for individual and social freedoms that became visible in so many places in the mid to late 1960s. This book will argue strongly for a highly diverse and open-ended idea of what progressive rock is, not merely out of a belief in the value of political or cultural difference but because openness and extreme diversity (even within a single track) are key characteristics of progressive rock, its sources and its later forms. Nevertheless, a model is needed to avoid arguing that every interesting rock album that produces something new is somehow progressive. Whilst it might be true to say that any such album is a candidate for being thought of as progressive, it is equally important to avoid a reductive definition in terms of period or style. Bill Martin in Music of Yes (1996) and Listening to the Future proposes a set of guidelines for what progressive rock is and how it works.16 For us, this model is too prescriptive if taken as a definitive paradigm. But used in combination with many ideas Martin offers as being of secondary importance, it remains a productive way of beginning to think analytically and expansively about progressive rock.\n\nProgressive Rock across Time and Genre\n\n7\n\nMartin outlines three dominant characteristics of progressive rock, which he then moulds into a four-point model. First, he writes of it being a true synthesis of different musical forms. Whereas The Beatles, along with many other 1960s bands, included elements of classical music or music from outside European traditions, in full-blown progressive rock, the synthesis is much more complete in the following way: when we hear the presence and juxtaposition of harpsichord and sitar [in progressive rock tracks], this sounds much more like something that has been part of the music all along.17\n\nThis interpretation means that diverse forms are fully integrated rather than acting as texture or ornamentation. The second key element of a progressive rock genre is musical virtuosity. This is controversially used, as Martin acknowledges, to exclude Pink Floyd among others: a group that many regard as not only progressive in style but also very keen on musical skill.18 His point is a subtle one. If we include all bands on this basis, we would have to include many rock records far outside what is usually thought of as progressive rock – a direction this book embraces by tracing the complex roots and multiple directions of the concept album. Third, for Martin, progressive rock is inherently, if not permanently, English in origin: that is, it derives from a particular collision of influences in English culture, such as religious dissenting, class as a determining social factor, a nationalistic sense of heritage and a critique of social convention. In Martin’s model, all progressive bands follow on from these national origins, as progressive rock ‘sets sail from England’.19 We will return to this idea after a quotation that incorporates the three strands of Martin’s model: As a style of music progressive rock has five specific traits: 1) it is visionary and experimental; 2) it is played, at least in significant part, on instruments typically associated with rock music, by musicians who have a background in rock music, and with the history of rock music itself as background; 3) it is played, in significant part, by musicians who have consummate instrumental and compositional skills; 4) it is a phenomenon, in its ‘core’, of English culture; 5) relatedly, in significant part, it is expressive of romantic and prophetic aspects of that culture.20\n\nThese are not quite the same points identified in Martin’s earlier list of key elements, but they need to be considered in tandem with them. The first part of the definition is essential. For Martin, progressive rock is a type of utopianism interested in social change, even when it seems furthest from concrete political\n\n8\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nconcerns (and especially so in the music of Yes). Furthermore, it is the pinnacle of rock ’n’ roll’s nascent avant-gardism. Martin’s model is as much about exclusion as inclusion: music after the ‘time of progressive rock’, in 1978, could not attain the critical function of its high phase because society had lost its utopianism and had descended into social cynicism linked to a more brutal form of capitalism.21 Following Edward Macan, another way of describing this moment is the splintering of the late 1960s counterculture into a series of fragmented subcultures, of which punk would be one example. For Martin, punk is merely the most blatant example of cultural cynicism (with the exception of The Sex Pistols’ 1977 album Never Mind the Bollocks, which conveys authentic musicalized anger). Ironically, this attempt to recover a politically progressive music resulted in his adopting a highly conservative position, paralleling the simplistically critical views of postmodernism that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. Martin follows a line that characterizes the moment in which he is writing: bemoaning (or half-heartedly praising) the end of the avant-garde in a manner that was common at the time of Fredric Jameson’s influential cultural and social critique Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1991). Because of an over-emphasis on Jameson’s notion of the ‘waning of affect’ through commodity production and a resultant flatness of style, Postmodernism is often misread as a blanket condemnation of contemporary aesthetics. However, Jameson actually explains the postmodern turn as the endpoint of exhaustion of modernism, cutting across diverse cultural forms.22 In this way, diversity, rather than agonistic cultural trends, marks a break from the modernist tradition in the 1960s and 1970s. We would argue that the end of the avant-garde through the rejection of modernism is meaningful, but it perhaps signals only the end of a particular Hegelian or Marxist notion of progression. If this particular conception is only part of a multidimensional progression, as opposed to progress as an inevitable upward or rising movement, then it cannot go away but only change configuration. We would argue that this occurred in what comes after progressive rock in more and increasingly diverse forms. Andreas Huyssen points towards the various competing ‘phases and directions’ of modernist culture running through the 1960s and 1970s, not all of which were moving in the same direction. The problem for Huyssen is that one version of modernism became ‘domesticated in the 1950s’.23 But Huyssen also suggests an alternative narrative of modernist culture, not as monolithic but as mobile and porous. Hence, we do not need to\n\nProgressive Rock across Time and Genre\n\n9\n\nsee a genre such as prog as surpassing or surpassed but can instead focus on its tendrilous state in, among and around many popular musics. These views help us to understand the diversity of progressive rock, but we also need to step backwards to consider popular music before prog and its relation to the avant-garde. Chapter 2 examines the roots of progressive rock in the mid1960s, but we need to explore whether or how rock relates to different models of the avant-garde in order to complete and broaden our reading of Martin’s typology. Can we say with him, for example, that rock ’n’ roll had any musical claims to being an avant-garde? If it did, was this more through its social impact or its inspiration for future musical experimentation? To address these questions we might turn to Michael Nyman’s distinction between, on the one hand, avant-garde music as that which is programme-based and functions within the orchestra or composer or musical-score genre and, on the other, experimental music where the status of music itself is questioned (by John Cage or La Monte Young or the international Fluxus project) or where its seriousness as high art is replaced by the repetitions and non-European influences of minimalism.24 That Nyman did not extend this overtly to popular music does not prevent its application to the properly experimental and questing nature of progressive rock For us, progressive rock is both formally and socially avant-gardist, even if the latter becomes harder to see in the mid-1970s and might not be the case for all of its early twenty-first-century versions. In terms of Nyman’s instrumentalist distinction between ‘avant-garde’ and ‘experimental’, we note that prog does both: it crosses this divide even if its critics might imagine that the grandiose musical ambitions of The Nice or Emerson, Lake and Palmer were to be surpassed by more directly authentic music. Martin’s argument about rock ’n’ roll being avant-garde from the start targets critics of progressive rock who claim that it is a perversion of rock, and that its authenticity can be restored only through the new simplicity of punk. In this respect, Martin is right to argue against a primal authenticity that validates certain forms of music and denigrates others. But, in doing so, Martin overstates the formal radicalism of rock ’n’ roll by claiming that it was always hybrid and always innovative, particularly when formally it simplified blues structures and historically it developed in the 1950s alongside more radical musical forms: the emergence of free jazz, mathematical programme music and the avant-gardism of the Black Mountain College in North Carolina.25 Although rock ’n’ roll might have brought innovations to popular music, it would seem that if it ever thought of avant-garde music, it was to react\n\n10\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nagainst it, in a bid to speak to the ‘real world’ of young Americans. But what if the audience was avant-garde? Beyond the negative reception by panicky authorities in the United States in the mid-1950s (repeated slightly later in Britain), open-minded listeners keen on social, cultural and artistic change were successors to the original black audiences for so-called race music in the 1940s or jazz in the pre–Second World War period, for whom rock ’n’ roll was no bolt from the blue but an organic outcrop of existing musical forms.26 But this would not necessarily have been a conscious avant-gardism, at least not until the mid-1960s. As Charlie Gillett notes, ‘few people in the rock ’n’ roll audience deliberately or consciously considered music’ intellectually.27 Much of what white listeners in the 1950s heard as rock ’n’ roll would have seemed exotic, but for black listeners its rhythm and blues elements were unremarkable and simply a phase in an organic musical development.28 Furthermore, rock ’n’ roll audiences, according to sociologist David Riesman, writing in 1957, were often elective communities formed around an awareness of new sounds, clubs, fashions and slang: There were still other ways in which the minority may use popular music to polarize itself from the majority group, and thereby from American popular culture generally: a sympathetic attitude or even preference for Negro musicians; an equalitarian attitude toward the roles, in love and work, of the two sexes; a more international outlook [and] a feeling that music is too important to serve as a backdrop for dancing, small talk, studying, and the like; a diffuse resentment of the image of the teen-ager provided by the mass media.29\n\nThis audience helped to produce the musicians of 1960s and 1970s rock who became self-aware avant-gardists, bringing jazz, folk, soul, and rhythm and blues experimentations to bear on music in purposely trying to introduce greater formal innovation into a rock format that still conveyed the excitement, rebellion and creative inspiration of rock ’n’ roll. The promise or threat of social change and the formal structure of rock ’n’ roll – simple lyrics, vocal mannerisms, and repetitive beats, chords and song structures – were easily and rapidly assimilated by the music industry, which would triple its sales in the United States between 1954 and 1959. Precisely because the affirmative elements of rock ’n’ roll make it so malleable, we would argue that progressive musicians of the 1960s introduced complexity into rock in order to maintain rebellious individuality and group identity alike in the face of massive capitalist and cultural recuperation of youth culture.30\n\nProgressive Rock across Time and Genre\n\n11\n\nThe second trait that Martin identifies – that prog contains rock elements – is unarguable, although we will be discussing music that has gone a long way from the 1960s and 1970s rock template. If ‘progressive’ is to mean anything, it has to include the sense of referring to previous musical styles, whether those are progressive or not. When looking beyond the 1970s, Martin identifies only bands that refer specifically to the narrowly defined progressive rock style of the 1970s, whereas we would see ‘progressive’ as being meaningful only if it does more than that – although, as Chapter 10 discusses, ‘neo-progressive’ music exists as a direct reference to the history of prog. King Crimson’s Robert Fripp identified this as a problem as far back as 1973, but this was part of Fripp’s attempt to distance himself from the broader prog movement. This is one reason we use the term ‘prog’ interchangeably with ‘progressive rock’. Initially, prog was just a shorthand for the progressive rock style, but in the twenty-first century it has become more of a transferrable adjective, and it suggests a wider palette than that drawn on by the most popular 1970s bands. That is not to say that ‘prog’ is necessarily any more well known than ‘progressive rock’, but it does illustrate a more affectionate acceptance of the continued life of progressive rock across music. The question of virtuosity is a vexed one for those who want progressive rock to be more than the self-indulgence for which prog is criticized. It is undeniable that many progressive rock musicians, especially in the 1970s, were talented, skilful and creative, as also seen in technical variants of metal in the last three decades. The question is whether this hindered or helped musical creativity, particularly as progressive bands were interested in different ways of writing and performing as a group and of developing ideas into integrated concept albums, rather than filling out albums and concerts with tracks featuring virtuoso solos. Martin is correct to argue that Yes have always been an astonishingly skilful musical group, across its fifty years of composing and performing, with its individuals incredibly inventive in ways that foster communal creativity, often in the form of what seems to be five musicians all playing lead at the same time. King Crimson has the same level of skills in all areas of music-making, but in very different ways from Yes. However, there are two problems with the use of virtuosity as a defining feature of progressive rock. First, virtuosity was often praised for its very existence, hence the move to painfully long concert solos in the 1970s as an extension of jazz group practice, with fusion an approach that was ‘explicitly virtuosic’.31 The 1970s music media were full of polls for best bass player and Prog magazine readers voted drummer\n\n12\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nNeil Peart to be the greatest prog musician (in late 2020), with an increasing sense that personal technique could override band creativity (and often led key figures to release solo albums during sabbaticals from their bands). To balance this view, it is worth noting that Yes pursued virtuosity only for its own sake to a moderate degree on certain concert tours, and King Crimson almost never did. The worst offenders would be rock bands that did not receive the critical derision levelled at prog – bands who had stayed with a more blues-based style, and who were also filling stadia (such as The Who and Led Zeppelin, with John Bonham’s twenty-minute live drum solos filling out the latter’s 1969 track ‘Moby Dick’). Second, and more significantly, it is simply not true that progressive rock either required or always had very skilled musicians. More folk-based prog bands would have had little need for it, while still creating records we would recognize as progressive rock (see Chapters 3 and 13). Other bands would work at complex structures made up of simple elements: for example, the music known as kosmische or Krautrock would often be highly repetitive and bands like Hawkwind never cared about being virtuosos. Bill Martin would exclude space rock, just as he excludes Frank Zappa, funk (he refers to ‘progressive soul’ in passing), and the raft of 1970s groups that were not technically brilliant, such as the Irish band Horslips.32 Early neo-prog, the most genre-referential type of prog, was often intentionally musically restricted when it started out in the wake of punk and heavy metal in late 1970s Britain, in that it kept the core of progressive rock’s stylistic and instrumental choices, but composed and played in ways that allowed a sense of immediacy, such as playing with more attack on keyboards, more power on drums and with more aggressive vocals. One dimension of Martin’s point about the Englishness of progressive rock is uncontroversial in terms of the English poetic tradition in which it can be placed, which includes the Romantic poets, William Blake, John Milton, and traditional folk ballads and tales.33 Macan echoes these points but takes a more pragmatic line: ‘the genre originated in England and achieved its “classic” form at the hands of English bands during the early 1970s; even the neo-progressive revival of the early 1980s began in England’.34 Once we factor in folk music, progressive folk (including Irish bands like Mellow Candle), psychedelia and neo-progressive bands such as Scottish group Pallas, then we are talking not about England but about all of Britain and Ireland, so the broader point about progressive rock being essentially English requires\n\nProgressive Rock across Time and Genre\n\n13\n\nfurther comment. Prog rock emerged in Britain due to the strong position of its music industry to the point it could countenance highly experimental music as having commercial potential, linking together rock, jazz and folk scenes in which the musical and cultural exchange across regions and national borders was an implicit feature.35 The insistence on the Englishness of prog works only in relation to the success of English progressive bands, encouraged by English labels, including early independent labels Charisma and Virgin and the offshoots of major companies such as Harvest, Vertigo and Deram. Other than the largely unexplained inclusion of Magma (France) and PFM (Italy), all prog has to be English for Martin. We contend, and will argue later, that as progressive rock emerges from more specific musical trends, moments, locations and social conditions than an amorphous and peculiarly ahistorical Englishness, it cannot be reduced to being inherently English. Its influences in jazz, folk and classical, let alone in, say, Asian music, make this a much more complex picture, although England did produce a larger number of groups in the formative moments of progressive rock. Although progressive rock arises in England, it comprises elements that arrive from elsewhere; it is built in a specific historical musical phase; and it very quickly travelled across Europe (north, south and east) and the Atlantic (via circuitous routes) and, more recently, to other areas of the world such as South America and China, with the Shanghai band Cold Fairyland, for example, influenced equally by Jethro Tull and Chinese folk music. So much for where progressive rock might arise. Before we return to this question in Chapters 1 and 2, we will adapt one further idea from Bill Martin: that of ‘stretching out’. The most well-known characteristic of progressive rock, for fans and detractors alike, is the length of songs, solos, albums and concerts. To a large extent, there is no such thing as progressive rock without extended form, which is the term we will largely use, but ‘stretching out’ gives the sense of how extended form arises. The stretch is not just of time but also of practice, recombining different genres and bringing in sounds, ideas and styles that are normally beyond rock. This means that in this book we include The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Doors, The Pretty Things, Miles Davis, The Zombies, Tony Williams, The Byrds, The Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days. Martin delineates two types of stretching out, based on his two exemplars of progressive rock – Yes and King Crimson:\n\n14\n\nBeyond and Before One form of stretching out is akin to jazz, while the other is more akin to Western classical music. One might think of the way King Crimson, for example, has definite affinities with avant-garde jazz, while Yes has affinities with twentiethcentury classical music.36\n\nOnce we have identified ‘stretching out’ as a characteristic of prog, we can then extend it backwards; it can be identified in the free jazz of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane, the soul of Curtis Mayfield, the sprawl of Karlheinz Stockhausen’s electronic music, and Duke Ellington’s 1943 concept piece Black, Brown and Beige (see Chapter 1) and 1960s jazz concept albums (Chapter 6). Stretching out connects to the need for prog to reference rock and other musical styles, and it helps us identify progressive rock as being involved in a process that is properly avant-garde and experimental. From the late 1960s onwards, progressive rock often functioned as a self-conscious avant-garde, formally and socially by adopting the modernist attitude of referencing its precursors in continued innovation. The question of rock ’n’ roll as an avant-garde practice is relevant only once the question can be posed of post-1965 rock music, because a key part of an avantgarde is to have a movement for which it is the vanguard: rock ’n’ roll can be read as a form of avant-garde free from content and devoid of formal complexity and experimentation. This, in turn, propelled the formless fuzz of psychedelia that gradually uncurled jams, solos and the literal stretching of tunes, and gave rise to the first moments of full-blown prog at the very end of the 1960s.37 Prog did this, according to Macan, as an active response to the total environment and sensual overload of psychedelia, and the tools it used derived from classical music both in the guise of a more narrative version of extension and in terms of structure: Progressive rock was able to solve yet another challenge posed by the psychedelic jam – how to create a sense of direction – by drawing on nineteenth-century symphonic music’s fondness for building up tension until a shattering climax is reached, abruptly tailing off, and then starting the process anew.38\n\nIn fact, classical music would be what distinguished prog from other forms of rock, even though Macan admits the multiple influences on and within progressive rock.39 Not only that, but classical music is used as a means to buttress highly speculative, while notionally empirical, claims about church music in England: namely, that choral Anglican music was important in England over several centuries, and was a key part of the musical backdrop for members of progressive groups in the late 1960s and 1970s, some of whom would have\n\nProgressive Rock across Time and Genre\n\n15\n\nbeen participants in that scene through their childhood upbringing or their adult practices.40 There might be some peripheral value here, but Macan is more persuasive when claiming that English composer and collector of folk music Ralph Vaughan Williams was a catalyst for combining classical music forms and a particularly English Romantic sensibility. Among the various styles of prog, only a handful of groups could be said to be intent on emulating or citing classical music. On Ars Longa Vita Brevis (1968), The Nice followed hard on the heels of Procol Harum’s borrowing of Johann Sebastian Bach in ‘A Whiter Shade of Pale’ (1967). The Nice reworked classical pieces and wrote in a classical style, such as pieces in sonata form divided into movements. Keith Emerson pursued this vein in Emerson, Lake and Palmer during the 1970s, while longer pieces by Yes sought to emulate the sonata form. This classical tradition is to some extent present in many bands, if only through the orchestra-simulating warmth of the Mellotron, which bands started to use after 1965 as a sample-playback keyboard that gave a layered texture and richness to the recorded sound. But the sonata form is one among many other elements even when actual orchestras were used, such as in Deep Purple’s collaboration with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, released as Concerto for Group and Orchestra in 1969. We will develop these formal and historical features of progressive rock in the following chapters. In addition to the above elements, there is a further essential component of progressive rock that introduced highly developed form and content: innovations in musical technology, the creative use of the studio, and new recording techniques. This includes the adoption of new instruments such as synthesizers, the Mellotron proto-sampler, baroque, folk and classical instruments and styles and modes from outside of the genre of rock. Progressive rock also sought to harness influence beyond European traditions. Whilst this had mixed results in some of its guises, it also led to the presence of fusions within prog and also to distinctive features of progressive rock made outside of Europe. The studio emerged as a meta-instrument in the course of the 1960s, and fed directly into progressive rock as a phase space of possibilities. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss with reference to Britain and the United States how the arrival of expanded and extended forms on recorded music is a stretching out that extends back to the 1950s, in the shape of a growing understanding of the possibilities of the album and the recording process itself, and then crystallized in 1967 with the release of key albums in the emergence of progressive rock.\n\n16\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nNotes 1 David Thomas, ‘Oh No, It’s Yes: Where Even Irony Fears to Tread’, The Observer, Review (8 March 1998), 5. 2 Ibid. 3 Thomas notes that the release of Radiohead’s OK Computer in 1997 might signal ‘a triumphant return for all things prog’ (5). This view might have been stimulated by the publication of two books on progressive rock: Edward Macan’s Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997) and Paul Stump’s The Music’s All That Matters: A History of Progressive Rock (London: Quarter Books, 1997). Stump’s book gave rise to a Guardian review in defence of prog rock, even while acknowledging that it was sometimes ‘bloated and overblown’: Adam Sweeting, ‘The Hair’s Apparent’, The Guardian (2 May 1997), 4. 4 Dominic Sandbrook’s State of Emergency: The Way We Were, 1970–1974 (London: Allen Lane, 2010) is sparse on meaningful references to progressive rock, but Andy Beckett’s When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies (London: Faber, 2009) has almost none.

At times a force for integration and social respect, rock ’n’ roll was also an act of theft that in supplanting rhythm and blues deprived blacks of appropriate acknowledgement, rhetorical and financial, of their contributions to American culture’ (Altschuler, All Shook Up, 34). This appropriation cannot be disputed, but Gillett notes the multiple sources of rock ’n’ roll, including country rock and a range of black popular music styles that varied from city to city, so it is perhaps spurious to talk of a singular or homogeneous ‘black’ culture.

This is no different from any form of music on one level; music is a sequence of time defined by organized sounds occurring within it. But progressive rock is acutely aware of this status, unlike rock ’n’ roll, rhythm and blues, surf music and pop of the 1960s, with their more or less uniform sense of how long a piece of music should be and predictably structured sequences of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, break or bridge, chorus. The relation of progressive rock to the time and history of popular music is to be its avant-garde, to look to the future even as it looks to the past to mobilize traditional forms such as folk music. If progressive rock loses this impetus, it becomes a defined ‘style’, arguably the exact opposite of ‘progressive’. Even here, in this book, we would concede that progressive rock had just such a loss of self-awareness for much of the period between the mid- to late 1970s and the mid-1990s. But we will also go on to argue that, even so, the spirit of prog rock moved into other musical forms. Chapter 2 discusses the specific moment of arrival of progressive rock between 1965 and 1970, but this gestation can be seen in the following features: the extension of rock songs into longer pieces; the linking of these pieces into song suites and concept albums; and the increased use of the studio as an integral part of the creative process of music-making, rather than being a mechanical and ancillary part of it. For critics and advocates alike, this combination of elements demonstrated not only the individual maturity of performers such as The Beatles in the mid-1960s but also the maturing of rock as a genre. By the end of the late 1960s, the idea that rock was capable of replicating earlier forms of Western classical music seemed not only feasible but desirable. David Weigel offers an interesting take on this idea by identifying moments where classical composers sought avant-garde and fusional stylistic changes.1 Virtuosity and the value accorded to ‘classically trained’ musicians in the 1970s would seem\n\n22\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nto support this and lent credence to the attempts of mid-1970s journalists to retrieve an authenticity that had been lost in rock music. However, while musical authenticity was contested in the mid-1970s when punk aggressively pitted itself against all established forms of rock music, creativity was at the heart of progressive rock, particularly in the creative use of the studio, extended forms that enhanced the possibilities of ‘the album’, and aesthetic connections with earlier attempts to develop sustained album-length concepts. The album goes back further than we might suspect – to 1909, in fact. But in its recognizable form, the term was not much used until the late 1940s. This is principally because the 78 rpm shellac discs that were the industry standard could hold about only three minutes of sound. So an album would have to be made of several discs, with a twenty-minute sonata needing at least three. Apart from some recordings of classical music, albums were mainly compilations of children’s songs and collections of highlights of either several artists or, less often, one artist. The gradual shift to vinyl records as the norm meant there was a clear distinction between 45 rpm, 7-inch singles, which contained a similar amount of music to 78s, and albums that played at 33 rpm and came in either 10- or 12-inch forms. In between was the ‘extended play’ 7-inch record, usually featuring four pieces. Rock music discovered in the mid1960s that an album could be more than a collection of unconnected songs, or songs arranged according to quality (with the singles or better tracks on the A-side of an album), but jazz musicians were already there in the late 1950s and early 1960s, most notably on albums by Duke Ellington, Ornette Coleman, Frank Sinatra and Max Roach. The use of the studio increasingly became a key part in developing the album through multitracking, inserts, different takes, effects and recording strategies such as positioning of microphones or players. But of equal material significance was the vinyl form itself, which from 1948 (after a false start in the early 1930s) allowed up to forty minutes’ play, with twenty minutes per side. That records were somehow treated naturalistically prior to The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), often taken to be the first concept album (see Chapter 2), is an interesting but fundamentally flawed myth. Similarly, the idea of ‘extended form’ was not restricted to classical music or to live performance. Extended form is not just about length but specifically the extension of form beyond the industry standard. For example, jazz composer Duke Ellington made a series of thematically linked albums from the late 1950s, but he had already dispensed with the conventional meeting of content and form on the 78 rpm record with\n\nExtended Form\n\n23\n\nhis Reminiscing in Tempo (1935). This release extended over two 78 records and is thirteen minutes long; the title and its music perform a self-referential awareness of time and its constraints enacted through sound recording.2 Like Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill and other writers of musicals, Ellington thought that music has the power to convey social meaning through experimentation with both content and form. It could do so by inflecting lyrical and musical themes with popular or hybrid idioms, as he did in his visionary extended releases Black, Brown and Beige (1943) and New World A-Coming (1945). In 1943, Ellington played his musical rendering of the African American historical experience, Black, Brown and Beige, to a not particularly receptive crowd. After a few nights’ performance at the Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, it was shelved for fifteen years, although selections were played as part of concerts. In 1958, Ellington revisited the piece, cutting and refocusing it, notably on variations of the theme song ‘Come Sunday’ that alternates with the theme of ‘The Work Song’ (Sunday being the only time that some imported African slaves received respite from their labour), and it concludes with a recital of Psalm 23. The whole is a piece in six numbered parts, three per side of the vinyl album.3 There is a clear divide between the two sides, with only side two featuring the voice of gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. This movement suggests the coming to being through a Hegelian dialectic awareness of oppression. Hegel’s famous master–slave dialectic is rendered material via the institution of slavery, but the central part of Hegelian thought involves the internal struggle that is a coming to consciousness either of the individual, the group, or humanity as a whole, thereby combining the metaphysical with the material and historical.4 Side two of Black, Brown and Beige illustrates the transition from total oppression to active freedom (still only aspirational in 1958, even after the Brown v. the Board of Education ruling by the US Supreme Court four years earlier made segregation unconstitutional) without minimizing the suffering that black people still had to endure (hence the ‘and though I walk in the shadow of death’ line of Psalm 23). Parts one to three on side one are highly thematic and almost repetitive, whereas side two (parts four to six) offers more direct content, including Mahalia Jackson’s two sung sections. But the abstraction of side one plays a formal strategy beyond its harmoniousness, with Ellington shifting from a situation where African Americans exist only as abstraction towards an awareness of tangible being on side two. In a 1957 essay, ‘The Race for Space’, Ellington argued that the extended jazz form was not just an expression of creative freedom but the key to racial harmony. He asserted that ‘music is bigger’\n\n24\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nthan race, skin colour and language, and that the ensemble jazz band functions by combining sounds and harmonies out of ‘a polyglot of racial elements’. The extended form finds full expression in this 1957 essay and its universalist clarion call for ‘a new sound’ to pave the way for ‘harmony, brotherly love, common respect and consideration for the dignity and freedom of men’.5 In Black, Brown and Beige, Ellington produces a clear example of modernist narration, where form becomes expression and content beyond the notes themselves. In between the original performance of 1943 and its appearance on record in 1958, Ellington continued to work on lengthy pieces that paralleled the European symphonic tradition, and in A Drum Is a Woman (1957) he produced an album that replicated in its form the history of jazz.6 A Drum Is a Woman was conceived as a TV special including dance, performance and narration – a multimedia yet populist work. At one level, it tells the story of jazz, but it is how this is enacted that makes it part of conscious avant-gardism; its aim is not to relate but to be ‘a tone parallel to the history of jazz’.7 In fact, what makes this album worthy of reference here is not its contribution to avant-gardism as such, but how its structure prefigures that of progressive rock concept albums. It features two protagonists, Carribee Joe and Madam Zajj (the reversal of ‘jazz’ foreshadows Peter Gabriel’s ‘Rael’ on Genesis’ 1975 concept album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway), and, as we move from Africa into the twentieth-century American South, the two figures reappear allegorically through the album, either being narrated or narrating themselves. The whole is structured into four parts with recurrent motifs, each then subdivided; the principal narrator’s parts eventually meld the work into a structured piece, the musical narration emerging only gradually over time. It might seem less evident that Ornette Coleman’s Free Jazz (recorded 1960, released 1961) works as a pre-empting of progressive rock, but it is important insofar that it is a purposive attempt to rethink the form of the genre within the form of the piece itself. Ellington replicates the European classical tradition by other means, using clearly defined movements, reprises and thematic connectivity in lyrics and music, but he does so without parroting that tradition. Instead, he moves on from it, and thereby moves jazz on, just as progressive rock bands would do with rock music a few years later. Ellington’s effort to narrate through form in a way that is socially constructive is not only modernist; it was echoed in folk revivals of the early to mid-1960s and the utopianism of late 1960s rock. Both Ellington and Coleman consciously attempted to extend the vocabulary and performance of jazz, in line with music critic William Cameron’s\n\nExtended Form\n\n25\n\nargument in ‘Is Jazz a Folk Art?’ (1958) that jazz ‘thrives on invention and change’, driven not only by urban energies but also by folk melodies ‘constructed from bits and snatches of previous ones’, and by licks and riffs that ‘add sparkle and continuity to . . . personal ideas’.8 This can be seen in Coleman’s music, which extends jazz – and experimental music in general – through improvised synchronous invention. The interplay between improvisation and orchestration had characterized jazz from its early days at the beginning of the twentieth century, but Free Jazz was a programmatic statement, one that had greater import than jazz cornetist Don Cherry’s and saxophonist John Coltrane’s take on Coleman in The Avant-Garde (1960). There were earlier experiments with free improvisation feeding into what was later identified as the ‘free jazz’ of Lennie Tristano or bebop, but Coleman’s Free Jazz was thirty-seven minutes of ensemble improvisation. Although solos are allocated to wind instruments, the other members of the double quartet (one quartet recorded in each channel) are not supposed to tread water, making the solo a group effort and not just an individual run. Within this structure, the solo deviates from being a personal expression (in which one of the stars of the band has their moment) to being about expression itself: the content of free jazz is its production and the expression is at group level. Because it is not possible for one performer to be expressive while others supported, for Ellington the jazz ensemble modelled ‘a new sound’ and a utopian social formation rather than replicating race and class divisions. Crucial in its own right for rethinking developments in jazz, we can also see in this model the embryonic purpose and role for group composition and improvisation in prog. Max Roach was working on a show to commemorate a hundred years of black emancipation in the United States (the Emancipation Declaration having come into force on 1 January 1863) and he turned that work into an albumlength release with We Insist! The Freedom Now Suite, recorded and released in 1960. Like Duke Ellington, and also like the conceptual prog albums of the 1970s, Roach’s album combines a lyrical thematic focus with purposeful formal structures to add up to a whole piece. Side one begins with ‘Driva Man’, with voice and tambourine slowly ceding to mournful band music, and Abbey Lincoln sings of the slave drivers’ brutality towards slaves, and their lives of enforced labour. ‘Freedom Day’ refers directly to emancipation but also to a sense of suspended disbelief and hope: in other words, the situation in 1960 did not suggest that emancipation was complete, and this uncertainty, amid hope, is presented as a premonition of the civil rights struggle just beginning. ‘Triptych: Prayer/\n\n26\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nProtest/Peace’ returns to the combination of Roach’s percussion and Lincoln’s voice, moving through the phases of plaintive song to cathartic and violent expression, before closing in slower, exhausted calmness: there will be peace, but it will come only after protest. Side two shows the growing sense of African inheritance in African American art, combining musical styles and players from the two continents with African cultural lyrical references (these are very broad but their presence is significant as it links to awareness of growing freedom and independence movements in Africa). Like all the albums in this section, We Insist! needs to be recognized as a vital element of the prog inheritance, as it follows all the ‘rules’ we have come to expect of 1970s prog. Jazz in the 1960s divides into a heritage or classic version, which maintained a separation between the lead and supporting musicians, and an increasingly aesthetically and politically avant-garde version, which pushed jazz further from its conventions. John Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders and Chicago’s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians maintained and even expanded the possibility of an individual’s channelling of expressivity, but this was in tandem with advances of the group dynamic. Coltrane himself moved towards a modernist version of spirituality, via Ravi Shankar’s popularizing of Indian classical music, substantial drug intake and, above all, the notion that music could be forced to a position where it would enact ecstasy, not just show it. Like Jackson Pollock’s painterly abstractions, Coltrane’s Sun Ship (1965) and Interstellar Space (recorded in 1967, released posthumously in 1972), in particular, signalled this shift. In the definitive 1960s statement of free jazz, the eleven-piece Ascension (1965), Coltrane not only aims for ecstatic release but tries to lose this release – attaining, briefly, almost insensibly, a moment of nothing. While Miles Davis’s early genre-crossing directly influenced many progressive rock musicians, a more accurate signal of what was to come was evident in albums such as Coleman’s Free Jazz and Coltrane’s Ascension, which develop over a long period of time and offer the prospect of limitless music. The blues revival musicians of the early 1960s, who would feed into heavy rock and progressive rock, not only worked through the palette of Muddy Waters and Fats Waller but looked to jazz as a method that would culminate in Jimi Hendrix’s stretching of the idea of the solo.9 On the face of it, Hendrix’s lengthy solos appear to be a step back from free jazz, as Hendrix becomes the solitary hero exploring the boundaries between music and self, supported by his trusty sidekicks. This would be to underestimate the contribution made, especially by drummer Mitch Mitchell, to a group dynamic of improvisation\n\nExtended Form\n\n27\n\nin The Jimi Hendrix Experience (forming in London in 1966), but the key is to look at the moment within rock history that gave rise to Hendrix and British blues guitarists such as Eric Clapton and Peter Green. For all the eventual cross-pollination of genres, it seems that internally each one followed a path of development towards increased complexity and a potentially radical awareness of pushing the limits of established musical forms.10 As the next chapter develops within the cultural context of late 1960s Anglo-American musical exchange, rock music was still a recent phenomenon and quickly proliferated as a range of different musical styles, which signalled that generic progression in popular music was accelerating in the mid-1960s. Even from within this musical climate, Hendrix’s solos are much more an exploration of possibility, along with a loss of self in that possibility, than those of other solo guitarists of the time. Hendrix steps apart from the group and crowd to bring back the moment of his stepping away, in an effort to create something which, for Paul Gilroy, was like an ‘electric church’.11 The blues revival and boom that Hendrix surpassed had already been in swing in London since the late 1950s. It initially revolved around the reception and replication of American blues and ‘race music’, and as British musicians came into contact with established blues performers the revival became more of a process of translation and transformation.12 Blues was not purist in the way that fans of the time took it to be, but it was just as much a formal approach or set of methods used to convey authenticity. This creative rethinking of what the blues meant formally freed up early rock musicians to move beyond what on record seemed like fixed templates and 4/4 rhythms – a development that can best be seen through British blues groups such as Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated (formed in 1961), John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers (1963–7) and early Jethro Tull recordings from 1967 to 1969. As part of this freeing-up process, rock bands moved from playing covers to writing songs, and shifted from pure performance to singles and albums. Progressive rock would not be a full rejection of blues-based rock, especially because with hindsight we can see how the experimentation of the late 1960s flowed directly from the translation of blues and jazz into rock. Ultimately, the early 1960s rock version of the blues (as seen in London) remained a potential source for progressive rock, with Hendrix, Clapton and Keith Emerson consolidating the relevance of musical virtuosity on the back of blues. What differentiates blues from prog rock is that, for progressive groups, blues was just one genre or resource among many others such as soul that merged into something new.\n\n28\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nBy 1966–7, rock performances were elongating under the influence of cannabis and LSD. Psychedelic music emerged as a response to the effects of LSD; it tried not simply to emulate drug-taking or provide a background to consumption but rather to replicate the sensory experience of a trip by creating a total environment. This can be seen across a musical spectrum, including bluesbased recordings and short tracks by Fleetwood Mac, such as the psychedelic breaks that punctuate the melodic ‘Man of the World’ (1969) and the lyrics of the blues-rock hybrid ‘The Green Manalishi (with the Two-Pronged Crown)’ (1970). Fleetwood Mac did not experiment with the extended form as much as other blues musicians – the segues between tracks on The Jimi Hendrix Experience’s final 1968 recording Electric Ladyland provide a clearer example of extended form. However, between the expansion of the blues form into nascent rock music and the use of drugs that suggested a longer format for songs, rock literally expanded in time from the mid-1960s onwards. Even before this, popular music was expanding and stretching vertically into complexity, incorporating non-Western or non-rock forms. It did this through the fuzz of psychedelic music, literal referencing (as on The Beatles’ 1966 album Revolver), an interest in Asian music and mysticism (George Harrison’s sitar songs), or a heightening of content as a formal strategy (as with The Kinks’ take on middle England on The Village Green Preservation Society of 1968).13 Before tracks stretched in terms of length, individual notes and chords expanded. Guitar-playing in the 1950s and the early 1960s exploited the newly commercially available electric guitar through solos and overdriving of amplifiers. The distortion and fuzziness of sound that had once been seen as a problem was now what Michael Hicks calls ‘the essence of the sound [and] that essence signified raw power, survivability in the face of interference’.14 Deep Purple’s Ritchie Blackmore and The Kinks’ Ray Davies are among many who purposely damaged amplifiers to produce a fuzz-driven sound, and effects boxes were purpose-built for such outcomes.15 Although it might be imagined that garage and American psychedelia were in some way the scuzz to prog rock’s clean sound, in the late 1960s Keith Emerson would overdrive amps as a central part of sound in his band The Nice, and the opening track, ‘21st Century Schizoid Man’, on King Crimson’s debut album from 1969 is awash with distortion on voice and guitar alike. With feedback and other effects, rock simultaneously expanded the reach of its music in terms of volume and its range of instrumentation, as even a trio could now produce a wide array of sound live. This expansion became virtually\n\nExtended Form\n\n29\n\ninfinite once the studio was mobilized, particularly via multitracking but also by structuring a recording to provide a band with its own individual sound. Studios were key players even in the 1950s, helping to create distinctive sounds in order to trade singers and bands on authenticity (for example, the ‘slap-back’ echo effect practised at the Sun Studio, Memphis), whereas producers had to work out how to record feedback and distortion as they ‘wanted to faithfully document the distorted sound of the guitars, rather than distort the recording by overdriving the microphones’.16 The major change in the mid-1960s was the ownership of the studio process across a range of genres – from soul to rock to nascent dub – and related closely to machine-led sounds in live performance, achieved by the manipulation of amplifiers and effects pedals.17 The translation of live music through technologies of studio fidelity was matched in the mid-1960s with a move to record the lengthened versions of songs that bands were now playing in concerts. Early 1960s rock bands, jug bands and hippie jam bands were all stretching out tracks through solos, mirroring the way jazz appropriated (and retrospectively created) musical standards. It is misleading to infer the length of jams is in itself a precursor or early moment of prog. Just as the control of the studio by bands or chosen producers defines the move to progressive rock, the decision to record lengthened tracks as part of an album proved crucial for rock, for lyric-based jazz or for soul. An album had to be more explicitly constructed and was no longer seen as an inferior index to the ‘true’ live performance of the elongated form. It also became clear that an album had two sides. This realization gave groups the opportunity to create different moods on each side, or to have more commercial songs on one side and extended jams or compositions on the other.18 The earliest long tracks were jam-based extensions of songs, replicating the live versions of those tracks. Lengthier composed tracks did not appear until the late 1960s, although even on albums such as Sgt. Pepper the pop song is on occasion relatively long for the period and rock genre. The Dutch Nederbeat or freakbeat band Q65 ended its 1966 album Revolution with a thirteenminute version of Chicago bluesman Willie Dixon’s ‘Bring It on Home’. The simple musical vocabulary is pushed through many permutations, with the guitar sound alternating between a wide range of styles and sustained periods of fuzzed riffing; the refrain of ‘bringing it home’ is literally replicated as the vocals continually circle around the title line. Experimentation, though, is at a premium – occasional bursts of reverb and a short burst of Maurice Ravel’s Boléro (1928) are exceptions. Equally, ‘Revolutions’ is not a track about\n\n30\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nvirtuosity on the model of Cream’s blues workouts, nor does the track perform the same work as the brutal minimalism of The Velvet Underground’s ‘Sister Ray’ (1968), with its ten minutes of percussive chords, extended to over twentyfive minutes in later performances. The track by Q65 mirrors soul conventions of reiteration and alteration as a track develops in its tone, volume and key, as well as through improvisational variation rather than composed change. Two key soul tracks that used this method were Syl Johnson’s ‘Is It Because I’m Black’, released as a single in late 1969, and Baby Huey’s extended take on Sam Cooke’s iconic 1964 song ‘A Change Is Going to Come’. Johnson’s track (7:35) questions the values of supposed equality in the United States and recognizes that the struggle for civil rights and social uplift have not (or not yet) eroded the deep-seated reproduction of racial inequality and the structural racism that underpins it. Repetitions and an increased vocal urgency supply development as well as formally embodying the experience of endlessly imposed racial injustice at the day-to-day level, in tandem with the legal and ideological manifestations of racism. Released in 1971 on The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend, Baby Huey’s version of ‘A Change Is Going to Come’ might come later than the other extended tracks discussed here, but it exemplifies the drive towards extended narrative that prog was still only discovering at the time. The 9:25 duration sees Baby Huey detour into his life experience, complete with studio effects, and the track ends in a faded climax as reverb undoes the impact of the horn section. These effects also highlight the influence of psychedelia in soul, showing that patterns of influence were feeding both into and out from rock music. Side-long tracks might have been common in instrumental jazz albums by the mid-1960s, but rock adopted the form only very tentatively. Recorded in 1966, but released in 1967, was ‘Revelation’, the first side-long rock track, written by Los Angeles rock band Love for its second album Da Capo. Although the band subsequently expressed its dissatisfaction with the track on the grounds that it was not long enough, at 18:55 there is more than enough of it. The argument was that in concert ‘Revelation’ would be a vehicle for lengthy jamming and solos, but it had to be dramatically shortened for the recording. Unlike the band’s inventive singles, there is little development on this track, although occasionally a rock-funk freak-out threatens to erupt (as in the section with saxophone, from 12:30 to around 16 minutes). Again, despite the track’s untypical conservatism, Love makes a strong statement that goes beyond the track itself. As extended tracks on concept albums released in 1967 by The Pink Floyd and The Moody\n\nExtended Form\n\n31\n\nBlues demonstrate (see Chapter 2), there need not be temporal or sonic limits to rock songs or albums. In 1968, The Nice produced a side-long track in the form of the title track to Ars Longa Vita Brevis, which aspired to be a reformulation of the symphonic form in rock terms. Already, the band’s first album, The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack, released the previous year, had featured music from a range of styles, notably classical and jazz. The latter style is directly represented by ‘Rondo’, based on a Dave Brubeck piece, but elsewhere there are moments of jazz playing by Keith Emerson. Classical music also features explicitly on these two albums, with versions of works by Leoš Janáček, Jean Sibelius and Johann Sebastian Bach. Although this might seem the height of pretension in a rock context (and the symphonic side of Ars Longa Vita Brevis is unsure how to combine the two forms into ‘classical rock’), the attempt to create something outside of existing genres is a radical move that replicates developments in jazz. Rather than being a cosy meeting of different sectors of high culture, the genres collide, the sounds are often overdriven and, as with much of British progressive rock, the album also features the ‘low music’ of music hall.19 The most innovative stretch by The Nice is its version of Leonard Bernstein’s ‘America’. Bernstein’s track was a centrepiece of the 1961 musical West Side Story and The Nice released its sixminute instrumental version of it as a single in 1968. The song is dissected by Emerson’s dissonant keyboard rendering of variations on the main melody. The utopian promise of the United States is sonically shredded, just as it would be by Jimi Hendrix’s deconstruction of the US national anthem ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at the Woodstock Festival the following year (see Chapter 3). The Nice’s take on ‘America’ closes with a child’s voice that reinforces the critical purpose of this reworking: ‘America is pregnant with promises and anticipation, but is murdered by the hand of the inevitable.’ Yes also adapted Bernstein, covering ‘Something’s Coming’ (1969) for an early B-side, drawn out to 6:55 in length. In addition to meandering around the themes of the song, the complex drumming and the non-subservience of any instrument make this more of a pointer to the ensemble ethic of Yes than much of their first album from the same year (which features a lengthened take on The Beatles’ 1964 song ‘Every Little Thing’). It also refers to the song ‘America’, as did the group’s later version of Paul Simon’s ‘America’ (1971). Yes’s version, at 10:40, represents a high point of pushing a song beyond its limits: the original floats in the centre and is preceded by a long instrumental passage that uses both Simon’s and Bernstein’s songs for material. Although it lacks the politically\n\n32\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nradical purpose of The Nice’s ‘America’, this track expands on a vision of what America might be, as the personal geography of Simon’s song is placed in the midst of a wide expanse of music. This is an ever-broader America, full with the notion that there is always more to discover, to explore and to understand, emphasized by the song’s breaking up into differing guitar styles. The authentic extended rock composition appears in the form of side two of Procol Harum’s Shine on Brightly (1968) and does not quite fill a side. But at 17:27 and divided into five parts (with further subsections), it develops the full potential of the lengthened rock track into a complex and meaningful form. Procol Harum had already rethought the possibilities of the rock single, with their borrowing of Bach for ‘A Whiter Shade of Pale’ (1967), but whereas that track shuffles through an impressionistic surrealism, ‘In Held ’Twas in I’ takes the drug culture and Eastern mysticism spreading through 1968 as content and driver of musical form. Edward Macan has argued that progressive rock used classical music as a means of ‘solving the problem’ of psychedelia, insofar as psychedelic music took up a lot of time but did not really progress.20 This is an important insight but needs modifying. The Grateful Dead, for example, the epitome of psychedelic jamming music, released ‘That’s It for the Other One’ on Anthem of the Sun (1968) which, although only 7:40 long, is divided into four parts and is free of the aimlessness psychedelic music is presumed to have once it pushes beyond the garage-style singles of the mid-1960s. ‘That’s It for the Other One’ is not as organized and developmental as ‘In Held ’Twas in I’, which is a fully formed progressive sonata-type piece, but both are psychedelic. What differentiates Procol Harum’s track, and makes it a type of progressive rock along with bands such as Rare Bird, is that it takes a position on psychedelic experience by using its music as a resource. Procol Harum’s track follows a spiritual journey from the seeking of enlightenment, through madness (not only signified by the lyrics but also announced by a carnival section, the breaking down into micro-sections around the ‘In the Autumn of my Madness’ lyrical part, and the unmooring of that section) and through spacey slow organ and guitar that move towards a reflective wisdom. Although the attainment of self-knowledge is uncertain (the narrator may be a fool for thinking himself wise), a lengthy choral and then instrumental finale signals resolution. ‘In Held ’Twas in I’ is more than a personal reflection or the capturing of an individual experience, through its exploration of the psychedelic fusion of mind and spirit and the hippie interest in holistic experience. This is signalled by the change of musical styles and the\n\nExtended Form\n\n33\n\nearly incorporation of drones and sitar, which suggest the descent of the mindexpanding quest into formalism without criticizing the hippie venture. The track is, then, meta-psychedelic in that it comments on psychedelia by using its own methods. As such, it can be read as an emblem of the move from psychedelic rock to progressive rock, even as it reveals their connectedness. Ultimately, as the following chapters explore, the alteration in the idea of recording or composition is not possible without a radical rethinking of what the studio is, of what a band should do with an album and the notion that rock should be more than entertainment with a ready recourse to the familiar and the everyday.\n\nNotes 1 David Weigel, The Show That Never Ends: The Rise and Fall of Prog Rock (New York: Norton, 2017), 3–6. 2 Duke Ellington had already pushed the boundary of the single 78 rpm record towards the way classical music was presented on Creole Rhapsody in 1931, filling both sides of the record. The year 1937 also saw another piece, Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue, fill two 78s. 3 The work was originally designed to represent a tripartite history of the black experience in the United States. Subsequently, isolated parts appeared both live and on record. Mike Levin summarizes the mixed reception of Black, Brown and Beige as a performance, and concludes that the resistance was due to its refusal of generic restraint and its scale: Mike Levin, ‘In Downbeat’, in The Duke Ellington Reader, ed. Mark Tucker (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 166–70.

This was not just about resuscitating a tradition but about renovation and combination with other musical approaches. For a clear expression of how folk and blues revivals were close together in aspiration, and how they related to one another, see Colin Harper, Dazzling Stranger: Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival (London: Bloomsbury, 2006). 10 This is not to imply that genres simply mature and that progressive rock stood as a highpoint of this generic maturity. It is to make the point that without establishing forms it is impossible to establish a genre: in this case, rock ’n’ roll succeeded by rock. 11 See Paul Gilroy, ‘Soundscapes of the Black Atlantic’, in The Audio Culture Reader, ed. Michael Bull and Les Back (Oxford: Berg, 2003), 381–95. 12 For a detailed account of the presence, reception and mobilization of blues in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, see Roberta Freund Schwartz, How Britain Got the Blues: The Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2007). 13 We would argue that the long development of modernism in the visual arts is accelerated in the rock music of the 1960s. So the incorporation of narrative content by The Kinks, with its focus on everyday British society, can be equated with the nineteenth-century painterly realism of Gustave Courbet or with post-war neorealism in cinema. 14 Michael Hicks, Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic and Other Satisfactions (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1999), 13. 15 Ibid., 17–18. 16 Ibid., 14.

The Yardbirds’ single includes feedback, reversed tapes of guitars and a muffled voiceover from Jeff Beck in its instrumental section; it tightly integrates guitar through electrical and recording technologies rather than simply using these as ornamentation. 18 Noted by Bill Martin, Listening to the Future: The Time of Progressive Rock, 1968– 1978 (Chicago: Open Court, 1998), 153. 19 Starting in the 1930s, Duke Ellington moved jazz towards classical approaches. Miles Davis’s Sketches of Spain (1960), which focuses on Rodrigo’s guitar concerto, also took classical music out of its fixity. Neither goes as far as The Nice in incorporating different genres (including classical music) while maintaining the audibility of those genres clearly within the new work. 20 Macan, Rocking the Classics, 43–4.\n\n2\n\nThe Roots of Progressive Rock\n\nThe history of a musical movement is often recounted as a series of dramatic beginnings when disparate musical and social trends collide in a moment of creative fusion. These moments are usually mythologized and are very often established well after the fact. The recording of Elvis Presley’s first single for Sun Records in Memphis in 1954, for example, is often taken as a metonym for the birth of rock ’n’ roll. This particular beginning makes sense only retrospectively, though, in light of Elvis’s growing celebrity of 1956, and by ignoring the complex intersecting currents of regional and ‘race’ music that preceded it. As such, the nineteen-year-old Elvis is a symbol of a more contested cultural history, which incorporates the commercial repackaging of ‘race music’, social and political tensions in the Deep South, the growth of mass culture after the Second World War and the entrepreneurialism of producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Although it is unhelpful to project the emergence of a progressive rock style onto mid-1950s rock ’n’ roll – a task that Bill Martin attempts by locating a ‘synthesis of simplicity and complexity’ in the songs of Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis – the dynamic of fusion, on both social and musical levels, undergirds most interpretations of progressive rock.1 In developing our reading of fusion, we argue in the first section of this book that the traditional starting point of progressive rock in 1967–8 needs to be placed within broader cultural and geographical frames. The birth of progressive rock is frequently traced back to the release of The Beatles’ 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, for a number of different reasons. The year 1967 was the high point for psychedelic culture and the hippie experience on both sides of the Atlantic, epitomized by the fourteenminute avant-garde drone track ‘Carnival of Light’ that The Beatles played (only once) in January at the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave at the Roundhouse Theatre, London. Released that May, Sgt. Pepper was the first rock release to weave a concept through a song-cycle that encompasses a whole album and to make\n\n36\n\nBeyond and Before\n\nthat concept integral to the cover art. The concept is embedded in the title of the album; developed most explicitly in the two versions of the ‘Sgt. Pepper’ song (at the beginning and towards the end of the album) that invite the reader into the album’s sonic world; and is symbolized by The Beatles’ brass-band costumes on the sleeve, surrounded by a cast of diverse cultural and historical figures. The cover, by British Pop artist Peter Blake and directed by modern-art champion Robert Fraser, fuses high and low culture – from Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx and Oscar Wilde to Stan Laurel, Bob Dylan and Marilyn Monroe – and is developed through the use of a brass band on the album, mixed with what Jonathan Gould sees as a parody of ‘Tin Pan Alley, Denmark Street and Broadway’ which ‘drift[s] from track to track, exploiting the same sorts of incongruity between style, form, and content’ that could be detected on tracks from the band’s previous albums Rubber Soul (1965) and Revolver (1966).2 Despite parodic and jocular elements and the retrieval of bygone popular motifs drawn from vaudeville, circus and music-hall, tracks such as the acronymic ‘Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds’ and the elegiac ‘A Day in the Life’ make Sgt. Pepper an emphatic statement that not only was The Beatles now a serious band but its members had tapped into an underground music scene at one remove from, or even in direct opposition to, the cultural and commercial mainstream. The countercultural impulse in the second half of the 1960s – particularly 1967 – is one of the major reasons why critics such as Clinton Heylin return to Sgt. Pepper as a dramatic moment of emergence.3 The experimental use of sampling and recording techniques make it a remarkably innovative studio album for the time. This wide range of instrumentation included woodwind, brass, organ, harpsichord, sitar and tambora; the use of the polyphonic Mellotron keyboard made possible new sounds effects; and a multitrack environment was created in Abbey Road Studios to manip"
