        "text": "American football player (born 1996)\n\nAmerican football player\n\nChristian Jackson McCaffrey (born June 7, 1996), known by the initials CMC,[1] is an American professional football running back for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal and was selected by the Carolina Panthers eighth overall in the 2017 NFL draft. As a sophomore in 2015, McCaffrey was named AP College Football Player of the Year and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy. He holds the NCAA record for most all-purpose yards in a season (3,864).\n\nMcCaffrey holds numerous NFL and Panthers franchise records and is one of three players ever to record 1,000 rushing and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season, doing so in 2019. McCaffrey was traded to the 49ers in 2022 and was named the Offensive Player of the Year a year later after leading the league in scrimmage yards and touchdowns en route to an appearance in Super Bowl LVIII. A member of the McCaffrey football family, he is the son of Ed and brother of Max, Dylan, and Luke.\n\nEarly life\n\nChristian Jackson McCaffrey was born in Castle Rock, Colorado, on June 7, 1996, the son of former Stanford and NFL wide receiver Ed McCaffrey and former Stanford soccer player Lisa McCaffrey. He attended Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado for his freshman year and then Valor Christian High School in Highlands Ranch, Colorado under coach Brent Vieselmeyer for the rest of his high school career.[2] He played running back, wide receiver, cornerback, and punter. He broke numerous Colorado high school records including career total touchdowns (141), career all purpose yards (8,845), career touchdown receptions (47), and single season all-purpose yards (3,032).[3] He was the Gatorade Football Player of the Year for Colorado in both 2012 and 2013.[4] He also played basketball.[5]\n\nMcCaffrey was also a standout sprinter on the track and field team. As a sophomore, he placed second in the 100-meter dash at the Mountain Vista Boulder Invitational with a wind-assisted (+6.2 m/s) career-best time of 10.75 seconds.[6] As a junior in 2013, he finished sixth in the 100-meter dash (10.89s) and ninth in the 200-meter dash (22.17s) at the CHSAA State Meet.[7]\n\nConsidered one of the best one hundred football players in his national high school class, he was selected as a 2014 U.S. Army All-American. He was rated by Rivals.com as a four-star recruit and was ranked as the third best all-purpose back in his class and 77th best player overall.[8] He committed to Stanford University to play college football.[9][10]\n\nCollege career\n\n2014 season\n\nMcCaffrey played in all 13 games as a true freshman for the Cardinal in 2014. He shared the backfield with Remound Wright, Barry J. Sanders, and Kelsey Young.[11] In his collegiate debut, he had a 52-yard receiving touchdown against UC Davis.[12] He finished the year with 300 rushing yards on 43 carries and 251 receiving yards on 17 receptions with two total touchdowns.[13][14]\n\n2015 season\n\nMcCaffrey had a breakout sophomore season in 2015.[15][16] He surpassed Barry Sanders' NCAA record of 3,250 all-purpose yards, finishing with 3,864.[17] McCaffrey ranked second in the nation with 2,019 rushing yards,[18] becoming the first Stanford player to rush for 2,000 in a season.[19] He also set numerous other Stanford records during the season including rushing yards in a single game (243)[20] and all-purpose yards in a game (461).[21]\n\nMcCaffrey was a consensus All-American and was the Associated Press College Football Player of the Year, Pac-12 Player of the Year, and Paul Hornung Award winner.[22][23][24] He also finished second to Alabama's Derrick Henry in the 2015 Heisman Trophy voting.[25]\n\nHe set the school record for all purpose yards in a single game in the Pac-12 Championship against USC with 461 total yards.[26]\n\nDuring the 2016 Rose Bowl against Iowa, McCaffrey became the first player to rush for over 100 yards (172) and have over 100 yards receiving (109) in a Rose Bowl game. Overall, he set a new Rose Bowl record with 368 all-purpose yards, breaking the previous record set in 2012 by Wisconsin's Jared Abbrederis.[27]\n\n2016 season\n\nThrough the end of the 2016 regular season, McCaffrey led the nation in all purpose yards (211.6 yards per game). He led the Pac-12 Conference in rushing yards (1,603) and ranked fourth in the nation in rushing yards per game (145.7).[28] After being injured during the Cardinal's 42–16 loss to Washington State on October 8, McCaffrey sat out for the team's 17–10 victory in the 2016 edition of the Notre Dame-Stanford rivalry the following week.[29] McCaffrey set a Stanford single-game rushing record with 284 rushing yards against California.[30] McCaffrey was named to the 2016 All-Pac-12 first-team and was named the CoSIDA Academic All-American of the Year. After the season, he decided to enter the 2017 NFL draft.[31]\n\nOn December 19, McCaffrey announced he would not participate in the team's Sun Bowl game against North Carolina, opting to skip the game to prepare for the NFL draft.[32] His decision was met with mixed reactions; supporters agreed it was a smart decision,[33][34][35] while those opposing considered the move selfish,[36] and potentially detrimental to college football should other players follow suit.[37][38][39] Radio host Mike Greenberg, in defense of McCaffrey, said, \"Calling Christian McCaffrey a quitter for skipping an exhibition game to prepare for his career is the height of just not getting it.\"[39] By 2018, NFL draft prospects sitting out bowls had become much more common and caused little controversy among fans.[40][41]\n\nCollege statistics\n\nStanford Cardinal Season Rushing Receiving Punt return Kickoff return All-purpose Att Yds Avg TD Rec Yds Avg TD Ret Yds Avg TD Ret Yds Avg TD Yds TD 2014 42 300 7.1 0 17 251 14.8 2 9 154 17.1 0 5 91 18.2 0 796 2 2015 337 2,019 6.0 8 45 645 14.3 5 15 130 8.7 1 37 1,070 28.9 1 3,864 15 2016 253 1,603 6.3 13 37 310 8.4 3 10 96 9.6 0 14 318 22.7 0 2,327 16 Total 632 3,922 6.2 21 99 1,206 12.2 10 34 380 11.2 1 56 825 14.7 1 6,333 33\n\nProfessional career\n\nPre-draft\n\nExternal videos McCaffrey's NFL Combine workout Christian McCaffrey's 40-yard dash McCaffrey's NFL Combine interview McCaffrey's Stanford Pro Day Highlights\n\nMcCaffrey received an invitation to the NFL Combine as one of the top running back prospects entering the draft and completed all of the required combine drills and participated in positional drills. He attended Stanford's Pro Day, but was satisfied with his combine numbers and only ran positional drills for the NFL scouts and representatives. McCaffrey was projected to be a first round pick by the majority of NFL experts and analysts. He was ranked the third best running back in the draft by Sports Illustrated, the fourth best running back by Pro Football Focus, and ranked the second best by NFLDraftScout.com and ESPN.[42][43][44]\n\nPre-draft measurables Height Weight Arm length Hand span 40-yard dash 10-yard split 20-yard split 20-yard shuttle Three-cone drill Vertical jump Broad jump Bench press Wonderlic 5 ft 11+1⁄4 in\n\n(1.81 m) 202 lb\n\n(92 kg) 30 in\n\n(0.76 m) 9 in\n\n(0.23 m) 4.48 s 1.52 s 2.60 s 4.22 s 6.57 s 37.5 in\n\n(0.95 m) 10 ft 1 in\n\n(3.07 m) 10 reps 21 All values from NFL Combine.[45][46]\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\n2017 season\n\nThe Carolina Panthers selected McCaffrey in the first round with the eighth overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft.[47] He was the second running back taken, after fourth overall pick Leonard Fournette.[48]\n\nExternal videos Panthers select McCaffrey eighth overall McCaffrey receives call from Panthers\n\nOn May 4, 2017, the Carolina Panthers signed McCaffrey to a four-year, $17.2 million contract with a signing bonus of $10.7 million.[49][50]\n\nMcCaffrey made his NFL season debut in the Panthers' season-opener against the San Francisco 49ers and recorded 47 rushing yards, 38 receiving yards, and a lost fumble in a 23–3 victory.[51] In Week 3, against the New Orleans Saints, he had nine receptions for 101 yards.[52] In Week 5 against the Detroit Lions, McCaffrey scored his first career touchdown on a six-yard shovel pass from quarterback Cam Newton.[53] In Week 9, against the Atlanta Falcons, he scored his first career rushing touchdown on a four-yard rush in the second quarter.[54] In the team's Monday Night Football win over the Miami Dolphins, McCaffrey scored twice–one rushing and one receiving–and totaled 50 yards.[55] In Week 15, in a victory over the Green Bay Packers, McCaffrey brought his season total to 73 catches and five receiving touchdowns, being the only rookie running back in NFL history with at least 70 receptions and five touchdown catches before being joined by Alvin Kamara later in the season.[56][57] The following week, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, McCaffrey brought his catch total to 75, breaking the Panthers rookie record of 74 set by Kelvin Benjamin.[58][59] He finished his rookie season with 435 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 80 receptions, 651 receiving yards, and five receiving touchdowns.[60] The Panthers made the playoffs as the #5-seed.[61] In the Wild Card Round against the New Orleans Saints, he had 16 rushing yards, six receptions, 101 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown in the 31–26 loss.[62]\n\n2018 season\n\nIn Week 2, against the Falcons, McCaffrey recorded a career-high 14 receptions for 102 receiving yards to go along with 37 rushing yards in the 31–24 loss.[63] In Week 3, against the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 28 carries for a career-high 184 rushing yards in the 31–21 victory.[64] Though limited in yardage for much of the middle of the season, from Weeks 8–10 McCaffrey compiled seven touchdowns in three games (joining DeAngelo Williams in 2008 as the only other Panther with this distinction), including all of Carolina's scores in a 52–21 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.[65] On November 25, 2018, McCaffrey became the first Panther ever to have over 100 yards rushing and receiving in the same game. He had 125 yards rushing and 112 yards receiving in a loss to the Seattle Seahawks.[66] The 237 yards set a Panthers franchise record for most yards from scrimmage in a game. He also was the first player since Arian Foster in 2011 to have 100+ yards and a touchdown both rushing and receiving, and the only player with 10+ receptions in such a game.[67] During Week 15, in a Monday Night Football showdown against the 11–2 Saints, McCaffrey threw a 50-yard touchdown pass on 4th and 2 to Chris Manhertz.[68] With 50 rushing, 50 receiving and 50 passing yards, he joined Walter Payton and Gale Sayers as the only others to achieve this.[69] During Week 16 against the Atlanta Falcons, McCaffrey broke Matt Forte's record for most receptions by a running back in a single season, finishing with 101 rushing yards and 77 receiving yards as the Panthers lost 10–24.[70] Since the Panthers were eliminated from the playoffs, he had a limited role in the Week 17 victory over the New Orleans Saints with 40 total yards.[71] Overall, he finished the 2018 season with 1,098 rushing yards, seven rushing touchdowns, 107 receptions, 867 receiving yards, and six receiving touchdowns.[72] McCaffrey had the opposite of a sophomore slump, as he became the Panthers franchise record holder of all-purpose yards in a season with 1,965.[73] He was ranked 42nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[74]\n\n2019 season\n\nIn Week 1 against the Los Angeles Rams, McCaffrey rushed 19 times for 128 yards and two touchdowns and caught 10 passes for 81 yards as the Panthers lost 27–30.[75] He played every offensive snap and became the first player to post 10 or more receptions and 120 or more rushing yards in two career games.[76] After losing All-Pro quarterback Cam Newton in Week 2, the Panthers beat the Arizona Cardinals 38–20 in Week 3, where McCaffrey rushed 24 times for 153 yards with a career long 76-yard touchdown and caught three passes for 35 yards.[77] In Week 4 against the Houston Texans, McCaffrey rushed 27 times for 93 yards and one touchdown and caught 10 passes for 86 yards in the 16–10 win.

He also fumbled for the first time this season, and was stopped just short of the goal line in a failed comeback late in the fourth quarter in the 16–24 loss.[83] During a Week 11 29–3 loss to the Falcons, McCaffrey finished with 121 receiving yards and 70 rushing yards; his 191 yards from scrimmage was again more than the rest of team's combined 156.[84] He recorded his 53rd reception, breaking LaDainian Tomlinson's record for the most catches by a running back in an NFL player's first three seasons.[85] In Week 12, against the Saints, he totaled 133 scrimmage yards (64 rushing, 69 receiving), a rushing touchdown, and a receiving touchdown.[86] In Week 15 against the Seahawks, McCaffrey rushed 19 times for 87 yards and two touchdowns and caught eight passes for 88 yards during the 30–24 loss.[87] In Week 16 against the Indianapolis Colts, McCaffrey rushed 13 times for 54 yards and caught 15 passes for 119 yards during the 38–6 loss.[88] In Week 17 against the New Orleans Saints, McCaffrey rushed nine times for 26 yards and a touchdown and caught seven passes for 72 yards in the 42–10 loss.

He was placed on injured reserve on September 23.[100] He was activated on November 7 prior to Week 9.[101] In Week 9 against the Kansas City Chiefs, McCaffrey recorded 69 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown and 82 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown during the 33–31 loss. During the game, McCaffrey suffered a shoulder injury and was later ruled out of the Panthers' following game and later the remainder of the season.[102] He was ranked 44th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[103]\n\n2021 season\n\nMcCaffrey started the 2021 season with 177 scrimmage yards in Week 1 against the New York Jets and 137 scrimmage yards in Week 2 against the Saints.[104][105] In Week 3, McCaffrey suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out the next two games.[106] Despite returning to practice prior to Week 6, he was placed on injured reserve on October 16.[107] He was activated on November 6 for Week 9.[108] He went over 100 scrimmage yards in the following three games. On November 29, the Panthers announced that McCaffrey would miss the remainder of the season with an ankle injury he suffered during the Panthers Week 12 loss to the Dolphins. He finished the 2021 season with 442 rushing yards, 343 receiving yards, and two total touchdowns in seven games.[109][110]\n\n2022 season\n\nIn the season opener against the Cleveland Browns, McCaffrey had 14 carries for 57 yards and one touchdown in a 24–26 defeat.[111][112] Through the first six games with the Panthers, McCaffrey had 393 rushing yards, 277 receiving yards, three total touchdowns, and 670 scrimmage yards.[113][114]\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\n\n2022 season\n\nMcCaffrey was traded to the 49ers on October 20, 2022,[115] in exchange for a second, third, and fourth-round pick in the 2023 NFL draft, and a fifth-round pick in the 2024 draft.[116]\n\nMcCaffrey made his 49ers debut in Week 7 against the Chiefs, where he had 38 rushing yards and 24 receiving yards in the 44–23 loss.[117] In Week 8 against the Rams, McCaffrey became the first 49ers running back to record passing, rushing, and receiving touchdowns in the same game. McCaffrey was the fourth player since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger to complete the trifecta.[118] He was named National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for Week 8.[119] In Week 13, against the Dolphins, he had 146 scrimmage yards and a receiving touchdown in the 33–17 victory.[120] In the following game against the Buccaneers, he had 153 scrimmage yards, one rushing touchdown, and one receiving touchdown in the 35–7 victory.[121] In the next game, against the Seahawks, he had 138 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 21–13 victory.[122] In Week 17, against the Raiders, he had 193 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 37–34 victory.[123] He finished the 2022 season with 244 carries for 1,139 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns to go along with 85 receptions for 741 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns.[124] He was named to the Pro Bowl.[125]\n\nMcCaffrey was productive in the postseason for the 49ers.

For his performance in the game, he was made the FedEx Ground Player of the Week.[132] In Week 3 against the New York Giants, McCaffrey had 18 carries for 85 yards and a touchdown, and five receptions for 34 yards.[133] Against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 4, McCaffrey had 20 carries for 106 yards and three touchdowns, and seven receptions for 71 yards and a touchdown.[134] With his first touchdown in the game, and his 13th straight game with a touchdown, McCaffrey broke Jerry Rice's franchise record for most consecutive games with a touchdown.[135] He was named both FedEx Ground Player of the Week (for a fourth straight time), and NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[136]\n\nIn Week 8, against the Cincinnati Bengals, McCaffrey had 12 rushes for 54 yards and one touchdown, as well as six receptions for 64 yards and a touchdown in the 31–17 loss. With a 2-yard rushing score, McCaffrey tied Lenny Moore's NFL record for the most games in a row with a touchdown score recorded, having had 17 straight games with a touchdown.[137] However, the streak would be broken during their Week 10 matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars, in which he recorded 16 carries for 95 yards, and six receptions for 47 yards.[138][139] During Week 12 against the Seattle Seahawks, McCaffrey recorded 19 carries for 114 yards and two touchdowns, as well as five receptions for 25 yards.
