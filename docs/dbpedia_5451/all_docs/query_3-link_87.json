Or does the original trilogy stand on its own?\n\nI read most of the earlier books, but I read them out of order, because many Australian booksellers make books sporadically available with no thought to series order (grr!). From memory, each book stood on its own, without any cliff-hangers or too much dependence on earlier books in the series. However, the world-building links the books together very well.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the first three books and the harper books. My favourite was The White Dragon, but I think it was more YA than some of the others, and I probably fitted into the target audience when I read it. I haven't re-read any of the books in the last few years, because I'm not sure that I'd enjoy them so much now.\n\nWhen I re-read the books in the 2000s, I was slightly troubled by how young some of the female protagonists were.\n\nOverread\n\nSearching for a flower\n\nJoined\n\nAug 22, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n4,301\n\nLocation\n\nHunting in the woods\n\nNov 7, 2015\n\n#7\n\nTypically its best to read in publication order for most things.\n\nPrequels set before the main events but published after tend to operate with the assumption that you've read the main books already. Thus the way they cover certain details is more revealing of latter events than it would otherwise be because the author is not trying to hide what will come in the future; the reader already knows it. So if you read them first they can spoil the latter parts of a series.\n\nAlso many series rely upon secrets to work; secrets which are often revealed within a prequel.\n\nConsider, outside of books, Starwars. The massive plot twist in Empire Strikes back works fantastically! However it utterly fails for any who start Starwars at the first Episode. For those people the huge plot twist of Empire Strikes back is a muted event.\n\nRay McCarthy\n\nSentient Marmite: The Truth may make you fret.\n\nJoined\n\nJul 16, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n8,090\n\nLocation\n\nThe Mid West (of Ireland)\n\nNov 7, 2015\n\n#8\n\nSee\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriageable_age\n\nThe UK School Leaving Age only raised to 16 in 1972, 17 in 2003 and 18 in Sept 2015.\n\nAlso see\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children\n\nIn many respects Pern while not actual Mediaeval has deliberately modelled it's culture on some Mediaeval aspects.

She seems to have genuinely wanted to give the fans what they wanted and seems to have been fond of the series. I thing she keep horses (closest thing to a Pernese dragon?) and called her house in Wicklow \"Dragonhold\". I don't know much about Todd, her son, or how much input Anne had into the co-written books. She seems to have coupled her name with a few other authors over the years.\n\nI bet it's not an easy decision to stop or continue if a series is popular for an author. A Studio or TV company is different. They will milk something to death. John Cleese only wrote 12 Fawlty Towers episodes. Though he famously needed the money he refused to allow any more to be created. There was an attempt to make a US setting version, but that's not the same thing as more episodes.\n\nOverread\n\nSearching for a flower\n\nJoined\n\nAug 22, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n4,301\n\nLocation\n\nHunting in the woods\n\nNov 8, 2015\n\n#16\n\nOh true money isn't everything; but I suspect it helps along with the fans with an author going further than they possibly should - when they might be better set to change hte setting and try something new; even if its still using similar elements as their first series.\n\nPersonally I think that's partly why authors like Robin Hobb write stories set in the same world but with different characters and different focuses. Her Farseer's series is not only differently cast, but differently written to her Liveships series.\n\nAnd yes didn't the US version of Fawlty Towers get rid of Basil ?\n\nhopewrites\n\nCrochet Streamer\n\nJoined\n\nOct 6, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n3,487\n\nLocation\n\nEarth\n\nNov 8, 2015\n\n#17\n\nI like to read it: Dragonflight, Dragon quest, White Dragon\n\nThen the Harperhall trillogy. I see it's not strictly publication order, but I feel that each of these sets should be read in their respective clumps.\n\nI find the rest are a bit more 'stand alone'ish and their introductions paraphrase up the essential Pernes history needed to jump in both feet and injoy.\n\nSince the introduction doesn't change much from one book to the next in the first trilogy, it was a few years of owning and loving the later books before I realized that the later books had different intros.\n\nFor that reason I recommend that where ever you chose to start, go a head and read the intro for each book. Yes lots of them are essentially the same, but the slight differences add that pinch of flavor that set tone and time before chapter 1 hits the ground running, making it easier to keep up.\n\nBAYLOR\n\nThere Are Always new Things to Learn.\n\nJoined\n\nJun 29, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n23,980\n\nNov 8, 2015\n\n#18\n\nPern is a bit like a few other series in that I feel the author found the novels turned into such regular income that it was impossible to put them down even once the spark of creation for them had waned.

But its a huge machine - games, TV show, merchandise - a lot of jobs rely on the income it generates.\n\nStargate to me not only got a little silly, but lazy and repetitive. I noticed that they'd fast dropped many alien cultures speaking anything but American and it got into a little rut of its own with Super-evil-bad-guy appearing every season. That and adding in Farscapes duo kinda sealed the madness (I forget his name, Chriton's actor is rather like Jonny Depp in that as soon as you see him you know chances are its going to be a silly role - or in Chritons case a somewhat insane guy)"
