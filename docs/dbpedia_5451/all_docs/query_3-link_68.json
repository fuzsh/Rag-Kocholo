        "text": "please stop him. dragonheart was not a very good book.\n\nokay so he is telling the story of the dragon riders that went back in time during the dragon plague. fine...poor storytelling. i mean his books are getting worse instead of better. there were so many thing i did not like.\n\nthe dialogue was a major issue. the ages of fiona and terin was another one, a lil gross and kinda unbelievable. the needless detail about how they were going to get the weyr up and running. i mean yeah it is nice to know but really so many pages of dialogue were spent on it i got bored. oh and how about the not keeping of the secrets from the future i mean they were blabbing to everyone stuff they should not.\n\ni am sorry it was just so ick. it was supposed to be more of a character story not a lot of action going on, the characters were great ideas but not very realistic or fully formed. i was sooo very disappointed.\n\ni think i should start a petition and send it to todd and anne mccaffrey. i think there are writers out there that would do a much better job at continuing the story of the dragonriders of pern than todd.\n\nRemember also the her publisher is possibly putting on some pressure for her to keep writing books - or at least continue the Pern saga. Also its very uncommon for a writer to allow another writer to take over their works (especially something of the size of Pern) for what ever reason (fear of it changing, fear of a different voice etc...) and most times this happens it tends to be with the sad death of a writer leaving works unfinished.\n\nNot all children of writers are good writers, one would hope that after many years though, that they have a good grasp of the world though an the thoughts of their parent as they write the story and also hear about it. Remember that they might well hear ideas and stories that we (readers) never get to see and are never recorded on paper.\n\nThat said he might just need more time to get used to writing - of course this does mean that we have to have substandard work in the collection - somthing that fans do not like and something which (in later years ) Todd might be less than enthusiastic about.\n\nHowever when all is said and done one has to remember on thing - Pern is not ours its hers (and her publishers to a lesser or greater extent) so in many ways it is not out right to demand anything from the writer with regard to their works. We do not pay an author to write we pay them for what they have written. Any petition or collection of people voicing displeasure must (I feel) take a firm, but respectful stance with this matter - not simply bossing Anne that she must not let her son write for that line would not only be insulting and rude, but it also hardens her against the idea from the get go and thus any hope will be lost.\n\nAn approach which (lets say) encourages a writer (in this case Todd) to develop his own voice and works separate from Pern instead might be met with more acceptance. Also such an appraoch should also take into account the publishers who might simply be placing pressure on the authors for more works in Pern - pressure (if needed) on them should be to allow Todd to be published away from Pern in a new direction"
