Plans that never considered that someone might want to harm her special tree.\n\nTribute: Amanda Brown, world-famous astronaut, would never tell her daughter, Annogi, the identity of her real father. And now, years after her mother's death, Annogi has hacked the station's security systems to find out her real dad's identity so that she can live with him. Only she didn't expect an intruder - with an axe.\n\nWhy I Shot My Car: What happens when a talking car demands attention? And there's a talking gun, too?\n\nDasher: Maggie Trudeaux was part of the fledgeling space navy and she wanted combat duty. She didn't think for a moment that she'd get it.\n\nMen! A pleasure night in Paris ends with a surprise.\n\nStone the Crows: Nerius Stimpton Poddlemore bore his name with all the grace that a youngster could manage.\n\nNOTE: Previously published as SIX."
