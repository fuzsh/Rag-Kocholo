She was the first woman to win the two top prizes for science fiction writing, the Hugo and Nebula awards. She was also given the American Library Association’s Margaret A. Edwards Award for Lifetime Literary Achievement in Young Adult Fiction, was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, and was named a Science Fiction Writers of America Nebula Grand Master. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1926, McCaffrey relocated to Ireland in the 1970s, where she lived in a house of her own design, named Dragonhold-Underhill. She died in 2011.\n\nTodd McCaffrey is the bestselling author of the Pern novel Dragonsblood, as well as Dragon’s Kin, which he co-wrote with his mother, Anne McCaffrey. A computer engineer, he currently lives in Los Angeles. Having grown up in Ireland with the epic of the Dragonriders of Pern, he is bursting with ideas for new stories of that world, its people, and its dragons.\n\nPraise for Dragon's Fire (Pern #19)\n\nPraise for Dragon’s Kin by Anne McCaffrey and Todd McCaffrey\n\n“Superb storytelling . . . Essential for Pern fans of all ages.”\n\n–Library Journal (starred review)\n\n“A guaranteed pleaser [in] one of sf’s most splendid and longest-lived sagas.”\n\n–Booklist\n\nPraise for Dragonsblood by Todd McCaffrey\n\n“Todd McCaffrey does something I didn’t think anyone could do: he writes Anne McCaffrey’s Pern. . . . May the saga continue!”\n\n–David Weber, author of The Shadow of Saganami\n\n“The torch has been passed and burns more brightly than ever. . . . [Dragonsblood] fits beautifully into the existing history and style of earlier books while still breaking new ground.”\n\n–Publishers Weekly"
