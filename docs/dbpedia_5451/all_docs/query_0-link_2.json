Broadly speaking, for the first two decades of its existence most scholarly work on SF tended to take three forms: theo­ retical efforts at definition that established the historical compass of the genre and elicited a canon of major works (see, for example, Alkon and also Malmgren); for­ malist studies that traced important iconic or ideational features of the field (see, for example, Wolfe); and critical investigations that purported to show the alignment of science fiction with specific trends in literary-cultural theory, such as feminism (see, for example, Wolmark). For all their many differences in orientation and emphasis, these approaches tended to treat SF as a more or less fixed genre, whether defined dis­ cursively (in terms of narratological features), theoretically (in terms of epistemologi­ cal structures), or institutionally (in terms of publishing categories). The overall thrust of this body of work was to argue for SF as a significant form of modern literature that raised consequential issues and intersected with major modes of criticism. The evolution of such a problematic is entirely understandable in context, given the recentness of SF’s entry into the academy. The first serious effort at a comprehensive bib­ liography of the English-language genre was Everett F. Bleiler’s Checklist of Fantastic Literature, published in 1948, a year after the first book-length survey of the field, J. O. Bailey’s Pilgrims in Space and Time: Trends and Patterns in Scientific and Utopian Fiction, appeared. The first dedicated journal, Extrapolation, was founded in 1959, colleges and universities started offering regular courses in SF in the early 1960s (see Hillegas), and academic presses began featuring studies specifically of science fiction— as opposed to utopian literature, the imaginary voyage, fiction anthologies with critical commentary, or works on major authors such as H. G. Wells—in the 1970s (see Ketterer; Rose; and Philmus, Unknown). In the early decades of its existence, SF studies was under significant critical and institutional pressure to both delimit and legitimate its subject matter. As Robert Philmus remarked in 1973, in the very first issue of the journal Science Fiction Studies: “Generic names must mean something. The problem SF poses in this regard is that its name... does not in itself and by convention evoke the ‘shape’ and iden­ tity of what it designates; and because it does not, what sciencefiction designates must be identified—that is, stipulated” (“Shape” 37; emphasis in original). Moreover, as Edward\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nJames points out in his survey of early SF criticism, the process of devising definitions and constructing a historical canon tended to function to “giv[e] modern SF writers a respectable ancestry” and thus “greater respectability in the halls of academe” (32-33). The signal accomplishment of these initial decades, in terms of scope and influence, was unquestionably Darko Suvin’s Metamorphoses ofScience Fiction (1979). Suvin’s def­ inition of SF as “a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the pres­ ence and interaction of estrangement and cognition\" (7-8; emphasis in original); his claim that this estrangement was achieved primarily through “the narrative dominance or hegemony of a fictional ‘novum’ (novelty, innovation) validated by cognitive logic\" (63; emphasis in original); and his historical conspectus tracing the genre’s origins to Thomas More’s Utopia (1516) and Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver Travels (1726) enshrined a very specific and compelling vision of SF: it was a literary form that functioned to defamiliarize, critique, and/or satirize present-day reality through the projection of alterna­ tive worlds, an effect accomplished through the mobilization of both technoscientific methods (“cognitive logic”) and objects (“fictional novum[s]’”). Suvin’s conception had the virtue of rigor and clarity, its epochal intervention registered by the rampant italics he used throughout the book to underline his key ideas. Yet it was also, as sev­ eral critics have pointed out, narrowly prescriptive and sociopolitically tendentious. In the words of Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr., “[m]any of SF’s most typical novums [such as time machines] are only ostensibly scientifically rational” (73), and Patrick Parrinder has observed that Suvin’s central assumption that true SF must necessarily be socially critical “turns the text’s function of‘commenting on the author’s collective context’ into the measure of aesthetic achievement” (47). Surely, there is something curious about a definition of SF that, by Suvin’s own admission, rules out the vast majority of texts pub­ lished and consumed as such—especially the American magazine tradition—as insuf­ ficiently cognitive, or insufficiently estranging, or both. Despite its shortcomings, Suvin’s definition of the genre has exerted an enormous influence on subsequent critics, and there can be little doubt that the Suvinian model has produced trenchant and compelling studies of the work of authors such as Wells, Stanislaw Lem, Karel Capek, and Ursula K. Le Guin, among others. But as this list sug­ gests, the canon it has generated has been a fairly narrow one, often unapologetically so. In his book Critical Theory and Science Fiction (2000), Carl Freedman, Suvin’s most significant contemporary follower, asserted that the pulp tradition was an unfortu­ nate distraction from the main line of true SF, which descended from the classical uto­ pia through Wells to major “literary” writers such as Le Guin and Samuel R. Delany, and that the ongoing legacy of pulp SF “continues to obscure the critical vitality of the genre” (90). This vitality lay in science fiction’s ability to “foreground and demystify the actual, and thereby to point to some authentic plenitude with which the deprivations of mundane reality are contrasted” (72); works that failed to accomplish this heady mis­ sion were necessarily inferior, if they even deserved the name of “science fiction” at all. For his part, Suvin had called pulp SF a “misshapen subgenre,” more or less indistin­ guishable from “supernatural or occult fantasy,” whose perpetuation and popularity were merely “the result of an ideological or commercial habit” (68).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nYet another consequence of the dominance of Suvin’s approach in the early decades of academic SF studies was a general neglect of science fiction in other media. In his award-winning essay “Kubrick’s 2001 and the Possibility of a Science-Fiction Cinema,” Freedman argued that SF film was essentially impossible given the dominance of spe­ cial effects over “literary quality” within the medium, especially its Hollywood incar­ nation. Indeed, only those rare films that managed to sustain “a close alliance ... to literary science fiction” achieved anything like the “critical and oppositional potential” of which the genre was capable (312). In short, SF films substituted technological spec­ tacle for genuine cognitive estrangement. The journal Suvin co-edited, Science Fiction Studies, generally scanted coverage of film, television, and other forms of mass-media SF in its early years, the title of its November 1980 special issue, “Science Fiction and the Non-Print Media” (published the year that Suvin stepped down from the edito­ rial board), only serving to underscore this omission with a belated effort at inclusion. Even the articles in this special issue, as the lead editorial proclaimed, functioned “to ‘demythologize’ . . . the images the visual media present us with” (“Editorial” 246), rather than seeing those images as themselves authentic vehicles of demythologiza­ tion, as the novums of literary SF would be. A significant result of this marginalization of nonprint science fiction was that a separate discourse about SF film, more or less segregated from SF studies proper, developed within the discipline of cinema studies, beginning in 1980 with Vivian Sobchack’s pioneering study The Limits of Infinity: The American Science Fiction Film, 1950-1975 and continuing with Constance Penley’s 1986 special issue of Camera Obscura on “Science Fiction and Sexual Difference” (eventually published as Close Encounters: Film, Feminism, and Science Fiction in 1991). A few crit­ ics attempted to bridge this divide—for example, Brooks Landon, who asserted in 1992 that “to expect SF films... to pursue only the same goals as does SF literature is... criti­ cally narrow-minded” (Aesthetics 8)—but they were decidedly in the minority. It was not until 2008 that a journal devoted specifically to Science Fiction Film and Television would appear (though Science Fiction Studies did, especially after 1990, become more catholic in its coverage of mass-media SF). The critical hegemony of the Suvinian paradigm began to be effectively challenged by the rise of cultural-studies perspectives in the 1980s and 1990s. Less concerned with normative definitions and literary canons than with the varying and contra­ dictory ways that the genre had been configured at particular historical moments, cultural-studies scholarship tended to see SF as in constant dialogue with other forms of cultural production, as well as with unfolding events in social and politi­ cal history. More specifically, cultural-studies work focused on connections between the genre and the many formal and informal discourses that made up nineteenthand twentieth-century “technoculture”—that complex of institutions and atti­ tudes, predictions and inventions linking high-tech research with popular culture. Technoculture studies brought together issues and contexts related to the indus­ trial production, textual refraction, and sociopolitical deployment of technological advances; and SF had a central place within this corpus, given its longstanding history of tracking the futuristic fallout of technoscientific “progress.” As a form of literature\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndevoted, in large part, to evoking the potential futures and possible worlds engendered by mechanical innovation, SF emerged, so these critics claimed, as the preeminent site within Euro-American popular culture, where the vast social impact of modern tech­ nology could be creatively explored and critically interrogated. Important works in the cultural study of SF powerfully displayed the genre’s unpar­ alleled capacity to illuminate the technological culture that had radically transformed modern life. H. Bruce Franklin’s War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination (1988), for example, showed how the technophilic perspectives of classic pulp SF converged with the imperatives of the militarist state to sanction the high-tech warfare of the postwar atomic age. Similarly, Andrew Ross’s Strange Weather: Culture, Science and Technology in the Age of Limits (1991) analyzed the implication of SF in two key events in the history of modern technoculture—the “enlightened technocracy” movement of the 1920s, with which early SF was affiliated through the career of sci­ ence popularizer Hugo Gernsback (editor of the first SF pulp, Amazing Stories), and the computer counterculture of the 1980s, which cyberpunk SF both championed and cri­ tiqued. Indeed, cyberpunk and its affiliated cybercultures were at the center of much of this early cultural-studies work. Scott Bukatman’s Terminal Identity: The Virtual Subject in Postmodern Science Fiction (1993), for example, argued for cyberpunk as a quintessential postmodern genre, defining it broadly enough to include not only print SF by the likes of William Gibson but also films, graphic novels, and even theme parks. And N. Katherine Hayles’s How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics (1999) showed how major SF texts since the 1950s—including the work of cyberpunk authors such as William Gibson—had participated, along with postwar cybernetics theory and recent innovations in artificial intelligence and artifi­ cial life research, in formulating a “posthumanist” cultural paradigm. This spate offresh critical-historical work, emanating largely from scholars ofAmerican studies, visual culture studies, and science and technology studies, may seem to have developed in relative isolation from the tradition of classical SF studies pioneered by Suvin (only Bukatman and Hayles mention his work, in passing). Yet both schools are deeply rooted in Western Marxist thought, though their specific debts and therefore critical emphases vary. Where Suvin adapted Brechtian ideals of estrangement and Ernst Bloch’s notion of the utopian novum, cultural-studies theorists returned to the Gramscian con­ cept of hegemony and the critiques of popular culture pioneered by Raymond Williams and the Birmingham School. What made the late 1980s and early 1990s a turning point in SF criticism was what appeared at the time to be the signal accomplishment of cyber­ punk, which emerged as a trenchant form of postmodern discourse that offered compel­ ling futuristic visions of the intersection of corporate power and global technoculture. Fredric Jameson, for example, called the subgenre “the supreme literary expression, if not of postmodernism, then of late capitalism itself” (418 ni; emphasis in original). In 1988 the Mississippi Review released a special issue on cyberpunk edited by Larry McCaffery, which was eventually published in book form as Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Fiction (1992) and featured the work of a new generation of SF scholars such as Csicsery-Ronay, Landon, David Porush, and Veronica Hollinger.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nWhen Csicsery-Ronay and Hollinger joined the new editorial board of Science Fiction Studies in 1991 (along with Arthur B. Evans and Richard D. Mullen, who had originally founded the journal), the transition away from the Suvinian paradigm seemed complete. Yet there was still significant shared ground thanks to their mutual roots in Marxist critical theory, and the cultural study of SF came to adopt, in modi­ fied form, some of Suvin’s key ideas—in particular, his emphasis on the centrality of an estranging novum linked to technoscientific development (see Csicsery-Ronay 47-75)—while shedding the more problematic baggage of formalist genre studies, espe­ cially its inclination to construct narrow and exclusionary canons. Moreover, contra Suvin, for whom works of science fiction were either cognitively estranging and there­ fore socially critical or else reactionary deformations, technoculturally oriented SF studies operated with an understanding that SF can be at once critical of and complicit with the technological culture with which it is inextricably entwined. The development of SF criticism since the 1990s is thus marked by both rupture and continuity, yet technoculture studies has clearly made possible significant new ways of understanding the history of SF. Roger Luckhurst’s 2005 “cultural history,” for example, melds an internal survey of the genre’s characteristic institutions and textual strategies with an external focus on the cultural politics of technological development; indeed, the chief accomplishment of his book is to render such facile inside-outside distinctions moot, since a genuine cultural history requires meticulous attention to both genre adaptation and technosocial transformation. Luckhurst’s book shares with the aforementioned works of Franklin, Bukatman, Ross, and Hayles a perspective that persistently moves past the borders of genre to trace larger systems of meaning-making in which technology has a central—if not preeminent—place. While Luckhurst’s focus remains largely on SF literature, technocultural studies of SF have often had a multimedia orientation, breaking the stranglehold on literary studies that had marked the discipline for its first two decades. As noted above, Bukatman’s book found examples of cyberpunk in texts ranging from the film TRON (1982) and the TV movie Max Headroom: Twenty Minutes into the Future (1985) to Howard Chaykin’s comic book American Flagg! (1983-88) and Disney’s Tomorrowland. And recent works of refer­ ence in the field have taken note of this shift, with The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction (2009), edited by Mark Bould et al., featuring chapters not just on SF literature, but on film, television, and comics—even a chapter “SF Tourism” by Landon. Indeed, if the problem for SF studies in the 1970s was to establish what counts as science fiction, the problem today is to determine what does not count as science fic­ tion. The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction takes up this critical challenge, attempt­ ing to descry the historical and cultural contours of SF in the wake of technoculture studies. Rather than treating the genre as an isolated aesthetic formation, it examines SF’s many lines of cross-pollination with technocultural realities since its inception in the nineteenth century, showing how SF’s unique history and subcultural identity have been constructed in ongoing dialogue with popular discourses of science and technology. Moreover, the scope of what qualifies as science fiction is also expansive, encompassing not only literary texts but also speculative technocultural work in a\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwide range of media. The scope of SF’s sociocultural influence has never been greater, almost keeping pace with the magnitude of technological change itself. As cyber­ punk author Bruce Sterling pointed out in 1986, his generation was the first “to grow up in ... a truly science-fictional world”; as a result, “the techniques of classical ‘hard SF’—extrapolation, technological literacy—are not just literary tools, but an aid to daily life” (xi). This Handbook acknowledges this extraordinary explosion and prolif­ eration of science-fictional texts and modalities, which have made SF today less a genre than a way of being in the world. As Landon puts it, SF is now “the new realism of technological society,” a “meta-genre so broad and so pervasive as to be a concept and force quite outside the boundaries of fiction, and of art itself” (Science Fiction xiii). In Csicsery-Ronay’s words, “science-fictionality” has becomes nothing less than “a way of thinking about the world” (ix). This volume consists of four broadly themed parts, each divided into eleven chap­ ters. Part I, “Science Fiction as Genre,” considers the internal history of SF literature, examining its characteristic aesthetic and ideological modalities, its animating social and commercial institutions, and its relationship to other fantastic genres. Part II, “Science Fiction as Medium,” presents a more diverse and ramified understanding of what constitutes the field as a mode of artistic and pop-cultural expression, canvassing extra-literary manifestations of SF ranging from film and television to video games and hypertext to music and theme parks. Part III, “Science Fiction as Culture,” examines the genre in relation to cultural issues and contexts that have influenced it and been influenced by it in turn, the goal being to see how SF has helped to constitute and define important (sub)cultural groupings, social movements, and historical developments during the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Finally, Part IV, “Science Fiction as Worldview,” explores SF as a mode of thought and its intersection with other philosophies and large-scale perspectives on the world, from the Enlightenment to the present day. The topics covered in these four parts are designed to be exemplary rather than exhaustive, treating a selective but significant array of issues that, taken altogether, communicate a rich sense of SF as a literary, artistic, pop-cultural, social, and ideological formation. In other words, this is not a comprehensive work of reference designed to survey the field systematically or to summarize consensus views. The chapters do have some overview function, and their range is designed to present a representative sample of relevant topics in the four areas covered; but their purpose is generally more argumen­ tative than expository, seeking to intervene in current debates and to broaden the scope of what usually counts as science fiction. While each chapter is designed to stand on its own, there is inevitable overlap among them in terms of contextual information pre­ sented and specific texts cited. The overall effect, I hope, is to convey a strong sense of the heterogenous discourses and debates, histories and cultures, that have gone to make science fiction, broadly conceived, what it is today. Part I opens with Brooks Landon’s careful anatomy of two key terms in SF critical discourse: extrapolation and speculation. The former is generally seen as indexing the genre’s predictive capacity, while the latter is taken to refer to its more visionary\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\ntendencies; in other words, they are two contrasting ways of understanding the essen­ tial narrative logic of the genre. Yet, as Landon shows, the actual evolution of these ideas within SF discourse has been considerably more confused and contradictory, with critics sometimes conflating the terms while at other times seeing one as a deri­ vation or subset of the other. These critical peregrinations, Landon argues, have been linked to shifts in the relative status of scientific “plausibility” and thus to debates over the centrality of science itself to an understanding of the genre. The second chapter, by Peter Stockwell, moves from debates over the ideological function of SF narratives to a focus on their aesthetic modalities. SF, Stockwell asserts, has been traditionally associ­ ated with the sublime due to its vaunted appeal to the reader’s “sense of wonder”—an association that has damaged the genre’s critical standing given the influence of Kant’s disparagement of the category of the sublime in favor of the beautiful. Stockwell turns to recent work in the area of cognitive aesthetics in order to recast the way SF’s artistic value is understood, ultimately seeing SF as an “immersive” literature whose linguistic and narratological allure lies in placing the reader in “a position of assumed familiarity with the imagined world.” Just as Landon and Stockwell take issue with prevailing critical models for under­ standing SF’s narrative operations, so Arthur B. Evans contests some of the ways its history has traditionally been constructed. Evans presents a three-stage history of SF historiography that, in its final two stages, roughly correlates with the distinction drawn in this Introduction between a genre-studies model and a cultural-studies model; before 1970 (during the prehistory of academic SF criticism per se), histories tended to focus on authors or themes, at which point there was a shift to more “semi­ otic” approaches devoted to analyzing the characteristic “protocols” of the genre, fol­ lowed by a move toward “sociological” histories that viewed SF as an expression of prevailing sociocultural trends. Cutting across these divisions were the “origin stories” that SF historians told about the roots and evolution of the genre; again tallying with claims made in this Introduction, Evans shows how earlier SF histories—produced during the period of the genre’s academic legitimation—devoted a significant portion of their attention to prestigious British ancestors such as Shelley and Wells, whereas more recent histories have focused on the legacy of the American pulp genre during the twentieth century and after. Gary K. Wolfe’s chapter builds on Evans by analyzing the consolidation of a conventional view of SF history as a series of literary movements— the hard SF of the 1940s, the 1960s New Wave, cyberpunk in the 1980s, and so on. Yet these movements were not all of a piece: some were genuine alliances of editors and authors with a common purpose, whereas others were more amorphous groupings or even retrospective projections. The next two chapters, by Farah Mendlesohn and Gary Westfahl, focus on two important institutions supporting SF as a commercial genre: fandom and the literary marketplace. Mendlesohn gives a sense of the global scope of SF fandom, as well as the complex bureaucracy that has evolved to sustain its plethora of conventions, pub­ lications, and awards, ultimately arguing for fandom as a “knowledge economy” that privileges seniority of experience as a way of nurturing institutional memory. For his\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\npart, Westfahl shows how US science fiction, despite developing within a strong mar­ ket milieu, has always spawned authors and editors who chafed at prevailing com­ mercial norms for SF storytelling, pushing for innovation and diversity in a context where market pressures tended toward the crystallization of repeatable formulas. In Westfahl’s view, this struggle has been settled definitively in favor of the market­ place, and “authors still striving to produce provocative, original science fiction ... are becoming a disregarded minority, with little impact on the genre.” Following this pair of chapters are three that discuss dominant modalities of generic expression. Jess Nevins argues that “pulp SF” is actually a more capacious cat­ egory than has traditionally been assumed, encompassing not merely work in mag­ azines specifically designated as “science fiction” but also a vast amount of material published in the general pulps; if the latter were taken into account to a greater degree by critics and historians, pulp SF would be viewed in a considerably different light, seen as more pessimistic in its treatment of technoscientific topics and more complex in its depiction of women and nonwhite characters. Joan Gordon analyzes the devel­ opment of “literary” science fiction into three main groupings: SF that foregrounds the specific aesthetic qualities characteristic of the genre, SF that mimics some of the styles of writing of the literary mainstream, and SF that prominently alludes to works of canonical literature. All three approaches, she suggests, are converging in an era of rampant technological change and saturation. Victoria de Zwaan’s chapter addresses the “postmodernization” of SF during the cyberpunk era, showing how Bruce Sterling’s category of “slipstream,” while theoretically incoherent, continues to appeal to critics as a way of registering the ongoing hybridization between SF and experimental writing. The final two chapters in Part I serve to unsettle the category of science fiction itself, opening our understanding of the genre to a range of literary techniques and cul­ tural manifestations. Brian Attebery demonstrates how SF has always had a strong— if uneasy—relationship with fantasy, with many of its most characteristic narrative devices, from time machines to faster-than-light travel, having little warrant in actu­ ally existing science. As Attebery observes, this intermingling with fantasy renders problematic some of the core assumptions of Suvinian genre theory, which draws a sharp line between these forms; the “incursion of the fantastic” into an SF text com­ plicates the status of science fiction as “a vector for disseminating scientific ideas or as a mode of social critique.” Attebery proposes replacing conventional genre theory, concerned as it is with the clear demarcation of borders, with a more fluid sense of SF as a spectrum of possibilities characterized by the varying intensity of the copres­ ence of fantastic elements. Veronica Hollinger goes further, arguing that SF perhaps no longer deserves to be seen as a genre at all; instead, it may now be a mode, a method of “thinking and speaking about contemporary reality so that SF becomes integrated with other discourses about late-capitalist global technoculture.” Echoing the general perspectives of this Handbook, Hollinger claims that the traditional view of SF as a settled genre formation has become increasingly untenable as “contemporary reality and science fiction have become inextricably bound up with each other.”\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nHollinger’s argument, positioned at the end of the first part, opens the critical con­ versation to include the media modalities in which SF finds expression, which is the subject of the chapters in Part II. The chapters proceed from more familiar media forms of SF, such as film and television, which already have fairly well-developed critical dis­ courses surrounding them, to forms that have long been recognized as having a signifi­ cant relationship with the genre—such as comics and video games—but have not been extensively treated in the extant scholarship, to forms that have seldom been considered in relation to SF at all, such as music, performance art, and architecture. Mark Bould’s chapter on film addresses the continuing marginalization of mass-media forms in SF studies, seeing this as a legacy of the academic legitimation crisis of the discipline’s early decades. Yet he also shows the limitations of a genre-based model in general, even in SF film studies: the “purifying, categorizing impulse” it expresses is inadequate to grapple with the “fluid and tenuous discursive constructions” most films are, especially today. In particular, the distinction between cognition and affect—so central to Suvin’s model and to understandings of the distinctions between SF and horror film—needs to be rethought in an era when special effects may have complex ways of addressing view­ ers, encoding significant critical information. J. P. Telotte’s chapter on radio and televi­ sion sets a pattern for a number of the chapters to come, showing how these media were not peripheral but central to twentieth-century SF history. Citing pulp pioneer Hugo Gernsback’s career as a popularizer of radio technology, Telotte argues that these “new, science-fictional media would not only provide powerful platforms for staging tales of scientific imagination, but also forms that would, self-consciously, draw the media into their exploring and contesting of the genre’s nature.” Paul Wells pursues a similar argument, seeing animation as a “thick text” whose technocultural elements have an inherently science-fictional quality. Historically, ani­ mation functioned as “a new way of seeing, a modern engagement with the simultane­ ity of the emergence of new science and technology with fresh codes and conditions of visual interpretation.” Its affective tone of “enchanted rapture” made it uniquely suited to serve as a kind of self-reflexive embodiment of SF’s mission to chronicle the experiential effects of change, from Segundo de Chomon’s use of stop-motion techniques to depict “the magical technologies of electrically imbued objects” to Pixar Studios’ deployment of CGI to register the wonder of “scientific and technological interfaces with human cre­ ativity.” Jerome Winter’s chapter points to the paucity of serious scholarship on SF art and illustration, “not simply as a supplement to the history of SF literature, but as a signif­ icant shaper of the image culture of twentieth-century technological modernity.” Winter analyzes the impact of SF visual art—in a number of formats, including pulp magazine covers, film promotional art, album sleeve design, and digital illustration—in helping to shape modern technocultural consciousness in ways that have been arguably more per­ vasive and influential than the impact of SF literature itself. Similarly, Corey Creekmur’s chapter essays an “alternative history” of science fiction in which comic strips and comic books are accorded a more central place, in terms of both the sheer quantity of their output and their enormous and ongoing popularity (not to mention their outsized influence, in recent years, on other forms of SF media). For example, the figure of Buck\n\nIO\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRogers, incubated in the SF pulp Amazing Stories, went on to have a long career in news­ paper (and subsequently film) serialization, doing more to disseminate science-fictional imagery among a mass audience than the specialized SF magazine culture that spawned him. Creekmur considers more contemporary examples as well, from Osamu Tezuka’s wildly popular manga Astro Boy (1952-68) to more sophisticated graphic novels such as Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson’s Transmetropolitan (1997-2002). Three pairs of chapters follow, examining SF in digital media (video games, digi­ tal arts and hypertext), performance-based media (music, performance art), and media of the built environment (architecture, theme parks). Pawel Frelik’s chapter on video games continues the argument for moving forms of visuality to the center of SF critical discourse; indeed, it makes an ambitious argument seeking to displace the presumed superiority of print SF in mediating the genre’s key strengths (such as the depiction of alternative worlds or the critique of present-day reality), which, Frelik claims, visual-culture modes of expression can display just as—if not more—power­ fully. Moreover, the close historical connection between the medium and SF themes and ideas—one of the earliest video games was Spacewar! (1962), which was adapted into the first arcade game Computer Space (1971)—has ensured that SF video games would not suffer the relative marginalization that SF has in other media, including visual media such as film and television, thus allowing it to become one of the prime vehicles for popular experiences (and understandings) of technological interactivity and simulation. James Tobias finds a similar connection between medium and SF in the representational and haptic strategies of digital textuality: both are “allegorical indexjes] of technocultural change” that operate across a spectrum from the utopian to the dystopian. Tobias analyzes the “discursive performativities of utopian program-asnarrative” in a range of digital forms, from hypertexts to museum installations to web-based narratives, identifying potent critiques of instrumentalized technoscientific agency in the ludic power of their interfaces. John Cline’s chapter expands the scope of what counts as “science fiction music” from SF film soundtracks, which are already the subject of some scholarship, to criti­ cally neglected forms such as popular songs whose lyrics express SF themes, as well as musical instruments—in particular, the Theremin and other electronic modalities— whose technological substrate makes them inherently science-fictional. Like prevail­ ing treatments of SF music, scholarship on performance art within technocultural SF studies is rather skewed, with certain key figures—such as Stelarc or Orlan—tending to be highlighted due to the science-fictional nature of their cyborg personae, at the expense of a more wide-ranging consideration of the links between the medium and SF. While providing insightful commentary on the careers of these two artists, Steve Dixon’s chapter goes further, arguing for an intimate aesthetic and ideological con­ nection: performance art “inhabits an interesting, tension-filled liminal space that is precisely sciencefiction. This space, like popular SF notions of outer space, mixes a real­ ity of the known here-and-now with a ‘will’ to the unknown, the alien, and the future” (emphasis in original). The ritualized and affecting technocultural spectacles in SF performance art, Dixon asserts, especially those of cyborgized bodies and machinic\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\ntransformations, powerfully activate the cognitive estrangement Suvin locates at the heart of the genre. Nic Clears chapter on architecture is similar to Cline’s on music and Dixon’s on performance art in that all three seek to shift the focus from a finding of SF themes in the medium to a consideration of the medium’s inherent science-fictionality. Like Dixon, Clear borrows a key concept from Suvin—“the novum”—to explain the aesthetic and ideological power of architectural novelties, ranging from the ambi­ tious utopian technoscapes of Futurism and Constructivism to the more playful Pop visions of the Archigram Group. Clear provocatively claims that contemporary science-fictional architecture—including the “liquid architectures” of cyberspace— operates as a compelling critique of the profession’s entrenched technocratic corpo­ ratism. By contrast, Leonie Cooper finds, even in the most corporate of architectural forms, the Disney theme parks, a series of “transitional spaces” and “ambiguous zones” whose liminality allows a “science-fictional mode of engagement” with the popular imaginary of the future. In short, the theme park “can become a kind of prophetic tool for forecasting a future that is already predestined by its simulations, or it can become evidence that the future must be imagined in ways other than how it has already been imagineered by theme-park designers.” Cooper’s chapter, with its consideration of the theme park as a cultural as well as a medium-specific form, could readily have been included in Part III of this Handbook, “Science Fiction as Culture,” which canvasses cultural phenomena or formations that have a clear relationship with SF and/or a strong science-fictional component. Taken overall, the chapters convey a sense of the range of ways that cultural values and prac­ tices have been informed or inflected by modern technoscience. As Sherryl Vint points out in her chapter on the culture of science, the “staying power of the term ‘science fic­ tion,’ which stubbornly resisted displacement by the more evocative and perhaps more accurate ‘speculative fiction,’ suggests that something about the culture of science remains at the genre’s core” (emphasis in original). She examines not only the pres­ ence of SF in scientific culture but also the genre’s role in mediating “science” as an institution or a set of ideas to the public at large, as well as the influence of scientis­ tic assumptions on the theorization of SF’s narrative dynamics by, for example, Darko Suvin. Deploying perspectives from the sociology of science, Vint argues for SF as “a supplement to the official discourses of science,” registering the ways in which tech­ noscience, rather than being the disinterested intellectual pursuit one might imagine it to be, is always encountered precisely in and as a cultural form, saturated with cul­ tural assumptions and values. Roger Luckhurst’s chapter on the culture of automation provides a case study of Vint’s basic claims, exploring the ways that forms of industrial and cybernetic automation encoded a technocratic worldview with effects not only on the kinds of SF stories that could be told but also on popular modes of self-understanding and ways of life. Luckhurst excavates a prehistory of modern automation in the eighteenth-century culture of clockwork automata and in the nineteenth-century Industrial Revolution, attending at once to their cultural fallout and their crystalliza­ tion in early SF texts. Just as Wells’s The Time Machine (1895), with its degeneration of the human race into two starkly opposed classes, is an allegory of the long-term effects\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nof automated routines of industrial production and consumption, so in the twentieth century the Terminator films (1984,1991,2003) explore the dire prospects of cybernetic automation systems that reduce human agency to a mere feedback process. The next two chapters examine a particular post-World War II technocultural com­ plex that has had a profound impact on the SF genre but whose dissemination to the public at large has also been deeply science-fictional. Steffen Hantke’s chapter studies the reciprocal militarization of SF and science-fictionalization of military culture, par­ ticularly in the postwar period, which produced both a popular sci-fi movie called Star Wars (1977) and a system of nuclear deterrence—the Strategic Defense Initiative—that was popularly dubbed with the same moniker. As Hantke demonstrates, the sheer vol­ ume of the US defense budget during these decades inevitably impacted public culture in significant ways, making it more or less “explicitly militaristic” (emphasis in original). As a result, military imagery and values became “an indispensable part of the national imaginary,” manifesting in a range of media, from films and television programs to first-person shooter video games. David Seed likewise shows the cultural ramifications of atomic technology and the “space race” during the immediate postwar decades, in familiar SF novels and films but also in comics, animation, and popular music that is relatively obscure today. Since postwar technoscientific achievements in these areas had been prefigured in the SF pulps decades earlier, a major consequence of their realization was to usher the genre “[fjrom a place of cultural marginality” to “a central position ... as a source of fictional and cinematic representations.” Gregory L. Reece’s chapter explores some of the subcultural effects of this postwar technocratic regime in the rise of cult belief systems with a strong science-fictional flavor, from the writings of UFO contactées to fringe religions such as the Heaven’s Gate and Raëlian movements. The phenomenon with the deepest genre roots was clearly Dianetics (later the Church of Scientology), which was founded by erstwhile pulp SF writer L. Ron Hubbard. A focus on the cross-over traffic between mainstream culture and marginal subcul­ tures marks a number of the remaining chapters in this part. Jonathan M. Woodham’s chapter on midcentury advertising and design positions itself at the interface between pulp and mass imagery, showing how science-fictional iconography and themes were absorbed into mainstream marketing culture through the mediation of popular spectacles like GM’s Motoroma, Futurama, and Kitchens of Tomorrow exhibitions, “powerful three-dimensional futuristic advertisements that consumers likened to a science-fictional world depicting new concepts of domestic lifestyles, interior spaces, and technology.” While a few rare SF novels—most famously, Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth’s The Space Merchants (1953)—commented satirically on the metastasiz­ ing of this marketing culture, the vast amount of traffic went in the opposite direction, with the genre pouring its image repertoire into the popular consciousness in the form of “science-fictional stylings” and language (for example, Dynaflow, Thermopane) that evoked a future of easeful leisure and mechanized abundance. It is precisely this vision of the future against which postwar countercultures such as the Beats and hippies, which I treat in my chapter, rebelled. These countercultures, as I show, drew upon a dif­ ferent set of genre resources for their inspiration, specifically the social utopianism of\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nSF texts and SF fans’ sense of possessing a privileged form of subcultural insight. Just as avid fans divide the social world between a small corps of foresightful SF readers and a stolid mass of “mundanes” trapped in consensus “reality,” so the Beats and hippies per­ ceived a “split between enlightened hipsters and blinkered ‘squares.’ ” My chapter reads how this division is figured in two bodies of work—the SF-inflected stories and poems of the 1950s Beat writers and the early-i96os craze for “beatnik SF” stories—as well as the legacy it has left for later forms of countercultural expression, whether within the genre (for example, Samuel R. Delany’s 1966 novel Babel-17 futuristically allegorizing the hip-square dichotomy) or outside it (for example, hippie religions drawing inspira­ tion from SF works like Robert A. Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land [1961]). The next two chapters delve into (sub)cultural identities and practices that feature complex dialectics of embodiment and science-fictionality. Patricia Melzer’s chap­ ter on sexuality examines the way traditional SF stories, rife with heteronormative assumptions and attitudes, were transformed by the advent of gay liberation, leading both to the growing inclusion on nonstraight characters in SF texts and to the estab­ lishment of institutions, such as the fan-based Gaylactic Network, that work within the genre to promote awareness about LGBT issues. Yet Melzer also shows the many ways in which traditional SF, though on the surface seemingly chaste, was actually perme­ ated with sexual themes and topics, from Gernsback’s postpulp career as a popularizer of sexology to Heinlein’s occasional depictions of futuristic polyamory. Melzer traces in detail the ways that science fiction has borrowed ideas from “scientific” theories of gender and sexuality, while at the same time, in its projections of radical alterity, “destabiliz[ing] the naturalization of knowledge about bodies and desires produced by the natural sciences as well as by sexology and psychoanalysis.” Ross Farnell’s chapter explores the recent mainstreaming of body-modification practices, once the province of subcultures such as modern primitivism and S/M fetishism, via reconceptualiza­ tions of the body that have deep roots in SF—especially “the transgressive aesthetics and ideologies of cyberpunk and the cyborg, which have moved from the page to the catwalk and piercing parlor.” The availability of the body for radical self-fashioning, a malleable surface for futuristic inscription and even surgical alteration, has been a theme of SF since at least Wells’s The Island of Dr. Moreau (1897), but it reached a peak of intensity in the work of cyberpunk authors during the 1980s. For example, Bruce Sterling’s popular “Shaper-Mechanist” series extrapolates divergent posthuman futures, one involving the genetic reconfiguration of the body and the other its pros­ thetic augmentation, the latter in particular having significant overlap with contempo­ rary practices of neotribalist self-surgery. What cyberpunk SF and body-modification subcultures also share, in Farnell’s view, is an uneasy yet complicit relationship with a commodified mainstream technoculture that has been progressively pushed into the most intimate reaches of the embodied self. Thomas Foster scrutinizes the other half of cyberpunk’s mind-body dualism in his chapter on cyberculture. On the one hand, he shows how cyberpunk’s fantasies of dis­ embodiment and prosthetic agency are rooted in the perspectives of the postwar cyber­ netics movement, especially its vision of living organisms as informational machines\n\n14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwith indefinite borders; on the other hand, he shows how cyberpunk’s extrapolations of cybernetic ideas have been folded back into contemporary cyberculture, leading to innovations in computer interface design. The final chapter in Part III looks at an off­ shoot of cyberpunk, steampunk, and its relationship to the larger cultural phenomenon of retrofuturism, both of which reflect “current dissatisfaction with the present while creating a nostalgia for what we once considered the future.” As Elizabeth Guffey and Kate C. Lemay demonstrate, the optimism of midcentury technoculture, as expressed not only in the SF produced during the period but also in mainstream cultural phe­ nomena such as the space age design canvassed in Woodham’s chapter, has become an object of both fascination and skeptical reconsideration within retrofuturist subcul­ tures. The most emblematic of these is steampunk, which began as an SF subgenre and has morphed into a lifestyle movement that bypasses twentieth-century technoculture in favor of earlier forms of technology more amenable to a culture of “tinkering.” Yet for all their quirky earnestness, “most retrofuturism and steampunk forms contain an ironic note, lending the entire genre a kind of subversive power.” Guffey and Lemay’s chapter straddles the divide between Parts III and IV, focusing on both an SF subculture (steampunk) and its animating perspective on the world (ret­ rofuturism). Of course, the division between culture and worldview (like that between medium and culture, which separates the chapters in Parts II and III) is essentially artificial, since cultures are shot through with ideologies and ideologies manifest themselves as cultural forms. Part IV, entitled “Science Fiction as Worldview,” offers critical assessments of the science-fictional qualities of n ideological systems, as well as analyses of the impact of these systems on the development of SF itself. Just as Part III endeavors to provide a sense of just how thoroughly twentieth-century cultural for­ mations have been science-fictionalized, so the overall goal of Part IV is to convey an appreciation for the deep penetration of SF ideas and values into some of the major forms of thought characteristic of the modern period, broadly construed. The first two chapters, by Adam Roberts and William Hughes, address the Enlightenment and the Gothic, respectively—two seemingly opposed worldviews that nonetheless drew upon proto-SF discourses and had a significant influence upon the subsequent evolu­ tion of the genre. Obviously, the Enlightenment’s notion of the emancipatory power of reason and scientific knowledge has deeply informed modern SF, but, as Roberts shows, Enlightenment thinkers often had recourse to SF themes of cosmic voyaging and vertiginous shiftings of scale, as in Voltaire’s “Micromegas” (1752), a satirical story of first contact between benighted Earthmen and the eponymous alien philosopher, a gigantic being of unfathomably enlightened understanding. For his part, Hughes shows how the worldview of Gothic fiction, though considerably darker in tone than that produced by Enlightenment philosophes, was still complexly entangled with the emergent SF genre. Indeed, according to Hughes, the Gothic and SF share a close tex­ tual and ideological kinship: each genre functions as “a literary laboratory, a projected experimental space that, if it does not satisfactorily claim a didactic imperative, almost invariably interrogates the limits of the human as much as those of the imaginary tech­ nological.” Starting with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), the Gothic becomes as\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nobsessed as does SF with scientific figures and practices, a concern evident in works of Victorian Gothic such as Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897), thus paving the way for modern SF-Gothic hybrids such as Richard Matheson’s I Am Legend (1954). The next three chapters also consider the subsequent careers of nineteenth-cen­ tury worldviews, perspectives ready-made for SF appropriation due to the inherently science-fictional aspect of some of their core ideas. Patrick B. Sharp’s discussion of Darwinism not only traces its clear influence on the development of science fiction, especially in the genre’s treatment of race, gender, and technology, but also discusses the science-fictionality of Darwinism itself, from the voyage of scientific discovery aboard the Beagle that helped lead to its birth to the various pseudoscientific mutations, such as eugenics, that it spawned. What Darwinism bequeathed to SF, above all, was a set of “colonial assumptions,” deeply embedded in the fabric of Victorian science, that have since become “an inseparable part of the plots, characterizations, and framing logics of the SF genre as a whole.” John Rieder’s chapter develops this connection further, build­ ing on his 2008 study Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction, which dem­ onstrated the imbrication of early SF with colonialist ideologies. Here, Reider turns his attention to postcolonial theory, showing how its themes of cultural hybridization and zones of contact at once manifest an implicitly science-fictional dynamic and read­ ily lend themselves to extrapolation in SF narratives. His chapter draws a distinction between the forms of postcolonial thought and expression—including works of SF— that engage with the histories of settler colonialism, where one culture displaces and virtually exterminates another, and dependent colonialism, where two cultures co­ exist in a hierarchy of domination and subordination. Anthony Enns, in his chapter on pseudoscience, analyzes three Victorian fringe theories—of the hollow earth, Martian canals, and extrasensory perception—that were themselves deeply science-fictional and that, perhaps not surprisingly, “migrated to science fiction after they were rejected by orthodox science.” Moreover, the modern genre itself has been a prolific incubator of pseudoscientific belief systems; indeed, as Enns shows, John W. Campbell, during the last two decades of his career as editor of Astounding Science-Fiction (later Analog), ostensibly the most hard-scientific of the SF magazines, became an avid promoter of ideas that “official science... dismisses with annoyance.” While not exactly a pseudoscience, Futurism or futurology, which is the subject of Andrew M. Butler’s chapter, is not precisely a social science either. Butler surveys the explosion of professional Futurism during the 1960s, with new think tanks such as the World Future Society and the Institute for the Future generating quasi-science-fictional forecasts of coming trends. A highly technocratic discourse, Futurism nonetheless, according to Butler, has links back to Christian eschatology, as well as obvious affinities with science fiction. The genre is indeed sometimes seen as a variant of Futurism, seek­ ing to predict the effects of social and technological change (for example, the “Future History” plotted out by Heinlein in the 1940s). Eminent popular Futurists such as Alvin Toffler recommended SF as “a kind of sociology of the future” that “has immense value as a mind stretching force for the creation of the habit of anticipation” (qtd. Butler), and historical cross-over between the two discourses has been significant (for example,\n\nl6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nArthur C. Clarke was both a major SF writer and a Futurist). Yet to conflate the two is to ignore the specifically aesthetic character of SF’s extrapolations, Butler argues, and the necessary estrangement attendant on any science-fictional depiction of futurity. Colin Milburn’s chapter on posthumanism focuses on a particular manifestation of Futurist thinking: the anticipation of an imminent transcendence of the fetters of embodied existence thanks to massive biotechnological or cybercultural advances. This vision links fringe sciences like cryonics with science fiction; indeed, as Milburn shows, the idea of immortality via cryogenic suspension was actually pioneered by a minor SF writer of the 1940s, Robert Ettinger. Milburn analyzes the rhetorical and discursive conflation of posthumanism and SF, with each plundering ideas and vocabulary from the other; echoing Hollinger, he suggests that “science fiction” today designates less a cohesive genre than a distributed “mode of discourse” that can be found equally “in literary texts, pop-science books, or futurological documentaries.” The following two chapters cover sociopolitical philosophies with strong currents of connection with SF. Lisa Yaszek’s chapter argues that “SF is naturally compatible with the project of feminism”: both are at their cores utopian discourses that outline speculative scenarios for the radical reconfiguration of social roles and relationships. Yaszek tracks the historical exchanges between these discourses over the “three waves” of feminist thought and activism since the nineteenth century, showing how feminist writers consistently turned to the resources of SF and the utopian novel to drive home their ideas, from Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s depiction of a female-only community in Herland (1915) to Shulamith Firestone’s imagination of a postbiological destiny for women in The Dialectics of Sex (1970) to Donna Haraway’s embrace of the cyborg as a progressive gender mythology in her “Cyborg Manifesto” (1985). At the same time, SF authors as diverse as Melissa Scott, Octavia E. Butler, and Geoff Ryman have been inspired by feminist insights, while Joanna Russ wrote major works of both SF and feminist criticism. Neil Easterbrook, in his chapter on libertarianism and anar­ chism, explores a similar collusion between modes of sociopolitical thought and sci­ ence fiction. Just as libertarian thinkers such as Ayn Rand have penned quasi-SF novels to espouse their ideas, so SF writers such as Heinlein and L. Neil Smith have crafted futures extrapolating ideals of unconstrained commerce and individual liberty. Since 1979 the Libertarian Futurist Society has given a Prometheus Award for SF novels that best reflect a libertarian worldview; as might be expected, the winners have been largely right-wing works, yet a handful of left-wing anarchist novels—especially those of Ken MacLeod—have also won. Easterbrook carefully distinguishes between these social philosophies, while showing their mutual imbrication in a worldview suspicious of centralized authority, an attitude that has long informed SF itself; indeed, to the extent that SF depicts “alternate futurejs] or askjs] readers to reflect on alternate presents, it is,” says Easterbrook, “oppositional by definition.” While Yaszek and Easterbrook trace dialectics linking sociopolitical worldviews and SF, De Witt Douglas Kilgore analyzes Afrofuturism as an overarching mode of thought and creative expression that includes science fiction alongside other technocultural forms, such as hip-hop and experimental jazz, that make “self-conscious\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nuse of a speculative-fictional style” in order to muse on the collective fate of the descendants of the African diaspora. Citing anthologies on black and postcolonial SF edited by Sheree R. Thomas and Nalo Hopkinson, as well as a range of SF nov­ els, Kilgore shows the long history of Afro-diasporic engagement with the genre. In Kilgore’s view, Afrofuturism deploys utopian perspectives to critique dystopian realities, locating alternative trajectories that frame the future as “complex and con­ tradictory rather than destructive.” With the recent advent of Chicano/a and indig­ enous Futurisms, it is clear, says Kilgore, that Afrofurism has become “a model for how other peoples of color might view the futuristic art they create, allowing them to become conscious of their own imbrication in a technoscientific culture and to resist erasure from the narratives it sponsors.” The utopian outlook characteristic of Afrofuturism and many of the other worldviews canvassed in this part makes it only appropriate that the volume should end with a chapter on utopianism itself. Phillip E. Wegner sees utopianism not as a mode of thought that intermingles with SF but rather as essential to the genre’s very existence; indeed, “It is precisely its utopianism that distinguishes modern science fiction both from precursor forms... and from the contemporary practices of futurology and prognostication.” Given that I have taken issue in this Introduction with the Suvinian model of literary genre studies, it is also appropriate that this book should conclude with a stout defense of Suvin’s critical legacy. According to Wegner, Suvin’s key ideas of cognitive estrangement and the novum, his quintessential features of SF as a narrative form, both necessarily depend upon a utopian worldview; the basic task of an SF text “is to give figurative form to such a dramatic break from the status quo” that a reader’s mindset is scrambled and reordered, opened to the “anticipatory illumination” of an alternative mode of being or form of social organization. Wegner shows this latent utopianism at work in both SF criticism and neo-Marxist theory, as well as in SF novels by Alfred Bester, Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, and Ken MacLeod. Despite the wide range of topics covered in this Handbook, no one is more aware than I of all that has been omitted. As noted above, the essential problem for SF studies today is to determine what does not count as science fiction, and I could easily have included chapters on SF toys, SF theater, the science-fictional qualities of portable electronic devices, the “social science fiction” movement in anthropology and sociology, the dis­ course of human-animal studies, and much more. But as I have indicated, my goal in assembling this volume was to be representative rather than exhaustive, to convey a powerful sense of how deeply science-fictional ideas and attitudes have permeated the social fabric during the past two centuries, making SF today less a fixed and coherent genre than a diverse and distributed ensemble of phenomena that resists totalization or even ready summary. In many ways, science fiction has become the master discourse of our technocultural experience, the privileged chronicler of what Csicsery-Ronay has called “the technologiade, the epic of the struggle surrounding the transformation of the cosmos into a technological regime” (217). While the cosmos this Handbook maps is a relatively modest one, I hope that it will serve to inspire future projects of critical cartography, within science fiction studies and beyond.\n\nl8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI would like to close with some brief acknowledgments and a dedication. Most obvi­ ously, I want to thank the 44 contributors, both for their prompt and gracious responses to my queries and for their tremendous patience as this book has wended its way toward completion. I am grateful to my colleagues in the English Department at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) for their unstinting support of my research on science fiction, and to Stephen Cullenberg, dean of the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, whose visionary leadership has made UCR’s Science Fiction and Technoculture Studies (SFTS) program a reality, thus giving me a home base from which to mount projects such as this. I would also like to thank my co-editors at Science Fiction Studies, several of whom contributed chapters to this book, and especially to the managing editor, Arthur B. Evans, for all his wise mentorship over the years. And I am more grateful than words can express to my indefatigable Research Assistant, Lorenzo Servitje, for the painstaking efforts he took to secure the permissions for the numerous illustrations included in this volume, and to my editor at Oxford, Brendan O’Neill, for his great patience and understanding. Finally, I would like to dedicate The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction to two cher­ ished colleagues and friends: Brooks Landon, with whom I worked for over a decade at the University of Iowa and without whose groundbreaking criticism, consistently aimed at expanding the perceived borders of our field, this book would never have been possible, and Sherryl Vint, my SFTS collaborator and comrade in arms, whose bril­ liance and diligence as a scholar have been a continuous inspiration.

The first he attributes to a Frank Stockton character who muses, “If some things were differ­ ent, other things would be otherwise” (45). The second he attributes to a character in a Punch cartoon who sadly observes, “Things might be so different if they wasn’t as they is” (45). These comments point toward two of science fiction’s most important rhetorical approaches: trying to imagine the future in terms of extrapolating from the present, in effect asking what might be “if this goes on,.and trying to imagine conditions signifi­ cantly different from those of the writer’s reality by posing the question “what if.. Davenport’s chapter title implicitly suggests that science fiction has to do with “spec­ ulation,” one of a cluster of terms largely understood as limiting the science-fictional imagination to a necessary concern with science and associating its narrative with forms of extrapolation and questions of plausibility. Accordingly, in many—if not most—of the discourses of science fiction, “extrapolation” and “speculation” are both understood as means to a crucial end: science fiction, in whatever fashion, must some­ how go beyond what is currently known and must represent the unknown through some rhetoric of “plausibility.” Plausibility, in turn, has largely been discussed in the discourse of SF in terms of the centrality of science, whether understood narrowly and monolithically or broadly and metaphorically. As is true of so many ostensible binary oppositions in the discourse of science fic­ tion, this one has been complicated by years of polemical and prescriptive construc­ tions and definitions that have so blurred distinctions between the two terms as to make them impossible of definitional clarity or even of historical recovery. Speculation has been variously discussed in contrast with extrapolation, as an extension or fur­ ther stage of extrapolation, as a category of which extrapolation is a subset, and so on.\n\n24\n\nSCIENCE FICTION AS GENRE\n\nAnd these two terms are particularly problematic, since as frequently as they are cast in opposition to each other, they are used as if they are interchangeable. For example, an overview of the genre by Lisa Yaszek suggests in its first sentence that science fiction is seen by literary and cultural historians “as the premiere narrative form of moder­ nity because authors working in this genre extrapolate from Enlightenment ideals and industrial practices to imagine how educated people using machines and other tech­ nologies might change the material world,” and then adds in her second sentence: “This kind of future-oriented technoscientific speculation lends itself to social and political speculation as well” (385). As we can see, Yaszek uses the terms interchangeably, and her comment suggests how comparison of these two nouns can be further complicated by the wide use of verb and modifier forms of each in which “speculate” or “specula­ tive,” “extrapolate” or “extrapolative” may be deployed without any necessary reference to the more bounded concepts of “speculation” and “extrapolation.” A contemporary interrogation of extrapolation and speculation as tools of scientific thinking must be understood more diachronically, as emerging from specific histori­ cal conditions and taking shape and changing over time, than as synchronic or capable of fixed, unchanging definition. It may be best to think of three different constructed relationships between the two terms. Historically, there is a line of SF thinking that opposes extrapolation to speculation, with the former term suggesting the fidelity to known and possibly even existing science and technology associated with the narra­ tives of Jules Verne and the latter suggesting the more sociologically focused and less obviously plausible narratives of H. G. Wells. Another relationship can be seen in such works as Hal Clement’s Mission of Gravity (1954), where speculation forms an initial set of “rules” as the starting point for a narrative not extrapolated from known facts, but that is then developed as rigorously as possible by extrapolating consequences from these starting “rules.” And still another, particularly found in the contemporary dis­ courses based on the idea of the Singularity, starts from extrapolation, but then claims that developments reach a point beyond which not only extrapolation but also specu­ lation is no longer possible. So, one relationship posits extrapolation and speculation as near binary opposites, roughly alignable with other binaries such as that between “hard” and “soft” SF, while the other two position them as sequential stages, one start­ ing from speculation and then becoming the baseline for extrapolation, the other start­ ing from extrapolation and leading to speculation. Both extrapolation and speculation have been understood at various times and by various writers as beginning not from a baseline scientific or sociological “reality,” but from the textual base of a preceding SF story. In this way, James Patrick Kelley’s “Think Like a Dinosaur” (1995) can be seen as a critical extrapolation from Tom Godwin’s “The Cold Equations” (1954), Karen Joy Fowlers “What I Didn’t See” (2003) can be thought of as an extrapolation from James Tiptree’s “The Women Men Don’t See” (1973), and countless artificial life stories can all be seen as extrapolations from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818). To complicate matters further still, extrapolation and speculation are popularly associated with quite different semantic registers, with extrapolation being a widely\n\nEXTRAPOLATION AND SPECULATION\n\n25\n\nused mathematical term that denotes precision and extension from the known to the unknown, while speculation is a widely used financial term, with connotations of risk, lack of firm evidence, and uncertainty. Despite widespread invocation of both terms in discussions of SF, systematic treatments are very hard to find.
