        "text": "Folks, please give a warm welcome to author J. Scott Coatsworth. We chat about what authors we’d want by our sides in difficult times, first book, and plenty more. Enjoy! Scroll to the bottom for the ebook giveaway of the M/M SciFi novel Skythane.\n\nIs there a genre or literary niche that you feel hasn’t gotten it’s deserved amount of attention?\n\nFunny that you should ask that – it’s one of the things I am bumping my head up against a wall with as we speak. I grew up reading classic sci fi – Clarke, Asimov, McCaffrey and the like. As a gay kid, I very rarely saw myself reflected in the work. So when I started writing it, I put people like me in the stories. I first found success in the MM romance market writing sci fi with gay characters (as well as a bit of fantasy and magical realism). It’s not always been a good fit – sometimes I’m a little too on the sci fi side for it to really be a romance. LOL…\n\nWith The Stark Divide, I’m back to writing what I loved as a kid – classic sci fi – but with a much more realistic mix of characters. It’s not a gay book per se. There are some gay characters, as well as some from other parts of the LGBT spectrum. But the primary driver is the story.\n\nAs I start to market the book, though, I’m finding it hard to cross over to the “mainstream” sci fi market. There are many great speculative fiction books with queer characters, but all the authors I talk to say the same thing. It’s hard to get them represented in the mainstream spec fic market.\n\nIf you could introduce one of your characters to any character from another book, who would it be and why?\n\nOooh, interesting. I think it would be Ana, the scientist most responsible for the creation of Forever, the generation ship that’s central to The Stark Divide. I would introduce her to Quince, another lesbian character who lives on Oberon, which *may* be the final destination for Forever, the gen ship. (spoiler alert). I think they’d have a lot to talk about. And Ana would totally be into Quince’s wings. 🙂\n\nIf you could, what book or movie or TV series would you like to experience for the first time all over again and why?\n\nOooh. I think it would probably be the first Star Wars film. I was maybe nine when it came out, and those were the days when the theaters had 1 or 2 or 3 screens. The line was around the outside of the building and down the block. I saw it and it changed my life. I’ll try to dig up a picture from back then. 🙂\n\nI begged and pleaded with everyone I knew to take me to see it again. It worked – I saw it seven times in theaters that summer. *grin* But I would love to see it again with the same sense of wonder as that first time.\n\nWhat future invention would you like to see not only created during your life time, but readily available to the public?\n\nInstantaneous travel. I can’t count the number of times I’ve gotten to the end of a trip and been soooo ready to be home, but I still have a daunting journey ahead of me. Not to mention what it could do for commerce and just-in-time inventory.\n\nAlthough there would be that pesky ninja-assassin-popping-into-your-living-room issue… and zombie apocalypses would spread a lot faster. :/\n\nIn this age of publishing, self-promotion is really necessary for the author. What do you enjoy most about advertising yourself and your works? What do you find most challenging?\n\nI love going to cons and meeting readers. it’s only happened a couple times so far, but having someone fanboy or fangirl over you is amazing. 🙂 We all sit in our writer cave for what seems like months at a time, all alone putting together our masterpieces, and then we have a few moments in the sunshine to enjoy the fruits of our labor.\n\nAnd the most challenging? Blog tours, hands down. When you are getting the word out about your new book on ten or twenty or thirty or forty blogs, it gets harder and harder to be unique and interesting. LOL… Fortunately you are one of my first for The Stark Divide, and the great questions really help.\n\nYou are stuck in space in dire straights. Which science fiction authors would you want with you?\n\nDepends. Am I being attacked by robots? Get me Asimov and his three laws. Is it an alien spaceship about to swing around the sun and out into the void? I need me some Clarke. And if I gotta figure out how to fly the damned thing, get me some Niven and a little Pohl…\n\nIf you could sit down and have dinner with 5 dead authors, who would you invite to the table? What would they order?\n\nAnne McCaffrey\n\nSheri Tepper\n\nRobert Jordan\n\nMadeleine L’Engle\n\nElizabeth Coatsworth (she was a distant relative)\n\nCover art can be so important for a book, making or breaking sales. What cover art has caught your eye, that you found stood above other books?\n\nHmmm… in general, I like complex covers that look simple – covers that have layers and density and interest, but that read cleanly, if that makes sense. I’m not a big fan of simple flat covers in primary colors. It’s also important, these days, to make a cover that reads well small, since many people will see it on Amazon and other sales channels in a thumbnail size.\n\nWhat is a recurring or the most memorable geeky argument or debate you have taken part in?\n\nFor my book Skythane, I had to deal with weather on a half world – that is, a sphere cut in half. I found a guy who knew some stuff and gave me his best thoughts. Then one day we were at a friend’s house and I had to explain it to two people who knew nothing about physics or advanced weather dynamics or sci fi.\n\nI managed it, and it was one of the most fun teaching exercises I have ever done.\n\nThere may have been cereal bowls involved.\n\nWhat is the first book you remember reading on your own?\n\nI’ll have to default to the first fantasy/sci fi book. It was The Lord of the Rings, and I was in second or third grade. I remember sobbing uncontrollably when Boromir died, and I was inconsolable for days. That same year, I finished the trilogy for the first time, and it’s still one of my favorites.\n\nThanks so much for having me on your blog!\n\nAbout Author J. Scott Coatsworth:\n\nScott spends his time between the here and now and the what could be. Enticed into fantasy and sci fi by his mom at the tender age of nine, he devoured her Science Fiction Book Club library. But as he grew up, he wondered where all the people like him were in the books he was reading.\n\nHe decided that it was time to create the kinds of stories he couldn’t find at his local bookstore. If there weren’t gay characters in his favorite genres, he would remake them to his own ends.\n\nHis friends say Scott’s mind works a little differently – he sees relationships between things that others miss, and gets more done in a day than most folks manage in a week. He loves to transform traditional sci fi, fantasy, and contemporary worlds into something unexpected.\n\nHe runs both Queer Sci Fi and QueeRomance Ink with his husband Mark, sites that bring queer people together to promote and celebrate fiction that reflects their own lives.\n\nWebsite ~ Facebook ~ GoodReads ~ Twitter\n\nSynopsis of The Stark Divide:\n\nSome stories are epic.\n\nThe Earth is in a state of collapse, with wars breaking out over resources and an environment pushed to the edge by human greed.\n\nThree living generation ships have been built with a combination of genetic mastery, artificial intelligence, technology, and raw materials harvested from the asteroid belt. This is the story of one of them—43 Ariadne, or Forever, as her inhabitants call her—a living world that carries the remaining hopes of humanity, and the three generations of scientists, engineers, and explorers working to colonize her.\n\nFrom her humble beginnings as a seedling saved from disaster to the start of her journey across the void of space toward a new home for the human race, The Stark Divide tells the tales of the world, the people who made her, and the few who will become something altogether beyond human.\n\nHumankind has just taken its first step toward the stars.\n\nAmazon ~ Dreamspinner Press ~ QueeRomance Ink ~ Barnes & Noble ~ kobo~ iBooks\n\nSynopsis of Skythane:\n\nJameson Havercamp, a psych from a conservative religious colony, has come to Oberon—unique among the Common Worlds—in search of a rare substance called pith. He’s guided through the wilds on his quest by Xander Kinnson, a handsome, cocky skythane with a troubled past.\n\nNeither knows that Oberon is facing imminent destruction. Even as the world starts to fall apart around them, they have no idea what’s coming—or the bond that will develop between them as they race to avert a cataclysm.\n\nTogether, they will journey to uncover the secrets of this strange and singular world, even as it takes them beyond the bounds of reality itself to discover what truly binds them together.\n\nAmazon ~ Dreamspinner Press ~ QueeRomance Ink\n\nGIVEAWAY!!!\n\nJ. Scott Coatsworth is offering up 1 ebook copy of Skythane. Open international. Ends. November 10, 2017, midnight. Do the Rafflecopter thing below or answer these questions in the comments: 1) Who are some of your favorite science fiction authors? What was the first book you recall reading on your own? Leave a way to contact you.\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\nScroll to the bottom for the giveaway!\n\nFolks, please give a warm welcome to historical fiction author Marc Secchia. I recently had the pleasure of listening to his book, Aranya: Shapeshifter Dragons Book 1 which follows the dragonish adventures of Aranya and her friends.\n\nIf you could give any literary villain a happy ending who would you chose?\n\nSnape – well, he’s not so much a villain, but he is a beautifully conflicted character who I found myself rooting for almost despite my instincts. Very well-written indeed.\n\nThe public library of your dreams has arrived! What special collections does it hold?\n\nAfrican fiction. I believe this is one of the most underrepresented fields of literary endeavour and I’d love to see powerful African voices taking their place on the world stage.\n\nIf you had to choose someone to rescue you from the jaws of certain death would it be a superhero, supernatural creature, or a space alien?\n\nI’d choose a dragon. They are Fantasy’s finest and most magical creatures and they’d undoubtedly possess the skills and magic to pull off a crazy rescue.\n\nIf you could, what book or movie or TV series would you like to experience for the first time all over again and why?\n\nDefinitely The Lord of the Rings. It’s the classic fantasy tale of the insidious, corrupting power of evil and the courage of those who choose to stand against it. Peter Jackson did an awesome job of bringing the tale to the big screen, but I still love the rhythm, detail and power of the original text. I’d love to dive into that world afresh because it’s just incredibly immersive and every detail is thought out.\n\nWhat book should be made into a game (card, PC, board, etc.) and why? Is there a specific character who you would want to play in this game?\n\nThere are so many terrific books out there that would make amazing movies, it’s hard to choose. Let me throw out a classic author’s name here – Anne McCaffrey. I think it’s a travesty her works have never made it to screen, although some of the mores are a bit dated I think this series would still resonate with so many people, not just Sci-Fi/Fantasy fans. I’d play Robinton, the Master Harper of Pern.\n\nIf you could sit down and have tea (or a beer) with 5 fictional characters, who would you invite to the table?\n\nLet’s see … Dumbledore since we’re having a smallish Potteresque vibe here, Aladdin if he doesn’t come in his canned-and-potted Disney guise, since he’d have plenty of fun tales to tell, and it’s weird I know but I think Mulan just kicks it in her world and time. Two more (scratches chin) … Killashandra from one of my favourite books of all time, the Crystal Singer omnibus by Anne McCaffrey, and Aragorn from LOTR. Maybe I’d throw in a dragon just to liven things up. Toothless is awesome but not much of a conversationalist. He’d just have to make funny faces.\n\nWhat do you do when you are not writing?\n\nI live and work in Ethiopia so that’s a little different to most. I love to play music – I play a range of woodwinds such as flute, panflute and Irish whistle – and when I’ve a quiet evening I love nothing more than a relax with an epic book.\n\nWhat is the first book you remember reading on your own?\n\nHa ha, it’s really boring, but it’s one of those “learn-to-read” books about Kathy and Mark I think. After that must come Enid Blyton’s Famous Five and then I had a Hardy Boys binge before graduating to older books.\n\nFinally, what upcoming events and works would you like to share with the readers?\n\nWell, I’ve a sale coming up on 15th/16th August when I’m going to take a run at getting one of my books into the Top 10 free books on all Amazon. If you’d like to sample my work, Aranya will be free on the 15th and it is a bestseller in Coming of Age fantasy. http://smarturl.it/draconic\n\nSecondly, I’m really excited about the release of Dragonstar on August 16th. It’s the 4th book in my Dragonfriend series and the culmination of the series. http://smarturl.it/dragonstar\n\nI think you’ll love the cover art for this series – do check it out, thanks!\n\nCheck out more interviews, spotlights, & reviews on the blog tour.\n\nAbout Author Marc Secchia:\n\nMarc is a South African-born dragon masquerading as an author, who loves writing about dragons and Africa, preferably both at the same time. He lives and works in Ethiopia with his wife and 4 children, 2 dogs and a variable number of marabou storks that roost on the acacia trees out back. On a good night there are also hyenas patrolling the back fence.\n\nHe’s the author of 21 fantasy books in 3 languages (2 more languages coming this year – watch this space!), including 8 rip-roaring dragon fantasy bestsellers. Dragonfriend won a Gold Award for Fantasy in the 2016 IPPY Book Awards. Look out for Whisper Alive, his latest release. The 4th tale in the Dragonfriend series, Dragonstar, is coming soon!\n\nWhen he’s not writing about Africa or dragons Marc can be found travelling to remote locations. He thinks there’s nothing better than standing on a mountaintop wondering what lies over the next horizon.\n\nWebsite ~ Facebook ~ Twitter ~ Amazon ~ GoodReads\n\nSynopsis of Aranya:\n\nChained to a rock and tossed off a cliff by her boyfriend, Aranya is executed for high treason against the Sylakian Empire. Falling a league into the deadly Cloudlands is not a fate she ever envisaged. But what if she did not die? What if she could spread her wings and fly?\n\nLong ago Dragons ruled the Island-World above the Cloudlands. But their Human slaves cast off the chains of Dragonish tyranny. Humans spread across the Islands in their flying Dragonships, colonizing, building, and warring. Now the all-conquering Sylakians have defeated the last bastion of freedom – the Island-Kingdom of Immadia.\n\nEvil has a new enemy. Aranya, Princess of Immadia. Dragon Shapeshifter.\n\nSeries Note\n\nThere is a companion series to Aranya, set in the same unique Island-World above the Cloudlands. Aranya is the last of the Dragons – or is she? Find out why the Dragons disappeared in The Pygmy Dragon, now available on Kindle.\n\nAudible ~ Amazon ~ iTunes ~ Audio Excerpt\n\nAbout Narrator Shiromi Arserio:\n\nA native of London, England, Shiromi Arserio is a stage actor, voice talent and audiobook narrator.

Open internationally! Ends August 16th, 2017.\n\nAranya Giveaway: $50 Amazon Gift Card\n\nEveryone, please welcome Terry Maggert to the blog today. I really enjoyed his suspenseful YA angel novel, Heartborn. A big thank you to Jess at The Audio Book Worm for setting up this book tour. Swing by the tour page to catch more interview, reviews, giveaways, and guest posts. If your interested in the giveaway (and who wouldn’t be?), scroll to the very bottom to learn how to win an Amazon GC, an audiobook copy of Halfway Dead by Terry Maggert, or a bluetooth speaker. On to the interview!\n\n*Author’s note: these are great questions, and it’s high time someone considered my feelings about draconic issues.\n\nWould you rather have a dragon, or be a dragon?\n\nHave, and my reasoning is purely selfish: I want to experience the majesty of having a dragon as a friend– think of the things it would lead to. Never search for a parking space. Avoid the DMV forever. No pesky TSA, or the need to check your broadsword before you board a cruise. Those are all things of the past. Additional fun: Think of the speaking engagements. “Terry and Banshee, thank you for being here. Could you tell us a little about your”—\n\n“ROOOOAAAAARRRR.”\n\n“Banshee would like me to tell you to never give up on your dreams. Did someone say there was an open bar?”\n\nI’m don’t see a downside to this. Ever.\n\nIf you could, what book/movie/TV series would you like to experience for the first time all over again and why?\n\nI could blather on about some obscure French film but that would just be posturing. In film, it has to be Star Wars because I was nine years old and it was the closest thing I’d ever seen to my dreams made real. I was a little boy when the Apollo missions went to the moon; I’d stand in our front yard (I’m from Florida) and watch those enormous rockets blaze upward and it was like I was onboard. If that doesn’t kindle your imagination, nothing will.\n\nFor books, it has to be The Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey. It is, and will always be my first printed love. I’ve bought, re-bought, and bought them again because I wear them out. Seriously.\n\nIf you were sent on a magical quest which other 4 fantasy authors would you take with you?\n\nThis is EASY. Magical quests are always filled with things that have tentacles and fangs and whatnot. So, as follows:\n\nLarry Correia (GUNS!).\n\nJim Butcher (KNIVES!)\n\nUrsula K. LeGuin (Diplomacy/Magic)\n\nAnd, there’s an up-and-coming British writer named J.K. Rowling who, I’m told, might be able to contribute magic systems and *possibly* finance the whole mission, although we’ll have to see if her books become popular. I’m pulling for her.\n\nWhich ancient or historical works have you not read and periodically kick yourself for not having made time for them yet?\n\nAs a writer and history prof, this question brings me great shame. Among the numerous classics I *should* have read by this stage in my life, I think the most important one is Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations. He was an emperor who found time to write. I should find time to read it, in between eating cookies and goofing off. Oh, and I need to re-read Frankenstein because my love for monsters has been like a fire in my imagination.\n\nTo sum up: Yes, I feel shame.\n\nIf you were asked to create the syllabus for a college class in SFF literature, what books would be on there as required reading? As passing discussion?\n\nThis is one of the most hotly contested subjects I’ve ever discussed at author events; it’s much like arguing about the greatest baseball player or singer or whatnot.\n\n*Author’s note: my choices are Ted Williams and Freddy Mercury, respectively.\n\nBut, on to the topic at hand:\n\nFor sci-fi, I say start deep in the past. Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs are an absolute must. They led to the explosion of what we call genre fiction, and thus, we have the golden era. I’d say, given twelve books in SFF?\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth, Jules Verne\n\nJohn Carter of Mars, Edgar Rice Burroughs (the origin of Star Wars!)\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness, Ursula K. LeGuin\n\nThe Passage, Justin Cronin\n\nStartide Rising, David Brin\n\nAmerican Gods, Neil Gaiman\n\nA Spell for Chameleon, Piers Anthony\n\nDragonflight, Anne McCaffrey\n\nOutlander, Diana Gabaldon\n\nSunshine, Robin McKinley\n\nThe Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkein\n\nDune, Frank Herbert\n\nOf course, we will now let the arguments begin.\n\nCare to share an awkward fangirl/fanboy moment, either one where someone was gushing over your work…..or one where you were gushing over another author’s work?\n\nThis is actually one of my high points. I was signing at LibertyCon this summer, and paired with Todd McCaffrey for an autograph session. Some points to know:\n\nHe is the son of my favorite writer, Anne McCaffrey.\n\nHe now writes my favorite series.\n\nI’ve carried a copy of Dragonsong with me for more than 35 years.\n\nI brought my tattered old book with me (given to me by my buddy Tim when we were kids), and Todd didn’t just sign it (he’s an incredibly nice guy), but chatted with me about his mom and their books. Aside from my parents, the McCaffrey family is the longest relationship I’ve had in my life. Here is the evidence:\n\nThen, for my fanboy moment, he signed MY dragon book, Banshee, which is dedicated as follows: “To Tim, who gave me Anne, who gave me dragons.”\n\nI was, and am, giddy.\n\nWhat are the top 3 historical time periods and locations you would like to visit?\n\nLet’s consider this for a moment, based on something I say as a history professor. “The good old days weren’t very good.”\n\nI love things like dentistry, clean water, and air conditioning. With that in mind, if I’m going to visit the past and have a return ticket, I say:\n\nStonehenge. I MUST know who built it, and why.\n\nMachu Picchu during its peak. Can you imagine a city in the clouds?\n\nParis in the 1880s— Ain’t no party like a Parisian Belle Epoque Party cuz a Parisian Belle Epoque Party don’t stop. The art. The culture. The intrigue. The wanton alcoholism and nudity. It’s all there.\n\nYou have to run an obstacle course. Who do you invite along (living or dead, real or fictional)? Will there be a tasty libation involved?\n\nWe will run and drink mead, as the Gods intended. And by we, I mean, “Me, Leif Ericson of the Norsemen, and the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca, because I’m not just going to run that course, I’m going to WRECK it.”\n\nAbout Terry Maggert:\n\nBorn in 1968, I discovered fishing shortly after walking, a boon, considering I lived in South Florida. After a brief move to Kentucky, my family trekked back to the Sunshine State. I had the good fortune to attend high school in idyllic upstate New York, where I learned about a mythical substance known as “Seasons”. After two or three failed attempts at college, I bought a bar. That was fun because I love beer, but, then, I eventually met someone smarter than me (a common event), and, in this case, she married me and convinced me to go back to school–which I did, with enthusiasm. I earned a Master’s Degree in History and rediscovered my love for writing. My novels explore dark fantasy, immortality, and the nature of love as we know it. I live near Nashville, Tennessee, with the aforementioned wife, son, and herd, and, when I’m not writing, I teach history, grow wildly enthusiastic tomato plants, and restore my 1967 Mustang.\n\nConnect with the author: Website ~ Twitter ~Facebook ~ GoodReads\n\nSynopsis of Heartborn:\n\nHer guardian angel was pushed.\n\nKeiron was never meant to be anything other than a hero. Born high above in a place of war and deception, he is Heartborn, a being of purity and goodness in a place where violence and deceit are just around every corner.\n\nHis disappearance will spark a war he cannot see, for Keiron has pierced the light of days to save a girl he has never met, for reasons he cannot understand. Livvy Foster is seventeen, brave, and broken. With half a heart, she bears the scars of a lifetime of pain and little hope of survival.\n\nUntil Keiron arrives.\n\nIn the middle of a brewing war and Livvy’s failing heart, Keiron will risk everything for Livvy, because a Heartborn’s life can only end in one way: Sacrifice.\n\nFall with Livvy and Keiron as they seek the truth about her heart, and his power, and what it means to love someone who will give their very life to save you.\n\nAudible Amazon\n\nAbout the Narrator Julia Whelan:\n\nJulia Whelan has appeared in many films and television series, most notably ABC’s Once And Again. After receiving a degree in English and Creative Writing at Middlebury College and Oxford University, Julia began narrating audiobooks. She’s recorded hundreds of novels across all genres and has received multiple Earphones and Audie Awards. She is repeatedly named one of Audiofile Magazine’s Best Voices and was Audible’s Narrator of the Year.\n\nIMDB ~ Twitter ~ Facebook ~ GoodReads\n\nGIVEWAYS!!!\n\nThere are 3 different giveaways for this tour. You can enter any of them or all of them. These giveaways are hosted by The Audiobookworm and the prizes provided by the author. Enjoy!\n\nGiveaway 1: A $10 Amazon Gift Card\n\nHeartborn Audiobook Blog Tour\n\nGiveaway 2: A Digital Audiobook Copy of Halfway Dead by Terry Maggert\n\nHalfway Dead Digital Audiobook\n\nGiveaway 3: Wireless Bluetooth Speaker\n\nMini Bluetooth Speaker\n\nLynn over at Books & Travelling with Lynn blog recently nominated me for the Real Neat Blog award. I tend to enjoy blog awards because it forces me to be a little more personable and chatty. Plus, we all get to talk about books.\n\nThe Rules:\n\nThank and link the blogger that nominated you.\n\nAnswer the 7 questions that the nomination has provided you.\n\nCreate 7 questions for your nominees.\n\nNominate 7 other bloggers.\n\nBend said rules\n\n1. If you could meet any author, from any time (past and present), who would that be and what would be your most pressing question?\n\nThat’s a tough one. Andre Norton (Forerunner Foray, Timetraders, etc.), Alan Dean Foster (for his Pip & Flynx series), Isaac Asimov (for his Lucky Starr series), and Anne McCaffrey (for her Dragonriders of Pern series) all an impact on me as a kid and it would be cool to get a drink with them and find out what books, authors, or artists had an impact on them.\n\n2. Who is your absolute favorite character, ever. I know you’re probably groaning and rolling your eyes but there must be one character that springs to mind immediately – probably followed by a host of others – but, I want that first knee jerk reaction please and why!\n\nI find that if you ask me this today, you’ll get one answer and if you ask 6 months from now, you’ll get another. I’m easily swayed by whatever I’m reading and thoroughly enjoying at the moment. Let’s go with Harry Dresden, Chicago’s only practicing wizard PI. I like how he can think out side of the box and come up with crazy polka powered T-rex zombie type solutions to messed up situations.\n\n3. What is your favorite series out of all the books you’ve read? The series you would recommend without hesitation.\n\nI will always adore Jacqueline Carey’s Terre D’Ange Cycle. The epic fantasy, the alternate history, breaking so many standard tropes! However, I’m not sure I would recommend it to everyone because of the sex. I love the sex, and that’s part of what breaks so many dated, sexist standards in fantasy fiction, but is everyone ready for it? Personally, 9/10 people I recommend this series to, has enjoyed it.\n\n4. What’s your preferred reading format, book or e-reader?\n\nThese days I do a lot of audiobooks. I dabble in other formats, but find that my deep fatigue from illness makes concentration an issue. Audiobooks are great for me because I don’t get hung up on typos, grammatical errors, large words that I once knew but now find difficult to connect meanings to, etc. The story continues with an audiobook no matter what issues the book may or may not have.\n\n5. The book you were most looking forward to but ended up being really disappointed with?\n\nStation 11 by Emily St. John Mandel. Wow! This book was a bit of a snoozer for me. The main character that ties it all together, that everyone knows or is tied to in some manner, is pretty darn boring. I kept on with it to the end hoping it would get better. There’s plenty of interesting side characters and I liked the slower pacing than usual for the fall of modern society story. But instead the book really is about this one guy who is pretty bland.\n\n6. Blogging – what do you love/not love – any embarrassing moments?\n\nI love that I don’t have a schedule. I blog when I feel like it (or when I feel up to it) and can take a break from it when I don’t. I like that I have kept it small and just blog what I want to blog about and don’t try to force myself into being glitzy, trendy, or the first to post a review on the latest hot ARC. There’s plenty of blogs that do focus on those things, and I’m glad they’re out there because I read them.\n\nSo far, I haven’t done anything too embarrassing. I know my typos and such have gone up this past year while I have been sick. But in the big scheme of things, that’s rather small.\n\n7. Most anticipated book for the remainder of 2016?\n\nKevin Hearne is coming out with his first epic fantasy, I think. Hooray! I really enjoy his Iron Druid Chronicles (urban fantasy). Scott Lynch may be releasing his next Gentleman Bastards book (hooray!). As far as I know, there’s no release date yet for Peace Talks by Jim Butcher. Henry Hertz & his two sons have at least 2 more kids books coming out this year – they’re always so well illustrated! Of course, the next A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin. I always look forward to something new from Jim Bernheimer. I’m hoping Domino Finn does another Sycamore Moon book. I’ve really enjoyed the first 3 Jonathan Shade urban fantasy books by Gary Jonas and I’m hoping he puts more of the series out as audiobooks. Joe Hempel does a great job narrating them.\n\nHere’s my 7 questions:\n\nIf you could be an extra on a period piece (Outlander, Spartacus, etc.) what would it be and what would you be doing?\n\nWhat makes you cringe?\n\nWhat’s the most interesting gross fact you know?\n\nIt’s time for you to host the book club. Who do you invite (living, dead, fictional, real)? And what 3 books will you be discussing?\n\nIf you had to choose someone to rescue you from the jaws of certain death would it be a superhero, supernatural creature, or a space alien?\n\nIf you could, what book/movie/TV series would you like to experience for the first time all over again and why?\n\nIf everyone came with warning labels, what would yours say?\n\nBonus Question: If you were asked to create the syllabus for a college class about your favorite genre, what books would be on there as required reading? As passing discussion?\n\nWhile I will mention some favorite blogs below, I’m going to leave this open mic. If you find the questions (or my answers) amusing, feel free to chime in down in the comments or create your own blog post answering them – if you let me know you did so, I’ll swing by and check it out.\n\nI like to visit author David Lee Summers blog for the steampunk – most definitely for the steampunk. Viviana, Enchanstress of Books is doing a lot of cool audiobook stuff this month. Broken Teepee has a fun mix of home gardening, book reviews, and info on home brewing kits and such. I’ve found Home Cooked Books by narrator Karen White to be a fun place with lots of interesting bits on what it’s like to make an audiobook. Violin in a Void is constantly expanding my world of books, and I like her focus on African authors and book blogs. Mike Powell is a photographer and he focuses on nature. I especially love his photos of herons. Evelyn Aster, who writes mostly contemporary romance (which, admittedly, is a bit outside my favorite genres), regularly posts pics of her fancy nails and her fancy drinks.\n\nOn a personal note, I haven’t been as involved as I normally am due to chronic illness. 2015 was one of the toughest years of my life and 2016 is shaping up to be as well. However, just last month I finally got a diagnosis! Hooray! Turns out I have many, many tiny blood clots throughout my lungs. Because the blood clots have been tiny, the condition didn’t present with the normal sharp pains to the chest, etc. Various scans and doctors missed it, and I was often misdiagnosed as having an asthma exacerbation. Now my doctors suspect the blood clots could have been going on as long as 2 years, with my lungs absorbing at least some of them. Because it went on so long, I have a moderately high case of pulmonary hypertension, which in turn has enlarged my heart. So, I have lots of work to do to get better and it will take many months. I’ve been on 24/7 oxygen since January and will be for at least a few more months, perhaps longer.\n\nSo, if you pinged me about something and I haven’t responded, feel free to ping me again. I’ve been hypoxic for probably about 12 months now and when your brain doesn’t have it’s regular stream of healthy oxygen, you get stupid, tired, and forgetful.\n\nHeya folks! Please give a warm welcome to urban fantasy author Rebecca Chastain! We’re hear to chat about her latest book, A Fistful of Fire, which is a sequel to her book A Fistful of Evil. We also talk about temp jobs, Firefly, fantasy book clubs, and plenty more. There’s also a spiffy giveaway so scroll to the bottom of the post to check that out!\n\nIf you could be an extra on a period piece what would it be?\n\nDoes a futuristic show count? If so, I’d love to an extra on Star Trek: Voyager and get to work with Captain Janeway. I’m a big fan of the themes the Star Trek TV shows have covered. I’m a sucker for books and movies with themes revolving around a group of people working together to accomplish more than they could singularly, the strong bond of friendship making life better (even if it sometimes makes life harder, too), and a pursuit of knowledge without leaving behind humanity and ethics.\n\nIt’s time for you to host the book club. Who do you invite (living, dead, fictional, real)? And what 3 books will you be discussing?\n\nThe best things about book clubs are getting to discuss fun reads and socialize, so with those criteria in mind, I’d invite:\n\nPhèdre nó Delaunay (from Jacqueline Carey’s Kushiel’s Legacy series), for her insatiable quest for knowledge; I imagine she’d raise a lot of interesting points.\n\nRupert Giles (from the Buffy the Vampire TV series), who seems like he’d have insight and amusing anecdotes.\n\nTemeraire (from Naomi Novik’s popular series), for his fresh perspective, and because any chance I can include a talking dragon in one of my clubs, I’m going to jump at the chance.\n\nOur three books for discussion would be E-Squared by Pam Grout, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and Dragonflight by Anne McCaffrey. The first to see what sort of wonderful things we as a group could manifest, the second because I imagine everyone would be fascinated and come to the science from very different perspectives, and the third because it’s a great novel that I think would appeal to everyone in the group—and getting a dragon’s take on a dragon-origin novel would be entertaining.\n\nIf you had to choose someone to rescue you from the jaws of certain death would it be a superhero, supernatural creature, or a space alien?\n\nDefinitely a supernatural creature. In my scenario, I’m rescued from drowning by a friendly kelpie who I can converse with telepathically. She and I form a great friendship, and she introduces me to a whole wonderful supernatural world. Having always been horse crazy and also yearned to speak telepathic with animals, this fantasy satisfies the eight-year-old me and makes the current me want to write a novel…\n\nIf you could, what book/movie/TV series would you like to experience for the first time all over again and why?\n\nFirefly. For its very brief lifespan, the show packed in so much. I’ve rewatched the series many times now, but… The first time the reavers are seen on screen was one of the creepiest things I’ve watched in a long time (I’m not a horror fan, too, so it almost turned me off the show). Now, I’ve spun the story so many different directions in my head—where I’d take the characters, how I’d redo different character arcs, what I’d like to see in all-new episodes if I could write/watch them today—that it has lost the novelty I felt during the first viewing.\n\nWhat has been your worst or most difficult job? How does it compare to writing?\n\nFor a few months after I graduated college, I worked temp jobs. The worst position was at a non-profit doing cold calls to businesses to try to get the managers and CEOs to participate in a fancy dinner, during which they would make cold calls to their business associates to get them to donate to the non-profit. The process combined several of my least favorite things: talking on the phone with strangers, asserting myself while asking for something, and extreme, endless monotony while simultaneously being mildly panicked by the whole experience.\n\nIn A Fistful of Evil, I gave the main character, Madison Fox, a temp worker background, though it’s only referenced and never seen on the page. It was a minor tribute to a hellacious time in my life, one which every day I’m enormously grateful is far in my past. The only comparison I can make between that job and writing is that they are the exact opposite. Now, I spend my days talking with a bunch of people I’m intimately familiar with because they exist and were created in my head, I get to decide when they say yes or no to my plans, and the days are never boring.\n\nIf you were sent on a magical quest which other 4 fantasy authors would you take with you?\n\nBrandon Sanderson: He creates great magic systems that are unique, and he might have something special up his sleeve to help our quest.\n\nIlona Andrews: (is this cheating, since Ilona Andrews is two people?) For sheer bad-assery.\n\nKim Harrison: The way she weaves big-picture and smaller plot points together makes me think she’d be great with any puzzles we encountered along the way.\n\nRobert Asprin: Because you always need a little humor in your quest.\n\nWhat were you like as a kid? Did your kid-self see you being a writer?\n\nI’ve known I was a writer for pretty much my whole life. I’ve always made up stories to entertain myself—during road trips, in class, at recess, while riding my horses, and especially while dressing up my cats. My kid-self was more intense than I am now: a lot shier and more serious. I’ve overcome some of my shyness, though I still need more solo/down time than my more outgoing friends. I know my kid-self would be in awe of the life I lead now and very impressed that I have three books out for sale. But she’d also be disappointed that it took me so long to get here. (She expected to be a New York Times bestselling author by the age of eighteen.)\n\nThanks for the great interview!\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nRebecca Chastain is the International Amazon Fantasy Bestselling author of A FISTFUL OF EVIL and MAGIC OF THE GARGOYLES. She has found seven four-leaf clovers to date, won a purebred Arabian horse in a drawing, and once tamed a blackbird for a day. Dreaming up the absurd and writing stories designed to amuse and entertain has been her passion since she was eleven years old. She lives in northern California with her wonderful husband and two bossy cats.\n\nBook Blurb for A Fistful of Fire:\n\nMadison Fox survived her first week as California’s newest illuminant enforcer, defending her region against imps, vervet, hounds, and one lascivious demon. If her grumpy boss, Mr. Pitt, was impressed, he hasn’t told Madison. In fact, there’s a lot her boss has been closemouthed about, including the dark secret haunting his past.\n\nBut Madison’s problems are just igniting. Neighboring regions report an uncharacteristic flare-up of evil, fire-breathing salamanders blaze unchecked across the city, and Black Friday looms. Trapped doing cleanup amid mobs of holiday shoppers, Madison watches from the sidelines as dubious allies insinuate themselves in her region.\n\nAs suspicions kindle and the mysterious evil gains strength, Madison must determine who she can trust—and whose rules to follow—before her region and career go up in flames.\n\nSizzling with adventure and sparking with magic, A Fistful of Fire is fused with Madison Fox’s trademark blend of humor and ass-kicking action.\n\nPlaces to Find Rebecca Chastain\n\nWebsite\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoodReads\n\nAmazon\n\nGIVEAWAY!!!\n\nAs part of the book blog tour, Rebecca Chastain is giving away a $25 Amazon Gift Card.

I very much enjoyed her scifi romance, Dry Land, and it was a real treat to interview her. Today we chat about hard scifi, best & worst jobs, show chickens, scifi romance, and much more! If you’re interested in the audiobook giveaway, scroll to the bottom.\n\nIf you could be an extra on a SF series or movie, what would it be?\n\nI love this question! I would say I would love to be someone in a control room at a launch of some important mission, whether it be from Earth or as a controller guiding ships from some distant planet. I would suppose that if I were actually part of the mission, I wouldn’t be an extra. So, give me a uniform and a pair of headphones, a mic, and some sort of display to watch, and I’ll be happy. That, and I can use my Chuck Yeager voice, do the countdown, and say “roger that.”\n\nReality in my fiction: how important is it? How does this feed into your idea of hard science fiction?\n\nI love Space Opera, but my preference is for hard sci fi. I prefer that in most of my reading, to be honest. I love created worlds but I really love it when a writer can take our world and make it fantastic. I read Michio Kaku’s books about science in the future and mankind in that future and it is amazing the potential this world has – both for the amazing and the frightening. I find it fascinating to explore that in books and in the things I write. There’s a rule that technology the way it’s going now renews itself, turns over every eighteen months. Part of me wonders if the fantastical future will happen during my lifetime. If not, I can die knowing I’ve at least dreamt and read a taste of it.\n\nWhat has been your worst or most difficult job? How does it compare to writing?\n\nI don’t think I’ve had a job that I can say is the “worst.” Perhaps it was one of my first jobs out of law school, when I was relegated to a desk, reviewing documents day in and day out. Important for the litigation, maybe, but boring as hell for me. I prefer to be “out there.” My favorite job was when I was deeply involved with the legal aspects of arson investigation – getting out in my grubby clothes and slogging around fire scenes, tagging behind some of the most brilliant minds in fire investigation. That was some amazing stuff. But, yes, it’s true that none of that compares to writing. Dry Land is my first touch into published fiction, but I do feel that I have to write every day. If I don’t write in some form or another I go a little stir. 🙂 Whether it is throwing down ideas for more Ted and Colby or hobby writing with some of my writing partners, writing gives me a sense of peace, accomplishment, and sanity.\n\nDogs, chickens, rabbits, & a hamster! Who gets fed first? Are any of them show animals, or purely for family enjoyment?\n\nThe dog gets fed first. 🙂 The chickens and rabbits, my husband takes care of. I do go out there and help him clean things up every few weeks (gross!) but the care and feeding is his bailiwick. We did show chickens for a few years. My oldest son, Ian, won junior showmanship a few years back at the Lodi Fair — something he was pretty proud of. My daughter tried her hand at showing rabbits, but it wasn’t her thing. Unfortunately, there’s a bit of a moratorium on showing poultry at fairs this year because of that bird flu, but… maybe next year.\n\nIf you could sit down and have tea (or a beer) with 5 fictional characters, who would you invite to the table?\n\nA beer. Definitely a beer. I would invite: Eugene Wrayburn, Thursday Next, Lord John Grey, Hercule Poirot, and Captain Jack Harkness. How’s that for a crowd?\n\nIf you were asked to create the syllabus for a college class in science fiction romance literature, what books would be on there as required reading? As passing discussion?\n\nOOH! I think I’d devote entire units to Anne McCaffrey, Lois McMaster Bujold, Jasper Fforde, Rob Shearman, Ursula K. LeGuin, KM Herkes, Sherrilyn Kenyon, and Jennifer Roberson; and then to the indies, of course, and there are so many of them that I love! I’ve probably forgotten some, therefore, I will leave room in the syllabus for my students to do independent studies on their favorite SFR authors.\n\nWhat is a recurring or the most memorable geeky argument or debate you have taken part in?\n\nOf course, to quote Weird Al, “Do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?” That and… which is better – Star Trek or Star Wars? And finally… why does everyone love Loki so much when he’s a psychotic mass murderer?\n\nWhat is the first book you remember reading on your own?\n\nI had this volume of poetry and fairy tales called “Young Years.” I remember my grandmother challenged me to read through it, and I did. And I loved it. I still have that book to this very day, although I have passed it on to my daughter. I still vividly remember the illustrations.\n\nDry Land Book Blurb:\n\nWhen mankind toys with nature, nature fights back. Astronaut Ted “Shakespeare” Hardiston is setting off on the adventure of a lifetime — for the rest of his life. He reluctantly leaves behind his wife, an android/human hybrid, to command the first base on the surface of the moon. Ted and the crew of Space Shuttle Liberty complete their mission, gifting the Moon with gravity and an atmosphere. In doing so, they cause mass destruction on the Earth below. By Ted’s side during this ordeal is Codie-5, another hybrid and a genetic duplicate of Ted’s wife. Ted, Codie, and the crew must work fast and make sacrifices to save the world — and for Ted, to return to the love of his life.\n\nPlaces to Find Jennifer Anne Seidler\n\nWebsite\n\nGoodReads\n\nFacebook\n\nGiveaway!\n\nThe author is offering 1 Audible USA copy of her book, Dry Land!

Enjoy!\n\nIf you could, what book/movie/TV series would you like to experience for the first time all over again and why?\n\nOut of the Dark, by David Weber, because it was then that I knew I could do better.\n\nWhat has been your worst or most difficult job? How does it compare to writing?\n\nWorst or most difficult job? Most of them. Anything monotonous that keeps me from thinking? Worst Job? Ditch digger. Writing is more stressful, but more rewarding.\n\nWhat book should be made into a game (card, PC, board, etc.) and why? Is there a specific character who you would want to play in this game?\n\nOther than mine? Seriously, I’d love to play a Fallout-type game set in my universe(s). Other than mine, Skyrim done Dragonriders of Pern style.\n\nWho are your non-writer influences?\n\nNon-writer influences? What is this thing you speak of?\n\nWhich ancient or historical works have you not read and periodically kick yourself for not having made time for them yet?\n\nGilgamesh. I haven’t made time for it yet. I need to.\n\nWho are some of your favorite book villains?\n\nTo be honest, I’m not fond of villains. As for villains I thought worked great, Eddorians would top the list. Maybe Cthulhu.\n\nWho are your favorite hero duos from the pages?\n\nKip and Peewee from Have Space Suit — Will Travel, by Robert Heinlein.\n\nWhat reboots (or retellings) of classics have you enjoyed?\n\nThe one that comes to mind is the movie Forbidden Planet, by William Shakespeare — er, The Tempest, yeah.\n\nIs there a book to movie/TV adaptation that you found excellent? Is there a PC game to book adaptation that worked for you?\n\nI thought the later Hunger Games movies were good. I usually don’t watch adaptations too often. Don’t even ask my opinion on The Hobbit movies. I don’t read books derived from games.\n\nIf you could sit down and have dinner with 5 dead authors, who would you invite to the table? What would they order?\n\nOff the top of my head: Roger Zelazny, Robert Heinlein, Andre Norton, Anne McCaffrey, and E.E. “Doc” Smith. I haven’t got a clue what they’d order, but I imagine alcohol would be involved.\n\nCare to share an awkward fangirl/fanboy moment, either one where someone was gushing over your work…..or one where you were gushing over another author’s work?\n\nCan’t think of any offhand. I’m pretty comfortable in my skin. Maybe when I shook hands with Neil Armstrong as a kid and realized I was already too tall to be an astronaut.\n\nCover art can be so important for a book, making or breaking sales. What cover art has caught your eye, that you found stood above other books?\n\nI like cover art that conveys something from the book. The original cover for John Steakley’s novel Armor really nailed it.\n\nWhat is a recurring or the most memorable geeky argument or debate you have taken part in?\n\nToo many to count. I’m a scientist, dammit! We geek out all the time! That said, I do have recurring arguments about Classic Star Trek vs Next Gen. Next Gen sucked and has no rewatch benefits. Classic Trek was real science fiction and still relevant. Anyone who thinks differently can feel free to try and debate me.\n\nWhat is the first book you remember reading on your own?\n\nThe Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey. I have dyslexia, so I started reading later than most. I’ve made it since then.\n\nYou have to run an obstacle course. Who do you invite along? Will there be a tasty libation involved?\n\nInvite someone to go through an obstacle course? How bizarre. I’d challenge anyone who thought Next Gen was better than Classic Trek. How about that? Libations? No. Not till after I kick their asses. Then they can buy me Guinness.\n\nFinally, what upcoming events would you like to share with the readers?\n\nMy third novel, The Madness Engine (#3 The Awakening series), is scheduled for release on the 22nd of May. I will also most likely be at Bubonicon in Albuquerque again this year.\n\nThe Remnant (#1 The Awakening series)\n\nLt. Commander Hrothgar Tebrey is assigned as a military attaché to an archaeological expedition as light duty to recover from the disaster of his previous mission. But things quickly begin to go wrong on Cedeforthy. Someone, or something, is manipulating events to sabotage the expedition.\n\nWhen the science team becomes marooned on the planet by the tides of war, the sinister force reveals itself, and Tebrey must fight against a seemingly unstoppable enemy to save not just himself, the expedition, and the woman he loves, but his very soul.\n\nSome things are worth dying for; it is the things worth living for that matter.\n\nThe Fallen (#2 The Awakening series)\n\nLt. Commander Hrothgar Tebrey has returned to duty in Special Operations, but it is becoming harder for him to fight in the name of a government he no longer feels is just – one that orders purges against its own citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, dissention is growing within the ranks of the Earth Federation Fleet. Ships continue to go missing, and the military needs someone to blame. A war with the Sentient Concord seems inevitable.\n\nBut if the Earth Federation destroys the Sentient Concord, who will fight the true enemy? For the Sentient Concord is the only government that knows the truth about the hellish Theta entities…\n\n…Entities that want Tebrey dead, and are willing murder entire worlds to make it happen.\n\nThe Madness Engine (#3 The Awakening series)\n\nThe war between the Sentient Concord and the Earth Federation grinds on, but dark forces are moving behind the scenes, forces intent on unleashing terror on a scale never seen before, a terror that has already spread beyond Commander Hrothgar Tebrey’s universe.\n\nOn an alternate Earth, acid rains fall smoking from the steely skies, and feral things that were once human skitter through the ruins. Tebrey’s father Daeren Drake searches for clues about the enemy and finds more than he bargained for.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt. Commander Tonya Harris and Ghost stumble upon an engine, a weapon that must never be used, but already has been… by the enemy.\n\nLoyalties will be tested, dark pasts revealed, and the enemy will strike a blow at the heart of the Concord from which it may never recover.\n\nPlaces to Stalk Paul B.

They point to the fact that there are absolutely zero dragons, elves, dwarves, trolls, and orcs in it, and take that to mean I don’t care for them. As it turns out, I do in fact like fantasy creatures, so much so I purposely did not include any of them in Dreamwielder. Let me explain.\n\nAs you might expect, I’m a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings, and like many others I feel the myriad of creatures Tolkien incorporated are a big reason why Middle-earth is so rich and rife with peril for Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and their companions. Many of the creatures, of course, were inspired by Norse mythology, a topic Tolkien was well versed in. Dwarves, elves, frost giants, and dragons are all part of Yggdrasil, the tree that represents the nine worlds of Norse mythology. Smaug was also likely based partly on Fafnir, the dragon Sigurd kills in the Volsunga. Other creatures Tolkien created himself. Orcs, for example, were wholly his invention. Balrogs, I’m uncertain of. And really, it’s unimportant what inspired them. Tolkien did such a good job of making them his own, and giving them each their own sense of history and place in Middle-earth, that they became fantasy archetypes in and of themselves. And that’s exactly why I avoided them.\n\nAs a reader, I adore the creatures of Middle-earth. Sadly, too many authors over the years have adored them so much they wholesale ripped them off from Tolkien. Now they’ve become cliché landscape of the fantasy world. Fantasy novels with generic elves, dwarves, and orcs are a dime a dozen and unmemorable even when they’re a fun fantasy romp. The writers who have been successful are those who have taken creatures of mythology and literature and made them their own, just as Tolkien did. Anne McCaffrey took dragons and reinvented them by giving them a telepathic link with their human rider. James P. Blaylock took the standard fantasy races of dwarves and elves and made them his own by making them whimsical, witty, and simply hilarious to read about in The Elfin Ship. George R.R. Martin reinvented vampires in Fevre Dream; and in A Song of Ice and Fire he’s taken the overused zombie and recast it as the white walker, a creature far more shrouded in myth, and far more frightening because of it.\n\nSo do I like creatures? Absolutely. It’s just as a writer, I respect them enough to only use them when I can remake them with my own unique vision. I’m a huge zombie fan, but have written only one zombie story, “The Sway of the Dead,” which casts zombie as humans stricken by complacency in a materialistic, consumer-driven world. (The premise was jarring enough to incite the anger of several magazine editors, one of them who went so far as to call my protagonist a vile murderer. I took that feedback as a sign I’d successfully challenged the reader’s expectation of zombies.)\n\nI’m also a big fan of H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu mythos, but as of yet I’ve not had any brilliant ideas to do something innovative with The Great Cthulhu or Yog-Sothoth. (My good friend and frequent collaborator, Ahimsa Kerp, did though. Check out Cthulhurotica from Dagan Books for a great story where he puts Nyarlathotep in a hippy commune during the late sixties only to get caught up in free drugs and free love.)\n\nThe other notable creatures that are near and dear to my heart as a reader are Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tharks and the white apes from the John Carter books, as well as the dinosaurs and saber tooth tigers from his Pellucidar series. But again, these were Burroughs’ take on Martians and prehistoric beasts. As a writer, I have to rely on my own imagination. In Dreamwielder, that meant sticking primarily with humans, but also a couple of my own twists on mythological creatures. The scent-hounds are part human, part dog, part machine contraptions created by an ancient magic to sniff out sorcerers—as much steampunk invention as they are fantasy creatures. The sinister Wulfram is a shape changer, but nothing like your typical werewolf. He has been transformed by magic to have the ability to take other forms, but the shape changing process for him is gruesome and unnatural.\n\nIt’s out of respect really that you’ll find no prototypical fantasy creatures in my writing. I love them, so I leave them alone. And when it comes down to it, human characters offer plenty of strife and conflict all by themselves, just like in real life.\n\nBut what are you favorite creatures? What authors have reinvented them and made the fresh and wonderful for you? What authors have defanged them and made them lame?\n\nPlaces to stalk Garrett Calcaterra\n\nFacebook, twitter, Website, Blog\n\nFor the giveaway, Garrett is offering ebook copies of Dreamwielder to 3 winners and then a paperback copy of The Roads to Baldairn Motte.

Who doesn’t want to read this?\n\nPublisher: Del Rey (1968)\n\nLength: 303 pages\n\nSeries: Book 1 The Dragonriders of Pern\n\nI loved this book as a kid and I love it again as an adult. There is so much going on in this book, which was first published as two novellas and later smushed together into one coherent tale. On Pern, there is an aging fuedal system of strongholds (containing the farmers, the craftsmen, and some of the ruling humans) and the dragon weyrs (containing the dragonriders, their winged steeds, and support personnel) which are granted tithes of food and other products by the surrounding strongholds. This book opens with the dragonriders on search as the single Queen dragon has laid a Queen egg. These men fly from hold to hold assessing the available ladies for personality and mental abilities. The threat of Threads from the rogue red star is a long ago memory-turned-to-myth-turned-to-disbelief. Only a few of the greatly diminished dragonriders even believe the threat will reappear.\n\nIf you read only the the first few chapters of this book, you might think that Anne McCaffrey was a sexist, having bought into the myth that men are greater than women, etc. But she is a clever writer and merely sets you up to show how our Heroine Lessa will change that paradigm over a few short years by her bravery, her wit, her strong personality, and her lack of impulse control. Indeed, our Lessa is flawed, deeply flawed at the beginning as she is a somewhat selfish individual bent on revenge. However, McCaffrey pairs her wits with F’Lar’s steady hand. He has his issues too, having waited too long to set a definitive course for his people, and then once doing so playing his cards too close to his chest in a show of control freakishness. And I love these characters for their flaws, as it reflects the true human spirit.\n\nThe second half of the book truly shines with more explanation of the dragon’s abilities, the pseudo-science behind their fire breathing abilities, and info on the Threads which travel the void of space when the Red Rogue wanders close to Pern, mindlessly landing on any organic matter and attempting to devour it. In addition to the science, we have a time travel element (and I won’t say much because I don’t want to spoil it), and we have telepathic ability to chat with the dragons who are at least as cognizant as their human counterparts. Indeed, this book has a lot going for it and I look forward to reacquainting myself with the series.\n\nRead Along\n\nPart I\n\nPart II\n\nWhat I Liked: Flawed, complicated characters; talking dragons; plausible science; feudal feel to book.\n\nWhat I Disliked: The first dragon-mating scene gave me mixed feelings as no one clued Lessa into what was going on with the dragon passion and it was her first sexual experience; F’Lar continues to shake Lessa throughout the book which also gave me mixed feelings (realistic for the setting, but not really necessary).\n\nThis is Vintage SciFi Month over at Little Red Reviewer. Make sure you stop by her place for some classic SF. Also, this book definitely counts as part of The Science Fiction Experience hosted over at Stainless Steel Droppings, which runs to the end of February.
