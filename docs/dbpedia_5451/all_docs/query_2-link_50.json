        "text": "Anne McCaffrey's worldwide reputation as a writer depended largely on an extended series of science-fiction novels (several of them co-written with her son Todd), set on the world of Pern.\n\nThis was a distant planet settled by humans but threatened regularly by life-destroying \"Threads\", which fell from a neighbouring planet. To combat these, the humans genetically modified a species of winged reptile, native to Pern, each one of which was bonded symbiotically with a rider from the moment of the human's birth. These dragons then dealt with the global menace against the same kind of daunting odds as were faced by the RAF's \"few\" when repelling the Luftwaffe in 1940 â€“ a parallel sometimes quoted by McCaffrey, who has died after a stroke aged 85.\n\nThe books and stories were written unpretentiously and lyrically, with a refreshing taste for heroism and adventure as well as, perhaps surprisingly, an imaginative knowledge of biochemistry that made the dragons seem at least scientifically plausible. Weyr Search, the first long story in the sequence (which later became part of the novel Dragonflight, 1968) won a Hugo award, and a year later a second story, Dragonrider, won the Nebula award.\n\nBecause of their accessible and down-to-earth prose, McCaffrey's books appealed in particular to children. Teenagers and young adults also relished them because of their realistic and often moving depictions of emotional dilemmas, and there was a constant appeal to women readers of all ages, because of the energetic drawing of strong female characters as uncompromising but compassionate human beings.\n\nMcCaffrey was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After high school she went to Radcliffe College, where she majored in Slavonic languages and literature. Like many writers-to-be, she had several short-lived jobs in her 20s, including working for a music shop, the Helena Rubinstein cosmetics company, and writing advertising copy. She had a good soprano voice and studied singing for nearly a decade. While working in the theatre she became interested in stage direction of opera, and produced (and performed in) the first American performance of Carl Orff's Ludus de Nato Infante Mirificus.\n\nMcCaffrey married in 1950 and raised three children, Alec, Todd and Georgeanne. The marriage ended acrimoniously 20 years later, and she moved herself and the children from New York to Ireland, where she lived for the rest of her life.\n\nHer writing career started slowly, with a few short stories published in the low-paying science-fiction magazines of the time, but once she had been recognised for her Pern stories, a course was set. The novels were all consistent with each other, but some were addressed overtly to younger audiences. Many Dragonrider books followed at a steady pace; more than a dozen titles before the end of the century. The first collaboration with Todd came with Dragon's Kin (2003). Over the course of the series, the early emphasis on a kind of scientific plausibility moved into the background, with adventure, romance and character intrigues evolving. She was once described as a writer of \"science fiction tinged with the tone and instruments of fantasy\", which summed up her work well.\n\nA prolific writer (there are approximately 100 titles), McCaffrey developed many more sequences of stories and novels. She began with a well-regarded standalone volume, Restoree (1967), a traditional science-fiction book for adults, and another nine singleton novels were to follow, but it is for her wide range of series that she is best known.\n\nClosely following the Pern books in popularity are the novels known as the Brainship sequence, which began with a story soon to make her famous, The Ship Who Sang (1961). This deeply personal work, with resonances of the death of her father (a colonel in the US army), describes a society in which the undamaged minds of severely disabled babies are groomed to become cyborg intelligences in command of starships. Such a cyborg mind is partnered with a \"brawn\", a trained human companion. The story ends with the funeral service of a brawn, in which the cyborg sings Taps, the US army bugle call. Audiences at McCaffrey's public readings were often moved to tears by the climax, and the author herself often succumbed.\n\nThere were another dozen book sequences from McCaffrey, many of them targeted at young readers. A large number of these were co-written with other authors, including SM Stirling, Elizabeth Moon, Mercedes Lackey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, but all were distinctively part of her oeuvre.\n\nMcCaffrey was a warm, kind and emotional woman with a wonderful no-nonsense attitude and a love of hard work. She was still writing just before she died. She is survived by her children."
