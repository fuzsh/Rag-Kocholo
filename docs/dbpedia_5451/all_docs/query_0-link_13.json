Its purpose is to serve as a reference work for general readers on the historical presence and ongoing engagement of a diverse group of women in the creation and reception of sci- ence fiction and fantasy in literature, media, and the arts. This encyclopedia contains two volumes. Volume 1 is a collection of essays about important periods, genres, media, and themes in the fantastic literatures. Volume 2 contains shorter entries arranged alphabetically, on im- portant writers and other figures, as well as on a number of topics, including national traditions of science fiction and fantasy from countries other than the United States. The essays and entries all contain lists of further readings, including timely and specialized websites that will aid those wishing to learn more about the topics. Care was taken to provide cross-references between entries in both volumes that present additional information on authors, topics, periods, or genres. In the text of each essay and entry, these are denoted by a bolded word or phrase. In many cases, a list of further relevant entries appears at the end. Given the historical and international scope of the encyclopedia, as well as the variety of media covered and required limits, this work does not pretend to be comprehensive. While the encyclopedia gives some considera- tion to how male creators of science fiction and fantasy have dealt with the topics of \"women\" and \"gender\" in a variety of media, the primary focus is on women. The encyclopedia concentrates on works in English from the twenti- eth century to the present, covering fiction, nonfiction, film, television, graphic novels, and music. Choices for topics in both volumes were made based on a variety of fac- tors, such as the amount of academic and popular/fan scholarship on the subject. Writers and other individuals (artists, editors, fans, and scholars) were selected for inclusion through a process that involved compiling lists of the winners of all major and minor awards made by fan and professional organizations; soliciting advice from scholars on the fantastic, primarily but not solely those connected to the International Association of the Fantastic in the Arts and the Science Fiction Research Association, the two oldest and largest academic organizations devoted to the study of science fiction and fantasy; and reviewing the existing scholarship. A session scheduled at the 2005 International Conference for the Fantastic in the Arts was held solely to generate ideas for topics and writers. While a number of the contributors Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews came from that session, open calls for contributors to apply to write essays and entries were circulated via the Internet, on a range of academic listservs, and on Laura Quilter's feminist science fiction listserv, as well as being posted on Livejournal. The overwhelming response of academic, independent, and fan schol- ars to those calls was outstanding: more than two hundred people sent pro- posals to write contributions. Assignments were made based primarily on expertise, although in a number of areas, especially fan works, that expertise might have been decades of work in fandom rather than academic publica- tions, as academic scholarship simply does not cover the range of productions created by fans. Of interest to future editors, perhaps, is the fact that the three entries that received the most applications by contributors were those on J. R. R. Tolkien, J. K. Rowling, and Joss Whedon. The proposals made by potential contributors also revealed the growing importance of scholarship on new media and visual texts as well as children's and adolescents' literature. A number of entries were added later in the process based on persuasive evi- dence provided by contributors who made the case for their inclusion. The one area where it proved most difficult to find contributors was in art and illustrations. While literary and media scholars have apparently grown in number in the past decades, the study of the cover art for magazines or books and illustrations does not seem to have grown as rapidly, or perhaps discipli- nary boundaries kept calls from circulating to those scholars. However, the wealth of suggested topics, not all of which could be accommodated, argues that there is a need for further and more specialized reference works in key genre and media areas. Some of the writers chosen as the subjects of encyclopedia entries have written several hundred works of fiction and won numerous awards; others have published fewer works but are seen as making particularly important contributions in the realm of explorations of gender and race in science fic- tion and fantasy. The need to recognize as many of the subgenres of specula- tive fiction as well as mainstream science fiction and fantasy is addressed by specific genre entries in volume 2. Topics and themes that are recognized as important by fans, critics, and academics have also received entries. Most importantly, although the United States and the United Kingdom are the pri- mary focus of this work, science fiction and fantasy traditions and literatures in a variety of other countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe are included. The growing awareness of international science fiction and fantasy, especially in literatures other than English, is only beginning. Volume 1 contains twenty-nine chapters. These essays provide socio- historical context, analysis, and background information on key themes that cross genre boundaries. Subjects cover major and minor figures, movements, and conflicts in literature, art/graphic texts, and music. Consideration of socio- historical contexts situates subjects in relation to the different waves of Preface feminist movements as well as to different periods of science fiction and fantasy development. Themes and formal elements of texts are considered, along with genre issues. Transmission methods and media, audience and reader issues, and fandom topics are also described. Volume 1 is organized roughly chronologically, from the medieval pe- riod to the twenty-first century, although individual chapters focusing on later work may provide historical information as needed. The essays, each written by a scholar who has published on the relevant topic, all provide select but excellent lists of further readings to encourage readers, teachers, and students who are interested in further study. The first three chapters (\"The Middle Ages,\" \"Nineteenth-Century Fiction,\" and \"Nineteenth-Century Poetry\") cover historical periods that existed before the development of the contemporary genres of fantasy and science fiction as they are understood by most people. However, these periods are connected in important ways to both genres: a good deal of popular genre fantasy published in the United States and the United Kingdom after Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954-55) draws on mythologies and sources from the me- dieval period. While some critics, such as Brian Aldiss in his well-known monograph Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction (1986, originally pub- lished as Million Year Spree in 1973), argue that science fiction originated in earlier mythic and heroic tales that deal with superhuman or supernatural events, others see the genre as tied to the rise of Industrialism during the nineteenth century with its accompanying development of science and tech- nology. In this argument, the first true science fiction — stories extrapolating from contemporaneous ideas of science — was published during the 1800s. During the nineteenth century, fantasy also became a more popular genre in fiction and poetry. The next group of chapters focuses on the period during which the gen- res of the fantastic become more and more distinct in both production and reception, especially as \"science fiction\" and \"fantasy\" defined themselves as opposite, one focusing on technology and imagined futures, the other on magic and imagined preindustrial pasts. The growth of written fantasy and science fiction in the first half of the twentieth century was connected to rising literacy rates, which produced a growing number of readers who were the audience for pulp science fiction and fantasy in the United States and the United Kingdom. The first half of the century is considered by many to be the golden age of some of the genres and is covered in chapters 4 and 5: \"Fantasy, 1900-1959: Novels and Short Fiction\" and \"Science Fiction, 1900-1959: Novels and Short Fiction.\" The dates are, as always, artificially imposed since historical, social, and literary trends overlap, but most readers and critics agree that the social changes connected to technology, especially in the areas of civil and human rights, taking place in the post- Wo rid War II period were reflected in the Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews writers and literature of the time. Writers experimented with new content and experimental literary forms. Chapters 7 and 8, \"Fantasy, 1960-2005: Nov- els and Short Fiction\" and \"Science Fiction, 1960-2005: Novels and Short Fiction,\" consider the literatures of the fantastic during that time and moving into the twenty-first century. Although poetry has not always received the same attention as fiction, especially in the twentieth century, it continues to be a genre in which writers explore science fiction and fantasy themes, as detailed in chapter 10, \"Genre Poetry: Twentieth Century.\" Just as the \"popular,\" and thus less elite, status of science fiction and fantasy, which results in many critics separating \"genre\" literatures from mainstream \"literature,\" is due in part to its origins in pulp magazines, so too genre poetry is isolated, thriving primarily in small maga- zines and small presses, and finding new publication opportunities on the Internet. Since the same can be said of much mainstream written poetry in the United States, at least during the last half of the twentieth century, the boundaries between categories of poetry may not be so strictly maintained in the future. Film was a new medium that was developed in the late nineteenth cen- tury and was associated with fantasy from the start. Chapters 11 and 12 cover the origins and development of film in both genres in \"Fantasy Film: Nine- teenth and Twentieth Centuries\" and \"Science Fiction Film: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries.\" Film is a collaborative medium, and the participation of women as creators is not always easy to document, but more work is being done in that area in recent years with the development of film studies as an academic field. The twentieth century marked the rise of other popular visual media that often incorporate science fiction and fantasy characters, plots, and themes: comics and television. Chapters 6 and 9, \"Comics: 1900-1959\" and \"Comics: 1960-2005,\" cover the former in two periods, while the latter is dis- cussed in chapter 14, \"Television: Twentieth Century.\" While comics in the United States have long been considered a genre fit only for children, as fantasy was during the nineteenth century, they have long been taken seriously as art forms in Japan, originating in centuries-old blending of graphic images and text, as discussed in chapter 13, \"Anime and Manga.\" The growing popularity of these genres in North America and Britain during the last decades of the twentieth century has presented new chal- lenges concerning gender and audience demographics, with a growing num- ber of women buying anime and manga as mainstream United States comic companies struggle to maintain readership. Independent comics that are spread through a variety of means, including the Internet, further diversify the audience for visual media, with many dealing with fantastic themes. Chapter 15, \"Music: Twentieth Century,\" turns to audio media. It explores the extent to which music has long been intertwined with Preface speculative fictions, although the primary focus of the essay is on contempo- rary musicians. The final essay to focus on a genre or medium is chapter 16, \"Gaming.\" Science fiction and fantasy have played an important role in the development of games (tabletop, video, and online), a number of them arising directly from Tolkien's epic fantasy and related texts. As this essay explains, the growing popularity of games in all media since the 1970s has resulted in even more hybridization of genre conventions. These new technologies not only offer new stories but can also supplement science fiction and fantasy narratives released in other media, such as books, film, and television. In his 2006 mono- graph Convergence Culture, Henry Jenkins began to develop methods of analyz- ing how the explosive growth of new technologies and new media are changing ownership, production, and reception of content. The last and largest group of essays in the encyclopedia focuses on themes and topics that cross genre and media boundaries in tune with post- modern hybridity that is, the mixing of genres and cultures, as well as certain key audience and production issues. Chapter 17, \"Men Writing Women,\" con- siders the effect of the long dominance of male authors in science fiction and fantasy. This essay considers how the constructions of female characters by male writers has changed over time, reflecting sociohistorical developments. It also discusses the rise of new and experimental forms and the inclusion of social sciences as well as the hard sciences in the genres. Chapter 18, \"Heroes or Sheroes,\" then covers the debates over the consequences of writing women characters into the role of the epic hero, with four scholars presenting an overview of strong female protagonists in literature, comics, film, and televi- sion, created by both female and male writers, artists, directors, and producers. The next four chapters, 19-22, are based on contemporary intersec- tional theories that ask how the social constructions of race, class, and age overlap with the social construction of gender, and how different construc- tions of sexuality are understood. The first three essays — \"Intersections of Race and Gender,\" \"Intersections of Class and Gender,\" and \"Intersections of Age and Gender\" — provide information on the scholarship and writers dealing with the questions of intersecting identities, as well as discussing writers whose work incorporates characters, plots, and themes that show the inter- woven and complex layers of identities. Chapter 22, \"Speculating Sexual Iden- tities,\" then draws on contemporary gender and queer theories to discuss authors whose work incorporates multiple constructions of sexualities. Two essays consider the impact of science and religion on women in science fiction and fantasy. The first, \"Science,\" chapter 23, covers the history of women's relation to and participation in the scientific disciplines and insti- tutions in the United States, showing how women's relation to science fiction is connected to their status in the scientific community. Chapter 24, \"Feminist Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews Spirituality,\" discusses the range of feminist relations to religion, both the institutions of the great world religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam and the growing movements related to Wicca. It considers how fantasy novels by women played a major role in the development of these later movements. The nineteenth-century insistence that fantasy was suitable only for the young, and the application of that attitude in the United States toward science fiction, has often served as a reason for teachers, parents, and critics to dismiss much fantastic literature without even reading it. Despite attempts to control, ban, or censor such material, the growing sense that children, and later adolescents or young adults, needed their own literatures has led to a growing number of writers creating science fiction and fantasy texts and media based on age, although the audience for both genres has always included adults. Chapters 25 and 26, \"The Creation of Literature for the Young\" and \"Girls and the Fantastic,\" consider the social context in which children's and young adult fantasy and science fiction developed, as well as the portrayal of girls in literature, comics, television, and film. Finally, chapters 27-29 — \"Fandom,\" \"WisCon,\" and \"The James Tiptree Jr. Award\" — focus on the contributions of women to fandom, the creation of the first feminist SF convention in 1977, and the first SF award named for a woman. As Camille Bacon-Smith (Science Fiction Culture, 2000), Justine Larba- lestier (The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction, 2002), and Henry Jenkins (Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture, 1992), among others, have argued: SF (whether \"science fiction\" or \"speculative fiction\") is not just a body of texts, it is a culture; moreover, it is a complex body of multiple commun- ities that act to comment upon and at times transform the primary texts, whether through reviews, essays, awards, or fan-created art, fictions, and vid- eos. Hugo Gernsback encouraged active reader participation through the let- ter columns of his SF magazines, and the first fan clubs formed in the 1920s. Arguably, science fiction fandom was the model for other popular and media fandoms that have developed since, following everything from sports to soap operas. Ever since the 1920s, fans have debated a wide variety of topics, including the role of women along with larger social debates over gender, class, race, and sexuality. Volume 2 begins with an alphabetical list of 230 entries, followed by a topical guide that groups related entries under ten categories: 1. Awards and Publishing 2. Biographical Entries: Artists, Editors, Fans, Scholars, and Others 3. Biographical Entries: Authors 4. Ethnicity/Race 5. Fans and Fandom 6. Genres 7. National Literatures Preface 8. Sex and Gender 9. Themes 10. Visual Media Also in volume 2 is a selected bibliography of scholarship on all aspects of science fiction and fantasy covered in this encyclopedia, including the foundational bibliographies, other types of reference works in the genre, and theory and applied criticism, in both journals and book form. This scholarship is a part of the historical and cultural context that has created the opportu- nity for this encyclopedia to be published. This page intentionally left blank A '/rtfJtts WHILE I have served as editor, this encyclopedia, as is true for all works of scholarship, could not exist without the efforts of many people who sup- ported the project in every way possible. First, I must thank George Butler and Kathleen Knakal at Greenwood Press for overseeing this project and dealing with the spreadsheet problems. Second, my appreciation for the many people who offered to contribute and especially the 127 contributors cannot be adequately expressed in words. The enthusiasm among scholars and fans for the first encyclopedia about women in SF/F made even dealing with spread- sheets tolerable. Special thanks must go to Hal Hall, curator of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Research Collection at Texas A&M University, College Station, and his staff who ably assisted a very nervous editor in her first foray into archival research: Valerie Coleman, reference assistant; Kristin Hill, reading room supervisor; Melissa Zajicek, reference assistant; Stephanie Elmquist, reference assistant; Nafisah Hankins, head of media services; and the student workers at the Collection. The Internet database created and maintained by Hal and others served as an invaluable aid during the time I was not privileged to spend at College Station. On my own campus, I owe thanks to Dean Allan Headley and Natalie Henderson of the Office of Graduate Studies and Research, Texas A&M University-Commerce. The encyclopedia was supported by two Faculty Research Enhancement Grants during the 2005-6 and 2006-7 academic years, which provided research assistance, travel for archival research, supplies, and most importantly for humanities scholars, release time to do the work. While I may live and work in rural Texas, the Internet and the support of the Interli- brary Loan Office, Gee Library, Texas A&M University-Commerce — especially the work of Scott Downing and Jacob Pichnarcik, who never blinked an eye at the number of requests for books with covers featuring bug-eyed monsters — meant that I had access to a great deal of research from my home campus. Cynthia Garza provided valuable research assistance in 2006. Over the years, I have received encouragement and advice from Farah Mendlesohn, Michael Levy, Faye Ringel, Veronica Hollinger, and Robert Latham. Their busy schedules did not allow their direct participation, but their scholarship and communications have shaped this work in ways that must be acknowledged. A special note of thanks is due Marleen Barr, whose work was the first introduction I had to scholarship that yoked the \"two horses\" of feminist theory and science fiction. Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews I also benefited immensely from my online friends' list in Livejournal, a combination of social networking/blogging site for online science fiction fan- dom. While fandom remains active offline and in a variety of spaces on the World Wide Web, Livejournal was the space that brought me back into active fandom. Academics, fan scholars, and fans read drafts of the earliest pro- posal, supplied suggestions for topics, networked both online and offline, and together constituted one of the most amazing networks any writer could have. Eden Lee Lackner and Barbara Lynn Lucas not only gave feedback on topics and read early drafts, as well as volunteering to cover returned essays and entries, but also introduced me to new genres and media texts and schol- arship during the past years. We have collaborated on past work and will do so again in the future. Christine Mains provided incredibly valuable insights into genres and periods that are her areas of expertise, as well as taking on additional entries at the last minute. Kristina Busse provided key feedback in the proposal stages and ongoing support. Tamara Brummer, Deborah Kaplan, Rachel McGrath-Kerr, Dorothea Schuller, Wilma Shires, and Ruth Veness ably helped by copyediting essays and entries I wrote, understanding that it is always easier to edit another writer's drafts. Judy Ann Ford edited the further readings and bibliography for conformity to Chicago Manual of Style requirements. A number of friends who are active in fandom and fandom scholarship also provided feedback. They are listed under their fan pseudonyms at their request: lOzlaine, Aprilkat, Boogieshoes, Cofax, Cryptoxin, The Drifter, Half Elf Lost, Oursin, Rothesis, Slashfairy, Travelingcarrot, Werelemur, and Zellieh. While it is not unknown for academic scholars to dismiss fans of a work, my experience in fandom and academia is that fans often have an encyclopedic knowledge of their favorite writers, genres, and media, as shown in a number of published and online reference works, and are always happy to share infor- mation and resources. It strikes me as only appropriate to acknowledge the importance of the fan scholars as well as the independent scholars and aca- demics who have worked to make this encyclopedia what it is, while noting that any remaining errors are solely my responsibility. 1 Gillian Polack TECHNICALLY, fantasy, science fiction, and horror did not exist in medieval times in the sense that those genre terms are now used to describe modern literature and the worldview to which the fantastic belongs. However, if spec- ulative fiction includes all fiction that pushes the boundaries of the known and the experienced and incorporates elements of the numinous, the magi- cal, and the inexplicable, then a range of medieval texts are readable as sci- ence fiction or fantasy. What is important about these texts is that many of them are ancestors to our own sense of the fantastic. Saints' tales gave the West a taste for biographies, which led to the modern novel. The links between the medieval Arthurian tales and the modern versions are close. This chapter assumes a modern view of what comprises the fantastic and examines the range of literatures in which such speculative fiction appears and especially how women were involved as creators, adaptors, patrons, per- formers, and subjects in the Middle Ages. One of the key differences between modern and medieval is in the interpretation of miracles. Miracles were in keeping with the technical opera- tions of the world, according to many medieval scholars, because of the direct role God and his assisting beings played in medieval cosmology. Augustine argued that the only true miracle was creation itself. What we call \"miracles\" and think of as events breaking with established order and bringing about the fantastic were considered unusual manifestations of God's workings. In liter- ary terms, saints were often described as interlocutors with God, meaning those who requested or triggered these events. This distinction is important in considering texts in the Middle Ages in the context of literary equivalents to modern speculative fiction: the religious mindset and its description of reality clearly moved the Divine and its evocation from the fantastic to the mundane. What this means in terms of equivalencies will be seen below, but essentially it means that works where the Divine is expressed are closer to Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews the contemporary understanding of science fiction than to fantasy in terms of how they explore the universe. Religion and its effects have a vast influence on medieval tales. Biblical women appear frequently in medieval literature, for instance. However, some of this influence is medieval and some is imputed by modern readers. Early magic and witchcraft literature (such as the Formicarium or Kramer and Sprenger's Malleus Mallejicarum) influenced the earliest witch trials, for exam- ple, but their chief literary influence was not seen until after the Middle Ages. In terms of pure cosmological exploration, literature seldom plays a part. The main writings of this sort (expanding understanding of the universe) are technical. One of the most popular was Macrobius and his commentary on Cicero's Dream of Scipio. Abelard, Maimonides, and other medieval scholars discussed the precise relationships between miracles, sorcery, nature, God, and the universe in great detail. Some of these discussions were manifested in literature. Saints' lives and vision literature explore these issues from a popular angle. Benedicta Ward suggests that Gerald of Wales is typical of someone who disseminated new ideas while holding onto and explaining tra- dition. His work is full of material that would be considered accurate by the credulous and fantastical by the more cynical. The culture informing the inquiries of medievalists has little overlap in this instance with the culture informing the study of modern speculative fic- tion. The fields of inquiry and the approaches chosen by the experts in the field do not render an overview of women and science fiction/fantasy and the Middle Ages straightforward. The further readings at the end of the chapter therefore can only serve as a background for medieval studies concerning women and literature, with an emphasis on those elements of most interest. In some ways, discussing women in medieval literature is quite differ- ent from discussing women in modern literature. The most important differ- ence is that, according to some medieval thought, women occupied liminal roles because of their intrinsic nature, just as Jews did. Because of this and because of the rather large genre differences between medieval and modern literature, the most useful scholarly studies for modern readers who are inter- ested in the medieval speculative and the role women play tend to be those that address individual works, individual authors, or individual themes. WOMEN READERS AND WRITERS Medieval female readers have been studied since the 1980s. The notions that all texts are authored and that the environment around the writing and pro- duction of a text is relevant in its analysis have proved to be important in understanding women reading in the Middle Ages. Medieval women were not monolithic in their reading preferences: some read passively and others The Middle Ages engaged actively; some preferred education, while others sought moral enlightenment. Determining female authorship is not straightforward. Scholars vari- ously follow themes or seek textual hints through vocabulary or the form of a work. Only a small proportion of possible works by women in the Middle Ages have named authors, which means that most conclusions about women writ- ing speculative-fiction-equivalent genres and themes in the Middle Ages depends on scholarship that is still changing rapidly. Gender becomes more of an issue and more easily apparent in writings of the later Middle Ages than the earlier: there are more known authors and clearer genre-gender links. It is always important to keep in mind that the Middle Ages were not simple or short — even keeping to the typical period definition, meaning in Western Europe from the ninth to fifteenth centuries — there is a high degree of cul- tural change and differentiation and cultural instability. There is clear evidence of women trouueres (northern French performers and possibly composers of music and lyrics), although the scholarship on them is divided. Trouveres whose names we know include Blanche de Castille, Lorete, Dame Margot, Maroie de Diergnau, and Sainte de Prez. Discovering the exact numbers of performers/composers is difficult, however, as the evi- dence is meagre. It is even harder to discover links between songs with super- natural or miraculous components and women composers. Most famous female writers of the Middle Ages have little or no known connection with the tales of romance and legend. A possible borderline case is Christine de Pizan. Another is the great exception — a writer who not only used folktales and Arthurian material but also helped shape the use of this material by others: Marie de France. Christine de Pizan or de Pisan lived from about 1364 to 1430. A Franco- Italian writer, often claimed to be the first professional woman writer, Christine was based mainly in Paris. Her work included ballads and several hundred other short pieces, plus around fourteen more major works. Initially her writ- ing was focused on the courtly and lyric and historical verse aimed at attract- ing patrons. Her work contains dreams and symbolism, and her writing is imbued with the sentiment and understanding of contemporary religion. Only a very small proportion of her work incorporated themes of the fantastic or the liminal: she was far more a social and political commentator than an explorer of horizons. The works that have magic or explore the universe in any way tend to be retellings of standard legendary tales, that is, not innova- tive. Christine's main interest in anything speculative is in her sophisticated use of allegory. Her work is in sharp contrast to her predecessor, Marie de France, whose poems carry many hints of the supernatural, link to Arthurian themes, and incorporate miracles. Marie de France wrote in Old French in the twelfth century. Her work encompasses much of the best known of the vernacular fantastic in the Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews Middle Ages. Marie wrote three types of work (although some scholars have contested the attribution of the third). The first is lais — short narrative verse (a few hundred lines) dealing with romantic or folkloric themes. The second is a translation of Aesop's fables, and the third a tale of St. Patrick's voyage to the underworld. All three types of narrative use liminalities. The lais are the most well known, and the liminal nature of their telling is famous with one of her settings — the forest of Broceliande — copied and used by many other medieval writers to indicate a tale's potential for magic and otherworldly happenings. Marie presented a vision of the otherworld in these lais that was clear, elegant, and folk derived, but she also drew her images from classical mythology and Arthurian tales. The Arthurian tales combine, for instance, with the folk tradition in her lai \"Lanval,\" where the hero is a knight of Arthur's court and the heroine is a particularly beautiful fairy. GENRES The following survey, though not a thorough review of literary genres in the Middle Ages, lists genres in which women and the speculative are likely to meet and gives an explanation of where and how that happens. Lyric Poetry Female-voiced lyric poetry (poetry written from a female point of view) was most common on the European continent. Subgenres included cantigas de amigo (songs of friendship), chansons de toile (songs of the loom), pastorela (rural/pastoral songs), alba (dawn songs), and love lyrics. The vast majority of them are anonymous. Some scholars maintain that they were written by men, some that women wrote them, and others argue that there is insuffi- cient evidence to be certain of the authorship. Occasionally these short lyric poems include a hint of magic, but it is not a major feature. Devotional and Visionary Literature The writings of women visionaries and mystics such as Julian of Norwich and Claire of Assisi are well preserved. It is arguable, however, whether they can be classed as speculative fiction. With a modern view of reality, these wom- en's works are sometimes classed as allegories, other times as moral instruc- tion, and sometimes they are dealt with according to the nature of the visions therein. The mystical elements of the works are far more important than any visions, though, as visions are only one aspect of the teachings of these women. Most importantly, the contemporaries of writers such as Christina of Markyate (twelfth century) and Catherine of Siena (fourteenth century) did not consider them to be writers of entertainment; any visions or numinous experiences in their works are regarded as fact, not fiction. The Middle Ages In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, mystical work by writers such as Marguerite Porete, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Hadewijch of Anvers reflect the courtly lyric in style. Their writings, however, are religious and often used by scholars as source material to discover the religious expression of medieval women. This focus puts them at the far end of the spectrum of religious litera- ture from saints' tales, which are considered at least partly entertainment. Dream Visions Dream visions in medieval literature are not uncommon, with many poems devoted entirely to describing a dream and exploring its teachings. They are, however, borderline in terms of speculative fiction because they were mainly intended to be allegorical. One of the best-known is the fourteenth-century Middle English poem \"Pearl.\" A young girl is an important element of the alle- gory. Religious works such as \"Pearl\" or romantic/religious allegory such as the \"Roman de la Rose\" are closest to modern speculative fiction in some ways, though the use of magic and science in these texts is generally peripheral. Allegorical figures are important in medieval literature. Fortune or For- tuna, for instance, has an important place as arbiter of human fate. She appears to have been less important before the twelfth century, but increas- ingly from then Fortune's wheel appears in both literature and art, with For- tune herself very clearly female. Other female figures used allegorically include Lady Meed, Wisdom, Nature, and the Virgin Mary. Allegory is often used in the same way that modern high-concept science fiction is used: to represent ideas that need to be explored and that need more than the current reality in order to explore them. In the case of these figures, they exert influ- ences over events and people, enabling writers to break out of the religious model dictated by their worldview. Hagiography (Lives of Saints) Saints' lives range from biographical or semibiographical to purely fictional accounts of the life of a saint or martyr. They vary considerably in form and nature, appearing in verse and prose, in the vernacular and in Latin. The Jew- ish lives of martyrs tend to focus on the mundane, but the Christian saints' lives can have considerable fantastical elements. Hagiography is fiction that explores the relationship between the spirit- ual and the physical. While much of the time this is mundane and the writer is more concerned with the biography and the incipient sainthood, there is always the possibility of the liminal. An early example for a female saint is in one of the earliest pieces of Old French extant — the Cantilene de Sainte Eulalie. The miracle in this tale occurs when she is supposed to be burned to death. The moral nature of the lives of saints are given to the audience to present the hope of salvation in a palatable form. Entertainment is therefore Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews important, and the working of miracles and presence of strange beings or the Devil are occasionally used purely for entertainment value. Saints' tales tend to be religious or instructional in nature. The biographical form and moral function determine the types of liminal and fantastic occurrences. Frequently occurring elements include the saint being martyred or persecuted, rising to prominence in the Church, working as a missionary, fighting against pagans, turning to ascetism, becoming a hermit, and rising to prominence in society. The amount of the nonmundane content ranges from none at all to a tale bursting with miracles and the supernatural. The legend of the saint and the personality of the saint combine with the form of the tale to determine the importance of the speculative elements. Women figure as the subjects of many of these tales. Particularly popular female subjects include Margaret, Anne, Christina, various collections of vir- gins, Faith, Agnes, Dorothy, Mary Magdalene, Katherine of Alexandria, Cecilia, Agatha, Lucy, Elizabeth of Hungary, Theodora, and Helena. They all have spe- cific aspects that are highlighted in the tales; for example, Helena is closely linked to the True Cross. Virgin martyrs had a particular appeal, as the Church focused on absti- nence as a path to religious perfection. Some of the more important tales written between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries are those of Agnes, Barbara, Catherine of Alexandria, Christina, Faith, and Margaret. The tale of Margaret of Antioch is particularly interesting from a speculative fictional point of view, as it uses the inherent powers of the universe as, in this case, an evil dragon. Even when elements of the fantastic are absent from the tales themselves, the death of saints implies their potential for affecting the order of the universe, as they are given the miracles that prove their sainthood. The cult of Mary is quite apart in many ways and even possibly includes writings concerning Mary Magdalene. Mary Magdalene had her own history in the Middle Ages, incorporating elements of tales of other Biblical figures such as Mary of Bethany. One of the most important elements of stories concerning her was that she was a whore who repented. Her complete tale gave her a rich and varied life, allowing readers of her story to explore her transitions through marriage, prostitution, possession by devils, sanctity — including living by divine sustenance given to her after the Ascension. Her story explores the role of God and how deity influences the medieval world, and it helps its audience understand some of the crucial boundaries of sin and virtue in that universe. The Marian cult is a very special case. Mariology comprises the story of Mary and her miracles. Like the tales of Mary Magdalene, it explores the inter- action of the divinely favored human with the universe and the capacity of such an individual to change the universe. The cult of Mary was the single biggest cult in the Middle Ages, and the literature relating to it is vast. The Middle Ages Frame Tales Frame tales are sequences of stories contained within a wider narrative framework. The most well-known medieval frame tales are Chaucer's and Boccaccio's. The tales within each collection tend to reflect the wider range of stories available from different literary types, such as the Wife of Bath's tale in The Canterbury Tales, which is taken from an Arthurian narrative. Women play a significant role in these tales, some more so than others. In 1253, Prince Fabrique of Castile ordered a translation from Arabic to the common tongue of a frame tale (one of the group commonly referred to as the \"Seven Sages\") that features women telling as well as appearing within the stories. Chansons de Geste The chansons de geste (old French epic legends) are an important and influen- tial genre. The roles of women divide the epics into two groups, one where the role is minimal and the other containing romance. Where the story revolves around relationships between the characters, specific women are of- ten important. Liminality and the fantastic play a minimal part in the tales — the sun stops in the Chanson de Roland, for instance. Guiborc (William of Orange's wife) and Aude (Roland's fiancee) and the other women in the chan- sons de geste are seldom involved with anything supernatural. Romance Romances and lais are generally about adventures and knights and their love lives, and they can range considerably in length. Manuscripts have survived where many verse romances adorn a single volume, while other manuscripts contain but a section of a multivolume work. The most popular multivolume works generally concern Arthurian tales. Some romans assume a pseudo- historical past, while others take the story away from a clear time and place. Ones with Arthurian settings are more likely to avoid too close links with known history. Romance is the genre most likely to meet modern notions of specula- tive fiction. The romances have a larger percentage of incidents that can be considered magic or imaginary; they have strong themes of adventure- romance, and they clearly carry the reader's imagination away from reality into different worlds through use of liminal elements such as the forest of Broceliande. Even those romances with named heroes from known (and rela- tively recent) history have few links to actual history. The formulas are the fa- miliar ones of modern adventure stories and romantic fiction. The romances were written across Europe in a range of languages. Over a hundred survive from England alone, in Middle English, Anglo-Norman (the Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews English dialect of Old French), and Latin. The tales crossed not only language barriers but religious barriers as well, with several romances rewritten for Jewish audiences in the late Middle Ages. Most romances are anonymous. The possibility of some authors being women merits serious study as schol- ars often posit a mainly female readership. Manuscripts of French Arthurian romances from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries give evidence of women having owned the volumes. Some romances have women as chief protagonists. On the whole these are romantic in nature. An important exception to this is the Old French Roman de Silence, where Silence lives her early life as a boy and takes on the duties of heir. Some romances have Arthurian themes (e.g., the Middle Eng- lish Sir Tristrem), and some have historical themes (such as Guy of Warwick or Richard Coer de Lyon, both written c. 1300). Some romances use older themes, loosely connected to classical stories. There are romances that retell the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, for instance, or the Trojan War. These are retellings of classical tales that reshape the tales to fit medieval visions of reality, and the women in these stories have been reshaped to suit medieval concepts. Many English-language romances derived their themes locally, from French romances or from stories told in entirely different forms (the French chansons de geste gave several English romances their subject matter). How- ever, most romances display a limited range of roles for women and focus on male heroes. Women are mainly objects of desire/love/marriage/testing. An important example of this is Philippe de Remi's La Manefeine (France, c. 1270), the story of the abuse of a woman by her father and then by her mother-in- law. The story ends happily ever after, but en route to the happy ending, the heroine's hand is cut off (to save her from incest) and reattached half a life- time later. A group of other works copied this plotline, which became particu- larly popular toward the end of the Middle Ages. Women also appear as minor plot elements. The Alexander Romance is the fictionalized life of Alexander the Great. It appears across Europe and North Africa in a variety of languages, from at least the ninth century until the close of the Middle Ages. This work includes several episodes that might be considered speculative by modern readers, including a voyage under the sea and one by air. One of the most important episodes concerning women (where Alexander visits the city of the Amazons) does not really fit a magical theme, but another, earlier in the tale, where the experiences of Nectarebus with Queen Olympias of Macedonia include making her believe that Alexander was fathered by the god Ammon, is clear in its use of magic. The most important exceptions to women as victims or as lesser plot elements are mainly in Arthurian romances. The Middle Ages Arthurian Romance The Arthurian tales are the closest to modern fantasy in the way they take the reader into a quest or romance-filled reality with world-threatening potential. The tales are also the closest in terms of how the fantastic and the liminal are used to help create the tale. The corpus of Arthurian stories vary in genre considerably as discussed above. The women in them tend to play more important roles than in any other genre except saints' tales. Guinevere is not simply the victim of circum- stances, but a major protagonist in many of the stories concerning her. Lau- dine (in Chretien de Troyes's tale Yvain) may need a male defender and be chiefly a love interest, but she has a fully developed personality, and Lunete (her maid) is able to act independently. In Malory's version of the same story, Lyonet has supernatural qualities. Enide in Chretien de Troyes's Erec et Enide is mixed. In some parts of her story, she acts as a protagonist, but in others, she is doomed to silence and subservience. This ambiguity nicely reflects the roles women play in much literature. Supernatural qualities or a woman being in reality a fairy are devices used often to give the women a greater role and wider choices of action in these tales. Nimue, for instance, in the Vulgate Arthurian cycle and in Malory is capable of magic and thus able both to trap Merlin and to serve as Arthur's protector. Of all the women in the Arthurian corpus, the most interesting is Morgan. Her characteristics changed over time and according to the narrative in which she appears. Her personality ranged from being virtuous, magical, and beauti- ful in Geoffrey of Monmouth's history to being a meddler of evil intent in the later prose romances. Morgan largely owed this focus to the enduring strength and widespread popularity of the Arthurian tradition in the Middle Ages. The story of Tristan and Iseult cannot be ignored, because it was so in- fluential and because Iseult is a particularly well-drawn female protagonist. The tale was copied by many other writers, and so Iseult was important as a literary model. The magic potion drunk by the lovers is the most important element of the fantastic in the Tristan and Iseult tale, because it links all others together and focuses on Iseult. The \"loathly lady\" is another major player in a variety of stories. She mainly appears in short tales set in Arthurian contexts (tales featuring Gawain), but also in Irish historical legends where the woman in question is allegorical, representing sovereignty. The basic tale has an excessively ugly woman posing riddles to the hero. Drama The Bible and other religious texts were key sources for drama, and elements of the fantastic within drama tend to reflect these sources. The attitudes to- ward women displayed in the source texts tend to be reflected in the dramatic 9 Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews text. For instance, a very popular sequence derived from the apocryphal Gos- pel of Nicodemus involved the Harrowing of Hell by Jesus, and the story is all about men. KEY CHARACTERS Important characters and character types in medieval literature who are not discussed elsewhere in this entry include the following. Ancestresses The female ancestors of major dynasties such as the Plantagenet, Lusignan, and de Boullon lines are literary figures in their own right. The most cele- brated were considered important parts of major genealogies. They were at least partly otherworldly and were described as beautiful but also as mon- strosities. There are not many of them, but they carry a large literary and cul- tural burden. These women appear in certain types of literature, but are also referred to in passing comments occasionally. For instance, the best-known work on Melusine (the Lusignan ancestress) is in the romance by Jean d'Arras (late fourteenth century). Melusine protects Raimondin when he has killed his uncle by mistake. She will give him wealth, power, and all he needs as long as she is left alone on Saturdays. Together they found a dynasty. Many years later, Raimondin spies on Melusine at his brother's urging. She is not human — one of the words used to describe her is \"faee.\" The marriage is doomed — as soon as Raimondin accuses her of being monstrous, she leaves. The March entry in the Duke of Berry's Tres Riches Heures shows her flying around the castle held by the Lusignan family in her guivre form. Cosmological and Mythological Literary Figures Characters drawn from earlier writers such as Boethius appear in medieval tales as wisdom goddesses. These include personifications of the Arts, the Muses, Dame Nature, classical goddesses, and Sybil. They appear mainly in learned texts, but there are passing references to them throughout medieval literature, especially to Dame Fortune. Fairies and Supernatural Women Some of the women who appear in medieval literature are nonhuman, and the most important of these are fairies. Most fairies are female and are described as having hair of red gold, beautiful pale skin, and clear eyes of gray or blue. Medieval fairies appear frequently in romances. They do not resemble modern fairies except insofar as they are possessed of exceptional beauty. In literature, they appear as mothers (and can become ancestresses to impor- tant lineages as discussed above) or lovers. They also appear in folk 10 The Middle Ages anecdotes. Some of them have names and clear identities, and a few have achieved significant literary and wider fame. A good example of the latter is Melusine. Others touch on the lives of people without achieving fame in their own right such as the Swan Maiden or the Lady of the Lake. The most sophis- ticated fairy in literature is Morgan (see above). There are other figures that appear in the Norse mythology and litera- ture of the north, such as Grendel's mother and the Valkyries (the battle maidens of Odin in Scandinavian tales). Lilith Lilith appears as a female demon in medieval folk belief. Her most important literary appearance is in the Hebrew text \"The Alphabet of Ben Sira.\" In this narrative, Lilith is a demon who eats babies, and protection against her (amu- lets) is important. These tales and related folk practices crossed religious boundaries. Lilith was considered to be evil and possibly supernatural. Mermaids Mermaids appear as an animal in bestiaries (encyclopedic descriptions of ani- mals, birds, and insects). They may or may not be linked to the more literary- fairies with serpent's tails (for example, some variants of the Melusine story). Liban in The Book of the Dun Cow (eleventh century) developed a salmon's tail, for instance, but was quite human otherwise. Scholars are divided on this question. Geoffrey of Monmouth writes about the sirens encountered by Bru- tus on his way to Britain. In cases like this, this reflects classical influence rather than a separate medieval tradition.

In Spain, Don Quixote (1605), later to be heralded as the first novel, had already drawn upon fantastic themes. In France, the conies de fees (fairy tales) and the seeds of scientific romance held sway. In Germany, authors such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Ludwig Tieck, and Clemens Brentano published tales whose tropes were based in legend, myth, and folklore. In Russia, Alexander Pushkin, inspired by the French fad for fairy tales and the more lit- erary German stories, drew upon Russian folk stories to create the \"artificial flowers\" that would guide so much of that nation's literature. And in England, the foundations of what would become science fiction and fantasy had been laid down by Horace Walpole with The Castle of Otranto (1764) and reinforced by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley with Frankenstein (1818). Discussions of nineteenth-century fiction must, of necessity, define their chronological boundaries with a bit more care than might at first seem obvious, or necessary. Frequently, academics speak of the \"long nineteenth century,\" referencing the thematic commonality of the work spanning the period from 1789 to 1914, that is, from the French Revolution to World War I. This period overlaps the styles of writing commonly referenced as gothic, Romantic, and Victorian. Call it what one will, it is certain that the period in question was tumultuous, particularly on the issue of social roles and most particularly, gender roles. In the nineteenth century, a time when women were coming into their own, that movement was represented in their fiction and in the fiction produced concerning them. Women were present, not in \"science fiction\" or \"fantasy\" as the coalescing genres came to be known, but in speculatiue fiction — said speculation concentrating upon who they were, what their roles would be, and where the future would take them. Although many of the authors from the early portions of the period are male writers producing male-centered works, their work was based in the female-dominated tradition of the fairy tale. 12 Nineteenth-Century Fiction Many critics argue that the fantastic came to England with the advent of the gothic. Practically speaking, the gothic begins prior to the beginning of even the long nineteenth century. However, its themes and scope are crucial enough to the birth of the fantastic as a genre to warrant inclusion. The gothic genre is commonly held to have been begun by Walpole in 1764 with The Castle of Otranto. The novel integrated the \"realistic\" style of the day with the whimsy of the fantastic. The gothic genre is marked by several character- istics: stylistically a certain dark tone, a sense of ominousness; thematically a claustrophobic inability to escape from a situation or locale; and centrally and most importantly, an emphasis on the possibility of the fantastic. Although The Castle of Otranto is Walpole's best-known work, he also included several literary fairy tales in his collection Hieroglyphic Tales (1785), pieces that were heavily influenced by the contes des fees of the seventeenth century. However, while Walpole may have begun the gothic as a genre and established it in a certain mode, his followers adapted it to their own ends and means. Many of the successive gothic novelists, Anne Radcliffe being foremost among them, kept the trappings while eliminating the central point; the fantastic possibilities were quickly subsumed into a split between what Tzvetan Todorov would call the \"marvelous\" and the \"uncanny.\" This split more or less uniformly followed gender lines, with men indulging in marvel- ous conditions and women providing realist plots, establishing a pattern that would hold true throughout much of the development of the genre of fantasy in nineteenth-century fiction. Anne Radcliffe began writing fiction as an amusement and quickly became one of the most popular authors of the period. Of her many works, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) is considered to be most influential. Radcliffe 's novels differed from those of her male peers most specifically in that, whereas she, like Walpole and Matthew Gregory Lewis {The Monk, 1796), focused on the travails of heroic young women cast into mysterious dangers, her dangers were explained away as mundane malevolences, whereas theirs depended more heavily upon fantastic devices. In 1798, Jane Austen would extend the movement of women rejecting the novels that were purportedly most popular among them by parodying the gothic genre in Northanger Abbey (published 1818), in which her somewhat fanciful heroine, Catherine, imag- ines herself quite incorrectly to be in similarly threatening circumstances. Austen's listing of Catherine's reading material (the majority of it written by women) became known as the \"Northanger Horrid\" novels. The themes and stylings of the gothic also provided rich inspiration for the Romantic authors. The Romantic movement was in many ways a rejec- tion of the goals of the Enlightenment and was marked by a questioning of established social hierarchies and by an interest in the relationship of the individual to the natural world and to themselves. The gothic evocations of terror and strong emotion, along with its interest in anachronistic times and 13 Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews traditions, lent itself well to the new movement. One of its leading lights, Samuel Coleridge, would explore those themes in his poetry: \"Cristabel\" (1800) is thought to feature the first vampiric character in British literature. The Romantics' main contributions to the discipline of speculative fiction would in fact largely fall into the category of what we think of today as horror: certainly so with the novel that many consider the cornerstone of science fiction, Frankenstein. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was born in 1797 to two of the great politi- cal thinkers of the day: William Godwin and seminal proto-feminist thinker Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792). Mary eloped with Percy Bysshe Shelley at the age of seventeen. She produced the novel Frankenstein some two years later under dramatic circumstances. A fa- mous house party at Lake Geneva during the \"Year without a Summer\" prompted the ghost-story writing contest that would also produce John Poli- dori's The Vampyre (credited as a strong influence on Bram Stoker in his com- position of Dracula). By this date, Mary Shelley had already suffered the death of her firstborn son shortly after his premature birth and was experiencing se- rious concerns for her sickly newborn son, William. Frankenstein, inspired by what Shelley famously referred to as a waking dream where she saw a pale student kneeling beside the creature he had assembled has frequently been discussed as an exploration of the concerns of motherhood, and the responsi- bilities of the progenitor, with Dr. Frankenstein serving as a stand-in for the anxious author. Although the female characters of the novel function as pawns, the metaphor of birth, a central female concern, is transposed onto Shelley's masculine protagonist. The issues of power and gender are elo- quently addressed, albeit at a remove. Another of the \"Lake Poets,\" as they would come to be called, Robert Southey produced the prototype for the story of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\" In his version, titled simply \"The Three Bears\" (1837), the ursine protag- onists are not a family unit, but simply a trio of male bears who live together, differentiated by their sizes in the text; the invader, too, is changed, repre- sented not by a winsomely mischievous little girl, but rather by a little old woman with a marked propensity for rude exclamations when her ill-gotten rewards disappoint her. Southey was in good company when it came to the writing of fairy stories, original and otherwise: with the 1823 publication of Edgar Taylor's translation of the Grimms' Children's and Household Tales, the fairy- tale became a new battlefield for the proponents of fantasy to quarrel over. By the time of the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian period, fairy tales' original values were seen as a nonissue as compared to their potential usefulness as a tool of didacticism and appropriation. Extreme changes were made to modify fairy tales from their original forms to versions that might be more palatable to their (paying) target audience: the tales were bowdlerized, edited, rewritten, recast, and reincarnated to an extreme degree. Fairy tales 14 Nineteenth-Century Fiction and, by extension, fantasy, were tidied and made suitable for the modest read- ership that was seen as their proper audience: women and children. However, the members of that readership did not always agree with the rewriting. For other authors, the themes of older tales served as inspiration for social commentary and the revitalization of the fantastic. The first instance can be detected in the recategorization of fairy tales as being fit only for chil- dren or women, and in the structural changes that made them so, crystalliz- ing the fairy tale into a recognizable genre. The second can be seen in the fantastical creations of countless authors that began as plays on new literary fairy tales before evolving into the genre that we recognize today as fantasy. The result was a paradigm shift in two parts, first of the fairy tale into a me- dium for children, and second of that children's medium into the genre of fantasy when its proponents found its constraints to be too narrow. As the fairy tale was tidied into a neatly specific genre targeted at a ju- venile (either literally or figuratively) readership, many of the authors who fit it rebelled against its purposes, either by railing against it directly or by sim- ply subverting it. In the course of this subversion, it is possible to argue that, as original fairy tales grew further and further from their traditional roots as a result of the narrowing of the genre, the original fairy tales became original fantasies — fantasies that addressed the issues of gender and power. Simply put, the process can be broken down into three stages, consisting of original tales that reinforced the genre boundaries of the traditional fairy tale in origi- nal stories, parodic and subversive rescriptings, and finally self-contained sto- ries set in fantastical surroundings. John Ruskin's \"The King of the Golden River\" has been described by some as the first English fairy story intended for children. This distinction dif- fers from the various translations of stories originally intended for adults, and from the remakings of those stories for didactic purposes in works such as Sarah Fielding's The Governess (1749). Although \"The King of the Golden Riv- er\" was not published until 1851, it was in fact written ten years earlier for a twelve-year-old Effie Gray, whom Ruskin would marry seven years later. \"The King of the Golden River,\" concerning the struggles between three brothers (two iniquitous and one virtuous) to achieve success, is short on female char- acters, possessing precisely none, heroic or villainous. In some ways, it is the best possible example of the limitations the Victorians placed upon the fairy- tale: written in the form of a fantastic parable with magical creatures in lieu of angelic beings, the story takes the editing of unwanted sexuality or disturb- ing social commentary in children's stories to a new height by simply elimi- nating all women. Despite or perhaps because of that, it was immensely popular, going back to press in 1868, and remaining, to this day, one of the most popular examples of an original English fairy tale. Ruskin was not the only notable British intellectual to seriously try his hand at the fairy tale or fantasy, but he was one of the first, and most successful. 15 Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews In 1853, William Makepeace Thackeray composed The Rose and the Ring (1855) as a distraction for his daughters. Parodying the conventions of the \"traditional\" fairy tale, and pointing toward the growing dissatisfaction for its stringently policed contemporary constraints, The Rose and the Ring satirizes the tropes with a bored fairy godmother, the Fairy Blackstick, who grants her charges bad luck for the purpose of character-building. The frustrated figure of female authority can be seen as a fascinating metaphor for the feminine response to the stagnation of the genre, which had previously been owned by her and all her ilk. Charles Dickens — who famously commented that he would have been quite glad to have grown up to marry Little Red Riding Hood — reinforced that position in two key pieces: first by telling in \"Frauds on the Fairies\" (1853) and then by showing in \"The Magic Fishbone\" (1868). The essay \"Frauds on the Fairies\" responded to the pedantic didacticism of fairy tale revisions of the age, most specifically to George Cruikshank's teetotaling rewritings in the Fairy Library (1853-64). \"The Magic Fishbone\" is a good example of the subversion of the fairy tale form into an early type of fantasy. It is set in a rather modern kingdom ruled by a king and queen who follow the trappings of the bourgeoisie: visit- ing the fishmonger, going to the office, keeping house, all while managing nineteen children. Luckily the eldest princess, Alicia, is of a pragmatic bent, capable of providing assistance and having been granted a magic fishbone that will grant one wish (provided that it is wished for at the right time) by a cantankerous Good Fairy. Throughout the Queen's illness and a number of other lesser mishaps, whenever the King inquires as to the disposition of the fishbone, Alicia puts him off and applies practical solutions instead, until finally she has the opportunity to rectify their poverty, not by wishing for end- less wealth but by wishing it Quarter-Day (one of the four days in England when rents are due). Whereas Ruskin maintained the status quo concerning fantasy Thack- eray and Dickens began the process of subverting the fairy tale into fantasy. Their parodic treatments expanded its boundaries, and their central employ- ment of self-motivated female characters was quite deliberate. It was the be- ginning of a movement to be built upon further by the next generation of nineteenth-century fantasists. In 1865 Charles Lutwidge Dodgson published Alice's Aduentures in Won- derland under the name of Lewis Carroll, with Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There following in 1872. The Alice books were inspired largely by Carroll's friendship with the children of the Liddell family, Alice in particu- lar. Rather than taking their roots from fairy stories, as so many other works of the period did, the Alice books were founded in traditional English nursery- rhymes. Dodgson's publisher considered the title of Alice Among the Fairies upon first seeing the manuscript. 16 Nineteenth-Century Fiction Critics admire the novel as the first literary fairy tale for children with no specific moral purpose, making much of its anarchic, dreamlike qualities: however, critics also note its peculiarly anti-female views. Carroll, with his comments concerning the wisdom of leaving off growing at seven and his inexplicably, unreasonably hostile maternal figures, evinces distaste for mature femininity. In analyzing his attitude toward the virtues of girlhood, critics note an element of transposition: as Nina Auerbach and U. C. Knopfle- macher have put it, the most admired authors of Victorian fantasy were men who glorified the state of childhood in their tales of imaginary lands where characters could avoid the pressures of adulthood, whereas, in contrast, \"Most Victorian women ... envied adults rather than children,\" continuing caustically that \"if they were good, they never grew up\" (Forbidden Journeys, 1), given the typical conditions of women's lives. Among Carroll's notable fellow authors, and as his mentor (it was sup- posedly the enthusiastic reception of MacDonald's three daughters that encouraged Carroll to publish), it is impossible to ignore the work of George MacDonald, frequently referred to as the father of modern fantasy. Author of numerous original fairy tales, MacDonald's first prose work, Phantasies: A Fae- rie Romance (1858), was set in a dream world similar to Carroll's, albeit one featuring a mature male protagonist and his quest through fairyland for a beauteous woman of marble, a quest complicated by his acquisition of a ma- lignant black shadow which corrupts all that it falls upon. As in much of Mac- Donald's work, his hero is guided by a mentoring enchantress, indicating a somewhat different mentality from that of Carroll. Critics have noted that MacDonald's attitudes toward women were nearly reverential, attributing this to his loss of his own mother at the age of eight. MacDonald's work is heavily populated with radiant maternal figures. Almost equally notable are his courageous female characters: Irene, Mossy, and Rosamund. MacDonald's career trajectory overlaps with the larger move- ment within nineteenth-century fantasy: in \"The Light Princess\" (1864), MacDonald parodied the traditional fairy tale format with his tale of a prin- cess cursed with weightlessness at her christening by the obligatory over- looked guest cum witch; in The Princess and the Goblin (1872), he composed a fairy-tale -like story more closely approaching a self-contained fantasy world; and in Lilith (1895), he wrote an allegorical fantasy relating to his goal in Phan- tastes, but one influenced by adult sexuality and tempered by his religious beliefs. Certainly, this fantasy was never intended for children. The transition between fantasy based in fairy tales and intended for children and fantasy written for its own sake and intended for adults is one of the most important steps in nineteenth-century speculative fiction. Where, then, were the female authors? Why, working side by side along with their masculine compatriots, to somewhat different ends. To a certain degree, these authors are indebted to their male predecessors and 17 Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews compatriots; however, their purposes and intentions, as well as their achieve- ments, were different. Women faced a dual challenge in authoring works of fantasy. In a medium that had been tailored to reinforce the dominant para- digm, they struggled to subvert it while producing salable works of fiction. As the result of social expectation, many of their works were aimed at children: their morals, however, were anything but juvenile. Anne Thackeray Ritchie, daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray wrote fairy tale retellings of her own in Five Old Friends and a Young Prince (1868) and Bluebeard's Key, and Other Stories (1874) — versions of traditional fairy- stories set in contemporary London. In one tale, her narrator remarks on the prevalence of fairy-tale figures in modern life, commenting that too many people in modern life assumed the metaphors of fairy tales for reality. Rit- chie's observation of the accuracy of the fairy tale metaphors in modern life — poor girls striving, girls in general waiting passively — is frighteningly true, and well demonstrated in her fleshing out of the themes of the tales. In her acer- bic take on \"Sleeping Beauty,\" for example, the heroine lives an empty, repeti- tive life devoid of meaning, and the fact that her \"prince\" is taken with her ignorance is a source of chagrin on the part of the other characters. Julia Horatio Ewing prefigured MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblins in some ways with her story of \"Amelia and the Dwarfs\" (1870). Her heroine, how- ever, is not a cherished innocent but an artlessly precocious nuisance who delib- erately interrupts mature conversations with inappropriate observations and torments the adults around her with her carelessness and pickiness. Disobeying her nurse's injunction to stay out of the fields at night, Amelia sneaks outdoors to disrupt the haycocks even after a warning that the fairies would be out on such a moonlit night, and she is carried away by the dwarfs to their under- ground realm where she must wash every frock she has ever sullied, live off the scraps of her previously rejected meals, mend every item that she'd destroyed, and clear away the broken threads of all of the conversations that she has torn. Underground, Amelia makes the acquaintance of a mortal woman in a similar situation who warns her of her likely fate: to be kept by the dwarfs as a \"pet\" unless she can charm them using the typical feminine strategy of feigning happiness and distract them via another, their love of dancing. In the course of her chores, Amelia catches the interest of the one particular dwarf who repeatedly inveigles her into dancing with him, only to eventually claim her as his eternal partner. Amelia, on the further advice of the old woman, succeeds in escaping this fate to return to her home as a model of virtue. While the idea of rectifying one's wrongs and achieving a new moral dimen- sion is certainly in keeping with Victorian mores, Ewing's descriptions of the rebellious, forthright Amelia are extremely engaging. Her reactions to the prospect of an unwanted partnership are a commentary on the state of male and female relations; the hint of enslavement is one that MacDonald and other authors would use in their work as well. 18 Nineteenth-Century Fiction In another of her stories, \"The Ogre Courting\" (1871), Ewing's adult her- oine (appropriately known as \"Managing Molly\") similarly outsmarts her unwanted suitor by giving him exactly the qualities he thinks he desires in a wife, only in excess: she feigns thrift to make herself irresistible before trick- ing him into stuffing their marital bed with snow in lieu of goose feathers, weakening him sufficiently so as to put an end to his boundless appetites. Another key example of Victorian attitudes is the use of sexually vora- cious dwarfs and goblins as a metaphorical manifestation of typical fears of miscegenation, class contamination, or other debasement. This theme can be found in the work of Christina Rossetti, whose work in the fashion established by earlier authors is in keeping with the gendered breakdown of attitudes to- ward fantasy. Her most famous work, the poem \"Goblin Market\" (1859), cer- tainly argues for the primacy of hearth and home while preaching against the dangers of the fantastic and the unknown: the \"goblin fruits\" offered to women in the poem have been thought to represent narcotics, or the pleasures of the flesh, and correlate with the projected fears of women swayed from their goals by ill-intentioned men. Similar themes are enacted in her subversive short sto- ries for children, such as \"Speaking Likenesses\" (1874), wherein a moralizing aunt succinctly demonstrates the dangers of disobedience to her charges using fantastic measures. Written in the form of a dialogue, \"Speaking Likenesses\" is structured as a narrative: the stories, concerning three willful little girls who wind up in a series of nightmarish scenarios resulting from their rebellious- ness, are frequently interrupted by the curiously listening charges, sending a dual message to readers as to the rewards of rebellion. Jean Ingelow's Mopsa the Fairy (1869) begins with a seemingly familiar story as our young hero Jack ventures forth into Fairyland on a quest; however, the nature of that quest — to return a quartet of infant fairies to their native land — is quickly subverted by Ingelow's growing focus on one of the seemingly insignificant fairies, the titular character, Mopsa. As Jack and the fairies wend their way through the various realms, they encounter situations vaguely remi- niscent of Gulliver's travels: a kingdom of talking horses served by loyal automatons; a fairy market that rivals Rossetti's own; and, finally an enslaved fairy queen, ransomed to freedom with the most valuable coin Jack possesses. The fairy queen serves as foreshadowing of what Mopsa will become. Mopsa begins the tale as a tiny figure the size of Jack's thumb, and concludes it by having outgrown her putative rescuer both literally and figuratively Although her happy ending consists of her dutiful acquiescence to her fate of ruling over a fairy kingdom, Jack quickly forgets his disappointment over leaving Fairyland to settle back into the mundane life of a British schoolboy. Ingelow's first major collection, Poems (1863), was heralded by Rossetti as \"a formidable rival to most men, and to any woman\" (The Rossetti Macmillan Letters, 19), reflecting the view that the gender hierarchy was related to talent. Rossetti's evaluation did faint justice to both the morals of Ingelow's writing 19 Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews and the qualities of her work; after Tennyson's death, Queen Victoria was petitioned to install Ingelow as poet laureate. Her message concerning the weight of female responsibility, however, left a lasting legacy. Less than a decade later, Mary de Morgan would publish her first collec- tion of original fairy stories, On a Pincushion (1877), containing the understand- ably underpraised story \"The Toy Princess.\" The story tells the tale of a kingdom that prefers a synthetic simulacrum to its living, breathing, problem- atic princess. The tale is set a thousand years ago on the other side of the world, in contrast to the more typically vague \"Once upon a time in a land far, far away.\" The pointed nature of de Morgan's observations is immediately made clear when the kingdom of very polite people who live in harmony is disrupted as a foreign bride is brought to the land from a country of laughter and strong emotion. The miserable young queen pines for her homeland fruitlessly and without recourse, except in one manner. Having already wed, she cannot beg her fairy godmother for assistance in her own name, but she can certainly do so on behalf of her daughter. When the godmother, Taboret, checks in on her motherless charge to find her lonely and despondent, she decides to remove her to more convivial surroundings, leaving a specially made automaton (purchased from the largest shop in fairyland for the price of four cats' footfalls, two fishes' screams, and two swans' songs in a scene that both hearkens back to Dickens while predicting Dunsany) in her place. The princess, Ursula, is removed to the cottage of a friendly fisherman, and all concerned are happy. The princess has love and freedom, and the kingdom has a perfectly mannered princess whose entire vocabulary consists of four simple and polite phrases. However, when Taboret sees that Ursula is begin- ning to fall in love with the fisherman's son, she explains matters to the court, reveals the deception, and returns the princess for the trial period of a week. Needless to say, the court prefers its toy princess; Ursula is released from her responsibilities, and Taboret, having thrown up her hands in disgust at the kingdom's choice, gives them all exactly what they desire and deserve. De Morgan is better known for the titular story of her next collection, The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde (1880), which contains a vainglorious prin- cess who is willing to sacrifice her suitors in her quest for beauty and, in fact, to use them to enhance it, enchanting them into beads for her necklace. Pos- sessed of a far more conventional moral where the princess's willful wicked- ness is balanced out by the good intentions of her kindly maidservant and the manful assistance of one suitor's valet, this latter tale was far better received and remains the most popular of de Morgan's work. Nevertheless, the damage (or delight, depending on one's perspective) was done, and the \"rebellious princess\" was firmly established as a trope, to appear and reappear in fantasy stories, such as Edith Nesbit's \"The Last of the Dragons\" (thought to have been written around 1900, though it was published only posthumously, in 1925), and even to appear in the guise of a magician's 20 Nineteenth-Century Fiction daughter who would be a princess, as in Evelyn Sharp's \"The Spell of the Magician's Daughter\" (1902). Fantasy, coming out of the roots of the feminine tradition of the fairy tale, had a much stronger grounding in feminist and proto-feminist thought than did the fledgling tradition of science fiction: science fiction, or the \"scientific romance\" as it was initially termed, was for the most part a mascu- line domain, despite its inception by the unconventional Shelley. Her succes- sors, writers with the temperament and the background knowledge to explore the increasingly convoluted technological advances of modern sci- ence, were largely, although not entirely, male. In 1886, Robert Louis Stevenson produced The Strange Case of Doctor Je- feyll and Mr. Hyde, a taut psychological adventure that owed as much to the gothic and to the work of Edgar Allen Poe as it did to the advances in specula- tive fiction in the intervening years. In 1897, Bram Stoker took London by storm with his epistolary novel Dracula. Both of these stories are considered, in some ways, as \"invasion narratives.\" As such, the roles of women are held to fairly traditional roles, although somewhat less so in the latter, where Mina Harker serves not only as victim but also as savior. Both of these works hearken back to an earlier and more psychological type of horror, closely related to Frankenstein. Meanwhile, their creators' contemporaries were creat- ing fantasy as we know it today; self-contained narratives set in worlds some- what different from our own. Some examples of fantasy may be found in works such as William Mor- ris's The Well at World's End (1892), The Wood Beyond the World (1895), The Water of the Wonderous Isles (1896), and The Sundering Flood (1898); George MacDon- ald's Lilith; and Lord Dunsany's The Gods of Pegdna (1905). Examples of scien- tific romance, or fiction, are seen in Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Vril: The Power of the Coming Race (1870), H. Rider Haggard's She (1887), and H. G. Wells's The Time Machine: An Invention (1895). In many of these tales, a specific theme concerning women as crea- tures of the fantastic can be detected. Women in other worlds, or worlds not too wildly disparate from our own, serve as alluringly unfamiliar sources of temptation, either for good or ill: in many of these narratives, the female characters represent either fantasy (not used in the genre sense) representations of idealized womanhood, foreign and yet compliant, or fearful extrapolations of the abuses to which women might put power. This trend, a predictable reaction to the changes in society that were reflected in the subversion of the more established field of fantasy, might be considered a form of backlash: certainly, it was soon to be rectified in science fiction as in fantasy with the women of the future, as authors and as subjects, although a trace of the initial attitude affected the field well into the twentieth century. However, even the nineteenth-century rewritings of 21 Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews history made the picture appear more dire than it was, as Justine Larbalestier and Eric Leif Davin have recently discussed. Nineteenth-century fiction provided us with one of the most enduring interpretations of maternal anxiety ever written in the cross-dressed narra- tion of Frankenstein. Similarly, the birth of the genre of fantasy in nineteenth- century fiction has occasionally been occluded by a one-dimensional gaze positing men as the primary creators of the form. Nevertheless, born out of the fairy tale and midwived into existence by women and men alike, the field of speculative fiction continues to grow, even as it comes into the fullness of its heritage through a fuller and more comprehensive understanding.

RUWE POETRY, of all the literary genres, would seem to be the least welcoming to nineteenth-century women writers. Poetry often requires specialized training in classical literature and formal poetic techniques, and relatively few women had access to formal education in the 1800s. Further, many poetic forms are implicitly masculine in content and mode. For example, the epic, which nineteenth-century writers considered the highest poetic form, features heroic exploits, warfare, and national struggles. The conventions of other more personal forms of poetry such as the romantic sonnet assume that the speaker of a poem is male and the object of affection is a woman. Nevertheless, many nineteenth-century women overcame these obstacles and developed various empowering strategies. Sometimes they worked in dif- ferent poetic forms than did male poets. Other times they adapted traditional forms and used them to address feminine concerns. Some women wrote under the guise of a male identity or pseudonym. Others wrote beautiful poems about the difficulties of being a woman writer, and still others adopted childlike voices that allowed them to say outrageous things while appearing immature and nonthreatening. When the first feminist scholarship on nineteenth-century women's poetry appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, critics suggested that the way the genre of poetry gendered the subject/object split (a man as a poem's active speaker, a woman as a passive object being depicted) made it difficult for women to become poets. Poetry after the Romantic era (1780-1830) centered on the poet's own subjectivity — his emotions, anxieties, reflections, and needs. Literary critics Margaret Homans, Alicia Ostriker, Sandra Gilbert, and Susan Gubar argued that such solipsism prohibited most women from becoming writers. Nineteenth-century women were expected to subordinate their needs and desires to the needs of others and to play a supportive rather than self-centered role within the domestic sphere. Those women writers 23 Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews who did desire the fame and glory of poetry, or whose inner voice was too strong to be suppressed, adopted poetic techniques to hide their \"unfeminine\" poetic genius. As Gilbert and Gubar note, nineteenth-century women writers embedded self-doubt into the very structure of their poems. One of the most common empowering strategies was for female authors to split their poetic identities between the subject and object and become both the speaker of the poem as well as the object being spoken to. In poems by Emily Dickinson such as \"Me from Myself — to Banish,\" the poet divides her identity between acceptable and unacceptable selves — and then banishes one part. In the most extreme cases of such splitting of identity, a female poet presents herself simultaneously as the subject-speaker of a poem and as a dead object. In other words, as Gilbert and Gubar demonstrated, nineteenth-century women's poetry was inherently gothic. Dickinson's \"I Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died\" and Christina Rossetti's \"Dead\" and \"Dead Before Death\" have the eerie perspective of a voice speaking from the grave. This strategy of profound self-denial, of speaking as one dead or as one who is entirely passive, has also been called an aesthetics of renunciation. In such an aesthetic, beauty is created through a renouncing of the self or a renounc- ing of the poet's ability to create art. In other words, women crafted beautiful poetry about being silenced or about refusing to speak. The first feminist critics saw nineteenth-century women poets as vic- tims of a patriarchal society that prevented them from reaching their full potentials. As feminist scholarship matured in the 1990s, feminists reex- amined the historical record and discovered that, far from being unable to publish, thousands of women produced volumes of poetry and were well known and respected in their day. The second wave of feminist scholars began recuperating these forgotten texts, and numerous anthologies of wom- en's poetry and scholarly editions of women's texts were published. Once the voices of so many female poets were available, critics discovered that women writers were part of a poetic tradition that could be distinguished from poetry written by men. For example, Anne Mellor's Romanticism and Gender argued that women writers favored an ethic of care (being attentive to the needs of people in one's immediate circle) and rejected the ideal of the egocentric Romantic artistic genius. Stuart Curran suggested that women writers appre- ciated the quotidian (the ordinary world) and respected the uniqueness of others and the alterity and integrity of objects, and thus they did not feel compelled to subsume all poetic objects under one controlling and unifying vision. Other critics such as Angela Leighton wondered about the very concept of the female poet — if women rejected the Romantic ideal of the solitary, self- centered, revolutionary genius, what did they put in its place? She suggested that Victorian women poets presented themselves as Corinne or Sappho fig- ures. Corinne, from a German de Stael novel of the same name, is a female 24 Nineteenth-Century Poetry poet who dies of a doomed love in the midst of civil unrest. She represents a public poet who performs original, inspirational, improvisational effusions. Women who adopted the Corinne model engaged in public debate while escaping the censure of a patriarchal society that preferred that women remain in the domestic sphere. Corinne poets are not intellectual and chal- lenging, and they are ultimately ineffective because they are solitary, self- destructive figures who are wrapped up in emotion. Sappho, an ancient Greek female poet from the isle of Lesbos, wrote brief lyrics depicting an intense romantic love. Poets who adopted the Sappho model were choosing to forgo the public role of a Corinne. These women authored poetry of deep emotional intensity. By the end of the twentieth century, scholars were moving away from seeing men's and women's poetry as belonging to separate traditions. Too many women wrote work that responded to, critiqued, rewrote, or celebrated the writings of men, and men as well as women lived in the same historical moment and shared many of their period's concerns. Contemporary scholars now see women's and men's poetry as containing gender-inflections rather than as comprising completely separate traditions. Men as well as women can author feminine poetry in which women's concerns are prominent and in which feminine behaviors, modes, and imagery are featured. MYTHOLOGY Throughout the nineteenth century, women writers adapted classical myths, finding in these ancient stories a way to express the plight of women as well as a vehicle for personal and political expression. One of the most successful retellings of classical mythology is the Spenserian-stanza sequence Psyche; or, the Legend of Love (1805) by the Anglo-Irish Mary Blachford Tighe. Psyche is the first British female-authored epic based on Psyche's experiences. Its first two cantos follow the basic story line as told by Apuleius in The Golden Ass. Venus is jealous of the human princess Psyche's beauty and she orders Cupid to punish her. Cupid, however, falls in love with Psyche and carries her off to his palace. There they live happily until Psyche breaks her vow never to look at her lover or to ask his name. When Cupid then abandons her, Psyche begins her quest to win him back. At this point, Tighe diverges from Apuleius's tale. Psyche's quest in Tighe 's version takes her through a dreamlike allegorical landscape accompanied by a knight (Cupid in disguise). As she confronts numerous female figures who represent different aspects of the human psy- che, she learns more about her own identity. By turning Apuleius's myth into a narrative of female development, Tighe announces her ability to transcend psychological, emotional, and cultural constraints. Although no other early nineteenth-century retellings of classical my- thology would reach the heights of Psyche; or, the Legend of Love, other female 25 Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 1: Overviews poets of the Romantic era tried retellings of ancient mythology. Anne Hunter authored a collection of light verse pieces about Cupid called The Sports of the Genii (1804). In 1836, \"L.E.L.\" (Letitia Elizabeth Landon) authored a series of poems on women in mythology, legend, and history called \"Subjects for Pictures.\" One of these, \"Calypso Watching the Ocean,\" depicts the forgotten, lonely, and grieving Calypso. As Leighton has suggested is typical of the Sap- pho style of writing from the early Victorian period, L.E.L.'s poetry explores the fate of women who are trapped in a world of suffocating emotion. By the mid-1870s, women poets began to write openly about the rights of women, and many women used characters from classical mythology as a way of exploring women's issues. Feminist activist Emily Pfeiffer published a group of sonnets in 1879 about the sorrows of Kassandra and her justified an- ger."
