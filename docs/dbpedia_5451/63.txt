Dragonriders of Pern is a science-fiction/fantasy series of novels and short stories primarily written by Anne McCaffrey. The series takes place on the fictional planet of Pern, where life is presented as a pre-industrial society with lords (feudal counts or barons), holds (villages/towns), craftspeople (a system of professions very similar to medieval German crafts (Zunft)), and dragons.

Since 2004, McCaffrey's son Todd McCaffrey has also written Pern novels, both in collaboration with Anne and on his own.
