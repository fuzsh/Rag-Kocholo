You can follow along with this list and eat the spicy Sichuan noodles from your dreams! AND, If you want some inspiration and mouth watering enticement, you should first watch my Dan Dan noodle tour video.\n\n1 Chengdu's Most Famous Dan Dan Noodles and Chili Oil Wontons\n\nAny trip to Chengdu is incomplete without trying the famous dan dan noodles and hot chili oil wontons at Chunyangguan. This place is without a doubt the BEST place to try dan dan noodles and hot chili oil wontons in Chengdu. It’s also very close to people’s park and the downtown Chengdu core.\n\nI have translated the menu to help you order:\n\nYou can use this translated menu to help order your favourite noodles. I personally love the cowpea noodles (#2) and the dan dan noodles (#4) as well as the chili oil wontons (#13).

In the video, we take some guests for a Chengdu food tour, bringing them to many of the SPICY Sichuan foods in this blog. Afterwards, continue scrolling to discover more delicious Chengdu food and the best restaurants in Chengdu!\n\nCHUNYANGGUAN YUXIANG PAIGUMIAN\n\nName: 纯阳馆鱼香排骨面\n\nMust Order: Dan Dan Noodles 担担面, Cowpea Noodles 豇豆面, Red Chili Oil Wontons 红油抄手, White Starch Jelly Noodles 白凉粉, Yellow Starch Jelly Noodles 黄凉粉\n\nComments: Ordering small portions and ordering a few bowls is the best way to try a nice variety of noodles.\n\nAddress: 青羊区吉祥街6号附6号 吉祥结店 – Qingyang Qu Jixiang Jie 6 Hao Fu 6 Hao jixiangjie dian\n\nPrice: 20 RMB per person\n\n2 Incredibly Delicious Twice Cooked Pork Noodles\n\nThis is one of the most potent and delicious bowls of noodles you’ll ever eat. Found at Shangchi Mianguan, one of Chengdu’s most classic noodle joints, you can’t go wrong with a bowl of these. It’s full of twice cooked pork, a classic dish in Sichuan cuisine. The pork is a combination of lean and fatty and is cooked in a Sichuan fermented broadbean paste that is spicy and delicious. The bowl is loaded with a thick and spice packed chili oil that you get to mix through the noodles when they first arrive.\n\nI’ve translated the menu for you as well:\n\nBe warned, this is a strong bowl! It’s spicy and strong and will fill you up! Also, the environment around this noodle joint is a little more old school and not suitable for people wanting a perfect modern and clean experience. Your mouth is going to water when you see these noodles in my Chengdu food tour video below! It’s amazing to watch Chef Yu prepare the twice cooked pork using his family recipe!\n\nSHANGCHI MIANGUAN\n\nName: 上池面馆\n\nMust Order: Huiguoroumian Twice Cooked Pork Noodles 回锅肉面\n\nComments: One of the old classic noodle joints\n\nAddress: 上池正街39号(近文翁路) Shangchi Zhengjie 39 Hao\n\nPrice: 10 – 12 RMB ($1.50 and up)\n\nHours: Only open in the morning until 2 pm and closed on weekends.\n\n3 Enter Wonton Heaven – Chengdu's Most Plump and Elegant Wontons\n\nOne of the best bowls of spicy wontons in Chengdu is at Ganhaijiao Chaoshou 干海椒抄手. This little family run joint has the full spectrum of flavours of Sichuan wontons to try. It is definitely worth coming back a few times to try them all. A lot of their customers do just that, they revisit over and over because the wontons are so good! Their signature dish, the wontons in spicy chili broth stuffed plump with pork and seasonings, is heavenly. The broth is extremely spicy though, be careful! If you want less spicy, they have another signature wonton, stuffed incredibly plump with pork, crab roe, and shrimp. t’s served in a clear and rich broth with caterpillar fungus and bamboo fungus!\n\nI have also translated the menu for you to help you order:\n\nThe wonton restaurant is located in a traditional neighbourhood in the northeast of Chengdu. The coolest part is how it’s located in someones home and how you have to walk up some stairs to get in!\n\nThis place is a little difficult to find. You can follow along with the map at the top of the post and then if you can’t find it, ask a local near you and show them the address. Most people around should know this place, it’s famous! You will probably have to lineup if you’re not there 20 minutes before they open!\n\nGANHAIJAO CHAOSHOU\n\nName: 干海椒抄手\n\nMust Order: 1. Ganhaijiao Chaoshou 干海椒抄手 2. Chicken, Shrimp, Crab Egg, and Bamboo 土鸡竹荪汤鲜虾蟹籽抄手 3. Pickled Radish Luobo Gan 萝卜干\n\nComments: It's deep inside a local community. Bring the address with you and follow along on the map.

It’s located in the west of Chengdu, in Qingyang district. I found this place luckily one day while biking around looking for delicious noodles.\n\nOrder the Zajiangmian 杂酱面 mixed sauce noodles with cowpeas . Noodles are served in sizes of liang in Chengdu, you can order either 1, 2, or 3, or sometimes even 4 liang. I usually order 3, San liang.\n\nThese “enter noodle heaven” zajiang noodles are shown in the Chengdu food video below. You’re going to get hungry! The mixing of the chili oil on the noodles is what makes my mouth water every time!\n\nLIAOLAO ZAJIANG MIAN\n\nName: 廖老幺杂酱面\n\nMust Order: Zajiangmian 杂酱面\n\nComments: Located a little bit west the city center, but worth coming here for the noodles!\n\nAddress: Jinpeng jie 12 hao 金鹏街12号\n\nHours: Come for lunch\n\n5 “Sweet Water Noodles” and Spicy Mung Bean Jelly Noodles\n\nThese tianshuimian, also known as sweet water noodles, were one of the first things I tried in Chengdu that made me go WOW. The recipe they use is just right. It’s also one of the few tourist places that’s actually good. It’s located directly across from Wenshu temple in downtown Chengdu. The noodles are thick and rough and coated in a spicy oil, and the sugar crystals added on top add a little extra roughness. It has a sweet and fruity almost plum like jam that they add on top. It’s a really unique dish that must be tried while you’re in Chengdu. Order them up! These sweet water noodles are featured in another one of my Chengdu food tour videos. I hope you enjoy watching! Keep scrolling after watching to discover even more delicious Sichuan food!\n\nDONGZI WEI ZHANG LAO ER LIANGFEN\n\nName: 洞子囗張老二涼粉\n\nMust Order: Tianshuimian 甜水面 “Sweet water noodles”, Niurou dandan noodles 牛肉担担面, Red Oil Wontons 红油抄手 hongyouchaosyou\n\nComments: The best bowl of tianshuimian in Chengdu\n\nAddress: 文殊院对面 -Directly across from Wenshu temple\n\nPrice: 7 RMB + per small snack\n\nHours: Closes early in the evening, come for lunch or afternoon.or lunch\n\n6 Chengdu's BEST Silken Tofu Noodles\n\nAnother amazing Sichuan food to try is douhua, the silken tofu. Here at xiaotan douhua, it’s taken to a new level by mixing traditional douhua with noodles and a variety of toppings. You can order couple different small sized bowls of douhua and some other traditional Sichuan street foods as well, like dan dan noodles, zongzi sticky rice, red oil dumplings, zong dumplings, and sweet water noodles. They actually have most of the traditional Sichuan xiaochi “small eats” snacks, but I really only recommend coming here for the douhua. If you want to try the other dishes, that’s fine too.\n\nSanzi douhua is my favourite bowl of douhua to order. Silky douhua is covered in a thick chili broth and their signature fried noodle sticks with peanuts. The noodle sticks and peanuts are the perfect contrast to the soft douhua! When you bite into the crispy noodle sticks, there’s nothing better!\n\nAnother bowl to order is the shaozi douhua mian. Delicious ground pork fried in a ton of Sichuan spices and ingredients is topped over a bowl of spicy broth and douhua, noodles, peanuts, and green onions. Another must eat b0wl of noodles in Chengdu!\n\nXIAOTAN DOUHUA\n\nName: 小谭豆花\n\nMust Order: 1. Sanzi douhua with fried noodle sticks 馓子豆花 2. Shaozi douhua noodles with ground pork 绍子豆花面 3. hongtang douhua with molasses 红糖豆花.\n\nComments: They also have most of the traditional Sichuan snack foods.\n\nAddress: 西大街86附13号 Xidajie 86 hao\n\nPrice: About 20 RMB per person\n\nHours: 07:30 – 20:30\n\n7 Sichuan Rabbit Noodles and Beef Noodle Soup\n\nThere are a lot of different noodles you can try in Chengdu. One of the more unique ones is the rabbit noodles. Here at Xiamianguan 下面馆, there are quite a few varieties of Sichuan noodles to try. The usual offerings like zajiang noodles and dan dan noodles however are not their specialty. Rabbit noodles and the red braised beef noodle soup with bamboo are the two best bowls in my opinion. They also offer a special black silky chicken and matsutake mushroom soup (zhusun wuji tang 竹荪乌鸡汤) that is incredibly rich and deep in umami flavour. The rabbit is “yuxiang” 鱼香 style, meaning “fish fragrant”, an old style of cooking originally used to cook fish. You pour the rabbit slivers over top of your noodles and mix it in and it’s so delicious!\n\nMake sure to order both of these bowls, they are so delicious!\n\nXIAMIANGUAN\n\nName: 下面馆\n\nMust Order: 1. Rabbit noodles (yuxiang tusi mian 鱼香兔丝面）2. Red braised beef noodle soup with bamboo ( niuroumian 牛肉面) 3. Black silky chicken soup (zhusun wuji tang 竹荪乌鸡汤)\n\nComments: Very nice family running this restaurant!\n\nAddress: 武成大街35号 Wucheng Dajie 35 Hao\n\nPrice: 20 RMB per bowl\n\nHours: 07:00 – 20:00\n\n8 Delicious Sichuan Dumplings\n\nAnother delicious Sichuan food to try is the red chili oil dumplings at Fuzi Shuijiao 父子水饺. This 25+ year old dumpling joint is in an old home and has been continuously run by the Liu family. I must admit, these dumplings were not the most plump dumplings I’ve ever eaten, but the atmosphere, flavour of the chili oil, and friendliness of the Liu family was worth coming here for. They are all hand pinched one by one, and you get a real feel for the atmosphere of old Chengdu which is quickly disappearing.\n\nFUZI SHUIJIAO\n\nName: 父子水饺\n\nMust Order: Pork dumplings 肉饺\n\nComments: Come in the morning before 12:00, otherwise it gets busy.\n\nAddress: 牛王庙巷8号 Niuwangmiao xiang 8 hao\n\nPrice: ~12 RMB per person\n\nHours: 08:00 – 15:00\n\n9 My Neighbourhood Noodle Joint\n\nOne of my favourite bowls of noodles in Chengdu is WAY out in the outskirts. It’s in the neighbourhood we live in in Chengdu. If you want to come all the way out to Longquanyi, perhaps you can also visit the peach blossoms in the spring to make it worth your while in the mountains. But if not, you could also just come all the way out to this noodle joint to eat. It’s delicious! SOLID 10/10!\n\nLIANWEI LAOMIANGUAN\n\nName: 恋味老面馆\n\nMust Order: Pickled chili beef noodles – Paojiao Niurou mian 泡椒牛肉面\n\nComments: It's really far outside of the center of Chengdu.\n\nAddress: 成都市龙泉驿区龙平路427号 – Take the subway line 2 all the way to Longping Lu 龙平路 and get out at exit B and walk straight for a couple hundred meters.\n\nPrice: 11 RMB for a big bowl.\n\nSICHUAN HOT POT\n\nJust like visiting the pandas in Chengdu, any trip to Chengdu is incomplete without eating the most traditional Sichuan food of all, Sichuan hot pot! When you walk into a local Chengdu hot pot joint for the first time, with all of the hundreds of bubbling pots of chili and oil, you’ll be taken aback at just how strong the aroma of the bubbling cauldrons are. Fear not, these are spicy but not deadly. Below are the best hot pot restaurants in Chengdu, get ready for some spicy Sichuan delight! These are not in any particular order, but I personally love the first one because it is DEEP and super local and delicious and very spicy! The Sichuan hot pot video below is one of the spiciest hot pots you can eat, but don’t worry, just order “weila” less spicy and you’ll be fine.\n\n1 Chengdu's most LOCAL style Sichuan Hot Pot\n\nIf you’re wanting to try the most LOCAL style hot pot restaurant in Chengdu, you need to come visit Hongshe Chongqing Lao Huoguo. This Sichuan hot pot restaurant is in a local neighbourhood in the North East of Chengdu, and well worth the ride out. The place is PACKED with locals enjoying the extremely spicy and potent hot pot served here. You will probably have to lineup. It’s definitely one of the more local style hot pots in Chengdu. If you want a more clean environment, visit one of the Szechuan hot pot restaurants below.\n\nThis hot pot restaurant in Chengdu is featured in my Chengdu food tour video below.\n\nHONGSHE CHONGQING LAO HUOGUO\n\nName: 鸿社重庆老火锅\n\nMust Order: 1. Spicy and numbing beef – mala niurou – 麻辣牛肉 2. Soft Beef – Nen Niurou – 嫩牛肉\n\nAddress: 建设南一路菽香里一巷36号 Jianshe Nan Yilu Shuxiang Li Yi Xiang 36 Hao\n\nPrice: About 80 RMB per person\n\nHours: 11:30 to 21:00\n\n2 Chengdu's Most FAMOUS Sichuan Hot Pot\n\nOne of the great things about Bashu Dazhaimen Hot Pot is the lively atmosphere and authentic Sichuanese atmosphere. This famous hot pot chain has locations throughout Chengdu, with lineups at each location every night, it’s that popular! It’s also very clean and great for hot pot first timers. The hot pot oil is so fragrant and full of Sichuan peppercorns, giving you an amazing mouth numbing kick!\n\nMake sure to order one of Chengdu’s most famous iced desserts to go with your hot pot, the hongtang bingfen 红糖冰粉. It really helps keep you cool! Combined with Chengdu’s famous soy milk, weiyi 唯一, and a dipping bowl full of vinegar, garlic, and sesame oil, you can beat the spiciness of the hotpot and enjoy!\n\nBASHU DAZHAIMEN HUOGUO\n\nName: 巴蜀大宅门\n\nMust Order: 1. Order an iced bingfen jelly and molasses dessert with your hot pot – hongtang bingfen 红糖冰粉.\n\nComments: This place is always busy! You will probably need to lineup if you come after 6pm.\n\nAddress: 北大街91号 Beidajie 91 Hao\n\nPrice: About 90 RMB/ person\n\nHours: 11:00 – 02:00\n\n3 (9) Section Hot Pot\n\nIf you’re staying in the south or have tried the other hot pot joints, you can come to jiugongge. This relatively small hot pot joint serves some incredibly delicious hot pot. It’s fun to watch the beef lard slowly melting and the pot becoming redder and redder. I love the nine sections as well, you can separate your meats and vegetables.\n\nJIU GONG GE HOT POT\n\nName: 丼亦九宫格火锅\n\nMust Order: 1. Spicy and numbing beef mala niurou 麻辣牛肉 2. nen niu rou soft beef 嫩牛肉\n\nAddress: 广福桥西街1号附41号丼亦九宫格火锅 Yanfu Xiaoxi Jie 1 Hao Fu 41 Hao\n\nHours: 12:00 – 23:00\n\nCLASSIC SICHUAN DISHES\n\nBelow are my favourite restaurants for eating classic Sichuan food. These are some of the best restaurants in Chengdu for ordering a large table of Sichuan cuisine. These places are better to come with at least 3 people. You can of course come alone to eat this food, but with more people you will be able to eat more. There are so many Sichuan foods to try! I took my parents to try a few of them in our Chengdu food tour video below:\n\n1 Chengdu's most TRADITIONAL restaurant\n\nThis restaurant is one of the few places in Chengdu that I’ve found with a really traditional feel, something harder and harder to find in China as it’s developing so quickly. This place is as much of an experience and a food destination. The first time I came, I was so excited to find it and couldn’t stop snapping photos of the area! Not too many tourists know about it at this point, except for the occasional Chinese tourist. The cuisine is delicious here too!\n\nLocated down an old road with traditional Chinese neighbourhood buildings with no traffic, this location has a really special feel to it.\n\nThe coolest part is how a lot of the food is self serve – there is no menu, it’s served by bike! The food is loaded onto the back of a bike and then run from the kitchen to the restaurant. If you are fast enough, you can grab it right from the bike, or you just walk into the open restaurant and see what is on the table fresh from the wok. You grab it yourself and then pay afterwards. Some notable items include:\n\nFried yak meat with ginger and fresh green chilies (牦牛肉 maoniurou)\n\nExtremely fatty steamed spicy pork with pumpkin and rice flour (粉蒸肉 fenzhengrou)\n\nPig brain + tofu (豆腐脑 doufunao)\n\nYellow or white liangfen jelly with chili oil (黄凉粉 huangliangfen or 白凉粉 bailiangfen)\n\nSpicy river fish in fermented spicy broad bean paste (豆瓣鱼 Doubanyu).\n\nThere is a ton of selection. The best part is choosing whatever looks best and watching it come out from the kitchen on the back of a bicycle! After you’re finished eating, you can explore the little Sichuan tea houses to the side and sip a traditional cup of green tea with the locals.\n\nCHENSHI LIANGFEN\n\nName: 陈氏凉粉\n\nMust Order: Sichuan cuisine's wide array is all on display here – choose what looks good to you!\n\nAddress: 洞子口福德路42号- 近沙河源小学 – Hezi Kou FuDe Lu 42 Hao\n\nPrice: Around 50 RMB per person\n\nHours: Open every day 11am – 2pm and 5pm to 9pm\n\n2 Mingting Fandian – The ORIGINAL Chengdu Fly Restaurant\n\nMingting restaurant is one of Chengdu’s most famous “fly restaurants”. With hundreds of fly restaurants throughout the city, often in houses that are nearly crumbling over, and said to have questionable standards of cleanliness (the busy and famous ones actually aren’t that bad), Mingting is always ranked #1. Just like visiting Chenshi liangfen up in the north of Chengdu, coming to Mingting is a MUST. In my opinion nowadays it can barely be called a fly restaurant. It’s become so famous and has cleaned up so much that it’s more of a “wanghongdian” viral restaurant. But that’s a good thing. The flavour is still the same and you can sample so many different authentic Sichuan foods without fear. If you’re brave, you can order Mingting’s most famous dish, their doufunaohua 豆腐脑花, also known as pig brain and tofu. I was so hesitant at first. Now, after 5 years in Chengdu, I don’t think twice about slurping down a whole pig brain in one go. It’s actually very delicious!\n\nAnother famous dish to try is their delicious green chili and Sichuan peppercorn with rabbit, Xianjiao tuding 鲜椒兔丁!\n\nYou can also enjoy one of my favourite rice noodle dishes in Sichuan, the fensi lianbai 粉丝莲白. Rice noodles fried with cabbage is somehow extremely delicious!\n\nAnother special Sichuan dessert you can order is the hongtang ciba 红糖糍粑. Sweet sticky rice is deep fried in sticks and covered in an ultra sweet dark molasses. They are so delicious and satisfying!\n\nIf you’re traveling to Chengdu, make sure to come to Mingting to try out a bunch of these dishes!\n\nMINGTING FANDIAN\n\nName: 明婷饭店\n\nAddress:外曹家巷26号附16号 Waijiaojia Xiang 26 hao\n\nPrice: Approx 60 RMB per person\n\nHours: 11:00 – 21:00\n\n3 Extreme Luxury Sichuan Food at Yuzhilan\n\nIf you want to try some luxury fine dining in Chengdu, Yuzhilan is the place to be. Chef Lan has trained for over 35 years and has truly mastered the art of fine Sichuan cuisine at his home kitchen in Chengdu. Kung Pao lobster, the world’s thinnest hand cut noodles, Superior abalone, sea urchin, birds nest soup, Sichuan truffles, caviar, and eel are all available for your tasting. A reservation is a must, so your best bet is to either get a Chinese friend to call and help you, or go there one day earlier and hope for the best.\n\nCompared to other 5 star hotels in Chengdu, you get much more value here and the food is way better. A maximum of 3 or 4 groups of people can dine at once in this intimate and quiet environment. It feels like you’re entering another world! The whole experience is so peaceful and quiet and deep in Chinese culture!\n\nThe menu changes every day, but the main courses are usually similar. My favourite was the superior abalone. It was incredibly soft and I’m craving it thinking about it right now! That gravy!\n\nExpect to pay at least 1500 RMB per person. If you want to splurge, this is worth it!\n\nYou can watch the full video of eating at Yuzhilan below:\n\nYUZHILAN\n\nName: 玉芝兰\n\nComments: Must make reservation, usually one day beforehand\n\nAddress:长发街24号附1号 Changfajie 24 hao fu 1 hao\n\nPhone: 028 – 62491966\n\nPrice: 900 RMB and up\n\nHours: 12:00 – 14:30 and 18:00 – 21:30\n\n4 Whole Roast Sichuan Lamb\n\nIf you want to eat a whole roast Sichuan lamb in Chengdu, you need to come eat at Bashu Yijue Kaoquan Yang. Here, the whole bbq lamb is slathered in the most aromatic Sichuan chili oil from your dreams! It’s best to tell them a day in advance how many people you want to bring. This well let them prepare one for you. Otherwise, you can try your luck and hope they have an extra lamb going. If the language barrier is a problem, you can ask the front desk of your hotel in Chengdu to help you make the call.\n\nBASHAN YIJUE KAOQUANYANG\n\nName: 巴山一绝烤全羊\n\nMust Order: The whole lamb – kaoquanyang\n\nComments: Come with at least 3 or 4 people!\n\nAddress:高新区华府大道二段748号川西人居草坪生态园内. When you get to the main entrance, go inside and take a left all the way in until you see the yurts.\n\nPhone: 15828450818\n\nPrice: Price for a whole lamb is 800+ RMB. For a big one, you can pay around 1200 +\n\nHours: 09:00 – 00:30\n\n5 BBQ Sichuan Rabbit\n\nChengdu is famous for rabbit. You can eat it in stir fry dishes, hot pot, dry pot, and here in Yulin in the South of Chengdu, BBQ Style. This joint features a huge row of rotating rabbits that are covered in a thick sesame and chili oil and then pulled apart by pliers and covered in even more chili sauce, peanuts, and spice mix. They are actually quite satisfying to eat. And right beside the BBQ station, there is a dispensary for rabbit heads too!\n\nI must say, it’s a little bony. But that’s the way people like it here. There is still lots of flesh, but you’ll be pulling it of with your teeth.\n\nLAOHUANGJI SHOUSI KAOTU\n\nName: 老黄记手撕烤兔\n\nMust Order: The BBQ rabbit “mala” style – spicy and numbing! It's delicious!\n\nAddress:玉林街26号附19-21号 – Yulinjie 26 hao fu 19 -21 hao\n\nPrice: 45 RMB +\n\n6 Spicy Sichuan Seafood\n\nChengdu is not very famous for it’s seafood, but it’s still something you need to try when you’re here, because it’s truly unique and delicious and something you can’t get anywhere else. If you want to taste the best street style seafood, you can go to the downtown wholesale fish and seafood market in Chengdu and buy some fresh seafood like lobsters and crabs, and then walk across the street to one of the 24 hour seafood restaurants to cook it for you. I recommend asking them to cook the seafood Sichuan style for you, “chuanwei 川味”. This is all in spicy chilies and onions and Sichuan broad bean paste. I ordered a big lobster and crab from across the street!\n\nHONG TAIYANG SEAFOOD RESTAURANT\n\nName: 红太阳海鲜烧烤大排档\n\nMust Order: Sichuan flavour dishes “chuanwei 川味“\n\nComments: Recommend buying live seafood from across the street because you know it's super fresh\n\nAddress:青石桥中路8号 Qingshiqiao Zhonglu 8 hao\n\nPrice: 200 + RMB\n\nHours: 24 hours\n\n8 Sichuan Seafood Tower\n\nThis one is super delicious! We found a delicious 4 layer Sichuan meat and seafood tower in Chengdu that’s worth trying! It’s composed of Sichuan frog, chicken, beef, and shrimp and crayfish. All 4 layers are cooked in Sichuan “mala” spicy and numbing style. The flavour is spicy, fragrant, numbing, with a kick of cumin! Super delicious!\n\nLAOFOYE WAGUO\n\nName: 老佛爷炭火蛙锅\n\nMust Order: Depending on group size, you can choose 1,2,3, or 4 layers\n\nAddress:科华北路51号 Kehua Beilu 51 hao\n\nSPECIAL SICHUAN SNACKS\n\nBelow are the best places to try the most famous and delicious Sichuan snacks. In Chengdu, if you explore the back alleys, you can find a huge variety of different snacks like the ones shown below. I hope you enjoy them! You’re going to love these famous Chinese street foods!\n\n1 Chengdu's BEST Guokui Stuffed and Deep Fried Flatbread\n\nThe Guokui stuffed flatbread is a truly marvellous street food in Chengdu. It’s my go to snack if I’m craving that oily and crispy crunch on an empty stomach. One guokui can fill you up and leave you smiling. You will see this all over the street in Sichuan, but you have to go to the right place, because a bad guokui has no satisfaction!\n\nDough is rolled out into long oblong strips and then a spiced meat paste is spread over top, almost like a Turkish lahmacun or pide. The meat paste is crucial. At a good guokui joint like the one in this self guided Chengdu food tour, the meat paste is abundant and they are almost always served hot and fresh!\n\nYou can watch my favourite video about the Chinese street food below.\n\nWANGJI TESE GUOKUI\n\nName: 王记特色锅魁\n\nMust Order: Beef Guokui 牛肉锅魁 Niurouguokui, Pork guokui 猪肉锅魁 zhurouguokui, Sweet brown sugar guokui 红糖锅盔 hongtang guokui\n\nComments: Usually has a long lineup!\n\nAddress:马鞍南路100号 Ma'an Nan Lu 100 Hao\n\nPrice: 8 RMB per guokui\n\nHours: Come during lunch for the freshest guokui\n\n2 Super UNIQUE Special Stuffed Sichuan Pita\n\nIf you’re visiting Wenshu temple and trying the sweet water noodles, this stuffed pita is very near. You will recognize it by the long lineup. The owner Mrs. Yan is extremely passionate about the quality and makes the best stuffed guokui in town. There are a few varieties to try. My favourite is the spicy beef guokui – niurouguokui – 牛肉锅魁, along with the cold white jelly noodle guokui, the liangfen guokui – 凉粉锅盔. Both are fabulous!\n\nYAN TAIPO GUOKUI\n\nName: 严太婆锅魁\n\nMust Order: 1. Spicy Beef – Niurou Guokui 牛肉锅盔 2.

And over the last few years, many old style push carts and stalls have closed down, making the last remaining stall in Gongrencun neighbourhood even more special than it already is. Here, they are made the traditional way with coal, and are offered with a variety of fillings to choose from, including cream, sesame, coconut, chocolate, many different spicy vegetables like radish, carrots, seaweed, minced meat, and more. This stall has been open for decades. It’s famous for it’s “strange flavour” crepe. It’s delicious!\n\nIt goes great with a bowl of hongtang bingfen 红糖冰粉 super sweet Chinese soupy dessert. It’s really refreshing in the summer and cools you down immediately. The flavour is like a mixture between a slight Chinese medicine and brown sugar, and coca-cola.\n\nIt was a little hard for me to find the first time, but you will find it if you walk around the Gongrencun neighbourhood. It’s a neighbourhood with no car traffic in Chengdu. Once you’r close, you can show the locals the stall name and they will point you in the right direction, that’s how I found it the first time. The gongrencun 工人村neighbourhood is also a very good location for photographs and sampling other street foods along the way, there is a lot of selection! This is where I tried the pig blood soup and sweet sticky rice balls here.\n\nGONGRENCUN LUJI DANHONGGAO\n\nName: 工人村陆记蛋烘糕\n\nMust Order: 1. “Strange Flavour Guaiwei 怪味 2. Five Spice Sesame Wuxiang Zhima 五香芝麻 3. Spicy and Fragrant “Xiang La” 香辣.\n\nAddress:成都市金牛区内曹家巷工人村2栋 Chengdu Shi Jinniu Qu Nei Cao Jiaxiang Gongrencun 2\n\nHours: 12:00 – 17:30\n\n4 Delicious Sweet Sticky Rice Balls AKA Tangyouguozi\n\nThe best place to eat this amazing Sichuan snack is within walking distance to Kuanzhai Xiangzi tourist street and also close to the Chunyangguan noodle joint. It’s definitely worth walking over here after a bowl of noodles to try these delicious sweet sticky rice balls covered in a dark brown sweet molasses. They are nice and crispy on the outside and gooey and soft on the inside! There is always a lineup here!\n\nDENGJI XIN YIDAI TANGYOUGUOZI\n\nName: 邓记新一代糖油果子\n\nMust Order: Get 2 or 3 skewers of these for a real nice and sweet treat!\n\nPrice: 4 RMB per skewer\n\n5 Feichangfen Sweet Potato Starch Noodles with Intestine\n\nAny Chengdu food guide would be incomplete without featuring feichangfen 肥肠粉. While the name is unsettling for those unused to eating organs, these sweet potato starch noodles with pork intestine are an integral part of food culture in Sichuan. Therefore, if you’re wanting to tick off your list all of the main foods to try in Sichuan, you will have to try feichangfen. Which brings us to the only place you should visit if you want to try them; Ganji feichangfen. This old joint in Chengdu puts out bowl after bowl of spicy goodness. First, the base chili oil and spice mix is prepared and covered in a strong intestine broth. Then, delicious sweet potato starch noodles are boiled and poured over top. And finally, some tied up pork intestines are placed on top. If it’s your first time, get ready for something you’re either going to love or hate! The locals here all love it! It’s worth coming on over to try!\n\nGANJI FEICHANGFEN\n\nName: 甘记肥肠粉\n\nMust Order: Feichangfen. If you want to add a intestine knot, you can add a “jiezi 结子”.\n\nComments: Good to try intestines for the first time.\n\nAddress: 马鞍北路18号 Ma'an beilu 18 hao\n\nPrice: About 15 RMB per person\n\nHours: 07:30 – 20:00\n\n6 Delicious Spicy Lamb Kebabs\n\nChengdu isn’t famous for BBQ kebabs, but there are many halal restaurants run by either Hui or Uighur Chinese that have delicious Northwestern Chinese style lamb kebabs. We found a delicious BBQ kebab and flatbread restaurant in Northwest of Chengdu that is worth the ride out. It’s about a 30 minute walk from people’s park or a 15 minute drive. Make sure to order a kaobing 烤饼 flatbread to sop up the meat and juice with. You can place your meat inside the bread and it’s so delicious! The restaurant has regular lamb kebabs (羊肉串 Yangrou chuan), Tripe (大肚 dadu), tendon (羊津 yangjin), and flatbread (烤饼 kaobing). I personally always just order 20 kebabs and 2 flatbread.\n\nCHENGDU DIYIJIA ZIGE KAO YANGROU CHUAN\n\nName: 成都第一家资格烤羊肉串\n\nMust Order: Lamb Kebabs – 羊肉串 – Yangrouchuan\n\nComments: This is a late night spot. Come after 7pm and it will be more lively.\n\nAddress: 抚琴街南一巷与抚琴西南街交叉口\n\nPrice: 3 RMB per chuan\n\nHours: 16:30 – 01:30\n\nCHUANCHUAN AND MAOCAI\n\nChengdu is of course famous for hot pot. But there are similar, lesser known options that are also worth your valuable stomach space. Chuanchuan skewers and maocai spicy boiled meat and vegetables are other great options that you must try on any trip to Chengdu.\n\n1 Chengdu's Most Famous and Spicy Chuan Chuan Xiang Skewers\n\nThe concept is simple, you grab skewers of uncooked meat and vegetables from a fridge, hand them to a server, who will cook them in an extremely spicy and mouth numbing broth/oil, and serve them to you in a big bowl of that same oil. You fill up a small bowl with sesame oil, garlic, fresh chilies if you like, and vinegar. Then, pull the meat off the skewer with your chopstick and dip it in the oily goodness and enjoy! You pay afterwards based on how many skewers you ate. The spice level varies from place to place, but in general, things are pretty hot! Make sure to add lots of vinegar to your oil bowl if you want to keep cool! And drink a Chengdu soy beverage, known as weiyi 唯一豆奶. You can watch my extreme spicy Chuan chuan video below.\n\nMAOJIAOHUOLA\n\nName: 冒椒火辣\n\nMust Order: Pick whatever meats and veg you like from the fridge\n\nComments: They also have Sichuan rabbit head, pork brain, rabbit kidney, and more!\n\nAddress: 奎星楼街33号 – 近吉祥街 – Qingqulou jie 33 hao\n\nPrice: About 60 RMB per person\n\nHours: 11:30 to 2pm and 5pm to 10pm.1:30\n\n2 The best maocai stall in Chengdu\n\nMaocai and Chuan Chuan are two famous meals to have in Sichuan. They are very similar, but both worth trying, especially if you go to the right places. The concept behind maocai is simple, you choose raw ingredients that they boil them for you in a spicy broth, after which they are covered in more spicy broth and garnished with fermented black beans and green onions!\n\nThere is always a lot of selection. Just point and order what looks good to you, but at my favourite spot here in Chengdu, I always order around 10 or 20 RMB worth of beef and some tofu skin and then whatever else I’m feeling in the mood for. You can point at what you want. The bill should be around 40- 60 RMB for two people if you want to feast.\n\nThis place, known as “no name maocai” is the best place for maocai in Chengdu, opening at 10:30 and closing at 2. There is always a lineup!\n\nIt’s a little hard to find because it’s in a small little backstreet and on the bottom floor of an apartment tower, but once you find it, you’ll know! It’s just a little hole in the wall, but the flavour is awesome!\n\nWUMING MAOCAI\n\nName: 无名冒菜\n\nMust Order: The beef is delicious here, known as 冒牛肉 maoniurou.\n\nComments: There is always a lineup here\n\nAddress: 青羊区西二道街19号（金色夏威夷背后） Qingyang Qu Xierdao jie 19 hao\n\nPrice: Around 30 RMB per person\n\nHours: 10:30 am to 2pm\n\nMARKETS\n\nChengdu is full of bustling markets that sell the freshest Sichuan ingredients available. Fresh vegetables, meat, and spices are all available year round, with changes each season offering slight variations. To me, visiting markets is one of the best parts of traveling, and in Chengdu, it is a must do experience to get a feel for the local way of life.\n\n1 Supo Farmers Market\n\nOut of all the experiences you can have in Chengdu, or even in China, I recommend coming to a morning market the most. If you find a good morning market, it gives you the best possible cultural experience in China and also allows you to try some fun food too!\n\nI’ve searched and searched for good market experiences in Chengdu and have found many that are fun but only one that is a super fun experience. The others are smaller and have a less crazy feel to them. I have made 3 videos so far about this one market, you can check out part 1 here:\n\nOne of the best things to eat in this market is the roast duck. It’s incredibly cheap, usually around 20 RMB per duck, and incredibly crispy and succulent. It’s worth coming to this market alone for!\n\nSUPO FARMERS MARKET\n\nName: 成都市青羊区苏坡农贸市场内 Qingyang Qu Supo Nongmao Shichang\n\nComments: You can easily spend a whole morning here! Arrive by 830 or 9am for the best experience!\n\nIf you enjoyed this Chengdu Food Tour, I would love to hear from you in the comments below! Make sure to check out my other China food guides too!
