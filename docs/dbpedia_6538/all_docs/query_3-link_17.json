        "meta_description": "Long-term (1973 to 2010) trends in visibility at Chengdu, China were investigated using meteorological data from the U.S. National Climatic Data Center. The visual range exhibited a declining trend before 1982, a slight increase between 1983 and 1995, a sharp decrease between 1996 and 2005, and some improvements after 2006. The trends in visibility were generally consistent with the economic development and implementation of pollution controls in China. Intensive PM2.5 measurements were conducted from 2009 to 2010 to determine the causes of visibility degradation. An analysis based on a modification of the IMPROVE approach indicated that PM2.5 ammonium bisulfate contributed 27.7% to the light extinction coefficient (bext); this was followed by organic mass (21.7%), moisture (20.6%), and ammonium nitrate (16.3%). Contributions from elemental carbon (9.4%) and soil dust (4.3%) were relatively minor. Anthropogenic aerosol components (sulfate, nitrate, and elemental carbon) and moisture at the surface also were important determinants of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm, and the spatial distributions of both bext and AOD were strongly affected by regional topography. A Positive Matrix Factorization receptor model suggested that coal combustion was the largest contributor to PM2.5 mass (42.3%) and the dry-air light-scattering coefficient (47.7%); this was followed by vehicular emissions (23.4% and 20.5%, respectively), industrial emissions (14.9% and 18.8%), biomass burning (12.8% and 11.9%), and fugitive dust (6.6% and 1.1%). Our observations provide a scientific basis for improving visibility in this area.",

        "text": "3.2.1. Spatial distribution of optical bext and AOD.\n\nThe spatial distributions of surface-level optical bext and columnar AOD over Sichuan Province and the city of Chongqing during four seasons from 2009 to 2010 are presented in Fig. 4. The most distinctive feature in the plots is the apparent influence of terrain on the distributions of bext and AOD. In low-lying areas, such as the east-central part of Sichuan Province and Chongqing, both bext and AOD generally exhibited high values. In contrast, low values for these variables mostly appeared in mountainous regions west of Sichuan where the elevation is almost 10 times higher than that in the eastern-plain areas. This regional terrain impeded the transport and diffusion of air pollutant into the plains, and it contributed to the heterogeneous patterns in bext and AOD. In addition to topography, the large quantities of air pollutants emitted in the eastern part of the study area, which is densely populated and heavily developed, also contributed to the high values of bext and AOD in those areas.\n\nRight panel: light extinction coefficient (bext) estimated from Koschmiederâ€™s formula over the Sichuan Basin during March 2009 to February 2010.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068894.g004\n\nAs evident in Fig. 4, both bext and AOD also displayed significant seasonal variability. Generally, the largest seasonal difference between bext and AOD occurred in spring when high AOD values were distributed throughout the basin, but in contrast, high bext values were only concentrated around Chengdu and Chongqing. This difference was probably caused by dust events which frequently occur during this time of year [13], [36]. It is worth noting that AOD measures the vertical column-integrated extinction coefficient from the surface to the top of the atmosphere whereas bext as used here was calculated from the surface horizontal visibility using Koschmiederâ€™s formula. Consequently, the columnar AOD includes the effects of the dust particles which are mostly transported above 1 km [36] while the surface-level bext is less sensitive to that fraction of the aerosol. Except for the spring, both bext and AOD exhibited roughly similar seasonal trends, following the sequence of summer<autumn<winter.\n\nIn summer, both bext and AOD were lower than in autumn or winter. This can be explained to some extent by wet scavenging because precipitation is most frequent summer, accounting for âˆ¼55% of yearly total [35]. Wet deposition is thought to be the main way in which particles are removed from the atmosphere in the area [37], and this shortens the aerosol particlesâ€™ atmospheric lifetimes. In autumn, both bext and AOD started to increase especially in the southern part of the basin; this was most likely caused by the burning of straw, a practice used to clear agricultural fields. In winter, both bext and AOD were at their maximum, and both showed high values throughout the whole basin. These high aerosol loadings were likely the result of higher pollution emissions caused by an increase in energy consumption, especially the burning of coal and biomass for residential heating. Additionally, the occurrence of inversion layers in winter limited the advection of air pollutants, and thus meteorological conditions also probably contributed to the high bext and AODs in winter.\n\n3.2.2. Influences of chemical components on bext and AOD.\n\nAs discussed below, secondary inorganic ions (NO3âˆ’, SO42âˆ’, and NH4+) were the major light scattering components, and therefore these species were a primary concern for our study. The concentration of NH4+ was strongly correlated with SO42âˆ’ and NO3âˆ’, with correlation coefficients of 0.91 and 0.95 (not shown), respectively, suggesting that these three ions were in the form of ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), ammonium bisulfate (NH4HSO4) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). If one assumes that the dominant compounds were NH4HSO4 and NH4NO3, the NH4+ concentrations can be calculated using Eq. 9; alternatively if NH4+ were in the form of (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3, Eq. 10 would apply [38]:(9)(10)where [NO3âˆ’] and [SO42âˆ’] represent the mass concentrations of NO3âˆ’ and SO42âˆ’, respectively.\n\nA comparison of the calculated versus the observed NH4+ concentrations is presented in Fig. 5. The NH4+ concentrations calculated from both Eq. 9 and 10 showed strong correlations with the observed NH4+, but the slope from Eq. 9 was closer to unity (0.94, Fig. 5a) than that from Eq. 10 (1.41, Fig. 5b); and this indicates that the three major ions predominantly existed as NH4HSO4 and NH4NO3.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068894.g005\n\nThe IMPROVE approach (Eq. 5 to 8) was then used to partition the chemical bext and bsp,dry among the measured PM2.5 chemical components. The calculation of chemical bsp,dry was estimated from the loadings of sulfate, nitrate, OM, and soil dust when particles were not influenced by RH, that is, RH <60%. As discussed above, we can assume that NO3âˆ’, SO42âˆ’, and NH4+ mainly existed as NH4HSO4 and NH4NO3, and therefore, the concentrations of NH4HSO4 and NH4NO3 can be calculated by multiplying the SO42âˆ’ and NO3âˆ’ concentrations by factors of 1.20 and 1.29, respectively. The OM and soil dust fractions were estimated from 1.8Ã—[OC] [39] and [Fe]/0.035 [40], respectively.\n\nThe reconstructed chemical bext correlated strongly with the measured values (Fig. S2); the slope for a least-squares linear regression was 1.01, with r = 0.88. The reconstructed chemical bsp,dry correlated even better with the measured bsp,dry although the slope for that regression was farther from unity (slope = 0.81 and r = 0.96). These results show that the IMPROVE algorithm can provide reasonable estimates for chemical bext at Chengdu under both dry and ambient conditions.\n\nThe daily contributions of PM2.5 chemical components and aerosol moisture to chemical bext that were calculated using the IMPROVE approach are presented Fig. 6. The aerosol moisture contributions, in the form of scattering enhancement factors, were calculated from bext under ambient condition subtracts bext under dry condition. The average chemical bext was the highest in autumn (1224 Mmâˆ’1), followed by winter (1101 Mmâˆ’1), summer (760 Mmâˆ’1), and spring (576 Mmâˆ’1), with an annual average of 900Â±623 Mmâˆ’1. These values were much higher than those observed at Guangzhou (367 Mmâˆ’1) [41] or Jinan (292 Mmâˆ’1) [42], but similar to the value of 912 Mmâˆ’1 reported for Xiâ€™an [24].\n\nThe aerosol moisture contributions were calculated from bext under ambient condition subtracts bext under dry condition.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068894.g006\n\nIn urban atmospheres, aerosol SO42âˆ’ is formed through the oxidation of SO2 by both heterogeneous and homogeneous processes, and it is removed by both dry and wet deposition [43]. On average, NH4HSO4 was the largest contributor to scattering: it accounted for 27.7% of chemical bext, and the greatest effect was in winter (37.0%), followed by summer (31.2%), autumn (25.4%), and spring (20.0%) (Fig. 6). Although industrial SO2 emissions, which are the main source for SO2 in urban areas, showed a declining trend in Chengdu during the period of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006 to 2010), the SO2 emissions have remained high, 6.2Ã—104 tons in 2010 (see Fig. 2). Studies in Xiâ€™an [24], Jinan [42], and Guangzhou [10] have similarly shown that sulfate was the largest contributor to bext.\n\nOn average OM (21.7%) and moisture (20.6%) contributed roughly similar amounts to bext. The contribution of OM was elevated during spring (33.5%), while increased moisture contributions were found in summer (25.0%) and autumn (22.8%) due in part to the greater effects of the higher RH on the major ions. The RH averaged 80% in summer and 77% in autumn, compared to 70% in spring and 73% in winter. The NH4NO3 contributions to bext were relatively consistent throughout the year, with range for the seasonal averages of 13.6 to 19.7%. On average, particle light absorption from EC contributed just 9.4% to bext, and an even smaller percentage of bext (2.8 to 7.2%) was explained by the loadings of soil dust.\n\nWe compared the PM2.5 chemical loadings during good and poor visibility conditions by averaging the data for 2.5% of the days with the best visibility (VR >10.5 km, abbreviated as Best 2.5%) and doing the same for the 2.5% of the days with the worst visibility (VR <1.5 km, Worst 2.5%) (Table 3). The PM2.5 loadings differed by a factor of 6.3 between the Best 2.5% (63.6 Âµg mâˆ’3) and Worst 2.5% days (400.8 Âµg mâˆ’3). The concentrations of secondary inorganic ions for the Worst 2.5% were 5.7 to 10.8 times higher than during the Best 2.5%. The concentrations of OM and EC differed by 380% and 644%, respectively, between the two categories. This analysis shows that VR impairment was consistent with elevated loadings of PM2.5, especially those of the secondary inorganic ions.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068894.t003\n\nTable 4 shows the chemical bext budget for the aerosol components in the Best 2.5% and Worst 2.5% categories. The average contributions of NH4HSO4, NH4NO3, OM, and EC on bext on the Worst 2.5% days were 835, 667, 318, and 232 Mmâˆ’1, respectively; these are 3.5 to 16.1 times higher than those under the Best 2.5% conditions. The effect of moisture on bext increased from 30 to 1015 Mmâˆ’1, an increase of 34.2 times, from the Best 2.5% to Worst 2.5% conditions. The combined moisture (32.4%) and NH4HSO4 (26.7%) contributions accounted for nearly 60% of bext for the Worst 2.5% category. The results support our conclusion that increases in water vapor and large NH4HSO4 loadings were the main factors leading to visibility degradation in Chengdu on the days with the worst visibility.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068894.t004\n\nFig. 7 presents the relationship between AOD at 550 nm and bext values calculated for the chemical species and moisture. The bextâ€™s for NH4HSO4, NH4NO3, and moisture were significantly related to AOD, with probabilities for chance occurrence of less than 5% (p<0.05) and correlation coefficients of 0.71, 0.71, and 0.78, respectively. The correlations between AOD and bext caused by OM and EC were weaker, with respective r values of 0.44 and 0.65. The correlation between AOD and bext attributable soil dust was not significant, that is, p>0.05. In summary, the AODs were strongly affected by RH, but they also increased as the anthropogenic aerosol loadings increased, especially those of SO42âˆ’, NO3âˆ’, and EC (Fig. 7).\n\nThe color bars indicate the concentrations of the chemical species or relative humidity (RH).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068894.g007\n\n3.2.3. Source apportionment of PM2.5 and VR degradation.\n\nThe optical bextâ€™s estimated from VRs were highly correlated with the optical bsp,dryâ€™s measured with the use of a nephelometer (Fig. S3). The correlation coefficient for the regression of bsp,dry on bext was 0.88 and the slope was 0.83. Therefore the bsp,dry can be considered generally representative of the bext and of the VR. To further investigate the causes for the visibility degradation, PMF analyses were conducted to apportion the collocated PM2.5 chemical and optical bsp,dry data to source factors; these analyses used data for OC, EC, K+, Al, Ca, Mg, Ti, Mn, S, As, Br, Pb, Cu, and Zn. The resulting PMF factor profiles and source attributions are presented in Fig. S4, and Fig. 8 shows the average source contributions.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068894.g008\n\nFactor 1 was enriched in S, Pb, and As, and it was ascribed to coal combustion. This factor accounted for 42.3% of the PM2.5 and 47.7% of the bsp,dry. Energy consumption (including coal, petroleum and gas) in Sichuan Province increased by 38% during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, from 1.3Ã—108 tons in 2006 to 1.8Ã—108 tons in 2010. Of this, 64.4 to 74.4% was associated coal combustion [33], and it is clear that sizeable improvements in visibility would be realized if greater efforts were made to promote clean energy sources as replacements for coal.\n\nFactor 2 had high loadings of EC, OC, and Br, and this factor was interpreted as motor vehicle emissions. This source accounted for 23.4% and 20.5% of PM2.5 and bsp,dry, respectively. The total number of motor vehicles in Chengdu increased by 41%, from âˆ¼1.7Ã—106 in 2006 to âˆ¼2.4Ã—106 in 2010 [30].\n\nFactor 3 had a relatively high loadings of Zn as well as Mn, As, Br, Pb, and Cu, and this factor was most likely associated with industrial emissions; it accounted for 14.9% of PM2.5 and 18.8% of bsp,dry. Large quantities of industrial dust and soot are emitted during a variety of industrial processes, and the quantities emitted in Chengdu have been estimated to be 5.5Ã—103 and 2.9Ã—104 ton yrâˆ’1, respectively, for 2010 (see Fig. 2).\n\nFactor 4, was characterized by K+ and OC, and this is most consistent with biomass burning emissions. In nearby non-urban areas, wheat straw is burned for cooking year round, and the burning of agricultural fields takes place immediately during the harvest season [44]. This source accounted for 12.8% and 11.9% of PM2.5 and bsp,dry, respectively.\n\nFactor 5 was loaded with Al, Ca, Mg, Ti, and Mn, and it represents fugitive dust. This source accounted for only 6.6% of the PM2.5 and even less (1.1%) of the bsp,dry. This small effect was at least partly due to low wind speeds throughout the year."
