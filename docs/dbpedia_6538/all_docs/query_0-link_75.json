        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis paper proposes a new multi-attribute group decisionmaking (MAGDM) approach to conduct decision analysis with q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) information, whose weights of attributes are completely unknown, based on Frank operations and improved Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS). Firstly, we put forward the new operational laws of q-rung orthopair fuzzy number (q-ROFN) based on Frank operations. Then, we further give q-rung orthopair fuzzy Frank prioritized weighted (q-ROFFPWA) and q-rung orthopair fuzzy Frank prioritized weighted geometric (q-ROFFPWG) operator to aggregate fuzzy information effectively and study some properties of them. Furthermore, we propound an improved ARAS method to address MAGDM problem, where the weights of attributes determined through a newly defined generalized entropy. At last, we test the practicality of the proposed method by applying it to the selection of hotels for a travel company, and highlight the flexibility and superiority of this method by parameter analysis and comparative analysis.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nZadeh L A (1965).
