        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe unbalanced distribution of healthcare resources across space and healthcare levels is an important reason for disordered medical treatment [1,2]. The Hierarchical Diagnosis and Treatment (HTD) reform, which was implemented in China in 2015, aimed to improve the efficiency and equity of multilevel healthcare. Recent decades have witnessed considerable developments in urban spaces, and the methods of allocating healthcare resources must be considered based on the changing population configuration and the development of transportation in a metropolis. In these contexts, dynamic spatial equity in access to a multilevel healthcare system in a metropolis should be a focal point of scholarly attention.\n\nSpatial equity in healthcare concerns the perceived lack of fairness in the well-being of individuals and societies across space. Inequitable levels of access have important effects on health outcomes [3]. Research that investigates geographic accessibility provides a basis for optimizing the allocation of healthcare [4,5]. Geographic accessibility can be defined as the ease with which the residents in a given area can reach a particular service or facility [6], and it includes the availability of and proximity to healthcare [7]. Availability indicates that the services and facilities can meet the residents’ needs, and proximity indicates that the residents can visit the services and facilities based on their own capabilities [8]. Healthcare geographic accessibility can be influenced by many factors, such as the availability of healthcare sites in the area (supply), the population of the area (demand) and the geographic barriers between supply and demand [9].\n\nThe gravity model and the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method are the mainstream models used to assess the geographic accessibility to healthcare [10,11]. The gravity model is used to evaluate healthcare accessibility by analyzing variations in the ratio of healthcare suppliers to the population demand based on distance decay. Although the methods used to calculate the distance, population, and capacity of healthcare facilities have consistently improved, the results are not accurate due to uncertainty in the impedance coefficient [12]. The 2SFCA method is applied to evaluate healthcare accessibility by defining the range of the catchment area threshold for hospitalization and the scope of healthcare services. The basic model has undergone various incremental enhancements, including the incorporation of variable catchment sizes, distance decay effects, age-adjusted healthcare demand and multiple transport modes [5,13,14,15]. However, these measures of (equity in) accessibility in empirical health studies still tend to be conceptualized predominantly in static spatial terms. Most studies analyze the spatial distribution of people demanding healthcare based on statistical data; catchment size is often defined arbitrarily; and residents’ healthcare-seeking behaviors, such as their transportation choices and the speeds and routes, are assumed to be constrained under certain conditions [6]. Healthcare accessibility assessments are not accurate because of a lack of detailed estimates of the heterogeneity of the population distribution and residents’ dynamic spatial behavioral patterns [16]. Therefore, the need for more spatially disaggregated, individualized and temporally aware accessibility metrics has been acknowledged [17,18,19].\n\nThe accessibility to different levels of healthcare services, ranging from large comprehensive medical institutions to primary healthcare services, has been assessed [20,21,22]. Scholars have also paid attention to the different capacities of different medical institutions and have evaluated the number of doctors and hospital beds [23]. Healthcare institutions have been classified in terms of scale and service capacities, and different weights have been assigned to these institutions to evaluate the impacts of different service capacities on the healthcare service spatial distribution [24,25]. These studies provide significant insights into the spatial accessibility to healthcare from the perspective of the healthcare supply; however, residents’ multilevel healthcare demands have not been sufficiently considered. Current studies suggest that the upper levels of medical treatment can replace the lower levels [16]. In practice, however, residents should choose different levels and types of medical institutions according to their different needs, and their spatial behavioral preferences for seeking different levels of healthcare are quite different.\n\nIn the current healthcare system in China, most of patients’ access to healthcare services is not organized according to a gatekeeping system and a two-directional referral network. Therefore, upper-level hospitals are always overcrowded, while lower-level health centers have fewer patients. This situation increases medical costs, wastes healthcare resources and lowers healthcare efficiency [1,2]. Given this background, the HDT reform is considered an effective solution to defuse the antagonistic relationship between the use of healthcare resources and residents’ medical treatment demands. This reform emphasizes that residents’ different medical service demands correspond to the different levels of medical institutions. If a lack of medical services occurs at a certain level, then assessments of the accessibility to multilevel healthcare in that area should be lowered. However, previous studies have not paid sufficient attention to multilevel healthcare accessibility based on both the divergence of hierarchical healthcare supplies and variations in residents’ behavioral preferences for different types of healthcare.\n\nThis paper aims to develop an approach to provide demand-driven assessments of the spatial equity in multilevel healthcare accessibility in Chengdu, a metropolis in China. Population gridding based on night-light data was used to obtain spatially disaggregated living configurations, and the residents’ behavioral preferences obtained from a questionnaire survey and real-time travel distances provided by an electronic map navigation service were employed to obtain dynamic, accurate and individualized transportation patterns. Rather than each hospital, each level of healthcare according to residents’ different healthcare needs was utilized as the research object to evaluate the macro and systematic healthcare spatial distribution in the metropolis.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a brief introduction of the study area, the study method and the data used in this analysis. Section 3 reports the empirical results, and Section 4 make a comprehensive discussion of the results and highlights the main conclusions drawn from this study in Section 5.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe results corroborate previous findings on the unfavorable geographic conditions for nonurban dwellers in accessing healthcare services [6,22]. In addition, several points need to be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, higher-level healthcare has a lower quantity of providers and is more aggregated than lower-level healthcare; thus, evaluations of spatial equity using supply-driven methods might conclude that the higher levels of healthcare are allocated more unequally than the lower levels [28]. However, the results of this demand-driven study indicate that primary healthcare is allocated most unfairly based on the residents’ living patterns and travel distance preferences. Second, although the spatial inequity in access to multilevel healthcare evaluated based on the proportion of the population was relatively minor compared with that calculated based on the proportion of the area, a center-rich periphery-poor healthcare distribution pattern is also typical in this metropolis from the macro perspective. Moreover, this study identified many closely settled areas that are scattered in suburban and rural areas in MHSAs; therefore, arbitrarily defining different catchment sizes for rural and urban areas is not suitable for research on metropolises with large populations, varied topography, and rapidly changing urban spaces [13,29].\n\nThe main objective of the new healthcare reforms in China is to systematically optimize the spatial distribution of multilevel healthcare according to different resident demands [1,2,30,31]. The main findings of this study indicate that the equity of the multilevel healthcare service system should be improved through policies targeted at avoiding the short board effect. For instance, primary healthcare resources could be integrated and optimized across administrative regions at the boundaries of closely settled healthcare shortage areas; traffic accessibility could be improved in the suburban healthcare shortage areas to broaden the service scope of the existing medical institutions; and telemedicine and other support systems could be developed to promote high-quality medical resources in areas with larger urban agglomerations that extend to remote mountainous areas.\n\nThere are several limitations associated with this study that should also be noted. Because of data availability restrictions, we could not include the number of doctors and hospital beds in the calculations of healthcare accessibility, and such detailed data would be highly significant in evaluating healthcare access from a quality perspective. Furthermore, access to healthcare is multidimensional, and this study focused on spatial factors, but nonspatial factors, such as socioeconomic status, were not considered. Moreover, the diversification of healthcare service providers is a trend that is designed to meet the increasing needs for healthcare, but this study only assessed public healthcare institutions.\n\nFuture research efforts could focus on applying these dynamic datasets to other scenarios. For example, night-light data could be upgraded for the latest population distribution; residents’ spatial preferences could be investigated under different cultural contexts and for different healthcare demands; and real-time traffic data could be calculated via different traffic choices and for different time periods to generate additional temporal pattern estimations. A variety of socioeconomic factors, including residents’ demographic characteristics, the built environment and other local features should be considered in future studies [32]. Within the metropolitan area there is an increasing number of private hospital and rehabilitation institutions providing different types and levels of healthcare services. Similarly, the medical service demands of residents is becoming diversified. Some special medical service demands cannot be met by the traditional public hospitals, which need the supplement of private medical institutions. However, the coordination and competition between public and private medical institutions is still unclear, and private medical institutions may be concentrated in urban centers due to market allocation, which would further aggravate healthcare inequity between urban and suburban areas. The integration of these diversified entities represents an essential direction for future research [33]."
