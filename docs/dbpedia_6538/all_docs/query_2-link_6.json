        "text": "Film Lineup\n\nHere comes to the highlight of our program: we are thrilled to present you with a curated selection of six interesting and diverse short films, each crafted by the innovative minds of emerging filmmakers from Sichuan and Chongqing region.\n\n《坏掉的土豆》Broken Potato\n\nMysterious holes appear in a town, spurring crowds to pursue their desires. This metaphorical film uses the holes as various aspects of an entity, providing rich, newspaper-like information in each animated frame, which imitates the act of keeping up with the fast-paced contemporary world.\n\n《黑盒》Undetectable Box\n\nThis short film brings to life a surrealistic portrayal of a teenager's blossoming secret crush, with vivid imaginations and lively rhythms. It is a kaleidoscope that illustrates the rich, vast, and ever-changing world ensconced within a teenager’s mind, and delves deep into the realms of communication and subconsciousness, enlightening the viewer about the hidden dimensions of the human psyche.\n\n《物语》the memory of mine\n\nAmidst urbanization and historical progression, an old house that represents the ebb and flow of generational existence is facing its fate of being demolished. A mother and son revisit the house to bid farewell to their past. The film is inspired by the imminent destruction of the director's ancestral home for railway development.\n\n《熊猫熊猫》Panda Panda\n\nOn an ordinary morning, a girl experiences unexpected sexual arousal triggered by a television scene depicting the mating rituals of pandas. The film projects female desire in an extraordinarily surreal fashion and a fantastical manner.\n\n《陌路狂欢》Strangers In Paradise\n\nThe short film documents the endeavours of \"Chilldo\", a Chengdu-based underground party collective dedicated to creating LGBTQ+ friendly events in southern Chinese cities. As the curtains fell on the year 2020, they leaped into the embrace of the new year.\n\n《相聚一刻》Water Under the Bridge\n\nTwo girls, back in their hometown of Yibin, forge an unexpected connection through a Tinder match. Through the lens of the female director, she wants to explore intimate female dialogues and bonds, and contemplate an existential query: will the world change us, or will we change ourselves?"
