A great honour for us and the people who work in our plants and whose efforts and ideas for sustainable industrial production are making an impact. Let us tell you how we did it and give you some details on four key use cases. The Siemens Electronics Works in Chengdu, China, has received the designation Sustainability Lighthouse from The World Economic Forum (WEF). This is the second time a Siemens production facility has been conferred with the title â€“ the first was the Electronics Works in Amberg, Germany, in early 2023.",
