This is what we paid when we stayed at this hotel.\n\nRates can vary widely by room type and season. \"We Paid\" is intended to give a general sense of price, but you might find considerably different rates for your trip.\n\nWhen we book, we aim for the optimum season for the destination, but we avoid holidays and major public events, when prices are highest. We generally book a room at one category up from the most basic.\n\nWe take advantage of promotional rates, when possible. That means the rate you see above might have included other benefits, such as spa or meal credits."
