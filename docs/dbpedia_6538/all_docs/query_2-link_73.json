You may be more curious and alert than you usually are so use this heightened energy to enhance your studies as well as your cultural and geographical explorations. You may also encounter different teaching styles and course processes; be prepared to adapt and to learn.\n\nAcademics\n\nYou will enroll in 12 to 18 credits per semester comprised of language courses plus electives in Chinese culture and international relations. All students must complete a minimum of one language course, although we strongly encourage students to complete an entire language track. Course availability is contingent upon student enrollment and is subject to change.\n\nClick the course title to view course details, description, and availability.\n\nChinese Language Tracks\n\nUSAC offers intensive language courses grouped into tracks in which courses are taught sequentially (back to back) within one semester. If you have already taken the first course in a track, you do not have to take it again for credit, but you must audit it to be prepared for success at the next level. Language courses are small and typically have a maximum enrollment of 15 students each. Students who do not enroll in a language track must take Elementary Chinese I to assimilate more effectively into Chinese culture and their new living and learning environment.\n\nLanguage Courses\n\nSpring\n\nChinese World Languages and Literatures 100-level 4 credits Taught in Chinese\n\nThis introductory course in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin) language is designed for beginners of Chinese study.
