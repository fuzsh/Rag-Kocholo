        "text": "In this study, effects of Bi3+ substitution upon microwave dielectric properties of the (Cr0.5Nb0.5)4+ replaced Ba3.75Nd9.5Ti18O54 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) ceramic have been reported. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) result shows a single phase for all compositions with peak position fluctuation. Within the whole x range, while the quality factor (Q) is degraded, the dielectric constant (ε r) can be improved by as high as 32% and the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (τ f) is tailored from around +40 ppm/°C to the vicinity of zero. Considering practical requirements, we can obtain a series of temperature-insensitive ceramics (τ f ∼ 0 ppm/°C) with relative permittivity about 95 and Qf (defined as Q times the resonant frequency f) higher than 6000 GHz. They have the potential of being utilized in wireless microwave communication applications."
