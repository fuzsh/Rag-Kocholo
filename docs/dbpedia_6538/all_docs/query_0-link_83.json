Over the decades, China has successfully established a relatively sophisticated system for radiopharmaceutical production and management, supported by state-of-the-art facilities. With the rapid growth of the national economy, the radiopharmaceutical market in China is expanding at a remarkable pace. This burgeoning market has led to an escalating demand for clinical-stage radiopharmaceuticals, either produced domestically or imported. Despite this positive trajectory, the development and application of radiopharmaceuticals in China have been hindered by several challenges that persist, such as inadequate research, insufficient investment, limited availability of radionuclides, shortage of trained personnel in related fields, and imperfections in policies and regulations. In an exciting development, the regulation reforms implemented since 2015 have positively affected China’s drug regulatory system. The introduction of the “Mid- and Long-Term Development Plan (2021–2035) for Medical Isotopes” created concurrently an opportune environment for the advancement of innovative radiopharmaceuticals. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the approval process for novel radiopharmaceuticals by the National Medical Products Administration and the status of radiopharmaceuticals in research and development in China. Preclinical development and clinical translation of radiopharmaceuticals are undergoing rapid evolution in China. As practitioners in the field in China, we provide several practical suggestions to stimulate open discussions and thoughtful consideration.\n\nradiopharmaceuticals\n\nNMPA\n\ndrug approval\n\ndiagnosis\n\ntherapy\n\nRadiopharmaceuticals are compounds that contain radionuclides or their labeled ligands, and they are widely used in tumor diagnosis and treatment, myocardial imaging, early detection of neurodegenerative diseases, and imaging of inflammatory diseases, among other uses. In 2020, the global market size of radiopharmaceuticals was $5.9 billion, with radioactive diagnostic drugs accounting for 90% of the market. The corresponding market size in China was approximately ¥4.456 billion (∼$624 million), accounting for about 8% of the global radiopharmaceutical market (1). With the popularization of SPECT, PET, and PET/CT, research and development of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals represented by 99mTc-, 18F-, or 68Ga-labeled agents have advanced rapidly, especially of positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals. Almost 10 y after the discovery of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as the first 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)–positive prostate cancer in the United States in 2020 (2). This means that the clinical potential of targeted radiopharmaceuticals is rapidly transforming into a clinical practicality. In recent years, with the rapid development of targeted ligands and the widespread application of new medical radionuclides, therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals have attracted more attention. 153Sm, 89Sr, 223Ra, 90Y, 131I, 177Lu, 225Ac, and other radionuclides are commonly used to treat cancer bone metastases, liver cancer, thyroid cancer, and other malignant conditions, and they have shown enormous therapeutic potential. In March 2022, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (3), which demonstrated good clinical therapeutic efficacy and tolerance (4,5).\n\nRadiopharmaceuticals were developed in China in the late 1950s, with industries mainly distributed in Beijing, Chengdu, and Shanghai. After more than 60 y of development, a relatively complete system for the research and development, production, supply, and clinical application of radiopharmaceuticals has been established. Nevertheless, the radiopharmaceutical industry in China started late and is still in a rapid development stage, with gaps remaining in several aspects in China compared with developed countries. In recent years, the development and supply of radionuclides and radiopharmaceuticals have progressed rapidly. China has successively formulated and introduced multiple policies to promote the healthy development of the radiopharmaceutical industry, with an overall tone of strict supervision. In China, most radiopharmaceuticals used in clinical practice are generic drugs, with diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals as the mainstays of clinical use and research. The number of innovative therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is limited, and radiopharmaceuticals with global intellectual property rights are countable. Although the development of radiopharmaceuticals has similarities to drug discovery, significant differences allow a faster, safer, and more cost-effective route for progressing radiolabeled molecules into human studies (6–8). This review aims to provide an overview of the process for acquiring National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approval for an innovative radiopharmaceutical in China and discuss the current status of research and development of radiopharmaceuticals in China.\n\nREFLECTIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS IN CHINA\n\nAfter a series of significant events and the introduction of pertinent regulations and policies, China’s radiopharmaceutical industry is embarking on a historic new stage. It is undeniable that China faces a challenge in developing independent and original radiopharmaceuticals, with a reliance on imported medical radionuclides so far. Concerted efforts are required to address this, including the continuous training of young professionals in related fields, such as radiochemistry, nuclear medicine, and molecular imaging. Further critical steps include fostering domestic and international collaboration for the cultivation of nuclear medicine practitioners, encouraging sustained investment in basic research and translational studies, optimizing sincere cooperation among disciplines and departments, increasing deployment of imaging equipment and cyclotrons (some capable of producing radiometals on a small scale), integrating contract research organizations for the production of radiopharmaceuticals, improving the logistics system for transporting radiopharmaceuticals, and refining the approval and supervision processes for radiopharmaceuticals. These steps will collectively expedite the healthy development, approval, and use of innovative radiopharmaceuticals in China. Ultimately, only radiopharmaceuticals that effectively tackle unmet clinical challenges will successfully integrate into routine clinical practices. Given the unique properties of radiopharmaceuticals, careful consideration and reassessment before their commercialization are imperative.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the past decade, China has improved its drug regulatory landscape to accelerate the acquisition of new drugs that address unmet medical needs, leading to the rapid development of radiopharmaceuticals in China. With the joint efforts of radiopharmaceutical research and development institutions, enterprises, commercial investors, and the nuclear medicine community, the development and approval of radiopharmaceuticals in China will steadily increase under the guidance and supervision of national regulatory authorities. The development and use of radiopharmaceuticals in China will contribute to the growth of nuclear medicine worldwide and improve the management of human diseases in the era of precision medicine.\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant 2020YFA0909000), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 82372014 and 82302236), and the Shen Kang–United Imaging Joint Research and Development Plan (grant SKLY2022CRT301).
