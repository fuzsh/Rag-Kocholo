        "text": "Based on the single scattering model of coda power spectrum analysis, digital waveform data of 50 events recorded by the real-time processing system of the Chengdu telemetry network are analyzed to estimate the Q c values of earth medium beneath the Chengdu telemetry network for several specified frequencies. It is found that the Q c shows the frequency dependency in the form of Q c = Q 0 f n in the range of 1.0 to 20.0Hz. Estimated Q 0 ranges from 60.83 to 178.05, and n is found to be 0.713 to 1.159. The average value of Q 0 and n are 117 and 0.978 respectively. This result indicates the strong frequency dependency of the attenuation of coda waves beneath the Chengdu telemetry network. Comparing with the results obtained in other regions of the world, it is found that Q 0 âˆ’1 value and its change with frequency are similar to those in regions with strong tectonic activity."
