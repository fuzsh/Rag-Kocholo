        "meta_description": "Data about human trajectories has been widely used to study urban regions that are attractive to researchers and are considered to be hotspots. It is difficult, however, to quantify the function of urban regions based on the varieties of human behavior. In this research, we developed a clustering method to help discover the specific functions that exist within urban regions. This method applies the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to classify regions’ inflow and trip count characteristics. It regroups these urban regions using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) clustering method based on those typical characteristics. Using a large amount of vehicle trajectory data (approximately 1,500,000 data points) in the Chinese city of Chengdu, we demonstrate that the method can discriminate between urban functional regions, by comparing the proportion of surface objects within each region. This research shows that vehicle trajectory data in different functional urban regions possesses different time-series curves, while similar types of functional regions can be identified by these curves. Compared with remote sensing images and other statistical methods which can provide only static results, our research can provide a timely and effective approach to determine an urban region’s functions.",

        "text": "3.1 Gaussian mixture model based region aggregation\n\nTrip count is a useful characteristic to identify functional regions. From vehicle trajectory data, we can extract human flow by counting each region’s rate of pick-ups and drop-offs for people within a designated unit of time. Intuitively, we can use some simple methods, instead of the density calculation, such as counting the number of points in a region or a buffering area. These counting methods could raise bias, however, so it is recommended to use density to make a time series [26]. In this study, we divided the urban region into irregular regions. Crowd density was used as the main characteristic in order to be able to generalize. For each hour, for seven days, we computed the density of pick-up and drop-off points in the study area as shown below. The unit of area is in square kilometers.\n\n(1)(2)\n\nM is the collection of regions. N is the collection of pick-up/drop-off points at all times. βx is a set of pick-up/drop-off points that belongs to N during the time period x. Si is the area of region i. P(i,j) indicates whether the j point falls in region i.\n\nFor further analysis, DNpick−on(i) represents the density of pick-up points in region i, and DNdrop−off(i) represents the number of people getting off the bus per unit area of region i.\n\n(3)(4)\n\ninflow(i) represents the inflow density of region i, whose value changes with time, indicating the density of people flowing in from the region during each set time period. Its values can be positive or negative. Positive means inflow, and negative means outflow. In the same way, tripcounts(i) represents the trip count of region i. Both inflow(i) and tripcounts(i) can be thought of as a region’s time-series characteristics.\n\nAccording to the equations above, we can calculate the time-series characteristic curve based on the pick-up and drop-off points of different regions. Fig 2 shows a sample of more than four characteristics, which includes pick-up, drop-off, inflow, and trip count. It can easily determine that the inflow and trip count characteristics are more distinct than the pick-up and drop-off curve. Thus, these two characteristics are more useful to extract the region’s spatial patterns.\n\nWe assume that many regions have similar time-series characteristics. Therefore, the next step is to separate these regions into different groups. Different clustering algorithms have different advantages and usage scenarios. The probability of each sample for each category will be calculated which will help us determine the region’s aggregation. Each sample is a part of a certain cluster. A part of a certain type of sample constitutes a distribution of that cluster. As a result, GMMs are widely used in data mining. They are a semi-parametric technique for estimating probability density functions [27]. This algorithm only maximizes the probability. It does not make the mean approach zero, nor does it make the clustering class appear as special structures that may or may not be applicable [28]. GMM can output data points belonging to a certain type of probability, so the output information is much richer. The output of a GMM is the weighted sum of R component densities, as shown in Fig 3.\n\nGiven a set of N independent and identically distributed patterns χi = {x(t);t = 1,2,3…,N} associated with class ωi, we assume that the class likelihood function p(x(t)|ωi) for class ωi is a mixture of Gaussian distributions, i.e., the principal components F1 to F5 are independent and identically distributed patterns. We can put the each component into this formula as x(t) after dimensions reduction, (5) where Θr|i represents the parameters of the rth mixture component, R is the total number of mixture components, p(x(t)|ωi,Θr|i)≡N(μr|i,∑r|i) is the probability density function of the rth component, and p(x(t)|ωi) is the prior probability (also called mixture coefficients) of the rth component. Typically, N(μr|i,∑r|i) is a Gaussian distribution with mean μr|i and covariance ∑r|i.The training of GMMs can be formulated as a maximum likelihood problem where the mean vectors {μr|i}, covariance matrices {∑r|i}, and mixture coefficients {P(Θr|i|ωi)} are typically estimated by the EM algorithm.\n\nThe dataset of inflow and trip count after dimension reduction are independent and identically distributed patterns, so we can place them into the formula above, as x (t). Meanwhile, we will determine the number of R clusters by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) calculation [29]. Thus we can calculate each cluster’s contribution P(Θr|i|ωi) to the dataset and the probability density function p(x(t)|ωi,Θr|i) in the rth cluster. We then get the sum of the mixture of Gaussian distributions of the R cluster to get the p(x(t)|ωi). Finally, the probability of each sample for each cluster will be obtained which will help us for determining the region aggregation.\n\n4.1 Region aggregation results\n\nAs described in Section 3, before running the GMM, we first need to define some parameters. When a dataset contains a large number of attributes open to inference attacks, we face a choice of either completely suppressing most of the data or of losing the desired level of anonymity [32]. This experiment used a week's worth of data, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The total dimension of inflow and trip count characteristics is 336, which will be used in the next step. It must be taken into consideration that many dimensions are useless. For example, there are few pickups and drop offs of people between 12 am to 6 am. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be applied to extract the main characteristics from this high-dimensional dataset [33]. The cumulative distribution function of the percentage of variance explained by each selected component is shown in Fig 4. We chose to keep 90% of the variance, with the result that we had five principal components. The dataset after dimension reduction would be used for region aggregation.\n\nAs a complex algorithm, GMM also has some attributes that must be determined before it is run. First, it is important to determine the number of original centers of clustering. Some researchers used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to find the fittest model to approximate the distribution of the instances [29]. BIC is a measure of the model's fitting degree and complexity. The larger the value, the worse the model's fit. The smaller the value, the better the model’s fit. Another parameter is the covariance of the different classes estimated method, such as spherical, diagonal, tied, or full covariance [28]. The covariance type in the GMM model controls the shape freedom of each cluster. To determine the most suitable covariance type, we calculated BIC values for different covariance patterns with different components. The results are shown in Fig 5.\n\nIn Fig 5, the horizontal axis represents the clusters, the different colors of the columns represent different covariance model of BIC scores. In this plot, \"*\" marks the location of the column where many of the best components are, as well as the best type of covariance BIC score. Finally, when the covariance model is \"diag\" and components equal 16, the BIC scored lowest. We obtained the vehicle trajectory clustering statistics by incorporating these parameters into the GMM clustering model, as shown in Table 5. The clusters are labeled from C0 to C15. Except for some clusters with a few counts, most remain above 100, and some nearly 500. The result is also mapped as shown in Fig 6.\n\nIn addition, we compare the GMM-based algorithm with a K-means algorithm, which is in the original research [19]. Different urban segmentation methods are also used to test the clustering results shown in Fig 7. It contains four types of division methods: (1)300m×300m cells; (2)500m×500m cells; (3)1km×1km cells; and (4) segmentation with road network. It shows the obvious conclusion that the divided urban areas are more well-distributed by the GMM-based method in all types. It can decrease the cell size to improve the clustering result, but another problem is that many empty value cell will be generated if the size is too small, a situation that can be found in Fig 7B and 7C. Furthermore, as is the case for both the grid and road network division methods, the different types of areas in suburban regions are still hard to distinguish by the use of K-means. It may imply that the GMM with the road network divide method can play a better role in performing a functional region analysis.\n\nCompare the GMM-based region clustering algorithm with K-means algorithm: (a) K-means clustering with 1km×1km cells; (b) K-means clustering with 500m×500m cells; (c) K-means clustering with 300m×300m cells; (d) K-means clustering with road network segmentation; (e) GMM based clustering with 1km×1km cells; (f) GMM based clustering with 500m×500m cells; (g) GMM based clustering with 300m×300m cells; (h) GMM based clustering with road network segmentation.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215656.g007\n\n4.3 Urban region function analysis\n\nIn order to explore the variability of the seven groups, we further investigated their main function with POIs. People usually travel to different POIs for different kinds of activities. Therefore, different types of POIs reflect particular urban functions [10]. We propose that the density and ratio of POIs can be used to divide regions into different types. After deriving the clusters above, each cluster needs to have its main function confirmed with POIs. The same types of POIs can be located in different region types, but the same region types may have the similar, main POIs types most of the time [34]. For example, the resident regions’ main POIs are house and apartment while commercial regions’ main POIs are mall, market, and shop. In order to understand the functions within each group, we use the frequency average density (FD) and category ratio (CR) to identify it as below: (7) (8)\n\nWe assume that POIs here can be separated into k types, ni is each type of POI count in the region j. Sj means the area of region j. FDij represents the density of the i type of POIs in the j region. CRij represents each type of POI density ratio in the region j. We can use CRij to identify the group’s main function. As a result, we can calculate the mean FD and mean CR of each group which we aggregated before. In Fig 11, we show the top 10 ratios of each group.\n\nChengdu is a state tourist city. Therefore, food and shopping POIs are obviously larger than other POIs. However, other types of POIs in a group can indicate the distinction as shown in Fig 11. To understand descriptive characteristics of the urban region function within each group, we computed the average of each cluster’s inflow and trip count. The results are elaborated in Fig 12. Based on Figs 11 and 12, we interpret the group function as follows.\n\nUnder G1, the density of each type of POI is the lowest among all groups which means the living population there is very small. From the map, we can see that G1 is distributed around the 4th ring of Chengdu which is far from the center of city. There are many mountains and forests in this group. From Fig 8, the trip count of G1 are less than 1 per square kilometer, which means that this group is visited by few people using taxis. Another issue is that the trip count value in this group has more peaks in the afternoon than other groups. The extreme values for every day appeared from 12 pm to 5 pm. People usually travel for recreation at those times and seek leisure pursuits at these places until night. We can confirm that the main function of this group is the trip to the country.\n\nActivities in G2 involve shopping, food, live, resident and transport as the main POIs. These POIs are also in the other groups, so it is difficult to distinguish one from another based on the type. We can discover, however, the function from the inflow curve shown in Fig 9. The inflow curve is a negative value from 6 am to 7 pm and is positive from 8 pm to 5 am. Of special interest is the fact that the value is approximately zero after 1 am. The inflow curve reflects that many people visit another region during working hours, and return after work. Meanwhile, it can be seen that the value in the morning is larger than in the evening, which means people like to take a vehicle for work in emergency circumstances but return home using other transportation. As a result, the main function is resident, based on the inflow curve analysis.\n\nFrom the inflow curve, we see that G3 is also a mixture regions, similar to G2. The special feature of G3 is that it has business and accommodate in this group, with a ratio higher than that of G2 but lower than that of G4. This feature means G3 is a transitional region between G2 and G4. On the map, we can see they are mainly distributed around G2 and G4, and the areas around G1 and G2 are the suburban centers.\n\nThe trip count in G4 is much greater than in the previous group. The inflow curve is positive from 7 am to 11 am, and the peak time is at 9 am. It is the time period when people come to work. Thus, the characteristic means that many people work there. The shopping and business ratio is also the largest in all of the groups. It is definite that the main function of this group is a business area.\n\nG5 and G6, are both special groups. There is only one region in these two groups. Trip count in G5 show that a large number of people take vehicles here starting at 10 am. The inflow can show us that it has positive value from 9 am to 4 pm, and negative value after 4 pm. Considering that there is an extremely large number of shops in this region, the group’s main function is shopping. The inflow curve of G6 is positive all day. From the POI ratio, we can find that there are many shops, food, and transport facilities here. It became evident that this region has a great deal of convenient transportation. In fact, we can see that G5 is a well-known shopping place, named Chunxi Road, and G6 is the Chengdu Railway Station.\n\nAs for the last group, G7 also has large number of people that visit there which can be seen from the trip count and inflow characteristics. From the POI ratio, we can see that the culture and shopping ratio are the predominant types. The inflow curve shows that the highest inflow value occurs after 11 am. The overall value of the curve increases sharply during the weekend. All of those factors indicate that G7 is a tourist group. In fact, the OSM shows some landmarks in this group such as the Temple of the Marquis, the Wide and Narrow Valley, etc. All of these locations contain sites of historical interest."
