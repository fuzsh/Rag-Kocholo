        "text": "The masterclass represents the industry’s foremost extensive gemstone mining and jewellery appreciation experience. As a world-leading responsible miner and marketer of coloured gemstones, and majority owner of the Montepuez ruby mine, Gemfields was well positioned to host this, and GUILD – the first and only international gemmological institute in China, widely recognised for its excellence – makes the perfect partner.\n\n“As a leader and innovator in the coloured gemstone industry, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to partner with the GUILD Institute of Gemology to bring the Gemfields Coloured Gemstone Masterclass to China. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive learning experience for consumers and to raise public awareness of the coloured gemstone industry,” said Gemfields CEO Sean Gilbertson.\n\nGemfields and GUILD have been working together on ruby masterclasses since 2019; the Chengdu edition is the first for the city and follows on from gem masterclasses held previously in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. These informative and immersive sessions have been widely praised by the media.\n\nAssociated with passion, prosperity and protection, rubies have been cherished by everyone from ancient warriors to Hindus and, of course, the Chinese, and are a firm favourite with the A-listers of today, often gracing the red carpet. Some of the largest, most exceptional rubies ever seen have originated from Montepuez, including an extraordinary pair unearthed in June 2022, weighing in at 61.50 carats in the rough.\n\nIn addition to their size, rubies from Montepuez are known for their highly prized vivid red hue and crystalline lustre. Alongside mining and marketing these exceptional gems, Gemfields is committed to demystifying them and pioneering efforts to raise public understanding of their qualities and the importance of responsible mining, making them accessible to a wider audience."
