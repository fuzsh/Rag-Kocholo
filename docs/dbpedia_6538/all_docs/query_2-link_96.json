        "text": "Your Complete Guide to Maths in Chinese\n\nMaths – a word that brought despair to so many of us back in our school days. So just to bring back those harrowing memories we thought we’d give numbers another chance and teach you about Maths in Chinese!\n\nWe’ll try not to get too technical but the fact is… some of us just loved the numbers at school (yes, I’m one of those I’m afraid – it was the only subject I was any good at)!\n\nFIRST AND FOREMOST…\n\nIf you don’t know the numbers in Chinese, this is kind of crucial so let’s get you on refreshed…\n\nSECONDLY – if you want to discover more about numbers, like the numbers up to 100, and how to apply numbers in everyday Chinese (think birthdays, phone numbers etc), go check out our numbers in Chinese guide.\n\nIt’s as thorough as any other guide on the net.\n\nFINALLY – this is more a bonus, but if you want to get the big numbers in Chinese down… check this quick guide out.\n\nOK – now you’re up to speed and ready to hit the ground running, let’s get started.\n\nMaths in Chinese – Key Words & Basics\n\nMaths in Chinese – Fractions\n\nMaths in Chinese – Decimals\n\nMaths in Chinese – Percentages\n\nMaths in Chinese – Further Vocab\n\nMaths in Chinese – FAQ’s\n\nBONUS – Take our FREE Quiz\n\nMaths in Chinese – Key Words & Basics\n\nFirstly we should learn the word for Maths itself\n\nMaths in Chinese is 数学 shùxué. Literally number study.\n\nNow for some more useful Maths in Mandarin vocab!\n\nSo there’s 10 basic Maths words in Chinese alongside our actual word for Maths means we have… hold on… 11 nailed already (good maths)!\n\nNow let’s apply these to some sentences:\n\n1 + 1 = 2\n\n1 加 1 等于 2\n\n1 jiā 1 děng yú 2\n\n2 + 6 = 8\n\n2 加 6 等于 8\n\n2 jiā 6 děng yú 8\n\n4 x 5 = 20\n\n4 乘以 5 等于 20\n\n4 chéng yǐ 5 děng yú 20\n\n10.5 – 3.5 = 7\n\n10点5 减 3点5 等于 7\n\n10 diǎn 5 jiǎn 3 diǎn 5 等于 7\n\nDivide is an interesting example because it can be expressed in two ways:\n\nLet’s take 28 ÷ 7 = 4…\n\n28 除以 7 等于 4\n\n28 chú yǐ 7 děng yú 4\n\n7 除 28 等于 4\n\n7 chú 28 děng yú 4\n\nSee the difference?\n\nWhen expressing it as we would in English we use 除以 but we can also write the sum as 7 / 28 = 4. In this instance we then only use 除.\n\nMaths in Chinese – Fractions\n\nTime to move onto fractions in Chinese…\n\nFraction in Chinese is 分数 fēnshù. Literally seperate number.\n\nNOTE – when speaking about fractions we read from top to bottom, in English we’d say:\n\nOne Third – but in Chinese we swap it round and read the denominator (thee bottom number) first – sānfēn zhīyī\n\nEvery fraction must include the 分之 to denote it is indeed a fraction.\n\nPretty simple, right?!\n\nTransport in Chinese 🚚 Your Complete Guide to 37 Forms of Transport\n\n37 Forms of Transportation in Chinese || Plus FREE Vocab Quiz! Ready to learn about transport in Chinese? Choo, choo… here comes another vocabulary blog. In today’s edition we focus on all forms of transport in Chinese. We aren’t just…\n\nMaths in Chinese – Decimals\n\nThis is nice and simple and doesn’t require too much of an explanation so we’ll keep it short and sweet.\n\nIn English for a decimal we say 1 POINT 5.\n\nIn Chinese we simply use the word we already learnt above for point – diǎn 点. Which means Decimal in Chinese is simply diǎn 点.\n\nSo some example of decimals in Chinese in action…\n\nNotice we don’t say Zero point Twenty Five, but Zero Point Two Five – again, the same in English\n\nMaths in Chinese – Percentages\n\nPercentage in Chinese is 百分之 bǎi fēn zhī. Literally 100 separate.\n\nPercentages work similarly to fractions – you have to think backwards.\n\nSo rather than say 80%, in Chinese we always say %80…\n\nExample – 60 Percent in Chinese is 百分之六十\n\n44 Words You Have to Know Relating to Money in Chinese\n\n44 Must Know Money Words in Mandarin 💰 Money in Chinese Show me the money in Chinese!
