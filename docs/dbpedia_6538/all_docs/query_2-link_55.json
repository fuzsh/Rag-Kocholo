        "text": "“This meeting could have been an email” As you review your diary this morning, you’re probably thinking “I wish I didn’t have to attend this meeting… it will be a waste of time.” Maybe you're even reading this post while attending a meeting that's wasting time. It’s not that you’re looking to skip out on work like some modern-day workplace Ferris Bueller… There’s just too much demanding your attention… and with a recent Harvard Business Review survey showing 71% of business executives saying meetings are unproductive and inefficient, we’re all victims of bad meeting organizers and over-subscribed schedules. What if I could attend the meeting but skip it without you noticing? What if I could listen to everything that was said but in ½ the time the actual meeting takes? What if I could get the written synopsis without taking notes? What if I can do my job and be Ferris Bueller too? Turns out I can… a new #artificialintelligence #technology appropriately named Beulr was created by a college student so he could sleep in during those early morning hours but still get the benefit of the class. Beulr automatically joins the meeting as a participant and provides a video recording of the meeting (that you can play back at 2x the speed) as well as a full transcript. Best of all, Beulr can pull a Ferris Bueller and attend the meeting as me… Eliminating meeting inefficiencies? Giving me better control of my schedule? Enabling me to get more done? Sign me up. No really, I signed me up… Now, I can attend more of your meetings… while I sleep in, I mean do more meaningful #work and just efficiently skim the summary of your meeting later… Now to all the JLL people... is that “really” me in your meeting? Or am I using AI technology to create efficiencies by pulling a Ferris Bueller? https://yhoo.it/3JSkgOJ"
