        "text": "5.0/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nPosted on Aug 3, 2024\n\nThe room is large and sanitary, with self-service laundry and drying, which is convenient and fast. The front desk solves problems promptly. Opposite is the Wuliguan Old Hot Pot Restaurant and Kuixinglou Street. It is not far from the airport, subway station, high-speed rail station, and Taikoo Li. Recommended!\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Thank you for your full-score evaluation. Your recognition is the driving force for our progress. Sometimes, what is unforgettable at first sight is not necessarily luxury and cumbersomeness, but the warmth close to the heart. Making ordinary details exquisite and serious will form great power. We are willing to be the guardian of warmth and simplicity in the modern hurried life. You will come, and we will always be there!\n\n5.0/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nPosted on Jul 28, 2024\n\nAtour Hotel is right at the intersection of Kuixinglou Street. It has an excellent geographical location. There are endless delicious food on the whole street. Opposite is Wuliguan Hotpot. The hotel service is very thoughtful, and there is porridge in the evening. I will come again next time!\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Thank you for commenting on our website in your busy schedule. Your support and affirmation is our greatest motivation. With your support, we will continue to work hard to do better. Finally, all of us wish you and your family a happy life and look forward to your next visit! We are waiting for your arrival.\n\n5.0/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nPosted on Jul 16, 2024\n\nThe room is in a great location. Next to it is Kuixinglou Food Street. Opposite is the popular hot pot restaurant. The hotel service is good. It is relatively quiet.\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Thank you for commenting on our website in your busy schedule.

Across the street is the Wuliguan Hotpot Kuixinglou store. Every day from the hotel room, you can see a bunch of people queuing across the street. There are many delicious foods around, and basically no bad ones. It is not close to the subway station, but the bus is still very convenient. It is very convenient to go to People's Park, Chunxi Road, Kuanzhai Alley, and Du Fu Thatched Cottage. The egg baked cakes on Kuixinglou Street are delicious, and the children go there every day. The only drawback is that the button of the toilet in the room we stayed in was too difficult to press, and the children couldn't press it. There is a panda keychain for check-in. Send a panda jewelry for checking in on Xiaohongshu. This is good.\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\n2.3/5\n\nPosted on Jul 7, 2024\n\nThe sundeck is leaking, the toilet is small, the phone is dusty, the soundproofing is very poor, you can hear people walking in the corridor, the room type booked is on the second floor, the room is a connecting room, there is a room without a window, it feels very depressing when you come in, the room next to it has a window, but it is not very bright, the bed is collapsed, and it creaks when you turn around, the experience is very bad, it is not recommended for people with children to stay! In addition, we went out to eat hot pot on the day of check-in and came back after 11 o'clock in the evening. The only light in the whole hotel was on at the front desk, it was dark, and it felt very unfriendly!\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\n5.0/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nPosted on Jun 26, 2024\n\nThe hotel is very good. Opposite is Kuixinglou Street, where there are many places to eat. The hotel breakfast basically changes every day. A few days ago, there was a waffle maker that you can make yourself, which is very good. The hotel is well maintained, very new, very clean, and the TV can be projected. I really recommend it to friends who come to play~ The only drawback may be that the front desk brother and sister are not very experienced. When checking in, they did not take the initiative to mention the breakfast time and dining location. Later, I forgot to put the takeaway I bought into the robot. Fortunately, I didn’t wait until I came down to the front desk to find it before I got it. I hope the brother and sister can accumulate more of these experiences^_^ I will stay here again next time I come to Chengdu\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Thank you for your full-score evaluation.

You will come, and we will always be there!\n\n5.0/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nPosted on Jun 22, 2024\n\nThe city view room is pretty good, with a large area and separate wet and dry areas. There seems to be only one city view room on each floor. Opposite is Kuixinglou Street. I stayed for three days and two nights and didn't finish eating on that street. It's really convenient. I went there directly if I wanted to have a midnight snack. The hygiene is also good and clean. The service attitude is good. The water was delivered quickly after I asked for it. It is also very safe. You can only go to the floor corresponding to the room card. The delivery is also done by a robot. Although there is a hot pot restaurant opposite, the sound insulation is still good. Disadvantages, the water tank may have broken during the days I stayed there? The water flow in the wash basin is very thin and has been under maintenance. The water supply was cut off just after I took a shower, and there was no advance notice. What if I took a shower halfway? There is no overhead shower, but it is quite clean.\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Oh my, you have praised all the advantages of our family, so shy!!! I hope to receive more compliments like this. I am sorry that the water tank problem has brought you a bad experience. Since it was an emergency, Duoer did not expect it. Duoer also wishes you a pleasant journey and welcomes you to come again next time.\n\n4.7/5\n\nAmazing\n\nPosted on Jun 11, 2024\n\nThe location is good, close to Kuanzhai Alley, and opposite the delicious Wuliguan Hotpot Restaurant. However, the parent-child room is small, and the bathroom is right at the entrance. The air conditioner is not sensitive, sometimes cold and sometimes hot, and the child got a cold and runny nose when sleeping at night. The waiter came to adjust it but couldn't solve it.\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Dear guests, thank you for your comments despite your busy schedule! Your suggestions are the driving force for us to keep moving forward, making progress and improving!\n\n4.0/5\n\nVery Good\n\nPosted on May 5, 2024\n\nThe hotel service is good, and there is a food street around it which is very convenient. I ate Minghong Hoof Flower, Li Shanshan Tea, Egg Cake, and Baked Sweet Potato Skin nearby, all of which were delicious 😋 The only drawback is that the hotel does not have an exhaust fan or a bathroom heater, so it may be a bit cold to take a shower in winter.\n\nOriginal TextTranslated by Google\n\nResponse from Property : Thank you for your review, Duoer will continue to work hard. The hotel room has an exhaust fan, the switch is on the electric card panel, the air conditioning and heating are sufficient in winter, there is no need to equip the bathroom heater, the room is warm ~ I hope to get your full score next time"
