        "text": "Should you visit Surat Thani or Chengdu?\n\nWhich is cheaper to visit? Which is more expensive for vacation?\n\nTrying to figure out where to travel next? This travel comparison between Surat Thani and Chengdu can help. It includes a travel cost comparison in addition to other factors. For many travelers, the cost of a destination is a primary consideration when choosing where to go.\n\nWhere Should I go: Surat Thani or Chengdu?\n\nSurat Thani\n\nThe best way to see the real culture of a country is to go where the tourists are not. If you are itching to experience real Thai culture, you may want to visit the city of Surat Thani. Located on the central gulf coast of southern Thailand, this city is usually the gateway to other Thai islands – meaning visitors run through it without stopping. Stay a while and get to know Surat Thani – known to the locals as the \"City of Good People.\"\n\nChengdu\n\nChengdu is in China's Sichuan Provence and is in what is known as the Red Basin. It is a particularly fertile region in China that is known for its agriculture. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as the \"Land of Milk and Honey\". The Funan River cuts through the city but has almost no boat traffic anymore. The city itself has a wonderful relaxed vibe compared to the rest of China and is filled with green parks and places to relax. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.\n\nFor some great organized tour ideas, see The Best Yoga Tours and Retreats in Thailand, The Best Honeymoon Tours in Thailand, The Best Cultural Tours in China, and The Best Luxury Tours to China.\n\nWhen comparing the travel costs between Surat Thani and Chengdu, we can see that Surat Thani is more expensive. However, the two cities are actually relatively comparable in price, as the difference is somewhat minimal. Generally, this means that you could travel with generally the same travel style and level of luxury in each place. Since both cities are in Asia, it's no surprise that their costs are relatively close, as many destinations here have somewhat similar travel prices overall.\n\nIf you're trying to decide if either of these two destinations are within your price range, also see Is Surat Thani Expensive? and Is Chengdu Expensive?.\n\nWhich is Bigger, Surat Thani or Chengdu?\n\nChengdu has a larger population, and is about 3950440 times larger than the population of Surat Thani. When comparing the sizes of Surat Thani and Chengdu, keep in mind that a larger population does not always imply the destination has more attractions or better activities. So, always research the type of place that you want to visit along with the activities and attractions that interest you."
