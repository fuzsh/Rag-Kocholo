(3) Urbanization has a substantial impact on environmental changes, whereas the restrictive effect of the eco-environment on urbanization development is not particularly notable. (4) Various interactive relationships exist between the urbanization and eco-environment subsystems, including positive promotion and negative constraint effects. The positive promotion effect mainly manifests between the economic, social, and ecological response subsystems, while the negative constraint effect is most evident in the mutual coercion and inhibition between the regional urbanization, economic urbanization, ecological status, and ecological pressure subsystems. These findings have important policy implications for decision makers exploring the path of coordinated and sustainable development in urbanization and the eco-environment in Urban agglomerations.",

        "text": "1 Introduction\n\nThe coupling relationship and interaction between urbanization and the eco-environment are extremely important aspects in the study of human-environment relationships. It is one of the core contents of modern human geography and physical geography research, and it is also an important topic for achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 [1, 2]. With the advent of the Anthropocene, understanding the interaction between humans and nature in the process of urbanization is crucial for pursuing human well-being and global sustainable development.The main carrier of urbanization, urban agglomerations are gradually becoming a new territorial unit for national participation in global competition and the international division of labor; they are of great significance for national and regional economic development, international competitiveness, and sustainable development [3]. However, the rapid urbanization and industrialization within Urban agglomerations have resulted in increasingly severe resource and environmental pressures, posing numerous sustainable development challenges for cities [4], including air pollution [5], traffic congestion [6], energy shortage [7], water quality deterioration [8], ecosystem degradation [9], forest/vegetation coverage and the loss or decline in biodiversity [10, 11].These ultimately lead to a decline in the quality of urbanization and the carrying capacity of the environment, making the development of urban agglomerations unsustainable. Therefore, in-depth exploration of the relationship between urbanization and the environment in urban agglomerations, promoting the coordinated development of urbanization and the environment, has become a hot topic in current relevant research areas and is also an important issue that urgently needs to be addressed in the process of urbanization in China.\n\nResearch on the relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment has mainly considered one-way influences, interactions, and coordinated development. Early research mainly focused on the one-way influence relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment, including the ecological changes caused by rapid urbanization and the constraints of the eco-environment on urbanization [12, 13]. As research progressed, attention was given to the interaction between the two and derived theoretical models of the interaction, such as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and the biexponential curve [14, 15]. Quantitative empirical analysis of this interaction has been conducted using econometric models such as the system dynamics model, decoupling model, and GWR model [16, 17]. In recent years, the coupling relationship and coordinated sustainable development of urbanization and the eco-environment have become research hotspots and frontier fields. International organizations have maintained a high level of attention to this topic and have listed it as a key research topic [18–20]. The academic community has also conducted theoretical and practical explorations. The Fang Chuanglin team has proposed the coupling circle theory, remote coupling theory, and the concept and research framework of the coupling cube to analyze the coupling and coordinated relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment [21–23]. Other scholars have used relevant mathematical models to quantitatively evaluate the coordinated development of the two, among which the most widely applied is the Coupling Coordination Degree Model (CCD). Liao Chongbin [24], Liu Yaobin [25], and Qiao Biao [26] successively established a coupling coordination model between urbanization and the eco-environment based on the coefficient of variation, coupling coefficient, and trigonometric function principles. The model has been highly regarded by scholars and widely used for practical research. For example, Huang Jinchuan and others used CCD model to analyze the relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment in Kazakhstan and combined it with geographic detectors to study the main control factors affecting coordinated development [27]. Wang Zhenbo and others focused on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, applied CCD model to analyze the relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment, and proposed a sustainable development path for green urbanization in the urban agglomeration [28]. Muhadaisi Ariken and others quantitatively evaluated the coordination relationship and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of urbanization and the eco-environment in provinces along the Silk Road in China through the integration of CCD and GTWR models [29].\n\nThe above research has played an important role in understanding the evolutionary relationship and coordinated development of urbanization and the eco-environment. But most of them focus on the study of the interaction between urbanization and eco-environment, and pay less attention to the positive interaction effect between the two. At the same time, there are more studies on the “one-to-one” interaction between urbanization and eco-environment at the system level, but there are few research results based on the “many-to-many” interaction between subsystems or elements. In addition, existing research lacks sufficient understanding of the interaction process and evolutionary mechanism of urbanization and eco-environment over time, and cannot explain the fundamental reasons for changes in the coordination relationship. The VAR model is an econometric model proposed by Christopher Sims in 1980, which is commonly used to analyze the dynamic interactive effects and dynamic shocks of variables in a time series with interdependencies and random disturbances. It has been widely applied in various fields [17, 30]. Compared with other econometric models, VAR models have the following main characteristics: first, there is a mutual influence relationship between multiple time series data; second, variables have intercorrelation or common driving factors; third, it models and predicts the dynamic relationship between multiple variables. As urbanization and eco-environment coupling system is a dynamic, complex, and nonlinear multiple feedback system, the elements in the system interact and constrain each other. Therefore, adopting VAR model to analyze the coupling relationship and interaction between urbanization and eco-environment can better reveal the dynamic evolution relationship and interaction mechanism between the two.\n\nThe Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration is one of the five national-level urban agglomerations in China. It is an important demonstration area for the country’s promotion of new urbanization and undertakes the national strategic tasks of building the “fourth pole” of China’s future economic growth and the ecological security zone in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. However, the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration faces severe ecological and environmental pressures while experiencing rapid economic and urbanization growth. Compared with other coastal urban agglomerations, such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Greater Bay Area, the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration has more complex topography, climate conditions, and a fragile eco-environment, which frequently leads to natural disasters and serious soil erosion [31]. The industrial density in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration is high, and the basin topography makes it difficult for industrial pollutants to dilute and diffuse, often resulting in severe regional air pollution [32]. Furthermore, the expansion of urban construction land and the protection of arable land have led to substantial conflicts; serious pollution in some tributary water environments and overall unsatisfactory environmental quality have developed [33]. In addition, due to the low efficiency of water, land, and energy resource utilization in traditional manufacturing industries, the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration faces increasingly severe resource constraints and pressures. There is an increasingly imbalanced situation between urbanization development and eco-environment carrying capacity. Urgently need to carry out research on the coupling relationship and interaction mechanism between urbanization and eco-environment, and then explore the path of coordinated sustainable development of the two.\n\nBased on the above background, this article first analyzes the coupling relationship and interaction mechanism between urbanization and eco-environment from a theoretical perspective, and then conducts empirical research on the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration in China as a typical region. The empirical analysis includes the following content: firstly, using ArcGIS and quadrant analysis method to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns and dynamic evolution characteristics of urbanization level and eco-environment quality in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration; secondly, using the CCD model to explore the development rules and evolution characteristics of their coupling relationship; thirdly, using the VAR model to analyze the complex interaction between the influencing factors of the two systems, urbanization and eco-environment; finally, feasible policy recommendations are proposed based on the research results. The research results can provide scientific basis for the sustainable development of the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration, and also enrich the achievements in the research field of the coupling relationship between urbanization and eco-environment. This article may have some innovations in the following aspects: based on theoretical and empirical analysis from a dual perspective, it conducts an analysis of the “many-to-many” interaction of system components from the levels of interactive threats and benign interactions, revealing the interaction process and evolution mechanism between urbanization and eco-environment over time, and thereby explaining the fundamental reasons for changes in coupling relationships.\n\n2 The coupling relationship and interaction mechanism between urbanization and eco-environment\n\nUrbanization is one of the most important drivers of the Anthropocene and a crucial manifestation of human social development and evolution, encompassing a series of complex processes including large-scale population migration, urban land expansion, industrial structural adjustment, capital accumulation, cultural and consumption habit transformation [34, 35]. According to the manifestations and connotations of urbanization, the process of urbanization can be classified into four levels: population urbanization, spatial urbanization, economic urbanization, and social urbanization. Among them, population urbanization is the core of the entire system, economic urbanization is the driving force, spatial urbanization is the manifestation of changes in spatial patterns, and social urbanization reflects the diffusion of civilization and the level of people’s living standards. The four subsystems of urbanization are interrelated and simultaneously have an impact on the eco-environment. The eco-environment is the natural foundation and support system necessary for human survival and reproduction, encompassing natural and artificial elements such as water, land, climate, energy, and greenery. It is the sum of various ecological factors and relationships that affect human survival and development [36]. Considering the relationship with urbanization, the eco-environment system can be divided into three subsystems: ecological conditions, ecological pressures, and ecological responses, known as the “Pressure-State-Response” framework (PSR). The eco-environment PSR framework reflects the interaction between human activities and the environment.\n\nThere is an objective dynamic coupling relationship between urbanization and eco-environment. This coupling relationship is essentially the sum of various nonlinear relationships formed by the interaction between urbanization elements such as population, economy, space, and society, and eco-environment elements such as ecological conditions, ecological pressures, and ecological responses. Interaction is the basis for the formation of coupling relationships. There is a strong interaction relationship between urbanization and eco-environment, forming a complex and nonlinear multiple feedback system, where the elements mutually promote and constrain each other (Fig 1).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301287.g001\n\nThe eco-environment provides natural resources and elements such as water, soil, air, energy, and minerals for urbanization, promoting the process of urbanization. Urbanization generates wastewater, exhaust gas, solid waste through processes such as population growth, land expansion, and energy consumption, exerting pressure on the eco-environment. This pressure increases the eco-environment’s stress and reduces its carrying capacity, thereby inhibiting urbanization. At the same time, with the development of urbanization, economic growth, technological progress, improvement in urban management level, and enhancement of population quality and environmental awareness, measures such as policy intervention and increased investment in environmental protection funds are taken to improve the quality of the eco-environment. Therefore, the interaction between urbanization and the eco-environment, through mutual constraint and mutual promotion, continuously evolves in a coordinated development direction, ultimately promoting the complex system of urbanization and the eco-environment from a lower to a level of form evolution.\n\n5. Discussion\n\n5.1 Construction of the urbanization and eco-environment system evaluation index system\n\nThe construction of the index system is an important foundation for exploring the coordinated relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment. Urbanization is a complex dynamic process that involves changes in factors such as population, industry, society, space, and ecology. The eco-environment is a collection of interactions between resources, the environment, and organisms. In order to comprehensively reflect the urbanization process and the content of the eco-environment, people are gradually inclined to construct comprehensive index systems. Researchers usually choose reasonable evaluation indicators based on a “standard” framework, among which PESS and PSR are currently the most classic framework models for constructing urbanization and eco-environment index systems [43, 44]. Based on this, this paper constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system for urbanization system and eco-environment system. This section discusses and explains some of the indicators.\n\nIn terms of urbanization, the area of urban built-up areas is an important consideration. Some scholars directly use the total area of urban built-up areas as an indicator of spatial urbanization [45], while others choose per capita urban built-up area [46]. Since there are differences in the area of different research units, the total area of urban built-up areas cannot reflect these spatial size differences. At the same time, due to the regulations of urban planning standards, there is not much difference in per capita built-up area among cities, making it difficult to measure spatial urbanization. Urban area density is calculated by dividing the total area of urban built-up areas within the research unit by the total area of the research unit, which reflects the size of urban built-up areas per unit area and can more accurately reflect the urban spatial expansion of different-sized research units. Therefore, this paper selects urban area density as one of the indicators to measure spatial urbanization. Medical and health conditions are important aspects of social urbanization. In order to comprehensively reflect the medical and health levels of various cities, this article together selects the indicators of the number of medical technicians per 10,000 people and the number of beds in health institutions. In terms of eco-environment, many scholars have adopted air quality indicators. However, this article constructs an eco-environment system based on the PSR framework, which largely regards air quality as the comprehensive result of various indicators of ecological pressure, ecological conditions, and ecological responses. Therefore, air quality indicators are no longer selected separately [47]. In addition, due to data limitations and difficulties in quantifying variables, some indicators have not been included, such as economic trade, education, and technology indicators that describe urbanization, as well as indicators that describe the eco-environment, such as soil and water pollution. In summary, based on previous research, considering the actual situation of the research area and the availability of data, this paper has carefully examined and compared, and comprehensively constructed an evaluation index system for urbanization and eco-environment. This index system will be further optimized in future studies of the same type.\n\n5.2 High-level urbanization has a positive impact on the eco-environment\n\nAnalysis of the coupling relationships and coordinated development status revealed that cities with higher urbanization levels show higher levels of coupling and coordinated development between urbanization and the environment, even though these cities may have lagging environments. For example, the two major central cities of Chengdu and Chongqing have higher urbanization levels than other cities, and their environments are also lagging; however, the coupling and coordinated development between urbanization and the environment were the highest among all the cities in the cluster. This indicates that a high level of urbanization has a positive promotive effect on the coupling and coordinated development of urbanization with the environment. Cities with higher urbanization levels are more likely to develop in harmony with the environment. Additionally, the results of the VAR model analysis showed that urbanization has a positive promotive effect on the environment, particularly in high-level urbanization, where economic and social factors contribute to the feedback of the ecological response subsystem and thus help improve the environment. There are several possible explanations for this.\n\nFirst, high-level urbanization is often accompanied by high-level economic development, which leads to greater financial investment in environmental protection and pollution control, thereby promoting environmental improvement. Additionally, urbanization drives technological innovation, and green technologies promote the production and use of green products, which contribute to environmental improvement. For example, the United Arab Emirates has reduced pollution caused by traditional energy industries by promoting clean energy industries [48]. Second, high-level urbanization implies a high level of social construction, which facilitates the implementation of environmentally friendly infrastructure and public services. Infrastructure such as piped water supply, sewage treatment, and waste disposal can be built, maintained, and operated more easily and economically in urban areas [49]. Third, urbanization has positive external dependencies and economies of scale that promote productivity improvement. Fewer resources are available to produce goods in urban areas, and highly urbanized cities have well-developed service industries that generate less pollution than traditional manufacturing development models. Therefore, urbanization is beneficial to the environment [42]. Fourth, the increase in urbanization has led to greater attention being paid to the environment and the pursuit of a clean and good living environment. This increased attention has promoted the implementation of environmental laws, government policies, and regulations to reduce environmental degradation [50].\n\n5.3 Policy implications\n\nOur research findings have important implications for policy making and promoting local development. (1) In terms of urbanization, different regions should adopt different urban development models to promote high-quality and balanced regional urbanization. The research results show that although the Coordination degree between urbanization and the eco-environment is gradually increasing, most cities are still at a relatively low level. At the same time, there are significant spatial differences in Coordination degree, which is consistent with the law of urbanization development. Therefore, to improve the level of Coordination between urbanization and the eco-environment, the key lies in balancing the promotion of urbanization without harming the eco-environment. Different economic development and urbanization models should be adopted for cities in different regions with different resource endowments. For the two core cities of Chengdu and Chongqing, while strengthening their core status, their radiation effects should be enhanced to gradually promote the outward migration of labor-intensive industries and other non-core functions in an orderly manner, thereby driving the coordinated development of surrounding cities. For central cities in areas such as Mianyang, Yibin, Nanchong, and Wanzhou, interaction and cooperation with Chengdu and Chongqing should be strengthened to give full play to their regional radiation and driving effects, and to improve the overall functions and service levels of the cities. For mountainous cities surrounding urban clusters such as Ya’an, Dazhou, Kaizhou, Yunyang, and Qianjiang, infrastructure construction should be intensified to promote cooperation and circulation in transportation, logistics, information, and other aspects with regional central cities. At the same time, the development of characteristic advantageous industries should be strengthened to enhance urban vitality and attractiveness. (2) In terms of the eco-environment, efforts should be made to continuously optimize the eco-environment and enhance its carrying capacity. First, coordinated efforts should be made to jointly build and protect the regional eco-environment. Planning, construction, and protection of ecological space should be carried out together, and the ecological system of key ecological functional areas should be nurtured and restored. For cities with relatively low forest coverage in the central part of urban clusters, such as Ziyang, Neijiang, Zigong, Hechuan, and Rongchang, tree planting and afforestation should be strengthened to increase forest coverage and enhance the stability and resistance of the ecological system. For remote mountainous cities like Qianjiang, Yunyang, Ya’an, and Dazhou, environmental protection mechanisms and protection systems should be established, residents’ environmental awareness should be enhanced, and the implementation of environmental protection work should be promoted effectively. Second, coordinated efforts should be made to address cross-border environmental pollution in the region. By formulating technical specifications and taking joint actions, pollution issues such as air, water, soil, hazardous waste, and noise should be collectively addressed.\n\n5.4 Limitations and future directions\n\nThe Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration is divided between two provincial-level administrative regions and consists of the “Chengdu Circle” and the “Chongqing Circle,” representing a typical “dual-city model.” Chengdu and the main urban area of Chongqing are the two core cities of the urban agglomeration, mutually attracting and influencing each other in the process of economic and social development. Other cities have also transcended provincial boundaries, with their populations, capital, cultures, and technologies integrating and intermingling with each other. In this process of attraction, influence, integration, and interconnectedness, the development of urbanization and the evolution of the eco-environment become more complex. Urban development not only affects the eco-environment within its administrative jurisdiction but also alters the eco-environment of neighboring cities or even more distant regions. Similarly, changes in the local eco-environment affect the development of urbanization in neighboring cities or distant regions. This phenomenon is referred to as the “telecoupling effect” between urbanization and the eco-environment, and a research framework for telecoupling has been proposed [51, 52] that consists of five basic components: systems, flows, mediators, causes, and effects, which correspond to the questions regarding telecoupling that require further investigation in the future. This study may have some limitations in addressing these questions, which will be an important area for further research on the coupling effects and interactions between urbanization and the eco-environment in urban agglomerations."
