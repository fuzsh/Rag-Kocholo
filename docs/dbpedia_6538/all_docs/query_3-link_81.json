        "text": "2015, Phonetica, 61-63. DOI: 10.1159/000435922 This short review offers a summary of the CVX theory proposed in Duanmu (2009). CVX theory is an attempt to reduce the varied shape of syllables in languages of the world to an invariant template in CVX (Consonant + vowel + consonant/vowel). Potential counterexamples are dealt with by attributing extra segments at edges to morphological effects and proposing different analyses of the segments in question. I tentatively suggest problems with this approach, and offer a hard counterexample (VVN syllable) from Fuzhou, which Duanmu (2009: 85) explicitly predicts not to exist.\n\nThis paper attempts a preliminary analysis of the phonological processes that affect vowels and consonants in Kɨβwanɉi language. Specifically, the paper examines the role played by these phonological processes in preserving the configuration of the phonologically possible word or morpheme in Kɨβwanɉi by using a Non-linear Approach (Autosegmental Phonology Theory). The findings reveal that the distribution of consonants is restricted in Kɨβwanɉi and the canonical syllable structure of Kɨβwanɉi is CV but not limited to $V$, $C$, $CV$ and $CGV$. Syllables are conditioned by phonological sequential constraints (PSCs) that govern the sequence of segments in the language. These constraints serve as the mechanism through which the native speakers are able to recognize words by applying phonological rules that are in conspiracy. It is also revealed that the rules are ordered with respect to the satisfaction of the structural descriptions that allow more than one rule to apply. Keywords : ph...\n\nThe study of phonotactics is concerned with speakers' knowledge of possible and impossible sound combinations. What is the reason for the absence of certain logically possible sound combinations in a language? Is it the result of accidents of history or do the gaps reflect a grammatical system that restricts the syllable inventory of the language? This entry reviews evidence of phonotactic generalizations in a variety of Chinese languages, examining ways to unearth Chinese speaker's knowledge of phonotactic constraints."
