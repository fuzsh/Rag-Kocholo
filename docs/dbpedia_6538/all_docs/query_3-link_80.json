        "text": "Decades of sweeping industrial policies have afforded China a near-total monopoly over gallium, a critical mineral used to produce high-performance microchips that power some of the United States’ most advanced military technologies. Recent moves by Beijing to restrict the export of gallium have laid bare the need for Washington and its allies to de-risk their critical mineral supply chains. Failing to address glaring vulnerabilities in the gallium supply chain could pose serious national security and economic challenges for the United States and its allies.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn July 3, 2023, a previously obscure mineral called gallium was thrust into the spotlight when China’s Ministry of Commerce announced plans to impose new restrictions on exports of the metal.[1] These measures went into effect on August 1, 2023, and are already shaking up global supply chains. They are primarily a shot across the bow designed to showcase China’s capacity and willingness to weaponize critical minerals for geopolitical gain.\n\nAs of 2022, China produced a staggering 98 percent of the world’s supply of raw gallium.[2] This virtual monopoly is largely a result of China’s position as the global leader in aluminum production—the process through which most gallium is extracted. Over the past few decades, deep government subsidies and tax incentives have fueled the rapid rise of China’s domestic metals industry, which has forced most global producers out of business, leaving China as one of the world’s only remaining producers of gallium.\n\nWhile relatively unknown to most people, gallium plays a critical and unique role in modern electronics supply chains, especially within the defense industry. Its unique properties allow for the production of specialized semiconductors that are vital to advanced capabilities like next-generation missile defense and radar systems, as well as electronic warfare and communications equipment.\n\nDisruptions in the gallium market could pose significant challenges for U.S. and allied defense industries and cost hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses. China’s stranglehold on the supply of raw gallium is a critical vulnerability for the United States and its partners—one that Beijing appears poised to exploit. Fortunately, there are clear steps the United States and its allies can take to limit their exposure to China’s critical mineral monopolies.\n\nGallium’s Revolutionary Properties\n\nThe chemical and physical properties of gallium make it well suited for use in high-performance applications such as advanced military equipment. Gallium may be combined with other materials to produce a special class of chips known as wide bandgap semiconductors.[3] These chips can handle higher temperatures, voltages, and frequencies than conventional silicon chips, making them smaller, faster, and more efficient.\n\nGallium chips have long powered advances in military technology. In the 1970s the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) played a leading role in incubating gallium as a material for a new generation of semiconductors. With DARPA’s backing, researchers developed a compound called gallium arsenide (GaAs), which powered advances in the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), precision-guided weapons, and radar.[4] GaAs is highly versatile and remains widely used in modern consumer electronics, including smartphones.\n\nThe development of a more advanced compound called gallium nitride (GaN)—also nurtured by DARPA—is now enabling new technological breakthroughs.[5] Most significantly, GaN is revolutionizing modern radar, allowing new radar modules to track smaller, faster, and more numerous threats from nearly double the distance. Many of these cutting-edge radar systems are powered by several thousand gallium-enabled chips.\n\nU.S. and allied armed forces are swiftly incorporating GaN-enhanced radars into their most important platforms. In 2019 Raytheon was awarded a $383 million contract to build the first six GaN-enabled active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars for the U.S. Army’s Lower-Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), which are being integrated into Patriot missile defense units and other systems.[6] In June 2023 Poland secured the first foreign sale of the LTAMDS radar system, and other key U.S. allies are likely to follow.[7]\n\nMeanwhile, Northrop Grumman is developing the AN/APG-85, an advanced GaN-backed AESA radar for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, and the U.S. Marine Corps has deployed Northrup’s AN/TPS-80 ground-based radar system since 2019. In 2022 the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) awarded Raytheon a $3.2 billion contract to equip up to 31 vessels with GaN-powered AN/SPY-6 system radars, including the navy’s new Arleigh Burke–class Flight III destroyers, aircraft carriers, and amphibious ships.[8] These upgrades are poised to bring about a sea change in the ability of U.S. and allied forces to defend against emerging threats like hypersonic missiles, next-generation stealth aircraft, and unmanned systems.\n\nHeightened U.S.-China tensions have further elevated concerns. In 2020 the Trump administration declared U.S. critical mineral dependencies (including on gallium) a national emergency.[19] In 2021 the Biden administration published a 100-day supply chain review warning U.S. reliance on China for gallium risks disruptions that would have “far-reaching impacts on semiconductor production.”[20] A 2023 draft critical mineral assessment report released by the U.S. Department of Energy also defines U.S. supply of gallium as “critical” in both the short and long terms, one of just six minerals to receive such designation.[21]\n\nYet government policies on critical minerals in the United States and abroad have been heavily biased toward securing access to a select group of inputs needed for emerging green technologies, such as lithium and cobalt. For example, the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides a 10 percent tax credit for domestic producers of a set of key minerals needed for electric vehicles, but gallium is absent from the list.[22] The lack of attention to lesser-known minerals like gallium has left government and industry leaders unprepared for the consequences of possible disruptions.\n\nThe Chinese government’s August 2023 export controls on gallium have made clear that Washington and its allies need to look beyond battery-making minerals to other strategically important resources. Chinese state media outlets framed the new rules as a direct response to export controls put in place by the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands to limit China’s access to advanced semiconductors and chip-making equipment.[23]\n\nThe full effect of the restrictions remains to be seen and will ultimately depend on how much gallium China chooses to withhold from global markets. Nevertheless, the move demonstrates Beijing’s willingness to use its control over critical minerals as a tool in China’s intensifying technological competition with the United States and its allies.\n\nHow China Came to Dominate Gallium\n\nChina’s control over gallium supply chains came about indirectly. Gallium differs from some other key minerals like lithium, nickel, and cobalt in that it is not recovered directly from the earth. Instead, gallium is largely a by-product of processing bauxite, the primary ore for aluminum.[24] Gallium production is therefore closely tied to the dynamics of global aluminum markets.\n\nChina’s emergence as an industrial powerhouse has driven explosive growth in its aluminum industry. Assisted by extensive government subsidies and tax incentives, China experienced a tenfold increase in aluminum production (from 4.2 to 40.2 million tons) between 2000 and 2022.[25] Today China supplies approximately 59 percent of the world’s aluminum.\n\nChina has plentiful reserves of bauxite within its borders, but due to the high environmental costs and low profit margins involved with bauxite mining, the country has gradually shifted toward imports of the ore to meet domestic demand. Major Chinese firms, led by the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chalco), have increasingly looked abroad to places like Guinea, Australia, and Indonesia to supply the raw bauxite ore for domestic aluminum processing.\n\nThese efforts have paid dividends for China’s military modernization and exemplify Beijing’s military-civil fusion strategy, a sweeping push to fuse together the country’s security and development goals.[37] Top personnel at China’s leading military radar manufacturer, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), claimed in 2018 to have developed state-of-the-art radar technologies “comparable in performance to those used by the [U.S.] F-22 and F-35.”[38]\n\nIn 2021 CETC released a family of next-generation GaN-backed radar systems called Lingdong (灵动), which it claims can easily detect stealth aircraft and cruise missiles.[39] Then, in 2023, Chinese academics published a paper outlining plans for an advanced naval radar system that would likely use GaN technology.[40] Reportedly, the new system will improve China’s ability to detect targets as far away from China as Australia or Guam.\n\nGrowing momentum in commercial applications of GaN, including 5G, have also helped propel Chinese firms into global leadership in gallium-based chips. While U.S., European, and Japanese firms maintain a technological edge, several Chinese companies are beginning to close the gap. Buoyed by billions of dollars of government investment and a slew of preferential tax, land, and procurement policies, several Chinese companies are becoming competitive on the world stage.[41]\n\nInnoscience, a leading manufacturer of gallium-based chips, operates two of the world’s largest GaN fabrication facilities and has expanded overseas with offices in the United States, Europe, and South Korea.[42] It has benefited from capital and partnerships from major Korean and European firms, like SK Group and ASML, while also receiving investment from AVIC Trust, the venture capital arm of China’s military aerospace giant, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).\n\nOther Chinese GaN firms, like Suzhou Nanowin, HiWafer, and Sanan IC, are following closely. An executive from Suzhou Nanowin boasted recently that the company had aims to capture 30 percent of the global market share for GaN substrate production.[43]\n\nChina’s patenting activities related to GaN semiconductors have also been rapidly accelerating, reflecting a deepening push to develop the technology.[44] Between 2019 and 2020, Chinese organizations (including telecommunications giant Huawei) accounted for over 40 percent of all patent applicants, surpassing the United States (23 percent), Japan (10 percent), and Europe (3 percent).[45] By 2019 Huawei alone had filed 2,000 patents on GaN technology."
