        "text": "Town of Caton On the formation of Steuben county, March 8, 1796, the tract of land now constituting the town of Caton and forming\n\nthe southwest comer town of the county, was designated as Township No. I, in the First Range\" of townships in said county. It remained as such until February 11, 184.0, at which time it took the name of \"Wormley,\" agreeable to an act of the legislature passed March 28, 1839. All previous histories have given the date of the formation of the town of Wormley as March, 1829. During that year a post-office was established here and called Wormley, and Samuel Wormley was appointed postmaster. From this sprang the error which has found its way into all the histories of the county which have hitherto been published. In all official records it was invariably spoken of as \"that part of the town of Painted Post known as township No. 1 in the first range of townships.\" It remained, as before stated, a part of Painted Post until February 11, 1840. To settle the dispute as regards the formation of the town, the writer has not only hunted up living witnesses of the fact, but has searched the session laws of the earlier days, and in those of 1859 found the following enactment, which is inserted as proof of the foregoing statements: \"An act to erect the town of Wormley in Steuben county, passed March 28, I 839. The people of the state of New York, represented in senate and assembly do enact as follows: From and after the 1st Monday in February, 1840, all that part of the town of Painted Post, in the county of Steuben, being township No.1 in the first range of townships in said county, shall constitute a new town of the name of Wormley, and the first town meeting for the election of town officers shall be held on the 2nd Tuesday of February next, at the house where Russell Stanton now resides. In accordance with the foregoing enactment a meeting was held, and town officers elected on February 11, 1840. The town of Wormley was, however, short lived,\n\nas we find by the following: \"An act to change the name of the town of Worrnley, in the county of Steuben, passed April 3, 1840. The people of the state of New York represented in senate and assembly, do enact as follows: The name of the town of Wormley, in the county of Steuben, is hereby changed to the name of 'Caton,'* by which last name it shall hereafter be known and designated. This act shall take effect immediately.\n\nThe foregoing proofs, which are official, show conclusively that the town of Wormley had no existence until February, 1840, and then passed away after a brief period of about sixty days, all histories to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nTopography.-The surface of the town is elevated, and is unbroken by gorges or gullies. There is probably less broken land in the town than in any upland town in the county. The soil is mostly of a shaly loam and well adapted to pasturage. The surface was originally covered with a heavy growth of timber, that which stood in the vicinity of Caton Centre being hard wood and hemlock, while in the respective four corners of the town there was a heavy growth of pine. There are but few streams in the town, the larger of which are Barnards creek flowing north and emptying into the Chemung river below Corning; Birch creek, flowing eastward and emptying into Seeley creek, Cook's creek flowing westward into the Tioga river, Hendy creek emptying into the Chemung river near the old Fitch bridge, has its origin in this town.\n\nCaton contains a population of I ,407,according to the census of 1890. In 1880 it contained 1,645 . The loss is mostly owing to the emigration\n\nof the young men who have gone from the town to engage in more lucrative business than that of farming. The majority of them are found\n\nin the cities of Corning and Elmira, where they have secured positions in various establishments and manufactories.\n\n*Derived from Richard Caton, who, with Edward Carroll, of Carrollton, Md., one of the signers of the declaration of independence, was one of the original land owners. Town of Corning embraces the territory that remained of the original township of Painted Post in 1852, in which year the name of the town was changed to Corning in honor of Erastus Corning, Sr., a distinguished citizen and merchant of Albany, N. Y. and the first president of the Corning Company which founded the prosperous city that now bears his name. This town also contains a \"gore\" of several hundredacres taken from the southeast corner of the town of Hornby and is township No. 2 in Range I of the county of Steuben. It is bounded on the north by\n\nHornby, east by the west line of Chemung county, south by Caton and by the town of Erwin on the west. The town contains 22,400 acres.\n\nThe city, 1,800 acres. The surface of the town is divided from northwest to southeast into two unequal upland portions by the valley of the Chemung river, the portion on the northeast side being- considerably larger and more valuable than are the uplands on the opposite side of the river. The principal streams emptying into the Chemung river on its northerlyside are the Borden, Post, Narrows and Winfield creeks; on the opposite side Monkey-run and Steel's creek are the chief streams. As an agricultural region this town is not above a general average of Steuben county. The first settlements within the present limits of the town weremade by Frederick Calkins, and Ephraim Patterson and his son Ichabod in 1789. Town of Dansville, one of the original towns of Steuben county, was formed in March, 1796, and named in honor of Daniel P. Faulkner\n\n, an influential citizen, familiarly known as \"Captain Dan\". Parts of Cohocton and Howard were taken off in 1812, a part of Wayland in 1848,\n\nand a part of Fremont in 1854. A portion of the town, including the village of Dansville, was annexed to Sparta, Livingston county, in 1822, and a part of Cohocton was re-annexed April 26, 1834. Dansville is the northern town upon the west border of the county. It is bounded north by a portion of Livingston county and Wayland, east by Wayland and Fremont,south by Hornellsville, and west by Allegany and Livingston counties. The surface of the town is a rolling upland, divided into ridges by the narrow valleys of the streamswhich flow both north and south into the two systems of waters which find their outlet in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Chesapeake Bay. The soil is sandy and gravelly loam in the east and north, and gravel underlaid by hardpan in the southwest. The population of this town in 1890 was 1,572. The portion of the town containing the population at the time of itsformation in 1796, was subsequently taken off. In the remaining portion their was no settlement until 1804, at which time Isaac Sterling settled half a mile east of Burns Station, near the foot of the hill, on the old Arkport and Dansvilie read. Samuel Gilson settled next north of Sterling the same season. At that time the road ran along the foot of the east hill, avoiding the shallow lake or marsh, which filled nearly the whole valley for a distance of three miles. It was at the outlet of this body of water that the \"Arkport\" of the early navigators was established."
