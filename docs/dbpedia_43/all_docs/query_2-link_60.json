        "text": "Overview\n\nDansville is a very small village located in the state of New York. With a population of 4,405 people and just one neighborhood, Dansville is the 358th largest community in New York. Dansville has a large stock of pre-World War II architecture, making it one of the older and more historic villages in the country.\n\nOccupations and Workforce\n\nUnlike some villages, Dansville isn’t mainly white- or blue-collar. Instead, the most prevalent occupations for people in Dansville are a mix of both white- and blue-collar jobs. Overall, Dansville is a village of sales and office workers, service providers, and construction workers and builders. There are especially a lot of people living in Dansville who work in office and administrative support (15.60%), sales jobs (8.04%), and food service (7.74%).\n\nDemographics\n\nThe education level of Dansville citizens, measured as those with bachelor's degrees or advanced degrees, is similar to the national average for all American cities and towns. 18.22% of adults 25 and older in Dansville have a college degree.\n\nThe per capita income in Dansville in 2022 was $37,253, which is middle income relative to New York, and upper middle income relative to the rest of the US. This equates to an annual income of $149,012 for a family of four. However, Dansville contains both very wealthy and poor people as well.\n\nThe people who call Dansville home describe themselves as belonging to a variety of racial and ethnic groups. The greatest number of Dansville residents report their race to be White, followed by Black or African-American. Important ancestries of people in Dansville include German, Irish, English, Italian, and French.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Dansville is English. Other important languages spoken here include Polish and Italian.\n\nThe Neighbors\n\nThere are two complementary measures for understanding the income of a neighborhood's residents: the average and the extremes. While a neighborhood may be relatively wealthy overall, it is equally important to understand the rate of people - particularly children - who are living at or below the federal poverty line, which is extremely low income. Some neighborhoods with a lower average income may actually have a lower childhood poverty rate than another with a higher average income, and this helps us understand the conditions and character of a neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the neighborhood in Dansville are lower-middle income, making it a below average income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's research shows that this neighborhood has an income lower than 71.2% of U.S. neighborhoods. With 15.6% of the children here below the federal poverty line, this neighborhood has a higher rate of childhood poverty than 61.2% of U.S. neighborhoods.\n\nA neighborhood is far different if it is dominated by enlisted military personnel rather than people who earn their living by farming. It is also different if most of the neighbors are clerical support or managers. What is wonderful is the sheer diversity of neighborhoods, allowing you to find the type that fits your lifestyle and aspirations.\n\nIn the neighborhood, 32.2% of the working population is employed in manufacturing and laborer occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants, with 25.6% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in executive, management, and professional occupations (24.5%), and 17.7% in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is the shared learned behavior of peoples. Undeniably, different ethnicities and ancestries have different cultural traditions, and as a result, neighborhoods with concentrations of residents of one or another ethnicities or ancestries will express those cultures. It is what makes the North End in Boston so fun to visit for the Italian restaurants, bakeries, culture, and charm, and similarly, why people enjoy visiting Chinatown in San Francisco.\n\nIn the neighborhood in Dansville, NY, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as German (24.1%). There are also a number of people of Irish ancestry (17.4%), and residents who report English roots (12.3%), and some of the residents are also of Italian ancestry (7.0%), along with some French ancestry residents (5.4%), among others.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nHow you get to work – car, bus, train or other means – and how much of your day it takes to do so is a large quality of life and financial issue. Especially with gasoline prices rising and expected to continue doing so, the length and means of one's commute can be a financial burden. Some neighborhoods are physically located so that many residents have to drive in their own car, others are set up so many walk to work, or can take a train, bus, or bike. The greatest number of commuters in neighborhood spend under 15 minutes commuting one-way to work (35.0% of working residents), one of the shortest commutes across America.\n\nHere most residents (74.7%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In addition, quite a number also carpool with coworkers, friends, or neighbors to get to work (19.0%) . In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
