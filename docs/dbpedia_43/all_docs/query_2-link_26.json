        "text": "Overview\n\nAvoca is a tiny village located in the state of New York. With a population of 840 people and just one neighborhood, Avoca is the 799th largest community in New York. Avoca has an unusually large stock of pre-World War II architecture, making it one of the older and more historic villages.\n\nOccupations and Workforce\n\nUnlike some villages, Avoca isn’t mainly white- or blue-collar. Instead, the most prevalent occupations for people in Avoca are a mix of both white- and blue-collar jobs. Overall, Avoca is a village of service providers, professionals, and sales and office workers. There are especially a lot of people living in Avoca who work in maintenance occupations (12.80%), office and administrative support (12.14%), and community and social services (8.17%).\n\nSetting & Lifestyle\n\nThe village is relatively quiet, having a combination of lower population density and few of those groups of people who have a tendency to be noisy. For example, Avoca has relatively fewer families with younger children, and/or college students. Combined, this makes Avoca a pretty quiet place to live overall. If you like quiet, you will probably enjoy it here.\n\nBeing a small village, Avoca does not have a public transit system used by locals to get to and from work.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe education level of Avoca citizens, measured as those with bachelor's degrees or advanced degrees, is similar to the national average for all American cities and towns. 17.80% of adults 25 and older in Avoca have a college degree.\n\nThe per capita income in Avoca in 2022 was $27,750, which is low income relative to New York, and lower middle income relative to the rest of the US. This equates to an annual income of $111,000 for a family of four. However, Avoca contains both very wealthy and poor people as well.\n\nThe people who call Avoca home describe themselves as belonging to a variety of racial and ethnic groups. The greatest number of Avoca residents report their race to be White, followed by Asian. Important ancestries of people in Avoca include English, German, Irish, Italian, and Dutch.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Avoca is English. Other important languages spoken here include Italian and Spanish.\n\nThe Neighbors\n\nHow wealthy a neighborhood is, from very wealthy, to middle income, to low income is very formative with regard to the personality and character of a neighborhood. Equally important is the rate of people, particularly children, who live below the federal poverty line. In some wealthy gated communities, the areas immediately surrounding can have high rates of childhood poverty, which indicates other social issues. NeighborhoodScout's analysis reveals both aspects of income and poverty for this neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the neighborhood in Avoca are lower-middle income, making it a below average income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's research shows that this neighborhood has an income lower than 60.6% of U.S. neighborhoods. In addition, 9.4% of the children seventeen and under living in this neighborhood are living below the federal poverty line, which is a lower rate of childhood poverty than is found in 52.3% of America's neighborhoods.\n\nWhat we choose to do for a living reflects who we are. Each neighborhood has a different mix of occupations represented, and together these tell you about the neighborhood and help you understand if this neighborhood may fit your lifestyle.\n\nIn the neighborhood, 34.4% of the working population is employed in executive, management, and professional occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is manufacturing and laborer occupations, with 28.2% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants (22.9%), and 14.3% in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is shared learned behavior. We learn it from our parents, their parents, our houses of worship, and much of our culture – our learned behavior – comes from our ancestors. That is why ancestry and ethnicity can be so interesting and important to understand: places with concentrations of people of one or more ancestries often express those shared learned behaviors and this gives each neighborhood its own culture. Even different neighborhoods in the same city can have drastically different cultures.\n\nIn the neighborhood in Avoca, NY, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as English (18.1%). There are also a number of people of German ancestry (18.1%), and residents who report Irish roots (13.1%), and some of the residents are also of Italian ancestry (4.5%), along with some Polish ancestry residents (3.3%), among others.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nHow you get to work – car, bus, train or other means – and how much of your day it takes to do so is a large quality of life and financial issue. Especially with gasoline prices rising and expected to continue doing so, the length and means of one's commute can be a financial burden. Some neighborhoods are physically located so that many residents have to drive in their own car, others are set up so many walk to work, or can take a train, bus, or bike. The greatest number of commuters in neighborhood spend between 15 and 30 minutes commuting one-way to work (39.1% of working residents), which is shorter than the time spent commuting to work for most Americans.\n\nHere most residents (81.9%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In addition, quite a number also carpool with coworkers, friends, or neighbors to get to work (8.3%) . In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
