Bath was obviously no different. The Swift Water Rescue Team from the Bath Volunteer Fire Department were deployed to the southern Steuben County area to help where it would be most needed.\n\nThe team made two successful rescues today. One was in the town of Jasper near State Rt. 36 and County Rt. 21 for a single person was trapped in their house and was taken to safety. The second was in the Canisteo area on County Rt. 119 near the County Route 14 intersection. Three people were on top of their submerged pickup truck but managed to get to the bank along County Rt. 119 where the Bath Swift water Rescue Team were able to pick them up and take them to safety as well.\n\nThe Bath Swift Water Rescue Team are all professionally trained by the State and other professional instructors to read the water and to handle themselves both in a boat and without a boat, which is extremely dangerous.\n\nUntrained persons should never attempt to navigate fast moving water in these conditions. Just a couple feet of fast-moving water can move a vehicle. Remember to “Turn around, Don’t drown!”\n\n(Photos from John Conrad, Bath Fire Dept)\n\nSuffer Storm Damage Yesterday? Call 2-1-1\n\nFrom Steuben County Emergency Services:\n\nSteuben County encourages residents with damages in need of assistance to reach out to the 211 Helpline by dialing 2-1-1 and providing their address, contact information and type of damages. Individuals will be connected with the appropriate community service organization that can assess with their needs. Residents are urged to stay informed by listening to local news broadcasts and following Steuben County Emergency Services on social media for regular updates\n\nSeveral Towns/Villages Evacuated Friday\n\nCanisteo, Addison and Campbell residents were ordered to evacuate on Friday afternoon. The Red Cross has set up shelters at both Hornell High School and the Corning Painted Post Field House. The evacuation orders for Addison, Campbell and Canisteo, were called off on Friday evening.\n\nNow Debby Remnants Seem To Be Heading Towards Steuben County, And There Is A Flood Watch Friday\n\nMeteorologist Rob Carolan now says the remnants of Debby are likely going to be moving towards Steuben County. \"It looks like the models continue to track what's going to be left of Debby further and further west,\" Rob Carolan said this morning. \"Originally it looked like it was going to cut up across the Hudson River Valley and go through Vermont. Now it looks like it may go through Eastern New York State. Also, it keeps throwing the moisture back our way so it looks like Steuben County could see several inches of rainfall on Friday and into Friday night. That's why the National Weather Service has issued a Flood Watch, from Friday morning, through late Friday night,\" Carolan said.\n\nUrsula Stone Is Sentenced To Three To Nine Years\n\nSteuben County District Attorney Brooks Baker says former Addison Clerk Treasurer Ursula Stone, who was accused of stealing over a million dollars from Addison Village Hall, was sentenced to an indeterminate three to nine years by Judge Watches yesterday in County Court .\n\nDA Brooks Baker also says, there will be a hearing in six weeks about restitution.\n\nLocal Red Knights Chapter, Raises $2K For Camp Courage\n\nThis year, the Red Knights Chapter 42 organization in Bath, brought in $2,000 for the Finger Lakes Regional Burn Association’s annual summer camp, Camp Courage. \"Each year we meet up with the Red Knights NY30 Chapter of Geneva, and all ride into their camp on our motorcycles, escorted in by the East Campbell Fire Department with lights and siren,\" said Bath Fire Dept spokesman John Conrad. \"The look on the children’s faces with their huge smiles as we ride by the waiting campers touches all our hearts. We make a full circle around the camp and come back and park. All the children (and a few camp counselors) surround the bikes and pick out which one they want to ride first. We give them rides on our bikes through the camp and they just can’t get enough. When we get back to where we started, they pick another one and go again. It makes us smile as much as the children. After everyone gets at least one ride then we break to go have lunch with them. Like all children, some will talk your ear off while others are quite reserved. We could never understand their trauma, but at least for a few hours they get to forget about it and just be kids.\"\n\nLP Building Solutions Wins An Award For Safety\n\nLP Building Solutions announced yesterday that they have won the 2023 Safest Company Award from The Engineered Wood Association. \"This is the 12th time we’ve won this award in the program’s 16-year history, including consecutive wins in 2022 and 2023,\" said LP Building Solutions Spokesperson Jen Bowman. \"The award goes to the North American engineered wood products company with the best average weighted incident rate (WIR) at its mills. In 2023, the industry WIR average was 8.74 while LP’s companywide WIR was an industry-leading 2.56. We are proud that our 4,000 team members' dedication to safety is being recognized,.\" said Bowman.\n\nCharters Of Freedom Update From Bath Mayor Sweet\n\nThe first phase of the work on the Charters of Freedom project in Bath will likely be done within the next two or three days. That’s according to Bath Village Mayor Michael Sweet. \"It's a two phase project,\" Sweet tells WVIN News. \"Phase 1 is the installation of the display cases, and I'm guessing that part of the project should be completed by the end of this week. The second phase of the Charters Of Freedom project is what the Bath Street Team will do, in cooperation with Steuben County, is to do the walkways and do landscaping, and relocate a flagpole behind the displays,\" Sweet said.\n\nCommunity Workshop To Be Held Monday Night In Bath\n\nThere is going to be a community workshop about the $4.5 million dollar New York Forward grant which some Bath residents and others in Bath are applying to get.

DiNapoli, Steuben County District Attorney Brooks Baker, and the New York State Police announced today.\n\nUrsula Stone pled guilty on May 29, 2024, admitting that she abused her position to steal more than $1 million over her 19-year career. Stone’s forfeiture of her state pension as a result of her public corruption conviction will be the first pension forfeiture in New York state.\n\n“Public service is a privilege and a duty. Those who abuse their positions and betray their communities undermine the integrity of government and risk losing their right to a public pension,” DiNapoli said. “For nearly two decades, Ursula Stone took advantage of her position and the trust of Addison residents to shamelessly steal over a million dollars. Thanks to the work of my office, District Attorney Baker, and the State Police, her crimes were uncovered, and she has been brought to justice. This case should send a clear message that those who dishonor their public office will face serious consequences.”\n\n“The magnitude, scope, duration and pervasiveness of this criminal activity is absolutely stunning,” Baker said. “For nearly two decades, Ursula Stone abused the trust of the people of the Village of Addison, using her position to steal from their taxes, their schools and their community. The impact of her criminal acts on this community has been and will be felt for decades. But for the dedication and expertise of the New York State Comptroller’s Office it might still be going on unnoticed. This sentence sends a clear message to this defendant about the damage she caused and to anyone else who might consider such crimes about the high price that will be paid. I want to thank the New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli and the members of his office for the incredible effort they put forth in identifying and prosecuting this crime. Their hard work and cooperation with the New York State Police and my office put us in a place to bring Ursula Stone to justice, and will bring this sad chapter for the village to a close.”\n\n“The sentencing of Ms. Stone demonstrates the vital collaborative work of our law enforcement partners focused on the same goal; holding those who break our laws accountable,” New York State Police Superintendent Steven G. James said. “The victims in this case are the people of New York who put their trust in this former Village of Addison employee. I commend our State Police members, our partners at the State Comptroller’s Office and Steuben County District Attorney’s Office for their commitment to investigating those who prey on the unsuspecting public for their own gain.”\n\nUnder a 2011 law and a 2018 New York state Constitutional Amendment, certain public officials convicted of crimes related to their office may be subject to pension forfeiture. It is the responsibility of the prosecuting attorney with jurisdiction over the crime to commence an action for pension forfeiture and show the defendant knowingly and intentionally committed a crime related to public office. Here, Stone has admitted to her crimes and agreed to pension forfeiture as part of her sentence.\n\nStone, who retired in March 2023, will forgo her monthly pension payment of $1,920.\n\nDiNapoli’s office began an audit of the village in 2022 and found the 56-year-old Stone had been running the financial operations of the village with no oversight. She prepared payroll, maintained manual leave records, and processed health insurance buyouts and unused leave payments with no review or approval from the mayor or any other village official.\n\nUpon subsequent investigation, DiNapoli’s office also discovered that checks from the Addison Central School District, payable to the village, were not deposited into the village’s accounts. A joint investigation by DiNapoli’s office, the New York State Police, and the Steuben County District Attorney’s Office determined that Stone stole dozens of such checks payable to the village, which she converted to certified bank checks and cashed.\n\nAdditionally, investigators found Stone gave herself unauthorized pay raises, took time off without deducting it from her leave credits and wrote herself checks for unauthorized health insurance buyouts from village funds. Stone had also been cashing out unused vacation time since 2004, an option that was only available to employees who resigned or retired.\n\nBefore submitting her resignation letter, she wrote herself a final check for $26,613, which was not authorized by the board. The board stopped payment on the check before she was able to cash it. In total, investigators say she stole $1,171,362.\n\nStone is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 7 by Judge Chauncey Watches of Steuben County Court and her pension forfeiture ordered by Judge Patrick F. McAllister in Steuben County Supreme Court.\n\nSince taking office in 2007, DiNapoli has committed to fighting public corruption and encourages the public to help fight fraud and abuse. New Yorkers can report allegations of fraud involving taxpayer money by calling the toll-free Fraud Hotline at 1-888-672-4555, by filing a complaint online at https://www.osc.state.ny.us/investigations, or by mailing a complaint to: Office of the State Comptroller, Division of Investigations, 8th Floor, 110 State St., Albany, NY 12236.\n\nCounty Public Defender Casey Rogers Gets An Award\n\nSteuben County First Assistant Public Defender Casey E. Rogers has received one of New York State’s highest honors for her work in public defense. Rogers received the state Defenders Association’s 2024 Kevin M. Andersen Memorial Award July 22 at the association’s 57th Annual Meeting and Conference in Saratoga. The award recognized Rogers for her high-quality legal work, leadership, generosity, and commitment to and respectful treatment of all clients.\n\nRogers was nominated for the award by county Chief Public Defender Shawn Sauro. “She is compassionate and passionate about our clients,\" Sauro said. “Casey is an immensely skilled trial attorney and the epitome of model trial advocacy.\" A leader in the county public defense department, Rogers manages the office's rapidly growing staff, and acts a role model and mentor to the department’s up-and-coming attorneys, Sauro said. The Kevin M. Andersen Memorial Award is presented to an attorney who has been in practice less than fifteen years, who practices in public defense, and who exemplifies the sense of justice, determination, and compassion that were the hallmarks of its namesake, a lawyer at the Genesee County Public Defender's Office.\n\nNYSDA Deputy Director Natalie Brocklebank noted Rogers' fight for proper implementation of the discovery reforms of 2019, which included access to, and dissemination of, the association’s resources. \"Casey has been a true advocate for her clients and has tirelessly worked to ensure the spirit of new reforms is followed,\" Brocklebank said. “She would share her insights about the local landscape of how the courts were interpreting the changes … (and develop) creative and compelling arguments without giving up.\" Positive results were followed up to ensure that any good decisions that have come out of her jurisdiction are shared with her colleagues as well as the larger defender community, Brocklebank said.\n\nDuring the difficult period of reform implementation, complicated by COVID, Rogers won numerous motions on discovery issues according to NYSDA Staff Attorney Maxwell Kampfner.\n\n\"Casey has been instrumental in changing the culture and perception of public defense in Steuben County,\" said Sauro.\n\nhttps://www.steubencountyny.gov\n\nThe 2024 award is not the first Sauro’s office has received. In 2023, Sauro accepted a NYSDA award on behalf of his office for working continuously to invoke and enforce discovery. Rogers has helped make sure such excellence continues, Sauro said, adding \"Discussing public defense practice, one young attorney told me ‘I want to be the best...I want to be Casey Rogers.’\"\n\nRep. Tenney Calls On OSHA To Back Off New Rules\n\nFrom Congresswoman Claudia Tenney:\n\nYesterday in Lockport, Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (NY-24) today was joined by Niagara County Legislators Anthony Nemi, Shawn Foti, and Christopher McKimmie, President of FASNY Edward Tase, Jr., Niagara County Director of Emergency Services and Fire Coordinator Jonathan Schultz, and numerous local volunteer firefighters to call on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to reconsider expanding regulations that threaten the closure of volunteer fire departments across New York.\n\nIn February, OSHA unveiled a new safety and health standard to replace the Fire Brigades Standard, suggesting 22 additional rules for all fire departments. These encompass obligatory facility upgrades and enhanced training requirements. However, the proposal overlooks the substantial financial and operational constraints faced by numerous volunteer fire departments. In May, Tenney sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of Labor Douglas Parker, urging OSHA to reconsider these rules and extend the public comment period.\n\n“Thank you to the outstanding volunteer firefighters from our community for joining me in urging OSHA to reconsider the 22 additional rules that would burden our local fire departments,” said Congresswoman Tenney. “NY-24 depends on volunteer firefighters to keep our community safe, putting their lives on the line to save others. We must ensure they are not hampered by burdensome and costly regulations that could lead to closures or limited access to emergency services in our rural communities. I will continue advocating against these regulations and work to ensure our rural and volunteer fire departments have the resources they need.”\n\nGILLIBRAND: Setting Up A Hotline For First Responders\n\nFrom Senator Gillibrand's Office: U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the bipartisan First Responders Wellness Act, legislation that would establish a grant program to expand culturally competent and professional mental health services for law enforcement officers. The bill would also establish a national mental health hotline for first responders.\n\n“Our first responders put themselves in extremely challenging and life-threatening situations in order to keep us safe. Unfortunately, it takes a toll; first responders face higher rates of PTSD and suicide compared to the civilian population,” said Senator Gillibrand. “We must support the men and women who dedicate their lives to protecting ours. The bipartisan First Responders Wellness Act would create a new grant program to provide professional and culturally competent mental health services to law enforcement officers and establish a mental health hotline for the first responder community. I’m proud to work with Senator Hawley on this important legislation and look forward to getting it across the finish line.\n\nState Come Through With Funding For Wayland, Because Of The February 22, 2022 Fire In Downtown Wayland\n\nFrom Governor Hochul: The Village of Wayland has been awarded more than $1.2 million dollars, for efforts to demolish properties on Main Street that were destroyed by a 2022 fire. The state funding will assist the property owner/developer, who plans to build 14,000 square feet of mixed-use space, including a licensed daycare facility, coffee shop, restaurant and eight residential housing units on the upper floors. \"We were thrilled to learn these projects will now be able to move forward and even more pleased to know that out of the five projects awarded in the Southern Tier,\" Steuben County Industrial Development Agency Director Jamie Johnson tells Wvin News, \"Steuben County had two of them and our projects were awarded over half of the funding the region received.

Sheriff Allard says he hopes all the youth who attended the camp this year had a wonderful experience.\n\nInterns Working For The County Public Defenders Office\n\nFROM STEUBEN COUNTY: Three Cornell University interns positioned with the Steuben County Public Defender’s Office are getting a closer look at lives far removed from the lives they’ve known, as.\n\nTheir scholastic aims are different, too: * Aylin Mestizo, 19, from the Bronx, with a concentration in American Studies and Economics. * Elle Michel, 21, from Brooklyn, majoring in Industrial and Labor Relations. * Oliver Wang, 25, from Syracuse, graduated from New York University with a BS in Applied Psychology and a double major in Politics. He aims for a Juris Doctor in 2025. All three are toying with the idea of pursuing a legal career and were selected to participate in the three-year old Cornell University program. In Steuben, the internship is designed to introduce students to what it’s like to be a defendant in court with few resources, little money and an underprivileged background. “We take aspiring law students,” said county Chief Public Defender Shawn Sauro. “And give them a look at what it’s like from our ‘side.’”\n\nThe experience is an eye opener, the interns said. Talking to people in a holding center was an introduction to a world they didn’t know existed. Well aware of issues and needs in their home community cultures, all three agreed they were struck by the diversity of the public defense clients in Steuben. And the county Public Defender’s Office was not the chaotic cut-throat, self-absorbed and fast track to wealth in many law offices, they said. For one thing, the lawyers there break the tension inherent in public defense with jokes. And pranks. But there’s more: “Everyone here is so authentic, honest,” Mestizo said. “But they’re hard-working, knowledgeable and confident.” The students spend hours researching cases, laws and building a defense for those who may have little hope.\n\nMichel said it is unlikely she will pursue a legal career in a court. But the time in Steuben adds an important depth to whatever career she chooses, she said.\n\nHochul Announces Funding For Ira Davenport Hospital\n\nToday Governor Kathy Hochul announced that 28 health care facilities statewide, including Ira Davenport Hospital in Bath, will get funding for healthcare workforce training.

Wvin contacted the governor's press office, to get more details on that.\n\nNews On Governor Kathy Hochul's Recent FEMA Request\n\nThe governor recently sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to get FEMA funding for the parts of Steuben County which need help after this month’s storms.\n\nAssemblyman Joe Giglio is pleased that the governor reached out to the president. However, the assemblyman explained that this is not a simple task. \"The state will have to work with FEMA, to help Steuben County transition back to normalcy, after those serious storms,.\" Giglio said. This is not the first time it's happened that Steuben County has been on the receiving end of heavy winds and rain, and we need FEMA's help.\"\n\nTim Marshall, Director of Steuben County Public Safety states, “Many of our Towns and Villages on the eastern side of the county including the City of Corning were hit hard by the storm, but unlike a flood where there is damage to public infrastructure such as roads and bridges there really is not that much damage, Marshall says. “Much of the cost is associated with debris clearance and overtime from the storm.” Steuben County municipalities would have to reach a Federal threshold of $430,486 in order to qualify.” Marshall says, “The big question is if there is enough damage to reach this federal threshold.” He also said “In addition, the whole state has to reach a threshold of over $37 Million dollars to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration, so all this depends on if the county and state can reach those requirements,” Marshall said.\n\nA Major Update In The Ursula Stone Case\n\nSentencing will be a week from today in Steuben County Court, for former Addison Clerk/Treasurer Ursula Stone, who was accused of stealing over a million dollars from Addison Village Hall.

It would be life-changing for older adults and the millions of Americans with chronic conditions and disabilities.”\n\nUPDATE FROM TIM MARSHALL ON OUTAGES\n\nFrom Steuben Co Emergency Services: Steuben County continues to clean up from yesterday’s severe thunderstorms.
