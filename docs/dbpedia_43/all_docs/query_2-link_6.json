        "text": "Wayland is a town in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 3,733 at the 2020 census.\n\nThe Town of Wayland contains a village called Wayland. The town is in the northern part of the county, northwest of Bath.\n\nHistory\n\nThe region was first settled by European Americans around 1806, after the Revolutionary War. In historic times, for centuries it had been territory inhabited by the Seneca Native Americans, one of the powerful five tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe town was formed in 1848 from the Towns of Cohocton and Dansville. Part of Wayland was used to form the Town of Fremont in 1854.\n\nThe Rowe House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOn August 30, 1943, the Lackawanna Limited wreck, occurred when the Lackawanna Limited, flagship passenger train of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad sideswiped a local freight that had not cleared into a siding, killing 29 people near the Gunlocke chair factory.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.5 square miles (102.4 km2), of which 39.0 square miles (101.1 km2) is land and 0.5 square mile (1.3 km2) (1.31%) is water.\n\nThe northern and part of the western town lines form the border of Livingston County.\n\nNew York State Route 21 is a north-south highway in the town and intersects New York State Route 15 and New York State Route 63 in the village of Wayland. Interstate 390 crosses the town from west to east.\n\nWayland is the northern terminus of the B&H Rail Corp.'s Gang Mills–Wayland Line. Prior to 1956, it was linked to Rochester directly by rail and, prior to 1964, it was directly linked to Buffalo by rail. Both of these connections were removed by order of the ICC following application by the owning railroads. As the Erie Lackawanna Railway's former Lackawanna mainline from Buffalo had a steep grade eastbound from Groveland to Perkinsville that was easily bypassed by the former Erie mainline via Hornell, with far easier grades, the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad mainline trackage between Groveland and Wayland was abandoned and torn-up in late 1963.\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1850 2,067 — 1860 2,809 35.9% 1870 2,553 −9.1% 1880 2,591 1.5% 1890 2,334 −9.9% 1900 2,984 27.8% 1910 2,836 −5.0% 1920 3,004 5.9% 1930 3,071 2.2% 1940 3,078 0.2% 1950 3,178 3.2% 1960 3,385 6.5% 1970 3,546 4.8% 1980 3,881 9.4% 1990 4,311 11.1% 2000 4,314 0.1% 2010 4,102 −4.9% 2020 3,733 −9.0% 2021 (est.) 3,702 −9.8% U.S. Decennial Census\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 4,314 people, 1,665 households, and 1,168 families residing in the town.
