As of the 2020 census, the population was 93,584.[1] Its county seat is Bath.[2] Its name is in honor of Baron von Steuben, a Prussian general who fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War, though it is not pronounced the same (German: [fɔn ˈʃtɔʏbn̩] ). There is no direct link between Baron von Steuben and modern Steuben County, which he never visited (and in his day was near-wilderness).\n\nSteuben County comprises the Corning, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Elmira-Corning, NY Combined Statistical Area.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSee also: Canisteo, New York, Canisteo (village), New York, Hornell, New York, and Greenwood, New York, insurrection of 1882\n\nOntario County was established in 1789 to govern lands the state of New York had acquired in the Phelps and Gorham Purchase; at the time it covered the entirety of Western New York. Steuben County, much larger than today, was split off from Ontario County on March 8, 1796. In 1823 a portion of Steuben County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to form Yates County. Steuben County was further reduced in size on April 17, 1854, when a portion was combined with portions of Chemung and Tompkins counties to form Schuyler County.\n\nAlthough it is not much mentioned because it does not fit well into the standard narrative of New York State history, in its earliest years Steuben County was demographically and geographically linked to the Susquehanna River basin in Pennsylvania, leading to the port of Baltimore. The Canisteo River, navigable as far as Arkport, emptied into the Chemung River and it into the Susquehanna. There were no natural barriers, like the Cohoes Falls on the Mohawk, to impede transportation, and timber and other agricultural products were easily shipped downriver from what are today (2019) the towns of Addison, Canisteo, and Hornellsville. Prior to the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, followed by the railroads, communication with the Hudson Valley and New York City was difficult. Limited to horses, mules, and donkeys, it was far too expensive to be used to ship bulky agricultural products.\n\nIn 1892 a bill was introduced in the Legislature to split Steuben County, with Canisteo, Corning, and \"the south towns\" becoming Lincoln County. It did not pass.[3]\n\nGeography[]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,404 square miles (3,640 km2), of which 1,391 square miles (3,600 km2) is land and 14 square miles (36 km2) (1.0%) is water.[4]\n\nSteuben County is in the southwestern part of New York State, immediately north of the Pennsylvania border. The population of Steuben County according to the 2000 U. S. census was 98,726. The county is in the Southern Tier region of New York State.\n\nAdjacent counties[]\n\nGovernment and politics[]\n\nSteuben County is governed by a 17-member legislature headed by a chairman\n\nState and federal government[]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Steuben County, New York[5] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 29,474 63.83% 15,790 34.19% 915 1.98% 2016 26,831 63.88% 12,526 29.82% 2,645 6.30% 2012 21,954 56.98% 15,787 40.97% 790 2.05% 2008 24,203 57.75% 17,148 40.92% 560 1.34% 2004 26,980 63.81% 14,523 34.35% 781 1.85% 2000 24,200 59.66% 14,600 35.99% 1,763 4.35% 1996 17,710 46.40% 14,481 37.94% 5,980 15.67% 1992 19,761 47.72% 12,043 29.08% 9,606 23.20% 1988 25,359 65.93% 12,824 33.34% 283 0.74% 1984 28,848 73.19% 10,471 26.56% 98 0.25% 1980 22,418 58.73% 12,826 33.60% 2,926 7.67% 1976 23,164 60.93% 14,685 38.63% 166 0.44% 1972 28,708 75.05% 9,462 24.74% 83 0.22% 1968 24,189 62.52% 12,229 31.61% 2,272 5.87% 1964 15,988 39.34% 24,634 60.61% 23 0.06% 1960 29,638 68.06% 13,898 31.91% 13 0.03% 1956 33,902 78.22% 9,440 21.78% 0 0.00% 1952 32,123 74.14% 11,154 25.74% 49 0.11% 1948 22,938 62.44% 12,895 35.10% 903 2.46% 1944 25,538 65.36% 13,461 34.45% 73 0.19% 1940 27,587 65.12% 14,651 34.58% 127 0.30% 1936 24,987 61.23% 14,978 36.70% 845 2.07% 1932 22,986 62.19% 13,219 35.77% 754 2.04% 1928 28,028 69.26% 10,699 26.44% 1,739 4.30% 1924 21,481 66.79% 7,194 22.37% 3,485 10.84% 1920 18,335 65.79% 7,401 26.56% 2,132 7.65% 1916 10,424 53.99% 8,032 41.60% 852 4.41% 1912 5,986 31.54% 7,396 38.97% 5,598 29.49% 1908 12,313 56.33% 8,366 38.27% 1,180 5.40% 1904 12,680 59.66% 7,364 34.65% 1,209 5.69% 1900 12,411 55.51% 8,872 39.68% 1,076 4.81% 1896 12,858 59.47% 7,971 36.87% 793 3.67% 1892 10,577 50.61% 8,307 39.74% 2,017 9.65% 1888 11,637 53.10% 9,154 41.77% 1,126 5.14% 1884 10,048 48.78% 9,060 43.98% 1,491 7.24%\n\nOffice District Area of the county Officeholder Party First took office Residence Congressman New York's 23rd congressional district All[6] Thomas W.
