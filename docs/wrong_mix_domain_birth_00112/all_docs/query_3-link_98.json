        "text": "Michael Jordan is forever part of Wilmington's past. But how big a part will, or should, the basketball legend play in its future?\n\nIt's question that I and others have been wondering how to answer for a long time, and it's the focus of a story that takes an in-depth look at what Michael Jordan, who has meant so much to so many around the world, means to his hometown of Wilmington.\n\nJordan, of course, starred for Laney High School before going on to play for the University of North Carolina and the NBA's Chicago Bulls, eventually becoming one of the most famous people on the planet.\n\nThe story grew out of what I guess you could call the disconnect between Jordan's sky-high level of fame and success, and the rather understated way in which his connection to Wilmington is acknowledged or publicly recognized on a local level.\n\nSome point to the fact that arguably the best basketball player of all time, who's from Wilmington, isn't in either Wilmington \"hall of fame,\" one of which is dedicated to sports.\n\nFor subscribers: What does Michael Jordan mean to Wilmington? It's complicated.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for that, which the story explores, but Wilmington has always seemed to struggle with how to frame its ties to Jordan, and I really wanted to know why that is.\n\nLots of people I talked to for this story think Jordan's connection to Wilmington should be way more up-front and hard to miss — a statue? a museum? — and that Wilmington could potentially benefit from highlighting the connection. Others have a different view, and question whether Jordan would even want Wilmington to do more to recognize him.\n\nHe has come back to visit many times over the years, and has given money to many different groups, but he's also talked about having conflicted feelings about Wilmington, in part because of the racism he experienced here growing up.\n\nWe did, of course, want Jordan himself to comment for the story. But after trying to contact him through a few different avenues, he ultimately declined through one of his reps.\n\nPlenty of other people were willing to talk about what Jordan means, however, including people who knew him during his Wilmington days as well as everyday members of the community.\n\nThere may not be a definitive answer to what Jordan means to Wilmington, or how he should be acknowledged here now, or in the future. But I think it's been a story worth exploring, and one that reveals a lot about what kind of city Wilmington was, is and could be."
