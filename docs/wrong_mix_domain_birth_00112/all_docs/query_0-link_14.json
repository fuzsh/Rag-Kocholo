After the unveiling, it was reported that I made history by becoming the first African American artist to have a portrait painting displayed in a North Carolina courthouse. I was commissioned by the Phoenix Historical Society to paint the portrait. \n\n#blackhistory #blackhistorymonth #georgehenrywhite #georgehenrywhiteportrait #portraitcommission #arthistory #artist #ncartists #ncartist #ncart #portraitartist #portraitsocietyofamerica #portrait #blackartist #awardwinningartist #judicialportrait #nc #georgehenrywhiteday #richardwilsonart \n\nArticle from The Daily Southerner / Jan. 31, 2005\nWritten by Calvin Adkins\nwww.richardwilsonart.com\".",
