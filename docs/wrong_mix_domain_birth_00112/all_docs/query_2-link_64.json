        "text": "Michael Jordan Biography\n\nOver 15 NBA seasons, Michael Jordan built a brand around his legendary basketball career that is unmatched. Six times Jordan took the Chicago Bulls to the NBA Finals and six times he emerged a champion and the Finals MVP. The five-time MVP went to 14 All-Star Game, was a ten-time All-NBA first team pick, and nine-time Defensive first teamer. Jordan won two Olympic gold medals with Team USA. Ever since he made the game-winning shot for North Carolina as a freshman in the 1982 NCAA Championship, he was a fixture on the national radar. Jordan would go on to be a two-time consensus All-American for the Tar Heels and the Naismith Player of the Year in 1984. A huge part of his lasting legacy however is changing the business of sports for today’s athletes. The Air Jordan brand he built with Nike still nets Jordan close to $100 million each year. Not many men have ever been more successful as a corporate pitchman. Jordan was able to use the wealth he built off the court to purchase majority ownership of the Charlotte Bobcats in 2010. He has seen the franchise through a change back to their original Hornets name along with a return of playoff basketball in The Queen City.\n\nBook Michael Jordan for your Next Event"
