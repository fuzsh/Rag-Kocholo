SERIES FOREWORD In response to high school and public library needs, Greenwood devel-oped this distinguished series of full-length biographies specifically for student use. Prepared by field experts and professionals, these engaging biographies are tailored for high school students who need challenging yet accessible biographies. Ideal for secondary school assignments, the length, format, and subject areas are designed to meet educators’ requirements and students’ interests. Greenwood offers an extensive selection of biographies spanning all curriculum-related subject areas including social studies, the sciences, literature and the arts, history and politics, as well as popular culture, covering public figures and famous personalities from all time periods and backgrounds, both historic and contemporary, who have made an impact on American and/or world culture. Greenwood biographies were chosen based on comprehensive feedback from librarians and educators. Con-sideration was given to both curriculum relevance and inherent interest. The result is an intriguing mix of the well known and the unexpected, the saints and sinners from long-ago history and contemporary pop culture. Readers will find a wide array of subject choices from fascinating crime figures like Al Capone to inspiring pioneers like Margaret Mead, from the greatest minds of our time like Stephen Hawking to the most amazing success stories of our day like J. K. Rowling. While the emphasis is on fact, not glorification, the books are meant to be fun to read. Each volume provides in-depth information about the subject’s life from birth through childhood, the teen years, and adulthood.\n\n9. viii SERIES FOREWORD A thorough account relates family background and education, traces personal and professional influences, and explores struggles, accomplish-ments, and contributions. A timeline highlights the most significant life events against a historical perspective. Bibliographies supplement the ref-erence value of each volume.\n\n10. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Although I did not have an opportunity to interview Jordan, his four memoirs provided numerous insights into the qualities that made him a truly exceptional athlete and successful businessman. For the Love of the Game (1998) and Driven from Within (2005) were especially helpful resources for information about his formative years. This work especially benefited from the insights of four people who have authored previous books about Jordan. Dean Smith’s A Coach ’ s Life (1999) helped illuminate Jordan’s years at North Carolina, and Phil Jackson’s Sacred Hoops was an invaluable source for Jordan’s years with the Chicago Bulls. David Halberstam’s Playing for Keeps (1999) gave me a fuller understanding of how Jordan shaped the world around him, and Walter LaFeber’s Michael Jordan and the New Global Capitalism (1999) pro-vided perspective on Jordan’s enormous influence beyond the basketball court. I also thank the William Penn University faculty, administration, and students who listened to me share some of my ideas about Jordan at a Chautauqua lecture in March of 2006. My wife, Marilyn, patiently lis-tened to me relate numerous stories about Jordan. Thanks to Kristi Ward, Esther Silverman, and Apex Publishing for their valuable editorial suggestions in the later stages of writing this book.\n\n12. INTRODUCTION THE JORDAN MYSTIQUE A monument stands in front of the United Center, home of the Chicago Bulls National Basketball Association team. A 2,000-pound bronze statue features Michael Jordan in full flight, ready to slam dunk the ball, to the chagrin of cowering defenders. The front panel capsulizes the phenom-enal athlete: “The best there ever was. The best there ever will be.” 1 Jordan needs no introduction. He is among the best-known and wealthiest athletes in the history of organized sports. With the possible exceptions of boxer Muhammad Ali and baseball player Babe Ruth, no athlete has made a greater impact on American society. ESPN in 1999 voted Jordan the greatest twentieth-century athlete, and the Associated Press ranked him second, behind Babe Ruth. Jordan has appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated more than 50 times since 1983 and was named the magazine’s “Sportsman of the Year” in 1991. 2 Sports Illustrated contributor Jack McCallum wrote that Jordan “stands alone on the mountaintop, unquestionably the most famous athlete on the planet and one of its most famous citizens of any kind.” He called him a sportsman who “has surpassed every standard by which we gauge the fame of an athlete and, with few exceptions, has handled the adulation with a preternatural grace and ease that have cut across the lines of race, age, and gender. He transcends sports.” 3 After struggling initially, Jordan blossomed into a basketball star at Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina. He became a national celebrity as a freshman guard at the University of North Carolina,\n\n13. xii INTRODUCTION converting a 15-foot jump shot in the waning seconds of the 1982 NCAA Championship game to defeat Georgetown University. Besides making All- America as a sophomore and junior, Jordan was named The Sporting News Player of the Year in 1983 and 1984 and winner of the Naismith Award and Wooden Award in 1984. He co-captained the U.S. basketball team to a gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California. Jordan’s transcendence stemmed partly from good timing. Jordan joined the Chicago Bulls after his junior year in 1984, when the NBA was enjoying an era of unprecedented popularity. Americans were fascinated with the personal duels between two modern sports folk heroes, Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics and Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers. When Bird and Johnson retired in the early 1990s, Jordan almost single handedly propelled the NBA to even more stratospheric levels of success and international visibility. Former coach Larry Brown observed, “I love Magic and Larry. But Michael,…. I’d pay money to see him play. I’d pay money to see him practice.” 4 Jordan led Chicago to six National Basketball Association titles in the 1990s. Between 1991 and 1993, the Bulls became the first team in three decades to win three consecutive NBA championships. He was selected NBA Most Valuable Player in 1988, 1991, and 1992 and became the only hoopster ever voted NBA Finals MVP three straight times. He also starred for the U.S. Dream Team, gold medal winners in the 1992 Summer Olympic Games at Barcelona, Spain. Jordan soared to even greater heights after a nearly two-year hiatus to propel the Bulls to three more NBA titles from 1996 to 1998. Chicago shattered the NBA record for most victories in a single season with a 72–10 mark in 1995–1996, as Jordan became the first NBA player since 1970 to garner MVP awards from the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals. The Bulls still dominated the NBA the next two seasons, with Jordan snagging NBA MVP honors in 1998 and NBA Finals MVP accolades in 1997 and 1998. His intensive drive to win, extraordinary athletic ability, and uncanny basketball knowledge shone brilliantly when he battled influenza and personal fatigue to score the winning basket in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. Jordan retired from the Bulls in 1999, having led the NBA in scoring 10 times, including seven consecutive seasons, and won five NBA MVP awards. He is the only player to score at least 50 points in five playoff games and the only hoopster besides Wilt Chamberlain to score more than 3,000 points in a season and average more than 30 points a game during his NBA career. In January 2000, Jordan became president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards and minority owner of the Washington Wizards\n\n14. INTRODUCTION xiii Sports and Entertainment. He played for the Wizards from 2001 to 2003, helping rescue the franchise from a $20 million deficit to a $30 million profit in two years. Jordan did not lead the Wizards to the NBA playoffs, but he became just the fourth NBA player to score 30,000 career points and passed Chamberlain as the third leading scorer in NBA history. In June 2006, he became the second largest shareholder of the Charlotte Bobcats, fulfilling his dream of sharing in the ownership of an NBA club in North Carolina. Jordan’s transcendence stemmed from his phenomenal athleticism and personal magnetism. Coach Bob Knight in 1995 proclaimed, “Michael Jordan is the best that will ever play this game.” 5 Even those who never saw Jordan play a college or professional basketball recognize him. He combined exceptional athletic ability with a relatively clean public image. Gentleman ’ s Quarterly correspondent David Breskin termed him “the most admired, idolized, and moneyed team-sport hero in the entire American-hero business. For some folks he has come to represent America.” 6 Sociolo-gist Harry Edwards declared, “if I were charged with introducing an alien life form to the epitome of human potential, creativity, perseverance, and spirit, I would introduce that alien life form to Michael Jordan.” 7 Jordan personifies the imaginative, individual skills that Americans emulated in a society that adores graceful, successful individualism, but he also embodies the all-out competitive spirit and discipline that Americans believe drove the nation to the peak of world power. Jordan’s extraordinary basketball skills translated into enormous money and power in the late twentieth century. He has endorsed numerous com-mercial products, including Nike’s Air Jordan footwear, Wilson basket-balls, Wheaties cereal, Coca Cola soft drinks, Chevrolet automobiles, and McDonald’s hamburgers. Nike designed a whole new line of athletic shoes after the legend with uncanny ability to hang four feet above the floor while shooting. The Air Jordan line revived Nike’s sneaker sales. These commercial enterprises netted the likable star millions annually in revenues. Biographer David Halberstam labeled Jordan the first super-athlete of the satellite age, the initial professional to benefit on a grand scale from a global audience for his talents and his products. “Jordan has created a kind of fame that exceeds sports. He is both athlete and enter-tainer. He plays in the age of the satellite to an audience vastly larger than was possible in the past and is thus the first great athlete of the wired world.” 8 Jordan became a multimillionaire and a role model not only for African Americans but others as well. Along the way, he also became one of the most successful advertising figures in the world. This book traces Jordan’s career chronologically. The first chapter treats his formative years with his family in Wilmington and at the University of\n\n15. xiv INTRODUCTION North Carolina. The next four chapters feature his role with the Chicago Bulls. Chapter 2 treats the building years from 1984 to 1988, and Chapter 3 discusses the ascending years from 1988 to 1991, culminating in Chicago’s first NBA crown. Chapter 4 examines the triumphant years of the Bulls’ second and third NBA titles from 1991 to 1993 and the transition years from 1993 to 1995, when he played baseball with the Birmingham Barons and returned to the Bulls. Chapter 5 highlights the pinnacle years of Chicago’s last three championships from 1995 to 1998, and Chapter 6 reviews the disappointing years with the Washington Wizards. The book features his on-court accomplishments, but it also exam-ines his disagreements with Chicago’s coaches over offensive strategy, his clashes with Bulls’ management over team policies, and his reluctance to rely on teammates. It also details his role as a phenomenally successful ad-vertising figure and the way in which his competitiveness led to gambling problems. NOTES 1.

TIMELINE OF EVENTS IN THE LIFE OF MICHAEL JORDAN 1963 Jordan is born on February 17 in Brooklyn, New York. 1975 Jordan pitches two no-hitters in the Wilmington, North Carolina Little League. He hurls a two- hitter in the Little League Eastern regionals, but his team loses, 1– 0, and just misses making the Little League World Series. 1978–1979 Jordan fails to make the varsity basketball team at Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina. 1980–1981 Jordan grows to six feet four inches by his senior year and averages 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists. He attends Howard Garfinkel’s summer Five All-Star Basketball Camp in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for major college prospects. 1981–1982 Jordan enrolls at the University of North Carolina on a basketball scholarship and becomes one of the few true freshmen to start for Dean Smith. He averages 13.5 points and four rebounds, earning Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Rookie of the Year accolades. His 15-foot corner jump shot in the closing seconds gives the Tar Heels a one-point victory over Georgetown University in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game and gives Smith his first national title.\n\n17. xvi TIMELINE 1982–1983 As a sophomore, Jordan leads the ACC in scoring with a 20-point average. His 78 steals rank second to Dudley Bradley in the Tar Heels single- season record book. A unanimous All-America, he is selected The Sporting News College Player of the Year. He stars in the Pan American games in Caracas, Venezuela, where the United States wins a gold medal. 1983–1984 Jordan leads North Carolina to the ACC Conference regular-season title, averaging 19.6 points and 5.3 rebounds. He repeats as The Sporting News College Player of the Year and an All- American, winning the Naismith Award and Wooden Award, and contributes to the U.S. Olympic team gold medal win at the 1984 Los Angeles, California games. 1984–1985 Jordan leaves North Carolina after his junior year to enter the National Basketball Association draft. The Chicago Bulls select him in the first round as the third overall pick and sign him to a seven-figure, five-year contract. Jordan becomes an instant success, reviving interest in the floundering Chicago franchise. He leads the NBA in points (2,313), averaging 28.2 points, 5.9 assists, and 2.4 steals and pacing the Bulls with a 6.5 rebound average. The NBA Rookie of the Year and an All-Star game starter, Jordan scores a season-high 49 points and 40 or more points seven times. He mesmerizes crowds with his blinding speed, physical artistry, and ability to soar upwards, momentarily hang in mid air, and make balletic slam dunks. The Bulls increase home attendance by 75 percent and lead the NBA in road attendance. Jordan signs a lucrative contract with Nike athletic shoe manufacturer, which releases its very popular Air Jordan basketball shoes. 1985–1986 Chicago wins its first three games, but Jordan breaks a bone in his foot in the third game and misses all but 18 games. Without him, the Bulls lose 43 of their next 64 games. On his return, Chicago finishes the season 30–52 and makes the playoffs. The Boston Celtics sweep the Bulls in the first round,\n\n18. TIMELINE xvii but Jordan averages 43.7 points and scores an NBA-playoff record 63 points in a double overtime loss in Game 2 on April 20. 1986–1987 Jordan wins his first NBA scoring title with a 37.1 point average, becoming only the second NBA player (Wilt Chamberlain was the first) to tally 3,000 points in a season and the first player in NBA history to register 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season. He wins the slam-dunk competition on All-Star weekend in February in Seattle and scores 61 points in a 117–114 loss to the Atlanta Hawks on April 16 at Chicago Stadium. Jordan registers at least 50 points eight times during the regular season, makes the All-NBA first team, and finishes runner-up to Magic Johnson in the NBA Most Valuable Player voting, but Boston again sweeps Chicago in the first playoff round. 1987–1988 Jordan repeats as NBA scoring champion with a 35.0 point average and leads the NBA with 3.16 steals per contest, helping the Bulls post a 50–32 mark and advance beyond the first playoff round for the first time in seven seasons. He wins his second consecutive slam-dunk contest with a dunk from the free-throw line and tallies 40 points as the All- Star game MVP. His 259 steals and 131 blocks are exceptional for an NBA guard. The NBA MVP and defensive player of the year, Jordan makes the All- NBA first team and the All-Defensive team. In the playoffs, he averages 45.2 points to help Chicago eliminate the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games before losing to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons in five games in the second round. 1988–1989 On January 25, Jordan scores his 10,000th career point against the Philadelphia 76ers, reaching that total in just 303 games, fewer than any other NBA player except Wilt Chamberlain. He records perhaps his best all-around performance, leading the NBA with 32.5 points per contest, averaging a personal-best 8.0 assists, and hauling down a career-high 8.0 rebounds per outing. A perennial All-Star\n\n19. xviii TIMELINE and All-NBA first teamer, Jordan makes the first team All-Defensive squad and finishes second in the NBA MVP balloting. He joins the NBA’s great clutch performers with his last second shot against Cleveland in decisive Game 5 of the first playoff round. After defeating the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Bulls lose to Detroit in the Eastern Conference Finals. The physical Pistons invoke the Jordan Rules, double-and triple-teaming Jordan every time he touches the ball, preventing him from going to the baseline, and hammering him when he drives to the basket. 1989–1990 Jordan marries Juanita Vanoy in September at Las Vegas, Nevada. Chicago finishes 55–27 under new coach Phil Jackson. Jordan again paces the NBA in scoring with a 33.6 point average, finishing third in the NBA MVP balloting and repeating on the All-NBA first team and the All-Defensive team. Besides tallying a career-high 69 points at Cleveland on March 28, he leads the NBA in steals, with 2.77 per game, and averages 6.9 rebounds and 6.3 assists. Jordan averages 33.1 points in the playoffs, but De-troit eliminates the Bulls in the seven-game Eastern Conference Finals. 1990–1991 Jordan silences his critics who claim that his brilliant individual performance had not elevated the play of his teammates or brought the Bulls an NBA title. He wins his second NBA MVP Award after leading the NBA again in scoring with a 31.5 point average and averaging 6.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists. After winning a franchise record 61 games and finishing in first place for the first time in 16 years, Chicago sweeps Detroit in the Eastern Conference Finals and defeats the Los Angeles Lakers in the five-game NBA Finals for its first NBA title. During the playoffs, Jordan averages 31.1 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 8.4 assists and changes hands in midair while completing a layup against Los Angeles. He wins his first NBA Finals MVP Award and weeps while holding the NBA Finals trophy. 1991–1992 The Bulls continue their dominance, with 67 victories, as Jordan snags another NBA MVP\n\n20. TIMELINE xix Award. He paces the NBA with a 30.0 point scoring average and averages 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists, repeating on the All-NBA first team and the All- Defensive first team, and averages 34.5 points in 22 postseason contests. After overcoming the physical New York Knicks in the second round, the Bulls eliminate the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Jordan again earns NBA Finals MVP honors with his dominating performance, as Chicago defends its title in six games over the Portland Trail Blazers. His six 3-pointers and 35 points in the first half highlight Game 1. The “Dream Team,” a collection of NBA superstars, including Jordan, breeze to a gold medal at the 1992 Olympic games in Barcelona, Spain. The star-studded roster cruises through the medal round, keeping America at the top of the basketball world. The Olympics promote the NBA and Jordan’s potent image to a growing international market of basketball fans. 1992–1993 Jordan helps the Bulls become the first team to win three consecutive NBA titles since Boston’s victories during the mid-1960s. He again paces the NBA in scoring with a 32.6-point average, but Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns takes the NBA MVP Award. The Bulls lose the first two games of the Eastern Conference Finals at New York but rally behind Jordan to win four straight. Chicago bests Phoenix in the six-game NBA Finals, as Jordan’s 41 point scoring average sets an NBA Finals record. He becomes the first NBA player to earn three straight NBA Finals MVP awards, capping off perhaps the most spectacular seven-year run by any athlete. 1993–1994 Jordan announces his initial retirement from basketball, citing a lost desire to play the game. Other factors include his physical exhaustion, ever- rowing celebrity, and the murder of his father, James, that July . Jordan also suffers gambling losses on the golf course and is spotted at an Atlantic City, New Jersey casino. His photo-filled book, Rare Air: Michael on Michael, celebrates his remark-able athletic skills. Jordan spends 1994 pursuing a\n\n21. xx TIMELINE childhood dream he shared with his father—playing professional baseball. He trains with the Chicago White Sox and plays outfield for the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA Southern League, drawing large crowds. In 127 games, Jordan hits only .202 and strikes out 114 times in 436 at bats. He belts 17 doubles, drives in 51 runs, and steals 30 bases. 1994–1995 Jordan plays baseball for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League and scores 52 points on September 9 in the final basketball game at the old Chicago Stadium, a charity contest arranged by Scottie Pippen. The entrance to the United Center, new arena of the Chicago Bulls, is adorned with a 12-foot bronze statue of an airborne Jordan. His disappointing baseball performance and the pro-longed professional baseball players’ strike prompt him to return to the NBA. On March 18, Jordan issues a two-word press-release, “I’m back.” The next day, he rejoins the Bulls and dons jersey Number 45, as his familiar Number 23 had been retired in his honor during his first retirement. Besides scoring 55 points against New York at Madison Square Garden on March 29, Jordan leads Chicago to a 9–1 record in April and the NBA playoffs. He averages 26.8 points in 17 regular-season games and 31.5 points in the playoffs, but the Bulls lose to the Orlando Magic in the six-game Eastern Conference semifinals. His sequel, I ’ m Back! More Rare Air, provides more re-flections on his remarkable athletic career. 1995–1996 The playoff defeat motivates Jordan to train aggressively over the summer. The Bulls, strengthened by the acquisition of rebounder Dennis Rodman, dominate the NBA with an all-time best 72–10 mark. Jordan wins both the regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards and captures an eighth scoring title, averaging 30.4 points, hauling down 6.6 rebounds, dishing off 4.3 assists, and making 2.2 steals per outing. He averages 30.7 points in postseason, as Chicago sweeps Orlando in the Eastern Conference Finals and defeats the Seattle SuperSonics in the six-game NBA Finals\n\n22. TIMELINE xxi to win the title. Jordan earns the NBA Finals MVP Award for the fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson, and becomes the first player since Willis Reed in 1970 to capture all three MVP awards during the same season. 1996–1997 Jordan leads the Bulls to a 69–13 record and fifth championship in seven years, although Karl Malone edges him for the NBA MVP Award. He wins another NBA scoring title with a 29.6-point aver-age and tallies his 25,000th career point at the San Antonio Spurs on November 23. Jordan averages 31.1 points in the playoffs and 32.3 points in the NBA Finals, helping the Bulls conquer the Utah Jazz in six games. He wins Game 1 with a buzzer-beating jump shot. Despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus, Jordan scores 38 points and makes the game-deciding three-pointer with less than one minute left to lift the Bulls to a dramatic 90–88 victory in Game 5. He earns a record fifth NBA Finals MVP Award and signs an unprec-edented $3 million, one-year contract that August. 1997–1998 Chicago compiles a 62–20 record for a second three-peat. Jordan leads the NBA for a record tenth time in scoring with a 28.7 point average, securing his fifth regular-season MVP Award. His other ac-colades include making the All-NBA first team for the tenth time, the NBA All- Defensive team for the ninth time, and All-Star Game MVP for the third time. The Bulls win the Eastern Conference playoffs for the third straight year and vanquish Utah in the six-game NBA Finals. In decisive Game 6, Jordan enjoys perhaps the greatest clutch performance in NBA Finals history. He steals the ball from Malone and sinks a dramatic shot with less than 10 seconds left, giving the Bulls an 87–86 victory and their sixth NBA championship. Jordan scores 45 points in that historic game and averages more than 30 points in the NBA Finals, earning his sixth NBA Finals MVP Award, twice that of any other NBA player. A third memoir, For the Love of the Game: My Story, provides more reflections on his career.\n\n23. xxii TIMELINE 1999 Jordan retires from the Bulls for the second time on January 13 during an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, “99.9 percent” certain he will never play another NBA game. Phil Jackson leaves as coach and Pippen is traded to the Houston Rockets. 2000 On January 19, Jordan becomes part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards NBA team. He wins four Excellence in Sports Performance for the Year (ESPY) awards: Athlete of the Century, Male Athlete of the 1990s, Pro Basketball Player of the 1990s, and Play of the Decade for switching the ball from his right hand to his left for a dunk against Los Angeles in the 1991 NBA Finals. Jordan trades or releases several highly paid, unpopular players, including Juwan Howard and Rod Strickland, but unwisely drafts high school prospect Kwame Brown with his first 2001 draft pick. 2001 Jordan spends the spring and summer training for a second comeback, holding several invitation-only games for NBA players in Chicago, and hires Doug Collins as Washington head coach. On September 25, he leaves the Wizards front office and returns as a player. 2001–2002 Despite an injury-plagued season, Jordan still paces Washington in scoring (22.9 point average), assists (5.2 average), and steals (1.42 average). He nearly leads the youthful Wizards to the playoffs and in-spires sellouts for all 41 home games at the MCI Center. Jordan sparks Washington to a franchise-record nine-game winning steak in December and scores his 30,000th career point on January 4 against Chicago at the MCI Center. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain, and Malone were the only NBA play-ers to score 30,000 career points previously. A knee injury shortens his season to 60 games. 2002–2003 Jordan averages 20 points as the only Wizard to play all 82 games, but Washington again misses the playoffs. He appears in his 13th All-Star game, surpassing Abdul-Jabbar as leading scorer in All- Star history. Jordan scores 43 points on February\n\n24. TIMELINE xxiii 21 against the New Jersey Nets, becoming the first 40-year-old to tally 40 points in an NBA game. The Wizards again sell out all 41 home games. Jordan retires with 32,292 career points, third on the NBA’s all-time scoring list behind Abdul- Jabbar and Malone. He assumes that he will return to his director of basketball operations position, but Washington owner Abe Pollin fires him on May 7. 2003–2006 Jordan spends time with his family in Chicago, golfs in celebrity charity tournaments, and promotes his Jordan Brand clothing line. In 2005, his inspiring story, Driven from Within, stresses the importance of authenticity, integrity, passion, commitment, and other qualities in his personal life. The book also describes how challenging events have pushed him to new heights. On June 15, 2006, Jordan becomes the second-largest owner of the Charlotte Bobcats NBA team. Owner Bob Johnson gives him final authority on player personnel decisions as managing member of basketball operations. The Jordans file for divorce in December 2006, citing irreconcilable difference, ending their 17-year marriage. They re-tain joint custody of their three children.\n\n26. Chapter 1 THE FORMATIVE YEARS, 1963–1984 MIDDLE CLASS ORIGINS: EARLY YEARS (1963–1977) Jordan attributes his success to his home, family, and hometown. He came from a close-knit upper-middle class family. His parents, James Jordan and Deloris Peoples, grew up in limited economic circumstances on eastern North Carolina farms. They met after a basketball game in Wallace in 1956. James, a sharecropper’s son, served in the U.S. Air Force, and Deloris briefly attended Tuskegee Institute. They were married shortly after Deloris quit Tuskegee. Both parents were average height and nonathletic. Michael Jordan was born February 17, 1963 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents lived there temporarily while his father attended a General Elec-tric training school. The fourth of five children, he has two older brothers, Larry and James, the most athletic sibling; an older sister, Deloris; and a younger sister, Roslyn. When Jordan was still young, his father retired from the Air Force and moved to Wallace. James worked as a forklift operator at the General Electric Company factory outside Wallace, and Deloris was a drive-through window teller at a branch of United Carolina Bank in Wallace. In 1970, the Jordans got better jobs in larger Wilmington, near where James had grown up. James, who built a large house in a wooded area near an ocean beach, was promoted at General Electric to dispatcher, foreman, and equipment supervisor of three departments. Deloris advanced to head teller at United Carolina Bank and then head of customer relations at the\n\n27. 2 MICHAEL JORDAN downtown office. The Jordans fared well financially with incomes from their jobs and James’s Air Force pension. The five Jordan children attended integrated schools and missed the worst of the civil rights violence. The Jordans encouraged Michael to develop friendships with both African-Americans and whites. Deloris wanted Michael to judge others on their merits rather than their skin color. Jordan seldom experienced racial discrimination, but he was suspended from school for crushing a Popsicle into the head of a white girl who called him a “nigger.” 1 When a neighbor refused to let him use a swimming pool, he quietly left. “Don’t worry about race unless somebody slaps you in the face,” 2 he said. Jordan’s parents influenced him in different ways. Both parents imbued him with their strong work ethic, the will to strive for excellence in their chosen fields, and a sense of priorities. Jordan developed his outgoing personality, sense of humor and order, love of athletics, mischievousness, and tongue-wagging from James. “My father is a people person,” Jordan explained. “He can talk to someone for five hours and have any con-versation you could imagine.” Deloris gave him motivation, discipline, a perfectionist attitude, competitiveness, and a drive to win. “My mother has always been more of the business side of the family,” he observed. “She had a kind of [get up and get it] attitude.” 3 James described Michael as carefree, kind, and easy to please. The laziest sibling, Michael avoided doing household chores. As a teenager, he was the only sibling who did not maintain a steady job and would have been viewed as the least likely to succeed. “I was the black sheep of the family,” Jordan confessed. “I didn’t want to work.” 4 He often bribed his siblings to avoid household chores that his strict, hard-working parents demanded of their children. Deloris forced him to take a job at a hotel doing main-tenance work, but he quit after a week. She was upset and warned him that he would not have any spending money. Jordan just wanted to play basketball and other sports. He admitted, “my focus was to be the best player in whatever sport I played. That was all I ever thought about.” Unlike James or his older brothers, Ronnie and Larry, Michael lacked mechanical skills. James wanted Michael to help him in the garage, but Michael was not interested. “He didn’t think I’d amount to anything,” Jordan recalled. 5 Jordan was not focused academically until high school. Although he had perfect school attendance through eighth grade, he had discipline problems in ninth grade. “Ninth grade was the toughest year of my life,” 6 Jordan recollected. The principal suspended him for leaving the school grounds without permission on the first day of school to buy a soda, for\n\n28. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 3 swearing at a teacher, and for fighting a boy who erased the white lines he was drawing to form base paths on the school infield for a baseball game that day. He tried to stay out of further trouble. Jordan considered baseball his favorite sport and made his first athletic accomplishments in that sport. He wanted to become a professional baseball player He was one of few African Americans on his Wilmington Little League team and pitched two no-hitters. At age 12, Jordan hurled a two-hitter in the Little League Eastern Regionals, but Wilmington lost the championship game, 1–0, and just missed making the Little League World Series. He fared even better in the Babe Ruth League, earning Most Valuable Player honors when his team captured the state baseball championship. Jordan considered the award his favorite childhood memory and biggest accomplishment as a youth. He also excelled at pool, cards, Monopoly, and other games and played the trumpet in seventh and eighth grades. In Wilmington, the African American youngsters usually played basketball rather than baseball. Basketball seemed a distant dream for Jordan because of his skinny frame. Not a born basketball player, Jordan worked hard to improve his jumping and other hoop skills. He worshipped his competitive, athletic older brother, Larry. As a middle school student, Jordan often played one-on-one basketball with Larry on the small court that his father built in the back yard. Although only five foot seven inches, Larry dominated Michael for several years because he was taller and much stronger. Jordan repeatedly lost the one-on-ones, but loved competition and overcoming obstacles. Their spirited rivalry sometimes even led to fights. Frustrated by his lack of height, Jordan often hung from a chin-up bar to stretch his body. He eventually outgrew Larry, but both could jump. Despite his later athletic accomplishments, Jordan remained an adoring younger brother and looked to Larry as a source of inspiration. James often complimented Larry more often, lead-ing Michael to work even harder. LEARNING THROUGH FAILURE: 9TH AND 10TH GRADES (1977–1979) By the ninth grade, Jordan began exhibiting more athletic ability and even more competitiveness. Six-foot six-inch Harvest Leroy Smith, Jordan’s closest friend, considered him small, but very quick and the best ninth-grade player. Jordan’s quickness compensated for his lack of size. Jordan needed to win whether it was a game or just playing HORSE. If he lost, he played again until he won.\n\n29. 4 MICHAEL JORDAN Emsley A. Laney High School was desegregated when Jordan entered. Approximately 40 percent of Laney students were African American. Laney lacked the racial tensions that sometimes occurred at southern schools. After ninth grade, Jordan and Smith attended varsity basketball coach Clifton “Pop” Herring’s basketball camp. Herring invited them to try out for the varsity squad as sophomores in 1978, and he liked Jordan’s quickness and Smith’s size, but the other varsity players were older and stronger. When Herring posted the varsity team names in the gymnasium, Smith made the final cut, but 5-foot 9-inch Jordan did not. Although admitting that the varsity squad was very good, Jordan still insisted he could contribute. Assistant coach Fred Lynch decided that Jordan should spend his sophomore year on the junior varsity squad. Jordan would see more play-ing action there. The Laney coaching staff should have known how the decision to accept Smith would impact Jordan and should have told him that his time would come. Jordan considered that day the worst of his young life. Herring listed the varsity team in alphabetical order. Jordan repeatedly reread the list, think-ing that he might have missed seeing his name or that the list was out of alphabetical order. He walked home alone that day. “I went to my room and I closed the door and I cried,” Jordan recalled. “For a while I couldn’t stop. Even though there was no one else home at the time, I kept the door shut. It was important to me that no one hear me or see me.” 7 Harvest Smith knew the pain that Jordan was experiencing because he considered Jordan a much better basketball player. Although his friends were playing, Jordan did not even want to cheer for the varsity team. “I guess I wanted them to lose to prove that they had made a mistake by leaving me off the team,” 8 he remembered. Jordan starred for the junior varsity basketball team that year, exhibiting dominant quickness. He averaged 28 points as a point guard, popularizing the jayvee games. The entire varsity squad watched Jordan play. Despite his stellar play, however, Jordan was not promoted to the varsity for the state tournament. He rode the team bus to the state tournament only because he asked to be statistician and the team manager was sick. Jordan desperately wanted to be part of the varsity. He did not have a ticket and had to carry the star player’s uniform just to get into the gymnasium. As a sophomore, Jordan briefly played safety on the football team, competed in track and field, and played baseball. He began thinking that perhaps baseball was best suited for his talent. The failure to make the varsity basketball squad enhanced his determination and competitiveness. It embarrassed and irritated him, especially because the team roster was posted for a long time. He did not want that to happen again.\n\n30. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 5 Herring, however, knew that Jordan would make the varsity basketball team as a junior and encouraged him to stop playing football. Herring, who lived a block from the Jordans, picked up Jordan every morning at 6:30 a.m . that fall and drove him to the high school gymnasium for an extra hour of practice before classes started. During those sessions, Jordan worked diligently to improve his skills, fundamentals, and work ethic. “Whenever I was working out and got tired and figured I ought to stop,” he said, “I’d close my eyes and see that list in the locker room without my name on it, and that usually got me going again.” 9 His game improved, and he became more confident. Herring realized Jordan’s potential and urged him to stay focused both athletically and academically. Jordan suddenly grew four inches to six foot three inches. The height change transformed him from a promising all-around athlete to a potential basketball star. THE BLOSSOMING OF A TALENT: 11TH AND 12TH GRADES (1979–1981) Jordan made the varsity basketball squad his junior year, joining his brother, Larry, who wore uniform Number 45. He requested uniform Number 23 because he aspired to be at least half the player his brother was. “Mike was real skinny,” teammate Kevin Edwards recounted, “and we called him ‘Peanut’ because of the way his head was shaped.” 10 Jordan, though, possessed much larger hands than Edwards and towered over other family members. He added strength to his quickness and began dunking the ball. Laney, led by Jordan, finished 13–10 and verged on being an excel-lent basketball team. Jordan enjoyed an impressive junior season at power forward, averaging 20.8 points. He played with intensity and practiced the hardest, working out every morning before school. Jordan implored his teammates to play harder and urged his coaches to inspire them more. Herring wanted Jordan to shoot more, but he declined. Jordan was not even included among the 300 leading high school prospects before his senior year. Jordan liked athletics more than academics. He disliked doing home-work, but Deloris made sure he did it anyway rather than waste time watching television. She adamantly insisted that he make good grades and that academics take priority over basketball. Jordan described himself as a C+ or B- student before entering high school. He often sneaked out of his biology class to practice his jump shot in the gym. After doing that so many times one year, Jordan was suspended from school. James warned Michael to cease this behavior because he had special athletic ability.\n\n31. 6 MICHAEL JORDAN By high school graduation, Jordan had raised his academic average to a 3.2 or 3.3 grade point average and could have earned a college academic scholarship. He increasingly realized the importance of getting a good education and performed well in math, science, and his other precollege courses. Jordan also took a home economics course. “I wanted to learn how to cook and clean and sew,” he explained. “I figured no girl would ever want to marry me, and I didn’t know if I’d have enough money to eat out.” 11 Jordan wanted to be admired and respected by his classmates, but encountered difficulty getting dates and often drew taunts for playing basketball with his tongue wagging. In February 1979, Mike Brown, athletic director of the New Hanover (Wilmington) County schools, phoned Roy Williams, a University of North Carolina assistant basketball coach, about Jordan. “There’s this junior down here at Laney that’s starting to really come on,” Brown noted. Bill Guthridge, North Carolina’s top assistant basketball coach, saw Jordan play once that season and told revered head basketball coach Dean Smith that he took quite a few jump shots, exhibited exceptional quickness and great hands, and tried hard. “He’s unmilked,” 12 Guthridge observed. Although possessing natural athletic skills, Jordan still needed to learn a lot. Guthridge concluded that Jordan probably could compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference. North Carolina scouted him and monitored his development. During the summer of 1980, Williams arranged for Jordan to attend Smith’s prestigious basketball camp. Neither Smith, Williams, nor assistant coach Eddie Fogler had seen him play. Approximately 400 high schoolers, including heralded prospects Buzz Peterson and Lynnwood Robinson, attended. Jordan dominated the camp. After Jordan’s group finished a scrimmage on the first day, Williams asked him if he wanted to continue scrimmaging. Jordan agreed and played another game. He was supposed to leave after that scrimmage, but sneaked back for a third session. Williams liked Jordan’s athletic skills, quickness, jumping ability, defensive intensity, and nose for the ball and boasted to Fogler, “That’s the best six-foot-four-inch high school player I’ve ever seen.” 13 They told Smith about his stellar performance. Smith, who saw Jordan play the next morning for the first time, especially noticed his quickness and competitiveness and also liked his defensive potential and jumping ability. Williams considered Jordan to be North Carolina’s top recruit. Jordan began to show explosive athletic moves, driving to the basket, reversing himself, and scoring effortlessly. He enjoyed playing basketball, exuding a natural self-confidence, and realized that he possessed virtually unlimited\n\n32. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 7 potential if he applied himself. Smith lunched with him twice. The coaching staff urged his family to strongly consider North Carolina. Williams suggested that the Jordans send Michael to Howard Garfinkel’s prestigious Five-Star Camp near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that summer. Prospects competed there against the nation’s best high school players. The other North Carolina coaches were concerned that other universities would notice Jordan’s talent. Smith advised, “It would be better for us if we didn’t send him up there for everybody else to see.” 14 Williams and Fogler countered that North Carolina could learn how good Jordan really was against premier talent. Jordan was excited, but apprehensive about the camp. Unlike many other attendees, he had received very few inquiries from colleges. Jordan told himself, “You must emerge as somebody—somebody to be admired, to achieve big things. But don’t lose your identity.” 15 He played well against the nation’s best young players. Garfinkel, an astute appraiser of talent, saw Jordan showcase his physical ability and he raved that that week was the moment a star was born. Jordan stole a ball, sped down the court, and gently laid the ball in the basket. According to Garfinkel, he was quicker than the other players, possessed great jumping ability, and played with exceptional poise and control. Garfinkel persuaded Jordan’s parents to let him stay another week at the camp. Jordan relished the opportunity to improve his game. Jordan, however, did not make any prospective high school basketball All-America lists. Garfinkel told Dave Krider, who selected the players for Street and Smith, that he considered Michael among the nation’s 10 best prospects. Although Krider had never heard of Jordan, Garfinkel insisted that he be included on the All-American team. He predicted “the kid’s going to be a great star, and they’ll make fun of you if you don’t have him.” 16 Krider phoned back several hours later that it was too late to include Jordan’s name. Jordan won five trophies the first week and was named the camp’s Most Valuable Player, besting 17 high school All-Americas. Peterson also performed well there. Jordan edged him in the one-on-one championship. He suggested that they attend North Carolina as room-mates, dreaming they could win a national championship there. They exchanged telephone numbers and agreed to stay in contact. Jordan considered attending UCLA, North Carolina State University, North Carolina, the University of South Carolina, or the University of Maryland. He preferred UCLA, but the Bruins never recruited him. As a youth, Jordan rooted for North Carolina State because of its star, David Thompson, and disliked the University of North Carolina. Smith’s camp\n\n33. 8 MICHAEL JORDAN and personal interest influenced him to reconsider North Carolina. South Carolina and Maryland also recruited Jordan. The Jordans accompanied Michael on his visits to Chapel Hill. Their involvement convinced Smith that Jordan was serious about attending North Carolina. In the fall of 1980, Smith, Guthridge, and Fogler visited the Jordans in the living room of their spacious Wilmington home. Jordan sat on the floor palming and stroking a basketball. The Jordans asked many questions, mostly about academics. Deloris appreciated Smith’s emphasizing the importance of education and disciplined work habits rather than the glories of Tar Heel basketball. Jordan’s sister, Roslyn, who graduated from high school in three years, also planned to attend North Carolina. Williams and Fogler befriended the Jordans during Michael’s senior year. Williams told James that he liked to chop wood for exercise and wanted to make a wood stove for his house. Unbeknownst to Williams, James made wood stoves for a hobby and loved to give them to friends. James built a wood stove for Williams and delivered it to his house. Williams insisted on paying for it, but James refused to accept any money. After being persuaded by Deloris, Jordan signed a letter of intent to attend North Carolina in November 1980. The Jordans liked the North Carolina basketball tradition, Smith, and especially Williams. Jordan enjoyed meeting prominent North Carolina athletes Kelvin Bryant, Lawrence Taylor, Al Wood, James Worthy, and Sam Perkins sitting on “The Wall,” the brick fence encircling the campus library. Jordan’s reputation blossomed his senior year. Smith saw him perform well against formidable Southern Wayne High School. Jordan recorded a triple-double, averaging double figures at in least three different statistical categories. He averaged 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists as a senior. Wilmington finished 19–4, but a fluky regional tournament setback kept them from the state tournament. Jordan helped persuade Peterson, the state’s Mr. Basketball and top athlete, to attend North Carolina. They played in the Capital Classic in Washington, D.C., McDonald’s All-American Game in Wichita, Kansas, and National Sports Festival in Syracuse, New York. Jordan made the McDonald’s All-American team and started at guard in the McDonald’s classic, converting 13 of 17 shots and scoring 30 points. Adrian Branch, a Maryland recruit who scored 24 points, won the MVP Award because his baskets came at more crucial times, but Jordan appeared the most dominant player. Deloris protested the decision and approached judges John Wooden and Sonny Hill, but Guthridge intervened. CBS\n\n34. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 9 announcer Billy Packer consoled Deloris, “It’s only an all-star game. . . . I think your son has a great career ahead of him.” 17 THE SHOT HEARD ROUND THE NATION (1981–1982) Jordan arrived on the University of North Carolina campus in August 1981 with a basketball scholarship; he majored in geography. He roomed with Buzz Peterson, a reserve from a prominent business family whom he had befriended when both were prep All-Americas. “What impressed me most about Michael was his love for his parents and family,” Peterson recalled. He described Jordan as “a fun guy to be around,” but “deadly serious” 18 on the basketball court. North Carolina had supplanted UCLA as the nation’s premier collegiate basketball program. The Tar Heels had reached the NCAA Final Four six times during coach Dean Smith’s tenure and were eliminated in the 1981 NCAA semifinals. North Carolina was ranked Number 1 in preseason polls and returned four starters, including senior Jimmy Black, junior James Worthy, and sophomores Sam Perkins and Matt Doherty. Smith’s very disciplined program featured the team over the individual. Smith believed that the maximum results were achieved when players sacrificed individuality for the team. Smith realized that Jordan was a little apprehensive and brought him along slowly. Some Emsley A. Laney High School friends predicted that Jordan would not succeed in basketball there and urged him to attend the University of North Carolina-Wilmington. “They thought I’d sit on the bench for four years, come home and work at the local gas station,” Jordan recalled. Jordan initially doubted if he could compete with the talented North Carolina players and did not dominate his freshman year. “I thought I would go in and be a flop,” Jordan admitted. “Everyone was expecting so much.” Smith encouraged him to have fun playing basket-ball and work diligently, and assured him “you will get the opportunity to play.” 19 Jordan followed his advice and gradually gained self-confidence. Jordan quickly learned that he could fulfill expectations during campus pickup games with Worthy, Mitch Kupchak, and Al Wood before the Tar Heels’ first practice. Wood was guarding Jordan, with the score tied and the next basket to determine the winner. Jordan went to the baseline, drove past Wood and seven-foot Geff Crompton, and dunked the ball. The game winner gave him motivation to push further. Jordan began telling upperclassmen in pickup games that he would dunk the ball and\n\n35. 10 MICHAEL JORDAN usually backed up his promises. He amazed teammates with his offensive acceleration, exceptional moves to the basket, and dazzling defensive plays. Upperclassmen considered him cocky, but he assured Smith that he could help North Carolina immediately. Worthy, Perkins, Black, and Doherty were pictured on the front cover of Sports Illustrated ’s annual preseason college basketball issue. Larry Keith, college basketball editor, told Smith that the picture would look peculiar with just four players and urged him to include Jordan. “He made him-self and the others available,” Keith said, “but he was adamant about not letting a freshman get that attention.” 20 Jordan desperately wanted to make the starting five. During Smith’s 20-year tenure, Phil Ford, Mike O’Koren, and Worthy were the only freshmen starters. Freshmen practiced against the varsity but usually made cameo appearances in games because Smith feared they would make criti-cal mistakes. Jordan battled junior Jimmy Braddock and Peterson to replace guard Al Wood. Smith regarded Braddock as a better outside shooter and ball handler; considered Peterson very athletic, more experienced, better coached, and a finer pure shooter; and regarded Jordan a better jumper, quicker, a superior defender, and more motivated. He did not know that Jordan possessed a compulsion to be the best and a rare ability to motivate himself. Jordan readily learned the guard position and new defensive techniques. He had played forward in high school, but Smith wanted him to play big guard. Smith did not name players as starters unless they demonstrated superior skill and defensive execution. Jordan mastered the guard drills so quickly that Smith knew he would see extensive action. To contend for a starting position, however, Jordan needed to be a more complete player defensively. Smith and Williams pushed Jordan to work harder in practices. Jordan assured Williams, “I’m working as hard as everyone else.” Williams replied, “But Michael, you told me you wanted to be the best. And if you want to be the best, then you have to work harder than anyone else.” Jordan responded, “Coach, I understand. You’ll see. Watch.” 21 He consequently began to take his game to another level. Smith spent considerable time explaining defensive techniques and how to counter backdoor plays. Jordan had been taught to turn and defend facing the ball, but Smith wanted him to look over his shoulder and see both player and ball. Smith walked through each step of this technique with him. Jordan amazed Smith by executing the technique perfectly at the next practice. Two preseason Blue-White scrimmages helped Smith determine the starting lineup. Jordan convinced Smith “he knew our principles defensively\n\n36. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 11 better than most freshmen.” 22 Two days before the season opener, Smith selected Jordan over Braddock at big guard. His athletic ability, quickness, offensive creativity, enthusiasm, work ethic, and innate athletic intelligence impressed Smith. Smith informed Jordan that he was starting just before the first game against the University of Kansas at Charlotte Coliseum. Jordan was jubilant about joining Worthy, Perkins, Doherty, and Black in the start-ing lineup. North Carolina proved ideal for Jordan, who played with experienced, talented teammates in a demanding, disciplined program. Smith’s tightly organized practices challenged Jordan and proved excellent learning experiences for him. Jordan worked hard to improve, learned quickly, and showed exceptional concentration; but his defense, passing skills, and outside shot needed improvement. According to Smith, Jordan’s exceptionally large hands made it more difficult for him to shoot. Smith and about half the players called him Michael; the North Carolina media guide and remaining teammates referred to him as Mike. Sports information director Rick Brewer asked him how he preferred to be listed in the media guide. Jordan replied that he had no preference. Brewer claimed that Michael sounded better. Jordan nodded his approval and has been called that ever since. He wore uniform Number 23 and long, loose-fitting baggy shorts. Opponents often used a zone defense against North Carolina in 1981–1982, denying Worthy and Perkins the ball on the inside, while giving Jordan, Doherty, and Black open shots. Smith advised his guards not to take quick outside shots, but rather wait patiently for high percentage shots. North Carolina implemented Smith’s strategy well, averaging 67 points and restricting opponents to just 55 points. The Tar Heels shot 53.7 percent, with Perkins and Worthy both averaging more than 57 percent, Jordan more than 53 percent, and Doherty and Black more than 51 percent. Opponents often resorted to ball control, but the Tar Heels used their four corners delay game with leads. On December 26, North Carolina defeated second-ranked University of Kentucky, 82–69, at the New Jersey Meadowlands. The Wildcats applied a packed-in zone, forcing the Tar Heels to rely on jump shots. Jordan shot inconsistently in the first half, but finished with 19 points in 35 minutes. North Carolina was ranked first nationally by midseason, and Jordan was the leading scorer. North Carolina and the second-ranked University of Virginia, led by seven foot, four inch center Ralph Sampson, split two regular- season games and shared first place in the ACC. Wake Forest University inflicted the Tar Heels’ only other loss when influenza sidelined Perkins. North\n\n37. 12 MICHAEL JORDAN Carolina faced Virginia in the ACC tournament championship game to determine which school would stay in the NCAA East Regional at nearby Charlotte and Raleigh. No national champion had ever reached the NCAA Final Four from outside its natural region. Jordan spent five days in the infirmary with a bad throat infection but recovered by the ACC tournament. In that ACC title game, Jordan converted four consecutive jump shots to give North Carolina a 44–43 lead with 7 minutes and 34 seconds left. Smith instructed the Tar Heels to spread their offense with his patented four corners and not shoot again unless Sampson and the Virginia zone moved away from the basket. The Cavaliers let nearly five minutes elapse before starting to foul North Carolina. With 28 seconds left, Virginia accumulated enough fouls to send Doherty to the line. Doherty converted one foul shot, giving the Tar Heels a 45–43 lead. After North Carolina regained possession, Doherty sank two more free throws with three seconds remaining. Sampson’s meaningless dunk at the buzzer produced the 47–45 final score. James Madison University nearly upset the Tar Heels in the second round of the NCAA East regionals at Charlotte. Worthy scored North Carolina’s last five points, giving the Tar Heels a narrow 52–50 victory. North Carolina spread the court late in the second halves to preserve victories over the University of Alabama and Villanova University at Raleigh and make the NCAA Final Four. In the NCAA semifinals at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Tar Heels shot 76 percent in the second half to defeat the high- scoring University of Houston, 68–63. Houston featured All-America guard Rob Williams, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Clyde Drexler. Perkins tallied 25 points and 10 rebounds, but Williams tallied only two points. North Carolina faced Georgetown University in the NCAA cham-pionship game before 61,612 fans and a huge national television audi-ence. Georgetown, coached by John Thompson, played pressure defense with 7-foot 1-inch All-America freshman Patrick Ewing and three quick guards. North Carolina countered with speed, power, finesse, and excel-lent passing. Smith had not won an NCAA title in six previous Final Four appearances. Georgetown displayed tenacious defense, with Ewing being called for goaltending on five of the first nine North Carolina shots. The Hoyas led, 32–31, at halftime. Ewing and Eric “Sleepy” Floyd combined for 18 points; Worthy tallied 18 points. Jordan delivered the best performance of his freshman season, leading both teams with nine rebounds, scor-ing 12 points in the first 24 minutes, setting up two monster dunks by\n\n38. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 13 Worthy, and playing great defense. He prevented a sure Ewing basket by intercepting a pass and finding Worthy for another flying slam dunk to give the Tar Heels a 57–56 lead. North Carolina used its four corners offense. Black drew Ewing’s fourth foul and converted both free throws, widening the lead to 59–56 with 5 minutes and 30 seconds left. After Georgetown’s Fred Brown made two free throws, North Carolina ran two minutes off the clock. Jordan spotted a slight opening and drove down the middle lane to the basket. Ewing tried to block his path. Jordan, already airborne, switched the ball to his left hand and laid it up just over Ewing’s outstretched arm. The ball touched high off the glass and gently through the net, giving the Tar Heels a 61–58 lead. Georgetown regained the lead, 62–61, on baskets by Ewing and Floyd. Smith called a timeout with 32 seconds left. He preferred to get the ball inside to Worthy or Perkins, but he figured Georgetown’s pressure defense would deny them the ball. Smith anticipated that Jordan would be open and instructed the other players to pass the ball to him for the final shot. “Take the first great shot, and pound the boards,” he instructed Jordan. Smith uncharacteristically trusted a talented freshman to take the decisive shot. He tapped him on the knee and said, “If it comes to you, Michael, knock it in.” 23 When play resumed, Jordan breathed deeply and just waited. Black took the inbound pass but found neither Worthy nor Perkins open. He faked a pass to Perkins and passed to Jordan, who sank an open 16-foot corner jump shot with 17 seconds left to put North Carolina ahead, 63–62. The arena roared at what North Carolinians termed “The Shot.” Jordan shut his eyes after releasing the ball and admitted, “I honestly did not know that the shot had gone in until Georgetown took the ball out of bounds.” 24 At crunch time, Jordan always wanted the ball. “He didn’t have a hesitation or a doubt that he was going to shoot the ball,” 25 Doherty recollected. A picture of Jordan launching the shot became the cover of the Chapel Hill phone book. The Hoyas pushed the ball down court quickly, but Jordan blocked the lane when Fred Brown tried to pass to Floyd. Brown instead threw an errant pass to Worthy, who missed two foul shots with two seconds remaining. Georgetown’s desperation 50-foot shot missed at the buzzer, preserving North Carolina’s 63–62 victory. Smith, who won his first NCAA title, told Thompson, “It was the best team we played all year, and it was our best game.” 26 The Tar Heels shot 53.2 percent in the classic game; the Hoyas converted 52.9 percent. Worthy led North Carolina with 28 points and won the NCAA Final Four Award, and Ewing paced Georgetown with 23 points.\n\n39. 14 MICHAEL JORDAN The decisive basket marked the making of the legendary Jordan. Fogler observed, “That kid doesn’t realize it yet, but he’s part of history now. People will remember that shot 25 years from now.” 27 The 19-year-old Jordan won acclaim for his graceful success under immense pressure, per-forming in a way that few freshmen could. Classmate Davis Love noted, “He wanted the ball in that situation. How many freshmen would have that confidence to take it, then make it?” 28 Smith, impressed with Jordan’s intelligence and court savvy, was amazed by how often he played heroic roles at crunch time. Although later winning six NBA titles, Jordan con-sidered the 1981 NCAA Championship his favorite moment. “It’s hard to outrank Carolina,” he explained,“because that started everything. The confidence, the knowledge, and everything I gained from that, is without question the beginning of Michael Jordan.” 29 James warned him, “Your life will never be the same after that shot.” 30 Michael’s dramatic shot relieved Smith, who had taken six previous North Carolina teams to the NCAA Final Four without winning a national title. Smith gleamed, “I would never have to answer another question about not winning a national championship. That so-called monkey was off my back.” At a press conference, Smith acknowledged, “we were the best team in college basketball in 1982.” He added, “We were solid defensively, difficult to stop on offense, and a good rebounding team. Also we were mentally tough.” 31 Besides playing smart and unselfishly, his youthful squad remained healthy. Several Tar Heels won personal accolades, and the NCAA title benefited the basketball program. Worthy was named national Player of the Year and made first team All-America with Perkins. Jordan garnered NCAA Freshman of the Year honors, averaging 13.5 points and four rebounds in 34 games and performing brilliantly in the clutch. North Carolina signed another highly rated recruiting class, featuring center Brad Daugherty and guards Steve Hale and Curtis Hunter. A MOVE TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS (1982–1983) Under Smith, Jordan learned tight all-around team play and mastered rebounding and defense. After the title season, Smith told Jordan that he needed to improve his defense. As a freshman, Jordan did not win one defensive game award. If he worked hard on his defense over the summer, he could become a more complete player. Smith explained that good defense ultimately won games and remained consistent even when the offense struggled. Jordan worked so diligently on his defense that summer\n\n40. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 15 that he became more interested in defense than offense. Smith also asked Jordan to improve his left-handed dribble and his outside shot because the ACC was adopting the shot clock and three-point shot. Jordan toiled assiduously on each facet of his game. His extraordinary athletic gifts, determination, and work ethic astonished Smith. “I have never seen that kind of improvement in anyone, ever,” Smith observed. “We weren’t prepared for the exponential leap he made in his game.” 32 Besides being more mature physically, Jordan was a more consistent shooter and savvier player. By August, Jordan exhibited new confidence and a quiet swagger. He already possessed the qualities to become a great player, but his confidence matched his physical talent. Jordan looked impressive during preseason pickup games against established NBA players Mike O’Koren, Al Wood, Dudley Bradley, Phil Ford, Mitch Kupchak, and Walter Davis, Tar Heel returnees Perkins and Doherty, and incoming freshmen. He once soared over Davis to dunk the ball with tongue wagging and eyes wide open. During these games, Jordan became the most dominant player. Besides scoring at will, he elevated the weaker phases of his game and performed moves that could not be taught. Jordan seemed bigger, faster, and stronger at fall practice. He had grown from six feet, four inches to six feet, six inches and ran the 40-yard sprint in 4.39 seconds, .16 of a second faster than during his freshman year. His height and speed complemented his talent, passion, and willingness to accept coaching advice, making him a dominant player. He almost always won the one-on-one drills against Hale, Peterson, and Braddock, frequently dunking the ball. After observing one practice, Philadelphia 76ers coach Billy Cunningham proclaimed “He’s going to be the greatest player who ever came out of here.” 33 Jordan needed to win whether in practice, basketball games, or other activities. At some practices, Smith played Jordan with four nonstarters to let him experience the desperation of getting blown out in scrimmages. Jordan developed a disdain for losing and the foundation of a killer instinct. Smith often stacked five-on-five games against him, but his team usually prevailed anyway. Every competition meant life or death for him, occasionally landing him in trouble. Jordan, Peterson, and their dates were playing Monopoly one night. Jordan threw the Monopoly board and stormed out of the room when Peterson built hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place. “I stayed with my sister that night,” he recalled. “I just couldn’t face Buzz.” 34 As a sophomore, Jordan played small forward. Although Worthy and Black graduated, North Carolina ranked first nationally in 1982–1983\n\n41. 16 MICHAEL JORDAN preseason polls. Jordan, Perkins, Doherty, Braddock, and Warren Martin returned from the national championship team; 16-year-old center Daugherty and guards Hunter and Hale gave the Tar Heels considerable depth. Injuries, however, intervened. Jordan broke his hand and played with a hard cast during the first four games, and injuries also slowed Perkins and Daugherty. North Carolina dropped its first two games at the Univer-sity of Missouri and St. John’s University and struggled to win three of its next four contests. Jordan showcased his exceptional defensive ability, natural basketball instincts, and blazing speed, usually being assigned to guard two players. He often freelanced, stealing the ball at very opportu-nity. His 22-foot jump shot against Tulane University forced overtime in North Carolina’s initial victory. In late December, the Tar Heels won the Rainbow Classic in Honolulu, Hawaii. Jordan’s road to glory continued on January 12 at Chapel Hill, where he blocked Chuck Driesell’s shot to preserve a 72–71 victory over the University of Maryland. In the rematch at College Park later that month, Jordan took an outlet pass from Perkins, accelerated toward the basket, and launched an experimental Air Jordan dunk. He moved laterally while elevating toward the basket. “Before you know it,” he recalled, “I’m cranking the ball back, rocking it left to right, cuffing it before I put it down. Every breakaway after that seemed like a chance to try something new.” 35 North Carolina defeated Virginia twice. The Tar Heels snapped the top-ranked Cavaliers’ 34-game winning streak in January in Charlottesville, where Perkins tallied a career-high 36 points in the 101–95 upset. Near the end, Jordan stunned the crowd by soaring across the lane to block Ralph Sampson’s shot. North Carolina extended its victory streak to 18 games against Virginia at Chapel Hill on February 10, when Jordan sparked a comeback. Virginia exploited Sampson’s enormous size, amass-ing a 16-point lead with nine minutes left, and still led, 63–53, with 4 minutes and 12 seconds left. Braddock’s three pointer, coupled with two free throws each by Doherty and Perkins, sliced the margin to 63–60 with 2 minutes and 54 seconds remaining. Jordan scored with 1 minute and 7 seconds left and stole the ball from Rick Carlisle. After driving toward the basket, he ascended with his arm cocked and slam-dunked the ball to put North Carolina ahead, 64–63. The crowd reached a frenzied pitch. After Carlisle missed a last second shot, Jordan snatched the rebound to preserve the victory. The Tar Heels finished eighth nationally with a 28–8 record, sharing first place in the ACC with Virginia. Injuries sidelined Peterson and Hunter for the rest of the season, and Daugherty played with a stress foot fracture. North Carolina lost to eventual NCAA champion North\n\n42. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 17 Carolina State University in the ACC Tournament semifinals at Atlanta. The University of Georgia upset the Tar Heels, 82–77, in the NCAA East regional finals at Syracuse, New York, abruptly ending North Carolina’s quest to repeat as national champions. Georgia continually penetrated North Carolina’s trapping defense. Jordan, benefiting from the ACC’s three-point shot experiment, averaged 20.0 points and 5.5 rebounds in 36 games and won 12 defensive game awards. He earned numerous honors, including All-Atlantic Coast Conference, All-America team, and The Sporting News College Player of the Year, and he ranked second to Sampson in the Associated Press Player of the Year balloting. Jordan led the ACC in scoring and recorded 78 steals, trailing only Dudley Bradley in the North Carolina record books. The Sporting News described his court versatility, “He soars through the air, he rebounds, he scores (more than 1,100 points in two years, a school record), he guards two men at once, he vacuums up loose balls, he blocks shots, he makes steals. Most important, he makes late plays that win games.” 36 The next afternoon, Jordan told Roy Williams that he had been play-ing basketball for two consecutive years without a respite and wanted a breather. Williams encouraged him to take time off and was surprised to find him practicing that night in the gym. Jordan responded that he needed to improve his game. Jordan toured that summer with various All-Star teams and starred in the Pan-American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, where the U.S. basketball team won a gold medal. The South American trip intensified his interest in cultural geography. Peter Alfano observed, “He can excite a crowd like a Sunday morning preacher and lift a team to new heights, and yet people are impressed by his unassuming nature and friendly manner. There are times when he seems too good to be real.” 37 Jordan also enjoyed playing golf with roommate Peterson and future pro golfer Davis Love. NATIONAL AND OLYMPIC HONORS (1983–1984) During Jordan’s junior year, most 1983–1984 preseason polls ranked North Carolina best nationally. Sports Illustrated predicted that the Tar Heels would win the national championship and pictured Jordan with Perkins on the front cover of its college basketball issue. Jordan and Perkins led North Carolina, complemented by Brad Daugherty and Kenny Smith. Besides being stronger and more articulate, Jordan began exhibiting his killer instinct on the court, and Perkins scored from both inside and chal-lenged the Tar Heels’ career rebounding records. Daugherty, slimmer and\n\n43. 18 MICHAEL JORDAN stronger, was the best pure center to play under Smith. Point guard Smith, New York City hoop star, was considered the final link to another NCAA title and became just the fifth Tar Heel to start as a freshman. North Carolina started the 1983–1984 season with 21 consecutive victories, including Smith’s 500th career win. The Tar Heels dominated most opponents, routing Syracuse University at the Carrier Dome and capturing both the Stanford Invitational and the Holiday Classic in New York, but Jordan was disappointed at not making either All-Tournament team. He tried to fulfill his own high expectations and win player of the year awards. Smith told him, “So what if you don’t? Don’t worry about other people’s expectations.” 38 The conversation helped relieve pressure for Jordan. The only close contests were a three-point win at Virginia and a five-point victory at Duke University. During the winning streak, Smith reminded Jordan about the importance of teamwork. Jordan stole the ball against Maryland, sped down the court, and converted a spectacular slam dunk to defeat the Terrapins. As the ecstatic Tar Heels charged into the dressing room, Smith reminded Jordan that Maryland had left Kenny Smith unguarded Jordan displayed his mental fiber when he saw Maryland’s Ben Coleman slap Doherty in the face while running down the court. When Coleman was positioned near the basket late in the game, Jordan dunked the ball right over him and sternly warned him not to hit North Carolina players again. Freshman point guard Kenny Smith broke his left wrist against Louisiana State University and missed nearly a month of play. A 65–64 loss at the University of Arkansas ended the Tar Heels’ 18-game winning streak. North Carolina won its last seven games to finish the regular season 26–1. In the first two games of that winning streak, Jordan tallied 57 points, 14 rebounds, and 9 steals. The Tar Heels ended the regular season by defeating Duke, 96–83, in double overtime in the home finale for Jordan, Perkins, and Doherty. North Carolina fared 14–0 in the ACC, its first undefeated conference record in a decade, and ranked first in the final regular season poll. Jordan experienced a disappointing postseason. Duke upset North Carolina, 77–75, in the ACC Tournament semifinals at Greensboro. Smith’s broken wrist prevented him from dribbling with his left hand and limited his outside shooting, and Daugherty played with injured ligaments in his shooting hand. After defeating Temple University in the NCAA tournament second round, North Carolina was eliminated by Indiana University, 72–68, in the NCAA Eastern Regional semifinals at Atlanta, Georgia. Indiana, coached by Bob Knight, controlled the tempo and denied open shots to Jordan and Perkins. Guard Dan Dakich\n\n44. THE FORMATIVE YEARS 19 shadowed Jordan, challenging his jump shots and denying him dunking and rebounding opportunities. Jordan accumulated two quick fouls and sat out most of the first half. He recorded just 13 points and one rebound in 26 minutes before fouling out. North Carolina finished 28–3 and again missed the NCAA Finals. The Tar Heels averaged 80 points, played excellent defense, and rebounded well, but they watched Georgetown defeat Houston for the NCAA title. Coach Smith dejectedly reflected, “it was the third time that I thought we had the best team in the country.” 39 Smith equated that squad with his stellar 1977 and 1982 aggregates. Jordan averaged 19.6 points, 5.3 rebounds, and approximately 4 assists and 3 steals in 31 games, shooting 55.1 percent as a junior. He fed the ball to Perkins and Daugherty, who shot 59 percent and 61 percent, respectively. Jordan won both the Naismith Award and Wooden Award, repeating as The Sporting News College Player of Year and an All-America. Jordan surged to the forefront as a result of his ability to excel at crunch time. “Jordan,” The Sporting News opined, “is a showman under control. Sometimes Jordan spontaneously performs an electrifying high-wire act.” 40 At other times, he waltzed in for a layup, pulled up for a soft jump shot, or improvised with a critical steal or blocked shot. During Jordan’s three years at North Carolina, the team compiled an 88–13 record and made three NCAA tournaments. He scored 1,788 points for a 17.7 point average and averaged 5.0 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 101 games. He also tallied 165 points in 10 NCAA Tournament games. Coach Smith believed that Jordan had little left to prove at the collegiate level and advised him to enter the National Basketball Association draft. Jordan was ready to adjust to the faster, more challenging NBA. If he remained at North Carolina, Smith anticipated that defenses would use difficult zones against him and triple team him. He also feared that any major injury might hinder Jordan’s professional career. “What’s best for my players always comes first,” 41 Smith counseled. Smith expected Jordan to be drafted high in the first round and called Chicago Bulls Rod Thorn, who held the third pick. Thorn told Smith the Bulls planned to select Jordan if he was still available, but the Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers held the first and second choices. Smith discussed the draft situation with the Jordans at his office two weeks after the season in his office. Houston or Chicago would select Jordan second or third and offer him at least $2.5 million for five or more seasons. James advised Jordan to turn professional, but Deloris wanted him to remain at North Carolina and graduate with his class, which included his sister, Roslyn. Jordan was undecided about turning professional because he\n\n45. 20 MICHAEL JORDAN loved the North Carolina basketball program, coaches, and friendships and wanted to win one more national championship. “An awful lot of people,” he realized, “didn’t feel it was the right thing for me to do.” 42 Fogler, Williams, Guthridge, and many alumni wanted Jordan to remain for his senior year. The Jordans agreed that night that Michael should turn professional and informed Smith the next morning. Deloris realized that entering the NBA draft would delay Jordan’s graduation by only one or two years. Smith assured the Jordans that they had decided wisely. (Indeed, Jordan did graduate with a bachelor’s degree in geography in 1985 and he claims he would have become a meteorologist if he had not pursued professional basketball.) At the press conference, Jordan announced his decision to enter the NBA draft and delay his senior year at North Carolina. Smith also guided Jordan through the agent process. Jordan chose Donald Dell and David Falk of Pro Serv to represent him in contract negotiations. Smith asked Dell to call Thorn to discuss contract terms if the Chicago Bulls drafted Jordan. Jordan remained passionate about North Carolina and coach Smith, who he considered “[m]y second father.” 43 “I wasn’t going to the NBA until he advised me to do it,” 44 he confided. Smith knew that Jordan would play guard in the NBA and made him play the point in pickup games that spring. He had taught Jordan great discipline to accompany his natural ability and how to behave both on and off the court. Jordan later wrote, “He was the perfect guy for me. He kept me humble, but he challenged me. He gave me confidence.” 45 Smith attributed Jordan’s North Carolina success to his athleticism and diligent work ethic. “Michael,” he reflected, “was extremely gifted athletically and is perhaps the most competitive person I know.” His incredible determination to improve in all facets of the game provided an excellent role model for others. Smith concluded, “Nobody I know works harder at his craft than Michael Jordan.” 46 Jordan had listened carefully to Smith’s instruction, applied what he was learning, and worked hard daily. NOTES 1.

Chapter 2 THE BUILDING YEARS, 1984–1988 WELCOME TO THE NBA (1984–1985) The Chicago Bulls, who owned the second worst NBA record in 1983– 1984, desperately needed a superstar to move them out of the doldrums. The Bulls had not made the NBA playoffs since 1980–1981 and had won more games than it lost only twice in nine seasons. They selected third after the Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA draft on June 20 at the Conrad Hilton Hotel in New York City. Houston chose Hakeem Olajuwon, a 7-foot Nigerian center and University of Houston star, and Portland picked Sam Bowie, a 7-foot 1-inch University of Kentucky center. Olajuwon developed into an NBA star, winning two NBA titles. Chicago Bulls general manager Rod Thorn drafted Jordan. He preferred a center, but Olajuwon was not available. “Jordan isn’t going to turn this franchise around,” Thorn predicted. “I wouldn’t ask him to.” Chicago fans, who had assembled two floors below, enthusiastically shouted “ Jordan, Jordan” loud enough for Thorn to hear. Bulls assistant coach Mike Thibault observed, “He’s one of those players who comes along once a decade,” 1 and Chicago Tribune columnist Bernie Lincicome ventured that Jordan “maybe the greatest natural basketball talent, inch for inch, in this young decade.” 2 Jordan performed that August on the star-studded U.S. basketball team, which included Patrick Ewing of Georgetown University and Steve Alford of Indiana University, at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. The American squad, coached by Bob Knight of Indiana, moved faster,\n\n49. 24 MICHAEL JORDAN leaped higher, and drove stronger, routing opponents by 32 points per game and overwhelming Spain, 96–65, for the gold medal. “We can put any five we have out there and get the job done,” 3 Jordan insisted. Jordan, the flashiest Olympian, penetrated zone defenses for at least one dunk per game. He dunked three shots against Uruguay and sank a 28-foot jump shot at the first half buzzer against Spain. He finished that preliminary game with 24 points, the best for any American Olympian. After the gold medal game, Fernando Martin of Spain described Jordan, “Jump, jump, jump. Very quick. Very fast. Very very good.” 4 Knight remarked that Jordan possessed immense talent, exhibited natural leadership, played tenacious defense, and was very competitive and coachable. An ultimate perfectionist, however, Knight considered Jordan a subpar shooting guard and occasionally admonished him during games. When Jordan carelessly dribbled the ball out of bounds against West Germany, Knight bellowed, “Michael, get in the game!” 5 During the gold medal game against Spain, Knight yelled, “when are you going to start setting some screens—all you do is rebound and score!” Jordan smiled, “Coach, didn’t I read some place where you said I was the quick-est player you ever coached?” Knight responded affirmatively. “Coach, I set those screens faster than you could see them,” 6 Jordan answered. He became one of the most reliable perimeter players and contributed might-ily to the gold medal. He likened Knight to Dean Smith except that the former used four-letter words while the latter used the four-corner offense. George Raveling, assistant Olympic coach, lauded Jordan as “probably the best athlete playing college basketball.” 7 After receiving his gold medal, Jordan touchingly placed it around Deloris’s neck. The Olympics enhanced Jordan’s leverage in contract negotiations with the Bulls. Agents Donald Dell and David Falk of the ProServ Agency rep-resented him. He signed a seven-year, $6.3 million contract, larger than any NBA rookie except for Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson. At a Chicago press conference, he revealed, “I’m anxious to meet the team and start fitting in with them.” 8 Dell also lined up prospective advertisers, giving assurance that Jordan had “a charisma that transcends his sport” and that he belonged “in a category with Arnold Palmer or Arthur Ashe.” 9 Michael, articulate, well mannered, and hardworking, was a mass-market icon who appealed to all demographic groups, transcending age and race barriers. Falk obtained a commercial endorsement with struggling Nike athletic shoes. He believed that the popular Jordan could increase Nike shoe sales and profit hand-somely from those sales. Jordan signed a seven-year contract with Nike, which designed the signature Air Jordan shoe. Nike guaranteed him $18\n\n50. THE BUILDING YEARS 25 million and a royalty on every Air Jordan shoe sold. The Air Jordans sold very well in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The hype and demand for the Air Jordans even sparked “shoe-jackings,” where young boys were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. The innovation of designer Tinker Hatfield spurred the basketball shoe industry to new heights. The Air 180 Shoe, introduced in 1991, likewise featured Jordan and was advertised worldwide. Jordan admitted, “I never knew it could be nation-based—or, if you want, world-based.” 10 He also endorsed McDonald’s fast-food chain, Wilson Sporting Goods basketballs, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet automobiles, Johnson Products, Excelsior International, and Guy LaRoche watches. Jordan, who possessed an effervescent smile, owned a townhouse in Northbrook, a Chicago suburb. Before being married, he handled his personal shopping and housecleaning. Jordan spent free time watching videotapes of games, following stock car racing, bowling, playing pool, and listening to music. He often sought the counsel of coach Smith on basketball and other matters and enjoyed little social life, considering “the game (his) wife.” 11 He traveled to home games in his silver Corvette, often chatting with maintenance and food-concession workers and sign-ing autographs. Jordan began practicing with the Bulls in September 1984, dominating the camp with his work ethic. He played primarily for the love of the game rather than financial remuneration, always arriving first at practice and leaving last. Jordan never relaxed in practice because he was the highest paid Bull and wanted teammates to understand he was worth it. He felt pressure “to prove I deserved to play on that level.” 12 He worked diligently to improve his jump shot and was virtually unstoppable in one-on-one drills. After watching Jordan make a resounding dunk, coach Kevin Lough-ery told general manager Thorn,“I think we’ve hit the jackpot.” 13 Jordan exhibited exceptional athletic ability and boundless energy, using superior speed, jumping ability, strength, and huge hands to create his shot. Loughery dismissed practice early once because Jordan was exhausting his teammates. He also devised a strategy in practice to hone Jordan’s skills as a clutch player. At practice, Loughery pitted the five best players against the next five best in a simulated game. Jordan’s team usually built an 8–1 or 9–2 lead, with 11 baskets needed to win. Loughery then switched Jordan to the losing team. Jordan, who usually got that team back in the scrimmage game, built his confidence the most during those workouts. Jordan initially found the transition to the NBA somewhat difficult. The North Carolina basketball program had been first rate, well designed, and brilliantly organized with outstanding coaches.
