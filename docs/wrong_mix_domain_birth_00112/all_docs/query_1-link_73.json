        "text": "It's no secret that President Barack Obama is a huge basketball fan.\n\nKnowing that, former adviser David Axelrod had a great idea for a birthday gift back when Obama turned 50 in 2011.\n\nAxelrod procured a poster of Michael Jordan, and sent it over to \"His Airness\" in hopes of getting it signed for the president.\n\nJordan obliged, except there was one major problem with the gift: The former NBAer spelled Obama's first name wrong.\n\n\"I sent it to Jordan to have him sign it for me,\" Axelrod said, via Marin Cogan of New York Magazine. \"In black Sharpie, Jordan scrawled, 'To Barrack: you still owe me dinner. Wishing you well, Michael Jordan.'\"\n\nAxelrod still attempted to deliver the gift to Obama, even though Jordan misspelled his name.\n\n\"I gave it to the president, and he said, 'I can't put this up, he misspelled my name!' So I said, 'Fine, I'll take it.'\"\n\nAnd that's the story of how the greatest player in NBA history spelled Obama's name wrong.\n\nMore on AOL"
