        "text": "THE 1990s Chicago Bulls have gone down as one of if not the greatest teams in NBA history.\n\nKey to their success were the likes of Hall of Famers Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, while others such as center Bill Wennington flew somewhat under the radar.\n\nThe now 60-year-old Canadian enjoyed a remarkable career that saw him achieve NBA immortality later in life.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Wennington attended Long Island Lutheran Middle and High School in New York before heading to St. John's University in 1981.\n\nAfter four years with the Red Storm, the 7-foot center was selected sixteenth overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1985 NBA Draft - one year after Jordan went third overall.\n\nFive years in Texas followed, during which Wennington failed to nail down a starting spot with the Mavs, starting just fourteen of his 269 appearances for Dallas.\n\nHe was sent to the Sacramento Kings in 1990, where he would start 23 of 77 games that season before making the move abroad.\n\nWennington joined the Italian team Virtus Bologna where he would play for two years before returning to the NBA.\n\nUpon his return in 1993, he signed for legendary coach Phil Jackson's Chicago Bulls joining Pippen and - once he unretired in 1994 - Jordan.\n\nIn six seasons with the Bulls, Wennington would win three NBA Championships, starting 51 of his 367 games for the team.\n\nIn an interview with SportsCenter prior to the release of the final episode of the ESPN and Netflix docuseries The Last Dance which covered the 1997 Bulls, Wennington reflected on that final championship-winning team.\n\nNow bald with a bushy white beard, the almost unrecognizable Canadian explained how what stood out was \"The chemistry of that team and how everyone got along.\"\n\nWennington added how he felt that the fact that this chemistry ultimately \"helped us play a lot better,\" while noting how \"it was competitive and everyone was competitive, especially Michael pushing everyone to be better.\"\n\nFollowing that final title, Wennington remained in Chicago for one more year before one last season with the Kings ahead of his retirement.\n\nSince stepping away from the court, he has gone on to become a color commentator for Bulls radio."
