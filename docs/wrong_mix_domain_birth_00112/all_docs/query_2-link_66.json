        "text": "James Naismith (born November 6, 1861, Almonte, Ontario, Canada—died November 28, 1939, Lawrence, Kansas, U.S.) was a Canadian-American physical-education director who, in 1891, invented the game of basketball as a way to make physical education more enjoyable and less dangerous. ,\n\n(Read James Naismith’s 1929 Britannica essay on inventing basketball.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nSpot the Canadian Quiz\n\nAs a young man, Naismith studied theology and excelled in various sports. In the autumn of 1891 he was named an instructor by Luther Halsey Gulick, Jr., head of the Physical Education Department at the International Young Men’s Christian Association Training School, in Springfield, Massachusetts Gulick asked Naismith and other instructors to devise indoor games that could replace the boring or dangerous exercises used at the school during the winter. For his new game Naismith selected features of football (soccer), American football, field hockey, and other outdoor sports but (in theory) eliminated body contact between players. Because his physical education class at that time was composed of 18 men, basketball originally was played by 9 on each side (eventually reduced to 5).\n\nThe first games employed half-bushel peach baskets as targets, so a stepladder was needed to retrieve the ball after infrequent goals. Naismith’s original rules, prohibiting walking or running with the ball and limiting physical contact, are still the basis of a game that spread throughout the world."
