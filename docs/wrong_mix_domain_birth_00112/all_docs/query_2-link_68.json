        "text": "Born November 18, 1988, Jeffrey Jordan pursued basketball at the University of Illinois in 2007, continuing his passion for the sport until 2009. He previously revealed he was inspired by his father to follow his dreams. “The competitive atmosphere shaped us in a way that was for the better and got us prepared for what we were gonna face in the real world,” he said to GMA in 2020. Jeffrey is currently married to Radina Aneva and works on the Jordan label.\n\nBorn December 7, 1992, Jasmine Jordan studied sports management at Syracuse University, where she met her now-husband Rakeen Christmas. The pair welcomed their first son Rakeem Michal Christmas in 2019. She works in marketing for the Jordan brand. “Between him and my mom, they made sure that we felt like he was normal as can be and we grew up very normal and for that I’m grateful,” she said about her childhood to GMA in 2020.\n\nMichael and Yvette prefer to maintain their 9-year-old twins, Victoria and Ysabel, away from the public eye and have yet to share photos on social media. The couple welcomed their two kids in 2014 in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nVictoria and Ysabel are already aunts at a young age, as their half-sister Jasmine is mother to 4-year-old Rakeem. She previously said that her father “loves being a grandpa.” Jasmine explained on Facebook Live that he “had to warm up to [it].” She explained. “At first he wanted my son to call him ‘Mike’ or ‘Michael’ and I’m like, ‘Dad, we’re not doing this. You have to accept the grandpa title. It is what it is.’”"
