        "text": "“There is an I in ‘win.'”\n\nThere is only one athlete that this phrase could be attributed to and it’s the one and only Michael Jordan. The Chicago Bulls star captivated the nation from his college days at North Carolina and used his professional career to break through barriers of what a basketball player could be. Jordan became a global icon in his 15-year NBA career and continues to be an international sensation.\n\nThis was all before the dawn of social media.\n\nToday’s basketball stars, including Kevin Durant, Candace Parker, Damian Lillard, Breanna Stewart and the NBA’s new scoring king, LeBron James, have built fanbases through excellence on and off the court. The importance of a personal brand continues to increase. But Jordan literally created his own brand.\n\nAs the six-time NBA champion celebrates his 60th birthday on Friday, here are 60 facts about his basketball career, pop culture influence and life beyond the hardwood:\n\nMichael Jordan's early days\n\n1. Michael Jordan was born on Feb. 17, 1963 to James and Deloris Jordan. The couple was living in Brooklyn, New York, at the time, but moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, a few years after he was born. Jordan has two older brothers, an older sister and a younger sister.\n\n2. Michael Jordan was motivated as a child by his brother, Larry, who also played basketball. They both wore No. 45 jerseys, but when they played on the same team, the younger brother had to pick a new number. So he cut 45 in half and rounded up to No. 23. He carried it through college, the NBA and into icon status.\n\n3. The only time Michael Jordan wore 45 after committing to 23 was after the return from his first retirement in March of 1995. He finished out the regular season and the first round of the playoffs in the new number before struggling in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals and deciding he had better luck in No. 23.\n\n4. Michael Jordan was very close with his father, James. In “The Last Dance,” he revealed that he was suspended three times during his ninth grade year and his father put him back on track.\n\n“My father pulled me aside that summer,” he shared, “and he said, ‘Look, you don’t look like you’re headed in the right direction. If you want to go about doing all this mischievous stuff, you can forget sports.’ That’s all I needed to hear. It was like from that point on, it was tunnel vision.”\n\n5. His sophomore year, Michael Jordan didn’t make the varsity basketball team at Laney (N.C.) High School. The experience gave him reason to not ever be left off a team again.\n\nMichael Jordan's legend starts at North Carolina\n\n6. As a freshman with the North Carolina Tar Heels, Michael Jordan hit the game-winning jump shot in the victory over the Georgetown Hoyas to win the 1982 national championship.\n\n“That turned my name from Mike to Michael Jordan,” he said in “The Last Dance.” “It gave me the confidence that I needed to start to excel at the game of basketball.”\n\n7.

The legacies of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson weighed heavily on Michael Jordan early in his career since he was known as a scorer, but not a winner. The 1991 NBA Finals in which the Chicago Bulls defeated the Los Angeles Lakers was a big relief to the rising star, who won his first of six championships.\n\n14. Michael Jordan only packed one suit when the Chicago Bulls traveled to play the Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls failed to clinch the title in Game 5 at home.\n\n“We going back to win one game,” he recalled telling the team in “The Last Dance.” “I’m not going there to play two games.”\n\nHe scored 33 points in Game 6 as the Bulls won their third straight title, becoming the the third team in NBA history to accomplish a three-peat.\n\n15.

Chicago wrapped up the series in the next game and Jordan captured his fifth title.\n\n18. Despite initially not appreciating Phil Jackson’s triangle offense, which emphasized team play, Michael Jordan advocated for giving the head coach a contract extension ahead of his last season with the Chicago Bulls.\n\n“Phil should be the head coach and I shouldn’t be put in a position to have to make a choice to play for another coach other than Phil Jackson,” he said in a press conference during the 1995-96 season. “&mldr; Sadly as it may be, I have choices. I will not choose to play for another coach.”\n\n19. Michael Jordan was a mentor to Kobe Bryant, who entered the NBA in 1996, Jordan’s 12th season in the league. Jordan spoke at Bryant’s memorial after he died in 2020 at the age of 41.\n\n20. Madison Square Garden was Michael Jordan’s favorite arena to play in. When he played there in 1998, believing it was his last season of basketball, he broke out an old pair of Air Jordan 1s, which he wore several years before during his debut at the iconic New York venue. He scored 42 points in the game even though his feet were bleeding.\n\n21. Michael Jordan retired a second time in 1998 after capturing his sixth title.
