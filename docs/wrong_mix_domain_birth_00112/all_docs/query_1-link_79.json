        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Michael Jordan has more to be happy about than just the improved play of his NBA franchise.\n\nHis wife, Yvette, has given birth to the couple's identical twin daughters, Jordan's spokeswoman Estee Portnoy told The Associated Press.\n\nPortnoy said Tuesday night Yvette Jordan, 35, gave birth to Victoria and Ysabel on Sunday in West Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\"Yvette Jordan and the babies are doing well and the family is overjoyed at their arrival,\" Portnoy said.\n\nJordan is the owner of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats, who are currently the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference and have a chance to make the post-season for the first time since he took over as majority owner in 2010.\n\nJordan, who turns 51 next Monday, married former model Yvette Prieto on April 27 of last year in Palm Beach, Fla. The reception took place at a private golf club in Jupiter, Fla., designed by Jack Nicklaus. Jordan owns a home near the course.\n\nThe couple met six years ago.\n\nJordan has three children -- two sons, Jeffrey Michael and Marcus James, and a daughter, Jasmine -- with former wife Juanita Vanoy. They divorced in 2006.\n\nJordan won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls and was a 14-time All-Star and five-time league MVP."
