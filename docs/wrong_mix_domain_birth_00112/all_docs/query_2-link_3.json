        "text": "No one expects Andrew Wiggins to suddenly become another Kevin Durant or LeBron James after he joins the Warriors. But, once upon a time, that’s exactly the company some basketball experts predicted Wiggins’ talents would allow him to join.\n\nWiggins brought a lot of baggage with him when joined the Warriors in a four-player trade with Minnesota Wednesday — he was weighed down by a six-year NBA career full of lofty but unfulfilled expectations.\n\n“It’s not always easy to make a name for yourself,” Wiggins said earlier this year. “You’ve gotta earn it. Because nothing’s ever given.”\n\nCertainly, Wiggins has been no bust in the NBA — he was the rookie of the year in 2015 after being the No. 1 overall pick, he’s still only 24 and he’s scored nearly 9,000 points — but superstardom seemed a certainty after one of the best high school careers in years.\n\nThe Toronto-born Wiggins transferred to Huntington Prep in West Virginia after leading Ontario’s Vaughan High to a 44-1 record and a provincial championship. His stock soared at Huntington and he left as the consensus No. 1 player in the country while winning both Naismith and Gatorade player of the year awards, as well as earning Mr. Basketball USA in 2013.\n\nOne recruiting analyst went so far as to say Wiggins could be “The Michael Jordan of Canada.” On the day he announced his commitment to the University of Kansas, “Andrew Wiggins to Kansas” was Twitter’s No. 3 trend worldwide.\n\nLike his new teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, Wiggins is a second-generation NBA player — his dad Mitchell spent six years in the league with three different teams after being a No. 1 draft pick in 1984. So he’s been conditioned for this journey. He once told a reporter who asked if the pressure was too much for a high schooler, “Not really. It’s part of being an elite player, you get attention.”\n\nAnd boy did Wiggins get attention. One NBA general manager later admitted his team was tanking in order to get a chance to draft Wiggins. As Wiggins was preparing to start his one-and-done college career at Kansas, Bleacher Report had this to say about him:\n\n“Canadian-born Andrew Wiggins is the best prospect to enter the league since LeBron James was picked first overall 10 years ago. With more hype than Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose and Kyrie Irving, Wiggins is set to take the NBA by storm 12 months from now, and by all accounts, he will be the standard-bearer for the next generation of superstars.”\n\nOnce at Kansas, Wiggins continued to deliver … until facing Stanford in the NCAA Tournament. After averaging 17.1 points and 5.9 rebounds and making 34.1 percent of his 3-pointers, Wiggins’ freshman season, and hopes for a national title, ended when Stanford beat Kansas to advance to the Sweet 16.\n\nWiggins had his worst game in college in his final game while scoring a career-low four points on 1-for-6 shooting while the No. 2-seeded Jayhawks lost.\n\nTo his credit, Wiggins handled adversity with grace.\n\n“Whenever I went right, I saw three Stanford guys. Whenever I went left, I saw three Stanford guys,” Wiggins said after the 60-57 upset loss. “If I had played better, we’d have won.”\n\nA few months later, the Cavaliers made Wiggins the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. It didn’t take long for him to experience disappointment, though. Shortly after the draft, LeBron James returned to Cleveland and suddenly there wasn’t room for a 19-year-old hot shot rookie.\n\nA month after being drafted by the Cavaliers, Wiggins was on his way to Minnesota in a trade for Kevin Love, LeBron’s preferred playing partner.\n\nSix years and five head coaches later, Wiggins is now a Warrior and still chasing the ever-elusive elite status."
