        "text": "All the previously unreleased video clips featured in “The Last Dance” show Michael Jordan in a light many have never seen before, displaying his ultra-competitive reputation and fiery nature in a different capacity.\n\nIt’s also led to something else: Buzz Peterson questioning his own wardrobe selection and his fashion sense during his teenage days four decades ago.\n\n“Yeah, I’m sure people have been holding on to this film for years,” the Hornets assistant GM told The Athletic. “The part where Michael and I had on green shorts — God almighty. I never knew I owned a pair of green shorts like that. I had no idea. So that’s embarrassing. But I’m sure there is a lot of footage out there that I’m eager to see. I’m eager to see how he played for the Bulls and everything. I know this: If you start running your mouth back to him, you are only stroking that fire, putting more fuel on that fire, and boy it can get going.”\n\nPeterson knows about it just about as well as anybody.\n\nHis friendship with Jordan, now his boss as the Hornets’ owner, goes back to when Jimmy Carter was president. That’s why Peterson can’t help but chuckle watching these Jordan flashbacks. It’s provided him with an opportunity to revisit the birth of their lengthy connection together.\n\n“It’s neat,” Peterson said. “I mean, you think back to the days and the relationship I started with Michael in the summer of 1980, just getting to know his family.”\n\nPeterson spoke with The Athletic about that early bond that formed between the two, the lone person Jordan was “scared” of during their years in Chapel Hill, how frustrated Jordan is that he hasn’t been able to put a consistently winning product on the floor as an owner and more.\n\nWhat did you learn most about Michael once you met him and began interacting with him?\n\nHis parents, what a tremendous job they did of raising those kids. To know Ron and know James and Larry and Roslyn — all of them — they are just a really neat family. A good family. And after a while, you can see how the parents instilled the kids. They are all successful. They all took different paths. And then you look at Michael and you say, “All right, why is he this phenomenal basketball player?”\n\nI’ve always thought this myself: OK, here is the youngest of three boys. They go outside to play ball. James (who’s also known as) Ronnie, you know, he’s a lot older, and so I guess Larry and Michael go against him and he’s probably roughing them up. And Mr. Jordan is there and said, “OK, you two, if you want to get involved, if you want to play with him, don’t come back here crying. Handle your own.” And then he leaves (the nest) and then there’s Larry. And Larry and Michael kind of got this instilled in them. “You better be tough. You’ve got to have this winner’s mentality.”\n\nAnd once you mix the height and that athletic ability that Michael has, and that desire to win was instilled in him, this is what you’ve got. There’s your makeup.\n\nIn the documentary, Michael explained how Larry made him such a competitor. What do you know about those two and the way they used to go at each other?\n\nI met Michael — we met each other going into the summer of our senior year in high school. I didn’t know of him, and he introduced himself as Mike. And that week at Carolina’s camp, I didn’t see him play. He played with my high school teammate in another gym, and I played with his high school teammate in another gym, Leroy Smith. And I played pickup ball with him during that week outside on Granville Towers court, but he was more of a 6-4, I thought, post player. He played a lot inside, didn’t really play outside because he could score so well and rebound. That’s what he did so well.\n\nAnd once he got to Carolina, Coach (Dean) Smith and the staff worked on his perimeter skills, teaching him defense. He just took off. But when he would go home and I would go to their house to Wilmington down 501 on weekends, shoot — Larry, nobody could stop him. Larry was unbelievable. Larry was fast, quick, could jump. I mean, when we played pickup, that’s who you wanted on your team. You wanted Larry on your team because he could get by anybody.\n\nYou were also a top high school recruit in your own right. So how did you end up in Chapel Hill with Michael?\n\nThat’s my claim to fame, to be the high school player of the year (over him). And if we meet strangers or whatever, Michael says, “Yeah, Buzz got that award because in North Carolina there are seven major newspapers and his dad owned six of them. So that’s how he got the award.” But yeah, I remember I went to a BC camp out of high school — Bolton-Cronauer camp. It was in Milledgeville, Ga., and the only way you could get in that camp, you had to be nominated by three Division I head coaches. That’s one of the first things Michael asked me when we were at Granville Towers. He said, “Where have you been to camp?” And I told him I went down there. And he said, “How’d you get into it?” And I said, “My high school coach got me in there. I don’t know how, but he said I had to have a recommendation from college coaches.”\n\nAnd I could tell that bothered him. Because he kept asking me, and every time, he’d turn his head to the side and said, “Hmmm. Three coaches?” I said, “Yeah.” He said, “They’ve got another week of it.” And I said, “No, they don’t. That’s it. It’s supposedly the top two, three hundred kids in the country.” And he said, “Huh? Really?” He said, “Where else are you going?” I said, “I’m going to five-star up in Pittsburgh.” He said, “When’s that?” I said, “It’s at the end of July.” He said, “How do you get in that?” I said, “It’s just an application, and it’s some of the best talent. You probably want to ask the coaches here.” And that’s how he got in. He asked Coach (Roy) Williams, and Coach Williams called up Howard Garfinkel and got him in five-star camp. And that’s where he made his name.\n\nSo, from your experience, that’s where Dean Smith’s staff kind of got wind of who Michael was at that time?\n\nCoach Williams and I grew up in Asheville, so I talked to him a lot. So he said they got a call from some buddy’s alumni, somebody down in the Wilmington area, and said, “Hey, you need to watch this kid and he’s coming to camp. Take a look at him.” And Coach Williams was in charge of Carmichael Gym on Sunday afternoon when campers would come. You would go over and play pickup for about 15, 20 minutes so you could say you played at Carmichael, and then you’d go back. Coach Williams saw him play there, and that’s all he needed to see, right there.\n\nWhat’s it been like watching his journey from afar as he morphed into one of the greatest players of all time and attaining rock-star status as an icon?\n\nI will say this: It was difficult for me at first because I’m a competitor. My goal was to be one of the best high school basketball players in the country. I wanted to go to the pros. I wanted to be a McDonald’s All-American — all that. Here I met this guy in camp, and we started this bond, and we said we wanted to go to school with one another, play in the same backcourt. But what I didn’t realize at the time was this guy may be the best to ever lace the shoes up and play the game. And so it was tough for me. I committed to Kentucky to play. But Michael kept calling me and said, “Hey, look, we’re supposed to go to the same place. You’re not going there. We’re supposed to go to Carolina together. You are not going there.”\n\nAnd you know, I said, “Yeah, I guess I need to stay true to my word.” My high school coach, Ronnie Johnson, was a big Carolina fan and had worked their camp, and so I changed my mind. Back then there was only one signing period. It was in April, and Michael had committed in November and I committed in January. So we had to hold our commitment there for some time.\n\nBut at first, the success he was having, it was tough. Personally, it was very hard for me, and at the time it was like, “OK, this guy, he’s really good, Buzz. He’s really good. For you to beat him out, it’s going to be really difficult. He’s just very gifted. But you can still be one of the guys to play out there with him.” And so once I made my mind up and just to see him … the unique thing was how he got better each year at Carolina — from freshman to sophomore, sophomore to junior, how his game got better and better.\n\nWhat was it like to witness his game’s growth in such close proximity?\n\nBy the time we were going from our freshman into our sophomore year and were playing ball at Woollen Gym, the pros would come back, and Michael was the type of guy, he wanted to measure you. So, “(James) Worthy, you are the best, so let me play one-on-one against Worthy.” “Here comes Walter Davis.” “Here comes Al Wood.” “Here comes these guys who are pro. I want to play against them.” And that’s when you found out this guy can play with them. And he might’ve been just as good or better than them.\n\nThere is one guy that I always thought, and I know to this day — I don’t know if Michael won’t admit or not, but I swear that he had a little bit of fear of — and it wasn’t a basketball player. It was a football player by the name of Lawrence Taylor. LT, phenomenal athlete. Could guard east to west, as quick as anybody, could jump, big hands, strong and was a bit crazy. So Michael in the back of his mind said, “Shit, I better be careful with this guy.” And LT always wanted to guard him.\n\nAnd then his sophomore year he took off, played well, and then our junior year when he got player of the year. … The beginning of our junior year, we are overseas in Greece, and we play an Italian team in a tournament that had Scott May in it. Scott May was player of the year in — what? — ’76? Michael had 30-something points against him. Now, back then for us, we only scored high 60s to low 70s. And that was pretty remarkable for somebody to get 30 points in Coach Smith’s system then. We go in the locker room, eat a candy bar, change uniforms, go back out, play a Yugoslavian team. Michael gets 30-something again.\n\nAnd I remember walking out of that gym or arena, whatever it was there in Greece, and I asked Coach Williams, “Coach, let’s talk about this.” I said, “What we witnessed there, my roommate … I’ve seen Dr. J, I’ve seen Larry Bird. I’ve seen these guys on TV. But golly, Coach, he may be the best to ever play. I mean, is there anybody better than him right now?” And Coach Williams said, “Buzz, I’m telling ya, he just keeps getting better and better and better.” And he said that’s what hard work does.\n\nIf you remember after that season, in the Olympics, when Bobby Knight said his words about Michael about how good he was, I said, ‘OK, then, now we are talking that he could be (great).”\n\nYou were roommates with Michael. How was that experience?\n\nYeah, we were roommates our freshman year. My sophomore year, Coach asked me to room with Brad Daugherty because Brad and I grew up together in Asheville. Brad was only 16 years old, so we roomed with each other. And then Michael was a suitemate and David Hart, another guy from Asheville who was the student-manager. And then my junior year, Michael and I roomed together. And then Michael went pro, and then Brad and I roomed together. I’ll never forget, I remember seeing something in Sporting News one time. They said, “If you want to pick the right roommate, call Peterson because he chooses the right millionaires to be roommates with.”\n\nNow you are working for Michael as his assistant GM. Some Hornets fans are skeptical he has the same drive to win as an owner that he did as a player. What would you say to those who aren’t convinced?\n\nThey need to take my cell phone and answer my cell phone after a game one night. That’s what they need to do. Or during a game. Or sit with me during a ballgame when I’m sitting with him. They’ll know what a competitor he is. I mean, my left knee, my left shoulder. I’ve sat up there (during a game) before, and his mom would turn around and look at me and says, “Are you OK?” I said, “My shoulder is numb; I only feel it now.” I told her, “My knee is numb.”\n\nBut listen, the guy wants to win, and no matter what. And he is such a competitor. To say we are trying to work with these young guys, get them better and work and develop these guys — at the same time, Michael says, “I hear ya. But let’s win. I want to win.” And he wants to win in the worst way. It just drives him crazy when we don’t, and so when we don’t and when he thinks we should’ve, that’s when the cell phone rings and he wants a lot of questions answered right away. And sometimes that doesn’t help, either. He don’t want to listen.\n\nHow much does it burn him up that he can’t necessarily control what happens results-wise with his team on the court?\n\nThat’s sometimes where the underlining comes in our conversations. I say, “Can I say this to you, Michael? You say all this, let me say this. You see the game totally different than a lot of other people do. Your eyes, your vision, what you see, a lot of people can’t gather all that, Michael. And that’s the gift that God has given you, and then sometimes you have to understand that.” Because when you are on the floor with him, you’re one of those four other guys, you better be playing as hard as him and running with him. But not only that, you better be thinking like he is. He’s not just a guy that runs up and down the court. He thinks the game on both ends.\n\nThat’s what’s so unique about what he has. He can see a lot of things that a lot of people can’t see. That’s why I always tell him, “You would not make a very good coach. You wouldn’t. Because your expectations are just tough.” And this is what may be hard for people to understand what the documentary is about. He may be tough, the way he’s driven, the way he sees things, because he sees it through a different lens sometimes. I’ve always said this: Coach Smith, Larry Brown, some of the gifted coaches I’ve ever seen, you just let them have four or five objects out on that floor, and what they do and what they see before it even happens is just remarkable. And I always thought that Michael, I mean he’s like that. He sees things a whole lot different than a lot of people.\n\n(Top photo: Franck Fife / AFP via Getty Images)"
