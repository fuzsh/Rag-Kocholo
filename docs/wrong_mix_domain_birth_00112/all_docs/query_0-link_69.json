        "text": "Obituary - Death - Funeral - Wedding - Anniversary - Tribute - Presentation - Biography - Family Reunion - 20th century Ontario family history newspaper notices\n\nThese are the records that will put some 'life' back into your ancestors. Marriage notices often contain very cool descriptions of the event including attire, gifts, travel plans etc. Tribute and presentation notices often give a good idea of the character of your ancestors, and the esteem held for them by others in the community.\n\nFor information on ordering copies of these documents contact\n\nThis web site is a copyright work.

Weddings for example, have been indexed with the groom's name first. This index will be updated on a regular basis, so I would suggest that it would be a good idea to check back here occasionally to see what's been added.\n\nNAME ... DATE ... RECORD TYPE\n\nABBEY MRS.
