        "text": "It had the makings of a disappointing debut. Through three quarters of a November, 1995 game against the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies, Michael Jordan had just 10 points and the Bulls trailed the Grizzlies 64-62.\n\nThen the fourth quarter happened.\n\nAccording to the Sporting News, Jordan remained on the bench until midway through the fourth quarter, when Vancouver guard Darrick Martin knocked down a 3-pointer to put the Grizzlies up 75-67 and began trash-talking Jordan.\n\nVia the Sporting News:\n\nJordan came off the bench to score 19 points in a six-minute span, leading the Bulls to a comfortable 94-88 win in his first game in Canada.\n\nThe win improved Chicago’s record to 12-2 and the Bulls would go on to set an NBA record with 72 wins. Vancouver, meanwhile, finished 15-67 and moved to Memphis following the 2000–01 season.\n\nAll stats via Basketball Reference.\n\nThe best Bulls player to wear each number"
