        "text": "Introduction\n\nAs the early pioneers moved westward across the United States, the landscape of what is now the state of Illinois was their first encounter with long stretches of treeless plains. The flat grassland that the 19th-century settlers called the Prairie State has been transformed into a vital section of the North American continent.\n\nThe once lonely prairies are crossed in every direction by transportation routes that have made Illinois a continental hub for commerce and travel. Centrally located, south and west of Lake Michigan, it is close to both raw materials and markets. Downstate, beneath the southern two-thirds of Illinois, lie oil deposits and large reserves of coal.\n\nThe northern part of Illinois is dotted with industrial cities such as Rockford and Chicago. The latter was the second largest city in the United States from the late 19th century until the mid-1980s, when Los Angeles, California, passed it in population. The diverse manufactures produced in urban industrial complexes are one of the state’s leading sources of wealth. Most of the Prairie State is fertile farmland—seemingly endless miles of black loam. A diverse array of crops are grown on this land. The farms yield an agricultural income exceeded only by that of a few other states.\n\nThe name of the state comes from the Native American word Iliniwek, meaning “men.” Early fur trappers in the region altered the name with the French suffix ois to indicate “tribe,” and it was later spelled Illinois. In addition to the nickname Prairie State, Illinois was called the Sucker State—a possible allusion to the seasonal migrations of southern Illinois miners to and from northern mines, much like the movements of spawning suckerfish. Illinois is popularly called the Land of Lincoln after the 16th U.S. president. Illinois was where Abraham Lincoln became a lawyer, entered politics, married, served as a congressman, and was nominated for the presidency in 1860. His remains are at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, the state capital, and his last home in Springfield is a national historic site. Area 57,914 square miles (149,996 square kilometers). Population (2020) 12,812,508. (See also Illinois in focus.)\n\nSurvey of the Prairie State\n\nIllinois lies in the north-central part of the United States. It is bordered on the north by Wisconsin. To the west the Mississippi River separates Illinois from Iowa and Missouri. On the south the Ohio River forms the boundary with Kentucky. To the east is Indiana, with the Wabash River forming part of the boundary. The northeastern part of the state stretches along Lake Michigan for 63 miles (101 kilometers).\n\nNatural Regions\n\nThe Prairie State lies almost entirely within the vast Interior Plains of the United States. It is one of the most level states, with an average elevation of about 600 feet (180 meters). The surface of the land slopes gently downward from north to south, with the hilliest area in the northwest. The largest of the four natural regions in Illinois is the Central Lowland, a province of the Interior Plains. The Central Lowland covers more than nine-tenths of the state’s area. The other three regions are crowded together in the southern end of the state. They are the Interior Low Plateaus, another province of the Interior Plains, in the southeast; the Ozark Plateaus, a part of the Interior Highlands, in the southwest; and the Coastal Plain, a part of the extensive Atlantic Plain region, at the southern tip.\n\nCentral Lowland\n\nThe Central Lowland is a region of gradually sloping hills and broad, shallow river valleys. Within this region are smaller subdivisions. In the extreme northwest part of the region is the Wisconsin Driftless Section, the only part of Illinois that was untouched by glaciers. Here, in Jo Daviess county, is Charles Mound (1,235 feet; 376 meters), the highest point in the state. In the northeastern corner are the level lake plains of the Eastern Lake Section along Lake Michigan. The rest of the region is made up of the Till Plains. This section was leveled out by the action of glaciers in the latest ice age.\n\nThe extremely fertile Till Plains may be subdivided into four local plains—the Kankakee River valley, Bloomington Ridged, Galesburg, and Springfield. In these areas the land is level almost as far as the eye can see. At the northern end of the plains are the gently sloping Rock River Hills. The equally low Mount Vernon Hills form the southern edge of the Central Lowland.\n\nOzark Plateaus\n\nThe Ozark Plateaus extend into Illinois from Missouri. This is a forested region of hills and mountains in which many valleys have been cut by streams. Its general elevation is 1,000 to 1,600 feet (300 to 500 meters).\n\nInterior Low Plateaus\n\nThe Interior Low Plateaus are a series of small hills that cross the southern part of the state to enter Kentucky and southern Indiana. This area is sometimes called the Shawnee Hills. In Pope county is Williams Hill (1,065 feet; 325 meters), the highest point in southern Illinois.\n\nCoastal Plain\n\nThe small strip of bottomland along the southern edge of the state is known as the Coastal Plain. The western end is part of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Here, in Alexander county, is the lowest point in the state—279 feet (85 meters). The eastern section of this lowland is an extension of the East Gulf Coastal Plain.\n\nRivers\n\nIllinois is drained by as many as 900 streams emptying mostly into the Mississippi River system. The Chicago and Calumet rivers—originally flowing into the St. Lawrence byway of Lake Michigan—have been altered through the construction of canals to drain into the Mississippi by way of the Illinois River. The Illinois River roughly bisects the northern portion of the state from northeast to southwest. The Ohio River joins the Mississippi at the state’s southern tip near the town of Cairo.\n\nClimate\n\nMost of Illinois has a continental climate, with warm summers and cold winters. The extreme south has an average annual temperature about 11 degrees higher than that of the northern border. In the northeast Lake Michigan exerts some moderating influence along its shoreline. Average temperatures in winter are about 22 °F (–6 °C) in the north and 37 °F (3 °C) in the south. Summer averages are 74 °F (23 °C) in the north and 80 °F (27 °C) in the south.\n\nPrecipitation (rain and melted snow) in Illinois ranges from about 34 inches (86 centimeters) a year in the north to some 46 inches (117 centimeters) a year in the south. The growing season varies from about 155 days a year in northernmost Illinois to about 205 days a year near the Ohio-Mississippi river junction in the extreme southwest.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nBefore European settlers moved into the region beginning in the 1600s, oak-hickory forests prevailed in the north. The settlers, needing wood for fuel and construction material, stripped most of the trees, which left only 10 percent forest cover in Illinois. More than 6,200 square miles (16,000 square kilometers) of forests remain, some 1,100 square miles (2,800 square kilometers) of them in Shawnee National Forest. The state’s length gives it an unusual variety of northern and southern plant life. Both northern and southern wildflowers grow in Illinois, as do a variety of trees, such as white pines, tamaracks, walnuts, cypresses, and tupelos.\n\nBefore 1800 abundant wildlife roamed the prairies and forests, but bison, bears, wolves, mountain lions (pumas), porcupines, and elk have disappeared. Deer became extinct in Illinois in 1910, but in 1933 the Illinois Department of Conservation (now Illinois Department of Natural Resources [DNR]) placed small herds that established a growing deer population. By the early 21st century the number of white-tailed deer in the state had reached into the hundreds of thousands. Coyotes and foxes can be found in woodlands and other natural areas and, increasingly, in and around urban areas. Game birds, such as quail and pheasant, are not as plentiful as in previous times, but waterfowl are abundant during the spring and fall migrations. Pollution has nearly wiped out many species of fish, but bullheads, carp, catfish, white and yellow bass, and walleye still abound.\n\nMany of the state’s natural resources are protected and administered by the Illinois DNR. This agency oversees conservation programs, endangered species protection, mines and minerals, nature preserves, urban forestry, water resources, and hunting and fishing. Another major state preservation department is the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nThe majority of Illinois residents are whites of European descent. At the time of the 2020 U.S. census non-Hispanic whites made up nearly three-fifths of the state’s people. Hispanic Americans are the largest minority group. In 2020 more than 18 percent of the people identified themselves as Hispanic, up from 16 percent in 2010 and 12 percent in 2000. Most of the Hispanics in Illinois are of Mexican heritage. African Americans make up about 14 percent of the state’s population. They live mainly in Chicago and the surrounding area. About 6 percent of the people are Asian American, and 2 percent are either wholly or partly of Native American ancestry.\n\nCities\n\nChicago is the third largest city in the United States. Cook county, where Chicago is located, is home to about two-fifths of the people of Illinois. The Chicago metropolitan area, which stretches from Indiana to Wisconsin, also includes the Illinois counties of DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will. Chicago is a center of industry, commerce, finance, transportation, and culture. It is the railroad, airline, and trucking hub of North America. Linked by waterways to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, it is also a major inland port serving foreign and domestic ships. Several other cities in the Chicago metropolitan area—Aurora, Joliet, Naperville, Elgin, and Waukegan—rank among the state’s largest communities.\n\nOther large cities of Illinois include Rockford, the chief trade center of the northwestern part of the state. Peoria, on the Illinois River in the north-central part of the state, is located in a rich farm region with excellent rail and water transportation. Springfield, the capital of Illinois, is in the south-central part of the state. Located in a rich farm area, it is an important railroad center.\n\nEducation\n\nPublic education in Illinois had its beginning when the Land Ordinance of 1785 reserved sections of public land for schools. In 1825 a law providing for the formation of school districts and establishing a compulsory tax to support schools was enacted, but the compulsory taxation clause was later revoked and the school system remained weak. Parents who could afford the cost sent their children to private schools. Finally, in 1854, the governor appointed a special officer of public instruction, and the school law of 1855 (the basis for today’s public school system) provided for the compulsory taxation of local property, a state school tax, and the certification of teachers.\n\nThe state’s largest institution of higher learning is the University of Illinois, with its main campus in Urbana-Champaign and other campuses in Chicago and Springfield. Other public institutions include Southern Illinois University, in Carbondale, with a campus in Edwardsville and centers in Alton and Springfield; Northern Illinois University, in DeKalb; Illinois State University, in Normal; Western Illinois University, in Macomb; Eastern Illinois University, in Charleston; and Northeastern Illinois University, in Chicago.\n\nAmong Illinois’s private institutions of higher learning are two of the most prestigious schools in the United States: Northwestern University, in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, and the University of Chicago, in the city’s Hyde Park neighborhood. Chicago is also the site of Loyola University, DePaul University, the Illinois Institute of Technology, Roosevelt University, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and North Park University.\n\nSports and Recreation\n\nThe Prairie State has few spectacular scenic attractions. It does, however, have many lovely bluffs and wooded ravines along its rivers and lakes. Many of these places have been preserved as state parks. One of the most famous is Starved Rock. According to legend, a band of the Illinois people fled to the flat top of this rock to escape some Ottawa who wanted to avenge their chief’s murder. Surrounded by their enemies, they died of thirst and starvation.\n\nAmong Illinois’s finest recreational offerings are the sandy beaches of Lake Michigan, from Chicago to the Wisconsin border. Many camping sites are located throughout the state. The Spoon River Valley Scenic Drive in central Illinois leads through the country made famous by the poet Edgar Lee Masters. Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, near East St. Louis in southwestern Illinois, preserves a major archaeological site. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982.\n\nThe state’s professional sports teams, based in Chicago, have legions of devoted fans. They include the Cubs and White Sox in baseball; the Bulls and Sky in men’s and women’s basketball, respectively; the Bears in football; the Blackhawks in ice hockey; and the Fire in soccer. Across the state many sports fans also follow the university-level teams with almost equal interest.\n\nArts and Cultural Sites\n\nChicago, a major global artistic center, dominates culture in Illinois. Its opera and symphony orchestra are among the premier American musical organizations, and the Joffrey Ballet is a world-class dance institution. Chicago is known as a center for the blues and played a critical role in the development of jazz. The local theater scene in Chicago is respected for the works and the talent that emerge from it season after season. Theater companies, such as Lookingglass and Steppenwolf, produce original, award-winning plays, and their writers and actors have gained worldwide fame. Chicago is also known as a center for improv comedy performance, and the Second City improv comedy troupe has been a training ground for some of the most famous and successful comedians.\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Museum of Science and Industry, and Field Museum of Natural History are all world-class museums. The museum buildings themselves are viewed as superior works of architecture, an art form for which Chicago is well regarded. The work of architects such as Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe brings thousands of tourists to Chicago every year. West of the Chicago city limits, in the suburb of Oak Park, are a number of structures designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and south of Oak Park is the village of Riverside, designed by noted landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted.\n\nChicago has been home to generations of writers. From the 1890s into the 21st century Theodore Dreiser, Carl Sandburg, Saul Bellow, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sandra Cisneros, and Studs Terkel, among many others, chronicled the lives of Chicagoans through novels, short stories, poetry, and nonfiction.\n\nColleges and universities located around the state offer cultural opportunities through their theater, music, and art programs. Several communities have symphony orchestras. The Elgin Symphony Orchestra is regarded as one of the finest community ensembles in the region, and Belleville has the second oldest symphony orchestra in the country. The homes of presidents can be seen in Galena (Ulysses S. Grant) and in Springfield (Abraham Lincoln). New Salem, near Springfield, is a preservation of the community of log cabins in which Lincoln spent much of his young manhood.\n\nFor brief biographies of some notable people of Illinois, click here.\n\nEconomy\n\nIllinois has a diversified economy, with strengths in manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, technology, and services, including finance and tourism. This diversity generally provides greater stability at times when other states with more narrowly based industries suffer.\n\nAgriculture\n\nIllinois has ranked among the chief agricultural states since about 1850. Farms cover about three-fourths of the state’s area. Its abundant crop yields are due largely to the rich black soil and level fields of the Corn Belt, an ideal terrain for agricultural machinery.\n\nIllinois is a national leader in the production of corn and soybeans, its most valuable crops. Wheat is grown extensively in the west and southwest, oats in the north. Hayfields are found throughout the state. Apples, peaches, and other fruits and vegetables are also grown.\n\nIllinois ranks high among the states in the production of hogs. Cattle and calves are raised for both meat and dairy products.\n\nIndustry\n\nBeginning in the second half of the 20th century, Illinois, like many other U.S. states, experienced an ongoing decline in manufacturing. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost as companies moved overseas and to states where business costs were lower. However, manufacturing still remains a significant sector of the state’s economy.\n\nOne of the chief industries in the state had its beginning in 1847 when John Deere founded a shop in Moline to sell plows and Cyrus McCormick set up a reaper (harvester) plant in Chicago. Plows, harvesters, and other farm implements made in Illinois are used all over the world. The state is a leader in the manufacture of agricultural and construction machinery. Other important industries in Illinois include food and beverage processing and the manufacture of chemicals, fabricated metal products, petroleum and coal products, computer and electronic products, and plastics and rubber products.\n\nIllinois ranks among the top states in the country in coal reserves, particularly bituminous (soft) coal. It is estimated that coal deposits lie underneath more than two-thirds of the state, but most of the production is in the central and southern sections. Illinois has only small reserves of petroleum, but it is a regional leader in petroleum refining. The state is also one of the country’s top producers of ethanol. Valuable nonfuel minerals produced in Illinois include crushed stone, cement, and sand and gravel.\n\nNuclear power generates more than half the state’s electrical power. Illinois has 11 nuclear power reactors, more than any other state. Argonne National Laboratory, near Lemont, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), in Batavia, are major research and development installations of the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nServices\n\nThe economy of Illinois, like that of most other U.S. states, is dominated by the broad-based service sector. Chicago is a center of finance and insurance. It is the seat of the seventh district of the Federal Reserve System and is home to the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade, which is the country’s oldest commodity market. Other major service activities include tourism, real estate, government, professional and business services, and health care.\n\nTransportation\n\nBecause of its central location, Illinois has long been a key link in the inland waterways of North America. It lies between the continent’s two largest systems—the Great Lakes on the northeast and the Mississippi River on the west. Between these is the Illinois River, navigable for more than 270 miles (430 kilometers) from its junction with the Mississippi at Grafton. To connect this river with Lake Michigan, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was opened in 1848.\n\nIn 1900 this canal was replaced by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, which reversed the flow of the Chicago River and connected the south branch of that river with the Des Plaines River (a tributary of the Illinois). The federal government acquired the canal in 1930, and after improvements were made, in 1933 the entire water highway from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi became known as the Illinois Waterway. Its importance increased when Chicago became a port for oceangoing ships through the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959.\n\nThe first railroad in the state was the state-owned Northern Cross, which made its first run in late 1838. Chicago got its start as a railroad center in 1848 when a steam railroad began operating on a short line west of the city. Four years later the first passenger train from the East arrived in Chicago. Meanwhile, in 1850, Congress granted the state more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of land to aid in railroad construction. The Illinois Central Railroad was organized in 1851, and by 1856 it had completed a line from Chicago to Cairo. Today the total railroad mileage in Illinois is among the country’s most extensive.\n\nThe most important path in the Illinois region was Portage Trail, between the headwaters of the Illinois and Chicago rivers. It had been used by the Native Americans long before the coming of Europeans. Another route across the northern part of the region was the Great Sauk Trail. It began near the site of Rock Island and ran eastward around the southern end of Lake Michigan then swerved up to Canada. Its counterpart in the south was the St. Louis Trace, or Vincennes Trail, which led from the Ohio River opposite present-day Louisville, Kentucky, to the Mississippi River at Cahokia. Hubbard’s Trace, the link between downstate and Chicago, was blazed by fur trader Gurdon Hubbard from Danville to Fort Dearborn in 1822–24. Vandalia was the western terminus of the National Pike, or Cumberland Road, for many years.\n\nIllinois is now served by a network of state and federal highways. The heaviest concentration of roads is in the Chicago area. In 1953 the State Toll Highway Authority was established. It maintains and operates the more than 280-mile (450-kilometer) Illinois Tollway System, which serves Chicago and northern Illinois.\n\nChicago is also a major aviation center. Its two major airports are O’Hare International, one of the world’s busiest, and Midway International. Regional airports are located at Champaign-Urbana, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield, and other cities.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe first capital of Illinois was Kaskaskia, which served from 1818 to 1820, when it was replaced by Vandalia. In 1837 Springfield was selected as the new capital, but the actual transfer was not made until 1839.\n\nIllinois is governed under its fourth constitution, which was adopted in 1970. The chief executive is the governor, who is elected every four years and may serve multiple terms, either consecutive or not. The legislature consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Before 1983 each of 59 Illinois districts elected one state senator and three representatives. This created a legislature that some thought to be large and cumbersome. As a result, in 1980, the voters approved a measure that reduced the number of representatives to one from each of 118 districts. The number of senators remained at 59, each of their districts now comprising two representative districts. The Supreme Court, composed of seven justices, heads the judiciary.\n\nNotable politicians in Illinois have included Richard J. Daley, who served as mayor of Chicago for six terms (1955–76). His son Richard M. Daley became Chicago’s longest-serving mayor. He was in office from 1989 to 2011. The city elected its first African American mayor, Harold Washington, in 1983. In 2019 Lori Lightfoot became the first African American woman to serve as the city’s mayor. She was also the first openly gay person to hold that office. In the governor’s office no one served longer than Jim Thompson, a Republican (1977–91). Democrat Rod Blagojevich (2003–09) was the first governor in Illinois to be impeached and removed from office.\n\nAbraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant were the only U.S. presidents elected from Illinois until 2008, when Senator Barack Obama was elected to the office. The only Illinois-born president was Ronald Reagan of Tampico. Adlai E. Stevenson, a former Illinois governor, was the losing Democratic presidential candidate in the 1952 and 1956 elections.\n\nHistory\n\nPaleo-Indians lived in what is now southern Illinois as early as 8000 bc. People of the Mississippian culture built Cahokia in southwestern Illinois near East St. Louis. It was the largest Native American city north of Mexico before the arrival of Europeans. The site consisted of about 120 earth mounds spread over 6 square miles (16 square kilometers). The largest of the Cahokia mounds is Monks Mound, which is about 1,000 feet (300 meters) long and 100 feet (30 meters) high. It was used as a foundation for ceremonial buildings. Scattered across the state are many smaller effigy mounds and burial mounds.\n\nWhen Europeans entered the region during the late 1600s, they found many Native Americans living in the area. The most important group was the Illinois, a loose confederation of several Algonquian-speaking tribes including the Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Michigamea, Peoria, and Tamaroa. (See also Northeast Indians.)\n\nEuropean Exploration and Settlement\n\nThe first Europeans to cross the Illinois prairies were Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet. From the Mississippi River they traveled up the Illinois, Des Plaines, and Chicago rivers to the site of Chicago on Lake Michigan in 1673. Beginning in 1680, another French explorer, René-Robert Cavelier, sieur de La Salle, built forts on Starved Rock and Lake Peoria, claiming the region for France.\n\nA French mission was founded at Cahokia in 1699. This became the earliest permanent European settlement in Illinois and the first center of French life in the upper Mississippi Valley. Kaskaskia was founded four years later. Illinois first became a political unit when it was made a district of the French province of Louisiana in 1717. By 1750 the region contained some 2,000 French people and a few enslaved Africans.\n\nAfter the French and Indian War ended in 1763, France surrendered its claim to the territory east of the Mississippi. However, the French settlers remained in their settlements, and the British made no serious attempt to organize the region. In 1778, during the American Revolution, the capture by American forces of Kaskaskia made Illinois a county of Virginia. In 1787 the entire region was made a part of the Northwest Territory. From 1800 to 1809 Illinois was included in the Indiana Territory. It became a separate territory in 1809.\n\nFrom the end of the American Revolution until Illinois was admitted to the Union in 1818, settlement was confined largely to the southern third of the area. Most of the newcomers were Americans from the Southern and Southeastern states. In the 1770s the settlement that later became Chicago was founded by Jean-Baptist-Point Du Sable, a West Indian trapper of French and African ancestry. The only community in the north developed around Fort Dearborn, which was established in 1803 near the site of his Lake Michigan trading post.\n\nStatehood\n\nOn December 3, 1818, Illinois was admitted to the Union as the 21st state. Nathaniel Pope, territorial delegate to Congress, succeeded in having the northern boundary set at 42° 30′ instead of at 41° 39′. By this change a 60-mile (97-kilometer) strip, including the site of Chicago, became part of Illinois instead of Wisconsin.\n\nAt this time the population of the new state was about 40,000, with most people concentrated along the Mississippi, Wabash, and Ohio rivers and primarily engaged in the fur trade. During the next few years, however, many settlements were made in the central third of the state. Galena, in the northwest, drew hundreds of people to work in the lead mines after a large-scale smelter was established in 1823.\n\nThe northern part of the state was mostly wilderness until the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825. After that, many New Englanders came to northern Illinois by way of the Great Lakes. This settlement provoked the Black Hawk War in 1832, the last Native American uprising in the state. Sauk and Meskwaki (or Fox) Indians led by Black Hawk won the Battle of Stillman’s Run but were eventually forced to retreat across the Mississippi permanently.\n\nMormons founded the town of Nauvoo on the Mississippi River in 1839. Friction developed between them and their Gentile (non-Mormon) neighbors. Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Mormon leaders, were killed by a mob at Carthage in 1844. Two years later the Mormons began their long journey west to Utah. (See also Joseph Smith.)\n\nIn 1858 the whole country became interested in the debates on slavery staged in seven Illinois cities by Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, who were bitter opponents for the U.S. Senate. Although Lincoln lost the race, he was elected the 16th president in 1860 and directed the country through the American Civil War. The military commander of the Union forces was General Ulysses S. Grant, who owned a home in Galena. (He later became the 18th president of the United States.) John A. Logan was another Civil War general from Illinois. In 1865 Illinois was the first state to ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery.\n\nIllinois attracted large numbers of European immigrants in the years before the Civil War. Most of these were Germans, Irish, and Scandinavians, who settled in the northern half of the state. Other waves of immigrants arrived in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These people, chiefly from central and southern Europe, settled in the larger cities to work in factories and mills.\n\nThe Modern State\n\nAfter the Civil War agricultural production grew rapidly, but industrial expansion made even greater strides. The rise of industrialization brought on a number of strikes and riots. Two of the most serious incidents were the Haymarket Riot of 1886 and the Pullman Strike in 1894. The Haymarket Riot was a violent confrontation between police and labor protesters in Haymarket Square in Chicago. The riot became a symbol of the international struggle for workers’ rights. The Pullman Strike occurred after the owner of the Pullman Palace Car Company, a manufacturer of railroad cars, decided to cut his employees’ wages but not the rent they paid in the company town near Chicago. The widespread strike and boycott that ensued severely disrupted rail traffic in the Midwest for several months and ended only after federal troops had been sent to Chicago. The champion of the working class during these troubled times was John P. Altgeld. His term as governor (1893–97) was the only Democratic administration in Illinois between 1857 and 1913.\n\nChicago suffered a disastrous fire in 1871, but it was quickly rebuilt and for a time was the second largest city in the Western Hemisphere. Its world’s fairs of 1893 and 1933–34 drew much attention. But in the 1920s and ’30s the city was also notorious for bootleg liquor and organized crime. In the 1960s Martin Luther King, Jr., focused his open-housing campaign in Chicago because of persistent discrimination against its large Black population.\n\nIllinois has had many leaders in social reform. Among them were Frances Willard, temperance worker; Jane Addams, social worker; Dwight Moody, evangelist; Jesse Jackson, activist; and Ida B. Wells-Barnett, anti-lynching crusader who also worked for Black woman suffrage.\n\nIn the political realm, however, corruption and fraud, committed by both Democratic and Republican officials, have been frequent problems, earning the state a checkered national reputation. Many state and local officials have served prison time, and three governors in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have been convicted of federal felonies; one, Rod Blagojevich, was impeached. Despite these setbacks, Illinois continued to wield significant influence in the nationwide political scene. Barack Obama, a U.S. senator from Illinois, was elected president of the United States in 2008. He was the first African American to hold the office. Obama won reelection in 2012.\n\nIn 2020 Illinois faced a crisis as a new coronavirus spread around the globe. Illinois was one of the U.S. states hardest hit during the coronavirus pandemic. By mid-2022 it had recorded more than 3,300,000 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, and more than 38,000 deaths.

Addams was educated in Rockford, Illinois. During her travels in London, England, with Ellen Gates Starr, they visited Toynbee Hall, where university graduates lived and helped residents of a poor neighborhood. Inspired, Addams and Starr returned to Chicago and created Hull House in 1889. Hull House offered a day-care center, a kindergarten, an employment agency, and college-level classes. Addams worked for many other social causes and won part of the 1931 Nobel Prize for Peace. (See also Jane Addams.)\n\nBlack Hawk (1767–1838)\n\nA chief of the Sauk people, Black Hawk led a band of Native Americans who refused to be forced from their homeland by white settlers. He was born near the mouth of the Rock River in what is now Illinois. In 1804 several members of the Sauk and Meskwaki tribes signed a treaty ceding all their lands east of the Mississippi River to the United States. Some of the Indians resettled across the river in what is now Iowa, but Black Hawk rejected the treaty. He was driven across the river in 1831 but led a faction of Sauk and Meskwaki back across the Mississippi the following year. This act led to the Black Hawk War of 1832. He survived the war, which ended with a massacre of Indians at the Bad Axe River in what is now Wisconsin. Black Hawk was imprisoned for a time but later was allowed to return to Iowa. (See also Black Hawk.)\n\nCarol Moseley Braun (born 1947)\n\nPolitician Carol Moseley Braun was the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Braun was raised and educated in Chicago. She worked as an assistant U.S. attorney before she was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1978. Braun was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992, but her record was tarnished by accusations of corruption. She was not reelected but served as U.S. ambassador to New Zealand from 1999 to 2001. (See also Carol Moseley Braun.)\n\nMichael Jordan (born 1963)\n\nMichael Jordan was one of the best basketball players of all time. Jordan grew up in North Carolina and was twice named college basketball player of the year at the University of North Carolina. He played for the Chicago Bulls beginning in the 1984–85 season. Jordan led the Bulls to six NBA championships (1991–93, 1996–98). He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of each championship series. Jordan retired in 2003 with 32,292 points and 10 scoring titles. (See also Michael Jordan.)\n\nPercy Julian (1899–1975)\n\nPercy Julian was a chemist best known for creating products using soybeans. Julian earned a Ph.D. in 1931, during a time when it was very hard for African Americans to receive a good education. In 1936 he accepted a job at a company in Chicago, and he spent the rest of his career in the Chicago area. Julian’s greatest discovery was how to synthesize cortisone, a steroid used to treat arthritis, using soybeans. Julian was active in the civil rights movement and became the second African American member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAbraham Lincoln (1809–65)\n\nAbraham Lincoln served as the 16th president of the United States and is widely considered the greatest U.S. president. Although Lincoln had less than a year of formal schooling, he was a voracious reader and educated himself. He studied law and became a lawyer in 1836. Lincoln practiced law in Springfield and entered politics in the 1830s. In 1860 he ran for president and won. Lincoln’s antislavery stance caused many Southern states to secede from the Union, and the American Civil War began. Lincoln steered the country through the war, leading the way to the abolition of slavery. (See also Abraham Lincoln.)\n\nMichelle Obama (born 1964)\n\nMichelle Obama was the first African American first lady of the United States. She was born and raised in Chicago. She was working as an attorney at a Chicago law firm when she met Barack Obama in 1989. They married in 1992. Michelle worked for the city of Chicago and the University of Chicago before she left her legal career to help Barack with his 2008 presidential campaign, which he won. As first lady she promoted healthy eating and started the “Let’s Move!” campaign to help end childhood obesity. (See also Michelle Obama.)\n\nMaria Tallchief (1925–2013)\n\nMaria Tallchief was considered one of the greatest ballerinas of the United States. Tallchief was born on an Osage Indian reservation in Oklahoma. She began dancing at a young age, and in 1942 she joined a touring company based in New York City. Tallchief danced for professional companies, mostly the New York City Ballet, until her retirement in 1965 and went on to become a noted ballet teacher in Chicago. She founded the ballet school of the Lyric Opera and was artistic director of the Chicago City Ballet (1981–87). (See also Maria Tallchief.)\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959)\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright was one of the most influential architects of the 20th century. In 1893 Wright opened his architecture firm in Chicago. Many of his early works used the “Prairie style” of architecture. Architects employing this style create structures that are low-lying and blend into their surroundings. Wright became famous as the creator of “organic architecture,” his phrase that indicates that the building should harmonize with its inhabitants and its surroundings. Wright was a great originator and highly productive. He designed some 800 buildings, and 8 of them have been declared UNESCO World Heritage sites. (See also Frank Lloyd Wright.)"
