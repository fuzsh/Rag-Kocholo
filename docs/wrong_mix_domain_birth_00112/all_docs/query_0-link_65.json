Mary leaves behind her children Karen and Gary Guancione and many loved friends and relatives.\n\nMary loved being alive and everything she did was filled with love, generosity, enthusiasm and boundless energy. Until her last moment when she could no longer speak with words, she communicated fully with everyone around her. She had many longtime friends of all ages from every walk of life. Mary was an adventurer, game for anything, ready to run on a moment’s notice.\n\nShe was in constant motion but all her actions were mindful, determined and graceful. Mary cooked constantly in large quantities, for everyone she knew. Her eggplant parmigiana, manicotti Siciliano, braccioli, meatballs, macaroni and gravy, stuffed mushrooms, clams oreganata, pasta fagioli, antipasto, cheesecake and countless Italian delicacies were devoured with delight. Mary was an ultimate perfectionist but she worked quietly and humbly with well-honed efficiency often until the wee hours of the morning and all her creations seemed to appear effortlessly as if by magic.\n\nWhenever Mary sewed fashionable clothing from carefully selected fabric, decorated every room of the house from top to bottom with exuberant, intricate installations that changed for every holiday, she showed great care and the eye of an artist. When her daughter Karen made large-scale art installations for galleries or museums that required thousands of hours of intricate handwork Mary jumped right in to help with incredible expertise. Mary’s artistry was learned from her own mother Anna Platia and was passed on from mother to daughter through generations.\n\nMary loved to dance. As a little girl she tap-danced all the time with pennies attached to her shoes and one night when she accompanied her mother to a nightclub in Newark, NJ she was invited up to the microphone to sing for everyone. As a teenager and young woman she “decked out” in beautiful clothes sewn by her mother and jitterbugged almost every night to big band music in Newark and venues throughout New Jersey and New York. She fondly remembered dressing to the nines and dancing all night with friends at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Many years later son Gary became a musician and Mary loved to hear him play the guitar and sing.\n\nMary was born in Easton, Pennsylvania where her large extended family still lives. When she was seven she moved with her daring mother Anna to Newark, NJ, where Anna worked in sewing factories and Mary went to school. She graduated from Newark’s Central High. In 1950 they moved to Belleville to the house where she has lived ever since. For several years Mary worked in the Tung-Sol Factory. One day after work she and her close group of women friends were in a local bar when she suddenly met her future husband Angelo Guancione, who was hilariously funny and made her laugh constantly. They were inseparable, venturing in every direction in Angelo’s car. They married in 1956 and started a family at once. Mary loved her house, which she decorated and kept immaculately clean. She loved to devote herself to her family and was the first to volunteer as Scout leader, PTA member, home-room mother, or band parent. She never missed an exhibition opening, dance, music or theatrical performance, party or event that her children and friends were part of and contributed whole-heartedly to every occasion. Mary was a doer and a creator, never afraid to dig right in and get her hands dirty. Her laugh, humor and vibrancy made her loved by many.\n\nMary always loved to travel- first with her girlfriends and later with her family on long cross-country road trips. She continued to travel well into her 80's. Italy, France, Greece, and Key West were some of favorite destinations. Shopping, searching for amazing bargains, playing bingo, making ceramics and gardening, going to dance, theater and music performances were also some of her favorite things.\n\nA testament to Mary’s beautiful spirit are friends everywhere; in the United States, Italy, France, Mexico, Iraq and elsewhere who are now remembering her beautiful spirit and celebrating a marvelous, exceptional life.\n\nOlympia Cozzarelli\n\nOlympia Cozzarelli (nee Gentile), 92, passed away suddenly on Monday February 16, 2015 at her residence, in Point Pleasant, N.J.\n\nGuests will be received at the Irvine-Cozzarelli Memorial Home, 276 Washington Avenue, Belleville, NJ on Friday February 20th, afternoon and evening from 2 to 4 & 7 to 9 o’clock.
