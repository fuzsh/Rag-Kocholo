        "text": "WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - Legendary basketball player Michael Jordan and his mother Deloris Jordan made a surprise visit to the Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic grand opening on Tuesday, May 7.\n\nWECT streamed Michael and Deloris Jordan’s comments at the opening live, and you can watch that full recording at the bottom of this story.\n\nThe clinic is at the corner of 15th and Greenfield streets, near the Houston Moore neighborhood.\n\nMichael Jordan grew up in Wilmington and donated $10 million to make the clinic a reality. He also plans to open another clinic in Wilmington, and he has helped fund similar clinics in Charlotte.\n\nJordan says providing health care to those who need it the most is why they created the clinics to begin with.\n\n“That’s what this clinic is about. When the families are not able to support, we’re there to support. If you don’t have any money, that doesn’t matter. We’re going to do whatever we can to support you because that’s what happened to me, that’s where I got it from,” said Jordan.\n\nErnie Bovio, who heads Novant Health New Hanover Regional, says this venture with the Jordan family is new for his organization.\n\n“We’re bringing a new clinic to serve what’s been typically an underserved community to provide primary care, preventive care, screenings, those types of things, and we’re really excited about it, it’s going to be a tremendous community resource,” said Bovio.\n\nBovio says the NBA legend being on hand to open this first location shows his commitment to this community.\n\n“It was pretty cool for Michael Jordan to come here and help us dedicate and celebrate. It was really his generosity and vision that made this a reality,” said Bovio.\n\nJordan has already helped open clinics similar to this one in other parts of the state but wanted his legacy to live on in Wilmington as well.\n\n“We did it in Charlotte and now we can do it here in Wilmington, which makes it even more special because this is a this is who I came from. And no matter how you see Michael Jordan, this is where I started, this is where I’m always gonna be a part of,” said Jordan."
