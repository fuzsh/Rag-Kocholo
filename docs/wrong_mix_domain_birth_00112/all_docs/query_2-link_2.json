        "text": "*Michael Jordan was born on this date in 1963. He is a Black businessman and was one of the best professional basketball players in the world.\n\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan is from Brooklyn, New York, and is the son of Delores and James Jordan. His family decided to move to Wilmington, North Carolina when he was still a toddler. Jordan is the fourth of five children. His dad worked at an electric plant while his mom worked at a bank. Jordan's parents worked hard to provide him and his siblings with a comfortable lifestyle. As a child, Jordan played baseball, basketball, and football. His preferred sport at the time was baseball, but after he began spending a lot of time on the basketball court, his outlook changed. His older and taller brother, Larry, kept beating him when they played one-on-one.\n\nIn 1978, when Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, he was cut from the varsity team. Instead of giving up, he worked through this hardship and became one of the greatest basketball players in the world. Between the 10th and 11th grades, Jordan grew from 5'11\" to 6'3\", and because his game improved, he made the varsity team the following year. Jordan played so well in his junior season that he was invited to attend the Five-Star Camp in Pittsburgh before his senior year. By the time Jordan finished his senior year, he had grown to 6'5\" and attained a basketball scholarship from the University of North Carolina. Jordan's ever-growing popularity began at UNC, where he made a last-minute game-winning shot in the 1984 NCAA championship game.\n\nThat summer, Jordan played on the US Men's Olympic Basketball Team under head coach Bobby Knight. The team had such college players as Jordan, Patrick Ewing, and Chris Mullin (NBA players weren't allowed to compete in the Games until 1992). Jordan scored 14 points against China, 20 against Canada, and 16 against Uruguay. The US won all eight games by an average of 32.1 points per game. Jordan led the team in scoring with an average of 17.1 points per game.\n\nJordan began his first NBA professional season with the Chicago Bulls. His acrobatic moves and hang time won him the infamous nickname Air Jordan. His basketball skills and allure made him the perfect key figure to market both Nike products and the NBA, and he led the Bulls to three consecutive World Championships (1991, 1992, and 1993). Jordan retired from the NBA preceding the 1993/94 season after the mysterious death of his father and after rumors about his gambling addictions began to circulate.\n\nHe decided to try his hand at professional baseball. He played outfielder for the Birmingham Barons and realized that he was not cut out for baseball after a disappointing season. In 1995, Jordan returned to basketball right before the playoffs, but the Bulls didn't win the Championship. Jordan led the Bulls to their best regular-season record and the fourth Championship title in six years the following season. He also starred alongside Bugs Bunny in the animated comedy Space Jam. He also decided to retire after winning his last Championship in 1999, mainly due to dedicating his life to his wife Juanita and their three children, Jeffrey, Marcus, and Jasmine.\n\nAfter partly returning to the game as president of basketball operations with the Washington Wizards (he owned a stake in the team), Jordan announced his return to the NBA, this time as a Wizard. In that 2002 season, he suffered a knee injury that kept him on the sidelines for the rest of the year, and his wife announced her desire to file for divorce (the couple is still married).\n\nJordan has two older brothers (Larry and James), one older sister (Delores), and one younger sister (Roslyn). James R. Jordan is a Sergeant Major in the 35th Signal Brigade of the XVIII Airborne Corps in the U.S. Army. James R. gained a certain celebrity when he announced, at the age of 47, that he intended to stay in Iraq until the Iraqi invasion ended. Michael Jordan currently lives in Highland Park, Illinois; he listed the mansion for sale in 2012.\n\nIn 2006, Jordan bought a share of the Charlotte Bobcats and joined the team's executive ranks as its managing member of basketball operations. In 2010, he became the majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats and serves as the team's chairman. Improving the team's less-than-stellar record seems to be Jordan's priority. He told ESPN in November 2012 \"I don't anticipate getting out of this business. My competitive nature is I want to succeed. It's always been said that when I can't find a way to do anything, I will find a way to do it.\"\n\nJordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011, and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters, Victoria and Ysabel. In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.\n\nIn 2016, Jordan was presented with a Presidential Medal of Freedom honor by Barack Obama. In 2023, on his 60th birthday, he made a $10 million donation to Make-A-Wish America. It's the largest individual contribution the organization has received in its 43-year history. The donation is Jordan's latest sign of support â€” the first wish he granted was in 1989, and he's fulfilled hundreds more wishes to children with critical illnesses."
