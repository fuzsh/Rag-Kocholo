        "text": "A limited liability company controlled by former NBA superstar Michael Jordan paid a recorded $16.5 million for a home in Jupiter's exclusive Bear's Club community last month, not far from the sprawling 3-acre estate he built a decade ago.\n\nPalm Beach County official records show the sale of the home at 103 W. Bears Club Drive was completed March 27 between former homeowners Michael A. Murphy and Marla Murphy and the Illinois-based Bull & Bear, LLC.\n\nThe 9,100-square-foot home with five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a four-car garage, pool and guest house, was listed in November at $18.5 million, according to the multiple listing service, or MLS. While the deed recorded last month shows a sale price of $16.5 million, the sale price on the MLS is $17 million, possibly reflecting the inclusion of other items such as furniture.\n\nForbes 400: Michael Jordan becomes first billionaire athlete to make the richest-of-the rich list\n\nBull & Bear, LLC, is also the owner of the 26,300-square-foot home the retired Chicago Bulls icon built in 2013 at 172 Bears Club Drive, which is less than a mile from the newly purchased house across the golf course at the Bear's Club, a private golf-course community on Donald Ross Road east of Alternate A1A.\n\nWhat is the Bear's Club in Jupiter?\n\nThe Bear's Club was founded by Jack and Barbara Nicklaus in 1999. According to Realtor.com, there are just 61 estate homes in the Bear's Club. Jordan's custom-built home on 3.05 acres is likely the largest, according to the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser's website.\n\nJordan married former model Yvette Prieto in 2013 at The Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea, holding a reception after at the newly-built home in the Bear's Club. He is a partner at 1000 North, an upscale restaurant in Jupiter, and the Cincoro Tequila brand.\n\nCincoro means \"five gold\" in Spanish: Michael Jordan celebrates his new unique tequila at Jupiter's 1000 North restaurant\n\nMichael Murphy, who sold the home at 103 W. Bears Club Drive to Jordan, is the founder of founded AirWayz, an online service that provides exclusive sports content, such as athlete interviews and photos, to subscribers.\n\nThe sellers were represented by Compass real estate agent Jeremy Brown. Jordan was represented by Keller Williams Capital Realty, according to Realtor.com.\n\nKimberly Miller is a veteran journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.
