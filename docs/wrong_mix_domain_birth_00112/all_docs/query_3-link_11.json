One day, God was sitting around and decided to make the perfect basketball player. He gave him a little hardship early to make him appreciate what he would earn in the end and called him Michael Jordan.\"\n\n-- James Jordan\n\nFall 1978\n\nAs a sophomore at Emsley A. Laney High School, Jordan is deemed too short and cut from the varsity basketball team. Coach Clifton \"Pop\" Herring selects 6-foot-8 sophomore Leroy Smith instead.

They thought I couldn't shoot.\"\n\n-- Michael Jordan\n\nMarch 29, 1982\n\nHits a game-winning basket for the Tar Heels in the NCAA championship game against Georgetown. Score: 63-62.\n\nJan. 29, 1983\n\nScores a career-high 39 points against Georgia Tech.\n\nMarch 27, 1983\n\nDespite 26 points from Jordan, the No. 2 Tar Heels are upset by Georgia in the Elite Eight.\n\nAwards:\n\nSporting News College Player of the Year.\n\nAP first-team All-American.\n\nSporting News first-team All-American.\n\nMarch 3, 1984\n\nIn a double-overtime game against Duke, Jordan scores 25 points.
