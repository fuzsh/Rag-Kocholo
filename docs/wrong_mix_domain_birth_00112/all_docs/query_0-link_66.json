        "text": "Want to buy former NBA star Darius Miles’ waffle iron? Here’s your chance. An auction will be held on Wednesday to satisfy creditors in Miles’ bankruptcy. And it isn’t just waffle irons. Miles has NBA jerseys signed by LeBron James, Larry Bird and Latrell Sprewell, and an NFL jersey signed by Michael Vick. He also has tennis shoes signed by Lamar Odom and a commemorative bat signed by Mark McGwire. They will all be on the auction block at Belle-Clair Fairgrounds at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nThere will also be furniture, karaoke machines, more than 1,000 DVDs, video consoles and games. A former East St. Louis Flyers basketball standout, Miles was a first-round draft pick with the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2000 NBA draft and signed a contract worth $9 million. He starred in a movie with Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds. He landed an endorsement with Michael Jordan’s athletic brand.\n\nMiles listed a $20,000 child-support debt in his bankruptcy and a $100,000 loss in a 2008 California real-estate deal. He also lost money in another real-estate deal with fellow investors former St. Louis Rams player Marshall Faulk and rapper Nelly after a Laclede’s Landing property became mired in lawsuits. In addition to his Belleville home, Miles listed 12 other properties he owns, all in East St. Louis. He has a Deutsche Bank account with $49,000 and his son’s college fund with $84,900. He also listed ownership of various collectibles with unknown value, including trophies, signed jerseys and jewelry.\n\nSad news for ex-NBA star Darius Miles … who’s in danger of losing a bunch of his prized possessions in his bankruptcy case — including his signed LeBron James jersey. TMZ Sports has obtained court docs filed in Illinois where 35-year-old Miles — who made more than $60 MILLION in the NBA — filed for Chapter 7.\n\nHis star was rising and his financial future looked secure. In June, he filed bankruptcy. Miles is 34 now. It’s been 16 years since the 6-foot-9 forward was drafted by the L.A. Clippers right out of East St. Louis High School. But injuries, legal problems and bad investments have left Miles asking the court to allow him to sell off his assets to pay creditors. Miles listed $460,385 in assets and $1.57 million in liabilities.\n\nRemember the time Patterson fined Darius Miles $150,000 and publicly scolded the small forward for berating his coach in a film session? I do. So does then-coach Maurice Cheeks. Because that act of support for Cheeks was followed by a back-room deal between Patterson and Miles in which the small forward would receive every penny of the fine back, plus interest. When I informed Cheeks of the arrangement, he said, “I might as well pack my bags.”"
