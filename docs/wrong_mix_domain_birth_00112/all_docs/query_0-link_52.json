        "text": "BRODHEAD — On Friday, Aug. 2, the Relay for Life of Green County invites the public to honor and remember loved ones and fight back for lifesaving change at the Jaycee Park, 300 4th Street, in Brodhead.\n\nRelay For Life of Green County’s event begins at 4:30 p.m. with an opening ceremony at 5 p.m. The theme is “Super Heroes.” Cancer survivors and caregivers will take a celebratory first lap, and the evening will end with a luminaria ceremony to remember those lost to cancer and celebrate all cancer survivors.\n\n“The Relay For Life movement unites communities across the globe to celebrate people who have battled cancer, remember loved ones lost, and take action to finish the fight once and for all,” said Evelyn Crooks, a dedicated Relay For Life participant and cancer survivor. “Many participants are our family, friends, and neighbors who have faced cancer themselves. Each new team that registers brings us one step closer to saving more lives.”\n\nThis year, Monroe resident Dan DeMuth is Relay for Life of Green County’s Honorary Survivor.\n\nMonroe becomes home and what an amazing community it is\n\nBoth Dan and his wife, Lisa, grew up in Dubuque, Iowa. In 2004, after earning a bachelor’s degree in education from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, Lisa moved to Monroe for a teaching job and now is a first-grade teacher at Northside Elementary School. In June 2005, the couple married, and Dan moved to Monroe.\n\n“After moving to Monroe, we tried to get involved in the community and do as much as we could to make things easier for others and have fun while doing it,” Dan said.\n\nAfter moving to Monroe, Dan worked as a center manager for the Check Into Cash branch in Monroe.\n\nHaving worked in radio while in Dubuque, Dan started working with Scott Thompson, owner of Big Radio, and his son, Ben. Dan spent almost 10 years on air on multiple stations that were part of Big Radio.\n\nIn 2009, Dan was hired as Wisconsin Community Bank’s personal banker to assist customers with deposits and loans. It was at this time Dan joined the Relay For Life of Green County Committee, and he also served as an alternate on the Zoning and Appeals Committee for the City of Monroe. Dan also is involved with the Monroe Lions Club and participated in the Comedy Club with the Monroe Theatre Guild.\n\nThe couple’s daughter, Maddie, was born in September of 2008. Maddie is now a member of the Monroe High School’s volleyball and softball teams.\n\n“She’s focused on her grades and always works hard whether it be in the classroom, on the volleyball court, or the softball diamond, she gives it everything she has consistently,” Dan proudly added.\n\nThe couple also has twin boys, Jacob and Michael, who love to go fishing at the nearby pond with their dad.\n\nAs their family grew, Dan changed jobs and works as a farm loan support specialist for the USDA Farm Service Agency.\n\nHearing the word cancer\n\nIn October 2023, Dan shared that he had an annual physical, and his doctor mentioned that his PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) level was somewhat high and recommended him to urology. On Nov. 2, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, and on Nov. 3, Dan was diagnosed with Stage IV kidney cancer that had metastasized, or spread, to his spine, and several other parts of his body.\n\n“The day I got the news I was scared, and I wondered how we were going to tell our children,” Dan said. “All I can say is Lisa is amazing and the best thing that ever happened to me. She said that we will do whatever we need to do — making each day count, that we were a team, and that we are writing our story.”\n\nAfter hearing the news, Dan said the next month and a half he was busy with appointments, meeting with doctors, getting scans, and planning for surgery — which was to remove his left kidney — scheduled for Jan. 9.\n\nCommunity is Team DeMuth\n\nLisa’s co-workers, district staff, students, friends, and neighbors joined Team DeMuth organizing events and food trains, selling cookie plates, distributing T-shirts to show their support and raising funds for the family.\n\nDan’s work has been extremely giving and flexible so that when he needs time off for appointments, treatments, or to recover, he has time available to use.\n\nNorthside Elementary staff and their spouses came and pitched in anywhere they could.\n\n“People helped put up Christmas lights, with yardwork, whatever we needed. They have been here 100% for us,” Dan said.\n\nOn Feb. 7, the staff and students at Northside Elementary School held an assembly to present the DeMuth family with an orange ribbon made with pictures and cards to show their support.\n\nRecently, the members of the J.A.C.T. Comedy Group along with a few other local comedians held a performance at Turner Hall and raised funds for the DeMuth family.\n\nDan added that the Monroe High School softball and volleyball coaches, all of Maddie’s teammates and their families have been incredibly supportive in raising funds and being there for her.\n\n“June 9 was the best day ever,” Dan said. “Lisa and I renewed our marriage vows with our children standing with us. It was a very special day. It was best to show them that love and family is hard work, but it’s worth every bit. Even though we were going through the most scary dark time as a family, we had the most amazing special day.”\n\nAdvice\n\nDan emphatically believes in “living for today.”\n\nOne of Lisa’s bucket list items was to see the Christmas Tree in Rockefeller Center.\n\n“Two weeks after my diagnosis, we traveled to Rockefeller Center. Live for today,” said Dan.\n\n“When we moved to Monroe, we were searching for family and a place to call home,” Dan said. “This experience has taught me just how amazing and generous the community of Monroe is. And not just Monroe. Lisa and I wanted to instill these values and beliefs in our children and they have witnessed how love and support comes back to those who give freely.”\n\nSomething Dan learned and said he shares often: “The biggest lesson has been that in this community, no one fights alone. You hear it all the time, but you don’t know if it’s true or false — our family knows … No one fights alone!”\n\nWays to get involved\n\nJoin the Relay For Life of Green County: Sign up to join an existing team or start a new team at relayforlife.org/greencountywi or by calling Jo Ann Steuri at 608-728-2980.\n\nThose that can’t participate in this year’s event can still help save lives by making a donation.
