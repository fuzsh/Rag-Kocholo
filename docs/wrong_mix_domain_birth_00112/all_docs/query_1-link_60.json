        "text": "It all started when…\n\nWhen I was 16 years old, I played basketball. Our high school had a great basketball team. At one point we were ranked #1 in the province. I grew up watching Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, & of course, Michael Jordan. Everybody wanted to be like Mike.\n\nDuring one memorable game, I jumped up to grab a rebound. As I was coming down, I landed on another player’s shoulder, lost my balance, and hit the ground hard. I lay on the court in excruciating pain. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t get up. Eventually I was carried off the court & into the dressing room. As I lay there, thoughts ran through my mind: What just happened? Did I break my back? Did we lose the game?\n\nMy parents came and took me home. We went to the doctor and he sent me for X-rays. Fortunately, nothing was broken. However, I was still in pain. He prescribed some pain killers and told me to rest. At home I took the medication, yet it made me feel worse, not better. I felt itchy all over & even felt like throwing up. I was having a bad reaction to the medication. I still couldn’t move very well, and now I felt sick. I wondered if I would ever feel the same again.\n\nFortunately, my uncle was a Chiropractor. My mom took me to Uncle Keith and after the first adjustment to my lower back, I could straighten up. It felt like a miracle. I was amazed. After a few more sessions I was feeling great! A few weeks later, I went back to playing basketball cumulating in a 3rd place finish in the Provincial finals.\n\nWithout Chiropractic treatment, I don’t think I would have been able to recover. I would not have been able to get back to doing the thing I loved most at the time: basketball. My experience as a Chiropractic patient was wonderful, so I decided to pursue Chiropractic as a career. That way, I could share my experience with others and hopefully, be able to improve the lives and well-being of others."
