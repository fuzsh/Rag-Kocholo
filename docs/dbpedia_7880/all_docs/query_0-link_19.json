        "text": "To criticize anything about this incredible multi layered documentary about the unique CA desert rock scene just wouldn't be adequate a bit. I call myself an on/off fan of this type of music since the mid 90s, and watching this made me feel 20 years younger again. It seems like a hell of work was invested to make this film look as cool, funny, smooth, grainy, entertaining and ...just captivating, and if I compare it to other films touching a similar topic- this one really stands out. It's clearly a filmmakers film, not a clean wiped journalistic piece. It's the way this story is told: The general underlying DIY approach really helps re-creating the intense atmosphere of how it might have been back then... at night... in the desert... with nothing but a generator and some instruments. The often rough but sometimes (when it's needed) very subtle editing supports this rather unusual doc film experience. As I learned from the credits the filmmaker did all by himself, even those simple but pretty awesome animations (kind of Gilliamesque I'd say). Those alone stand out, and you don't have to be a fan of stuff like that. -Here it's not too much of it, and it just adds to the general atmosphere perfectly. So yes, what I truly love about the film are its details. Who does something like that nowadays? With such a devotion for the topic? No wonder why it took 10 years to finish it. - I was actually one of those who waited for it since 8 years- since the first trailer showed up. It was worth the wait! Great things just need their time."
