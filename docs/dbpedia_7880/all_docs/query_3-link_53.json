        "text": "If you haven’t visited California’s hottest desert town in awhile, now is the time. In Palm Springs, the spring weather is perfect, the food scene is better than ever, and there’s a variety of nonstop events throughout the Coachella Valley all season long—from the BNP Paribas Open (affectionately known as the 5th Grand Slam) to the big White Party bash to music festivals and the plethora of parties that come with them.\n\nIf you’re more interested in simply exploring the historic city while enjoying some R&R under the desert sun, you can spend your days hiking its many mountain trails, shopping its impressive array of vintage retailers, hitting up a variety of cool cocktail spots and restaurants (both new and retro), and gawking at the magnificent midcentury architecture. As for where to stay, the best Palm Springs hotels are as wide-ranging as the area's visitors. Whether you're seeking a tranquil boutique hotel, a sprawling resort, or a retro-design motel with a shiny facelift, it’s almost too easy to find the perfect property to enjoy the dreamy desert weather and mountain views. Here are some of our favorite hotels in Palm Springs for your next trip.\n\nEvery hotel review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind. This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date."
