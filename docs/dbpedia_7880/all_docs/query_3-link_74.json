        "text": "Meet Palm Desert — your new desert hideaway, which offers the quintessential charm of Palm Springs without the crowds and chaos that characterize its Coachella Valley sibling. Palm Springs has long been known as a Hollywood hideout for some of the movie industry's hottest A-list stars since the 1920s. This desert sanctuary has served as a playground for iconic names like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Debbie Reynolds. Yet, its alluring reputation as a Hollywood hot spot, combined with its close proximity to some of the nation's best music festivals means Palm Springs often receives high traffic and fully booked hotels.\n\nPalm Springs is rich in upscale eateries and a thriving nightlife scene, while its next-door neighbor exudes a relaxed ambiance characterized by leisurely Sunday brunches and poolside lounging with a cocktail in hand. Palm Desert keeps things cool and casual while still hosting plenty of trendy restaurants and boutique hotels sprinkled in. Manicured golf courses nestled at the foot of the Santa Rosa Mountains host championship golfers while chic country clubs, hiking trails, and fitness studios await wellness junkies eager to soak in the desert's tranquil atmosphere. The ultimate home-away-from-home destination, it's all too easy for families and couples to settle into Palm Desert, with an abundance of vacation homes available to rent. With the ease of having all the essentials at the tip of your fingers, there's no better place to soak in the Southern California sun desert style than in this charming, underrated small town in Coachella Valley.\n\nWith miles of desert dunes and native flowering blooms covering the sandy plateaus of Palm Desert, it's easy to spend a morning getting lost in this serene wilderness sanctuary. The steep Hopalong Cassidy Trail is one of its most coveted hiking trails, winding 9.5 miles through the Santa Rosa Mountains and the San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. The trail received its name from film star and Palm Desert local William Boyd, who played a fictional character named Hopalong. Barrel cactus, cholla, and creosote add a pop of color to the desert's neutral color palette.\n\nAfter your hike, why not treat yourself to some retail therapy at The Shops on El Paseo? Often referred to as the Rodeo Drive of Palm Desert, this renowned upscale shopping district features a curated collection of designer labels and casual eateries. For a midweek pick-me-up, peruse the stalls of the Palm Desert Certified Farmers Market, open every Wednesday from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. You can expect to find everything from locally sourced produce and fresh-cut flowers to artisan pastries and handcrafted kitchen staples. If you find yourself looking for a leisurely way to spend a Saturday, tee off at Desert Willow Golf Resort. This manicured property showcases the best of Coachella Valley's desert habitat with stunning mountain views, and it even received a shout-out from Golf Digest as one of the best golf resorts in Greater Palm Springs.\n\nBlessed with year-round temperatures that rarely fall below 70 degrees, the nine counties of Greater Palm Springs are a picturesque paradise regardless of when you plan your desert getaway. However, December through May offers the most optimal weather conditions. While this may seem counterintuitive, the desert comes to life when many parts of the world are blanketed in a thick layer of snow and freezing conditions. The winter months in Palm Desert promise blue skies with mild temperatures during the day and cooler evenings. Spring presents an abundant collection of colorful blooms and warmer temperatures in the high 70s and low 80s — perfect weather for lounging by the pool with a cocktail in hand! Should plan to visit the surrounding areas of Greater Palm Springs, you'll run into the fewest crowds during the quiet off-season and just miss the flood of tourists that fly in for the desert's spring music festivals.\n\nSpeaking of lounging by the pool, it's hard to beat the pool deck at Hotel Paseo. With stylish suits fit for a couples retreat, a weekend girl's trip, or a family vacation. This casual-chic hotel checks every box when it comes to location. It's also just a stone's throw away from The Shops on El Paseo, trendy local restaurants and local attractions like the Living Desert Zoo, so guests have the best of the Palm Desert community at their fingertips."
