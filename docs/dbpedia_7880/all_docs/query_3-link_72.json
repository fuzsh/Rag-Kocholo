        "text": "Photo courtesy of The Red Barn\n\nIt's not hard to miss this bar and music venue--it is, after all, a giant red barn. Despite the farm-inspired architecture, the venue doesn't feature much in the way of country music. Local bands--mostly rock and reggae--often take to the Red Barn's graffiti-lined stage to flaunt what they've got. When local bands aren't playing, a jukebox fills the bar with rock and roll classics. In true dive bar fashion, the Red Barn offers cheap drinks, stiff pours and friendly bartenders. For a low-key night with laidback locals, head to the Red Barn in Palm Desert.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: Red Barn is a local dive in Palm Desert, known for offering nothing but libations, pure and simple.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: Eat before you come or be prepared to go on a liquid diet for the night. The Red Barn prides itself on being a \"real bar,\" meaning they don't serve appetizers or dishes.\n\nRead more about Red Barn →\n\nPhoto courtesy of Village Pub\n\nFrom dance floors to foosball tables, the Village Pub has entertainment for everyone. For live entertainment lovers, the ground floor of this downtown pub is the place to be. Village Pub offers live music every night of the week, plus there's no cover charge to enjoy the tunes. The bar has 13 beers on tap and a full menu, as well as an outdoor fire pit where you unwind with the live entertainment still in the background. With a friendly staff that won't kick you out until 1:30 a.m., the Village Pub is one of Palm Springs' more versatile venues for live music.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: Village Pub offers both live music and a DJ-fueled dance floor, as well as cheap drinks and late-night hours.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: If you're looking for live music, stick to the downstairs level. DJ-spun tunes typically dominate upstairs.\n\nRead more about Village Pub →\n\nPhoto courtesy of Zelda's Nightclub\n\nIf you want to dance your cares and the night away, head to Zelda's for the desert's largest dance party. For more than 35 years, Zelda's has remained one of the only true nightclubs in the desert. Just south of downtown Palm Springs, Zelda's offers an upscale atmosphere, a state-of-the-art sound system and sets spun by the hottest local DJs. Club promotions include short skirt nights and bikini contests. With weekly appearances by an all-male revue show, Zelda's is a popular spot for bachelorette parties or a girls' night out. Whether you're ready to mingle or just looking to dance, a night out at Zelda's is sure to entertain.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: Zelda's Nightclub is one of the desert's most popular nightclubs.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: Book a private table or reserve the skybox for a private retreat between dance sessions. Bottle service comes with unlimited mixers and scores your party a private area where you can recharge after a few dances.\n\nRead more about Zelda's Nightclub →\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto courtesy of Western Grill\n\nWhile this old-time, Western-themed saloon is a great watering hole, Neil's Lounge's true claim to fame is its famous karaoke nights. Locals, tourists and even celebrities drop into this dive bar for a stiff drink and a few minutes of fame on the karaoke stage. Drink specials are offered every night and the restaurant side of the bar, Western Grill, has an all-day $5 menu with bar-friendly fare like tri-tip sandwiches and beef melts. Karaoke begins every night at 8 p.m., so plan accordingly. On Fridays and Saturdays, the bar quickly fills up to standing room only status. For those who aren't inclined to sing, two pool tables are available in the back room.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: Neil's Lounge is one of the desert's most popular karaoke options.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: Drop by Neil's Lounge during the annual Stagecoach Country Music Festival. Not only is this a popular bar for festival after parties but celebrities like Keith Urban have been known to sing a round of karaoke at Neil's after Stagecoach.\n\nRead more about Neil's Lounge →\n\nNorth Palm Springs\n\nNorth Palm Springs\n\nWelcome to the jungle in the heart of the desert. This gay nightclub in downtown Palm Springs loves to party, and whether you're gay or straight, you're sure to have a good time in this high-energy club. With themed dance parties every night, no two visits to Toucans are ever the same. Nightly events include \"Jungle Boogie\" dance parties and \"Double the Fun Thursdays,\" and on any given night, you might spot the \"Go Go Boys\" dancers taking the stage. While you can always count on Toucans for strong drinks, friendly atmosphere and fun dance music, you won't want to miss the Sunday night cabaret shows. At 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., the divas of drag take to the Toucans stage for their popular \"Playgirls\" performance.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: Toucan's Tiki Lounge is one of Palm Springs' most popular gay clubs, with drinks, dancing and weekly entertainment.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: Being that Toucan's is one of the most popular clubs in the Coachella Valley, it can get really packed, really quick. Arrive before 10 p.m. to avoid the long lines that form later in the evening.\n\nRead more about Toucan's Tiki Lounge →\n\nPhoto courtesy of Schmidy's Tavern\n\nSometimes, all you need from a bar is a relaxing, laid-back atmosphere and a handful of well-crafted beers on tap. When it comes time to skip the rowdy crowds and late-night bar-fights, it's time to head to Schmidy's in Palm Desert. This watering hole tends to attract a more low-key crowd who come for the quality beers and late-night entertainment, ranging from acoustic bands to karaoke nights. Weekly beer tastings and a monthly beer dinner add to this bar's reputation as one of the desert's best for craft beers. A full menu is also served all day, and the bar is open late all week long.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: Schmidy's Tavern is known for its hefty craft beer offerings and nightly entertainment, ranging from live local bands to karaoke.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: Don't miss the weekly beer tastings, which introduce patrons to the latest and most notable offerings in the craft beer world.\n\nRead more about Schmidy's Tavern →\n\nPhoto courtesy of Richard Thomas\n\nForget noisy nightclubs and dive bars�if you're looking for a hip night on the town, head to the Ace Hotel and Swim Club. This hipster haven offers a quirky take on nightlife, offering offbeat options like bingo or arts and crafts hour in the Amigo Room. Local comics also take to the Amigo Room to bring on the funny, and DJ-hosted dance parties are a frequent occurrence. Poolside parties engulf the outdoor patio on weekends, bringing DJs, live music and dancing to the Ace. Also held poolside is the monthly Full Moon Party, which celebrates the full moon with a drum circle, tarot card readings and free-spirited dancing.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: Ace Hotel & Swim Club offers a wide range of nightlife options, including pool parties, bingo, stand-up comedy and karaoke.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: The Amigo Room offers a number of signature cocktails that shouldn't be missed. For a refreshing cocktail, try the cucumber- and mint-infused Desert Facial. Need to satisfy a sweet tooth? Opt for the Funky Pirate, which blends spiced rum with guava puree and lime juice.\n\nRead more about Ace Hotel & Swim Club →\n\nPhoto courtesy of Village Pub\n\nWhile Coachella Fest is a strictly seasonally event, The Hood in Palm Desert keeps the tunes and soul of the music festival alive all year long. This bar and music venue has made a name for itself locally by hosting both local and mainstream bands. Local bands play at The Hood every weekend and on Wednesdays, local musicians hit the stage for \"Open Mic\" night. While The Hood has a soft spot in its heart for local music, this dive bar has also seen the likes of larger names like British pop band Modern English. The Hood offers dive bar prices on its drinks and pizza. Add in some live entertainment, and it's easy to get lost in the good vibes of The Hood.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: The Hood Bar & Pizza is a Palm Desert nightlife staple, thanks to its drink specials, popular pizzas and live music.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: Since it doesn't look anything like a bar from the outside, The Hood is difficult to spot from Highway 111. Look for a large grey building between two strip malls. The sign is neon green but easy to miss in this long stretch of business complexes and strip malls.\n\nRead more about The Hood Bar & Pizza →\n\nDowntown\n\nDowntown\n\nPhoto courtesy of Bar\n\nOpened in early 2013, Bar combines handcrafted cocktails and live music in downtown Palm Springs. The decor draws on downtown's signature modern style, but there's a hint of dive bar soul in these walls. From the lounge at Bar, you can enjoy local up-and-comers during a singer-songwriter night or a popular indie band on the weekends. The typical live music lineup includes indie, experimental, acoustic and electronica acts. The stage and lounge are intimate, perfect for those who want to sit back with a craft cocktail or get into the groove on the dance floor. An affordable bar menu with bites like bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with bleu cheese is also served throughout the night.\n\nRecommended for Best Nightlife because: Bar offers craft cocktails, a tailored small bites menu and nightly entertainment, from live music to DJs.\n\nMarissa's expert tip: Weekends rotate between live acts and DJ-spun sets, so be sure to check Bar's website or Facebook page to see the full live music schedule.\n\nRead more about Bar →"
