That’s the gist of “Sunny Side,” Corey Wash’s commission for the Palm Springs mural wall, which gets a refresh every spring in time for Desert Gold, our Coachella-season shindig. The painting, a riotously colorful ode to communing with nature, isn’t just a call to get off your phone, but more broadly to take a step back and think about what matters.\n\nAce Hotel | March 19, 2024\n\nAn Endless Art Practice\n\nIt’s her studio, but to a passerby Hyungi Park would seem out of place. A vision in all black, the 28-year-old artist dons only a trace of color — the smattering of red tattoos that start on her left cheek and snake their way down her neck and arms, punctuating the thick collage of black ink. Her studio, on the other hand, is almost ethereal. Its white walls hold shelves brimming with machines, tools and containers of organic materials that Hyungi foraged, found or made.\n\nAce Hotel | February 12, 2024\n\nSoy Sauce, Like a Fine Wine\n\nEri Miyagi and Miki Nomura started Brooklyn-based Japanese condiment company Cabi Foods in 2022 for multitude reasons. One, their love of a really good mold called koji. Two, to share the Japanese home cooking they grew up on and its inherent emphasis on flavor and fresh ingredients. And to destroy the idea of Japanese condiments that “just sit there.” Launching with a yuzu vinegar, dashi soy sauce and sansho peppercorn miso — all sourced from small, regional producers — Cabi condiments focus on Japanese-specific flavors that go with anything: kale, chicken, vanilla ice cream.\n\nAce Hotel Los Angeles | January 29, 2024\n\nFantasma Paraiso / Phantom Paradise\n\nHave you ever seen someone you love reduced to a blurry apparition on Google Street View?

Tucked into an Ace Suite in DTLA at magic hour, buzzing with a magnetic, conspiratorial energy — plus cunning wit cut with vulnerability — it’s clear the two multi-faceted creators have a direct aux cord to the source — both together and individually. In advance of Blush!’s sure-to-be sickening soirée over Pride weekend at Ace Hotel Palm Springs, Shane and Saturn join us in dialogue.\n\nAce Hotel | September 22, 2023\n\nBallroom: 5 Things with Function\n\nLaunched last year, FUNCTION is a Toronto-based platform for everything Ballroom: culture, stories, events and education.

We gathered monthly to talk about history, sex ed and the courageous creative expression of voguing, as led by four of Ballroom’s most influential figures. Tears, cheers, breakthrough moments on the floor — the effects of FUNCTION remind us how alive and how staggeringly inextricable sweetness and pain can feel. Here, FUNCTION lays down five pillars of Ballroom.\n\nAce Hotel | September 19, 2023\n\nFor the Culture: Klancy Miller\n\nImagine you’re seated at a kitchen table. Around it, an amalgam of the wisest leaders in food, spanning both time and place — Africa, New Orleans, Rome, beyond — are gathered. It’s here they’ve come to share wisdom, family recipes and sage advice; insight as to they got started; where they find joy; the one recipe they’d share if they had to pick; and how to cook like Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, whose kitchen ran exclusively on the vibrations of intuition. Chef and writer Klancy Miller generously offers readers a place at that proverbial table in her latest book, “For The Culture: Phenomenal Black Women and Femmes in Food: Interviews, Inspiration, and Recipes.”\n\nAce Hotel | August 28, 2023\n\nArchiving Australia with Efficient Space\n\nMichael is the head honcho at Efficient Space, the Melbourne-based record label responsible for outfitting Ace Sydney with a treasure trove of a vinyl library and for archiving and re-releasing obscure, ahead-of-its-time Australian music. At Efficient Space, the mission isn’t burn fast but bright, but rather driven by the careful, occasionally tedious and always time-consuming work of preservation. “Most of the projects we’re uncovering maybe wouldn’t happen if we didn’t instigate it, and that’s the motivation,” Michael says.\n\nAce Hotel | August 12, 2023\n\nPrinted Matters: 5 Things with LA Art Book Fair\n\nFor the first time since 2019, New York City based Printed Matter’s beloved LA Art Book Fair has returned — gracing the opposite coast with its eclectic cohort of zine-makers, artists, collectives, and more.

We envisioned it as a home for us, for the city, for freethinkers who use sounds, dance and turntables to forge familial bonds through heavy bass and woozy synths.
