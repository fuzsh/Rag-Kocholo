Active in the music scene since 1981, Lalli is considered to be a pioneering figure in the desert rock scene and often cited as \"The Godfather of Desert Rock\". Along with establishing the generator parties of the early 1980s, Lalli's early bands in Across The River and Yawning Man were instrumental in shaping the desert rock sound. Along with the instrumental psychedelic surf that is Yawning Man, Lalli's musical sounds have stretched to freeform jazz and soul (The Sort Of Quartet), Stoner Rock (The Desert Sessions, The Green Monarchs) and a wide arrangement of other sounds.\n\nCurrently, along with Yawning Man and his current long-standing band Fatso Jetson, Lalli has performed with nearly a dozen different projects over the years, among a career in the restaurant industry. To date he has released seven studio albums with Fatso Jetson, five with Yawning Man, four with The Sort of Quartet and has contributed to numerous bands in the stoner and desert scenes in a career spanning over forty years.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Bands and The Generator Parties[]\n\nLalli's taste in music changed after seeing live shows from bands such as Black Flag, Redd Kross and Saccharine Trust. The music Lalli made did not fit in his parents' restaurant. Lalli said in a 2002 interview, \"The desert is the perfect place to make music, but it's a bad place to perform.\" This changed when Dave Travis (a friend of Lalli's) invited him and Mike Glass to jam at Pacific Palisades. Lalli indicated in an interview that it was difficult to play live there. \"We drove up to Hollywood Hills one day and drove into Mulholland Drive to jam on a generator. This was a great success. The only problem was that this was in a highly populated area and so there was a high potential for destructive behavior by public.\"\n\nA month later, they played their first generator party in the desert. Lalli said the following about this in an interview (2002): \"The desert has all the space you need. You can play live in front of more than 500 people and do whatever you want. In the seventies this was also done a lot by rock bands, but we weren't there then so we had to reinvent it. All you needed was a voltage regulated generator, musical instruments, word of mouth and a lamp. There was no culture in the desert so we had to make our own culture.\" Lalli bought his own generator and organized the Dust Festivals every three months as the generator parties were known locally.[1][2]\n\nLalli's musical career would start with playing in high school punk rock bands. Lalli would notably play guitar and vocals in Dead Issue during the time the members were in high school, from 1981 - 1983. The band consisted of Lalli, bassist Scott Reeder, drummer Alfredo Hernández and guitarist/singer Herb Lineau. The band would change their name to Darkside at some point. Under this name they have released one song (Right's Right) on the soundtrack for Desperate Teenage Lovedolls. The band members were the same age, but were in different schools.\n\nAfter Lineau left the band, the band name was changed to Across The River, one of the earliest desert rock acts. Mark Anderson strengthened the band as a guitarist. They drove in their car \"The Provoloan\" (a purple '67 Cadillac) for a year through Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco to perform. They mainly played at small and unknown jam parties with bands like October Faction, Painted Willie and Saccharine Trust, but also in the late 80's with bands from the label SST such as: Saint Vitus, SWA, DC3 and FIREHOSE. Hernández described the band as \"an animal with blues-like beats with a sharp punk rock edge\". The band has recorded one demo (N.O.) that had never been released (Until the 2010s). The song N.O. was later re-recorded by the influential stoner rock band Kyuss for the album Welcome to Sky Valley. Scott Reeder and Alfredo Hernández played together on the last album of this band and the tour that followed until the band collapsed in 1995.\n\nThe label SST had plans to record an album with Across the River. This did not happen due to miscommunication and poor timing. The band members of Across the River returned to the desert where they were best known for playing in deserted desert towns and generator parties. Lalli got married, had children and put his time in his family restaurant. John Garcia, Brant Bjork and Nick Oliveri (former members of the band Kyuss) all had seen this band live during their school period, marking a turning point towards music careers.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Lalli stopped organizing the generator parties after the atmosphere became more and more aggressive. \"In the beginning, friends of the band came to watch and party. This changed as more people discovered the parties. More and more audiences came with knives and pistols.\" \"At the last party, ten bands performed. We called it 'The Splattering of the Tribes'. The audience was about 1500 people. People came to me with bloody heads where the emergency room was, they were taking drugs, climbed on rocks. It became a dangerous situation. I felt responsible and stopped organizing.\"[3][4]\n\nHernández and Mario Lalli would add Larry Lalli as bass player and Gary Arce as guitarist to the band. They change the band name to Englenhook in 1987. With this band they worked more and more towards the sound which eventually became Yawning Man.\n\nYawning Man[]\n\nFor more details, feel free to view the Riffipedia page on Yawning Man.\n\nYawning Man was born in 1986, founded by Gary Arce and Alfredo Hernández, both of whom were unemployed at the time and just jamming together. Eventually Mario Lalli would join on bass and Larry Lalli would join as a second guitarist. Previously Hernández, Lalli and Arce had played in a hardcore punk band called The Breed before Lalli and Hernández would form Across The River.[5] At this time, the band started to play marathon jams from the garage to the desert. The word spread of these \"generator parties\" and large crowds began to show up. One of their earliest known gigs was alongside Saint Vitus and Always August.[6]\n\nTheir music heavily influenced the likes of John Garcia, Josh Homme, and Brant Bjork (who would later form the legendary stoner rock band Kyuss) to name only a few. According to a 2005 interview with Stonerrock.com, Arce stated that the band only ever performed in the desert with exception to one live performance at the Anti-Club in Los Angeles.[7]\n\nIn an interview with L.A. Weekly, Brant Bjork would speak positively of the early days of Yawning Man:\n\n“ Yawning Man was the sickest desert band of all time. You’d just be up there in the desert, everybody’d just be hanging, partying. And they’d show up in their van and just, mellow, drag out their shit and set up right about the time the sun was goin’ down, set up the generators, sometimes they’d just go up there and drink beers and barbecue. Sometimes it would be a scene; sometimes it would be very intimate. It was very casual and loose and everybody would like, while they’re playing, everyone would just lounge around. They were kinda like a house band. It wasn’t militant like Black Flag. It was very drugged, very stone-y, it was very mystical. Everyone’s just tripping, and they’re just playing away, for hours. Oh, they’re the GREATEST band I’ve ever seen. ”\n\n— Brant Bjork, L.A. Weekly (2002)\n\nFrom 1986 - 1987 roughly 30 - 40 songs were recorded on two different demos but no official Yawning Man album ever came to light at the time. In the late eighties Yawning Man's sound began to mutate into strange loops with an almost dark / freeform jazz punk sound, and the name of the band just didn't fit the music anymore. The band changed name to The Sort Of Quartet and in the mid 90's released three albums on SST Records and one on German label Hot Wax Crippled Dick. Also during this time the Lalli cousins achieved recognition with their band Fatso Jetson, which briefly included Arce. Another project would also form at the time known as Ten East but through most of the 90s Yawning Man's status was relatively unknown.\n\nNotably when Alfredo joined Kyuss the band would record \"Catamaran\" for their fourth (and final) album ...And The Circus Leaves Town, exposing many listeners to Yawning Man and a band Kyuss were heavily influenced by.\n\nIn September 2003 Yawning Man would return to the live stage with a four-date tour of California alongside Brant Bjork. Their sound further involved into instrumental desert rock, also blending surf, Middle Eastern sounds and folk. Thus the lineup of Hernández, Lalli and Arce would begin recording their first studio album nearly twenty years after the band had formed. A collection of 10 tracks recorded in late 2004 and described as \"a melancholic mix of acoustic space rock with elements of surf music, as well as middle eastern guitar style\", Yawning Man's debut album Rock Formations was released via Spanish label Alone Records on 7 March 2005.[8] A release party was held at The Scene Bar in Glendale, California on 4 March 2005. Rock Formations would be praised by critics at the time but even more heavily praised retroactively.[9][10][11] Yawning Man would go on their first ever tour that June in support of Rock Formations but Billy Cordell would take Mario Lalli's place on bass as Mario had moved and was unable to perform the tour or recordings on the next EP.\n\nOn 26 June 2005, Pot Head would be released on Alone Records, featuring four songs and a slightly darker and heavier tone throughout. Yawning Man would follow into the next February/March with a more extensive European tour, a seventeen-date jaunt through Germany, Switzerland and Belgium. Yawning Man would also tour throughout Europe once again in 2008, mainly performing at the Azkena Rock Festival and with Mario Lalli back on bass.\n\nIn 2007, Yawning Man was to release a collection of past material on a double CD known as The Birth of Sol Music. It was to be a collection of 30 older songs from the late '80s with an extensive booklet including information about the band and the whole Palm Desert connection. According to band member Gary Arce, this release had been postponed indefinitely. In 2009, The Birth of Sol Music (The Demo Tapes) was released on iTunes as a two-disc set containing 24 songs.\n\n2009 would only see a handful of shows as Arce and Lalli would collaborate with British band Sons of Alpha Centauri to form Yawning Sons, whose only studio album Ceremony to the Sunset on 23 July 2009 via Lexicon Devil.\n\nIn the downtime from performing, the trio of Hernández, Lalli and Arce would begin work on a second album. With seven new songs, Nomadic Pursuits would be released on 22 June 2010 via Cobraside Distribution. Nomadic Pursuits would attain positive critical acclaim,[12][13][14] reaching #9 on The Obelisk Top 20 of 2010.[15] Yawning Man would tour Europe that year in support of the album, which included appearances at Hellfest and Stoned From The Underground.\n\nIn an interview with The Aquarian, Arce explains the process of making Nomadic Pursuits and the 2010 tour:\n\nYawning Man would return to Europe that next June with the lineup of Arce, Lalli and new drummer Bill Stinson. This two-week tour with Blaak Heat Shujaa also included shared dates with Karma To Burn and began with an appearance at Duna Jam.[16] Billy Cordell and Greg Seanz would take over in the rhythm section around 2012 but no information of the band touring or performing that year is available. The next year the original lineup would tour with Fatso Jetson for the Legends of The Desert tour which included marquee appearances at DesertFest London and DesertFest Berlin. Both bands also released a split LP together for the tour on 26 April 2013.\n\nStinson would rejoin as drummer in line for a 2014 European tour through August and September. Work would also begin on a new record. The next year would see a second Legends of the Desert tour with Fatso Jetson through February 2015. In one of their busiest touring years yet the band also made appearances in South America for the first time and toured Europe again later that summer, though it'd be partially canceled. A live album of the band's performance at Maximum Festival would also be released in 2015.\n\nAfter a six-year gap and recorded in a single evening at at Ion Studio in Buenos Aires, Historical Graffiti would be released on 18 August 2016 to positive critical acclaim from the likes of The Obelisk,[17] Echoes and Dust,[18] Sputnik Music,[19] The Sludgelord[20] and Outlaws of The Sun.[21] The trio would return to Europe for a 26-day tour, including appearances at Up in Smoke Festival, Berlin Swamp Fest, Villa Pace and Reverence Festival.\n\n2017 would see a string of shows throughout March supporting Greenleaf and Truckfighters in what would be the band's first ever North American tour, 31 years after their formation. A tour of Europe would follow along with an appearance at Psycho Las Vegas and a 28-date North American tour and a mini-tour of Europe to close out one of the band's most extensive touring years. Work would also begin on a fourth studio album.\n\nYawning Man's first notable appearance of 2018 would see them perform in the desert at Stoned and Dusted, also featuring a guest spot by Brant Bjork on drums. On 18 May the band would announce their fourth album was set for a 6 July release along with a European tour in support.[22] The Revolt Against Tired Noises would be released on 6 July via Heavy Psych Sounds to widespread critical acclaim from the likes of The Obelisk,[23] Ghost Cult Magazine,[24] Echoes and Dust,[25] More Fuzz,[26] The Sludgelord,[27] Sputnik Music[28] and Outlaws of The Sun[29] among others. Notably it's also the first Yawning Man studio album to feature vocals, with Mario contributing to two tracks. This would include \"Catamaran\" as covered by Kyuss.\n\nFollowing a string of California shows supporting Dead Meadow, Yawning Man would embark on a seven-week European tour in support of The Revolt Against Tired Noises and also release The Birth of Sol on double cassette and double LP in support. The trio would go into 2019 on a month-long North American tour with Mondo Generator and Freedom Hawk. On 10 April 2019 Yawning Man would confirm a follow-up album was set for a June release via Heavy Psych Sounds with pre-orders and further details set for 16 April. Yawning Man would confirm the name of the album as Macedonian Lines on their Facebook.[30] Macedonian Lines would attain positive reception among the stoner and desert communities as the band toured Europe in support of the record. That August, Yawning Man would announce they would be touring Australia for the first time in 2020.\n\nOn 13 July 2020 Yawning Man would announce that a new live album, Live at Giant Rock. It would be a concert film released on DVD or Blu-ray with a complimenting LP.[31] Further details would be announced on 9 September for Live at Giant Rock, including a release date of 30 October 2020.[32]\n\nFatso Jetson[]\n\nFor more details, feel free to view the Riffipedia page on Fatso Jetson.\n\nFatso Jetson formed in Palm Desert, California circa 1994 when brothers Mario and Larry Lalli opened a live venue in Indio, California's \"Rhythm & Brews\".[33] The Lalli brothers, along with drummer Tony Tornay, founded Fatso Jetson in 1994 when the trio when the band composed nine or ten songs. The band performed their first live show in September 1994 as support for Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn. On the basis of this live performance Ginn would sign the band to SST Records with the intent of releasing an album.\n\nFatso Jetson would begin performing as many shows as they can, including a short six date tour with Kyuss. The band's debut album Stinky Little Gods saw release in August 1995. Two years later saw release of a quick follow-up in Power of Three, released in November 1997. This saw the first collaboration with Vince Meghrouni as he contributed harmonica and flute to the record. Around the time of the album's release Brant Bjork had joined as a rhythm guitarist. However by the end of the next year he would leave due to his commitments with Fu Manchu. Brant however did appear on two 7″ releases, one of them a split with The Bloodshot, and the other a split with Fu Manchu.\n\nIn late 1997 Fatso Jetson started to look for another record label and found themselves in the company of Bongload Custom Records. In April 1998, Tony, Mario and Larry entered Monkey Studios in Palm Springs to record their 3rd full length offering for Bongload. Toasted would be recorded in April 1998, produced by Chris Goss (Masters Of Reality, Desert Sessions) though it would be delayed until the next year. The band would do a short tour with Queens of the Stone Age that July and around this time famed artist Frank Kozik asked the band to record a record for his Man's Ruin Records. In August 1998 the band re-entered Goss’ Monkey Studios to lay down the tracks for a record that would eventually become Flames For All, released circa 8 January 1999 to positive reception. Toasted would see release via Bong Load Records the next month. Long time Lalli collaborator Gary Arce joined the band as a rhythm guitarist for a 1998 tour with Queens Of The Stone Age and continued to play with the band for a European tour (Also with Queens), which included an appearance at Dynamo Festival and an appearance at SXSW prior to the tour. Arce would depart from the band in April 2000.\n\nAfter some regional touring in the United States and a second appearance at SXSW in 2000, Fatso Jetson headed back into the studio to record their 5th full length studio album and working in collaboration with Jesse Hughes (Eagles of Death Metal). Recorded in Silver Lake, Ca. at Donner and Blitzen Studios by Mathias Schneeberger, Cruel & Delicious saw release via Josh Homme's Rekords Rekords circa 30 November 2002.\n\nAfter some highly anticipated dates with Queens Of The Stone Age, Fu Manchu, and Beck, Fatso Jetson quieted down for a few years. The permanent members Mario, Tony, and Larry had found themselves living in different cities with other obligations taking over their time. They consistently played regional shows and spent time in various studios recording but it would be a few years before any new music would come to light. Even in this lull LA Weekly nominated them as one of the “Best Rock Bands” in Los Angeles in 2003. Notably Mario had also remained busy with Yawning Man having a resurgence, leading to the release of their debut album Rock Formations in 2005. Tony spent some time playing with Black Flag alum Chuck Dukowski recording a record and playing shows in both the States and Europe with an appearance at Coachella.\n\nRecurring member Vince Meghrouni would join the band full-time in 2007. Sporadic shows took place over the next couple years but the band would begin work on their sixth album, recording at Donner & Blitzen Studios with Mathia Schneeberger and Total Annihilation Studios with Eddie Rivas. Fatso Jetson would tour Europe in 2010, built around appearances at Grand Blitz Festival and Roadburn Festival, sharing the stage with the likes of Oak's Mary, Ahkmed, Colour Haze and Los Natas among others.[34] The band also released a Split 7\" with Oak's Mary for the European Tour.\n\nArchaic Volumes saw release on 3 April 2010 via Cobraside Distribution. Archaic Volumes would attain positive reviews[35][36] and rank at #4 of The Obelisk's top 20 albums of 2010.[37] Fatso Jetson would further tour in support of Archaic Volumes in 2012 alongside The Atomic Bitchwax, notably appearing at Duna Jam and Stoned From The Underground.\n\nFatso Jetson (Now with a fifth member in Mario's son Dino Van Lalli on second guitar.) and Yawning Man would embark on a special tour of Europe the next year known as Legends of the Desert, with notable appearances at DesertFest Berlin, Desertfest London and Maximum Festival, the latter spawning a live album from both bands. The band would again take some time off as Mario Lalli would tour extensively with Yawning Man while managing the punk band OFF!. Tornay would join Brant Bjork's live band touring throughout the world in support of his 2014 album Black Flower Power. Lalli and Fatso Jetson would also be featured in the Foo Fighters' HBO miniseries Sonic Highways. Fatso Jetson would tour with Yawning Man again in 2015 (Legends of The Desert Volume II) and tour a second time with 3rd Eye Experience and Fever Dog.\n\nWork would then begin on the band's seventh album, though in an interview with The Obelisk Mario Lalli would admit the album came with some difficulties:\n\n“ “This record represents one of the toughest years in my life. To be honest, I barely got it done. It’s a very important record because I’m in a way coming out of a long troubled period, and with lots of love and help from my friends and family I got to a place where I could get back to music and express some of this stuff. The band spent three days at Rancho de la Luna with Mathias Schneeberger recording and co-producing and writing on some pretty rough ideas. Dino, my son, wrote a lot of the heavier, more angular, intense music, and I was coming from a more melodic, dark vibe… seemed to all come together. (…) The title of the album is straightforward and the record, the contrary action, to faith without works is dead. We are stoked to do the record with Gabriele from Heavy Psych Sounds. He’s been so supportive of us for years now, a good friend. That’s how this should be.” ”\n\n— Mario Lalli, The Obelisk [38]\n\nNow signed to Italian label Heavy Psych Sounds, Fatso Jetson's seventh album Idle Hands saw release on 7 October 2016, attaining generally positive reviews through the likes of The Obelisk,[39] The Sludgelord,[40] and Sputnik Music[41] Fatso Jetson would tour Europe in support of the album alongside Swedish stoner rockers Greenleaf, closing out the year with a hometown release party on 11 November alongside Mondo Generator and The Freeks.[42]\n\nFatso Jetson would do their most extensive tour of North America the next April and May, touring alongside The Obsessed, Karma To Burn, Weedeater and Primitive Man.[43] The band's activity would be more sporadic over the next couple years, participating in short tours with All Souls and 1000mods while appearing at various marquee events when time allows, as members are also busy with various projects such as All Souls, Big (Pig) and Big Scenic Nowhere. Fatso Jetson were intended to tour North America in 2020 supporting Planet of Zeus on their first North American tour, but it would be canceled.[44] following a tour with Stoner, Lalli would leave Yawning Man in 2022.\n\nThe Rubber Snake Charmers (2013 - Present)[]\n\nMario Lalli started the desert collective band Rubber Snake Charmers with bandmates he played with today and in the past. The band performed four times in 2013. Three times in Los Angeles and once in Twentynine Palms to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the band Dali's Llama's. The band at the time included Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Auto Modown etc.), Mike Pygmie (You Know Who, Mondo Generator), Herb Lineau (Dead Issue, Half Astro, Super Fun Happy Slide), Mathias \"Schneebi\" Schneeberger, (Masters of Reality, Sa Fi), Alfredo Hernández (Kyuss, Whiskey and Knives), Tony Tornay (Solarfeast, Fatso Jetson), Dino Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Auto Modown) and Vince Meghrouni (Fatso Jetson, solo artist).\n\nIn 2022 Lalli would revive the recurring project under the name Mario Lalli and The Snake Charmers. The 2022 iteration would feature Lalli with Sean Wheeler, Brant Bjork, Ryan Gut and Nick Oliveri. This lineup would tour Europe and North America with Stoner in 2022 and then again in Australia, minus Oliveri. On 15 December 2023 it would be announced that the first official release of The Rubber Snake Charmers would be helmed by Heavy Psych Sounds.[45]\n\nIn late 2023, The Rubber Snake Charmers' first album would be officially announced. Folklore From The Other Desert Cities would be set for a 29 March 2024 release via Heavy Psych Sounds.[46] The core lineup for the release would be Lalli, Sean Wheeler, Brant Bjork and Ryan Gut with guest performer Mathias Schneeberger.\n\nOther Projects[]\n\nLalli would be an early contributor to The Desert Sessions, a studio project curated by Josh Homme. Lalli, along with Homme, Larry Lalli, Alfredo Hernández, Tony Tornay, Chris Goss and Nick Oliveri would form a studio project known as The Green Monarchs. The three songs recorded (including a cover of \"Eccentric Man\" by The Groundhogs) would appear on Volume 4: Hard Walls and Little Trips. Lalli would contribute vocals on \"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire\" for Volume 5: Poetry for the Masses (SeaShedShitheadByTheSheSore).\n\nLalli would also be an early contributor to Queens of the Stone Age, a rock band founded in 1996 by Josh Homme. Lalli co-wrote two songs with Homme: \"Monster in the Parasol\" on 2000's Rated R and \"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire\" on 2002's Songs For The Deaf. Lalli also served as a touring guitarist for the band in 1999.\n\nLalli had also collaborated on several occasions with Kyuss drummer and solo artist Brant Bjork. Lalli would contribute additional guitar and lead vocals on \"Toot\" for the 1999 album Jalamanta. On 1 April 2003, Jalamanta would be reissued on the Duna inprint with a release show at Spaceland, Brant performing songs from the album with Mario and Larry Lalli.[47] Mario would also contribute as a guest on several of Brant's subsequent albums.\n\nLalli also contribute to the desert rock collective Orquesta del Desierto, a band curated by Dandy Brown and featured several musicians from the desert scene. Orquesta would release two albums and an EP between 2002 and 2006.\n\nAlong with Yawning Man and The Sort of Quartet, Lalli has collaborated in several projects with Gary Arce including Ten East, Dark Tooth Encounter, The Perfect Rat, Zun, Yawning Sons, Waterways and Big Scenic Nowhere.\n\nMario Lalli started the jazz band Rubber Snake Charmers with bandmates he played with today and in the past. The band performed four times in 2013. Three times in Los Angeles and once in Twentynine Palms to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the band Dali's Llama's. The band includes Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Auto Modown etc.), Mike Pygmie (You Know Who, Mondo Generator), Herb Lineau (Dead Issue, Half Astro, Super Fun Happy Slide), Mathias \"Schneebi\" Schneeberger, (Masters of Reality, Sa Fi), Alfredo Hernández (Kyuss, Whiskey and Knives), Tony Tornay (Solarfeast, Fatso Jetson), Dino Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Auto Modown) and Vince Meghrouni (Fatso Jetson, solo artist).\n\nIn 2022 Lalli would revive a recurring project known as Mario Lalli and The Snake Charmers.

This lineup would tour Europe and North America with Stoner in 2022 and then again in Australia, minus Oliveri. On 15 December 2023 it would be announced that the first official release of The Rubber Snake Charmers would be helmed by Heavy Psych Sounds.[48]\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nLalli grew up in Palm Springs. He was soon nicknamed \"Boomer\" due to his weight and height. During this period he listened to bands like Aerosmith. His parents were opera singers who owned an Italian restaurant Mario's—Where They Sing While You Dine in the Low Desert.
