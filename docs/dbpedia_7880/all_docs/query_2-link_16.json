        "text": "Biography\n\nOriginally formed in the late 1980's with the lineup of Gary Arce, Mario Lalli, Alfredo Hernandez, and Larry Lalli. 2022 to present lineup includes Gary Arce, Bill Stinson, and the return of Billy Cordell (Brant Bjork and Vista Chino) on bass and rounds out their yearlong active recording and touring schedule. Arce and Cordellâs background together dates to co-writing the 2005 Pothead EP and hitting the road for Yawning Manâs first European Tours of 2005 and 2006. Stinsonâs background steeped in the SST Records world through performing and recording with Gregg Ginn and Chuck Dukowski of Black Flag for several years. The three together have an approach that seems to flow within the songs and allow the reverberating tones to breathe into those atmospheric desert landscape we can visualize with each song. Yawning Man is acknowledged and recognized throughout the underground heavy music community as a key piece in the developments of the desert/stoner rock subgenres. While their contemporaries gravitated toward the heavy riffs of grunge, and post punk, Yawning Man leaned in another direction with their unique and organic, cinematic compositions and psychedelic improvisations...the perfect soundtrack to encompass the spacious moonscape atmosphere of the well documented \"generator parties\" of their area in the late 1980's. It was at these gatherings where they developed this distinctive style and sound by enchanting spectators with their seemingly endless free form instrumental sessions, which echoed through the beautiful deserts, mesas, and landscapes of the Coachella Valley. As time passed, their legend grew with notable names of the Palm Desert music scene paying homage to the group through mention and praise, notably with legendary desert band Kyuss (Joshua Homme, Brant Bjork, John Garcia, Scott Reeder) doing their own rendition of the Yawning Man track \"Catamaran\" on the 1995 Elektra release ...And The Circus Leaves Town. Festival appearances include Hellfest (FR), Azkena Fest (ES), Reverence Fest (ES) Desertfest London, Desertfest Berlin, Up in Smoke (CH), Psycho Las Vegas (US), Stoned & Dusted I & II (US), Monolith on the Mesa (US), and various others. The recent documentaries on the Deserts unique music scene Lo Sound Desert and Desert Age give light on Yawning Manâs influential impact on underground rock music. The new album âLong walk of the Navajoâ heads into a more dark and sometimes heavy direction that has each song telling its own story with a haunting and heavy sound that settles into its own space of beauty."
