        "text": "2024-01-21\n\nDoom metal is my favourite musical genre. Slow tempos, downtuned guitars, and heavy riffs.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThere's something about those crushing riffs and the way they wash over your body. It's like a thundering stampede of war elephants, creating a rich soundscape so dense that your very bones reverberate.\n\nThen there's the lyrics, which capture all kinds of emotions, from the sense of impending dread and despair, to the thrill of victory in battle, with surprising eloquence.\n\nIf you've never heard of doom metal before, let me fill you in. Get your headphones ready. ü§òüèªüòéü§òüèª\n\nOrigins\n\nDoom Metal was born, in part, by an unfortunate accident. A gifted young guitarist named Tony Iommi lost his fret hand's fingertips in a workplace accident. He thought he'd never be able to play again, but didn't give up. With the help of a coworker, he learned to extend his amputated fingers with thimbles, and loosen the strings to make them easier to pluck. This gave his notes the heavy, distorted sound that helped catapult his band into stardom.\n\nThat band was Black Sabbath.\n\nThe ensuing years gave rise to many imitators, gradually defining doom metal as its own unique genre within the heavy metal sphere. Since then, it has diversified even further, with different subgenres molding and shaping doom metal in all kinds of interesting ways.\n\nSubgenres\n\nDoom metal has many subgenres. What follows is a brief summary of each, and some example bands and songs.\n\nTraditional doom - in the vein of early doom bands, clean vocals (early Black Sabbath, Cirith Ungol, Reverend Bizarre)\n\nDrone doom - doom with a heavy, droning sound (Earth, Sunn O))))\n\nEpic doom - epic fantasy lyrics with clean (often operatic) vocals (Candlemass, Doomsword)\n\nFuneral doom - extremely slow, like a funeral dirge (Skepticism, Bell Witch)\n\nStoner doom - heavy and bluesy, frequent drug themes (Sleep, Weedeater)\n\nPsychedelic doom - psychedelic rock, but slower and heavier (Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard, Spaceslug)\n\nDoomgaze - shoegaze, but slower and heavier (True Widow, Jesu)\n\nDeath/doom - doom metal with death vocals (Acid Witch, Hooded Menace)\n\nSludge doom - incorporating punk elements into doom (Acid Bath, Eyehategod)\n\nRelated genres\n\nThere are also at least a couple of related, non-metal genres.\n\nDesert rock - in the style of the Palm Desert rock scene (Kyuss, Truckfighters)\n\nDoom jazz - slow, dark, atmospheric jazz (Bohren & der Club of Gore, Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble)\n\nLyrical themes\n\nDrug use is probably the most common theme in doom metal songs; perhaps because stoner doom is probably the most popular subgenre. However, dig beneath the surface and there's a lot to explore.\n\nDrugs (Black Sabbath, Dopethrone)\n\nWizards & magic (Candlemass, Witchcraft)\n\nChristianity (Trouble)\n\nAnti-Christianity (Reverend Bizarre)\n\nAbsurd nonsense (Goblin Cock, Blackwitch Pudding, Lizzard Wizzard )\n\nHistory (Doomsword)\n\nScience fiction (Mars Red Sky)\n\nEpic fantasy (Conan, Cirith Ungol)\n\nGrief and loss (Warning, Skepticism)\n\nThe desert (Kyuss, Truckfighters)\n\nSlasher horror (Acid Witch, Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats)\n\nWar (Devil's Witches)\n\nDoom Metal has something for everyone. Well, almost everyone. Hopefully you'll find something you like!\n\nDo you have any thoughts or feedback? Let me know via email!"
