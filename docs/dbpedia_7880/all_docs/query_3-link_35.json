        "text": "I got to Wonder Valley, a remote community at the eastern edge of California’s Mojave Desert, mostly by accident. I thought I was spending the weekend in Joshua Tree. This was nine years ago in the low information days of online vacation rentals before the ubiquitous smartphone — before it became nearly impossible to wander or to get lost.\n\nWhen people in Los Angeles talk about “the desert” they mean one of two quite different things: They are either referring to the manicured, climate-controlled, midcentury modern, golf-green, martini-chilled, enclaves of Palm Springs, Palm Desert, La Quinta and their surrounding resort cities, or they mean the High Desert, usually the town of Joshua Tree in the untamed, purportedly mystical, rawer, region to the north. Between these two lies Joshua Tree National Park where you can hike or meditate or get your mind blown by Martian red rock formations and landscapes too often called psychedelic.\n\nAs an East Coast transplant I’d had my desert visions disappointed in Palm Springs where the swathes of sand between the elegant landscaping and the searing heat were distant rumors of the barren landscape I heard lay to the north in the bohemian oasis of Joshua Tree. That’s where I wanted to be.\n\nI knew that I’d arrived in the High Desert when I saw the improbable Joshua trees on either side of the highway — their thatched branches and spiky tufts of knifelike leaves reaching up toward the brutal sun instead of sensibly bowing toward the ground. Like many other inhabitants of the Mojave, Joshua trees seem to welcome a climate from which most living things seek shelter.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
