        "text": "Desert rock doc gets previewed after 10-year journey\n\nGenerator parties, which spawned a genre of desert rock music shaped by the harsh local wilderness, have long held a \"Lord of the Flies\"-type fascination for international pop culture fans.\n\nThey were gatherings among the sand and tumbleweeds between the Indio Hills and Desert Hot Springs that emerged from a young punk and skateboarding culture in the early 1980s. When Coachella Valley cities discouraged punk rock nightclubs, teens and young adults created their own concerts with no rules, curfew or adults. There was drinking, drugs and loud music, but there was also something surreal about the duality of the beauty and the beastly conditions. Even when cops tried to chase party-goers away for assembling without proper permits, there was something exciting about being associated with bands on the run.\n\nThe scene, which produced such pioneering bands as Across the River and Kyuss, became even more fascinating in November when Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters produced a Los Angeles episode of \"Sonic Highways\" on HBO and spent more time talking to Mario Lalli and Josh Homme of those desert bands than legendary artists from L.A.\n\nJoerg Steineck, 35 of Berlin, Germany, is one of the many European fans who fantasized about the scene in which Coachella Valley bands hooked up amps to generators and created an improvisational rock music influenced by their environment. He began working on a short documentary about the history of desert rock in 2005. Now it's evolved into a feature-length documentary that is ready to be previewed, if not commercially released.\n\n\"Lo Sound Desert,\" featuring scenes with Lalli, Homme and many of the desert rock progenitors and their progeny, will be screened Saturday at The Hood Bar & Pizza in Palm Desert. The event also will feature performances by bands in the documentary, including Lalli's Fatso Jetson and Arthur Seay's House of Broken Promises.\n\nSteineck hasn't cleared the copyrights for all the songs he wants to include in the documentary, but he's hoping this screening will generate enough interest to inspire bands to let him license some of their songs to call more attention to the scene that spawned them.\n\nLalli, who was cited by Homme in \"Sonic Highways\" as the guy who brought the generator to the underground parties, has been Steineck's primary ally in this production. He staged an outdoor music party in Thermal in 2011 for Steineck to film and helped arrange this screening and concert at The Hood. When Steineck became discouraged by obstacles confronting the film's release, Lalli told him, \"You have done an amazing thing and seen it through where others would have lost interest.\"\n\nSteineck isn't attending this screening and show. He's saving for music licensing costs by cutting back on travel expenses. But he responded by email to questions about his interest in this desert scene more than 5,000 miles away from his home.\n\nQUESTION: What inspired you to make a documentary about desert rock? Was it more the music or the underground scene?\n\nSTEINECK: I obviously like these things called \"desert rock.\" I'm saying this in plural because there are definitely different approaches to it. And that's actually what I like, too — variety in music.\n\nWhat was primarily important to me in the beginning for making this film was the circumstance: the surroundings, the incredible wasteland landscapes and within this vast piece of nature some teenagers making loud music.\n\nWhere do you start your chronicle of the desert rock scene?\n\nThe film covers the period from the early '80s until now. The emphasis of the first part is completely on the early punk scene. The second part focuses on the generator parties and the evolving scene from the early '90s on. It finally explains the reasons for the success of only a few desert bands.\n\nWhat inspired you to develop your \"Lo Sound Desert\" short into a feature-length documentary?\n\nWhen I was studying film in San Diego … I asked a band via myspace if they'd be interested in doing a music video. It was more or less a random pick: House Of Broken Promises. I drove to the desert to shoot a music video and some interviews with the guys. After I got back home, I edited the footage I had into a small documentary of 20 minutes. But then I figured it'd be too one-sided telling the story of a whole scene through the eyes of just one band. So I started making interviews with touring desert musicians (in Europe). I released a trailer of the film on the Internet and realized there's actually a real desire for a documentary like this. The film I was working on up to that point was nearly finished and had gained a length of 60 minutes, but still couldn't provide all the details that were important in telling the whole story. I just couldn't get a hold of good original footage. When I met Mario, that was an important door- and mind-opener. I realized the Californian desert rock scene had much more to tell than what I had ever expected.\n\nWho do you see as the most significant players in the history of desert rock?\n\nI'd say Across the River (featuring) Mario Lalli, Scott Reeder, Alfredo Hernandez and Mark Anderson. From what I hear from others, these guys were a lot of people's main influence regarding making loud music and bringing finesse into punk rock.\n\nWas there a turning point in the desert rock scene where it became significant enough to warrant a documentary?\n\nThe rise of Kyuss and QOTSA (Queens of the Stone Age), but frankly, to me it was important to tell the story of all the other bands who never gained that amount of popularity. They were part of that same scene.\n\nWhy do you think there is such a romantic aura about desert rock when actually it was really uncomfortable watching music at generator parties with sand blowing in your face?\n\nI understand it might have been uncomfy from time to time out there. But to me, that makes the whole story even more appealing. The fact that you had to endure — even survive knife fights and wildfires — to witness a cool show probably really made it feel more \"real.\" Maybe that time of endurance was frustrating, too, but people went out there more than one time only. It definitely must have had its special qualities.\n\nIs desert rock growing in popularity in Europe more than the Coachella Valley?\n\nFirst of all, there's a difference in perspective of what the term \"desert rock\" actually means. If you ask people from the desert scene, they will probably say rock music in general played by desert bands is \"desert rock\" because it's simply influenced by those natural surroundings. If you ask general European rock music fans who are familiar with the term \"desert rock,\" the answer would probably be: Kyuss. To this day, die-hard desert rock fans in Europe don't really know much about bands like Across the River, Zao or Unsound. (They know) Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss, a little Unida, Slo Burn, Brant Bjork and the Bros — because these bands involve members of Kyuss. And there'll be some Fatso Jetson and Yawning Man fans as well.\n\n\"Desert Rock\" to Europeans probably means a specific sound that paints a picture of the surrounding but isn't necessarily made in the surrounding itself. There are small (desert rock) festivals popping up, like the Desertfest in Berlin or London, or Stoned From The Underground in Erfurt, Germany. (But) there are more Swedish bands nowadays that have a closer approach to what people from Europe would call desert rock (and) their music is made by a few guys who grew up in the woods.\n\nI don't think even bands like Fatso Jetson or Yawning Man are really appreciated for what they are by the majority of people here in Europe, but rather for their reputation as being \"desert bands.\"\n\nYou came to the desert to watch a generator party that Mario Lalli staged for you. Did that live up to your expectations?\n\nWe had the idea to set up a party — not a generator party in this case, but a regular party at the Desert Moon Ranch in Thermal in 2011 — to get a variety of different bands together to film. I asked Mario if he would be interested and he made it happen. That's a really great thing about Mario that can't be mentioned too often: He's a doer, and for that he's definitely one of the biggest boosters of the scene and a motivator for people like Brant Bjork and Josh Homme.\n\nWhat is the future for your film? Will you enter it in film festivals and seek a TV or theatrical distribution deal?\n\nSince this is my dearest long-term project, I'd like it to be seen by many people, not just desert rockers, because I think it will be interesting for people who enjoy music in general. So I will go the common way and send it to festivals and hope to get it screened at theaters.\n\nBut, it took a lot of self-financing and I still have to pay for music rights (to Warner and Universal) to get this film out. I'm now at this point where I have to run another Kickstarter funding campaign to release the film. So, to make this happen, I hope that people will share and promote it, so it can be provided to a huge audience soon.\n\nRock 'n' doc\n\nWhat: \"Lo Sound Desert,\" a documentary about the underground desert rock scene by German director Joerg Steineck, screening in an evening with live performances by many bands in the film\n\nWhen: Doors open at 6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 31.
