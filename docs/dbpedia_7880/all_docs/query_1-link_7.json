        "text": "Hot Pick\n\nSaturday\n\nStoner rock: Fu Manchu is such a legendary desert rock band, you’d think they were from the desert.\n\nFu Manchu was formed in Orange County in 1985 with many of the same influences as the Coachella Valley’s quintessential desert rock band, Kyuss. In fact, it’s drummer bears the same name as Kyuss’ bass player, Scott Reeder, and Kyuss’ drummer, Brant Bjork went on to join Fu Manchu after leaving Kyuss. He produced Fu Manchu’s 1994 debut album, “No One Rides for Free,” and played on all of their LPs from “The Action Is Go” in 1997 through “California Crossing” in 2001. Bjork remains friends with the band.\n\nMORE: Desert rock underground scene became a 'thing' after it was over\n\nMORE: Two documentaries chronicle history of desert rock\n\nWhen both Kyuss and Fu Manchu were coming up in the early ‘90s, their sound was dubbed “stoner rock” because it was heavy with a propensity to go anywhere in live jams. But Kyuss guitarist Josh Homme didn't liked the phrase, so it became called desert rock since that’s where Kyuss is from. Now Rolling Stone calls Fu Manchu's music, “the ultimate desert-rock.”\n\nThe band is playing at Pappy and Harriet’s with Shiners Club as the opening act. If you want to see Shooter Jennings at Pappy's, get tickets for his Aug. 9 show. The outlaw progeny’s Aug. 10 appearance is sold out.\n\nFu Manchu, 8 p.m., Pappy & Harriet's saloon, 53688 Pioneertown Road, Pioneertown. $18. (760) 365-5956\n\nBest Bets\n\nFriday\n\nVegas style: Donny and Marie Osmond are on my bucket list. I’ve never felt compelled to see them in concert, but Donny is 60 and Marie is 58 and I started watching the Osmond family on “The Andy Williams Show” more than 50 years ago. Maybe it’s time.\n\nThey've had a few hit singles, like “Puppy Love,” “Paper Roses” and “A Little Bit Country, A Little Bit Rock N Roll.” But they’ve become a Las Vegas staple with a high-energy act featuring big dance numbers, a crack Las Vegas band and sibling humor.\n\nBesides recording 142 albums collectively, including 51 that went gold or platinum, Donny and Marie learned their craft by starring in a TV series, specials and documentaries. They're a continuation of the prototype Vegas show embodied by Wayne Newton. And I’m glad I got to see him when he was almost in his prime.\n\nDonny and Maris Osmond, 8 p.m., The Show at Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa, 32-250 Bob Hope Drive, Rancho Mirage. $95-$150. (888) 999-1995\n\nFriday\n\nSide act: Andy Cahan calls himself “the most famous musician you never heard of.” He even has a GoFundMe campaign to self-publish his autobiography using that phrase.\n\nCahan is the prototypical sideman. He’s toured off and on with the ‘60s top 40 band, The Turtles, since 1973 and played keyboards on recordings with the likes of Ringo Starr, Harry Nilsson, Jimmy Webb, Eric Carmen, Dr. John, Grace Slick, Michelle Phillips, Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Frank Zappa.\n\nHe was once setting up his harpsichord in a Hollywood studio, he told a local music writer, when Jimi Hendrix walked in and started jamming with his group, including Lowell George from Little Feat and Jack Cassidy from Jefferson Airplane.\n\nNow he’s playing the Tack Room Tavern with the engaging singer, Courtney Chambers, and drummer Buddy Greco Jr., whose late father accompanied some pretty great artists himself in the Rat Pack era.\n\nAndy Cahan Trio, 8-11 p.m., Tack Room Tavern, 81800 51st Ave., Indio. Free admission. (760) 347-9985\n\nFriday\n\nBest of the desert: The Flusters are one of the most popular bands of the low desert and Jesika Von Rabbit is the queen, or at least princess, of the high desert music scene. Now they’re teaming up with a Thousand Palms band that formed last year, called Plastic Ruby, that plays “SoCal jangle pop.”\n\nIt promises to be an evening of eclectic, highly compelling music you can dance to.\n\nMORE: Gram Rabbit, with Jesika Von Rabbit, had one of top 20 high desert albums\n\nTo make this show more enticing, it’s being presented outdoors at the Saguaro Palm Springs. It starts with a “multicultural electronica and visuals” presentation at 6 p.m. and the bands will play as the sun goes down. The event is being built around the fact that the moon is scheduled to be full.\n\n“Moonlit Mojave,” featuring The Flusters and Jesika Von Rabbit alongside Plastic Ruby, 6-9 p.m., The Saguaro Palm Springs, 1800 E. Palm Canyon Drive, Palm Springs. Free admission. (760) 507-1650\n\nSunday\n\nGiving choir: There are many choirs in the Coachella Valley, but none is more active in giving back to its community than the Palm Springs Gay Men’s Chorus.\n\nSince 1999, this ensemble directed by Douglas Wilson has given back by helping the Gay/Straight Alliance raise funds for anti-bullying grants for the Palm Springs and Desert Sands Unified School Districts, singing at events such as the Desert AIDS Walk and the grand opening of the LGBT Community Center, and regularly performing at community events such as the Andy Warhol exhibit at the Palm Springs Art Museum, the La Quinta Arts Festival, Indio Woman’s Club shows and the Cathedral City LGBT Days.\n\nIn 2018, Mayor Robert Moon recognized the PSGMC as the Official Gay Men’s Chorus of the City of Palm Springs. Now they’re playing the intimate, air-conditioned Coachella Valley Repertory Theater. Principal accompanist Joel Baker will be at the piano.\n\nPalm Springs Gay Men’s Chorus, 2 p.m., Coachella Valley Repertory Theatre in the Atrium, 69930 Highway 111, Rancho Mirage. $30. (760) 296-2966\n\nWednesday\n\nDown beat: Jazz continues to be popular in the summer and one of the most lively places to experience it is Oscar’s in downtown Palm Springs, where 107.3 Mod FM presents bebop, Latin jazz and swing at its monthly Jazzville shows.\n\nThis week, DJ Baz is presenting the Jeff Pifher Quintet, featuring the East Coast-trained, West Coast-working Pifher on sax with Corey Coverstone on drums, Misha Bigos on keys, Colin Cook on guitar and Eric England on bass. Jeff Wolf of Mod FM will emcee and DJ Baz will play recorded jazz before and after the show and during the breaks.\n\nDoors open at 6 p.m. and you’re encouraged to arrive early for a good table for dinner."
