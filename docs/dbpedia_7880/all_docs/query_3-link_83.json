        "text": "Palm Springs is one of the trendiest destinations to travel in the states right now. Why? This desert city’s mid-century modern charm has been brought to life with thoughtful hotel concepts, photo-worthy shops and restaurants, epic pool parties and of course, nearby Coachella Music Festival. Palm Springs is no longer a sleepy retirement town. Now, it is a desert escape for the modern millennial who wants to get away for the weekend in style.\n\nDuring my trip, Labor Day weekend was bustling with young and fun likeminded travelers. We had a lot of pool cocktails, baked in the extreme heat (we forgot to check the forecast!) and discovered a cool new city that we will definitely be coming back to! Palm Springs is a great trip for a girl’s weekend getaway, a relaxing spa vacation with your significant other or a Bachelorette Party… we saw plenty of brides-to-be when we were there!\n\nPlanning a trip in the United States? Check out my other USA travel guides to plan your next trip!\n\nWHERE TO STAY IN PALM SPRINGS\n\nPicking a place to stay in Palm Springs was honestly the hardest decision. There are SO many trendy hotels that have been on my list forever and I still did not get to hit them all during my week there, so I will save those for next time! Below, you can find all of my favorite instagrammable stays + links to a few others that I’m saving for next time!\n\nTHE SAGUARO PALM SPRINGS\n\nIf you pick one place to stay, I would suggest the Saguaro. This rainbow-colored hotel is the instagrammer’s dream. During a normal season, this hotel hosts the funnest pool parties and has an amazing pool bar and restaurant. Even if you decide to opt for another stay while in Palm Springs, you can still buy a pool pass for access to the pool parties and property.\n\nThe rooms here are no frills and are reasonably priced depending what time of year you are going. The highlight of this property is definitely the punchy design aesthetic! If you’re a color-lover like me, this is your spot.\n\nThe pool was by far my favorite spot for photos, but I also loved exploring the grounds and finding cute rainbow-colored corners like those in the courtyard and the exterior of the building below! You will have more than enough spots here to get creative juices flowing and take awesome shots for your feed!\n\nI’m not lying when I say every corner here is photo-worthy! From the hotel entry, the spa, the pool, the rooms and the restaurant, you will want to snap a shot everywhere.\n\nPool time at the Sands was super laidback and a nice break from the crowded pool parties in Palm Springs. I loved their cocktails, mediterranean pool snacks and pink coconut water! (yes, it matched the hotel perfectly)\n\nMy favorite photo spots here were the entry, the pool and my super cute hotel room. Unfortunately, the spa was closed during my stay due to the pandemic, but you should check it out on their website for availability before your stay. The Pink Cabana restaurant is also extremely instagrammable and is featured below in my Where to Eat & Drink section.\n\nLA QUINTA RESORT & CLUB\n\nI know what you’re thinking. This is not the La Quinta on the side of the road in small towns. La Quinta is the name of a town here in the desert and the resort is named accordingly! The La Quinta Resort & Club is a Waldorf Astoria resort and a great stay if you’re looking for a place to completely unwind, get away from it all and have everything you need at one property.\n\nThe cute casitas are perfect for families or a couple’s getaway. With a golf club, tennis courts, several pools, and an array of bars, restaurants and shops, you will have your own little village to explore.\n\nThe grounds of this property are designed in the popular Spanish-style and are filled with beautiful tiled fountains, staircases and all of the bougainvilleas that your heart desires! If you’re looking for a beautiful and relaxing escape, this just might be your perfect spot.\n\nPARKER PALM SPRINGS\n\nParker Palm Springs is the definition of Palm Springs style. It is an icon and one of the most beautifully designed hotels I have ever experienced. The interior was curated by the famous designer, Jonathan Adler, who is known for his use of whimsical prints, colors and unique pieces. The Parker is definitely the most chic and the most luxe stay here in Palm Springs, so if you’re wanting to splurge, treat yourself!\n\nDuring this part of the trip, I was solo and unfortunately, did not get to stay at the Parker. I did enjoy a lovely breakfast here at Norma’s, which allowed me to visit the property and soak in all of what I was missing out on! I will most definitely be back here to stay, so I can fully enjoy the property. If you’re simply visiting the Parker like me, make sure to snap a photo of the interior design and the iconic orange door entryway. If you’re staying, be sure to check out the gorgeous striped pool decor!\n\nKORAKIA PENSIONE\n\nKorakia Pensione is a luxe Moroccan-inspired escape in Palm Springs that has been on my list for so long! I’ve been to Morocco a few times and this spot most definitely reminds me of those gorgeous riads and resorts I stayed at in Marrakech. The property is beautifully designed with luxe Moroccan accents and charming outdoor spaces that are the perfect photo backdrop.\n\nI was short on time this trip, so I did not get to stay at Korakia, but I will be going back hopefully soon!\n\nOTHER INSTAGRAMMABLE STAYS\n\nLa Serena Villas for luxe Palm Spring- chic villas located within walking distance from downtown\n\nHotel California Airbnb for a boho-chic desert escape for up to 8 guests in La Quinta Cove\n\nKrisel’s Glass Castle Airbnb for a beautifully-designed mid century modern home full of natural light and an amazing outdoor space with a private pool. Sleeps up to 6\n\nAlexander on Bedford Airbnb for a luxurious and trendy boho stay in the Beverly Hills of Palm Springs located nearby cute shops and restaurants and has a private pool. Sleeps up to 8\n\nWHAT TO DO IN PALM SPRINGS\n\nPalm Springs is all about the connection to nature and escaping the every day of our hectic lives. Whether you are into exploring the desert marvels, relaxing by the pool, visiting the mid-century modern hot-spots or heading into town to check out cool shops and restaurants, Palm Springs has something for everyone. Check out some of my favorite insta-worthy activities in Palm Springs below:\n\nSEE THE WINDMILLS AT SUNSET OR SUNRISE\n\nThe windmills are a Palm Springs icon. Juxtaposed against the mountainous desert landscape, the windmills are the sign of a warm welcome to the Palm Springs area as you drive into the city. They also make a great photo spot during sunrise or sunset when the light isn’t too harsh and there are less shadows.\n\nIf you’re looking for the exact spot to take a photo with the windmills, I’ve got you covered! From the city center, head down Indian Canyon Drive towards Interstate 10. As you drive down this street, you will see the wide open expanses of windmills on your left, so make a quick turn around at Garnet Avenue before you reach the freeway. Once you u-turn, the windmills will then be on your right and you will find a small dirt road inlet where you can park and take photos.\n\nVISIT THE DESERT DINOSAURS\n\nYes, you read that right! There are some massive dinosaur displays in the nearby town of Cabazon on your way into Palm Springs. They are on the side of the road and you cannot miss them! If you search Cabazon Dinosaurs on google maps, you will find this spot no problem.\n\nThis is a great quick break along your drive if you’re coming in from another California city. If you are traveling with kids, I’m sure they will love this place too! It’s free to take a photo, but you have to pay to enter the park exhibits.\n\nTHAT PINK DOOR\n\nI was so hesitant and nervous to visit this spot as I know it is in a residential neighborhood and the owners have explicitly put signs in their yard that say “No Photos”. I absolutely do not condone taking photos on private property, so please do not enter their yard or approach their doorstep for a photo.\n\nWith that being said, a drive through this neighborhood is worthwhile because all of the mid-century homes are incredible! I did snap a very quick photo from the car on the street in front of the home, so I did not intrude their private property or make a scene with a photoshoot set-up. If you absolutely must have a picture here, please be respectful, stay on the street and remember that you are in someone’s neighborhood at someone’s home!\n\nThe exact location of the pink door home is on E Sierra Way.\n\nSHOP ‘TILL YOU DROP\n\nThe Shops at Thirteen Forty Five are some of the cutest in town. Palm Springs has a ton of good shopping, but the pink wall at this spot is the most instagrammable! The shops at this location are a collective of luxe shops with everything from moroccan inspired interior design decor, pottery and boho vintage inspired t-shirts. Some of my favorite vendors here are: Soukie Modern, Daydreamer and Mojave Flea.\n\nDAY TRIPS\n\nIf you’re going to Palm Springs for longer than a weekend, take a day trip! There are so many cool spots around the Palm Springs area to visit that are worth a day of exploring and adventure. If you’re into an epic desert journey, check out some of my favorite day trips to other instagrammable spots in the area:\n\nTAKE A DRIVE TO JOSHUA TREE\n\nJoshua Tree is another desert spot that has been on my list for awhile and I am so happy that I got to take a side trip here while in Palm Springs. Located only 45 minutes away from Palm Springs, Joshua Tree is great for a day trip or an overnight stay on your Palm Springs trip.\n\nWhile in Joshua Tree, you can spend the day exploring Joshua Tree National Park, hiking the trails and stopping at amazing vistas like this one at the Cholla Cactus Garden. Entry per vehicle is $30 and it is valid for one week.\n\nIf you decide to stay in Joshua Tree, there are plenty of amazing spots to rent an airbnb from, but my favorite spot was the vintage airstream campers at Joshua Tree Acres. There are a ton of instagrammable spots here: the airstreams, a dip pool, outdoor bath tubs and a camper van!\n\nVISIT SALVATION MOUNTAIN\n\nSalvation Mountain is a spot I’m sure you’ve seen on Instagram. This spot is located in Slab City, a “lawless” community located in the middle of the desert slabs where a former marine base used to be. Don’t be afraid by the word lawless- this community is completely removed from society, electricity and modern conveniences, but it is safe to visit!\n\nThere are some crazy cool art displays here like the colorful desert landscape art at Salvation Mountain and the eclectic art made from scraps at East Jesus. This whole area most definitely has a Burning Man vibe and is a cool experience to see some creativity in the most barren of environments, plus you will definitely get your fill of photo spots!\n\nThis trip takes around 1h30 one way from Palm Springs to Slab City. Plan to bring water and snacks as there isn’t much here if you get hungry!\n\nTREK THE SAND DUNES\n\nIf the Sahara Desert is too far of a trip, look no further than the sand dunes in California. I’ve been to the Sahara, and I’ve got to say that the dunes here are just as impressive. There are massive sand dunes in this part of California at both Kelso Dunes and Algodones Dunes.\n\nThe drive from Palm Springs to Kelso Dunes is 2h30 and 2h15 to Algodones Dunes. If you’re planning on visiting Salvation Mountain, Algodones Dunes is a 50 minute drive away. This is where I visited and I was stunned at the beauty of the massive expanses of dunes here.\n\nWHERE TO EAT & DRINK\n\nPalm Springs has so many amazing restaurants and bars and you are sure to get plenty of good grub here no matter where you choose to dine. If you’re like me and your dining experience is equally about good food, ambiance and instagram potential, I’ve rounded up my favorite spots for you to discover!\n\nAZUCAR\n\nAzucar has contemporary cuisine with a mix of modern flavors made with local ingredients. The interior design is the definition of Palm Springs chic and it is a perfect setting for a girls night dinner or a date with your loved one. This restaurant is located at the gorgeous La Serena Villas near downtown Palm Springs and you can opt to sit indoors or poolside.\n\nLocated on the rooftop of Azucar is the stylish rooftop bar and lounge, Sugar High. This rooftop design is absolute goals and a perfect insta spot with an amazing cocktail in hand!\n\nTHE PINK CABANA\n\nLocated at the Sands Hotel & Spa, the Pink Cabana is a pink and green mecca serving up delicious Mediterranean food. Every corner of this restaurant is insta-worthy, plus the food and cocktails are pretty cute too!\n\nKREEM ICE CREAM + COFFEE\n\nI’m not much of a sweets girl, but I could not resist a stop at Kreem. This ice cream and coffee shop has the best vegan and non-vegan ice cream flavors that are all homemade with a unique touch! I had the vegan ube ice cream with mini marshmallows and it was heavenly!\n\nOTHER INSTAGRAMMABLE SPOTS TO EAT & DRINK\n\nPurple Palm for organic cuisine with eclectic interior design and a classic old Hollywood-style setting\n\nBootlegger Tiki for classic tiki cocktails in a kitschy tropical atmosphere\n\nTac/Quila for modern Mexican food and the best margaritas\n\nMr. Lyons for a modern steakhouse experience with a luxe mid-century inspired interior"
