        "text": "All information and images come from Wikipedia, Google, and liner notes. Any errata are entirely mine.\n\nIn the desert, desolation and freedom reign in equal measure. Inhospitable, pitiless, and bereft of normal human life, wanderers nevertheless trudge among the valleys and hoodoos in search of tranquility and truth. Sometimes they bring their friends and have loud parties with rock & roll and copious hallucinogenic drugs!\n\nSuch was the music scene in the outback of Palm Desert, California in the early 1990s. From that scene emerged a clique of psychedelic rock groups who often tailored their music for intoxicated minds, such as jamming or experimenting for long periods and using extended hypnotic segments. Nowadays, these groups and their imitators are called stoner rock.\n\nBorn of this psychoactivity was a band who would become legend. Welcome to…\n\nStarting in 1987 as a jam band called Katzenjammer the group soon changed their name to the Sons of Kyuss, after the D & D monster. In 1990 their eponymous EP was released and, after a line-up change, they abbreviated to Kyuss.\n\nKyuss’ albums feature a highly distinctive take on rock inspired by metal, prog, and punk music (Homme: “I loved Black Flag’s Jealous Again and Damaged, but it was My War that really summarized Kyuss’ approach to punk.”) including but not limited to:\n\n“sludgy, down-tuned guitars (often played through a bass amp for maximum, earth-shaking intensity), spacey jams, galloping thrash metal rhythms, and organic drums” (AllMusic)\n\nKyuss were marginally successful commercially, but their artistic reach is monumental. They inspire young bands to this day and most of their former members would go on to have long and similarly influential careers. Most obvious is Homme who would head up Queens of the Stone Age. Olivieri is a highly prolific artist who played on Queens’ first two albums and has been in a slew of bands such as Dwarves, Mondo Generator, Uncontrollable. He also plays with a pile of friend’s bands while they tour. Other acts associated with Kyuss alumni are Fu Manchu, Unida, Slo Burn, Hermano, The Obsessed, Fireball Ministry, and the list goes on.\n\nKYUSS IS:\n\n1987–1989 As Katzenjammer\n\n• John Garcia – lead vocals\n\n• Josh Homme – lead guitar, backing vocals\n\n• Nick Oliveri – rhythm guitar\n\n• Chris Cockrell – bass\n\n• Brant Bjork – drums, percussion\n\n1989–1991 As Sons of Kyuss\n\n• John Garcia – lead vocals\n\n• Josh Homme – guitars, backing vocals\n\n• Chris Cockrell – bass\n\n• Brant Bjork – drums, percussion\n\n1991–1992 As Kyuss\n\n• John Garcia – lead vocals\n\n• Josh Homme – guitars\n\n• Nick Oliveri – bass\n\n• Brant Bjork – drums, percussion\n\n1992–1994\n\n• John Garcia – lead vocals\n\n• Josh Homme – guitars\n\n• Scott Reeder – bass\n\n• Brant Bjork – drums, percussion\n\n1994–1996\n\n• John Garcia – lead vocals\n\n• Josh Homme – guitars\n\n• Scott Reeder – bass\n\n• Alfredo Hernández – drums, percussion\n\nKYUSS RECORDED:\n\nSons of Kyuss (1990)\n\nWretch (1991)\n\nBlues for the Red Sun (1992)\n\nWelcome to Sky Valley (1994)\n\n…And the Circus Leaves Town (1995)\n\nKyuss/Queens of the Stone Age (1997)\n\nBONUS\n\nIn researching, I came across this compilation of demos from 1990. Under warbling of the rough recording, the nascent sound that will carry through the years (and some of the songs that would appear later in the discography) are on display.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nCan I handle two simultaneous threads? Watch me crash and burn while I bang out the first installment.\n\nSons of Kyuss (EP) ~ 1990\n\nFeaturing:\n\nJohn Garcia ~ Vocals\n\nJosh Homme ~ Guitar\n\nChris Cockrell ~ Bass\n\nBrant Bjork ~ Drums\n\nOnly 500 copies of this EP were ever pressed to vinyl as it was an independent recording. It’s rough and the tell-tale crackle is all over this piece. Riffs, howling vocals, squealing solos and blasting drums are all fighting for attention – It’s an impressive start and doesn’t suffer much, if at all, from its humble technological constraints.\n\nDeadly Kiss\n\nThe notes are almost invisible beneath the fuzz clouding the opening guitar riff. After a quick spacey intro the gears shift with the drums booming in and we march forward to a little breakdown before the Garcia’s loud vocals thrust in. Feels a little thrash metal and I love the end to each bridge:\n\n“Dig your grave for two.”\n\nThe heavy metal influences are rampant here including lyrical content:\n\n“Drowning in your loneliness\n\nWant to bring me down with you\n\nNo one buys your innocence\n\nGonna' break your walls in two”\n\nBad-ass song and an ambitious 5 minutes long to boot.\n\nWindow of Souls\n\nAnother march. The track is similar to the last but Kyuss have hit upon a sound that I find intuitively enjoyable, so more of the same is still good in my books. I don’t think this song made it into future albums, which is just as well. This is solid, but not a standout.\n\nI’ve never been much into the lyrics of Kyuss’ songs and this song suggests that’s for the best.\n\nKing\n\nBass and drum intro and some feedbacking guitar. Not crazy about this one, but its serviceable, though very similar to other better tracks.\n\nIsolation Desolation\n\nNice haunting acoustic guitar and some scratchy vocals start things off before taking a right turn into more metal. I like the tribal “Whoo” backing vocal. After things go electric the acoustic still plunks in behind and it’s a lovely pairing.\n\nLove Has Passed Me By\n\nBy this point its clear that the riffs are not especially memorable. For a band inspired by Black Sabbath and who is clearly channeling them, I’m missing that special sauce (Such as Iommi on Vol. 4) that makes a group shine. I enjoy the song nonetheless. Garcia’s odd delivery is fun to sing along to.\n\nBlack Widow\n\nMore of the same.\n\nHappy Birthday\n\nNow this one sounds like a Sabbath B-side – I dig it! Guitar is much more distinctive here with a barreling solo that puts this one a cut above the rest. Garcia’s singing is at its silliest and I love it.\n\nKatzenjammer\n\nA biker anthem that kicks you in the nads. I love the time change after each verse, its satisfying as hell. And in case the pronunciation of their name confounds you, there’s a sexy lady voice to set you straight. Cleaned up, this could be a radio hit.\n\nAt about thirty minutes this is a decently sized EP. It’s a consistent album and that’s not entirely a good thing. From front to back the sound is predictable based off the first track, with the final two tracks being the easy highlights. The future greatness of Kyuss oozes from every second of this historical slice.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nThis was a nice palette cleanser after Wilcox's My Eyes...
