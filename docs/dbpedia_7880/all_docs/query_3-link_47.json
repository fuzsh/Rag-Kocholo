We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.\n\nCOOKIES\n\nA cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website or its service provider that is saved on your hard drive by your computer's browser.

These demographic and interest categories are also used to target ads on the Google Display Network. Using Ads Settings (https://www.google.com/settings/ads), users can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize their Google Display Network ad settings.\n\nOUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY\n\nTo prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we put in place reasonably appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
