        "text": "#10: The Black Crowes\n\nOriginally formed in 1984 under the name “Mr. Crowe’s Garden, this American band was fronted by the ebullient Chris Robinson. With his wailing vocals and The Black Crowes’ bluesy sound, there’s a clear connection to the music that influenced Led Zeppelin. But whereas Robert Plant and company developed in England, the Crowes are born-and-bred Southerners. In the early ‘90s, hit singles like “Hard to Handle” elevated the Crowes to stardom, and the tracks stand up today as timeless rock songs in the Zeppelin tradition. Up until their early 2015 break-up, the Crowes consistently released blues-rock anthems, tinged with some Zeppelin flavor.\n\n#9: Whitesnake\n\nThanks to big hits like “Here I Go Again” and “Is This Love,” this band is most often associated with the ‘80s. But what you may not realize is that lead singer David Coverdale once fronted the classic rock band Deep Purple, just as Led Zeppelin members was transforming into one of rock’s greatest bands. Given Whitesnake’s origin story, it’s not surprising that their lead singer adopted some frontman qualities from his ‘70s contemporaries. In 1993, 15 years after founding Whitesnake, Coverdale actually released a collaborative album with his old pal and Led Zep guitarist Jimmy Page.\n\n#8: Royal Blood\n\nThis Brighton, England band been has stunned music fans with their fusion of rock influences. Sonically, Royal Blood is reminiscent of early ‘70s Led Zeppelin, thanks to Mike Kerr’s vocal chops. But overall, they’re a little heavier. As a band, Royal Blood is still developing their sound, but the core inspirations are clear; and they’ve been praised for their immaculate live shows, much like Led Zeppelin during their prime. As for Royal Blood’s modern relevance, Led Zeppelin’s own Jimmy Page perhaps said it best: “When you experience their music, it’s like lava coming from the volcano.”\n\n#7: My Morning Jacket\n\nFrom Louisville, Kentucky, this band is known for their authenticity and originality. While My Morning Jacket may not remind you of EARLY Led Zeppelin, their experimental approach is reminiscent of Zep’s more experimental sounds from about 1975 onwards. Since 1998, Jim James and his bandmates have continuously explored new musical realms, all the while maintaining their country influences. Just as Led Zep roamed the roads less traveled, My Morning Jacket also takes their listeners on a sonic trip. Their music is meditative and atmospheric, but they’re entirely capable of rocking out as well.\n\n#6: The Black Keys\n\nIn the early 2000s, this two-man American band was the epitome of blues-influenced retro garage rock. If you’d never heard of The Black Keys, you might have thought their early hits were straight out of the late ‘60s or early ‘70s; the same era when Led Zeppelin was rocking hard. But this Zep connection isn’t just about the blues influence, or the soulful sounds of their respective lead singers. It’s about musical evolution: The Black Keys initially released stripped down indie anthems and swampy blues numbers, only to move in a more explorative direction. They’re a versatile band that can rock both small clubs and international arenas, just like their London predecessors.\n\n#5: Wolfmother\n\nIn 2005, this band recorded their debut album at Hollywood’s famous Sound City Studios. Once Wolfmother dropped their first singles, “Mind’s Eye” and “White Unicorn,” rock fans quickly embraced their retro sound. But if there is one song of theirs that gets people thinking about Led Zeppelin, it has to be the 2005 hit “Woman,” as Andrew Stockdale’s howling vocals sound eerily similar to Robert Plant. Wolfmother is a well-accomplished modern rock band, but it’s hard not to think about Zep while listening to the Australians kick out the jams.\n\n#4: The White Stripes\n\nDuring their long run, this American duo established a permanent legacy in rock music. Jack White was even featured with Led Zeppelin’s Robert Plant in the 2008 documentary “It Might Get Loud.” Musically, The White Stripes combine blues rock with a punk rock edge, making their music reminiscent of Zep, but with a timely feel. Whereas many bands stay close to the classic rock formula, the Stripes are known for their innovative sound, along with Jack White’s distinctive vocals. Like many other bands on our list, they began with a garage rock vibe but ultimately produced singles that are just as timeless as Led Zeppelin classics.\n\n#3: Greta Van Fleet\n\nLike Wolfmother, this band’s lead vocalist sounds almost exactly like Robert Plant. As a musical collective, however, Greta Van Fleet is relatively new to the rock n’ roll circuit, despite being formed in 2012. The debut album and its title track “Black Smoke Rising,” has a Zeppelin feel to it, and their most successful single to date, “Highway Tune,” will transport you directly back to 1969. With his phrasings and vocal tone, lead singer Josh Kiszka has the unique ability to channel rock’s famous front man, all the while adding his own flair with live performance. Overall, Greta Van Fleet balances the fine line between musical homage and creative originality.\n\n#2: Kingdom Come\n\nSometimes, rock bands are praised for building upon Led Zeppelin’s sound. But this German group was heavily criticized for sounding too much like Plant and company. In 1988, Kingdom Come released their debut single “Get It On,” which actually made some people believe that Zeppelin had risen again. Lead singer Lenny Wolf distanced himself from comparisons, but the criticisms continued, with rock journalists calling the band “Kingdom Clone”. While Kingdom Come hasn’t affected pop culture like other bands on our list, they DID stay together for nearly three decades. Let’s say this: Kingdom Come is admired by some, and annoying for others – just ask Jimmy Page.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\nBand of Skulls\n\nWhite Denim\n\nTemples\n\n#1: Queens of the Stone Age\n\nFormed in Palm Desert, California, this band’s sound really reflects their classic rock roots and influences. But whereas many rock bands imitate Led Zeppelin’s vocal and musical aesthetic, Queens of the Stone Age looked to Zep’s creative concepts for inspiration. The music is often existential in tone, and while some tracks have an almost comedic tone, others are more cryptic. The Queens are unique for rocking out like Zep, but not for ripping them off. In 2009, however, Queens of the Stone Age became forever linked with Led Zeppelin, as frontman Josh Homme teamed up with Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones - as well as superstar drummer Dave Grohl - for the aforementioned supergroup Them Crooked Vultures."
