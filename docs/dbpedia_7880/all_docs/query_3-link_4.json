        "text": "In the halcyon days, young music fans would drive out into the middle of the barren desert, park their cars strategically for a fast getaway if the cops came, get drunk or stoned, and just bask in the music, almost oblivious to the cold wind and sand blowing in their faces.\n\nThere was something about the music that made the conditions tolerable, sometimes mesmerizing.\n\nIn the 1980s and ’90s, they called the scene “generator parties.” Then it became “the underground” because the organizers never bothered to get permits and the parties sometimes attracted more than 1,000 teens and young adults with alternative music tastes. But, the average Coachella Valley resident didn’t even know they were going on. By the late 1990s, they were a thing of the past, like singing cowboys and the Rat Pack.\n\nBut, in a two-week period starting Thursday, March 17, two full-length documentaries about the desert rock underground will world premiere in the Coachella Valley. Jason Pine, a 2010 graduate of the California Institute of the Arts MFA program, will unveil his desert rock doc, “Desert Age: A Rock and Roll Scene History,” at the Camelot Theatres. Then, on April 1 and 2, German filmmaker Joerg Steineck will present his desert rock doc, “Lo Sound Desert,” as part of the American Documentary Film Festival at Cal State San Bernardino, Palm Desert, and the Camelot, respectively.\n\nWhy is there still such a fascination with this scene that never captured media attention when it was happening -- unlike other underground music scenes such as the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury, the Seattle grunge scene or the New York punk of CBGB’s in the 1970s?\n\nCertainly there’s a fascination with the outlaw desert culture, said Pine and Steineck in separate interviews. Rock artists such as Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Jesse Hughes of Eagles of Death Metal have given hundreds of interviews on tours around the world discussing their younger days playing among the tumbleweeds and trying to stay one step ahead of the law. Participants describe an almost “Lord of the Flies” transformation among youths drawn to the wilderness without adult supervision.\n\n“Every city or region in the world has an alternative scene in some way,” Steineck said via e-mail from Germany, “but what is unique about the desert scene is the natural surrounding where most of it happened. The general hook here is 'freedom'. This is of course fostered by the natural surroundings, the wide land and the unchecked view you get when you put yourself into the desert - not just on a hill, but everywhere really. To me that reflects freedom visually like nothing else. And this continuously seeps into the music that has been and will be made here.”\n\nBoth Steineck and Pine were initially attracted to the desert by the music. Both discovered there was something special happening in the Coachella Valley between 1980 and 1995.\n\nPine and his producer, Trevor Cushing, became fans of Queens of the Stone Age while living in Western Pennsylvania. Pine became intrigued by the genre of desert rock while pursuing his MFA at Cal Arts. He attended a QOTSA concert at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles and discovered Homme was actually a product of his desert environment.\n\n“Right before the show, I struck up a casual conversation with the person next to me,” Pine said in an interview at Unit A Recording & Arts studio in Palm Springs, where many of the desert rockers first recorded in the 1990s. “I asked him what other music he was into and he said, ‘I love all the desert rock bands.’ Being from Pittsburgh, I really didn’t have any familiarity with that genre and it really bothered me for some reason. I think that moment, coupled with my film background, work experience and love for music history, naturally rolled into this project.”\n\nSteineck discovered the genre while studying film in San Diego more than 10 years ago. He encountered a band called House of Broken Promises, led by guitarist Arthur Seay, and secured a deal to shoot a music video for them. After interviewing the trio, he discovered they were part of a large, underground desert scene. He turned his interview into a short documentary, but, realizing he couldn’t tell the story of an entire scene through the eyes of one band, he returned to Germany and began interviewing desert musicians he met as they toured through Europe. His turning point was meeting Mario Lalli Jr., who first brought generators into the Coachella Valley wilderness to power the electronic instruments that mesmerized the fans.\n\n“Mario Lalli definitely had a huge impact with setting up these events from what people told me,” Steineck said. “Although he was definitely not the only one who contributed to building up ‘a scene,’ he certainly mixed the right ingredients when he realized there was a real need for outlets in the face of a society unsupportive of the younger generation’s music, and the many restrictions made up by the authorities around that time. And it takes more than just coming up with the idea. Actually realizing it is what counts - going out there, doing it, taking the risk.”\n\nPine built “Desert Age” around Lalli and progenitors of the scene: punk rocker Sean Wheeler. But first he had to search for the roots of Queens of the Stone Age. After the Wiltern concert, he looked up “desert rock” on Wikipedia and realized some detective work was in order.\n\n“That Wikipedia page is so wrong,” Pine said. “All of the docs and mini-docs we’ve ever made, we chase this truth of what really happened. We pride ourselves in really chasing down every lead. We called everybody. The Queens were just the access point.”\n\nA scary moment came just after Cushing re-located from Pennsylvania. He and Pine had been talking about the film for two years, but they hadn’t heard any of the desert rock music other than what had been recorded by Homme and Kyuss. So they ventured out into the desert in search of stories and sounds and heard some great stories, but some terrible music.\n\n“You’re excited,” Cushing said, “but you’re also like, ‘It sucks!’ We’re making this documentary about this music and it’s like not that good! Oh, no!”\n\nIt all changed when they interviewed Herb Lienau, a member of the early 1980s punk band, Dead Issue, also featuring Lalli.\n\n“He started playing a Dead Issue song and I was like, ‘Whoa, the singing is really cool,’” Cushing said. “His delivery was really good and then I liked his guitar riffs.\"\n\n“That led to Wheeler and his band, Mutual Hatred,” added Pine, “and it all kind of came together at that point.”\n\nLalli points out in \"Desert Age\" that Dead Issue, like most punk bands of the 1970s, played for themselves, as opposed to what radio stations, record labels or dance club audiences wanted, which satisfied his sense of integrity. But then he joined the band, Across the River, with guitarist Mark Anderson and drummer Alfredo Hernandez and bassist Scott Reeder – the latter two of whom went on to play with Kyuss. Suddenly, they had a punk sensibility and the musicianship to jam. That began to influence other bands who joined them in generator parties in the desert. Suddenly, there was a mandate to be distinctive.\n\n“Once we got the Across the River tapes, then it was, ‘All right.’ Almost all of those were really cool and they all sounded different,” said Cushing. “One thing a lot of people think about the desert is that it’s a certain sound. And that’s what we thought. But everyone sounded a little different and sometimes totally different. I thought that was the coolest thing. There is no sound. You can’t define the sound.”\n\nSteineck followed a similar journey to conclude that Across the River was the main influence in \"making loud music and bringing finesse into punk rock.” But Steineck had to experience many of the bands in “Lo Sound Desert” while they were on tour in Europe. So, while able to empathize with the Coachella Valley musicians he was interviewing, he was coming from an environment in which desert rock had taken on a different meaning. Festivals such as Desertfest in London and Berlin, and Stoned from the Underground in Erfurt, Germany, featured a whole genre called desert rock. These European bands didn’t necessarily sound like Coachella Valley groups, but Steineck said they were inspired by Kyuss, House of Broken Promises and Lalli’s bands.\n\n“Maybe not so much music-wise, but there's definitely a vibe involved, maybe romanticization, that keeps events like these going over the years,” Steineck said. “It’s more about the imagination than the actual ‘desert sound.’ The last time I was at those festivals (last year) there were a lot of heavy doom metal bands, which aren’t necessarily figurehead of the Coachella Valley desert scene.”\n\nA common thread between the European desert rock bands and the Coachella Valley desert rock bands is the craving for freedom. That could be what Coachella Valley and European viewers take away from “Low Sound Desert.” European filmgoers may see it as a window to another part of the world and relate it to their own experiences.\n\n“If you ask me in which way desert music - from the desert - will color the international music, I don't know,” said Steineck. “But I'm sure the majority of musicians that come from there do have at least a subliminal restriction towards themselves that says: no restrictions.”\n\nPine also wanted to make a film that would appeal to as broad of an audience as possible, but he said he'd measure his success by the local reaction to the film. He said he'd like to make the screening of “Desert Age” a community event that will help Coachella Valley residents recognize their own music heritage.\n\n“Desert Age” ends with Kyuss co-leaders Homme and Brant Bjork talking about the break-up of Kyuss and Lalli’s influence on them. Homme said he was influenced by Lalli’s confidence in “shedding his own skin” and going on to other adventurous projects. Homme went on to start Queens of the Stone Age and such subsequent projects such as Eagles of Death Metal, the Grammy Award-winning Them Crooked Vultures and, most recently, his “Post-Pop Depression” album with Iggy Pop. Bjork went on to play with such bands as Fu Manchu, Che and his current group, the Low Desert Punk Band.\n\n“Mario was a great influence,” said Mark Anderson, who left the rock scene to become a marketing executive with the Buzz Factory in Palm Springs. “If I had to pin pushing the boundaries and staying true and having a sound to one person, I think his influence can really be seen in the (“Desert Age”) film.”\n\nIt can be seen in “Lo Sound Desert,” too. Lalli helped arrange a generator party in Mecca for Steineck to shoot in 2011 and then performed at a fundraiser at The Hood Bar & Pizza in Palm Desert last year that featured a rough cut of Steineck’s film. It’s been trimmed for its screenings at the AmDocs Festival.\n\n“It helps if someone takes care of all the work, like Mario,” said Steineck, “who organizes things, gets people together. Every generation would be good to have someone like him.”\n\n\"Desert Age: A Rock and Roll Scene History,\" 6:30 p.m. March 19, Camelot Theatre, 2300 E.
