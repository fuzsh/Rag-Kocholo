        "text": "The attacks that devastated Paris on Friday also touched many in the Inland area with ties to a Coachella Valley band that was performing at the theater targeted by the terrorists.\n\nFans of the band, the Eagles of Death Metal, expressed relief that their loved ones escaped injury when the Bataclan theater where they were performing was attacked.\n\nAll members of Eagles of Death Metal are safe and have been accounted for, according to a U.S. official briefed by the Justice Department.\n\nThe violence that spread fear through the French capital hit home for Riverside County sheriff’s Lt. Leonard Purvis and his family.\n\nPurvis’ wife, Liz, is a cousin of guitarist Eden Galindo, who relayed to the family Friday afternoon that all band members are safe.\n\nSome media outlets reported a band member was killed in the attacks. But Purvis said his wife, who spoke to Galindo’s mom, told him the man who is feared dead works for the band selling merchandise.\n\n“From what we understand, they were playing and heard shots being fired and they rushed off stage,” Purvis said. “There were hostages taken at the theater.”\n\nGalindo made it to a Paris police station, where he was able to call a close friend with the news that he was unharmed, Purvis said.\n\nPurvis said his wife spoke to Galindo’s mother, who was in contact with her son.\n\nAccording to the band’s Facebook page, the Eagles of Death Metal were scheduled to perform at 8:45 p.m. local time. The band was founded by Palm Desert childhood friends Josh Homme and Jesse Hughes. Galindo is a Los Angeles resident, Purvis said.\n\nHomme is also the founder and front man for Queens of the Stone Age, a Grammy-nominated rock band. A 1991 graduate of Palm Desert High School, Homme was alumni of the year in 2012, Principal Bob Hicks wrote in an email.\n\nMichael Homme, Josh’s father and a Palm Desert contractor, told the Desert Sun newspaper that his son is not on tour with the band. He told the newspaper he had a conversation earlier in the day with his son, who is in Los Angeles. Josh had not heard from Hughes, the paper said.\n\n“I would say everyone in that theater (who survived) had a close call,” Ian Hughes, Jesse’s brother, told the newspaper. “Thankfully, terrorists suck at their jobs, otherwise everyone would be dead.”\n\nHughes, who records under the moniker Boots Electric, was in Beaumont in December 2012 with Galindo to shop with children as part of the Shop With A Hero event put on by the Banning Police Activities League.\n\nPurvis, who was Banning’s police chief at the time, said he invited the two musicians to participate.\n\n“They have a big heart and wanted to do something positive for the kids,” Purvis said. “They’re just great guys.”\n\nPurvis said he has been in contact with Galindo’s mom, two brothers and other family members. The band is like family, he said.\n\nPurvis said he saw the band perform last month at an Eagles of Death Metal record release party in Los Angeles.\n\n“Today made us realize that all of us are vulnerable,” Purvis said. “It made us appreciate life and made us appreciate our family. We’re so glad that they’re all OK.”\n\nElsewhere, patrons at Pappy & Harriett’s Pioneertown Palace in Pioneertown, one of the band’s local stomping grounds, watched news of the bombings on a big-screen TV on a wall next to a photo of Hughes. The restaurant is in a secluded area northwest of Twentynine Palms.\n\nA manager at the restaurant, who didn’t want to give her name, said everyone at the establishment is friends with the band members.\n\nShe said employees are in a state of shock. They have not been in touch with anyone in the band or their friends or family, relying on news media reports for information.\n\nDespite the words “death” and “metal,” in its name, the band, which recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s late night television show, plays mostly rock ‘n’ roll dance music.\n\nSince its first album, released in 2004, the band has gained a cult following in the United States and Europe. Its songs, while rarely played on the radio, have been featured in films and commercials.\n\nOn Oct. 2, the band released its latest album “Zipper Down” which hit No. 59 on the Billboard 200.\n\nStaff Writer Margo Roosevelt contributed to this story.\n\nRELATED:\n\nPHOTOS: Live on scene of Paris attacks | More photos | World shows solidarity\n\nFRANCE: Long Beach student killed | Eagles’ employee killed\n\nOFFICIAL: Teams of attackers carried out Paris assault\n\nFRANCE: Germany, Iran, Vatican respond to Paris attacks\n\nFRANCE: Eagles of Death Metal end tour, head home\n\nFRANCE: Police hunting possible accomplices in attacks that left 120 dead"
