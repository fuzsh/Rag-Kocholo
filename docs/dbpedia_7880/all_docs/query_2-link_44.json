        "text": "Palm Desert is a city in Riverside County, California, United States, in the Coachella Valley, about 14 miles (23 km) east of Palm Springs, 121 miles (195 km) northeast of San Diego and 122 miles (196 km) east of Los Angeles. The population was 51,163 at the 2020 census. The city has been one of the state's fastest-growing since 1980, when its population was 11,801.\n\nHistory\n\nPalm Desert is in the ancestral homeland of the Cahuilla, a division of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. Their bird songs and funeral songs share the oral tradition of how they lived on this land for over 10,000 years.\n\nThe area was first known as the Old MacDonald Ranch, but the name changed to Palm Village in the 1920s when date palms were planted. Local historians said the main residents of pre-1950 Palm Desert were Cahuilla farmers of the now extinct San Cayetano tribe, but a few members of the Montoya family of Cahuilla/Spanish descent were prominent civic leaders.\n\nThe first residential development occurred in 1943 in connection with an Army maintenance camp in the area. That site was later developed into \"El Paseo\", an upscale shopping district not unlike Rodeo Drive. In 1948, the Palm Desert Corporation began to develop real estate, and in 1951 the area was given its present name.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 27.0 square miles (70 km2), of which 26.8 square miles (69 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) (0.76%) is water.\n\nThe elevation (at City Hall) is 224 feet (68 m) above sea level. Elevations vary from the lower northern half once covered in sand dunes to the upper slope southern cove (300–900 feet or 91–274 metres) all the way to the ridgeline at 1,000 feet (300 m). Palm Desert is in the Coachella Valley, the northwestern extension of the Sonoran Desert.\n\nSun City Palm Desert, California lies on the northern side of Interstate 10 from Palm Desert itself, but is unincorporated and not part of the City of Palm Desert (the original name was Sun City Palm Springs from 1991 to 1996).\n\nClimate\n\nThe Coachella Valley's climate is influenced by the surrounding geography. High mountain ranges on three sides and a south-sloping valley floor contribute to its year-round warmth. Its winters are among the warmest in the western U.S. Palm Desert has a hot desert climate: its average annual high temperature is 88 °F (31 °C) and average annual low is 64 °F (18 °C), but summer highs above 108 °F (42 °C) are common and sometimes exceed 120 °F (49 °C), while summer night lows often stay above 82 °F (28 °C). Winters are warm with daytime highs between 70–82 °F (21–28 °C). Under 3 inches (76 mm) of annual precipitation is average, with over 348 days of sunshine per year. The mean annual temperature at 76.0 °F (24.4 °C) makes Palm Desert one of the warmest places in the country. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Palm Desert was 125 °F (52 °C) on July 6, 1905.\n\nThe surrounding mountains create a thermal belt in the southern foothills of Palm Desert, leading to a micro-climate with significantly warmer night-time temperatures during the winter months. The University of California maintains weather stations located in this thermal belt as part of their ecological project in the Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center.\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1980 11,801 — 1990 23,252 97.0% 2000 41,155 77.0% 2010 48,445 17.7% 2020 51,167 5.6% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n2010\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Palm Desert had a population of 48,445.
