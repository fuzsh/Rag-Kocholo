        "text": "Palm Springs, where desert meets design, is buzzier than ever. This Mecca of midcentury modernism is teeming with new hotels and hotel revamps along with design-driven restaurants, art, home shops, festivals, and more.\n\nThe talk of the town at this legendary design destination is the recent purchase of iconic properties by billionaire investor Ron Burkle, the majority owner of private members club Soho House. The deal included the Willows Historic Palm Springs Inn and the grande dame French restaurant Le Vallauris, which has just reopened after a thoughtful remodel. Although not midcentury modern, the properties are beloved landmarks located in the Historic Tennis Club neighborhood. To complete the trio, Burkle also recently purchased the Bob Hope house in south Palm Springs. Thus far, no design changes to any of the properties have been announced.\n\nThis southern California desert town abounds with preserved midcentury-modern architecture, as well as timeless tales of Hollywood legends like Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra and his crowd who owned homes here. The new guard includes Leonardo DiCaprio, who acquired Dinah Shore’s Donald Wexler–designed house, and he once rented it for $4,500 per night.\n\nThough many folks prefer to simply sit in the sun, a Palm Springs getaway can actually be far more active than anticipated. Whisk up the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway to the 10,834-feet summit of Mt. San Jacinto to get the lay of the land. Learn the names of neighborhoods and see homes by the city’s Desert Modernists on the Architecture Tours by Modernism Week—which presents its annual design fête this year February 17–27. In partnership with the PS Architecture Tours, these fun tours, by minicoach or bicycle, provide the backstory as you view structures by luminaries like Richard Neutra, William F. Cody, Albert Frey, William Krisel, among others.\n\nVisit the Palm Springs Art Museum in a Brutalist–style building by E. Steward Williams and linger at its Architecture and Design Center. Book in advance for Sunnylands, a retreat designed in the ’60s by A. Quincy Jones for the Annenberg family.\n\nMany visitors shop at the Uptown Design District, with Just Modern selling a wide range of new home items inspired by the midcentury aesthetic. Head to the Perez Road Art and Design Center, located in a strip mall in nearby Cathedral City, for stand out vintage furnishings at Hedge, modern art and collectibles at Object Culture, and chairs, lighting, tables, and photography at JC Studio.\n\nPalm Springs has become a foodie destination too, with the chic, art-lined Bar Cecil—a homage to Cecil Beaton—the hottest seat in town. Splurge on its Fifty Dollar Martini, served with Beluga vodka and a Regiis Ova caviar-topped deviled egg. After shopping in the hip Uptown Design District, grab a cocktail at nearby Truss & Twine, designed by SOMA Architects, followed by dinner at its adjacent restaurant Workshop Kitchen. If you can find it, escape to the intimate European-style Counter Reformation wine bar in the Parker Hotel which serves creative tapas. Wait in line with the locals at favorite Cheeky’s, far worth the investment for breakfast classics like chilaquiles and eggs Benedict. Next door Birba serves good pizzas and traditional Italian dishes. Find the best coffee in town at Koffi, and enjoy the espressos and a tasty single-origin iced coffee.\n\nPalm Springs offers a wealth of hotels with quintessential poolside features. Among the favorites is The Willows Historic Palm Springs Inn, the epitome of old-school Palm Springs glamour. Set in lush gardens and housed in a Mediterranean–inspired villa, this hideaway’s rooms are spacious with antique furniture.\n\nAnother highlight is the newly-built The Rowan. At seven stories, it was controversial when it opened in low slung Palm Springs. This Kimpton hotel is decked out in stylish midcentury furnishings. Catch a sunset and skyline views at its rooftop High Bar, then dine at its 4 Saints restaurant.\n\nThis spring, Steve Hermann unveils 24 new uber-luxe Hermann Bungalows, the latest addition to his midcentury posh L’Horizon Resort & Spa, a restored William F. Cody property. The sleek and spacious new bungalows feature sumptuous detailing, Pierre Jeanneret lounge chairs, and private patios.\n\nCasa Cody, a renovated newcomer with original Spanish influences, embodies a retro-hip desert vibe. With two pools, the ranch-like hotel is set among palm trees with big mountain views and ample bougainvillea.\n\nAlso worth checking out is the new Sparrows Lodge, which features a midcentury-meets-mountain lodge kind of vibe. The hotel has recently undergone a major renovation under the stylish eye of Claire-Marie Astruc Rutledge, a well-known DJ and sonic branding specialist (her clients include Chanel, Dior, and Kitsune). This is her first hotel design project after a handful of residential ones put her on the design map.\n\nWith the popularity of events like Coachella Music & Arts Festival, a new generation is traveling down valley to discover resort towns like La Quinta. La Quinta Resort & Club is a classic Spanish Colonial-designed wellness and golf retreat, and provides an unwind after too much design binging, dancing, and schmoozing."
