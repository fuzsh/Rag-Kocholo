It was created in the US and the UK in the mid 1970's. The music and subculture of punk is known as an anti-establishment ideals and belief in independent freedoms. Aside from the distinct sound associated with punks, they are also known for their fashion. Punks oppose the system with body modification, tattoos, spikes, Mohawks and lots of black. Hardcore punks, on the other hand, want the music to be the focus and the dress more modestly. punks also have unique style of dancing - pogo dancing and moshing. You can find this style at most shows as well as stage diving and crowd surfing. Although many may argue punk is dead, some beg to differ and believe punks are still of the most important musical subcultures.\n\n2.Emo\n\nThe emo genre broke out in the early 2000s, however the subculture has been around since 1980s . Emo started out as a sub-genre of the hardcore punk music and the band Rites of Spring are credited with starting the subculture. In the early 1990s, the term \"emo\" shifted meaning and is more similar to the emo we know today. However, emo gained mainstream attention with the success of bands such and Jimmy Eat World, My Chemical Romance, Dashboard confessional, and Paramore. Emo is characterised by its confessional-style lyrics. Emo is perhaps one of the most stereotyped music cultures. Emos are said to wear tight fitting coloured pants, short sleeve band tees, side swept bangs, and horned rimmed glasses. This look was typical in the 2000s but as the emo subculture developed a negative connotation, the look as begun to shift. One reason for the negative reputation from the emo subculture is that many believe the lyrics of emo music glamorise suicide and self harm. Another reason for the backlash is that the subculture rose to popularity almost out of nowhere. Now, \"emo\" bands that helped create the genre, like Paramore have shifted from their roots and developed a new sound.\n\n3. Hipster\n\nThey say that \"Hipsters\" might just be the emo of today date. This particular music subculture seems to have many members that do not want to be identifies as such, particularly because of the bad reputation the subculture has. It's been rumoured that the theory of \"Hipster\" subculture was created by the hype of the media. no matter what you believe, the hipster culture is known for its association with trends and indie music. Many people use the term \"Hipster\" as an insult to call someone out for being overly trendy. . Because the culture does follow and create trends, it's hard to pin down the fashion of hipsters. Some fashion trends in the subculture flee as quickly as they were created, such as moustaches, but there are some hipster trademarks that always seem to stick around, like flannels and trucker hats.\n\n4. Straight Edge\n\nStraight Edge is a subculture of hardcore punk. The punk scene has always had a reputation for using drugs and alcohol. Hardcore punk band, Minor Threat,did not partake in these life style choices and therefore created this subculture. Straight edge originally was associated with punks,although it's now applies to any rock subculture. Straight edge means you refrain from smoking,drinking and/or using drugs. The straight edge genre can take it as far as following a vegetarian diet, not drinking caffeine, and not being sexually promiscuous.The people that associate themselves with the straight edge culture can identify themselves by an \"x\" or by a series of three \"x's\".\n\n5.Scene\n\nScene is a subculture that has a combination of several genres, making quite an interesting subculture. Scene kids have a distinctive style,but they are known for always being on the \"music scene\". Scene kids take inspiration from indie, electronic, rave, punk, and emo fashion for their one-of-a-kind look. A typical scene kid styling is bright colours, heavy eyeliner,band tees, skinny jeans, studded belts, converse shoes,coloured hair, and loud accessories.\n\ntaking that into consideration,the scene kid look is starting to evolve to feature a more hardcore look by wearing combat boots and wearing more cartoonist prints.\n\nThe social network, MySpace was a big part in influencing the scene subculture. MySpace was huge in the growing popularity. Although there has been decline in the subculture in recent years.\n\n6 Hippie\n\nHippies were the first music subculture that gained notoriety. Hippies more advance genre then just a subculture,however as they created an entire movement, hippies were characterised as the youth who moved to Greenwich Village in NYC or the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco in the mid late 1960s. Throughout the time of the hippie revolution, there was another cultural revolution at work - the sexual revolution. Hippies participated in this revolution, which is why we characterise them as valuing \"free love\". Hippies listened to Psychedelic rock and also experimented with psychedelic drugs. Hippies influences society and culture in a large way and they continue to have an affect today. For example, music festivals are an perfect example for the influences of hippie culture which we still have in society. Fashion trends in the hippie subculture was unusual. Many wore sported bell-bottom jeans, vests, peasant tops, tie-dyed clothes, beaded jewellery, bootleg trousers/jeans and headscarves. Hippies also have a political agenda in the 1960's. Most hippies were pacifists who promoted peace, homosexual rights, feminism and other aspects of civil rights. Hippies have influenced popular cultures more then any other music subculture."
