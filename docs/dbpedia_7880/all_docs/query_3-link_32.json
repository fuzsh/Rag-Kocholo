Get ready to feel the good vibes and let the music take you back in time.\n\nA bit of history about American/British protégé Woody Retro:\n\nIt was long ago at age three in Reading, Pennsylvania, Elwood Reppert Jr. discovered his passion for music. The music seed was planted after the three-year-old heard Elvis Presley sing “I’m All Shook Up.” Elwood, known by his friends and family as “Woody” was strolling down the aisle in a grocery store with his parents after listening to Elvis sing on the car radio. It was Woody’s first time hearing the song, and as he strolled the aisle, toddler Woody blurted out the words, “I’m All Shook Off.” His Mom stopped dead in her tracks, looked at his Dad and said, “I think we have a singer in the family.” Both parents were entertainers. Woody’s mom was in theater, and his dad was a trumpet player and leader of a band during the Big Band Swing Era. There was no doubt the music gene was in Woody’s DNA.\n\nBorn and raised in Reading, Pennsylvania offered Woody many opportunities for the Vocalist/Bassist to perform and travel. In 2016, Woody was inducted into the Berks County Pennsylvania Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In 2017, Woody began participating in open mic performances and jams throughout Coachella Valley, California, and he played bass guitar and sang with local bands and musicians. Performing the feel good sounds of the swinging 60’s was always Woody’s desire, and in 2019, he teamed with two longtime friends, Drummer James St James and Guitarist Jerry Steelfox to form an early 60’s rock band called SAINTSTEELWOOD®. In 2024, to meet the demands of a growing list of performances, the name of the band was changed to Woody & The Retros. Today, Woody & The Retros continue to play the early 60’s genre of niche tunes and “Feel Good Sounds of the Swingin’ 60’s” throughout Southern California’s Desert Cities and beyond.\n\nJune 2024 + Scheduled Shows throughout the Coachella Valley, California:\n\nJune 2024\n\n2 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert Woody & The Retros 6:30-9:30PM Sunday (*)\n\n6 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert Woody & The Retros 6:30-9:30PM Thursday (*)\n\n7 Tri Palms CC Estates Woody & The Retros 6-9 PM (*)\n\n9 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert The Refills 6:30pm to 9:30pm\n\n13 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert Woody & The Retros 6:30-9:30PM Thursday (*)\n\n14 The Tack Room Patio Woody & The Retros 7-10 PM (*)\n\n16 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert Woody & The Retros 6:30-9:30PM Sunday (*)\n\n20 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert Woody & The Retros 6:30-9:30PM Thursday (*)\n\n21 Booked Private\n\n23 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert The Refills 6:30pm to 9:30pm Sunday\n\n27 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert Woody & The Retros 6:30-9:30PM Thursday (*)\n\n28 BaBaloo Lounge Palm Desert Woody & The Retros 7-11 PM Friday (*)\n\n30 BaBaLoo Lounge Palm Desert Woody & The Retros 6:30-9:30PM Sunday (*)\n\nJuly 2024\n\n5 Fantasy Springs Rock Yard The Refills 7-9:30 PM\n\n14 Woody & The Retros Private Party Sun City 6-8PM (*)\n\n20 Desert Fox Bar 9-11PM Saturday Woody & The Retros\n\nAugust 2024\n\n23 Booked Private\n\nSept 2024\n\n6 Fantasy Springs Rock Yard The Refills 7-9:30PM\n\n7 Tri Palms Woody & The Retros 6-9 PM\n\n26 Big Rock Pub 7:30 – 10:30 PM The Refills\n\nNovember 2024\n\n16 Private Party Tri Palm Estates Woody & The Retros 6-9pm (*)\n\n21 Private Party Quail Valley Senior Park 7-9 PM Woody & The Retros (*)\n\n22 Private Party Desert Shadows RV Resort Cat City 7-9 PM (*)\n\nDecember 2024\n\n7 Big Rock Pub 7:30 – 10:30 PM The Refills\n\n8 Woody & The Retros Private Party Sun City 6-8 PM (*)\n\n21 Private Party Cat City Woody & The Retros (*)\n\n31 Private Party NYE Tri Palms Woody & The Retros\n\nSocial Media makes it easy to keep in touch with Woody & The Retros:\n\nVisit & Follow Woody & The Retros Page\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/woodyandtheretros\n\nWoody & The Retros\n\nWoody Retro vocals/bass\n\nTim McFall drums\n\nTerrance Lee guitar\n\nThe Refills\n\nHenry Wells guitar\n\nTerry Dubas drums\n\nPeter Kadile guitar"
