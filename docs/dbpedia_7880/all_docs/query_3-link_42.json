        "text": "Local’s guide to making the most of Coachella weekends without the festival frenzy.\n\nPalm Springs can feel crowded with thousands attending the April music festivals. Hotels are full, and there is a lot more traffic. However, did you know they clear out of Palm Springs in the morning and don’t return until late at night? That makes it the right time for residents to get out and support all locally-owned businesses. While tourists flock from far and wide to experience the allure of this desert paradise, it is a great time for locals to become visitors in your own backyard. Check out that boutique you’ve been eyeing, try a new restaurant, or stop by the locally-owned retail stores that line Palm Canyon.\n\nHere are some ideas to make the most of this bustling time in Palm Springs. Plus, check out the special deals.\n\nDine at a Local Favorite Restaurant\n\nSo you think you can’t get into a restaurant during these busy weekends? Not true!\n\nMost of the visitor base is at the music festivals. Making a reservation for a locally-owned Palm Springs restaurant during slow periods is a great way to support the community and enjoy a unique dining experience.\n\nLocals dining at new restaurants not only indulge their taste buds but also play a pivotal role in shaping the culinary scene. With eager anticipation, I step into these establishments and am keen to explore innovative flavors and culinary concepts. Each dish becomes a delightful journey, offering a glimpse into the creativity and passion of the chefs behind the scenes. Locals forge connections with the restaurant staff and fellow diners as you savor every bite. Local support nurtures these budding eateries, ensuring they thrive and become cherished staples in the neighborhood dining landscape.\n\nAlice B. – 1122 E Tahquitz Canyon Way\n\nLiving Out is excited to announce the name of its on-premises restaurant, led by world-renowned chefs and restaurateurs Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken.

The name Alice B. was inspired by the legendary California-born author Alice B. Toklas, who wrote, amongst other things, a memoir disguised as a cookbook chronicling her life with partner Gertrude Stein. Alice and Gertrude shared a publicly acknowledged and enduring relationship for nearly four decades and, as members of the Parisian avant-garde of the early 20th century, hosted regular salons attended by relative “unknowns” who would go on to become some of the world’s most influential and celebrated artists and writers.\n\nMinerva’s at Life House – 1700 S.
