He co-founded and occasionally performs with Eagles of Death Metal, playing drums and bass for their studio recordings, and produces a musical improv series with other musicians, mostly from the Palm Desert Scene, known as The Desert Sessions. In 2009, he formed a new project called Them Crooked Vultures with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones, who released their debut album that same year. In 2016, he released Post Pop Depression, an album with Iggy Pop.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1963 - Relative newcomers Bob Dylan and Joan Baez appeared with Pete Seeger at the first Monterey Folk Festival.\n\n1969 - Joni Mitchell was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine, on sale for 35 Cents.\n\n1974 - Ray Stevens' \"The Streak\" hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts\n\n1987 - A fire destroyed Tom Petty's house in Los Angeles, the cost was estimated at $800,000.\n\n1989 - Rolling Stone ex-bassist Bill Wyman opened the first of his Stones-themed restaurants, Sticky Fingers, in London.\n\n1990 - Nirvana played the last date of a North American tour in Idaho.
