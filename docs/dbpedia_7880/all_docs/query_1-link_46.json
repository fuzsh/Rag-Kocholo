        "text": "Josh Homme was born in Joshua Tree and grew up in Palm Desert, California. He founded Queens of the Stone Age in 1996 and is the lead singer, primary songwriter and guitarist in the band. Josh is one of the music industry's most prolific collaborators. Alongside Queens, he formed the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures in 2009 with Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters) and John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin), and has produced music for Arctic Monkeys, Iggy Pop, Lady Gaga and many more. Queens of the Stone Age released their latest album, In Times New Roman, in 2023. To mark the final episode of the series, Angela makes some extra-special dishes for Josh, while Nick mixes his favourite cocktail, a Corvette Summer. To start, Angela prepares bone marrow and a parsley salad, a recipe from chef Fergus Henderson's book Nose to tail eating: A Kind of British Cooking. For main, it's grilled mackerel, beetroot and red onion salad, and this meal is paired with a delicious La Perrière Pouilly-Fumé Loire by the experts at Waitrose. Josh Homme is about as rock and roll as it gets, and Nick and Ange probe him on his backstage habits and what he likes on his rider. Josh talks about his treasured 15-year friendship with the late Anthony Bourdain, and shares the hilarious comment Elton John made to him before taking to the stage for the final time in his career at Glastonbury 2023. All recipes from this podcast can be found at waitrose.com/dishrecipes A transcript for this episode can be found at waitrose.com/dish We can't all have a Michelin star chef in the kitchen, but you can ask Angela for help.

A few weeks ago, we heard a band on our “Keep On Truckin'” episode that Robert said he'd like to explore further. So, we are going to do just that! This is a Viking band straight from the deserts of Sweden... or something like that. We're talking about the most awesomely fuzzy band in the history of desert, stoner, fuzz rock: TRUCKFIGHTERS!!!What is it that we do here at InObscuria? Well, we exhume obscure Rock n' Punk n' Metal in one of 3 categories: the Lost, the Forgotten, or the Should Have Beens. This episode covers a band that is clearly in the Lost category for most. If you were too ask, “How fuzzy could this band be?”; the answer would be, “…none fuzzier!”. As always, we hope that we turn you on to something new.Songs this week include:Truckfighters – “Nitro” from Fuzzsplit Of The Century (2003)Truckfighters – “Gweedo-Weedo” from Gravity X (2005)Truckfighters – “Slacken” from Phi (2007)Truckfighters – “The New High” from Mania (2009)Truckfighters - “The Chairman” from Universe (2014)Truckfighters – “Fiend” from V (2016)Truckfighters – “Atomic” from Live In London (2016)Visit us: https://inobscuria.com/https://www.facebook.com/InObscuriahttps://twitter.com/inobscuriahttps://www.instagram.com/inobscuria/Buy cool stuff with our logo on it!: https://www.redbubble.com/people/InObscuria?asc=uCheck out Robert's amazing fire sculptures and metal workings here: http://flamewerx.com/If you'd like to check out Kevin's band THE SWEAR, take a listen on all streaming services or pick up a digital copy of their latest release here: https://theswear.bandcamp.com/If you want to hear Robert and Kevin's band from the late 90s – early 00s BIG JACK PNEUMATIC, check it out here: https://bigjackpnuematic.bandcamp.com/\n\nThis week we present another installment of our ongoing series called “Grave Mistakes: They Shoulda Been Huge!!!”. We're battling the heat here in the swampy deep south of the USA by listening to an amazing German band that would fit right in with us or in the deserts of the southwest.

Utilizing something called Family Reunification Camps, these judges order already terrified children to be forcibly removed from a protective parent's home and sent to a facility where they're isolated, abused and gaslighted into believing the abuse they just recently escaped from never happened at all and that the parent they saw beat their mom is real sorry about that. Sweet! It recently happened to the children of Josh Homme, accused abuser of his wife Brody Dalle. Homme, vocalist/guitarist of Queens of the Stone Age and drummer for Eagles of Death Metal. Though he threatned to kill his wife, among other atrocities, and despite Dalle testifying that Homme had hit the children, drove drunk with them and that they were scared to be with him, his two young sons were forcibly removed from their home and haven't seen their mom in over a year. Not shockingly, abusers who insist on having custody of their kids who are terrified of them is a power move by abusers to punish and control their partners, and not about these a-holes being any kind of decent parent. And since our criminal justice system was largely built by men to benefit men, these legalized kidnappings track. But that doesn't mean they have to continue. Thanks to the efforts of tireless advocates like Swithin, we're hoping these so-called “camps” will disappear into the ether very soon. Find Swithin at One Mom's Battle or @OneMomsBattle on Instagram or TikTok. Visit the National Safe Parents Organization to get involved or learn more.

With a wide array of sonic textures, layers, and sound design sorcery ingrained within their music, as with Kyuss, QOTSA is another prime example of a band whose albums should be listened to and enjoyed via headphones (and if we're being honest, since “this show is about honesty”, a healthy infusion of relaxers will help to further enhance this experience). It's time to realize which nationality's coitus “sounds delicious” and understand that the pain of regret from a disappointing high gravity brew rivals the pain of regret that comes from copping a squat “on your balls”. Prepare to bear witness to one of the greatest alcohol “collabs” ever imagined and discover the powerful allure of food truck fare when you JOIN US as we get outside the desert and go inside the metal with none other than QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE.

Not a band we listen to often (Damiano's style of music) but wow, we just really loved this statement and could relate. We notice when one of us feels quite stressed and anxious about work, it can be easy to ‘catch' that feeling. And it works vice versa when one of us is feeling confident about work… it's catchable. What happens when we bring awareness to this? This is what we spoke about during the episodeTaking action is the ultimate way to overcome ‘stuckness' and panic.Sometimes you need to have the confidence to just take the next step. And then everything changes.How we decide to do something is just as important as doing the thing. Detaching to the end goal can help you enjoy the journey.We need to accept our current situation in order to change it.While we're in acceptance phase, let's look at everything we've already created and achieved and be grateful for that. Our attitude towards life matters as it dictates the next steps we take.

Will anyone know what we're talking about next week?) Actually, their first order of business is talking about In Times New Roman, the just-announced new album by Queens Of The Stone Age due June 16, their first in six years (6:16). They try to sort out their current feelings about this band, and the murky personal life of Josh Homme. (They also struggle, of course, to correctly pronounce \"Homme.\")Next they talk about the end of two institutions that they sort of thought ended in the aughts, but actually shut down this week: The pop-punk band Sum 41, and the legacy media outlet MTV News. Ian actually goes to bat for Sum 41 by giving them a \"yay,\" while Steven is an indifferent \"nay\"(12:09). But MTV News was a formative outlet for both '90s kids, especially the gravitas-rich lead anchor Kurt Loder (22:11).From there they piggyback on Steven's recent column about the 10th anniversary of Daft Punk's Random Access Memories and talk about whether the album is a classic, overrated or both. (Steven and Ian both landed on \"both\") (30:18). What's not overrated is American Football buying the American Football house, which is another thing that happened this week, though the story made Ian sad about that a beloved combination A&W/Long John Silver's that is gone from his college town (46:35).In Recommendation Corner (54:10), Ian hypes the hyperpop/pop-punk hybrid Hot Mulligan, while Steven talks up a reissue from the Cleveland guitarist/composer Mark McGuire.New episodes of Indiecast drop every Friday.
