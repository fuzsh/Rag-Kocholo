        "text": "A Conversation with Mario Lalli’s Fatso Jetson\n\nFatso Jetson is an American desert rock band from Palm Desert, California, formed in 1994 by Mario Lalli, Larry Lalli, and Tony Tornay, later joined by Dino Von Lalli. Originating from Yawning Man and The Sort of Quartet, Mario and Larry Lalli teamed up with Tornay to create a new raw sound. Recognized as pioneers of the desert rock subgenre, they have influenced bands like Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age. Their music combines punk, art rock, blues, and psychedelic hard rock. Living in a remote area, the band members faced a lack of traditional venues, often playing in pool halls, after-hours restaurants, and remote desert canyons with generator power. This situation led Mario and Larry Lalli to establish Rhythm & Brews, the desert’s first rock club, which became a central venue for local and touring alternative rock and punk bands. Fatso Jetson formed here, with the members bonding over their shared love of music and late-night jam sessions. Their debut performance was in September 1994, opening for Greg Ginn of Black Flag. Ginn was impressed and released their first album, “Stinky Little Gods”, on SST Records in 1995. Following this, they toured the US with Kyuss and released their second album, “Power of Three”, in 1997. Their third album, “Toasted”, produced by Chris Goss of Masters of Reality, was released on Bongload Custom Records in 1997. Gary Arce of Yawning Man joined for a tour and contributed to the album “Flames for All” on Man’s Ruin Records. In 2002, they released “Cruel & Delicious” on Josh Homme’s Rekords Rekords label. Although their activity slowed from 2002-2007, Fatso Jetson remained active, releasing a live album in 2007 on Cobraside Records and incorporating Vince Meghrouni on saxophone and harmonica. Their 2010 album “Archaic Volumes” included Meghrouni and led to tours in Europe and the UK. Fatso Jetson continued to release music, including “Live at Maxim Festival Italy” in 2014 and “Idle Hands” in 2016 on Heavy Psych Sounds Records. They toured Europe extensively and performed at major festivals like Psycho Las Vegas and Desertfest London. In 2021, during the Los Angeles lockdowns, Fatso Jetson collaborated with Tony Tornay’s other project, All Souls, on a live studio performance, resulting in the EP “Virtual Volumes”. In 2023, they released a split EP with Dali’s Llama on Desert Records, featuring collaborations with Sean Wheeler. Fatso Jetson continues to perform and is set to be a featured artist at Ripplefest Texas, with plans for a Europe and UK tour in 2024 to support their latest releases.\n\nWhat were some of the musical influences that made you want to start making music? And what inspired you to create your desert sound?\n\nOne of my early influences was a small record collection that my sister and brother gave me when I was a child. Some of the records in the collection were by The Ventures, Jimi Hendrix, Blue Cheer, Neil Young, The Beatles, and Black Sabbath, they really inspired me to pick up the guitar and start to make music when I discovered the punk Rocks scene. There was a pretty strong scene here in the desert, very creative. We were very influenced by the punk scene in Los Angeles. Those bands Black Flag, the Minutemen, X, the Germs, Meat Puppets, Hüsker Dü and Trust, inspired me to pick up the guitar and play.\n\nIDLE HANDS by Fatso Jetson\n\nWhat was the catalyst that made you decide to turn casual jamming with Larry and Tony into a serious project and form Fatso Jetson?\n\nThe band naturally and organically evolved into something that we put some work into. We never really had a plan or a goal. We just loved to play music, and we were always around each other, so it was just a great opportunity to do that. We had a place to play every night because we had our club, and all our stuff was right there on stage. We could just play every night after work. As we wrote more songs, played shows, and recorded, it just naturally became something we put more work into.\n\nCan you describe the atmosphere at Rhythm & Brews and how it fostered creativity and collaboration among local musicians?\n\nThe atmosphere at our club was just a progression of the atmosphere at our house in La Quinta where Yawning Man started this sort of quartet FATSO JETSON we always encouraged people to come and play music and create and be creative together creating together is so much fun so we carried that over to rhythm and Bruce Encouraging local musicians to come and play the original music on our stage we loved meeting everyone and we loved encouraging them to set up. Shows something to perform an express.\n\nWhat was the recording process like for your debut album ‘Stinky Little Gods,’ and how did it feel to have your first album released on SST Records? What are your fondest memories from the recording sessions of ‘Stinky Little Gods”?\n\nThis record was recorded by a friend of ours at the club Rhythm and brews. We just recorded the band on stage and then overdub vocals and some guitar guitar things in the bar area of the club. We made the whole record at the club. It was a really fun record to make. Again we had no goal. We were just enjoying the process on SST. It was a dream come true all the most influential bands in my life came from that label. I have a great respect for SST and the music that they brought me to change my life it was an honor to record for SST.\n\nThe desert has a profound impact on your music. How does the physical and cultural landscape of the Palm Desert area influence your creative process?\n\nEarly on, the desert environment had a lot to do with changing the sound of the band, especially Across the River and Yawning Man. We began to experiment with jamming. By jamming, I mean improvising rock and vamping on a groove without any charted plan. I took this and, with Yawning Man, we would go out in the desert with our generator, full of beer, and we would just jam and play with our friends in that open, spacious environment. We just started to make music that fit that environment. It wasn’t a conscious thing; it just kind of happened that way.\n\nTouring can be both challenging and exhilarating. Can you share a particularly memorable moment from one of your tours?\n\nI absolutely love to tour. It is a dream come true. I dreamed of it all my life, and now I’m almost 60, my children are grown, and my life is simple, so I can play music. I come home and work small jobs so I can continue to be on the road playing music. But the most special experience I had was my son’s first tour with Fatso Jetson. We played in Sardinia. He was only 16. We pulled him out of high school early before the year was over so that he could make the trip, and his first show was at Duna Jam, playing on the sands. It was caught on film too; it’s on YouTube if you want to look for it. An amazing memory is me and my son climbing to the top of the dune, watching the bands play down below, and falling asleep looking at the stars. It was pretty amazing.\n\nWhat was the creative process behind your fifth album, ‘Cruel & Delicious,’ and how did working with Josh Homme’s label impact its production?\n\nCruel and Delicious was written during a creative time for Fatso Jetson. We had a house with a studio garage. My daughter was very young, and I took care of her in the evening a lot. I would sit in my chair with my acoustic guitar and write songs while she played. I wrote most of that record sitting in that chair, and I still have the acoustic guitar on which I wrote all those songs. Tony wrote some, and my cousin had many ideas to bring. It was a wonderful record to make and was also an amazing blessing for us. Josh Homme and Alain Johannes mastered the record, and it came out beautifully. I love the sound of the record, and we were very grateful to be part of Records Records.\n\nOver the years, you’ve used a variety of instruments and gear. What are some of your favorite pieces of equipment that have become staples in your sound?\n\nWell, I love my Telecaster. I’ve played it since 1993, and I love my Squier Jaguar bass. I like short-scale basses, and these basses were actually given to me for free by friends. They are very cheap, but I put a lot of love into them and customize them with pickups and special hardware. They’re great instruments, and I love them dearly as if they were very expensive instruments. I’ve tried using a Telecaster. I can’t find it as much as I used to. I had a 1960 that was my absolute favorite. It was the first guitar on the early Fatso Jetson records. I’ve used several different guitar amplifiers. I played for years with a 1980 Mesa Boogie Colosseum 300, a very powerful amplifier with 190 watts. I loved it. It reminded me of an amp like Steve Vai plays. Then I tried a Fender Twin for a while and a Fender Deville in the ’90s. I’m kind of searching for something now. I also have a 50-watt Marshall JMP from the mid-’70s that actually belongs to a friend of mine, but I’ve taken care of it for years now and keep it beautiful and well-maintained. It’s a good one. I always used an 810 bass cabinet, and we’ve gone from Ampeg SVT classics. I really love my old Acoustic 450 bass head. I’m kind of playing solid bass heads now, but if there’s ever an SVT on stage that I can use, I’ll use it. I just don’t like to carry them around anymore. They’re quite heavy, and you have to really keep them well-maintained.\n\nHow has the desert rock community evolved since you started, and what role do you think Fatso Jetson has played in that evolution?\n\nWell, I think the desert rock community and people that relate to this categorization. You know, we have played over the last few years at many of the Desert Fests in Europe, and I know that this is somehow directly related to our music scene here at home in Southern California in the Coachella Valley. So, it’s pretty amazing to me, and I always feel a bit of honor when representing and grateful for the relevance and the acknowledgment. Fatso Jetson has always just done what we do, and we’re just grateful that people hear the music. We’ve always been grateful to all the guys from Kyuss for always mentioning us and helping us along the way. Brant, Josh, all of them have always helped us.\n\nHaving family members in the band might be both challenging. How do you navigate the dynamics of working so closely with your cousin Larry and son Dino?\n\nOh, it’s an absolute joy. Back in the old days, my cousin and I lived together, drank together, and played music together. We had our spats once in a while, but we’ve always been best friends and always played music together. My cousin has a family of his own and a career as a chef, but he still comes anytime he can to play with us, whether on tour or just a gig in the desert. My son is so dedicated, and he is teaching me all the time how to be a better musician and also to stay creative and focused. I love playing with my family. It’s a very important thing to me.\n\nCan you give us a sneak peek into any future projects or collaborations that Fatso Jetson is currently working on?\n\nWe have a few things we’re working on. I have been working on a collaboration for a while now with an English band, the Sons of Alpha Centauri. We exchange tracks back and forth. They send me rhythm tracks; I sing and play guitar. This will be a collaboration between their band and Fatso Jetson. My son will also put some guitar tracks on it, and we’ll see how it comes out. Right now, I’m pretty excited. It sounds really cool. We are writing music slowly but surely for our next record, which will come out early next year. I’ve been quite busy playing bass for Brant Björk, and we also recorded a new record, which is coming out soon. My band lives in Los Angeles, and me, Herb Lineau, our guitar player/bass player, and my son live here in the desert, so rehearsal is a bit difficult. Things take us a bit longer, but we’re excited about it. We play all the time, but writing the new material and getting it rehearsed in the band has been a little bit slow because of the distance.\n\nI’ll also be hitting the road early next year with Sean Wheeler. We are working on a duo, and I’m also working on a duo with my son called El Padre El Don.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Fatso Jetson"
