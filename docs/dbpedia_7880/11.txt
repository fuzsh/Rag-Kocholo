With his villainous croon and heaven-sent knack for riffs, the singer, guitarist, songwriter and producer Josh Homme has been a vital force in hard rock over the past three decades. A central figure of the Palm Desert Scene that carried the torch for Sabbathy proto-metal in the late ’80 and ’90s, he broke through in stoner-rock heroes Kyuss before joining Screaming Trees as a guitarist. He founded his flagship band, Queens of the Stone Age, in 1996, and has steered the group through shifting lineups and essential LPs including 2002’s ‘Songs for the Deaf.’ An antidote to the undiluted revivalism of much 21st-century rock, QOTSA has been a strong and welcome argument that the ‘rock era’ might not be over. For his part, Homme is able to invoke hard rock’s past — a Jack Bruce falsetto here; a Tony Iommi guitar phrase there — within darkly original songs that are both adrenaline-soaked and insidious. Along the way he’s proven a dutiful producer and collaborator as well, collecting famous friends for his Desert Sessions project, forming the fun, ass-kicking combo Eagles of Death Metal with his pal Jesse Hughes, and taking part in one of the great rock supergroups in recent memory, Them Crooked Vultures, alongside John Paul Jones and Dave Grohl.
