        "text": "Kaidala and Maralu Basaweshwara Temple\n\nSeptember 8, 2010\n\nAfter my trip to chennai, I was itching to hit the road again, as my trip to chennai was confined only to the hotel room and a few trips to marina beach and elliot’s beach, along with a visit to St Thomas Basilica. The weather in chennai made it difficult to go out.\n\nMy friend had told me about an old temple which was covered by TV9 , and it could be covered in one day. Since it was in gubbi , we also decided to cover kaidala.\n\nWe began our journey in search of the temple after picking my friends and headed towards the crowded tumkur road. An hour of driving took us to kamat upachar on the outskirts of tumkur. After a sumptuous breakfast, the actual search for the temple began. We first inquired at the petrol bunk, however we werent able to get a correct location. We were asked to go to gubbi road and inquire there.\n\nProceeding further we took the gubbi road as directed, and after driving for a short distance we again asked for directions, this time we could get a more concrete answer. We were asked to go straight without turning anywhere, the road would lead us to a circle, after taking left we were asked to inquire there. While going towards the circle, we found the deviation to kaidala, however we decided to see this while coming back.\n\nUpon reaching the circle, we stopped to inquire about the temple again. Now we were told to proceed straight for another 10kms, then take a left turn and inquire there. With not much options left we continued. It was almost 3-31/2 hours since we started our journey and there was still no sign of the temple. We stopped near a lake for a break and to take some snaps\n\nLake\n\nContinuing on, for a few more kms, we found some paddy fields. This called for another stop and another photoshoot\n\nGreen Paddy Fields\n\nAfter a couple of kms with the road leading to nowhere we stopped to check for directions again. We were in for a shock when we heard we had come 12kms ahead. We were asked to go back 10kms and take a left to chelur and proceed for another 25kms. The temple is located within chelur town limits.\n\nSince there was no other option, turning the car around, we headed back and after 10kms we approached the marker which showed chelur to be 25kms.Turning left, we continued along the road, only to find that there is no road in most of the places. With huge craters everywhere, driving was becoming problematic. With reduced speeds, we kept moving and after an hour of doing some off roading 🙂 we managed to reach chelur limits. The temple is present at a short distance after taking an immediate left near the circle.\n\nThe clock was showing 1pm when we reached the temple. I was expecting a temple like those present in belur or halebid. However the temple is quite small and devoid of any sculptures.\n\nMaralu Basaweshwara Temple\n\nAs it was afternoon the temple was closed. There is a pool next to the temple and a cave well a few feet away from the temple. There is a saying that if the water in the temple dries out completely, mankind would cease to exist. (Dont know how far this is true, but looking at the water level, one can assume it coincides with the mayan prophecy of the end of days in 2012 🙂 🙂 )\n\nLake near temple\n\nSteps leading to the base of the cave well\n\nAs the temple was closed we had nothing much to do. Taking a few snaps of the temple complex, we headed back to kaidala. Return was through the same road and after an hour of arduous driving, we hit the highway, and after a short while we reached kaidala\n\nThe temple lacks the grandeur like those present in belur/somanthpur. However the main attraction is the chennakeshva statue present in the temple.\n\nAfter a short darshan, we headed back to bangalore, thus concluding an interesting trip\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSnaps can be found here\n\nDeepambudhi Lake/Marconahalli Dam\n\nJuly 25, 2010\n\nA visit to a couple of dam’s, a lake along with a overcast sky is ideal setting to get away from the maddening crowds and the daily city life. Throw in a ruined church and a couple of monuments, it becomes a perfect reciepe to spend the weekend. This is what I was planning to do over the course of the weekend.\n\nBrowsing the net in search of places that could be covered in a weekend, I chanced upon a rather deepambudhi lake which is in huliyurdurga and markonhalli dam located on the banks of simsha river in yediur. The lake was in pristine condition . I decided to visit the lake and dam. After checking a few more places that could be visited, I found a ruined church in shettihalli , which attracts hordes of visitors and gorur and yagachi dam’s could be covered in 2 days along with the famous belur and halebid temples.\n\nWith the places shortlisted, I decided head out on sat morning. Left bangalore at 7 at reached nelamangala. Refilled at a petrol bunk and reached the nelamangala bypass in a short while as there was less traffic. Took the left turn, to hassan and was cruising along.\n\nRoads are being relaid, across the entire stretch, from nelamangala bypass till hassan, on both sides. Riding for another hour or so, I reached kunigal by 9.30 and asked for directions from locals. I was told that I had taken the longer route , as there is another route which one can take from magadi road as It leads directly to lake.\n\nI was told to go a little further and take the left at the circle and go another 20kms before taking another right near the Indian Oil petrol bunk. Another 4-5 kms of travel in huliyurdurga state forest would lead me to the lake.\n\nScenary on the outskirts of kunigal\n\nThe roads improve dramatically once we leave kunigal bypass. It was a real joy driving on those roads, as there were no potholes and traffic was sparse.\n\nBeautiful Roads\n\nAfter a short while I reached the petrol bunk and took the left, at the sign boards and entered huliyurdurga forest. The winding roads gives u a feeling of driving in the ‘GHATS’.\n\nRiding on those twisty roads, I could see the lake in front of me. There is also an arch which goes to marikamba temple. One can park their vechile after taking a left at the arch or at the temple go to the lake.\n\nDeepambudhi Lake\n\nThe lake is clean and there is no garbage being thrown, which is suprising. The place is also teaming with a variety of birds and is a ideal place for bird watching.\n\nA few shots of the lake\n\nI spent some time at lake relaxing and taking snaps before leaving the place.\n\nNote: Apart from visiting the lake, one can also visit kunigal stud farm owned by vijay mallya, huliyurdurga state forest or one can trek to huliyurdurga hill which is located closeby.\n\nAfter finishing my visit to deepambudhi lake, my next place on the list was marconhalli dam. Reaching kunigal bypass, I again asked for directions.\n\nTo reach marconhalli dam, travel 16 kms from kunigal. After 16kms one can see kstdc hotel on the right, take the road going to the left and proceed 5 kms to the dam.\n\nView near the dam\n\nEntry to the dam is restricted and photography inside for security reasons. However one can spend some time taking snaps on the outskirts of the dam, and visiting the climate stattion\n\nThere wasnt much to do at the dam, so I headed back, stopped briefly at another spot near the river before heading back to the kstdc hotel\n\nScenic view near the river\n\nDark clouds began to gather, as I reached the hotel. To go to shettihalli , I was told to go to chennarayanapatna which is 60kms from the hotel, and ask for directions. With more dark clouds gathering, I decided to head back to bangalore, as the chances of rain was imminent. Reached nelamanagala around 4 and had a late lunch before reaching my house at 5, thus concluding another wonderful trip\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSnaps can be found here\n\n13.020260 77.021347\n\nSerenity ride- sakleshpur-somwarpet-madikeri\n\nJune 25, 2010\n\nMy tryst with cycling started last year, when i was looking to do something else apart from trekking every weekend and I decided to venture into cycling to see how the experience would be. I had chanced upon CAM’s website(cyclingandmore.com), however, i wasnt sure whether they would give cycles for hire. Buying a cycle was ruled out as my dad was against buying one.\n\nMy friend recently sent me a link which showed CAM organizing a ride from sakleshpur to madikeri. I checked the registration page and saw that bikes could be rented. I immediately signed up for the ride. After a few mails with shreeharsha, i met harsha near my office and payed him the cash. The next part was to get a bike to ride, as i was ride a cycle after a gap of 9 years. Harsha told me that cycles could be rented from wheel sports. After getting the address, i went on the first weekend of june, to get a merida for rent.\n\nAfter getting the hang of the gears, i cycled back home, and spent the rest of sat and sun, riding around, so that i could get more comfortable with the cycle and gears. By the end of sun, I was confident of the gears, and knew I wouldnt have to struggle when the actual ride starts.\n\nFinally, on 25th night, after getting the mail from CAM, regarding the starting point, i headed to the hockey stadium, to meet my fellow cyclists and head to sakleshpur for an action packed weekend\n\nThe group was a mix of expert riders and beginners like me. After a round of introductions, we headed to the bus to begin the long ride to sakleshpur.\n\nThe peleton\n\nDay 1\n\nWe reached sakleshpur, by 5 in the morning and checked into a lodge to freshen up. Soon, everyone we ready, and the bikes were taken out from the canters, and were inspected for any faults. Those who had opted for rented bikes, were given the bikes, and were asked to ride it to see if they were comfortable\n\nAt 6.15 everyone were ready were ready with their bikes , and we headed off towards manjarabad fort, from where we would take a deviation and head towards somwarpet\n\nAll set for the long ride\n\nThe weather was cloudy, and it was raining intermittently. Cycling in this misty weather was even more fun. People on the streets were suprised to see 30+ people on cycles riding together. As the ride progressed, some of the people and the kids began waving at us.\n\nDark clouds at the start of the ride\n\nThere were a few ascents, which was done easily, as everyone where in good spirits. Taking a deviation near manjarabad fort, we headed towards the ghats of somwarpet. With short breaks, for taking snaps and taking a breather from cycling, we proceeded further. Some of the guys, who were used to cycling, zoomed ahead, ,while the rest, took it easy. Our breakfast point was at sukravarasante which was 13kms from manjarabad fort. With the terrain being relatively flat, with a relatively few ascents and descents, we reached the breakfast point by 7.30 after an hour or so of cycling.\n\nLush greenary\n\nThe support vehicles also reached, the spot, and we soon had the idly-vadas which were parceled for all of us. Breakfast was followed by a round of coffee and after a short rest, we were back on the saddle for the next leg of the tour\n\nThe terrain soon changed, and there were quite a few ascents. Peddling in those ascents was quite tough and everyone, had to peddle quite slowly, as there still quite a long way to go. With the scenery improving at every turn, the cyclists continued their journey. There were a couple of ascents which was really steep. I was really finding it difficult to continue peddling on those steep climbs. After taking breaks , the climb was managable.\n\nThe ride continues\n\nA few more hours of cycling took us to to sanivarsante via kodlipet. It was 10 in the morning and we still had another 14kms to go before we reach somawarpet. The stretch from kodlipet to somwarpet is a continous ascent, and my legs were already feeling the stress. Some of the kids, asked us whether we had cycled all the way from bangalore 🙂\n\nThe support vehicles were just a phone call away, and they were used effectively when water was running low or for other purposes. The initial plan was to reach somwarpet by 12 noon and after having lunch, the expert riders would cycle till the base of pushpagiri and return back.\n\nCycling the last 8 kms, was proving to be really difficult as the ascent was quite steep. With my thighs ‘screaming for mercy’, i decided to walk a couple of kms and then cycle for remaining few kms\n\n8 More to go\n\nThe ascent\n\nFinally at 1 in the afternoon, I reached somwarpet. We were given instructions during breakfast to proceed to hotel aloka where lunch was arranged.\n\nWith lunch completed, a few of us headed to hotel suvidha, where our accomodation was booked. After parking the cycles in the cellar, we went to our respective rooms, while the experts, got ready to go to pushpagiri.\n\nWith the easy ride !!! over, it was time to catch up on some sleep before dinner. Dinner was again at aloka and after finishing dinner, we hit the sack as we had to get up early in the morning\n\nRoute for Day 1\n\nSakleshpur-Manjarabad-Shukravarasante-kodlipet->Sanivarasante-Somwarpet\n\nDay 2\n\nThis would be the last day of the tour and the route planned was relatively easy. We started early by 6.30 from somwarpet.\n\nEarly morning in somwarpet\n\nStarting the ride from somwarpet\n\nAfter the inital ascent, we had a few spectacular descents. In addition to the descant, the scenary was simply mesmarizing. All the riders seemed to be enjoying the scenary as they zipped downhill.\n\nAmazing scenary\n\nAs it was the last day, people were taking it easy, and posing for snaps. After a couple of photo sessions and a bit more of cycling, we reached madapur, where we had our breakfast.\n\nWe had another 5 more kms to go before we concluded the tour. The last 5 kms would take us to hattihole and the expert riders would carry on till madikeri. Post breakfast, the support vehicles moved out, while the cyclists started their last leg of the tour. The route was generally downhill, and within no time we were in hattihole.\n\nThe easy ride concluded here, and the experts continued uphill. Instead of sitting idle, i suggest, to dixitha and others that we head to a hanging bridge which was located 5 kms from hattiihole bridge\n\nThere is a hanging bridge near the hattihole river which can be accessed by foot. Myself, dixitha and other guy cycled to the bridge. After peddling for half hour we reached the bridge. The bridge is constructed accross the hattihole river, which allows ppl to cross the river easily. Having spent some time on the bridge, and taking a few snaps, we headed back.\n\nAfter freshning up, we waited for the other riders to return back. The bikes were back on the canters and we headed back to bangalore.\n\nThe rest of the journey was spent playing dumb sharats and other games. We reached bangalore by 8. After bidding goodbye’s to each other we headed back to our homes, thus concluding an amazing weekend.\n\nRoute for Day 2\n\nSomwarpet-Madapur-hattihole-madikeri\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nPics can be found here\n\nSnaps from Manohar’s cam\n\nSnaps from vishy’s cam\n\nSnaps from nithin’s cam\n\nSnaps from Sathish cam\n\nCoastal Karnataka\n\nApril 7, 2010\n\nPlanning for a trip during long weekends is always a problem.Treks were ruled out due to summer and i was searching for other places to go. With hill stations such as kodaikanal charging twice the normal rate, owing to the holiday season, I was running out of places go visit. Finally after a lot of searching , i zeroed in on the beaches of uttara karnataka even though the weather would be hot and humid.\n\nSrikanth as usual decided to join and I managed to convince kiran to tag along. Kiran said he would bring his friend along. I had asked him to book the tickets to sirsi and return tickets from udupi, so that we could cover a few beaches along the coast.\n\nDay 1\n\nWith the booking done, we boarded the bus to sirsi on thursday @ 10.30 pm.After a long journey, we reached sirsi at 8 in the morning. We took a room which was run by the marikamba temple trust to freshen up. Upon finding the tap in the room wasnt working, we had to use the public toilet to finsh our morning abulations. Once everyone were ready, we checked out and headed to the bus stand to catch a bus to yana.\n\nWe were informed that there werent any buses to yana, and we had to look for local transport. After a lot of negotiations, we took a local car to yana, which would be the first place we would visit. With the sun climbing up, we began our journey to yana and we reached there at 11.30.\n\nYana is a important piligrimage center. The two monolithic rock formations called bhiravashikara and mohinishikara which is of 200 ft and 120ft are the main tourist attractions in yana. Other popular activities including trekking, bird watching and rock climbing.\n\nBhiravashikara\n\nAfter visiting the temple, we went inside the cave to have a look. Steps are being built to the cave and a passage way is made inside the cave, which allows people to explore the cave.\n\nInside Bhiravashikara\n\nOne can exit the cave from the back or through the same route. Walking on the hot gravel can be tricky if we exit the cave from behind as we have to remove our slippers before entering the cave. coming out of the cave, we could see mohinishikara at a distance and we decided to head towards it\n\nMohinishikara\n\nHaving spent some time taking photos and exploring the surroundings, we headed back to the vehicle and to gokarana.\n\nWe took a short break at a view point in devimane ghat before continuing our journey.\n\nView from devimane ghat\n\nHaving reached gokarna at 3 we headed to a hotel for lunch and then to om beach.\n\nGokarana is a small temple town which is famous for its beaches. Go-karna, means ‘cow’s ears’ in Sanskrit. According to legends, Lord Shiva emerged from a cow’s ear and so the name. It is located at the meeting point of the two rivers Gangavali and Agnashini, which is shaped like an ear.\n\nOm Beach Gokarana\n\nLush green surroundings enroute to om beach\n\nWith the heat becoming unbearable, me, kiran and his friend headed to the sea for a dip. The driver had asked us to come back at 5.30 so that we could go to paradise beach which is located behind the gokarna temple.\n\nWe spent some time lazing in the water, before heading to paradise beach. Kiran and srikanth went to the temple, while i took a stroll on the beach, looking for an ideal spot to shoot the sunset.\n\nWith the sun already setting, we had a small photo session, with everyone giving their best poses for the camera.\n\nSunset at Paradise Beach\n\nWith the sun set, we asked the driver to drop us to gokarana bus stand, so that we could catch a bus to kumta. We paid the driver the agreed amount. The bus to kumta soon arrived and we reached kumta at 9.30 at night. After checking into the hotel we headed for dinner and we hit the bed, thus concluding the first day of sight seeing\n\nDay 2\n\nWhile having dinner, we had asked the hotel guy to tell us places which we can see in kumta. He told us bada beach is the closest, which we could visit. The next morning, we headed to bada beach which was located around 10kms from the hotel. The beach was pretty desolated as it was already 8 in the morning, and the humidity was increasing.\n\nBada Beach\n\nWe took a stroll on the beach, and spent some time taking photos, before heading back to the bus stand. After a short wait, we got the bus and went back to hotel. After a quick shower, we checked out and headed to honnavar and then to murudeshwara.\n\nI had read about an ancient chennakeshava temple built during the hoysala reign located in honnavar and i was interested in seeing it, however upon reaching the bus stand, the auto driver told us we had to get down before the bus stand at a place called harki. He offered us to drop us till there. When he inquired as to why we wanted to go to harki, we told him the purpose of our visit. He told us there is no such temple and instead told to go to murudeshwara.\n\nThe following link shows the location of the temple in honnavar.\n\nAs we werent sure of the location, we asked the auto guy to drop us to the bus stand, where we took the bus to murudeshwara, which we soon reached after half an hour.\n\nMurudeshwara located close to honnavar is a famous piligrimage and tourist location. The 70ft statue of lord shiva is the main attraction here. Apart from visiting the temple one can also play in the sea which is located next to the temple and indulge in some water sports such as jetskiing which we did.\n\nShiva Statue in Murudeshwara\n\nMurudeshwara Beach\n\nAfter finishing the water sports, we had lunch before heading to marvante. We reached marvante by sundown and we waited for the sun to set, so that we could start another sunset shoot.\n\nSunset at marvante beach\n\nThe sun soon set, and kiran told me he would show me the place where we can see the sea on one side and the river on the other.\n\nMarvante\n\nMarvante river on the opp side of the beach\n\nWe headed back to the bus stand, and took a bus to kundapur. After checking into the hotel, we headed to the hotel for dinner and then it was nap time.\n\nDay3\n\nThis would be the last day of our trip, and we were wondering where to go. Initially we thought of covering st mary’s island and a few less frequented beaches around udupi, but since we were visiting beaches for the past two days, we thought of going to some place else. Srikanth however insisted, we sleep till evening, in the hotel and catch a bus to udupi, before heading back to bangalore\n\nAfter much haggling, we decided to go to karkala and moodabidri, which has important places of worship for jains. Moodabidri has a 1000 pillar temple, which none of us had seen.\n\nWith the plan set , we checked out and took a bus to udupi. After reaching udupi, kiran suddenly said, he wanted to go to st mary’s island, as he had visited it a long time back and wanted to visit again. With the destination changed at the last moment, we had to agree to go to st mary’s island.\n\nWe took a bus to malpe beach and bought tickets to the ferry which takes people to the island.\n\nSt mary’s island is an uninhabited island situated near malpe. The island is famous for the basalt rock formations which occurs in various forms.\n\nSt mary’s island\n\nWhile srikanth and kiran’s friend were relaxing and trying to take snaps of an eagle floating above, me and kiran went around exploring the island. The island’s rock formations allows one to climb over the rocks thus giving a panaromic view of the island. Jumping across rocks we went round the island.\n\nA few snaps of st mary’s island\n\nHaving explored the island, we headed back to the ferry and back to dry land. We spent the remaining time roaming around udupi, and we paid a visit to the krishna temple in the evening. After having dinner at woodland’s resturant, we boarded the bus to bangalore.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSnaps can be found here\n\nKarnataka Heritage Tour\n\nFebruary 26, 2010\n\nWith my trip to malaysia done, I returned to India on the 13th feb. However while I was in KL, I was having having a discussions with my friend, on a trip after coming back !!!. I was granted leave on 19th and with my friend also taking leave, the only thing pending was the place. Having checked team-bhp we still couldnt figure out the places.\n\nI had told my friend we could go by car , however that wasnt the case, as my dad refused to give the car :(. This however turned out to be a blessing in disguise. We booked the north karnataka heritage package tour conducted by KSTDC. The schedule was ideal for us as the tour dates was fri-sat-sun.\n\nI met my friends srikanth and subbu krishna on thur night at badami house at 9.30. We boarded the bus at 10 and headed to hampi. After a brief stop in between we reached the ksrtc’s hotel mayura around 6.30. We were allotted rooms and after freshing up, we headed back to the bus, to begin our journey to hampi. We were introduced to the guide who did a wonderful job of explaining the facts and history of hampi.\n\nDay 1\n\nThe first stop was at sasuvekal ganesha or mustard ganesha which we saw from the bus. After that we proceeded to see kadlekal ganesha or groundnut ganesha. Historical records indicate that a merchant had earned a lot of money by selling mustard and groundnuts. Since he intended to build a temple dedicate to ganesha, he donted a large part of his earning to the king, hence the name has stuck.\n\nKadlekal Ganesha\n\nAfter seeing the ganesha we procedded to hemakuta which was located a short distance from hemakuta. The place contains some old temples. Since the place provided a ideal place to take some good shots, a small photoshoot was conducted there and then we proceeded to virupakshaw temple. To use camera one has to pay Rs 25. Since there was nothing interesting to take snaps, hence we just had a look at the diety. The guide also explained that the from 6 am to 6 pm one can see the inverted image of the temple gopura. No one is still able to explain how this occurs.\n\nHemakuta\n\nBy the time we finished came out of virupakshaw temple it was already 11 and the sun was beating down hard on us. Our next stop was the famous lakshmi narasimha statue and the badavilinga statue.\n\nLakshmi Narasimha Statue\n\nAfter seeing both these , we headed for lunch which took approx an hour to complete. After lunch we were on our final leg of hampi tour, we visited the lotus mahal, elephant stable and few other important places such as stepped tank, sister stones.\n\nLotus Mahal, Elephant Stable, Stepped Tank\n\nWe then approached the main attraction of hampi, the stone chariot and vijaya vittala temple. There are musical pillars in the temple, however we are not allowed to touch it. The guide showed us the location of the musical pillars.\n\nStone Chariot\n\nWe took a few pics of the stone chariot and we bid adieu to hampi and boarded the bus to go back to the hotel.\n\nTungabhadra Dam is very close to the hotel and me, srikanth and subbu krishna went there in the evening as we wanted to see the sunset. The bus ride to the top takes around 10 min and charges are Rs 20. Since we reached the top early, we spent some time roaming around waiting for the sun to go down. The actual sunset began aroung 6.15. With the sun going down slowly, the sky was illuminated with various colors. We were busy capturing the sunset with our cameras.\n\nSunset @ TB Dam\n\nAfter seeing the sunset we headed back to the base of the dam and to the musical fountain. Spending some time in the garden we got back to the hotel and after having dinner we hit the sack as we had to get up early the next day\n\nDay 2\n\nWe proceeded from hampi at 5.30 in the morning to the caves temples of badami. Stopping for a short while for breakfast, we reached badami.\n\nThe cave temples of badami are all carved of the mountain. The temples are dedicated to shiva, vishnu and mahavira. As per the guide the all statues are made of sandstone. We spent some time there before moving to pattadakal where the kings coronation cermany used to take place.\n\nCarvings in Badami\n\npattadakal has some impressive temples which were built by the chalukyas between 3rd and 6th centuries. As per the guide the lower the temple is on the ground the more ancient it is. We spent an hour in pattadakal listening to the guide as he explained the history of the various temples. Pattadakal was an expiremenation area used the sculptures. The temples are a mix of north and south indian architecture.\n\nTemples in Pattadakal\n\nWe moved to aihole which is also called the birth place of south indian architecture, and this would be our last place we would visit for the day. The guide explained there are more than 150 temples around aihole, however many of them have collapsed. Only very few temples are standing till today.\n\nWe saw the architectural marvals in aihole and shot plenty of snaps. The tour operator announced that we lodging would be at bijapur which was 3 hrs from aihole. With a short break for cuppa, we headed to bijapur and reached there at 8 at night. After having lunch in kamat we retired for the day\n\nAihole\n\nDay 3\n\nWith only bijapur sightseeing and a visit to kudalasangama scheduled for the day, we woke up leisurely and headed to gol gumbaz.\n\nThose interested to use the camera inside the gombaz had to pay the fees which me and srikanth did. We were explained the architectural style of the perisans and the arch pillar method of archtitecture developed by the persians. Inside the gombaz one can find the tombs of adil shah and his family.\n\nGol Gumbaz\n\nThe guide showed us the various sounds that could be generated inside the gombaz. We were also showed the place where we could get some good shots of the gombaz, which wes used well. We then moved to ibrahim roza. The roza is a mouseleum built by Adil Shah II in memory of his wife. Unfortunately the king died before his wife, and he was buried here, hence the name.\n\nThe tomb is a mix of Indo-Persian architecture and is a source of inspiration for building the Taj Mahal. A tour inside and we were off to big canyon located inside the bijapur fort.\n\nIbrahim Roza\n\nThe canyon is one the largest canyon ever constructed and it was built by hand. The guide told us the canyon had the capacity to destory a city in those days. Also beneath the canon , one can find the carvings of half and full moon, indicating that both hindus and muslims served in the army.\n\nBig Canyon\n\nThe canyon marked the end of the bijapur trip. We headed to koodlasangama, the place which was chosen by basavanna. We saw the dhayana mantapa. Apart from the dhanyanamantapa and the river there is nothing much to see here. Those who were intersted in taking group snaps, were allowed to take, and the rest took a break from the sun, and had a few cool drinks.\n\nWe saw a couple more places enroute and then headed back to hospet for dinner and then back to bangalore.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSnaps can be foundhere\n\nLess Known Hosyala Temples\n\nDecember 7, 2009\n\nAfter a hectic week of working in the night due to client requirements , I got some much needed rest on Friday when my team lead said i need not come to office in the evening. I finished the remaining work from home while searching for a few places to visit on the weekend.\n\nWhile browsing aravind’s blog I came upon a few less known hosyala temple’s near Mysore which could be covered in a single day. I was initially planning on covering these during dussera but couldn’t due to time issues. Now that I had ample time I set out to cover these places as I had missed them during my earlier trip. I had taken the directions from aravind before and I just cross checked them with my uncle before heading out\n\nApart from Belur, Halebid and Kesava temple in somanthpur , the Hosyala’s have built other temples around Mysore which are not aware to many people. Some of the other temples built by hosyala’s are\n\nSri Lakshminarayanaswamy temple in Hosaholalu\n\nSri Bramheshwaraswamy temple in Kikkeri\n\nSri Panchalingeshwaraswamy temple in Govindahalli\n\nAll these temples are within 15-20 kms from each other which makes it ideal for a one day visit along with belur halebid and sravanabelogla\n\nI set out on sat morning around 9 towards panadavapura on my brother’s bike. Cruising at good speeds I reached pandavapura around 10.30. From Pandavapura I had to travel to KR Pet which is 30 kms.\n\nI reached KR Pet in around 45 min and asked for directions to hosholalu. Hosaholalu is 2 kms from KR Pet was my first destination. There is a sign board showing the route to the temple once you reach hosholalu.\n\nLakshminarayanaswamy Temple\n\nThe temple is built on the similar lines of kesava and halebid temples i.e on a star shaped stone. The temple is surrounded houses and is well maintained by the ASI.\n\nThis temple has 3 shines and is called as a trikuta temple as explained by the priest present in the temple. However he seemed to know very little about the temple and there were no guides around\n\nA structure is built in front of the temple which spoils its beauty\n\nAfter spending some time clicking snaps I headed out to kikkeri which is 15 kms from KR Pet. Upon reaching kikkeri i asked a few people directions to the temple and i was surprised to see people didn’t know about the temple. One of them asked to go to the town and inquire. I asked a person at the tea shop and he gave me the directions to the temple.\n\nBramheshwara Swamy Temple Entrance\n\nThe temple is situated next to a lake which is present near the town. There is a sign board one of the walls of a house advertising the presence of the temple\n\nLake near temple\n\nThe temple is not fully completed as some of the sculptures are not fully finished. The temple was closed by the time I reached there. I could however get inside the temple as parts of the wall has collapsed.\n\nBramheshwara Swamy Temple\n\nThough the temple represents a fine piece of hosayala art , it is sad to see the temple is being neglected by the local people. Luckily there is no physical damage done to the temple\n\nMy final destination was govindahalli which is 5 kms from kikkeri. There is a rock slab just a few meters from kikkeri police station showing the direction to panchalingeshwara temple.\n\nThe temple is located amidst fields and has an air of freshness around it.\n\nPanchalingeshwara Temple\n\nThe temple was closed when i visited, however an old lady near the temple gave me some info regarding the temple. The temple is huge and it has 5 sanctums for 5 shiv lings. Shiv lings are named as Tatpurusheshwara, Aghoreshwara, Sadyojateshwara,Ishanyeshwara and Vamadeveshwara .\n\nThe 5 santums\n\nA nandi statue is present for each of the 5 shiv lings. While Aghoreshwara and Vamadeveshwara have their nandi statues outside , the nandi statues for Ishanyeshwara, Tatpurusheshwara and Sadyojateshwara are present inside the temple\n\nNandi Statue\n\nThe sculptures are missing from a few places in the temple. Theft might be a likely explanation.\n\nI had finished seeing all these temples and I still had enough time to get back to Bangalore. Sravanabelagola is just 11 kms from kikkeri and I was thinking of covering even that and then head to belur and halebid which was just 90 kms.\n\nI however decided to cover these at a later date and moved to srirangapatna which around 50kms from kikkeri.\n\nI reached srirangapatna at 3 and headed to dariya daulat which was tippu’s summer palace.\n\nDariya Daulat\n\nPhotography is allowed only outside the palace. The place houses paintings of srirangapatna during its fall along with the guns and other artifacts of tippu’s era\n\nGuns used during Tippu’s Reign\n\nAfter visiting dariya daulat I then visited gumbaz which contains the bodies of tippu and his family.\n\nGumbaz\n\nAfter seeing gumbaz , left to see the remaining places in srirangaptna namely , colonel bailley’s dungeon , jumma masjid and rangathaswamy temple before heading to Mysore\n\nCanon at colonel bailley’s dungeon\n\nI spent the evening visiting the palace and relaxing\n\nThe next day i headed out to KRS and I wanted to see the venugopalaswamy temple which was recently renovated. I had visited the temple last year and the renovation was still under progress. The temple is located at the KRS backwaters.\n\nBrindavan Gardens\n\nLot of things had changed in one year and due to some new construction being done I could not locate the place. Had to return home empty handed :(. I had taken a few snaps from my earlier visit\n\nI left KRS and reached home at 3.30 in the afternoon.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSnaps can be found here\n\n12.495304 76.674697\n\nManchinbele Dam\n\nNovember 3, 2009\n\nManchinbele Dam is a dam built on the river arkavati. This place is ideal for a day outing, though not much can be done here except play in the river , however the view of the dam from the top is really mesmerizing. This place is full of birds and is an ideal spot for bird watching along with TG halli reservoir which is a few kms away from manchinbele\n\nWhile chatting with my friend in office , he suggested we go for a sunset photoshoot in manchinbele on sunday. Since I had nothing to do on sunday I immediately agreed as I wanted to visit this place , after reading so many blogs , however the visit could not materialize due to some reason or the other. Now that the plan was finalized , I was determined to go there.\n\nI left for manchinbele at 3 in the afternoon along with two of my friends. We reached Rajarajeshwari medical college and took the right next to the college. We were crusing along and we reached Big Banyan Tree in an hour or so. After a small break and we proceeded to the dam. After negotiating a bad stretch of road we could see the backwaters of the dam. We had a small photo session from the top, as the view was fabulous.\n\nManchinbele Dam\n\nThe sun had hid itself behind the clouds , and a lonely tree near the banks of the dam , provided an ideal view to experiment with different compositions. We tried various composition techniques and moved on.\n\nLonely Tree\n\nWe could see a lot of people near the bank , while some were playing in the water others were drinking , others were cooking food, and as usual they were littering the place.\n\nCloud Patterns\n\nThe sun was playing hide and seek with the clouds , and the patterns in the clouds along with the cloud cover provided us with a good view of the sunset. We took quite a few snaps in various angles before heading back.\n\nCelestial Sunset\n\nA Fiery Sunset\n\nWe found a good view point when coming back , which was utilized well by taking a few shots of the backwaters and the evening sky. We headed back to bangalore after having a cuppa in one of the hotels near Big Banyan Tree.\n\nTwilight at Manchinebele\n\nView of manchinbele just after sunset\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSnaps can be found here\n\n12.993823 77.494283\n\nA drive without destination\n\nOctober 29, 2009\n\nAfter completing my solo trip to mysore I was hoping to continue to do some more of these trips the following week. Thus I began to discuss with my friend the possibilities of a 2 day outing. With karnataka gripped in floods choosing a destination was becoming increasingly difficult. Initially we had thought of doing agumbe-sringeri route however that had to be abandoned due to heavy rains. I was keeping an eye on the weather reports as i taking the car out in rain would be impossible. The deliberations continued as we touched upon waynad, ooty masinagudi etc. With all my friends dropping out, me and my friend were in a fix as to what has to be done. As covering waynad would be a costly affair for 2 ppl.Luckly one of my other friend said he would join at the last moment. With 3 ppl , we had tentatively decided to go to chitradurga to see the fort. This was not meant to happen as the place was flooded. With dad not allowing me to take the car for an overnight trip , i was left to plan for a 1 day drive.\n\nBoth my friends hadnt seen bluff so we decided to go there finally. We left bangalore at 7 in the morning and we halted in kengeri for a small cuppa where the other guy joined us. With less trafiic on mysore road and with speeds of 70-80kms we reached maddur by 9 and we took a deviation to mallavalli. Another 45 min later we reached gaganchucki falls. A small photosession was conducted there, after spending some time there we headed to bharchucki falls. Since there were less ppl there as we reached there at 11 we managed to get a good view of the falls.\n\nWith both the fallls completed by 11.30 we were wondering what to do next. I wasnt in a mood to go home so early. Since mysore was nearby we decided to go there for lunch and then decide what has to be done next. With a newly laid bannur road, we were crusing and we reached mysore at 1 in the afternoon. Lunch was a dasprakash hotel. With out tummies full and with enough time to spare, we were debating on whether to drive up to chamundi hill or spend some time in gosai ghat in srirangapatna.\n\nThe next 2 hrs as spent at srirangapatna seeing tippu’s summer palace and lazing at gosai ghat.\n\nLeaving srirangpatna at 4 we reached kengeri at 6.30. After battling the traffic reached home by 8.30\n\nWe managed to cover 400kms in 1 day\n\nThere was no snaps taken as i wanted to this trip without my cam 🙂\n\n11.920533 76.939573"
