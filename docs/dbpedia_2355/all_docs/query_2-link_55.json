        "text": "Nutritional Security\n\nHow long has it been since you last visited your village and contributed to cultivation? Was it within the past month, year, or an even longer period?\n\nToday’s nutrition facts often become tomorrow’s nutrition fallacies. We often believe that what our grandparents and parents tell us to eat is healthy. Yes, it is healthy, but does it actually impact us in the right way? This is the question that is on most of our minds.\n\nAddressing Food Toxicity Challenges through Cultivating Your Food at Krushika:\n\nIn this era, the origin of our food is complex, as farmers are driven by the necessity of earning a livelihood. Consequently, they often cultivate crops with the use of pesticides and fertilizers, which slowly harms our health. The busy lives we lead make it challenging to engage in hands-on food cultivation, thus we, at Krushika, recognizing the need for transparency in food production offer a solution by cultivating your food for you.\n\nOptimizing Wellness:\n\nOwning our food and understanding the necessary production means are crucial. Many of us face major or minor health issues, prompting the search for specific foods for our well-being. Unfortunately, these may not always be available in the market, limiting our choices. Krushika aims to shift this narrative by urging you to “Grow and eat what your body needs, not what the market is feeding you.”\n\nSeasonal & Suitable Delights: Embracing the Flavour of Eating Local\n\nSometimes, a few fruits and vegetables are not typically grown in the given climatic conditions. During such times, it’s advisable to eat what is available in the current season. For instance, mangoes are best enjoyed in the summer, while apples are ideal for the winter. The practice of eating with the changing seasons is something we have heard from our grandparents, as certain fruits and vegetables thrive in specific climatic conditions. Foods like broccoli or dragon fruit may be healthy and available throughout the year but transporting them long distances is environmentally unsustainable. Thus, consuming local produce not only supports the Indian economy but also aligns with our bodies’ suitability to the local environment.\n\nBalancing Act: Navigating the Shift from Past Lifestyles to Thriving in a Sedentary World\n\nNowadays, our lifestyles often involve sitting for long hours, particularly in office and tech-related jobs. In the past, people engaged in physical work like farming under the sun, fetching water from the well, cow grazing and many more. The two work styles are completely different and affect our bodies and health in various ways. Today, many people balance desk jobs by hitting the gym, practicing yoga, or going for a jog.\n\nKrushika offers you a chance to relax, retire, or reconnect with nature by staying at our properties or visiting our farm once a month to break the robotic lifestyle created nowadays.\n\nThe promoters of Krushika have also worked on the farm, and with their experience, we can say that it is something we can all enjoy once in a while at any of our properties.\n\nSala Farming Community: Nurturing Hoysala Heritage\n\nIn the verdant embrace of Sala resides a community whose roots intertwine with the illustrious Hoysala heritage—a tale woven by the Sala farming community. At the helm of preserving this cultural tapestry stand the esteemed guardians, CH Ramesh and SN Ramesh. Their unwavering commitment and visionary leadership have not only shaped Sala’s agricultural landscape but have also revitalized the essence of Hoysala history within this fertile land.\n\nThe Hoysala Connection\n\nSala breathes the whispers of a bygone era—the remnants of the Hoysala dynasty evident in the architectural marvels and timeless relics scattered across the landscape. The intricate carvings adorning Sala’s temples serve as living testaments to an era steeped in artistic brilliance and cultural opulence.\n\nUniting Entrepreneurship, Tech Innovation, and Teamwork: Sala’s Heritage Guardians\n\nSala’s heritage tale intertwines entrepreneurship, tech innovation, and teamwork. Girish Naik’s entrepreneurial vision seamlessly merges tradition and innovation, while Tilak DP embodies tech expertise, bridging ancient wisdom with modern tools. Together, led by leaders like Girish, the Sala team ensures heritage preservation, marrying entrepreneurial zeal with technical acumen. Their collective efforts propel Sala confidently into the digital era, safeguarding its rich legacy for the future.\n\nCertainly! Here’s an expanded version, combining the previous content with the provided details:\n\n“Crafting Sala’s Brochure: A Tale of Vision and Creativity”\n\nIn the meticulous creation of Sala’s brochure, a synergy of creative minds and artistic finesse converged to shape a masterpiece that embodies the very soul of the resort.\n\nA Collaborative Journey: Driven by the promoters’ visionary ideas, the brochure found its roots in their innovative thinking. Jovita’s intricate illustrations became the heartbeat of the brochure, breathing life into the envisioned narrative. Each stroke of her pen encapsulated Sala’s essence, infusing the visuals with a timeless allure.\n\nPrathyaksh’s Essential Contribution: At the heart of this endeavor was Prathyaksh, a driving force thrilled to be a part of this creative expedition. His meticulous attention to detail culminated in a brochure that served as a perfect showcase, a canvas portraying the resort’s distinctive and unparalleled features.\n\nA Visual Symphony: The brochure, a true visual spectacle, captivates with its opulence, radiating the luxurious and elegant ambiance that defines Sala. Every detail, meticulously crafted, narrates a story of royalty, unveiling the resort’s unique features in a captivating manner.\n\nReflection of Vision and Creativity: Beyond its tangible form, the brochure is a manifestation of Sala’s vision—an embodiment of the resort’s aspirations and the artist’s imaginative prowess. It stands as a testament to Sala’s commitment to excellence and its dedication to presenting an unparalleled experience.\n\nIn the ancient annals of the Hoysala dynasty, the tale of Sala, the progenitor of this illustrious family, unfolds like a tapestry woven with threads of mystery and heroism. It’s a saga retold through inscriptions, each narrating the pivotal incident that propelled Sala to the throne and bestowed upon his lineage a name synonymous with valor.\n\nHere’s how the popular story goes:\n\nIn the ancient chronicles of the Hoysala dynasty, there unfolds a tale of Sala, a young lad whose origins trace back to a quaint village nestled in the Western Ghats. Within the sacred confines of a temple in Angadi, he and his venerable teacher encountered a moment steeped in peril as a menacing tiger approached. In a pivotal exchange, the teacher bequeathed unto Sala a dagger, uttering the directive “Poy Sala,” a command that resonates as ‘strike Sala’ in translation. With singular valor, Sala wielded the dagger, felling the tiger with a decisive blow. From that epochal day forth, he ascended to the mantle of the dynasty’s progenitor, guiding the Hoysala lineage in its rule over the expanse of South India for an enduring span exceeding three centuries.\n\nInscription – Bl. 171\n\nAccording to the earliest inscription, Sala’s ascent to power began on the slopes of the Sahya mountains [Western Ghats], where he found himself amidst a peculiar spectacle—a hare chasing a tiger. Sala recognizing the heroic aura of the soil to himself. A revered sage, a Jina muni, at that very moment, urged Sala to strike, leading to the birth of the Hoysala name. Sala, without hesitation, wielded his dagger, putting an end to the tiger’s menace—a scene that later became the emblematic Hoysala crest.\n\nInscription – Hn. 66\n\nAnother version, as recounted, echoes a similar sentiment. Sala, on a hunting expedition along the Western Ghats, faced a challenge orchestrated by the sage. In this rendition, there’s no hare, but the essence remains—the sage tested Sala’s mettle by commanding him to slay a tiger, a task Sala executed without a second thought.\n\nInscription – Ak. 71\n\nThe narrative takes a mystical turn in this one, where Sala as a result of service and devotion to the yogindra, pleases the Jaina Muni that the sage feels that sala deserves an empire to rule. In order to gain the blessings of the goddess Vasantika of Shakyapura the yogindra asks sala for perform a ritual. It is during this penance, that the goddess decides to test the pupil of the great yogi by appearing infront of him as a fierce tiger. But without a moment’s hesitation or fear Sala spurs at the yogi’s exclamation into action, and with a cane (betta), he vanquishes the tiger—a testament to his divine destiny.\n\nInscription – Bl. 112, Ak. 82\n\nDiverse interpretations emerge in subsequent inscriptions. refers to the weapon as a cane rod (bettava sele), while Ak. 82 clarifies that sele in the body of the inscription equates to betta.\n\nInscription – Ak. 108\n\nThis introduces the term kunchada sele, a rod associated with the yogi’s fan, adorned with peacock feathers and enchanted with mystical mantras. It emphasizes that Sala’s weapon was no ordinary cane but a sacred bamboo rod.\n\nInscription – Bl. 74\n\nIn a distinctive account presented in this, Sala’s weapon is described as a laldhi, typically an iron rod but possibly a pointed stick. This variation, though not fitting the Jain tradition of Jain sanyasis not coming to contact with metal of any sorts, adds an intriguing layer to the multifaceted legacy of Sala.\n\nBeyond the inscriptions and historical nuances, Sala transcends mere myth—a timeless figure who has inspired over 400 years of golden rule by the hoysalas.\n\nIn homage to this legendary hero, we bring you “THE SALA – a Hoysala-inspired themed resort,” a property that captures the spirit of Sala and the Hoysala dynasty. Just as Sala’s story has endured through the ages, our resort aims to evoke the same sense of awe and inspiration that Sala instilled in the hearts of those who came before us. Step into the mystical world of Sala, where history, heroism, and hospitality converge in an unforgettable experience.\n\n[Source] From Epigraphia Carnatica -Vol. V | By Benjamin Lewis Rice\n\nIn an event at Rashtrapati Bhavan, M.S. Swaminathan, often hailed as the “Father of the Green Revolution” in India, shared some profound thoughts on the enduring relevance of agriculture. His words serve as a reminder of the timeless importance of this sector, regardless of technological advancements.\n\nAgriculture: A Perennial Necessity\n\nSwaminathan emphasized that agriculture will always remain relevant. No matter how much we advance technologically, the need for food and the role of agriculture in providing it will never diminish. He famously said, “If agriculture goes wrong, nothing else will have a chance to go right”. This statement underscores the critical role of agriculture in any economy.\n\nThe Youth and Agriculture\n\nReports suggest that the younger generation is reluctant to take up agriculture due to its perceived risks and low income. This trend is concerning as it could lead to a decline in agricultural productivity and food security. However, it’s essential to remember that farming is not just a profession; it’s a way of life that has sustained civilizations for millennia.\n\nKrushika firmly believes that in evolving societies there are always newer ways unfolding for people to stay connected with farming. We have to engineer and pioneer the means of this century.\n\nGrains vs Guns: A Powerful Metaphor\n\nSwaminathan made a compelling comparison between grains and guns. He stated, “The future belongs to nations with grains and not guns. Guns you can purchase but grains you cannot purchase.” This metaphor underscores the idea that food security (grains) is more important for a nation’s stability and prosperity than military power (guns). While military power can be bought, food security cannot be purchased; it must be cultivated and sustained.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nSwaminathan’s words remind us of the timeless importance of agriculture and food security for nations. His vision continues to inspire efforts towards sustainable agricultural practices and food security worldwide. It’s high time we recognize the value of agriculture and work towards making it a rewarding and respected profession for the younger generation.\n\nSwaminathan’s reflections on agriculture serve as a wake-up call for all of us. As we stride forward in this era of rapid technological advancement, let’s not forget the timeless wisdom encapsulated in his words: “The future belongs to nations with grains and not guns.”\n\nKrushika believes in creating sustainable farm communities like those that are created by Krushika around Bangalore, where we come together to ensure the nutritional security and healthcare of families.\n\nIndia presided over the G20 Summit and hosted the event in New Delhi this year, and it is a proud moment for the country. The summit, which will took place between September 9 and 10, 2023 at Pragati Maidan, now known as the Bharat Mandapam International Exhibition-Convention Centre (IECC), came leaders of the world’s richest and most powerful countries come together to discuss a range of issues.\n\nLast year, the G20 Summit was hosted by Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Bali. This year, it is India’s turn to shine as the host nation. The country has been preparing for this event for months, and it is an honor to welcome world leaders to our shores.\n\nThe G20 Summit has expanded on topics from economics and finance to include climate change, sustainable energy, debt relief, and multinational corporation taxation. These critical issues affect us all and require global cooperation and action.\n\nThe issues outlined below have been adopted by the government of India and are collectively termed “Panchamrit.” These are ambitious goals that reflect our commitment to sustainability and our responsibility towards future generations.\n\nNon-fossil fuel usage up to 500 GW by 2030.\n\nRenewable resources usage up to 50%.\n\nReduction of carbon emission.\n\nReduction of carbon intensity by less than 45%.\n\nAchieving net zero carbon emission by 2070.\n\nIn line with these global concerns, we at Krushika Farming Community have also addressed a few of these issues. Here’s our distinctive stance on the “Panchamrit”.\n\nWe have successfully transformed 500 acres of previously barren land into productive farmland, and our ambitious goal is to convert an additional 2000 acres into farmland by 2030.\n\nOur vision extends beyond the city of Bangalore; we aspire to provide over 10 satellite villages by 2030 to benefit both the residents of Bangalore and the surrounding natural environment.\n\nRecognizing Bangalore’s bustling urban environment, we aim to offer our citizens a tranquil yet conveniently accessible place to work.\n\nWe are committed to develop a community near Bangalore that would provide the highest quality, nutritionally rich food, cultivated specifically for our members, ensuring sustenance for generations to come.\n\nBeyond offering a place of serenity, we are dedicated to creating a sustainable community with ecological and financial well-being of our members.\n\nKudos to India for hosting the G20 Summit, an initiative that carries the promise of substantial benefits, both within India and on a global scale.\n\nDeep within the heart of the Western Ghats, where the lush foliage conceals hidden treasures, a young boy named Sala led a typical life in his village. However, the tranquility of his existence was abruptly shattered when a formidable tiger, like a sudden bolt of lightning, descended upon their sanctuary. Driven by an indomitable will to safeguard the lives of his fellow villagers, Sala bravely confronted the savage predator, summoning every ounce of strength within him. With unwavering determination, he defeated the mighty beast, emerging as a hero who had saved the lives of his gurukula’s pupils. From that fateful day forward, Sala’s destiny was forever altered, transforming him from an ordinary farmer into the visionary progenitor of the illustrious Hoysala dynasty.\n\nThe Majestic Hoysalas:\n\nThe Hoysala kingdom of antiquity extended its dominion far beyond the confines of the modern Kannada kingdom, encompassing vast swathes of South India and subduing formidable adversaries such as the Cholas and the Chalukyas. At the zenith of their power, the Hoysalas wielded considerable influence in shaping the destinies of neighboring kingdoms through astute political maneuvers. The Hoysalas ruled strong for over 300 years, shifting capital to Dwara-Samudra of the present-day Halebeedu. The name “Halebeedu” is a poignant reminder of the once-glorious Dwara Samudra, which fell to the relentless assaults of the Khilji Dynasty, led by the formidable Malik Kafur. After three decades of unwavering resistance, the final Hoysala ruler, Veera Ballala III, met his end. While the Hoysala Empire, the last bastion of Hindu rule in the south, succumbed to history’s march, the Hoysala feudatories preserved the empire’s indomitable spirit, laying the foundation for a flourishing dynasty on the banks of the Tungabhadra—the Vijayanagara, also known as the Kannada Samrajya.\n\nArt and Culture:\n\nThe intricacies of Hoysala literature remain largely shrouded in the mists of time, but one notable aspect is the use of Kannada as the language of administration. The Hoysala’s earned distinction for their remarkable religious tolerance, offering refuge to adherents of all faiths in their realm. This inclusive approach to governance left an enduring legacy of harmonious coexistence and cultural exchange that shaped the tapestry of South India’s rich heritage. The Hoysala era also saw the flourishing of intricate temple architecture, characterized by its exquisite craftsmanship and intricate detailing, which still stands as a testament to their artistic prowess and dedication to their cultural heritage.\n\nArchitecture:\n\nThe Hoysala architectural legacy is a well-known and cherished part of Bengaluru’s cultural heritage. It’s highly likely that as a Bengaluru resident, you’ve had the opportunity to visit one of the splendid Hoysala temples at least once in your lifetime.\n\nA typical Hoysala temple is characterized by five fundamental components:\n\nGarbha-griha (sanctum sanctorum)\n\nAntarala (vestibule)\n\nMantapam (enclosed)\n\nMantapam (open)\n\nMukha Mantapam (porch)\n\nGarudagamba\n\nThe ceilings of these temples are adorned with intricate padma motifs, oral patterns, and various other decorative elements. On the exterior, the walls are lavishly adorned, seamlessly merging with the adornments on the outer walls of the garbha-griha, creating a harmonious and unobtrusive design. Additionally, the temples feature a unique roof structure resembling a protruding nose, known as “shukanasika.” The pillars within these temples are renowned for their lathe-turned craftsmanship, and the ceilings of the mandapam bays exhibit exquisite detailing. While spacious, the closed mandapam is relatively smaller in comparison to the open mandapam, both contributing to the overall grandeur of Hoysala temple architecture.\n\nThe Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura, the temples at Arasikere, Amruthapura, Belavadi, Nuggehalli, Hosaholalu, Aralaguppe, Korvangla, Haranhalli, Mosale and Basaralu are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser-known temples.\n\nOur Project – THE SALA\n\nWe appreciate your interest in this introductory article about the Hoysala’s. Our enthusiasm for writing about the Hoysala’s is fueled by our ongoing project, “The Sala,” located near Beluru in Sakleshpura. The Sala encompasses a vast 55-acre property, boasting lush coffee, pepper, and timber plantations, as well as an upcoming resort. This resort is meticulously crafted with a Hoysala theme, featuring carefully designed architecture and beautifully landscaped gardens, creating an ideal retreat for those seeking to immerse themselves in the magnificence of the Hoysala Dynasty. With each passing day, we discover fresh wellsprings of inspiration as we work on this project.\n\nWe must acknowledge the glorious temples that the Hoysala’s have left behind as a testament to their remarkable legacy. Interestingly, while their temples stand as architectural marvels, there are no surviving grand Hoysala palaces. It’s perhaps a reflection of their humility that they focused on creating awe-inspiring temples rather than opulent palaces.\n\nHowever, our villas at the Hoysala’s serve as a tribute to this illustrious dynasty, offering a glimpse into how they might have lived. This historic resort is more than just a place of relaxation and natural beauty; it represents a unique blend of the Hoysala spirit and modern luxury.\n\nMoreover, beyond its historical significance, the resort presents exciting investment opportunities. The combination of our coffee plantation and this historic resort forms a profitable venture that not only guarantees lasting memories but also promises impressive returns on your investment. It’s an opportunity to be part of a cherished legacy while securing your financial future.\n\nStay tuned for an upcoming series of blog articles, where we’ll continue to explore the intriguing history and heritage of the Hoysalas.\n\nToday let’s talk about a very important topic: The Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961. This landmark legislation was crafted to safeguard the interests of tenants and small-scale farmers in the Karnataka state of India. Its overarching goals included curbing the concentration of land within the hands of a privileged few while preserving agricultural land from being diverted for non-agricultural purposes.\n\nAt the heart of this act lie Sections 79(A) and 79(B), pivotal provisions that place restrictions on the ownership of agricultural lands by individuals without a lineage of farming spanning at least two generations anywhere in the nation. Moreover, these sections establish a cap on the extent of land that can be owned by an individual or a family within Karnataka.\n\nThough land reforms fall under state jurisdiction, each Indian state possesses the authority to enact its own land reform and land usage laws. Notably, unlike other states, Karnataka has historically enforced limitations on agricultural land ownership – a stance that underwent transformation with the revocation of these sections via a July 2020 ordinance. This repeal breathed life into the aspirations of urban agriculture enthusiasts, enabling them to directly connect with the soil. Beyond just procuring produce from stores, individuals could now possess the means of agricultural production—an avenue to pursue.\n\nOur era stands as a juncture where virtual endeavors, remote work, and improved connectivity to Bangalore have redefined the scope of engagements. Five decades ago, we witnessed the migration of manpower from villages to industrial hubs; now, a reverse trend emerges owing to shifting work dynamics and simplified links. Amidst this changing landscape, Krushika emerges distinctively, offering more than just a plot of land for the people who are looking to buy farmland near Bangalore. Unlike others, such as Hosachiguru and Vibes Estate, Krushika brings unprecedented features: continuous healthcare, tourism-generated revenue, and nutritional well-being for the entire community. Our vision transcends mere weekend aspirations; we aim for agricultural living to become an integral reality.\n\nKrushika is the brainchild of the creators behind esteemed ventures like Guhnatara, Shilhaandara, and Siri Nature Roosts, Jhari Eco Stay – trailblazers in hospitality and lifestyle habitats.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nDo you know how land is measured in different parts of the world? From hectares to acres, and bighas to guntas, there are various units used for land measurement. Today, we’ll embark on a fun learning journey to explore the fascinating world of land measurement, focusing on a unique unit called “Gunta”. So, let’s gear up and dive into the realm of land measurement to expand our knowledge!\n\n1. What is Gunta?\n\nImagine you’re searching farm for sale near Bangalore, and you come across the term “Gunta”. But what is Gunta?

It is widely used in states such as Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Gujarat. Gunta is particularly suitable for smaller land measurements.\n\n2. Gunta Conversions:\n\n3. How to Calculate Gunta to Square Feet?\n\nHere comes another intriguing question: “How many square feet are there in one Gunta?” To unravel this mystery, let’s understand square feet first. Square feet is a commonly used imperial unit for land measurement in several countries, including India. Interestingly, one Gunta is equivalent to 1089 square feet. Ready to impress your friends with this cool conversion fact?\n\n4. The Versatility of Gunta Measurement:\n\nYou might be wondering, “Why do we even need Gunta measurement?” Well, whether you’re buying or selling land or planning construction projects, Gunta measurement comes to the rescue! It helps estimate the materials required and overall costs for building, making real estate deals smoother.
