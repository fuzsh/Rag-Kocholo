        "text": "The sun is out. The skies are blue. And my camera finger is twitching.\n\nThus, in the wee hours, one sets off in search of obscure Hoysala temples. This time, it’s the Chennakeshava temple at Aralaguppe. This little dot-on-the map is difficult to locate even with GPS.\n\nAralaguppe is about 60km from the town of Hassan, and 140km from Bangalore. Hassan was an important city during the Hoysala period, from the 10th century to the 14th. As a result, there are many ancient Hoysala temples in and around Hassan, including the famous ones at Halebidu and Beluru.\n\nThe Hoysala temple at Aralaguppe is unheard of by the tourist crowds, and is far away from the beaten track. For which one is thankful. Such temples allow Hoysala connoisseurs like me the liberty to take photographs at leisure, without a bunch of raucous idiots breathing down my neck.\n\nExcept that the bent old caretaker at this temple is a cranky nitwit.\n\nWouldn’t let me shoot photos of the outside of the temple, although it is freely permitted. Even after the presiding priest gave me permission to shoot outside and told the caretaker to back off, that crackpot kept following me around, cursing and threatening.\n\nI left the place after a few minutes, before I picked up a major argument with this cantankerous jackass. But not before I shot several photos,. Not as many as I would have liked, but enough.\n\nThe Chennakeshava temple, at the name indicates, is dedicated to Vishnu. This temple was consecrated in 1250 CE and has all the architectural components of a typical Hoysala temple.\n\nWhat makes this obscure temple different, and why I went looking for it, are the carvings of Chaturvimshati rupani, that is, Vishnu in 24 forms. In his four-armed version, Vishnu bears a conch, discus, mace and lotus in each of his arms. He may bear these objects in any of his arms, giving rise to different combinations. For those of you who remember your college mathematics, that happens to be 4! (four factorial), hence 24 forms.\n\nThis temple depicts all these 24 forms on its walls. I couldn’t count them all, but I think I got most of them in my camera. The chief sculptor of this small but impressive Hoysala temple was Honnoja, a famous sculptor of the era. His name can still be seen below some of the sculptures.\n\nThis is an ekakuta temple, i.e, it has one shikara tower (or vimana) above the primary deity’s garbhagriha (the sanctum). The temple is built on an elevated platform called the jagati. And like most other Hoysala temples, the outer walls have six horizontal friezes with rows of elephants, horses and depictions of various stories from our scriptures.\n\nAs is my practice, I paid for an archana and offered a generous dakshina to the priest. In spite of the boorish caretaker, I felt I owed it to the temple and the priest.\n\nEight hundred years ago, when Honnoja and his colleagues created these masterpieces in soapstone, little would they have known that one fine day in the 21st century, Yours Truly would arrive on the scene to write a blogpost on them, eh?\n\nThe marauders from the Delhi sultanate, who repeatedly plundered and desecrated all other Hoysala temples during the 14th century, and again during the 16th century, did not spare this little temple either. But here too, what remains is still awe-inspiring in its artistry, if not in size.\n\nAvoid this place.\n\nI won’t mince my words. Just avoid this hostile place. Even for a Hoysala aficionado like me, this place is not worth the aggravation and the trouble of the 3-hour journey it takes to get there.\n\nCheers … Srini.\n\nThe Hoysalas never cease to amaze. And my photographic fascination with them continues, as I keep visiting their temples.\n\nThe Hoysalas ruled Karnataka and large parts of south India for about four hundred years, between the 10th and 14th centuries. Theirs was a golden era of art, religion and architecture.\n\nThe Hoysalas were prolific temple builders. Their temples “exhibit an amazing display of sculptural exuberance“, to quote Indian History by Krishna Reddy.\n\nNowhere else is this exuberance more on display than at the Chennakeshava temple at Beluru.\n\nLocated at a distance of about 220 km from Bangalore, Halebidu and Belur are usually spoken of together. Of the two, I regard Belur as better preserved and more sophisticated.\n\nThis is a Vaishnava temple that was commissioned by King Vishnuvardhana in the early 12th century. Fifth in the line, and a Jain by birth, Vishnuvardhana converted to Vaishnavism after he became a disciple of Shri Ramanujacharya.\n\nThe Chennakeshava temple, like its cousin at Halebidu, took over a hundred years to complete, and was finally consecrated by Vishnuvardhana’s grandson, Veera Ballala II. Like all other Hoysala temples across Karnataka, Belur’s temple was repeatedly raided, looted and damaged by marauding Muslim armies from the Delhi Sultanate. Several repairs and additions were done by subsequent Hindu kings, especially by the Vijayanagar rulers during the 14th century and by the Wadiyars in the 17th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe artistry of the original sculptors is still evident and it is breathtaking. Ruvari Mallithamma, considered one of the foremost temple sculptors of the Hoysala era, was one of them. Other famous sculptors of the time included Jakanacharya and his son Dankanacharya, Dasoja and his son Chavana, Malliyanna and Nagoja. Each of these sculptors were specialists with unique skills.\n\nLike all other Hoysala temples, this one is made of soapstone, a material that lends itself to extremely intricate artwork. This temple follows the same general scheme as other typical Hoysala temples like those at Somnathapura and Hosaholalu. Built on a raised platform called a jagati, and with a characteristic star-shaped layout, you will see the same six-layered carvings on the outer walls, that I’ve described at length in an earlier blogpost.\n\nWhat makes Belur stand out though, are its beautiful women. Its sculptures of beautiful women, is what I mean. This sculptural element is called a Shalabhanjika. The term in Sanskrit means “she who breaks the branch of the shala tree”.\n\nShorea robusta is the scientific name for the shala or sala tree. Shala is native to India and a very useful tree. Like the Peepal and Ashoka, Shala is praised as a divine tree in our scriptures. If you are familiar with the Ramayana, you will remember that Rama pierced seven Shala trees with one arrow, to prove his prowess to Sugriva.\n\nThe Shala tree is frequently seen in Hoysala temple sculptures, as a decorative arch around carved figures.\n\nShalabhanjikas also called madanikas, are richly carved images of beautiful young women under Shala arches. The women are in various poses, holding a variety of musical instruments, birds, animals and other objects like mirrors. Generally, you will see Shalabhanjikas under the eaves of a temple.\n\nThe madanikas of Belur are in a class apart. There are 38 of them, from the original forty, and each is uniquely beautiful. The carvings are too intricate to describe. Better to let the images to speak for themselves. They are pretty hard to photograph, I might add. I really had to twist my neck to get the right angle.\n\nThese curvaceous and seductive Shalabhanjikas are alone worth the long drive from Bangalore. Not to speak of the other sculptural marvels you will find at Belur.\n\nIt’s a solid four hour drive from Bangalore, but the road is pretty good. If you’re driving down, either in your own car or a taxi, please ensure you have a FastTag sticker on your windshield. Otherwise, believe me, you will sorely repent. The cash lane at every toll gate on the way is a kilometer long.\n\nFood is not a problem, but advisable to carry snacks and bottled water. The temple opens by 7.30 am. Weekends are always crowded. And it does get very hot, even in winter. Wear a hat. I didn’t and I got sunburnt.\n\nEntry for Indians is free. Photography with hand-held cameras is also free, for Indians. This is an ASI site, and camera tripods are not allowed. Photography outside is freely permitted, but inside the sanctum sanctorum it is not. This is a living temple, with daily pujas going on, so don’t annoy the priests by clicking away at random inside the sanctum.\n\nThink twice about hiring a tour guide here. They are likely to over-charge you and they are not knowledgeable anyway. Wikipedia will provide you better information.\n\nAll the same, this place is definitely worth visiting, Try to get here early in the day, when the rising sun is still low on the horizon.\n\nCheers … Srini.\n\nIn the past ten years, I’ve visited the Keshava temple at Somnathapura many times. For me, there’s not much left to discover about this ancient temple of the Hoysalas.\n\nThis time though, I wanted to test out my new Tokina 16-28 mm, f2.8 wide-angle lens. By my standards, this is an expensive lens. I bought this lens after a great deal of research, with the intention of shooting landscapes and temple architecture.\n\nI was not disappointed.\n\nSince this is a wide-angle lens, it does produce some barrel distortion at the edges of the image, that has to be corrected in post-production. But it’s sharp at the center and one needs to compose the shot accordingly. The lens is good value for money, I’d say.\n\nIn 2023, the Keshava temple was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Along with the other two Hoysala UNESCO temples at Halebidu and Beluru, this temple forms the “Sacred Ensemble of the Hoysalas”.\n\nIf you think that becoming a UNESCO site would make things better, you are just wrong.\n\nUsually, I would pay a nominal fee of Rs 25 (for Indians), and stroll in. Now, however, ASI accepts only on-line payment at this particular temple, even at the gate.\n\nTry paying in advance via the ASI website, and you will fail. Then, after you arrive at the temple, try paying via the QR code at the gate and you will fail again.\n\nASI, by the way, stands for the Archeological Survey of India, the government department that maintains these historical sites.\n\nThe fumbling efforts of the guy at the gate don’t help either. The result is a huge crowd at the gate, and total chaos.\n\nAnd why the eff does ASI need my Aadhar card, my PAN card and my address, just to see a temple?\n\nI refused to share my Aadhar and PAN card, and decided to turn back, but my driver agreed to share his driver’s license, and after a long debate between the security guy and the ticket clerk, we were finally let in.\n\nWe were let in, but with dire warnings from the security guy that he would be watching me via the CC cameras everywhere, and I was not to shoot videos on my DSLR.\n\nAnd when I left the place an hour later, he claimed I had shot “too many” photos on my DSLR and wanted to count them and confiscate my camera! And this when there were dozens of lovey-dovey couples in the temple, merrily cavorting around shooting Insta and Facebook video reels.\n\nThe temple itself is just as exciting as it was, and I did have a jolly time shooting photo after photo of the intricate carvings. This is one temple that allows you to shoot inside the sanctum, since it is not a functional temple.\n\nThe temple was built by a general called Somanatha Dandanayaka, under the reign of Hoysala king Narasimha III, during the mid-13th century. The temple was badly damaged by marauders from the Delhi Sultanate during the 14th and 15th century, then partly repaired by the Vijayanagar kings in the 16th century and later by the Mysore Wodeyars.\n\nThe temple is in a pretty bad shape, but one can still appreciate the artistry of the Hoysala sculptors. One of them was the legendary Ruvari Mallitamma, one of the most prolific sculptors of the Hoysala era. You can see his signature carved under some of the statues.\n\nIt’s a three-hour drive from Bangalore. The road is good, but you really should avoid weekends. What with the weekend crowds and the bungling guards at the gate, you will get really stressed out.\n\nTry to book your tickets online at the ASI website, and after you fail to do so, take your chances at the gate when you reach the place after a three-hour drive.\n\nI don’t think I’ll visit this place ever again.\n\nCheers …\n\nSrini."
