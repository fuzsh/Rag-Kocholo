Road to Kudli -\n\nAt Rameshwara Temple. Bhadra river on the right, meets Tunga river flowing from the left to become Tungabhadra. Kudli means 'to join'\n\nBad experience at Kudla because of an irritating guy who claimed to be an ASI employee. No photos, not even of the exteriors because \"it's a central government property\". I retorted that he did not make any sense (I said something on the lines of 'Taj Mahal too is govt property. Not allowed to take photos of that either?'), went ahead and took some photos. But let's just say the whole experience was ruined because of this guy's plans of extorting money (I guess) from tourists.\n\nI always tip Rs. 100 to priest or ASI employee or local villagers who offer to give a tour of temple complex. Obviously, this guy got nothing from me.\n\nWe walked down the road to Chintamani Narasimha Temple at the confluence of Tunga and Bhadra rivers.\n\nLast edited by SmartCat : 12th December 2016 at 19:49.\n\nTeam-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2007\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 6,644\n\nThanked: 45,440 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nBALLIGAVI\n\nName: Kedareshwara Temple\n\nWiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedare...ple,_Balligavi\n\nHow To Get There: Type 'Balligavi Kedareshwar' in Google Maps and select 'Balligavi Kedareshwar Karnataka' from the drop down list.\n\nGoogle Maps Link: https://goo.gl/maps/3AHsFWqdsb72\n\nDistance from Shimoga: 75 kms\n\nThe route suggested by Google Maps is quite good till 40 or 50 km. After that, the village roads are quite bad and you will struggle to cross 40 kmph. The \"8 min slower\" route via Shikaripur is a state highway undergoing widening. Take this route only if you enjoy a dust shower.\n\nExcuse the quality of some images (taken from my wife's Samsung phone). Image quality from my Asus Zenfone is excellent (like the one below) but the phone is very fickle! You cannot miss the Kedareshwar Temple. For once, its just off the highway.\n\nFront view of the temple.\n\nVery odd placement of Nandi statue, almost blocking the entrance . Isn't this unusual? Any significance of such placement?\n\nInteresting staggered architecture -\n\nOn the left, there is an Archeological Art Gallery with many thousand year old idols (no photography allowed)\n\nView from the back:\n\nView from the side:\n\nThere is a small Allama Prabhu temple on the right hand side:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allama_Prabhu\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2013\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 1,817\n\nThanked: 5,575 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nI had to accompany a friend of mine to Swathi Delicacy for breakfast today and decided to check out the temples at Turuvekere & Aralaguppe.\n\nTuruvekere as a whole was a big letdown as all 3 temples that I visited were locked and I had to satisfy myself with a peek from outside. The Chennakeshava Temple is not really exceptional from the outside and I did wonder if this was built in the same time period as the others at Belavadi or Doddagaddavali as the walls seemed pretty plain when compared to the other temples that I had visited.\n\nChennakeshava Temple\n\nMoole Shankareshware temple\n\nYou can see that the temple premises is not very clean and the stone work on it is again below par when compared to the other hoysala temples\n\nAlso visited the Sri Gangadhreshwara temple, which I dont think is a Hoysala temple as only a couple of pillars have some stone work on it. Even the Vimana above the temple seems to be made of mud/stone. The standout feature is the big Nandi which seems to have been carved from a single block of stone\n\nNandi - Sri Gangadhareshwara Temple\n\nSpoke to smartcat yesterday night and he mentioned that cops at Aralaguppe might throw a spanner in the works by restricting photography. Hence I was in two minds about driving here but decided to take a chance. In my opinion, I should have just skipped Turuvekere and driven straight to Aralaguppe as the temple is a beauty!\n\nThe complex is very well maintained and the stone work on the walls of the temple are a treat to the eye. The cop and the ASI person keep butting in/photo bombing and in general its not a great experience but I did not mind it much as the temple is a work of art. The carvings on the ceiling are very unique in this temple and its a pity that I could not take pics inside the temple.\n\nTemple info\n\nEntrance\n\nThe photo bomber\n\nQuote:\n\nBelow the eaves two different decorative schemes may be found, depending on whether a temple was built in the early or the later period of the empire. In the early temples built prior to the 13th century, there is one eave and below this are decorative miniature towers. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers, followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves, followed by six different mouldings of equal size. This is broadly termed \"horizontal treatment\".The six mouldings at the base are divided in two sections. Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second horizontal section has depictions of the Hindu epics and Puranic scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of yallis or makaras (imaginary beasts) and hamsas (swans).\n\nSource: Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoysala_architecture\n\nDecorative mini towers\n\nSix layered base\n\nAnother variation of the layered base\n\nStar shaped temple platform\n\nRoad Condition\n\nYadiyur to NH150A has a few patches that were being tarred over today and should not pose a problem to any car. Watch out for a couple on unmarked speed breakers as soon as you take the right onto NH150A, after which its a two lane road till Turuvekere and further ahead till the turnoff for Aralaguppe. The road to Aralaguppe is narrow with some broken culverts, bad patches and a few blind curves where local 2 wheelers just blindly zip through. Better off driving slow, using the horn and soaking in the views of coconut plantations.\n\nThus endeth another good weekend. Planning to take a couple of days off towards the end of the month and cover the other temples and wrap up an eventful year\n\nTeam-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2007\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 6,644\n\nThanked: 45,440 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nKANNAMBADI\n\nName: Venugopala Swamy Temple\n\nWiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venugopala_Swamy_Temple\n\nHow To Get There: Type 'Sri Venugopala Swamy Temple' in Google Maps and select 'Sri Venugopala Swamy, Krishna Rajasagara, Kannambadi' from the drop down list.\n\nGoogle Maps Link: https://goo.gl/maps/rD2FCpmUtDp\n\nDistance: 135 kms from Bangalore, 30 kms from Mysore, 98 km from Hassan\n\nKannambadi temple story is quite interesting (see wiki link). When KRS dam was built over River Cauvery in 1930, the temple went underwater. A rich private individual then relocated the temple 1 km away with the help of ASI, Government and local villagers.\n\nMany elements of the temple are being reconstructed with the help of ASI\n\nAt the entrance of the main temple complex:\n\nA walk around the temple (outer hall):\n\nView of the inner temple:\n\nA walk around the temple (inner hall):\n\nNote that idols are yet to be placed inside the temple. The relocation/reconstruction is still a WIP. Now every article on Kannambadi says its a \"relocation\" - but looking at the type of stone used, many parts of the temple looks like a \"reconstruction\" to me.\n\nBONUS:\n\nPicnic spot a few hundred metres from the temple - the KRS backwaters. It was pleasant even in the afternoon.\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2013\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 1,817\n\nThanked: 5,575 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nIKKERI\n\nName: Sri Aghoreshvara Temple\n\nWiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikkeri\n\nGoogle Maps Link: https://goo.gl/maps/tf2cdRbGrqM2\n\nDistance: 5 kms from Sagar in Shimoga district, 32 kms from Jog Falls & 76 kms from Shivamogga\n\nMultiple cultures have influenced the architecture of this temple and its clearly visible from the size of this temple. Its big and made of granite, which means that the art work on its walls was probably a lot harder to make and because of the stone, it was also a lot harder to deform.\n\nThe ancient temple which contained the 6 feet , 32 handed figure of Bhairava was demolished by the Sultanate after which the Ikkeri Nayakas rebuilt this temple in a mix of Hoysala + Dravidian style. The temple walls are red in a lot of places and the evening colors only added to the beauty of the place.The nandi is massive, has its own enclosure but has been ravaged over time & is missing most of its tail.\n\nTemple History\n\nRed hued walls\n\nGranite carvings\n\nNandi\n\nWindows in a Hoysala temple\n\nLeave no stone untouched\n\nSri Aghoreshavara Idol\n\nThis is supposedly a Shakthi peetha - do note the goddess like images carved in the base of the shiva linga. The nandi in front is made of translucent marble and the priest actually shine light through the same to prove the point.\n\nDevi Temple\n\nVery different style of architecture - not able to figure out what is amiss here but the door arch seems to be pointing to a different culture where as the intricate carvings on the door frame leading to the deity are very Hoysala."
