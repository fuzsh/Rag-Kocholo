        "text": "The Union Culture Ministry announced nominations of India for the world heritage list for the year 2022-2023. The Somanathapura, Halebid in Karnataka and Hoysala Temples of Belur are the Indian sites nominated for the world heritage list for 2022-2023. So here, we will discuss these Hoysaleswara Temples, which the Hoysala Dynasty constructed. We shall explore the Hoysala dynasty and temples in brief in this article. We shall discuss the names of other Hoysaleswara Temples also, which are not inscribed on the World Heritage List. In the article below, let us know the chennakeshava temple and the Hoysala temples list.\n\nHoysala Dynasty\n\nSeveral temples built during Hoysala rule are still present in the Karnataka state, and many are present in inscriptions.\n\nNripa Kama II or Sala founded it. It existed in South India between 1110AD and 1326AD. Today’s major parts of Karnataka and minor parts of Tamilnadu and Andhra Pradesh were its parts. Its capital initially was Belur, but later Halebidu was considered its capital. Halebidu was also known as Dwarsamudra. Vishnuvardhana is considered the greatest king of Hoysala.\n\nSacred Ensembles of Hoysala\n\nBelur\n\nThe Chennakeshava temple devoted to Lord Vishnu is the most famous temple, situated at the centre of Old Walled town, located on the banks of the Yagachi River.\n\nMany Historians believe that its construction started in the year 1117 AD. The exterior walls of temples contain beautifully sculptured scenes depicting dance, life and other art forms. Some walls also show the life of Lord Vishnu and his lessons from Mahabharat and Ramayana. The Archaeological Survey of India has considered protected monuments to these temples, so these temples are under maintenance and conservation. These temples signify the art and talent of Hoysala artists. These temples are constructed in the Dravidian style, but there is some influence from Bhumija and Nagara styles. Bhumija style is observed in Central India. At the same time, Nagara traditions are observed in Northern and Western India. Hoysala architecture developed during 1050-1300 AD.\n\nSalient Features of Hoysala Architecture\n\nThe main building material which was used in Hoysala architecture was soft soapstone. There used to be a zig-zag pattern in the walls and stairs of the temple. Multiple shrines used to be around a pillar. Even the jewellery of shrines used to be carved on the stone. This was the speciality of the Hoysala architecture. Jagati is an upraised platform, and a temple used to be made at that jagati. Hoysala temples are considered rich in architecture. Their architecture is the key because of which their remnants are still present. Hoysala architecture is the perfect example of a combination of Northern and Southern architecture. The basement of Hoysala temples is star-shaped. The exterior walls of hoysala temples depict mythological stories. Fine Carvings are one of the most important specialities of the Hoysala temples. There is a tradition of Navrang pillars inside the hoysaleswara temples. These Navrang pillars are very smooth.\n\nThese are considered salient features of Hoysala architecture.\n\nHoysaleswara temple is also one of the famous Hoysala Temples.\n\nHoysaleswara Temple was built during the great king Vishnuvardhana. This temple was dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is said that the wealthy citizens of Halebidu built the temple. Hoysaleswara temple is the largest monument of the Halebidu. This beautiful temple was also ruined by the armies of Delhi Sultanate Alauddin Khilji in the early 14th century.\n\nHoysala Temples have been finalised as India’s nomination for the World Heritage site.\n\nThe state government will ensure the conservation of the monuments surrounding the temples.\n\nUNESCO prepares this list.\n\nEvery country that signed the World Heritage Convention of 1972 sends its nomination, further looked at by advisory members.\n\nIn India, this list is maintained by the Union Culture Ministry.\n\nUnder the 1973 convention, UNESCO strives to encourage the conservation, identification and maintenance of natural and cultural sites.\n\nThe World Heritage committee protects sustainable tourism. Karnataka already has two UNESCO world heritage sites. They are Hampi and Pattakadal. A few more sites are nominated for the inscription in the world heritage list. It is a very proud moment for the Karnataka state and India.\n\nHoysala Temples List\n\nChennakeshava Temple, Belur\n\nHalebeedu\n\nHoysaleshwara Temple\n\nLakshmi Devi Temple, Doddagaddavalli\n\nChennakeshava Temple, Somnathpur\n\nAmrutesvara Temple, Amruthapura\n\nBucesvara Temple, Koramangala\n\nLakshminarasimha Temple, Javagal\n\nKoramangala\n\nJain temple complex\n\nPanchaLingeshwara Temple\n\nHosaholalu\n\nAralaguppe\n\nKedareswara Temple\n\nNuggehalli\n\nBrahmeshvara Temple, Kikkert\n\nBelur\n\nBelavadi\n\nNageshvara-Chennakeshava Temple complex, Mosale\n\nHaranahalli\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article, we have discussed the hoysaleswara temple, channakeshava temple, and the Hoysala temples list because Hoysala temples are officially nominated for the inscription in the World Heritage List. Hoysala temples are unique in architecture. The Hoysala dynasty constructed Hoysala temples. Hoysala temples are situated in Karnataka state. We have also discussed the Hoysala dynasty’s basic details, Hoysala architecture, and some famous temples. It is a proud moment that such rich architecture originated on our land. The Hoysala Dynasty was destroyed because of Delhi Sultanate Alauddin Khilji."
