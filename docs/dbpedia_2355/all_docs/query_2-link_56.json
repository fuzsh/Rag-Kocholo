        "text": "The names and forms of Devī are myriad, which the Lalitāsahasranāma (Lalitopākhyāna in Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa) and Devīsahasranāma (in Rudrayāmaḷa) present in abridged form. The Devīmāhātmyam in its ‘Kavacam’ (shield) presents a long list of the nāmas of Devī. Besides, the aṣṭottaram-śataḥ (100+ epithets) of the Goddesses bearing on Durgā, Sarasvatī, Lakṣmī, Pārvatī and so on are regularly recited in temples invoking the presence of Devī, the Superior Mother who is always with those that foster dharma. Conducting Durgā-pūja (popularly known as as Viṣṇu-Durgā) is a living tradition on all ‘Veḷḷikkiḷamai/Śukravāram’ (Friday) in the temples of Tamilnadu. The popular custom in Tamilnadu is whenever a soothsayer or oracle-teller (known as kuṭukuṭuppai beating a kettledrum) stands in front of a house says “a feminine divinity is the guarding this house”. She is called illuṟai-teyvam (Goddess residing in the house) in Cilappatikāram. The male divinities in Hindu lore are feminized, e.g. Śiva-Śivā, Viṣṇu-Vaiṣṇavī, Brahmā-Brahmī, and the Sapta/Aṣṭa Mātṛkās. The catur-Vedas have their consorts, e.g. Ṛg-Sāmidevī, Yajūr-‘Sruk’, Sāma-Guhūdevī and Atharvaṇa-‘Samidh’. Devī is the half of Śiva (Ardhanārīśvara), Lakṣmī lives in the heart of Viṣṇu (Śrīvatsa) and Sarasvatī occupies the tongue of Brahmā (Vākdevī). The symbolism is man cannot think, move or speak if there is no śakti (literally “energy”). Śakti is Devī. Śiva devoid of Śakti is śava. Kālī (Tamil Mōṭi, Hindi moti “pearl”) is a powerful Goddess. If the parākrama of Śrī Rāma could annihilate daśamukha-Rāvaṇa, Kālī (Sītā transformed) could root out sahasragrīva-Rāvaṇa according to the Adbhuta-Rāmāyaṇa. Kālī is a metaphor for power and authority. This is the philosophy behind the imagery of Kolkata-Kālī. In these days of rampant terrorism and naked outrage (whether through bomb-culture or Korana-virus phobia) all over the world, the Kolkata-Kālī is the Dhavantri or Aśvinidevatā to root out evil. Today, Kālī is a popular image all over the southern states, particularly Tamilnadu. She is the terror to terrorists. However, the fundamental ethos of the ‘Mother’ (Mātṛdevatā) is prema “love” for the jaṅgama and sthāvara ātmas. Therefore, Hindu scriptures view each akṣara (letter, alphabet) the abstraction of the Mother. East or west, the first projecting alphabet from the lip of a baby is a/mmā/mā, pā, appā (attā in devotional literature Tiruvāymoḻi 2.3.2), or [h]appa. There is nothing in the world equal to the love of the mother toward her children, the cosmic mass. She is the Brahmāṇḍa-nāyikā, Puruṣikā Virāṭ in Saundaryalaharī (v. 7). Several scholars have tried to unfold the mysteries of Devī, I am skeptical whether anyone has summed up the akṣaradevatās, all viewed feminine according to the Siddhaśabaratantra cited in Śrītattvanidhi (1.137-187)."
