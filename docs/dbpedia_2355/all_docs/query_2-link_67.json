With most of the streets named after famous Kannada poets and writers, this place is a favourite among old timers. The traders used to pay entry tax at Sunkenahalli which is now Gandhi Bazaar before proceeding towards the Pete area to sell goods. DVG Road and Gandhi Bazaar are famous shopping areas in Basavanagudi. The whole area around Gandhi Bazaar is scented with flowers in the mornings and evenings when fresh flowers are sold.\n\nGandhi Bazaar and DVG Road\n\nBasavanagudi gets its name from the ancient 16th century Bull Temple, having a huge monolithic Nandi bull, measuring 10 ft high and 15 ft long which dates back to the 16th century during Hiriya Kempegowda-I. Just below the front pedestal of the Basava statue is a 17th century inscription, which mentions about the origin of Vrishabhavati river below the place.\n\nAt the foot of the hillock is the Dodda Ganapati temple, also built during the Kempegowda's times, which has a Ganesha image carved on a rock.\n\nBig Bull Temple\n\nInscription mentioning the source of Vrishabhavati river\n\nAdjoining the Bull temple is the Bugle rock, a 3000 million years old single rock, on top of which stands a watch tower built by Kempegowda for a panoramic view of Bangalore of his times and have someone to blow a bugle to sound alert.
