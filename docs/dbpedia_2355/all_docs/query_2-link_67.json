With most of the streets named after famous Kannada poets and writers, this place is a favourite among old timers. The traders used to pay entry tax at Sunkenahalli which is now Gandhi Bazaar before proceeding towards the Pete area to sell goods. DVG Road and Gandhi Bazaar are famous shopping areas in Basavanagudi. The whole area around Gandhi Bazaar is scented with flowers in the mornings and evenings when fresh flowers are sold.\n\nGandhi Bazaar and DVG Road\n\nBasavanagudi gets its name from the ancient 16th century Bull Temple, having a huge monolithic Nandi bull, measuring 10 ft high and 15 ft long which dates back to the 16th century during Hiriya Kempegowda-I.
