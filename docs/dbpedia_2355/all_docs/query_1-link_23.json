        "text": "The Hoysala hunt continued with two new places added to the list, thanks to Twitter. Technically, there was just one – Aralaguppe, but the place was close to Turuvekere, and a bit of digging showed me two other places there.\n\nThis time S joined me for the ride, and we left at aroud 7:45 AM from my place, me on the Bull 500, and S on his Electra. For the second half of October it wasn’t too cold. We did the usual route of Tumkur road -> Hassan Road and the usual breakfast stop at Swati Delicacy before Yadiyur. After Yadiyur, there was a right to be taken towards Turuvekere. Right after the turn we were greeted by a pristine B road. Two lanes width, just about wider than that, and going all the way in that condition to Mayasandra where we had to take a right and then a left to avoid going towards Gubbi. Turuvekere was reached at around 10:15 AM.\n\nThe first temple on the list was a Chennakesava temple, from around 1260 AD. Unlike other Kesava temples, this wasn’t too ornate. It didn’t have much carvings outside, and the ASI or PWD had also done a shoddy job with some concrete support at the top.\n\nThe place was pretty with lots of coconut and areca trees around, and quiet with just the sound of Prinias and other passerine birds. The doors were locked so there wasn’t much to see inside. We could only peek in through the iron gate and see the signature Hoysala lathing.\n\nThe temple walls and dome were getting overgrown with creepers and other plants, suggesting that a lot more maintenance was needed. Surprising given that it was an ASI monument. And like with any Indian structure, there was enough graffiti on the walls to last the next 800 years.\n\nJust as we were leaving, another person dropped by and S got talking to him. He suggested another temple – Nagalapura, between Turuvekere and Yadiyur. This turned out to be another ASI structure from around 1250 AD. Definitely worth a visit another time.\n\nWe headed on to the next temple in Turuvekere – Mule Sankareswara. This is a Shiva temple and almost similar in appearance to the one we just left. Except that the area in which it was located was much bigger and was on lower ground making for pretty photos. As with the other temple, this was nice and quiet. The gate was locked and we were about to beat it when an elderly guy saw us and got us the keys to open the gate and enter the premises. It wasn’t easy walking around the grassy area especially with all the dew from the morning. But it was another quiet and peaceful temple. This is also dated to 1260 AD. Looks like they built both at the same time.\n\nWe locked the gate, handed over the keys and left at around 11 AM to Aralaguppe. Google maps showed us a route where we had to head towards Tiptur and then take a quick left after N Machenahalli and then turn right and continue north towards Aralaguppe. This road turned out to be a complete disaster. It was close to 8 km, but at a couple of places we had to ride cross-country with pools taking over the road. The ride itself was rickety, but we reached Aralaguppe in one piece.\n\nThe Aralaguppe Chennakesava temple is similar to Nuggehalli in structure, and is a lot more maintained, in that they’ve removed all the grass and laid stones all over. It seems to get a lot more visitors, but at the cost of the charm that these temples have with the growth around them. But there was a board explaining the temple, which was definitely welcome. There was also an elderly man who seemed to be the caretaker, giving us some tips about certain things which was definitely useful. A railway line passes really close to the temple and you can hear trains chugging by at regular intervals. Turned out that the Aralaguppe railway station was also almost next door!\n\nThe entrance looked like a typical hoysala structure, which was definitely a good change from the usual.\n\nThe left side seemed to have a brick built uncarved entrance. We were not sure if that was older or later. I felt it could be a later addition similar to Hosaholalu, but S felt the limestone sculptures suggested an earlier construction. Turns out this is an Ugra Narasimha temple added later and over the existing temple!\n\nThere were the usual Vishnu sculptures all over, and they also had the signature of the sculptor – Honnoja (the bottom right image).\n\nLike with Nuggehalli, there were stories from the Bhagavatha carved in the bottom friezes set amidst horses, elephants, dancer and creepers.\n\nThe temple was beautiful, but without the greenery around it, that charm is missing. Felt too “maintained”.\n\n(We really need to do a better job than having a white pipe showing up in the middle of a 700+ year old structure)\n\nWe left at around 12:15 PM and this time took the route via Banasandra. This route is 4 Kms longer than the earlier one, but the road to Banasandra is in better shape and is 6 kms. From there, the road to Turuvekere is in excellent shape and you can coast at 80-90 Kmph easily on the bike without issues. In terms of time it definitely is shorter. We reached Turuvekere and from there Yadiyur, and were at Swati for lunch by 1:30 PM.\n\nA quick lunch later, we took the right to Magadi after Kunigal. And were home around 3:45 PM. It was a slightly exhausting ride this time as being October the roads were full of dragonflies and crossing butterflies, and if you don’t watch out it can be a total massacre. I tend to keep an eye out and slow down just the bit when approaching a swarm in the middle of the road. This usually gives them enough time to make good their escape. Butterflies are a difficult beast though, some get disoriented and fly towards you, some just turn back even though you’ve just let them pass. But the constant attention they needed was draining.\n\nAll photos using iPhone SE. The route (click to open Google Maps):"
