        "text": "Prelude :\n\nAfter reading a bit about Hoysalas and their craftsmanship – it has been on to-do list to visit some of these temples, of course, other than Belur and Halebidu (Dwarasamudra). I came across many blogs on Oorsutoonaba about day trips to these phenomenal places, written by a Travel friend.\n\nA friend wanted to visit these places. I wasn’t able to join him on his first drive, thankfully he only visited 3 temples. We planned another Sunday drive to cover most of it. It was a 550km circuit covering 7 temples. This blog post was possible because of him.\n\n1. Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli\n\nThis is not a Hoysala place, it was built by the Western Ganga Dynasty in 8th -10th century period. And, it is a Jain temple. I stumbled upon this after reading a book on Hoysalas. Seeing the pictures, it was a must visit.\n\nKambadahalli (whose name in the Kannada literally translates to “village with pillar”) gets its name from the Brahmadeva pillar (Manasthambha) erected in front of the temple complex\n\nLocation : https://goo.gl/maps/Y6b4Mcugdim\n\nHow to Reach : https://goo.gl/maps/dXYCLbstVQ42\n\nIt is about 16kms & 20 minutes from NH48. The turnoff is 2 kms before Kirasave Toll (3rd toll from Nelamangala Exit), watch out for the “2 km to Toll Gate” Board. The main road is all okay, meandering around arid agricultural land. The last 1 km into Kambadahalli is narrow.\n\nPlace : Since this was our first stop, we were there at 720am. The place is very serene. It is a small place amidst houses and a Jain Mutt next door. Since we were early, there was nobody around. When we left at around 8am, the first tourist/religious group arrived.\n\n2. Nageshwara and Chennakeshava Temple, Mosale\n\nThis is a twin temple dedicated to Hari and Hara at the same place. Built by Veera Ballala II in 12th Century, it showcases that the Hoysalas were open to both faiths, as well as Jainism.\n\nLocation : https://goo.gl/maps/PheKQVbzAGq\n\nHow to Reach : https://goo.gl/maps/GnkFTQTSNu22\n\nWhen coming from Bangalore side, the turnoff is after you cross the Shantigrama Flyover (this comes after the 4th toll from Nelamangala). The road, again meanders around agricultural area till you hit the Hassan – Holenarasipura highway at Mosale. The road condition is okay. From Mosale, the approach to the temple is narrow but the road condition is fine.\n\nAlternatively, you can continue on NH48 till Hassan Bypass and turnoff.\n\nPlace : Again, surrounded around the village. The work done in both the single-structures is intrinsic and fabulous. When we were there, there was only 1 person inside and he was the guide, he explained about the carvings, roof, shikara. etc. It helps a lot if you hire the guide.\n\nNageshwara Temple\n\nChennakeshava Temple\n\n3. Lakshmi Devi Temple, Doddagadavalli\n\nThis is a temple situated very close to Hassan – Belur highway. This Hoysala temple was built earlier – in 11th century, by Vishnuvardhana. It is a unique temple with four shrines. It has a Kadamba influenced style as well.\n\nLocation : https://goo.gl/maps/78sW6fBKwFT2\n\nHow to Reach : https://goo.gl/maps/tcHExLWjsnD2\n\nIt is less than 3 kms from the Hassan – Belur Highway, the turn is easy to spot and the road to the temple is in decent condition. The last mile to the temple through Doddagadavalli Village is narrow.\n\nPlace : Located on the banks of a lake, it is a bigger temple compared to the previous two, we saw a lot of shikaras when we reached. There’s a big tree with lots of shade on one end. Inside the temple, some of the shrines are missing. There were only locals in the temple.\n\n4. Bucheshwara Temple, Koravangla\n\nThis is a small and pretty temple located off Hassan – Arsikere highway, again situated by the side of a Lake. The two shrines here are Shiva and Surya.\n\nThe temple was built in 1173 by a rich officer called Buci (Buchiraja), to celebrate the coronation of Hoysala King Veera Ballala II\n\nLocation : https://goo.gl/maps/F6agAXM7dKM2\n\nHow to Reach : https://goo.gl/maps/Bb5dJAZFVko\n\nWhen coming from Bangalore side, the turnoff is below Shantigrama Flyover (after the 4th toll from Nelamangala). The SH is in okay condition till Koravangala.\n\nIf you are coming from Hassan side, the turnoff is off Hassan – Arsikere highway – https://goo.gl/maps/4Qd4P6mBn5U2\n\nPlace : The entrance is from the side gate and the main gate remains locked usually. When we visited, there was a function happening in a hall opposite to the temple and hence there was some selfie crowd inside the temple (compare with the previous 3 empty ones). It was time consuming – waiting for them to leave and then get a clear shot. The outer courtyard is grassy and it would be a delightful sight in monsoon.\n\n5. Chennakeshava Temple, Haranhalli\n\nThis is another temple located on Hassan – Arsikere highway. This majestic looking temple is located in the center of Haranhalli town. It was built around 1236AD, well maintained among all the temples we visited so far.\n\nLocation : https://goo.gl/maps/UbUGTwcJ8c12\n\nHow to Reach : https://goo.gl/maps/XMUuBkQBH732\n\nSince it is located on Hassan – Arsikere highway itself, you can reach from both the ends. If you are coming from Bangalore side though, the fastest route would be to turnoff NH48 at CR Patna Bypass and take the Arsikere SH. The last mile to Haranhalli through the shortcut avoiding Arsikere is in okay condition.\n\nPlace : We reached here in the afternoon. The main gate was closed – we went around to check if there are other gates like in Koravangala, but there was none. On inquiring a villager, he went to one Naaggana’s house(closeby to the temple), got the keys and opened it for us. It was very hot and he did not let us wear socks too, so this was a quick visit hopping over burning hot surface.\n\n6. Ishvara Temple, Arsikere\n\nIt is located right in Arsikere town, small, yet magnificent temple. It was built in 1200AD, dedicated to Lord Shiva and is said to be one of the complex ones.\n\nLocation : https://goo.gl/maps/5hm3iF1n7LK2\n\nHow to Reach : https://goo.gl/maps/C6MwD3XmtHG2\n\nIt is hardly a kilometer from NH206, but you have to cross some narrow bazaar stretches in the town.\n\nPlace : We were there post lunch, hence were lazy to check it out completely. It is neither a small one nor a huge one, the structure looks complex, the hall looks wonderful. Again, located amidst houses, but there are 2 outer courtyards, hence is very spacious.\n\n7. Chennakeshava Temple, Aralaguppe\n\nThis beautiful temple which was built around 1250 during the rule of the Hoysala Empire King Veera Someshwara is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the temple is located inside the town and is well maintained. Infact, this was the cleanest among all the 7 temples that we visited."
