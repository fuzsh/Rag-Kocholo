        "text": "Lost temples of Karnataka: Kaidala & Seebi\n\nOverview:\n\nKaidala: Introducing the little known village in Tumkur District- Kaidala. This village is known to be the birth place of the great architect of the Hoysalas, Jakanachari. Jakanachari started his art work from the ChennaKeshava temple at Somnathpura, Mysore district. The sculptures were crafted by the Jakanacheri under the Hoysala king Narasimha and commander Soma. Impressed by his amazing craftsmanship, he won several contracts to be built under the Hoysalas in Hassan district, Chikamagalur district and Mandya district; the remains of which can be seen and admired today. One of the biggest pieces of his excellence came when he was involved in the contruction of the majestic Chennakeshava temple in Belur. It was during this construction of the Belur temple when Jakanachari's son Dankanachari, alleges that the main idol in the temple is defective. Jakanachari, clearly not impressed with this, challenges his son that if he is proved correct, he would cut off his right hand. On inspection of the idol, it was indeed found that the idol had a small cavity which was occupied by a frog and wet mud. Disappointed with his negligence, as promised, he cuts off his right hand. Dankanachari, on getting this news, immediately decides to work with his father on installation of a Chennakeshava temple in Kaidala, his native place. Jakanachari sculpts the idol with his left hand, and miraculously his right hand is restored. Hence the name of the place, which was initially Kridapura, was named Kaidala, 'Kai' means 'Hand' in Kannada.\n\nThe temple has a simple look as opposed to other temples of his times. But inside the temple is the breath taking idol of Chennakeshava which is far more impressive than the other temples. The intricate carvings make it look absolutely stunning. Also there is a hole on the wall through which the sunlight comes and directly hits the idol on certain days which is just amazing. No wonder a movie is also based on the life of Jakanachari.\n\nNext to this temple is another temple belonging to the Hoysala era, the Gangadheeshwara temple which was locked from outside. We just peeped inside through the grilled doors, we could only see some pillars with carvings.\n\nSeebi: Another 32 kms North west of Kaidala is the temple of Narasimha Swamy at Seebi. This place is known for its paintings on the beams and ceilings of this temple. The paintings depict the avatars of Vishnu and instances from the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Kaidala Narsimhaswamy temple is widely known and it is believed that the wishes are fulfilled by the God if asked with dedication. Food is also served in the temple premises. Photography is restricted within the temple though.\n\nHow to reach: Take the NH4 to Tumkur, before reching Tumkur, watch out for a left turn towards Shimoga and Gubbi. Turn left and continue for around 7 kms before taking a left turn towards Gulur. Kaidala is around 2 kms from Gulur.\n\nSeebi is situated on the National Highway 4. To reach there from Kaidala, drive back towards Gulur, from there head towards Tumkur town and proceed towards NH4 towards Sira. Watch out for boards on the left side showing directions for Seebi Narasimhaswamy temple. The temple is also visible from the highway on the right side while coming from Tumkur.\n\nReference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarashilpi_Jakanachari\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEEBI\n\nMap:\n\nView Larger Map\n\nSpecialties from Districts of Karnataka\n\nOverview: In a post-Covid world, people will not wish to travel far and wide pretty soon. However, they may wish to explore some good places in their neighborhood. While its very good to visit local attraction, its great if one can help buy local crafts and local food to help the artisans and boost the economy. Highlighting the specialties from each district of Karnataka: 1. Bagalkot: Aminagad in Hungund taluk is famous for a sweet savoury Karadantu, made out of edible gum, dry fruits and jaggery. Guledagudda Khana is a unique textile, and is a 4000 year old fabric, and is handloomed in the small town of Guledagudda. Ilkal sari is a traditional form of sari which is a common feminine wear in India. Ilkal saris are woven using cotton warp on the body and art silk warp for border and art silk warp for pallu portion of the sari. Amingad Kardant Shop Ilkal Saree Weaver 2. Bangalore Rural: Bangalore Rose Onion, having a GI indicator, is grown in 16 taluks of Bengaluru rural.\n\nTibetan Settlements in Karnataka\n\nOverview: I have always been overwhelmed with the welcoming smile and warmth of the Tibetan people. There are a few pockets in Karnataka where we can find Tibetan settlements, or we can call them 'Mini Tibet'. One of them is the popular Bylukuppe in Mysore district. The Namdroling Monastery of Nyingma, which is also popular as the Golden Temple, is the biggest monastery here. Further south of Bylukuppe is the Dhondenling settlement at Odeyarpalya in Chamarajanagar district, where few of the prettiest monasteries can be seen in the backdrop of the BR Hills. The biggest monastery here is the Dzogchen Monastery. Moving a few hundred kilometres towards North of Karnataka is the Doeguling Tibetan Settlement of Mundgod in Uttara Kannada district. One can see Tibetans chanting their prayers and living peacefully in these areas. The monasteries are a place where the Buddhists offer their prayers, so it is better to maintain silence while visiting these places. A fr\n\nA visit to my native place: The Village of Music, Rudrapatna\n\nOverview: Situated on the banks of the river Cauvery, Rudrapatna is a beautiful small village in Hassan District of Karnataka with rich history, and happens to be my ancestral village too. This is one of the places where the people from the Sankethi community initially settled around 700 years ago, and were instrumental in modelling this as a 'village of music' or 'Sangeetha Grama' as it is known today. The village is also known for its Sanskrit Paathashaala, at Shankara Math near the Rama temple, which is trying to keep the traditions alive in the village. Rudrapatna Rudrapatna Sankethi community is known for music, and this village has produced many Carnatic musicians like R.K. Suryanarayana, R.K. Srikantan, Rathnamala Prakash, R.K. Padmanabha and several others. The Tamboori shaped temple is a tribute to all the musicians from this village and was built under the leadership of Vidwan Shri RK Padmanabha in the 2000s.
