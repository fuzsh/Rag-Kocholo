        "text": "The Chennakesava temple situated in Belur in Chikmagalur, Karnataka is home to the Hoysala temples from the 11th and 13th century. This temple was built by the Hoysalas during their 300 years rule in Karnataka and took over 102 years to get completed.\n\nWhen you step inside the temple, you meet beautifully carved sculptures and monuments which show the best of Hoysala temple architecture. The name of the temple is derived from Chenna, which means beautiful and Kesava, which means Vishnu.\n\nChennakeshava Temple History\n\nVictory over Cholas of Tamil Nadu\n\nHistorians say that this temple was built by King Vishnuvardhana and completed by his grandson after 102 years because of its massive structures and intricate architecture. This masterpiece was built to celebrate King Vishnuvardhana’s win over the Chola dynasty of Tamil Nadu in the battle of Talakad. The Hoysalas annexed Gangavadi from the Cholas in this battle.\n\nThe temple was anciently named, Vijayanarayana and later given the name Chennakesava because of its beauty. It is situated on the banks of the Yagachi river in Belur.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO :\n\nTemple architecture\n\nThe main entrance of the temple consists of a Rajagopura which was built during the Hoysala Empire. Uniquely, all the temples of the Hoysala Empire have their Gods and Goddesses figurines facing east. Similarly, the Chennakesava God’s shrine also faces east of the temple. The shrine or the main temple is covered by two temples, one at the right named Kappe Channigraya temple and a small temple behind the Chennakesava temple called the Sowmyanaki temple. On the left of the shrine is the Ranganayaki temple. There are also two main pillars or sthambas named Garuda and Deepa sthambas which are situated at the left and right of the main temple respectively.\n\nGravity Pillar\n\nRight at the centre of the temple stands a tall pillar which is carved from a single piece of rock and stands on its own. It is thus, called the gravity pillar.\n\nTemple Doors\n\nThe beautiful temple has three entrances and all the three entrances have magnificent lady dwarpals carved on the walls that are exquisitely dressed with ornaments. As the Hoysala architecture has another history of its founder, there are structures of little boy Sala killing a beast. The story goes, one day; young boy Sala along with his master was visiting a temple in Angadi where a menacing beast approached them. The master in all anxiousness threw at him an iron rod and shouted “Poy sala” which means “strike Sala”. The brave boy killed the beast with the same iron rod.

The puja that goes on inside the temple once in the morning and evening is performed for 887 years.\n\nThe Main Sanctum :\n\nThe polished pillars and ceiling inside the The large navrang mandapam is one of its kind. The pillars differ in sizes and design patterns except for the 4 pillars at the centre crowned by bracket figures.

The beautifully ornamented 6 ft high idol of lord Vishnu has 4 hands, the upper 2 holding a discus and conch, while the lower 2 has a lotus and a mace. Idols of his consorts, Bhudevi and Sridevi can be seen on either sides.\n\nChennakeshva temple is the only functional Hoysala temple with pujas being performed both in the morning and evening. This tradition is being practiced for the last 887 years.\n\nBesides the main shrine, there are other smaller shrines namely the Kappe Chanigaraya Temple, The Veernarayan temple, Saumyanayaki Temple and Andal Ammanavara Temple.\n\nRegarded as one of the jewels of South Indian architecture. the temples have become rich repositories of ancient Hindu culture.\n\nThe sheer beauty of form, delicacy of workmanship and perfection of finish makes the Chennakeshva temple a must visit site on every tourist’s temple itinerary.\n\nHow To Reach:\n\nBy road- Belur is connected by buses to main cities like Mysore and Bangalore.
