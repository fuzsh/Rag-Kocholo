        "text": "ㅤ For the regular readers of my travel blog, you all know where this journey began. It was when I was truly inspired by the glory of an Architectural wonder, Hampi. Though Hampi is a very well-known prominent historic and architectural site in India, it didn’t stop me from sharing the little information I had along, with my unforgettable travel experience. That’s hugely because of the immense love and interest I hold towards History and Architecture. And today, that same passion has gotten me this long, writing a blog about one of the most beautiful, distinguished and yet largely forgotten architectural site, Shri Chandramouleshwara Temple, Unkal, Hubli.\n\nShri Chandramouleshwara Temple: In the incredible land of Karnataka, where Hoysala’s architecture is well deservingly seen as the pinnacle of art and workmanship, it should not be overlooked that Hoysalas were inspired and succeeded by another eminent kingdom The Chalukyas, whose contribution to Dravidian art was monumental. While their prominent constructions like Badami, Pattadakallu are celebrated till today, few of their beautiful constructions are quietly left behind just in history books. And this Chalukyan masterpiece, Shri Chandramouleshwara Temple, 900 years old from 12th Century is picked up from one such forgotten page of a History book.\n\nThe temple which enjoyed highest honours during 12th and 13th century gradually lost its significance and became nearly abandoned after the decline of Chalukyas, until when it was restored and kept minimal operational from the local Shaivas.\n\nLocation and Modes to Reach: Quite surprisingly this rare architectural site is located right in the urban area of Hubli city. In the Sai Nagar area of Hubli, on the banks on Unkal lake, just in 500mts inroads from Hubli-Dharwad NH67 from KLE college junction is this beautiful temple.\n\nTaking an auto or cab from 5KM away Hubli city junction, you can reach the place in 10mins. And travelling from Bangalore to Hubli which is 400KM away, or enroute Goa, this place is just 500mts of deviation from highway.\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/dRspwPz2ixURFcNo6\n\nHubli is the nearest railway station and cabs or autos can be hired from there too.\n\nThe temple is surrounded by large number of houses and there is no parking facility for more than 2 cars. You may have to park your vehicle few blocks away in main roads and walk back few metres.\n\nBest Time to Visit: With location very near to Hubli city junction, Shri Chandramouleshwara temple is accessible and good to visit throughout the year. Special poojas and functions are held during festivals and Maha Shivaratri is celebrated to grandeur.\n\nTemple stays open from 8:00AM to 6:00PM for all the days of a week.\n\nThe Classic of Chalukyas: Built in seclusion amidst thickly populated grounds, temple opens up with huge lounge space, making all the external noise disappear all of a sudden. The temple premise consist of one huge shrine constructed with utmost level skill and workmanship.\n\nTemple walls are constructed out of red granite stones with beautiful carvings of Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara all around with a square Garbhagriha at the centre which can be accessed from four cardinal directions. The particular carvings of Nataraja, Narasimha, dancing Ganesha, Sarasvati and Mahishasurmardini are definitely not to be missed.\n\nAnd inside the Garbhagriha lies, proud resident of temple Shri Chandramouleshwara . The sanctum is very delicately and beautifully carved out doubling up the beauty of idol in it, which had me stunned for nearly 5mins. The sanctum originally housed Chaturmukha Linga, which is kept right behind the plain Shivalinga, installed during later years.\n\nFor History, Art and Architecture lovers there are innumerable things to look at and enjoy here. May it be the Dwarapalas, Chauribearers, Jaladharas or Nandis, every stone is an excellent specimen for a mythic story and a proof on Chalukyan work skill. As this a travel blog for all, I’m keeping it minimum on words and advising the real interested people to visit the place and feel the magic 😊\n\nFacts to know with Things to know:\n\nUnlike most other temples, this temple doesn’t have a gopura. There are many folk tales around this including the one which says temple was constructed overnight and gopura couldn’t be completed.\n\nTemple is recognized, preserved and maintained by Archaeological Survey of India. And the entry is completely free.\n\nApart from Gopura, the temple has few other unfinished architecture, yet one of the most marvellous and a spectacular architecture by the Chalukyas. Half way done quarters around the temple are still a visual delight.\n\nThe temple once had huge open area around but is encroached by people now with nearly no place left. Temple resurrection act is still undergoing and don’t expect any of the basic facilities as of now.\n\nThe theories on why Chalukyas built this temple are two. One being to boast and showcase their wealth and success to their enemies and other being to purify their souls from the sin of killing innocent people in war. Neither of them have conclusive evidences.\n\nIf you are visiting the place during evening, don’t miss out lovely sunset views from scenic and serene Unkal lake, right behind the temple.\n\nTake Away: Just as in the architectural wonders like Hampi, Badami or Pattadakallu this place carries its own unique beauty and importance. For common eyes they might just look like another centuries old ancient temple. But in the eyes of a history and architecture lover this place is pure delight. Being usually less crowded, the magnificent architecture would soak you in pleasure of rich skill, workmanship and mythology in a serene atmosphere. And then the history of the uncommon land would cast its magic spell leaving you astonished.\n\nStructures might be forgotten but the stories are told forever😊"
