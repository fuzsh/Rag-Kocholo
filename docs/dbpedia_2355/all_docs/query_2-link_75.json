        "text": "The decline of the Gupta Age by the end of the 6 th century witnessed the birth of a paramount power in north India under the Vardhanas of Thaneswar. Harshavardhana, the prominent ruler of this dynasty, however, for most part of his life ruled from Kannauj. Soon after them, i.e., by the second half of the 7 th century, smaller kingdoms emerged in north, central and northwestern India. These royal houses played a very important role in the further development of Nagara style of temple architecture which was introduced by the Guptas in the 5 th-6 th centuries. The major dynasties that flourished at different periods of time between 7 th and 11 th centuries, and which gave immense patronage to temple building activities, were the Gurjara-Pratiharas (8 th-11 th century), the Kalachuris (8 th-13 th century), the Paramaras (9 th-14 th century), the Solankis (10-13 th century) and the Chandellas (10 th-13 th century). They, individually and collectively, contributed greatly to the growth of the Nagara architectural tradition but with regional variations. The early Pratihara temples at Gwalior, Gyaraspur and Baroli in Madhya Pradesh show various stages of the development of central Indian temple architecture. For example, the Teli-ka-Mandir (c. 9 th century) dedicated to Sakti cult at Gwalior, is the oldest Pratihara temple in this region (Pl. 31). It has a rectangular mula-prasada (mula means 'root', 'original', etc., the main shrine where deity is consecrated) with the oblong sikhara or spire. It is also significant to note that here the Dravida style of sikhara penetrated somewhat strangely in this heartland of India at this early stages. The topmost part of the sikhara has the barrel-vaulted or wagon-top roof called sala sikhara-the reminiscent of the Dravidian order. The stepped-pyramidal roof, also called as 'Phamsana roof', built above the porch, is also peculiar to this early temple in this region. The sides of the temple wall have three projections with intermediate recessions. Rudimentary form of 'Latina' sikharas (sikharas resembling 'sugar loaf' mass), kudu window arches and lotus medallions decorate the exterior. From this simple style of architecture developed Latina mula-prasadas with pradakshina-pathas, balconies with chajjas or overhanging eaves, mandapas or halls with open vedika (railing) for free transmission of air and light. The Phamsana, or gable roofs, were adorned with purna-kalasa or padma-kumbha capitals or finials fixed along the long axis of the gable roof. The later Pratiharas further developed the mula-prasada and its superstructure. The basic elements of the north Indian temples are found in these temples (Figs. 33, 34, 35a, 35b & 36). This development can be seen in the temples of Baroli and Gyaraspur in Madhya\n\nThis paper is a study and documentation of two temples of the Ikkeri Nayaka period in southwest India, the Rameshvara of Keladi and the Aghoreshvara of Ikkeri. The rise of the Ikkeri Nayakas, first as viceroys of the Vijayanagara Empire, then as one of its successor regimes, saw a new concentration of power in the western part of today's Karnataka state, as well as a new beginning for architectural patronage, the results of which have hardly been studied or documented so far. These two temples were very possibly the earliest and largest of the regime, founded in the first two capitals by the Nayakas themselves, and have been described by previous scholars as the most stylistically heterogeneous in the whole of south India. This paper contains the first ever architectural documentation of the two complexes, a study of their form, composition and stylistic emulation, and an attempt to find the meaning and pattern in their designs, including the architectural and other processes that led to the heterogeneity. The central idea discussed in the conclusion is that of the politics of architectural revivalism, seen in the designs, design sources, and varying heterogeneity of both the temples, which appears to have been related to the political and economic developments of the time.\n\nOrissan temples stand among the finest examples of Nagara style architecture. It flourished between the seventh and the thirteenth centuries CE. The earliest among the typical Orissan temples are, however, dated in the middle of the 8 th century CE. These are concentrated in Bhuvaneshwar and Puri. The Orissan temple architecture reached its zenith during the most elaborate construction of the Sun Temple at Konark in the middle of the thirteenth century. There are several variations in the plan as well as the elevation adopted by the Orissan master-architects, the sthapatis, engaged in constructing temples called in local language deul; the term emerged from Sanskrit term devalaya (house of deva). There are three types of these temples: 1) Rekha-deul, 2) Pidha-deul and 3) Khakhara-deul. One of these is called Rekha-deul, since its sikhara or spire is linear, 'Rekha' meaning linear or straight and 'deul' meaning temple. The two together means 'the temple with spire or sikhara designed in straight linear form' as opposed to the Central Indian types where the sikhara was curvilinear. In the Rekha-deul the sikhara was straight, like a vertical line, almost upto the top, only at the top-end it took an inward curvature to touch the griva or neck. In the Pidha-deul, ('pidha' means chauki in Hindi, a low flat wooden tablet to sit on) the sikhara has tiers of diminishing pidhas or platform. It is also called as jagamohana. It is in fact the mandapa raised in front of the sanctum as a separate but connected structure. In the Khakhara-deul [the word Khakhar has been derived from kakharu (pumpkin, gourd)], the top looks like a gourd or barrel-shaped roof. It may, therefore, be seen that the classification is based only upon the plan and shape of the sikhara of the temples and no so much on the basal platform, the pidha, etc. The Rekha and Pidha-deul stand on a common platform known as pishta, same as pitha.\n\nThe Early Western Chalukyas (535-757 CE), who ruled over the parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra not only initiated rock-cut architecture but also built structural temples at their capitals at Aihole, Badami and Pattadakkal-all in the Bijapur district of modern Karnataka. They used locally available soft sandstone for building their temples. These are usually quoted as examples of Vesara style of temples. Aihole, the first capital of the Early Western Chalukyans, has several examples of initial attempts made towards the making of structural temples. These early abodes of gods, modest in their appearance, were generally mandapa type structures with pillared halls and flat roofs. They also followed the basic concept of the Hindu temple architecture, i.e., the garbha-griha fronted by the pillared mandapa, though, in different style. In course of time, this simple plan was elaborated and the garbha-griha was developed into a full-fledged mūla-prasada with its distinct sikhara. However, the sikhara, in many examples, lacks originality and also elegance. More structural elements were added to the mūla-prasada in the form of an antarala, closed sabha-mandapa and mukha-mandapa. The sanctum was provided with a pradakshina-patha making it the sandhara type. In addition to the Dravida and Nagara sikharas, a third one which is the hybrid form of the above two sikharas, known as Vesara, originated in the Deccan during this early period. Among the earliest temples at Aihole, the temples of the Konti-gudi group and the Ladh Khan Temple exhibit simplest plan and elevation (Pl. 61, Fig. 64). The Konti-gudi group, consisting of three individual shrines, has the garbha-grihas attached to the rear wall and the pillared open verandahs in front. It is, therefore, much different from the Central Indian Nagara temples. Massive pillars support the roofs of the shrines. Since the sanctum was attached to the rear wall these shrines do not have pradakshina-pathas (circumambulatory passages). Therefore, they are known as the nirandhara shrines. The Lad Khan Temple, which stands on a moulded adhishthana, comprises the garbha-griha abutting the rear wall, the mandapa enshrining the Nandi (the bull vehicle of Siva), and the pillared portico in front. The mandapa walls in front of the sanctum have latticed windows which allow free passage of light and air. Over the Nandi mandapa is a small shrine with high reliefs of the deities on the outer walls."
