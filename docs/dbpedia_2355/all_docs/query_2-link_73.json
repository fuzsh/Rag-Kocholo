        "text": "Know your neighbourhood-5: Bannerghatta Road\n\nOverview: Bannerghatta forest is perhaps the most popular of all in Bangalore. It is a well visited tourist destination and offers wild life safaris as well. Just along the Bannerghatta forest is a cluster of villages like Ragihalli and Thattekere which is developing into a cyclers' paradise with photographers getting to spot several species of birds especially during winters.\n\nRagihalli Road\n\nAt the gate of Bannerghatta is the Champakadhama temple which was built during the Hoysalas in 1257 CE. He built temples in the southern parts of the city like Anekal, Jigani and Haragadde. Several Kannada and Tamil inscriptions dating between 12th and 13th centuries can be seen all around the temple walls and floor. One such important inscription at the entrance wall of the temple mentions the name of a place Juguni (today's Jigani), which is described as a chief Agrahara of Gangavadi Nadu. A series of Atmabali stones can also be seen a few metres in front of the temple. Another inscription mentions the name 'Vanniyaraghattam', which became Bannerghatta. The Champakadhama temple is also considered as 'Madhya Narayana Kshetra' of Bangalore District. A short trek uphill from Champakadhama takes one to Suvarnamukhi, a beautiful pond which is believed to have medicinal properties. There is also a temple dedicated to Lakshminarasimha Swamy near the pond.\n\nBannerghatta National Park\n\nChampakadhama Temple\n\nInscription mentioning 'Juguni'\n\nSuvarnamuki Pond\n\nInside the wilderness of Bannerghatta forest, several Megalithic burial sites have been found and can still be traced near Ragihalli area. The burial sites are believed to be more than 3000 years old. The local Irula tribes still bury the dead in the same manner as was followed by their ancestors, by placing slab of rocks over the dead and covering the stone by smaller stones. Mysterious circular network of stones can also be spotted near Suvarnamukhi near Bannerghatta which may also date to Iron Age.\n\nMysterious Stone Circles\n\nPre-Historic Site\n\nHulimavu: The village of Hulimavu was earlier known as Amrapura as per the inscriptions found locally, later started to be known as Hulimavu, which translates to ‘sour mango’. The pre-historic cave at Hulimavu is several thousand years old where sages are known to have meditated. A legend says that Hulimavu was once under the king of Sarakeya(today’s Sarakki) and the king built the Kodandarama temple in the 17th century which was later renovated.in the 18th century. The natural cave at Hulimavu is a prehistoric dwelling and some Ash mounds were seen around the cave. Legend says that this was a place where sages used to meditate. Hulimavu also has an ancient Someshwara temple, renovated during the post-Vijayanagara times. Outside the temple in the courtyard, a broken image of Surya with Ganga features can be seen.\n\nHulimavi Cave temple\n\nHulimavu Someshwara Temple\n\nHulimavu Lake\n\nBilekahalli: In the midst of the crowded Bilekahalli just 2 kms north of Hulimavu is home to the 11th century Someshwara temple built by the Cholas. A part of the original structure is intact but is surrounded by a new set of walls.\n\nArekere: Just off Bannerghatta Road is a minor reserve forest called the Doresanipalya Reserve forest of around 40 hectares.\n\nGottigere: To the south of Hulimavu is the area of Gottigere, where one could see a beautiful Kalyani near Gali Anjaneyaswamy temple. This Kalyani has been now covered due to Metro construction.\n\nBilekahalli Someshwara Temple\n\nGottigere Kalyani\n\nDoresanipalya Forest\n\nSpecialties from Districts of Karnataka\n\nOverview: In a post-Covid world, people will not wish to travel far and wide pretty soon. However, they may wish to explore some good places in their neighborhood. While its very good to visit local attraction, its great if one can help buy local crafts and local food to help the artisans and boost the economy. Highlighting the specialties from each district of Karnataka: 1. Bagalkot: Aminagad in Hungund taluk is famous for a sweet savoury Karadantu, made out of edible gum, dry fruits and jaggery.

Bangalore Rural: Bangalore Rose Onion, having a GI indicator, is grown in 16 taluks of Bengaluru rural.\n\nTibetan Settlements in Karnataka\n\nOverview: I have always been overwhelmed with the welcoming smile and warmth of the Tibetan people. There are a few pockets in Karnataka where we can find Tibetan settlements, or we can call them 'Mini Tibet'. One of them is the popular Bylukuppe in Mysore district. The Namdroling Monastery of Nyingma, which is also popular as the Golden Temple, is the biggest monastery here. Further south of Bylukuppe is the Dhondenling settlement at Odeyarpalya in Chamarajanagar district, where few of the prettiest monasteries can be seen in the backdrop of the BR Hills. The biggest monastery here is the Dzogchen Monastery. Moving a few hundred kilometres towards North of Karnataka is the Doeguling Tibetan Settlement of Mundgod in Uttara Kannada district. One can see Tibetans chanting their prayers and living peacefully in these areas. The monasteries are a place where the Buddhists offer their prayers, so it is better to maintain silence while visiting these places.

This is one of the places where the people from the Sankethi community initially settled around 700 years ago, and were instrumental in modelling this as a 'village of music' or 'Sangeetha Grama' as it is known today. The village is also known for its Sanskrit Paathashaala, at Shankara Math near the Rama temple, which is trying to keep the traditions alive in the village. Rudrapatna Rudrapatna Sankethi community is known for music, and this village has produced many Carnatic musicians like R.K. Suryanarayana, R.K. Srikantan, Rathnamala Prakash, R.K. Padmanabha and several others. The Tamboori shaped temple is a tribute to all the musicians from this village and was built under the leadership of Vidwan Shri RK Padmanabha in the 2000s.
