        "text": "One of the noted temples of this village is Chennakeshava Temple, built by the Hoysalas in the 13th century. This architectural beauty is built on a four-feet high jagati (platform). It has a garbhagriha, sukanasi and navaranga. The garbhagriha is surmounted by well-carved tower. The Temple has an attractive entrance porch with verandas on both its sides. Don’t forget to look at the rail parapet consisting of six friezes depicting elephants, horsemen, scroll works and seated yakshas. The mythological friezes narrate stories of Ramayana and Bhagavad Gita. The lowest friezes depict wars fought by the Hoysalas to build their empire. Below the panels are images of various deities. A staggering number of these images are of Vishnu in his various avatars. In many ways, this Temple is similar to temples of Halebidu.\n\nWe rarely find the names of architect in the temples they create. But this Temple has the signature of the sculptor, Honoja engraved in one of the panels. Other panels have his initials ‘Ho’ engraved on them. Attached to south wall of Chennakeshava is a Narasimha Temple. It houses a 2-feet tall idol of Ugra Narasimha in a seated position. This mesmerising idol cannot be found anywhere else in the country.\n\nAralaguppe is also host to another temple of repute. Kalleshvara Temple was built around 9th century and is an exquisite structure. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this Temple is one of the finest examples of Western Ganga art. The intricately-designed navaranga of this Temple attracts people from afar. The door jamb of the Temple has a carved image of Goddess Gajalakshmi, with elephants showering her with flowers from either side. The central ceiling has nine panels and also has remarkable figurines of ashta dikpalakas, supported by four pillars. The panel also has a four-handed dancing Shiva, and a four-tusked elephant (gaja) carrying Lord Indra on its back and his consort Sachi. This sculpture, although common in Nolamba architecture, is considered to be amongst the best in the State.\n\nBut sadly, Kalleshvara Temple finds itself in a state of neglect. Damaged and broken idols can be found scattered in and around the Temple. But the villagers do put in their efforts to keep up the beauty of the structure. The village of Aralaguppe also encourages all art forms like Yakshagana, Dollu kunitha, Kamsale and so on by performing in various parts of the country.\n\nAralaguppe is an interior village and doesn’t have any bus facilities. But passenger trains travelling from Bengaluru to Arasikere stop here. When travelling by road, drive to Kibbanahalli Cross from Tumakuru-Tiptur Road. Take left to reach Banasandra and then head straight for four km to reach Aralaguppe. You can also hire autos from Banasandra."
