A brief timeline of its development is as follows:\n\nCommissioned by King Vishnuvardhana\n\nHoysala King Vishnuvardhana ascended to power in 1110 CE. In 1117 CE, he built the Chennakeshava temple on the banks of the Yagachi River in Belur, an early Hoysala capital.\n\nBuilt by Three Generations\n\nThe temple, which was built over three generations and took an impressive 103 years to complete, reflects the rising luxury, political power, and deep spiritual dedication to Sri Vaishnavism.\n\nVishnuvardhana’s descendants completed the Hoysaleswara Temple in 1150 CE and other temples, such as the Chennakesava Temple in Somanathapura, in 1258 CE. These temples are located about 200 kilometres apart.

Its structure and design are as follows:\n\n1. Ekakuta Vimana Design\n\nImage Source: Shutterstock\n\nThe Chennakeshava temple Belur is designed in the Ekakuta Vimana style, which is characterised by a single shrine.
