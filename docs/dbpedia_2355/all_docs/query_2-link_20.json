        "text": "Little is known about a dynasty that ruled for over 300 years from Hemavathi in present day Andhra Pradesh. The Nolambas were minor rulers who enjoyed the patronage of the powerful Rashtrakutas. They were weakened by the Gangas and eventually overpowered by the Cholas. Three grand temple complexes are all that remain of the glory of this dynasty written off from history text-books. These are the Kalleshwara Temple at Aralaguppe, the Bhoganandishwara Temple at Nandi and the Ramalingeshwara Temple at Avani. The Nolambas were Shaivites and this explains why the temples they built were dedicated to Shiva only.\n\nHaving visited the temples at Aralaguppe and Nandi, I decided to drive to Avani last weekend. It is just 32 km from Kolar and the highway till Kolar is superb. The drive through smaller roads thereafter is also refreshing because of the scenery – rocky hills protecting emerald green fields. Avani is a small village today but has a history that transcends time. Valmiki is believed to have is ashram there and Sita after being banished from Ayodhya spent her time in Avani. Sita is even believed to have given birth to her twin sons in a room atop the hill which is in the middle of the village. The hill is now popular with those fond of trekking and the village is inundated with adventure enthusiasts during the weekends. The name of the village ‘Avani’ means earth and alludes to the fact that Sita was found in a field by Janaka who then adopted her. There are many places across India and Nepal believed to be the location of Valmiki’s Ashram and it is impossible to ascertain which one is the actual one. Sita is also believed to have ended her life here by entering into the earth, another reason why this place is named so. Every other rock, structure, water body or hill in and around the village has a story associated with the Ramayana!\n\nThe Ramalingeshwara Temple complex is at the foot of the hill. A huge gateway sans a tower leads to the temple complex. The early 10th century temple has many shrines, each housing a linga. The four major shrines are one each for Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. The priest told us that these Shiva-lingas were installed by Rama and his brothers in order to beg forgiveness from Lord Shiva for fighting with Rama’s children – Lava and Kusha.\n\nThere are other minor shrines, such as those for Anjaneya, Vali and Sugriva. There are lingas scaterred across the compound and a couple of mantapas also. There’s an unusual mantapa called ‘ganji mantapa’ which is where gruel was served to devotees. There is a mantapa housing the navagraha (9 planets according to Hindu Astrology) and another one housing a nandi (bull, vehicle of Shiva).\n\nThe Ramalingeshwara Temple is considered as the main one. All the rituals are carried out here. There is a shrine dedicated to Parvathi attached to this. The goddess is known here as Seetaparvathi. The plan of the temple is typical and has a garbhagriha, an antarala and a navaranga. The outer wall is decorated moderately with well carved sculptures.\n\nThe Lakshmanalingeshwara Temple is the most ornate and houses the largest linga. The Cholas and Vijayanagara Rulers have added elements to the original Nolamba structure. This temple too has a garbhagriha, an antarala and a navaranga. The navaranga has four well carved pillars in the centre depicting dancers and musicians. These four pillars hold up a ceiling with nine panels carved with Uma-Maheshwara surrounded by the ashtadikpalakas (Gods of the 8 directions). The Shatrughneshwara Temple is considered as the oldest structure and is similar to the Lakshmaneshwara Temple in terms of plan but in addition has an ornate entrance gateway. The external decorative elements for all shrines include five mouldings ornamented with friezes of elephants, lions, yali, makara above which are wall pilasters and reliefs of yakshas, images of Shiva, Vishnu and Ganesha. The tower atop the garbhagriha is reminiscent of the Bhoganandishwara Temple and is pyramidal and tiered.\n\nThis temple complex built over 10 centuries ago inspires awe in spite of not being an architectural marvel because of its simple understated elegance. Head to Avani for a lesson in history, mythology and to acquaint yourself with the Nolambas. It’s better to trek up the hill early in the morning or late afternoon. You can spend the sunny morning in the Ramalingeshwara Temple complex and the Avani Sringeri Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sharada Peetham. It is better to carry food and water. Do ask the locals for tales associated with their village. Like me, if you reach at an odd time unsuitable to trek up the hill, you could explore the ancient temples in Kolar, Koti Lingeshwara and Kurudu Male instead.\n\nAlso read: Bhoganandeeshwara takes your Breath Away"
