        "text": "If you ever think you have had enough, just read the history books. There is always a lesson History holds for the future. It’s fair to say either a dynasty, a great emperor, statesman or a genius are all made by history than they make history. But there are certain times when the pages in the history books are rewritten by few legends. Sri Chennakeshava Temple at Kaidala, Tumkur is for sure one such legendry place which stands as an epitome of a legendry sculptor’s masterclass.\n\nAny history or architecture fan would have never missed to hear the name, Amarashilpi Jakanachari. This very talented sculptor was the mastermind behind the most of the famous sculptures, temples and architecture marvels for Kalyani Chalukyas and Hoysalas. Of all his outstanding workmanship, this temple at Kaidala is the most special one. To start with, this is the hometown of this great man and the main idol was carved with just one hand. Yes, literally single-handedly.\n\nSo, here is a small blog with some fascinating historical facts, much of the information about the place, reasons what makes it special and few other details a traveller would look for.\n\nHow to reach? Even with a great history behind, the temple is not very well known with travellers. Its quite an offbeat place, which in turn makes it less crowded and a peaceful destination.\n\nThe temple is 9kms from Tumkur city centre. Travel on Tumkur-Kunigal SH33 for 8kms to reach a small town, Gulur. Take right and travel further for one KM to reach Sri Chennakeshava temple just by 100mts to the road side. The place is accessible even with HMVs with quite good roads. If you are travelling on Bangalore-Shivamogga route, the place is worth the visit.\n\nBy Bus: There are number of private and government buses between Tumkur and Kunigal at regular intervals. Getting down at Gulur you can hire an autorickshaw or even take a good walk through the village farmlands to reach the temple.\n\nBest Time to Visit: The good roads leading to the temple makes the place accessible throughout year. No much trouble in it. I would personally suggest the evening hours. The golden hours with peaceful and divine vibes is something worth to look for.\n\nTemple Timings: 8.30 AM to 12.30 PM and 6.30 PM to 8.30 PM.\n\nOn Tuesdays, Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays: 10.30 AM to 2.30 PM and 5.30 PM to 8.30 PM.\n\nWhat to expect? Very much like the many precious architectures of Karnataka, it is a Dravidian style temple built in 1150AD, dedicated to Lord Vishnu in the form of Sri Chennakeshava. The temple holds that enduring legacy of Dravidian Architecture.\n\n⠀The temple wall along with the main gopuram, encloses main structure at the centre with few other small and beautiful mandapams inside. The open area around the main temple is cleanly maintained and is truly spread of peace.\n\nThe masterpiece of artwork is still the Chennakeshava statue inside the temple which is the exact replica of the Belur Chennakeshava statue. Sculpted in a black stone, the status is 6ft tall and the amount of details & intricacy is truly amazing. Everything about the statue is as perfect as it could be. The details in clothes, jewellery and in every part is so intimately carved making it one marvellous piece of artwork. The detailed carving goes as small as 1mm and yet never miss the perfection. The brass prabhavali surrounding the statue is richly decorated with Dashavathara’s carvings. I believe the beauty of this statue can never be put into words but that one complete sight of this epic sculpture is a truly the one to behold.\n\n⠀The outer architecture is quite simple yet very pleasing. The carvings on walls and pillars are minimal but very detailed. It can serve as a really peaceful destination to spend some time along with family and your loved ones. Evenings are the best times with the vibrant backgrounds of sunset. The temple falls behind in the grandeur of the Belur Chennakeshava temple. But it has the most important thing of all, the peace. The pillars are beautifully carved and sculptures adorn them.\n\nThe Legend of Kaidala\n\nKaidala, formerly known by the name Kreedikapura is the birthplace of AmaraShilpi Jakanachari, who is considered to be as one of the legendary sculptors in India till date. Jakanachari with the passion on art and sculpture leaves behind his pregnant wife and travels far and wide following his passion. Over the time he finds shelter under various kings of many prestigious kingdoms. He returns the favour by sculpting beautiful statues and constructing wonderful temples and thus giving the fame for the King and the Kingdom. But his very own family had been forgotten. The price he had pay for his utmost fame and achievement.\n\nAround 11th century he reaches Hoysala kingdom where one of the most influential rulers of Indian History, Vishnuvardhana commissioned the work of Chennakeshava temple in Belur for which Jakanachari agrees in sculpting the main idol of Vishnu. The temple was said to be one of the most ambitious projects of Vishnuvardhana and Hoysala kingdom.\n\nYears later around 1140AD, Jakanachari son Dankanachari leaves home in search of his father. Just like his father, Dankanachari had mastered the art of sculptors. On the day before the Chennakeshava idol has to be installed in Belur, Dankanachari reaches the place. After examining the main statue, he claims that there is a flaw in the idol. Jakanachari refuses to accept that there could be a blemish and proclaims that he will cut off his own hand if a flaw is found.\n\nAfter examining the idol in presence of all court members and artists of the kingdom, it was found the statue was covered with sandal paste and the paste had dried up everywhere except in the navel area of the idol. More surprisingly, they found a live frog living in the sand and water nestled inside the cavity. Jakanachari, keeping up to his words cuts his hand for the flaw that went unnoticed by him. Hence the statue become famous as ‘Kappe Channigaraya’ (Kappe means Frog in Kannada). The inscriptions on this can be seen in the Belur temple.\n\nBut the legendry sculptor was just not done yet. At his age around 80s, Jakanachari determines strongly to make up for his mistake and gets a vision to construct a temple at his home town. He comes back to Kreedikapura, and starts sculpting the idol of Chennakeshava with only one hand and just like a replica of the one in Belur. Dankanachari, was revealed to be his son and now assists his father in construction of the temple. Within years, father and son duo complete the work leaving behind one of the most intimidating sculpture of all time😊\n\nThere is even a popular myth amongst the localities saying Jakanachari got back his hands after the installation of Chennakeshava idol in the temple and this giving the name to the place Kaidala (The giver of hand).\n\nLeaving that myth aside, the temple and the idol of Chennakeshava is one fascinating place for any history and architecture lovers to visit. It is an embodiment of what the human determination can achieve.\n\nNearby Attractions:\n\nKunigal Lake: Who would have not heard the famous folk song ‘moodal Kunigal kere’? Well, the place is not a fiction and it truly exists😉. Travel from Kaidala towards Kunigal for 30kms to reach the twin lakes of Kunigal famous for its beautiful views and colourful sunsets.\n\nShivagange Hills: If you are travelling towards Bangalore, you come across another sacred centre with historical background, Shivagange. It is popularly known as Dakshina Kashi and serves as one of the best one-day trekking spot.\n\nNamadaChilume & Devarayanadurga: If you happen to find more time, you can visit two of the most beautiful places in Tumkur, NamadaChilume and Devarayanadurga. These two places are like the whole package any traveller would look for. In the middle of lush green state reserve forest, these two marks a perfect one-day outing spot offering nature, adventure, trekking, hiking, history, temples and beautiful sunset views.\n\nTake-Away: Apart from the fabulous history it holds, Sri Chennakeshava Temple at Kaidala is also a kind of place which gives you that sense of satisfaction and relief in your visit and contentment of witnessing a historic marvel. There are no grand decorated arches, no long queues or not much noise even. It’s simple, serene and peaceful.\n\n⠀At the end, the temple serves it’s purpose. There is that peace of mind you would want to find whenever you visit a temple. Afterall, the sanctity of a temple is not in its religion but in the abiding faith and peace it holds❤️"
