        "text": "There is a theory that while from Pallavas to Chalukyas there was a sculptural and architectural continuity in Hindu temple building tradition but Hoysalas deviated from it and the tradition came to a stop. Vijayanagara then once again picked up the temple as developed in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe theory is very obviously wrong. Let me cite some reasons first:There ‘break in the continuity’ that happened, happened with the Kalyani or the Later Chalukyas who had their capitals at Kalyan in Bidar district and also Lakkundi in Gadag. This ‘break’ is nothing but an innovation in the building of the temple shikhara. The style is called Vesara which deviates from the Dravida tradition and Nagara tradition too, combining some elements of both. Hoysala did not innovation in plan or profile of the temple. While most of the Hoysalas are star-stellate structures, the style was actually invented by the Chalukyas, who were making a few experiments and finally arrived at its finality in the Dambal, Dodabasappa temple with a completely circular garbha-griha with a perfect star.\n\nSculpturally too, there is nothing new that the Hoysala do, except doing everything in profusion. But even in this they were pre-empted by the Chalukyas and they just continued to do the inventions made by the Chalukyas more regularly and more profusely. For the Mallikarjuna temple at Kuruvatti has some of the most exquisite madanikas and bracket figures found anywhere in the Karnata Dravida tradition. Similarly, the Kakatiyas too boasted great temples, including the recently made famous Ramappa temple, with exquisite bracket figures or the Sarpa Kanyas, (Naga Kanyas) a precursor of the exquisite Hoysala Madanikas to come.\n\nThe massive doorways with beautifully carved lintels for which the Hoysalas are famous, like the Great Chennakeshava temple, Belur was also something not their invention or their monopoly either. The Great Mahadeva Temple, Itagi, Koppal hosts some of the greatest monolithic doorways and lintels with many concentric layers of frames. The same is true of diminutive but extremely normative temples of Kashi Vishvesvara and Surya Narayana at Lakkundi.\n\nLathe turned pillars were of course the invention of the Chalukyans and once again not the Hoysalas, who just continued the Karnata Dravida tradition, or the Vesara tradition invented by the Chalukyas. There are just far too many temples that host it in their absolute beauty, the most memorable for me being the Kalleshvara Temple, Bagali.\n\nThe ornate pillars of the inner courtyard like the ones found at Chennakeshava Belur and Hoysalesvara, Halebidu were also pre-empted by the pillars of Someshvara Temple, Gadag and the Mahadeva Temple, Itagi.\n\nThe only two innovations of the Hoysala art are: The conversion of the lower parts of the jangha, or the main outer profile of the temple into six to nine friezes or pattas of real and mythical animals along with floral scrolls. Almost all great Hoysala temples sport these bands: elephant frieze, horse frieze, peacock frieze, yali frieze and many other floral friezes. This, to my knowledge, is not seen earlier in the Chalukyan art.\n\nThe invention of the secondary eave, or chhajja in the jangha. In many great Hoysala temples like the great Chennakeshava, Somnathapura, there are two eaves, one shadowing the figures of the great deities, and the other one above that, smaller and enclosing a simple row of rathas, sometimes empty, sometimes full. Apart from these two innovations Hoysalas did not deviate from their predecessors, the Chalukyas did.\n\nOne significant aspect in which the Chalukyans differed from their predecessors I have already discussed. Another significant aspect in which they differed was the manner in which they made sculpture indistinguishable from architecture sometimes. Thus in various Chalukyan temples you will find various parts of the temple, particularly in the shikhara and the shuka nasika that are actually technically sculpture but do play the part of an architectural element. This is why Gerard Foekema called it ‘architecture decorated with architecture’.\n\nEven these do not constitute a ‘break’ in my view, just a few innovations. In iconography there is absolutely no ‘break’ in the Hoysala or either the Chalukyan sculpture. The ayudhas, the permutation of hands and ayudhas, the poses, the hastas all follow the scriptures, the Agamas, as do the Pallava sculpture or the Chola sculpture. Visually there may be some deviations, but in terms of iconography, symbolism and meaning there are none.\n\nOne difference that I discern, and which might differentiate Hoysala sculpture from its predecessors is the return of the tree. For not since Mauryan art, do we see shalabhanjikas standing or dallying demurely around a shala tree quite often. After the Mauryan art, and some of the early Gupta art, the tree almost altogether disappears from the main stage of the Hindu sculpture, except in Odisha which was going on a different but exquisite sculptural tangent of its own. Even in the north with all the outburst of sculptural creativity that Khajuraho is, there are no trees above the demure ladies that we see everywhere. It is just the human figure. The same is true about the Solanki and the Paramara art, in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan.\n\nBut in Hoysalas, we once again see not just the Madanikas, not just the chauri bearers playing under the thick canopy of trees, but also the great gods like Ganesha dancing with abandon under thick foliage of a verdant tree. In that respect, the Hoysalas brought back the earthy playfulness that was characteristic of the mundane iconography in Mauryan art.\n\nThe reason that the Hoysalas hit a dead end is not only internal. Of course they had explored all the possibilities of filling a temple surface with sculpture and musing and forging architecture with sculpture but they stopped simply because the Delhi Sultanate destroyed them. When the Dwarasamudra was destroyed by Malik Kafur, the Karnata Dravida tradition in a way came to an end. In the north and central Karnataka the Deccan sultanates kept razing Hindu temples to the ground for the next many centuries and in the south, for the lack of patronage no new architect and sculptor guilds could be sustained."
