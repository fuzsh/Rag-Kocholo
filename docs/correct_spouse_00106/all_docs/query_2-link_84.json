        "text": "WILMINGTON, NC (WECT) â€“ One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Galeotti, 30, has announced that she and her husband will soon be divorcing.\n\nThe actress, known for playing the character Haley James Scott, broke the news on her website Monday, writing:\n\n\"As most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life. In fact, the only reason I'm saying anything about this at all is because you'll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me 'Bethany Joy Lenz' again. I'm sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time. I feel immensely humbled and grateful that God works all things for the good of those who love Him.\n\nLove,\n\nBJL\"\n\nGaleotti married Michael in 2005, and they welcomed their daughter in Feb. 2011.\n\nLocally-filmed One Tree Hill finished wrapped its series finale in November, and the ninth season began airing in January.\n\nThe show's final episode is scheduled to air April 4."
