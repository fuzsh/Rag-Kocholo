        "text": "14.3K\n\nFour years after his divorce from Bethany Joy Lenz, Michael Galeotti was found dead in his Glendale home, aged only 31. Many speculations were made about the reason for his untimely death, mainly because of his drinking habits, which were the source of many rumors over the years.\n\nHowever, as it turns out, the real reason for his death was atherosclerosis heart disease.\n\nFollow this article for more information about Bethany Joy Lenz’s ex-husband who died a tragic death!\n\nMichael Galeotti: Early Life\n\nImage source: Google\n\nThe early life of Michael Galeotti was pretty conventional. He was born in 1984 to Sheila and Mike Galeotti, middle-class parents who had normal jobs. His father reportedly owns a wine cellar and his mother was a high school teacher. There are also rumors that his father used to be a member of the United States Marine Corps and that he served in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2002, Michael graduated from high school and joined an indie rock band called Enation short of a year later. From a young age, he was passionate about music, and he became the main keyboardist of the band.\n\nIn 2004, he took a further step in his career and joined Jersey, the Disney television show. However, later on, his career was only music-oriented.\n\nHis Marriage to Bethany Joy Lenz\n\nMichael Galeotti met his future wife, Bethany Joy Lenz, in 2005. They started dating shortly after, but their dating status didn’t last for long. Their marriage quickly followed on the 31st of December of the same year.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in Hillsboro, Oregon in a small family wedding. According to rumors, the guests invited to the wedding were less than 75.\n\nThe marriage was fine for the first couple of years, but Michael’s excessive drinking habits started causing issues shortly before Bethany became pregnant with her first child. After the birth of their first child in 2011, the marriage deteriorated, and the couple divorced in 2012.\n\nAt the time, Bethany announced the divorce on her personal blog because, according to her, she didn’t want the fans confused when she reappeared as Bethany Joy Lenz.\n\nAfter the couple’s divorce, Bethany got custody of their daughter, Maria Rose.\n\nMichael Galeotti’s Career\n\nImage source: Google\n\nThe first serious step in Michael Galeotti’s career was joining Enation, the indie rock band founded by brothers Richard and Jonathan. The band was already full when he joined, with prominent members like Amber Sweeney and Daniel Sweatt.\n\nThe band established itself successfully in Washington, then moved to Tennessee to expand its fan base. However, the real breakthrough for the band was in 2008 when they released the World-In-Flight album. It was arguably their best album, and it received the most attention and buzz.\n\nIn fact, one of the album’s songs got featured on One Tree Hill, the show that Galeotti’s wife, Bethany Joy Lenz, starred in.\n\nUnfortunately, Michael decided to leave the band between 2011 and 2012, and he pursued a job in his family’s wine cellar.\n\nThe Tragic Death of Michael Galeotti\n\nImage source: Google\n\nMichael Galeotti’s life came to an early, untimely end in 2016 when he was only 31 years old. According to people close to him, his health was deteriorating during the last few days leading up to his death.\n\nHe paid a visit to a near hospital a few days before his death because he felt ill, and he was apparently diagnosed with diverticulitis and high blood pressure. He stayed in the hospital for a couple of days, then got discharged.\n\nUnfortunately, he didn’t live for long after that. According to his friends, he went MIA after the hospital visit and didn’t return any calls or texts. One of his friends went to his house to check on him and found him dead on the 11th of January, 2016.\n\nThe Reason Behind Michael Galeotti’s Death\n\nImage source: Google\n\nThere were many rumors surrounding the death of Michael Galeotti, especially because of his drinking habits that were known to the fans. He was detained a couple of times for driving under the influence shortly after his divorce, so the first thing that came to people’s minds upon his death was his struggle with alcohol addiction.\n\nHowever, his autopsy showed that there wasn’t any alcohol in his bloodstream when he died. Instead, the reason was his heart disease, and it was also the reason he visited the hospital a couple of days prior to his death.\n\nAfter Michael’s death, Bethany Joy Lenz released a grieving statement, talking about his kind nature and musical talent, and expressing her sadness at the news."
