        "text": "One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Galeotti has announced that she and her husband are to divorce.\n\nThe actress, who plays Hayley on the CW show, married musician Michael Galeotti in 2005. She gave birth to the couple's daughter Maria in February 2011.\n\nGaleotti revealed the news on her blog, saying she chose to do so to explain why she will soon be returning to her maiden name.\n\nShe wrote: \"I'm sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl.\n\n\"The only reason I'm saying anything about this at all is because you'll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me 'Bethany Joy Lenz' again.\"\n\nGaleotti added: \"I feel immensely humbled and grateful that God works all things for the good of those who love Him.\"\n\nOne Tree Hill is currently airing its final season."
