        "text": "Lenz, who cohosts \"Drama Queens\" with former costars Hilarie Burton Morgan and Sophia Bush, was candid about the fact that spending so much time faking a relationship with Lafferty influenced her on a \"subconscious\" level. She also acknowledged how that can make boundaries \"confusing\" for some actors.\n\n\"As the show went on, the more time we spent together, I mean, I would totally have a romantic dream about him and wake up and be like, 'oh wow, that was interesting,'\" she said on the podcast.\n\nLenz was clear that because of the four-year age difference between them (Lafferty was about 17 while filming the pilot and Lenz was about 21) it \"didn't occur\" to her to intentionally have \"personal romantic feelings for him.\"\n\nBut the \"Grey's Anatomy\" actress feels like the dreams she had about Lafferty were inevitable. \"We're kissing all day [on set]. We're like making out and we're like being all lovey-dovey,\" she said. \"Of course it's going to work its way into your subconscious.\"\n\nShe and Lafferty \"never, ever\" got together when the cameras weren't rolling, according to Lenz, \"and that's honestly probably what kept the chemistry alive on-screen for so long, too.\""
