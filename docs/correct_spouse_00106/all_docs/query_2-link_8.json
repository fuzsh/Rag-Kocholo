She plans to return to her maiden name, Lenz, again.\n\n“As most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life. In fact, the only reason I’m saying anything about this at all is because you’ll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me ‘Bethany Joy Lenz’ again,” she wrote. “I’m sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce.”\n\nSTORY: CW Sets Finale Schedule, Premiere Date for ‘L.A. Complex’\n\nThe One Tree Hill actress and her soon-to-be ex-husband have a daughter together, who was born in February 2011. The couple married in December 2005.\n\n“We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time. I feel immensely humbled and grateful that God works all things for the good of those who love Him,” she wrote."
