        "text": "Bethany Joy Lenz is someone who I really feel inspired by. I fell in love with her as “Haley James Scott” on “One Tree Hill.”\n\nI became swept away by the love she shared with her on screen husband “Danny Santos” on veteran soap opera “Guiding Light” where she played a fiery “Michelle Santos.”\n\nWas enchanted by her vocal range and ability to make the world seem a little lighter, a little brighter and just a touch more emotional.\n\nAdored her sense of style and followed her Wardrobe Wednesday Blog Posts.\n\nSeriously miss those posts!\n\nAnd last but not least became intrigued by her singer songwriter meets writer qualities as she began an online rotating novel entitled “Diamond Gothic.”\n\nStill no word on if she plans to continue that! I’m still waiting for a new chapter!\n\nAfter Joy’s “One Tree Hill” journey ended over a year ago, I had really missed my Joy fix. But upon her newest role on “Dexter” playing the character “Cassie” whom, from what I hear through the grapevine is gearing up to be a new love interest for “Dexter,” Joy decided to release a new single…a song entitled…\n\n“Please”… off her upcoming album “Bette.”\n\nHere are the lyrics:\n\n“Please”\n\nIf you’re in love with me\n\nwhy don’t you show me\n\nIf you can’t live without holding me then hold me\n\nI have been ignored and abused and rejected so it’s time you told me\n\nif this is what it is then it is not\n\nanything for me\n\nAre you going to try\n\nor is it so easy to watch me\n\nwalking out the door\n\nPlease\n\nget down on your knees\n\nor stand there and shout my name\n\ntill the walls some tumbling\n\nkiss me and say\n\nyou know you can’t let me go\n\nbaby please say ‘stay with me’\n\nI get so tired of scratching\n\nscratching at your door\n\nYou push me out, then let me in\n\nthen you push me out all over again\n\nWith you I have been so exposed,\n\nunprotected, and you’ve never known me\n\nIs it me that you need?\n\nOr is the need simply to own me?\n\nAre you going to try\n\nor is it so easy to watch me\n\nwalking out the door\n\nPlease\n\nget down on your knees\n\nor stand there and shout my name\n\ntill the walls some tumbling\n\nkiss me and say\n\nyou know you can’t let me go\n\nbaby please say ‘stay with me’\n\nI have to say that when I first heard this I was both heartbroken and inspired. These lyrics are so beautiful, so powerful, so sad. I hate to dive into her personal life, because I know she’s a rather personal person…\n\nBut I can’t help but make a connection to her recent divorce from previous husband; Michael Galeotti (Enation; Piano), whom she had daughter Maria with.\n\nThe concept of someone needing to hear that their significant other needs them. Sometimes that reassurance must be met. Its that whole “ask me to stay” situation. Don’t let me leave, because if you do that means maybe I’m not worth fighting for.\n\nAfter everything two people have been through doesn’t a woman deserve for a man to just tell her the truth, call out to her and learn to stop taking advantage. Its not about telling them they need to show you how they feel it’s about wishing they’d do it without you mentioning it.\n\nI guess that’s a common girl mentality.\n\nBut regardless of the meaning behind the lyrics Bethany and her music are a force to be reckoned with and I for one cannot be happier that she’s releasing new music!\n\nSigning off….\n\non cloud Joypiter\n\n[Sorry folks would have included a link so you can hear the song,\n\nbut due to copyright issues the YouTube link was taken down]\n\n*But you can download “Please” on iTunes now!*\n\n*Also…I do not take any credit for any of the above images*\n\n-<3-"
