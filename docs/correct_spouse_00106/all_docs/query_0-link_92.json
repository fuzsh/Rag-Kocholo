She and Michael just welcomed their first child, daughter Maria, in February of 2011.\n\nOK! GALLERY: BETHANY JOY GALEOTTI, SOPHIA BUSH & THE REST OF THE CAST ON ONE TREE HILL CELEBRATE THE FINAL SEASON\n\n\"As most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life. In fact, the only reason I'm saying anything about this at all is because you'll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me \"Bethany Joy Lenz\" again,\" Bethany Joy writes. \"I'm sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time.\""
