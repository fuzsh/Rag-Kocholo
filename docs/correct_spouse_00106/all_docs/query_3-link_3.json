        "text": "Bethany Joy Lenz‚Äôs newest Hallmark film is here! As you‚Äôre watching Savoring Paris, which premieres on June 8 at 8 p.m. ET, you might be wondering who is Bethany Joy Lenz‚Äôs ex-husband and whether she is remarried or dating anyone. Keep reading to find out.\n\nSavoring Paris marks Joy Lenz‚Äôs ninth Hallmark film since her debut on the channel a decade ago for 2014‚Äôs The Christmas Secret. In the new movie, Bethany portrays Ella, a woman embarking ‚Äúon a soul-searching journey to Paris where she navigates love, self-discovery and cheese amidst the enchanting backdrop of The City of Love,‚Äù according to the film‚Äôs synopsis. She stars opposite Stanley Weber in the romance film.\n\nWho is Bethany Joy Lenz‚Äôs ex-husband?\n\nWho is Bethany Joy Lenz‚Äôs ex-husband? Bethany Joy Lenz is currently single, but she was formerly married to musician Michael Galeotti, who was in the band Enation. Joy Lenz and Galeotti tied the knot in 2005 and were married for about seven years. They welcomed one child, their daughter Maria Rose, in 2011.\n\nJoy Lenz announced that the pair were divorcing in 2012 while the last season of One Tree Hill was airing on The CW. At the time, she shared the news on her blog and said she planned to return to her maiden name, Lenz.\n\n‚ÄúAs most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life. In fact, the only reason I‚Äôm saying anything about this at all is because you‚Äôll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me ‚ÄòBethany Joy Lenz‚Äô again,‚Äù she wrote, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce.‚Äù\n\nShe continued, ‚ÄúWe remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time. I feel immensely humbled and grateful that God works all things for the good of those who love Him.‚Äù\n\nJoy Lenz‚Äôs daughter Maria is now 13 years old. This past Valentine‚Äôs Day, she shared a sweet photo with Maria on Instagram. ‚ÄúForever Valentine üíå,‚Äù she captioned the picture. The mother-daughter duo were also photographed in 2022 walking the red carpet at the GRAMMY Awards Viewing Party."
