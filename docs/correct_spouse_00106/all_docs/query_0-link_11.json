        "text": "reading \"he was found dead in his apartment in 2016\" and then scrolling to that cheesy book cover was such whiplash\n\nlmao SAME\n\napparently that's false information and he is still living. it was in a recent ontd post about the oth girlies.\n\nThat cover looks straight out of a Drag race challenge.\n\nWhat the actual fuck this is so scary\n\nAlso how are so many people in cults\n\nAlso how are so many people in cults\n\nMte like what the fuckkk\n\nMy host family in Japan (well, mostly my host mother — my host father was absent from 6 AM Monday to near midnight on Fridays) signed me up for a cult called Happy Science without me knowing. In this case, I'm just one their rolls and they count me as one of their members, but I am def not involved with that far-right pseudo-apocalyptic nonsense.\n\nDid they take your money?!? They had a location in the last small town I lived in but rent must have gotten too damn high because they moved to a smaller building on the outskirts of the city center oop\n\n(no subject) - squirrels_oh_no Expand\n\n(no subject) - wapiko Expand\n\n(no subject) - squirrels_oh_no Expand\n\n(no subject) - wapiko Expand\n\n(no subject) - squirrels_oh_no Expand\n\n(no subject) - wapiko Expand\n\n(no subject) - squirrels_oh_no Expand\n\n(no subject) - wapiko Expand\n\n(no subject) - squirrels_oh_no Expand\n\n\"He was found dead in his apartment\" is pretty dark. Was it suicide? Foul play? Natural causes?\n\nI'm glad she got out.\n\nI didn’t want the post to be too long because I know that ONTD doesn’t read\n\n“When Michael Galeotti got divorced, he allegedly started drinking too much. He was arrested several times for driving while intoxicated (DUI) and even spent some time in jail, according to some reports. As a result of his alcoholism, Galeotti’s health deteriorated, and he battled high blood pressure, diverticulitis, and cholesterol.\n\nMichael Galeotti’s health continued worsening, and he was ultimately taken and admitted to a hospital for treatment. In spite of his doctor’s advice to give up alcohol and take care of his health, Galeotti chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. This decision would show fatal.\n\nOn January 11, 2016, a friend found Galeotti’s dead body in his apartment. Autopsy reports showed that the cause of death was atherosclerotic heart disease. Michael Galeotti was only 31 years old at the time of his death.“\n\nOh geez, that's horrible. He was so young, too.\n\nThank you for the clarification.\n\nThis is about a whole different person lol. You’re thinking of an actor from a Disney show: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Galeota\n\nEdited at 2024-03-01 08:35 pm (UTC)\n\n(no subject) - nutella_forever Expand\n\nYeah, that site is mixing him up with Michael Galeota, I think, bc it also says this about his career:\n\n\"In 2004, Michael Galeotti made his acting debut in the Disney Channel comedy series “The Jersey,” which was based on Gordon Corman’s book series “Monday Night Football Club.” \"\n\nThat was Michael Galeota, not Galeotti.\n\n(no subject) - nutella_forever Expand\n\nI'm pretty sure he's not dead. I Facebook stalked his family not long ago as I was curious if the restaurant she paid for was still going, and there were recent-ish pictures (like, after 2016) on there. He joined the marines or air force or something along those lines, so idk how much he sees his daughter.\n\n(no subject) - nutella_forever Expand\n\nHe’s still alive\n\nI’ve always disliked her for being right wing/religious and so smug about it. But, never suspected THIS. Jesus.\n\nHow has everyone and their mother been part of a cult? What is going on in the US.\n\nI didn’t know she was right wing ew\n\nYou were surprised that a religious cult's members were smug about their belief system? You must not live in America run by Christofascists.\n\nI thought she was just a regular annoying Christian, not part of an actual cult.\n\n(no subject) - bostongirl2003 Expand\n\nDidn't she openly show support for Biden in the last election? Or maybe I'm mixing her up with somebody else.\n\ni was super into the oth fandom at the time and was a big haley/joy fan but her fans were so annoying and sanctimonious that i didn't talk to many of them, but still heard a lot of the gossip about her husband and their relationship (and all the other sinister stuff happening on that set), but never kept up with any of them once the show was over. i knew she finally got divorced and knew she'd acknowledged that it was a cult since, but i had no idea her ex had died, that's scary\n\ni'll probably end up reading this or at least looking into what was said after it comes out\n\nHoly shit Haley James\n\nI’ll def listen to the audiobook\n\nAt the very least, I remember reading some sites where they were clearly mixing up Michael Galeotti with Michael Galeota, a former child actor who died in Jan 2016.\n\nEdited at 2024-03-01 08:32 pm (UTC)\n\nYeah, they def are confusing him with the Disney actor dude who died\n\nIts not. He joined the marines or air force or something.\n\nI edited the post 👍🏻TY\n\nShe looks like an Olsen twin on the cover\n\nI thought Hilary Duff lol\n\nDignity-era Duff\n\nI’m glad she got out. She’s so talented, I loved Haley, and I enjoy her on the drama queens podcast (and it looks like she unfollowed jdebt 🙏)\n\nI know it’s shallow but I kind of want to know what happened with her & Paul too cos I love all OTH gossip, idk if she’ll cover that in a book about the cult though 😂\n\nDid they have a falling out? I stopped listening to the podcast because they were all annoying me too much lol, but when I was listening it seemed like she and Paul were super close.\n\nNo they are- but she said in a recent ep that they’ve kissed before like ~purposely/more than friend kisses and then just carried on talking without more deets 😭😂\n\n(no subject) - poisonapple73 Expand\n\nI think they're still friends but iirc, I feel like he always wanted it to turn into something more with how he's spoken about her and she was not into it. I remember her appearing on Jana's podcast and she was like 'omg you should sooo date' the whole time. It was super awkward.\n\nit's so weird/hilarious to me to think of it like haley had a long crush on uncle keith for awhile and kissed dan at some point! 🤣\n\nIt's so wild that Jonathan Jackson was a part of that cult lmfao.\n\nHere's an old article that came out when she was still in the group: A hometown for ‘General Hospital,’ ‘One Tree Hill’ stars, musicians\n\nAnd this is the site of the sect that she was a part of: <a href=\"https://wildbranchministries.com/>Wild Branch Ministries</a>\n\nthanks!! I was trying to google and find the cult lol\n\noh man i shoulda read comments here first. damn, jj\n\nhim too?? is that why he disappeared in the 2000s after leaving GH and doing that movie with Rory Gilmore? geez\n\nA friend of mine recently started watching Nashville for the first time, so I got to reminiscing and started googling to see what the less famous cast members have been up to lately. That's how/why I learned Jonathan Jackson is super religious and moved to Ireland to help with a Romanian Orthodox monastery being built there.\n\nETA: I didn't realize that her husband was in Jonathan Jackson's band Enation but that explains how they both got involved in the same cult.\n\nEdited at 2024-03-02 02:06 am (UTC)\n\nHer ex husband is not dead lol she references him on the podcast and mentions her daughter spending time with him\n\nalso ngl I'm surprised that both Bethany and Hilarie beat Sophia Bush when it came to memoirs. Considering how much Sophia seems to be in love with the sound of her own voice, I figured the same would hold true for writing lmfao.\n\nI don't think Sophia will write about her life if she does write a book. I feel like it will just be all about her philanthropic efforts.\n\nI truly don't know if I mean this as a read. Lol\n\n(no subject) - imnotasquirrel Expand\n\n(no subject) - rachem_chul Expand\n\nYou're so right. If she writes about her life, it'll be about how at 22 she was a child and her brain wasn't fully developed.\n\nHilarie’s first book was a memoir, no? The rural diaries? And then she just had that grimoire book\n\n(no subject) - yami_no_hoshi Expand\n\nI think I might actually read this.\n\napparently her and Hilarie are fighting?? which makes me so sad if its true!\n\nHilarie thinks Bethany imitated her book cover but it doesn't make sense since Hilarie imitated the old style book cover that was popularized again by Jeannette McCurdy. she's stupid (and disingenuous)\n\nIf this is true, then I hope Bethany moves on from their friendship because that's a big stretch and makes it seem like she's just looking for ways to not be excited for Bethany's book.\n\nEdited at 2024-03-01 09:45 pm (UTC)\n\nReally? LOL. Get a life, Hilarie!\n\nHilarie annoys me and now I feel justified in having Peyton 😌\n\n(no subject) - chll51 Expand\n\n(no subject) - serenachan Expand\n\n(no subject) - halloween1978 Expand\n\nthey're all Sweet Valley High ripoffs\n\nHilarie is so annoying omg. She also keeps doing the most about Taylor and Travis.\n\nnoooo why\n\nI like Hilarie but Bethany’s cover isn’t like hers at all lmao, so if that’s the reason they’re fighting it’s super strange on her part.\n\nRe: i mean - rachem_chul Expand\n\nRe: i mean - belle_chouette Expand\n\nRe: i mean - ginainabottle Expand\n\n(no subject) - spellgabbana Expand\n\nRE: i mean - silverstarry Expand\n\nRE: i mean - warwarwar Expand\n\nRe: i mean - genbu_no_miko24 Expand\n\nOmg I just checked and they have actually unfollowed each other!!
