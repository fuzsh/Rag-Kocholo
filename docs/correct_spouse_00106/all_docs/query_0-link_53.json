        "text": "Michael Galeotti was a man with many ambitions. His true passion was music: he was a talented musician and a skilled pianist. He was known for appearing in popular TV shows such as The Jersey.\n\nHowever, his life was not without its struggles. Galeotti battled with addiction, and his marriage to actress Bethany Joy Lenz could be considered bittersweet. He then succumbed and kicked the bucket despite his numerous battles to remain alert and fit.\n\nThis piece, therefore, delves into the life of Michael Galeotti, his marriage to the famous actress and the issues surrounding his untimely passing.\n\nMichael Galeotti biography\n\nMichael Galeotti was born on August 28, 1984, in Manchester, situated in the US state of Missouri. He was born into the family of Mike Galeotti, a former United State marine corps member, and Sheila Galeotti. He was of Italian-American ethnicity and was raised in a Christian family.\n\nIn his younger years, Galeotti was a talented musician and played several instruments, including the keyboard and the guitar. He was well-recognised for loving music and he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his passion for music and began playing in various bands. His music had a unique sound that blended rock and pop, and he had a particular talent for writing heartfelt lyrics that resonated with his listeners.\n\nHe was the ex-husband of actress and singer Bethany Joy Lenz, who gave birth to their daughter – Maria Rose Gaelotti – in 2011.\n\nALSO READ: Kevin Selleck: Tom Selleck’s adopted son who hides from the spotlight\n\nMichael Galeotti career\n\nMichael began his career at a young age, as he was the star of the Disney Channel television programme, The Jersey, which debuted in 1999. As he grew older, he switched full-time to music.\n\nWhile on the path of his music pursuit, Enation, an independent rock group, added Michael Galeotti to the band’s roster in 2004, and he became the group’s pianist. Before he joined, the band already included the Jackson and Lee brothers, Jonathan and Richard. Also in the band were Daniel Sweatt and Amber Sweeney.\n\nAmber Sweeney did, however, leave Enation barely a year after the group was formed. Even so, the band in Battleground, Washington, rose to fame and established itself as a promising force in the indie rock scene. The band subsequently moved to Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nIn 2008, the group released the album, World In-Flight, to massive critical acclaim. This was a big break for the indie rock band as they gained the much-needed buzz, following the successful hit album. World In-Flight was a great hit. The album was such a huge success, to the extent that one of its songs found its way into the season finale of the fifth season of One Tree Hill. One of the band’s popular songs on the album: Feel This, is featured as one of the soundtracks of the television drama.\n\nGaleotti decided to quit Enation in 2011 after spending seven years with the band. He then went on to get employed at his family’s company, Galeotti’s Wine Cellar.\n\nMichael Galeotti’s net worth\n\nMichael Galeotti and his band enjoyed considerable success throughout their active years, recording and performing in different states across the country. They performed live on several occasions, including “Big Morning Buzz Live” and “The View,” among others, which contributed to Galeotti’s financial success.\n\nGaleotti’s net worth was reportedly estimated to be up to $6 million, according to several media outlets.\n\nALSO READ: London King: Woman who married Rob Schneider three days after first meeting\n\nMichael Galeotti family\n\nMichael Galeotti’s father, Mike Galeotti, was born and raised in Manchester, Missouri. He enlisted in the US Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam to serve\n\nIn 1981, Mike Galeotti and Sheila Galeotti, Michael’s mother, fell in love. A year later, they got married. The older Galeotti served with Wild Branch Ministries as a pastoral counsellor and gospel minister after leaving the Marines. He currently resides with his wife in Battle Ground, Washington.\n\nIn December 2005, Michael Galeotti and Bethany Joy Lenz had their very first encounter. After their meeting, they sparked a connection and began dating. Within a month of dating, the pair decided to walk down the aisle on December 31, 2005.\n\nGaleotti and Lenz exchanged their marital vows in an apple orchard in Hillsboro, Oregon.\n\nThe couple experienced six years of marriage. But over time, their relationship began to deteriorate and shortly after having their first child, problems emerged. Galeotti developed an alcohol addiction problem, which caused him to act violently and led to several arrests.\n\nBethany Joy Lenz reportedly chose to split away from Galeotti due to his insidious alcoholism. The couple divorced in 2012 but maintained a close relationship for the sake of their child.\n\nSpeaking of her divorce, Bethany Joy Lenz declared on her blog that she no longer bears Michael’s surname:\n\n“As most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life. In fact, the only reason I’m saying anything about this at all is that you’ll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me ‘Bethany Joy Lenz’ again. I’m sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce.”\n\nBethany Joy Lenz obtained full custody of her child following her divorce and relocated permanently to Los Angeles, California.\n\nMichael Galeotti’s age\n\nAs of the time of his passing in 2016, Gaelotti was 31 years old. He would currently be 38 years old if he were still alive.\n\nMichael Galeotti’s death\n\nGaelotti struggled with a lot of health complications in the days leading up to his death. He had visited the hospital barely a week before he passed away and was identified as having high blood pressure, diverticulitis, and high cholesterol. Even though he was kept in the hospital, he was eventually discharged and sent home.\n\nIn the subsequent days, Gaelotti did not reportedly return any calls and did not leave his Glendale home. So, a friend decided to visit him but it was already too late; Gaelotti was discovered dead at his home on January 11, 2016, at the age of 31.\n\nAccording to reports, Gaelotti had struggled with alcoholism for many years and his battle with the addiction ultimately led to his untimely death. However, following an autopsy report, it was discovered that no illicit substances, including narcotics, were found in his blood. The cause of death was identified as atherosclerotic heart disease.\n\nFollowing her former husband’s demise, Bethany Joy Lenz released a statement, expressing her grief and sadness at the loss of Gaelotti. She described her ex-husband as a kind, loving, and talented musician who had a deep passion for music and the arts.\n\nIn the wake of Gaelotti’s passing, many of his fans, friends, and fellow musicians took to social media to express their condolences and share their memories of him."
