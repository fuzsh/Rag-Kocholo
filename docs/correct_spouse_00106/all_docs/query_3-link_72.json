        "text": "(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nugh, i HATED Bo and Hope growing up. i like back in the 90s when Sammi was badass.\n\nand also, the most epic of soap couples is clearly:\n\ntechnically, they weren't a couple but still...\n\ni loved them!\n\npassions was such a guilty pleasure!\n\n(no subject) - luvthatdrtywata Expand\n\n(no subject) - loskyabove Expand\n\n(no subject) - iamglory Expand\n\nloooooooooooooooooooove\n\nomg TABITHA. LOVE THEM SOOO MUCH\n\nI miss Timmy.\n\n(no subject) - ptc555 Expand\n\nI miss when she looked like that and not like skeletor. :(\n\nOh, man, flashbacks! Manny was my Favorite Soap Couple Ever back in the day. They were crazy-hot together...\n\nWhat's it like to be into soap operas?\n\nI'm like, genuinely curious. Do you sit down and watch it every day? How the hell do you keep up with what's happening?\n\nwatch it everyday lol\n\ni used to be forced to watch them on summer vacay and they made me want to kill myself. except for passion, that shit was epic.\n\nI go through periods where I watch everyday and then don't watch for months. It's really easy to keep up even if you haven't watched in forever\n\nSome soap operas like Passions, you could watch everyday and then not watch for a year and still get what's going on. But then there are ones like Young and the Restless were you would be so confused. Still have no idea wtf is going on in Y&R.\n\nthe only one i care about is the young and the restless, i try to watch everyday but if i miss i just catch up on soapnet\n\nSometimes you tape them and fast forward through stuff you don't care about. With the advent of youtube, people now sometimes just resort to watching clips of their favorite couples/characters. It doesn't take up as much time as you'd think.\n\nReally? More so than the hot mess fuckery that was Luke and Laura?\n\nthe only thing i got out of this was \"the last five years\". LOVE THAT SHOW.\n\nguiding light? lol ok\n\nluke/laura is where it's at\n\ni came here to say this exactly.\n\nhow often is true love born from a drunken night of forced sex? OTP.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - mjgchick Expand\n\nLOL I just came in here to post Luke and Laura. No one tops these two.\n\nAMEN\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - luvthatdrtywata Expand\n\nLook at that perm.\n\nTHIS\n\nA+\n\ndoes anyone know where i can watch last night's real housewives of DC?\n\nepic soap couple?\n\nRICKYYYY!\n\nRICKKKKYYYY.\n\nI fuckin love Ricky. He is the hottest one on EastEnders. Well, he's still on there cause we're 7 years behind the current episodes.\n\nhe's still there now. :) wouldn't say he was the hottest one at the moment though!\n\nand, wow! what's been happening on it where you are?\n\n(no subject) - runfromtears Expand\n\nRICKAAAAAAAAAAAY!\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\ni loved jensen before all y'all stranger bitches. eric brady was my love when i was 8 years old. holy fuck he was beautiful. now, eh, not even on my radar.\n\nomg! the days when Marlena was possessed on Days of Our Lives were so epic!\n\nI was so enraptured when she was the killer in Salem too. And then they were transported to that random island. totally wtf...\n\nJensen Ackles is a sexy beast. <3\n\nOh and Bethany Joy Galeotti and Jensen Ackles need to act together! STAT.\n\ndon't know the soap, don't know the couple, don't know the guy.\n\ni was like huh she looks like haley OH IT IS HER. love joy <3\n\nBen and Meg from Sunset Beach <3\n\nSunset Beach was the best I loved that show and was so sad to see it end. Meg n Annie always fighting.\n\nThe earthquake/tsunami storylines were ridic. Terror Island was amazing.\n\nTerror Island was great. Poor Mark....:-(\n\nOH GOD...NO NOT AT ALL!!! Stupid ass show!!! And I am sad to admit I watched every episode.\n\nHee. I watch her now (playing the mom of teenagers) on Make It or Break It and I remember that summer that I was completely obsessed with Ben and Meg.\n\nloved them!\n\nYes! Totally destroyed by the nuMac, though.\n\nSo fucking true. nuMac is awful!\n\nI remember shipping them in junior high. Carmen was always trying to split them up for no apparent reason other than boredom. Also, Nancy St. Alban was horrific and was more of a mother figure to Danny.\n\nHAHA saving that gif!\n\nDid someone say Danny & Michelle?\n\nOh and btw, Paul has done a lot since GL but it's all theatre stuff because there's not a lot of tv/soap jobs in New York. He was going to do General Hospital in LA a few years back and play opposite GL's Laura Wright but that fell thru.\n\nJoy's pregnant now too! :D\n\nAnd no one cares about that St. Alban girl. She was never Michelle.\n\nDid she actually announce the pregnancy? Maybe they'll actually use it on OTH so it doesn't have to be a fake pregnancy belly\n\nI heard Haley is preggers apparently.\n\n(no subject) - katiebeckett Expand\n\n(no subject) - colorblind03 Expand\n\nGL was trying to put Cassie and Danny together because PAS and LW were a crazy epic super couple on their last soap, but the Manny fans were not having it, which was stupid because Joie Lenz had already left by that point and Manny died the day Joie left.\n\nI always hoped that Rachel Miner would return as Michelle; she was the original and BEST Michelle, in my opinion. But if she had come back, I would have been all in favor if Bill & Michelle over Manny."
