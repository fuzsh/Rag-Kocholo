        "text": "In the words of the great Peyton Sawyer, sometimes all you need is one — but it may take a while to get there. The characters on One Tree Hill were in countless love triangles, went on romantic excursions and even got married in high school. In real life, things weren't always so magical. Although some of the stars of the 2003 drama chose to date outside the show, others found love on set. When the series first debuted on The WB (later airing on The CW), Sophia Bush began dating costar Chad Michael Murray. On screen, their characters, Brooke Davis and Lucas Scott, entered a relationship as well. The Cinderella Story star proposed in 2004, and they married one year later in April 2005. The duo split five months after the nuptials and finalized their divorce in 2006. Despite their messy breakup behind the scenes, they continued working alongside each other until his exit in 2009. Other stars of the drama found love elsewhere. Danneel Harris, for example, began dating Supernatural's Jensen Ackles in 2006. Soon after, Harris introduced Hilarie Burton Morgan to one of Ackles' costars, Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

She went on to date Jon Foster from 2006 to 2007 and her One Tree Hill costar James Lafferty from 2008 to 2009. In 2010, she dated One Tree Hill's Austin Nichols on and off for four years. The pair called it quits in 2012.\n\nThe activist dated Google programming manager Dan Fredinburg from 2013 to 2014 and remained close friends until his death in 2015.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016, Bush dated her Chicago P.D. costar Jesse Lee Soffer. In 2020, she was spotted holding hands with Grant Hughes. One year later, Bush confirmed that she and the entrepreneur were engaged. \"So it turns out that being your favorite person’s favorite person is the actual best feeling on planet Earth,\" she wrote via Instagram in August 2021, alongside a photo of Hughes proposing.\n\nBush and Hughes exchanged vows in June 2022. After more than a year of marriage, the couple called it quits in August 2023.\n\nBy October 2023, Bush was romantically linked to soccer star Ashlyn Harris. The actress came out as queer and confirmed her relationship with Harris in an April 2024 Glamour cover story.\n\nCredit: Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nChad Michael Murray\n\nAfter his split from Bush in 2006, the House of Wax star began dating Kenzie Dalton, whom he met while she was working as an extra on One Tree Hill. They were engaged from 2006 to 2013, but then called it off.\n\nThe following year, Murray began dating his Chosen costar Sarah Roemer. In 2015, the couple announced they had secretly married and were expecting their first child. They welcomed their son later that year and a daughter in 2017.\n\nIn October 2023, Murray’s ex-girlfriend Erin Foster claimed that the actor cheated on her with Bush. Murray and Foster dated from 2001 to 2002 before he moved on with his costar the following year.\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nJana Kramer\n\nIn 2004, Kramer married Michael Gambino after two weeks of dating. They divorced months later after the singer ended up in the hospital following severe domestic abuse. Gambino was convicted on attempted murder charges and sentenced to six years in prison. In 2010, he died by suicide.\n\nKramer married her Prom Night costar Johnathon Schaech in July 2010, but the pair split a month later, and the divorce was finalized in June 2011. She was later engaged to singer Brantley Gilbert for eight months in 2013, before ending the relationship.\n\nIn 2015, she married former NFL star Mike Caussin, and they welcomed their first daughter, Jolie, in 2016. That year, they separated and he went to rehab for sex addiction. In 2017, they renewed their vows. The following year, they welcomed a son, Jace. In April 2021, she filed for divorce.\n\nAfter a messy romance with former Navy SEAL Ian Schinelli, Kramer began dating Scottish soccer coach Allan Russell. They went public in January 2023, with Kramer explaining that they are in a long-distance romance as he lives in London. She seemingly introduced Russell to her kids in April 2023. The following month, Kramer revealed that the athlete had popped the question after less than one year of dating. In June 2023, the \"Why Ya Wanna\" songstress announced that she and Russell were expecting their first child together. Their son Roman was born that November."
