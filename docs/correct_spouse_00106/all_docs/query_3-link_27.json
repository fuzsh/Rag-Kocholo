Mike Galeotti, the proprietor of Galeotti’s Wine Cellar, a small business, and Sheila Galeotti, a high school teacher, raised him in a middle-class home. Galeotti developed a strong passion for music from a young age.\n\nRichard Lee and Jonathan Jackson formed the indie rock group Enation in 2003, and he joined them after receiving his high school diploma in 2002.

Galeotti then deleted all of his social media posts, maybe in an attempt to put the breakup behind him and concentrate on his personal life.\n\nTragic Death\n\nMichael Galeotti’s health continued worsening, and he was ultimately taken and admitted to a hospital for treatment.
