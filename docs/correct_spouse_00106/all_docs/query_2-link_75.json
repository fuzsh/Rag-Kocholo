        "text": "Lenz is best known for her on screen portrayal of Haley James Scott on One Tree Hill and as Michelle Bauer Santos on the CBS Daytime soap operaGuiding Light. Furthermore, Lenz is recognized for her music as a solo artist and as a member of the band Everly.\n\nEarly life\n\nBethany Joy Lenz was born on April 2, 1981 in Hollywood, Florida. Lenz is an only child to Robert Lenz, a history teacher and therapist, and Cathie, a personnel manager and entrepreneur. Her grandfather George Lenz, was a regular on the Broadway stage in the 1950s starring in musicals Wish You Were Here, South Pacific, and many others.[1] Following in her grandfather's footsteps, Lenz began singing at the early age of three at The Carpenter's Church in Lakeland, Florida. At the age of seven, Joy and her family moved to Arlington, Texas where she attended Pope Elementary. She was also enrolled in The Creative Arts Theater and School where she took dance, tap, jazz, acting and theater classes. At seven years old, Lenz landed her first stage role playing a Munchkin in a local production of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Three years later, Lenz played Scout in the production of To Kill a Mockingbird at the Irving Community Theater in Texas.\n\n[edit]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]Acting\n\nLenz has been working steadily as an actress since the age of twelve. She landed her first professional job in a commercial for an American syndicated teen drama series entitled Swans Crossingduring a trip to Los Angeles with her drama school. Lenz continued to garner experience at a young age by landing lead roles in various staged productions like Annie, Cinderella and Gypsy: A Musical Fable. At the age of thirteen Lenz moved with her family to New Jersey where she attended the Hawthorne Christian Academy for a year and began auditioning aggressively for television roles. She became a commercial veteran appearing in commercials for Eggo Waffles, Dr Pepper among many others. By her sophomore year in high school Lenz appeared in Stephen King'sThinner and was well received by critics.\n\nOn March 1998 at the age of seventeen, Lenz earned a nine episode gig as the teenage clone of Reva Shayne Lewis on the CBS Daytime soap opera Guiding Light. Lenz made a positive impression on viewers, critics and Guiding Light executives alike that she was later recast as Michelle Bauer Santos upon Rebecca Budig's exit. This was an unusual move and \"unheard of\" in the industry according to CBS producer, Mickey Dwyer-Dobbin. While working on the demanding daytime serial Guiding Light, she graduated from Eastern Christian High School in New Jersey in 1999 and landed the role of Rose Cronin in Mary and Rhoda; a made-for-television movie that reunited Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper as Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern. At the timeLenz was juggling a heavy storyline, a television movie portraying Mary Tyler Moore's daughter, a one-year run of a New York cabaret called Foxy Ladies Love/Boogie 70's Explosion, and the lead role in an independent film. Lenz also filmed two pilots; one playing the daughter of Paul Sorvino, and the other as the lead in the WB's 1972.\n\nIn October 2000 at the end of her two year contract with The Guiding Light, Lenz decided to leave her role as Michelle Bauer Santos. After leaving Guiding Light, she moved from New York City toLos Angeles where she performed in a theater production of The Outsiders and began to guest star on television shows such as Off-Centre, Charmed, Felicity, Maybe It's Me and The Guardian. In 2002, Lenz joined the cast of Bring It On Again as Marni Potts. During this time, Lenz was also featured in Interview Magazine's \"Stars On The Rise\" in January.[2]\n\nIn 2003, at the age twenty two Lenz was cast in the WB's television series One Tree Hill. Lenz originally auditioned for the roles of Brooke Davis and Haley James but ultimately landed the roleHaley James, the quintessential girl-next-door who is best friends with Lucas Scott, portrayed by Chad Michael Murray and wife of Nathan Scott, portrayed by James Lafferty.[3] During her time onOne Tree Hill, Lenz was also offered the role of Belle in Beauty and the Beast when it was still in production on Broadway, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with the show. Furthermore, Lenz appeared in an episode of Life Unexpected alongside Kate Voegele as part of a crossover-event between One Tree Hill and Life Unexpected.\n\nWell into sixth season of One Tree Hill, Lenz made her directorial debut in an episode entitled Screenwriter's Blues. Lenz stepped behind the camera to call all the shots, as Lucas finally got the opportunity to cast his movie.[4] Lenz initially approached producer Greg Prange in 2007 with the idea of directing but was not given the opportunity to direct until two years after her request. Over the course of season six Lenz shadowed several directors, watched them prep and went on [location] scouts.[1] Since her directorial debut, Lenz has directed two more episodes of One Tree Hill.\n\nOn November 17, 2011, Lenz filmed her last scenes as the character Haley James Scott on One Tree Hill.\n\n[edit]Music\n\nSince Lenz's exit from Guilding Light she has completed a demo of original music. Trained by the director of The Brooklyn College of Opera, Lenz plays the guitar and piano, and writes her own music. Her first album, entitled Preincarnate was released in October 2002 .[2] Lenz continues to release new music oftentimes through her character Haley James Scott on One Tree Hill. In 2005, after recording \"When the Stars Go Blue\" with costar Tyler Hilton, the duo joined The Wreckers (Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp), and Gavin DeGraw for a 25-city North American One Tree Hill Tour that started in Vancouver. Lenz and Hilton scored the #89 spot on February 2005's Billboard Pop 100 chart with the duet \"When the Stars Go Blue.\"[5] While on tour, Lenz debuted her second independent record entitled, Come On Home. Despite her hectic schedule during the tour, Lenz also filmed her first music video for \"Songs in My Pockets\" at Coney Island Beach andAstroland in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nIn 2006 alongside ex-American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi, Lenz co-wrote and recorded \"Halo\" which was released in the second volume of the One Tree Hill Soundtrack. During this time, Lenz inked a deal with Sony Epic Records and worked with her producer, Ron Aniello (Lifehouse, Guster, Barenaked Ladies) to record original material. However, in 2006 after changes within the company, Lenz split from the label. Despite the musical setback, that same year Galeotti traveled to Los Angeles to write and record several songs for the soundtrack for Ten Inch Hero.[6] Lenz's split with Epic allowed her to open new doors in her music career and since then she has decided to sign under the independent record label Hillasterion.\n\nIn 2009, Lenz premiered the song \"Feel This\" which premiered in the fifth season finale of One Tree Hill. The airing led to an excited response which made \"Feel This\" the number one Top Seller on CD Baby; one of the largest independent music outlets in the world. In another episode entitled Messin' With The Kid Lenz's character Haley James Scott encounters a street performer portrayed by Grace Potter. Ambitious to reestablish her music career, Lenz and Potter's characters sing the hit single \"I Want Something That I Want\".[7]\n\nIn 2008, Lenz took her music to new grounds and formed the band Everly with her life-long friend, Amber Sweeney. Immediately after the duo was formed, Everly, musical acts Angels & Airwaves, and occasional One Tree Hill guest star Kate Voegele teamed up with the USO for a live concert event for military personnel. The USO concert was filmed and formed the basis for a One Tree Hillepisode, titled Even Fairy Tale Characters Would Be Jealous.[8] Everly continues to release various singles for One Tree Hill and is expected to release their full-length album in 2012.[9]\n\n[edit]The Notebook Musical\n\nAfter six months of writing a libretto of The Notebook Musical based on the New York Times best selling novel, The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks, Lenz brought the idea to her producer Ron Aniello. Shortly after they formed Galeotti & Aniello Productions. and presented their first-ever Live Theatrical Workshop in October 2009. This preliminary step toward an eventual opening in New York consisted of basic sets, costumes and choreography. All actors were expected to be off-book for performance. The workshop was intended to assist the creative team in visualizing, editing and critiquing the play as well as to garner Producer interest and investors.[1] Lenz has until now kept facts about the musical underwraps; however, on November 2010 in response to Twitter followers who successfully raised more than $2000 in one day for the charity Love146, Lenz released the song \"Troublesome Tongue\". \"Troublesome Tongue\" features Noah's father, and his friends explaining Noah's childhood stutter to new love Allie.[1]\n\n[edit]Personal life\n\nWhen she wasn't filming One Tree Hill in Wilmington, North Carolina, Lenz lived in Battle Ground, Washington. Lenz married musician Michael Galeotti in December 2005. In February 2011 the couple announced the arrival of their daughter, Maria Rose Galeotti.[10] However, on March 19, 2012, Lenz announced on her blog that she and Michael Galeotti were divorcing, but would remain friends.[11] Lenz released the following statement, \"you'll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me \"Bethany Joy Lenz\" again. I'm sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time.\"\n\n[edit]Galeotti's Restaurant\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Lenz teamed with her now ex-husband Michael Galeotti and in-laws to open Galeotti’s Restaurant. Bethany Joy Lenz is part owner of the new restaurant which occupies the space in downtown Battle Ground that formerly housed Irby's Fine Dining at 801 E. Main st. The restaurant focuses on healthful, organic, locally sourced foods, and uses eco-friendly materials and supplies whenever possible.[12]\n\n[edit]Philanthropy\n\nIntroduced to Love146 by bandmate, Amber Sweeney, Lenz has been actively supporting the international human rights organization largely through social media outlets.[13] On June 12, 2011 through her official Twitter account, Lenz revealed details of her newest project; an online boutique called \"Lark\". The boutique sells apparel with original designs by Lenz and all proceeds benefitLove146, To Write Love On Her Arms, as well as Reading is Fundamental.[14]"
