        "text": "Another ending is in sight for Bethany Joy Galeotti — she’s not only saying goodbye to One Tree Hill after nine seasons, but also to her husband after six years of marriage.\n\nEven though Haley James Scott, her character on One Tree Hill, is currently fighting for her marriage and her missing husband, actress Bethany Joy Galeotti is calling it quits in real life. She announced yesterday that she will soon be getting a divorce from her husband, Michael Galeotti. The two have been married for just over six years.\n\nThe CW actress broke the news to her fans through an intimate and hopeful blog post on her website yesterday, and also informed readers that she will be reverting back to her maiden name, Lenz.\n\n“As most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life,” she wrote. “In fact, the only reason I’m saying anything about this at all is because you’ll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me ‘Bethany Joy Lenz’ again.”\n\nBethany and Michael also have a one-year-old daughter together — Maria Rose Galeotti, who was born last February.\n\n“I’m sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time. I feel immensely humbled and grateful that God works all things for the good of those who love Him.”\n\nThe actress wasted no time changing her signature to reflect the change, as she signed the blog post with “Love, BJL” this time.\n\nIt must be hard for Bethany to simultaneously handle the ending of One Tree Hill after nine season AND the end of a marriage after six years. We’re rooting for you!\n\nPhoto credit: Brian To/WENN.com\n\nRead more One Tree Hill headlines"
