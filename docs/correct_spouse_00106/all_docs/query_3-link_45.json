        "text": "A match made in small-screen heaven! One Tree Hill alum Bethany Joy Lenz and UnREAL alum Josh Kelly are dating, and they seem totally enraptured by one another.\n\nThe duo attended Equality Now’s 4th annual Make Equality Reality Gala in Beverly Hills on Monday, December 3, alongside fellow guests Amandla Stenberg, Margaret Atwood and Goldie Hawn.\n\n“They were inside the gala together sitting very closely at a table and chatting intensely,” an eyewitness tells Us Weekly of Lenz, 37, and Kelly, 36. “At one point, they were standing up talking to another couple, and Bethany had her arm wrapped tightly around Josh’s waist. [She] was rubbing his back at another point.”\n\nThe eyewitness adds: “They were very smiley with one another all night, sitting very close together and lost in each other. They seemed very cozy.”\n\nThe couple have quietly been an item for at least six months: They were spotted holding hands at a farmer’s market in early June. Plus, they cuddled up for photo booth pics that Lenz posted on Instagram two days before the Equality Now gala.\n\nLenz and Kelly have known each other for far longer, however. Nearly five years ago, they filmed the E! musical drama pilot Songbyrd, created by Grey’s Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff. “First day down on Songbyrd,” Kelly tweeted in January 2014. “@BethanyJoyLenz @KrisaVernoff, you’re rad!”\n\nHe retweeted the same post in July of this year, adding, “Little did I know just how rad.”"
