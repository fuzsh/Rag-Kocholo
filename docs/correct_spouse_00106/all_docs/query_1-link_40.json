        "text": "Michael Galeotti and his ex-wife, Bethany Joy Lenz's love story ended in 2012 after six years of marriage. The couple was blessed with a beautiful daughter they love and adore during their time together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBethany Joy Lenz's ex-husband, Michael Galeotti, established a successful career in the entertainment industry. He is a talented musician and a member of the renowned rock band. Besides performing, Michael also worked at Galeotti's Wine Cellar.\n\nDuring their marriage, Michael Galeotti and Bethany Joy Lenz accomplished several things together, including launching a business. They were business partners in a restaurant venture, with the musician taking on a significant role in managing the eatery when his ex-wife was occupied with her demanding career.\n\nBethany Joy Lenz attends the 47th annual Gracie Awards Gala at Four Seasons Hotel on May 24, 2022, in Beverly Hills, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nBethany Joy Lenz' Ex-husband Is a Musician\n\nMichael's Facebook bio introduces him as a staff of Galeotti's Wine Cellar. He has also made a name for himself as a member of the rock band Enation, which is based in Nashville. The band is renowned for their electrifying albums and live shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Michael, who excels on the piano, the group consists of Jonathan Jackson, responsible for vocals and guitar; Richard Jackson, handling the drums; Luke Galeotti, showcasing his guitar skills; and Daniel Sweatt, providing the bass lines. The band appeared in the drama series \"One Tree Hill,\" where Michael's ex-wife starred, performing their hit single \"Feel This Way.\"\n\nBethany revealed the news of their divorce through her now-defunct blog.\n\nMichael Galeotti and His Ex-wife Were Business Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael and his former wife began a joint business venture by establishing Galeotti's restaurant in Old Town Battle Ground. Given his ex-wife's demanding career, which primarily centered around her role in \"One Tree Hill\" and her extensive time spent in North Carolina filming the show, Michael took on managing the restaurant.\n\nMichael and his fellow band members, Jonathan and Richard, share a deep and long-lasting connection. Their parents initially connected through Michael's father, who served as a pastor.\n\nOver time, the Galeotti and Jackson families forged a strong bond rooted in their shared faith, regularly visiting each other. During one of these visits, while the Galeotti family was at the Jacksons', Michael crossed paths for the first time with Bethany Joy Lenz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Galeotti and His Ex-wife Share a Daughter\n\nMichael and Bethany tied the knot in December 2005 and lived together in a home they had bought in Battle Ground. After six years of marriage, the actress announced they had decided to part ways. Bethany revealed the news of their divorce through her now-defunct blog, which has since changed ownership.\n\nDespite her choice to live a private life, the \"One Tree Hill\" star, who costarred with Hilarie Burton and Sophia Blush, said she shared the divorce announcement because she intended to return to her maiden name. Bethany also explained she anticipated people would notice the name change and become curious, prompting her to explain.\n\nThe exes share a daughter who was born in February 2011. Bethany announced the arrival of their daughter, Maria, through her now-inactive blog. News about Michael and Bethany expecting their first child first broke in August 2010 after multiple sources close to the actress revealed she was expecting."
