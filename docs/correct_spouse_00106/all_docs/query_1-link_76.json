        "text": "ACTRESS Bethany Joy Lenz has opened up in her new memoir about her time in a cult.\n\nThe One Tree Hill star revealed in her book, Dinner For Vampires, that the cult leader \"drained her of all her money.\"\n\nBethany, 42, is most known for playing Haley James Scott on CW show One Tree Hill, which ran from 2003 to 2012.\n\nIn a synopsis on the publisher's website, Bethany describes her time in the \"abusive\" cult, which she did not reveal to anyone at the time, not even her co-stars.\n\nA REAL CULT\n\n\"An only child who often had to fend for herself and always wanted a place to belong, Lenz found the safe haven she’d been searching for in a Bible study group with other Hollywood creatives,\" the description reads.\n\n\"However, the group soon morphed into something more sinister—a slowly woven web of manipulation, abuse, and fear under the guise of a church covenant called The Big House Family.\"\n\nShe soon moved away to the group's Pacific Northwest Compound.\n\nThe Big House Family was ran by a sinister minster, who convinced Bethany to marry one of his sons, she writes.\n\nIn the process, the leader - her father-in-law - also took millions of dollars from her and what she earned from One Tree Hill, according to the book.\n\nKEEPING HER LOYAL\n\nThere were \"minders\" assigned to Bethany while she was on set.\n\n“Maoist struggle session”–inspired meetings in the basement of a filthy house kept her loyal to the Family as well.\n\nShe also had regular counseling with the \"leadership.\"\n\nBethany reveals she finally got out of the cult when she had her first child, daughter Maria Rose, in 2011.\n\nShe wanted to save them from the same fate that she had.\n\nWith the help of a One Tree Hill superfan, Bethany escaped nearly a decade after she entered and learned to heal from the trauma that she endured.\n\nThis 320 page memoir will recount that story in her own words.\n\nLIFE AFTER CULT\n\nBethany divorced her husband Michael Galeotti in 2012, after six years of marriage.\n\nIn an announcement about their split, the actress wrote, \"We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time.\"\n\nNow, the actress is part of the Drama Queens podcast with her former One Tree Hills co-stars, Sophia Bush and Hilarie Burton Morgan.\n\nBethany also worked on her music career and starred in numerous TV holiday movies since leaving.\n\nDinner For Vampires: Life On a Cult TV Show While Also In An Actual Cult is set to be released on October 22 through Simon & Schuster.\n\nIt will be sold for $30 in hardcover through all major booksellers."
