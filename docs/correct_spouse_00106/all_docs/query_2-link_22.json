Michael Galeotti is a member of the band \"Enation.\"\n\nGaleotti also expressed faith in God in her Monday blog post.\n\n\"I feel immensely humbled and grateful that God works all things for the good of those who love Him,\" she wrote.\n\nGaleotti's marriage isn't the only thing ending in her life. The show \"One Tree Hill,\" which has remained on air for nine seasons, will wrap-up airing with a two-hour series finale on April 4.\n\nGaleotti is recognized predominately for her role as Haley James Scott \"One Tree Hill,\" as well as her music career as a member of the band \"Everly.\""
