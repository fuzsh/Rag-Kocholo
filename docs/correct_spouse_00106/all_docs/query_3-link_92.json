        "text": "And in “My Top Ten TV Crushes of All Time” news… One Tree Hill star Haley James Scott Bethany Joy Galeotti announced on her website yesterday that she is splitting from her husband of more than six years, Michael Galeotti. Here’s the full announcement:\n\nAs most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life. In fact, the only reason I’m saying anything about this at all is because you’ll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me “Bethany Joy Lenz” again. I’m sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time. I feel immensely humbled and grateful that God works all things for the good of those who love Him.\n\nLove,\n\nBJL\n\nBethany married Michael in 2005 and gave birth to their daughter Maria in February of 2011.\n\nMy guess is that Bethany is either leaving Michael to run off with some douchey emo singer/songwriter or else Lucas Scott is back in the picture!\n\nOTH loveliness flashback…"
