She is known for her portrayal of Haley James Scott on The WB / The CW television drama One Tree Hill (2003–2012). She also starred as Michelle Bauer Santos on the CBS Daytime soap opera Guiding Light (1998–2000), and is recognized for her music as a solo artist and as a member of the band Everly.\n\nSince 2021, Bethany has been a co-host on the Drama Queens podcast along with her former One Tree Hill co-stars, Sophia Bush and Hilarie Burton Morgan.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBethany began singing in church in Florida at the age of three and enrolled in a performing arts school after moving to Arlington, Texas at age seven. She attended Pope Elementary. She was also enrolled in The Creative Arts Theater and School where she took dance, tap, jazz, acting and theater classes. At seven years old, Bethany landed her first stage role playing a Munchkin in a local production of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Three years later, she played Scout in the production of To Kill a Mockingbird at the Irving Community Theater in Texas. Her grandfather, George Lenz, was a Broadway musical theater performer, quickly found roles in community theater. She won her first TV-commercial audition on a trip to Los Angeles. As a child actress, she earned parts in a handful of TV movies in the ’90s before landing a recurring role on the daytime soap “Guiding Light” in her late teens.\n\nCareer\n\nActing\n\nTwo years on “Guiding Light” led to several guest spots on network prime time shows such as Charmed and Felicity, until Bethany was cast as a regular on One Tree Hill. She played Haley on its full run from 2003 to 2012. During her time on the series, Bethany was featured on One Tree Hill: Music from the WB Television Series, Vol. 1, singing a duet with Tyler Hilton called “When the Stars Go Blue,” which was written by Ryan Adams. She also directed multiple episodes of the show.\n\nSince 2014 she has become a regular face for the Hallmark Channel, starring in 9 Hallmark Channel original movies as of 2022. In 2022 she starred in and executive produced the horror film So Cold the River.\n\nMusic\n\nBethany released her sophomore LP, “Come on Home,” in 2005, and later formed the folk duo Everly with musician Amber Sweeney. They made their debut with “Mission Bell” [EP] in 2008, and issued an extended version of the record later that year. Everly also released the holiday album “Fireside” in late 2009. Another Bethany solo album, “Then Slowly Grows,” arrived in 2012. Bethany’ followed her time on “One Tree Hill” with more music and more acting. Bethany’s fourth solo album, “Your Woman,” appeared in 2013, with the four-track “Get Back to Gold” out in 2014. She also found regular work in television, including recurring roles on shows such as “Dexter,” “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” and “American Gothic.”\n\nFamily Life\n\nWhen Bethany wasn’t filming One Tree Hill in Wilmington, North Carolina, she lived in Battle Ground, Washington. She married musician Michael Galeotti in December 2005. In February 2011 the couple announced the arrival of their daughter, Maria Rose Galeotti.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Bethany teamed with Michael Galeotti and in-laws to open Galeotti’s Restaurant. Bethany is part owner of the new restaurant which occupies the space in downtown Battle Ground that formerly housed Irby’s Fine Dining at 801 E. Main st. The restaurant focuses on healthful, organic, locally sourced foods, and uses eco-friendly materials and supplies whenever possible.\n\nOn March 19, 2012, Bethany announced on her blog that she and Michael Galeotti were divorcing, but would remain friends, “you’ll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me Bethany Joy Lenz again. I’m sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time.”\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nIntroduced to Love146 by bandmate, Amber Sweeney, Bethany has been actively supporting the international human rights organization largely through social media outlets. On June 12, 2011 she revealed details of her newest project; an online boutique called “Lark”. The boutique sells apparel with original designs by Lenz and all proceeds benefitLove146, To Write Love On Her Arms, as well as Reading is Fundamental.\n\nDid you know…"
