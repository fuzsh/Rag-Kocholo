Michael and his former wife began a joint business venture by establishing Galeotti's restaurant in Old Town Battle Ground. Given his ex-wife's demanding career, which primarily centered around her role in "One Tree Hill" and her extensive time spent in North Carolina filming the show, Michael took on managing the restaurant.
