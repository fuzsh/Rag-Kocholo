Hey,

I want to install Supertux 0.3 in OpenSuse 11 x86-64, and I can’t find it in my repositories, where it was when I had Opensuse 10.3.

So I downloaded the autopackage installer from Download/Unstable - SuperTux

I used

package install supertux-0.3.0b.x86.package

but it always replies although I’ve installed physfs-package.

# Preparing package: SuperTux Platform Game # Checking for required C library versions ... passed # Checking for OpenAL Audio Toolkit ... passed # Checking for Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) ... passed # Checking for OpenGL Graphics Toolkit ... passed # Checking for Ogg bitstream library ... passed # Checking for Vorbis audio codec ... passed # Checking for Standard C++ library ... passed # Checking for SDL Image Library ... passed # Checking for PhysicsFS ... /usr/libexec/autopackage/luau-downloader.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libxml2.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory failed # FAIL: Could not find 'PhysicsFS'. Try using the native package manager for openSUSE (yast) to install a package with similar name to 'physfs'. FAIL: Unable to prepare package SuperTux Platform Game.

Does anyone know a solution for my problem?

Thanks in advance

I love his little red FireFighter hat when he’s powered up!

When you get error messages like you’ve got, it’s usually because you don’t

have the ‘-devel’ package installed…

for the ‘error while loading shared libraries: libxml2.so.2…’

install ‘libxml2’ and ‘libxml2-devel’

For the physicsfs issue:

install ‘physfs’ and ‘physfs-devel’.

The ‘-devel’ package installs the header files and extra stuff needed to

build a program using that code, while the non ‘-devel’ packages contain

just the libraries needed to run a program.

Hope that makes sense.
