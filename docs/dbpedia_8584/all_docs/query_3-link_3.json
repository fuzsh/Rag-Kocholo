We recommend installing packages with it.\n\nAlso, please do consider contributing back to the Emacs community. One major way is by financially sponsoring the lead developers and teams of developers that create and maintain the wonderful Emacs packages that so many of us use. Elisp Maintainers provides a fantastic collection of ways that one can donate to several prolific Emacs package developers. Please do so donate.\n\nAbove all, enjoy using Emacs.

Upgrading to the newest/current version of emacs (if emacs comes preinstalled on ones operating system) will give the best user experience, and it is advised to do so as soon as possible. Here are several resources to assist you as you start or continue your journey with emacs.\n\nUse your favorite Linux package manager (e.g. apt, dnf, yum, pacman, etc) or build from source. Typically, either a relatively recent version of emacs or no instance of emacs will be on a default install of one’s Linux distribution.\n\nUse Homebrew or MacPorts to install emacs with a package manager. Also, consider Emacs for Mac OS X and the Homebrew Emacs Plus formula for installation candidates. The preinstalled version of emacs on a default macOS install is quite old. For an optimal emacs experience, upgrading to a newer version is highly recommended.\n\nEmacs can be downloaded from the GNU FTP or a GNU mirror listed on the GNU Emacs Download & Installation page, and/or using the MSYS2 pacman manager. Another option is to install emacs via the Chocolatey or scoop Windows package managers. A default install of Windows does not contain emacs.\n\nThe following resources can be used to build emacs in various environments– e.g. containerized docker builds, continuous integration, building various versions of emacs, etc.\n\nevm - Emacs Version Manager.\n\nflycheck/emacs-travis - Install emacs on Travis CI.\n\nnpostavs/emacs-travis - Pre-built emacs binaries for Travis CI (fork of flycheck/emacs-travis, significant though in that it is used for CI in projects such as Magit).\n\nSilex/docker-emacs - Run emacs in docker containers (multiple image variants, with options for Ubuntu or Alpine Linux based images).\n\nJAremko/docker-emacs - Dockerized emacs with GUI (Mac, Windows, GNU/Linux and your browser).\n\nnix-emacs-ci - Emacs installations for continuous integration.\n\nInterface Enhancement\n\nDashboard - A startup dashboard which provides certain information about your recent Emacs activities.\n\nHelpful - An enchancement of the Emacs built-in help system.\n\nsublimity - smooth-scrolling, minimap inspired by the sublime editor.\n\nworkgroups2 - Session manager, saves all your opened buffers, their location and sizes on disk to restore later.\n\nace-popup-menu - Replace GUI popup menu with something more efficient.\n\nGNU Hyperbole - GNU Hyperbole is an efficient and programmable hypertextual information management system.

Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add a new package, library, or software to the list.\n\nBefore contributing, please read this tiny guideline:\n\nThe Order of Items\n\nPlease don’t rearrange the package ordering without any reason! The items should be sorted by its popularity ( roughly, because it’s impossible to have a precise standard. e.g. most people would use it; recommended for every newbie…), instead of your personal preference.\n\nFor example, Evil is obviously not a package that every Emacser needs. So please don’t move it to the top of its category.\n\nIn contrast, if you think a package is recommended for every Emacser (especially for a newbie), just place it at a higher place in the list.\n\nEmacs Built-In Packages\n\nIf a package is available in the latest version of Emacs, please remember to add a [built-in] tag in the front of the description.\n\nGenerate “Table of Contents”\n\nIt is recommended to install toc-org which will update the Table Of Contents for you automatically on each save. It will also give you convenient navigation - if you press C-c C-o (org-open-at-point) when the point is on the entry in the Table Of Contents, you will jump to the respective section.\n\nIf for some reason, you don’t want to install it, you can download a single file toc-org.el manually, open it, and call M-x eval-buffer.\n\nThen change buffers to README.org. Subsequently, issue M-x toc-org-insert-toc within the README.org buffer. If a new category of packages has been added in your commit, the Table of Contents section will be revised and updated.\n\nOther Awesome Lists\n\nA curated list of awesome lists can be found at awesome.re.\n\nTo the extent possible under law, emacs.tw has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this work."
