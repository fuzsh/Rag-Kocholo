        "text": "The mobile app market is constantly growing, with revenue from the industry continuing to skyrocket, year after year.\n\nIn fact, mobile apps are projected to generate over 935 billion in revenue by 2023.\n\nIn short, if you’re looking to tap into the mobile app market by building your own app, it’s always the right time to get started.\n\nBut what programming language should you use?\n\nCan you use any language for Android and iOS app development, or is there a “best” language?\n\nIn this article, we’ll review which language is best to get started in creating your own mobile app and how you can make the right choice for your project.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMobile App Types\n\nNative App\n\nHybrid App\n\nProgressive Web App (PWA)\n\nBest Programming Languages for Apps\n\nJava\n\nJavaScript\n\nSwift\n\nKotlin\n\nHow to Choose the Right Programming Language\n\nPractical, Popular, and Prosperous\n\nAsk the Right Questions\n\nChapter #1: Mobile App Types\n\nBefore we dive into the best programming languages to learn for mobile app development, you should first have a basic understanding of native mobile app development, hybrid mobile app development, and progressive web applications (PWA).\n\nKnowing which type of mobile app you’re going to be developing is key in finding the right programming language.\n\n1.1 Native App\n\nWhen you create an app that uses a technology dedicated to one specific platform, like iOS or Android—that’s called a native app.\n\nEach operating system has its own language used for coding a native app.\n\nIf you’re building an iOS native app, for example, you might want to use Objective C or Swift as the programming language.\n\nFor Android native app development, you would need to use Java or Kotlin.\n\nPros of Native App Development\n\nCan take full advantage of the device’s hardware and software features\n\nBetter performance and user experience\n\nEasier access to device-specific features (e.g. camera, GPS, etc.)\n\nBetter security\n\nBetter support for offline functionality\n\nCons of Native App Development\n\nRequires separate development for each platform (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.)\n\nCan be more expensive to develop\n\nRequires separate deployment for each platform\n\nMay require more maintenance and updates\n\nEverything has its pros and cons, and native app development is no different.\n\nSo who is this method of development best suited for?\n\nNative app development is a good choice if you’re creating an app for one specific platform. It’s also a good choice if you want the best user experience by removing unnecessary features.\n\nIf you plan on creating a gaming app or an app that has heavy animations, native apps are the way to go since they can handle it due to faster performance.\n\n1.2 Hybrid App\n\nA hybrid app is a mix of native and web apps. It lets developers code in just one language which can be run on multiple operating systems.\n\nYou can use more well-known languages and frameworks when building a hybrid application, like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\n\nWhen building this type of app, you would create your backend codebase which would then be covered in a native shell, allowing you to offer the app for both Android and iOS.\n\nPros of Hybrid App Development\n\nCan be developed using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)\n\nCan be deployed to multiple platforms with a single codebase\n\nCan access device features through APIs\n\nMay be faster and cheaper to develop than native apps\n\nNumber of Active Developers Globally\n\nCons of Hybrid App Development\n\nMay not have the same performance as native apps\n\nMay have limited access to certain device features\n\nMay not have the same user experience as native apps\n\nMay require additional tools or frameworks\n\nMay require more maintenance and updates\n\nIt’s important to carefully consider the trade-offs between hybrid and native app development, based on the specific needs and goals of your project.\n\nHybrid app development can be a good choice if you need to support multiple platforms and want to save time and resources, but it may not be the best option if performance and user experience are your top priorities.\n\n1.3 PWA\n\nProgressive web apps run in a web browser but still give users the look and feel of a native application.\n\nSo this means you can install the app on your mobile device—it works offline and can even\n\n—and you can still use hardware features like your GPS and camera.\n\nEach platform is optimized and there are no limitations to what programming languages you can use.\n\nPros of PWA App Development\n\nCan be developed using web technologies\n\nCan be accessed through a web browser or installed on a device\n\nCan work offline or on low-quality networks\n\nMay be faster and cheaper to develop than native apps\n\nCan be easily updated and maintained\n\nCons of PWA App Development\n\nMay not have the same level of performance as native apps\n\nMay not have the same access to device features as native apps\n\nMay not have the same user experience as native apps\n\nMay not be supported by all devices or browsers\n\nNot available in app stores\n\nIf you want a low-cost and yet robust e-commerce app, PWA can be a good choice. Since it’s accessible on multiple devices and platforms, it’ll also result in higher traffic.\n\nPRO TIP:\n\nBefore jumping on what you think is the most popular mobile app programming language, take time to first think about which of these types of apps you plan on building.\n\nChapter #2: Best Programming Languages for Apps\n\nWhen it comes to mobile app development, there isn’t really one single “best” programming language, and as mentioned in the previous section, it really depends on what kind of app you’re making.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the most popular languages for app development so you can make the best choice.\n\n2.1 Java\n\nJava is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that’s widely used for developing a variety of applications.\n\nIt’s known for its “Write once, run anywhere” philosophy, meaning that Java code can be compiled and run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n\nJava is used to build standalone applications as well as Android apps and web applications, and is a popular choice due to its scalability, security, and reliability.\n\nWhile it’s possible to develop iOS apps using Java, this language is most often used for Android app development since it’s a widely used and well-established language among developers.\n\nIt’s also flexible and Android already has a number of development tools for it.\n\n2.2 JavaScript\n\nJavaScript has been a long-time programming language favorite among developers, and many will argue that it’s the best programming language, period.\n\nIt’s become even more popular with the rise of frameworks like Vue and React.js that help build front-end UI components.\n\nJavaScript is also a server-side language and it’s often a developer’s top choice language for a variety of reasons.\n\nNot only is it a great programming language for developers of all skill levels, but it can be run everywhere—on every device and on both the client-side and server-side.\n\nNot only is it a great programming language for developers of all skill levels, but it can be run everywhere—on every device and on both the client-side and server-side.\n\nSince it’s been around for 25 years, JavaScript has a huge community behind it. You’ll find that it has a vast number of plugins and frameworks, making development much easier and streamlined.\n\nReact Native is a widely used JavaScript framework that allows for cross-platform mobile app development for iOS and Android.\n\nPRO TIP:\n\nJust because a language has been around for a long time doesn’t necessarily mean you should use it. JavaScript is still popular and beloved after all these years, with new standards being released all the time.\n\nMake sure the language you choose isn’t outdated and on its way to expire.\n\n2.3 Swift\n\nSwift by Apple is a popular programming language and has surpassed Objective C as the preferred language for iOS app development.\n\nIt’s a developer’s favorite for creating iPhone and iPad apps for a wide variety of reasons.\n\nIt’s a very readable, type-safe language that’s also not difficult to code in, unlike other languages, like Objective C.\n\nSwift is also highly interactive, meaning it can work in an interactive environment and you can see the output while you’re coding. This also makes it easy to catch coding errors at the coding stage.\n\nAnother perk is that Swift is completely free and open source.\n\n2.4 Kotlin\n\nKotlin is a newer programming language and is a great alternative to Java. It’s also the official language for Android app development created by Google, so it’s certainly worth learning if you want to create Android apps.\n\nIt has native support and it’s supported by IDEs like Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nWhile some will argue that Kotlin is the next Java, keep in mind that it’s a newer language that isn’t quite there yet, but it’s still worth learning since it’s being promoted heavily by Google for Android app development.\n\nChapter #3: How to Choose the Right Programming Language\n\nWith so many new languages and frameworks out there, it can be hard to make the right decision when it comes to developing an app.\n\nRemember to keep the three Ps in mind before deciding.\n\n3.1 Practical, Popular, and Prosperous\n\nThe programming language should be practical. It should give you ample control over your project without needing too many external resources.\n\nIt should be popular. Choosing a language that’s popular is important because popularity means you’ll have a large community behind it, a wealth of tools, frameworks, and resources to use.\n\nPicking a programming language that’s popular is also a good idea because it means you’ll be able to find developers skilled in that language much more easily and for a more affordable price.\n\nSelecting a programming language that’s more niche and not as widely used will likely result in you paying more for a developer that knows that language.\n\nObjective C, for example is an old and outdated language for iOS. It’s also fairly hard to learn and use, and it’s only a matter of time before it goes completely extinct.\n\nAnd finally, the language you choose should be prosperous. It shouldn’t just be the language of the hour, but rather one that’s foreseen to be used many years down the road.\n\n3.2 Ask the Right Questions\n\nSince you’re reading up on the best languages for app development, you’re either a new developer looking to learn their first language, or you’re already a developer trying to learn something new.\n\nNo matter where you stand, here are some questions that will help you decide if you should move forward with a specific programming language for mobile app development.\n\nAre you looking for a language to further your career?\n\nWhat companies are working with this language?\n\nWhat kind of ecosystem does this programming language have?\n\nDo you enjoy working with this language?\n\nDoes having a large community of support behind a language matter to you?\n\nAnswering these questions will help get you on the right path in your mobile app development journey.\n\nPRO TIP:\n\nIf you’re still unsure which language to use, pick one and start using it. This will help give you a feel for the language to see if you like it and want to continue learning it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEvery programming language has its pros and cons, and not a single one is perfect.\n\nPicking the right one is all about what kind of app you’re trying to build and for what platform.\n\nKnowing these details first will help you narrow down your list so you can make the best choice for your specific app project.\n\nRemove any uncertainty you have and set your project up for success with our Simple Starter package—a cost-effective solution that will turn your app idea into an actionable plan\n\nWhat’s your go-to programming language?\n\nThe Pet Care Market is predicted to be worth $202.6 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research.\n\nThat’s massive.\n\nAnd 69% of millennials are using technology to keep track of their pets—that includes the use of mobile apps.\n\nAdvances in tech are improving the way we care for our pets, and apps today offer owners the ability to track their pets’ health habits, monitor playtime, connect with pet care services, and so much more.\n\nLet’s take a look at what kinds of pet apps are trending and the best ones on the market today so you can make better decisions when building your own app.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTypes of Pet Apps\n\nPet Product Apps\n\nPet Training Apps\n\nPet Tracker Apps\n\nConnect with Professionals Apps\n\nPet Apps that are Trending\n\nCreating a Pet App—Where to Start\n\nTarget Audience\n\nPick Your Features\n\nStudy the Competition\n\nBuild an MVP\n\nChapter #1: Types of Pet Apps\n\nIf you visit the app store and search for pet apps, you’ll find that there are simply tons of mobile apps available, offering a wide range of services.\n\nSome are more tech-savvy, offering tracking and live cam capabilities, and others are simply designed to connect pet owners to pet care professionals.\n\nHere are the main types of pet apps you’ll find so you can see where your own pet app might fit in.\n\n1.1 Pet Product Apps\n\nWhen pet owners are looking for convenience and savings when shopping for their pet, product apps designed specifically for pets, like Chewy, offer a great solution.\n\nThese types of apps offer a large variety of pet supplies, like foods, toys, medicines, and more, all in one place and at a competitive price.\n\nSome features pet product apps offer include the ability to search by category, earn discounts on automatic monthly orders, and have items delivered right to your door.\n\nSure, stores like Walmart, Target, and Amazon offer a wealth of pet products, but the selection isn’t nearly as big and there isn’t much focus on online organization.\n\nPet product apps are optimized for user-friendliness. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for pet owners to find what they need in one place.\n\n1.2 Pet Training Apps\n\nHiring someone to train a pet can be expensive, time consuming, and overall, inconvenient.\n\nAnd during this COVID-19 era, people want to interact with strangers much less than before, which is what makes pet training apps incredibly convenient.\n\nThese apps come with a wide range of features.\n\nSome focus on providing tips and tricks, including images and instructional videos, on how to train your pet, and other apps will allow users to video chat with a live trainer, one-on-one.\n\nPet training apps allow you to track your progress and training lessons, some offer training equipment for purchase, like clickers, and others gamify training sessions by using digital badges and awards.\n\n1.3 Pet Tracking Apps\n\nPet tracking apps come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThese types of apps can track your pet’s activity, similar to how fitness trackers work.\n\nThey’ll generate detailed reports on your pet’s fitness, movement levels, pulse, and more so you can monitor your pet’s physical health and progress.\n\nThese apps can also be used for food monitoring so pet owners can make adjustments to their pet’s diet when necessary.\n\nOther pet tracking apps focus on locating your microchipped pet using GPS technology.\n\nFor pet owners who value having all the data needed to make progress in their pets lives, pet tracking apps offer plenty of personalized information on pets so owners can make better decisions in caring for their pet.\n\n1.4 Connect with Professionals Apps\n\nMany pet apps come in handy when pet owners want to connect with professionals in the pet industry, like veterinarians, pet sitters, pet groomers, and so on.\n\nThese types of apps can help users find professionals in their area, and some even offer virtual services, like online consultations with a veterinarian, which can be helpful if a pet owner has questions or needs guidance on their pet’s health.\n\nChapter #2: Pet Apps that are Trending\n\nIf you’re interested in developing a mobile app in the pet app industry, it’s crucial to see how the competition looks.\n\nIt’s not only useful to see what other pet apps are offering users, but what their strengths and weaknesses are.\n\nLet’s take a look at pet apps that are trending in Google Play and the App Store.\n\n3.1 Target Audience\n\nWhen considering building a pet app, the first thing you should consider is who you’re targeting.\n\nSimply saying your target audience is a “pet owner” encompasses a huge number of people.\n\nPRO TIP: Ask yourself what type of pet owner your app will be designed for and what specific solutions and features it’ll offer. Find your app’s niche and get specific.\n\n3.2 Pick Your Features\n\nThe biggest mistake you can make when developing a pet app is loading it up with features.\n\nExample of Features for a Pet App\n\nDon’t encumber your app with every feature that’s out there. Start with just a few features that are meant to set your app apart from everything else.\n\nWhen people download pet apps, they’re looking for a specific solution.\n\nThey might not care about fancy video cams or activity monitoring. Maybe they just want an app that will help them learn how to train their pet.\n\nThink carefully about which features you’ll offer and how it’ll help solve real problems.\n\n3.3 Study the Competition\n\nThe apps listed in the previous chapter are just a small sample of what’s on the market.\n\nWhile you don’t need to go through every single app that’s out there, you should pay close attention to pet apps that are trending.\n\nIt’ll give you a good idea of what people want from a pet app.\n\nReviewing user feedback from these apps can also offer valuable insight as to the strengths and weaknesses of popular apps.\n\nMaybe one of the top pet training apps has a great solution but has a lot of negative feedback about the UI.\n\nYour app can focus on improving that, or you can offer something completely new and different.\n\n3.4 Build an MVP\n\nA minimum viable product, or MVP, is a basic version of what you want your app to be that only includes core features.\n\nThe idea behind building an MVP as opposed to a full-fledged app is to create immediate value fast while keeping development costs down.\n\nThis is a great way to test the viability of your app idea and get investors onboard.\n\nHere are some additional benefits to building an MVP for your pet app:\n\nTest Concepts\n\nBeing able to test ideas and business concepts is one of the biggest benefits to creating an MVP.\n\nThis gives you an opportunity to verify if your ideas are resonating with your audience and allows you to more easily change direction if needed.\n\nTest UX/UI and App Usability\n\nHaving an MVP allows you to gather insights and data about how users are interacting with your app.\n\nSure, you can always give testers a prototype or mockup, but feedback on a real MVP can bring even more valuable information that will help you fine tune your app and identify pain points or opportunities for creating a better user experience.\n\nVerify Market Demand\n\nAn MVP is all about test driving your app and seeing what the hits and misses are.\n\nIt involves constant testing to understand the market demand before spending a ton of time and money on building your app.\n\nDevelop a Monetization Strategy\n\nHaving an MVP will give you data and feedback that can help you define an appropriate monetization strategy.\n\nAfter all, your app needs to be profitable.\n\nAn MVP lets you test different strategies to find the one that works best for your app.\n\nCost-Efficient\n\nA mature, full-fledged mobile app can take a considerable amount of time and money to build.\n\nA minimum approach lets you start smaller, gather the information you need, and slowly invest more into your project as you make adjustments along the way.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe bottom line is, people care about their pets a whole lot.\n\nOur pets are pretty much family members, and people are willing to shell out money on high-quality apps that can help them care for and keep track of their furry friends.\n\nIf you’re not sure where to start and what approach is best for your pet app, check out our Simple Starter Package which can help turn your app idea into a concrete plan.\n\nWhat’s your favorite pet app and how do you think it can be improved?"
