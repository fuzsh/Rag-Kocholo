        "text": "1 General Information: README\n\nThis is the README file for the distribution of ESS version 24.01.1\n\nESS is a GNU Emacs package for interactive statistical programming and data analysis. Languages supported: the S family (S, S-PLUS and R), SAS, BUGS/JAGS and Stata. ESS grew out of the desire for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode and SAS-mode as well as a consistent union of their features in one package.\n\nInstallation instructions are provided in sections for both Unix and Windows; see below.\n\nThe current development team is led by Martin Maechler since August 2004. Former project leader A.J. (Tony) Rossini (rossini@blindglobe.net) did the initial port to XEmacs and has been the primary coder. Martin Maechler (maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch) and Kurt Hornik (Kurt.Hornik@R-project.org) have assisted with the S family and XLispStat. Stephen Eglen (stephen@gnu.org) has worked mostly on R support. Richard M. Heiberger (rmh@temple.edu) has assisted with S/S-PLUS development for Windows. Richard and Rodney A. Sparapani (rsparapa@mcw.edu) have done much of the work improving SAS batch and interactive support. Rodney has also extended ESS to support BUGS/JAGS and has an interest in improving Stata support.\n\nWe are grateful to the previous developers of S-mode (Doug Bates, Ed Kademan, Frank Ritter, David M. Smith), SAS-mode (Tom Cook) and Stata-mode (Thomas Lumley)."
