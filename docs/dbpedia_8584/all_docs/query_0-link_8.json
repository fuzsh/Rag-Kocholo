        "text": "A new version of the Autopackage cross-distribution packaging system for Linux has been released. The most important enhancement in the new 1.2 version is the improved C++ support, making it possible to create a package that will install on systems with different C++ ABI versions (gcc 3.2 or gcc 3.4). Also, first steps to integrate Autopackage with native package managers have been done: now it is possible to uninstall an RPM package conflicting with the autopackage that is being installed. There are also many other GUI and backend improvements."
