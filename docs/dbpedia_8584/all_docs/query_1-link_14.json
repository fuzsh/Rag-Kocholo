        "text": "Download the actual Windows release. Get the MSI. But first, install all the prequisites!\n\nA packaging machine is exposed to the internet and reaches out to dozens of server on the net every day and should therefore be hardened and downlocked. Recommended installation is per user into the profile, which is used to run AutoPkg. This user profile should have not more than standard user rights. For this to work, the MSI have to be advertised with admin rights and the following command:\n\nmsiexec /jm AutoPkgWin.msi\n\nCAUTION: This needs an elevated CMD-shell! PS-console does not work!\n\nAfter this, the Installer can be run with standard user rights.\n\nAutoPkg for Windows requires Windows 10 / Server 2016 or newer, Windows 32 or 64bit and to have Git installed is highly recommended, so managing recipe repositories is possible. Knowledge of Git itself is not required but helps. Tested only on 64bit!\n\nEasy route: With this script (AutoPkg-PreReq-Installer), you can install everything needed, in one run.\n\nStep by step instruction:\n\nThe following software and tools are needed as prequisites to run AutoPkg on Windows:\n\nPython 3.8.x: or 3.10.x Download (Caution: pythonnet is still not compatible with Python 3.9/3.10)\n\n(Python 3.10.x works with pythonnet v3.0.0-alpha2 with: pip install pythonnet –pre)\n\nNeeded libraries: pyyaml, appdirs, msl.loadlib, pythonnet, comtypes, pywin32, certify\n\nIf Python is present, those libs are automatically installed by the AutoPkg installer.\n\nGit (highly recomended): Download\n\n7zip: Download\n\nWindows-Installer-SDK: Download, You have to select a version, that fits your OS. This is necessary for some of the MSI-related processors.\n\nDownload the webinstaller, choose a download directory and select at least: “MSI Tools”, “Windows SDK for Desktop C++ x86 Apps” and on x64 systems also “Windows SDK for Desktop C++ x64 Apps”, (there will be some additional selections).\n\nThen install at minimum: “Windows SDK Desktop Tools x86-x86_en-us.msi” and “Windows SDK Desktop Tools x64-x86_en-us.msi” (x64 only).\n\nFind the install location (Somewhere under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits…)\n\nCopy the Wi*.vbs and Msi*.exe files over to your MSITools folder.\n\nRegister the 64bit mergemod DLL: regsvr32 “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\xxx\\x64\\mergemod.dll”\n\nIf the SDK is present, this COM DLL is automatically registered by the AutoPkg installer.\n\nWix-Toolset: Download, version 3.11 should do it. Although, i always use the latest development version.\n\nMSBuild: Download, THE Windows Make!\n\nInstall commandline: vs_buildtools.exe –add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.MSBuildTools –quiet"
