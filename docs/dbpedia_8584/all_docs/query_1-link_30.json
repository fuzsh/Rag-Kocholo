        "text": "To format a selection: Ctrl+K, Ctrl+F\n\nTo format a document: Ctrl+K, Ctrl+D\n\nSee the pre-defined keyboard shortcuts. (These two are Edit.FormatSelection and Edit.FormatDocument.)\n\nNote for macOS\n\nOn macOS, use the CMD ⌘ key instead of Ctrl:\n\nTo format a selection: CMD ⌘+K, CMD ⌘+F\n\nTo format a document: CMD ⌘+K, CMD ⌘+D\n\nFor Visual Studio 2010/2013/2015/2017/2019\n\nFormat Document (Ctrl+K,Ctrl+D), i.e. press&hold Ctrl, press&release K then tap D as it is a sequence\n\nFormat Selection (Ctrl+K,Ctrl+F)\n\nToolbar Edit -> Advanced (If you can't see Advanced, select a code file in solution explorer and try again)\n\nYour shortcuts might display differently to mine as I am set up for C# coding but navigating via the toolbar will get you to your ones.\n\nIf it isn't working, look for errors in your code, like missing brackets which stop auto format from working\n\nI have installed an extension named \"Format document on Save\" which formats the whole document every time you save it.\n\nFor installing it in Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017, on Tools just click the \"Extensions and Updates...\":\n\nAnd then just go to \"Online\" at the left panel and search for \"Format document on save\":\n\nUnder menu Tools → Options → Text Editor, then going to the Formatting → General section of whatever language you wish to format you will find General. Check all three formatting check-boxes.\n\nUnder menuTools → Options → Text Editor, then going to the TABS section of whatever language you wish to format you will find Indenting. Select Smart and it will activate automatic formatting whenever you use one of the closing elements ; ) } within that block.\n\nThere isn't any need for keystrokes.\n\nYou can add the buttons to your toolbar by clicking the little drop down arrow to the right of the last toolbar button, select \"Add or Remove Buttons\" and then click the buttons you want to add a tick to them. The button(s) you select will appear on your toolbar ...\n\nThen you just select text and click the Increase Indent or Decrease Indent buttons. I tested this on Visual Studio 2013 only.\n\nThe original question said \"I cannot find the setting.\"\n\nSimple answer is: Look at top menu, then\n\nEdit --> Advanced --> Format Document\n\nYou will also see the currently assigned key strokes for that function. Nothing special to memorize. This really helps if you use multiple developer environments on different operating systems.\n\nJust to further Starwfanatic and Ewan's answers, you can customise your IDE to add any button to any toolbar - so you can add the Format button (as the HTML Source Editing toolbar has) to any other toolbar (like Text Editing with all the other edit controls like increase/decrease indent).\n\nClick the arrow to the right of the toolbar → Add or Remove Buttons → Customize... → Commands tab → button.\n\nDocument Format and Selection Format are both under the Edit group.\n\n(Tested in Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2013)\n\nIf it's still not working then you can select your entire document, copy and paste and it will reformat.\n\nSo ...\n\nCtrl + A\n\nCtrl + C\n\nCtrl + V\n\nThis is the only thing that I have found that works in Visual Studio Community Edition on Mac."
