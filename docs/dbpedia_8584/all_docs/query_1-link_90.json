        "text": "Much information can be found at the GNU Emacs Download & Installation page. Upgrading to the newest/current version of emacs (if emacs comes preinstalled on ones operating system) will give the best user experience, and it is advised to do so as soon as possible. Here are several resources to assist you as you start or continue your journey with emacs.\n\nLinux\n\nUse your favorite Linux package manager (e.g. apt, dnf, yum, pacman, etc) or build from source. Typically, either a relatively recent version of emacs or no instance of emacs will be on a default install of one's Linux distribution.\n\nmacOS\n\nUse Homebrew or MacPorts to install emacs with a package manager. Also, consider Emacs for Mac OS X and the Homebrew Emacs Plus formula for installation candidates. The preinstalled version of emacs on a default macOS install is quite old. For an optimal emacs experience, upgrading to a newer version is highly recommended.\n\nWindows\n\nEmacs can be downloaded from the GNU FTP or a GNU mirror listed on the GNU Emacs Download & Installation page, and/or using the MSYS2 pacman manager. Another option is to install emacs via the Chocolatey or scoop Windows package managers. A default install of Windows does not contain emacs.\n\nAlternative\n\nThe following resources can be used to build emacs in various environments– e.g. containerized docker builds, continuous integration, building various versions of emacs, etc.\n\nevm - Emacs Version Manager.\n\nflycheck/emacs-travis - Install emacs on Travis CI.\n\nnpostavs/emacs-travis - Pre-built emacs binaries for Travis CI (fork of flycheck/emacs-travis, significant though in that it is used for CI in projects such as Magit).\n\nSilex/docker-emacs - Run emacs in docker containers (multiple image variants, with options for Ubuntu or Alpine Linux based images).\n\nJAremko/docker-emacs - Dockerized emacs with GUI (Mac, Windows, GNU/Linux and your browser).\n\nnix-emacs-ci - Emacs installations for continuous integration.\n\nPlease don't rearrange the package ordering without any reason! The items should be sorted by its popularity ( roughly, because it's impossible to have a precise standard. e.g. most people would use it; recommended for every newbie…), instead of your personal preference.\n\nFor example, Evil is obviously not a package that every Emacser needs. So please don't move it to the top of its category.\n\nIn contrast, if you think a package is recommended for every Emacser (especially for a newbie), just place it at a higher place in the list.\n\nIt is recommended to install toc-org which will update the Table Of Contents for you automatically on each save. It will also give you convenient navigation - if you press C-c C-o (org-open-at-point) when the point is on the entry in the Table Of Contents, you will jump to the respective section.\n\nIf for some reason, you don't want to install it, you can download a single file toc-org.el manually, open it, and call M-x eval-buffer.\n\nThen change buffers to README.org. Subsequently, issue M-x toc-org-insert-toc within the README.org buffer. If a new category of packages has been added in your commit, the Table of Contents section will be revised and updated."
