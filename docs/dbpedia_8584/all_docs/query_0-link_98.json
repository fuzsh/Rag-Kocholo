Maintainable code consists of many small methods (<= 20 lines) at the same level of abstraction embeds well-structured logging instructions. Reliability comes with good error handling.\n\nMy coding history:\n\nCurrently working on mobile apps using Ionic -- it is fun with TypeScript and Angular.\n\nUsed Python around 2014/2015 developing an Odoo plugin.\n\nDeveloped several commercial .NET projects and loved LINQ and Entity Framework\n\nSpent some time learning Scala -- good for learning concepts.\n\nExcited and sleepless when reading Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\n\nDeveloped distributed system application using C and C++\n\nDeveloped business application using SQL and embedded C.\n\nCoding is fun and rewarding. Yes, my mind is software"
