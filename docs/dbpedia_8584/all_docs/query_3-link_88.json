        "text": "Autoship & Save Terms and Conditions\n\nLast updated: September 12, 2023\n\nBy checking “Yes, make my life easy” and agreeing to the accompanying terms on the Chewy.com/ca checkout page, you agree to accept these terms and conditions (\"Terms”) for our Autoship subscription ordering program (\"Autoship”). The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Chewy Canada, Inc. (\"Chewy”) relating to our Autoship program. Please note that your use of the Chewy.com/ca website is also governed by our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, limitations and requirements on the Chewy.com/ca website, all of which (as changed over time) are incorporated into these Terms. By placing an order and enrolling in our Autoship program, you accept these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements. Please read these Terms carefully.\n\nBenefits\n\nWhen you purchase product(s) on Chewy.com/ca and enroll in our Autoship program, you are signing up for continuous shipments of such products and may select how often you would like your product(s) delivered to you. You may change your periodic delivery schedule at any time (including on a one-time basis), as well as your shipping address, payment method, and products included in the program. Additionally, when you purchase certain products designated as \"Autoship & Save” eligible, and enroll in the Autoship program for such products, you will save an additional percentage on our everyday low prices.\n\nSubject to these Terms, Chewy reserves the right to change Autoship benefits at any time in its sole discretion, including discount amounts and eligibility used to determine discount amounts; provided, however, Chewy will not change the price of your next shipment once you have authorized an order as set forth in these Terms. Some of the offer details may change as you receive deliveries over time (for example, price, taxes, availability, shipping charges). Subscriptions are good while supplies last.\n\nNotifications; Automatic Order Creation; Order Changes or Cancellation\n\nWhen you place your initial order for a product and enroll in our Autoship program, you will receive a notice that your Autoship subscription has been created and your first order will be processed. Your first order will be processed immediately, and your selected payment method will be charged at the time the order is placed. Your Autoship subscription will thereafter automatically create a new order according to your chosen delivery schedule, until you cancel.\n\nFor subsequent orders of products included in Autoship, up to 72 hours prior to the ship date selected by you, you will receive a pre-shipment email notification reminding you of your upcoming shipment, the period available to make changes to your order and the scheduled ship date. You can edit or cancel your order during the period beginning upon receipt of such email notification and ending 12:00 AM the day preceding your designated ship date (i.e., the day prior to your ship date). If you do not cancel the order before the day prior to your ship date, your order will be authorized, and a credit card authorization hold will be placed on the payment method used to create your subscription or updated payment method you may provide. You will see a pending charge during this time as we prepare your order. There is no need to call or update any information online when you see this pending charge.\n\nCredit Card Authorizations and Charges\n\nWhen you sign up for continuous shipments on Autoship, you expressly agree to permit us to charge your chosen payment method on a recurring basis, as well as the amount of the charge, which amount shall be set as described below. Chewy will submit periodic charges (e.g., monthly) to your chosen payment method without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice at any time that you wish to cancel or to change your payment method. Approximately 24 hours prior to your designated ship date, your order will be authorized, and a payment authorization hold will be placed on your chosen payment method. When your order is processed and ships, your payment method will be charged for the authorized amount. For clarification purposes only, a payment authorization hold is not an actual charge, i.e., if an authorization hold is placed for $49 on January 1 and your payment method is charged $49 on January 2 when your order is shipped, you will only see one actual charge on your payment method on January 2 for $49. An authorization hold may impact the amount of remaining credit available to you under your chosen payment method.\n\nPricing; Payment; Renewal; Cancellation\n\nThe amount you are ultimately charged for a product delivered pursuant to our Autoship program will be the price of that item as stated in the pre-shipment email notification you receive or lower, if the price of the product is lower on our site as of the time your order is authorized. Once your order has shipped, your chosen credit card or other payment method will be billed this amount. You will not be charged until your order ships. The total cost charged to your payment method for each Autoship order will be the price of the item, less the Autoship & Save discount or any other discount, if applicable, plus any applicable shipping charges and sales tax. Any credit balances on your Chewy.com/ca customer account may be applied toward the balance of your order before charging any remaining balance to your payment method.\n\nThe charge for each Autoship item shipment will be billed to the payment method used to create your subscription, or if that payment method no longer works, any other payment method you may have included in your wallet, or as otherwise directed by you. If we are unable to complete your Autoship order with the payment method you used to create your subscription or any other payment method in your wallet, we will notify you and give you the opportunity to add another payment method in your account and to charge the payment method for your Autoship order.\n\nYour subscription will remain in effect until it is cancelled. Subject to these Terms, You can cancel at any time via Autoship Manager, which can be found in Your Account, or by contacting our Customer Service.\n\nAgreement Changes\n\nNOT APPLICABLE TO CONSUMERS RESIDING IN QUEBEC: We may, in our sole discretion, change these Terms, (including all applicable terms, conditions, limitations and requirements on the Chewy.com website). Where required by the law of the province in which you reside, we will provide you with notice of any substantial changes to these Terms at least 60 days prior to the change coming into effect by email, a notice in your Account or on our Site. If any change to these terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions. YOUR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS.\n\nAdditional Terms\n\nWe may, in our sole discretion, terminate your subscriptions at any time without notice. If we do so, you will only be charged for orders that have been shipped to you. Products are only available for shipping within Canada. Your participation in the Autoship program is personal to you, and you may not assign or transfer your Subscription or any of the benefits to any third party without our authorization. All returns under Autoship are subject to the Chewy.com/ca Return Policy. Autoship subscriptions are void where prohibited.\n\nLanguage / Langue (For Quebec residents only – Pour les résidents du Québec seulement).
