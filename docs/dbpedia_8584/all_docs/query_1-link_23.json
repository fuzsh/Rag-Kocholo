        "text": "7.1.2 Deploying to Workstations with JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Already Installed\n\nTo reload a new package on workstations on which JD Edwards EnterpriseOne is already installed, use one of two methods:\n\nJD Edwards EnterpriseOne Workstation Installation (for full packages).\n\nOracle's JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director (P9631) (for full and update packages).\n\nAfter you assemble and build a package, use JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director to schedule the package for deployment to individual workstations or to selected groups. On the specified deployment date, when the users who are scheduled to receive the package sign in, they are given the opportunity to load the package.\n\nJD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director requires that JD Edwards EnterpriseOne be already loaded on the workstation. You can schedule a new full package to replace the existing package, or an update package to be merged with the existing package on the workstation.\n\nBoth deployment methods have advantages. JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Workstation Installation is a good method to use when you want to install a package immediately or soon after it is built, without having to schedule the package. Alternatively, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director is useful if you need to control when the package becomes available, if you want to make the package installation mandatory, or if you want to deploy the package to servers as well as to workstations.\n\n7.1.3 Deploying to Servers\n\nServers receive the same package that you build for the workstation, but in a different format. When you assemble the package and create the package build definition, you can specify the servers to which you want to build and deploy the package. To deploy the package, you use the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director application (P9631), which uses the same scheduling mechanism to deploy packages to workstations. In fact, you can easily schedule deployment to both client workstations and servers on the same form.\n\nIf you are deploying a package that contains only UBEs, otherwise known as batch applications, the system marks the package as a \"UBE only\" package. The system deploys a UBE-only package immediately, rather than waiting for the EnterpriseOne HTML server and waiting for all UBEs to finish. When the package is deployed, the system checks to see if the UBE in the package is currently being processed. If so, a lock is placed on that individual UBE so that the deployment can update the specifications. If not, the package deployment moves forward. This happens automatically and provides a faster deployment time for packages that contain only UBEs.\n\nIf you are deploying a package that contains only APPs (interactive applications), the system marks the package as an \"APP-only\" package. The system deploys the APP-only package, waits for the EnterpriseOne HTML server (for one minute), and then deploys it immediately without waiting for any UBEs to finish.\n\nIf you are deploying a package that contains only UBEs and APPs, the system marks the package as a \"UBE/APPs only\" package. In this case, the system waits for the EnterpriseOne HTML server (for one minute), and then follows the same logic as the UBE-only deployment.\n\nAll three of these scenarios happen automatically and provide a faster deployment time for packages that contain only UBEs, only APPS, or only UBEs and APPs.\n\n7.2.1 Understanding Deployment Parameters\n\nBefore you deploy packages, you must identify the workstations, servers, groups, or locations that will receive the package. Identifying these ensures that, when you are ready to schedule packages using the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director, the machines, groups, or locations that you want to receive the package will be available as package recipients.\n\nA deployment group is a group of workstations that are classified by a criterion such as job function, team, or any other grouping that you specify. For example, you might have a software development group, a testing group, a production group, and so on. Oracle's JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Package Deployment Groups Revisions program (P9652A) enables you to define or revise groups that include several workstations.\n\nA location is a group of workstations and servers that corresponds to a physical location. For example, you might have locations for Corporate and Branch, or for Building 5 and Building 7. Locations are also useful if you use multitier deployment or deploy across a WAN. In this case, you might define a location for each of your geographic locations. The JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Locations Application program (P9654A) enables you to define or revise machines and locations in your enterprise.\n\nBoth of these applications simplify the deployment process when you need to deploy a package to several users. Rather than requiring you to schedule deployment to each workstation or server, you can schedule deployment according to location or group.\n\nWhen you enter a machine definition, you are really defining its usage in the configuration. For example, you can use a deployment server as a data server. When you enter machine definitions, consider these recommendations:\n\nAn HTML server can be defined only as an HTML server, not as a data server, enterprise server, and so on.\n\nA deployment server should not be used as a workstation.\n\nA deployment server can be used as a data server.\n\nA deployment server should not be used as an enterprise server for tuning and performance reasons.\n\n7.2.1.1 Locations\n\nIn some cases, an enterprise might span several buildings, cities, or countries. In these situations, you might deploy a package to a location rather than to individual workstations and servers. Then, a secondary deployment server at each location can deploy the package to the workstations and servers at that location.\n\nThe larger your enterprise, the more you can benefit from creating and deploying to locations. If you use multitier deployment to deploy packages to remote locations, the concept of locations is crucial.\n\nIn JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, a location is essentially a user-defined group of machines, databases, and environments. In some cases, the location is an actual physical location that is connected by a WAN, such as when you have remote offices that are geographically separate from your main office. For example, a location might be a floor in your office building, a separate building on the corporate campus, a branch office across town, or a facility in another city.\n\nAfter you create a new location, you can add workstations and servers for that location by defining the machine names that are associated with that location.\n\nThe topmost location that appears when you launch the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Locations Application program (P9654A) is the base location. You cannot change or remove this base location, but you can create or revise locations that are subordinate to it.\n\nWhen you create a location that is subordinate to another location, the original location is the parent location, and its subordinate location is the child location. For example, if you have a location called Seattle and then create a location called Redmond that is subordinate to Seattle, Seattle is the parent location and Redmond is the child location.\n\n7.2.1.2 Deployment Groups\n\nYou can create a deployment group based on department, team, or function. For example, you might have an administration group, a testing group, a production group, and so on.\n\nPackage deployment groups are particularly useful in large enterprises in which scheduling a package for deployment to several individual workstations is very time consuming. In these environments, you can deploy packages much more quickly when you use deployment groups.\n\nA group can contain a subgroup (a group within a group). For example, you might have a group called Quality Assurance that is a subgroup of the larger Development group.\n\nYou can help the person who builds and schedules packages by creating easily identifiable names for deployment groups. For example, for a group that includes quality assurance specialists who are responsible for testing, name the group Testing, rather than Green Team.\n\nSee Also\n\nChapter 10, \"Setting Up Multitier Deployment\".\n\n7.3.1 Understanding the Deployment Director\n\nAfter you define and build a package, use the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director program (P9631) to schedule the package for deployment to individual workstations, deployment servers, or enterprise servers. On the specified deployment date, users who are scheduled to receive the package can load the package when they sign in to JD Edwards EnterpriseOne.\n\nAlternatively, you can schedule the package to deployment groups or locations instead of specific machines. Deployment groups are useful in large enterprises that routinely deploy packages to many workstations and servers.\n\nThe JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director program (P9631) simplifies and expedites the process of scheduling and deploying built packages to workstations and servers. The director displays a series of forms that enable you to specify the package that you want to deploy, the deployment destinations, and the deployment time.\n\nAfter specifying the package that you want to deploy, you specify any of these destinations:\n\nClient workstation.\n\nEnterprise server.\n\nDeployment server or Deployment groups.\n\nLocations.\n\nYou can deploy a package either to specific workstations and servers, or you can schedule the deployment based on deployment groups or location. You cannot do both; you must select one of these methods.\n\nYou can make the package mandatory, which means that users cannot access the software until they have installed the package. If the package is optional, users will be given the option of installing the package every time that they sign in until they either install or decline the package.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Mandatory Installation option is applicable to client packages only.\n\nThe JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director requires that JD Edwards EnterpriseOne already be loaded on the workstation. You can schedule a new full package to replace the existing package, or an update package to be merged with the existing package on the workstation.\n\nThe JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director uses these tables:\n\nF9650\n\nF9651\n\nF9652\n\nF9653\n\nF9654\n\nF98825\n\nF988251\n\nF98826\n\nF9603\n\nF96031\n\nF98826H\n\nF988259\n\nThis table summarizes the function of each form in the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director:\n\nForm Name Form Usage Package Deployment Director form View this form for a description of the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director. Package Selection form Use this form to find and select the package that you want to deploy. Package Deployment Targets form Use this form to specify the destination for the package. You can select individual client workstations, deployment servers, and enterprise servers, or you can deploy the package to a deployment group or location. Package Deployment Attributes form Use this form to enter the date and time that you want to deploy the package. Also specify whether the package is mandatory (that is, it must be installed by every package recipient). Deployment Client Workstation Selection form Use this form to select each of the client workstations that will receive the package. Deployment Server Selection form Use this form to select each of the deployment servers that will receive the package. Enterprise Server Selection form Use this form to select each of the enterprise servers that will receive the package. Deployment Location Selection form Use this form to specify the deployment location that will receive the package. Deployment Groups Selection form Use this form to specify the deployment groups whose members will receive the package. Build Selection form For multitier deployment, use this form to specify the server or client package that you want to deploy to the destination deployment server. Work with Package Deployment form Use this form to review and revise the locations and package recipients that you entered through the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director.\n\n7.3.1.1 Using the Deployment Director\n\nAfter you have assembled and built the package, defined all machines, and verified the deployment groups, use the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director to specify package recipients and schedule the package for deployment.\n\nThroughout the deployment process, you can select to either proceed to the next form or return to the previous form. Also, regardless of where you are in the process, you can cancel it.\n\nWhen you schedule a package for deployment to a machine rather than a deployment group or location, you can schedule to deploy the package to client workstations, deployment servers, enterprise servers, or a combination. The forms that appear vary depending on your selection. For example, if you indicate that you want to schedule a package for deployment to client workstations and a deployment server, the forms for selecting specific workstations and deployment servers appear. If you schedule a package for deployment only to client workstations, the server selection form does not appear.\n\nWhen you access the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director, the Work with Package Deployment form enables you to view deployed package information by either machines, deployment groups, locations, or packages.\n\nDepending on your display selection, the tree displays different information when you expand it. This list describes the information that appears as you expand the tree level by level:\n\nMachines\n\nLevel One: Client Workstation, Deployment Server, Enterprise Server, and Business Service Application Server headings.\n\nLevel Two: Specific machines under each of these three headings.\n\nLevel Three: Specific packages that are deployed to the machine, if any.\n\nDeployment Groups\n\nLevel One: Specific groups.\n\nLevel Two: Members of those groups.\n\nLevel Three: Specific packages that are deployed to the group member.\n\nLocations\n\nLevel One: Specific locations.\n\nLevel Two: Client Workstation, Deployment Server, Enterprise Server, Business Service Application Server, and Remote Locations headings.\n\nLevel Three: Specific machines under the Client Workstation, Deployment Server, and Enterprise Server headings.\n\nLevel Three under Remote Locations only: Defined remote locations.\n\nLevel Four: Specific packages that are deployed to each machine, if any.\n\nLevel Four under Remote Locations only: Client Workstation, Deployment Server, and Enterprise Server headings.\n\nLevel Five under Remote Locations only: Specific machines under the Client Workstation, Deployment Server, and Enterprise Server headings.\n\nLevel Six under Remote Locations only: Specific packages that are deployed to each machine, if any.\n\nPackages\n\nLevel One: Package names.\n\nLevel Two: Client Workstation, Deployment Server, Enterprise Server, and Business Service Application Server headings.\n\nLevel Three: Package deployment dates and times for each heading.\n\nLevel Four: Specific machines that have deployed that package for that date and time.\n\n7.3.1.2 Activating Scheduled Packages\n\nAfter you successfully define a package deployment, you must activate the package so that it is available for installation using the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Workstation Installation program. If you do not activate the package, it will not be included in the list of available packages when users launch the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Workstation Installation program.\n\nIn some situations, you might need to control which packages are available for installation. If, for example, you have a package that is for the testing group only, you would want to make that package inactive so that it is not available for installation through the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Workstation Installation program. Instead, you can use JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Deployment Director program (P9631) to schedule this package for deployment to the members of the testing group.\n\n7.3.1.3 Installing a Scheduled Package\n\nWhen users receive a package, they can select to install it when they sign in to JD Edwards EnterpriseOne on or after the scheduled deployment date.\n\nIf the package is mandatory, users cannot access the system until they load the package.\n\nIf the package is optional, users can decline the package or postpone the installation until later. If they decide to postpone the installation, the software launches, and they will be given the opportunity to install the package the next time that they sign in.\n\n7.4.1 Understanding Server Package Deployment\n\nThe process for deploying a server package is nearly identical to that for deploying a package to a workstation. In both cases, you need to assemble, define, build, and schedule the package for deployment by using the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Package Assembly (P9601), Package Build Director (P9621), and Deployment Director (P9631) programs.\n\nAfter you schedule a server package for deployment, you must complete an additional step to launch the batch program that enables you to deploy to servers. You must perform this task whenever you deploy a package to an enterprise server or deployment server.\n\nImportant:\n\nYou can deploy UBE-only, APP-only, or UBE/APP-only packages at any time. Their deployment does not affect any UBEs that are currently running or those that are submitted.\n\nAll other types of server packages should be deployed only when necessary, because the enterprise server is not available to process business applications and batch processes during the installation process. The enterprise server does not actually shut down during package installation. Instead, the system queues any jobs that are submitted to the enterprise server and runs them as soon as the installation finishes. For this reason, you should schedule these server packages to be deployed after hours in order to minimize impact on users. Before you deploy a package to an enterprise server, verify that the services have been started and that no UBEs are active.\n\nTo further minimize impact on the network and users, if the development environment is on the same enterprise server as the production environment, consider preventing developers from moving their own objects through server packages. Instead, require that an administrator perform this function.\n\nTo deploy a server package, select Deploy from the Row menu on the Work with Package Deployment form. This is the same function that you use to deploy packages to deployment servers during multitier deployment.\n\nThe system determines which of the batch programs to call, based on what is currently selected on the Work with Package Deployment form when you select Deploy from the Row menu:\n\nIf a specific deployment server is selected, the system launches the Multi Tier Deployment batch program (R98825C).\n\nIf the deployment server folder is selected, the system launches the Multi Tier Deployment batch program for every deployment server that has a package scheduled.\n\nIf a specific enterprise server is selected, the system launches the Enterprise Server Deployment batch program (R98825D).\n\nIf the Enterprise Server folder is selected, the system launches the Enterprise Server Deployment batch program for every enterprise server that has a package scheduled.\n\nIf a specific package is selected, the system launches the Multi Tier Deployment batch program, and then the Enterprise Server Deployment batch program for the selected package.\n\nIf you sort by packages and the Deployment folder is selected, the system launches both the Multi Tier Deployment batch program and Enterprise Server Deployment batch programs for all packages.\n\nIf a specific workstation or the Workstations folder is selected, the Deploy option is unavailable.\n\nWhen the system launches a batch program for all servers or all packages, deployment does not occur unless the package has been previously scheduled for a specific server. A full package can be deployed to all servers. However, an update package can be deployed only to servers that already have the parent package deployed. Also, update packages cannot be deployed if the parent package is an inactive or not-deployed full package.\n\nWhen the system launches the batch program to deploy a UBE-only, APP-only, or UBE/APP-only package to an enterprise server, the batch process:\n\nVerifies that the enterprise server deployment location is the same as the Windows client submitting the package.\n\nChanges the enterprise server status to Pre Deploy.\n\nThis is done by changing the MDMCHRCDNM column to 50 in the F9651 table.\n\nIf this is an APP-only or UBE/APP-only package, then it waits one minute for the HTML server to find the deployment record.\n\nSends lock messages to the metadata kernel for the UBEs in the package on each selected enterprise server.\n\nOnce the package is being deployed, the UBEs in the package cannot be submitted.\n\nThis is done by changing the MDMCHRCDNM column to 10 in the F9651 table.\n\nUpdates the specifications in the database.\n\nSends unlock messages to all the enterprise servers to unlock the UBEs that were in the package.\n\nMarks the servers as available.\n\nThis is done by changing the MDMCHRCDNM column to 30 in the F9651 table.\n\nUpdates the F96511 table with the new package and spec data source information.\n\nThis information is used by the web servers.\n\nNote:\n\nA deployed package can be deployed multiple times to the same or different servers.\n\nWhen the system launches the batch program to deploy all other packages to an enterprise server, the batch process:\n\nVerifies that the enterprise server deployment location is the same as the Microsoft Windows client submitting the package.\n\nChanges the enterprise server status to Pre Deploy.\n\nThis is done by changing the MDMCHRCDNM column to 50 in the F9651 table.\n\nWaits for five minutes.\n\nSends lock messages to all the selected enterprise servers.\n\nOnce the servers are locked, the batch process marks them as unavailable.\n\nThis is done by changing the MDMCHRCDNM column to 10 in the F9651 table.\n\nCopies the BSFN executables from the package location to the live path code location.\n\nSets the spec.ini file to the new package and spec data source.\n\nSends unlock messages to all the enterprise servers.\n\nMarks the servers as available.\n\nThis is done by changing the MDMCHRCDNM column to 30 in the F9651 table.\n\nUpdates the F96511 table with the new package and spec data source information.\n\nThis information is used by the web servers.\n\nNote:\n\nA deployed package can be deployed multiple times to the same or different servers.\n\nA server package with the specs built in a shared mode can be deployed to a web server. This process of deploying to the web server is automatic and does not require any end user intervention. The web servers pool the package information from the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne logic server. It compares the package manifest from the spec tables to the one in its serialized database and makes the necessary updates.\n\nDuring server package deployment, the business function (BSFN) dll's, SRVPGMs, .so objects, or .sl objects of the live package are replaced by the objects from the built package. However, if a deployment fails, you may have a mismatched set of BSFNs and specs. With 8.96 JD Edwards EnterpriseOne clients, you can back up the existing BSFN objects. If the deployment fails, you can restore the BSFN objects. The option to back up the live BSFN objects before deployment can be enabled through the Build Settings within Server Manager.\n\nFor IBM i, the BSFN objects in PY900 are copied into the $PY900 library. For Microsoft Windows and UNIX, the BSFN and spec objects in PY900 are copied to the PY900_BACK folder. Clients can restore BSFN objects by copying the objects from the backup location to the live folder. They can restore the specs by changing the package name to the previous package in the spec.ini file.\n\n7.5.1 Understanding How to Install Workstations from CD\n\nIf your system includes a CD writer, you can build and deploy packages to the CD writer location. After copying the package to a CD, you can then use the CD as a portable deployment tier from which to perform workstation installations. That is, you can run from the CD the setup.exe program that launches the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Workstation Installation program.\n\nYou can set up your enterprise so that you can deploy packages to the CD writer and install the software from a CD.\n\nThe first step in the process of configuring your system for deployment from CD is to define the CD writer location if it is not already defined. In this step, you essentially create a pseudo deployment server from which you will later copy package data onto the CD by using the software for your CD writer.\n\nWhen you define the CD writer location in the Machine Identification application, you must also add the correct path codes to the Environments exit.\n\nThe process for defining this location is identical to the process for defining any other new deployment server."
