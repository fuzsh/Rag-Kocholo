        "text": "Packages and programs in Configuration Manager\n\nApplies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)\n\nConfiguration Manager continues to support packages and programs that were used in Configuration Manager 2007. A deployment that uses packages and programs might be more suitable than an application when you deploy any of the following tools or scripts:\n\nAdministrative tools that don't install an application on a computer\n\n\"One-off\" scripts that don't need to be continually monitored\n\nScripts that run on a recurring schedule and can't use global evaluation\n\nWhen you migrate packages from an earlier version of Configuration Manager, you can deploy them in your Configuration Manager hierarchy. After migration is complete, the packages appear in the Packages node in the Software Library workspace.\n\nYou can modify and deploy these packages in the same way you did by using software distribution. The Import Package from Definition Wizard remains in Configuration Manager to import legacy packages. Advertisements are converted to deployments when you migrate from Configuration Manager 2007 to a Configuration Manager hierarchy.\n\nPackages can use some new features of Configuration Manager, including distribution point groups and monitoring. You can't deploy Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) applications with packages and programs in Configuration Manager. To distribute virtual applications, create them as Configuration Manager applications. For more information, see Deploy App-V virtual applications.\n\nCreate a package and program\n\nUse the Create Package and Program wizard\n\nIn the Configuration Manager console, go to the Software Library workspace, expand Application Management, and select the Packages node.\n\nIn the Home tab of the ribbon, in the Create group, choose Create Package.\n\nOn the Package page of the Create Package and Program Wizard, specify the following information:\n\nName: Specify a name for the package with a maximum of 50 characters.\n\nDescription: Specify a description for this package with a maximum of 128 characters.\n\nManufacturer (optional): Specify a manufacturer name to help you identify the package in the Configuration Manager console. This name can be a maximum of 32 characters.\n\nLanguage (optional): Specify the language version of the package with a maximum of 32 characters.\n\nVersion (optional): Specify a version number for the package with a maximum of 32 characters.\n\nThis package contains source files: This setting indicates whether the package requires source files to be present on client devices. By default, the wizard doesn't enable this option, and Configuration Manager doesn't use distribution points for the package. When you select this option, specify the package content to distribute to distribution points.\n\nSource folder: If the package contains source files, choose Browse to open the Set Source Folder dialog box, and then specify the location of the source files for the package.\n\nNote\n\nThe computer account of the site server must have read access permissions to the source folder that you specify.\n\nWindows limits the source path to 256 characters or less. This limit applies to package source as well as applications. For more information, see Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces.\n\nIf you want to pre-cache content on a client, specify the Architecture and Language of the package. For more information, see Configure pre-cache content.\n\nOn the Program Type page of the Create Package and Program Wizard, select the Standard program type for computers. Or you can skip this step and create a program later.\n\nTip\n\nTo create a new program for an existing package, first select the package. Then, in the Home tab, in the Package group, choose Create Program to open the Create Program Wizard.\n\nThe Program for device type is a legacy option that only applies to mobile devices, which aren't currently managed by Configuration Manager.\n\nCustom icons for packages\n\nStarting in version 2203, add custom icons for packages. These icons appear in Software Center when you deploy the package and program. Instead of a default icon, a custom icon can improve the user experience to better identify the software.\n\nOn the General tab of package properties, in the section for the icon, select Browse. Select an icon from the default shell library, or browse to another file in a local or network path.\n\nIt supports the following file types:\n\nPrograms (.exe)\n\nLibraries (.dll)\n\nIcons (.ico)\n\nImages (.png, .jpeg, .jpg)\n\nThe file doesn't need to be on clients that you target with the deployment. Configuration Manager includes the image with the deployment policy.\n\nThe maximum file size for an image is 256 KB.\n\nIcons can have pixel dimensions of up to 512 x 512.\n\nWhen clients receive the deployment policy, they'll display the icon in Software Center.\n\nNote\n\nTo take full advantage of new Configuration Manager features, after you update the site, also update clients to the latest version. While new functionality appears in the Configuration Manager console when you update the site and console, the complete scenario isn't functional until the client version is also the latest.\n\nCreate a program\n\nOn the Program Type page of the Create Package and Program Wizard, choose Standard Program, and then choose Next.\n\nOn the Standard Program page, specify the following information:\n\nName: Specify a name for the program with a maximum of 50 characters.\n\nNote\n\nThe program name must be unique within a package. After you create a program, you can't modify its name.\n\nCommand Line: Enter the command line to use to start this program, or choose Browse to browse to the file location.\n\nIf you don't specify an extension for a file name, Configuration Manager attempts to use .com, .exe, and .bat as possible extensions.\n\nWhen the client runs the program, Configuration Manager searches for the file in the following locations:\n\nWithin the package\n\nThe local Windows folder\n\nThe local %path%\n\nIf it can't find the file, the program fails.\n\nStartup folder (optional): Specify the folder from which the program runs, up to 127 characters. This folder can be an absolute path on the client. It can also be a path that's relative to the distribution point folder that contains the package.\n\nRun: Specify the mode in which the program runs on client computers. Select one of the following options:\n\nNormal: The program runs in the normal mode based on system and program defaults. This mode is the default.\n\nMinimized: The program runs minimized on client devices. Users might see installation activity in the notification area or on the taskbar.\n\nMaximized: The program runs maximized on client devices. Users see all installation activity.\n\nHidden: The program runs hidden on client devices. Users don't see any installation activity.\n\nProgram can run: Specify whether the program runs only when a user is signed in, only when no user is signed in, or regardless of whether a user is signed in to the client computer.\n\nRun mode: Specify whether the program runs with administrative permissions or with the permissions of the user who's currently signed in.\n\nAllow users to view and interact with the program installation: Use this setting, if available, to specify whether to allow users to interact with the program installation. This option is only available if the following conditions are met:\n\nProgram can run setting is Only when a user is logged on or Whether or not a user is logged on\n\nRun mode setting is to Run with administrative rights\n\nDrive mode: Specify information about how this program runs on the network. Choose one of the following options:\n\nRuns with UNC name: Specify that the program runs with a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) name. This setting is the default.\n\nRequires drive letter: Specify that the program requires a drive letter to fully qualify its location. For this setting, Configuration Manager can use any available drive letter on the client. This setting requires the deployment to use the Deployment option Run program from distribution point and the package's Data Access option enabled to Copy the content in this package to a package share on distribution points.\n\nRequires specific drive letter: Specify that the program requires a specific drive letter that you specify to fully qualify its location. For example, Z:. If the client is already using the specified drive letter, the program doesn't run. This setting requires the deployment to use the Deployment option Run program from distribution point and the package's Data Access option enabled to Copy the content in this package to a package share on distribution points.\n\nReconnect to distribution point at log on: Indicate whether the client reconnects to the distribution point when the user signs in. By default, the wizard doesn't enable this option.\n\nOn the Requirements page of the Create Package and Program Wizard, specify the following information:\n\nRun another program first: Identify a package and program that runs before this package and program runs.\n\nPlatform requirements: Select This program can run on any platform or This program can run only on specified platforms. Then choose the OS versions that clients must have to install this package and program.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you run a task sequence from boot media or PXE, Configuration Manager ignores this option. The task sequence runs as though the option This program can run on any platform is selected.\n\nEstimated disk space: Specify the amount of disk space that the program requires to run on the computer. The default setting is Unknown. If necessary, specify a whole number greater than or equal to zero. If you set a value, also select units for the value.\n\nMaximum allowed run time (minutes): Specify the maximum time that you expect the program to run on the client computer. The default value is 120 minutes. Only use whole numbers greater than zero.\n\nImportant\n\nIf the targeted computers to which you deploy this program have a maintenance window, a conflict could occur if the Maximum allowed run time is longer than the scheduled maintenance window. If you set the maximum run time to Unknown, the program starts to run during the maintenance window. It then continues to run as needed after the maintenance window is closed. If you set the maximum run time to a specific period that's greater than the length of any available maintenance window, then the client doesn't run the program.\n\nIf you set this value to Unknown, Configuration Manager sets the maximum allowed run time as 12 hours (720 minutes).\n\nNote\n\nIf the program exceeds the maximum run time, Configuration Manager stops it if the following conditions are met:\n\nYou enable the option to Run with administrative rights\n\nYou don't enable the option to Allow users to view and interact with the program installation\n\nDeploy packages and programs\n\nIn the Configuration Manager console, go to the Software Library workspace, expand Application Management, and select the Packages node.\n\nSelect the package that you want to deploy. In the Home tab of the ribbon, in the Deployment group, choose Deploy.\n\nOn the General page of the Deploy Software Wizard, specify the name of the package and program that you want to deploy. Select the collection to which you want to deploy the package and program, and any optional comments.\n\nTo store the package content on the collection's default distribution point group, select the option to Use default distribution point groups associated to this collection. If you didn't associate this collection with a distribution point group, this option is unavailable.\n\nOn the Content page, choose Add. Select the distribution points or distribution point groups to which you want to distribute the content for this package and program.\n\nOn the Deployment Settings page, configure the following settings:\n\nPurpose: Choose one of the following options:\n\nAvailable: The user sees the published package and program in Software Center and can install it on demand.\n\nRequired: The package and program is deployed automatically, according to the configured schedule. In Software Center, you can track its deployment status and install it before the deadline.\n\nNote\n\nIf multiple users are signed into the device, package and task sequence deployments may not appear in Software Center.\n\nSend wake-up packets: If you set the deployment purpose to Required and select this option, the site first sends a wake-up packet to computers at the installation deadline time. Before you can use this option, configure computers for Wake On LAN. For more information, see How to configure Wake on LAN.\n\nAllow clients on a metered Internet connection to download content after the installation deadline, which might incur additional costs\n\nNote\n\nWhen you deploy a package and program, the option to Pre-deploy software to the user's primary device isn't available.\n\nOn the Scheduling page, configure when to deploy this package and program to client devices.\n\nThe options on this page vary depending on whether you set the deployment action to Available or Required.\n\nFor Required deployments, configure the rerun behavior for the program from the Rerun behavior drop-down menu. Choose from the following options:\n\nRerun behavior Description Never rerun deployed program The client won't rerun the program. This behavior happens even if the program originally failed or if the program files are changed. Always rerun program The client always reruns the program when the deployment is scheduled. This behavior happens even if the program has already successfully run. It's useful with recurring deployments when you update the program. Rerun if failed previous attempt The client reruns the program when the deployment is scheduled, only if it failed on the previous run attempt. Rerun if succeeded on previous attempt The client reruns the program only if it previously ran successfully on the client. This behavior is useful with recurring deployments when you routinely update the program, and each update requires the previous update to be successfully installed.\n\nOn the User Experience page, specify the following information:\n\nAllow users to run the program independently of assignments: Users can install this software from Software Center regardless of any scheduled installation time.\n\nSoftware installation: Allows the software to be installed outside of any configured maintenance windows.\n\nSystem restart (if required to complete the installation): If the software installation requires a device restart to finish, allow this action to happen outside of any configured maintenance windows.\n\nEmbedded devices: When you deploy packages and programs to Windows Embedded devices that are write-filter-enabled, you can specify that they install packages and programs on the temporary overlay and commit changes later. Alternately, commit the changes on the installation deadline or during a maintenance window. When you commit changes on the installation deadline or during a maintenance window, a restart is required, and the changes persist on the device.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you deploy a package or program to a Windows Embedded device, make sure that the device is a member of a collection that has a configured maintenance window. For more information about how maintenance windows are used when you deploy packages and programs to Windows Embedded devices, see Creating Windows Embedded applications.\n\nOn the Distribution Points page, specify the following information:\n\nDeployment options: Specify the action that a client when it uses a distribution point in its current boundary group. Also select the action for the client when it uses a distribution point from a neighbor boundary group or the default site boundary group.\n\nImportant\n\nIf you configure the deployment option to Run program from distribution point, make sure to enable the option to Copy the content in this package to a package share on distribution points on the Data Access tab of the package properties. Otherwise the package is unavailable to run from distribution points.\n\nAllow clients to use distribution points from the default site boundary group: When this content isn't available from any distribution point in the current or neighbor boundary groups, enable this option to let them try distribution points in the site default boundary group.\n\nComplete the wizard.\n\nView the deployment in the Deployments node of the Monitoring workspace and in the details pane of the package deployment tab when you select the deployment. For more information, see Monitor packages and programs.\n\nMonitor packages and programs\n\nTo monitor package and program deployments, use the same procedures that you use to monitor applications as detailed in Monitor applications.\n\nPackages and programs also include a number of built-in reports, which enable you to monitor information about the deployment status of packages and programs. These reports have the report category of Software Distribution - Packages and Programs and Software Distribution - Package and Program Deployment Status.\n\nFor more information about how to configure reporting in Configuration Manager, see Introduction to reporting.\n\nManage packages and programs\n\nIn the Software Library workspace, expand Application Management, and select the Packages node. Select the package that you want to manage, and then choose a management task.\n\nCreate Prestage Content File\n\nOpens the Create Prestaged Content File Wizard, to create a file that contains the package content. Use this file to manually import the package to a remote distribution point. This action is useful when you have low network bandwidth between the site server and the distribution point.\n\nCreate Program\n\nOpens the Create Program Wizard, to create a new program for this package.\n\nExport\n\nOpens the Export Package Wizard, to export the selected package and its content to a file. Use this file to import the file to another hierarchy.\n\nDeploy\n\nOpens the Deploy Software Wizard, to deploy the selected package and program to a collection. For more information, see Deploy packages and programs.\n\nDistribute content\n\nOpens the Distribute Content Wizard, to send the content for a package and program to selected distribution points or distribution point groups.\n\nImport\n\nOpens the Import Package Wizard, to import a previously exported package from a .zip file.\n\nTip\n\nWhen you import an object in the Configuration Manager console, it imports to the current folder. In earlier versions, Configuration Manager always put imported objects in the root node.\n\nUpdates distribution points with the latest content for the selected package and program.\n\nNext steps"
