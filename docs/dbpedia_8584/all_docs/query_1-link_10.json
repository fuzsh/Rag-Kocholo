        "text": "I want to publish package about sdl_mixer, it's a native package. I did as tutorial said. I put .dll .hand .lib files into package content, but the final package didn't work. So what is right way to create c++ nuget package?\n\nAnother question: I found in nuget, most native c++ package are published in two packages, for example:\n\nsdl2_ttf.v140\n\nsdl2_ttf.v140.redist\n\nWhat is difference between those two files? And how can I publish my packages like that?\n\nUpdate:\n\nI followed the tutorial on how to publish native packages. I have written the following autopkg file\n\nnuget{ nuspec { id = MySdl_mixer; version :2.0.0.0; title: sdl mixer; authors: { Sam Lantinga, Stephane Peter, Ryan Gordon}; owners: {spartawhy117}; licenseUrl: \"http://libsdl.org/license.php\"; projectUrl: \"http://libsdl.org/index.php\"; iconUrl:\"\"; requireLicenseAcceptance:false; summary:Nothing; description: @\"SDL_mixer is a sample multi-channel audio mixer library.... \"; releaseNotes: \"Release of C++ \"; copyright:Copyright 2015; tags: {v140 ,sdl_mixer , native, CoApp }; }; files { #defines { Include = include\\; Bin = bin64\\; Lib = lib64\\; } include:{\"${Include}*\"}; [x64,v140,debug,desktop]{ lib: ${Lib}SDL2_mixer.lib; bin: ${Bin}SDL2_mixer.dll； } [x64,v140,release,desktop]{ lib: ${Lib}SDL2_mixer.lib; bin: ${Bin}SDL2_mixer.dll； } }; targets { Defines += HAS_SDLMIXER; }; }\n\nRunning the command Write-NuGetPackage .\\sdl_mixer.autopkg returns an error unexpected input of the end. What is the problem here?\n\nI searched around for days until I found there is really no help out there on the internet at all. I did managed to piece together how to do it, and through trial and error got it working well. Which I have documented here:\n\nhttps://digitalhouseblog.wordpress.com/2019/08/22/how-to-make-a-nuget-package-for-c/\n\nBut I'll summarize here anyways:\n\nGather or stage your native library files into a folder of your choosing.\n\nCreate a *.nuspec file in that folder.\n\nEdit the *.nuspec file to include the files you want to include in your package.\n\nCreate a *.props file\n\nCall nuget pack to create the package.\n\nPush the nuget package to a feed somewhere.\n\nCreate a packages.config file.\n\nEdit the visual studio project file to import the *.props file\n\nNotice that the nuget tools inside the visual studio IDE are NEVER used. You have to do a LOT manually. See the link for full details and explanations.\n\n0xced\n\n26k1111 gold badges105105 silver badges257257 bronze badges\n\nanswered Aug 22, 2019 at 20:25\n\nC.J.C.J.\n\n16k1010 gold badges6464 silver badges7979 bronze badges"
