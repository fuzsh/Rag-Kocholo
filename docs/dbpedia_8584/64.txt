I want to publish package about sdl_mixer, it's a native package. I did as tutorial said. I put .dll .hand .lib files into package content, but the final package didn't work. So what is right way to create c++ nuget package?

Another question: I found in nuget, most native c++ package are published in two packages, for example:

sdl2_ttf.v140

sdl2_ttf.v140.redist

What is difference between those two files? And how can I publish my packages like that?

Update:

I followed the tutorial on how to publish native packages. I have written the following autopkg file

nuget{ nuspec { id = MySdl_mixer; version :2.0.0.0; title: sdl mixer; authors: { Sam Lantinga, Stephane Peter, Ryan Gordon}; owners: {spartawhy117}; licenseUrl: "http://libsdl.org/license.php"; projectUrl: "http://libsdl.org/index.php"; iconUrl:""; requireLicenseAcceptance:false; summary:Nothing; description: @"SDL_mixer is a sample multi-channel audio mixer library.... "; releaseNotes: "Release of C++ "; copyright:Copyright 2015; tags: {v140 ,sdl_mixer , native, CoApp }; }; files { #defines { Include = include\; Bin = bin64\; Lib = lib64\; } include:{"${Include}*"}; [x64,v140,debug,desktop]{ lib: ${Lib}SDL2_mixer.lib; bin: ${Bin}SDL2_mixer.dll； } [x64,v140,release,desktop]{ lib: ${Lib}SDL2_mixer.lib; bin: ${Bin}SDL2_mixer.dll； } }; targets { Defines += HAS_SDLMIXER; }; }

Running the command Write-NuGetPackage .\sdl_mixer.autopkg returns an error unexpected input of the end. What is the problem here?

I searched around for days until I found there is really no help out there on the internet at all. I did managed to piece together how to do it, and through trial and error got it working well. Which I have documented here:

https://digitalhouseblog.wordpress.com/2019/08/22/how-to-make-a-nuget-package-for-c/

But I'll summarize here anyways:

Gather or stage your native library files into a folder of your choosing.

Create a *.nuspec file in that folder.

Edit the *.nuspec file to include the files you want to include in your package.

Create a *.props file

Call nuget pack to create the package.

Push the nuget package to a feed somewhere.

Create a packages.config file.

Edit the visual studio project file to import the *.props file

Notice that the nuget tools inside the visual studio IDE are NEVER used. You have to do a LOT manually. See the link for full details and explanations.
