        "text": "Kelly Clarkson has started doing the promotional rounds for her sixth studio album, Piece by Piece, which will be released on March 3. One of her first stop was at CBS Sunday Morning where the singer shared about growing up in a tumultuous home, how her parent's divorce affected her view of relationships and life with her perfect baby River Rose.\n\nOn how her broken family impacted how she looked at love:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI never thought, honestly, I would get married, or fall in, like, love like they said in the movies. And not so because I didn't think it was true, you know, I just wasn't presented with that growing up. I just didn't know it was possible.\n\nOn growing up worrying about money:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe lived pre-pay check to pre-pay check. So I definitely had this whole mentality, I was like, whatever I'm gonna do, I just don't wanna have to worry that. I always used to hate when people would be like, money doesn't buy everything, when you are little and poor. Rich people say that. Not poor people, I don't know one poor person that's going, money doesn't buy happiness, it pays you to get out of eviction notices.\n\nOn life in Nashville:\n\nNews Roundups\n\nCatch up on the day's news you need to know.\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nI chose Nashville because it's avery musical community, and you know with New York and L.A. they're very musical and everyone lives there in general, but I just wanted to live somewhere that reminded me of home.\n\nOn how her reaction to gossip changed when she turned 30:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my 20's, yes, I felt that pressure all the time. Everybody always had something to say, musically, physically, what I was saying disappointed, whatever. Once I hit 30, I don't know what happened, but like, I'm cool, if you think that I should do that, that's awesome, that's great for you in your world, but like this is what's happening in my world, this is what I'm rocking musically, this is what I'm rocking physically, this is what I'm rocking emotionally. You can either love it, or you don't have to, there's plenty of other artists out there to love and adore.\n\nSee the full interview below. As always, Kelly is a pleasure to watch, and very funny too.\n\nRand Duren. Social media dude for GuideLive. Lover of reality TV, delicious food, art, flashy colors and all things Pop.
