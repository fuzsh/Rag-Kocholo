        "text": "Kelly Clarkson has captured the hearts of America since rising to fame on American Idol more than a decade ago. The Grammy-winning singer is one of the best-selling contestants of all time, and continues to put out chart-topping songs year after year. But few people realize that the Texas native's connection to country music runs even deeper than her own albums. Clarkson has a special connection to the \"Queen of Country\" herself, Reba McEntire.\n\nReba married manager and guitarist Narvel Blackstock in 1989, making her the stepmother to his three children: Shawna, Chassidy, and Brandon Blackstock. Years later, in 2013, Brandon and Kelly tied the knot—making Kelly Reba's daughter-in-law.\n\nEven before the two superstars became family, they were big fans of each other's music. They first performed together in 2007, when they teamed up for a duet version of Kelly's hit \"Because of You.\" A year later the singers shared the stage on a North American tour.\n\nReba and Narvel divorced in 2015, and Kelly and Brandon have since divorced too, but Kelly and her former mother-in-law remain connected, especially now that they share the stage on The Voice, where Kelly is a coach and Reba is a mega-mentor. Reba also shared that the Idol alum used to ask her for music advice—though now, with a booming career of her own, Kelly probably doesn't need it."
