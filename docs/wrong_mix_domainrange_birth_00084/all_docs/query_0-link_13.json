Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson and John Legend returned as coaches for their nineteenth, sixth, and fourth seasons, respectively. Gwen Stefani rejoined the panel for her fifth season, after being replaced by Nick Jonas the previous season. Meanwhile, Carson Daly returned for his nineteenth season as host.[1]\n\nStarting from this season, the studio version of all performances are released on YouTube Music instead of iTunes as before. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the bonus multiplier for downloads is not present for the second consecutive season as performances being recorded away from the studios; additionally, the entire season is filmed without a physical studio audience.[2]\n\nCarter Rubin was named the winner of the season, marking Gwen Stefani's first win as a coach and Rubin as the youngest male winner (and second-youngest winner overall at the time of his victory, only behind season 14's winner Brynn Cartelli). After five attempts, Stefani also became the fourth female coach to win the competition, following Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, and Kelly Clarkson.[3]\n\nOn June 16, 2020, NBC announced that there would be a change in the coaches for this season. Blake Shelton would return for his nineteenth season, Kelly Clarkson for her sixth, and John Legend for his fourth. However, Nick Jonas opted not to return, allowing the return of Gwen Stefani after a one-season hiatus, marking her fifth season as a coach on the show.[4] Carson Daly returned as host.\n\nThis season's advisors for the Battles were: Kane Brown for Team Blake, Leon Bridges for Team Kelly, Miguel for Team Legend, and Julia Michaels for Team Gwen. Usher served as a mega-mentor for all teams during the Knockouts.\n\n\"Carter Rubin\" redirects here.

The advisors for this round were Leon Bridges for Team Kelly, Julia Michaels for Team Gwen, Miguel for Team Legend, and Kane Brown for Team Blake. The coaches can steal one losing artist from other coaches and save one losing artist on their team. However, the team coach may only hit their button to save an artist after it is clear that no other coach is going to steal the artist.[5] Artists who win their battle or are stolen by another coach advance to the Knockout Rounds.\n\nBattles color key Artist won the Battle and advanced to the Knockouts Artist lost the Battle, but was stolen by another coach, and, advanced to the Knockouts Artist lost the Battle, but was saved by their coach, and, advanced to the four-way Knockout Artist lost the Battle and was eliminated\n\nBattles results Episodes Coach Order Winner Song Loser 'Steal'/'Save' result Kelly Gwen John Blake Episode 6\n\n(Monday, Nov. 9, 2020) Blake 1 Worth the Wait \"Little White Church\" Taryn Papa – – – ✔ John 2 Tamara Jade \"Hard Place\" Olivia Reyes – – – – Kelly 3 Madeline Consoer \"Nobody Wants To Be Lonely\" Eli Zamora – – – – Gwen 4 Payge Turner \"If the World Was Ending\" Lauren Frihauf – N/A ✔ ✔ Blake 5 Jus Jon \"Dancing with a Stranger\" Payton Lamar – – Steal used Save used John 6 Bailey Rae \"Tennessee Whiskey\" Sid Kingsley ✔ – N/A – Episode 7\n\n(Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2020) Kelly 1 DeSz \"If You Don't Know Me by Now\" Joseph Soul N/A ✔ Steal used – Blake 2 Jim Ranger \"Good as You\" John Sullivan Steal used Steal used Save used Kelly 3 Tanner Gomes \"Whiskey Lullaby\" Skylar Alyvia Mayton – – Gwen 4 Chloé Hogan \"Adore You\" Lain Roy Steal used – – John 5 John Holiday \"Summer Soft\" Julia Cooper Steal used ✔ – Episode 8\n\n(Monday, Nov. 16, 2020) Gwen 1 Carter Rubin \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" Larriah Jackson Steal used ✔ Team full – Blake 2 Ian Flanigan \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\" Aaron Scott Team full Save used John 3 Casmè \"You're All I Need to Get By\" Rio Souma – Kelly 4 Marisa Corvo \"I Surrender\" Ryan Gallagher ✔ – 5 Kelsie Watts \"I Love Me\" Emmalee Team full – Blake 6 Ben Allen \"Free\" Sam Stacy Save used Gwen 7 Van Andrew \"Exile\" Tori Miller – 8 Ryan Berg \"I Need a Dollar\" Liam St. John – John 9 Cami Clune \"Wicked Game\" James Pyle ✔\n\nIn the Knockouts round, each coach can steal one losing artist from another team. Artists who win their knockout or are stolen by another coach advance to the Live Playoffs. Former coach Usher will serve as the mega mentor for all teams in this round.[6][7] This season, each saved artist from the Battle Rounds will go head-to-head in the four-way Knockout.
