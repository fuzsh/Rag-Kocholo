        "text": "When The Kelly Clarkson Show first debuted on NBC in September 2019, no one would've thought the series would become a daytime phenomenon.\n\nWith American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson as the host of the series, the premise was not unlike other talk shows. Fans would tune in every weekday to watch the singer interact with Hollywood's biggest names, along with people from all over the country who had incredible stories to tell. If that wasn't enough, she brought in a live studio audience to see her film each episode, where people saw her charm everyone watching in-person or at home. And to top it all off, Kelly introduced the \"Kellyoke\" segment, showcasing her incredible vocal range with musical covers from all different genres.\n\nNeedless to say, folks loved seeing Kelly in this new role, and many ventured out to Los Angeles, where The Kelly Clarkson Show initially filmed. But after four years on the air, the host decided to make a change, leading everyone now to wonder: Where is The Kelly Clarkson Show filmed? Well, The Voice alum revealed a big shift ahead of the season 5 premiere in 2023, and she's spoken out about the reason why she made this decision.\n\nWhere is The Kelly Clarkson Show filmed?\n\nIn 2024, The Kelly Clarkson Show films its episodes in 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.\n\nWhat's more, the series currently tapes in Studio 6A, which Variety noted was once home to late night talk shows for Jimmy Fallon, Conan O'Brien and David Letterman. The show also films down the hall from The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, which currently airs out of Studio 6B.\n\nSo, what made Kelly decide to make the move from the West Coast to the East Coast? When she appeared on Late Night With Seth Meyers in October 2023, she explained how it had to do with her needing a personal change for both her and her kids (daughter River Rose and son Remington \"Remy\" Alexander ) amid her 2020 divorce from ex-husband Brandon Blackstock .\n\n\"I really needed a fresh start, on a personal note,\" she told host Seth Meyers. \"It's been a rough few years, and I just needed it. So, I don't know that I've done this show this kind of happy before.\"\n\nThe Daytime Emmy Award winner shared a similar sentiment when speaking with USA Today about moving The Kelly Clarkson Show to New York City that same month, stating while she'd love to film the daytime series from her ranch in Montana, this felt like a good compromise.\n\n\"I’ll be real honest: I thought I was making a horrible decision,\" she revealed at the time. “I knew I needed a fresh start and couldn’t be in LA. I really wanted to be in Montana, but you can’t really do a show from there quite yet. So I was like, 'The only other option would probably be New York.'\""
