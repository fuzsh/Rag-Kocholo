        "text": "Kelly Clarkson made a meteoric rise to stardom after singing and winning the first season of American Idol in 2002. Kelly is now one of America’s favorite entertainers, judge on The Voice and host of her new NBC talk show. Ten years after her American Idol win, Kelly bought a Tennessee lake home in Hendersonville, 25 miles up the Cumberland River from Nashville. Her Tennessee mansion is for sale, priced at $7.49 million.\n\nMust SeeTop 10 Florida Condos For Sale\n\nWho needs a vacation when you could live in a home designed to take full advantage of its recreational waterfront setting with a boating distance of almost a hundred river miles, water ski, fish, jet ski, swim or explore the endless Old Hickory Lake shoreline by boat or one of the Tennessee waterside parks? Or go by boat to the Rudder Restaurant at the Anchor High Marina to enjoy some good food by the water while enjoying live music from some of Nashville’s best local stars.\n\nThe Clarkson house is positioned on four acres with an adjoining useable two acres owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. With its outward curving shoreline, the water views are exceptional and a two-boat covered boathouse with a lift that is near the left property line so as not to interfere with the views. There is a long gated driveway to the entrance car park with center fountain. Grounds are dotted with mature trees, lots of emerald lawn, a sand volleyball court, English-style gardens, a conservatory/greenhouse and large pool/spa terrace with pavilion for outdoor dining with fireplace, all accessed via a double-sided-curved staircase descending from the upper terrace. The size of the grounds invites children into a safe place to build forts and play Swiss Family Robinson with anticipation of sailing in little boats as they get older.\n\nThe 20,121-square-foot house has plenty of space for family, friends and stay-overs. The home’s entrance is into a grand foyer with soaring double staircases, the heart of the home is filled with family warmth and fun for casual entertaining, particularly the cowboy bar with its saddle bar stools. Included are seven bedrooms, one of which is a large master suite with seating area in front of a fireplace and stunning master bath, eleven baths, family room, movie theater and a children’s room with four built-in bunk beds and good-sized play area. There is a billiard/game room, additional seating rooms, large gym, a two-level office and an elevator.\n\nSinger, songwriter and talk-show host, Kelly Clarkson, is now living near the California studio where she is filming The Voice and her weekly talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, and is selling her lakefront home near Nashville. Priced at $7.49 million, Jack Miller, the listing broker, is with stutts-miller properties at PARKS Real Estate, Nashville.\n\nPhoto credit: Parks Realty"
