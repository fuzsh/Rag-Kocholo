        "text": "NBC Insider was lucky enough to attend a taping of the Season 4 premiere, which took place in New York City (though the series at that point normally filmed in Los Angeles).\n\nThe energy was infectious even before Clarkson stepped on stage, thanks to hype man Rubin Ervin. When the interviews rolled around, Clarkson treated each of her guests with a warm familiarity, which is wonderful to experience firsthand. But it's the performances that stick with you — an unsurprisingly surreal experience to witness live.\n\n\"There's nothing like witnessing the American Idol winner's powerful vocals in person,\" NBC Insider's McKenzie Jean-Phillipe reported. \"As she hit those seemingly impossible high notes that filled the room, I actually heard audience members gasp all around me. It was like we were at our very own private Kelly Clarkson concert.\"\n\nWhile the first four seasons were filmed in Universal City, California, the show moved to NYC for Season 5 — specifically Studio 6A at 30 Rock.\n\n“I’m so excited to start our fifth season at the iconic 30 Rock,” Clarkson said before the season began. “There is such a unique energy and creative spirit that comes with filming in New York City. Y’all ready?”\n\nThe Kelly Clarkson Show debuted in September 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, episodes were shot from Clarkson’s home from April 2020 to September 2020 with a virtual audience. The studio audience returned in September 2021 with the premiere of Season 3.\n\nRELATED: See Kelly Clarkson's Stunning Surprise NYC Subway Performance a Fan Posted on TikTok\n\nOn November 7, 2022, it was announced that The Kelly Clarkson Show was renewed for two more seasons, through 2025.\n\n\"Kelly Clarkson is one of the brightest stars of our time,” said Tracie Wilson, executive vice president of Syndication Studios and E! News at NBCUniversal said at the time. “With more than 500 hours viewed on broadcast, cable, and digital platforms since its launch, The Kelly Clarkson Show has been a home for stories that entertain, inspire important conversations, and connect with loyal viewers across multiple generations in meaningful ways. Together, with our best-in-class producing team, we’ll continue to build on the show’s success and legacy.”\n\nThe show’s format revolves around interviewing a variety of celebrity guests as well as everyday people and getting their fascinating stories.\n\nPrevious guests include fellow Coaches on The Voice like Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton, and John Legend, where she gets more details about their prolific careers and personal lives. With the guests, she also often plays whimsical games such as “This Or That” or “A Quiet Case” for some serious laughs.\n\nThe Kelly Clarkson Show has won 19 total Daytime Emmy Awards, including the honors of Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host four times (2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023), and Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show three times (2021, 2022, and 2023).\n\nClarkson had the sweetest reaction to her show's nine nominations in 2022. During the 2021 Virtual Emmys, Clarkson's acceptance speech recognized contributions of the entire team.\n\nRELATED: See Kelly Clarkson's Kids River & Remy Sing and Dance with Her Onstage in Vegas\n\n\"Thank you so much everybody for voting for me,” she gushed. “I would love to accept the award just for me, but honestly, I think everybody that's ever done a show like this knows there's a whole heap of people standing around behind the cameras. And our staff and making me look good and sound good and getting these brilliant stories and heartfelt stories that we get to share with everybody, and thank you to my band...I thank you for the award, but honestly, so many people are deserving of this—not just me.\""
