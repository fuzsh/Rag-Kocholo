        "text": "Kelly Clarkson, 39, has remained a staple of music and television, since making her debut on American Idol’s first season in 2002. Since winning the singing competition, she’s recorded numerous hits, like “Since U Been Gone” and “My Life Would Suck Without You.” Since becoming a music sensation, she’s also been a coach on The Voice and began hosting her own talk show in 2019. She married talent manager Brandon Blackstock, 44, in 2013, and the pair had a daughter in 2014 and a son in 2016. Kelly filed for divorce from Brandon in June 2020, and has primary custody of both kids. Brandon had two other children from his previous marriage to Melissa Ashworth: Savannah and Seth. Find out more about each kid here!\n\nRiver Rose\n\nKelly gave birth to her first daughter River Rose Blackstock, 7, in 2014! The singer explained how she named the little girl in a 2015 interview with People, saying she likes androgynous names. “We live on a river, so it really wasn’t that creative,” she said. “We were outside on our balcony, and we both looked at each other and were like, ‘What about River? That’s kind of cool.’” The singer also said that River’s middle name was chosen, because it’s her mom’s maiden name, and she enjoyed the alliteration.\n\nThe “Because Of You” singer occasionally posts pictures of her kids, and on a few occasions, she has shown some adorable photos of the kids on Instagram! During quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic, Kelly posted a cute picture of River getting a horseback riding lesson from her dad. Other than horseback riding, River has made a few appearances in her mom’s work. She could sweetly be seen dancing in her mama’s arms in the music video for “Broken and Beautiful.” The Grammy winner also made her little girl the main character of two children’s books that she wrote: River Rose and the Magical Lullaby and River Rose and the Magical Christmas.\n\nRemington Alexander\n\nKelly had her son Remington Alexander Blackstock, 5, in 2016. Days after Remington (also known as Remy) was born, she tweeted about how happy she was to have two little ones. “I have the coolest kids, most helpful/loving family, & it would [be] impossible [for me to be] happier. I’m filled w/love. I want everyone [to] have this!” she wrote."
