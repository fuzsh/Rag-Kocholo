        "meta_description": "Kelly Clarkson (born Kelly Brianne Clarkson, April 24, 1982; Kelly Brianne in private) is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. She rose to fame after winning the first season of American Idol in 2002, which earned her a record deal with RCA Records. Her debut single, \"A Moment Like This\", topped the US Billboard Hot 100, and became the country's best-selling single of 2002. It was included on her debut studio album, Thankful (2003), which entered the Billboard 200 at number one, and also yielded the top-10 single \"Miss Independent\". Trying to reinvent her image, Clarkson parted ways with Idol management and shifted to pop rock for her second studio album, Breakaway (2004). Supported by four US top-ten singles – the title track, \"Since U Been Gone\", \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", and \"Because of You\" – Breakaway sold over 12 million copies worldwide and won two Grammy Awards.\r\nClarkson took further creative control for her third studio album, My December",
