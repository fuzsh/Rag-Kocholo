        "text": "To celebrate her 42nd Birthday, Kelly Clarkson was joined by Heart’s Ann and Nancy Wilson to share stories from the past and perform their classic songs together.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s episode of The Kelly Clarkson show, Ann shared that “Crazy on You” was the duo’s “first song I ever recorded as a singer in a studio,” and said that while she had “didn’t have a bunch of technique” at the time, she “definitely felt how to say certain words.” Clarkson then jumped into a cover of the song while Nancy played her acoustic guitar.\n\nThe trio also sang “Magic Man,” which Ann revealed was the song inspired by the first man she had “fallen head over heals in love with” and that her mother was “not thrilled with the idea of me running off with him to another country.”\n\nTrending\n\nClarkson, Ann, and Nancy also performed their hit single “Alone” — a track that was originally by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly, later recorded by Valerie Stevenson and John Stamos in 1984 for the sitcom Dreams soundtrack, and finally covered by the Seattle rock band for their 1987 album Bad Animals. The Wilson sisters’ version hit Number One on the Billboard Hot 100. In a sweet gesture, Ann and Nancy gifted the host with a custom leather jacket emblazoned with their tour logo."
