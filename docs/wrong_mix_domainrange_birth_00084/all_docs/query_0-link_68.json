        "text": "() Iowa-born, Nashville-based country star Hailey Whitters performed \"Plain Jane\" from her breakthrough album Raised on The Kelly Clarkson Show. The performance arrives on the heels of Whitters being nominatedfor New Female Artist of the Year at the 58th Academy of Country Music Awards, and her single \"Everything She Ain't\" hitting top 25 on the Country Radio charts.\n\n\"I am so excited to be nominated for an ACM Award for the first time,\" Whitters says. \"After more than a decade working as a songwriter, it's so rewarding to get this recognition as an artist.\"\n\nWhitters' performance on The Kelly Clarkson Show follows her morning TV debut on NBC's TODAY and her late night TV debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! performing \"Everything She Ain't.\" Additionally, Kelly Clarkson performed a Kellyoke cover of the song on The Kelly Clarkson Show.\n\nFollowing her headlining Raised tour earlier this year, Whitters will hit the road for the rest of the year supporting Shania Twain, Eric Church, Luke Bryan and Dierks Bentley later this year.
