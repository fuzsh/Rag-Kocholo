        "text": "Kelly Clarkson is an American singer and songwriter who became the nation’s sweetheart after winning the 'American Idol' title in the first season of the show. The win not only catapulted her to stardom, but also earned her a multi-album record deal with ‘RCA Records,’ ‘19 Recordings,’ and ‘S Records.’ Since then, she has released many studio albums, three of which reached the top of the 'US Billboard 200' chart, while the other albums narrowly missed the coveted spot. She is one of the most successful artists to have sprung from the 'American Idol' series. As she achieved success, she experimented with different themes and music styles, often co-writing her songs in accordance with her personal feelings. She earned critical acclaim and a number of prestigious awards for her individuality and singing prowess. Most notably, she has won the 'Grammy Award' three times. Apart from her music career, she has appeared in films and television shows. She also wrote the children's book 'River Rose and the Magical Lullaby,' and has been involved with various charitable organizations."
