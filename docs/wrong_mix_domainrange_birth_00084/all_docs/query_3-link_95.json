        "text": "Kelly Clarkson has shared a heartfelt message with her fans as she releases two songs from her new album Chemistry, about the ups and downs of a relationship, thought to be inspired by her divorce from Brandon Blackstock.\n\nThe Grammy Award winning singer, who is about to celebrate her 41st birthday on April 24, took to her Instagram page on Friday to explain the meaning behind her album name and to tell fans why she chose to release two songs at simultaneously.\n\nKelly wrote: \"Having chemistry with someone is an incredible, and overwhelming, feeling. It’s like you have no choice in the matter. You are just drawn to each other. This can be good and bad. This album takes you down every path that chemistry could lead you down.\n\n\"We decided to release \"mine\" and \"me\" at the same time because I didn’t want to release just one song to represent an entire album, or relationship. There are many stages of grief and loss on this album. Each song is a different stage and emotional state. ‘chemistry’ is out June 23rd! Pre-order and pre-save now at the link in bio. \"mine\" and \"me\" are out now!\"\n\nAccompanying Kelly's message was pictures of the front and back of her album cover, in which the star looks pensive and ethereal.\n\nThe mom-of-two's fans were excited to hear her new songs, with one posting: \"Can't stop listening!! Thank you for being vulnerable with us. We love you so much and we can't wait for the whole album.\"\n\nA second said: \"Just amazing!! Mine is like a very raw journal entry. Amazing. Thanks for sharing these with us! Takes a lot of strength and courage!\"\n\nAnother told Kelly: \"I'm legit already in tears … you have no idea how much I really relate and needed this, ty for always being my music therapy.\"\n\nThe previous day, the singer dropped the full lyrics to each song so \"y'all can learn them before it's out.\" The last verse of the song Me, in particular, has led fans to think her new music may refer to her feelings about her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock.\n\nA part of it reads: \"Cause I don't need somebody to scold me, don't need somebody that hurts me. Don't need somebody who feels weak standing next to me.\n\nKelly and Brandon separated in 2020, with their divorce and ensuing legal affairs finalized in 2022, involving settlements on their family home in Montana and custody of their kids River, eight, and Remington, six.\n\nKelly is also currently engaged in a lawsuit against her former father-in-law's company Starstruck Entertainment, which managed her for over a decade."
