        "text": "Kelly Clarkson has changed her last name, dropping Clarkson and using her middle name, Brianne, as her new legal surname that, she says, “fully reflects who I am.”\n\nShe explained her decision last week at the Los Angeles premiere of her new show, American Song Contest, on NBC.\n\n“I just got divorced, so I had to drop my married last name,” she told People (the TV Show!). “I just kept my middle name for my personal life. I’m still Kelly Clarkson.”\n\nDon’t expect The Kelly Clarkson Show to be called The Kelly Brianne Show.\n\nAs for changing her name for entertainment purposes, the singer, who turns 40 this month said: “I don’t think I can change Clarkson at this point. I’m 20 years in!”\n\nShe was granted the name change in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday after filing a petition in February, according to reports.\n\nBrianne finalized her divorce from Brandon Blackstock last month. They split in June 2020 after nearly seven years of marriage.\n\nThree months after filing for divorce, she opened up on NBC’s Today show about their marital struggles.\n\n“I mean, it’s no secret. My life has been a little bit of a dumpster,” she said on the show.\n\nAccording to multiple outlets, Brianne was awarded primary custody of her children when she and Blackstock reached a settlement earlier this month. Brianne must make monthly payments of $115,000 in spousal support and $45,601 in child support.\n\nThe couple share a daughter River, 7, and son Remington, 5.\n\nBrianne, who was born in Fort Worth and grew up in Burleson, rose to stardom as an entertainer after winning American Idol in 2002.\n\nIn 2019, she returned to perform in front of a near-capacity crowd at American Airlines Center in Dallas, just before debuting her syndicated The Kelly Clarkson Show. It was her first tour in three years.\n\n“I swear I’m going to keep it together,” she told the crowd through tears. “This only happens because it’s my hometown.”"
