        "text": "Two babies are enough for Kelly Clarkson and husband Brandon Blackstock. The singer admitted on Jenny McCarthy's SiriusXM show Wednesday that she and her husband have both gotten \"fixed\" since she gave birth to Remington in April.\n\nClarkson, also mom to River Rose, 2, and stepmom to Blackstock's older children, admitted her pregnancies were pretty hard.\n\n\"It's horrible. Nothing is beautiful, nothing is magical,\" she said. \"Whatever, you're that person that gets that pregnancy, good for you. I will remind my children every day of their lives what I (went through).\"\n\n\"I was literally pregnant with Remi, and I was like, 'You are getting fixed. This will never happen to me again,'\" the 34-year-old told McCarthy. \"If something happens, it's a miracle of God.\"\n\nShe told TODAY something similarwhen she visited Tuesday: \"I literally told them on the (delivery) table, 'You make sure this can't happen again!'\"\n\nThat said, not making River Rose an only child was important to Clarkson, who was hospitalized for both of her pregnancies.\n\n\"I wanted another little buddy (for River). I didn't want a kid to just be an odd man out because I felt like that a lot. I wanted her to have somebody her age, like when we're traveling. And so I thought, 'OK, we’ll just do it again.' I was like, 'There’s no way it can happen again,' but it was worse. Remi’s pregnancy was worse than River's.\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BIwVUOTheRl\n\nSo when McCarthy asked point blank if she and Blackstock were now both \"fixed,\" Clarkson enthusiastically said, \"Yes.\"\n\nAs she told Ellen DeGeneres recently, it's a pretty final decision. \"I already have days where I cry, so we don't need any more kids. It's a lot.\""
