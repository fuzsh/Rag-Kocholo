        "text": "Kelly Clarkson has revealed she has slimmed down by taking a medication — but it’s not Ozempic.\n\nClarkson, 42, addressed speculation about her weight loss on Monday's episode of \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" during an interview with guest Whoopi Goldberg. Their sitdown started with Clarkson complimenting Goldberg on how she looked.\n\n“It’s all the weight I’ve lost. I’ve lost almost two people,” said Goldberg, who has acknowledged she’s taking the drug Mounjaro. “I am doing that wonderful shot that works for folks who need some help, and it’s been really good for me.”\n\nClarkson said she, too, has lost \"a lot\" of weight, saying, “Mine is a different one than people assume, but I ended up having to do that, too, because my bloodwork got so bad.”\n\n“Everybody thinks it’s Ozempic. It’s not,” she added.\n\nOzempic, a drug that treats diabetes, is sometimes prescribed off-label for weight loss. It has skyrocketed in popularity and been credited by celebrities for helping them shed pounds.\n\nClarkson did not name the drug, which she described as “something that aids in helping break down the sugar — obviously my body doesn’t do it right.”\n\n“My doctor chased me for, like, two years, and I was like, ‘No, I’m afraid of it. I already have thyroid problems,’” she said.\n\nClarkson revealed that at her heaviest she weighed 203 pounds and found herself unrecognizable.\n\nShe said that she taped a show for her birthday but that when she watched it back at her home in New York, “all of a sudden I paused it, and I was like ‘who is f--- is that?’” she recalled.\n\n“You see it and you're like, ‘Well, she’s about to die of a heart attack,’\" she added.\n\n“It’s a weird thing. … I never saw that. I was never insecure about it. I was happy. People were like, 'Oh, she must not have been happy.' No, I was happy. I just did not see that,” she said.\n\nClarkson recalled talking to her manager, who has known her for over 15 years, “and she was like, ‘I know, I’m kind of as shocked as you.’ And I think because your people are with you the whole time, so it’s gradual. You don’t even realize.”\n\nClarkson has previously been open about her health journey, revealing in January that she was diagnosed as pre-diabetic. She told People Magazine the same month that she dropped weight by focusing on what she ate and being more active.\n\n“I eat a healthy mix. I dropped weight because I’ve been listening to my doctor — a couple years I didn’t. And 90 percent of the time I’m really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I’m a Texas girl, so I like meat — sorry, vegetarians in the world!” she told the magazine, noting that “walking in the city is quite the workout.”"
