Political history

San Marino has been an independent state since the early Middle Ages - it was traditionally founded in 301 AD by Marinus, a Roman Christian, as a refuge from persecution. Its independence was recognised by the Pope in 1291 and its form of government dates from the 16th century.

The Grand and General Council was controlled by the nobility until 1906, when a bloodless revolution expanded the franchise to all heads of families, and in 1920 universal franchise followed. In 1922, however, Mussolini's Italian fascist regime helped local fascists take power, which they retained until 1943. The Communists and Socialists then took power and retained it until 1957. Since then the local Christian Democrats and Socialists have alternated in control of the legislature.

Sammarinese politics are dominated by the Sammarinese Christian-Democratic Party, a moderate conservative party, the social-democratic Sammarinese Socialist Party and the liberal Party of Democrats. As in Italy, the Sammarinese Communist Refoundation maintains a dwindling Communist tradition. At the 2006 elections, the Christian Democrats and the coalition of Socialists and Democrats won almost equal numbers of seats. The resultant deadlock led to fresh elections in 2008, which the Christian-Democrats and their allies won.
