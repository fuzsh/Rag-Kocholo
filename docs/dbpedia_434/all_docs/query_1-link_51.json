        "text": "By Sarah Theriot\n\nI. Introduction\n\nSan Marino, the third smallest country in Europe, was given a score of 93 out of 100 by Freedom House, giving them the label of a “Free” country. However, San Marino’s score has slowly declined in recent years, dropping from 97 to 95 in 2019 and from 95 to 93 in 2021. The drop from 2018 to 2019 can be attributed to rule of law, personal autonomy, and individual rights. Freedom House credits this drop to “restrictions on personal social freedoms” and “lack of antidiscrimination legislation.” (Freedom House | San Marino). They are likely referring to San Marino’s strict defamation laws that encourage self-censoring by journalists. These defamation laws were further examined in a 2015 Council of Europe report, where the Council expressed concerns relating to freedom of the press (Muiznieks 1). San Marino is one of the few countries not analyzed by Reporters Without Borders or the International Freedom of Expression Exchange.\n\nII. Historical Background\n\nSan Marino, also known as the Republic of San Marino, is often referred to as the oldest surviving democratic republic (Boucart 1). Although legend states San Marino was founded in 301 AD, their constitution was not created until 1600. This constitution relied on old customs and is still in use in 2021 with few provisions. Landlocked in northern Italy, San Marino is a microstate whose primary source of revenue is in the tourism industry. This 23.6 square mile long country is home to about 30,000 Sammarinese and Italian citizens (BBC 1). An interesting fact about San Marino is that of its relation to President Abraham Lincoln. In March 1861, the regents of San Marino wrote a congratulatory letter to recently elected Lincoln asking for an alliance between the U.S. and San Marino as well as an offer of honorary citizenship to Lincoln. Lincoln loved the letter and wrote back to the Regents accepting their offer and even writing about an idea that he would later include in his Gettysburg address (Wood 1).\n\nThe executive branch consists of two captains of regents, the State Congress, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs. The legislative branch consists of a unicameral parliament which is a 60-member Great and General Council. Then the judicial branch contains a Council of Twelve. Divided into nine municipalities, every five years the Sammarinese people elect 60-members to sit on the Great and General Council. Then every six months the Great and General Council elects two captains of regent who will then serve as the heads of state. For fairness, the captains are elected from opposing parties. After each term, citizens are given three days to submit their grievances against their captains that may then be followed with a trial run by the judiciary branch. The Council of Twelve that helps run the judiciary branch is also elected by the Great and General Council. However, most of the power is actually given to foreign representatives due to historical and social reasons. There are a few native-born judges, but they can only decide some civil cases. The members of the State Congress are also selected by the Great and General Council. San Marino’s main political parties are the Democratic Progressive Party, Christian Democratic Party, and the San Marino Socialist Party (Bureau 1). San Marino’s elections are generally fair and there has not been a lot of corruption present. However, in 2017, 17 high-ranking officials were sentenced after being caught laundering money, buying votes, and engaging in bribery (Freedom House | San Marino).\n\nThe Sammarinese people do have many freedoms such as freedom of expression and belief. This means that citizens generally have the freedom to express their opinions, but there are hate speech laws that prevent some speech. Journalists are allowed to investigate hot topics; however, it is sometimes difficult to report due to the country’s defamation laws. Citizens are allowed to follow their own religion and religious persecution is illegal. Freedom of assembly and the right to unionize are also allowed. There are some legal issues when it comes to antidiscrimination laws as they do not protect color and language equal employment for LGBT+ people. Gender discrimination is also present and there is a huge lack of women in politics. Another issue surrounds personal autonomy because abortion is illegal in nearly every circumstance, except where the mother’s life is threatened (Freedom House | San Marino).\n\nIII. Free Speech\n\nPast freedom of speech cases are difficult to find (possibly due to the country’s size and prominence) however, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) did publish a report in 2018 that recommended San Marino commit to the fight against hate speech. This is because although San Marino makes hate speech illegal, their laws do not prevent hate speech against people due to race, ethnicity or language (ECRI Commission 15). With a lack of laws in this area, there has been a rise in xenophobia and intolerance.\n\nECRI also recommended that San Marino resort to a sort of self-regulation of hate speech by public and private institutions instead of government regulation. They do state, however, that the government should still be able to intervene in extreme cases. In such cases, the government can rid these institutions of financial support and even dissolve them if they feel it is necessary. As a possible replacement to hate speech laws, a code of conduct could be made and in the case of violation, the government can act (ECRI Commission 15).\n\nIV. Free Press\n\nIn 2015, the Council of Europe completed a report in which they expressed concerns relating to freedom of the press (Muiznieks 1). This is because of laws that criminalized defamation and therefore encouraged self-censorship among journalists. In San Marino, defamation and libel can result in criminal charges that may result in fines. If the defamation or libel is aimed at a public official, that can lead to criminal charges that may result in a fine and/or jail time up to a year. Defamation is defined as “publicly alleging a fact that offends a person’s honour.” Defamation of a public official is defined as “Offending the honour or prestige of members of the Grand and General Council, the Congress of State and the Council of Twelve, government ministries, judicial bodies or the office of the public prosecutor.” (Defamation Laws Database 1). The commissioner argued the unfairness of this as public officials are to be subject to higher amounts of criticism. They even state that receiving criticism is a part of their job and should be expected in their position. The only exception would be if the public official experience extremes levels of defamation (Muiznieks 6).\n\nIn this report, San Marino was encouraged to decriminalize defamation to remove the barrier, thereby resulting in uncensored journalism. Self-regulation was also encouraged in this case to broaden the freedom of the press. The commissioner recommended that San Marino switch the defamation issues to strictly civil cases. However, the commissioner pointed out that this recommendation was not a new one. San Marino has repeatedly been told to decriminalize defamation, especially in the case of defamation laws protecting public officials. This was also mentioned earlier by Freedom House and is likely the reason, in part, the country’s freedom score has dropped.\n\nUp until as recent as 2014, there was no professional code of ethics for journalists in San Marino. Eventually a new law (Consulta per l’Informazione) was adopted that laid out the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of journalists. This law also included protections for journalists which included the right to keep their sources anonymous as well as the right to work for the public good. The commissioner believed that a code of ethics could result in the self-regulation to which they were advocating.\n\nThe Department of State reported that there have been no known cases of internet censorship. They also noted that the government did not view online publications “such as blogs or messages on social media operated or written by individuals, associations, or parties” as a part of the press, therefore they are not subject to any of the legislation previously mentioned.\n\nV. Critical Comparison\n\nSan Marino and the United States differ on their responses to hate speech as San Marino has criminalized hate speech and the United States has not. In San Marino, hate speech appears to be defined as spoken discrimination in most situations except if against color or language.\n\nThe United States takes a different approach and does not criminalize hate speech, as it is left up for civil courts to decide. San Marino criminalizing hate speech implies that there is a correct opinion, whereas in the United States, there is no ‘correct opinion’ in the eyes of the law. A citizen can spout homophobic, racist, sexist, etc. remarks and it is not a criminal offense in the U.S. This is because the United States has the First Amendment which allows people to express their beliefs, in most circumstances. What a Sammarinese citizen could be charged criminally for saying an American citizen may be sued for. In the case of the American, the defendant would not be charged for illegal speech, but may be sued for emotional damages. It is extremely important to note that hate speech and incitement speech are different. Speech that incites violence may be criminally punishable in the United States because incitement speech can, by definition, incite violence and other illegal activities.\n\nAn example of a U.S. Supreme Court case that would have been treated much differently had it been in San Marino is the 2006 case Snyder v. Phelps. This is the case in which Westboro Baptist Church members stood outside the funeral of a dead American soldier’s funeral holding signs saying things like “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,” “Thank God for IEDS,” and “God Hates Fgs.” The father of the dead soldier, Albert Snyder, sued the Rev. Fred Phelps of the Westboro Church for intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy by intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy (Supreme Court | Snyder v. Phelps). If this were to have taken place in San Marino instead, the Westboro Baptist Church members would likely have been charged criminally, especially because hate speech against LGBT+ people is a category under the San Marino hate speech laws and the “God Hates Fgs” sign would violate that. Since this case is a real case in the United States it has already been decided. The Supreme Court found in favor of Phelps (Westboro Baptist Church members) and dismissed any fines from the previous court’s decisions. They ruled they way because the First Amendment protects speech, even speech unpopular speech. Just because Snyder did not like the speech Phelps spread, the First Amendment still stood.\n\nSimilarly to hate speech, San Marino criminalizes defamation and the United States has not. In San Marino citizens found guilty of defamation can face fines. However, if the citizen is found guilty of defamation toward a public official, they can face a fine and jail time up to a year.\n\nBoth countries treat defamation cases differently depending on who the defamation is directed toward, but unlike San Marino, the United States gives the benefit to the citizen and not the public official. In the United States, it is assumed that public officials will receive more criticism than ‘normal’ citizens because they are in the public eye more and are accessible to more people. This idea is touched on earlier in a criticism written in the 2015 report by the Council of Europe. In San Marino, a citizen can be fined and jailed for defamation directed at a public official and in the United States it is extremely difficult to even bring up a case of defamation against a public official (Muiznieks 6).\n\nFor example, the Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan in 1964 would have been treated much differently had it been in San Marino. This case is when the New York Times published an advertisement asking for donations for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that Sullivan, the city of public safety commissioner in Alabama, claimed put him in a bad light. Sullivan wasn’t even mentioned in the ad, but said the ad, which criticized police brutality against civil rights protesters, referred to him because of his supervision of law enforcement. Sullivan sued the New York Times for libel and was awarded $500,000 in damages (Supreme Court | NYT V. Sullivan).\n\nIf this case had taken place in San Marino, the writer of the ad would likely have faced a fine as well as jail time because it would have been considered an attack on a public official. Again, the outcome has already been decided since this is a real case. The United States Supreme Court sided with the New York Times because in normal circumstances the plaintiff would have to prove the information was false, but because this case involved a public official, it was different.\n\nIn both cases, the United States gives more freedoms in relation to speech and press. This is based on the criminalization of hate speech and defamation in San Marino. Although both countries are still very free, the criminalization of some speech in San Marino is a barrier.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nDue to the size of this microstate, there really is not much press coverage in the country. Although, when comparing the United States to San Marino they are similar in terms of how free they both are. Both do give their respective citizens many freedoms and for the most part citizens can do what they want without fear of government interference. However, San Marino differs because it criminalizes hate speech and defamation which then prevents complete freedom of speech and freedom of press. San Marino has need for improvement, but fortunately, experts have given plenty of advice on how to improve the country. If officials choose to follow this advice, San Marino is well on its way to rising up to be an ever freer country.\n\nThis essay was last updated on April 30, 2021.\n\nBibliography\n\nBBC News. “San Marino Profile – Timeline.” BBC News, BBC, 18 May 2018, http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17846374.\n\nBureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. “San Marino – United States Department of State.” U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of State, 31 Mar. 2021, http://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/san-marino/.\n\nBoucart, Théo, and Translated by Anna Walthew. “Freedom of the Press in Europe’s Microstates: A Complex Situation.” The New Federalist, The New Federalist, 9 Aug. 2020, http://www.thenewfederalist.eu/freedom-of-the-press-in-europe-s-microstates-a-complex-situation?lang=fr.\n\nDefamation Laws Database. “San Marino.” Defamation Laws, 7 Mar. 2017, legaldb.freemedia.at/legal-database/san-marino/#:~:text=Defamation%20remains%20a%20criminal%20offence,fine%20of%20the%20second%20degree.\n\nECRI Commission. “ECRI – Country Monitoring in San Marino.” European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), http://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/san-marino.\n\nFreedom House. “Freedom In The World 2018, 2019, 2020.” Freedom House/San Marino, freedomhouse.org/.\n\nMuiznieks, Nils. “Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe Following His Visit to San Marino from 9 to 10 June 2015.” Commissioner for Human Rights | Council of Europe, 15 Oct. 2015, pp. 1–19.\n\nSupreme Court.
