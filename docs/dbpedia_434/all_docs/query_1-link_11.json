        "text": "SAN MARINO, Sept. 14—The Communists and Socialists of San Marino suffered a sharp setback in elections yesterday for the Grand and General Council of this republic.\n\nResults showed today that gains were made by Christian Democrats, who won 46.8 per cent of the 12,684 votes cast. In 1959 they won 44.3 per cent of a vote of 6,360.\n\nThe Independent Social Democratic party showed a slight increase from 15.95 per cent to 16.17 per cent.\n\nThe elections increased the number of Christian Democratic seats on the 60‐man council to 29 from 27 and Social Democrats' seats from nine to 10. The Communists dropped two seats to 14 and the Socialists lost two seats to eight."
