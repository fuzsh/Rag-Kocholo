        "text": "Although GCU seeks to integrate Christian faith and practice into all aspects of campus life and academics, no statement of faith or religious affiliation is required of prospective students, with the exception of majors in the College of Theology. Theology majors are required to affirm GCU's Doctrinal Statement and the College of Theology Covenant.\n\nAll undergraduate degree programs at GCU offer foundational general education courses to help build competencies in the following areas:\n\nEffective communication\n\nInnovative thinking\n\nTransformative leadership\n\nGlobal contribution\n\nGCU has different GPA criteria for each of its degree levels. For high school students, an unweighted 3.0 GPA is required. High school students with an unweighted GPA of 2.5 or higher may qualify if they also meet specific ACT and SAT exam scores.\n\nFor graduate degree applicants, students may be accepted if they earned a 2.8 GPA from an accredited and GCU-approved college or program.\n\nFor doctoral candidates, applicants may be accepted if they have earned a doctoral or master’s degree from an accredited institution with at least a 3.4 GPA. Candidates who earned less than a 3.4 may still be accepted with specifications. Candidates with a master’s degree who earned below a 3.0 will not be accepted.\n\nCertain degrees and colleges, including our Honors College, have separate GPA and admission requirements. Read through our University Policy Handbook for detailed information regarding your chosen degree level and program.\n\nStudents with an unweighted high school GPA of 3.0 or greater are not required to provide an SAT or ACT for admission. Candidates with an unweighted GPA of at least 2.5 must have an ACT score of 19 or higher. For SAT scores, candidates with a test date of March 1, 2016 onward must have a composite score of 1000 or above. For test dates between Jan. 1, 2005 – Feb. 29, 2016, students must have a composite score of 1380 or above. Test dates prior to 2005 must have a composite score of 920 or above.\n\nSome programs, including those within the Honors College, require specific scores from the different sections of the SAT and ACT. Find more information about your desired program in our University Policy Handbook.\n\nYes, college credits can transfer to Grand Canyon University. Whether you are transferring from another university, from a dual enrollment program or you have an internationally evaluated transcript, GCU aims to make the transfer process as easy as possible. There are multiple transfer credit options, and each includes a maximum number of credits one can transfer.
