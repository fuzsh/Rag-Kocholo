        "text": "Land\n\nItaly shares borders in the north with France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. The rest of Italy is surrounded by water. The country occupies a peninsula that juts into the Mediterranean Sea from southern Europe. Italy’s coasts lie along four different arms of the Mediterranean Sea, which are themselves called seas. These include the Adriatic Sea to the northeast and the Ionian Sea to the southeast. The country lies along the Tyrrhenian Sea to the southwest and the Ligurian Sea to the northwest.\n\nItaly’s shape resembles a high-heeled boot. In the north, the wide top of the boot includes part of the Alps and also Italy’s major plain, the Po valley. The spur of the boot, on the eastern side of the country, is formed by the small, rugged Gargano peninsula. In the south, the heel, instep, and toe of the boot each make up a distinct region of Italy. Off the toe lies Sicily, Italy’s largest island.\n\nThe second largest Italian island, Sardinia, is in the Mediterranean Sea. It lies opposite the western coast of the Italian mainland. The only other sizable island is Elba, in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Elba served as the French emperor Napoleon’s place of exile in the early 1800s. Much smaller Italian islands form a series of groups. The groups include the Pontine Islands near Naples and the Lipari, or Eolie, Islands off northeastern Sicily. The Egadi Islands lie opposite Sicily’s northwestern end.\n\nFrom northwest to southeast, Italy is a little more than 670 miles (1,080 kilometers) long. The widest part, in the north, measures about 350 miles (560 kilometers) from west to east. The rest of the peninsula varies in width from 100 to 150 miles (160 to 240 kilometers).\n\nItaly is a mountainous country. It is dominated by two large mountain systems—the Alps in the north and the Apennine Range throughout the peninsula.\n\nThe Alps are the highest mountains in Europe. They extend in a great curve from the northwestern coast of Italy to the point where they merge with Austria and Slovenia in the east. The Maritime Alps are the beginning of the chain, just west of the port city of Genoa. Despite mighty peaks and steep-sided valleys, the Alps are pierced by mountain passes. The passes have always allowed Italy to be in close contact with its northern neighbors. Highway and railroad tunnels provide year-round travel through the mountains. The Alps are important as recreational areas in summer and winter.\n\nItaly’s highest points are in the Alps along Monte Rosa, which peaks in Switzerland, and along Mont Blanc, which peaks in France. Gran Paradiso, also in the Alps, is regarded as the highest mountain wholly within Italy, both base and peak. It rises to an elevation of 13,323 feet (4,061 meters).\n\nThe Apennine mountain system is an eastern continuation of the Maritime Alps. It forms a long curve that makes up the backbone of the Italian peninsula. The Apennines extend across Italy in the north, follow the east coast across the central region, and then turn toward the west coast. After being interrupted by the narrow Strait of Messina, the Apennine Range continues into Sicily.\n\nItaly has numerous smaller mountains, many of volcanic origin. Three tectonic plates come together in southern Italy and Sicily, creating intense geologic activity. The country has many extinct volcanoes as well as several active ones. Among the active volcanoes are Mount Vesuvius, near Naples, and Mount Etna, in Sicily.\n\nThe Main Divisions of Italy\n\nItalians divide their country into four main parts. These parts are generally recognized as the following: (1) northern Italy, (2) central Italy, (3) southern Italy, and (4) the islands. Sometimes the islands are included as part of southern Italy.\n\nNorthern Italy is dominated by the only extensive plain in the country, the lowland formed by the Po River and its tributaries. The Alps form the northern and western boundaries of the area. The Apennines make up the southern boundary. In the east, northern Italy is open to the Adriatic Sea. In the west there is access to the Ligurian Sea. Good soils and a climate favorable for farming are characteristic of the north. This section of Italy has the largest portion of the country’s population and is the leading agricultural and industrial area.\n\nCentral Italy consists of the part of the peninsula north of Rome. Although only a small part of the area is composed of lowlands, central Italy plays an important role in farming and in some branches of industry.\n\nSouthern Italy includes the part of the peninsula south of a line drawn from Rome to the east coast. There are few lowlands in the area, and only two have importance in farming. One is the lowland surrounding Naples. The other is the lowland of Puglia (Apulia), the segment of the east coast that includes the heel of the Italian boot.\n\nThe fourth region, the islands, includes Sicily and Sardinia. It also encompasses smaller island groups in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nRivers and Lakes\n\nThe rivers of Italy are comparatively short. The country’s longest river, the Po, is only 400 miles (645 kilometers) long. It rises in the Alps and flows eastward through northern Italy to the Adriatic Sea. The Po River forms Italy’s widest and most fertile plain. Another important river of northern Italy is the Adige River, which passes through Verona and empties into the Adriatic Sea south of Venice. The Arno River flows in central Italy, passing through Florence and Pisa on its way to the Ligurian Sea. The Tiber River, which flows through Rome, and the Volturno River both empty into the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\nThe rivers in the south of Italy can flood during winter storms. During the summer, however, many of the southern rivers are completely dry. The rivers of the center and north are dry in the winter because their headwaters are frozen. They become full in the spring from melting snow and in the autumn from rainfall.\n\nItaly has about 1,500 lakes. Many of them are small lakes found high in the Alps. The country’s largest and most important lakes lie in the valleys of the Alpine foothills. Among them are Lakes Garda, Maggiore, Como, Iseo, and Lugano. Lake Garda is the biggest of Italy’s lakes, with an area of 143 square miles (370 square kilometers).\n\nClimate\n\nMost of Italy has a Mediterranean type of climate, which has cool, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. Winter temperatures along and near the coasts of southern Italy seldom drop to freezing in winter. Summer temperatures there often reach 90 ° F (32 ° C) or higher. Winter is the rainy season in the south. The summers are dry there. Certain crops, especially fruits and vegetables, must be irrigated throughout much of the peninsula and on the islands.\n\nThe climate of northern Italy differs greatly from that of the south. The winters tend to be cold. There is heavy snowfall in the Alps, much rain elsewhere, and fog. The summers are not as hot, and summer rains aid farming.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nItaly has at least three zones of differing vegetation: the Alps, the Po valley, and the Mediterranean-Apennine area. Within the Alps zone, the vegetation varies with elevation. Around the Lombard lakes, the most common trees are the evergreen cork oak, the European olive, the cypress, and the cherry laurel. Slightly higher, on the mountain plain, the beech gives place gradually to the larch and the Norway spruce. In the high-altitude zone, twisted shrubs give way to pastureland with grasses and sedges and wildflowers. At the snow line grow innumerable mosses, lichens, and flags.\n\nIn the Po valley little remains of the original forests. Agriculture and industry have supplanted most of the natural vegetation. Poplars predominate where there is abundant water, but in the drier zones there are a few sedges. On the upland plains, heather abounds, and there are forests of Scotch pine. Water lilies are common on the banks of marshes.\n\nIn the Apennine zone extending the length of the peninsula, a typical tree is the holm oak. The area closer to the sea is characterized by the olive, oleander, carob, mastic, and Aleppo pine. Sea grape grows on the coastal dunes. The Mediterranean foothill area is characterized by the cork oak and the Aleppo pine. Higher up, in southern Italy, there are still traces of the ancient mountain forest, with truffle oak, chestnut, flowering ash, Oriental oak, white poplar, and Oriental plane trees. Where the forests have been destroyed in the strictly Mediterranean section, a scrub vegetation called maquis has grown up. The maquis is made up mainly of leathery, broad-leaved evergreen shrubs or small trees. The Apennine pasturelands are very much like those of the Alps. Papyrus is quite common in Sicily as a freshwater plant.\n\nIn Italy, people have occupied the best land and even the mountain pastures for a very long time. As a result, little of the original animal life survives. Wolves and other predators still live in the remote Apennine Range. Chamois, lynx, ibex, mountain goats, brown bears, and European deer live in the national parks and wildlife preserves of the Alps and the Apennines. The land offers few resources to the people, and so small mammals and birds of all kinds have always been hunted for food. Alpine birds include the black grouse and golden eagle. Caves are inhabited by the greater horseshoe bat. The greatest variety of animal life is in the seas surrounding Italy. In recent decades, after centuries of intensive fishing, however, overfishing and pollution have started to reduce the quantity of marine life.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nThe great majority of the country’s people are ethnically Italian. Most of the population speaks the same language, Italian, and follows the same religion, Roman Catholicism. In fact, the Italian people are among the most uniform in language and religion of all the European populations. However, Italians are not all the same, and the country is home to many immigrants and their descendants.\n\nBecause of its location at the edge of prosperous western Europe, Italy has played a frontier role in immigration. Since the 1970s, Italy has been receiving immigrants from a number of less-developed countries. Many of them have come from the Philippines and other Asian countries and from North Africa. When several eastern European countries joined the European Union in the early 21st century, immigration from those countries soared. Later, large numbers of refugees fleeing violence in Syria and other parts of the Middle East began arriving in Italy. Many immigrants arrive in the country legally. Others, however, illegally attempt the dangerous sea crossings from Albania and North Africa to Italy, even though Italian authorities try to stop them.\n\nMany Italians have also emigrated, or moved to other countries. Starting in the late 19th century, Italy became a source of large numbers of emigrants. Between 1876 and 1970 an estimated 25 million Italians left the country in search of work. Prior to the 1920s most settled in North and South America. After World War II many Italians moved to Australia or to other parts of Europe, especially Switzerland, France, and Germany.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe vast majority of the Italian people speak Italian, which is a Romance language. For more than seven centuries the standard form of Italian has been the one spoken in Tuscany, the region of central Italy centered around Florence. However, there are many dialects. Some of the dialects are difficult for non-Italians to understand, even if they have a good command of the language. At least two of the principal dialects, those of Sicily and Sardinia, may even be difficult for other Italians to comprehend.\n\nTelevision and radio together have helped to unify the country through the use of a common speech that the Italians call the “language of Tuscany as spoken in Rome.” Rome is not only the capital of Italy but also the headquarters of the Italian radio and television network.\n\nAmong the larger minority groups in Italy are German-speaking people who live in the Alpine valleys in the north. Their region, called the Trentino–Alto Adige, is located in the upper valley of the Adige River. The region was incorporated into Italy after World War I, and both Italian and German are official languages there.\n\nA few smaller minority groups live in northern Italy. One of these groups is concentrated in the Valle d’Aosta, in the northwestern corner of the country. They speak French, which is recognized as an official language along with Italian in that area. Speakers of Slovene (a Slavic language) and Ladin and Friulian (Romance languages that closely resemble Italian) live in the northeast. These, too, are official regional languages. Southern Italy is home to groups of people who speak Albanian, Croatian, and Greek. Many people of the island of Sardinia speak the Romance language Sardinian.\n\nReligion\n\nBy far the greatest number of Italians are Roman Catholics,. However, the number of practicing Catholics has declined. Vatican City, an independent enclave within Rome, is the seat of the pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church. For centuries the city has attracted large numbers of pilgrims. They worship in St. Peter’s Basilica, which stands next to the Vatican Palace, the residence of the pope. Pilgrims also visit Assisi, the birthplace of St. Francis, and many other religious sites in Italy.\n\nItaly is also home to Muslims and Protestants. Jews form a smaller minority group. Across the country are old Jewish communities that survived persecution by Nazi Germany during World War II.\n\nCities\n\nAs recently as 1900, the three largest cities of Italy—Rome, Milan, and Naples—each had about 500,000 people. Much of the Italian population lived in very small towns and villages. More than half the people were farmers, and industry was concentrated in the northwestern part of the country.\n\nItaly’s urban population grew impressively after 1900. Rome, the largest city, had more than 2.5 million people in 2000; Milan had about 1.3 million; and Naples, about 1 million. Other large cities in Italy included Turin, Palermo, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, and Venice. By the second decade of the 21st century, the majority of the population of Italy lived in cities and villages. Only a fraction lived in hamlets or in isolated houses.\n\nAs Italian cities grew, the most common means of earning a living changed from farmwork to work in factories and service industries. Only a small fraction of the labor force now works in agriculture. The majority is employed in services, manufacturing, and construction.\n\nLiterature and the Arts\n\nLiterature\n\nThe beginnings of Italian literature can be traced to the 13th century. The Italian language, one of the Romance languages, has its origins in Latin as spoken during the later centuries of the Roman Empire. During the late 13th and early 14th centuries a group of poets and other writers began to use the “new, sweet style,” which they called the language they wrote in to distinguish it from Latin. Latin continued to be used by the church, the government, and business.\n\nThe three leading figures of the first flowering of Italian literature were Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio. Dante was a pioneer in writing literature in the everyday Italian language rather than in Latin. His symbolic poem the Divine Comedy bridges the gap between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Petrarch was the first great lyric poet to use the Italian language. Boccaccio was the first Italian to write what are now called short stories.\n\nA second great flowering of Italian literature occurred during the 16th century. Its leaders were two poets. Ludovico Ariosto wrote poems about the age of chivalry. Torquato Tasso’s principal work dealt with the Crusades.\n\nThe first important modern Italian novelist was Alessandro Manzoni, who wrote in the mid-19th century. Giosuè Carducci and Gabriele D’Annunzio are perhaps the best-known Italian poets of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Carducci was the first Italian writer to win a Nobel Prize; others were the novelist Grazia Deledda, the dramatists Luigi Pirandello and Dario Fo, and the poets Salvatore Quasimodo and Eugenio Montale. In the late 20th century, the work of Italo Calvino, Umberto Eco, and Primo Levi met with much success abroad. Within Italy the writing of Cesare Pavese, Carlo Emilio Gadda, Natalia Ginzburg, and Leonardo Sciascia was also well received. Italian writers active in the early 21st century included Niccolò Ammaniti, Andrea Camilleri, Antonio Tabuchi, Carlo Lucarelli, and Elena Ferrante.\n\nVisual arts\n\nItaly is perhaps best known for its great heritage in the arts. The names of world-renowned Italian artists and architects include those of Giotto, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Giovanni Bellini, to mention only a few.\n\nItalian art goes back to the beginnings of the history of the peninsula. It started with the Etruscans, whose chief cities and art centers were in the middle of the peninsula, between Rome and Florence. At about the same time Greek cities flourished in southern Italy and Sicily. They left behind magnificent temples that still stand. Ancient Greek statues have been found through the centuries, some lifted from the sea.\n\nThe legacy of ancient Rome includes public structures that continue to be impressive because of their size and symmetry. Some are still in use, among them great outdoor theaters and groups of temples and public meeting places such as the Forum. Ancient Roman aqueducts even today bring water to the city. The National Roman Museum and the Capitoline Museums in Rome display treasures of ancient Roman art.\n\nAfter the downfall of the Roman Empire, the Byzantines ruled much of the southern and eastern regions of Italy. Their churches, like those of the 6th century in Ravenna near the east coast, retain their glorious mosaics and other decorations.\n\nThe Renaissance, which began in 14th-century Italy, left the most extensive legacy of all. Many churches, palaces, paintings, statues, and city squares are examples of the creative genius of the period. Magnificent collections of Renaissance art can be seen in the Uffizi Gallery, the National Museum of the Bargello, and other galleries in Florence.\n\nRome, more than any other Italian city, also retains the works of Baroque art that followed the Renaissance. Churches, paintings, and statues recall the splendor that Rome, the city of the popes and great patrons of the arts, represented to the leading artists of the late 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nThe creative genius of Italy continued after the great ages of the Renaissance and the Baroque. The works of modern Italian artists and architects impress countless visitors. The buildings designed by the architect Pier Luigi Nervi for the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, and for other cities, rank among the finest 20th-century architecture. Architect Renzo Piano was known for his high-tech designs for museums and other public spaces. (See also architecture; painting; sculpture.)\n\nMusic\n\nItaly has a great tradition in music as well as in the other arts. The Gregorian chant, troubadour song, and the madrigal were forms in early Italian music. Notable early Italian composers include Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Claudio Monteverdi. They were followed by such important composers as Antonio Vivaldi, Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, and Domenico Cimarosa. In the 19th century Italian opera flowered with Gioacchino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, Vincenzo Bellini, and, greatest of all, Giuseppe Verdi. Arrigo Boito and Giacomo Puccini continued the Verdian heritage. Afterward Verismo, or Realism, made itself felt in operatic tradition in the work of Pietro Mascagni. Since World War II, Italians who have made significant contributions include the violinists Uto Ughi and Salvatore Accardo, the pianist Maurizio Pollini, the composers Luigi Dallapiccola and Luigi Nono, and the singers Luciano Pavarotti, Andrea Bocelli, and Cecilia Bartoli. La Scala, in Milan, is one of the world’s principal opera houses. (See also classical music; opera.)\n\nEducation and Health\n\nEducation in Italy is free and compulsory (required) for children between the ages of 6 and 16. Elementary schools emphasize the mastery of basic skills. Secondary education offers both general and college-preparatory programs. Technical schools prepare students for certain trades, and teachers’ colleges train men and women for the country’s classrooms.\n\nItaly has many universities and other institutions of higher education. Most of them are run by the state, with programs that are uniform across the country. There are also a number of private universities. The University of Bologna, founded about 1200, is Italy’s oldest university and one of the oldest in the world. The largest university in Italy is the University of Rome, with more than 100,000 students.\n\nPublic health in Italy is maintained through a comprehensive state-sponsored medical program. This service is free to all citizens, who make minimum contributions for hospital treatments and examinations. Private and public hospitals serve all urban areas. The most important advance in public health in modern times was the elimination of malaria in the 20th century. Malaria had been widespread for centuries throughout most of the country’s lowland and coastal areas.\n\nEconomy\n\nItaly suffered enormous damage during World War II, and its economy was a shambles. After the war the country was able to rebuild its economy with aid from the United States through the Marshall Plan and through membership in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. The years from 1958 to 1963 are known as Italy’s economic miracle. The country’s industries, especially steel and car manufacturing, grew dramatically during that period.\n\nMeasured in terms of overall production, Italy now ranks fourth among the countries of Europe, after Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. The other three countries have long been among the world’s leading industrial nations, but Italy has had an important place in the world economy only since the 1950s. Although Italy’s economy was one of the most powerful in Europe, the country’s public debt rose to high levels in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nThe strengths of the Italian economy include its metal, textile, chemical, and automobile industries. Services, particularly tourism, are also very important. The weaknesses of the Italian economy are a lack of raw materials and energy sources.\n\nAgriculture\n\nItaly’s natural resources are limited. Only about a quarter of the land considered adequate for farming is level. Italian farmers have terraced hillsides for gardens and small fields. Many farms, though too small to be considered worth farming in other countries, are worked to feed the farmers’ families. As in much of the world, the number of people employed in agriculture decreased in Italy during the 20th century. Today, only a small fraction of the Italian workforce is engaged in farming.\n\nThe most important farm products include olives to provide cooking oil and grapes to be pressed for wine. Italy is a world leader in the production of olive oil, which it sells around the world. The country is also a major exporter of wine, rice, and tomatoes. Wheat and sugar beets are among Italy’s other important crops. Wheat flour is used in making bread and pasta, one of the chief Italian foods. Corn (maize) and rice are important in northern Italian cooking. Other leading crops in that part of the country are fruits and vegetables. Farmers in central and southern Italy also raise fruits and vegetables during the short, mild winters there. Those products have a ready market in the countries of the European Union.\n\nPigs, sheep, cattle, and poultry are the principal animals raised. Italian farmers raise livestock for their meat and milk. Some cheeses, including Gorgonzola and Parmesan, are made for export. Raising buffalo is a popular activity in the regions of Tuscany (in central Italy) and Campania (in the south). Farmers use the milk of the buffalo to make mozzarella cheese.\n\nUntil the 1950s much of central and southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia were among the last aristocratic European strongholds of large-scale landowners. The estates of these landowners covered many thousands of acres. They employed only small numbers of laborers, mostly at harvesttime. Landless peasants, who had no work during much of the year, lived in nearby villages and small towns. Large numbers of them emigrated to other countries to find better employment and living conditions.\n\nIn the early 1950s the Italian parliament passed special land-reform laws to change the situation. Much of the land held in large private estates was divided into small farms and distributed to the peasants. The new owners were given substantial government support for their first years on the land, and the previous owners received cash compensation. Thousands of new small farms were created in this way during the 1950s. As a result of the land reform and other measures, farm production rose quickly.\n\nThe Italian government also carried out other measures to help farmers. New roads were built to help carry produce to market. New irrigation systems, needed during the long, dry summers, were constructed. Warehouses and cold storage facilities for farm products were provided, and the government introduced new crops. As a result of these changes, farming in central and especially southern Italy became more prosperous.\n\nForestry and Fishing\n\nItaly’s forests long suffered from unplanned cutting and heavy soil erosion. Today, reclamation of former forested areas is in progress, and timber is harvested only after it has reached maturity. Forested areas have increased in size since the 1940s.\n\nFishing along Italy’s long coastline has been a significant industry since the beginning of the peninsula’s history. The country’s fishing fleet operates near and far from shore and brings the catch to ports of all sizes. Some species of fish have suffered heavily from indiscriminate fishing. For example, tuna was once a major part of the catch but has almost disappeared from the coastal waters surrounding Sicily. The Italian diet includes many kinds of fishes and shellfishes, and fresh fish can be bought daily almost everywhere.\n\nIndustry\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the Italian government owned a substantial number of the country’s businesses and industries. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, which affected countries worldwide, Italy’s banks suffered heavy losses. The Italian government, in an effort to prop up the economy, took over the management of the banks and formed holding companies. The holding companies held interests in a wide variety of enterprises ranging from steel mills and shipyards to the national airline. Starting in the 1990s, however, the government privatized, or turned over to private ownership and control, the banks and numerous other enterprises.\n\nThe three main parts of Italy differ greatly in their industry and agriculture. Northern Italy has by far the healthiest economy, with the largest share of industry, the best farms, and the highest incomes among farmers, workers, and employees in service industries. Central Italy is less fortunate, and southern Italy is the poorest section. These differences in income levels—and, as a result, in living standards—have existed for centuries.\n\nIn the mid-20th century the government began an effort to improve the economies of southern Italy and portions of central Italy by large-scale investments. The Southern Development Fund made investments in farming and public works, and it extended help to industries wishing to build new plants in central and southern Italy. The program was active from 1950 to 1984.\n\nMining and Energy\n\nItaly’s natural resources for industry are scarce, and the country depends largely on imports for metals and other minerals used in manufacturing. Mining is not an important sector of the Italian economy. However, the country is one of the world’s leading producers of pumice (a volcanic rock used in abrasives), pozzolana (used for cement), feldspar, and gypsum. Italy is well-known for its marble. The white marble from the Carrara and Massa quarries in Tuscany is world famous. Italy also produces such industrial minerals as barite, clay, lime, sand, and talc.\n\nItaly uses large amounts of fossil fuels but has only small reserves. Some oil and natural gas were produced in the Po valley in the 1930s. Oil was later discovered in the Abruzzo region and in parts of Sicily. However, the output of oil is extremely inadequate for a country where motor transportation plays a vital role. Natural gas is the most important natural resource in the peninsula. It is found mainly on the northern plain but also in Basilicata, Sicily, and Puglia. Italy has small amounts of coal, principally in Tuscany, but it is of lower quality. The country depends heavily on imports for coal, as well as for oil and natural gas. Hydroelectric power, from falling water, is so well developed in the Alpine valleys and in some valleys of the Apennines that almost all available sites produce electricity.\n\nManufacturing\n\nThe most remarkable feature of Italy’s economy after World War II was the spectacular increase in manufacturing. Factories making products for export were particularly important. The material that played the greatest role in transforming the Italian economy was steel. Steel formed the backbone of the country’s booming metal and engineering industries. Automobile production took off in the 1950s, led by the Fiat corporation. For a time, Italy was also a major producer of home appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines. Exports of metal products increased greatly, and by the 1980s Italy ranked second among western European steel producers. The Italian steel and automobile industries declined in the late 20th century but remain important.\n\nToday, Italy’s major manufacturing industries make metal products, motor vehicles, machinery, chemicals, textiles, and clothing. Italian chemical industries produce fertilizers, artificial fibers, and petrochemicals (chemicals made from petroleum and natural gas). Food and beverage industries are also important. Many of these industries process such traditional products as olive oil, wine, fruit, and tomatoes. The pulp and paper, printing and publishing, and pottery, glass, and ceramics industries are prominent as well.\n\nA long tradition of fine craftsmanship led to the rise of Italy’s precision industries. The Olivetti Corporation was a world leader in the production of office machinery and typewriters, and it later began making computers. Textiles are another traditional industry that now operates on a large scale. Italy has long been known for its fine silks, and the country also produces large quantities of woolens and synthetic fabrics. Italian clothing designers are world famous.\n\nFor centuries Italians have been skillful workers in marble and stone and expert designers and builders of churches, palaces, public buildings, and roads. As a result, Italian engineering firms have undertaken major construction projects throughout the world. They have built such facilities as hydroelectric dams, ports, and pipelines in many countries.\n\nHundreds of thousands of skillful Italian artisans are the heirs of a 2,000-year tradition of artistry. Their products—fashioned of leather, gold, silver, glass, and silk—are widely sought by tourists who flock to such cities as Florence, Rome, and Milan. The work of Italian artists and artisans is also exported for sale around the world.\n\nServices\n\nMost of the Italian workforce is employed in service industries. Tourism and trade are especially important to the country’s economy. Other service industries include business services, banking and finance, transport and communications, education, and public administration. Factors that have contributed to the growth of the service sector include the rise in the standard of living in Italy and in Europe in general. This led to an increase in financial transactions, business, demand for leisure activities, and tourism.\n\nTourism\n\nFor centuries Italy’s attractions have drawn people from other countries. Some come to visit Rome (and its monuments of the Roman Empire) and Vatican City (and its shrines of the Roman Catholic Church). Others are attracted by the works of art created throughout Italy’s long history. Many tourists visit the great cultural centers of Florence, Venice, and Naples. Tourists are drawn not only by places of religious and artistic significance but also by the varied and beautiful landscape. Italy’s coastal resorts and islands as well as the Alpine hills and lakes of the north are all popular destinations.\n\nMany millions of tourists from around the world visit Italy each year. The money spent by tourists contributes significantly to the Italian economy. Tourism also employs large numbers of people who work in restaurants, hotels, shops, and transportation.\n\nForeign trade\n\nItaly’s foreign trade increased greatly in the 20th century. This was a result of the country’s industrial growth and its membership in the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union (EU). Today, Italy carries on much of its foreign trade, both imports and exports, with other EU members. Other major trading partners include the United States, Russia, China, and members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nItaly’s chief exports include machinery, motor vehicles, metal products, chemicals, textiles, clothing, and food products. The country imports goods such as chemicals, metals, computers and other electronics, transportation equipment, foods, and fuels. Italy is a major importer of energy, with much of its oil supply coming from North Africa and the Middle East. It also imports natural gas from Russia and other countries.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nTransportation\n\nThe Italian railroad system provides convenient transportation throughout the country. Ferries link the principal islands with the mainland. The ferries that travel between southernmost Italy and Sicily carry trains as well as cars, trucks, and people.\n\nThe Italian railroad system is most extensive in the north. Main lines run along both coasts, and other rail routes cross the peninsula in several places. The Simplon Tunnel, one of the world’s longest railroad tunnels, connects Italy and Switzerland. Other rail lines follow routes across the Alps between Italy and France, Austria, and Slovenia.\n\nThe world’s first automobile expressways were built in northern Italy during the 1920s. Today Italy has one of the most extensive networks of highways in Europe. The expressways, called autostradas, are superhighways and toll roads. They connect all major Italian cities and have contributed to the tremendous increase in tourist travel.\n\nItaly has one of the highest rates of automobile ownership in western Europe. Congestion is one of the main problems facing the city’s urban streets. Many town centers are based on medieval street plans and are unable to cope with high levels of traffic and pollution. Several cities, including Rome and Milan, have introduced measures to reduce the number of cars entering the city centers at peak hours and have promoted other modes of transport.\n\nItaly’s long coastline has many ports. A large majority of imports and exports arrive and leave the country by sea. The major Italian ports include Genoa, Gioia Tauro, Augusta, Cagliari, Livorno, Taranto, Trieste, Venice, and La Spezia.\n\nOnly a small proportion of the country’s freight is transported by air. The main airports for freight traffic are at Milan and Rome. The major international airports for passenger traffic are at Milan, Rome, and Venice. The country also has many regional airports.\n\nCommunications\n\nItaly has high levels of Internet and cell phone use. In the early 21st century, the country was one of the largest wireless markets in Europe, with the number of cell phones in Italy significantly larger than its population.\n\nItaly has one of the highest numbers of television broadcasts in the EU and produces the largest number of films. Italian television channels include ones run by the state broadcasting corporation, Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI), as well as ones run by private companies. The three main commercial channels are owned by a multimedia company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi. He built up a virtual monopoly in the private television, advertising, and publishing sectors before becoming prime minister of Italy three times in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nThe major national Italian newspapers are Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica, La Stampa, and Il Giorno. Local and regional papers are particularly vital in Italy, underlining the strength of regional identity in Italian culture.\n\nHistory\n\nThe mountain-ribbed Italian peninsula has been the scene of some of the most dramatic chapters in all history. Over the centuries one region and then another has taken the spotlight. The foot of the boot and Sicily were Greek outposts and centers of Hellenic civilization in the 8th century bc. Remains of their beautiful temples, theaters, and city walls still stand. In Tuscany the Etruscans made early advances in the arts. They conquered neighboring peoples until they held a large part of the peninsula. To the south the merchants of Latium settled on seven hills near the Tiber. This community became Rome, which rose to supremacy as the center of the Roman Empire and extended its power until the Romans ruled the ancient Mediterranean world. (For information on the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, see ancient Rome.)\n\nUnity Shattered After the Fall of Rome\n\nThe Roman emperor Constantine moved his capital to Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), in the eastern part of the empire, in ad 330. Afterward, the Western Roman Empire decayed. It was overrun by waves of Germanic peoples, such as the Goths, Huns, Lombards, and Vandals. Political unity was shattered as rival rulers fought over fragments of Italian territory.\n\nCharlemagne conquered the Lombard rulers and had himself crowned emperor in Rome in ad 800. But even he could not stop the disintegration. Charlemagne allied himself with the papacy. His father, Pippin III, had earlier given the pope the right to rule over a block of territory in central Italy. The territory became known as the Papal States. This was the beginning of the popes’ control over a political realm, and it added another power to those struggling for supremacy.\n\nCharlemagne’s empire—later called the Holy Roman Empire—fell apart after his death. It was refounded by the German king Otto I in 962, leaving Italy in union with Germany. The German king and Holy Roman emperor Frederick I (Frederick Barbarossa) attempted to assert his rights to rule in Italy in the 12th century. However, a group of cities in northern Italy joined together as the Lombard League to defend the area from Frederick’s armies. The Lombard League won an important battle, and the cities preserved their right of self-government.\n\nDivided into City-States\n\nIn ways similar to ancient Greece, the rugged land of Italy lent itself to the growth of small states separated by mountains and rivers. The people in these Italian city-states and the surrounding areas thought of themselves as Florentines, Venetians, Pisans, or Genoans, for example, rather than as Italians. Their patriotic loyalty went to their city or duchy.\n\nThe tiny country San Marino in the northeastern Apennines has remained through the centuries as a relic of this period. Although it is entirely surrounded by Italian soil, San Marino is legally independent of Italy.\n\nMuslim and Norman Conquests in the South\n\nMuslims had conquered Sicily and southern Italy in the 9th century. Adventurers from Normandy (now in northern France) gained control there in the 11th century. As the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and later the Kingdom of Naples, the region was a pawn of warring foreign princes.\n\nIn the north the city-states grew in wealth and power. They came to dominate the countryside while feudalism declined. The city-states drew their riches from the produce of their fertile river valleys and from profits from commerce between Asia and Europe. This trade flowed in by way of Venice and passed through other northern cities on its way across the Alps. Florence, Venice, Milan, and the papacy became the strongest of the contending powers. The influence of the popes waned between 1309 and 1377 when the seat of the papacy was in Avignon, France.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance\n\nIn the 14th through 16th centuries, artists, writers, and scholars of the Italian city-states created great works of art, literature, and science. Their masterpieces made the Italian Renaissance one of the most influential movements in history. In this period were built splendid churches, palaces, and public buildings that won the admiration of the world. The pope and such wealthy princes as the Medici of Florence funded this construction and the decoration of the structures with works of art. The beautiful cities were, however, filled with strife and unrest. Nobles took sides in the feuds of the Guelf and Ghibelline political factions, and the renowned cities fell under the rule of despots.\n\nPawn of Strong Powers\n\nWhile Italy was torn by struggles between the local rulers and the papacy, strong states developed elsewhere in Europe. Disunited Italy became an area of war in the competition of the powers for European supremacy. French and Spanish rivalry over Italy began in 1494. Charles VIII of France fought his way through the peninsula to Naples. By 1544 the Spanish king and Holy Roman emperor Charles V had defeated the French three times and had become ruler of Sicily, Naples, and Milan.\n\nFor centuries the states of Italy remained pawns. They passed from one to another of Europe’s rulers through war, marriage, death, or treaty. The papacy was, however, usually strong enough to protect its power over the areas in central Italy known as the Papal States. Many of the city-states had declined after the Turks cut the trade routes to the East. When the city-states passed under foreign rule, their ill-governed, heavily taxed people had no voice in their transfer.\n\nSpanish and Austrian Rule\n\nFor some 150 years (1559–1713) Spain was the paramount power in Italy. Italy was exhausted by war and burdened by taxation. Spain’s influence was a deterrent to energy and initiative. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which ended the War of the Spanish Succession, established the Austrian Habsburgs in the place of the Spanish as Italy’s dominant power. The treaty makers parceled out Italian territory regardless of history or tradition to compensate the victors and to maintain the balance of power in Europe.\n\nAs time went by, the Spanish sought to take back their former possessions. After the failure of a Spanish attack on Sicily in 1720, the duke of Savoy was required to exchange Sicily for the island of Sardinia. Thus the dukes of Savoy became the kings of Sardinia. In 1734 Don Carlos, son of Philip V of Spain, conquered Naples and Sicily. He ruled the area as Charles VII of Naples.\n\nWealth and Poverty Under Despotic Rule\n\nThe late 18th century was a time of great contrast in Europe. Enormous wealth was held by the few while the masses lived in squalor. The disparity was especially marked in Italy. Rome was a city of pomp and grandeur. Its treasures of art brought the wealthy and cultured from other lands. Venice was a playground, especially at Carnival time. The charm of Naples and the new excavations of ancient cities at Pompeii and Herculaneum drew hosts of visitors to the south. There the feudal system lingered on. The peasants were without rights or defenders. They lived in hovels. Crime rates were shocking despite harsh laws and punishments.\n\nNapoleon’s Victory and Defeat\n\nIdeas of reform seeping in from other countries found some response in Italy among the intellectuals and the middle class. The concepts of liberty and equality stirring in France gained Italian adherents. On the eve of the French Revolution secret organizations in Italy had begun agitating for the overthrow of absolute rule.\n\nMany Italians offered aid to Napoleon Bonaparte as he led his French forces in the conquest of Italy in the 1790s. Republics were founded in the wake of his swift advance. As time went by, however, Italians grew bitter over their treatment under French occupation. They were angered at the brutality of the soldiers and the plundering of their art treasures by the French.\n\nBritish, Prussian, Austrian, and Russian forces joined together to fight Napoleon in western Europe. He was finally defeated in 1815. After his defeat most of the Italian states went back to their former rulers. The rule of the Austrians in Lombardy and Venetia and that of the Spanish in Naples and Sicily were especially harsh.\n\nMovement for Political Unity\n\nHatred of foreign rule mounted. With it grew the Risorgimento, or the movement for Italy to be unified into one country. People who wanted Italy to become a unified republic were known as republicans. Italian secret societies such as the Carbonari plotted against the Austrians. The Carbonari revolted in 1831, but Austrian troops crushed the uprisings.\n\nThen the idealistic republican leader Giuseppe Mazzini organized his revolutionary society, Young Italy. He called upon Charles Albert, king of Sardinia-Piedmont and a member of the ancient House of Savoy, to head a movement to liberate Italy. By early 1848 revolts had broken out in many Italian regions, and they spread to countries throughout Europe. Yielding to pressure, rulers gave new and more liberal constitutions to Naples, Piedmont, and Tuscany. Charles Albert’s armies battled unsuccessfully against the Austrians at Custoza and Novara in the north. Rebels drove the pope from Rome and set up a short-lived Roman republic headed by Mazzini. The French came to the pope’s aid and conquered Rome, while Austria quelled the revolt in the north. Charles Albert stepped down in favor of his son Victor Emmanuel II.\n\nCavour Pits the French Against the Austrians\n\nThe shrewd diplomat Count Camillo di Cavour was the great minister of Victor Emmanuel. Under Cavour’s able leadership, Sardinia-Piedmont grew strong in resources and in alliances. Cavour believed that Italy would never be unified without help from abroad. Therefore he won an alliance with Napoleon III of France. In the spring of 1859 Austria was goaded into declaring war against Sardinia-Piedmont. France and Sardinia-Piedmont defeated Austria at Magenta and Solferino and so won Lombardy for a united Italy. Napoleon III, however, hurriedly arranged matters with the Austrians, allowing them to retain Venetia.\n\nCavour and Victor Emmanuel veiled their disappointment and waited. In the small states that checkered north-central Italy Cavour arranged plebiscites, or votes, on whether the people wanted their state to be united with Sardinia-Piedmont. Tuscany, Modena, Parma, and Emilia voted to cast out their princes and join Sardinia-Piedmont, the victor from the north. Napoleon III consented to the arrangement after Sardinia-Piedmont gave Savoy and Nice to France.\n\nGaribaldi Wins Sicily and Naples\n\nThe second step toward a united Italy came in 1860 with the acquisition of the south. The famous soldier of fortune Giuseppe Garibaldi and his thousand red-shirted volunteers stormed the island of Sicily and then the rest of the Kingdom of Naples on the mainland. The people everywhere hailed him as a liberator, and the hated king of Naples was driven out.\n\nVictor Emmanuel II was proclaimed king of Italy in February 1861. There remained only the Papal States and Venetia to be joined to the newly made Italian country. Italy gained Venetia in 1866, after Prussia, in alliance with Italy, defeated Austria. The Papal States alone were now outside the Italian kingdom. The lack of that central strip of territory was a very real handicap for Italy.\n\nThe Kingdom of Italy Is United\n\nFrench troops still guarded the pope’s sovereignty. Victor Emmanuel had learned much from Cavour (who had died in 1861). The king thus held off on attacking the French, not wanting to undo all that had been accomplished.\n\nThen in 1870 the Franco-Prussian War forced France to withdraw its soldiers from Rome. Immediately the Italian forces marched in. Pope Pius IX excommunicated the invaders and withdrew into the Vatican. Rome became the capital of a united Italy. The pope and his successors remained “voluntary prisoners” in the Vatican until the signing of the Lateran Treaty between Italy and the papacy in 1929. The treaty recognized the power of the pope to rule over Vatican City and other small properties. In return, the pope officially gave up the claim to rule Rome.\n\nThe Birth of Modern Italy\n\nGiant tasks lay before the new Italy. It was staggering under a load of debt and heavy taxation. Leaders of the various regions were in disagreement—even in conflict. Citizens found it difficult to adopt the ways of parliamentary government after being so long under despotic rule. The breach between newly formed socialist parties and the old conservative and reactionary elements widened. Riots and disorder marked the later years of the 19th century. In spite of the many problems, however, an army and navy were built up. Railroads, ports, and schools were constructed, and a merchant marine was developed. Manufacturing flourished.\n\nIn 1900 King Umberto I, son of Victor Emmanuel II, was assassinated. His son, Victor Emmanuel III, succeeded to the throne. Meanwhile Italian statesmen were attempting to gain territory in Africa for colonial expansion. On Africa’s east coast they obtained two colonies, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland (now part of Somalia). On the north coast of Africa, Italy won Tripoli (Libya) after a war with Turkey in 1911–12.\n\nItaly had joined with Germany and Austria in the Triple Alliance in 1882. The Alliance weakened as Italy tended toward friendship with France and England. Austria’s invasion of Serbia in 1914, after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, flouted the terms of the agreement. World War I broke out at the beginning of August 1914. Italy announced its neutrality on August 2.\n\nIn April 1915 Italy signed a secret treaty, the Treaty of London, with the Allies—Russia, France, and England. Italy was promised several territories in return for pledging to enter the war within a month. The next month Italy stated that it had withdrawn from the Triple Alliance. Despite the opposition of most Italians, who favored neutrality, Italy joined the war against Austria-Hungary in May. Italy later declared war on Germany and other Axis countries.\n\nThe Allies won World War I in 1918. Italy had suffered enormous losses—some 600,000 Italians had died in the war, and 950,000 more had been wounded. Many Italians, including both troops and civilians, had remained opposed to the war. Many of them had come to view the Italian state negatively. Italy’s share in the fruits of victory, when the old Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, was several territories formerly under Austrian rule. They included Trentino in the north and the peninsula of Istria at the head of the Adriatic.\n\nRise of Mussolini and Fascism\n\nAfter the deeply unpopular war, Italian society was bitterly divided. This weakened the political regime. Italy also faced severe economic problems. During the war, the country had printed money to pay for weapons, and inflation soared. People’s savings became nearly worthless, and unemployment was widespread. The economic depression brought strikes and riots. The government of King Victor Emmanuel III seemed powerless. Bands of former servicemen roamed the country—angry, embittered, and dangerous—eager to strike a blow against the evils that faced Italy. The bands were unorganized and lawless.\n\nIn these bands a new Italian “strong man,” Benito Mussolini, saw his opportunity. With his gift of eloquence he soon organized them into enthusiastic groups in each community. He armed them and set them to preserving order. They formed the core of his Fascist party. Fascist squads swept through the countryside. They used violence to destroy the organizations of their enemies, including socialists, communists, Roman Catholics, labor unions, and peasants’ cooperatives. The Fascists overthrew elected local councils. Fascist groups beat and killed people and looted and burned down buildings. They were often financed by landowners or industrialists. The Fascists were known as Blackshirts because they dressed in black-shirted uniforms.\n\nThe National Fascist Party grew rapidly because Mussolini promised benefits to everyone. The poor hoped for reforms that would end unemployment, raise wages, and lower prices. The rich viewed fascism as a way to stop the spread of communism, which they feared. By the end of October 1922, the Blackshirts, meeting in Naples, were strong enough to threaten to march on Rome and to seize the government. About 25,000 Fascists converged on Rome. The king, fearing civil war, refused to proclaim martial law. The prime minister resigned, and the king asked Mussolini to form a government. Mussolini thus became prime minister of Italy.\n\nDictator Abolishes Parties and Elections\n\nWithin a few years Mussolini had reorganized the government so that the people had no voice in it. He was known as Il Duce (“The Leader”), and all power rested in him. The king was retained as a figurehead because he was revered by the people. The king also had the support of many wealthy and important families. Mussolini abolished all parties except the National Fascist Party. He took from the Chamber of Deputies the power to consider any laws not proposed by him. In 1939 he replaced it with the Chamber of Fasces and Corporations, composed of all the members of his Council of Corporations and of the National Council of the Fascist party. No semblance of popular rule remained. Mussolini named the leaders of the provinces and the mayors of the cities.\n\nAll opposition was crushed. Suspected critics of the regime were sentenced to prison by special courts or were terrorized, tortured, or murdered by Blackshirt thugs. News was censored. Public meetings could not be held without the government’s permission. The new Fascist state was based on the doctrine that the welfare of the state is all-important. According to this view, the individual exists only for the state, owes everything to it, and has no right to protection against it. Mussolini’s code was: “Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.”\n\nSeizure of Ethiopia and Formation of the Axis\n\nMussolini longed to create a new Roman empire and to bring back Italy’s lost glory. To that end he trained a large army and built up the Italian navy. In 1935 he attacked the weak and poorly defended African country of Ethiopia. Italy conquered it the following year.\n\nIn October 1936 Italy began its partnership with Adolf Hitler’s Germany. At Mussolini’s invitation, the “Rome-Berlin Axis” was formed to oppose the power of France and England. Meanwhile, in Spain General Francisco Franco sought to overthrow the elected government. The Axis—Italy and Germany—helped Franco to victory in the Spanish Civil War. In April 1939 Italy invaded Albania, making it a protectorate (a dependent state). Italy and Germany then became formal military allies.\n\nDefeat in World War II\n\nGermany’s program of aggression plunged it into war with England and France on September 3, 1939. That was the beginning of World War II. Italy at first stayed neutral. Not until French power had been destroyed did Mussolini join Germany in the war. Then, on June 10, 1940, Italian forces attacked southeastern France in a “stab-in-the-back” invasion.\n\nItaly, however, lacked the military power, resources, and spirit for fighting a large-scale war. Within six months, Italian armies met defeat in Greece and North Africa. Italy then humbly accepted the armed aid of Germany. This military dependence soon grew into economic dependence, and Italy was forced to let Germany control its home affairs. Mussolini became a German puppet, and hard-pressed Italians fought only half-heartedly.\n\nThe Allies won all Italian territory in North Africa and invaded Sicily in July 1943. As a result, public unrest forced Mussolini to resign. He was arrested and held under guard. Italy’s constitutional monarchy was restored, with Marshal Pietro Badoglio as premier. Badoglio assured Germany that Italy would continue fighting the Allies. However, Germany sent troops pouring into Italy. The German troops took over most of central and northern Italy.\n\nItaly was already on the edge of collapse when the Allies invaded the mainland from Sicily on September 3, 1943. After a token resistance, Italy surrendered unconditionally that same day (effective five days later). The Germans immediately took over Rome. On October 13 Italy declared war on Germany. Meanwhile, Mussolini had been freed by German troops and had fled into German-held northern Italy. There he established an “Italian Social Republic.” In the next two years of war, the Allies slowly drove the Germans northward out of Italy.\n\nThe entire length of the mountainous country became a bitter battleground. German forces surrendered in northern Italy on April 29, 1945. Members of the anti-Fascist resistance captured Mussolini and shot him.\n\nThe end of the war found Italy with a large part of its industry and agriculture shattered. During the Nazi occupation, the Germans had commandeered supplies, almost stripping Italy. Bombing raids and the destructive tide of continuous battle ruined Italian factories, roads, docks, and entire villages. As the Germans retreated, they had wrecked remaining industries and transportation. People were cold, hungry, and jobless.\n\nThe Allies gave substantial quantities of food, clothing, and other supplies to Italy. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration gave more aid to Italy than to any other country. Reconstruction lagged, however, because of political turmoil and delay in drawing up a peace treaty.\n\nCitizens Choose a Republican Form of Government\n\nWhile Italy was a battleground, parties representing many political views, from the extreme left to the far right, had sprung up. The more liberal parties demanded an end to the monarchy. Backed by the Allies, however, Victor Emmanuel III remained king until the liberation of Rome in 1944. Then he delegated his power to his son Umberto. On May 9, 1946, Victor Emmanuel III formally stepped down in favor of his son, who reigned for less than one month as Umberto II.\n\nOn June 2, 1946, the Italian people voted to found a republic, a democratic state without a king or queen. The people elected deputies to a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution.\n\nPeace Treaty Strips Italy of its Empire\n\nNot until February 10, 1947, was the peace treaty from World War II ready for Italy’s signature. The treaty stripped Italy of its African empire of Libya, Italian Somaliland, and Eritrea. The pact also ceded the Dodecanese Islands to Greece. The region of Trieste became a free territory. The peace treaty gave some 3,000 square miles (7,800 square kilometers) to Yugoslavia, including most of the Istrian peninsula. Italy had to pay $360 million in reparations. It was also forced to recognize the independence of Ethiopia and Albania. South Tyrol, which Austria had been forced to cede after World War I, remained with Italy. The Italians felt that the treaty was harsh, since in 1943 they had joined the Allies in the war against Nazi Germany.\n\nThe United Nations made Italy the trustee of Italian Somaliland in 1949. The territory became part of the Somali Republic (now Somalia), which was proclaimed on July 1, 1960. The city of Trieste was given to Italy in 1954 by agreement with Yugoslavia.\n\nNew Constitution Bans Fascism\n\nItaly’s constitution became effective on January 1, 1948. (Its provisions are discussed in this article in the section “Government.”) The National Fascist Party and the monarchy were outlawed. Freedom of religion was guaranteed. However, Roman Catholicism remained the state religion until 1984.\n\nItalian leaders had the double task of creating a stable parliamentary system of government and restoring the economy. The war had sharpened Italy’s old problem of supporting a large and growing population on insufficient land. The poverty-stricken south was a drag on the improving economy of the north. The people demonstrated their frustrations with strikes and riots. The various political parties advanced their political and economic programs.\n\nItaly Since World War II\n\nPolitics\n\nAfter Italy’s experience under the authoritarian rule of Mussolini, the country created a new political system that would prevent its leader from becoming too powerful. The office of prime minister is thus fairly weak in Italy, and voting is by proportional representation. The prime minister must have majorities in both houses of parliament in order to govern. Since the 1950s, prime ministers have had to put together coalitions of political parties in order to form a majority. If a political party leaves the coalition, though, the prime minister’s government falls apart. Partly for that reason, Italy has had frequent changes in administration. In the first 50 years after 1945, the country had more than 50 changes of prime minister. However, many of the prime ministers served multiple, nonconsecutive terms.\n\nPostwar politics\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party played the strongest role in Italy’s political development after World War II. The party was predominantly Roman Catholic, moderate, and pro-Western in viewpoint. The Christian Democrats were held together by opposition to communism. However, they included members with left-of-center opinions and southern landowners and monarchists of the far right.\n\nAlcide De Gasperi of the Christian Democratic Party served as prime minister from 1945 to 1953. He helped oversee the reconstruction of Italy after the war. De Gasperi skillfully organized coalition governments representing parties with middle-of-the-road policies. He was an ardent advocate of European unity.\n\nThe Italian Communist Party was the second largest political party in Italy and the largest communist party in free Europe. Immediately after the war, the Italian Communist Party was estimated to have 2.5 million members. In addition to the two dominant parties, there were numerous smaller parties. They included the Italian Socialist Party on the left and the Italian Social Movement (founded by supporters of Mussolini) on the right.\n\nDespite periodic shifts in the composition of the government, the same group of parties, dominated by the Christian Democrats, remained in power in the postwar period. The Christian Democrats lost their majority in 1953. Afterward, they had to form coalitions with other parties in order to stay in power. Nevertheless, the Christian Democrats headed up most Italian governments until the early 1990s. Among the prominent Christian Democratic leaders were Amintore Fanfani, Aldo Moro, and Giulio Andreotti, each of whom served multiple terms as prime minister.\n\nIn 1981 a corruption scandal involving hundreds of public servants brought down the Christian Democratic government. For the first time in the 35-year history of the Italian republic, a non-Christian Democratic prime minister was elected. The Christian Democrats regained their power in 1982. The following year, however, Bettino Craxi became Italy’s first Socialist prime minister, serving from 1983 to 1987.\n\nPolitics since the 1990s\n\nItaly’s political party system changed radically in the 1990s. The change was partly due to the fall of communism in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe in 1991. The Christian Democratic Party’s stance against communism had won it strong support. When people no longer feared the spread of communism, the Christian Democrats lost much of their popularity.\n\nIn addition, a wave of political scandals and evidence of massive government corruption rocked Italy in the early 1990s. An anticorruption investigation led to the arrests of hundreds of politicians, party leaders, and businessmen. Nearly all of Italy’s political parties were involved, but the Christian Democrats and the Socialists were at the heart of a system of bribery. Coupled with new election laws, the corruption scandals ended the dominance of the Christian Democrats and ushered in a new era in Italian politics.\n\nMany of the main political parties dissolved in disgrace. The Christian Democrats became a much smaller organization named the Italian Popular Party. That party later merged with another and in 2007 became part of a new center-left party called the Democratic Party. The Communist Party remained an important political force for a time under a new name, the Democratic Party of the Left. That party also later became part of the new Democratic Party. The Italian Social Movement became a new party called the National Alliance. (However, the National Alliance renounced its fascist past.) The Socialists, who had been so important to the political system since the 1960s, became irrelevant.\n\nNumerous new political parties and alliances sprang up. Led by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, the right-wing Forza Italia party was formed in 1994. It became an important force in Italian politics. Berlusconi served as prime minister three times: in 1994, from 2001 to 2006, and from 2008 to 2011. The Northern League, a far-right party, was founded in 1991. Comedian Beppe Grillo created the populist and antiestablishment party called the Five Star Movement in 2009. New centrist parties included Civic Choice, the Union of the Center, and Democratic Center (center-left). Many centrist multiparty alliances, such as the Olive Tree and the House of Freedoms, were formed. However, they tended to be short lived.\n\nInternational Cooperation\n\nAfter World War II, Italy received aid from the United States through the Marshall Plan. The aid enabled Italy to rebuild its shattered economy and start on the road to recovery and development. In 1948 it joined the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (later replaced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to collaborate with other European countries in the aid program. Italy became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 and the United Nations in 1955.\n\nIn 1952 Italy became a founding state in the European Coal and Steel Community. The success of this organization led its six members—Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands—to found the European Economic Community (EEC), or Common Market, and the European Atomic Energy Community. They began operating on January 1, 1958. The Italian economy was greatly stimulated by membership in the EEC.\n\nItaly was one of the signers of the 1992 treaty that created the European Union (EU). Italy also participated in many later agreements on European political and economic union. The country adopted the euro, the EU’s common currency, in 1999. The EU remained far more popular in Italy than in many other European countries.(See also Europe.)\n\nProsperity with Problems\n\nItaly made rapid gains after World War II. The late 1940s and early 1950s were a period of recovery after the war. Italy then experienced a giant economic boom. The boom lasted from about the mid-1950s to the early 1960s. Before the war, Italy had been a relatively poor country. It had relied largely on farming for its income. After Italy’s economic boom, it became one of the most economically and socially advanced countries in the world.\n\nItaly’s economic growth was mainly due to spectacular gains in industrial production in the north. The underdeveloped south and the agricultural sector of the economy advanced little. To address this, the government introduced land-reform measures and regional development programs. The government also continued to own and operate many industries and businesses.\n\nThe Italian economy slowed down after 1963. In 1971 Italy had its largest economic recession since the country’s post–World War II recovery. Strikes affected nearly every sector of the economy as the Italian workers demanded social reforms. The problems of inflation, unemployment, and lack of housing continued in the 1970s. By the late 1980s, however, the Italian economy was again prospering.\n\nMeanwhile, devastating floods—the worst in 700 years—had hit the country in 1966. The floods ravaged about a third of the land and caused losses of more than $1.5 billion. Some of the priceless art treasures of Florence were damaged beyond repair. In 1980 an earthquake killed more than 3,000 people in the Naples area.\n\nTerrorism carried out by Italian extremists within Italy became a problem in 1969. Terrorist attacks continued through the 1970s. At first, neofascists—right-wing groups inspired by the fascism of the early 20th century—carried out much of the violence. They began planting bombs and derailing trains. The neofascist terrorists wanted to undermine the gains made by the labor movement and to encourage a right-wing coup.\n\nBy the mid-1970s left-wing terrorism was also a major problem. It was carried out by hundreds of former students and unemployed workers in many small groups. The terrorists were unhappy with the failures of the centrist government, among other problems. Left-wing terrorists kidnapped and killed politicians, judges, and journalists. The best-known left-wing terrorist organization was the Red Brigades. That group kidnapped former prime minister Aldo Moro, leader of the Christian Democratic Party, in March 1978. After holding Moro in Rome for 54 days, the Red Brigades murdered him. After the killing, the police were reorganized and given special powers. By the early 1980s the terrorist threat was greatly reduced.\n\nIn the late 20th century Italy also intensified its fight against organized crime. Criminal organizations carried out illegal activities of many kinds. These included drug smuggling, blackmail, extortion, and kidnapping for ransom. By the 1980s criminal groups dominated whole regions politically, socially, and economically. The Camorra controlled large parts of Campania and Naples, for example. The Mafia dominated Sicily. The government passed strong anti-Mafia laws for the first time in the 1980s, which led to many arrests.\n\nThe Italian economy entered the mid-1980s with a healthy growth rate. Good economic growth continued through the end of the 20th century. However, there were serious economic problems, including inflation and public debt. The country was able to lower the inflation rate in the 1980s. In the 1990s the government turned over numerous industries and businesses to private control.\n\nItaly was a member of the European Union from the start. Many Italians also wanted their country to participate in the common European currency, or euro. To adopt the euro, however, a country had to meet strict economic requirements. For that reason, Prime Minister Romano Prodi was able to win approval for large cuts in government spending. His government passed a series of budgets in the late 1990s that reduced Italy’s budget deficits. The budgets included cuts in government aid for health, pension, and other social-welfare programs. Italy thus met the conditions for adopting the EU’s currency. The euro replaced the lira as Italy’s unit of exchange on January 1, 1999.\n\nPublic debt still remained a problem. In the 1980s the government introduced a series of emergency measures to reduce public borrowing. Nevertheless, the country’s debt grew steadily throughout the 1980s. By 1991 Italy’s public debt exceeded its gross domestic product (GDP), or the total value of the goods and services produced during a year.\n\nItaly continued to have a huge public debt in the early 2000s. In addition, a global recession began affecting the Italian economy in 2009. The country’s economy slowed down, and its GDP fell. Unemployment levels increased, especially among young people. Italy was one of the countries at the heart of an economic crisis in the EU known as the euro-zone debt crisis. It was set off by high levels of public debt in some countries that used the euro. Public debt was particularly a problem in Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain. Together, these countries were grouped under the acronym “PIIGS.”\n\nThe Italian government passed a series of measures starting in 2011 to increase public revenue and to cut government spending. They included tax increases and raising the national retirement age. The measures were unpopular but were modestly successful at improving the economy. Although Italy’s public debt remained high, the country’s economy began to grow again.\n\nThe large public debt was one of several problems facing Italy in the early 21st century. Large numbers of refugees and other migrants arriving in Italy posed new challenges (see “People and Culture” above). Political instability, corruption, and inequalities between the north and south were ongoing problems. Nevertheless, Italy remained a far more prosperous country that it had been a hundred years earlier. Italy’s people enjoyed a high standard of living and a highly developed culture."
