        "text": "Executive power rests with the 10-member State Congress (cabinet), which is accountable to the parliament and is headed by two captains regent. As the joint heads of state with largely ceremonial roles, the captains are elected every six months by the legislature from among its own members. Although there is no official prime minister, the secretary of state for foreign and political affairs is regarded as the head of government. Following the December 2019 elections, Luca Beccari of the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS) was elected to the post in January 2020.\n\nThe 60 members of the unicameral Great and General Council are elected for five-year terms. The 2019 elections, called about a year early, were considered credible and free, and their results were accepted by stakeholders and the public. The elections were won by the opposition PDCS, which obtained 21 seats. The left-wing Tomorrow in Motion (DML) coalition came in second with 15 seats, followed by Libera San Marino with 10 seats, We for the Republic (NpIR) with 8 seats, and Future Republic (RF) with 6 seats. After the elections, the Christian Democrats formed a governing coalition with Tomorrow in Motion and We for the Republic.\n\nWhile citizens generally enjoy full political rights, women are underrepresented in the Great and General Council, where they held 19 seats after the 2019 elections, and in politics generally. An assessment mission from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) that was deployed ahead of the 2019 polls noted that gender quotas on candidate lists were undercut by the preferential voting system. Women are better represented in the country’s Electoral Council and in polling administration.\n\nAbout 16 percent of the population consists of noncitizens who do not have political rights in the country; most are Italian nationals. Under San Marino’s strict naturalization criteria, individuals without a citizen spouse, parent, or grandparent generally must live in the country for over 30 years to be eligible for citizenship.\n\nIn response to scandals involving high-ranking officials, San Marino has launched a series of programs to combat corruption and money laundering. In a 2018 report, GRECO found that progress had been made in closing key gaps in the legal framework, but that further improvements were required. GRECO’s 2020 report called for structural changes to San Marino’s judicial sector in order to prevent unwarranted political influence and to strengthen the country’s anticorruption framework. The report also highlighted the need to adopt a code of conduct for members of Parliament, which would require them to declare both conflicts of interest and assets. In response, the parliament approved a draft reform package in December 2021 aimed at strengthening the independence of the judiciary; related reforms amending the Code of Criminal Procedure remained awaiting approval at year’s end. Legislation enacting the reforms had not been passed at the end of 2021.\n\nIn 2017, several former officials were convicted of bribery, corruption, money laundering, and vote buying for their involvement in the so-called Conto Mazzini case. Multiple former captains regent and ministers received prison sentences ranging from two to eight years. Appellate hearings in the Conto Mazzini case, which first began in 2019, continued in September 2021.\n\nJudicial affairs are managed by a Judicial Council made up of first instance and appellate judges as well as members of Parliament. In 2020, various controversies relating to political interference in the judiciary unfolded, culminating in the removal of the three judges who had been investigating the so-called Conto Mazzini case, in which 17 high-ranking Sammarinese officials were sentenced in 2017 for their involvement in money laundering and other corrupt activities.\n\nIn response, a September 2020 report from GRECO called for structural changes to San Marino’s judiciary in order to limit political influence. The report also called for greater transparency and accountability in the country’s judicial sector, and for changes in the configuration of the Judicial Council and the appointment of judges. The report was accompanied by a letter from the CoE’s human rights commissioner imploring the government to safeguard the independence of the judiciary. In December 2021, the parliament introduced draft legal reforms aimed at strengthening judicial independence. Among other things, the proposed amendments include provisions that would require that politicians be removed from the Judicial Council.\n\nDue process rights surrounding charges and trials are generally upheld in practice. The authorities respect legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. However, the 2020 GRECO report on San Marino’s judiciary expressed concerns about the lack of professionalism and transparency in San Marino’s judicial system, and called for a more consistent, objective, and transparent allocation of cases. In addition, the report expressed a need to increase the accessibility to the public on judicial activity. The government’s removal and reassignment of the three judges presiding over the Conto Mazzini case raised questions as to the maintenance of due process in cases of corruption. In December 2021, the parliament proposed amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure that would enhance existing due process guarantees in the country if adopted.\n\nSan Marino law criminalizes the dissemination of ideas related to racial or ethnic superiority; acts of violence or discrimination on various grounds, including sexual orientation and gender identity; and incitement to such acts. However, discrimination based on skin color and language are not covered by these provisions. While San Marino lacks legislation guaranteeing equality and freedom from employment or other discrimination for LGBT+ people, in June 2019 referendum voters approved a constitutional amendment banning all forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nA 2018 report from the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) reiterated concerns about the absence of a strong and comprehensive antidiscrimination framework in the country. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has also urged San Marino to strengthen its laws against discrimination, in particular gender discrimination. Women face societal prejudices that affect their access to employment and economic opportunity.\n\nPersonal social freedoms are generally safeguarded in San Marino. A law allowing civil unions for same-sex couples was adopted by the Great and General Council in November 2018 and came into force in February 2019. However, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and same-sex couples do not have the right to adopt children together. In a September 2021 referendum, over 75 percent of participants voted in favor of legalizing abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy or if the pregnancy poses a danger to the life or health of the mother. Legislation implementing the referendum results is expected to be enacted in 2022. Reports of domestic violence, which is prohibited by law, are rare."
