It is claimed that San Marino is the world's oldest republic and was founded in 301 A.D. by Marinus, a Christian stonemason.[1] The state is located in Southern Europe and borders Italy. It is a land locked state consisting of mainly rugged mountains. The entire state is 61 square kilometers (23.5522317 square miles) and is approximately one third the size of Washington D.C. Most of the state consists of the Apennines Mountains. The lowest point in the country is Torrente Ausa at 55 meters. The highest point is Monte Titano at 755 meters. San Marino has a Mediterranean climate which consists of mild winters and warm summers.[2] The population of the state is 30,167 people, with 16.8% between the ages of 0 and 14, 65.8% between 15 and 64, and 17.4% 65 or older. The religion of the state is Roman Catholic. The nationality of San Marino is Sammarinese. The two main ethnic groups which are found within this state are Sammarinese and Italian. The language of the state is Italian.[3]\n\nBrief History\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe State of San Marino was founded by a Christian stonemason, Marinus, in 301 A.D. This makes San Marino the oldest republic in the world. Marinus fled to this area of Europe and created a small community of Christians with the same beliefs as him. The republic was originally named \"Land of San Marino\" and then later changed to \"Republic of San Marino\". The state of San Marino was originally governed by the Arengo. Then in 1243 the government established joint heads of state. These became the Capitani Reggenti or the Captains Regent. Until 1463, San Marino's boundaries were only those of Mount Titano. After that, Pope Pius II expanded San Marnio's borders to include three towns, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle. One more town later joined with San Marino later in the same year. Faetano became part of San Marino on their own. Within all the years that this state has been around, they have only been overtaken by other militaries twice. The first time was in 1503 when Cesare Borgia took over the country but only for a few months before he died. Then in 1739 Cardinal Alberoni took over the country by military force. People protested this with civil disobedience and by writing to the Pope. The Pope recognized San Marino's rights and restored the country's independence.[4]\n\nEconomic Development, Health, and Education\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe GDP for purchasing power parity for San Marino is $1.662 billion and the GDP for official exchange rate is $1.048 billion. The GDP per capita is $41,900. In San Marino, the unemployment rate is 3.1%. The average income in the state is .

The state's exports are building stone, lime, wood, chestnuts, wheat, wine, baked goods, hides and ceramics.[5]\n\nThere are 9.69 births per 1,000 of the population and 8.55 deaths per 1,000 of the population. The infant mortality rate is 5.53 deaths per 1,000 births. The average life expectancy at birth is 80.81 years.

The literacy rate for the country is 96%. The rate is 97% for males and 95% for females.[6]\n\nThe state of San Marino has a Civil Law Government.[7] The government structure is similar to that of Italy. On October 8, 1600 the constitution of San Marino was put into action. In addition to the constitution, there is the electoral law of 1926 and the manuscript of rights, which was developed in 1974. These two pieces of legistlation serve some other functions of the Constitution. There are three main branches of government within the state of San Marino. These include the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches and contain the following members of government: Executive: Captain Regent Francesco Mussoni and Captain Regent Stefano Palmieri (co-chiefs of state); Congress of State (cabinet) elected by the Great and General Council; Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs Antonella Mularoni (head of government). Legislative: unicameral parliament: 60-member Great and General Council. Judicial: Council of Twelve. In addition, there are nine municipalities which are part of the Administrative division of San Marino.[8] There are no reports of corruption within the state at this time[9]\n\nThere are nine political parties in the state of San Marino. These are:\n\nChristian Democratic Party of San Marino\n\nParty of Socialists and Democrats\n\nNational Alliance\n\nPopular Alliance\n\nUnited Left\n\nNew Socialist Party\n\nWe Sammarinesi\n\nSammarinesi for Freedom\n\nDemocrats of the Center\n\nThe voting age for the state is 18 years of age, and all people within the state are granted voting rights at that age.[10]\n\nJudicial Review\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Constitutional Court has an important roll within the country. This court is incharge of the following actions:\n\nVarify that laws, acts, and traditions are given the force of law conform to constitutional precepts\n\nVarify the admissibility of referenda\n\nDecide on conflicts between constitutional institutions\n\nControl the activity of the Captains Regent[11]\n\nCourts and Criminal Law\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nCOURTS: Consiglio dei XII (Council of Twelve)[12]\n\nThe Judiciary branch is composed of the following:\n\ncommissioner of the law\n\nthe judging magistrate\n\nthe appellate judge\n\nthe juvenile court\n\nthe judge of final appeal\n\nThe comissioner of the law deals with civil and penal cases whose penalties do not exceed a three year sentencing. The judging magistrates controll all other cases. These magistrates are appointed by parliament for terms of three years, however they can be reappointed indefinitely. The lower court judges mostly consist of Italian citizens. The final court of review is the judge of final appeal, who, in civil matters, either confirms or overrules the decision of either the lower court judgement or an appellate judge decision. When it comes to criminal matters, this court rules on the enforcement of judgement as well as the legitimacy of detention measures.\n\nJudges act independently and impartially on civil matters, and administrative remedies as well as judicial remedies exist for alleged wrongs. There were no reports of problems facing law enforcement agencies in enforcing domestic court orders.\n\nThe law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. Trials are public and are presided over by a single judge. There are no provisions for a jury trial. Defendants have the right to be present and to consult with an attorney even during preliminary investigations. Defendants can confront or question witnesses against them and present witnesses and evidence on their behalf. They have access to government held evidence relevant to their cases. They enjoy a presumption of innocence and have the right to two levels of appeal.\n\nIn case of legal actions against military personnel, a civil judge is temporarily given a military grade and assigned to a military tribunal.[13]\n\nPrison and Detention Center Conditions\n\nPrison conditions generally met international standards. The government permitted visits by independent human rights observers, but there were none during the year 2006.\n\nArrest and Detention\n\nSuspects were apprehended openly with warrants based on sufficient evidence and issued by a duly authorized official. The law provides a detainee with the right to a prompt judicial determination of the legality of his detention, and the authorities generally respected this right in practice. There is a well-functioning bail system. Detainees are allowed prompt access to family members and to a lawyer of their choice; the state provides legal assistance to indigent persons.[14]\n\nLegal Personnel\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nNo information on the legal personnel within the state could be found, other than the judges within the state (See Courts and Criminal Law)\n\nLaw Enforcement\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nCivilian Police Force A non-military police force which, when necessary, works in collaboration with the Gendarmerie.
