        "text": "LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE CRUCIAL! TODAY is election day for many local offices, so make sure you speak with likeminded friends, family and neighbors! TELL those you care about before you forget! üëçüèº The offices of Mayor, Town Council, Police Commissioner and all supervisory town positions are critical to carrying out the will of the people at the local level, which includes FUTURE ELECTION INTEGRITY. Pictured is current Rochester, NH Mayor Paul Callaghan and I strongly support him seeking another term. Below in the first comment is his re-election announcement with New Hampshire‚Äôs most circulated newspaper, The Union Leader. Please read some of what Paul has done for Rochester, NH in the first comment and get out and vote wherever you are! In my opinion, ‚Äúnon partisan‚Äù positions in reality are anything but when one side seeks to increase budgets and taxes and the other side seeks not to do this. Always check and see who someone is affiliated with now and in the past for all offices but especially local. #rochesternh #newhampshire #newhampshirejobs #newhampshirerealestate #policy #policymakers #constitution #electionintegrity #electionsecurity #electionday\n\nWholesale changes in how and when recounts take place in Michigan elections came up for discussion Wednesday at a Senate committee. The Senate Elections and Ethics Committee adopted S-1 substitutes for SB 603 and SB 604. The major changes are in SB 603, and they would dramatically alter the recount process. The thresholds for automatic recounts would change. And legislative races would now have automatic recount thresholds. The timetable for recount petitions and counter petitions to be filed would change. Further provisions deal with the deposit costs for recounts and having a standardized form for petitioning for a recount. https://bit.ly/43jJMXR\n\nCurrently, our country is in the midst of its 18th General Elections, and naturally, it‚Äôs been discussed by all and sundry. However, all that discussion is only about which party is going to win people‚Äôs mandate and claim its stake at forming the next government. Sadly, the involvement of the general public, minus the newly-incentivized party supporters, in the General Elections is only to stand in long queues in the scorching heat and cast their precious vote for the party/party representative, who they believe or have been made to believe, will change their fortunes. That is the only role, we Indians have been playing and will continue to play, in this election season as well. The people have no say in the manifestos of their favorite parties or the ones opposing them. Ironically, these manifestos are drafted by those who come and seek votes from the general public. Why not have manifestos drafted by general public on a common portal? Why not have manifestos that have policies for the real issues, the general public faces on a daily basis? Why pass on the power to those, who seek our vote to serve us. Why not empower the general public in decision making? Why just empower them to Vote!\n\n‚ÄúFree and fair elections‚Äù is a phrase that seems to be tossed around a lot these days. It is often invoked as the standard of ‚Äúpreserving democracy,‚Äù but all too often, politicians who invoke these phrases use them to justify whatever actions they want to take or claims they want to make, even when those actions or claims have little or nothing to do with ensuring that elections are either free or fair. I do believe that ‚Äúfree and fair elections‚Äù are the backbone of a functioning republic (not ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù), but unlike some others, I am willing to go on record to state precisely what I think that means and what it requires. As a candidate for re-election to Idaho‚Äôs House of Representatives, I am committed to promoting an election system in which every vote is protected with the utmost integrity, where voters are encouraged to exercise their civic responsibilities. Stand with me at JoeForIdaho.com . . . #FreeAndFairElections #ProtectOurVote #PreserveDemocracy #ElectionIntegrity #CivicResponsibility #JoeForIdaho #HouseOfRepresentatives #IdahoElections #PromoteElectionIntegrity\n\nIAAI Friend: Today is the day the elections open for our association. As we all know, elections have consequences This year we have two members for 2nd Vice President and 5 members for the four Director positions Please review the candidate profiles in the journal. If you are not familiar with a candidate, reach out to someone and find out. For IAAI Director, you can vote for up to four Also, there are three proposed constitutional amendment changes. I would encourage you to review the comments related to them on the website The Board of Directors voted to support/endorse 2023-02 and 2023-03. They also voted to oppose 2023-01. The Past Presidents Council also provided comments related to the changes. They also opposed 2023-01 and supported 2023-02 and 1023-03. Please review and be informed. Just because a proposed amendment appears on the ballot doesn‚Äôt meet it is in the best interest of the association. Be involved! Be informed! VOTE!\n\nNow the Poms have called an election, in the same year as the Yanks. It will be the UK‚Äôs 22nd general election since WW2; this year‚Äôs US election will be their 20th, in that time. We‚Äôve had 30. As noted yesterday, there have been just five occasions on which we and the U.S. have held an election in the same year. The Brits and the Americans (including this year) have held elections in the same year on only three occasions. We‚Äôve had an election in the same year as the UK nine times (if Albo goes this year, it will be ten). But, so far, there‚Äôs never been an instance of all three of us having an election in the same year. The UK has the distinction of being the only joint to hold two elections in one year: 1974. It can‚Äôt happen in the US and has simply never happened here.\n\n\"The Greens are rarely so prominent in these types of line graphs of vote share. If these results had been replicated in general elections over the same time period, the constituency would have been held by the Liberal Democrats from 2001 to 2015, then briefly Green before returning to Liberal Democrat.\" Read my latest article to find out more about this new constituency, it‚Äôs certainly one to watch out for.
