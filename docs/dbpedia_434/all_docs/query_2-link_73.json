        "text": "The case of Carinthia\n\nAustria's southernmost province was dominated by the FPÖ under the charismatic leadership of Jörg Haider for close to 13 years.Footnote 4 Unlike the social democrats that had previously dominated the province's political landscape, Haider was able to pick up on and use globalization to his advantage. He realized that there were groups unable to cope with these extreme transitions – political science terms these people the ‘modernization losers’ (Luther Reference Luther, Merkl and Weinberg2003) – the introduction of computers, the opening of borders and the development of the European Union (Interviewee 1.2, political scientist). Throughout the 1990s, many people, particularly those less educated, felt increasingly threatened by immigrants and generally feared being left behind (Quinones Reference Quinones2017). Those were precisely the type of people that Haider was able to get on his side. He led an aggressive populist-style campaign throughout the 1990s, stressing issues such as political corruption, ‘over-foreignization’ and immigrant criminality and the values of the ‘little man’ to win over these voters (Luther Reference Luther, Merkl and Weinberg2003). This was the beginning of the shift of the working-class people from the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) to the FPÖ.\n\nIn the specific case of health, there was a long-standing tradition that the social democrats dominated the health portfolio both nationally and subnationally. The reason for this is that ‘the SPÖ had the most pronounced health political ideas and also the greatest acceptance amongst the population in this area’ (Interviewee 1.5, politician). Thus, it comes as no surprise that in Carinthia, the reds (SPÖ) were always given the health portfolio.\n\nHowever, there were a few things the FPÖ did do within the Carinthian health sector. First, Haider introduced many structural reforms as he knew that only by changing the structures would he get his people, the FPÖ, into positions of power generally held by the SPÖ. ‘This is something that Haider was exceptionally good at: combining departments, changing them, or splitting them and thus being able to place new people in positions of power’ (Interviewee 1.2, political scientist). One of these structural reforms led to the FPÖ's ‘domination of the KABEG, Carinthia's hospital management company supervisory board. This move limited the competencies of the SPÖ health adviser’ (Interviewee 1.5, politician).Footnote 5 With the advisory board of the hospital management company under its belt, the FPÖ, in accordance with the ÖVP, sought to reduce or eliminate the influence of the provincial government on the provincially owned hospital infrastructures. The goal was privatization wherein ‘the FPÖ and ÖVP worked together to turn these structures into self-made companies so that the political influence, which was primarily present through the SPÖ, could be reduced’ (Interviewee 1.2, political scientist).\n\nThe FPÖ not only wanted to dominate advisory boards within the healthcare sector to reduce the SPÖ's influence, but it also wanted to decrease bureaucratic structures within hospitals. This was significant as ‘a not so small portion of the provincial budget’ was dedicated to the hospital infrastructure in the province (Interviewee 1.4, politician). This meant that by keeping hospital administrations thin and by dominating the advisory boards, the FPÖ could redistribute funds allocated to hospitals and use them elsewhere.\n\nIn fact, during Haider's second term, 2000–5, ‘the FPÖ wanted to close several regional hospitals and medical institutions to save money. They produced studies that would have led to clear cuts’ (Interviewee 1.4, politician). The SPÖ, in charge of the province's health department, argued that there was no question that savings needed to be made; however, these savings should be acquired through a better-suited work distribution of the regional hospitals and a better endowment of the central hospitals, the Klinikum Klagenfurt and Villach, and not through the closure of any hospitals. The SPÖ had also argued that ‘closing these hospitals would have had major consequences as the regional hospital and medical institutions were important employers and built up important social structures’ (Interviewee 1.4, politician). The SPÖ easily deflected deals involving healthcare because it could be proved that such takeovers – privatization – would never have been beneficial to the patients.\n\nThe general problem with the FPÖ and health was that ‘they did not have an identified health programme’ (Interviewee 1.5, politician) or plan, which is why the SPÖ continued to dominate the health sector despite the FPÖ's attempts to ‘disempower the health adviser and force through their privatization plans’ (Interviewee 1.4, politician). What made the FPÖ so dangerous when it came to health was ‘their vulnerability to proposals where the quality of health services were promised to be upheld, but money could be saved by sliming bureaucratic structures’ (Interviewee 1.4, politician). German companies wanted to take over Carinthian hospitals time and time again, and the FPÖ was easily persuaded by this as promises of increased savings were made. A prime example of such a case was:\n\nWhen the FPÖ appointed a certain Ms Manegold from Germany as KABEG supervisor in 2010. She worked very closely with the FPÖ health speaker Kurt Scheuch. The relationship between the two resulted in several lawsuits, Manegold's dismissal, and most importantly, a very weak and inconsistent regional structural plan for health that lacked implementation due to the political opportunism practised by the FPÖ. (Interviewee 1.5, politician)\n\nA non-contested position was reached on the point of healthcare between all involved parties, and the SPÖ resumed complete control of the health advisory position without the interference of the FPÖ.\n\nDespite the FPÖ's questionable involvement in specific health (primarily hospital) projects, ‘to give Haider (or the FPÖ) any profile relating to health would be presumptuous. The health sector and the employee representation sector are two things that Haider generally didn't touch; he mostly left these to the SPÖ’ (Interviewee 1.3, politician). This meant that decisions such as prevention strategies, ensuring public health services and implementing the federally regulated decisions generally fell into the hands of the SPÖ. The FPÖ, for its part, favoured structural and administrative minimalism and privatization so that it could use the generous budget given to hospitals for other priorities. The surplus budget was used by the FPÖ to ‘take care of their own, while successfully shutting out the rest. They tried to do this using as few resources as possible (in, for example, the healthcare sector) to be able to “buy” political success’ (Interviewee 1.4, politician) in other areas, thereby following a more liberal chauvinist approach to healthcare while simultaneously following a welfare chauvinist approach in other sectors.\n\nThe maintenance and survival of the healthcare sector in Carinthia can be attributed to the strength of the SPÖ, as without its years of experience, diligence and conscientiousness, many hospitals would have been closed. It also saved the province from sell-outs to Germany, which would have left the healthcare budget severely strained, the unemployment rate higher than necessary and a very likely scenario of a two-tiered hospital system.\n\nThe findings in the case of the FPÖ and Carinthian health policies come down to one main point: avoid the health sector and leave it in the hands of the SPÖ unless money can be deflected into other sectors, thereby upholding the ‘Carinthia first’ mentality.\n\nThe case of Burgenland\n\nLocated in the country's easternmost corner, Burgenland is not only the region with the country's smallest population (293,433) but also the youngest addition to the country of Austria (1921 (News.at 2005)). Switching between Christian democrat (ÖVP)- and social democrat (SPÖ)-led governments after its initial founding, Burgenland settled on a steady line of SPÖ governors, starting in 1965 with the ÖVP as its coalition partner. In 2016, this dynamic changed. The SPÖ still had the majority in the province but chose to form a coalition with the FPÖ. While this decision caused outrage among the federal SPÖ party, the cooperation mainly worked in favour of the provincial SPÖ for two reasons. In holding a governmental role, the FPÖ's criticism of the government significantly decreased as it was no longer in opposition, and its political support in the region decreased as it was given less significant roles within the regional administration and thus had less opportunity to claim credit for achievements important to its followers. These occurrences, coupled with the region's general makeup, took the wind out of the FPÖ's short-lived sails, making it an essentially uninfluential party in the governmental history of the province.\n\nThe FPÖ did not have nearly as much electoral success in Burgenland as it did in Carinthia. By 1987 the party reached over 5% in the parliamentary elections (7.31%) and slowly began growing, making itself known as an opposition party that was not afraid to criticize the SPÖ/ÖVP provincial government. Although the FPÖ had a short stint in the 1996 SPÖ/ÖVP coalition government, the FPÖ was clearly the junior party and was only given one portfolio, while the other two parties received three portfolios apiece, including the governorship and vice-governorship.\n\nThe FPÖ in Burgenland always had the lowest provincial parliament election results. Why? Burgenland was, for longer than in other regions, made up of predominately blue-collar workers. You can probably count on two hands the amount of industrial business there is, and 97% of all businesses are small or medium-sized. So, here the SPÖ found a population structure that more or less meshed well with their programme as elsewhere. Another point – the small structure of the province. It is very accessible, meaning that politicians here can be everywhere and have this closeness with the people that is often hard to establish elsewhere. It doesn't matter if they are promoting a new fire truck; if it's a sports match, something cultural, 300,000 inhabitants have the possibility to be in contact with politicians in a very uncomplicated way. (Interviewee 1.8, politician)\n\nThe SPÖ was able to keep a closeness with the citizens over the years, and by being a more established and bigger party, it left no room for the FPÖ to expand in the political arena.\n\nBy the 2015 elections, the migration crisis was in full swing and the FPÖ, both nationally and subnationally, used this to its advantage. Slogans such as ‘The flood of asylum seekers is rising unchecked!’ or ‘Did you know that you will become a stranger in your own country?’ (Hengst Reference Hengst2015) filled campaign posters and speeches, creating uncertainty in the country and the province. Not surprisingly, the FPÖ profited electorally from this, gaining 6%, putting it at 15.04%. Although the FPÖ was still in third place in the overall election results, Governor Hans Niessl (SPÖ), entering his fourth term, noticed the growing strength of the FPÖ and decided to join forces with it.\n\nThe FPÖ was given two roles in Niessl's fourth government (2015–19): FPÖ party head Johann Tschürtz became deputy governor and was in charge of the security portfolio, and Alexander Petschnig (FPÖ) was given the portfolio of tourism and economy; all the other portfolios, including health, stayed in the hands of the SPÖ.\n\nWhile it seemed as if the FPÖ played a relatively insignificant role in the Niessl government, its hard line on immigration began influencing the SPÖ governor. In 2016, Niessl told the media that ‘in areas where unemployment is particularly high, the free movement of people must be restricted, for example in construction and related trades’, which gained him prompt support from his coalition partner Petschnig (FPÖ), who added, ‘Given the drama of the situation [referencing the migration waves], a sectoral closure of the labour market is the order of the day’ (Orovits Reference Orovits2016). Interestingly, both the SPÖ and the FPÖ were only speaking about the construction industry and not the tourism industry, since foreigners made up 54% of the tourist industry in Burgenland, whereas construction ‘only’ counted for 35% (Orovits Reference Orovits2016). Looking at the other industries, agriculture has 74% foreign workers in the province and healthcare workers, specifically carers, are mostly ‘independent’, self-employed, female, foreign nurses who are placed through agencies (Kuhlmann et al. Reference Kuhlmann2020).\n\nAs to actual accomplishments, the FPÖ Burgenland party head, Géza Molnár, stated in an interview, ‘we put an end to the debt policy, there are more jobs, more employers and the tourism numbers are better than ever, and we made Burgenland safer’ (Tscheinig Reference Tscheinig2019). In addition, the FPÖ claimed that the coalition did not argue – as was previously common under the SPÖ/ÖVP – but instead worked together in a very solution-oriented, trusting partnership. The FPÖ managed to stay in government with two portfolios (safety and the economy as well as tourism) from 2015 until 2020, after which the new governor Hans-Peter Doskozil (SPÖ) won the absolute majority and did not need a coalition partner.\n\nThe case of Burgenland shows how other parties can reduce the policy and political influence of the FPÖ. By forming a coalition with their most critical opposition party, the SPÖ managed to silence the FPÖ, thereby decreasing its power and influence. In addition to this strategy, the SPÖ in Burgenland also adopted the FPÖ's anti-immigrant stance. This welfare chauvinist approach coupled with its own position on welfare expansion allowed the SPÖ to win the absolute majority in the province and dispose of its PRR partner. This case demonstrates that a PRR party can, in fact, be defeated and that mainstream parties' adoption of some PRR policies (such as a harder stance on migration) can help in elections.\n\nThe case of Lombardy\n\nThe region of Lombardy is located in the far north of the country, surrounded by the regions Trentino-Alto Adige and Veneto on the east and Piedmont on the west. With the Italian healthcare reform in the 1990s (Decrees 502/92 and 517/93) – when the national government decided to decentralize healthcare, leaving it up to the regions how they wanted to spend public money – Lombardy, at that time under the leadership of Roberto Formigoni (FI), took a different route from the other regions. While most regions continued to use the central government's reimbursement rates and quality standards, Lombardy passed Regional Law 31/1997 and set up a quasi-market model (Brenna Reference Brenna2011).\n\nThe difference between the Lombard model and perhaps the more traditional healthcare models adopted in central Italy concern freedom of choice:\n\nFrom the patients' point of view, the difference between, for example, the regional Emilia Romagna model and the Lombardy model is the freedom of choice. So, in Lombardy, they pay the same, but they have a wider freedom of choice as they can choose freely between public and private providers. There were no differences in terms of the rights the service provided and even the waiting times. (Interviewee 2.5, public health expert)\n\nWhile there might have been advantages in a hospital-centric system in the early 1990s, it seems that the disadvantages of such a system began increasingly apparent over time – culminating with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt is important to mention Roberto Formigoni (FI), president of the region from 1995 until 2013, even though he does not belong to the Lega party. According to Cristiano Gori (Reference Gori and Gori2010), Formigoni and thus the FI, along with the regional health council, was responsible for implementing the Lombard regional health model (described above). This very hospital-centric model considered ‘general practitioners [GPs] useless under Formigoni and even under the Lega’ (Interviewee 2.17, economic sociologist and social policy expert). Formigoni adopted this new model based on the subsidiary principle. Not only did Formigoni and FI as a whole play an essential role in this transformation, but Catholic interest (such as Comunione e Liberazione) and business groups were also brought on board to solidify the quasi-market model. What is important to understand is that:\n\nThe president of Lombardy for almost 20 years, Formigoni, came directly from its [Comunione e Liberazione] ranks. So, what Formigoni did for 20 years was practically occupy the healthcare system in Lombardy. So, it means that every time they had to replace someone like … I don't know … the head of surgery department or whatever, they tried as much as they could to put their own people in, people loyal to the traditional Catholic Church. (Interviewee 2.17, economic sociologist and social policy expert)\n\nThe involvement of the Catholic Church in the Lombard healthcare system made it even more unique. For example, in Lombardy, ‘you could not become, or you were not able to become, a doctor in gynaecology if you were not supported by the Catholics’, and it was challenging at the time to ‘use your right of abortion because most doctors did not allow it’ (Interviewee 2.17, economic sociologist and social policy expert). Furthermore,\n\nThey [the Formigoni government] opted for a very different framework, where the private sector had the upper hand over the public. San Raffaele Hospital, San Donato Hospital. If you look at the name, all the hospitals, all the private hospital in Italy, are named after a saint: San Donato, San Raffaele, because the majority of the hospitals in Italy were originally founded by the Catholic Church. (Interviewee 2.6, medical and public health expert)\n\nDuring the Formigoni presidency (1995–2013), welfare (specifically health) was also heavily associated with the freedom of choice and the will of the market (Pavolini Reference Pavolini2008). In addition, ‘the provision of health services, both in hospital and in the community setting, depended solely on hospitals’ (Interviewee 2.18, medical professional and public health expert), implying that the system was hospital-centric. This association did not change when the Lega took over the presidency in 2013. Although Roberto Maroni (Lega, 2013–18) recognized and attempted to change the system's imbalances, he, as well as his successor Attilio Fontana (Lega, 2018–present), were unable to change the existing market-based model.\n\nStarting in 2005, with Alessandro Cè's (Lega) appointment as councillor of health, the Lega almost constantly controlled the regional health department (Vampa Reference Vampa and Vampa2016), thereby marking the Lega's increasing strength as a coalition partner in the centre-right Formigoni government. However, because Formigoni played such a decisive role within the health sector, Cè's opinions mattered little and were ‘practically crushed by Formigoni’ (Interviewee 2.17, economic sociologist and social policy expert). Heart surgeon Luciano Bresciani (Lega) replaced Cè in the autumn of 2007. In 2012, Bresciani stepped down after a fraud investigation (involving President Formigoni) regarding bribes paid to a medical supply company (Milano Today 2014). These accusations also led to the resignation of Formigoni, who was replaced by Roberto Maroni (Lega) in 2013. In sum, the Lega's role in healthcare at this time was essentially appeasing Formigoni’s neoliberal quest to privatize healthcare. Despite holding important positions (such as health councillor), the Lega was powerless against Formigoni and the FI structures.\n\nWhen Maroni took over the presidency, two critical changes in healthcare were made. In 2015, Law 23/2015 promised to enhance the social welfare aspect of the healthcare model by increasing support for community welfare. It also sought to rebuild the local structure of governance to decrease institutional fragmentation. In essence, the goal was to centralize the region in certain aspects.\n\nThe second change occurred when the Maroni government introduced a new ‘autonomous income’ (reddito di autonomia) in 2015, which was explicitly created to support the more disadvantaged sectors of society (such as unemployed, elderly and disabled people) (Vampa Reference Vampa and Vampa2016). The central government strongly criticized this law (Senato della Repubblica 2017) as it claimed that with Resolutions X/5117 and X/6164, Lombardy was completely modifying healthcare, thereby replacing some of the founding pillars of the Health Reform Law 833 of 1978. The fear was that the new autonomous income was attempting to privatize public care for the chronically ill (Senato della Repubblica 2017).\n\nA final point of action worth mentioning is that Maroni threatened to cut regional transfers to municipalities that hosted refugees (Vampa Reference Vampa and Vampa2016). In an open letter to the municipalities, Maroni stated the following:\n\nI decided to write a letter to the prefects to warn them about bringing new illegal immigrants here to Lombardy. I also decided to write to the mayors to tell them to refuse to take them. If mayors accept them, we will reduce regional transfers as a disincentive because they do not have to. Whoever accepts illegal immigrants is violating the law and will suffer this consequence (la Repubblica 2015).\n\nThese words were supported by the president of Veneto, Luca Zaia (Lega), who backed Maroni, stating, ‘we are mad at the inadequate government that, in official documents, invites us to manage the “acute phase” of immigration. When we all know that it is not acute, it is chronic’ (la Repubblica 2015). While it was not officially stated, one can assume that both presidents rejected supporting the new immigrants due to financial reasons and nativist sentiments. In 2018, Attilo Fontana (Lega) took over the presidency, and his legacy will likely revolve around how poorly he and his minister of health initially managed the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn summary, Lombardy was heavily influenced by Formigoni, the FI party and the Catholic movement Comunione e Liberazione, making it difficult for the Lega to create its own health agenda when it took control of the region in 2013. What did become apparent through the changes that the Lega was able to make in Lombardy is that it followed, whether willingly or not, the liberal chauvinist path that the FI set out. In addition, the Lega attempted to centralize power in the region and began threatening mayors who wanted to bring illegal immigrants into their municipalities. Whether this can be interpreted as being partial to a more welfare chauvinist approach to health and social benefits remains unclear.\n\nThe case of Veneto\n\nThe Veneto region is located in the north-eastern quadrant of Italy. To the east, it is bordered by Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Adriatic Sea, and to the west, it borders Trentino-Alto Adige and Lombardy. Veneto's southern border is shared with Emilia-Romagna. Veneto follows the Aree Vaste model of healthcare. The only difference between this model and the classic Italian healthcare model is that there is an extra level of bureaucracy between the regional government and the local health units (azienda sanitaria locale – ASL).\n\nUnlike the Lombard system, the Venetian healthcare model is characterized by ‘a strong orientation towards meeting the needs of individuals as well as the community through the integration of health and social services’ (WHO 2016: 16). This becomes apparent when one looks at where the power to make healthcare decisions lies:\n\nIn Veneto, I think regional bureaucracy is still very strong. But I mean, regional power is strong, but the power is probably more distributed, between the regional bureaucracy and local managers. In Lombardy, on the other hand, local mayors have no influence on healthcare. While certainly in Veneto, they have some influence, to a certain extent. (Interviewee 2.21, economic sociologist and social policy expert)\n\nWhile decision-making power in Lombardy is strictly regionally based with regards to healthcare, in Veneto, decisions are more devolved, fitting nicely with the community-based model and the integration of services. Also, contrary to the Lombard model, primary care plays a central role in the Venetian system. Thus, it is not surprising that the GP is the first contact point for patients and central to the Venetian healthcare system.\n\nUnlike President Formigoni in Lombardy, President Giancarlo Galan (FI, 1995–2010) did not come from the Catholic faction of FI, ‘he did not come from this specific movement called the Comunione e Liberazione’ (Interviewee 2.21, economic sociologist and social policy expert). Thus, when it became time to decide what kind of healthcare system the region should implement, he opted for ‘a more traditional system, placing much more importance on outpatient care and public services. So, in some ways Veneto, the organization of the healthcare system is more similar to Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany, so the red, social democratic, regions’ (Interviewee 2.21, economic sociologist and social policy expert).\n\nLuca Zaia (Lega) became president of the region in 2010. He and his regional council, led by Health Minister Luca Coletto (Lega), supported Galan's system. They ‘followed this traditional path’ (Interviewee 2.21, economic sociologist and social policy expert), making no efforts to change it into something more market-oriented. In fact, ‘I don't expect privatization, I expect that they keep on investing in public healthcare. My impression in Veneto was that the League was just keen on organizing the system, not transforming it’ (Interviewee 2.17, economic sociologist and social policy expert).\n\nIn 2012, the Zaia government implemented a regional planning legislation (Regional Law 23/2012) that made the system even more patient-oriented by placing the person at the healthcare system's centre (Ghiotto et al. Reference Ghiotto2018). Four years later, in 2016, the government passed Regional Law 19/2016, defining a new primary care model in which integrated medical groups were promoted. The idea that ‘Veneto is a lot closer to central Italy’ regarding healthcare was confirmed with this change. Unlike in Lombardy, where GPs were seen as useless, Veneto praised GPs as being ‘an important part of the network, of the care network’ (Interviewee 2.17, economic sociologist and social policy expert). These changes solidified the patient- and community-oriented nature of the Venetian system and proved to be very beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn summary, under the leadership first of President Galan (FI) and then President Zaia (Lega), Veneto followed a very community-based approach to healthcare with little to no privatization. While both these approaches to healthcare found more similarities with social democratic parties' health policies, it is unclear what role the Lega's nationalistic sentiments will play into the health system design and health policies in the future (recall the quotation regarding migrants in the previous section)."
