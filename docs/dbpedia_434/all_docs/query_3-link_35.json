        "text": "A number of parties raised concerns about the amendments themselves and the process under which they were initiated. The Christian Democratic Union and its federal faction partner, the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CDU/CSU) parliamentary group asked that the deliberations be postponed, arguing that the members of the Committee on Internal Affairs and Community had not received the Committee communication about the planned deliberations until midday on the day before the meeting. In the CDU/CSU parliamentary groupâ€™s view, a rushed process was inappropriate given the importance of the amendments. The Left Party parliamentary group was also on the position that the motion for the amendments was submitted at short notice, and there was insufficient time to assess their constitutionality and formulate a parliamentary response. Lastly, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) parliamentary group contended that the amendments should be reconsidered, because the motion for an amendment included an entirely new proposal, which was not discussed by the commission."
