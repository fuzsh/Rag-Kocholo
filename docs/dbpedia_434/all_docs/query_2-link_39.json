        "text": "The purpose of this article is to cast some light on the intellectual and cultural roots of Christian Democratic Europeanism as it unfolded from the mid-1940s through to the birth of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. It traces the vision of Europe promoted by Christian Democracy in the context of 1920s German-Catholic ideas about the ‘Christian West’ (Das Abendland), understood as a supranational and symbolic space between Bolshevik Russia and capitalist America. The claim here is that Christian Democracy came to develop close affinities with this view, which was anti-materialist, anti-socialist and anti-liberal at the same time as it was hierarchical and organicist. Based on an idealisation of medieval Christian Europe, its organising concept was that of the pre-modern Catholic ‘West’, and, partly for that reason, it could never easily turn nationalist nor indeed fascist. As any truly Catholic (i.e. universal, from the Greek, khatolikos) position must be, it was contrary to nationalism without thereby becoming internationalist. In mutated form and in the context of the Cold War, this view played an important role in the political revamping of post-Second World War Western Europe, in the ‘European’ thought and language of Christian Democracy and the commitment to the project of European integration.\n\nCertainly, European integration involved small administrative and economic steps that did not always resemble a grand intellectual vision. The European project emerged out of hard-nosed political and economic bargaining, strategic concerns and technocratic imperatives shared by the Christian Democratic ‘founding fathers’ of Europe (Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman and Alcide De Gasperi) and other stakeholders, including US State Department planners.Footnote 1 Wolfram Kaiser has insightfully investigated how transnational Christian Democratic networks – reflecting the history of political Catholicism since the mid-to-late nineteenth century – shaped the process of political and economic integration of Europe and its institutional structure after 1945, even before the inception of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951. Kaiser argues that, in contrast to alternative political worldviews, only Christian Democracy had both the commitment and the transnational network to ensure the success of Jean Monnet's plan for coal and steel integration, advanced by Schuman to the French government and to Adenauer in May 1950.Footnote 2\n\nWhilst this article remains indebted to a transnational approach to European history, it adds to it a symbolic and experiential dimension. Kaiser's book, focusing almost exclusively on networks and historic institutionalism, does not pay sufficient attention to the patterned (recurrent and real, lived) experiences that lay at the base of Christian Democratic Europeanism and to the connections in experience, thought and practice established during the crucial transformative period that led to European integration. In this sense, Kaiser fails to pin down what is really unique and ‘Christian’ about the democratic movement that spread across Europe and was then institutionalised at this crucial historical juncture. Unearthing these deeper foundations and the background experiences that animated this institutionalisation allows for an understanding of the philosophical baggage that Christian Democrats translated into the process of integration. Given the current heated discussions over Europe's founding values and the deepening crisis of integration, this perhaps deserves more attention than it currently receives.\n\nThis article will delineate the specificities of the Christian Democratic vision of a unified Europe epitomised by the reconfiguration of the Abendland – as a concept, ideology, and shared imaginary – with respect to alternative political and cultural readings.Footnote 3 It demonstrates how the Abendland assumed different functions throughout history. The idea is not to set the Abendland against rational choices, institutional and informal networks or the Realpolitik of the time. It is instead to highlight the importance of cultural symbols, semantics and meanings in shaping perceptions, attitudes and politics; to provide, through a genealogical account of post-Second World War Christian Democratic Europeanism, a way to map the interactions of cultural meanings with structures of power and political practices that are often below the conceptual radar of politicians and intellectuals. This article argues that the re-signification of the Abendland by Christian Democracy in the specific context of the early Cold War era was the symbolic response to a condition of political and existential uncertainty: it was a process of meaning-formation involving the search for an order and an identity that had been profoundly shaken by the Second World War.\n\nSection one of this article sketches a brief history of the Abendland from the French Revolution to the post-First World War period. Sections two to five deal with the term's re-semantisation after 1945 and explores how the Abendland combined and interacted, at times conflictually, with other sources of Christian Democracy's political culture. Section six elaborates on the Cold War and the anti-communism of Christian Democracy – thus foregrounding how the Abendland influenced European self-understanding of early Cold War politics. The conclusion offers remarks on the symbolic meaning of the Abendland in post-war Europe and highlights the relevance and significance of the Abendland not only in historical discourse but also in current debate about European integration.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs this article has attempted to show, the Abendland imagined in the 1920s by a group of German-Catholic intellectuals was a social organism in gestation, generating symbols and meanings that remained alive in representations, discursive patterns and political symbolism. It was a murky, open-ended and polysemic concept that, in post-Second World War Europe, collected those aspects of the Christian-Catholic-Western heritage that could plausibly be freed from a link to authoritarianism and be combined with liberal-democratic values and principles. This re-articulation and re-adaptation of the Abendland was only possible because Europeans had gone through a critical juncture in history. In principle, the Abendland was not a ready-made symbol that could be exploited by Christian Democrats in the post-war period without risk. In fact, it was a potentially polluted and polluting symbol, whose ideological nucleus, its boldest language and imagery contained anti-liberal and reactionary features.\n\nIn the context of Christian Democratic Europeanism the Abendland symbolised the desire to reformulate the appropriate relationship between individual, society and political power – a relationship that required a high level of modification since conventional identity and culture, traditional beliefs and worldviews had been shaken by the experience of the Second World War. How were Europeans to make sense of their recent past and how were they to define themselves as a culture and as a people in the present?\n\nThe construction of a new political cultural identity attained a special urgency in post-war Europe. The Second World War had been a social revolution and a series of civil wars. The propagation of warfare into society pitting neighbours against neighbours uprooted customary life through forced expulsion, mass genocide, material devastation and the violation of territorial boundaries. Torn by these pressures, the legal framework of the nations evaporated. The life of civilians became a front-line experience, destroying patterns of trust and social consensus and undermining beliefs in elites and political authority. From this condition emerged a situation of unprecedented uncertainty and disorientation that destroyed the symbolic universes of individuals and societies. In addition to this, international alliances were not the same in 1950 or in 1947 as they had been in 1945, and these differed substantially from those in 1940 or in 1938. In the absence of a peace treaty, the war lost its original meaning as a struggle between Germany and the Allies.\n\nThe search for a moral purpose of society and the construction of an ideological framework of authority through ‘Europe/Abendland’ helped assuage the deep uncertainty of the period. The main threat to (Western) Europe was not an imminent Soviet attack but the poor condition of the economy, the resulting social and political instability and the existential crisis that followed the war. With the idea of Europe – soon to become equivalent to the West, democracy and freedom – Christian Democracy armed anxious populations with the symbols and markers of certainty. In the context of the Cold War, the Abendland image of the communist-Asiatic barbarian offered ‘patriotic’ Europeans a sense of clarity and stability by providing a coherent vision of the battles to be fought and the enemies to be vanquished. The Soviet Union represented the indispensable ‘other’ necessary to achieve full identity, an identity whose coalescence had been stalled when the anti-fascist alliance against the common enemy had broken apart. The Soviet threat served as a straw man, or as the oppositional marker of certainty around which a new identity could be constructed.\n\nIn a situation where the old markers of certainty had dissolved, and the durability of European political community seemed tenuous, the redefinition of a new political and cultural identity provided reassurance. The search for roots in the past countered the uncertainty of the present. Through its invocation of tacit knowledge and its use of familiar symbols deeply rooted in the grammar of the Abendland, ‘Europe’ helped to craft a new narrative that made sense of the turbulent world Europeans now faced and, more importantly, provided a road map that would enable them to escape their tragic history and enter a new world.\n\nFast forward to the present. The age of Christian Democracy, the thirty years after the Second World War that constituted its heyday as a political force in much of Western Europe, has ended. The Soviet collapse and the letting loose of what in bad metaphorical language were called its satellites has called into question once again where Europe begins and what it may mean, wreaking havoc on, among other things, the Christian Democratic Franco-German project of making Europe tantamount to a judiciously expanded version of the European Union. Meanwhile, Central Europe, long since thought vanished, has reappeared, perhaps to allow former Eastern Europeans to rid themselves of a perceived stigma. What is ‘West’, ‘East’ and, above all, ‘European’ is no longer clear. Once again, the Abendland has been altogether more successful. It has survived Christian Democracy and the Cold War and still slumbers at the bottom of European cultural self-understanding. It functions as a condition of possibility for the definition of ‘Europe’ through an ‘other’: Islam (Turkey), neo-liberalism (the United States), extra-communitarians (i.e, those who do not belong to the imagined community), refugees (liminal figures cast beyond a juridical state of exception) and post-Soviet Russia. And this marks it as a more or less successfully imagined community. The temptation remains to invoke Europe's incompatibility with the ‘non-European’ and to recreate new symbolic borders which seem, in a continent that increasingly does not belong to a specific people, all the more problematic."
