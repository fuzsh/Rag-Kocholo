        "text": "Template:Politics of San Marino San Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed with the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Great and General Council. In 1243, the first two Captains Regent were nominated by the Council. This method of nomination is still in use today, as of 2004.\n\nContents\n\n1.1 The Grand and General Council (Consiglio Grande e Generale)\n\n1.2 Parliament and Chamber\n\n2.1 The Captains Regent\n\n2.2 The State Congress\n\n3.1 The Council of Twelve (Consiglio dei XII)\n\n3.2 Judicial organization\n\nLegislative bodies\n\nThe Grand and General Council (Consiglio Grande e Generale)\n\nThe Council is composed of 60 members who are elected every 5 years under a proportional representation system in all nine administrative districts. These districts (Townships) correspond to the old parishes of the Republic, and each one is ruled by a Council which is chaired by a Captain elected every 5 years. The Grand and General Council approves the budget as well as the nominations of Captains Regent and heads of the Executive.\n\nParliament and Chamber\n\nThe Legislative body consists of the Great and General Council, the parliament, and a unicameral Chamber. The members of parliament are usually elected every 5 years and they are in charge of legislation, justice, and the administration of jurisdiction. In addition, they are tasked with electing the Captains Regent, the State Congress, the Council of Twelve, the Advising Commission, and the Government Unions once the Council nominates them. Parliament also has the power to ratify contracts with other countries. The parliament is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of 15 councils which examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on there way to being submitted to the Great and General Council.\n\nExecutive bodies\n\nThe Captains Regent\n\nEvery 6 months, the Council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The Regents are chosen from opposing parties so they can keep an eye on each other. They serve a 6-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on April 1 and October 1 in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have 3 days in which to file complaints about the Regents' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\nThe practice of dual heads of government, as well as the frequent re-election of same, are derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The Council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the Captains Regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome.\n\nThe State Congress\n\nThe State Congress, composed of 10 Secretaries, wields executive power. The 10 Secretaries are:\n\nSecretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs\n\nSecretary of State for Internal Affairs and Civil Defense,\n\nSecretary of State for Finance, Budget and Programming, Information and Relations with the State Philatelic and Numismatic Office\n\nSecretary of State for Education, Culture, University and Justice\n\nSecretary of State for Territory, Environment and Agriculture\n\nSecretary of State for Health and Social Security\n\nSecretary of State for Trade and Relations with the Town Council\n\nSecretary of State for Communication, Transport, Relations with the Azienda Autonoma di Stato for Services, Tourism and Sport\n\nSecretary of State for Industry and Crafts\n\nSecretary of State for Labour and Cooperation.\n\nJudicial bodies\n\nThe Council of Twelve (Consiglio dei XII)\n\nThe Council of Twelve is elected by the Great and General Council for the duration of the Legislature and serves a jurisdictional body that also acts as a third instance Court of Appeals. Two government inspectors represent the State in financial and patrimonial questions.\n\nJudicial organization\n\nThe judicial system of San Marino is entrusted to foreign executives, both for historical and social reasons. The only native judges are the Justices of the Peace, who only handle civil cases where sums involved do not exceed i£25,000,000 ITL (slightly less than €13,000). The Council of Twelve serves as an appeals court in the third instance.\n\nPolitical parties\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. The three main parties are the Democratic Christian Party of San Marino (PDCS), the Socialist Party of San Marino (PSS), and the Progressive Democratic Party of San Marino (PPDS) in addition to several other smaller parties. Due to the small size of San Marino and its low population, it is difficult for any party to gain a pure majority and most of the time the government is run by a coalition. As a result of the June 2001 election, the PDCS and PSS control a majority of seats in the Council.\n\nBecause tourism accounts for more than 50% of the economic sector, the government relies not only on taxes and customs for revenue, but also the sale of coins and postage stamps to collectors throughout the world. In addition, the Italian Government pays San Marino an annual budget subsidy provided under the terms of the Basic Treaty with Italy.\n\nSee also: List of political parties in San Marino\n\nCurrent issues\n\nThe main issues confronting the current government include economic and administrative problems related to San Marino's status as a close financial and trading partner with Italy while at the same time remaining separated from the European Union (EU). The other priority issue will be to increase the transparency and efficiency in parliament and in relations among parliament, cabinet, and the Captains Regent.\n\nVital data\n\nFrom the CIA World Factbook.\n\nCountry name:\n\nconventional long form: Republic of San Marino\n\nconventional short form: San Marino\n\nlocal long form: Repubblica di San Marino (RSM)\n\nlocal short form: San Marino\n\nData code: SM\n\nGovernment type: republic\n\nCapital: San Marino\n\nAdministrative divisions: 9 municipalities (castelli, singular - castello); Acquaviva, Borgo Maggiore, Chiesanuova, Domagnano, Faetano, Fiorentino, Monte Giardino, San Marino, Serravalle\n\nIndependence: 301 (by tradition)\n\nNational holiday: Anniversary of the Foundation of the Republic, September 3, (301)\n\nConstitution: October 8, 1600; electoral law of 1926 serves some of the functions of a constitution\n\nLegal system: based on civil law system with Italian law influences; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction\n\nSuffrage: 18 years of age; universal\n\nExecutive branch:\n\nhead of state and head of government: Two Captains Regent for a term of six months starting 1 April or 1 October.
