        "text": "This joint effort will harness PacBio’s state-of-the-art HiFi sequencing technology to offer profound insights into genetic diversity, disease mechanisms, and clinical diagnoses within Singapore’s multi-ethnic population\n\nSINGAPORE, Aug. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — PacBio (NASDAQ: PACB), a leading developer of high-quality, highly accurate sequencing solutions, announced that Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) has chosen the Revio HiFi sequencing system for its Long-Read Sequencing Flagship Project. This initiative aims to generate the largest long-read sequencing dataset in Southeast Asia, marking a significant advancement for precision medicine in Singapore.\n\nAs part of Singapore’s three-phase National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme, the current phase of the NPM aims to transform healthcare in Singapore and improve patient outcomes through new insights into the Asian genome. Hence, this collaboration will harness PacBio’s state-of-the-art HiFi sequencing technology to offer profound insights into genetic diversity, disease mechanisms, and clinical diagnoses within Singapore’s multi-ethnic population.\n\nThis partnership highlights the critical role of PacBio’s HiFi sequencing technology in advancing precision medicine. Beyond the capabilities of traditional short-read sequencing technologies, PacBio’s long-read sequencing provides comprehensive genomic coverage, enabling the detection of large structural variations and DNA methylation, providing a more complete picture of the genome. This multi-omics approach, combining whole genome sequencing (WGS), RNA full-length sequencing, fibre sequencing, and methylation analysis, positions PacBio as an essential contributor to the success of this joint effort with PRECISE.\n\n“I am delighted that PRECISE has selected our Revio system for their extensive, flagship long-read sequencing project in Singapore,” said Christian Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer of PacBio. “PRECISE chose PacBio HiFi technology for its capacity to deliver complete and accurate genomes. This project exemplifies Revio’s unique ability to provide differentiated solutions for large-scale, multi-thousand-sample, whole genome sequencing projects.”\n\nPacBio’s joint effort with PRECISE is set to elevate precision medicine in Singapore, leveraging highly-accurate long-read sequencing to drive scientific breakthroughs and enhance clinical outcomes. Through significant product contributions, investment in local expertise, and a comprehensive data platform, PacBio is dedicated to the success of this transformative initiative.\n\nKey highlights of the partnership\n\nComprehensive Long-Read Genomic Data\n\nPacBio will generate high-quality phased methylome and genomic information for a multi-thousand-sample whole genomes sequencing project, including:\n\n60x HiFi depth for Pan-Asian reference genomes.\n\n20x HiFi depth for multi-omics analysis.\n\n30x HiFi depth for unresolved and research cases in cancer and rare diseases.\n\nAdvanced Sequencing Infrastructure\n\nPacBio will establish advanced sequencing and data analysis pipelines in Singapore, including a centralised library preparation facility and sequencing laboratory for high throughput production.\n\nAppointed Service Provider\n\nMacrogen Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, the first CAP-accredited service provider in Singapore for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), will execute the PacBio long-read sequencing production.\n\nData Integration and Secure Access\n\nPacBio will utilise AWS cloud storage and workflow capabilities to ensure secure and efficient data processing and delivery for PRECISE researchers and clinicians.\n\nThe comprehensive efforts outlined in this partnership underscore the commitment of both PacBio and PRECISE to pioneering advancements in genomic research and precision medicine. By combining cutting-edge technology, extensive genomic data, and dedicated local expertise, this joint effort is poised to deliver ground breaking discoveries that can help shape the future of healthcare in Singapore and beyond.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nContacts (PacBio)\n\nInvestors:\n\nTodd Friedman\n\nir@pacificbiosciences.com\n\nMedia:\n\npr@pacificbiosciences.com\n\nContacts (Macrogen)\n\nMedia:\n\nchloeje@macrogen.com\n\nAbout PacBio\n\nPacBio (NASDAQ: PACB) is a premier life science technology company that designs, develops, and manufactures advanced sequencing solutions to help scientists and clinical researchers resolve genetically complex problems.

In NPM Phase II, PRECISE will collaborate with Singapore research and clinical partners, including the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, National Healthcare Group, National University Health System, National University of Singapore, and SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre to study the genetic makeup of 100,000 healthy Singaporeans and specific patient cohorts. The genetic data will be integrated with detailed lifestyle, environmental, and clinical data to yield rich insights into factors that contribute to Asian diseases and conditions.\n\nAdditionally, NPM Phase II will enhance the breadth and depth of the Precision Medicine-related industry by attracting and anchoring overseas companies in Singapore, while yielding new opportunities for home-grown companies. To enhance and accelerate the precision medicine sector, PRECISE works in close collaboration with A*STAR, the Biomedical Sciences Industry Partnership Office, and the Economic Development Board to catalyse the next phase of growth for Singapore’s healthcare and the biomedical technology industries.\n\nPRECISE is a programme of the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS). PRECISE is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF) under the RIE2020 White Space (MOH-000588 and MOH-001264) and administered by the Singapore Ministry of Health through the National Medical Research Council (NMRC) Office, MOH Holdings Pte Ltd.\n\nFor more information, visit www.npm.sg\n\nAbout Macrogen\n\nMacrogen provides genomics services for research use, as well as clinical diagnostics worldwide, with laboratories in six countries and more than 18,000 customers in 153 countries.
