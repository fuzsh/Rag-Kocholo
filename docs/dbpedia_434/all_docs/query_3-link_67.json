        "text": "üìù Our Council is currently reviewing how our local communities are represented. This is called a Representation Review and it will come into effect for our October 2025 local body elections. We are keen to hear from our communities to understand how you feel about some key parts of Council‚Äôs structure. The survey is open until this Sunday, 31 March https://lnkd.in/g-WPYJM4 üìù Why is this happening now? At its 31 October 2023 meeting, our Council unanimously voted to establish one or more MƒÅori Wards for the 2025 Local Elections. This is what has triggered the representation review process, to make sure our communities are fairly and effectively represented at Council. The review does not revisit the decision to establish MƒÅori Wards. üìù How can you have your say? We are running a community survey to help us understand how our communities feel about key aspects of our current representation structure. Your feedback will help to inform our proposal, which will go out for formal consultation later this year. The survey will be open until Sunday March 31 2024. Everyone who completes the survey can also go in the draw to win one of two $100 Prezzy Cards.

The libraries also have computers for you to use to access the webpage and survey: https://lnkd.in/gBerAKjs If you have any questions, feel free to email repreview@tcdc.govt.nz or call our team on 07 868 0200.\n\nThe Power of Your Vote: Why Local and Mayoral Elections Matter On 2 May there will be: Local government elections in England Local authority mayoral elections Combined authority mayoral elections Police and Crime Commissioner elections Greater London Authority elections. A sixth of England's district, borough and unitary councils will be involved. Councillors can play an important role in the planning process. They can provide a point of contact between the public and the officers. This can be especially important at a time when planning departments themselves are under-staffed and under-resourced. As a solicitor specialising in planning law, I often advise clients to speak to their ward councillors and / or to Council planning committee members to help to get clarity on the way that decisions are made. For example, I have recently advised a client about planning a potential enforcement problem, with the local ward councillor helping to resolve a dispute. Another matter was in relation to a development proposal in a conservation area, where the local councillor liaised with the Council‚Äôs conservation officer to ensure that my client‚Äôs concerns were taken seriously. Whatever your political persuasion, therefore, I believe that participation always matters. Please consider the power of your vote and make your voice heard tomorrow. #localelections #2May2024 #planningsolicitor #London\n\nüö® Local Elections 2024 üö® Some huge results announced over the course of today, including some big news regarding mayors! Whether it be smaller councils, or the major mayoral authorities, many people feel that the results announced today ‚Äì and over the coming days ‚Äì could set the tone for the next General Election. Of the eleven mayors that were to be elected, only the four currently mentioned have been announced at the time of writing. The weekend will bring the announcement of the results in areas such as Liverpool, Manchester, the East Midlands and, of course, London. https://lnkd.in/eCbnYMHk What does this mean for the future?
