This is one of my favorite videos showing Sacramento Kings former player Metta World Peace going up against the Utah Jazz. Things were always crazy between these two teams; with Chris Webber trying to thug it up, Scott Pollard being Scott Pollard, and now today with DeMarcus Cousins putting out a bounty against all of our point guards . . . and getting ejected in our most recent game.

I can only expect things to be crazy again tonight. Plus: Jimmer Fredette.
