        "text": "World Peace, formerly Ron Artest, is 36 now. He laments that if not for his outbursts he could have been in the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe's known for the brawl. And he knows that he's known for that brawl. And for flagrant fouls. And for dysfunctional locker room behavior.\n\nFormer Indiana Pacers player Metta World Peace (Ron Artest until Sept. 2011 when he legally changed his name) has been speaking out lately -- lamenting an \"unstable\" past that he says destroyed his chances at being legendary for on-the-court successes.\n\n\"I could've been in the Hall of Fame,\" he told ESPN this week, \"if I would've been a more stable player.\"\n\nWorld Peace, 36, and back this season with the Los Angeles Lakers after two years overseas, told ESPN he wishes he had been able to play his entire career for the Pacers or any other NBA team for that matter. He played for Indiana from 2002 to 2006.\n\nAnd during his stint with the team, he earned a reputation as one of the league's standout defenders, winning the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2004.\n\nHe was also named an NBA All-Star and earned All-NBA honors. Offensively, he wasn't too shabby either, averaging 24.6 points with the Pacers in 2004-05.\n\nBut then the brawl happened. It's been 11 years Thursday since the NBA's most infamous scuffle, during which World Peace charged into the stands in Auburn Hills, Mich., after a cup was hurled from the stands. An altercation ensued with fans, as well as a fight between the Pacers and the Detroit Pistons. The incident has been dubbed \"Malice at the Palace.\"\n\nThen-NBA commissioner David Stern suspended World Peace for the remainder of the 2004-05 season and disciplined eight other players on the Pacers and Pistons teams. World Peace missed 86 games, the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history.\n\nIt was just one in a string of volatile outbursts World Peace is known for and his antics bounced him from team to team. World Peace has played for six in all, including the Chicago Bulls (1999-2002), Pacers, Sacramento Kings (2006-08), Houston Rockets (2008-09) Lakers (2009-13 and back this season) and New York Knicks (2013-14).\n\n\"I had to play on other people's teams so my average went down, my stats went down, less All-Stars, less All-Defensive teams,\" World Peace told ESPN.\n\nTake a look at World Peace's more notable outbursts, according to the Associated Press.\n\nJune 13, 2001: Playing for the Bulls, World Peace broke two of Michael Jordan's ribs during a pickup game. At the time, he told the media he wasn't sure what happened.\n\n2002-2003: Playing for the Pacers, he was suspended several times, including: Three games for smashing video equipment at Madison Square Garden, four games for a confrontation with Pat Riley and one game for smashing a framed picture of himself at Conseco Fieldhouse, now Bankers Life. He was also fined $20,000 for making an obsense gesture to the crowd at a game in Cleveland.\n\nJune 1, 2004: Called for a flagrant foul after taking a shot at Richard Hamilton's masked face during Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nApril 22, 2012: World Peace elbowed the Thunder's James Harden in the head while celebrating a dunk as a Laker, receiving a flagrant foul and getting ejected from the game."
