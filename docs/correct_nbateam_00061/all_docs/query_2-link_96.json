        "text": "The tone in Metta World Peace’s voice hardly harkened back memories of his infamous press conference after the Lakers won Game 7 of the 2010 NBA championship.\n\nThen, the former Ron Artest thanked his psychologist and expressed gratitude that Kobe Bryant passed him the ball that set up a critical 3-pointer in a performance that forever cast him in Lakers lore. This time, World Peace sounded fairly even-keel for the Lakers signing him to a one-year, non-guaranteed deal worth $1.5 million for the 2015-16 season.\n\n“It was cool. It was a great feeling,” World Peace said Sunday night in a phone interview with Los Angeles News Group. “But everything has been normal.”\n\nWill that change on Monday?\n\nThe Lakers’ media day setting would appear to tap into World Peace’s wheelhouse, the throngs of reporters and cameramen likely leading the Lakers forward to show off his eccentric personality. Yet, the Lakers’ 35-year-old also maintained he will hardly offer any goofy quotes or bulletin board material that once amused reporters, teammates and team officials alike.\n\n“I don’t have anymore jokes,” World Peace said, laughing. “I said them all when I was here. I have writer’s block.”\n\nHence, World Peace hardly sounded interested in just providing entertainment during a possible rebuilding season after the Lakers finished last season with a 21-61 record, the franchise’s worst mark in its 67-year-old history. Instead, World Peace sounded interested in perfecting a role that explains why the Lakers appeared eager for a reunion, even if it just lasts through training camp.\n\nThe Lakers hope World Peace can help develop the Lakers’ crop of young players, touching on his experience as the 2004 Defensive Player of the Year, an occasional offensive threat and his heroics in the 2010 NBA Finals. World Peace helped coach the Palisades Charter High School girls basketball team last year, a stint he plans to maintain through informal contact this season. And World Peace frequently worked out at the Lakers’ facility this summer with forward Julius Randle.\n\n“I was always an intelligent player and very good on defense,” World Peace said. “I have seen every offensive play. People tried to run me through screens, get me off the ball, keep me off their man and keep me from stealing the ball. I’ve seen everything.”\n\nWorld Peace sounded aware of the irony surrounding his 17-year NBA career. He’s still most remembered for serving an 86-game suspension with the Indiana Pacers in 2004 for punching a fan in the stands after he threw a drink at him. He has since rebuilt his image, winning the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 2011 for his continuous help in raising funds and awareness for mental health charities.\n\nBut even with the Lakers, World Peace faced scrutiny over his understanding of Phil Jackson’s triangle offense, his shot selection and erratic fast breaks. World Peace also served a seven-game suspension in 2012 for inadvertently elbowing former Oklahoma City guard James Harden, which gave him a concussion.\n\nYet, World Peace recalled Indiana and current Dallas coach Rick Carlisle predicted, “I would be a great coach someday.”\n\nWorld Peace plans to draw on all the qualities he admired with former teammates and coaches, including Reggie Miller’s professionalism, Carlisle’s X’s and O’s, Jackson’s patience, Rick Adelman’s simplicity, Fran Fraschilla’s drills as well as defensive schemes from Mike Brown and Tim Floyd.\n\nWorld Peace lumped Bryant and Derek Fisher in different categories after once seeing them operate as Lakers’ co-captains.\n\n“Kobe and Fisher, those two guys to me are equal,” World Peace said. “I can never separate those two. What I’ve seen both of those guys do is pretty super heroish. Every time I try to separate them, I can’t. They taught me so much about heart and things you can’t put a stat on.”\n\nWorld Peace could now serve Fisher’s role in nurturing teammates while Bryant offers a more stern approach.\n\n“I can never be Derek. But I know I can be myself,” World Peace said. “Me and Kobe are similar as far as competitive natures. He’s still competitive and I’m still competitive. But I’m more taking a mentorship role this year. I’m direct, but I’m not going to give you a spoon full of whipped cream. I’m definitely intense. But I’m really into encouragement.”\n\nWorld Peace did not feel that way in his previous last chapter with the Lakers.\n\nThey waived World Peace in 2013 through the amnesty provision despite averaging 12.8 points on 40.5 percent shooting in the 2012-13 season, his highest scoring output in four seasons with the Lakers. The cost-cutting measure saved the Lakers nearly $30 million in combined salary and luxury taxes. World Peace refused to begrudge the Lakers.\n\n“I felt a little bit of a failure because I didn’t get title No. 2,” World Peace said. “I thought we’d get No. 2, but it never happened. The only thing I focused on was not getting No. 2. That really frustrated me.”\n\nWorld Peace also became frustrated with his own decision-making on how he handled his body. He admitted “it was stupid of me” to return in April 2013 to help the Lakers’ unsuccessful playoff run, only 12 days after tearing torn cartilage in his left knee. He faced similar issues the following season with the New York Knicks before they eventually negotiated a buyout.\n\n“That set me back a long time,” said World Peace, who spent the last year playing overseas in China and Italy. “I wasn’t able to function. It took me a while to get my body back right. But this summer has been great for me.”\n\nWorld Peace frequently worked out at both the Lakers’ and Clippers’ practice facilities. He trained privately at a local Equinox. And World Peace played pickup basketball games at the Drew League, UCLA and in New York. That work enabled World Peace to currently weigh between 252-255 pounds without any concerns surrounding his conditioning and health. He also dismissed any preference about playing time either at small or power forward.\n\n“I stayed in such good shape and am still able to play the game at a very high level,” World Peace said. “I think when certain people will play me, they will be surprised I can still play.”\n\nWorld Peace predicted the Lakers will offer other surprises.\n\nHe expressed optimism about Bryant’s 20th and possibly last NBA season despite playing a combined 41 games in the last two years amid consecutive season-ending injuries to his left Achilles tendon, left knee and right shoulder.\n\n“Kobe’s going to play great this year,” World Peace said. “He’s going to be in the hunt for the playoffs.”\n\nReally?\n\n“We have enough players where we can improve and shock a lot of people this year and even go beyond the first round of the playoffs,” World Peace argued. “But it just depends on the effort we put in mentally.”\n\nIt also depends on if the Lakers can improve their defensive efficiency after ranking 29th out of 30 NBA teams last season in that category. World Peace attributed the Lakers missing an NBA-record 324 games last year because of injuries. He predicted the Lakers will become “very good” on defense, but declined to address how that will happen.\n\n“Defense is easy,” World Peace said. “But I don’t want to say what I want to say because I have different strategies in my mind that I don’t want to say publicly. I don’t want to help the other teams and players out.”\n\nInstead, World Peace has passed up two undisclosed overseas offers to help out the Lakers.\n\nSaid World Peace: “I’ll enjoy the process of working hard and keeping it simple.”"
