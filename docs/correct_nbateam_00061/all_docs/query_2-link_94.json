        "text": "The NBA is likely to hand down a severe penalty this week after Metta World Peace delivered a elbow to the head of Oklahoma City's James Harden -- an ugly outburst from the NBA's 2011 Citizenship Award winner in the Lakers' thrilling comeback victory Sunday at Staples Center.\n\nQuestion: Should World Peace Be Penalized?\n\nPeace hammered Harden on the side of the head as he celebrated a fastbreak dunk near the end of the first half. He called the blow \"unintentional\" in a post-game interview.\n\n\"I just watched the replay again,\" Peace tweeted Sunday evening. \"Oooo.. My celebration of the dunk really was too much... Didn't even see James..... Omg... Looks bad.\"\n\nThe \"celebration\" included the wildly popular fist-pound to the chest coupled with a flying left elbow that caught Harden square on the left side of his head. Harden, out of Artesia High School, collapsed to the floor holding his head, and World Peace continued pounding his chest as he headed down the court before turning to confront Harden's teammates.\n\n\"Hope James Hardin (sic) is ok... I remember when I hit by Marc Gasol the same way.. I was spitting up blood and a headache during the game,\" World Peace tweeted.\n\nThe Thunder did not immediately announce whether Harden suffered a concussion.\n\nWorld Peace was ejected from the game, and he is likely to face a suspension that might be announced Monday.\n\nWatch: Metta World Peace's Ejection\n\nWorld Peace, he changed his name from Ron Artest last year, had just started to make significant contributions during the late season. The elbow marked a turn for the worse in a career that has included outbursts, the most disgraceful of which occurred in November 2004 when he charged into the stands to join a brawl at the Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\nThat led to an 86-game suspension for Artest, then a member of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nSports\n\nGet today's sports news out of Los Angeles. Here's the latest on the Dodgers, Lakers, Angels, Kings, Galaxy, LAFC, USC, UCLA and more LA teams.\n\nBut World Peace's behavior improved during the past three seasons. He won the NBA's Citizenship Award last year award for his charity work and the attention he brought to mental-health issues.\n\nThe Professional Basketball Writer's Association presents the award. It honors outstanding service to the community.\n\nThe vicious elbow marred what was an otherwise well-played and entertaining game with a playoff-like atmosphere. Kobe Bryant scored six of his 26 points in the second overtime as the Lakers came back from an 18-point second-half deficit to defeat the team with the Western Conference's second-best record.\n\n\"It's not so much that we beat Oklahoma, but how we did it,'' said Bryant. \"In the playoffs, particularly if you don't have home-court advantage, you're going to have games like this. We have to have the poise and the confidence to just keep chipping away.''\n\nThe Lakers struggled after World Peace's ejection at the end of the first half, scoring just 14 points in the next 14 minutes. But the team used a hodge-podge lineup of starters and seldom-used bench players to storm back."
