        "text": "I’ve had a few athletes clapback at me on Twitter, question my opinions and engage in friendly banter.\n\nSo it was nice to hear from one of my favorite former Kings, Doug Christie, when I tweeted out the idea of my All-Time Sacramento Kings team. It truly was a rough draft of a 12-man team from Sacramento’s 35 years in California after relocating from Kansas City.\n\nMany fans didn’t like that Christie wasn’t on the list and he reminded me defense matters — essentially making his case for his inclusion — the same reason many believe he is one of the best players of the Sacramento era.\n\nSo thanks for the reminder, Doug. I know defense matters.\n\nThe easy thing to do would be to take most of the 2001-02 team, add Mitch Richmond and a couple others to it, and be done with it. It’s hard to argue with the most successful team in franchise history dominating the list, right?\n\nBut how is that fair to DeMarcus Cousins? He became one of the NBA’s most dominant big men amid chaotic conditions, so is he solely to blame for the lack of team success. Or Richmond, an All-NBA caliber guard stuck on below-average teams?\n\nThere’s no right way to figure this out, but I take a shot at it. NBA rosters have 15 players these days, and two guys on two-way contracts.\n\nThat would be 17 players, but I stuck with 15.\n\nLet the debates begin.\n\nAll-Time Sacramento Kings Team\n\nStarters\n\nPG — Mike Bibby\n\nSG — Mitch Richmond\n\nSF — Peja Stojakovic\n\nPF — Chris Webber\n\nC — DeMarcus Cousins\n\nBench\n\nDoug Christie\n\nVlade Divac\n\nRudy Gay\n\nBobby Jackson\n\nKevin Martin\n\nBrad Miller\n\nMetta World Peace (Ron Artest)\n\nLionel Simmons\n\nReggie Theus\n\nWayman Tisdale\n\nCoach: Rick Adelman\n\nStarters\n\nMike Bibby, guard\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSeven seasons: 17.6 points, 5.4 assists, 3.2 rebounds, 42.9 win shares\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFirst in assists (2,580), third in 3s made (775), fourth in steals (476)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nBibby’s arrival is when the Kings went from a good team to their ascension to a title contender. The Kings traded fan favorite Jason Williams to Vancouver for Bibby before the 2001-02 season, and Bibby was a key cog in helping the Kings reach the 2002 Western Conference Finals.\n\nBibby had been a winner before, leading Arizona to the 1997 NCAA Championship and his addition to the Kings proved to be steadying on a team that had as many as three All-Stars at a given time.\n\nHe’s one of the most clutch players the Kings have had, most notably hitting the game-winning shot to beat the Lakers in Game 5 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals.\n\nMitch Richmond, guard\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSeven seasons: 23.2 points, 4.1 assists, 3.7 rebounds, 50.4 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nFirst Sacramento-era player inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame; six-time All-Star (1993, ’94, ’95, ’96, ’97, ’98); All-NBA Second Team (1994, ’95, ’97); All-NBA Third Team (1996, ’98); All-Star Game MVP (1995); Kings’ retired his No. 2 in Dec. 2003\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFirst in points (12,070), free throws made (2,617), field goals made (4,230); second in assists (2,128); 3s made (993); steals (670)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nRichmond, known as “Rock,” was the pillar of the fledgling franchise most of the 1990s, becoming one of the NBA’s best shooting guards. The only reason Richmond isn’t more revered nationally is because he spent his best years in Sacramento.\n\nNot many guards combined Richmond’s scoring punch with the ability to impact the game on defense, which is why he is one of the best to ever play the game. The Kings acquired Richmond from Golden State in a trade in Nov. 1991, becoming the first star of the Sacramento era, but many still associate him with his Run TMC days with the Warriors. Richmond eventually won a championship as a reserve with the 2002 Lakers.\n\nThe Kings made it to the playoffs just once (1995-’96) in Richmond’s time in Sacramento, facing the heavily-favored Seattle SuperSonics, led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp. The Kings lost the first-round series, but Richmond put on a show in an upset in Game 2.\n\nPeja Stojakovic, forward\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nEight seasons: 18.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 59.8 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nThree-time All-Star (2002, ’03, ’04) ; All-NBA Second Team (2004); NBA 3-point champion (2002, ’03); Kings retired his No. 16 in Dec. 2014\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFirst in 3s made (1,070), free throw percentage (.893), third in points (9,498)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nA lethal 3-point shooter who would have flourished in today’s game. Stojakovic was an ultimate floor spacer with the size (6-foot-10) to shoot over the defense and gave the Kings one of the most formidable frontcourts of the early 2000s. Stojakovic was a 39.8 percent 3-point shooter and was one of the keys in making Sacramento’s offense one of the most fun to watch in the NBA. Not bad for a guy who was met with a collective “Who is this guy?” when the Kings drafted him 14th overall in 1996. Stojakovic won a championship in 2011 with Dallas.\n\nChris Webber, forward\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSeven seasons: 23.1 points, 10.1 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 45.5 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nFour-time All-Star (2000, ’01, ’02, ’03); All-NBA First Team (2001); All-NBA Second Team (1999, 2002, ’03); All-NBA Third Team (2000); NBA rebounding leader (1999); Kings retired his No. 4 in Feb. 2009\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFourth in points (8,843), second in rebounds (4,006), fifth in assists (1,791), third in blocks (553), most rebounds in a game in Sacramento era (26)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nThe Kings traded their first star, Richmond, to land their next star in Webber. He became the centerpiece of the best span of basketball in Sacramento history. Webber was a gifted scorer, rebounder and could set up his teammates, too.\n\nWebber was in the conversation with Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett as the best power forward in the league during his time in Sacramento. A knee injury during the 2003 NBA Playoffs ended what might have been the Kings’ best chance to win a championship and cost him nearly a year on the court. Things were never the same and Webber was traded to Philadelphia in Feb. 2005.\n\nThat doesn’t diminish what Webber did to help change the fortunes of the franchise. He was a transcendent star, who brought name recognition to a franchise in need of it.\n\nDeMarcus Cousins, center\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSeven seasons: 21.1 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 35.3 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nThree-time All-Star (2015, ’16, ’17), All-Rookie First Team (2011), All-NBA Second Team (2015, ’16)\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFirst in rebounds (5,056), second in points (9,894), second in blocks (558), third in steals (661), top two scoring games in Sacramento era (56 and 55)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nLike Richmond, Cousins became one of the best players in the NBA in a bad situation. There was coaching turnover, front office changes, multiple threats of relocation and eventually a change in ownership.\n\nStill Cousins became one of the NBA’s most dominant big men and helped usher in an era of bigs with more well-rounded games. He was loved by many because of his community work, but some didn’t like the emotion he showed. Still, Cousins was one of the best players in the league. The Kings never figured out how to build a team around Cousins and he was traded during the 2017 NBA All-Star Game to New Orleans.\n\nStill, by time Cousins is done, the argument can be made his jersey should be the next to be retired by the franchise. Being the face of a franchise that was constantly in turmoil was no easy task, yet Cousins still ascended to All-Star status.\n\nBench\n\nDoug Christie, guard\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nFive seasons: 10.6 points, 4.2 assists, 2.0 steals, 32.8 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nAll-Defense First Team (2003), All-Defense Second Team (2001, ’02, ’04)\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFirst in steals (717), eighth in assists (1,505).\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nOn a team known for scoring a lot of points, Christie emerged as one of the NBA’s better perimeter defenders. That meant going up against the likes of Kobe Bryant, Michael Finley, or Manu Ginobili in a loaded Western Conference. Christie also played a critical role on offense on those early 2000s squads, keeping the flow going in the pass-happy offense.\n\nVlade Divac, center\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSix seasons: 11.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 39.4 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, NBA All-Star (2001), J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award (2000), Kings retired No. 21 in March 2009\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFourth in rebounds (3,538), in blocks (523), sixth in assists (1,693), eighth in steals (453), ninth in points (5,176)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nDivac became the most impactful free agent to come to Sacramento when he signed in Jan. 1999. He became the glue of the early 2000 teams, bringing leadership and experience to the locker room. That also meant being the center at a time when Shaquille O’Neal dominated the league and taking the abuse that came with defending O’Neal. Divac is one of the best international players ever, and certainly one of the most revered Kings.\n\nRudy Gay, forward\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nFour seasons: 19.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 16.3 win shares\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nWas the scoring complement to Cousins, Gay’s last season in Sacramento was cut short by a ruptured Achilles tendon. The Kings had struggled to fill the small forward position after Artest’s departure and Gay became the replacement and gave the squad a player at the position who commanded the attention of the defense.\n\nBobby Jackson, guard\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSix seasons: 10.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 19.6 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nSixth Man of the Year (2003)\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nEighth-most made 3s in Sacramento-era (381).\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nIf you needed offense, energy and toughness off the bench, Jackson was your man. He averaged a career-high 15.2 points in winning Sixth Man of the Year. One of the great “what ifs” in Kings history will always be would Game 7 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals turned out differently if Jackson played more.\n\nKevin Martin, guard\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSix seasons: 17.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 30.8 win shares\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nThird in free throws made (1,791), sixth in 3s made (459), eighth in points (5,560).\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nMartin averaged 20-plus points in his last four seasons in Sacramento before being traded to Houston. A skilled scorer who was adept at getting to the free throw line. Martin, has four of the top-10 single scoring game records in Sacramento. That includes a career-high 50 points.\n\nBrad Miller, center\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSix seasons: 13.3 points, 8.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 39.5 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nAll-Star (2003-’04)\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFifth in rebounds (3,305), seventh in assists (1,542), eighth in blocks (353), 10th in points (5,117)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nA big man with a shooting touch, Miller came to the Kings from Indiana as Divac’s time in Sacramento was coming to an end. He fit what the Kings did on offense and kept the center position stable.\n\nMetta World Peace (Ron Artest), forward\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nThree seasons: 18.9 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 13.6 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nFirst Team All-Defense (2006)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nAcquired from Indiana for Stojakovic, Artest arrived in Jan. 2006, helping the Kings reach the playoffs, the last time the Kings have reached the postseason. There, Artest and the Kings helped put a scare into the favored San Antonio Spurs before losing the series, 4-2.\n\nOne of the best defenders of his generation, Artest would eventually win a championship with the Lakers in 2010.\n\nLionel Simmons, forward\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSeven seasons: 12.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 16.9 win shares\n\nSacramento-era accolades/awards\n\nAll-Rookie First Team (1991)\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nSeventh in points (5,833), rebounds (2,833), steals (514), blocks (361)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\n“L-Train” averaged 18.0 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.0 rebounds in finishing second to Derrick Coleman in Rookie of the Year voting in 1991. Injuries derailed what looked to be promising career. Simmons averaged no fewer than 15.1 points in his first four seasons, but was forced to retire early because injuries.\n\nOne can only imagine what might have happened if Richmond was paired with a healthy Simmons for his entire stint in Sacramento.\n\nReggie Theus, guard\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nThree seasons: 20.0 points, 8.3 assists, 3.4 rebounds, 16.3 win shares\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFourth in assists (1,943).\n\nTheus is the only Kansas City King to make the team. He played five total seasons with the franchise, the first two being in Kansas City before the team relocated. He was one of the NBA’s better scorers during his playing career.\n\nA former Kings coach, he averaged a career-high 9.6 assists in the team’s first season in Sacramento.\n\nWayman Tisdale, forward\n\nSacramento-era stats\n\nSix seasons: 18.8 points, 7.2 rebounds in six seasons, 24.9 win shares\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nSixth in points (6,808), eighth in rebounds (2,676), 10th in blocks (280)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nThe talented power forward was the running mate of Richmond, and Tisdale was also an accomplished jazz musician as a bass guitarist. Tisdale died in 2009 from a ruptured esophagus following radiation treatments for bone cancer in his right leg.\n\nRick Adelman, coach\n\nSacramento-era record: Eight seasons, 395-229\n\nWhere does he rank in Sacramento history?\n\nFirst in regular-season wins (395), playoff wins (34), playoff appearances (eight)\n\nWhy is he on the team?\n\nThe Kings made the playoffs in every season during Adelman’s tenure, reaching the Western Conference Finals in 2002. The Kings haven’t made the playoffs since, which pretty much explains why he’s the best coach Sacramento has seen.\n\nTough cuts\n\nTyreke Evans, guard\n\nThe 2010 Rookie of the Year, but nagging injuries led to a decline in production over his first four seasons with the Kings. He got healthy in New Orleans and was part of a playoff team.\n\nIsaiah Thomas, guard\n\nSpent three seasons with the Kings (2011-14) and was dealt in a sign-and-trade to Phoenix. He’d go on to become a two-time All-Star in Boston.\n\nJason Williams, guard\n\nBrought flashy play to Sacramento and remains a fan favorite, but there’s no denying that trading him for Bibby turned the Kings into title contenders.\n\nCorliss Williamson, forward\n\nNot many were tougher than “Big Nasty”, who averaged 17.7 points for the Kings in 1997-98. He played a total of eight seasons for the Kings and won Sixth Man of the Year with Detroit in 2001-02 and was part of the Pistons’ 2004 championship team.\n\n(Photo: Rocky Widner / NBAE via Getty Images)"
