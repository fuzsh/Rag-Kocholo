        "text": "Metta took some steps to bring World Peace on Wednesday by donating $285,000 to mental health charities across America. He has pledged to give away more than $500,000 that he raised by raffling off his 2010 Lakers championship ring. At the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live, before handing giant checks to six women who represented various organizations, World Peace briefly discussed his own struggles with mental health. “When I was a kid, I did see a counselor,” he said. “My mom helped me out, she realized I was having problems when I was 13 years old. She realized I was going through a lot.\n\nThe NBA star formerly known as Ron Artest was the first contestant bounced from “Dancing with the Stars” – but he has rebounded in a big way for his old neighborhood. The edgy and eccentric member of the LA Lakers, who grew up in the Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City, has donated more than $100,000 to charities in his former stomping grounds. The hard-nosed defender, who legally changed his name to Metta World Peace last Friday, gave $65,000 to Long Island City-based Steinway Child and Family Services and $55,000 to The Child Center of New York, based in nearby Woodside."
