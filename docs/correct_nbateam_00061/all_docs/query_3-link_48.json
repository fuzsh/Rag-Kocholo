As far as music goes, the last we heard of him was the August 2013 cut \"Peace\", which was produced by Lucky. Otherwise, he rode the subway to his first game with the Knicks in October 2013, and engaged in a particularly bizarre Twitter \"rant\" in January 2014. Stay tuned for the further adventures of Metta World Peace, y'all."
