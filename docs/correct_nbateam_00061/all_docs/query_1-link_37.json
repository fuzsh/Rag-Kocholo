But that hasn't stopped the former NBA star from checking out NBA action back home. The baller formerly known as Ron Artest took his new NBA fandom to a higher level Tuesday, when he tweeted out early NBA season awards. Now, when we say early, we mean no team has even played nine games yet, early. But that didn't stop Metta World Peace from handing out awards like he was the ESPYs. Here, BET.com chose the very best of World Peace's awards. Peace out (there)! (Photo: ChinaFotoPress/ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images) - Former NBA star hands out early season honors.",
