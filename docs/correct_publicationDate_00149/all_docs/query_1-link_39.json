        "text": "When the National Security Agency’s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage… not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it would cripple U.S. intelligence.\n\nI had some expectations for this book which it didn’t live up to. Ive seen a lot of people call this book “excellent techno-thriller” which really got me excited to read this book, which turns out to not be the truth.\n\nSometimes the technological digressions in this book is simply too much, and it pretty much hard to keep track of it and why things are happening because of it.\n\nThe beginning of this book was very good because it was very interesting and it was fun and interesting to figure out what was happening in this little chaotic beginning.\n\nHowever the longer you dive into this book the worse it becomes, because it quickly becomes boring and the entire plot revolves around a software program which really wasn’t something very exciting.\n\nAfter fishing this book, I noticed that all of the main characters in Dan Brown’s novel are very good looking, like a top model good looking. Which really should be answered by Dan Brown on why he does that.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters in this book, well there isn’t a lot to say about them. They are interesting at first but the more we get to know them, we notice that they are very shallow and not so bright if it isn’t a last minute knowledge illumination.\n\nAnother thing which annoyed me about the characters is that we get one woman and the rest of the recurring characters are men. We get 2 other female characters in this book which we only see for couple of pages. But the point is that this book is 99.8 % only men characters. And as you can expected all of the men characters in this book are running after the main character who is a female and trying to get to have sex with her more or less.\n\nThere are many times where the plot focuses more on the software program than on anything else. Which really annoyed me because I understand that, that software program is a big deal in this book but why not focus on the action or something else than only on the software program.\n\nThe writing style isn’t the best. Ive read one book from Dan Brown before going into this one, and well the writing style when it comes to Dan Brown or this book really don’t live to the fact that some people call him one of the greatest living authors."
