        "text": "After producing blockbusters The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, Brian Grazer and Ron Howard’s Imagine Entertainment is reteaming with best-selling author Dan Brown to adapt another one of his books, this time for the small screen. Thriller Digital Fortress, from Imagine TV and 20th Century Fox, where the company is based, has landed at ABC with a put pilot commitment. Additionally, Imagine TV and 20th TV, the companies behind Arrested Development, have set up a single-camera family comedy, also at ABC, with significant penalty attached.\n\nWritten by Josh Goldin and Rachel Abramowitz (Outlaw Country), Digital Fortress an international thriller set in the world of the NSA during a global threat. It’s described as a sexy cat-and-mouse game between a Snowden-esque character who is threatening to release all of the government’s secrets to the highest bidder and a female cryptographer and her elite team who are tasked to stop him. Teeming with double-crosses in matters of both national security and the heart, ultimately Digital Fortress begs the very real question: Who guards the guards? Goldin and Abramowitz executive produce with Brown and Imagine TV’s Grazer and Francie Calfo.\n\nRelated: 2014 ABC Pilots\n\nInspired by the book The Brainy Bunch: The Harding Family’s Method To College Ready By Age Twelve, Imagine’s comedy project follows an extraordinarily gifted family who find themselves unprepared for their new lives in Orange County, CA, a place where beauty is valued more than brains. Sisters Wendy and Lizzie Molyneux (Bob’s Burgers) are writing and will executive produce with Grazer and Calfo.\n\nDigital Fortress and the Molyneux sisters comedy mark two high-profile sales by 20th TV at an outside network as the studio is going through its first development season aligned with sibling Fox under Gary Newman and Dana Walden."
