But Tankadodid not want help—it was too late for that. Trembling, he raised his left hand and held his fingers outward.Look at my hand!

Susan bolted upright, sloshing water on the flooras she grappled for the receiver she’d left on the sink. “David?” “It’s Strathmore,” the voice replied.

Don’t ever lose him.” “Thank you, sir.” The commander’s voice turned suddenly stern. “Susan,I’m calling because I need you in here. Pronto.” She tried to focus. “It’s Saturday, sir. we don’tusually—” “I know,” he said calmly. “It’s anemergency.” Susan sat up. Emergency? She had never heard the wordcross Commander Strathmore’s lips. An emergency? InCrypto? She couldn’t imagine. “Y-yes, sir.” Shepaused. “I’ll be there as soon as I can.” “Make it sooner.” Strathmore hung up. * * * Susan Fletcher stood wrapped in a towel and dripped on theneatly folded clothes she’d set out the nightbefore—hiking shorts, a sweater for the cool mountainevenings, and the new lingerie she’d bought for the nights.Depressed, she went to her closet for a clean blouse and skirt.
