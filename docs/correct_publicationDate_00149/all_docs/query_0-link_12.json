Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.\n\n\"A new master of smart thrills.\"--People\n\n\"Digital Fortress is the best and most realistic techno-thriller to reach the market it years . . .
