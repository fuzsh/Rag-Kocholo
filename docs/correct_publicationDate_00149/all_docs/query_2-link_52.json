        "text": "Title: Digital Fortress\n\nAuthor: Dan Brown\n\nFirst published: 1998\n\nIn the beginning of this novel we get to know three characters: Susan Fletcher, the top-cryptographer in the NSA, David Becker, Susan’s fiancé and Commander Strathmore, the Cryptographer Director. Susan is called to the crypto-headquarters because of an emergency. The cryptographer’s job in the NSA is to decrypt various emails from the internet. The cryptographers got the most advanced super-computer in their possession: TRANSLTR, as it is called, is used to crack codes using the brute-force method. Apparently a man named Ensei Tankado has been able to create an algorithm that is unbreakable. David Becker is sent to Seville, Spain in order to obtain the pass-key for the algorithm. As it seems, Ensei Tankado died moments after he published the new algorithm. Of course, David Becker is not the only one trying to find the code. He is hunted down by several assassins trying to obtain the same pass-key. At the same time Susan and Strathmore is fighting a virus inside the TRANSLTR machine – it seems the algorithm was not an unbreakable code, but a fatal virus. The novel ends with David Becker obtaining the pass-key that stops the virus in order to save the main-database of the NSA. However, Strathmore and TRANSLTR go up in flames due to the virus.\n\nSince the book got several parallel stories, it’s hard to describe the setting and environment of the book as a whole. Instead I will describe the setting of the two main-stories which would be Susan’s story and David’s story. The book is written in the late 90s, but the story would fit 2014 very well. The story builds upon the NSA and their surveillance online, meaning it could be set today because this is a very relevant topic today. Susan stays in Crypto (the cryptographer’s area in the NSA HQ) through the whole book. She is mostly alone working on her computer. There isn’t really much to say about the environment in Crypto since she is mostly alone in a regular office. David however is in a more interesting place. He is wandering the streets of Seville, Spain. You get the impression that David is an outsider in Seville, but he blends in surprisingly well due to his language skills. We do not hear much about the tourist-parts of Seville, but more the area where the natives live. David is accepted by the Spaniards because of his fluent Spanish.\n\nThe protagonist in the book is Susan Fletcher. Susan is a very attractive woman in the thirties. She is the top-cryptographer in the NSA – she is also the only female cryptographer in the NSA. Susan is a hard working patriot that loves her job. She is also very sensitive when it comes to David. She is worried throughout the whole book about how he is doing in Seville. Susan got a very strong personality and is very self-confident. I believe this is due to the fact that she is the leader of a group with only male cryptographers. She is well respected in Crypto. All in all, Susan is a static character in the book.\n\nThe point of view in Digital Fortress is difficult. Since the book got several parallel stories – four to be exact. There are two main-stores and two side-stories. The main-stories are set in third-person where you gain access to one of the character’s head. The first main-story is where we follow Susan.\n\n“Susan’s mind was racing – Ensei Tankado wrote a program that creates unbreakable codes! She could barely grasp the thought.”\n\n– Digital Fortress, p63.\n\nYou can see from the quote that the narrator is third-person, and that we grant access to Susan’s head.\n\n“”Mr. Becker?” a voice crackled. “We’re here.” Becker stood and stretched. After unlatching the overhead compartment, he remembered he had no luggage. There had been no time to pack”\n\n– Digital Fortress, p73.\n\nYou can also see that we gain access to David Becker’s head in the other main-story. Finally, the two side-stories are written in the same point of view, but you do not gain access to anyone’s head. The point of view is there for alternating, since the perspective changes between two characters.\n\nThe book brings in a lot of interesting aspects when it comes to NSA’s activity the last couple of years. It also brings in real-world organisations like Electronic Frontier Foundation which is working for freedom on the internet. There is no doubt that the book is about privacy on the internet. There is even a quote in the book that I would say sums up the theme very well. “Who will guard the guards?” This is the theme of the book. The actual meaning is that when activities are so secret that not even the lawmakers know about them, no one can control it. If the NSA spies on everyone, no one will be there to stop them since they are at the top of the political “food-chain”.\n\nThis blogging assignment is coming to an end and I am to write about my thoughts of this project. During the next couple of weeks I will have to hand in my full analysis. The blog is supposed to be making it easier to write the final analysis. Now I have written a full analysis in my blog already, but the final paper is supposed to be way shorter. I will have to summarize and polish the posts I have already written.\n\nWhen it comes to the task as a whole, I think it is a great idea to have the students to blog about their book. It makes it, as I said, easier to write the final analysis. You make yourself write a lot more when it is portioned over several weeks. I think a task like this works best for students that find it hard to write a longer analysis or book report. However, this is not an issue for me. I have no troubles with writing to few words.\n\n“It is said that in death, all things become clear ”\n\n― Dan Brown, Digital Fortress\n\nI have a problem with postponing all of my work until the last day – last night, even. Usually, I would just ponder about the book for a couple of days, without writing anything down, and then start writing the analysis a couple of hours before the deadline. I find this method to work because I work better under stress. By having the different parts of the analysis divided into several deadlines over a couple of weeks forces me to not postpone the work until the last night, because I actually have to write the whole analysis in the format of a blog.\n\nThe fact that the blog is public makes a huge different. I am able to read the other student’s blogs, and they are able to read mine and comment. Making us commented on other’s posts was a great exercise. Giving feedback on their work as well as getting feedback on my own blog was really helpful. It also made the blogging more fun because of all the interaction with the other students. I also ended up getting around ten comments from strangers on my first post. That really gave my self-confidence a large boost.\n\nI haven’t just looked at the blog as a school-assignment, but also like a hobby. I like writing about what I do and what I think. I will most definitely keep this blog and continue blogging about other things than the book. Blogging is great for logging your own thoughts and actions, as well as it might be entertaining for others to read.\n\nNow, if you haven’t noticed already I have added my favorite quotes from the book in some of the posts. I’ve added one in this post as well, of course. The book contains a lot of good quotes that really makes you start to think, and some of them make a lot of sense in your own life.\n\nSo, the theme of the book. In my opinion, the most important aspect of a book. The theme tells us what the book is really about, and it sums up the book in one word or a short phrase. Some books are about love, good versus evil, lonelyness, et cetera. Finding the theme and expressing it with the right word or phrase is usually a difficult task. However, for this book it is kind of easy.\n\nIt’s not secret that Digital Fortress is based around the speculations about NSA ‘spying’ on the internet. The book brings in a lot of interesting aspects when it comes to NSA’s activity the last couple of years. It also brings in real-world organisations like Electronic Frontier Foundation wich is working for freedom on the internet. Dan Brown is known to do a lot of research on the topic, and then add some ficitonal aspects to the story, making it hard to figure out what is ficiton and what is fact. Anyways, there is no doubt that the book is about privacy on the internet. There is even a quote in the book that I would say sums up the theme very well.\n\n“Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who will guard the guards?”\n\n― Dan Brown, Digital Fortress\n\nWho will guard the guards. This is the theme of the book. The actual meaning behind the quote is that there are no one making sure that the governments and the police are not breaking the law. There are no guards for the guards. If the NSA spies on everyone, no one will be there to stop them since they are at the top of the political “food-chain”.\n\nAll in all, this book is about privacy and about governments not following their own rules.\n\nSource: https://www.eff.org/ – 05.02.2014 23:42\n\nThe next task that I have been assigned is based around the point of view in the book. The point of view is also refered to as the narrator of the story – the one that tells the story. The point of view will affect the story a lot, bucause it will limit you to only know the feelings of a selection of characters, or no characters at all. Some books are written in first person, where a character tells the story – using “I”. Other stories are written in third person where you either know the thoughts off one character or all the characters. There are also other narrator-types, but these are the most common ones.\n\nDigital Fortress got a very strange point of view. As I mentioned earlier, you jump from story to story between every chapter. This means the point of view also changes. There are two main-stories, and then two others that are somewhat related to the main-stories. One of the main-stories where we follow Susan Fletcher is written in third-person. You can easily see this in this line:\n\n“Susan’s mind was racing-Ensei Tankado wrote a programt hat creates unbreakable codes! She could barely grasp the thought.”\n\n– Digital Fortress, p63\n\nYou can see that Susan is refered to as “she”, making it third-person. We are also granted access to her mind, meaning that it is an alternating point of view. An alternating point of view is where the story is in third-person, but the perspective changed from person to person. This is becuase you also gain access to David’s mind in the other main-story. I also hope that the quote works as a teaser to how the story develops. I described the code-breaking machine TRANSLTR in my last post, and now we get to hear about unbreakable codes? You are left to speculate a lot in this book. You do not get many answers in the beginning, at least. Hopefully, all the pieces will fall into place in the end. ..And haven’t we heard the name Ensei Tankado before?\n\n“”Mr. Becker?” a voice crackled. “We’re here.” Becker stood and stretched. After unlatching the overhead compartment, he remembered he had no luggage. There had been no time to pack”\n\n– Digital Fortress, p73\n\nYou can see that Becker is refered to as “he”, and we get to know what he is thinking. This makes the perspective change from one chapter to another.\n\nFinaly, the two last stories are written in third-person, but you do not gain access to anyone’s thoughts. This makes the two side-stories kind of interesting beucase you do not get to know the people in them. You get a feeling that the information is very relevant, but it is hard to relate to because of the point of view.\n\nSource:\n\nPhoto: http://www.writework.com/uploads/5/51252/english-photo-susan-fletcher-ph-d.jpg\n\nSince the book got several parallel stories, it’s hard to describe the setting and environment of the book as a whole. Instead, I will describe the setting of the two main-stories which would be Susan’s story and David’s story. Both stories are written in third person. We get to know what Susan and David thinks, so it is sort of an all knowing narrator. The book was written in the late 90s, but the story would fit 2014 as well. Since the story builds upon the NSA and their surveillance online, it could be set today because this is a very relevant topic as of now.\n\nSusan is summoned to the NSA headquarters. She stays in Crypto (the cryptographer’s area in the NSA HQ) through the whole book. Crypto consists of a huge hall lying beneath a gigantic glass-dome that works as a roof. The main-wall in Crypto Is covered with glass. This is where Commander Strathmore got his office. From this location, he can sit and view all of the cryptographers working while they can’t see him. You can only see through the glass from the inside. On the other side of the hall, there is another wall that looks the same. Inside this office there are several terminals where the cryptographers do most of their work. This place is not very distant from our world, as there are many modern offices today. However, what lies beneath the office floor is way more exciting than the high-tech office itself.\n\n“Force a hand, and it will fight you. But convince and mind to think as you want it to think, an you have an ally”\n\n― Dan Brown, Digital Fortress\n\nUnder the office-floor of Crypto lies TRANSLTR. TRANSLTR is the single most expensive piece of computing equipment in the world – a machine the NSA swore did not exist. Since this story is set to the early 90s, the internet is not the same as we know it today. At this time, E-mail was the only thing known as internet. Firstly, NSA’s surveillance was based upon listening in on phone-calls. This was rather easy for the NSA, which made it easy to track down terrorists etc. However, with the arrival of e-mail this job became harder. Instead of calling your criminal-partners, the terrorists started to use e-mail. The NSA did not have any problem with snooping e-mails from the terrorists, so this was not a problem. The problem came afterwards when people started to encrypt their e-mails. There was software that easily encrypted their text. This would make the text look like nonsense to anyone that does not have the “pass-key”. The pass-key would be a long series of characters that explains how to read the encrypted text correctly. In the start, these pass-keys were short enough for the NSA’s computers so solve. Ten digits pass-keys was no problem for the computers. After some time, the world got wise to the power of brute-force. Brute-force is the term for guessing the pass-key until you get it right. Since the pass-keys consisted of 10 letters, you would have to try every possibility between 0000000000 and 9999999999. Sooner or later the computer would guess the right number.\n\nSince the pass-keys grew to become longer, the guessing time would also grow to become longer. Guessing times growing from hours to years made the surveillance very difficult for the NSA. By the 1990s, pass-keys were over fifty characters long and employed the full 256-cgaracter ASCII alphabet of letters, numbers and symbols. The number of possibilities would be 10^120-one with 120 zeros after it. Guessing the correct combination was mathematically just as likely as guessing the right grain of sand on a three-mile beach. The NSA’s fastest computer at that time; Cray/Josephson II would use over nineteen years on a regular key-pass. This would make it practically impossible to decrypt e-mails. This was until the NSA decided to build the world’s first universal code-breaking machine; TRANSLTR. Costing over 2$ billion dollars and consisting of over 3 million parallel processors, TRANSLTR could break a 64-bit code in just over ten minutes. Of course, only Crypto and the top-tier of Directors in the NSA would know of it’s existence.\n\nAt least, since TRANSLTR is placed beneath Crypto, its generators humming noises are well described in the book. I think this gives the Crypto offices a special mood. What if the cooling-system would fail – what would happen then?\n\nHowever, David Becker is sent to Seville, Spain. He is supposed to collect the belongings of a man that died from a heart-attack. It seems Commander Strathmore were the one that asked David to do this. David roams the streets of Seville. You get the feeling that he is in an older Spanish village with a lot of tourists. Thinking about the prologue, who is the man he is retrieving stuff from?\n\nAfter all I am very satisfied with the descriptions in the book. You get a good idea of the environments in the book and it kind of makes you feel kind of at home when reading the book.\n\nThere is a lot to say about the prologue and the first chapter of this book, at least compared to the length. Both the prologue and the first chapter are no longer than two paragraphs. However, this does not make them less important! I think Dan Brown did a good job with writing an interesting start. I at least feel more excited about the rest of the story, especially after the teasing prologue.\n\nThe prologue is set in Seville, Spain. There is a man named Ensei Tankado dying in the Adnalusian sun. For some reason he is showing his left hand to the people trying to help him. No one understands what Tankado wants. Tankado dies as he looks at the reflecting sun through his golden ring.\n\n“Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who will guard the guards?”\n\n― Dan Brown, Digital Fortress\n\nThe prologue gives us a small clue about the plot. Most likely, this Ensei Tankado plays an important role in the story. Tankado’s death is only described with about ten lines, but it contains a lot of small details. I believe that since there is a lot of attention around the ring, it is probably something important as well. His hand is also emphasized. It is deformed, and he only have three fingers. I am quite sure that it will be important to remember all of these details.\n\nThe first chapter provides a lot more of information. The book starts in media res, as a lot of other novels do. It starts off with Susan Fletcher dreaming about herself and her fiancé spending a night at a hotel in the Smoky Mountains. Well, they are not fiancés when the dream starts, but they are in the end. The dream is cut off as Susan’s phone rings. Her fiancé David Becker is calling to postpone their trip to the Stone Manor in the Smoky Mountains. Becker tells Susan that there is an emergency in Spain, and he has to leave immediately and will call Susan on the plane with more information. Susan finds it odd that the University where David works will send him all over to Europe. Later the same day Susan receives a second phone-call. This time, it is from her boss – Commander Trevor Strathmore. He needs Susan to come down to the NSA-cryptography headquarter as soon as possible because of an emergency.\n\nThe first chapter gives us a lot of information on the protagonists. I believe there will be more than one protagonist in this story, as Dan Brown is known to have several parallel stories in his novels. Since Susan is the point of attention, I believe she will be one of the protagonists – maybe even the main one? It is hard to tell whether David or Strathmore will play a role as large as Susan’s. At least, after the first chapter we get to learn that Susan is engaged, she lives alone and she works as a cryptographer for the NSA. David Becker is a professor at an University and Strathmore is a Commander in the NSA. I think this might be the main pillars of the whole story and I think it is good that Dan Brown brings them in this early.\n\nThe introduction/first impression of the book is absolutely positive. I am very stoked about reading more. I am sure this book will be just as good as the Da Vinci Code.\n\nSource – picture: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Dan_Brown_bookjacket_cropped.jpg 16.01.14"
