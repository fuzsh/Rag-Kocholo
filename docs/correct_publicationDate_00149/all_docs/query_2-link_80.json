        "text": "There’s just no substitute for the truth\n\nI am still busy reading all the novels written by Dan Brown. I really like them, but this one was a bit too much politics for my liking.\n\nBook Review: Deception Point by Dan Brown\n\nRating:\n\nTitle & Author: Deception Point by Dan Brown\n\nGenre: Thriller, Mystery\n\nRelease Date: November 1 2001\n\nSeries: Standalone\n\nPublisher: Pocket Books\n\nSynopsis\n\nWhen a new NASA satellite spots evidence of an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory…a victory that has profound implications for U.S. space policy and the impending presidential election. With the Oval Office in the balance, the President dispatches White House Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the authenticity of the find. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic academic Michael Tolland, Rachel uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery — a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy.\n\nBut before Rachel can contact the President, she and Michael are attacked by a deadly team of assassins controlled by a mysterious power broker who will stop at nothing to hide the truth. Fleeing for their lives in an environment as desolate as it is lethal, their only hope for survival is to find out who is behind this masterful ploy. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all.\n\nI give Deception Point by Dan Brown three out of five hearts. I felt the novel was too political for me. I do not like politics, let alone read about it. I did not mind it if it is small part of the story. But in this novel it is literally the main point on why everything is happening.\n\nI could not figure out where Rachel’s loyalty really lied. She is the daughter of the man running for president but she is working for the president. How can a president want a person like that working for him. She says she is loyal to him, but you can never know with who her loyalties lay when it comes to an outsider and a family member.\n\nGabrielle is an interesting character because she is the senators aide, but had also a affair with him at one point during their cooperation. She in the end chooses the expose her affair and humiliating the senator instead of ruining the president and NASA with an exposing fax about them fabricating evidence. I think that is really well done of her.\n\nOverall Deception Point is a good story, but it did not really work for me. Also there were a couple of things I saw coming before they actually happened due to them being tropes. I wish there were a little bit better hidden, but accepted they were there.\n\nLet me know what you thought of this book!\n\nIf you have any requests for which book I should talk about next, please let me know in the comments down below.\n\nFor now, let books enrich your life!\n\nGoodreads\n\nAuthor"
