Shubham Singhal | Roll No.: A051, SAP ID: 80303120053 7  Relationships:  About myself:  I read this book for the first time while I was in 2nd year of my B.Tech. in Computer Science.  I have always had keen interest in computer science, coding and information security.  I had taken Cryptography, coding in several languages like C, C++, Java, Computer Networks during my graduation.  I then worked in IT industry for 2 years in Information Security domain as a Security Analyst.  Why this book:  Since this book is my favourite because:  Common interests of the book and myself: the codes!  The book is an easy to read and literally un-droppable  It is a perfect blend of: o Fast paced techno thrill o Technology o Romance o Action o Secret intelligence organizations o Responsibility and accountability in an organization o Love the work that you do- being passionate  As per me, it is a must read (I have myself read it many times) for all, and to support me on that point- yes, millions of copies of this book have been sold and is widely acclaimed all over.  Some of the Reviews to support my point are:  Digital Fortress is the best and most realistic techno-thriller to reach the market in years. Dan Brown‘s ability to paint in living color the gray area between personal freedom vs. national security is awesome. The story line is so good, readers will feel a chilling thrill a minute as the book makes one think who is truly the terrorist and who is actually freedom‘s guardian. - Midwest Book Review\n\n8. Shubham Singhal | Roll No.: A051, SAP ID: 80303120053 8  In this fast-paced, plausible tale, Brown blurs the line between good and evil enough to delight patriots and paranoids alike. - Publisher’s Weekly Evaluation of the Book  Usefulness of the book for my study: <Personal Views>  The book Digital Fortress and I have a common interest- the codes.  This book helped me:  To get an insight of the power of the codes.  To know the various number of uses of codes.  To know how important it is to maintain the information security and protect the important and confidential data for letting out to the outside world.  To know that whether our personal conversations, emails really personal or are they being monitored by the intelligence organizations.  To know how a single man with his simple genius mind challenged the best intelligence organization- the NSA just by writing an unbreakable code and how he could blackmail the NSA.  To get exposed to the power of Information Technology in today‘s world.  How it is related to my subject of study: < Personal Views>  The book is related to the ‗codes‘ which is of a common interest to me as well.  I have always had keen interest in computer science, coding and information security.  I had taken Cryptography, coding in several languages like C, C++, Java, Computer Networks during my graduation.  I then worked in IT industry for 2 years in Information Security domain as a Security Analyst.  Is it intended for my subject of study: <Personal Views>\n\n9. Shubham Singhal | Roll No.: A051, SAP ID: 80303120053 9  This book is a work of fiction and a part of my curriculum. I read it out of interest and also as part of my hobby– which is reading.  This book interests me since it is about the topic of cryptography, codes, information security, network architecture- which being a technology enthusiast excites and interests me.  Is the Book written clearly and did the author achieve his goal: <Personal Views>  The book is written in a very easy, expressive and adaptive language which keeps the reader engrossed with the book.  The suspense of the story is packed with such twists and is so unpredictable that it keeps the reader thinking and go page by page as soon as possible to get to know the code which would save the NSA‘s future.  Yes, the author has achieved his goal in making the book very interesting and a real thriller packed with the latest technology and secrets of that time. And thus this makes the book a very widely acclaimed and thus selling millions of copied worldwide.  Author’s main points with some examples from the book: <These are the author’s views>  ―Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who will guard the guards?‖  This is in context that NSA refers to the guards here who claim to protect the world by cracking codes and letting out the important useful information but what if their intentions are wrong? So, who is keeping a check on that? Thus, the question who is going to guard the guards themselves?  This became an important centre of question and discussion of the book, since the NSA was keeping a deep dark secret through the Strathmore‘s strategy, which was under a danger to getting disclosed to the entire world creating a havoc in the digital world, and it is thus important to keep a check on his work and plans.  ―Everything is possible. The impossible just takes longer.‖  It is like a motivational statement as used in the book.\n\n10. Shubham Singhal | Roll No.: A051, SAP ID: 80303120053 10  What is possible today was not possible yesterday even in our dreams. This thought and the belief in the technology and the possibilities keep the scientists and the coders and the code breakers keep going.  Thus nothing is possible i.e. everything is possible and the things that are considered to be impossible they are not impossible, it is just that one needs to wait for it as it is going to take some more time to become a reality.  ―Please accept this humble fax. My love for you is without wax.‖  This is what David Becker sent to Susan Fletcher (romantically).  David Becker was a professor of Modern Languages and was the fiancé of Susan Fletcher.  Susan Fletcher was the NSA's Head Cryptographer.  Susan only told David about the codes, how it evolved and how they broke the codes.  So, out of love David wrote this for Susan to tell her how much he loves her. Here a code is used - without wax – which refers to purity. So, this shows how much pure his love is for her, and it was her for whom he went the extra mile and did anything he could for her.  ―But Susan's thoughts were far removed from the political implications of Digital Fortress. She was still struggling to comprehend its existence. She'd spent her life breaking codes, firmly denying the existence of the ultimate code. Every code is breakable - the Bergofsky Principle! She felt like an atheist coming face to face with God.‖  A lot was going in the NSA that day revolving around the TRANSLTR. Many strategies were being implemented along with the political games- in which Susan was least interested.  To her surprise there existed a code having mutation strings which resulted in an unbreakable code.  As per the Bergofsky Principle- every code is breakable and this forms the basis of their study and the cryptography and this is what\n\n11. Shubham Singhal | Roll No.: A051, SAP ID: 80303120053 11 keeps a code breaker keep going that yes, the code is breakable and yes there is a solution to it.  But, over here there was a situation, where they had an unbreakable code, so this left Susan thinking on the possibility of it, and how the world would be if this is the case. It is like atheist who believes there is no such thing as God, is coming face to face with a God in reality and thus all his/her previous beliefs and in a way his entire life and work is questioned.  \"‘We all have a right to keep secrets,' he (Tankado) said. 'Some day I'll see to it we can.‘\"  As per Tankado, there is a right to keep secrets and that is how it should be done. But by using TRANSLTR, the NSA was able to break this and break all the codes getting exposed to all the secrets.  Tankado thus decided to make sure that people can keep secrets and there is a way out to have codes that are unbreakable and he said that someday he will make sure that this can be done. And yes, this came as a warning to the NSA and he did by writing the Digital Fortress.  Understanding of the subject of study enhanced though this book: < Personal Views>  The main subject of this book is codes, cryptography, digital attacks, information intelligence agencies, hacking, algorithms etc.  Dan Brown has done a wonderful work with this masterpiece in talking about these things in a descriptive way wrapping with a great storyline and adding the spice of a thriller.  By this book I got to know about these things and how these are used in real life and how they can affect one‘s life (in the digital world) i.e. by letting out all of ones‘ information to the public including all the emails, conversations.  Also, I got to know about the existence of organisations like NSA and how they work and how much amount of work has been done in this field and its scope from the point of view of information security.\n\n12. Shubham Singhal | Roll No.: A051, SAP ID: 80303120053 12  Thus, this book did help me in knowing about these topics and since it is a work of fiction, I am actually able to imagine what amount of work and breaching, hacking, codes and the code breaking must be going on in the intelligence organizations and how much challenging can it be!  Personal experiences relating to the book: < Personal Views>  I got this book during my B.Tech. as a recommendation and as a gift from my elder brother (also a B.Tech. in IT), so it was an emotional moment and also I was looking forward to read the book as soon as possible since I respect my brother and like taste of books and articles. We share common interest topics when it comes to technology and coding.  At that time, I was not good enough in English and have not read much books previously, so it took me quite some time to read it along with my academic commitments of my semester system.  This book helped me in a way to improve my English and my reading speed because it increases as one reads more and more.  I do remember I participated in an inter college competition organized by ‗Career Launcher‘ to check good one is to become a future manager and it required a series of competitions, one of which was an English written one and a Group Discussion (this being my first ever Group Discussion competition). And to prepare myself for it, ( you would not believe this) I read a few more chapters of this book, to get more fluency and command over English language because I simply enjoyed a lot reading this book, whereas the others were mugging up the word lists and browsing the internet and what not. And yes, I did got to the finals of the competition.  (This one is a bit funny to think about now) I used to read this book in the classroom lectures, on my way to the college and in my bedroom, and not my text books of my curriculum. I was so much glued to it and to reach to the end to know the suspense. And my mother used to scold me and at times even hide the book, so that I get rid of it and study my course‘s text books!\n\n13. Shubham Singhal | Roll No.: A051, SAP ID: 80303120053 13  What I appreciate most of this book: < Personal Views>  The writing style of Dan Brown.  It is an easy to read and understandable format.  One can actually visualize the characters and the events happening in the book, thanks to the author‘s eye to details.  The way the chapters are linked to each other as the real suspense of the code comes along in the past, making sense to all the previous chapters.  The book is a perfect mix of :  Fast paced techno thrill  Technology  Romance  Action  Secret intelligence organizations  Responsibility and accountability in an organization  The way the context is described, that even a newbie can understand inspite of being a bit technical context.  What I disliked about the book: < Personal Views>  The chapters of the book go parallel with different stories of their own, so this in a way creates a disconnect while reading the book in a flow. This is basically done to delay the suspense but it could have been done in a better way may be.  The suspense of the book i.e. the code to save the NSA finally, was a bit predictable in the last few pages. It was not that much difficult in the end to crack by such high IQ employees of the NSA, so it was a bit exaggerated.  It lagged the momentum of the story in a few places in the middle and was a bit boring and then after a few chapters it again gained its pace. So there were ups and downs in the pace of the story of the book."
