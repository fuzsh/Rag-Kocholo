        "text": "About the Book\n\nWhen the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves throughout the corridors of power.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nBefore the multi-million, runaway bestseller The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown set his razor-sharp research and storytelling skills on the most powerful intelligence organization on earth--the National Security Agency (NSA)--in this thrilling novel, Digital Fortress.\n\nWhen the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage--not by guns or bombs -- but by a code so complex that if released would cripple U.S. intelligence. Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"In this fast-paced, plausible tale, Brown blurs the line between good and evil enough to delight patriots and paranoids alike.\" --Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Digital Fortress is the best and most realistic techno-thriller to reach the market in years...
