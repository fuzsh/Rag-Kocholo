It is important, however, that we don't react with too much paranoia; agencies like the NSA are far more interested in terrorists than in the average citizen.\" \"I'm far more of a romantic than I am a political espionage junkie. Romance (particularly lovers separated by insurmountable obstacles) always makes me care more about the characters and therefore the action.\""
