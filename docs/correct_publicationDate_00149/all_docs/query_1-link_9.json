        "text": "When I first started reading I was a little worried that this might be a book the Dan Brown wrote on the side of his Langdon series that never really took off.\n\nNow, why that had me worried, I'm not sure. That doesn't really change how amazing Dan Brown is at an author, per se.\n\nSo I reluctantly continued and discovered a world working with digital security and combining that of the NSA, a super computer, an assassin, Spain, and so many more elements that I could have never expected at first glance.\n\nNow, knowing Dan Brown's work, I should have seen this coming. But, the silly reluctance with eventual surprised findings were more than welcome in the long run.\n\nI say long run, but it was more of a blast through this book as I couldn't put it down! It was definitely what I needed.\n\nIf you like any of Dan Brown's other works: you'll love Digital Fortress.\n\nIf you don't know any of Dan Brown's other books...you should! You don't necessarily have to start here (maybe Angels and Demons!), but you should!\n\nOverall I'll give this one a 4 out of 5. I loved it. I couldn't put it down. But it also wasn't the masterpiece of Langdon novels or even other mystery thrillers I've fallen in love with.\n\nI'm curious to see what you guys have to think!\n\nMy next read will be Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Askaban (this month's book club book), but I'm also reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Emma by Jane Austen."
