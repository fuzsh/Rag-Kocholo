        "text": "sometime ago I decided to spend one summer reading all of Dan Brown's books (yeah I don't know what was I thinking). Bad idea because the books have similar structures... But I remember thinking this one was not so bad. Maybe it can work as a series.\n\nDeception Point is the worst tho.\n\nI did the same thing. They all get mixed up in my head now, I don't remember which is which.\n\nI confuse all the Langdon ones\n\n(no subject) - xdecadentx Expand\n\nDeception Point WAS the worst. I read it on a school trip waaay back at the height of Dan Brown hype and as soon as I realized that obviously the young, beautiful heroine would inexplicably fall in for the lead Dan Brown stand-in despite with the worst kind of glaring leadup possible I almost chucked it out of the bus. WHATEVER.\n\nI feel like his books are 'mehhh, okay' when you're reading them, but afterwards I think back and I legit cannot remember what happens in any of them.\n\nThe only thing I can remember about this one is the guy holding up his fingers lol\n\nI had the opposite reaction hehe, this one was the one that made me go \"okay, not even the trashy factor can help this\" and I gave up on anything Dan Brown ever since.\n\nEdit: I did not read Deception Point, though, so maybe that's why digital fortress ranks #1 worst DB book in my list.\n\nEdited at 2014-09-12 02:58 pm (UTC)\n\nDan Brown is full of shit and I hope this flops. I want more women-led TV shows but not from someone like Dan Brown.\n\nMy husband and I are reading The Lost Symbol aloud right now, featuring our Nicolas Cage impressions as Robert Langdon. TLS is basically like a parody of a Dan Brown book, which is hilarious to read, but also deeply, deeply infuriating, because this awful writer has seen more money than I ever will.\n\nThat books is SOOOOOOOO unnecessarily long.\n\nIt is! We got to the halfway point last week and we were like 'HOW???'\n\nI love the Robert Langdon series but I hateee the Lost Symbol. It is wayyy too boring\n\nIt is going to make the premise sexy, because coding is sexy. Guys, it seems like someone sexy, a programmer perhaps, has taken over this sexy site and is making me sexy write this.\n\nsomeone on here said they were in a book slump and that is exactly me right nowwww ugh. I started reading Keep Calm and Carry a Big Drink for something light LAST MONTH but it's not holding my attention at all. I do want to power through though.\n\nI bought We Were Liars at Target yesterday so I'm hoping that helps.\n\nI'm trying to read really short and trashy books just to get into reading, but I'm so not motivated atm.\n\nI just finished To Kill A Mockingbird via audiobook though.\n\nI'd want a look at the list of technical advisors they are getting for this show to see if they're getting decent advice about computers and the political issues. Brown himself is pretty unreliable.\n\nHm. This will probably be super dull and white-washed instead of thought-provoking. But maybe I'll be surprised, I never read a Dan Brown after all.\n\nThe only thing I really remember (besides being disapointed) was that his description of Spain was cringe-worthy. I could feel second-hand offense as I read it.\n\nWas it just a lot of bulls running?\n\n(no subject) - selenia_actimel Expand\n\n(no subject) - therearewords Expand\n\nI'll watch this\n\nI made the mistake of reading all his books in a row. They all have the same formula so I pretty much ended up disliking them all. I remember Deception Point was the worst, but I don't remember this one being much better tbh. but hey maybe as a series it could be fun.\n\nAngels and Demons is the best book imo. It has the same formula, but tbh I remember being more interested in that one.\n\nMaybe because I was doing a science degree at the time.\n\nlbr, nobody cares about dan brown, so..:)\n\nI'm reading Seraphina by Rachel Hartman\n\nafter that, I will start with The Six Wives of Henry VIII by Alison Weir\n\nMy sister got me to read Divergent (liked it), and I've been loving the heck out of Tanya Huff's Blood Price. I wanted a silly vampire novel for a quick read and was really entertained.\n\nIs this the one with an incredibly predictable 'twist', almost no enigmas, stuff that we the readers figure out before the characters, and the fabulous description of Spain as some sort of backend 4th world country?\n\nlmao how random\n\nI read this book in junior high and all I remember is that her boss(?) was obsessed with her so near the end of the book, she needed a password to get into something and put in her name to unlock it. that's literally all I remember. and maybe something with wax???????? yes her boyfriend or w/e would sign his letters to her \"without wax\", I think.\n\nI don't even remember this fucking book. Like everyone said, they have the same damn story."
