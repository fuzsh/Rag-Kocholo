        "text": "First edition cover Author(s) Dan Brown Country United States\n\nUnited Kingdom Language English Genre(s) Science fiction\n\nTechno-thriller Publisher St. Martin's Press Transworld (United Kingdom) Publication date 1998 Media type Print (hardback, paperback ((audiobook) ISBN ISBN 031218087X (first edition hardcover) OCLC Number 55045760 Followed by Angels & Demons\n\nDigital Fortress is a techno-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 1998 by St. Martin's Press. The book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored information on the private lives of citizens, and the possible civil liberties and ethical implications using such technology.\n\nContents\n\n1 Synopsis\n\n2 Characters\n\n3 Real life scenarios\n\n4 Foreign language editions\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nSynopsis\n\nWhen the United States National Security Agency's code-breaking machine (TRANSLTR) encounters a new and complex code—Digital Fortress—that it cannot break, Commander Trevor Strathmore calls in Susan Fletcher, their head cryptographer to crack it. She discovers that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with the NSA's intrusion into people's private lives. Tankado intends to auction the code's algorithm on his website and have his partner, \"NDAKOTA\", release it for free if he dies. Essentially holding the NSA hostage, the agency is determined to stop Digital Fortress from becoming a threat to national security.\n\nWhen Tankado does indeed die in Seville, of what appears to be a heart attack, Strathmore asks David Becker (Susan's fiancé) to travel to Seville and recover a ring that Tankado was wearing when he died. The ring is suspected to have the code that unlocks Digital Fortress. However, Becker soon discovers that Tankado gave the ring away immediately before his death. Each person he questions in the search for the ring is murdered by Hulohot, a mysterious assassin.\n\nMeanwhile, telephone calls between \"North Dakota\" and Numataka (chairman of a large computer company in Tokyo) reveal that North Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado in order to gain access to the passcode on his ring and speed up the release of the algorithm. At the NSA, Fletcher's investigation leads her to believe that Greg Hale, a fellow NSA employee, is North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, an NSA technician who is unaware of the Digital Fortress code breaking failure and believes Digital Fortress to be a virus, conducts his own investigation into whether Strathmore allowed Digital Fortress to bypass Gauntlet (NSA's virus/worm filter). However, Chartrukian is murdered in the sub-levels of TRANSLTR by an unknown assailant. Since Hale and Strathmore were both in the sub-levels, Fletcher assumes that Hale is the killer; however, Hale claims that he witnessed Strathmore killing Chartrukian. Chartrukian's death by falling off a balcony also damages TRANSLTR's cooling system.\n\nHale holds Fletcher and Strathmore hostage to prevent himself from being arrested for the murder. It is then that Hale explains that the e-mail he supposedly \"received\" from Tankado was actually in his inbox because he was snooping on Strathmore, who was also watching Tankado's e-mail account. After the encounter, Hale's name is cleared when Fletcher discovers through a tracer that North Dakota and Ensei Tankado are actually the same person, as \"NDAKOTA\" is an anagram of \"Tankado\". Strathmore's role as the primary antagonist is revealed when Strathmore fatally shoots Hale, and arranges it to appear as a suicide. Susan later discovers through Strathmore's pager that he is the one who hired Hulohot. Becker later kills Hulohot in a violent confrontation.\n\nChapters told from Strathmore's perspective reveal his motives. By hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring, and having Hulohot kill him, would help facilitate a romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor, and enable him to unlock Digital Fortress. By making phone calls to Numataka impersonating as \"North Dakota\", he thought he could partner with Numataka Corporation to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with his own backdoor Trojan so that the NSA can spy on every computer equipped with these chips. However, Strathmore didn't know that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm once unlocked, \"eating away\" at the NSA databank's security and allowing \"any third-grader with a modem\" to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR overheats, Strathmore commits suicide by standing next to the machine as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but soon after Fletcher figures out the password, and is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher. At last it is revealed that Numataka is Ensei Tankado's father. Numataka left Tankado the day he was born since Tankado was a deformed child.\n\nCharacters\n\nSusan Fletcher — The NSA's Head Cryptographer, and the story's lead character\n\nDavid Becker — A university professor on languages and the fiancé of Susan Fletcher\n\nEnsei Tankado Numataka — A disgruntled former NSA employee\n\nCommander Trevor Strathmore — NSA Deputy Director of Operations and the tragic hero\n\nPhil Chartrukian — Sys-Sec Technician\n\nGreg Hale — NSA Cryptogropher\n\nLeland Fontaine — Director of NSA\n\n\"Hulohot\" — An assassin hired by Strathmore and sent to Spain and the secondary antagonist\n\nMidge Milken — Fontaine's internal security analyst\n\nChad Brinkerhoff — Fontaine's personal assistant\n\n\"Jabba\" — NSA's senior System Security Officer\n\nTokugen Numataka — Tankado's father who made deal with Strathmore and the main antagonist\n\nReal life scenarios\n\nThe book is loosely based around recent history of cryptography. In 1976 the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was approved with a 56-bit key rather than the 64-bit key originally proposed. It was widely believed that the National Security Agency had pushed through this reduction in security on the assumption that it could crack codes before anyone else.[1]\n\nIn fact the DES was first publicly broken in 1997, 96 days after the first of the DES Challenges.[2] In 1998, the same year as Digital Fortress was published, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (featured in the book) built a piece of hardware costing less than $250,000 called the EFF DES cracker which broke it in 56 hours and by 1999 the record was under 24 hours.[3]\n\nThe brute force search used by TRANSLTR takes twice as long for each extra bit added to the key (if this is done sensibly), so the reaction of the industry has understandably been to lengthen the key. The Advanced Encryption Standard established in 2001 uses 128, 192 or 256 bits, which take at least 1021 times as long (i.e. 270) to solve by this technique.[4]\n\nUnbreakable codes are not new to the industry. The one-time pad, invented in 1917 and used for the cold-war era Moscow-Washington hotline, was proved to be unconditionally secure by Claude Shannon in 1949 when properly implemented.[5] However it is inconvenient to use in practice and is limited mainly to military and governments.[6]\n\nForeign language editions\n\nThe following is a list of foreign language editions of the novel.
