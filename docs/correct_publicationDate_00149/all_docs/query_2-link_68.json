        "text": "Rank: Advanced Member\n\nJoined: 1/28/2012\n\nPosts: 5,045\n\nNeurons: 34,900\n\nLocation: München, Bavaria, Germany\n\nI am just reading Dan Brown's latest thriller and I must say I like the book. It is about Professor Langdon again, the Harward specialist for medieval symbols and other things, who this time has to face a scientist who has the idea to solve the problem of overpopulation by decimating the world's population by the Black Plague or a similar virus disease. As this scientist is at the same time a specialist and fan of Dante's Inferno Dante's horrible vision of hell plays an important role in the novel. Langdon's task is to prevent the scenario of the plague, at the same time he is hunted by a lot of people who want to eliminate him. Accompanied by a young attractive female doctor Langdon's search leads him from a hospital in Florence to Venice and then even to Istanbul. Dan Brown did not only write a thrilling story he also has a lot of cultural information about the history of Florence and Venice, and, of course, about Dante and his description of the underworld.\n\nI read some commentaries about Brown's Inferno, some are very critical , some are positive. I give just one link\n\nDan Brown - Inferno\n\nRank: Advanced Member\n\nJoined: 2/4/2014\n\nPosts: 13,072\n\nNeurons: 14,324,877\n\nLocation: Bogotá, Bogota D.C., Colombia\n\nI am a deeply admirer of Dan Brown's work, I have already read all his books and each of them has exceeded my expectations.\n\nHe is one of the modern writers, alongside with Ken Follet, who really endure a true research and study in their works. I used to accompany the reading with my own research and I can feel safe that what I'm reading is accurate and well-founded material.\n\nTheir books are a source of great information, history, art and culture, and most of the time excellent tour guides.\n\n\"Inferno\" is a perfect description of Firenze, the Boboli Gardens, de Signoria Piazza... and Venice.....\n\nIt is a worthy reading I strongly recommended!"
