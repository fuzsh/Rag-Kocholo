        "text": "When you hear the name Dan Brown, you probably think of the DaVinci Code and Robert Langdon. However, this book chosen to represent Maryland does not have the blockbuster symbologist, but rather takes place in the NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade. There were only 3 books set in Maryland on the list, and I decided to go with Digital Fortress despite being split between the NSA building and Spain. So, while I’m sure my relatives from Baltimore will be slightly mad about me not choosing something from their city, there unfortunately wasn’t a whole lot of selection.\n\nThe story follows power couple Susan, a cryptographer for the NSA, and David, a linguistics professor as they tackle two different parts of a mysterious encryption known as Digital Fortress. David is sent to Spain to recover the belongings of the genius behind the encryption, while Susan works in the depths of the NSA HQ trying to figure out why their code breaker can’t break Digital Fortress. So, if you pick up Digital Fortress, be prepared for a bit of code speak from the late 90s, early 2000s when the NSA was still fairly unknown.\n\nWhile I can’t say that Digital Fortress is unknown (it’s in the top 150 of the list), it’s certainly not as popular as DaVinci code or Angels & Demons. This is likely due to the characters of Susan and David being a tad… bland? The side characters are also rather one-sided, even with the twists towards the end of the novel. In a Dan Brown, you expect any villain character to have a long, sort of drawn out backstory that ties directly to the thing the protagonist is seeking. That’s not really the case here. In fact, I know very little about the antagonist except that he uses one of these and is deaf. The fact that my husband now wants a wearable keyboard may have something to do with this novel, though. I have to say, though, the novel’s major flaw is that I didn’t connect with the characters.\n\nI did like the plot twists as they occurred. While there is heavy foreshadowing to the major issues of Digital Fortress, the book doesn’t entirely hold your hand to make you come to the end conclusions. While Dan Brown’s obsession with symbols isn’t as heavily prevalent, he still manages to work in puzzles based on historic events. It’s often referred to as an “airplane book” because a reader is more likely to pick up one of these books in an airport when they forgot something better to read. It’s certainly not horrible, plot wise, but there is a level of shallow-ness to the plot when compared to novels of the same length. Still, if internet code breaking during the .com boom is something you want to look into? Probably a good fictional take. It’s certainly an interesting look at how code breaking might have been at the turn of the century.\n\nPossibly the best thing about a Dan Brown novel, and this one in particular, is the detail put into describing everything. You can play the book like a movie in your head, from the sleek appearance of the NSA headquarters, to a grand cathedral in Seville Spain. So, while the character may seem fairly flat, and the plot is only so-so, the visuals do make for a decent read. While I did read the book for Maryland, I actually thought the visuals of the novel were better in Spain. This may be because the NSA headquarters is fairly limited in spaces described, sort of like Dan Brown was given a mini tour to help with the novel. As usual, I did pull up visuals of the actual place, and it’s certainly interesting.\n\nOverall, I liked the novel. Was it a favorite? No. But, it’s a decent cyber thriller from the turn of the century, and an interesting look into code breaking. I would, however, recommend the movie Hackers instead of this book, though. But that’s just me.\n\nForce a hand, and it will fight you. But convince and mind to think as you want it to think, an you have an ally – Dan Brown\n\nIf you like the review, please like and comment.
