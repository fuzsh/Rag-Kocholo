        "text": "JJ\n\nOk. Digital Fortress is about the NSA. The agency gets a virus in their best computer, now they have to find the guy who made the virus, because he has the key to the virus, which is needed to get it off of the computer.\n\nThe book is about 500 pages...\n\nOther works are: Deception Point, The Da Vinci Code, and Angels&Demons.\n\nIceFlash78\n\nI just read it. Amazing book... utterly amazing. I finsihed it in less than 24 hours (would have been less if I didn't have to sleep and didn't have to write an essay -_-). Very fast-paced thriller. I was continually guessing at every step.\n\nI was reculclant to try this because I'm the only person in the entire earth to not like the Da Vinci Code (but that's because I read the ending first, then I read all the scientific/juicy parts), but I'm glad I did. Very worthwihle reading. Tip: take yoru time reading the book.. I kinda regret that I didn't. For a while after reading the book, I was \"depressed\" that the book didin't go on and on...\n\nNow if only I coudl find that Da Vinci Code.. I think I would enjoy it even more if I didn't read the ending first.... (goes to test theory)"
