        "text": "Dan Brown (born June 22, 1964, Exeter, New Hampshire, U.S.) is an American author who wrote well-researched novels that centred on secret organizations and had intricate plots. He is best known for the Robert Langdon series, which notably included The Da Vinci Code (2003).\n\nBrown attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a prep school where his father was a math teacher, and in 1986 he graduated from Amherst (Massachusetts) College. He then moved to California to pursue a career as a songwriter. Although he had little success in the music industry, in 1990 he wrote his first book, 187 Men to Avoid, a dating survival guide for women; it was published in 1995.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWho Wrote It?\n\nIn 1993 Brown joined the faculty at Exeter as an English and creative-writing teacher. Several years later the U.S. Secret Service visited the school to interview a student who had written an e-mail in which he joked about killing the president. The incident sparked Brown’s interest in covert intelligence agencies, which formed the basis of his first novel, Digital Fortress (1998). Centred on clandestine organizations and code breaking, the novel became a model for Brown’s later works. In his next novel, Angels & Demons (2000), Brown introduced Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of symbology. The fast-paced thriller follows Langdon’s attempts to protect the Vatican from the Illuminati, a secret society formed during the Renaissance that opposed the Roman Catholic Church. Although the novel received positive reviews, it failed to catch on with readers.\n\nAfter his third novel, Deception Point (2001), Brown returned to Langdon with The Da Vinci Code, a thriller that centres on art history, Christianity’s origins, and arcane theories. Attempting to solve the murder of the Louvre’s curator, Langdon encounters mysterious organizations (Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion), discusses the hidden messages in Leonardo da Vinci’s art, raises the possibility that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and fathered a child, and discovers the Holy Grail. The Da Vinci Code proved controversial, and many theologians and art scholars dismissed Brown’s notions. The novel, however, proved immensely popular with readers. By 2009 more than 80 million copies had been sold, and editions were available in some 40 languages. Intense interest in the novel resulted in a spate of Code-related books and sparked sales of Brown’s earlier works; in 2004 all four of his novels appeared simultaneously on The New York Times best-seller lists. The film adaptations of The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons were released in 2006 and 2009, respectively, with Tom Hanks starring as Langdon."
