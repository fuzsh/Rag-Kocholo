        "text": "Dan Brown is the premiere source for edge-of-your-seat thrillers. I have read all books by Dan Brown and the Robert Langdon series is one of my favourites. Ever since I’ve picked up The Da Vinci Code, I’ve been hooked on the Robert Langdon series. I admit that I have a weakness for the formula Dan Brown utilises for his thrillers, employing an intoxicating mix of history, art, poetry, symbols, codes, and famous landmarks or architecture.\n\nDan Brown combines action with mystery, historical and science elements in an outstanding way and he creates an action thriller that you just cannot put down.\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of Dan Brown books are the historical elements. There are times that it feels like you’re watching a documentary, but an exciting one at that! Sometimes it feels like all those information are too much, but after you are done with the book you will still find yourself wanting to learn more about them.\n\nAnother great element that really is one of the reasons that I like his Dan Brown books so much is the setting. Dan Brown always uses a gorgeous place as the background of his story. A rousing adventure through exotic and renowned locations that have me reaching for Google search ever so often. Here is a complete list of the books by Dan Brown.\n\nStand-alone books by Dan Brown\n\nDigital Fortress\n\nFirst Published: 1998\n\nDigital Fortress is a techno-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 1998 by St. Martin’s Press.\n\nThe book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored information on the private lives of citizens, and the possible civil liberties and ethical implications of using such technology.\n\nWhen the National Security Agency’s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage… not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it would cripple U.S. intelligence.\n\nCaught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.\n\nDeception Point\n\nFirst Published: 2001\n\nWhen NASA discovered a new rare object which was buried under the Arctic ice. This discovery was a victory for the white house and the NASA also. because this victory has profound implications for U.S and the presidential elections. So The president dispatches his intelligent analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the accuracy of this find. When Rachel Arrived that place, she met a group of experts including Michael Toland. Rachel and Michael uncovered a huge mistake, a trick which was made by scientists.\n\nWhen Rachel and Michael tried to contact the president to tell him about this trick, a deadly team of assassins stopped them.\n\nRachel and Michael ran with their lives but The assassins still following them. So how could they survive and show this deception to the world??\n\nRobert Langdon Series by Dan Brown\n\nAngels and Demons\n\nFirst Published: 2000\n\nThis is the first novel of Robert Langdon series in which the character first appears. The well-known symbologist, Robert Langdon, is called in by the director of CERN when a renowned scientist is found murdered. The scientist had created anti-matter, in an attempt to demonstrate that divine creation of the universe was scientifically explainable. The scientist has, of course, a brilliant and beautiful daughter.\n\nThe tale has much payload regarding the Illuminati, an ancient group of scientists who had formed a secret society in opposition to the church. It is fast-paced, and a well made example of the action adventure tale. We learn much about the history of the illuminati, a bit about CERN, but the central questions remain ones of faith and science. It was a fun read, one I felt impelled to return to when free moments appeared.\n\nThe whole story takes place in 12 hours and this really is a great idea that Brown fully takes advantage of. You can feel the pressure of the time. I found myself many times throughout the book wanting to scream at the characters to hurry up! This energy that radiates from the pages is what made me read this book in two days. You feel like you are there with the characters, you want to solve the mystery.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code\n\nFirst Published: 2003\n\nThe Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is the second book under the Robert Langdon series. As usual, the protagonist, who is a symbologist, is summoned to solve a mystery that involves historical symbols. Given the character’s deep knowledge of the field, coupled with a gripping story involving Christian history, makes for an unputdownable read. The Da Vinci Code is one of the most controversial and best books by Dan Brown.\n\nIn Paris, Louvre’s Curator Jacques Saunière is murdered. Religious symbologist, Robert Langdon is summoned to examine the markings made on the old curator’s body. The secret message written on the floor turns out to be a Fibonacci series for which, a police cryptographer, Sophie Neveu is called upon.\n\nThings turn dirty here and Langdon and Sophie extricate the crime scene to solve the puzzle Jacques lay in front of them. There are bizarre riddles and a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci – clues that are bare for the naked eye to see and yet intelligently disguised to be found by those who are worth knowing the mystery.\n\nRobert and Sophie’s quest to unravel the truth leads them to catholic conspiracies in Vatican, exploring The last supper and Madonna of the rocks (works of Da Vinci), Theories and customs of Opus Dei and Priory of Sion. All this to reveal the one secret Jacques Saunière gave his life for. Astonishing revelations about Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo and some other big names. A secret which goes beyond time and which questions the very basics of Christianity.\n\nThe Lost Symbol\n\nFirst Published: 2009\n\nThe Lost Symbol is a thriller set in Washington, D.C., after the events of The Da Vinci Code, and relies on Freemasonry for both its recurring theme and its major characters. It is the third book in Robert Langdon Series by Dan Brown to involve the character of Harvard University symbologist Robert Langdon, following 2000’s Angels & Demons and 2003’s The Da Vinci Code.\n\nRenowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is invited to give a lecture at the United States Capitol, at the invitation apparently from his mentor, a 33rd degree Mason named Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Solomon has also asked him to bring a small, sealed package which he had entrusted to Langdon years earlier.\n\nWhen Langdon arrives at the Capitol, however, he learns that the invitation he received was not from Solomon, but from Solomon’s kidnapper, Mal’akh posing as Solomon’s assistant, who has left Solomon’s severed right hand in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda in a recreation of the Hand of Mysteries. Mal’akh then contacts Langdon, charging him with finding both the Mason’s Pyramid, which Masons believe is hidden somewhere in Washington, D.C., and the Lost Word, lest Solomon be murdered.\n\nRobert Langdon meets Trent Anderson, head of the Capitol police, and Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA’s Office of Security. Sato claims that Mal’akh poses a threat to the national security of the U.S. and that his capture is more important than Peter’s rescue, although she refuses to elaborate. Examining Solomon’s hand, they discover a clue leading them to Solomon’s Masonic altar in a room in the Capitol’s sub-basement, where they find a small pyramid lacking a capstone, with an inscription carved into it.\n\nInferno\n\nFirst Published: 2013\n\nInferno is the fourth in Dan Brown’s outstanding series of books featuring the character Robert Langdon. This novel is right up there with previous books in the Robert Langdon series and one of the finest Dan Brown books.\n\nInspired by the poem of the same name about a man’s journey into the depths of hell, the major focus of Inferno includes deciphering some mysterious lines that can only be solved by Robert’s intellect.\n\nAs my most anticipated book of 2013, Inferno did not disappoint. Despite a contrived beginning where Robert suffers from short term amnesia, the research conducted into a centuries old poem, the magnificent daydream setting of Florence, and the historical references of major artifacts is a literary feast for your senses.\n\nAs Dan Brown’s trademark, Inferno takes us through famous museums, old crypts and celebrated tourist spots, where Robert’s knowledge of symbolism, secret passages, and historical secrets may flourish.\n\nOrigin\n\nFirst Published: 2017\n\nThis book also starts with the same structure like his previous books by Dan Brown which focuses about the religion and the past; while this book speaks about the religion and the future. In here the author gives the answers to the most basic and important questions which are;\n\nWhere did we come from?\n\nWhere are we going?\n\nEdmond Kirsch, a billionaire philanthropist, computer scientist and futurist, as well as a strident atheist, attends a meeting in Catalonia with Roman Catholic Bishop Antonio Valdespino, Jewish Rabbi Yehuda Köves, and Muslim Imam Syed al-Fadl, three members of the Parliament of the World’s Religions.\n\nHe informs them that he has made a revolutionary discovery that he plans to release to the public in a month. He has chosen to inform them before the masses out of supposed respect, despite his well-known hatred of organized religion which he blames for his mother’s death. Horrified, the three learn that he is presenting it in three days’ time, prompting Valdespino to send him a voicemail demanding that he stop or risk being discredited."
