It is one of his best books -Deception Point is probably my least favourite.\n\nI've read pretty much all of Dan Brown's books. Digital Fortress was definitely a good read. His research into each subject really shows in his work. Deception Point was good too. I didn't like Angels and Demons that much, probably because I backtracked from Da Vinci Code and although they don't relate much, I just felt disconnected from it.\n\ni read digital fortress by dan brown it wass great suspense novel. it has alot of info on cryptography... amazing do read it.\n\nBest read? C'mon... it wasn't that good and it was his first novel."
