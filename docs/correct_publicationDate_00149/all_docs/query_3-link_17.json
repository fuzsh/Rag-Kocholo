        "text": "It’s about a code(digital fortress) that can’t be decrypted even by NSA’s super computer TRANSLTR. TRANSLTR encounters a code that seems to be unbreakable. So to get help with the code, commander Strathmore calls Susan Fletcher, the head cryptographer. The code is written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA’s employee.\n\nOn the other hand, Susan’s fiance, David Becker has gone to Seville to recover a ring that is suspected to have the code to unlock digital fortress. There he is followed by an assassin, who is in search for the passcode. Thus, harmlessly recovering a ring became a chase of life and death for him.\n\nIt is a mystery, thriller book.\n\nDan brown teleports you to the world of cryptography and code breaking. I was a stranger to cryptography but it written so nicely that I understood it easily. The story is all done in around 24 hours. Dan Brown has written the book so complicated that it took around 500 pages to tell a story of a just twenty four hour time span. It is a book that will make you to read more and more. You wouldn’t be able to put it down until the last page, an absolute page turner.\n\nWho will guard the guards?\n\nEnsei Tankado\n\nIt is said that in death, all things became clear.\n\nDan Brown\n\nYou can’t jump for stars if your feet hurt.\n\nDan Brown\n\nthere’s always others options.\n\nDan Brown\n\nRating : 4/5\n\nYou will want to read it until the last page\n\nRECOMMENDED!!!"
