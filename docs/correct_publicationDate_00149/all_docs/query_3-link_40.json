        "text": "Unabridged good but what was removed in this one?\n\nI listened to Audible's first publication of this book by Blackstone Audiobooks read by Patrick Cohen a few years ago. I enjoyed the book very much. That story was 12 hours and 52 minutes long. What was taken out of this version I do not know.\n\nJudging by the sample I heard of this version the narration in this version is superior to the Blackstone version but if the sample was taken from the beginning of the book then this version is lacking a lot. It is a good thriller and I would recommend the book. I'm not sure about this version as I didn't listen to it and I'm not inclined to buy the book again to find out but the unabridged version kept me entertained for a while.\n\nDisappointing\n\nAfter reading The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons this book was very disappointing. I read the other reviews warning as much first, but noted that The DaVinci Code also had similar reviews, so I figured I'd take my chances. It couldn't be THAT bad.\n\nOverall, I'd say it was a very average book. The narrator's voice sounded almost electronically simulated. For anyone who watches the series 24 and is fed up with the stupid \"Kim Bauer\" plotless plots to fill time, about half of this book is the same thing.\n\nI'm curious what was left out this \"abridged\" version because it did read fine. I don't know if I could have handled it being any longer!!!! Then again, maybe what was left out could have made it more enjoyable.\n\nPretty much average\n\nNothing spectacular here. Didn't seem to give you as much research learning as do Brown's other works. I enjoyed it overall, but it just didn't grab me. I had a high level of dislike for the reader. He was flat and annoying, especially with his role play voices - the worse I have ever heard.\n\nDo not listen to them!\n\nThose people, that give the book bad reviews aren't looking at the fact, that most people listen to audiobooks for fun, not to find as many plot holes as possible. This book may not have such a deep plot as Angels and Demons, but somehow it kept me listening. And I couldn't stop until I finished. And then, I listened to it again. By the way, this version has a way better narration, than the unabridged one."
