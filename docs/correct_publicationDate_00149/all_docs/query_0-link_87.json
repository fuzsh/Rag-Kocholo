        "text": "The Circle\n\nBy Dave Eggers,\n\nFrom my list on thrillers that highlight the benefits and risks of cutting-edge technology.\n\nBy Brian Kenneth Swain Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have been an avid reader for my entire life, as well as someone trained extensively in technology (master’s degree in electrical engineering). About twenty years ago, I became seriously drawn to writing and, quite naturally, gravitated toward technology-centric stories. Reading technology-based stories (novels and short stories) as well as nonfiction scientific articles provides a perpetual source of new ideas. And keeping up with the latest domestic and international news keeps me apprised of all the ways technology affects the world, for better and for worse.\n\nBrian's book list on thrillers that highlight the benefits and risks of cutting-edge technology\n\nWhy did Brian love this book?\n\nThis is easily Dave Eggers’ best novel. It is a terrific and fast-moving story of what can happen when rapidly developing technology combines with a leader who possesses a very loose moral sense and the ability to inculcate such morals in underlings.\n\nEggers is wonderful at creating believable characters who have a lot at stake from the story’s challenges and outcomes. In this case, the primary challenge is being forced to live in a world of round-the-clock surveillance of all one’s activities. The CEO bases his desire to create (and profit massively from) this world on the always-flawed notion that “if you’re not doing anything wrong, you should have no fear of being constantly surveilled.”\n\nThe most frightening aspect of the book is that the rapid advance of real-world technology makes the novel’s fundamental premise entirely plausible, indeed likely.\n\nBy Dave Eggers,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked The Circle as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE starring Tom Hanks, Emma Watson and John Boyega\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - a dark, thrilling and unputdownable novel about our obsession with the internet\n\n'Prepare to be addicted' Daily Mail\n\n'A gripping and highly unsettling read' Sunday Times\n\n'The Circle is 'Brave New World' for our brave new world... Fast, witty and troubling' Washington Post\n\nWhen Mae is hired to work for the Circle, the world's most powerful internet company, she feels she's been given the opportunity of a lifetime. Run out of a sprawling California campus, the Circle links users' personal emails,…\n\nPreview\n\nLittle Brother\n\nBy Cory Doctorow,\n\nFrom my list on technothrillers with accurate technology representation.\n\nBy Kat Wheeler Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m just a book-loving girl working in a corporate world who’s sick to death of the inaccurate representations of technology in fiction. FYI, tracing a phone call is instantaneous, no need to keep that pesky murderer on the line these days. Technology is so ingrained in our daily lives and most people have very limited knowledge of what it actually does, so I became fascinated with the idea of using real modern-day tech in murder mysteries. I got so obsessed with the idea I decided to write it. No Sci-Fi of future tech, it may seem farfetched, but all the electronic wizardry used in my novels is real and accurately represented.\n\nKat's book list on technothrillers with accurate technology representation\n\nWhy did Kat love this book?\n\nCory Doctorow, the champion of nerds everywhere really hit the nail on the head with his book about the state of current politics and society with Little Brother. This book was released in 2008 but seems truer to life now than ever. His protagonist Marcus, watches appalled as the government begins to strip away citizens' rights under the guise of our protection. This book has been called dystopian young adult fiction, but I disagree. It all feels very familiar to the current climate we live in. It can get a little preachy but regardless of your personal politics it’s a must-read for all.\n\nBy Cory Doctorow,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Little Brother as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 13, 14, 15, and 16.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMarcus, a.k.a \"w1n5t0n,\" is only seventeen years old, but he figures he already knows how the system works–and how to work the system. Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no trouble outwitting his high school's intrusive but clumsy surveillance systems.\n\nBut his whole world changes when he and his friends find themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to a secret prison where they're…\n\nPreview\n\nReady Player One\n\nBy Ernest Cline,\n\nFrom my list on science fiction books with an everyman hero.\n\nBy Dave Buschi Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up in a house of books. Bookcases in almost every room. At an early age, I discovered some great ones that were usually recommended by my dad. The Odyssey. Tarzan of the Apes. Princess of Mars. It is a long, long list, and I won’t give you all my faves—but one thing about it: I was drawn to books with heroes, particularly when those heroes were clearly good. There are no shades of gray for me. I like my heroes to have honor and humility and to always strive to do the right thing.\n\nDave's book list on science fiction books with an everyman hero\n\nWhy did Dave love this book?\n\nI love stories where the hero is a normal guy that we can all identify with in some way or another and where there is an arc to the story that transforms that normal guy into something extraordinary.\n\nWith just wits and creativity, our hero, Wade Watts, finds a way to survive against all odds. And no matter how bad things get, he never quits. He embodies the best of the human spirit—and by the end of the book, you’re cheering for him. Because he is you (or who you want to be), the \"everyman\" who stands up to injustice, unfairness, and those powers that are wrecking humanity (which in this case happens to be a trillion-dollar Mega Corporation).\n\nBy Ernest Cline,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n17 authors picked Ready Player One as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE DIRECTED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG\n\nIt's the year 2044, and the real world has become an ugly place.

Famine, poverty, and disease are widespread.\n\nLike most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes this depressing reality by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you can be anything you want to be, where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that…\n\nPreview\n\nJurassic Park\n\nBy Michael Crichton,\n\nFrom my list on science is trying to kill us all.\n\nBy Mark Terry Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nCurrently, the world seems concerned that artificial intelligence (AI) will destroy the world or at least put many of us out of jobs. Only a few years ago, a significant part of the population believed that COVID-19 was made in a Chinese laboratory and intentionally or accidentally leashed on the world, killing millions. This isn’t just a theme in tech thrillers; it’s a theme in life. Whether it’s nuclear weapons, genetic engineering, AI, or some other type of technology, there’s always a fear that it’ll do more damage than good and, at its worst, bring an end to the world.\n\nMark's book list on science is trying to kill us all\n\nWhy did Mark love this book?\n\nDue to all the films based on the book, everyone is probably very familiar with the story: a billionaire uses technology to bring dinosaurs back to life, creates a theme park, and dinosaurs run amuck.\n\nHere’s the thing: I read the book when it came out in 1990. At the time, I was working in a genetics laboratory. I was still 14 years away from writing full-time. I was even familiar with the research Crichton based the novel on. It was a 1982 research story about scientists who were able to collect DNA and other data from a fossil fly preserved in amber. So I, like everyone, was fascinated by the potential (and sort of kicking myself for not thinking of it first), even if, at that time, there were a few holes in Crichton’s technology.\n\nBut if you return to my original list of elements—exotic location, cutting-edge science, adventure,…\n\nBy Michael Crichton,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n17 authors picked Jurassic Park as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'Crichton's most compulsive novel' Sunday Telegraph\n\n'Crichton's dinosaurs are genuinely frightening' Chicago Sun-Times\n\n'Breathtaking adventure. . . a book that is as hard to put down as it is to forget' Time Out\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe international bestseller that inspired the Jurassic Park film franchise.\n\nOn a remote jungle island, genetic engineers have created a dinosaur game park.\n\nAn astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered.

Security Engineering isn’t a book (only) about cryptography, yet one about a topic that a cryptographer should know well: security engineering, or the design, implementation, and testing of systems that must be reliable in hostile and adversarial environments. Cryptography is indeed often just a small, yet critical, component of larger security systems. A good cryptographer must therefore not limit themselves to their field, but understand the risks, practical constraints, and functional needs of the environment where cryptography is integrated. Anderson’s book is the undisputed reference in that space.\n\nBy Ross Anderson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Security Engineering as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNow that there's software in everything, how can you make anything secure?
