        "text": "Hi there music junkie! Welcome to my list of music genres.\n\nIs my music genres list totally exhaustive? Well, it will be to some, but maybe not to others.\n\nSay you think that ‘Dutch New Wave Psyc-Rock’ should be considered a genre, even though there are only three bands that ever made that stuff, you will say it’s not exhaustive.\n\nBut if you’re kind of semi-sane, well, yes, this list of music genres is pretty exhaustive.\n\nI’ve tried my best to remove the kind of dryness of a long list by adding some thoughts of my own.\n\nYou may not agree with some of the things I say, but hey, this is music, we all have our own thoughts and opinions, and I would love it if you add yours to the comments at the end.\n\nI hope you enjoy this list of music genres as much as I enjoyed putting it together.\n\nList of Music Genres\n\nI haven’t put this list of music genres together in order of personal preferences and favourites.\n\nIt’s simply in good old-fashioned alphabetical order.\n\nAfrobeat\n\nAfrobeat blends West African musical styles with American funk and jazz influences.\n\nOriginating in the 1960s and 1970s in West Africa, primarily Nigeria and Ghana, Afrobeat compositions often feature a complex fusion of large ensembles…\n\n…including a wide range of percussion, like the talking drum, as well as brass instruments, keyboards, and guitars.\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second; “the talking drum?” What on earth is the talking drum?\n\nAnd so now you know!\n\nAfrobeat songs often contain lengthy musical grooves with vocal chants and call-and-response style lyrics.\n\nTwo of the two most influential Afrobeat musicians are Fela Kuti and drummer Tony Allen, who both played foundational roles in the genre’s creation and popularisation.\n\nMany of Fela Kuti’s songs were politically charged, addressing social issues, and challenging oppressive governmental regimes in Nigeria.\n\nLike all music genres worth their salt, modern variations of Afrobeat have emerged, some blending the style with other genres like hip-hop and electronica.\n\nAmbient\n\nAmbient is a pretty loosely defined genre. It can be created using elements from a number of different genres and styles, including classical, jazz, sounds from nature, and many others.\n\nThere is rarely any kind of persistent beat, or definite direction, to ambient music. Instead it tends to ebb and flow with the intention of creating a calming atmosphere and mood.\n\nAmbient music is sometimes produced using acoustic instruments, but it is more often created using synthesizers and digital audio workstations (DAWs).\n\nHere are a few examples of of ambient music:\n\nBrian Eno – ‘Who Are We’\n\nMoby – ‘Porcelain’\n\nSigur Ros – ‘Olson Olson’\n\nBaroque\n\nThe word ‘baroque’ comes from the Portuguese term ‘barroco’, which translates into English as “oddly shaped pearl”.\n\nThis name was given to it because the music critics of the time, believed it to be exaggerated and overly ornamented, which was a little bit rude if you ask me, bet hey, we are talking about art critics.\n\nBaroque music tends to sit within the wider genre of classical music, and more specifically refers to Western European art music from the period between approximately 1600 to 1750.\n\nYou may not be too sure as to whether you like baroque music or not. But take a minute to have a listen to the YouTube recording below, and tell me if it doesn’t elevate your soul.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of baroque music:\n\nAntonio Vivaldi – ‘The Four Seasons’\n\nJ.S. Bach – ‘Jesu, Joy Of Man’s Desiring’\n\nBachata\n\nDating back to the early twentieth century, bachata is Latin-American, originating in the Dominican Republic.\n\nIt derived from Spanish guitar music and the slower-tempo bolero sound which made it’s way over from Cuba.\n\nBachata music is slow, with romantic and often bittersweet lyrics.\n\nBachata is also a Latin dance style, and as you would expect it is danced to the sound of bachata music.\n\nBhangra\n\nBhangra, what modern-day list of music genres would not include it?\n\nHigh-energy beats and rhythm with harmonious vocals, lively and joyous. You know the stuff.\n\nSince its earliest days, it has been fused with a number of modern musical styles and has successfully found its way around the globe.\n\nOriginating from the Punjab region of India and Pakistan, Bhangra was a popular celebratory folk dance that welcomed the coming of Spring, or Vaisakhi.\n\nHere’s a little bit of Bhangra that should put a smile on your face:\n\nBlues\n\nBlues is an African-American music developed in the American south during the mid-1800’s.\n\nIt is the foundation of much American popular music, especially jazz.\n\nThe blues has many definitions because it’s a type of music that can have different musical structures.\n\nSome blues musicians play the 12-bar blues, while others like to play the 16-bar blues.\n\nWhichever it is, the blues sound tends to be that of a harmonic language, following a repetitive musical structure.\n\nBlues musicians and blues fans see it as an attitude towards playing music…a feeling, more than defined musical structure.\n\nSo I guess a talented blues musician could take almost any piece of music, regardless of its original genre, and make is sound ‘bluesy’.\n\nAnd now here’s something to make you feel bluesy:\n\nRobert Johnson – ‘Crossroads’\n\nBrazilian\n\nBrazilian music is a very broad term because we’re talking about something that embraces several regional musical styles.\n\nAnd each of these regional styles has influences from either Europe, America, Africa etc.\n\nThe broad genre of Brazilian music is really an umbrella for all of the following musical genres, and more:\n\nBossa Nova\n\nSamba\n\nPagode\n\nFunk\n\nSertanejo\n\nChorinho\n\nMúsica Popular Brasileira (MPB)\n\nForró\n\nAxé\n\nContemporary Christian\n\nContemporary Christian music is always written with lyrics inspired by the Holy Bible and the life of Jesus Christ.\n\nIt tends to gently explore themes such as platonic love, kindness, patience, forgiveness etc.\n\nCCM started in the 1960’s with the idea of introducing more modern instruments into religious services.\n\nUsually composed with a very repetitive, upbeat rhythm, and few lyrics often repeated.\n\nClassical\n\nTaking the absolute broadest approach, all music can basically be grouped into three major categories: classical, popular and folk music.\n\nI haven’t just made that up, it is fact…fact-o-mundo!\n\nThe first green shoots of classical music began way back in the 9th century.\n\nAt that time it was a further development Western Christian sacred music traditions.\n\nKnown for its instrumental complexities, it became more established between the 16th and 18th centuries.\n\nWith very few exceptions, classical music tends to require significant training or musical literacy in order to be able to perform it.\n\nNowadays it is usually played in concert halls and opera houses.\n\nBut with that said, it still permeates our lives through TV and radio commercials, film scores, TV soundtracks and a number of other mediums.\n\nIt’s an odd thing that many people will sometimes say that thy don’t like classical music. It’s such a broad genre that it’s almost impossible to apply a blanket opinion.\n\nHere are a few well known examples of classical music:\n\nLudwig van Beethoven – ‘Symphony No. 5 in C Minor’\n\nAaron Copland – ‘Appalachian Spring’\n\nJ.S. Bach – ‘Suite No. 1 in G Major’\n\nCountry\n\nCountry music used to be called Hillbilly music, the music of the working class in the southern states of America, making their living off the fat of the land.\n\nBy adults, for adults, and about adults. Country music tends to weave a tale of broken hearts, destroyed lives, redemption (but only sometimes). In short…melodrama.\n\nThe similarities between country music and blues music is astounding. They both revolve around being hard-working, being poor, but most of all…having a hurting soul,\n\nWhat music influenced the original country sound?\n\nMost think it was a mix of Mexican, African-American, possibly even Irish and Scottish to some extent.\n\nHere are a few country numbers you might be familiar with:\n\nTim McGraw – ‘Humble and Kind’\n\nJohnny Cash – ‘Hurt’\n\nCarrie Underwood – ‘Before He Cheats’\n\nDolly Parton and Kenny Rogers – ‘Islands in the Stream’\n\nI hope you enjoyed that four minutes of Dolly and Kenny as much as I did.\n\nDisco\n\nDisco was the original ‘dance music’. It changed the nightclub scene forever. Changed the way DJ’s, well, DJ’d.\n\nIt shot to prominence in the ’70s but was to be one of the shortest-lived musical crazes of all time.\n\nBut it’s influence still runs deep, real deep.\n\nThe structure of disco music will be very familiar with lovers of house music, and it was this that made the disco sound so effortlessly danceable.\n\nIt’s produced with a four-to-the-floor structure, which is a beat in four-four time (four beats in a bar, four bars in a phrase) and with the bass drum hit on every beat in common time.\n\nSynthesizers, rhythm guitars, string sections, electric pianos, and syncopated bass lines would be layered over the top of this pretty uniform underlying structure.\n\nDisco suffered from having a lot of haters. New York even saw a Disco Demolition night held at one of it’s parks, where people brought along disco records to destroy.\n\nElectronic Dance\n\nElectronic Dance Music (EDM), the grown up, direct descendent of disco.\n\nEDM is produced using a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). Plus also maybe additional synthesizers and/or drum machines.\n\nAnd it’s a huge genre that has almost no end of sub-genres within it’s sphere.\n\nHere are a just a few of them:\n\nBreakbeat\n\nDrum & Bass\n\nDubstep\n\nGabba\n\nGarage\n\nHouse\n\nHip Hop\n\nJungle\n\nTechno\n\nTrance\n\nUK Garage\n\nWhen you consider that each of the above also have sub-genres of their own, you start to get the picture of just how huge the broad EDM genre is.\n\nI can’t really give you a musical structure of EDM, because each of it’s sub-genres tend to have their own unique sound structure.\n\nHave a listen to a couple of these examples of just how different the structure of EDM can be.\n\nHere’s a bit of house:\n\nLarry Heard Presents Mr. White – ‘The Sun Can’t Compare’\n\nHere’s some trance:\n\nArt Of Trance – ‘Madagascar’ (Ferry Corsten Remix)\n\nAnd this is dubstep:\n\nBenga & Coki – ‘Night’\n\nEmo\n\nEmo, is a kind of melded sub-genre of rock and punk…but with all the life and fun squeezed out of it.\n\nFirst spawned in the ’80s it grew to be pretty popular (but let’s pretend it wasn’t popular because the Emo’s wouldn’t like that) through the ’90s and into the ’00s.\n\nEmo is short for ’emotional’.\n\nEmo music lyrics tend to be about the rejection of mainstream culture, social isolation, depression, and loneliness.\n\nFlamenco\n\nFlamenco is a Spanish style of music and dance.\n\nThe term ‘Flamenco’ actually refers to a broader art form developed in Andalusia in southern Spain, which comprises three disciplines: baile (dance), toque (guitar playing) and cante (song).\n\nFlamenco lyrics tend to draw on feelings of heartache, joy, tragedy, jubilation, amongst others.\n\nThe music of flamenco is usually quite brief and simply composed.\n\nFolk\n\nHow you think of folk music will probably be quite dependent on where you live and where you come from.\n\nFirst, there is what I believe to be the more accurate belief; that folk music is actually similar to what’s known as ‘traditional’ music.\n\nAnd that is to say that folk music has an unbreakable tie to it’s own place and community. It’s sound and structure can be very different from place to place, but it’s the folk music of that place or community.\n\nThe second belief is that folk music is a certain style of music, with a pretty recognisable structure and sound, that arose in the United States during the 1960s.\n\nBut I suppose whatever the structure and characteristics of the sound, or where it comes from, folk music is definitely all about storytelling.\n\nStories about friendships, relationships, love, nature etc.\n\nStories that define us as a people, and as a community, whether that be on a local or global scale.\n\nFunk\n\nBorn in the United States during the ’60s, Funk enjoyed it’s heyday throughout the ’70s.\n\nWith a rich range of influences, including r&b, soul, gospel, blues, it’s a sound that itself still runs through a great deal of modern chart music.\n\nA leading characteristic of funk is that the bass-line is brought to the fore, with the melody sitting slightly behind it.\n\nThis puts the emphasis of a track firmly on it’s rhythm, which is why funk is known for being so easily danceable.\n\nDo you love funk?\n\nGospel\n\nGospel music as a genre of it’s own, has it’s origins in the christian churches of the African-American community.\n\nGospel itself was influenced from a number of music styles such as christian hymns, jazz, blues, amongst others.\n\nAnd it has in-turn influenced much 20th and 21st century music. Soul music, motown, r&b have all been influenced by the sound of gospel.\n\nA quite astounding number of hugely successful recording artists come from a background of gospel.\n\nGrunge\n\nA subgenre of alternative rock out of the late 1980s that became massively popular in the 1990s.\n\nIt’s rooted in Seattle, Washington, USA, and is often associated with the city’s music scene.\n\nKnown for its “dirty” guitar sound, heavy use of guitar distortion and feedback, and a fusion of punk rock energy with heavy metal’s weight.\n\nThe lyrics are often introspective, addressing themes like social alienation, apathy, confinement, and a desire for freedom.\n\nThe grunge movement also had a distinctive look. Band members often wore flannel shirts, torn jeans, and combat boots, giving a rugged, unkempt appearance.\n\nSome of the most iconic grunge bands include Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains. Nirvana, led by frontman Kurt Cobain, is often hailed as the most influential, especially after the release of their hit song “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”\n\nWhile grunge’s massive popularity waned by the late 1990s, it changed the direction of rock music and influenced many subsequent rock bands.\n\nGrunge was more than just music; it was a cultural movement that rejected the excesses and artificialities of the 1980s. It resonated with the youth of the time, reflecting their disillusionment and desire for something more “real”.\n\nTime for a bit of Nirvana’s “Come As You Are”?\n\nIndian Classical\n\nIndian classical music originated in South Asia, born from the ancient Indians becoming captivated by the spiritual power of music.\n\nThe music has a contemplative and spiritual nature and draws inspiration from the phenomena of the natural world, such as the days dawn, nightfall, the four seasons etc.\n\nTending to be a solitary pursuit, many people enjoy Indian classical music for its meditative and uplifting qualities.\n\nThe primary instruments of Indian classical music are the Sitar, Tabla, Veena, Mridangam, and the voice.\n\nIndie\n\nThere’s no absolute definition of indie.\n\nThe terms ‘indie rock’ and indie band’ came simply from describing the music coming out of independent music labels during the 1970s.\n\nSo at the outset, indie was open to all sorts of musical interpretations.\n\nBut by the late ’90s it had come to define itself more precisely, as by this time it was the name given to a style of guitar rock with a more basic, stripped-back feel.\n\nMuse are probably as good an example of an indie band as any, so here they are:\n\nJazz\n\nThere is no way you can compile a list of music genres list without including jazz, which has influenced so many other music genres over the years.\n\nJazz is very hard to define, partly because there is no end of sub-genres, and partly because jazz breaks every rule of music.\n\nCommon characteristics of jazz tend to be complex harmonies, improvisation, precise communication between band members when performing (because of the extensive improvisation that takes place) and musical iteration.\n\nI like everything to be neat and tidy all the time, so my mind that loves order struggles to really enjoy jazz.\n\nI appreciate jazz, and I admire jazz musicians, but I need to chill more in order to properly get it.\n\nMerengue\n\nMerengue is equally a music genre and a style of dance, originating in the Dominican Republic.\n\nMerengue music tends to be performed using a number of instruments, including tambora, güira, trumpet, saxophone, accordion, keyboards,bass guitar/\n\nMerengue music often includes a singer and the lyrics tend to be light-hearted and fun.\n\nMetal\n\nMetal music. The ADHD spawn of rock, and in-turn, the mother of it’s own delinquent child ‘heavy metal’.\n\nThe sound of metal is that of aggressive vocals, distorted guitars, low-range bass, and powerful, often frenetic drumming.\n\nDeveloped in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States, with Black Sabbath being widely considered the the founders of the sound.\n\nMetal’s own spawn, heavy metal, went on to birth it’s own deviant children, or musical sub-genres, if you prefer, namely:\n\nThrash metal\n\nPower metal\n\nBlack metal\n\nGlam metal\n\nDeath metal\n\nMotown\n\nI could very easily go on and on about motown…because I love it!\n\nIf that’s what you want then just go directly to my ‘What is Motown‘ post.\n\nBut if you don’t have the time for that, let’s try and explain it within this list of music genres in a couple of sentences.\n\nMotown has deep roots in the music of soul, gospel and r&b.\n\nIt is defined by a solid backbeat, upbeat tempo, melodic instruments and equally melodic and powerful vocal performances.\n\nHere’s one of my all-time favourite motown tracks:\n\nNew Age\n\nSoothing, mood-lifting, relaxing, these are all very common terms use to describe new-age music.\n\nNew age music is gentle melodies played on instruments like the harp, piano, flute, guitar, organ etc.\n\nIt’s is quite common for new age music to incorporate sounds from nature, and where there are vocals, they ten not to be actual lyrics, but more floaty harmonies and sounds.\n\nLike this sort of thing:\n\nNew Wave\n\nI love new wave, but it’s far from easy to clearly define as a genre.\n\nNew wave appeared in the late ’70s, with a similar attitude to punk, but less angry, less political, and definitely more fun and tongue-in-cheek.\n\nThat said, new wave bands carried with them the same individuality and irreverence, and the sound, while very different, was itself often edgy.\n\nPreferred instruments of new wave bands, were guitars, synthesizers, drums, sometimes a trumpet or something similar.\n\nXTC, Gary Numan, Blondie, Talking Heads, Teardrop Explodes. These are all new wave artists that defined the scene in the late ’70s and early ’80s.\n\nHere’s XTC performing Sergeant Rock on Top of the Pops in 1981:\n\nYou’ll have noticed from the video, that this was filmed at a time when it was deemed necessary for singers to mime along to their own lyrics, for almost all TV studio performances.\n\nThis was a totally bizarre phenomena that went on for a few years. A real shame because singers such as XTC’s Andy Partridge were more than capable of delivering strong live vocal performances.\n\nNorthern Soul\n\nIt’s Northern England.\n\nIt’s the late 1960s.\n\nThe youth are finding the American and British chart music currently dominating the radio waves, as well as the late-night scene, pretty uninspiring.\n\nThey started searching for a more exciting sound…\n\n…and they found it!\n\nNorthern Soul was a cultural movement, more than simply a music genre, so the music varied widely.\n\nBut the music always tended to have a syncopated beat and was more often than not a melded combination of American soul and motown.\n\nUp-beat, fast-paced, driving rhythmic beats, powerful soulful vocals.\n\nHere’s a nailed-on northern soul classic for you to enjoy:\n\nOpera\n\nOpera is linked to a form of theatre where the story is told through the musical performances.\n\nThe actors/singers sing the lines of the story. And of course, because opera relies on extremely powerful vocal delivery, the actors are very talented operatic singers.\n\nOpera music composers include Wagner, Verdi, and Mozart.\n\nPop\n\nWhat is the definition of pop music?\n\nTrying to answer that questions causes endless disagreement amongst music lovers.\n\nThe genre is huge. What even is the genre? Is it the same as ‘popular’ music.\n\nYou can find out what I think in this whole article I wrote about ‘What is Pop Music…Exactly!’\n\nPunk\n\nIn my opinion, music needed punk, when it came along kicking and screaming in 1976.\n\nNot that there was anything wrong with the music that the ’70s was serving up.\n\nBut punk kind of threw everything up in the air, and when it all landed, there was creative space for people to take different musical directions.\n\nBasically a sub-genre of rock, punk is quicker and less complex, more directly and intentionally anti-establishment.\n\nWhen I sat less complex, that’s probably a bit of an understatement, as punk is pretty minimalist, rarely venturing further than three-chords, a furious beat and vocals\n\nReggae\n\nSka, blue-beat, rocksteady, these three Jamaican music styles, each of course having their own far-reaching musical influences, provided the fertile soil from which the green shoots of the reggae sound would first appear.\n\nSomewhere around 1969 the development of reggae as a sound of it’s own began.\n\nMore vocals and lyrics, prominent organs, rhythmic instruments, skank guitars, nothing too dissimilar to ska and rocksteady on the face of it, but the sound was definitely changing.\n\nBy the mid ’70s the sound had developed into what we would now instantly recognise as reggae.\n\nSongs with lyrics addressing political issues and calling for social change. The music now using minor keys and a slower tempo, as well as rock style guitars.\n\nOf course we can’t not listen to a little bit of the late, great Bob Marley…and in 432hz too!\n\nR&B (Rhythm & Blues)\n\nR&B music dates back to the 1940s, where it has it’s roots in the African-American communities.\n\nWhile it is closely related to soul, gospel, jazz, it is even more so to blues.\n\nKey characteristics are that it is very vocal genre, often powerful solo singers, or sometimes vocal groups.\n\nR&B does tend to get used as a blanket term to describe any number of other popular music genres, particularly soul and funk.\n\nHere’s a quick shot of contemporary r&b, Rihanna style:\n\nRock\n\nRock music is a broad style and genre, with its first origins in the USA and the United Kingdom towards the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nVery generally, rock music has a 4/4 time signature and a song with a verse/chorus structure.\n\nIt tends to be hard-edged and performed with a strong emphasis on electric lead guitars, bass and drums.\n\nAnd of course, rock music is well known for having powerful vocal performances.\n\nRock music has certainly stood the test of time, but its history has been unpredictable and at times volatile.\n\nMaybe it’s because of this that the genre has been able to constantly evolve, redefine and reinvent itself.\n\nRock ‘n Roll\n\nA genre that emerged in the 1950s and laid the foundation for rock music.\n\nKnown for its energetic and upbeat sound, often characterised by strong rhythms, simple melodies, and the use of electric guitar.\n\nRock n’ Roll evolved from rhythm and blues, gospel, country, and jazz. The cultural mixing pot of the United States, especially in the South, played a significant role in its emergence.\n\nDefined by its strong backbeat, driven by the slap bass technique and later the electric bass, and its distinctive electric guitar riffs.\n\nSongs often followed the traditional verse-chorus structure and utilized the 12-bar blues progression. Lyrics were simple, often revolving around love, dancing, freedom, and the exuberance of youth.\n\nSome of the pioneering figures of Rock n’ Roll include Chuck Berry (“Johnny B. Goode”), Little Richard (“Tutti Frutti”), and Buddy Holly (“That’ll Be the Day”).\n\nWe certainly can’t ignore that man often called the “King of Rock n’ Roll”, Elvis Presley, who was one of the most iconic figures of the genre with hits like “Heartbreak Hotel” and “Hound Dog”.\n\nRock n’ Roll set the groundwork for various rock sub-genres, including hard rock, with its DNA found in several other music genres, from soul to pop to punk.\n\nRock n’ Roll was transformative and reshaped the cultural and musical landscape of the 20th century.\n\nRocksteady\n\nOriginating in Jamaica in roughly 1966, Rocksteady was a natural successor to ska and a forerunner to reggae.\n\nRocksteady has similar recognisable elements to those of ska; walking bass-line, off-beat guitar chops and rhythms etc.\n\nThat said, rocksteady doesn’t tend to be played at quite the same quick pace as ska.\n\nWhat do you think of this slice of rocksteady:\n\nDo you LOVE it?\n\nSalsa\n\nSalsa is a melded blend of musical styles and rhythms.\n\nThe genre’s roots are from the Afro-Spanish music of Cuba.\n\nIt has influences from mambo, cha-cha-chá and Cuban rumba.\n\nAnd to a lesser extent, also from merengue, calypso.\n\nSka\n\nHow did ska come to be?\n\nWell, it’s both complicated, and not at all complicated.\n\nIf you try to explain it, being born out of elements of Caribbean mento and calypso, with influences from American jazz and rhythm and blues…\n\n…it starts to seem pretty complicated. Like a committee of old men sat down and deliberated over its invention.\n\nBut it doesn’t seem anywhere near as complicated when you say that it just happened, in Jamaica, in the late 1950s.\n\nThat sounds much less complicated and exciting.\n\nAnd that’s why ska got so popular so quickly, because it just happened, and it was exciting.\n\nSka is quick, it’s upbeat. With it’s walking bass-line, drum-beats on the second and fourth beats, four/four time structure, guitar chops on the off-beat…it’s made for dancing…even for people who can’t usually dance!\n\nTypical arrangement of a ska band would be vocals, bass guitar, lead guitar, keyboard, trombone, trumpet, drums…sax sometimes.\n\nWillis Jackson – ‘Later for the Gator’\n\nMillie Small – ‘My Boy Lollipop’\n\nDerrick Morgan – ‘Forward March’\n\nPrince Buster – ‘Madness’\n\nListen to this and tell me, tell me, tell me, that it doesn’t make you feel like dancing.\n\nThe Specials – ‘Pressure Drop’\n\nNo? I don’t believe you!\n\nSoul\n\nSoul music came directly from both traditional blues and gospel music.\n\nSoul was born in the ’50s and ’60s and became internationally popular within a decade.\n\nSoul is defined by blues harmonies, gospel traditions, skilled musicians and powerful vocals.\n\nSoul music is a critical genre in musical history. If it were not for Soul, we would not have so many other musical genres that we love.\n\nYou can read my whole article all about ‘What is Soul Music‘, if you like.\n\nOr just enjoy listening to this perfectly crafted gem:\n\nSwing\n\nSwing is a sub-genre of jazz that came from African-American origin.\n\nIt dominated the American popular music scene between roughly 1930 and 1945 to the extent that these years are often referred to as the ‘Swing Era’.\n\nSwing tends to be played by big bands has a unique rhythm and feel.\n\nAccentuating the beats two and four, and replacing the steady eighth note with a swinging eighth note.\n\nA walking bass line with layered accents and syncopation completes what people recognise as the sound of swing.\n\nSwing was so popular and lent itself so easily to getting up and dancing that whole new dances evolved from it, such as the jitterbug and the lindy-hop.\n\nGlenn Miller Band – ‘Strings of Pearls’\n\nCab Calloway – ‘Minnie the Moocher’\n\nDuke Ellington – ‘Perdido’\n\nTraditional\n\nMany global regions and communities have their own traditional music.\n\nAs far as the sound is concerned, it can literally be anything, because the term ‘traditional music’ does not define any specific musical structure, or sound.\n\nTraditional music is any music that has its own deep roots in a geographical region and/or community.\n\nMusic Genres List\n\nIf you simply can’t be bothered with my thoughts and opinions…\n\n…here’s just a cold list of music genres with none of the other stuff:\n\nWrap Up!\n\nThere you go, all done and dusted, my hand-curated list of music genres.\n\nYou may love some of these music genres, and you may dislike some.\n\nBut never try to tell anybody else what music they should like or dislike.\n\nMusic is art, and the appreciation of art is completely subjective. Different strokes for different folks."
