        "text": "Peter Hook launched the Light in 2010 to celebrate the life of former Joy Division bandmate Ian Curtis with a live performance of \"Unknown Pleasures\" in full on the 30th anniversary of the singer's death.\n\n\"As it happens, it wasn’t received well,\" the bassist recalls. \"But the great thing is that we’ve gone on to prove our doubters wrong, and we’ve built up a hell of a following.\"\n\nCurtis' bandmates — Bernard Sumner, Hook and Stephen Morris — soldiered on after his death, reinventing themselves as New Order, with Gillian Gilbert rounding out the lineup.\n\nNew Order would go on to prove a hugely influential — and commercially successful — player on the post-punk scene on the strength of such synth-driven dance hits as \"Blue Monday\" and \"Confusion.\"\n\nAt the same time, Joy Division's stature continued to grow, its cult expanding.\n\nNew Order has broken up twice — in 1993 and again in 2007. When they reunited four years later, Hook was not invited to the party.\n\nBy that point, he'd started the Light.\n\n\"And once I started celebrating Joy Division,\" he says, \"I just felt that it would be a great idea for me to play every song I ever wrote and recorded before I die.\"\n\nHook laughs, then adds, \"Or before Putin gets me. Before Putin gets all of us. It was Kim Jong-un, now it’s Putin, isn’t it? So yeah, I’m well along the way and hopefully I will achieve my dream.\"\n\nThe tour that makes its way to the Van Buren May 17 finds him playing two singles collections called \"Substance,\" one by each group.\n\nHe's especially pleased to be bringing the tour to Phoenix.\n\n\"New Order actually started our first big tour in Phoenix,\" he says.\n\n\"I’ll never forget it. It was such a fantastic gig. An open-air amphitheater with a moat in front of it. This was in 1981 or ’82. I remember having a wonderful time swimming in the mountains with the fish nibbling at me toes.\"\n\nHere's what else the post-punk legend had to say in the course of a nearly 30-minute conversation that touches on the books he's written and the films that have been made about his life.\n\nQuestion: I just listened to both “Substance” albums and it’s striking how different the opening tracks on each collection are. I know “Ceremony” started as a Joy Division song but even beyond the fact that Ian isn’t on the record, it’s so far removed from where you’d started three years earlier.\n\nAnswer: The interesting thing about the records is that “Substance” by New Order is a collection of very commercial singles that weren’t available on LPs. So at the time, it was a very successful record. And it cost us nothing.\n\nTony Wilson, the head of Factory, it was his idea to get all the singles so he could play them in his car because his car had a CD player. And it was the biggest-selling New Order record ever.\n\nThat gave us the opportunity to do the same for Joy Division. And the two LPs couldn’t contrast more. Joy Division is very intense and quite dark, and the New Order one is very light, very poppy, very commercial.\n\nIt’s great to play them together, actually. And it’s gone absolutely fantastic. It’s a long concert. Three hours from start to finish, so I’ve become a bit of a Bruce Springsteen.\n\nQ: You formed Joy Division after seeing a Sex Pistols concert in Manchester. Did you identify as a punk at that point?\n\nA: Someone was asking me about why I became a musician. And I didn’t really become a musician at first. What I became was a punk. And punk to me at that time was about telling the world to f--k off.\n\nIt expressed the outrage, the confusion and the anger that you felt as a teenager — which, you know, I was when I saw them. And it seemed to fit with how you felt. I wasn’t really interested in any way musically. I became a musician after punk.\n\nPunk faded away, and I became more of a musician. So it was interesting to be as highly regarded as we all are as musicians and as influences on other musicians when neither I nor Bernard started it for music.\n\nWe just wanted to be punk and do what the Pistols were doing, which we didn’t really understand, I have to say.\n\nQ: You moved on pretty quickly from the punkish sound of the early material and I was wondering what led to that shift in sound. Was it because, as you said, punk was fading away?\n\nA: No. It was literally as we grew as musicians. From starting in June of ’76, by June of ’77, we were writing “An Ideal for Living” and the songs that would become “Unknown Pleasures.”\n\nSo in those six months to a year, our songwriting and our musicianship grew exponentially. It was very exciting. Every time we practiced or played, we'd write another song that we were just immensely proud of. It wasn’t a struggle.\n\nThe struggle for us was getting concerts and getting to a position where you could be, I suppose, deemed to be successful as a group.\n\nWHY SO SERIOUS?\n\nQ: You mentioned the darkness of the Joy Division material. Were you that dark and serious in real life?\n\nA: No, I mean, if you read the Joy Division book, you can see that we were very normal (laughs) kids. We were very serious about the music. But we weren’t particularly serious about ourselves. As kids, we were quite normal.\n\nIt was quite a contradiction, really, because people had this image of us as being very dark and aloof and mysterious, and really we were just normal 21-year-old kids.\n\nIan had some wonderful interests, but really, you were out drinking and clubbing and just being young. It was still very important to you.\n\nQ: You mentioned starting this project to shine a light on Ian and celebrate his life. Do you have any favorite memories of him?\n\nA: As I said, my book is full of memories of him. The thing is, Ian was our biggest fan.\n\nIt was very difficult, at that point, being in a group. And he was always the one that inspired you and told you everything was gonna be all right. He’d pick you up by the scruff of the neck if you started to fall or falter.\n\nHe was unlike any other lead singer that I’ve ever met. He was more interested in you singing. He was just a very generous human being who became a very firm friend and wonderful colleague, a very inspiring leader, actually.\n\nI’ve never had anybody who was as good at leading since him. So my memory, or the torch that I carry for him, is very pure and still burns very brightly.\n\nAnd the most wonderful thing is that I’ve been able to get this Joy Division material around the world not once, not twice, but three, four, five times.\n\nI think he would be immensely proud for me to play that music as a complement to him and to Bernard and to Stephen in places like Brazil and North America. We’ve been to some amazing places. And it’s because of him, because of Joy Division’s work.\n\nWe never made it to America as a group. We were only professional for six months. We really were nipped in the bud. The second album was released posthumously, and we never got to enjoy it. So in a funny way, I’ve managed to grab a little bit of the magic.\n\nQ: Did you see New Order when it started as the next step in the evolution of what you’d been doing or ground zero for a whole new thing?\n\nA: Well, no, New Order came out of the grief, really, and the panic that we felt because we didn’t want to go back to work. We didn’t want to stop playing music. We were desperate to carry on. And I think that desperation worked.\n\nAnd putting Joy Division to one side in a cupboard, putting it in a box in the back of the wardrobe, actually helped because it made you very focused on the new music, on the new group. And you were able to make New Order very, very successful in a way that Joy Division never were.\n\nBut Joy Division has caught up. They've been neck and neck for years and years and years. Joy Division is just as well known as New Order were.\n\nIt’s amazing to pull it off once, even though you didn’t get to enjoy it much, but then to be able to pull it off again was incredible.\n\nTo change music once as we did as we did with Joy Division and be so highly regarded and then to do it again with New Order in a completely different way, yeah, me and Bernard were very lucky to go to that Sex Pistols concert (laughs).\n\n'THERE WAS A BIT OF RESISTANCE'\n\nQ: You mentioned that there was a bit of resistance when you started this project to you performing the Joy Division material.\n\nA: Yeah. I mean, the keyboard terrorists that we all know and love were out in full force. And the thing is, it was a delight, really, to prove them wrong or maybe to put their minds at rest and show that you had the right intentions to play music.\n\nMy gimmick, if you like, is not to be a copy of the group the way that, in my opinion, New Order are today. It’s about playing the LPs and celebrating the records. We put so much work into them and it’s a little bit underestimated and undervalued in many ways.\n\nIt struck me that most people had heard Joy Division on record much more than they had ever heard them live.\n\nThere are reasons you don’t play some tracks on LPs, because they’re just too difficult to play. But I don’t have the opportunity to pass it by. I have to play every track. And it’s been great, actually.\n\nIt’s more difficult for me. It’s more difficult for the group. In some ways, it’s more difficult for the audience. But I do think that people appreciate that you’re not passing yourself off as Joy Division in the same way that you’re not passing yourself off as New Order.\n\nYou’re actually celebrating music that you love. And I do love it. I’m both bands’ biggest fan. Unashamedly.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE FANS?\n\nQ: Do you find that most of the fans embrace both groups? Or are there camps?\n\nA: I think there were camps. I think that’s what’s happened is over the years they’ve been blurred. And the things is that our fans get two bites of the cherry, don’t they? They get New Order doing what New Order do and they get me playing the rest of the tracks.\n\nI’m delighted to be playing, this time, a song that we never played, never even recorded properly actually, called “Too Late.” And also another song called \"Turn the Heater On,\" which we played as an homage to Ian, because it was his favorite reggae song, by Keith Hudson.\n\nI spotted it and thought, \"Right, we’ve got to put that right.\" I can’t be saying I’ve done every track we’ve ever written and recorded and miss those two, so we’ve got those two going, and it will be the first time either of those two have ever been played live.\n\nIt certainly makes you work for your supper, shall we say.\n\nQ: You talked about New Order being out there doing what they’re doing. Could you talk a bit about why you’re not involved in that project at this point.\n\nA: They decided to get the group together without me. I think that’s very well-reported. And as much as I didn’t agree with their decisions at the time, financially or otherwise, it’s all documented in my \"Substance: Inside New Order\" book.\n\nSo you can read about it there. And the court cases we had going have been settled. So we were able to at least get on with what we both do. So no, I suppose I don’t really have to talk about it. I think everybody knows what happened (laughs).\n\nAnd if they don’t, please buy my book, which will be on sale at the concert. It certainly wasn’t either of our finest moments, I will have to say. But it’s quite par for the course for groups (laughs). Groups are always doing it.\n\nI think it’s something about the very chemistry that makes you write good music. It invariably makes you want to destroy each other (laughs). Everybody does it. Every bloody group. You’d be surprised if a group actually got on.\n\nQ: Does the fact that they’re touring and making new music as New Order without you color the way you feel about the songs you’re playing on this tour at all?\n\nA: No. I mean, I’m lucky. Being in a group is all about compromise. Now, if there's something I felt was wrong when we made the record, even though it was a majority decision, I can put it right, can’t I?\n\nI can actually play this music more or less how I envisioned it should sound. And we’re getting bigger and bigger and getting to play more places. So it seems like most people agree with the way I’ve done it. And I’m very happy about that.\n\nBeing in charge has actually made me happier in the music. So to answer your question, I’m much happier playing the music because I’m able to do it my own way and then they get to do what they do in their own way. So presumably they’re happier.\n\nFILM AND BOOKS\n\nQ: Two relatively recent films have been based on that time in your life — “Control” and “24 Hour Party People.” What did you think of those films?\n\nA: “24 Hour Party People” was a very lighthearted comedic look. Michael Winterbottom, who is now a very famous director, was right when he felt it was a complete farce, a farcical look at our history, our record company and our actions.\n\n“Control” was the opposite. Anton Corbijn was very serious. Joy Division changed his life, coming to watch Joy Division and photograph Joy Division. So it was very, very important to him and the film was very serious.\n\n“Control” was much more like the truth. Not to say “24 Hour Party People” wasn’t amazingly entertaining. I didn’t really recognize myself in “24 Hour Party People” but I recognized myself too much in “Control.”\n\nBut yeah, they’re both great films. And the thing is, with the Joy Division documentary that Grant Gee did, if you watch all three, then you know everything there is to know about Joy Division, New Order and Factory Records.\n\nQ: But even if you’ve seen all three, you should still read your books, though, right?\n\nA: (Laughs) Of course. They’re the absolute 100 percent truth, which I’m very, very proud of. I had no intention of doing a New Order book because I felt that there were some dodgy times in the ‘80s and ‘90s that even I didn’t want to talk about.\n\nBut the fact that the others decided to get together without me, I thought, “You know what? That story needs telling,” because the truth needs to me out there. It became a pleasure. It was quite cathartic to write it and it was a great story.\n\nYou know, as an author, I’ve been given three fantastic stories. Hacienda Club in Manchester. Joy Division, God bless ‘em, and New Order. Three amazing achievements. And successful culturally. Not successful financially maybe.\n\nBut they’re still fantastic achievements and I’m very proud of all three, to be honest.\n\nQ: And you said it was cathartic writing them?\n\nA: It was. And I learned a lot about the groups while I was doing it. I learned a lot about myself. And I’m really wondering what the next book is going to be about.\n\nQ: The music you made with both bands is still inspiring young artists. What do you think when you hear young bands in 2018 kind of channeling what you were doing in the ‘70s and ‘80s?\n\nA: I always take it as a compliment. As a group, we’ve never sued anyone for sounding like us. I’ve been sued a few time myself, but I’ve never sued anyone. And I think that’s something to be proud of.\n\nI think imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and you can ask Robert Smith about that. And many other people as well, yeah?\n\nQ: What’s been the best part about diving into these catalogs?\n\nA: Well, the best part is every record because the thing is that I have the unfortunate mantel, shall we say, of I have to say goodbye to them twice. (laughs). And saying goodbye to them is really difficult. Saying goodbye to “Unknown Pleasures.”\n\nWe’re playing that in Los Angeles this year in its entirety on May 18 in homage to Ian again, God rest his soul. But saying goodbye to “Still” as a collection, when we played that was really difficult.\n\n“Movement,” “Power, Corruption & Lies,” “Low-Life,” “Brotherhood,” I’m losing all of these songs every time. It breaks my heart. And then with “Substance” now. Once we finish this tour, we’ll be saying goodbye to “Substance.”\n\nThen I’ll be on “Technique” and “Republic,” so it’s painful to let them go. And I think really I need to let them go so I can get back to making some new music. I’m having too good of a time.\n\nQ: Are you working on new music?\n\nA: Yeah, I work on new music all the time. I have an outfit called Man Ray where I do a lot of new music with a friend of mine, Phil Murphy. And it’s not been put out properly but we’ve still done a lot of tracks.\n\nI play with a lot of other people. I’ve just done a track with a group called the Liminanas in France which has turned out really well, “The Gift.” I’ve done quite a few things. So it’s good. I certainly keep my hand in, let’s put it that way.\n\nQ: That’s great. What do you like to do when you’re not doing music?\n\nA: Walk the dogs and look after my beautiful wife and children. Not particularly in that order (laughs).\n\nPeter Hook and the Light\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, May 17.\n\nWhere: The Van Buren, 401 W.
