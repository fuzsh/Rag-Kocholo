        "text": "EDM has an endless list of genres – some have been around since the beginning, while others are popping up every year.\n\nIf you look online at other music genre resources, they often give an oversimplified view of the genre, without delving into the specifics.\n\nThat’s why we’ve created this resource. We cover the production techniques behind each genre, so you aren’t left guessing.\n\nWe haven’t included every single sub-genre ever, because the list would be far too long. We have included genres that are ‘big enough’ in their own right to have a section, but we may have missed some.\n\nWe also aren’t experts in all of these genres, so feel free to reach me over at [email protected] if you would like to add any suggestions or even new genres we haven’t covered.\n\n(And if you’re not sure what EDM is in the first place? Check out this article first.)\n\nA – B – C – D – E – F – G – H – I – J – K – L – M – N – O – P – Q – R – S – T – U – V – W – X –Y – Z – #\n\nAmbient\n\nLet’s start off on the quieter end of the spectrum.\n\nAmbient music is one of the oddballs in this list, given that it typically omits drums as an element of the composition.\n\nPioneered by Brian Eno, this genre has no detectable meter (although a slower tempo may be used from a production standpoint), a vague sense of rhythm and is heavily characterised by sonic movement, rather than by defined melodies, rhythms and chords. Everything is a blur.\n\nSong length tends to exceed 5 minutes, was a lot of the track featuring subtle, evolving modulation on pads, drones and soundscapes to keep it interesting, although the purpose of the genre might not necessarily be ‘interest’ as much as it would be ‘paying attention’.\n\nAlthough the rules of music are often there to be broken, ambient music tends to not feature much of the high-end hiss of 10-20kHz, and if so, it’s often subdued heavily. This gives the genre a warmer feel, especially with deeper bass pads that fill out the low-end.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nslow attack and release on synths\n\nreverb, delay and echo\n\nlow-pass and band-pass filters\n\nstretching audio to extended lengths\n\nlayering elements with no particular feature\n\nslow LFO’s on parameters like volume, pitch and filter cutoff\n\nplaying in key – key changes or modulations don’t sound as nice with a bunch of reverb applied\n\nexperimental sound design and FX processing\n\nNotable Artists: Brian Eno, Aphex Twin, Tim Hecker, Boards of Canada, William Basinski\n\nBass House\n\nThis modern form of house music combines the ‘screeches’ and ‘womps’ from brostep and bass music in general, with the danceable beat of house music. A clear winner for the dancefloor.\n\nWith an emphasis on energy, this genre is on the faster end of house music at ~130BPM and features a very ‘digital’ sounding production.\n\nWhile it does borrow the growls and bass sounds from dubstep and bass music in general, a lot of bass house is still focused on the low end and ‘deeper’ bass sounds, as heard in the example track below. This stays true to the original house genre.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nHigh-energy house drum patterns, spiced up with boosted highs and OTT/compression\n\nOften borrows elements from pop music, including hooks and vocals\n\nHeavy use of FX like risers and sweeps to build tension\n\nFM synthesis and complex bass design\n\nNotable Artists: Jauz, Valentino Khan, Ephwurd, Habstrakt, Joyryde\n\nBig Room House\n\n1, 2, 3, JUMP!\n\nYeah, you know what I’m talking about, especially if you watched any of the Ultra Music Festival live streams around 2012, or basically anything on Spinnin’ Records.\n\nBig Room House is a distinct departure from traditional house music with the festival in mind. While it’s initial hype has died down significantly, it’s still prominent at key events like Tomorrowland and EDC.\n\nWhile it keeps many elements from its predecessor, it tends to the faster end of the house spectrum (128-130BPM), and features a very simplistic drop with a sub-kick and reverb-heavy lead.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n4-on-the-floor kick drum pattern, featuring a tonal, distorted kick\n\nHeavily compressed lead synth with a lot of reverb to fill out the space\n\nIntense buildups with lots of risers, percussion and FX\n\nSimple drops with a kick, lead and often sidechained noise\n\nTypically in a minor key – sounds more serious\n\nNotable Artists: Hardwell, Avicii, Nicky Romero, Blasterjaxx, Martin Garrix\n\nBreakbeat\n\nBreakbeat (or simply ‘Breaks’) is quite a broad genre, and technically could encompass other genres featured in this list, like drum and bass, garage, hip-hop and jungle, but I’ll cover it for its own sake.\n\nThis genre is based around sampled drum breaks from funk and soul records, pitched up to a danceable BPM similar to that of house music.\n\nA ‘breakbeat’ or a ‘drum break’ is a sampled section of a song that just features drums, playing a rhythm that doesn’t feature a kick on every beat. The most famous example of a drum break from the song ‘Amen, Brother’ by The Winstons.\n\nMuch like house music, there are many different forms, from the deep kind to a more commercial variety, so it’s hard to specify what makes up this genre on its own. Perhaps think of it as an alternative way to approach house music, instead of the 4-on-the-flor kick pattern.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nSampled breakbeats, such as the Amen Break above\n\n~~120-130BPM tempo\n\nPads, bass and keys from synths like the Minimoog, Jupiter-8 and/or Juno-106.\n\nCan borrow bass design techniques from genres like drum and bass, like the reese bass\n\nNotable Artists: Many house and techno artists jump between this genre and house, so it’s difficult to note down specific artists. The Prodigy would be considered a breakbeat group on the higher end of the energy spectrum.\n\nBrostep (Dubstep)\n\nI had to include this as a separate genre to ‘dubstep’, as there is a markedly different sound in this modern form – ‘brostep’.\n\nIn terms of tempo, drum patterns and general structure and arrangement, you’ll find a lot of similarities between Brostep and original Dubstep.\n\n~140BPM\n\nHalf-time drum pattern – a kick on the 1 and a snare on the 3\n\nFocus on bass sounds\n\nThe difference in ‘brostep’ is the following:\n\nDigital bass sounds, typically utilizing complex sound design techniques\n\nDistortion and compression\n\nGreater loudness and brightness\n\nSometimes includes elements found in pop music\n\nIntensely-processed kick and snare\n\nOne of the main factors in contributing to the ‘largeness’ of ‘brostep’ is the OTT plugin/preset – a multiband dynamics processor, adding lots of compression to a sound. This tends to give the genre it’s ‘in your face’ energy, which the original form of dubstep lacks.\n\nMany people attribute the birth of this genre to none other than Skrillex, with purists calling it the ‘Americanization of dubstep’. Undoubtedly, you’ve heard his music.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nFM synthesis (play in lower registers to get interesting bass textures)\n\nXfer Serum and/or NI Massive (or similar)\n\nComplex sound design and FX\n\nOTT and compression\n\nDistortion and clipping\n\nHigh-quality drum samples and presets\n\nTransient shaping and compressing for punch\n\nNotable Artists: Skrillex, Excision, Zomboy, 12th Planet, Virtual Riot\n\nDeep House\n\nDeep house has birthed many different branches of house music over the decades, but here, by deep house, we mean the OG stuff, heavily influenced by Chicago house in the ’70s and ’80s.\n\nThere are many other modern forms, such as the future house variety, featuring a strong bassline and groove, or the melodic house variety, offered by labels like Anjunadeep.\n\nThe cornerstone of this classic genre would have to be the Roland TR-909 drum machine, with its club-ready kick drum, tight clap and distinctive, energetic hats and rides. Today, many tracks in this genre still make heavy use of these sounds, perhaps with the production value amped up a bit.\n\nA lot of the time, the drums feature what is known as a ‘groove’\n\nBeyond the percussion, you’ll find a lot of groovy basslines, courtesy of some of the pioneering synths at the time, such as the Roland Juno-60.\n\nSmooth pads are also a genre staple, featuring complex chord extensions and voicings from jazz. Oftentimes, producers back in the day would sample a jazz chord, load it into a sampler, and play it back at non-diatonic intervals, giving the genre it’s dissonant, out of key sound.\n\nSprinkled in between the groove, are sampled or recorded vocals, typically from female soul singers.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nTR-909 drum loops/samples\n\nWarm, analogue synths (or analogue-modelled synths) for bass and synth\n\nGrooves/swing\n\nVocal samples\n\nOther music to sample\n\nNotable Artists: Larry Heard, Kerri Chandler, Moodymann\n\nDisco\n\nDisco was born in the 70’s, and heavily influenced the development of house and techno in later years.\n\nWhile disco sometimes crossed over into pop, for the most part, it had a very distinct sound, featuring the use of drum machines, rhythm guitars, pianos, and synthesizers.\n\nWhile disco has largely evolved since that time period, it has influenced a lot of pop music and other genres.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nFour-on-the-floor drum pattern\n\nSnare/clap on the 2 and 4\n\nRecorded electric guitar\n\nStraight drum patterns from a drum machine, like the Roland TR-707, or from a real drum kit\n\nFunk-inspired bass lines, often with a syncopated rhythm\n\nNotable Artists: Donna Summer, Gorgio Moroder, Diana Ross, Chic\n\nDowntempo\n\nSharing similarities with ambient, IDM and trip-hop, downtempo is a genre that is, well, typically lower on the BPM spectrum (100 and below).\n\nAs the name suggests, you wouldn’t go fist-pumping to this at Coachella. Quiet drums, soft pads and delicate vocals and leads are the name of the game here. As with its sister genres, experimentation is a common element throughout the genre, and no two songs sound the same.\n\nLater down the track, downtempo gave way to more modern forms like chillwave and vaporwave.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nDrums in the form of one-shots or sampled breakbeats\n\nVintage synthesizers playing pads with long attack and release.\n\nOften borrows pop elements in terms of song structure and arrangement – many downtempo songs have vocals\n\nExperimental yet subtle sound design and selection\n\n70-110BPM in 4/4 time\n\nNotable Artists: Massive Attack, Tycho, Moby, Bonobo, Portishead\n\nDub\n\nAlthough it started out as a branch of reggae music, Dub quickly became a genre in its own right, borrowing elements from electronic music and reggae at the time.\n\nAlthough the genre still features a lot of traditional instruments like drums, trumpets, rhythm guitar and other brass/wind instruments, it’s the use of electronic FX and subtle synth elements that give it its fresh sound.\n\nIn fact, it was dub that innovated on the concept of the ‘dub delay’, a high-feedback triplet delay that had a distinct ‘echo’ to it, giving the music a trippy feel.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~140BPM half time drums\n\nHeavy use of triplet and untimed delays with high feedback amounts\n\nRimshots instead of snares\n\nReggae-inspired vocals\n\nTrumpet solos with reverb and delay\n\nSubtle synthesizer motifs throughout\n\nRecorded or sampled drums\n\nLots of dynamics to capture the drums\n\nNotable Artists: Lee Perry & The Upsetters, Mad Professor, Fat Freddy’s Drop\n\nDubstep\n\nThis time, we’re talking about original dubstep. If you’re meaning the more modern variant, ‘brostep’, then check that one out.\n\nDubstep, the child of UK garage and drum and bass, is stylized by a half-time 140BPM drum beat, meaning there is a kick on the one and a snare on the 3. The similarity in drum pattern to ‘Dub’ is where the name comes from.\n\nSub-bass wizardry is what makes dubstep, dubstep. That’s why it was designed for big sound systems with huge subs.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~140BPM half time drum patterns\n\nLoud sub-bass with saturation, filter/volume modulation and FM synthesis\n\nHeavy use of atmospheric leads and recordings with reverb and delay\n\nNotable Artists: Skream, Benga, Kode9, Loefah\n\nDrum & Bass\n\nDrum & Bass is one of those genres where I could break it down infinitely because there are so many different sounds and subcultures. But here I’ll be talking about the modern drum and bass sound, featuring filthy basslines, heavy drums and the occasional pop hook (for the subgenre junkies, think Neurofunk and Jump Up).\n\nAlso heavily reliant on breakbeats, drum & bass sits on the faster end of the tempo spectrum at ~175BPM. It shares production techniques with dubstep (both the brostep form and the original form) and bass music in general, but D&B often is in a league of its own.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nHeavy drum samples processed with compression and limiting\n\nComplex bass sound design using Serum and FM synthesis\n\n~175BPM breakbeat samples sped up, often reinforced or replaced by processed one-shot drums for modern production value\n\nHeavy focus on loud sub-bass – designed for club use\n\nNotable Artists: Noisia, Andy C, Chase & Status, Camo & Krooked\n\nElectro\n\nNot to be confused with Electro House, Electro is a genre that features heavy use of the 808 drum machine, playing drum patterns that sound like hip-hop and funk patterns sped up to house and techno tempos.\n\nInterwoven between these breakbeats are bleeps, bloops and zaps that come from an oscillator with crazy pitch modulation, all on the bed of subtle rhythmic pads and groovy basslines that fill out the atmosphere.\n\nThe resulting sound is an old-school dream that is equally funky as it is interesting. The genre is quite dependant on electronic sounds and went on to impact other genres, including the creation of electro house, which evolved into what it is today.\n\nFor a while, this genre was very much dead, but it’s resurfaced in the underground in recent years, hence why I’m including it in this article.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nUse of the Roland TR-808 drum machine, particularly the hats and snare\n\nFunk-oriented bass lines\n\nUse of vocoding, particularly a retro-sounding one (if you’re on Ableton, try the Retro mode)\n\nBleeps and bloops from pitch-modulated sine waves – try using envelopes, LFO’s and macros on the pitch of an oscillator\n\nPads and FX to fill out the atmosphere\n\nNotable Artists: Drexciya, Dopplereffekt, Aux 88, DJ Stingray\n\nElectro House\n\nNot to be confused with Electro, which I just mentioned. That being said, most people still refer to electro house as ‘electro’ due to its overwhelming popularity, so call it what you want.\n\nElectro House was born in the early 2000s, featuring heavy use of digital synthesizers on a house beat. Eventually, it gave way to subgenres like fidget house, complextro and dirty dutch, both of which featured squeaky lead synths with a lot of top-end definition.\n\nToday, complextro exists in the similar form of bass house, while fidget house and dirty dutch have gone back underground.\n\nNow we have other, bigger subgenres like big room house and bass house, which have almost disregarded the electro house name.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n128-130BPM with a typical 4-on-the-floor pattern\n\nFeaturing distorted basslines and bright chords\n\nTypically written in a minor key for energy\n\nSynth sounds to create risers for energy, like noise and pitch-modulated oscillators\n\nSidechained noise to fill out the background\n\nNotable Artists: Zedd, Wolfgang Gartner, Steve Aoki, Swedish House Mafia, Knife Party\n\nFuture Bass\n\nOne of the hottest genres of 2018, future bass is a modern amalgamation of many genres, fusing the beats of hip-hop, trap and dubstep with the supersaws of trance, all in a clean and bright package that reflects modern bass music.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~140BPM tempo\n\nProcessed trap 808 drums\n\nTrance detuned supersaws with filter and volume modulation (LFO’s)\n\nOTT and compression for a big sound\n\nAutotuned vocal chops from acapellas\n\nDigitally-distorted basslines\n\nNotable Artists: Flume, Porter Robinson, Wave Racer, San Holo, Marshmello, Said The Sky\n\nFuture Beats\n\nThis term is normally conflated with future bass, but future beat(s) is a different breed.\n\nWhile it borrows a lot from hip-hop and trap, it forgoes the supersaw focus and replaces it with 808’s, interesting samples and interesting sounds and layering. It has a big focus on experimentation, and typically sounds quite literally ‘futuristic’.\n\nIt’s the kind of music DJ Shadow got kicked off stage for playing back in 2012. It’s the kind of music that labels like Soulection have pushed for a while.\n\nLastly, the spectrum varies quite widely for this type of music, from super chill to a neo-trap kind of sound.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nHip hop/trap drums with lots of saturation and clipping\n\nExperimental sound design with leads, keys and pads\n\nHeavy focus on using 808 bass sounds with processing\n\nLoud kicks and snares\n\nNotable Artists: Sam Gellaitry, ODESZA, Cashmere Cat, Flume, TOKiMONSTA\n\nFuture House\n\nWhen big room died down in 2014, two main genres emerged from the ruins – Bass House and Future House.\n\nUnlike its aggressive sister, Future House is more focused on the kick-bass groove, while retaining a crisp digital sound.\n\nMost future house tracks feature a lead bassline in the drop section, with a nice plucky transient that pokes through the mix.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nDigital plucked bass sound, with fast decay and low sustain – often multiple sounds layered to achieve fullness\n\nHigh-energy house drum patterns, spiced up with boosted highs and OTT/compression\n\nSimple drums, similar to big room\n\nUses a lot of swing and groove patterns to achieve a traditional house feel\n\nOften borrows elements from pop music, including hooks and vocals\n\nHeavy use of FX like risers and sweeps to build tension\n\nNotable Artists: Tchami, ZHU, Don Diablo, Oliver Heldens\n\nGarage\n\nAlso known as UK garage, this genre developed out of a yearning for a more energetic and percussive version of house music. So the groove and swing stayed, but the tempo and percussiveness increased.\n\nGarage is a great example of dance music, combining well-produced drums that shake the dancefloor, with basslines that get people moving.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~130-140 BPM tempo\n\nStrong sense of groove/swing\n\nFocused on grooves in the bassline\n\nSyncopated rhythms for interest\n\nNotable Artists: MJ Cole, Jamie xx, Zomby, Zed Bias, Todd Edwards\n\nGlitch\n\nGlitch is considered to be in a league of its own. Generally considered a part of IDM, digital production techniques are the reason for this genre’s existence.\n\nThrough complex audio editing, such as beat repeating, brash cuts at small intervals and synths that sound like they came straight out of your hard drive, the genre evokes a certain aesthetic that is unparalleled in it’s plasticism.\n\nExample Track\n\nNotable Artists: The Glitch Mob, Tipper, eDIT, Mr. Bill\n\nGlitch-hop\n\nAs you may have guessed, this genre combines elements of hip-hop and glitch. Chuck in some modern bass techniques and drum production and you’ve got glitch-hop.\n\nThe modern variety of Glitch-hop is often called ‘Neurohop’, featuring the basslines from Neurofunk Drum and Bass.\n\nExample Track:\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~100BPM tempo\n\nSwung hip hop drums with modern production\n\nBorrows glitch elements from Glitch music\n\nBorrows complex bass design techniques from genres like dubstep and drum and bass\n\nNotable Artists: KOAN Sound, Culprate, ill.Gates, Kursa\n\nHappy Hardcore\n\nIf drum and bass is breakbeats sped up really fast, then hardcore is techno sped up really fast. The difference in happy hardcore is that, as you might have guessed, it’s happy.\n\nBorrowing synths from trance and pop, happy hardcore is basically the most bubblegum thing you could think of. Not for the faint of heart.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nMajor key\n\n~180BPM loud four-on-the-floor kicks\n\nTrance pads and supersaws\n\nBright, autotuned vocals\n\nNotable Artists: S3RL, Scott Brown, DJ Paul Elstak, Brisk & Ham\n\nHardcore\n\nIf we have happy hardcore as the happy version, straight hardcore is the dark version.\n\nDistorted techno and gabber kicks sitting around 180BPM is a recipe for something else.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~180BPM tonal kicks with lots of distortion\n\nKick, crash and claps typically on the same beat as the kick\n\nDistorted, atonal synths that create an atmosphere of noise\n\nLots of bass\n\nNotable Artists: Angerfist, Neophyte, Paul Elstak\n\nHardstyle\n\nSeeing as we are at ‘H’, we are getting a lot of the ‘Hard’ genres, right. Hardstyle is probably the least ‘hard’ of them all.\n\nHardstyle sits at an interesting 150BPM, too fast for a house tempo, but too slow for thrashing about. This is why hardstyle, along with its predecessor, Gabber, is known for it’s ‘shuffling’ movement.\n\nSharing a lot of similarities with Hardcore, Hardstyle has had more mainstream appeal due to it’s lower BPM and its influence from Trance. You’ll find lots of distorted basslines and kicks still, but in the breakdown, you can often find euphoric supersaw build-ups (especially nowadays).\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nDistorted kick drums on the beat, usually based off a 909 kick with a lot of processing. Often called bass kicks.\n\nTrance supersaws in the buildup\n\nHeavy use of crashes and noise for energy and tension\n\nSpoken vocals in the breakdown to evoke a sense of atmosphere\n\nNotable Artists: Headhunterz, Noisecontrollers, Wildstylez, Da Tweekaz, Brennan Heart\n\nHip-hop\n\nYou might be wondering why I’ve included hip-hop as a genre of electronic music. Although it’s considered a separate branch of music, hip-hop has its roots in electronic production techniques.\n\nOriginally, hip-hop sat between 70-100BPM and sampled, chopped and rearranged breaks from funk and soul tracks. Also layered in would be some hook and bassline that was once again, sampled and chopped into a new form.\n\nIt was also the norm to have a rapper over the top of this beat, carrying the track rhythmically and lyrically.\n\nToday’s hip-hop is wide and varied, from trap to fusions with rock music. But it’s core and heart is in sampling and processing.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Techniques:\n\nChopped up drum samples, typically done on a sampler such as an MPC\n\nRap vocals\n\nJazz, soul or funk tracks chopped and arranged along with the beat\n\nNotable Artists: A Tribe Called Quest, Kanye West, Dr. Dre, Wu-Tang Clan\n\nHouse\n\nAn umbrella term for many different varieties of house music, House originally came out of Chicago and featured a prominent 4/4 kick drum with swinging percussion and hats, giving it the distinctive sound it’s known for.\n\nAdd emphasis to the rhythm, the basslines in these tracks added something special, that along with the kick and percussion, you couldn’t help but move to it.\n\nAs mentioned, house music has taken on many different forms today, but the core sound still influences many of them.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Techniques:\n\n~120BPM tempo with drum machine kicks, normally an 808 or 909\n\nClap on the 2 and 4\n\nClosed hat or open hat on the offbeat, often alternating\n\nSyncopated basslines\n\nVintage synths and samplers\n\nNotable Artists: Many artists mentioned in other subgenres\n\nIDM\n\nNo, not EDM.\n\nIntelligent Dance Music, often shortened to IDM, is a broader form of electronic music focused on complex rhythms and sound design, rather than the simplistic form of genres like house and dubstep.\n\nFor some people, this encompasses genres like Ambient, Breakbeat and certain forms of house and techno. Regardless of form, IDM is mostly characterised by its focus on experimentation – thus it is hard to describe as a genre rather than an approach to making music.\n\nWarp Records is the key pusher in the scene, signing a lot of the prominent acts. But words aren’t often the best tool to describe this sound, so it’s best you listen for yourself and make your own deductions.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nComplex and fast rhythms featuring random and rapid velocity changes\n\nUnexpected elements that are juxtaposed from the previous material – think big noise sweeps with distortion layered on soft, lush pads smothered in echo\n\nGlitchy, short percussion sounds with short decay times\n\nLots of layers in the arrangement, from foley layers to modular synth bleeps to 80’s analog keys\n\nNon-traditional song structure that differs every time\n\nOccasional or frequent use of atonal sounds and instruments in the arrangement that aren’t diatonic to a specific key\n\nNotable Artists: Oneohtrix Point Never, Squarepusher, Autechre, Venetian Snares, Amon Tobin\n\nJungle\n\nSharing a lot of similarities, Jungle is a genre that features breakbeats at ~175BPM. The difference in Jungle is that it typically features the breakbeats of old funk and soul tracks, pitched up and then chopped, screwed and arranged into new patterns.\n\nJungle is also heavily influenced by Ragga and Reggae music, and thus features prominent elements from those subcultures, with a focus on deep bass patterns and hype MCs.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~175BPM breakbeats, resampled into new forms through chopping\n\nDeep sub-bass, often loaded into a sampler and pitched around\n\nMC vocals as the focus\n\nHip-hop sampling techniques\n\nNotable Artists: Goldie, DJ Hype, LTJ Bukem, Roni Size\n\nLofi Hip-Hop\n\nAlthough hip-hop had a low fidelity sound when it was first growing as a genre, modern production techniques soon eliminated so-called limitations like low sample rate and bit depth. Hip-hop became very clean sounding. Samples were used less due to copyright issues.\n\nNow, lofi hip-hop has emerged thanks to a longing for that nostalgia – dusty drums, vinyl crackle, pitch wow and flutter, low sample rates, sampling, you name it.\n\nThanks to the flexibility of modern production, there is are subtle differences in ‘old school hip-hop’ and this new variety, but it remains as a nod to those times.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~80BPM drum grooves, usually featuring processed one-shots chopped from old drum loops\n\nSamples chopped up and rearranged\n\nLow-pass filters, bit crushers and saturation to add a lo-fi feel\n\nLayered vinyl and cassette noise\n\nNotable Artists: Knxwledge, Joji, jinsang, Idealism, bsd.u\n\nMelbourne Bounce\n\nBig Room House created a rod for its own back when everyone started releasing the same sounding tracks over and over around 2012, so Melbourne Bounce quickly took over as an alternative sound, thanks to Melbourne-based artists like Will Sparks and Joel Fletcher.\n\nRecord labels soon picked up this sound, and it became a hit. Instead of big sub-kicks that roared through festival crowds, bounce had an emphasis on the off-beat bass, similar to psytrance but at a house tempo, layered with compressed, shuffle-driven leads.\n\nThis rhythmic combination propelled some of these artists into mainstream success and made the Melbourne Bounce sound world-famous.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nElectro house and big room elements\n\nOffbeat sub-bass\n\nThin melodic lead lines\n\nLots of reverb\n\nPunchy kicks\n\nNotable Artists: Will Sparks, Joel Fletcher, TJR, New World Sound\n\nMidtempo\n\nAs requested by an EDMProd reader, Midtempo (or Midtempo Bass) is a relatively newer subgenre that has been popularized by artists like REZZ.\n\nEssentially, you take the bass sounds from modern dubstep/brostep & bass house and apply them to a ~100-110BPM tempo.\n\nBut this isn’t Glitch Hop. This genre features more of a consistent house/techno drum pattern, following the kick-clap motion.\n\nThe resulting feeling created by this combination of elements is a head-nodding rhythm interspersed with huge shows of bass design wizardry, really allowing you to appreciate the technical side of the production.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nHouse kick-clap pattern\n\nHeavy bass elements borrowed from bass house and techno\n\nDark, industrial like sound effects\n\nNotable Artists: REZZ, Kayoh, 1788-L, LICK\n\nMoombahton\n\nCombining reggaeton and house music brought this rhythmic and tribal feel to dance music.\n\nWhile earlier forms of this genre were closer to reggaeton, artists like Dillon Francis and Diplo gave it a noticeably more electronic touch, namely borrowing elements from genres like Electro House.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Techniques:\n\n~110 BPM\n\nFocus on offbeat drum rhythms\n\nElectro house leads, often featuring pitch modulation and are played in a higher note register\n\nNotable Artists: Dillon Francis, Diplo, also a lot of Electro House Artists\n\nNu-Disco/Indie Dance\n\nNu-Disco, or Indie Dance, is a very ill-defined genre, and everywhere you go someone will tell you different things.\n\nSome say it’s essentially disco with more modern house techniques used in house and techno, some would equate it to a more synth-heavy indie dance genre. For this example, we’re going with the second.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n100-120BPM kicks playing a 4-on-the-floor rhythm\n\nSnares on the 2 and 4\n\nHeavy use of brass, arps and keys synths, normally vintage or analogue\n\nOften features vocals, typically similar to that found in alternative music genres\n\nNotable Artists: Chromeo, Todd Terje, Goldroom, Classixx\n\nPop\n\nPop doesn’t really exist as a genre. The only thing that remains constant is catchy hooks and solid chord progressions, whether it’s borrowing elements from rock, electronic music or country.\n\nAs of late, pop has developed an inherently electronic sound, and it’s here to stay, even if DJ Khaled whips out his electric guitar for a rock lead on the drop.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nHard to say, but normally simple chord progressions on a synth\n\nAutotuned vocals singing the melody\n\nNotable Artists: Ariana Grande, DJ Khaled, Madonna, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish\n\nProgressive House\n\nProgressive House is another one of those genres that nobody can tend to agree on. Originally, it referred to any house music with longer structures that slowly added or subtracted layers of elements.\n\nThe issue is, in 2011-2012, big room house and electro house DJ’s started making tracks with big euphoric leads, borrowing them from genres like trance, and then calling it progressive house. Beatport also labelled a lot of the music like this, although it had more in common with electro house.\n\nProgressive house, in this case, refers to the chill, melodic and percussive side of house music, that builds up over time. Artists like Eric Prydz and deadmau5 were the biggest names in this space, while labels like Anjunadeep regularly release this type of music.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~125BPM house patterns typically focused on the kick and clap rather than offbeat percussion\n\nSynthesized chords and melodies\n\nPlucked supersaw sounds with a low-pass filter, controlled by an ADSR envelope\n\nNotable Artists: Eric Prydz, deadmau5, Arty, Lane 8\n\nPsy-trance\n\nOk, where do I start? To be honest, I didn’t realize how many different varieties of psytrance there was before I started this article. But hey, you learn something new every day.\n\nPsytrance is typically characterized by a trance tempo and deep electronic bass occurring on every quarter note, giving it a certain sense of energy. For this reason, it’s very popular at certain festivals around the world, such as Burning Man.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~138BPM with kicks on every beat (normally very punchy and short)\n\nPlucky, deep bass on every quarter beat, typically sidechained to the kick\n\nGlitchy and percussive effects that add variety throughout the beat\n\nNotable Artists: Infected Mushroom, Astral Projection, Astrix\n\nSynthpop\n\nArtists in the ’80s and ’90s started introducing synths and drum machines into their tracks, but some more so than others.\n\nPeople referred to this subsection of pop music as ‘synthpop’, because, well, it used a lot of synths.\n\nYes, it still had vocals, but for the time, it was notably more electronic than what anybody was used to, especially in pop music.\n\nToday, this genre exists as a microcosm of people who try and emulate that kind of sound, which featured the cheesy sounds of the ’80s.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nGated snare reverb\n\nOberheim-OBX to get the bright, cheesy sound\n\nLinndrum drum machine samples\n\nNotable Artists: New Order, Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran\n\nSynthwave\n\nImagine the ’80s but you can only make music with synths and drum machines. No vocals (at least not many), no traditional instruments.\n\nThat’s synthwave.\n\nIn all seriousness, this genre has a dedicated fanbase and the music has a very nostalgic and driving feel to it. It’s very easy to listen to a mix of it for an hour.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nSits between 80-110BPM\n\nFeatures analogue and vintage synth elements for bass, melodies and chords\n\nHeavy usage of drum machines like the Linndrum, kicks on 1 and 3, snares on 2 and 4\n\nStraight drum patterns, no swing\n\nSubtle FX, delay and reverb to add atmosphere\n\nNotable Artists: Com Truise, HOME, Kavinsky, Mitch Murder\n\nTech House\n\nTech House combines the tempo and rhythm of house music with the slightly more industrial influences of techno, creating a percussive and groovy genre that gets the dancefloor going.\n\nIn recent years, this genre has risen in popularity quite a bit. Labels like Defected Records are known for propagating this genre for a long time now.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~125BPM\n\nHouse drums, with a focus on louder off-beat percussive elements, like hats and snares\n\nGroovy, short-phrased basslines that repeat\n\nSpoken word phrases that repeat\n\nLack of chord elements and melodic elements (usually)\n\nNotable Artists: Hot Since 82, CamelPhat, Carl Cox, Green Velvet, Patrick Topping\n\nTechno\n\nI live in Melbourne, so I can’t really escape techno.\n\nJokes aside, techno is one of those genres that have forged many different kinds of electronic and dance music over the years. It emerged out of Detroit around the same time house music was coming out of Chicago.\n\nA lot of the varieties that exist of house music, generally apply to techno. It can be deep, progressive, breakbeat and more.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~130-140BPM\n\nKick on every beat, claps not always on 2 and 4 (at least not as often as in house music)\n\nFocus on percussion and bass\n\nUse of 909 drum machine, namely kick and hats\n\nNotable Artists: Adam Beyer, Carl Cox, Robert Hood, Chris Liebing, Richie Hawtin\n\nRecommended: How To Make Techno – 11 Need-To-Know Techniques\n\nTrance\n\nWhile its popularity has dwindled in latter years, trance still retains its diehard fanbase.\n\nThis genre is very energetic, anthemic and uplifting, blending club energy with evocative chords and melodies. While the faster BPM might scare some, for other’s it’s a sweet balance between techno and house with added emotion.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~138BPM tempo with thumpy club kicks on every beat\n\nMeticulously mixed and mastered\n\nEmphasis on supersaws and driving bass patterns, normally playing on every quarter note\n\nEuphoric melodies and chords, often with many layers to create a full sound\n\nTypically drum patterns do not contain swing\n\nNotable Artists: Above & Beyond, Cosmic Gate, Paul van Dyk, Ferry Corsten, Paul Oakenfold\n\nTrap\n\nTrap is one of those genres that had always been there, but then the EDM scene started to ride it heavily, creating a new plethora of tracks that borrowed elements from bass music.\n\nTrap tends to have 2 streams now – the music that charts well, featuring so-called ‘mumble rappers’ (closer to the original version of trap music, and the more bass-music influenced variety. The latter is often called ‘hybrid trap’.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n~140BPM half-time drums, similar to dubstep but with processed 808 drums – look up the Lex Luger kit\n\nBooming 808 sub-bass\n\nSnappy 808 snare drum and ‘machine gun’ 808 hats in rapid succession\n\nProcessed leads and basses with a lot of compression\n\nLeads with reverb and delay, playing eerie melodies and chords (typically in darker modes like Phyrigian or Aeolian).\n\nNotable Artists: Flosstradamus, RL Grime, DJ Snake, What So Not, Metro Boomin\n\nTrip-hop\n\nTrip-hop is a difficult one to put in a box. Firstly, it’s very similar to ‘downtempo’, except normally it’s considered slightly closer to hip-hop and features a lot of ‘psychedelic’ elements, like delays, reverbs and synth modulation.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n70-100BPM hip-hop beats, sampled breakbeats or other\n\nUse of FX like delay and reverb on pads\n\nWashed out vocals\n\nFocus on experimental composition and sound design – uncanny sounds can pop up from time to time\n\nNotable Artists: Portishead, DJ Shadow, Unkle\n\nTropical House\n\nAs a relatively new kid on the block, Tropical House has gained a lot of popularity in recent years, thanks to artists like Kygo who has created many pop remixes in this particular genre.\n\nIt can be distinctly seperated from other genres with its focus on relaxation, catchy melodies and bright, ‘poppy’ sounds.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\n110-125 BPM, usually on the slower spectrum of house music\n\nFeatures ‘tropical’ instruments like steel drums, or synthesized bell sounds\n\nLots of major keys, major chords and simple triads\n\nPlucky and short percussion, using lots of soft claps/snaps\n\nHeavy featuring of vocals across many tracks\n\nNotable Artists: Kygo, Sam Feldt, Matoma\n\nVaporwave\n\nNeed I say more?\n\nJokes aside, vaporwave developed purely on the internet, originally as a meme genre made to poke fun at our consumerist society.\n\nBut it’s grown into a genuine genre with a decent fanbase and many artists. It’s similar to the chillwave and synthwave sounds, mixed with sampled jazz and elevator music.\n\nExample Track\n\nProduction Elements:\n\nUse of slowed down samples\n\nStraight kick-snare patterns at ~100BPM\n\nSamples of ironic sounds or audio bytes, like interviews from the ’80s and ’90s\n\nVintage synths with lots of unison, lowpass, delay and reverb\n\nNotable Artists: Blank Banshee, Skylar Spence, Macintosh Plus (Vektroid), ECO VIRTUAL\n\nMiss Anything?\n\nBeing that there are so many genres of electronic music, I’ve probably missed something."
