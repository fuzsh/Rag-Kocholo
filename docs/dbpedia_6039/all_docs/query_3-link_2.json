        "text": "I was seven years old when I first heard a song by New Order. Growing up in Liverpool, my father had been feeding northwest-bred bands such as Echo & The Bunnymen, The Smiths and Joy Division into my ears since my first steps, but I didn’t initially identify with it. All these sounds were similar to me and, like any average four-year-old, my head couldn’t grasp confusing lyrics that claimed that love could tear two people apart. Things changed when the third millennium arrived, though. I joined a dance school and embraced the energy that came with moving in sync to electronic music. It was at a dance show in 2003 that I first heard “Blue Monday” and, with that, a personal bridge towards my rock obsession was built.\n\nThe recording had been around for 20 years at this point, safely sitting as Britain’s bestselling 12-inch single of all time. It was quite the achievement for Factory Records, the independent Manchester-based label which rose to prominence at the end of the seventies through its signing of local band Joy Division. With television personality Tony Wilson and graphic designer Peter Saville (the man behind much of New Order's album artwork) sitting among its co-founders, the results that poured out of this record label were one-of-an-artistic-kind. You can't beat the Northern touch. Supported by New Order’s record sales, Factory opened The Haçienda in 1982 – Manchester’s warehouse nightclub which grew to be the cultural hub for post-punk and techno music. “Blue Monday” was just one ingredient to that success.\n\nBut regardless of its age, to my youthful ears, hearing this song was like hearing the future. Stood in the wings of the stage having just danced my heart out to Kylie Minogue’s “Better The Devil You Know” (equally banging track, FYI), I watched as three senior dancers moulded themselves into human bass drums, slotting robotic sequences into its synthetic production. For the rest of that summer, I blasted the seven-minute song – dancing all day in hope I would become fluent in this otherworldly music. Looking back now, I think New Order actually had millennials in mind when composing “Blue Monday”. It’s like they knew the turn of the century would extend limbs with gadgets, so they served up a discography that, for the most part, sounded like it had come from a futuristic dream machine – the device your ears need.\n\nBut let's emphasise for the most part, because despite their name, New Order still incorporated older orders of music. When Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis died in 1980, bandmates Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris announced their new name in a quick turnaround with their post-punk sensibility intact. Initial productions were a masterful blend of Joy Division’s niche brutality and overtly synthetic pop (kickstarted by German bands such as Kraftwerk a decade earlier, but freshly filtered into a British dance record with mainstream appeal by New Order). As it turned out, that infusion was a blessing for its continuity.\n\nYoung people now can identify immediately with New Order's electronica and, after a few listens, start to hear their punk underbelly\n\nYoung people now can identify immediately with New Order's electronica and, after a few listens, start to hear the punk underbelly behind their other tracks. Power, Corruption & Lies might have drawn people in with its overwhelming synthetic soundbites, but the stabbing drums, skittering guitar and banging bass on tracks such as “Ultraviolence” sound like an upgraded version of Joy Division's “New Dawn Fades”. It’s a progressive music education and this 22-year-old writer can attest to that. A few years after my initiation, my ten-year-old self was sitting listening to Television’s “Little Johnny Jewel” through a pink portable CD player. Those New Order waters run deep.\n\nSadly, it’s easy for millennials to feign awareness of these bands today. Buy a T-shirt with a Peter Saville graphic, post some pictures of lead singers to your Instagram feed and, bravo, you look like a loyalist. But there’s more to these musicians than cult status and a top song. A delve into New Order’s discography is proof of that. So, to those whose knowledge of the influential band ends with “Blue Monday”, fear not. Here’s eight of their other standout tracks to ignite the pleasures of past times. Expect to end up in a rock-infested wormhole shortly after.\n\n‘Temptation’ (1981)\n\nThe mood is: Lower West Side, Manhattan, New York, 1981. Dance music spills onto the streets from thriving nightclubs such as The Roxy, The Garage and Danceteria. New Order land in America’s electronic capital, drop this alternative development from Joy Division and all New Yorkers fall down. This is New Order’s \"make it in the US\" track, a 3am on a Friday night anthem, heartbreak and desire in a dance song whose title doesn't appear in its lyrics. It doesn’t need to.\n\nThe best lyric is: \"I think I’ll walk alone / I'll find my soul as I go home\"\n\n‘Ceremony’ (1981)\n\nThe mood is: An ode to Ian Curtis. The real bridge between the end of Joy Division and the start of New Order, their debut single after an unfinished session before Curtis’ death. With its lack of synthesisers, this is total guitar takeover, affirmation that New Order would be as integral as Joy Division to the progression of rock. It’s the kind of song you should listen to while flâneuring through the city for an hour. But a warning: emotions will likely surface by its final instrumental.\n\nThe best lyric is: “I’ll break them all, no mercy shown / Heaven knows, it’s got to get closer”\n\n‘Regret’ (1993)\n\nThe mood is: Summer jam, played live by the band on Venice Beach as part of an episode of Baywatch, a defining moment of their American success. It’s been a hit since 1993, when it landed on two Billboard charts: first, Hot Dance Club Hits; second, Modern Rock Tracks. But what was it? A niche blend of both, but modern rock does top it a tad. Learn the lyrics to the chorus, because you’ll need to scream it at least 20 times while you’re in your twenties (AKA, the decade of regrets).\n\nThe best lyric is: “We’re dealing in the limits / And we don’t know who with”\n\n‘Bizarre Love Triangle’ (1986)\n\nThe mood is: The perfect backing to that complicated love triangle between Nancy, Steve and Jonathan in series one and two of Stranger Things. Seriously, they should have just played this for the first 17 episodes of the show. In fairness though, the Duffer brothers did blast New Order's “Elegia” in series one and it was major. But back to this bizarre track, which probably boasts the most iconic use of synthesisers in a New Order song. Stick on a pair of metallic pants, unleash your dance moves (good or bad, but aim for the former) and you’ll quickly see why. Full-on Eighties nostalgia.\n\nThe best lyric is: “The wisdom of the fool won't set you free”\n\n‘True Faith’ (1987)\n\nThe mood is: Christian Bale in American Psycho, the song that opens the classic black comedy, blasting through the club you wish you were at as Patrick Batemen parties with friends. For Londoners, this is the kind of song that sits on Moth Club's “Dancing In The Dark 80s Night” playlist (Hackney's AM gem in the glittering back room of an East London pub that feels like a school disco only the average attendant is 27 and buys their clothes from Brown’s). Friday night, you just got paid and you want to dance your troubles away. Stoli on the rocks, anyone?\n\nThe best lyric is: \"The value of destiny comes to nothing / I can’t tell you where we’re going”\n\n‘Senses’ (1981)\n\nThe mood is: Groove trigger. The standout song from New Order’s debut album, boasting minimum input lyrically and maximum output in sound scope. You can feel the influence of New York in this one; it sounds like an electronic upgrade to Talking Heads’ 1979 track “I Zimbra”. The main reason: those drum cadences, boasting an African touch that invites you into an uncontested form of dance. Songs such as this were like trailers for Power, Corruption & Lies, released two years later. An underrated anthem from New Order.\n\nThe best lyric is: “Two ides of recoil, this moment’s glory / A failed reminder of a broken story”\n\n‘Love Vigilantes’ (1985)\n\nThe mood is: Time for reflection. A sad bit of storytelling in this one, as Sumner sings about a soldier who returns home from war with a desire to see his wife and son, only to realise he has arrived as a ghost. A mega-long instrumental to conclude the record and let you ponder a bit. Not exactly the perfect song to play at the peak of your Saturday night; it’s more of a Sunday afternoon on your own in the park kind of vibe. Proof of the poetic qualities that New Order carried over from Joy Division.\n\nThe best lyric is: “I flew through the sky / My convictions could not lie / For my country I would die”\n\n‘Age Of Consent’ (1983)\n\nThe mood is: Tragic, to be honest, but somehow sung in a manner of enlightening reflection. In short, this track from Power, Corruption & Lies is the ultimate sun-shower song (which tops “Blue Monday” by far). It has one of the greatest opening bass riffs of all time and in five minutes defines New Order. With lyrics that trigger a bizarre nostalgia for a relationship you never even had, you'll find yourself coming back to this one as a musical antidote. Forget the feelings; scream the song. And delve into the album’s cover art too (pictured), a reproduction of French artist Henri Fantin-Latour’s “A Basket Of Roses”. A record of total melancholia, this was a shift for new wave music.\n\nThe best lyric is: “I’m not the kind that likes to tell you / Just what you want me to”\n\nFollow us on Vero for exclusive music content and commentary, all the latest music lifestyle news and insider access into the GQ world, from behind-the-scenes insight to recommendations from our Editors and high-profile talent.\n\nNow read:\n\nThe very best songs by The Velvet Underground (and Nico) to see you into summer\n\nPink Floyd’s best album definitely isn’t The Wall… here’s why\n\nAC/DC’s best song (and why it isn’t ‘Highway To Hell’)"
