        "text": "If any post punk band could get in, it'd be Joy Division. Sadly, the Hall has an antipathy towards post-punk that rivals only their utter dismissal of progressive rock, arena rock and anything approximating heavy metal.\n\nPosted by Hunter Morrow on Tuesday, 09/3/2013 @ 08:43am\n\nThrough two albums and one hell of a good single, Ian Curtis, Peter Hook, Bernard Sumner, and Stephen Morris pretty much invented, if not laid down the foundation for all alternative music to come after. If not for them bands like Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins, The Stone Roses, The Smiths, Oasis, The Cure, Arctic Monkeys, and Kasabian would’ve had any chance of making it in the industry. They created one of the most iconic melodies of all time with the chorus of “Love Will Tear Us Apart”, and their debut album “Unknown Pleasures” is one of the most influential alternative albums of all time (just observe the number of t-shirts sold with the album’s artwork...obviously the iconic stature of not only the music but the COVER is indenture enough to give the lads their due). Music would’ve been vastly different if not for this great band, and Ian Curtis should’ve definitely been given this honor a log time ago for being one of the most simultaneous loved and misunderstood geniuses of his generation, almost synonymous and recognizable as the British Kurt Cobain.\n\nPosted by Tyler Partnow on Wednesday, 05/9/2018 @ 14:57pm\n\nThe guy who wrote this article wants Joy Division/New Order in the Hall.\n\n“This is a two-for-one, since the latter of these two bands was formed from the remnants of the former and, minus the eventual replacement of a bassist and the inclusion of a keyboardist, the lineup has remained consistent. This is not without precedent, as the bands Parliament and Funkadelic shared an induction in a similar fashion. It also helps that both of these bands have proved influential in a variety of ways over the course of their careers.\n\nJoy Division released two highly regarded albums, “Unknown Pleasures” and “Closer,” before the tragic suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis. These two records formed the bedrock of the gothic rock and post-punk movements, due to their dark ambiance, deeply personal themes and sparse arrangements, qualities that were considered novel at the time.\n\nThe remaining members of the band then formed New Order, and went on to pioneer the synth-pop genre in the ‘80s, with releases such as “Power, Corruption & Lies” and “Low-Life.” Their song “Blue Monday” remains the best-selling 12-inch single of all time and is still in heavy rotation on ‘80s radio stations.\n\nIn many ways the quintessential ‘80s band, New Order was among the best of the new crop of artists of that decade and their work still holds up, a trait quite rare in a decade ridiculed for its gimmicky and trend-chasing music. Their shared pedigree in Joy Division only furthers their staying power.”\n\nhttp://www.collegiatetimes.com/lifestyles/three-bands-that-need-to-be-in-the-rock-and/article_08b166c0-87df-11e8-9cde-dbca9aab1a33.html\n\nPosted by The Dude on Saturday, 07/21/2018 @ 14:20pm\n\nThen you must hear a lot of dumb ideas, Michael, because it's the only one that makes sense, considering they were the exact same musically creative core, and you can hear the same creative direction near the end, of synth driven electronic music,which IAN HIMSELF set them on by introducing them to Kraftwerk. To sound like Rob Gretton, \"Hallelujah, you can fookin blame Ian Curtis for the sound of New Order\"\n\nPosted by Gary on Sunday, 12/30/2018 @ 15:13pm\n\nPeter Hook: We're not in the Hall cause we're not together.\n\nI really think he's wrong about it. What Joy Division/New Order lacks is mainstream popularity here in the states and they're a niche band with maybe no radio staples or only just one. But I wouldn't be surprised if they do get nominated and inducted for next year's class. With the Cars, the Cure, Roxy Music, and Depeche Mode now in, 80's alternative/New Wave now inducts 80's alternative/New Wave. Hell, even Trent Reznor and a couple of members from Radiohead will vote for them to support. It shouldn't take a lot of tries for those guys to get in.\n\nPosted by The Dude on Tuesday, 05/12/2020 @ 09:46am\n\nLike it or not, the only reason Joy Division isn't in is because they never signed with a major label. People can bring up anything else to say otherwise, but the truth is if they signed with RCA Records as originally intended and released their two albums on that label they would have gotten in a few years after eligibility. Sometimes people bring up lack of notability in America, but they were late bloomers; many people know songs like Transmission, and the Unknown Pleasures cover is still one of rock's most famous images. Sometimes the band tensions, particularly with Hooky, are brought up, but they had years of eligibility when still together and weren't considered. This of course doesn't get into their influence, which might be the greatest of an act still not in, or combining their resume with New Order, in which they become the biggest snubs by far.\n\nThey'll get in eventually, because it's starting to become a bit ridiculous not having them in and the backlog will get covered with the lull of real rock artists in the upcoming 2 decades. But they are definite examples of how internal politics get in the way of qualified artists actually making it.\n\nPosted by Guest on Sunday, 02/28/2021 @ 21:10pm\n\nI never knew of Joy Division and didnt like New Order. After seeing them dominate critics top songs and albums I started listening and to the crazy back story of thr leas singer having seizures on stage and ecentually passing at say 22. the band members always said well create a new band if one passes and did and it became pop New Order. They are sensational and are musical genius clearly. Vote for\n\nThem at the 2023 rock Hall of Fame. One of my favorite bands now.\n\nPosted by Brett elkins on Saturday, 02/11/2023 @ 01:12am\n\nI always wonder who is on the voting committee of supposed music historians. Link Wray isn't in which lacks common sense nor is Joy Division, Pixies, Smashing Pumpkins, Billy Idol, MC5, or Warren Zevon. Zevon should get in this year finally.\n\nI fear they'll mess up JD finally getting in because of the Stranger Things only Kate Bush factor, or well the fact they're dense hipsters. Musicians should be the ones voting for this because whomever is isn't very intelligent or knowledgeable.\n\nPosted by Rik on Thursday, 04/13/2023 @ 17:05pm\n\nAfter some reflection, I believe Joy Division/New Order might be inducted around 2030 through the Musical Excellence path, or they might never get inducted or even nominated, especially if there's a stronger lean towards pop. I'm pondering who would cast their votes for them. In the UK, their most prominent territory, they lack appeal to the older British voters because of their gloomy and quirky nature. Some younger British inductees might vote for them, but I suspect influential figures like Paul McCartney, members of The Zombies or The Moody Blues, Elvis Costello, and Elton John might have already dismissed JDNO. As for Americans, would white boomers vote for them? Definitely not. They're likely unaware of JDNO. Older Black individuals such as Stevie Wonder or Buddy Guy certainly wouldn't, and while a few younger Black Americans might, the majority, including Jay-Z and Missy Elliott, would likely vote for mainstream and Black artists instead of JDNO. Thus, it seems hardly anyone would vote for them, except for a significant portion of '80s and '90s alternative/new wave inductees. But beyond this group, they virtually have no voter base in America. I'm even pessimistically thinking they might have ended up dead last in last year's final vote. Bands like Maiden and Soundgarden are likely to have a broader voting base. As a fan, I'm concerned they may never be inducted.\n\nPosted by power on Thursday, 03/28/2024 @ 13:29pm"
