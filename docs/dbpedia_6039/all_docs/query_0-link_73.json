        "text": "Let’s begin with a simple question: what makes pop music, well, pop? Pop is the short term for popular. But pop music isn’t simply music that is popular. What tops the charts isn’t necessarily pop music. There has been many nr. 1 songs that weren’t poppy at all.\n\nHowever, pop music does keep one’s finger on the pulse. Due that, it is very fluid. As such, there is no such thing as “pop music”. Pop music is much like EDM an umbrella term that aggregates different fusion genres. Rock, hip hop and EDM all have pop-variants.\n\nPop music is more about the way of producing. What differentiates pop music from other music types is its intrinsic aim to sell. Pop music is purely commercial. I wouldn’t say there is no art or skill in pop music, but that such art or skill is of secondary importance.\n\nThe general pop song has a pop artist. Well, “artist”. The male or female singer is just that: a pretty face that sings. Even that last quality is sometimes debatable: the voice of the singer gets heavily edited in the studio and live performances are often play-backed.\n\nThe music composers and song writers are often anonymous or unknown and are professionally contracted by record companies. Although some record companies find selling value in authenticity so singer-song writers have more autonomy in the production process.\n\nAnyway, these professional music makers are not “credited” (meaning: they are mentioned as the performers, not in the purely legal sense). Few of these professional music makers get the recognition they deserve (or at least: not by the general public). Often, the music gets produced and later sold to a recording label. There is no connection between the maker and the performer of pop songs and both can be replaced by somebody else.\n\nThat being said, there are pop songs who are entirely self-made and where the recording company only serve as the distributor.\n\nBack to the original subject of this story: the different pop genres of EDM (or the different EDM genres of pop). So far there are four genres:\n\nSynth-pop/Electro-pop\n\nEurodance/Europop\n\nDance-pop\n\nNu Synth-pop/Nu Electro/Electroclash\n\nLet’s start with Synth-pop and Electro-pop.\n\nSynth-pop and Electro-pop both originated in the 80’s. Due to the success of Electro-pioneers Kraftwerk, mostly European pop artists incorporated synthesizer sounds into their works, resulting in the typical 80’s sound. Classical Synth-pop songs are “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)” by Eurythmics, “Just Can’t Get Enough” by Depeche Mode, “Take On Me” of A-ha, “Sometimes” by Erasure, “Big In Japan” by Alphaville, I could go on and on.\n\nElectro-pop is seen as the harder, more electronic oriented form of Synth-pop, it seems to feature less lyrics and focus more on the synth sounds. The distinction is often not that clear. Electro-pop is more like “Blue Monday” by New Order, “Are ‘Friends’ Electric” by Tubeway Army, “The Model” by Kraftwerk, “Tainted Love” by Soft Cell or “Our Darkness” by Anne Clark.\n\nSynth-pop and Electro-pop are often conflated with New Wave. New Wave is a form of rock music that used synthesizer sounds. Think like “The Final Countdown” by Europe, “Such A Shame” by Talk Talk or “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” by Simple Minds. The distinction is, again, often not that clear. Both Synth-pop and New Wave have rock elements to it. Synth-pop for instance has the band structure of rock music but it uses less guitars and more synths. The difference is rather in degree than category. So it isn’t that bad if you mix the two up.\n\nSynth-pop and Electro-pop are limited to the 80’s. European-oriented Synth-pop received a backlash by American rock lovers as it wasn’t real music (yeah, even back then that argument existed). The eccentric gender fluidity of Synth-pop artists didn’t help either in traditional America. The last successful Synth-pop song was “Enjoy The Silence” by Depeche Mode in 1990. In the 90’s, EDM has evolved into House, Techno and Trance and pop music oriented itself towards those genres (but later more about that). However, Synth-pop secured the place of synthesizers in pop music.\n\nAs such, it would be wrong to take the dictionary definition of Synth-pop/Electro-pop and blatantly tell people that modern EDM pop music like Lady Gage is Electro-pop/Synth-pop as YouTuber Jonathan Miller did:\n\nSo Synth-pop was dead in the 90’s, what replaced it? The answer is: Eurodance (or Europop). Eurodance is EDM pop music produced in (or popularised in, in the case of Scatman John) Europe. Pretty straightforward, right?\n\nThe first breakthrough happened in 1989 with “Pump Up The Jam” by Flemish-Belgian group Technotronic. I think “Ride On Time” by Italian group Black Box is debatable, as the vocals and synthesizer sounds are more similar to the diva-like Garage House of New York.\n\nThe difference between Eurodance and Synth-pop lies in the evolved technology of the electronic sounds and the general positive vibe. Eurodance is happy, sunny and tropical, almost all 90’s summer anthems are Eurodance: “We’re Going To Ibiza” by Vengaboys, “Barbie Girl” by Aqua, “What Is Love” by Haddaway, “I Like To Move It” by Reel 2 Real, “The Rhythm of the Night” by Corona, “Coco Jamboo” by Mr. President, “Right In The Night (Fall In Love With Music)” by Jam & Spoon… At the same time, Ibiza in the Mediterranean Sea became the party island and Eurodance is its theme song.\n\nEurodance is a mash-up of it’s time: it can contain influences from Hip House, Happy Rave music, House, Techno or Trance. Eurodance is clearly a form of pop music: it focuses more on the lyrics and the lead singer than the underlying electronic music. The synth riff is meant to be catchy, energetic and dance-able.\n\nEurodance is not the same as Euro House, which was also popular back then but was a lot more oriented towards the DJ, the clubs and the synthesizer sounds. The lyrics are often minimal (only in support of the synth line), sampled and in some cases the songs are purely instrumental. Famous Euro House songs are “Drop It” by Scoop, “God Is A DJ” and “Insomnia” by Faithless, “Plastic Dreams” by Jaydee, “Drop That Beat” by Ixxel, “King Of My Castle” by Wamdue Project, “Encore Une Fois” by Sash!, “Touch Me” by Rui Da Silva, “The Spirit” by Fiocco,…\n\nThe line gets blurred often, should “No Limit” by 2 Unlimited or “Magic Flight” by 2 Fabiola (both live acts of two house DJ’s) be considered Eurodance or Euro House? Both categorisations are valid, it depends on your perspective.\n\nEurodance never really died, although Eurodance hits became more rare from the 2010’s. Summer anthem “Tacata” by Tacabro and 2012’s Eurovision Winner “Euphoria” by Loreen can still be seen as Eurodance. Eurodance as such is not produced that much as it became more of a nostalgia genre that you play at “foute parties” (that’s Dutch for “wrong parties”, parties meant to get drunk).\n\nHowever, America wouldn’t be America if it didn’t hop the bandwagon. Initially, Eurodance wasn’t even remotely successful in Hip hop and Rock-oriented America. But the big record companies in the 2000’s did see potential in Eurodance. What if they took Eurodance-style music and put it with an American pop singer? It also helped that boys bands such as Five made Eurodance commercially viable for the American public.\n\nEnter Dance-pop. Dance-pop is very similar to Eurodance, but with American or non-European singers. The theme is much less sunny compared to Eurodance but it is still very club-oriented. Dance-pop songs are “Can’t Get You Out Of My Head” by Kylie Minogue, “Poker Face” by Lady Gaga, “Starships” by Nicki Minaj, “TiK ToK” by Ke$ha, “I Gotta Feeling” by Black Eyed Peas,… Although, “Evacuate The Dancefloor” by German Cascade is more Dance-pop than Eurodance.\n\nWhile Eurodance did somewhat respect the DJ-producer behind the music, American dance-pop didn’t. Often, these were Europeans who hoped for a breakthrough in America. They didn’t get the full credit for their work. It is unimaginable today, but David Guetta co-produced “I Gotta Feeling” in 2009 but wasn’t mentioned as an artist as he wasn’t a big star… Dance-pop gave pop a bad name.\n\nDance-pop songs did help the breakthrough of EDM in America. Today, DJ-producers of European decent like David Guetta or Calvin Harris get the full credit and are as big celebrities as the American pop singers they collaborate with."
