        "text": "Great Britain in the early 1980s. The musical landscape had shifted at an exponential rate as musicians challenged artistic and social orthodoxies while embracing emerging musical technologies. Punk music peaked in the late 1970s with acts such as the Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Jam crossing over to the mainstream. New Wave took hold, applying synthetic textures, world-influenced rhythms, and art-school sensibilities to punk’s antiestablishment posturing and rebellious attitude. Bands like New Order, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Talk Talk, the The, and Pet Shop Boys dominated the charts, trading in distorted guitars for synthesizers.\n\nAt the same time, a mellower subgenre emerged, one which combined pop sensibilities with refined arrangements that were inspired by jazz, avant-garde classical music, and soul. Retroactively dubbed “sophisti-pop,” this collection of English bands, which included the Style Council, Prefab Sprout, the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Scritti Politti, Everything but the Girl, and many others, was looking simultaneously to the past and the future, and, in the process, they created a uniquely smooth sonic experience.\n\nSophisti-pop was as much a cultural movement as it was a musical movement with artists adopting an elegant yet understated fashion that set the stage for late-’80s yuppie chic. On top of that, sophisti-pop bands were perfectionists in the studio who leveraged the era’s cutting-edge technology to create albums that were ideal for the high-fidelity stereo systems of the time.\n\nJoin us as we reflect on four seminal sophisti-pop albums and examine the ’80s’ most elegant genre!\n\nWhen the World Knows Your Name: Sophisti-pop on the Charts\n\nFrom the blue-eyed soul of Simply Red to the ultra-suede grooves of Sade, the sounds of sophisti-pop were ever present in the mid-1980s. In the US, Spandau Ballet’s “True” was a massive sophisti-pop song that continues to receive regular airplay. Another enduring example is Swing Out Sister’s buoyant hit “Breakout,” a staple of adult contemporary radio stations. Other bands, including Johnny Hates Jazz, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue, and Everything but the Girl, may not have the name recognition they once did, but they have all retained dedicated fan bases with hundreds of thousands of monthly listeners on the popular streaming services.\n\nHowever, the strongest testament to the lasting impact of sophisti-pop is its embrace by current artists, who have launched something of a sophisti-pop revival. In the last decade, the sounds and style of sophisti-pop have re-emerged with elements of the genre showing up on albums by Canadian R&B band Rhye and indie icon Destroyer as well as HAIM, Christine and the Queens, and the War on Drugs. And, in 2020, the 1975 (whose front man, Matthew Healy, cites the Blue Nile’s Hats as his favorite record) scored a hit with “If You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know),” a sonic homage to sophisti-pop.\n\nCheck out Sweetwater’s official sophisti-pop playlist on Spotify to hear some of our favorite sophisti-pop songs of the 1980s as well as modern tracks inspired by the elegant subgenre!\n\nMaking Sophisti-pop with Modern Gear\n\nIf you’re interested in integrating sophisti-pop into your music, we’ve compiled a short list of gear that will help you capture the vibe. Unlike New Wave, sophisti-pop was primarily played on traditional rock-band instruments and augmented with synths, horns, and electronic drum machines. The most important aspect of the sophisti-pop sound is clean tones with subtle modulation effects, delay, and reverb. At the time, artists were using a combination of analog and digital effects, and they were eager to employ the latest technology. Modern equivalents are easy to come by today.
