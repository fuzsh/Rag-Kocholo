        "text": "There's a saying in England: \"It's grim up north.\" In winter, the darkness looms at 3.45pm, cloaking the decaying post-industrial landscape. Marauding kids smash the windows of abandoned factories with bricks, their retreating figures illuminated lethargically by orange sodium streetlights.\n\nThat's what southerners think, anyway. And that's definitely what it was like when New Order's frontman Bernard Sumner was a kid.\n\n\"It was grimmer then,\" he offers. In his 2014 memoir, Chapter and Verse, he details a childhood in Salford, Greater Manchester, in the '60s, set against a backdrop of the Moors Murders and Cold War tensions. The first chapter is peppered with grim descriptions indeed – \"cold\", \"grey\", \"bleak\", \"sparse\" – and hanging over it all is the perpetual threat of a bashing.\n\nYet for New Order, it's this unforgiving landscape that has fashioned their sound, even 39 years on from first forming as austere post-punk band, Joy Division (which became New Order after the death of frontman Ian Curtis). One of the most popular bands of the last half century, they've topped the charts with hits such as Blue Monday and Regret, but even at their poppiest there's a brutality in the beats. A euphoric swelling of synths is counterbalanced with flat vowels and cautious contemplation. A yearning couplet is hemmed in by a squelching bass line in a gimp mask. This dichotomy is at the heart of every album, and the effect is disquieting and restless – \"like life\", as Sumner puts it.\n\n\"People ask what were your influences, but our environment was the biggest,\" he says. \"Perhaps it instils a feeling of melancholy. The Beach Boys came from LA, Kraftwerk came from Dusseldorf, we came from Manchester, and each of those groups captured the mood where they lived.\"\n\nSumner is in his home studio as we speak, in a village far removed from the hedonism New Order were known for in the '80s, when they were signed to Factory Records and part-owners of Manchester nightclub the Hacienda – itself the epicentre of ecstacy culture.\n\nAfter a show at London's Royal Albert Hall he'll prep to come to Sydney, for Vivid LIVE. \"I'm a keen sailor and I've sailed past the Opera House a few times but never been inside,\" says Sumner. There'll be no gadding about on the harbour this trip. New Order play two nights as a band and two further nights with the Australian Chamber Orchestra. Given that Sumner's gateway into music as a teenager was through the scores of Ennio Morricone (again, celebrating a harsh terrain), the orchestra makes sense.\n\nAdditionally there's the New Order Project, also at the Opera House: talks with the band, photographer Kevin Cummins and journalist Paul Morley; screenings of movies about New Order and Joy Division; exhibitions of Peter Saville's art work and Cummins' photos.\n\nVivid's project is so extravagant it's virtually a posthumous honour, and yet the band – drummer Stephen Morris, keyboard player Gillian Gilbert, bassist Tom Chapman and guitarist Phil Cunningham – are in full flight. Last September, their 10th studio album, Music Complete, went to number two in Britain; not bad considering it was their first release in a decade. An extended-mix album, Complete Music, came out yesterday. Both feature well-chosen collaborators, including the Chemical Brothers' Tom Rowlands (whose production is breathtakingly savage), La Roux, Iggy Pop and The Killers' Brandon Flowers.\n\nMost notably, New Order have ditched the guitars of the previous three albums and returned to the dance-floor that spawned them. Listen hard and you'll catch flashbacks of vintage synth sounds from their '80s and '90s hits. For fans, it's an elating game of nostalgia.\n\n\"We've gone both forwards and backwards,\" Sumner confirms. \"Now you can get computer-modelled synthesisers of ones we used years ago. If you hark back to the old days we had two synthesisers and we squeezed out every last drop. We went back to that mentality.\"\n\nIt's a great idea. Most bands wind up as a pastiche of themselves. New Order wink at the past and forge ahead. The secret to their endurance is the fact they've never hitched a ride on any movement. They side-stepped the new romantic era, Britpop and even baggy, the key bands of which – Stone Roses and Happy Mondays – they influenced.\n\nBand tension being a conduit for creativity is an urban myth.\n\nBernard Sumner\n\nVisually, it's the same story. Sumner's had the same haircut since he was in short trousers, and New Order were unmoved by changing fashions. Very few '80s bands managed to survive into the '90s, let alone without embarrassing pictures. \"We just thought dressing up looked naff,\" he says, of Blitz kids and cock rock. \"Even with Joy Division we used to get our clothes from Oxfam shops. We didn't like the sort of clothes people were wearing in popular culture.\"\n\nWhile New Order didn't buy into any movement, their Hacienda club was the sun around which acid house orbited. Sumner was in his early 30s when 1988 was dubbed Britain's Second Summer of Love. Balearic beats crept into the New Order oeuvre, as the band spent more and more nights of the week as punters at their own club.\n\n\"I was burned out with touring because things had got very hedonistic,\" he recalls. \"I ended up in hospital in Chicago. I thought, 'I'm going to end up dead like Hendrix if this carries on, f--k this. I want to chill out and spend some time at home.' But with acid house kicking off, I went out of the frying pan and into the fire.\"\n\nAgain, there was that strange dichotomy. The clubbers may have been loved-up, but gangs ran rife. Sumner recalls one incident in which a man chased a bouncer through the club with a machine-gun. \"We thought, that is just ridiculous. We're supposed to be musicians. We shouldn't be involved in this kind of shit.\"\n\nNew Order were also up to their necks financially, with Factory Records going bankrupt and the Hacienda hemorrhaging money. It caused a rift between bassist Peter \"Hooky\" Hook and the others. He wanted to keep the club open, they wanted to cut their losses. The acrimony reached a head in 2007, when Hooky announced in a radio interview that New Order had split up – unbeknownst to the others. The band reformed without him in 2011, and since then they've made few moves without their former bassist offering a running commentary to the press. He's also launched a lawsuit over unpaid royalties and the use of the name.\n\nNo member has been spared Hooky's barbs, but it's Sumner who cops the most flack. Hooky, who seemed to be the reactive wildcard in a notoriously stoic band, recently told the Billboard website, \"We very rarely spoke about anything in depth to do with Joy Division … Even after Ian's sad demise, we never planned or talked about how we felt after Ian's suicide\". After reviewing Sumner's memoir for the publication, he said, \"I remain none the wiser\".\n\nIt's true that Sumner's guardedness means there are few emotional scenes. When Gillian Gilbert leaves the band for a decade to care for a sick daughter, she barely gets a paragraph. Only the fights with Hooky leap from the page. I ask Sumner if artistic tension can be viable for creativity, or if it's overrated. His voice stiffens.\n\n\"Completely overrated,\" he says. \"If you've got someone who's being a pain in the arse it's just a roadblock. Band tension being a conduit for creativity is an urban myth.\"\n\nSumner has been portrayed by actors in films twice – Anton Corbijn's Control and Michael Winterbottom's 24 Hour Party People – as well as suffering the slings and arrows of Hooky. Is he at peace with the fact that he can't orchestrate how he's portrayed?\n\n\"You've got to have a pretty thick skin to be in this business,\" he concedes. \"On the other hand, you've got to be sensitive in order to write music. I've been a musician since I was 21. I don't care what people say about me. I see myself in the mirror every morning when I have a shave. I'm a normal person, like anyone else.\"\n\nWell … apart from doing rock-starry things like sailing to the Caribbean.\n\n\"Yeah, but I got into that before I was a rock star. I used to sail little boats on the Norfolk Broads. In Salford everything was red brick and tarmac, then I remember going to the seaside with my grandparents and thinking, what is this?\"\n\nIn his memoir, he's included a black and white photograph of him huddled with his mother and grandparents on a dismal-looking Welsh beach. On the next page he's tanned, twentysomething, and swinging his toddler son around in the aqua shallows of Nassau in the Bahamas. A few yachts are dotted about.\n\nHe laughs at this. \"But I actually prefer the place I was photographed with my grandparents,\" he insists. Of course he does. \"Anyway, when I was in Nassau, everyone was trying to sell me drugs all the time.\"\n\nNew Order appear at Vivid LIVE, June 1,2,4,5.\n\nLooking for the light\n\nLast year, British photographer of rock bands, Kevin Cummins, published the collection New Order, and it's fair to say his intense depictions of the band over the decades – and Joy Division before them – massively contributed to their overall aesthetic.\n\nCummins' black-and-white shot of a gaunt Sumner was taken in the dressing room at the Hacienda in May 1983. \"I wanted a strong portrait of Bernard for The Face and just worked around him as Gillian spoke to him,\" Cummins recalls. \"They were in a good mood. Probably happy that the club had managed to make it to its first birthday.\"\n\nBy contrast, the relaxed image on our cover of Sumner by a swimming pool was taken in Washington DC, two months later. \"It was their first US tour,\" says Cummins. \"I wanted to give it a David Hockney, Brit-in-the-USA feel; coming out of the shadows, new optimism. They loved it because they just lay by a pool while I did all the work.\"\n\nKevin Cummins appears at Vivid LIVE Talks: 1) Photographing Joy Division and New Order, June 2, 6pm. 2) Manchester: Looking for the Light Through the Pouring Rain, June 4, 4.30pm. Both free, at Concert Hall, Northern Foyers."
