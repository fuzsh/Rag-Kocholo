        "text": "How does it feel?\n\n‘Blue Monday’ by New Order is the best-selling 12inch single of all time, selling over 1.16 million copies. The Manchester band’s dance hit was a huge success, despite label owners Factory Records making a loss on each copy sold due to the complexity of the sleeve design.\n\nWe think it’s one of the greatest hits of all time, find out more about the song below.\n\nWhat was the inspiration for ‘Blue Monday’?\n\nAlthough it was overwhelmingly a dance record, ‘Blue Monday’ fused inspiration from 70s Disco, house music, synth-pop and the New York club scene.\n\nIt has often been described as the record that cemented New Order’s transition from alternative punk as Joy Division to alternative dance heavyweights.\n\nWho wrote ‘Blue Monday’?\n\n‘Blue Monday’ was written by New Order – Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris and recorded in 1982. Bernard Sumner wrote most of the lyrics whilst under the influence of drugs. It’s also one of the longest charting singles ever at 7.25!\n\nIs ‘Blue Monday’ about Ian Curtis?\n\n‘Blue Monday’ was released three years after the death of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis although it does not appear to be influenced by the sad passing of their former bandmate.\n\nThe title of the track was inspired by a book that drummer Stephen Morris was reading at the time called ‘Breakfast Of Champions of Goodbye Blue Monday’ by science fiction author Kurt Vonnegut, published in 1973.\n\nDid ‘Blue Monday’ get to number one?\n\nThe song has been a hit several times in the UK, after remixes in 1988 and 1995. It charted twice upon its initial release in March 1983, reaching number 12 then re-entering the chart later that year to score number 9.\n\nWhat is the “Blue Monday’ artwork?\n\nJust like many of the other notable Factory Records releases, the artwork for ‘Blue Monday’ was designed by Factory designer Peter Saville. The sleeve does not feature the group name or song, only the single’s Factory number ‘FAC SEVENTY THREE’ on the spine.\n\nThe sleeve was die-cut with a silver inner sleeve and the cover made to look like a floppy disc, with the words ‘FAC 73 BLUE MONDAY AND THE BEACH NEW ORDER’ represented in code as a series of coloured blocks.\n\nThe production costs of the single was so high that Factory made a loss of around 5p on each record sold. Peter Saville suggested that nobody expected it to be a success and so the cost issue was not thought through.\n\nCheck out some of the biggest artists, then and now:\n\nRead more:\n\nEverything Liam and Noel Gallagher have said about an Oasis reunion\n\nQueen: The band who gave us 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and many more hits\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio.
