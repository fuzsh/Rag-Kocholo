        "text": "What is Music Genre?\n\nMusic is grouped into genres to describe the music’s form, style, and cultural influence. From classical to hip-hop, there are countless numbers of genres. It would be impossible to cover them all in one blog! Get started with this list of music genres your band and orchestra student will likely encounter during their middle school, junior high, and high school years.\n\nClassical Music\n\nDid you know classical music has a double meaning? There is a time span called the Classical period from 1750-1820. This period starts with works of J.S Bach, through the life of Mozart, and ends with the death of Beethoven. These heavy hitters defined this important period in music.\n\nOn the flipside, we have the music genre called classical. The classical music genre encompasses music composed between the 6th century through the present time. In such an extremely long period of time, it can seems confusing to identify what actually qualifies as classical music. One quick shorthand is music that is not rock, jazz, pop or other contemporary music. Here is how the famous composer of West-Side Story, Leonard Bernstein, defines classical music.\n\nTraditional Music\n\nTraditional music is also known as folk music. This genre has regained mass appeal in the last few years. One reason for this rise is the phenomenon of famous music artists using more traditional instruments, such as banjo, in their tracks. More orchestra programs are teaching Fiddle and Mariachi music in their classrooms. Traditional music contains tunes and songs that have been performed over several generations. Frequently, this music is taught without sheet music through rote teaching methods. Rote is a way of learning songs by call and response. The instructor plays a small musical phrase, and the class repeats it. Those small musical phrases are joined together until the tune is learned.\n\nKatie Senn is the Content and Community Engagement Manager for West Music. Her background is in music education, with an emphasis in orchestral directing and cello. She performs regularly around the midwest with her all-female folk band Awful Purdies. She serves her local community as a board member for the following organizations: Iowa City Music Auxilary, Kennedy Center’s Any Given Child, and her children’s before and afterschool program."
