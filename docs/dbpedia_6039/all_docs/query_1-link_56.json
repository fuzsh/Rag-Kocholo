He called it \"an old, long song about a guy at a depressing piano bar.\"\n\nDoes Jimmy Page Worship The Devil? A Look at Satanism in RockSong Writing\n\nWe ring the Hell's Bells to see what songs and rockers are sincere in their Satanism, and how much of it is an act.\n\nYacht Rock QuizFact or Fiction\n\nChristopher Cross with Deep Purple? Kenny Loggins in Caddyshack? A Fact or Fiction all about yacht rock and those who made it.\n\nDonny OsmondSongwriter Interviews\n\nDonny Osmond talks about his biggest hits, his Vegas show, and the fan who taught him to take \"Puppy Love\" seriously.\n\nChristmas SongsFact or Fiction\n\nRudolf, Bob Dylan and the Singing Dogs all show up in this Fact or Fiction for seasonal favorites.\n\nLittle Big TownSongwriter Interviews\n\n\"When seeds that you sow grow by the wicked moon/Be sure your sins will find you out/Your past will hunt you down and turn to tell on you.\""
