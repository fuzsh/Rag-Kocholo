        "text": "Back in the day I was strictly a rock guy ... If it wasn't guitars, drums and bass, I probably wasn't going to listen to it.\n\nIn the early eighties I was adrift at sea, as most of the newer albums had a synthesiser base and it took me a while to accept that as a valid form of music ... I know, I was a bad person, but give me a break I was only twelve to fifteen in the time frame we are looking at...\n\nOne of the first albums I accepted to my aural landscape with these dreaded synths was actually Genesis, And then there were three. As I became more used to this musical landscape I was quite taken by Howard Jones and his \"One Man Tour\" ... When I heard the Human's Lib album, I really enjoyed it and I had a whole new landscape to explore.\n\nIn 1985 New Order released Their Lowlife album, and to this day it remains my favourite New Order Album. Unfortunately (in my opinion) Thieves Like Us and Shellshock didn't make it onto the album. Shellshock may have been a little too late and I guess they just wanted Thieves to be a single. If those two tracks had been on it, I reckon it would have been one of the greatest albums ever. As it stands it is still a fantastic album.\n\nThe album seems almost structured to help folks move from the early Joy Division type sound to the new synth based New Order type sound ....\n\nAnyhow lets take a look at this great album.\n\nI hope you'll join me.\n\nLow-Life\n\nCover of UK vinyl issue\n\nStudio album by New Order\n\nReleased 13 May 1985\n\nRecorded 1984\n\nStudio Jam and Britannia Row Studios, London\n\nGenre\n\nSynth-pop[1][2]\n\npop[3]\n\ndance-pop[4]\n\npost-punk[2]\n\nLength 40:05\n\nLabel Factory\n\nProducer New Order\n\nNew Order chronology\n\nPower, Corruption & Lies\n\n(1983) Low-Life\n\n(1985) Brotherhood\n\n(1986)\n\nSingles from Low-Life\n\n\"The Perfect Kiss\"\n\nReleased: 13 May 1985\n\n\"Sub-culture\"\n\nReleased: 28 October 1985\n\nLow-Life is the third studio album by English rock band New Order, released on 13 May 1985 by Factory Records. It is considered to be among the band's strongest work, displaying the moment at which they completed its transformation from post-punk hold-overs to dance rockers. The album shows New Order's increased incorporation of synthesisers and samplers, while still preserving the rock elements of their earlier work. The original Factory CD versions of the album are mastered with pre-emphasis.\n\nThe songs on this album formed the basis of the band's live concert video Pumped Full of Drugs, filmed in Tokyo shortly before the album's release. The music video for \"The Perfect Kiss\" was directed by Jonathan Demme.\n\nThe song \"Elegia\" was featured in the Academy Award-nominated short film More by Mark Osborne, and was also used in the E3 2015 trailer for the video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and the Netflix series Stranger Things.\n\nThe album's artwork is the only New Order release to feature photographs of the band members on its cover. The CD comes packaged with drummer/keyboardist Stephen Morris on the front cover, but inside the case are four photographs and a semi-transparent piece of paper with the band's name, allowing the owners to choose which band member is seen through the sleeve.\n\nThe album was preceded by the release of the full-length version of \"The Perfect Kiss\" as a single (only an edited version appears on the album). John Robie's remix of \"Sub-culture\" was also released as a 12\" single. Both of these extended versions eventually were included on 1987's Substance.\n\nIn 2008, the album was re-released in a Collector's Edition with a bonus disc, including the previously unreleased 17-minute complete version of \"Elegia\" and, for the first time in digital format, the unedited 12\" mix of \"The Perfect Kiss\".\n\nn a contemporary review of Low-Life for the Los Angeles Times, Richard Cromelin stated that New Order's \"varied menu of soul-pop, techno-rock, delicate instrumental moods, and driving, clattering percussion offers adventure in texture at every turn\", and that while the album did not contain anything as \"transcendent\" as \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", \"its confidence and imagination suggest that the possibility is still there.\"[13] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice noted New Order's attempt to insert some \"affect\" into its music and wrote that the band \"has its heart (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) in the right place, so one doesn't want to quibble\".[12] Despite panning \"Love Vigilantes\" as \"an appallingly naive self-parody\", Steve Sutherland of Melody Maker wrote that the remainder of the album \"boasts the most articulate sound since The Cocteaus' Treasure, elevating depression to ecstasy\".[14]\n\nJohn Bush of AllMusic wrote that Low-Life was \"in every way, the artistic equal\" of Power, Corruption & Lies, as well as \"the point where the band's fusion of rock and electronics became seamless.\"[3] The A.V. Club's Josh Modell similarly noted that the album \"completely locked the disco influences into sync with New Order's pop leanings.\"[5] David Quantick, writing in Uncut, felt that Low-Life was \"the first New Order album that sounds like an album\", with Bernard Sumner's \"most human lyrics\" complementing Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris' \"pop axis\" and Peter Hook's \"breath-taking\" bass performances.[11] In 2000, Q magazine placed Low-Life at number 97 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.[15] Low-Life, alongside New Order's 1989 album Technique, was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[16]\n\nNew Order\n\nBernard Sumner – vocals, guitars, melodica, synthesizers, electronics and programming, percussion\n\nPeter Hook – 4 and 6-stringed bass, electronic percussion, backing vocals on \"This Time of Night\"\n\nStephen Morris – drums, synthesizers, electronics and programming\n\nGillian Gilbert – synthesizers, guitars, electronics and programming\n\nProduction\n\nNew Order – production\n\nMichael Johnson – engineering\n\nMark, Penny and Tim – tape operators\n\n1. \"Love Vigilantes\" 4:16\n\n2. \"The Perfect Kiss\" 4:51\n\n3. \"This Time of Night\" 4:45\n\n4. \"Sunrise\" 6:01\n\n5. \"Elegia\" 4:56\n\n6. \"Sooner Than You Think\" 5:12\n\n7. \"Sub-culture\" 4:58\n\n8. \"Face Up\" 5:02\n\n2008 collectors edition 2nd disc\n\n1. \"The Perfect Kiss\" (12\" version) 8:49\n\n2. \"Subculture\" (John Robie Remix) 7:26\n\n3. \"Shellshock\" 6:28\n\n4. \"Shame of the Nation\" (12\" version) 7:55\n\n5. \"Elegia\" (Full version) 17:28\n\n6. \"Let's Go\" (from \"Salvation!\" soundtrack, 1988) 3:43\n\n7. \"Salvation Theme\" (from \"Salvation!\" soundtrack, 1988) 2:16\n\n8. \"Dub vulture\" 7:56\n\n------------------------------\n\nAs i say, i really like this album I think the Los Angeles Times writer summed it up perfectly up there. This album certainly does offer adventures in texture at every turn. I don't agree with the Melody Maker review, as I personally find Love Vigilantes to be a fantastic song and the perfect opener for the album.\n\nAnyhow, we all know how these threads roll.\n\nFor now please let us know your thoughts on this album and tomorrow morning I will roll out the first track.\n\nDo You like the album?\n\nWhere were you at when it first came out? (were you already a fan? was this something new for you?)\n\nGive us your input please.\n\nThe \"Artwork\" section is bizarre with all its talk about \"the cd\". \"Low Life\" did come out on CD in 1985 - the first NO album to do so - but Peter Saville definitely had planned the onion skin design (a visual metaphor for the mystery shrouding this band) for vinyl. Always loved the catalogue number: This is \"FACT 100\"!"
