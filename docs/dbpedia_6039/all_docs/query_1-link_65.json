        "text": "The style (or genre) of a piece of music is determined by a number of factors, including the types of sounds and patterns used, and also the tempo.\n\nYou probably have some idea about the genre of a song when you hear it, just based on your experiences as a music listener. Here are \"typical\" tempo ranges for a number of common genres:\n\nDub: 60-90 bpm\n\nHip-hop: 60-100 bpm\n\nHouse: 115-130 bpm\n\nTechno/trance: 120-140 bpm\n\nDubstep: 135-145 bpm\n\nDrum and bass: 160-180 bpm\n\nTry adjusting the tempo while this beat plays and listen to how it changes character, even if the pattern stays exactly the same."
