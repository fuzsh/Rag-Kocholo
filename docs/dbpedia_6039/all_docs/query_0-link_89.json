        "text": "We’ve made it to the end of another excellent year in music. Thanks for joining me this year and for sharing our love of synthpop and its many offshoots. See you again in 2023. I’ll continue to promote new music, mostly on Friday release days, and list my favorite tracks at the end of each month. Follow me on Facebook if you’d like to keep up with new posts.\n\nThe 25 albums below are the ones I enjoyed most this year. I hope you discover something below that you love as much as I do. I’ve included links to Spotify so you can sample these artists, and I’ve provided links to Bandcamp so you can invest in their futures. As always, if you do discover any artists on this list that you particularly love, I encourage you to purchase their music or merch.\n\nPreviously:"
