        "text": "The modern world is constantly telling working women to greet every workplace challenge head-on. But what if your job is playing in a band, and your husband is in said band with you, and one of your daughters gets sick, and you just can't spend months on the road anymore? How do you “lean in” to that particular problem?\n\nNew Order keyboardist and guitarist Gillian Gilbert faced this exact situation 15 years ago. As New Order were about to record seventh album Get Ready, Gilbert made the decision to leave the band she had helped rise from the ashes of Joy Division in 1980, following Ian Curtis’s suicide, when she was just 19 years old. “We were just coming out of Joy Division and a lot of people didn’t really like this New Order thing that was happening,” Gilbert says, laughing now. But the new band soon won fans over with their emotional, synth-driven songs, evolving from their take on Joy Division’s dark oeuvre (“Ceremony”) to their own genre of ebullient dance numbers like “Blue Monday,” “Temptation,” and “Fine Time.” New Order’s run continued through 1993’s Republic when the band went on hiatus, coming back together for gigs in 1998.\n\nBy 2001, the making of Get Ready was underway, but Gilbert found herself considering another break from the band in order to care for her young daughters, Grace and Matilda. This decision was made even more pressing by the fact that her youngest, infant Grace, had been diagnosed with the neurological disorder Transverse Myelitis, a frightening and rare disease that can leave patients paralyzed. As Gilbert and her husband, New Order drummer Stephen Morris, grappled with the diagnosis, Gilbert knew what she needed to do but still struggled with the same question facing working mothers everywhere: Should she leave her job to take care of her children? More specific questions loomed as well: Would that somehow be the end of New Order, the band that had been her life for decades? And if the band just carried on without her, what would that mean for Gilbert personally and professionally?\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough to cope with, Gilbert would find out in 2007 that she had breast cancer; she’s since recovered, and the battle made her even more adamant about rejoining New Order. Released last September, New Order‘s Music Complete was known for being the band’s first album without founding bassist Peter Hook and their debut on new label home Mute, but it was also their first album in 14 years to feature Gilbert back behind the keyboard. While there was an outcry from a small but vocal subset of fans when the band continued without Hook, few said much when Gilbert left. Following her departure, at which point keyboardist and guitarist Phil Cunningham joined the band, New Order embarked on a guitar-driven phase that was neither particularly strong nor beloved. With Gilbert now back in the fold, New Order returned to the dance-floor-ready electro-pop they helped invent during their ’80s heyday, and ended up making their best album in years.\n\nNot only is Gilbert more important to New Order’s sound than she has been given credit for, she should be considered a musical trailblazer. As one of the few women in the Manchester music scene of the ’80s, it’s worth acknowledging the reality of what Gilbert experienced. The frustration of being a girl in a boys’ club came on strong when it came to parenting. While New Order frontman Bernard Sumner and Hook both had children from the mid-’80s onward, the kids were taken care of by their mothers when late nights in the studio dominated band life. Gilbert and Morris, on the other hand, were in a tough spot: They could leave the kids with a nanny all day and all night, or Gilbert could head home at a decent hour. Either way, she felt guilty — until Grace got sick. Then her mom instincts took over.\n\nThis is Gilbert’s story of figuring out what worked for her, as a musician and as a mother:\n\nWhen I joined New Order, I was made to feel equal to everyone else in the band so I didn’t feel like an outsider. I was treated equally, I was paid equally, and my opinion was sought after. Having come from an all-girls environment, because in those days they had girls schools and boys schools and I had sisters, I didn’t really come across many men. To be thrown in that environment was a bit of an eye-opener, but I wasn’t made to feel any different, really.\n\nI think you only really start to notice the difference when you have children, and the men have someone looking after their children at home. I didn’t want children until my late thirties because my career was taking off and I was having such a good time in New Order. But when you have children, you have to make decisions; I always wanted to stay at home with my kids.\n\nIn the early days, me and Steve were the only ones that didn’t have children, but Bernard [Sumner] and Hooky [Peter Hook] did, so we didn’t really know what it was like. We could go to the studio at any time, stay up all night working on songs, stuff like that. But as soon as you have children — as soon as I had children — I tried to keep it 9 to 5, but you can’t really work like that in a band. Some people want to stay up writing, and they could carry on because they’ve got mums at home with their children.\n\nThere came a point before Grace was ill, that I was trying to accommodate everybody all at the same time. I just couldn’t, but you think you can. I didn’t have nannies, I had a nanny until six o’clock, but when you’re in the studio working it over and it gets to be 10 o’clock, that would cause the nannies’ problems. It was hard juggling.\n\nI remember my daughter, Matilda, starting school when she was about five, and we were due to go in the studio for a long stretch to finish ‘Get Ready’ and it was like, ‘Oh god.’ I remember Hooky saying to me, ‘Well, if you’re there, you’re there and if you’re not, you’re not.” It was very cutthroat. I’d like to think that wouldn’t happen anymore, but we didn’t think about those things then. When you had children, those were decisions that you made and not the rest of the band. I think at some point you just become an argumentative woman [to your bandmates]. If you say what you think, that’s wrong. You just get put down a lot. Hooky saying that I didn’t do anything in the early days is not true.\n\nI know it sounds horrible, but I knew there was probably going to come a point where it was the band versus the kids. I wouldn’t have liked to make that decision, but the decision was made for me. My daughter became ill when she was 18 months old, when I’d started ‘Get Ready.’ As we were going to finish the album and go touring in June, she got sick in really early March, which left her disabled. We had to go to hospital appointments because she became paralyzed from the waist down. She’s recovered, not fully, but she’s 15 now. She did need a lot of care when she was younger, so it’s just life.\n\nI didn’t want my daughter to be ill, but at the time I couldn’t think of going on tour with the children. Stephen did suggest that he stay home and I said no, no. I think he just said it, really [laughs]. I wanted to stay at home, it had become impossible to do both. I told them I was leaving and I was taken straight off the fax machine list.\n\nAfter that, I sort of put my head down and looked after my children, and I was getting paid from the back catalogue. I was happy — well, I wasn’t THAT happy at the time, because I was leaving New Order. You’re always thinking, “Was it the right decision? Will they get another woman keyboardist? It would be awful if they carried on without me.” But then New Order carried on and was fine without me.\n\nI’m glad I had a break and focused on something else, because I have loads of other things that I like doing. You need to have a break from what you’re doing. I think New Order should have done that too. But I suppose men just go on, don’t they?"
