        "text": "One of the hardest parts about living on my own is getting used to the silence.\n\nIt still strikes me as unusual and disconcerting.\n\nAs such, I don’t enjoy the silence and so I fill the place with music!\n\nAnyhow, a new sound that can now be heard regularly in my kitchen emanates from my new air fryer. I’m really enjoying experimenting with it though results have been mixed at best. When oh when will food manufacturers add air fryer cooking times to their packaging alongside those for the oven, microwave, frying pan, etc? I’m developing some rules of thumb but there is still an element of trial and error. Particularly the latter.\n\nThis month’s Mojo magazine features Depeche Mode as the “cover stars” and is accompanied by a 15 track CD of their “Classics, Rarities and Revelations”. Now, truth be told, I’ve never been a big DM fan and there is nothing on the CD that I ever need to hear again. However, there was an obscure mix of “Enjoy The Silence” which reminded me what a great tune the original was – DM channelling their inner New Order. In response, I listened to that on rotation for half an hour and then ordered the seven inch single from Discogs.\n\nFollowing this, I was musing on how to link together my new air fryer with Depeche Mode and suddenly remembered that I didn’t need to – instead, that’s a job for my digital chum ChatGPT who received the following instructions:\n\nI’ve just bought an air fryer and I am using it to replace a wok and a frying pan. I’ve used it to cook a stir fry, a curry and also chips. I’m also really enjoying listening to the song “Enjoy the Silence” by Depeche Mode. Can you please write me a punchy 200 word blog post that links my air fryer to Depeche Mode using humour and irony and written in the first person.\n\nWithin the usual few seconds, the young whippersnapper had concocted the following:\n\n“Enjoy the Silence” with my Air Fryer – A Culinary and Musical Journey\n\nI recently bought an air fryer, and I must say, it’s become my new kitchen obsession. I’ve been using it to cook everything from stir fry to chips, and it’s been replacing my trusty wok and frying pan. And while I cook, I’ve also been enjoying the sweet, sweet sounds of “Enjoy the Silence” by Depeche Mode.\n\nNow, you might be wondering what my air fryer has to do with a classic ’90s synth-pop hit. Well, let me tell you, there’s more to this than meets the eye. Just like the song’s title suggests, the air fryer creates a peaceful silence in the kitchen as it cooks without the need for a noisy exhaust fan. It’s like a culinary symphony, with the air fryer as the conductor and my taste buds as the audience.\n\nAnd just like how Depeche Mode is a trailblazer in the music industry, pushing boundaries with their innovative sound, my air fryer is a game-changer in the kitchen. It’s a revolutionary appliance that lets me cook my favorite dishes with less oil, less mess, and less hassle.\n\nSo, next time you’re cooking up a storm in the kitchen, put on “Enjoy the Silence” by Depeche Mode, fire up your air fryer, and experience the ultimate culinary and musical journey. Trust me, your taste buds and your ears will thank you for it.\n\nPretty good in parts, pretty lame in parts but you get what you pay for. In this case, it was free as usual.\n\nAnyhow, this is utter pop perfection.\n\nThe original track and then live on TV from back in the day.\n\nPlay loud!\n\nEvery time a World Cup gets underway, I inevitably resolve to try and post one song every day that has at least some (tenuous) relevance to one of the day’s matches.\n\nWith this in mind, I observed that the teams playing today are Senegal, Netherlands, USA, Wales, England and, ahem, Iran …..\n\nPresented with this open goal, I had no option but to post A Flock of Seagulls‘ stone-cold synth-pop classic “I Ran” which is possibly the weakest link that has ever been made with the repressive Islamic Republic. I’m pretty chuffed with that to be honest!\n\nAnyhow, apart from watching the matches and working my way through my various fantasy football entries, the main bulk of the day has been spent sorting out the central heating system which I’ve switched on today for the first time this winter. Having got it going, it became clear that no one had bled the radiators for some years and so I nipped out to buy a suitable metal gizmo to enable me to release all the air that was trapped in them. This took rather longer than I had anticipated and required me to fill up the central heating system using the somewhat hard to discover filling loop on the boiler. No matter, I got there in the end and I’m now starting to work out what temperature I can afford to keep the house at given the cost of gas …. another excuse for the meticulous recording of meter readings and some basic manipulation of a new spreadsheet!\n\nAnyhow, the Netherlands vs Senegal clash has just restarted after half time and with 5pm just having past, it’s time for a beer!\n\nThe original single version and video and then the longer LP version.\n\nPlay loud!\n\nWell with details now confirmed as to England’s forthcoming Euro 2020 (sic) clash with Germany next Tuesday, I felt honour bound to post one of the finest tunes to be produced by our Teutonic colleagues.\n\nThis is brutal synth pop that is a long way removed from Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, etc.\n\nNonetheless, it’s utterly mesmerising, compelling and relentless and right up there in its quality with classic “krautrock” tracks released a few years earlier by Can and Neu (see here for the former’s jawdropping “Vitamin C” from 1972 and here for the latter’s beautiful “Leb’ Wohl” from 1975.\n\nAnyhow, not much to add about this song. I would encourage you to interpret the lyrics with the sense of irony with which I believe they were written:\n\nGet up.\n\nShake your hips\n\nClap your hands\n\nAnd dance the Mussolini\n\nDance the Adolf Hitler\n\nMove your ass\n\nAnd dance the Jesus Christ\n\nNo matter, Tuesday will be a big night as England and Germany renew their longstanding football rivalry of 1966, 1970, 1990, 1996 and 2010 …\n\nNot to mention, of course, the wider “skirmishes” in 1914 and 1939 ….\n\nThe key thing is “don’t mention the war”.\n\nPlay loud!\n\nIt’s been a long, if somewhat unproductive day.\n\nI’ve not read as much as I planned and sorting out my various teams for the Euro 2020 (sic) fantasy football has been more time consuming than expected. Nonetheless, this investment is so far paying dividends in that I am in the top 1.25% of “managers” across each of the three platforms that I am competing on ….\n\nFrankly, I had little inspiration for what to post tonight but decided, in the end, to stick to the football theme.\n\nIn particular, I was looking for songs whose lyrics referenced more than one of the countries playing today – Russia, Finland, Wales, Turkey, Italy and Switzerland,\n\nIan Dury & The Blockheads’ magnificent “Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick” was an obvious contender referencing both Italy – “From Milan to Yucatan” and Wales – “In the dock of Tiger Bay”.\n\nBut Pet Shop Boys took the trick with their epoch defining, synth-pop highpoint “West End Girls”.\n\nOn every level this song delivers but the key lyric tonight is “From Lake Geneva to the Finland Station” …..\n\nJob done.\n\n“Fun fact” alert – which was the last European city to be devastated by a Tsunami …?\n\nC’mon, you don’t know this!\n\nThe answer is Geneva in 563AD. A landslide at one end of the lake resulted in massive waves at the other …….\n\nTo be honest, I fear that too much wine is starting to compromise the quality of my geographical wordplay this evening.\n\nNo matter, Finns can only get better, methinks.\n\nJust a perfect piece of pop music – the original video and then miming on Top Of The Pops!\n\nThe weather has been fantastic over the long Bank Holiday weekend and I’ve managed to get a little sunburnt. Despite this, a bit of sun does wonders for the complexion and my winter wanness will shortly be a thing of the past. On the other hand, my browner skin is heightening my awareness of how quickly I’m going grey at the moment. Ageing is a sobering business.\n\nOn the other hand, pubs are not a sobering business and that is where we are going tonight for a veggie burger and a quiz! I always “limber up” for such quizzes by randomly blurting out the answers to potential questions – “Harold Wilson”, “Manganese”, “Pearl Harbour”, “South Pacific”, “Ascension Island”, “Vitamin B12”, etc. To be honest, none of the quizzes that I’ve practiced for have actually posed a question requiring one of the answers I’ve rehearsed. No matter, this sort of “rejoinderal Tourette’s” does pass the time and irritate any family members in earshot – job done!\n\nI’m just over half way through Colin Brown‘s magnificent book about the Beatles, “One Two Three Four”, which is written as 150 short chapters (average length 4 pages). The stories, anecdotes and quotations come so thick and fast that I’m sure I will need to re-read it in due course. The chapter on John Lennon‘s love of puns was particulate early goon.\n\nAnother highlight of the day was this little snippet from this week’s issue of The Spectator. In an article on the importance of politeness (spot on!), the following exchange is reported between a former City editor of the Daily Telegraph. Confronted with a bumptious, narcissistic interviewee, he asked him how he’d describe himself.\n\n‘Clubbable,’ said the young show-off.\n\n‘Like a baby seal?’ asked the City editor.\n\nMagnificent.\n\nAnyhow, all of the above has no connection with why I’m posting both sides of New Order‘s magisterial “Thieves Like Us” single from 1984. By coincidence it was one of the last records I bought before I met my other half in Manchester that year but I’m actually posting it as another record co-written/produced by the legendary Arthur Baker – check here for the recent post featuring Freeez‘s magnificent “I.O.U” from 1983.\n\nI’ve posted the studio takes of “Thieves Like Us” and then “Lonesome Tonight”.\n\nBoth perfect. There are dozens of great live versions on YouTube but the two, below, are the only ones you really need.\n\nAnyhow, back to my quiz practice: “Ludwig Wittgenstein”, “Ian Botham”, “Champion the Wonder Horse”, “Halley’s Comet”, etc.\n\nYesterday, in the process of posting Shannon‘s outstanding electro/disco classic “Let The Music Play” from 1983 (here), I observed that there were a number of significant gaps on this blog from around that time and from within that genre.\n\nWhile I’ve previously posted C-Bank‘s outstanding “One More Shot” from 1982 (here), there are plenty more tracks to come.\n\n“I.O.U.” by Freeez is a case in point and it’s another tune that I have on both 7″ and 12″ vinyl.\n\nWhile the band are actually British, the song was written and produced by American producer Arthur Baker who is best known for his work with early hip hop artists such as Afrika Bambaataa and Planet Patrol (both of whom need to be introduced to this blog, pronto). He also produced “Confusion” which was the 1983 follow up single to New Order‘s monumental and era defining “Blue Monday” (how on earth is that not on the blog?!)\n\nAnyhow, I’ve not got much else to add tonight. The early 1980s were an incredibly fertile period for synth based dance music and I’m going to have to post plenty more over the coming weeks and months.\n\nThere really isn’t a bad version of this tune but check below for the original video and then the 12″ extended version.\n\nPerfect pop music.\n\nPlay loud!\n\nI’ve really enjoyed using my new Fitbit this week which I received as a birthday present to replace my existing Huawei fitness tracker.\n\nNot only does it not stream all my conversations straight back to some shady folk in Beijing, but the Fitbit also seems to be far more accurate in measuring activity, heart rate and sleep patterns.\n\nOn this basis, I reckon we’re well rid of Huawei from our 5G infrastructure. Even if people didn’t have any security concerns, I’d much rather that we used Fitbit to upgrade our broadband cellular networks given how much more reliable they seem to be …..\n\nAnyhow, I’ve not had a very productive week unearthing gems while working my way through the “S” artists in my CD collection. A number of Sonic Youth releases are now up for sale on Discogs.com and I’ve also given Sufjan Stevens and a few others the boot.\n\nI will also be saying goodbye to Sparks‘ 1979 album “No. 1 in Heaven” – it’s got a couple of great tracks on it but it’s not consistently good enough to want to listen to all the way through again.\n\nThe stand out track by far is “The Number One Song In Heaven” which I bought on 7″ single when it came out in 1979. It’s a fantastic synth pop collaboration with the electronica genius/pioneer Giorgio Moroder (check here for his stunning production of Donna Summer‘s “Working the Midnight Shift” and here for his epoch defining collaboration with her on “I Feel Love”).\n\nTwo versions, the 7″ single version and then the LP version which has a slightly ponderous overture before the tune, proper, kicks in.\n\nPerfect pop music!\n\nI was trading thoughts yesterday with a friend of mine at work who declared herself as believing that Spandau Ballet are “a bit naff”.\n\nNow, as a general conclusion about the band, this is unimpeachable ……\n\nNonetheless, I would draw attention to their quite outstanding debut single released in the dog days of 1980; the year that had seen the end of Ian Curtis and Joy Division.\n\nI probably heard this on the radio in Hong Kong for the first time in late 1980 or early 1981 – and without the “benefit” of any videos, etc.\n\nIf I had associated the tune with Tony Hadley‘s silly garb on Top of the Pops, it might have been downgraded. However, as a synth driven piece with great bass and drums, “To Cut A Long Story Short” was, and remains, a stone cold pop classic.\n\nFor final proof? I’ve elevated it to the pantheon of the bestmusicofalltime haven’t I?\n\nQ.E.D. and ’nuff said.\n\nThe original video, “live” on Top of the Pops and then the magnificent extended 12″ version.\n\nPerfect pop music!"
