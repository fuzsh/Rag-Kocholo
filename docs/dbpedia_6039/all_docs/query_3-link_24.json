        "text": "New Order got started in 1980 amid personal and political turmoil, reacting thoroughly against both.\n\nIt was formed by members of Joy Division after that band’s bleakly charismatic singer and leader, Ian Curtis, committed suicide. New Order submerged its lead singer, Bernard Sumner, within the band, to sing mostly with stiff-upper-lip composure. Meanwhile, Britain was plunging into a deep recession that would bring deep unemployment and labor upheavals. By instinct or design, the band responded with music that was tidy, systematic and seemingly imperturbable, even as its lyrics hold darker ideas. New Order held on to punk-rock’s Minimalism and drone and set aside the noise and dissonance, and the band soon went on to add the tireless, buoyant programmed beats of drum machines, bridging guitar-driven rock and electronic dance music in ways that have been imitated ever since.\n\nThe band made sure fans remembered its origins when it performed a sold-out show on Thursday at Radio City Music Hall. It started with “Singularity” from its 2015 album, “Music Complete,” its first set of new material in a decade; the song avowed, “For friends not here/We shed our tears” as video of bleak cities, youth unrest and punk-era fashion provocations flashed overhead. It was immediately followed by a song Joy Division wrote before Mr. Curtis’s death, which became New Order’s first single: “Ceremony.” The band ended the concert — because it ran out of time before its usual finale, its own “Blue Monday” — with Joy Division’s masterpiece “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” while the video screen proclaimed, “Joy Division Forever.”\n\nYet for most of the concert, New Order placed itself well outside Joy Division’s shadow. The identity that New Order has built for itself replaced Joy Division’s stark hollows with intricate patterns: the mixture of electronic beats with the indefatigable live drumming of Stephen Morris, bass lines that emerge as strong countermelodies (many of them originated by Peter Hook, who left New Order in 2007; Tom Chapman has replaced him), and a complex mesh of guitar and keyboard motifs. Its two-hour set oscillated between guitar-strumming, punk-rooted songs and more pointillistic electronic ones, but it leaned toward the dance floor."
