Here’s their version taken from a show at Manchester Cathedral in January 2013:\n\nWhich segues into a few noteworthy covers: Los Angeles darkwavers Cold Cave recorded a cover in 2016 for a New Order tribute website that no longer exists; Stereogum has some details on the provenance of the track:\n\nBrighton’s Fujiya & Miyagi offered a cover as their contribution to a 2012 Mojo cover CD, Power, Corruption & Lies Covered:"
