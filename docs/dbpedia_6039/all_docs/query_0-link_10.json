        "text": "Synth Pop\n\nHistory of Synthpop\n\nIn this article, we will explore the history of synthpop, from its technological origins to its cultural impact.\n\nSynthpop is a genre of electronic and pop music that first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the Krautrock of bands like Kraftwerk. Emerging as a distinct genre in Japan and the UK during the post-punk era, synthpop became a significant part of the new wave movement from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\nThe Dawn of Synthpop\n\nThe invention of the synthesizer was the most important technological advancement that led to the creation of synthpop. The first synthesizers were developed in the early 1950s, but they were large, expensive, and difficult to use. In the 1960s, synthesizers became more affordable and portable, and they began to be used by musicians to create new and innovative sounds.\n\nSynthpop Synthesizers\n\nOne of the most important early synthesizers was the Moog Minimoog. The Minimoog was released in 1970, and it was one of the first mass-produced synthesizers. It was also one of the first synthesizers to be used by popular musicians. Kraftwerk was one of the first bands to use the Minimoog, and they used it to create their signature electronic sound. Other early synthpop bands that used the Minimoog include Devo, Gary Numan, and OMD.\n\nAnother important early synthesizer was the ARP Odyssey. The Odyssey was released in 1972, and it was known for its warm and organic sound. It was used by a wide variety of musicians, including synthpop bands like The Human League, Ultravox, and Depeche Mode.\n\nEarly synthesizers were also used to create new and innovative drum sounds. The Roland TR-808 drum machine was released in 1980, and it quickly became the standard drum machine for synthpop bands. The TR-808 was used by bands like The Human League, OMD, and Depeche Mode to create their signature electronic beats.\n\nEarly synthesizers and drum machines were used by musicians to create a wide range of new and innovative sounds. These sounds were central to the development of synthpop in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nPrecipitation of Synthpop due to Cultural and Musical Shifts of the 1970s\n\nThe cultural and musical shifts in the 1970s also made the ground fertile for synthpop's emergence. The 1970s was a decade of experimentation and innovation in music. Many musicians were looking for new ways to express themselves, and they were drawn to the unique sound of the synthesizer.\n\nSome of the most important cultural and musical shifts that led to the emergence of synthpop include:\n\nThe rise of punk rock: Punk rock was a rebellious and experimental genre of music that emerged in the early 1970s. Punk rockers rejected traditional music values and experimented with new sounds and styles. This spirit of experimentation helped to pave the way for synthpop.\n\nThe development of new music technologies: In the 1970s, a number of new music technologies were developed, including the synthesizer, the drum machine, and the sequencer. These technologies allowed musicians to create new and innovative sounds that were not possible with traditional instruments.\n\nThe growing popularity of electronic music: Electronic music was becoming increasingly popular in the 1970s. Bands like Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra were using synthesizers to create new and futuristic sounds. The popularity of electronic music helped to create a demand for synthpop.\n\nSynthpop in the United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom is widely regarded as the birthplace of synthpop. In the mid-1970s, a new generation of British musicians began to experiment with synthesizers and electronic instruments. They were inspired by the German band Kraftwerk, whose pioneering work in electronic music had a profound impact on the British music scene.\n\nOne of the earliest synthpop bands in the UK was Ultravox, formed in 1974 by John Foxx and Billy Currie. Ultravox's early sound was heavily influenced by Kraftwerk, but they quickly developed their own unique style, which incorporated elements of art rock and glam rock.\n\nAnother early synthpop band was The Human League, formed in 1977. The Human League's early sound was more experimental than Ultravox's, but they eventually moved towards a more pop-oriented sound in the early 1980s.\n\nOther notable synthpop bands from the UK include OMD, Depeche Mode, New Order, The Cure, and Duran Duran. These bands all achieved mainstream success in the 1980s, and while not wholly synthpop, their music helped to define the synthpop sound.\n\nHistory of Synthpop in the United States\n\nSynthpop first emerged in the United States in the late 1970s, as a subgenre of new wave music. It drew inspiration from pioneering German bands like Kraftwerk and the Japanese band, Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). American synthpop artists were also inspired by the DIY ethos of punk rock, and they often used synthesizers and other electronic instruments to create new and innovative sounds.\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential American synthpop bands was Devo. Devo formed in Ohio in 1972, and they quickly developed a unique sound that combined elements of new wave, punk rock, and electronic music. Devo's music was often satirical and humorous, and they were known for their distinctive visual style, which incorporated elements of science fiction and technology.\n\nAnother important early American synthpop band was The Cars. The Cars formed in Boston in 1976, and their music was more pop-oriented than Devo's. However, The Cars were still one of the first American bands to embrace the use of synthesizers, and their music helped to popularize synthpop in the United States.\n\nSynthpop began to decline in popularity in the mid-1980s, as other genres of music, such as grunge and hip hop, began to emerge. However, synthpop has continued to have a cult following, and it has also influenced other genres of music, such as dance music and electronica.\n\nHistory of synthpop in Russia\n\nSynthpop emerged in Russia in the late 1970s. However, the development of synthpop in Russia was hindered by the Soviet government's strict censorship of music.\n\nSoviet Government Music Censoreship\n\nThe Soviet government censored music for a number of reasons, including:\n\nTo maintain control over the population: The Soviet government was a totalitarian regime, and it used censorship to control the flow of information and ideas. Music was seen as a powerful tool for communication, and the government wanted to ensure that only music that was in line with its ideology was released to the public.\n\nTo promote socialist realism: Socialist realism was the official artistic doctrine of the Soviet Union. It was a style of art that was supposed to depict the lives of ordinary people in a positive light. The Soviet government censored music that did not conform to the principles of socialist realism.\n\nTo suppress dissent: The Soviet government was very afraid of dissent, and it used censorship to suppress any music that was critical of the government or its policies.\n\nThe censorship of music in the Soviet Union was very strict. All music had to be approved by the state before it could be released. The government also controlled radio and television stations, and it only allowed music to be played that had been approved by the state.\n\nDespite the censorship, there was a thriving underground music scene in the Soviet Union. Many musicians released their music unofficially, and they often performed at secret concerts. The underground music scene was a way for musicians to express themselves freely and to challenge the government's ideology.\n\nThe censorship of music in the Soviet Union began to relax in the late 1980s, during the period of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). This led to a flourishing of new music genres in the Soviet Union, including synthpop.\n\nRussian Synthpop Bands\n\nDespite the challenges, a number of Russian synthpop bands emerged in the early 1980s. One of the earliest and most influential Russian synthpop bands was Forum. Forum was formed in 1983, and they quickly became one of the most popular bands in the Soviet Union. Forum's music was a unique blend of synthpop, rock, and traditional Russian music.\n\nOther notable Russian synthpop bands from the early 1980s include:\n\nKino\n\nNautilus Pompilius\n\nAria\n\nBravo\n\nTekhnologiya\n\nThese bands all achieved mainstream success in the Soviet Union, and their music helped to popularize synthpop in the country.\n\nPost Soviet Union Synthpop Bands\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian synthpop scene flourished. New bands emerged, and existing bands began to experiment with new sounds. Some of the most popular Russian synthpop bands from the 1990s and 2000s include:\n\nTatu\n\nGlukoza\n\nBi-2\n\nSplean\n\nZemfira\n\nThese bands all achieved international success, and their music helped to define the Russian synthpop sound of the era.\n\nSynthpop in Japan\n\nJapan was another major center of synthpop activity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Japanese synthpop scene was known for its innovative and eclectic sound, which incorporated elements of traditional Japanese music, Western pop music, and electronic music.\n\nOne of the most influential Japanese synthpop bands was Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). YMO was formed in 1978 by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono, and Yukihiro Takahashi. YMO's music was a unique blend of electronic music, rock music, and Japanese traditional music. They were one of the first Japanese bands to achieve international success, and their music had a major impact on the development of synthpop around the world.\n\nOther notable Japanese synthpop bands include P-Model, Hikashu, and Denki Groove. These bands all developed their own unique sounds, but they were all united by their shared love of electronic music and experimentation.\n\nSynthpop in Italy\n\nSynthpop emerged in Italy in the late 1970s. Italian synthpop bands often incorporated elements of traditional Italian music into their sound, creating a unique and innovative sound.\n\nOne of the most popular Italian synthpop bands of the early 1980s was Baltimora. Baltimora is best known for their hit single \"Tarzan Boy,\" which was released in 1985 and reached number one in several countries around the world.\n\nAnother popular Italian synthpop band of the era was Matia Bazar. Matia Bazar was known for their experimental and eclectic sound, which incorporated elements of pop, rock, and electronic music.\n\nOther notable Italian synthpop bands include Righeira, Gazebo, and Den Harrow.\n\nSynthpop in Spain\n\nSynthpop also emerged in Spain in the late 1970s. Spanish synthpop bands often incorporated elements of traditional Spanish music into their sound, creating a unique and innovative sound.\n\nOne of the most popular Spanish synthpop bands of the early 1980s was Mecano. Mecano was known for their catchy melodies and their innovative use of synthesizers.\n\nAnother popular Spanish synthpop band of the era was Alaska y Dinarama. Alaska y Dinarama was known for their flamboyant and provocative image, as well as their catchy synthpop songs.\n\nOther notable Spanish synthpop bands include Tino Casal, Kaka de Luxe, and Olé Olé.\n\nSynthpop in Australia\n\nAustralia synthpop also popped up in the late 1970s.\n\nOne of the most popular Australian synthpop bands of the early 1980s was Men at Work. Men at Work were known for their catchy melodies and their humorous songs, which often satirized Australian culture.\n\nAnother popular Australian synthpop band of the era was INXS. INXS were known for their energetic live performances and their eclectic mix of musical styles, which included synthpop, rock, and pop.\n\nOther notable Australian synthpop bands include Divinyls, Pseudo Echo, and Models.\n\nSynthpop Revival\n\nThe late 2000s and early 2010s witnessed a synthpop revival, marked by a renewed interest in the genre. This revival was fueled by a number of factors, including the rise of digital music and the increasing availability of vintage synthesizers.\n\nSome of the most influential bands of the synthpop revival include:\n\nThe Killers: The Killers were one of the first bands to achieve mainstream success with their synthpop-inspired sound. Their debut album, Hot Fuss, was released in 2004 and featured the hit singles \"Mr. Brightside\" and \"Somebody Told Me.\"\n\nFranz Ferdinand: Franz Ferdinand is another band that helped to popularize the synthpop revival.

The revival helped to popularize the use of electronic synthesizers and other electronic instruments in pop music. It also helped to introduce a new generation of fans to the synthpop sound.\n\nThe synthpop revival has also had a significant impact on the development of other genres of music, such as dance music and electronica. Many of the musicians who were involved in the synthpop revival have gone on to produce and remix music for other artists, and they have helped to shape the sound of dance music and electronica today.\n\nThe synthpop revival is an important chapter in the history of pop music.
