        "text": "I've recently grown to appreciate a genre that I never really paid much attention to, that being 1980s synth-pop, but I don't have much of it in my collection. For you synth-pop fans, I was wondering if you could recommend 3 essential synth-pop albums from the era, with allowances for the late 1970s and early 1990s. Thanks!\n\nIf you aren't familiar with much of the genre, three big albums from the early 80s are:\n\nSoft Cell- Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret\n\nDepeche Mode- Speak and Spell\n\nHuman League- Dare\n\nHuman League’s Dare, for sure. Their pre-Dare recordings are great, as well, but not really pop.\n\nI’m on board with jamsterdammer’s suggestions.\n\nI’m a fan of the first Flock of Seagulls record, as well. I guess they might be considered lightweights in the synth pop scene, but, hey, I’m a Monkees fan. “Space Age Love Song” is a great pop song.\n\nStella by Yello was popular when I was a DJ back then. Maybe you've heard \"Oh Yeah\"?\n\nExcellent album. Their earlier records on Ralph Records are a bit more outre, though.\n\nAlso, there’s Erasure. If I had to recommend just one, go with The Innocents (the one with “Chains of Love” and “A Little Respect”).\n\nGary Numan - The Pleasure Principle\n\nUltravox - Vienna\n\nA bit left field but Jon and Vangelis - the first album whose name I can't remember.\n\nAnd as others have said Soft Cell are worth a listen.\n\nReal Life - Heartland\n\nJapan - Tin Drum\n\nPseudo Echo - Autumnal Park\n\nGary Numan - Premier Hits\n\nThese are my favourite Synth Pop. For me Synth Pop needs a good drummer and good melody and these above have in spades\n\nDevo were basically a synth pop band by the time they recorded New Traditionalists and Oh! No! It’s Devo! (both great, but you can skip Shout unless you are a hardcore fan - it’s terrible).\n\nVienna by Ultravox gets a lot of love here, although I prefer the John Foxx era personally. Systems of Romance, their third album, might be considered one of the first synth-pop albums, from 1978, although it does have guitar and drums. It's my favorite...\n\nNuman, yes! I've always liked (still do!) Replicas as well:\n\nYazoo Upstairs At Erics\n\nDepeche Mode A Broken Frame\n\nSpandau Ballet - Journeys To Glory\n\nSoft Cell The Art of Falling Apart\n\nOMD. A & Morality\n\nThe Human League - Dare. The ultimate 80s synth pop album\n\nFlock Of Seagulls first 2 albums\n\nThomas Dolby - The Golden Age Of Wireless\n\nAlphaville - Forever Young\n\nUltravox - Quartet\n\nAltered Images - Pinky Blue\n\nHoward Jones. - Humans Lib\n\nNik Kershaw - Human Racing\n\nGreat recommendations, all. Thanks a lot. Some names that I was aware of but a lot that I wasn't. I look forward to checking all of this out!\n\nNew Order - Power Corruption and Lies is one of the best albums of the 80s. Their synth and sequencers dance pop style pretty much starts with this album. There were also some tracks released on 12\" singles at the same time, I think they've all been collected together for some definitive release..."
