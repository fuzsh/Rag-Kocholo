        "text": "This is what I’m thinking:\n\nIt is 11 o’clock. Do you know where live news is?\n\nIt isn’t often on the late news at WKBW-TV (Channel 7), the local ABC affiliate.\n\nNews director Aaron Mason confirmed something viewers may have noticed. The station continues to pre-record some of its newscasts. A telltale sign is whether an announcer says the newscast is live or not at the top of the newscast.\n\n“We utilize our Scrippscast technology at noon, 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. for news content and always have the option of going live as necessary,” Mason said. “Weather is live, as is breaking news … This approach allows us greater flexibility to get more anchors and reporters in the community every day, finding and telling meaningful stories from voices across Western New York.”\n\nHe added the 11 p.m. newscast is prerecorded on most nights outside of live weather segments and breaking news. Two recent examples of breaking news at 11 p.m. were the nights of the NFL draft and the special congressional election won by Tim Kennedy.\n\nThis is the time of year that Channel 7 announces which graduates of Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications will be joining the ABC affiliate and who is leaving from a previous class of the Journalism Career Program at E.W. Scripps Co.\n\nNewcomers won’t be arriving this summer.\n\nMason said the station is “putting on a pause on the program for the upcoming year while we explore its future.”\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAdam Campos, who has been working at Channel 7 as part of the program since last July, is joining KGTV, the Scripps station in San Diego, as a reporter. Producer Kennedy Houston is joining the Scripps station in Las Vegas, KGTV, in the same role.\n\nChelsea Swift is the newest member of the reporting staff at WGRZ-TV (Channel 2). The multiskilled journalist – as reporters are called these days – arrives from WJET in Erie, Pa., where she has been a reporter and a morning anchor since 2020. She is a native of New York City.\n\nAs previously speculated here, former Spectrum News sports reporter Rachel Hopmayer has joined the CBS affiliate in Detroit, WWJ-TV, as a sports anchor and reporter. She confirmed the move on X, formerly known as Twitter. She isn’t on the station’s website yet. However, the website doesn’t mention anyone in the sports department.\n\nInquiring minds want to know: Why wasn’t WBBZ-TV on Spectrum cable for a few days last week?\n\nAccording to John DiSciullo, who is in charge of promotion and production at the MeTV affiliate, some equipment at the transmitter needed to be repaired. He said the station was available over-the-air and on FiOS, Dish and DirecTV.\n\n“Spectrum monitored our signal and placed us back on cable later in the week,” he added.\n\nEquipment issues have become such a recurring problem at WBBZ that you can’t fault Spectrum if they took a wait-and-see approach before putting the station back on its system to avoid subscriber complaints if it happens again.\n\n“Hit Man,” my favorite movie at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival is arriving on Netflix on June 7. It’s a comedy from director Richard Linklater, best known for “Slacker” and “Dazed and Confused.” It stars Glen Powell, one of the stars of the surprise hit “Anyone But You.” I didn’t know much about “Hit Man” before seeing it last September at TIFF and that’s one reason why I enjoyed it so much. I won’t spoil it by giving you any details about a twist that would ruin the fun.\n\nLet’s just say I enjoyed “Hit Man” much more than “Anyone But You,” which is currently playing on Netflix. After watching the silly romantic comedy recently, I’m dumbstruck about how it made $219 million at the box office.\n\nViewers eagerly anticipating Thursday’s series finale of “Young Sheldon” may enjoy rewatching the pilot of the CBS series at 8 tonight on Channel 4.\n\nYou have to hand it to the NFL for the way it promotes the regular season schedule by dribbling it out for days. This morning, NBC’s play-by-play announcer Mike Tirico announced on the morning program “Today” that the season opener on Thursday, Sept. 5 will be between the defending champion Kansas City and the Baltimore Ravens in a rematch of last year’s AFC title game. NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” opener on Sept. 8 and the rest of the schedule will be announced Wednesday, though there likely will be some leaks before then.\n\nStay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nAlan Pergament\n\nTV Critic\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
