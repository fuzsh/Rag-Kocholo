        "text": "Seeing Diana Ross, Jack White and Eminem live in concert is something that anyone who enjoys live music would proudly love to cross off their bucket list. Now imagine seeing them all on the same stage, on the same night and in their hometown of Detroit. It’s almost too good to be true.\n\nThe city of Detroit is having a pretty good week so far, but you could now argue that Eminem is having just as good of a week, if not better!\n\nThe Lions are just one win away from playing in the Super Bowl, and it seemed like all of Hollywood was at Ford Field Sunday night cheering on the Lions to another playoff victory.\n\nEminem has played concerts on nearly every major stage you could think of. From the Academy Awards to The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stage, he’s been everywhere. But now, he can add a concert inside of the popular video game Fortnite to his list.\n\nSome may think that Eminem’s debut album was 1999′s “The Slim Shady,” but before the Detroit rapper was selling millions of albums worldwide, he was selling copies of his actual first album, 1996′s “Infinite,” out of the back of his car on the streets of Detroit.\n\nAfter five weeks of episodic footage about the Detroit Lions, HBO’s Hard Knocks made its final cuts, and as the old saying goes, all good things must come to an end, well, except for players like Chase Lucas.\n\nAfter five weeks of episodic footage about the Detroit Lions, HBO’s Hard Knocks made its final cuts, and as the old saying goes, all good things must come to an end, well, except for players like Chase Lucas.\n\nBest Super Bowl halftime show ever? We’ll leave that to Prince. But best Super Bowl halftime show in a while, right? It seems like most of the people on the internet would agree with that.\n\nWe are getting closer to the biggest game of the year with the Los Angeles Rams, and the Cincinnati Bengals set to face off at Super Bowl LVI Sunday (Feb. 13) night right here on Local 4.For some, the halftime show is the bigger draw than the actual game. This year’s halftime performers include future Rock and Roll Hall Of Famer Eminem with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar and Deaf Detroit rapper Sean Forbes.\n\nA man who broke into Eminem’s suburban Detroit home and allegedly told the rapper “he was there to kill him” has been sentenced to five years probation and time served.\n\nLil Nas X won video of the year at Sundays MTV VMAs on a night that Justin Bieber triumphantly returned to the stage as a performer and as winner of the artist of the year.\n\nDetroit musician Jake Bass has produced music for Eminem, and worked with talent like Ludacris and LL Cool J. Now he’s got his own new album out called The Jakey B. LP, which he showed off on Music Monday.\n\nFour women won the top four prizes Sunday, including Swift, who became the first female performer to win album of the year three times. Beyoncé — with her 28th win — became the most decorated woman in Grammy history. And 9-year-old Blue Ivy Carter — who won best music video alongside her mother — became the second youngest act to win a Grammy in the show’s 63-year history. Megan Thee Stallion, who won three honors, also made history and became the first female rapper to win best rap song. She's also the fifth rap-based act to win best new artist.\n\nFILE - Dr. Dre attends a hand and footprint ceremony honoring Quincy Jones on Nov. 27, 2018, in Los Angeles. In a social media post late Tuesday, Jan. 5, 2021, Dr. Dre said he will be back home soon after the music mogul received medical treatment at a Los Angeles hospital for a reported brain aneurysm.

He went to elite U.S. universities, clerked for an appellate court judge and worked for both a D.C. law firm with high-profile clients and as a public defender attorney for low-income clients. As a judge, he’s ruled that lawmakers should get the president’s financial records and has sprinkled his music appreciation into opinions. The Supreme Court sent that case back to a lower court and it is ongoing. He earned his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in 1993 and graduated from the University of Virginia’s law school in 1997.\n\nCLINTON TOWNSHIP, Mich. – It was much more than a home invasion.
