        "text": "WIVB reports the Buffalo Diocese has announced 40 recommended closures and mergers of parishes in Western New York.\n\nThe decision comes after the diocese’s announcement on May 28 to “rightsize and reshape” their parishes by closing or merging approximately one-third of Western New York’s 160 parishes.\n\nThe diocese is facing challenges of a priest shortage, declining Mass attendance, and financial troubles from payouts to settle child sexual abuse cases.\n\nIn Southern Chautauqua County, the following closures or mergers are proposed:\n\n– Our Lady of Loretto in Falconer will merge with St. James\n\n– Our Lady of Victory in Frewsburg will close.\n\n– Our Lady of Snows in Panama will close\n\n– St. John’s Church in Jamestown will close\n\nParish families and worship sites that were recommended to be closed or merged have until July 15 to make a counter proposal.\n\nThe full list of mergers and closures is set to be finalized by September 1, with changes beginning in October."
