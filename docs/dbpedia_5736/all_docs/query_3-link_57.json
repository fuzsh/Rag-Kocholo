The Commission may suspend the application of this provision, with respect to the signals to be distributed, upon its approval of an executed agreement between the licensee and broadcasters. Such an agreement must deal with issues related to the protection of program rights arising in connection with the discretionary carriage of a second set of U.S. 4+1 signals and distant Canadian signals solely on the licensee's digital service. The Commission reminds the licensee that the requirements set out in section 30 of the Regulations regarding simultaneous substitution apply also in the case of U.S. 4+1 signals and distant Canadian signals.
