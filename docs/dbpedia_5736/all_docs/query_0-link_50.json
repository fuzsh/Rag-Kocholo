        "text": "What a housewarming party at Michigan Central Station.\n\nThe historic Detroit train depot's six-year makeover is complete, and Ford Motor Co. marked the occasion with an all-Detroit concert, produced by Eminem, that drew thousands to the Corktown landmark.\n\nSee our updates from tonight's festivities below.\n\nThe surprise everyone hoped for concluded the concert, with Eminem taking the stage. The fact that he was an executive producer of the show drew many people who hoped he would perform.\n\nThe crowd erupted when Bill Ford, asking if Detroit was having a good time, introduced the famed rapper, who was initially backed by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAfter performing his new song \"Houdini,\" Jelly Roll joined Eminem on the stage. Then legendary Detroit rapper Trick Trick joined Eminem for \"Welcome 2 Detroit.\" The show concluded with \"Not Afraid.\" At the end, Eminem shouted, \"Detroit, we love you.\"\n\nA rocking Jack White set had the crowd jumping up and down, clapping and roaring along as he wrapped up with the internationally known anthem \"Seven Nation Army.\" Flames erupted at the back of the stage as the southwest Detroit native wrapped up his set for more than 20,000 inside the venue and listening from outside.\n\nLocal DJ Sky Jetta’s performance honoring Detroit’s legacy of techno music pioneers Belleville Three brought the crowd a new life, almost instantly everyone appeared to be dancing, the beat known as ghetto tech proved contagious.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have some attendees near putting on a show themselves in the crowd, taking space to move and sing. The joy is infectious.\n\nActor, podcaster and Michigander Taylor Lautner, perhaps most known for his \"Twilight\" movie roles and for starring in a more recent music video of ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift, was among the crowd welcoming the Bob Seger tribute group to the stage.\n\nSoon after, hips were shaking and heads were bobbing to singers Melissa Ethridge and Fantasia.\n\nEven more phones shot into the air for the last of the solo Seger singers, Jelly Roll, with a hearty rendition of \"Turn the Page.\"\n\nThe three came together for \"Old Time Rock & Roll,\" which had the whole crowd singing and clapping.\n\nEarlier, the crowd showed love for the late rapper J Dilla. His mother and Common got applause as Dilla was honored, and his former group Slum Village encouraged peace signs in the name of the much-loved eastsider who died in 2006.\n\n— Darcie Moran\n\nMisty Howard, 44, of Marion, Ohio, drove 2 1/2 hours to be in Detroit for the concert.\n\nShe loves Eminem and has his name tattooed on her right arm. She heard he was producing the show and made the trip with her son hoping he performs at least one song.\n\n“I heard it was a free concert and said, 'We’re going,'” she said.\n\nOn the way up she heard all the tickets were gone but decided to come anyway. She sat in a lawn chair on the sidewalk off Rose Street at Vernor Highway.\n\n“I can hear it here,” she said pointing at the train station. “I can watch it here.”\n\nShe held her phone in her lap showing the television broadcast of the event.\n\nShe’s been to Detroit once before to visit Eminem’s restaurant, Mom’s Spaghetti.\n\n“I really like it,” she said. “I’d like to live here.”\n\n— John Wisely\n\nAlong Vernor Highway, about 150 people are standing outside the barricade listening to the music.\n\nMany arrived on bicycles, which double as a seat for the show.\n\nSome are peeking through tears in the fabric covering the fence. Others are climbing atop fences to steal a look at the stage. Cameras and phone are held up to try to capture some of scenes.\n\nPeople are sipping bring your own drinks and the smell of marijuana is wafting through the air.\n\n— John Wisely\n\nDan Austin, Michigan Central spokesman, confirmed that big screens and speakers in the park were supposed to be raised for viewing for the show, but had to stay down due to the wind.\n\nThey are ground-level instead, and a little hard to see with the speakers blocking the screens.\n\nNext door to the train station was a Newlab rooftop party with lavish appetizers and dozens of guests decked out in blazers, dresses, trendy fits and styled hair. Dozens stood, socialized and watched the speakers and performers on big screens on top of the former Book Depository building.\n\nAs soon as Diana Ross took the stage, attendees began moving their hands and feet, dancing and weaving in their seats while singing her famous hit “I’m Coming Out.”\n\nOf those dancing and soaking up the golden hour sun were Tiana Harris, Ashley Palmer and Maryah Weaver taking selfies and group photos.\n\nHarris works with Black Leaders Detroit, which provides financial support to Black entrepreneurs, and took advantage of working out of Newlab to be “in the know” of Detroit’s happening.\n\n“I'm super excited to see it open and be able to do a watch party here from the place I work at and show my friends and family what I do here,” Harris said.\n\nWeaver, who does lashes and makeup and sells lingerie for work, said despite the high winds blowing her hair, she was thrilled to experience the historic moment.\n\n“It’s nice up here, good atmosphere, good vibes,” Weaver said.\n\n—Dana Afana\n\nAll the waiting was worth it, judging from the crowd's reaction to local legend Diana Ross, who kicked off the music with her hit \"I'm Coming Out.\"\n\nThe crowd packed in tight for Ross. It was nearly claustrophobic among the singing, smiling crowd.\n\nMuch of the crowd sang along, and others danced their way to their next spot.\n\n\"It feels good to be home,\" Ross said before closing out her set.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, Jared Goff and Barry Sanders earned cheers next. Jalen Rose and Mike Epps then took the stage to introduce Big Sean, getting crowd love for his Cass Tech roots.\n\nBig Sean took the stage and reminded the crowd: \"To the greatest city in the world, Detroit make some noise!\"\n\nThe crowd obliged.\n\nThe much-anticipated show began with the Martin Luther King Jr. marching band before the politicians got their turns — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Mayor Mike Duggan spoke before Ford Motor Co. Executive Chair Bill Ford told the crowd about his hopes for the remodeled station.\n\nThe kickoff included an ode to the station's place in Corktown (and Ford roots in Ireland), and the neighboring southwest Detroit neighborhood with fiddlers and a Mariachi band performing to cheers and even dancing in the crowd.\n\nWhitmer told the crowd Michigan Central is a testament to the state’s grit.\n\nBut there’s a special group of people at the center of it.\n\n\"The best thing about Detroit is Detroiters,\" she said.\n\n\"Big Gretch out,\" she closed to cheers, using her Detroit-given moniker.\n\nFord was introduced by Duggan, and he quickly took the moment as a chance to thank the skilled workers who put the labor in the change the building.\n\nThe building had been a symbol of a broken city, he said.\n\nNow, it speaks to the future.\n\n— Darcie Moran\n\nThe concert entrance on the west side of the venue was closed about 7:15 p.m. after high winds toppled two tents that were covering the metal detectors at the security checkpoint.\n\nThe tents were deemed unsafe.\n\nVisitors were rerouted to the east entrance.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who helped rescue the auto industry during the Great Recession, sent greetings on Thursday night.\n\nAs concertgoers took their seats, a message from Obama played on a screen that said: “Detroit has long represented the bedrock this country was built on — hard work, responsibility, sacrifice and the desire to look out for one another. This project has done more than just put those values in action — it has cemented them for the world to see.”\n\n— Brian McCollum\n\nNine-year-old Zain Salami of Grosse Île is really hoping Eminem will perform, he said sitting on the park grass with his dad munching pizza next to him.\n\nBut, he knows the history of the moment too, quickly spouting off that the station has been closed for decades.\n\n\"This is history,\" his dad, Ali Salami, 41, said, and it makes it special to see it together.\n\n— Darcie Moran\n\nCaitlin Hurley, 36, of Detroit got emotional among the sea of people waiting to enter the grounds of Michigan Central Station.\n\n“Where we’ve come from, where we’re going. Just being a part of it all,” she said.\n\nAround her neck, a necklace with a speckled granite stone — a stone from the old bathroom countertops of Michigan Central Station.\n\nHurley, a jeweler at Elaine B Jewelry in Ferndale, crafted the necklace herself. It’s among the shop’s line of three different pieces using stones from the train station’s past.\n\n“I’m shaking right now,” she said.\n\nBeing there, she said, gives her the feeling of being part of something bigger than herself. Bigger than everyone else there to also witness history.\n\n— Andrea Sahouri\n\nSteve Gruszka, 62, of Warren, grew up in Hamtramck and remembers going downtown in the 1980s to the ethnic festivals at Hart Plaza.\n\n“Then about the late '80s, things slowed down and we didn’t go as much,” he said. “But now it’s fun and nice again and there are good things to do.”\n\nGruszka is a retired electrician. He’s never been inside the train station. He said over his career, he knew colleagues who had the chance to work inside the building, though he never did.\n\nGruszka doesn’t have tickets but figures he doesn’t need them.\n\nHe brought his own beer, Miller Lite, and set it in the cup holder of a lawn chair he set up on the sidewalk along Rose Street between Vernor Highway and 17th Street.\n\nHis view of the stage is blocked by fencing around the parameter of the venue, but he has a great view of the terminal and he’s only about 150 yards from the stage.\n\n“I figure the sound will be pretty good here,” he said.\n\nA bit later, Ashia Shields, 36, of Detroit, cradled her 6-month-old son, ZionAliyon in her arms as she waited for the show to start.\n\nLike many others, she doesn’t have tickets to go inside but wanted to hear the music.\n\nShe was sitting outside a dog park near Rose Street and 17th. “We wanted to at least hear the concert,” she said. “It’s just so exciting to see them reopening Michigan Central. I’m glad to see it come to life. Detroit is popping.”\n\nMinutes after the gates opened to the concert area, fans were already lining up near the stage for their chance to see the show, quickly placing blankets and chairs on the grass as strong winds blew.\n\nAhead of time, a closed-off section marked with reserved seating signs offered promise of Detroit treats as event staffers placed Detroit Popcorn Co. bags under seats along with other goodies.\n\n— Darcie Moran\n\nEllen Deleston of Detroit works for Ford in manufacturing engineering. On Wednesday, she logged on to her work computer to a good surprise.\n\n“I opened an email and it said, ‘You won’” tickets, she said. “It was a raffle. I’m glad I didn’t pass over that email.”\n\nDelleston, who was eager to see Diana Ross and Big Sean, pushed her husband in a wheelchair from Mexican Village restaurant to the western entrance of the concert on Michigan Avenue at Vernor Highway.\n\n“It looks closer than it is,” she said.\n\nHer husband, Devery, who has a prosthetic leg, was eager to visit the train station for the first time.\n\n“I can’t believe they could make that old building shine again,” he said. “I can’t even believe that it was structurally sound. They had to pump out a million gallons of water.”\n\nJim Peters of Ann Arbor also is a Ford employee who got his tickets via the company raffle. He and his wife, Amy, drove 40 minutes to southwest Detroit to have dinner before the concert.\n\n“I really want to see the renovation,” he said. “I remember it from the old videos which showed Detroit in not the best light.”\n\nAmy is eager for the concert, especially the chance to see Diana Ross.\n\n“A little classic Motown in a classic building,” she said. “Not a bad way to spend an evening.”\n\n— John Wisely\n\nLifelong Detroiters Darlene Calloway, 67, and her daughter Algeria Calloway, 40, came to Michigan Central Station’s grand opening to witness the legacy of Detroit.\n\n\"I am just glad to be a part of this, to see our city come back to its wholeness,\" Darlene Calloway said.\n\n\"It means so much to our children. We’re talking about leaving a legacy for them — not of a downtrodden city.\"\n\n\"Look what we’ve got,\" Darlene Calloway continued. \"It’s beautiful.\"\n\nThe Calloway women also came to see legendary Motown artist Diana Ross, who they repeatedly described as \"the queen\" and \"the boss.\"\n\nJust two days ago, Darlene Calloway found a copy of the movie \"Lady Sings the Blues\" starring Ross and bought it on the spot.\n\n\"She's special to us. She is,\" she said.\n\nHer daughter agreed.\n\n\"It's beautiful to be a Detroiter,\" Algeria Calloway said.\n\n— Andrea Sahouri\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan, on site more than three hours before the outdoor concert, greeted visitors as well as membera of the Michigan Central Station team.\n\n“We are in one of the most beautiful parks anywhere in America. Roosevelt Park, the front of the train station, has now eclipsed the Scott Fountain of Belle Isle as the most photographed site in the City of Detroit. And tonight it’s going to be the most watched site,” he told the Free Press.\n\nDuggan said Detroit police were prepared for a safe night downtown on Thursday at the outdoor concert for 20,000 ticketholders, not including people outside the venue.\n\n“Detroit’s got the best police chief in America. He’s now the spokesperson at all the national conferences. The Detroit police will be out here in large numbers,” Duggan told Free Press. “I feel very confident in what we’re doing and I’m confident in the men and women of the Detroit Police Department. We prepare every day. You never know when you get an incident anywhere in America. We’ll be well-prepared. I’m optimistic we’re going to have a very good night. Life is good.”\n\nDuggan added that the significance of the moment can’t be overstated.\n\n“I grew up here. I know what the train station meant. Visitors would come to see us and you’d pick them up at the train station and their first image of Detroit would be spectacular,” he said. “To watch it be abandoned and lose the windows and be covered with graffiti was heartbreaking for everybody like me who looked at it and saw it the way it was. But from my first month in office, I was totally focused on this station being restored and reused. I never could’ve believed it could’ve been restored as spectacularly as Bill Ford and the Ford Motor Company have done.\"\n\nDuggan added, “You have to be a longtime Detroiter to understand this, the pain of what was taken away from us, the auto plants moving out, the movie theaters moving out, the restaurants moving out, our neighbors moving out … All of that is turning around. To see this come back, for a lot of people, it’s a night of deep pride.”\n\nAt that, the mayor said he was headed out to pick up his wife for the show.\n\n— Darcie Moran\n\nFor Candice Jackson, 35, the concert is a home game.\n\nShe lives just west of the train station off Interstate 75.\n\n“It’s about a 5-minute walk,” Jackson said.\n\nShe has tickets to the show and brought her son, Carlos, 8, with her.\n\n“I like Fantasia and Diana Ross,” she said. “I like Big Sean, too.”\n\nJackson said she doesn’t get to see a lot of concerts, so she was eager for this one close to home. She arrived about 5 p.m. “They said doors open around 6 and I wanted to get here early.”\n\nAn event staffer started briefing people waiting in line, saying seating is very limited inside and many people will have to stand. Visitors can’t bring in food and drink. Metal detectors are in place about 20 yards beyond the first layer of barricades.\n\n— John Wisely\n\nOnce Tanner Langdon, 16, of Madison Heights heard the music lineup for Michigan Central’s grand opening, there was no way he was missing out on the action.\n\n\"I had to go,\" he said.\n\nOn the day of the concert, Langdon heard that extra tickets were set to drop at 10 a.m., the same time as his 10th-grade honors history exam at Lamphere High School.\n\nThankfully, his teacher held off for 10 minutes.\n\n\"He was totally down for it,\" Langdon said. \"I got 'em.\"\n\nJack White is the big draw, he said. But if Stevie Wonder shows up, “I might actually pass out.\"\n\n— Andrea Sahouri\n\nMichigan Central Station is blocked off with black sheeting at street level, preventing unticketed eventgoers from watching the show.\n\nThe campus was empty Thursday afternoon as guests slowly made their way to Michigan Avenue and 14th Street just before 5 p.m., while some popped into Mercury Bar, Grandma Bobs and other nearby restaurants fueling up ahead of the big event.\n\nA local Detroit artist who goes by the name Benzo Bee, 28, was lucky to get his hands on tickets the night before the event. In a group chat, one of his friends asked if anyone wanted a ticket. Bee couldn’t miss the rare opportunity.\n\n“I love everything about Detroit and I love when they don't tear down buildings that we reuse and repurpose them,” Bee said.\n\n“it means a lot to me now especially because I am a photographer now, so it's really cool just to just be part of these historic things because I think my favorite thing about photography … is you take a piece of time and you get to capture it for a little bit and you get to hold it for future generations. So there's gonna be 1000s of cameras in there just shooting and just seeing all this stuff.”\n\nBee is also stoked to see Diana Ross perform.\n\n“It says everything about Detroit, its elegance, its chicness, its grit and ... like the responsibility that we have for this city and just doing everything possible to keep it alive and keep it great,” Bee said. “This event is going to definitely be historic, and I can't wait to enjoy it.”\n\n— Dana Afana\n\nPeople are standing around waiting to be let in.\n\nIt’s hot on the pavement, about 80 degrees. But the passing clouds and stiff breeze make it feel cooler.\n\nJoan Smolarek, 66, grew up in Hamtramck and now lives in Naples, Florida. She is in town visiting family.\n\n“I heard it was happening and wanted to see it,” she said. “We had dinner at Mexican Village (restaurant) and walked over from there.”\n\nSmolarek said she doesn’t have a ticket to the show but hopes to enjoy the music from outside.\n\n“I’ve never been inside” the train station, she said.\n\nShe’s planning another family visit in September and hopes to take a tour then.\n\n— John Wisely\n\nMichigan Avenue was mostly quiet leading up to 4:30 p.m.\n\nGroups of security personnel in royal blue golf shirts and event staffers wearing black Carhartt T-shirts milled about.\n\nMercury Burgers and Bar at Michigan Avenue and 14th Street was full. So was the bench outside. The bar even set up an outdoor serving station.\n\nBeer and wine are $5 apiece. Watermelon vodka is going for $12.\n\nThey’re also selling hot dogs, lemonade and Faygo pop.\n\nOn a bench outside, Tracey Wyatt, 58, of Detroit, was sitting with her 85-year-old mother, Shirley Wyatt.\n\nTheir family moved here from Nashville after her father took a job working for Chrysler. He arrived first and they came later.\n\n“I was brought here on a train by my parents in 1966,” Tracey Wyatt said.\n\nShe was not quite 2 then, and she doesn’t remember the train ride, but her mother does.\n\n“I remember there were a lot of people there,” she said. “My husband was waiting for us. I haven’t been here since then. To see it reopen is historic.”\n\n— John Wisely\n\nWho: Diana Ross, Jack White, Big Sean, The Clark Sisters, Kierra Sheard, Slum Village, Detroit Symphony Orchestra and more. Here's the full list of artists.\n\nWhen: 8:30 tonight. The concert will last 90 minutes.\n\nWhere: Michigan Central Station, Corktown, Detroit.\n\nTV: WDIV Channel 4 in Detroit.\n\nStreaming: Peacock.\n\n—Detroit Free Press Staff\n\nPlanning for Michigan Central Station’s concert spectacular kicked into high gear six months ago. But you could say it was really decades in the making.\n\nAssembling a host of top Detroit talent from across genres, the Thursday show will thread together the diverse strands from the city’s musical legacy — summoning a rich history for a night that ultimately is about looking forward. Here's more.\n\n—Brian McCollum"
