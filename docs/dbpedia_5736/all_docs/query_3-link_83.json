        "text": "HOMESPUN is now available on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) so if you’re looking for something to watch on this long weekend be sure to head to https://lnkd.in/g3AFy2zT to check it out! As someone who grew up on a diet of ABC TV it’s such an exciting milestone to see our show alongside such incredible titles...what a joy! In HOMESPUN I wanted to create something that went against the grain - no boy meets girl bush romance, none of the overdone tropes and caricatures we see time and time again. I wanted it to be fast paced, dynamic, different – a show that respected the audience by encouraging them to join the dots in a format that is atypical, non-sequential, unconventional. Given structure is often so set in stone we knew this would be confronting, and we were deliberate in wanting to give audiences agency. Our intent was to relinquish the desire to control the audience’s interpretation and let them make sense of the world in a way that is meaningful to them...meaningful to you. In this age of mindless scrolling, digital overload, content clutter we want you to have to do a little bit of work in your navigation of the story when you step into the world. In HOMESPUN, beautiful artistic animations are threaded through out and there are so many little gems of meaning that have been meticulously planted for people to find as they frolic through the experience. The desire to make something out of the box influenced how we made HOMESPUN – we chased creative freedom so that we could forge a refreshed way of looking at the regions. It’s not perfect. It’s a like a jar of homemade jam. It’s not a mass market, preservative laden, factory generated, off-the-shelf sugary sales winner. It’s rustic and chunky, slightly tart, and slightly sweet but it’s made from a bespoke handwritten recipe and it’s laden with love. We made it like this so you can see the possibilities – where we can go to with these kinds of stories…the people you can meet, the ideas you can explore, the music you can enjoy, the places, faces and stories that we could expand on if we were trusted to dial them up with the kind of support that could help the recipe be replicated. Just like jam, it’s not for everyone…we made if for regional Australians who routinely get the p*ss taken but who never get to take the p*ss themselves. We hope you enjoy our labour of love!"
