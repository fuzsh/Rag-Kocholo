This honor propels KSAT-TV into the national competition, with winners to be announced in August.\n\n\"Our Uvalde coverage, titled 'One Year In: Uvalde,' was driven by a commitment to honor the 19 students and 2 teachers whose lives were taken too soon,” stated Ashlee Parker, Vice President, and General Manager at KSAT-TV. “Our work is dedicated to their memory, and we remain steadfast in our mission to support and uplift the victims, their families, and the entire Uvalde community.”\n\nWDIV-TV in Detroit, Michigan, was honored in the News Documentary category for its coverage titled “Does Line 5 Threaten Great Lakes?” This documentary explores the potential risks posed by Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 pipeline, which runs under the Straits of Mackinac.

The company that owns Line 5 had a previous pipeline spill in 2010, involving over a million gallons of oil, stands as one of the largest inland oil spills in U.S. history. Drew uncovered that many viewers were unaware of the pipeline's existence, emphasizing the broader impact on the community.\n\n\"The way the currents shift, you could have an oil problem in many ways,\" says WDIV's VP and general manager Bob Ellis. \"You're talking about the most precious resource we have in the state of Michigan, which is water.\"\n\nRecognizing the gravity of the situation, WDIV took an unprecedented step by dedicating a 15-minute investigative package to Line 5 during its 5:30 evening newscast, airing without commercials as reported by TV NewsCheck. Karen Drew employed innovative storytelling techniques, incorporating 3D animation and dynamic visuals to maintain viewer engagement throughout the extended report. The station also utilized its digital streaming platform, Local 4+, to broadcast a half-hour special, reaching audiences on multiple platforms.\n\nTo further engage the community, WDIV has scheduled a town hall meeting for later this month. The meeting will feature the oil pipeline company, environmental groups, elected officials, and community experts, with the Line 5 investigation taking center stage to kick off the program.\n\nThe Line 5 investigation by WDIV underscores the importance of investigative reporting in bringing critical issues to the forefront and mobilizing communities for positive change.\n\nKSAT-TV, Graham Media Group’s ABC affiliate in San Antonio, Texas, won a Lone Star Emmy Award for their coverage of the Uvalde elementary school massacre and its year-long aftermath.\n\nReporter Leigh Waldman, Photojournalist Gavin Nesbitt, Editor Valerie Gomez, and Digital Journalist Andrew Wilson accepted the award on November 11 on behalf of a larger team from the KSAT newsroom that created the special, \"One Year In: Uvalde.\"\n\n\"This was a labor of love for a community who went through the unimaginable. Everyone in this team wanted to make sure people heard the stories and remembered the names of the 21 lost in Uvalde,\" stated editor Valerie Gomez while accepting the award on behalf of the team.\n\n\"One Year In: Uvalde\" was a look back at the year following the tragedy at Robb Elementary in 2022.

It should excite all of us who work in local broadcast. The local television station with a great local website and now a great local streaming channel has an enormous role to play in the future. It has the opportunity to become more relevant than ever if we use each platform effectively to inform and educate in our communities.”\n\nThe RBR+TVBR introduced its inaugural Top Local TV Leaders list in 2019.
