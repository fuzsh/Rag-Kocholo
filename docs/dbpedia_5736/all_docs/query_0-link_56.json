        "text": "August 12, 2024\n\nGreetings:\n\nIt may not be the busiest week of ND changes, but we have a few and some very interesting items in Names in the News.\n\nNO jobs were filled this week, while ONE new position opened up. And we can now tell you the new job for a Green Bay ND whose departure we reported last week. Our list of open ND jobs increases to 39.\n\nWe have TWO ads for very similar…but different…jobs in Houston. Both Steven Arnold Music and Octopus have ads this week. To explore more about Octopus Newsroom and their cutting-edge NRCS showcased at TAB 2024, visit their ad below for in-depth information and updates.\n\nAnd Sciline has a number of briefings and interview opportunities, all FREE.\n\nNO obituaries this week and NO GM changes (that I know of).\n\nBut leave it to CBS News and Stations to provide fodder for Names in the News with a whole raft of promotions. Also in Names in the News, a legendary industry publication is going away, CNN loses its media writer, who’s starting a newsletter (imagine that) and a veteran New Orleans newsman is leaving after 42 years but his farewell note is worth a read.\n\nAll that and more below.\n\nNewly Named News Directors:\n\nNO hires this week, to the best of my knowledge.\n\nNew News Director Opening:\n\nWGBA-TV, Green Bay, WI…we first reported last week that RYAN SCOTT is leaving this Scripps owned NBC station but we now know he’s staying within Scripps and returning to WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee as Managing Editor. Here’s the note from ND TIM VETSCHER. Ryan joined WGBA as ND in late 2021 and added Station Manager duties last December. But he’d earlier spent 20 years at WTMJ in a variety of roles, beginning as a director.\n\nRyan becomes the FOURTH former (or current ND) housed at WTMJ. In addition to current ND Tim Vetscher, former WTMJ ND JEFF KIERNAN’s office is at WTMJ in his new role as VP/News for Scripps, and former WITI-TV (Milwaukee/FOX) ND JIM WILSON is the executive reporter at WTMJ.\n\nKTVZ/KFXO-TV, Bend, OR….CATHY MARSHALL will leave this News Press and Gazette owned NBC/FOX duopoly once her replacement has been hired. She’s been ND here since December, 2022 and first joined the station as a morning anchor in early 2022. Cathy’s worked for CNN, and for stations in Boston, Seattle, New Haven and for KGW-TV in Portland, OR, for eleven years before joining KTVZ.\n\nAugust SciLine events\n\nZoom – All events are free\n\nEXPERT INTERVIEWS (15-minute, 1-on1 Zoom interviews):\n\nAugust 13th (2-4 p.m. EDT): Electric school buses with Dr. Sara Adar (U. Of Michigan)\n\nAugust 15th (1-3 p.m. EDT): School cell phone policies with Dr. Jacqueline Nesi (Brown University)\n\nNEW CRASH COURSE! Social science essentials for local reporters\n\nMonday, August 19th (2-3 p.m. EDT)\n\nThis free one-hour “crash course”—designed for local and general assignment reporters—teaches basic principles about how social science works and ways it can be used to strengthen virtually any news story with a human element, especially this election season.\n\nREGISTER\n\nMEDIA BREIFING: Resisting misinformation in your election reporting\n\nWednesday, August 28th (1-2 p.m. EDT)\n\nJournalistic accuracy during election season is especially difficult in the face of sophisticated efforts to sow voter confusion and new technologies that can generate synthetic “truths”. This briefing will offer research-backed strategies and tools to help reporters recognize and verify material of questionable validity and correct misinformation without inadvertently amplifying it.\n\nPanelists:\n\nDr. Cuihua (Cindy) Chen, UC Davis\n\nDr. Kate Starbird, University of Washington\n\nDr. Briony Swire-Thompson, Northeastern University\n\nREGISTER\n\nMORE 2024 ELECTION RESOURCES\n\nTo strengthen journalists’ election season reporting with research-backed evidence and context, SciLine offers 2024 election resources with full videos and transcripts of recent briefings and tip sheets.
