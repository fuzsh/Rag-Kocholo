Following publication of that application, the Commission received three applications for broadcasting licences to operate a new commercial FM ethnic radio station in Scarborough on the same frequency. On 22 July 2013, a fifth application was filed by Intercity Broadcasting Network Inc. (Intercity), licensee of the commercial radio station CKFG-FM, seeking to add a transmitter on the same frequency in Scarborough. These applications are therefore technically mutually exclusive for the use of the frequency 102.7 MHz in Scarborough.\n\nA subsequent application was received on 19 November 2013 from WhiStle Community Radio (WhiStle), licensee of the community radio station CIWS-FM Whitchurch-Stouffville, Ontario, seeking to increase the stationâs average effective radiated power (ERP) from 50 to 175 watts on its 102.7 MHz frequency. Based on the technical parameters proposed, and given the proximity of Whitchurch-Stouffville to Scarborough, this application is also technically mutually exclusive with the Scarborough applications for the use of the frequency 102.7 MHz.\n\nFinally, an application was received on 30 August 2013 from Vista Radio Ltd. (Vista), licensee of the commercial radio station CJFB-FM Bolton, Ontario, seeking to change its frequency to 102.7 MHz and to increase the stationâs average ERP from 50 to 1,700 watts. While not technically mutually exclusive with the Scarborough applications, CJFB-FM, under its proposed technical parameters, would receive signal interference from the Scarborough proposals. While Vista has agreed to the signal interference under a scenario whereby either the 105.9 FM Ltd. or the Intercity proposals are approved, it has not yet had the opportunity to review the three applications for new Scarborough commercial FM stations and the technical change application by WhiStle, or to assess any signal interference with these proposals. Vistaâs presence at the public hearing will allow it to address the degree of interference from all of the proposals seeking the use of the 102.7 MHz frequency.\n\nPreamble for items 8 to 20\n\nThe Commission intends to consider, subject to interventions, items 8 to 20 during the non-appearing phase of the hearing.\n\n1. 105.9 FM Ltd.\n\nScarborough, Ontario\n\nApplication 2012-1384-2\n\nApplication by 105.9 FM Ltd. (previously Subanasiri Vaithilingam, on behalf of a corporation to be incorporated) to amend the broadcasting licence for the low-power commercial specialty ethnic radio station CJVF-FM Scarborough, Ontario, which operates at frequency 102.7 MHz (channel 274LP).\n\nThe licensee proposes to change the authorized contours of its transmitter by increasing the average effective radiated power (ERP) from 6.5 to 476 watts, by increasing the maximum ERP from 6.5 to 1,200 watts, by changing the antennaâs radiation pattern from non-directional to directional, and by increasing the effective height of antenna above average terrain from 63.4 to 77 metres.\n\nThe Commission notes that in CJVF-FM Scarborough – Licence amendment and technical change, Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2014-29, 30 January 2014, it approved an application to change the frequency from 105.9 MHz (channel 290LP) to 102.7 MHz (channel 274LP). The change in frequency was necessary because the frequency 105.9 MHz used by the licensee was assigned to Bhupinder Bola, on behalf of a corporation to be incorporated, to operate a new FM radio station in Markham, as set out in Licensing of new radio station to serve Markham, Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-487, 11 September 2012. The continued use of the frequency 102.7 MHz (channel 274LP) at 6.5 watts allows CJFV-FM to remain on-air until the application by 105.9 FM Ltd. is considered by the Commission.\n\nThe Commission notes that the power increase would result in a change of CJVF-FMâs status from a low-power unprotected service to a protected Class A FM service.\n\nIt appears that the licensee may have failed to comply with section 9(2) of the Radio Regulations, 1986 (the Regulations) relating to the filing of duly completed annual returns, for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 broadcast years.\n\nFurther, it appears that the licensee may have failed to comply with condition of licence 7 set out in Ethnic FM radio station in Scarborough, Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-756, 7 December 2011, which requires minimum yearly contributions to Canadian content development (CCD) that are over-and-above those required by the Regulations. For the 2011-2012 broadcast year, there is an apparent shortfall of $833 in over-and-above CCD contributions.\n\nThe Commission may withdraw this application from the public hearing if it is not advised by the Department of Industry, at least twenty days prior to the hearing, that the application is technically acceptable.\n\nThe present application was initially published as part of a public process under Part 1 of the CRTC Rules of Practice and Procedure. The interventions received as part of the Part 1 process will be added to the public record for the present hearing.\n\nLicenseeâs address:\n\n72 Dynamic Drive\n\nScarborough, Ontario\n\nM1V 3Z5\n\nEmail: frogers@bell.net\n\nWebsite to view application: www.1059.fm\n\n2. MBC – Multicultural Broadcasting Company Ltd.\n\nScarborough, Ontario\n\nApplication 2012-1548-4\n\nApplication by MBC –Multicultural Broadcasting Company Ltd. for a broadcasting licence to operate a commercial specialty FM ethnic radio station in Scarborough.\n\nThe station would operate on frequency 102.7 MHz (channel 274A) with an average effective radiated power (ERP) of 620 watts (maximum ERP of 1,300 watts with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 76.5 metres).\n\nThe applicant states that it would accept a condition of licence requiring it to direct ethnic programming to a minimum of 7 distinct cultural groups in a minimum of 7 different languages per broadcast week.\n\nThe applicant further states that of the total programming to be broadcast during the broadcast week, 100% would be devoted to ethnic programming and 85% would be devoted to third-language programming.\n\nThe Commission may withdraw this application from the public hearing if it is not advised by the Department of Industry, at least twenty days prior to the hearing, that the application is technically acceptable.\n\nApplicantâs address:\n\n86 Laird Drive\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nM4G 3V1\n\nEmail: IB@CTBC.com\n\nEmail to request electronic version of application: IB@CTBC.com\n\n3. 8041393 Canada Inc., on behalf of a corporation to be incorporated\n\nScarborough, Ontario\n\nApplication 2012-1549-2\n\nApplication by 8041393 Canada Inc., on behalf of a corporation to be incorporated, for a broadcasting licence to operate a commercial specialty FM ethnic radio station in Scarborough.\n\nThe station would operate on frequency 102.7 MHz (channel 274A) with an average effective radiated power (ERP) of 472 watts (maximum ERP of 1,200 watts with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 72.6 metres).\n\nThe applicant states that it would accept a condition of licence requiring it to direct ethnic programming to a minimum of 17 distinct cultural groups in a minimum of 9 different languages per broadcast week.\n\nThe applicant further states that of the total programming to be broadcast during the broadcast week, 100% would be devoted to ethnic programming and 89% would be devoted to third-language programming.\n\nThe Commission may withdraw this application from the public hearing if it is not advised by the Department of Industry, at least twenty days prior to the hearing, that the application is technically acceptable.\n\nApplicantâs address:\n\n233 Riverwalk Drive\n\nMarkham, Ontario\n\nL6B 0G9\n\nFax: 416-267-7707\n\nEmail: eastfm102.7@gmail.com\n\nEmail to request electronic version of application: eastfm102.7@gmail.com\n\n4.

Intercity Broadcasting Network Inc.\n\nScarborough, Ontario\n\nApplication 2013-1076-3\n\nApplication by Intercity Broadcasting Network Inc. to amend the broadcasting licence for the English-language specialty commercial radio station CKFG-FM Toronto, Ontario.\n\nThe licensee proposes to add an FM transmitter at Scarborough to broadcast the programming of CKFG-FM in order to adequately serve the population of Scarborough.\n\nThe transmitter would operate on frequency 102.7 MHz (channel 274A) with an average effective radiated power (ERP) of 442 watts (maximum ERP of 1,500 watts with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 54.6 metres).\n\nIt appears that the licensee may have failed to comply with the following sections of the Radio Regulations, 1986:\n\nsection 9(2) relating to the filing of annual returns before the 30 November deadline, for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 broadcast years;\n\nsection 15(2) relating to basic Canadian content development (CCD) contributions, for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 broadcast years; and\n\nsection 15(5) requiring the licensee to contribute 15% of its basic annual CCD contributions to the Community Radio Fund of Canada, for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 broadcast years.\n\nFurther, it appears that the licensee may have failed to comply with the following conditions of licence for CKFG-FM:\n\ncondition of licence 6 set out in English-language FM radio station in Toronto, Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-369, 9 June 2011 (Broadcasting Decision 2011-369), which requires minimum yearly contributions to CCD, for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 broadcast years, resulting in an apparent total shortfall of $63,877 in over-and-above CCD contributions; and\n\ncondition of licence 7 set out in Broadcasting Decision 2011-369, which requires the licensee to file an annual report by 30 November of each year providing specific details on the manner in which it has fulfilled its programming requirements in serving the Caribbean and African communities of Toronto with its spoken word programming and musical format, for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 broadcast years.\n\nIn regard to its apparent shortfall of $63,877 in over-and-above CCD contributions, the licensee has requested an amendment to its condition of licence 6 that would allow it to expend the shortfall over the remaining broadcast years as follows:\n\nYear 3 (2013-2014) - $49,105\n\nYear 4 (2014-2015) - $49,121\n\nYear 5 (2015-2016) - $49,105\n\nYear 6 (2016-2017) - $49,071\n\nYear 7 (2017-2018) - $58,142\n\nThe Commission may withdraw this application from the public hearing if it is not advised by the Department of Industry, at least twenty days prior to the hearing, that the application is technically acceptable.\n\nLicenseeâs address:\n\n34 Kern Road\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nM3B 1T1\n\nFax: 416-366-4987\n\nEmail: fg2020@gmail.com\n\nWebsite to view application: www.g987fm.com\n\nEmail to request electronic version of application: crtc@g987fm.com\n\n6. Vista Radio Ltd.\n\nBolton, Ontario\n\nApplication 2013-1218-1\n\nApplication by Vista Radio Ltd. to amend the broadcasting licence for the commercial radio station CJFB-FM Bolton. Specifically, the licensee proposes to change the frequency from 105.5 MHz (channel 288LP) to 102.7 MHz (channel 274A).\n\nThe licensee also proposes to change the authorized contours by increasing the average effective radiated power (ERP) from 50 to 1,700 watts (maximum ERP from 50 to 5,000 watts) and by decreasing the effective height of antenna above average terrain from 20 to 6.1 metres.\n\nThe licensee stated that neither CJFB-FM nor its neighbouring radio station CFGM-FM Caledon, Ontario, have achieved profitability since their licensing, due to intense competition from out-of-market stations and limited coverage in their respective service areas resulting from hilly terrain and low transmission power.\n\nThe licensee therefore wishes to consolidate the operation of the two stations by increasing the reach of CJFB-FM into Caledon, and subsequently revoking the licence of CFGM-FM.\n\nThe licensee has submitted a separate application to revoke the licence of CFGM-FM in the event of a favourable decision by the Commission for the present application.\n\nThe Commission may withdraw this application from the public hearing if it is not advised by the Department of Industry, at least twenty days prior to the hearing, that the application is technically acceptable.\n\nThe present application was initially published as part of a public process under Part 1 of the CRTC Rules of Practice and Procedure.\n\nLicenseeâs address:\n\n201-910 Fitzgerald Avenue\n\nCourtenay, British Columbia\n\nV9N 2R5\n\nFax: 250-334-9540\n\nEmail: gpoulton@vistaradio.net\n\nWebsite to view application: www.vistaradio.ca\n\nEmail to request electronic version of application: renewalappinfo@vistaradio.net\n\n7. WhiStle Community Radio\n\nWhitchurch-Stouffville, Ontario\n\nApplication 2013-1661-2\n\nApplication by WhiStle Community Radio relating to the community radio station CIWS-FM Whitchurch-Stouffville, Ontario.\n\nThe licensee proposes to change the authorized contours by increasing the average effective radiated power (ERP) from 50 to 175 watts (non-directional antenna, with a maximum ERP from 50 to 1,000 watts), by increasing the effective height of antenna above average terrain from 12 to 30 metres, and by relocating the transmitter. The station would continue to operate on the frequency 102.7 MHz.\n\nThis increase would change the status of this station from unprotected to protected.\n\nThe licensee stated that it was licensed to serve the community of Whitchurch-Stouffville. However, due to the low-power of the station, the townâs geographical limitations and a less-than-adequate transmitter location, it has not yet been possible to fully serve this area.\n\nThe licensee further stated that the proposed changes would ensure that local residents have access to a radio station that is dedicated to the area, and would attract increased local advertising and local area listeners.\n\nThe Commission may withdraw this application from the public hearing if it is not advised by the Department of Industry, at least twenty days prior to the hearing, that the application is technically acceptable.\n\nLicenseeâs address:\n\n6379 Main Street\n\nP.O.

Accordingly, the procedure set out below must be read in conjunction with the Rules of Procedure and its accompanying documents, which can be found on the Commissionâs website under “CRTC Rules of Practice and Procedure.”\n\nAn intervention or an answer from a respondent must be filed with the Commission and served on the applicant on or before the above-mentioned date. An answer from a respondent must also be served on any other respondent.\n\nIn accordance with the Rules of Procedure, a document must be filed with, not merely sent to, the Commission by 5 p.m. Vancouver time (8 p.m. Ottawa time) on the date it is due. The Commission takes no responsibility for postal delays and will not notify a party whose submission is received after the deadline date. Late submissions will not be considered by the Commission and will not be made part of the public file.\n\nFor applications to be considered during the appearing phase of the hearing, the intervention or answer must include one of the following statements in either the first or the last paragraph:\n\nI request to appear at the public hearing.\n\nI do not want to appear at the public hearing.\n\nThe applicant, respondents and interveners are permitted to coordinate, organize and file, in a single submission, interventions of other interested persons who share their position but do not wish to appear at the hearing as a “Joint Supporting Intervention.” More information on how to do so and a template for the covering letter to be filed by the parties can be found in Changes to certain practices for filing interventions – Expansion of filing practices to include the filing of joint supporting comments for broadcasting policy proceedings, Broadcasting Information Bulletin CRTC 2010-28-1, 10 December 2010.\n\nInterventions and answers will be considered by the Commission and will form part of the public record of the proceeding without further notification to parties, provided the procedures set out in the Rules of Procedure and this notice have been followed. Parties will be contacted only if their submissions raise procedural questions.\n\nSubmissions must be filed by sending them to the Secretary General of the Commission by only one of the following means:\n\nby using the\n\n[Intervention/comment/answer form]\n\nor\n\nby mail to\n\nCRTC, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0N2\n\nor\n\nby fax at\n\n819-994-0218\n\nA true copy of each intervention or answer from a respondent must be sent to the applicant and, in the case of a respondent to an application, to any other respondent.\n\nThe Commission advises those who file and serve by electronic mode to exercise caution when using email for service of documents, as it may be difficult to establish that service has occurred.\n\nParties must ensure that, before initiating service through electronic mode, they will be able to satisfy the Commission, upon request, that service was completed. The sender must keep proof of the sending and the receipt of the document for 180 days after the day on which it is filed.\n\nSubmissions longer than five pages should include a summary.\n\nEach paragraph of the submission should be numbered. In addition, where the intervention is filed by electronic means, the line ***End of document*** should be entered following the last paragraph of the document, as an indication that the document has not been altered during electronic transmission.\n\nInterventions and answers must clearly identify the application referred to and indicate whether parties support or oppose the application, or, if they propose changes to it, include the facts and grounds for their proposal.\n\nIn the event that an application to be considered during the non-appearing phase of the hearing is brought to the oral phase of the hearing, and if parties wish to appear, they must provide reasons why their written interventions or answers are not sufficient and why an appearance is necessary. Parties requiring communication support must state their request on the first page of their intervention. Only those parties whose requests to appear have been granted will be contacted by the Commission and invited to appear at the public hearing.\n\nPersons requiring communications support such as assistance listening devices and sign language interpretation are requested to inform the Commission at least twenty (20) days before the commencement of the public hearing so that the necessary arrangements can be made.\n\nImportant notice\n\nAll information that parties provide as part of this public process, except information designated confidential, whether sent by postal mail, facsimile, email or through the Commissionâs website at www.crtc.gc.ca, becomes part of a publicly accessible file and will be posted on the Commissionâs website. This information includes personal information, such as full names, email addresses, postal/street addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers, and any other personal information parties provide.\n\nThe personal information that parties provide will be used and may be disclosed for the purpose for which the information was obtained or compiled by the Commission, or for a use consistent with that purpose.\n\nDocuments received electronically or otherwise will be put on the Commissionâs website in their entirety exactly as received, including any personal information contained therein, in the official language and format in which they are received. Documents not received electronically will be available in PDF format.\n\nThe information that parties provide to the Commission as part of this public process is entered into an unsearchable database dedicated to this specific public process. This database is accessible only from the web page of this particular public process. As a result, a general search of the Commissionâs website with the help of either its own search engine or a third-party search engine will not provide access to the information that was provided as part of this public process.\n\nThe Commission encourages parties and interested persons to monitor the record of the proceeding, available on the Commissionâs website, for additional information that they may find useful when preparing their submissions.\n\nAvailability of documents\n\nElectronic versions of the applications are available on the Commissionâs website by selecting the application number within this notice.
