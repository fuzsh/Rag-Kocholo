        "text": "I was flipping satellite channels yesterday and noticed that we no longer have ABC, NBC, and CBS Buffalo. Star Choice has removed the channels without any notice. They been replaced with the Detroit stations.\n\nThe channel grid usually shows 385-NBCB, 386-ABCB,387-CBSB. Now they are listed as 385-NBCE, 386-ABCE,387-CBSE. That's what first tipped me off.\n\nApparently WNED - PBS Buffalo/Toronto and WUHF - FOX Rochester are next to go, both being replaced by their Detroit counterparts. Although, anyone who follows PBS knows, most PBS stations are different from one another. PBS Buffalo has sometimes, substantially different programing than PBS Detroit.\n\nWhen we signed up, to get the Eastern U.S. TV stations \"time shift\" package 5, 6 years ago, we had the choice of Detroit or Buffalo. It was Buffalo all the way. And for the Pacific time zone feed, we had the choice of Spokane or Seattle. We chose Seattle.\n\nFrom NBC Buffalo, wgrz.com.\n\nChannel 2 has heard from many viewers from Southern Ontario in recent days asking why they are no longer able to get their favorite Buffalo TV programs from their satellite provider.\n\nAs of April 14th, programming from stations in Buffalo was removed from the lineup of Canadian satellite TV provider, Star Choice and replaced with Detroit TV stations.\n\nUnfortunately, Channel 2 has no control over the situation and would urge anyone with questions or concerns about the matter to contact Star Choice for more information. You can CLICK HERE to contact Star Choice.\n\nOh...I did! I've sent feedback to Star Choice's \"Ask Jim\". http://www.starchoice.com/english/contactus/ask_jim.asp\n\n___________________________\n\nThis isn't the first time Star Choice has removed channels. Within the past two years they've removed SUN-TV, GLOBAL Halifax/Maritimes and CBC Regina among other stations. GLOBAL Halifax was great because it gave us a 5th time zone, Atlantic for GLOBAL programming. Now all we have is GLOBAL Toronto, Winnipeg, Saskatchewan, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver. Star Choice doesn't even carry GLOBAL Montreal.\n\nGoodbye Buffalo.\n\n(ABC) WKBW Channel 7 Eyewitness News w/ Keith Radford, Joanna Paceri, Mike Randall, and Jeff Russo.\n\nWasn't the legendary Irv Weinstein credited as the first broadcaster to say \"It's 11 o'clock, do you know where your children are?\", which ABC Buffalo brought back last year. Irv along with Rick Azar and Tom Jolls served as the longest running news anchor team in U.S. TV history.\n\n(CBS) WIVB Channel 4, Home of Western New York's News Leader w/ Don Postles, Jacquie Walker, Don Paul and John Murphy. Don Paul's been there for eons.\n\n(NBC) WGRZ On Your Side - Western New York's Information Center w/ Scott Levin, Mary Alice Demler, Ed Kilgore and Kevin O'Connell.\n\n___________________________\n\nOne of the members at broadbandreports.com summed it up nicely.\n\nIncredible... they can do they want, and if you don't like too bad. Less choice, more price.\n\nShame on Star Choice. :thumbsdn:\n\n______________________\n\np.s. Nothing against any of the good folks here from the Detroit area. We just want the Buffalo TV stations back.\n\nNice thread crap. What does listening to music, have to do with satelite TV? Last time I checked, this is the Visual Arts section, not the Music Forum.\n\nGuessing you don't visit Long And Winding Threads, or you'd know that many of us at sh.tv listen to a lot of music. Some very nice members and gorts that hang out in that section, share their daily LP, CD, mono and hi-rez spins. It loads of fun with great conversations on LP and CD pressings and such. Members can be found currently posting album titles in the following threads, along with some very nice photos of albums, turntables and digital players.\n\nListening to on vinyl, NOW!: (Part 16) | What Are You Listening To? - Part VIII (usually CDs) | The Latest MONO Sounds You've Been Listening To...Part 2 and\n\nWhat SACD or DVD-Audio Title Are You Listening To?\n\nThanks Eddie.\n\nYes.\n\nAs mentioned in my first post, Star Choice has dropped channels a couple/3 times over the past 2 years. The got away with dumping CBC Regina, SUN-TV, Global Halifax and from my hometown, CITY-TV/A-Channel, Winnipeg.\n\nHowever at the same they tried to dump CTV Calgary, my local CTV station. They took so much flack about dropping CTV Calgary that it was put back on the next day. Let's cross our fingers. Maybe enough feedback will bring back the Buffalo stations.\n\nJust read a Shaw Cable TV (they own Star Choice) press release from back in March. They're claiming that there isn't enough room for all the channels. They're clearing out these to add more hi-def Channels. \"It's what our viewers want.\" Really? Nobody asked me."
