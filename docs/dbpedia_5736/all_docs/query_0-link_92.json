        "text": "I checked TVFool.com for CBS where we having the problems. There is a co-channel warning. See below and attached.\n\nOur ByOne OTA is mounted high on a window about 10-12 off the ground. It’s heading is 180 degrees which is not too far off from the 153 degrees below.\n\nThere is no split signal and I’m not using any extra amplifier.\n\nWe are in a 1 story house and the OTA is up as high as possible on the window. The TV and Tablo are also right by this window.\n\nWe’re not opposed to buying a new OTA if that will help.\n\nWIVB-DT (Digital)\n\nChannel: 39 (4.1)\n\nNetwork: CBS\n\nMaximum ERP: 790.000 kW\n\nCoordinates: 42.659227 -78.625581\n\nEffective ERP: 790.000 kW (Adjusted according to your location)\n\nDistance: 28.3 miles Azimuth: 142 degrees Compass: 153 degrees\n\n“There are a few changes you can make to improve your Tablo’s reception:\n\nMake sure the antenna is as high up as possible.\n\nTry to avoid splitting the coaxial connection - there is a significant DB loss to the signal when you split the connection.\n\nReference http://www.tvfool.com/ to ensure that your antenna is pointed in correct direction.\n\nHere’s a link on optimal antenna placement: https://www.tablotv.com/blog/position-matters-hdtv-antenna-placement/\n\nShorten your coaxial cable; the longer the cable, the more lossy the connection will become.\n\nConduct frequent channel scans to test your changes (Settings > Edit channel lineup > Rescan)”\n\nTVFool has incorrect information for that station. You’re in the same market as me.\n\nChannel 4 moved from the southtowns I think over a year ago. They transmit from Grand Island from the same tower as channel 23 (the CW) and are on RF 32 with CW.\n\nIf your antenna faces 180 degrees, it would need 145 degrees of effective beam width to get the stations from Grand Island. (CBS, PBS, CW, Fox)\n\nRight now the southtowns towers have channel 2, 7, and 49. And notice channel 7 is entirely missing from tvfool’s prediction.\n\nAaaand… I just noticed you’re ON Grand Island … you’re so close to those towers you could be over driving your tuners. How are channels 2, 7, and 49 coming in for you?\n\nSorry… I missed this question…\n\nOverdriving your tuners basically means they’re getting too much signal. Too strong. Sometimes, too much of a good thing is still a good thing, but not when it comes to antennas.\n\nI saw a good analogy about this… it’s kind of like when you turn your music up REALLY LOUD!!!.. so loud that it starts to distort and either your ears or your equipment can’t handle it. If your tuners get too much signal it can distort and then the tuner begins to reject it.\n\nYou are SO close to those Grand Island towers that it puts you at risk for overdriving. Your 1ByOne antenna … is it the amplified one?\n\nIf yes, remove the amplifier and see if this improves your situation.\n\nIf it isn’t the amplified one, AND if you’re overdriving, then one easy way to cut the signal strength a bit would be to add a splitter. A 4-way splitter will cut your signal strength quite a bit. A 2-way splitter, not as much. Ideally you’d want to put terminators on the unused ports of the splitter, but if you try a 2-way splitter you can just run the “extra” port to your TV.\n\nIf you’re not overdriving your tuners, then none of this is helpful, but I think that’s a pretty fair explanation of overdriving."
