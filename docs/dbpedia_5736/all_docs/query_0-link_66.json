(Nasdaq: NXST) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc., has appointed Brien Kennedy as Vice President and General Manager of its broadcasting and digital operations in Buffalo, New York (DMA #52), overseeing WIVB-TV (CBS), WNLO-TV (CW) and their associated digital operations, including wivb.com.

Mr. Kennedy also worked in various sales positions at Gannett and Blair Television.\n\n“Brien is an exceptional industry leader with expertise in managing distinguished stations in multiple large- and medium-size markets,” said Ms. Underwood. “His depth and breadth of experience and results-oriented, entrepreneurial approach to the business of broadcasting and sales management are necessary skillsets to lead our Buffalo operations. Brien also has a long track record of transforming operations, driving both outstanding revenue results and market share growth. He has a deep understanding of how to develop exclusive local content for our viewers and digital users and effective multi-platform marketing opportunities for our clients. He also has built successful sales teams that have established enduring partnerships with local and national advertisers and sports franchises. We look forward to Brien’s contributions as we continue to enhance the effectiveness and value of our broadcast, digital and mobile services for local viewers and advertisers across Western New York.”\n\nCommenting on his new position, Mr. Kennedy noted, “I am excited to be heading to the wonderful city of Buffalo to take on this new opportunity at Nexstar, the nation’s leading local broadcast company. The staff at WIVB-TV, WNLO-TV, and wivb.com is talented, experienced and committed, and we will work together to continue generating results for our clients and enhancing the overall experience for our dedicated viewers and digital users. Nexstar’s strong commitment to superior local content production and service, combined with its scalable diversified marketing solutions will deliver distinct competitive advantages for our clients. After more than 30 years in the industry, Buffalo is where I belong. My wife and I are excited to move to Western New York and immerse ourselves in the local community.”\n\nMr. Kennedy has a BA in Communication Studies from the University of Maryland. He has been active in the communities in which he has worked and resided throughout his professional career. He has served as a board member on the Police Athletic League of Philadelphia, Make A Wish Minnesota, Youthlink of Minneapolis and Fresh Start Women’s Foundation Phoenix, as well as various industry boards.\n\nMr. Kennedy and Resa, his wife of 33 years, will be immediately relocating to Buffalo.
