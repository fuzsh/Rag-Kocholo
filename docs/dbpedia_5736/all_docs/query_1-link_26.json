        "text": "WLWT5 Reports on Vaccines for Kids\n\nDate Posted: 7/14/2022\n\nCincinnati, Ohios WLWT5, owned by Hearst Television, reported on a vaccine clinic at a local hospital and included an interview with Childrens Hospital Chief of Staff Dr. Patty Manning-Courtney about COVID vaccine hesitation. \"We appreciate how seriously families take the decision to vaccinate their children and how much concern there has been around safety on both sides of this equation,\" Manning-Courtney said. \"I cant think of a pediatrician who hasnt vaccinated their child in every age group. We are the first to line up and do this. And if you have a good trusting relationship with your pediatrician, then I think and you asked that question, What would you do with your child? We all say we would vaccinate.\"\n\nWMOT Discusses Vaccine Concerns from Immunocompromised\n\nDate Posted: 4/10/2021\n\nMiddle Tennessee State Universitys WMOT-FM Murfreesboro, Tenn., reported on the concerns from immunocompromised people regarding the vaccine and whether its safe to take it due to their health conditions.\n\nSenior Science and Health Editor/Correspondent Maria Godoy spoke with several doctors about the safety of the vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, such as patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, organ transplant recipients and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The report also stressed the importance of these patients getting vaccinated and discussing when would be the best time to get the vaccine with their doctor. Dr. Sharon Dowell, a rheumatologist at Howard University Hospital, said the bottom line for immunocompromised patients is the same as for everyone else, and really, truly, everyone should get vaccinated.\n\nWJXT Jacksonville Anchor Encourages Vaccine Participation\n\nDate Posted: 4/5/2021\n\nLongtime anchor Tom Wills from Graham Media Groups WJXT Jacksonville, Fla., received the first dose of his vaccine on January 22 and then went on Facebook to urge others to do the same.\n\nI know the appointments are hard to get. But its worth the effort, Wills said. We go back a long ways together and we want to stay together. So go get this shot.\n\nLater that night on the 6 p.m. newscast, Wills said the process could not have been easier and said he experienced no pain and no side effects. He encouraged viewers to get the vaccine to protect not only themselves but their loved ones.\n\nThe feeling of having some protection against this virus is indescribable, Wills said.\n\nWXIA-TV Turns to Skeptical Viewer for Vaccine Reporting\n\nDate Posted: 4/4/2021\n\nOn February 15, TEGNAs NBC affiliate WXIA-TV Atlanta, Ga., aired the segment Drawing Conclusions, following a local mother on a fact-finding journey to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWXIA turned the questioning over to Joy Howard, a mom of two girls and medical caregiver for her live-in elderly mother who was skeptical about getting vaccinated. She interviewed four medical experts and asked her own questions regarding the safety of the vaccines, how that safety was determined, the impact on children and the overwhelming amount of vaccine disinformation online.\n\nAt the end of her journey, Howard decided she would take the vaccine and invited WXIA along when she and her mother received their first doses of the vaccine.\n\niHeartMedia and ABC News Launch Covid Vaccine Podcast\n\nDate Posted: 4/1/2021\n\niHeartMedia launched a new original limited podcast series, \"COVID-19 Immunity in Our Community,\" on March 31 aimed at sharing timely and accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines from a journalistic perspective. Produced in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the show is hosted by ABC News television broadcaster Robin Roberts and new episodes will be released every two weeks.\n\nThe podcast will bring leaders and experts such as Dr. Anthony Fauci and other highly respected voices in the medical and scientific communities to have conversations separating fact from fiction and to arm listeners with the tools they need to make educated decisions about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe new podcast will also draw perspectives from Americans across different communities including health care workers, journalists, and skeptics, who each share their unique and personal experience with vaccination.\n\nWLWT Cincinnati Highlights Effort to Vaccinate Teachers\n\nDate Posted: 2/17/2021\n\nHearst Televisions NBC affiliate WLWT Cincinnati, Ohio, highlighted on February 17 the effort to vaccinate all teachers in the state so students can return to the classrooms. In Warren County, staff signed up online and picked a time slot to get vaccinated. More than 82% of teachers in Lebanon City Schools signed up to receive the vaccine, and around 140 shots of Pfizer vaccine were administered each hour in collaboration with Premier Health. \"Im excited to go ahead and get it and be a little safer around my students and for all those around me,\" said Caroline Kindell, a kindergarten teacher. There is also a waitlist for employees who failed to sign up by the deadline but will be eligible to receive one once more vaccines are available.\n\nKCBS Radio San Francisco Discusses Vaccine Efficacy\n\nDate Posted: 2/16/2021\n\nEntercom Communications Corporations KCBS Radio San Francisco, Calif., discussed the issue of vaccine efficacy during its Ask an Expert segment on February 16. Dr. Cody Meissner, professor of pediatrics at Tufts Medical Center and member of the FDA advisory panel on vaccines, answered submitted questions from listeners and discussed the different reported efficacy rate of the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine compared to the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Currently under the FDA approval process, Johnson & Johnson reported its one-dose vaccine is 66% protective against moderate to severe cases of COVID-19, compared to Pfizers 95% and Modernas 94% reported efficacy. \"Were seeing differences reported in the efficacy of different vaccines. But I think the very important point to remember is what we care most about is preventing severe illness, severe complications that result in intensive care admission or death, and I think all of the vaccines that are available are remarkably effective, theyre close to 100 percent in reducing death, said Dr. Meissner. All of these vaccines that have been evaluated so far show equal efficacy in preventing very severe disease.\n\nKTRK-TV Houston Hosts Townhalls Aimed at Hispanic and Black Communities\n\nDate Posted: 1/28/2021\n\nABC-owned KTRK-TV Houston, Texas, hosted a two-night townhall on the COVID-19 vaccine and infection rate focused on addressing concerns in the Hispanic and Black communities. The CDC says Black and Latinx Americans are nearly three times more likely to die from COVID-19 complications than whites. The first night was hosted by Anchor Mayra Moreno on January 27, and discussed how hesitation about vaccination, resistance to mask wearing or social distancing and fear of seeking medical attention in underserved communities can lead to higher infection rates and deaths. \"We come from a culture where, typically, we dont like to ask for help,\" said Dr. Laura Murillo, president of the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. \"I cannot begin to tell you how many conversations I have had personally trying to convince people to pay attention to the facts, the science.\"\n\nThe second night was hosted by Anchor Chauncy Glover and local leaders warned that infections and hospitalizations in the Black community are likely to rise unless hesitation about the vaccine is addressed soon. \"The legacy of mistrust goes back many, many years, and its not just in medicine but in other areas,\" said Dr. Jacquelyn Johnson Minter, health and human services director of Fort Bend County. \"But I think the really important thing to consider is that we dont want that legacy to then create a new legacy of more illness.\" Minter also addressed how the name Operation Warp Speed can lead to questions about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine and discussed how the vaccine had been researched and in development since 2002. \"We did not want to be in the position of pushing out a vaccine that we didnt have confidence in, and I can tell you, we all have confidence in this one,\" Minter said. \"All of us have rolled up our sleeves. We did our homework, and by about July, we were ready, we felt like things were good, and we felt like not only could we take it, but we could promote it.\"\n\nWQCR-FM Brings Spanish-Language Covid News Nationwide\n\nDate Posted: 9/16/2020\n\nRivera Communications WQCR-FM Birmingham, Ala., has been delivering coronavirus updates and information to Spanish-speaking listeners and communities across the state. The station has amassed over 200,000 listeners across the country, in part due to their reliable Spanish-language and community-focused updates on the virus. Locally, the station serves as a lifeline resource for Spanish-speaking communities.\n\n\"We were working with local businesses to announce whether they were going to be open or just going to be for delivery, or if they already had their doors open to the public, the schedule, etc. Weve been working with the community and the community has been working with us,\" said Cinthia Saenz, assistant manager at Rivera Communications.\n\nWisconsin PBS Stations Offer At-home Learning for Fall Semester\n\nDate Posted: 9/8/2020\n\nPBS Wisconsin and Milwaukee PBS are partnering with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction to support at-home learning for students of all ages during the pandemic by broadcasting weekday television schedules of programming with digital resources that connect to Wisconsins state academic standards.\n\nBeginning September 1, PBS Wisconsin is dedicating the 11 a.m.- 4 p.m. daytime weekday schedule on Wisconsin PBS.

A significant problem throughout the pandemic has been a language barrier. A majority of Hispanic and Latino families rely on Spanish radio stations to receive information.\n\nThere are radio stations throughout the state that are bilingual to reach these communities. When this pandemic hit, one of the first things we did is put health experts on the radio to start answering questions and provide information to our Spanish families, said Margie Gonzalez, Executive Director of ICHA.\n\nKDVR Launches CHANGING COURSE: Back to School During the Pandemic\n\nDate Posted: 8/1/2020\n\nBeginning August 3, Nexstars KDVR Denver is focusing coverage on the changing landscape of the 2020-21 school year.

Scripps Company has raised over $2 million for food banks in 40 markets to help communities during the pandemic. Funds are being distributed to food pantries in the markets where Scripps operates TV stations and its national brands Newsy, the Katz networks and the Scripps Washington Bureau.\n\nThe outpouring of generosity weve seen from Scripps audiences across the country is an incredible testament to the connection between our brands and their communities.

A donation of $10 or more fills a Care Box with healthy, fresh food and other non-perishable staples for families facing food insecurity.\n\nI should never underestimate the generosity of our viewers, said Don Vesely, vice president and general manager of WMTV NBC15. Our goal of $1 million seemed to be a stretch for a first-time fundraising effort. To finish more than three times our goal truly made an impact on our community.\n\nThe campaign kicked off March 19 with a challenge: The first $25,000 raised was matched by the Alliant Energy Foundation. By Monday evening, March 23, the effort had raised $248,000 and the giving continued. National Guardian Life; The Evjue Foundation, which is the charitable arm of The Capital Times; and an anonymous donor, also provided matches during the campaigns first 100 days, marked on June 26.\n\nThe response that weve gotten from the public has been tremendous, said Michelle Orge, President & CEO of Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin. We are so grateful to NBC15 for playing such a critical role in helping the public understand that the need as a result of the pandemic was, and continues to be, great.

The goal is to increase milk inventory at the foodbank to give to families in need.\n\nThe need for food, especially milk, on the table of area homes is critical. With COVID-19 adding to the stress on food insecurity, I am thrilled that our community once again stepped up to help, said Don Vesely, VP/General Manager of NBC15.\n\nEach week during the coronavirus pandemic, Second Harvest has distributed about 6,000 gallons of milk. About 80-percent of the milk distributed is purchased.\n\nThe response from the public has been remarkable, said Michelle Orge, president & CEO of Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin. Thanks to NBC15, our sponsors, and of course everyone who has supported the campaign, we will be able to provide a healthy product to those we serve, and help the local dairy producing community at the same time.
