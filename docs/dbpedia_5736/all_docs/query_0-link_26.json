        "text": "WDIV-Local 4, a Graham Media Group station, won the prestigious 2022 National Edward R. Murrow Award for Best Newscast (Local 4 News at 11 p.m.) for coverage of the Oxford High School shooting.\n\nNational winners were announced Thursday, Aug 11, by the Radio Television Digital News Association.\n\n“We are truly honored to be the recipient of this national award that holds newsrooms to such high standards in journalism,” said WDIV News Director Kim Voet. “Our team handled the coverage of this tragic event with compassion and sensitivity for the Oxford community.”\n\n“This day will forever be etched in all of our hearts,” said Vice President and General Manager Bob Ellis. “Although our news team had an important job to do during that horrific time, they covered it with grace, compassion, and respect. Since then, we have built relationships with the families and school community in Oxford, and we will always be here to tell their stories as they continue to recover and heal.”\n\nThe RTDNA has been honoring outstanding achievements in electronic journalism with the Edward R. Murrow Awards since 1971. Murrow's pursuit of excellence in journalism embodies the spirit of the awards that carry his name.\n\nThis honor comes after receiving a Regional Edward R. Murrow Award in May and another distinguished tribute in March -- the Michigan Association of Broadcasters Station of the Year Award – which WDIV-Local 4 won for the eighth year in a row.\n\nAbout WDIV-Local 4\n\nLocal 4 News is currently the No. 1 newscast at 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 11 p.m. in Nielsen ratings for the Detroit television market and is honored to be named Station of the Year by the Michigan Association of Broadcasters for the eighth year in a row. WDIV is the No. 1 NBC affiliate in the top 20 LPM markets. In addition, Local 4's ClickOnDetroit.com is a top breaking news and weather website in Michigan and the No. 1 news website in Metro Detroit.\n\nWDIV-Local 4 has been honored, above all local broadcast stations in the country, with the National Association of Broadcasters Service to America Award. The prestigious award presented by the NAB Education Foundation acclaims WDIV's ongoing commitment to outstanding community service.\n\nThe NAB Service to America Award recognizes the efforts of the entire station as a leader in serving the public with significant contributions from every department.\n\nHallmarks of this station-wide commitment:\n\n* Year-long coverage of the Flint Water Crisis which included an unwavering news focus, a primetime special and travel to Washington, D.C. to cover developments on Capitol Hill. Using the power of local television and the support of a strong and caring community, the station organized the Flint Water Crisis 4 Our Families statewide telethon and raised $1.13 million.\n\n* Help Me Hank: The School Project is a commitment to improve the physical environment of Thurgood Marshall Elementary-Middle School in Detroit. The station's consumer unit, Help Me Hank, partnered with the Detroit Public School Community District to identify a school that was in crucial need of building renovations.\n\n* Arab in America with Sandra Ali is a series of news reports showcasing the personal stories of Arab Americans in Metro Detroit.\n\n* True Blue is a series of stories dedicated to showing life as a police officer and putting a face with the badge. The Local 4 Defenders are trying to bridge the gap between police and the community to stop future violence.\n\n* Support of The Heat and Warmth Fund, Komen's Race for the Cure, Red Cross, JDRF, Bookstock and other community organizations.\n\n* Strong locally produced long and short-form programming that showcases the heart of our community. Highlights include the North American International Auto Show, America's Thanksgiving Parade, Live in the D, The Ford Fireworks, Flashpoint and the Local 4 Film Challenge.\n\n\"This award reflects the hard work and contribution of every single member of our WDIV/ClickOn Detroit team. I couldn't be more happy and proud of what we do here at this station,\" said Vice-President and General Manager Marla Drutz.\n\nIn the NABEF's press release announcing the award recipients it was stated, \"Through news coverage, philanthropy, and community service, WDIV puts the needs of viewers first.\"\n\nMore Info"
