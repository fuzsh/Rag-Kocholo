The associated website is wivb.com which provides news, sports, weather, politics, and crime reporting.\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nFunded by / Ownership\n\nWIVB – Buffalo is owned by Nexstar Media Group, which owns around 200 TV stations nationwide. The founder, chairman, president, and CEO of Nexstar is Perry A. Sook. According to Open Secrets, Nexstar Media group gave more money to Republicans in the 2018 election cycle (45% to Democrats, 55% to Republicans). However, in 2020 they gave more to Democrats (55% Democrats, 45% to Republicans). Advertising generates revenue.\n\nAnalysis / Bias\n\nWIVB – Buffalo website publishes news for the greater Buffalo, New York area. Local news features original reporting with minimal bias such as this: Buffalo man indicted on murder charges after allegedly killing estranged wife’s father, beating wife\n\nMany stories also contain videos from the TV Station. National and international news is covered through Nexstar Media Wire, the Associated Press, and other large credible media outlets.\n\nEditorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they report political news with minimal bias, such as this CNN suspends Chris Cuomo for helping brother in scandal. Political reporting is reasonably balanced, covering both sides and avoidings using emotional language. In general, they report news factually and with minimal bias.\n\nFailed Fact Checks\n\nNone in the last 5 years.\n\nOverall, we rate the WIVB – Buffalo Least Biased based on neutral straight news reporting without offering opinion pieces. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (D.
