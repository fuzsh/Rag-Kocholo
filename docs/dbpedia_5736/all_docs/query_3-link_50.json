The unofficial Dean of Western New York weather, Don Paul announced his return on his Facebook page over the weekend.\n\nDon and I have been friends for years (he used to do weather for 96.1 in the early days), and I have always found him to be credible and an excellent source of information. Don, since retiring also does a column in the Buffalo News.\n\nYou may remember Don's last day at NEWS 4 back in 2016...\n\nTo use a term coined by meteorologists at WIVB-TV...consider yourselves \"4 WARNED\"."
