        "text": "Early Warning is critical is any disaster situation. There are various warning methods available to County officials in the event that a disaster or emergency situation requires prompt notification to the public.\n\nEmergency or Disaster Examples\n\nTornadoes\n\nFloods\n\nHazardous Materials Incidents\n\nFermi 2 Nuclear Power Plant Accident\n\nEnemy Attack\n\nWarning Methods\n\nOutdoor Warning Sirens\n\nTone-Alert Monitors\n\nEmergency Alert System [EAS]\n\nCitizens can also purchase a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio. Information about this indoor warning system can be found at the bottom of this page.\n\nOutdoor Warning Sirens\n\nSirens are used to provide an emergency warning to persons out-of-doors; they are not designed to penetrate buildings. In Monroe County, these emergency warnings could be for a tornado, hazardous material spill, or a plant accident at the Enrico Fermi 2 Nuclear Power Plant in Newport. When you hear a siren outside of the normal monthly testing (last Wednesday of the month at 10 am), go inside immediately and tune your radio or TV to an Emergency Alert Station (see list below) for official news and information about the emergency.\n\nSirens for the Fermi 2 plant are located within a 10-mile radius called the Emergency Planning Zone, or EPZ, of the plant. During the monthly testing, sirens will sound the \"Alert\" tone, which is a three-minute continuous blast. This tone will be activated for any emergency requiring public warning and notification. Within the Fermi 2 EPZ, there are no longer voice sirens. A single tone siren with no voice system has been implemented, which is consistent with most other nuclear power plant communities throughout the country.\n\nThe county maintains and operates a system of high power voice/alert sirens that are located throughout the county.\n\nTone Alert Radio System\n\nEnsuring the safety of schools and industry within Monroe County is a goal within the Emergency Management Division. Most schools (public and private) and industry within the County have opted to purchase a tone-alert monitor to warn them of impending emergency situations.\n\nTone-Alert monitors can be activated from either the Emergency Management or Central Dispatch. A two-tone encoding signal is transmitted via radio, followed by a voice announcement indicating the type of emergency and what precautions should be taken.\n\nTone-Alert Monitor Sites\n\nJefferson Public Schools\n\nBedford Public Schools\n\nMonroe Public Schools\n\nAirport Public Schools\n\nDetroit Edison Coal Powered Generating Plant\n\nLa-Z-Boy Incorporated\n\nEmergency Alert System [EAS]\n\nThe Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) is now the Emergency Alert System (EAS). The Federal Communications Commission is currently working on expanding and improving this system to better serve the needs of citizens and emergency workers. Monroe County is part of the Southeast Michigan Operational Area.\n\nEAS Stations\n\nRadio Stations\n\nWJR 760 am. Detroit - EAS Primary Station (LP-1)\n\nWWJ 950 am. Detroit - EAS Secondary Primary Station (LP-2)\n\nWCSX 94.7 FM Detroit\n\nWMIM 98.3 FM Monroe/Luna Pier\n\nWJOF 88.1 FM Monroe\n\nTelevision Stations\n\nWJBK-TV Channel 2 Detroit\n\nWDIV-TV Channel 4 Detroit\n\nWXYZ-TV Channel 7 Detroit\n\nWMYD-TV Channel 20 Detroit\n\nWKBD-TV Channel 50 Detroit\n\nWTVS-TV Channel 56 Detroit\n\nWWJ-TV Channel 62 Detroit\n\nNOAA Weather Radios\n\nA transmitter is located in Lenawee County that covers both the Monroe and Lenawee regions, plus several counties in northern Ohio.\n\nYou may take advantage of these broadcasts to get up-to-the-minute weather updates, and storm warnings in real time. By purchasing a NOAA weather-alert receiver from an electronics store. When purchasing a receiver, be sure that it has the capability of SAME (Specific Area Message Encoding - for filtering out unwanted broadcasts), and also the tone-alert feature that will activate when a watch or warning is issued for our area.\n\nTo use this service, program your weather radio to frequency 162.450. Residents living in the northern townships of the county who have trouble receiving on this frequency may tune to the main Weather Radio frequency at 162.550."
