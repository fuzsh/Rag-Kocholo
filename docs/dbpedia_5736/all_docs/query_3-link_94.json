        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by French_guy_2012\n\nHello\n\nI am buying a house in Rochester Hills - 48306 and was wondering what kind of channels I could get for free (over the air)\n\nI am not a great fan of all those tv channels you buy with Comcast and others.......I would only need internet, and some over the air free channel would be enough\n\nThanks\n\nI ran a check for OTA TV in a reference point for the 48306 Zip Code, and, With a modest outdoor antenna, you should be able to get all of the Detroit stations - they are all between 15 and 20 miles away, and all are basically south-southwest of there. You have plenty of extra signal strength unless there is a hill or a very big building to the SSW of you.\n\n*subject to change w.o notice:\n\n2.1 WJBK Fox\n\n4.1 WDIV NBC\n\n4.2 This TV (Old classic movies and not-classic movies from the 80s)\n\n7.1 WXYZ ABC\n\n7.2 LWN (shows about healthy living products - of interest to almost noone)\n\n7.3 Bounce (entertainment selected for the African-American community)\n\n18.1 - 18.5 set of religious channels\n\n20.1 WMYD MyNetwork TV\n\n20.2 (currently repeats 20.1 - look for this to change in the future)\n\n23.1 Daystar (religion)\n\n31.1 WPXD Ion\n\n31.2 Qubo (for children age 5-12 or so)\n\n31.3 Ion Life (like LWN, but with some travel stuff)\n\n50.1 WKBD The CW\n\n56.1 WTVS PBS\n\n56.2 More PBS programs, time shifts and reruns (a nice channel to have)\n\n56.3 Create (Home improvement, cooking and travel)\n\n62.1 WWJ CBS\n\nChannel 38, Mount Clemens (WADL) should come in as well, though it is southeast of you.\n\n38.1 WADL reruns from 1960-90, but some infomercials\n\n38.2 Antenna TV (yes, that's what it is called) more reruns (some pretty good ones, like Adam-12 and M*A*S*H)\n\n38.3 Word (religion)\n\n38.4 duplicates 38,1\n\nOne close local station is WCMZ, Channel 28, which is plenty strong enough, but you would need either a rotator or an omnidirectional antenna. (It's main channel program will often duplicate that of 56.1, anyway)\n\nWindsor stations (9.1 CBET and 32.1 TVOntario) would be a little more difficult, needing a medium-size directional antenna, and consider that most houses in Rochester Hills are under HOAs and won't allow an outdoor antenna that won't fit in a 39\" circle (the HOA rules ban all antennas, but US Government intervention allows small ones).\n\nAn indoor antenna might work, especially if your TV is in a south-facing window, or you are in a house with a wood or vinyl exterior.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by leroythelion\n\nI think CBC was supposed to have gone all-digital on August 1. I don't know if that happened.\n\nCBET (CBC, English) channel 9, went digital at midnight August 31/September 1, 2011\n\nCICO32 (TVOntario, also in English) channel 32 went digital about two weeks earlier.\n\nIn both these cases, the stations did what is called a \"flash-cut\". Unlike Detroit (and most other USA) stations, there was no temporary digital transmitter in a different actual channel. These stations transmitted only in analogue (we are talking Canada here) until they shut down the old transmitter and switched on a new digital transmitter on the same actual channel.\n\nThere is no \"country block\" system as found on satellite dishes and DVD players. Canadians with digital sets or boxes can watch an American station of the signal is adequate, and American viewers can watch Canadian stations if the signal is in.\n\nCBEFT (SRC, French) channel 54, shut down their analogue transmitter and signed on a weaker analogue transmitter on channel 35 on 9/1/2011. At the end of July 31, 2012, they shut down 35 with no digital replacement. Now, people in Windsor have to subscribe to pay TV if they want SRC, and, as far as I know, there is no way someone in Michigan can legally watch SRC."
