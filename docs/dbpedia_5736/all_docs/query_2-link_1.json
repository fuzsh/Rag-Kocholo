Independent radio is a similar concept with regards to community radio stations, although with a slightly different meaning (as many non-\"indie\" commercial broadcasting radio stations produce the vast majority of their own programming, perhaps retaining only a nominal affiliation with a radio network for news updates or syndicated radio programming).
