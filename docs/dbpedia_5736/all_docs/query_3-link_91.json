        "text": "You may have noticed as of late, record stores are flooded with CD's containing so-called \"FM radio broadcasts\" of famous artists. These are shady enough (one of the labels - 'Zip City' - appears to be non-existent), but you may have also noticed...\n\nSome of these aren't \"FM radio broadcasts\" at all.\n\nYes, some of these CD's, evidently released through some kind of legal loophole concerning radio performances, are nothing but actual bootlegs mislabeled \"radio broadcasts.\" For example, a Beach Boys one called \"With Me Tonight\" (purporting early 70's radio performances) contains the entirety of a 'SMiLE' bootleg and nothing else; there's also a Guns 'n' Roses one that merely clones a bootleg called \"The Ultimate Rarities Collection\" which contains, among other things, an amateur 'dance remix' of Sweet Child o' Mine (mislabeled as a \"radio performance\") and a 1972 version of \"King Herod's Song\" from JCS falsely labeled as an Axl Rose/Meat Loaf duet! No radio material in sight!\n\nMy question is, how the hell are these legal - and even moreso, how are they getting away with blatantly putting out bootlegged studio material under false pretenses?\n\nI've been wondering about this too. They're stocked in otherwise (I thought) \"reputable\" stores (as in, at the mall â€“ not anything more specialist or underground) so they must be available for stores to order via mass-market distributors alongside all the other releases. It's not so much \"how can they sell them?\" as \"how and why are they getting them?\"\n\nI think many retailers don't care or bother to check if these are legit. As mentioned, in EU a lot of the gray market stuff is allowed. In the states nobody seems to care if they can make a buck. If they get reported maybe they will be taken down but don't count on it.\n\nSame here in the US. Even early Beatles material (including album tracks and BBC performances) have been rehashed on \"grey market\" albums.\n\nExactly. Some of these gray market labels do pay songwriting royalties which is a plus, but the main issue seems to be whether a particular artist wants the performance available for purchase due to issues of quality. Depending on a particular title and the source material used, the sound quality can vary from excellent to fair to poor.\n\nYes, that's the reason those radio broadcasts turn up as \"official\" releases in Europe. I think artists can still easily block such releases but I guess most of them simply don't care.\n\nThe larger bands have been aware of the legalities of these recording becoming part of public domain. We've seen BBC recording from The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, R.E.M., and the Pixies released as official releases. The Beatles and Led Zeppelin released theirs in the '90s to head off the flood of grey market releases that would have been made available when the conversion to public domain would have gone into effect.\n\nThere are plenty of boots for sale on Amazon as well. Doing a search for The Who pulled up 4 of them, 1 for The Faces, 2 for Procol Harum, 4 for The Kinks, 6 for Genesis, 9 for Camel and a bunch for Deep Purple.\n\nYour mall still has a store that sells CDs? I'm jealous.\n\nI don't think this is quite true, for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. the Beatles released their BBC compilation in 1994, which was before the 50-year copyright law existed.\n\n2. there are still numerous radio broadcasts by the Beatles and Zep (and dozens of other bands) which have not been released officially. If the bands were really concerned about grey market releases, wouldn't it stand to reason that all the other broadcasts would get released officially?"
