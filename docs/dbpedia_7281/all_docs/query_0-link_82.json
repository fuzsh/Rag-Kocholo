        "text": "Viewbank College’s Young persons Plan for the Planet (YPPP)Team was recently declared as the ResourceSmart secondary school Action Team of the year. They were awarded this very prestigious award for their work through the Young Persons Plan for the Planet program. The YPPP program encourages students to use design thinking and STEAM and develop social enterprises that offer solutions to local, national and global issues in response to the UN Sustainability development goals.\n\nThe team in response to Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production and Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss, undertook a project ‘ the Bumble wraps’ to encourage the reduction of plastic use in food packaging by making and producing bees wax wraps from donated cloth. The students then sold these at various school events and raised a total of $300 which was then donated to the Wheen Bee Foundation to continue their important work in the protection of bees.\n\nThe Wheen Bee Foundation Research Fund is a registered Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR). Donations of $2 or more are tax deductible in Australia. ABN 84 139 073 082\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply."
