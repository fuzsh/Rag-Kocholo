        "text": "Beyond the VCE ranking\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a school for your child, it's important to consider all of your options. With so many schools to choose from in Melbourne, it can be hard to know where to begin.\n\nThere are so many features to consider about a school, that transcend a mere number on a list. For this reason, the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority doesn't rank schools. While we definitely agree with this approach - the ranking can be a great starting point for your research.\n\nTo help you narrow down your hunt, we've also compiled a list of the six most popular factors to consider when choosing a secondary school.\n\n1. Academic reputation\n\nThe first thing you'll want to look at when choosing a school is its academic record. How do its students perform? What are the average VCE study scores? What percentage of VCE students go on to university? Which VCE subjects does the school excel in?\n\nThe Melbourne High School ranking, NAPLAN rankingâ€”or even the Australian Education Awardsâ€”are indicative of general academic prowess, but keep in mind, that these only give you a small snapshot of a school's performance. So if you're looking for a school that offers a well-rounded education, you must search beyond the rankings and recognition.\n\n2. Facilities and resources\n\nAnother factor to consider is the facilities and resources that a school has to offer. Do they have state-of-the-art technology and laboratories? Do they have a wide range of VCE subjects on offer? Modern classrooms? A well-equipped library? A good selection of technology, performing and outdoor education? All of these can make a big difference in your child's learning experience.\n\n3. Student-to-teacher ratio\n\nWhen looking at secondary schools, the student-to-teacher ratio will give you an indication of the amount of individual attention your child will receive. A lower student-teacher ratio means more individualised attention for your child, which can be beneficial for their learning, leading to improved grades and a better foundation for tertiary study.\n\n4. Extra-curricular activities\n\nThe best schools in Melbourne offer a wide variety of co-curricular activities, from sports teams to drama clubs to robotics. Consider what sort of activities your child is interested in and make sure that the school you choose has a good selection.\n\nPay close attention to the quality of the programs on offer as well â€“ you'll want to make sure that they're well-run and that your child will be able to get the most out of them.\n\n5. Location and price\n\nYou'll want to consider the school's location. Is it close to your home? Is it easily accessible by public transport? If you have kids in junior school, you'll also want to think about whether the high school is close to their primary school â€“ this can make the transition a lot easier for them.\n\nKeep in mind that schools in more central locations tend to be more expensive than those in the suburbs, and of course, public high schools will set you back a lot less than private ones.\n\n6. Culture\n\nThe culture of a school is the final factor on our list. This vibe can be difficult to define. But you need to get a feel for it before you make your decision â€“ after all, your child will be spending six hours there every day! Is it a catholic school or non-denominational? Does it have a religious affiliation? What are the core values of the school?\n\nTo get a sense of the ethos, we recommend you visit the school and read through their mission statement. This will give you an idea of their philosophy and what they're trying to achieve.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nChoosing the right high school for your child is a big decision. But don't let it stress you out â€“ remember, there's no such thing as the perfect school. By taking the time to research all of your options you can be sure to find a school that's the right fit for your family.\n\nWhile the role played by the school is certainly key - there are a large range of factors that impact on academic results. In addition to the quality of teaching, note the suburb, (SES) socio-economic status, background of students, whether the school is selective in its student intake etc. Just like the high school ranking, take these things into account, but don't let them be the only deciding factor.\n\nAt the end of the day, the most important thing is that your child is happy and engaged in their learning. The best school for them is the one that will allow them to reach their full potential, regardless of where it places on the VCE school rankings. If you think they're currently either falling behind or not being challenged enough, don't hesitate to reach out to us.\n\nWhether they need a VCE tutor in the lead-up to their exams or a coach to help build their maths confidence before they start high school, our bespoke programs have you covered.
