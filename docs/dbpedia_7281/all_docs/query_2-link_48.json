I have lived here since 1994 and have never regretted it or the lifestyle. There is the Yarra walking trail, the river, horse riding school... Neighbours are friendly and watch out for each other (without being intrusive). Train station is only a few kms away and also nearby bus routes available. It also falls within the much touted Viewbank Secondary College precinct. The only downside is there isn't a vast array of local cafes and restaurants and, being a family area there is very little nightlife. Although, its only a 2-5 min drive to those in Heidelberg, Lower Plenty, Greensborough, Ivanhoe and Montmorency.\n\nWho lives here?\n\nProfessionals\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Boring but safe\"\n\nEh\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"boring suburb\"\n\nMeh.glad I left.\n\nFilled with cyclists who believe the road revolves around them, the noise and roadworks from the northeast link construction will drive you mad, no cafes, nothing in the area beside families.

It is a Thinking place. It is a Walking and Cycling place.\n\nThe gentrification that's happening around Viewbank is not your usual cafes, shops, etc. But a gentrification of quality people coming to live here, and the activities that you can do here.\n\nIt encourages living in the moment (let's get going), as well as living in a Zen like moment (be still and think).\n\nGreat for\n\nGenteel citizen\n\nTree line\n\nPrized school zone\n\nGreat view and vista\n\nWho lives here?\n\nProfessionals\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nTrendy & Stylish\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Great school and good mix of professional CBD worker looking for space\"\n\nA good place to take long walks and stay healthy cycling and walking the dog\n\nGreat for\n\nTree line\n\nPrized school zone\n\nGreat view and vista\n\nFriendly, schools\n\nWho lives here?\n\nProfessionals\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Heaven for cyclists and healthy living\"\n\nLet me invite you to where I stay, a place where I can grab my bike and straight to the Lower Plenty Trail, and if I want to straight to Main Yarra Trail to cycle to the city.\n\nI have met many cyclists around Melbourne, Viewbank is their favourite place, why?

Go to work in the city via train. Reach home to plentiful of parklands. What I love most about Viewbank is its friendly neighbours who are country lovers, active and professionals with young family, mostly working in the city but love to come home next to country parklands.\n\nMy kids love the schools - two boys in primary school and my daughter in Viewbank College. These two schools are highly regarded among the students and their parents. Not sure why before I moved to Viewbank.

Looks like any where you stay in Viewbank, you can walk to school. My elder daughter just love Viewbank College with good manner schoolmates around, and supportive, experienced teachers, no wonder Viewbank College is one of the top ten public school in Victoria!\n\nIt is small suburb with lot of characters, mostly professional with families, mainly who work in the city as IT professionals, professors, programmers, a few city cafe owners, ... and a few medical scientists! A brainy place to be, I presumed. Maybe because it is close to Yarra Park, Yarra river ... a place to ponder while walking along the trail.\n\nThe house prices are getting pricey though because of the school zone and a good place to raise a family.\n\nGreat for\n\nTightly-held pocket with mostly professional with families\n\nGreat internet - Fiber and ADSL+\n\nLovely parkland\n\nPrized school zone\n\nWho lives here?\n\nProfessionals\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nTrendy & Stylish\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Peaceful and friendly, 14kms from the city\"\n\nTwo years ago we moved from Alphington to Viewbank. I am very fussy about where I live and I am very impressed by Viewbank. We are in the area near Viewbank college. Fresh air, peace and quiet with polite friendly neighbours (not too friendly!) and trendy cafes (i.e. Miss marie), shops and train not far in Rosanna.\n\nIf you are heading into the city, Warringal shops and Burgundy street have heaps of shops. The Yarra and parklands pretty much at your doorstep, I'm really very surprised as to why its not a very expensive area. The houses and blocks are large, however all mid-century. With a bit of cosmetic renovation the mid-century dag can be transformed into some mid-century cool. 1 hour drive into the city during peak and about the same via train.

Viewbank suits my family most because it is a safe neighbourhood, close by libraries, beautiful streets and most important of all, my oldest son will be heading for Viewbank College next year, which is known for its academic excellent, music and great facility.\n\nIt is an up and coming pretty suburb with unique characters that suit young families.\n\nGreat for\n\nTree line\n\nSafe\n\nFriendly, schools\n\nGreat view and vista\n\nPrized school zone\n\nNot great for\n\nLittle shops choice\n\nWho lives here?\n\nProfessionals\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nTrendy & Stylish\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Prized Viewbank school zone with Yarra River just a stroll away!\"\n\nG'day and Halo\n\nWe have been living in McKinnon for almost 15 years and have recently move to Viewbank. We love it!\n\nThe Yarra River is just a stroll away through the Plenty River Trail. Summer fun swimming. Spring slow stroll. Autumn reflection. We have spent endless time walking around the few parks in Viewbank and of course the Yarra River. Although Viewbank is just a small patch north east of Melbourne, it is a big attraction to professional family with children because it is safe, clean and green.\n\nOur children are in the Viewbank Secondary College now, and they just love it there. According to them, it is comparable to Mckinnon ... with more balance academic life. Over time, we can observed that more and more families are moving into Viewbank to enter Viewbank SC. Great school with highly committed teachers.\n\nI have noted the house prices in Viewbank is inching higher and higher and I am guessing because of few factors that hold the house prices here: green parks, prized school zone, great family surrounding and I can't say enough, the Yarra River.\n\nCheers ...

I think Viewbank area is better for us as a family with the great schools, preschools, great friendly neighbors, child and maternity health center, beautiful parks and little convenient shops within walking distance. He said that it was due to the public transport situation. I still don´t understand, because in Eaglemont we also had to drive to the station and it has no school, preschool etc. Yes, it´s 10 minutes closer to the city but that´s not enough reason for the great price difference.\n\nViewbank is a beautiful place, with fantastic views, close to so many different areas but yet quiet. If you don´t have a car, the bus will take you to the station (!). The neighbors are very friendly and Price park is getting a completely new playground and so many children of all ages meet there.

Rosanna Village, Burgundy Street, Warringal Shopping Centre and Rosanna and Heidelberg train stations are only 3-5 minutes drive away. The proposed freeway if it goes ahead will not impact on the suburbs wonderful parklands as it will be built as a tunnel under the existing creek and banyule flats area. It will send house prices skyrocketing when the drive to/from the city is further reduced.

Poor public transport options and little to no business around (i.e. no restaurants) and TERRIBLE internet options (no optus cable, no telstra cable and as it is so far away from Heidelberg Exchange either no ADSL or very poor quality ADSL)... No Telstra Cable also means no Foxtel unless you get satelite, the problem there is with the poor broadband options you cannot use IPTV either so little option other than regular free to air TV..\n\nParks are very good around the area, though I am not sure what will happen when/if the freeway does go through as is planned.\n\nNot great for\n\nPoor transport\n\nVery Poor Internet Access\n\nWho lives here?\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nRetirees\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Long term resident\"\n\nMy family and I have lived in Viewbank since 1997.

You have migrant neighbours who complain about anything and everything. But on the otherside, we have fatastic parks and playgrounds, tennis courts, close to shopping (Rosanna, Heidelberg, not too far from Doncaster). Plenty of primary schools to choose from, and Viewbank college zoned secondary school.\n\nWho lives here?\n\nProfessionals\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"'Happy in Viewy'\"\n\nFor a suburb that is only 12 -14 km from the city, Viewbank (previously Rosanna East) is a wonderful place to live. It has well sized homes and blocks with wide, winding, undulating, leafy streetscapes. It has very little medium/high density dwellings and hence very few renting residents. Property turnover is lower than the average suburb which suggests resident satifaction. The residents are pedominantly professional families and retired couples who originally built here. It has a definite community feel, is safe, traffic free and quiet.\n\nViewbank is no more than 10 minutes drive from the following.\n\nThe Ring Road, the Eastern Freeway, Austin Hospital, Warringal Private Hospital, Heidelberg and Rosanna train stations, the highly regarded (and zoned) Viewbank College, Marcellin College, Our Lady Of Mercy College, Loyola College, Parade College, Ivanhoe Boys and Girls Grammar Schools, La Trobe University, Northland Shopping Centre, Greensborough Plaza, (Doncaster Shopping Town 15 mins), Warringal Plaza, Burgundy St and Rosanna Village shops, the Yarra River, Main Yarra Trail, Banyule and Yarra Flats, the soon to be built state of the art Greensborough Aquatic Centre and numerous other facilities.\n\nAsk and of the residents and they'll tell you that 'Viewy' is the best kept secret in Melbourne.\n\nWho lives here?\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Gone\"\n\nRecently moved out of Viewbank - found it too isolated with a lack of reliable public transport; very car reliant and no facilities within working distance. Proximity to a McDonalds and Quix found many late night party goers passing through. Neighbours were rude, dirty and couldn't mind their own business. The streets are too narrow and many houeses are too close together. Had letterbox smashed a few times by the students of the local school. There is no consistency in the housing with some houses are very unkept due to high level of rental properties and lower priced properties. Feel that either Heidelberg or Rosanna a better place to live due to facilities and capital appreciation.\n\nWho lives here?\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Perfect for families\"\n\nViewbank is a great suburb to live in if you have a family, in particular a young family. It is a quiet suburb layed out over a series of gentle hills, giving many of the streets views of the parklands or surrounding suburbs. The locals are all very friendly. The nearby primary schools are great, in particular, the viewbank primary vice principal is very passionate and friendly. The high school is well regarded although we haven't used it yet. There are a number of child care centres and kindegarten centres. The maternal health nurse is extremely friendly and helpful. Basically, if you have a young family or are about to start it is a fantastic place to live.\n\nWho lives here?\n\nProfessionals\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nRetirees\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"14 km's from the city but you may as well be in the country!\"\n\nWe moved in the area in September 2007 - what a great decision that was! This is a lovely area with a rural feel, gorgeous parklands for the kids (we have a 7 hectare park 200 metres from our door step). There is little to do in Viewbank re nightlife, shopping and eating out but with Heidelberg, Rosanna and I vanhoe minutes away we don't mind (the more peace and tranquility for us!). The schools have a great reputation here and are walking distance from our house (we are in Duff parade). It is very quiet with friendly neighbours and you do feel very safe here (no crime as far as we know). The funny thing is very people know of Viewbank although if real estate prices are anything to go by, those in the know are purchasing wonderful properties and taking advantage of the area and all it has to offer. After living in Preston and Reservoir, we are glad to have left the noise and cramped living for space and nature at its best.\n\nWho lives here?\n\nFamilies with kids\n\nThe opinions expressed within this review are those of the individual and not those of Homely.com.au.\n\nReport\n\n\"Beautiful acres of parkland and very quiet\"\n\nHidden between the yarra river and lower plenty road, Viewbank has kept its country feel - it is very quiet and has large tracts of parkland.
