        "text": "Opinion pieces from local writers exploring their suburb’s cliches and realities and how it has changed in the past 20 years.See all 53 stories .\n\nThe suburb of Viewbank isn’t glamorous. It isn’t trendy. In fact, many people have never heard of it.\n\nAnd for locals, that’s just fine: they’re quite content to have this pocket of Melbourne all to themselves.\n\nIn a good way, surprisingly little has changed during the past 40 years in this oasis nestled on the Yarra and Plenty rivers, about 15 kilometres north-east of Melbourne’s CBD.\n\nHow to describe the vibe of Viewbank? I recently went to Pin Oak Court in Vermont South, in Melbourne’s east, where the external scenes for TV soap Neighbours were shot, and recognised it instantly.\n\nViewbank was just like it, with no doubt its share of real-life domestic dramas behind the facades.\n\nThe suburb is a riot of brown, red or orange-brick houses. Most with two to four bedrooms, albeit many of them extended, rendered or subdivided these days – with patios, barbecues, garages and generous, if not always Insta-worthy, front and backyards, and the odd swimming pool.\n\nViewbank has (gasp!) no cafes. No supermarkets. No giant council recreation centre. At the corner of Martins Lane and Lower Plenty Road, there is a medical centre and a Macca’s, and down the road opposite Viewbank Primary, there is a small convenience store, fish and chip shop, and a hairdresser called Hairport, which is nowhere near an airport.\n\nWhat Viewbank does have is enviable green spaces. Although the creep of suburbia is real, somehow Banyule Flats, parkland stretching from Banyule Road to the Yarra River, and linking eventually to the city and to Templestowe, survives.\n\nLoading\n\nWhen I was a child, the flats were infested with cowpats, blackberry bushes and exotic trees. Sometimes, you’d have to bush-bash a little to go for a walk because the paths were more like goat tracks.\n\nWe’d fish for yabbies, build dodgy rafts to float on the pond, which was more of a tiny swamp. My friend even once decided to walk, water up to her neck, along the creek floor. Just for fun.\n\nWe would let off lethal firecrackers on Guy Fawkes night. I don’t know how we didn’t die from snakebite, wasp stings, tetanus from broken fence cuts, or head injuries from hurtling down the Big Hill on skateboards and bicycles.\n\nThe Flats, off Banyule Road, are now more of a wildlife reserve, albeit with more paths, and attract walking groups, birdwatchers and kangaroos. Overlooking them, atop a pretty escarpment, is the historic Banyule Homestead, which has had nine lives – from a reception centre and galleries to a private home.\n\nLoading\n\nAt the other end of Viewbank, there is more parkland, and access to the Plenty River off the eastern end of Martins Lane. And the seven-hectare Price Park, at the top of a hill along Meyrick Crescent, is still a lovely extensive park with playgrounds, surrounded by houses.\n\nThank God, the government decided to tunnel under Banyule Flats for the frighteningly huge North East Link, and not to bulldoze them, So kids can continue to muck around down the park, although hopefully not as recklessly as we did.\n\nIn our family, we said we lived in Rosanna East, which my friends from Viewbank found funny. Were we snobs? In fairness, we did live on the Rosanna side of Viewbank.\n\nAnd when my parents moved there in 1966, houses in Viewbank – including those on our street – were still being built. Mum would ask friends writing to her to put Rosanna as the suburb on the envelope because no one had heard of Viewbank.\n\nLoading\n\nMost residents were, and still are, hard-working and peace-loving. In my small street lived people of Sri Lankan, Hungarian, Greek, Italian, Welsh, English, Irish, French and Jewish heritage.\n\nOn summer days, kids would be out all day playing in the park or at friends’ places or in the street. Most people knew their neighbours, which isn’t always the case these days.\n\nIt’s a very safe neighbourhood. In the ’70s, the newspapers and nightly TV news were full of crime and mayhem, but it all seemed far away. It still seems that way.\n\nOne of Viewbank’s many charms is that you don’t have to dress up to go shopping, or to take out the garbage.\n\nRosanna, a small shopping village bisected by Lower Plenty Road, is to the west, and it’s where you’ll find an IGA supermarket and can also catch the train, at one of those super-sized new stations. Gone is the familiar jangle of the railway crossing bells.\n\nViewbank itself isn’t flush with facilities, unless you count a secondary college and a primary school, a scout hall, kinders and tennis courts.\n\nThe two-storey brick Viewbank Secondary College has grown much bigger in recent decades and its admittedly vast space is now pocked with portable classrooms.\n\nI recently took some roller-skating classes in the school gym, which eerily had not changed from when I took PE classes at the then-Rosanna East High School in the 1980s.\n\nLoading\n\nAnd the 517 bus still trundles between Greensborough and Northland shopping centres which, like Viewbank, are still quite bogan, unpretentious and down to earth. And amen to that.\n\nAs a child in the 1970s and ’80s, the peacefulness of Viewbank sometimes seemed a negative thing. But now, I know how precious it is to live in a relatively safe, quiet place.\n\nCarolyn Webb is a staff writer.\n\nThe Opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own.
