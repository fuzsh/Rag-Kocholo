Very insightful piece. üìåFor me the key takeaway from Dr. Miao‚Äôs vision of AI competency is ‚ÄúAnd the fostering of human-centred mindset and the ethics of AI are anchored at students‚Äô broad social and emotional skills.‚Äù I truly believe as educators we should stand up more for human-centered AI integration to education and it is us as educators who should lead more talks about the future of education in the AI age- collaborating, working together and following the great minds of AI, engineers and scientists of course. #udl is one way to achive human-centered AI integration to education, besides so many other research-based tools and frameworks such as Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning , blended learning, flipped learning etc. #edtech #technologyineducation #inclusiveeducation UNICEF CAST (Center for Applied Special Technology) Susie Gronseth Beth Stark Loui Lord Nelson, Ph.D. Re≈üit Yalƒ±n G√º√ßkƒ±ran Fatma Y√ºksel Ezgi Aydemir Alta≈ü, PhD Katie Novak, Ed.D.

Day 5 In the rush of teaching, it's easy for educators to forget about their own well-being. Today, we'll explore how teachers can break free from this trap by prioritising moments to breathe, relax, and reset. Strategies for Incorporating Self-Care 1.Mindful Breathing: Take a few moments throughout the day to engage in mindful breathing exercises. Close your eyes, inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This simple practice can help reduce stress and increase focus. 2.Mini Breaks: Schedule short breaks throughout the day to give yourself time to recharge. Whether it's a quick walk around the school, a few minutes of stretching, or simply enjoying a cup of tea, these mini breaks can help alleviate tension and improve productivity. 3 Practice Gratitude: Take time each day to reflect on the things you're grateful for, both big and small. Keeping a gratitude journal can help shift your focus from stressors to the positive aspects of your life, fostering a sense of contentment and resilience. 4.Seek Support: Don't hesitate to reach out to colleagues, friends, or professional counsellors for support when needed. Building a strong support network can provide encouragement, advice, and perspective during challenging times. Afterthought and Conclusion: Dear Educator, As we conclude this series on self-care for teachers, let's remember that taking care of ourselves isn't selfish‚Äîit's essential for being effective educators. By finding time to breathe, relax, and reset, we can escape the trap of neglecting self-care and cultivate a healthier approach to teaching. Let's make self-care a priority, not just for ourselves, but for our students and our profession. May your weekend be filled with rest and rejuvenation!ü•∞\n\n3\n\nA recent evaluation undertaken by CEI shows Australian primary school #teachers value the provision of high-quality pre-prepared teaching materials to boost classroom performance. More than 5,700 teachers in low socio-educational schools were given a year‚Äôs access to an online bank of lesson plans and teacher-ready resources, through the platform Inquisitive, with Federal Government support. CEI investigated teachers‚Äô views on the impact of this access on their own outcomes and wellbeing, on student engagement and in reducing time spent on lesson planning and preparation. ‚ÄúReducing administrative burdens on teachers is an ongoing challenge,‚Äù explains CEI Director Dr Vanessa Rose, who led the evaluation. ‚ÄúHaving high-quality common resources available has been estimated to save a teacher three hours each week. These hours can then be invested in educationally beneficial activities, such as improving teaching practice or developing better ways to support their students.‚Äù Read more: https://lnkd.in/gNnr2CMK #education #teaching #primaryteaching #implementation #evaluation #research #changemakers\n\n12\n\n3 Comments\n\nMulti-Level Tiered Support Systems and Behavior - MTSS and Formula One Comparison Multi-tiered support systems (MTSS) have been increasingly adopted in educational settings to address various student needs, focusing on behavior and academic performance. MTSS is a comprehensive framework incorporating multiple interventions to support all students, including those requiring more intensive assistance. This article explores the foundational principles, effectiveness, and implementation strategies of MTSS in behavioral support, drawing from recent research and systematic reviews. Foundational Principles of MTSS MTSS is built upon several guiding principles that aim to enhance educational outcomes through prevention, behavioral support, and systems support. Sugai, Simonsen, and Freeman (2016) emphasize the importance of capacity development within MTSS, advocating for a proactive approach that focuses on preventing behavioral issues before they escalate. This preventative strategy is complemented by robust behavioral supports and systems that ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the MTSS framework. Formula One - Strategic director Much like the Team Manager, MTSS frameworks require strong oversight and direction to ensure that all aspects of the system are functioning effectively to support student outcomes. #MTSS #MultiTieredSupport #BehaviorSupport #AcademicSupport #Education #BehaviorIntervention #RTI #SWPBS #CapacityDevelopment #EvidenceBasedPractices\n\n8"
