        "text": "2024 Viewbank College Production\n\nViewbank College presents their 2024 Production\n\n'Seussical!'\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nA musical perfect for the whole family, Seussical takes us into the world of Dr. Seuss, where we revisit beloved characters including The Cat in the Hat, Horton the Elephant, Gertrude McFuzz, Lazy Mayzie, and JoJo. The Cat in the Hat guides us into The Jungle of Nool where we see Horton, the kind hearted elephant who discovers a speck of dust containing Whoville. He meets JoJo, a Who child sent to military school for thinking too many “thinks.” Horton decides he must protect the speck of dust on a nearby clover, while at the same time protecting an abandoned egg left to his care by the lazy Mayzie la Bird. Horton tries to convince the other animals in The Jungle of the existence of the Whos, but he is ridiculed and put on trial for insanity. Only his loyal neighbor, Gertrude McFuzz, never loses faith in him. Eventually, the two fall in love. Now one of the most widely produced musicals in the country, Seussical weaves a story of friendship, loyalty, and love. Despite all odds, Horton and Gertrude band together to save the Whos, free Horton, and restore peace and unity to the Jungle of Nool. Charming Seussical teaches us the power of being unique, and the importance of fighting for your beliefs.\n\nDates:\n\nWednesday 31st July, 2024 at 7.30pm\n\nThursday 1st August, 2024 at 7.30pm - there will be an Auslan Interpreter at this performance\n\nFriday 2nd August, 2024 at 7.30pm\n\nSaturday 3rd August, 2024 at 1.00pm\n\nSaturday 3rd August, 2024 at 7.30pm\n\nTicket Prices:\n\nAdults: $30.00\n\nChild/Student/Concession: $20.00\n\nVENUE:\n\nViewbank College Performing Arts Centre\n\n1 Warren Road\n\nViewbank VIC 3084"
