S denotes ‘satisfactory completion’ of the Unit. N denotes that the Unit has ‘not\n\nbeen satisfactorily completed’. NA may be given if results have not been assessed due to circumstances beyond the control of\n\nthe student.\n\nBIOLOGY UNITS 1 &amp; 2\n\nCatherine AING\n\nTeacher: Ms Charis OOI\n\nViewbank College - 2023 - Semester One\n\nIn this unit students examined the cell as the structural and functional unit of life, from the single celled to the multicellular organism, including the\n\nrequirements for sustaining cellular processes. Students focused on cell growth, replacement and death and the role of stem cells in differentiation,\n\nspecialisation and renewal of cells. They explored how systems function through cell specialisation in vascular plants and animals, and considered\n\nthe role that homeostatic mechanisms play in maintaining an animal’s internal environment.\n\nVictorian Certificate of Education (VCE) Outcomes Overall Result NA\n\nOutcome 1: Explain and compare cellular structure and function and analyse the cell cycle and cell growth, death, and differentiation. S\n\nOutcome 2: Explain and compare how cells are specialised and organised in plants and animals and analyse how specific systems in plants\n\nand animals are regulated. NA\n\nOutcome 3: Adapt or design and then conduct a scientific investigation related to function and/or regulation of cells or systems, and draw a\n\nconclusion based on evidence from generated primary data.\n\nS\n\nAssessment Tasks\n\nOutcome 1: Students undertake investigations and tasks relating to the structure and function of cellular structures. 43%\n\nOutcome 2: Students undertake investigations and tasks relating to the relationships between the features and regulation of systems in\n\norganisms NA\n\nOutcome 3: Students design and conduct a scientific investigation related to the function of plants. 68%\n\nLearning Behaviours\n\nStep 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4\n\nTakes responsibility to\n\ncomplete set work on\n\ntime.\n\nDisplays respectful\n\nbehaviour in class.\n\nEngages positively with\n\npeers in learning.\n\nLearns independently.\n\nSeeks assistance and\n\nresponds to feedback.\n\nLITERATURE UNITS 1 &amp; 2\n\nCatherine AING\n\nTeacher: Mrs Stavroula MOUZAKIS\n\nViewbank College - 2023 - Semester One\n\nThe focus of this unit is on the reading of a range of texts, particularly narrative and imaginative texts, in order to comprehend, appreciate and\n\nanalyse the ways in which texts are constructed and interpreted. Students will develop confidence in creating written, oral and multimodal texts. The\n\nset texts will be chosen by the College for the achievement of outcomes.\n\nVictorian Certificate of Education (VCE) Outcomes Overall Result S\n\nOutcome 1: On completion of this unit the student should be able to respond to a range of texts through close analysis. S\n\nOutcome 2: On completion of this unit the student should be able to explore conventions common to a selected movement or genre, and\n\nengage with the ideas, concerns and representations from at least one complete text alongside multiple samples of other texts considered\n\ncharacteristic of the selected movement or genre.\n\nS\n\nAssessment Tasks\n\nOutcome 1: Reading practices 83%\n\nOutcome 2: Exploration of literary movements and genres 79%\n\nLearning Behaviours\n\nStep 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4\n\nTakes responsibility to\n\ncomplete set work on\n\ntime.\n\nDisplays respectful\n\nbehaviour in class.\n\nEngages positively with\n\npeers in learning.\n\nLearns independently.\n\nSeeks assistance and\n\nresponds to feedback.\n\nMATHS METHODS UNITS 1 &amp; 2\n\nCatherine AING\n\nTeacher: Mr Long TRAN\n\nViewbank College - 2023 - Semester One\n\nIn this unit students covered the graphical representation of functions and the key features of graphs of linear, quadratic, cubic, hyperbolic and\n\npower functions. Students applied these functions to a range of contexts with a focus on technology use and interpretation of results. Formal\n\nfunction notation was emphasised along with correct use of terminology. Students explored the behaviour of functions under transformations in the\n\nplane and used parameters to investigate the features of families of functions.\n\nEach assessment task undertaken in this unit encompass two or more VCE outcomes.\n\nVictorian Certificate of Education (VCE) Outcomes Overall Result NA\n\nOutcome 1: define and explain key concepts and apply a range of related mathematical routines and procedures. NA\n\nOutcome 2: select and apply mathematical facts, concepts, models and techniques to investigate and analyse extended application problems\n\nin a range of contexts. NA\n\nOutcome 3: select and use numerical, graphical, symbolic and statistical functionalities of technology to develop mathematical ideas, produce\n\nresults and carry out analysis.\n\nS\n\nAssessment Tasks\n\nFunctions and Relations SAC 9%\n\nPolynomials and Transformations Investigation SAC 30%\n\nLearning Behaviours\n\nStep 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4\n\nTakes responsibility to\n\ncomplete set work on\n\ntime.\n\nDisplays respectful\n\nbehaviour in class.\n\nEngages positively with\n\npeers in learning.\n\nLearns independently.\n\nSeeks assistance and\n\nresponds to feedback.\n\nPSYCHOLOGY UNITS 1 &amp; 2\n\nCatherine AING\n\nTeacher: Miss Chloe TIMMS\n\nViewbank College - 2023 - Semester One\n\nHuman development involves changes in thoughts, feelings and behaviors. In this unit, students investigated the structure and functioning of the\n\nhuman brain and the role it plays in mental processes and behaviour and explored brain plasticity and the influence that brain damage may have on\n\na person’s psychological functioning. They considered the complex nature of psychological development, including situations where psychological\n\ndevelopment may not occur as expected. Students examined the contribution that classical and contemporary knowledge from Western and non-\n\nWestern societies, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, has made to an understanding of psychological development and to the\n\ndevelopment of psychological models and theories used to predict and explain the development of thoughts, emotions and behaviours.\n\nVictorian Certificate of Education (VCE) Outcomes Overall Result NA\n\nOutcome 1: Discuss the complexity of psychological development over the life span and evaluate ways of understanding and representing\n\npsychological development.\n\nS\n\nOutcome 2: Analyse the role of the brain in mental processes and behaviour and evaluate how brain plasticity and brain injury can change\n\nbiopsychosocial functioning.\n\nS\n\nOutcome 3: Identify, analyse and evaluate the evidence available to answer a research question relating to contemporary psychology. NA\n\nAssessment Tasks\n\nOutcome 1: Case studies looking at the complexity of psychological development. 81%\n\nOutcome 2: Media Analysis of media relating to brain structures and function. 66%\n\nOutcome 3: Student directed research investigation.
