        "text": "Personal Statement\n\nHi,\n\nMy name is Chelsea. I am 17 years old and I am from Viewbank College in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nI have always loved my sports and have often made state teams for Softball and Track & Field.\n\nI was always ok at runs and jumps but it was throwing where I found I excelled. It wasn’t until someone put a javelin in my hand that I really started to develop as an athlete.\n\nMy current best competition performances are…\n\n158' 5\" (48.17m) – Javelin 27-Mar-17\n\n107' 11\" (32.90m) – Discus (1kg)\n\nAnd am currently Australian record holder for U14 Javelin (400g) and my State (Victoria) record holder for U15 & U16 Javelin. (500g) I am also currently ranked 4th in Australia in U18 in Javelin.\n\nIn the winter I play Softball for the Melbourne University Open Women Team at Short Stop, 2nd Base and relief Pitcher. The team atmosphere is quite different than Track & Field where it is an individual performance and I really love the comradery of Softball. It does help that we won our championship last season. I also use it as cross training to keep my arm turning over ready for our Summer season.\n\nAcademically I am looking at Psychology as I think mental health is extremely important. Sporting wise, I am currently training towards the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022 and then Olympics 2024\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sanbkiq1u2jkgc4/VicAllSchools2015_U16.mp4?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/javelinoz/"
