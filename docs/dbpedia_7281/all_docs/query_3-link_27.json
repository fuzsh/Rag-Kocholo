        "text": "TRANSITION PROCESS\n\nTransition is a process, not a one-off event, which requires both time and commitment. It is a process of building relationships and understanding, with the aim of supporting students in their transition, identifying barriers to a student’s learning and any adjustments that can be made. All students with additional or complex needs that arise from disability and difficulties in learning require support and/or services at transition points.\n\nGeneral principles underlying successful transitions include:\n\nplanning well in advance of the start of the transition process,\n\nproviding the student and parent/guardian/carer(s) with sufficient information to make an informed choice about future settings, including specialist settings, and\n\neffective collaboration between transition settings that results in sharing of all relevant information\n\nYear 7 Transition\n\nViewbank Primary School aims to provide a smooth, efficient and positive transition from a primary setting to a secondary environment. Year 6 teachers, together with the Wellbeing Coordinator, offer a well planned Transition Program that begins in Term 1 and continues throughout the year. This way, we maintain the sense of belonging that is felt in primary school whilst encouraging and supporting students to continue to develop the skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to become independent learners. Some of the activities the students are involved in include but are not limited to: being responsible to follow timetables themselves to get to classes; visits to the local secondary school, Viewbank College and a transition program during Term 4 tailored to our students to provide them with an idea of what Secondary School life would look like. Viewbank Primary School endeavours to prepare and equip students for the changes that they will encounter as they enter secondary school."
