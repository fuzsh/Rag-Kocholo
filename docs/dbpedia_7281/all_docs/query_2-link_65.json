        "text": "Located 14km north-east of Melbourne's CBD, the tiny suburb in the City of Banyule is defined by hectares of parks and wetlands, including the Yarra Valley Parklands and the Banyule Flats, which is considered the largest grassy woodland in inner Melbourne.\n\nViewbank was settled in 1837 by Edward Willis and named after the homestead built two years later by pastoralist James Williamson at the junction of the Yarra River and Plenty River.\n\nThe remains of Viewbank Homestead, silos still standing on Banyule Road, and Mollison Lodge, a Federation bungalow from the early 20th century, are recognised as having historical and archaeological significance to the state of Victoria.\n\nViewbank was mainly developed around the 1960s and new housing was built during the 1990s and 2000s, at Winston Hills, Casey Crescent and at the end of Martins Lane. At the 2016 census, the postcode had a population of 6,923.\n\nThe family-oriented suburb with a diverse demographic offers a country feel close to the city, according to local property experts, Barry Plant.\n\n“The centrally located area is renowned for its beautiful parks and trails, sporting facilities and highly rated schools,” the Barry Plant agency advised.\n\n“Primed for capital growth with the planned North East Link project, it offers families value for money and an enviable lifestyle.”\n\nViewbank also attracts international buyers wanting to move into the prized schools zone.\n\nIn July 2021, the suburb was considered a high-demand market by realestate.com.au, with 4013 visits per property listing. There were only four properties for rent and 13 properties for sale at the time.\n\nDue to soaring demand, the median house price grew 4.7 per cent to $1.07 million in five years, while the median unit price rose 5.2 per cent to $688,000.\n\nHouses in Viewbank are rented for $520 per week with a yield of 2.5 per cent, while units leased for $398 per week with three per cent yield.\n\nThe area is tightly held and has mainly three to four-bedroom houses spread over a hilly landscape with most being original homes that are well-maintained or renovated with decent-sized backyards.\n\nLocals have eateries and a grocery store at their doorstep on Martins Lane, while Rosanna Village and Lower Plenty shops are nearby. Larger shopping centres in Doncaster, Greensborough, Preston and Ivanhoe are a quick drive away.\n\nA small medical centre with a pharmacy services the area, while Heidelberg’s world-class health precinct, which includes the Austin Hospital and Warringal Private Hospital, is within easy reach.\n\nEducational needs are taken care of with Winston Hills Preschool, Viewbank Primary School and the highly-rated Viewbank College. There are also a choice of childcare services and schools nearby, including Ivanhoe Grammar and Rosanna’s Banyule Primary School, plus Bundoora’s La Trobe University and Heidelberg’s NMIT.\n\nThe serene surroundings are studded with sporting fields, playgrounds, and endless walking and cycling trails, including the Main Yarra Trail to the city.\n\nGolf courses, tennis and netball associations, soccer and pony clubs, plus a scout hall and performing arts centre meet most sports and recreational needs.\n\nWith easy access to freeways, the area is serviced by buses, and train stations in Rosanna, Macleod, Montmorency, Heidelberg, Greensborough and Watsonia."
