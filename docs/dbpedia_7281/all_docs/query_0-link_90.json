        "text": "Core Humanities\n\nThe Year 9 Humanities course integrates the disciplines of History, Geography, Civics & Citizenship, and Economics & Business within an examination of topic-based units. Via these units, students develop their abilities in acquiring, processing, and communicating information from a variety of data sources and via a range of presentation formats. They learn to evaluate patterns and connections within and between societies and places, and across time. Students synthesise information from a range of sources to produce original responses that use appropriate conventions.\n\nTopics across the year may include (but are not limited to):\n\nFast Fashion\n\nFuture Food\n\nRacism – Past and Present\n\nThe Holocaust\n\nHistory\n\nStudents will learn to:\n\nSequence significant events in chronological order to support analysis of the causes and effects of these events and identify the changes they brought about.\n\nAnalyse and corroborate sources and evaluate their accuracy, usefulness and reliability.\n\nIdentify and evaluate patterns of continuity and change in the development of the modern world and Australia.\n\nAnalyse the long-term causes, short-term triggers and the intended and unintended effects of significant events and developments.\n\nEvaluate the historical significance of an event, idea, individual or place.\n\nGeography\n\nStudents will learn to:\n\nIdentify, analyse and explain significant spatial distributions and patterns and identify and evaluate their implications, over time and at different scales\n\nIdentify, analyse and explain significant interconnections within places and between places over time and at different scales, and evaluate the resulting changes and further consequences.\n\nCollect and record relevant geographical data and information, using ethical protocols, from reliable and useful primary and secondary sources.\n\nSelect, organise and represent data and information in different forms, including by constructing special purpose maps that conform to cartographic conventions, using digital and spatial technologies as appropriate.\n\nAnalyse and evaluate data, maps and other geographical information using digital and spatial technologies.\n\nEthical Capabilities\n\nStudents will learn to:\n\nDevelop the knowledge, skills and understandings to analyse and evaluate ethical problems and their resolution, and to identify and manage contestability in ethical matters.\n\nReflect on whether there are ethical concepts and principles common across people, groups and cultures.\n\nA Current Affair\n\nStudents will be introduced to a range of social, cultural, political and environmental issues that are currently making the news. Students will develop their critical thinking and independent research skills by selecting an issue of their choice to investigate in depth. Students will develop a historical context and a geographical context for their issue, as well as examine different perspectives on the issue. Students will also learn how to evaluate the proposed solutions/responses to their issue. Possible issues for investigation include gender inequality, the climate crisis, the rise of religious fundamentalism, terrorism, Australia’s border protection policy, and domestic violence.\n\nHistorical Concepts & Skills\n\nStudents will learn to:\n\nSequence significant events in chronological order to support analysis of the causes and effects of these events and identify the changes they brought about.\n\nAnalyse and corroborate sources and evaluate their accuracy, usefulness and reliability.\n\nAnalyse the different perspectives of people and evaluate how these perspectives are influenced by significant events, ideas, location, beliefs and values.\n\nEvaluate different historical interpretations and contested debates.\n\nAnalyse the long-term causes, short-term triggers and the intended and unintended effects of significant events and developments.\n\nGeographical Concepts & Skills\n\nStudents will learn to:\n\nIdentify, analyse and explain significant spatial distributions and patterns and identify and evaluate their implications, over time and at different scales.\n\nCollect and record relevant geographical data and information, using ethical protocols, from reliable and useful primary and secondary sources.\n\nSelect, organise and represent data and information in different forms, including by constructing special purpose maps that conform to cartographic conventions, using digital and spatial technologies as appropriate.\n\nAnalyse and evaluate data, maps and other geographical information using digital and spatial technologies and Geographical Information Systems as appropriate, to develop identifications, descriptions, explanations and conclusions that use geographical terminology.\n\nCivics & Citizenship\n\nStudents will learn to:\n\nExplain how Australia’s international legal obligations shape Australian law and government policies, including in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n\nAnalyse contemporary examples and issues relating to Australian democracy and global connections, including key aspects of citizenship in a pluralist society.\n\nDiscuss challenges to and ways of sustaining a resilient democracy and cohesive society.\n\nExamine the influence of a range of media, including social media, in shaping identities and attitudes to diversity and how ideas about Australian identity may be influenced by global events.\n\nShould We Save Them?\n\nIn this subject, students will explore issues surrounding endangered species (both fauna and flora) using a range of case studies. Students will develop an understanding of what it means to be endangered, which species are endangered and where, why species are endangered, what or who is the cause and what is being done to stop or reverse the endangerment of species. Students will also develop their critical thinking and independent research skills by selecting their own case studies to investigate. This subject encourages students to not only investigate the issue of endangered species but also the ethics that are involved in saving them and the role that zoos and sanctuaries play in this. Student Voice will also be a big part of this subject with students being able to choose several of their own case studies.\n\nEthical Capabilities\n\nStudents will learn to:\n\nExplore a range of ethical problems and examine the extent to which different positions are related to commonly held ethical concepts and principles, considering the influence of cultural norms, religion, world views and philosophical thought.\n\nDiscuss issues raised by thinking about consequences and duties, in approaches to decision-making and action, and arguments for and against these approaches.\n\nInvestigate how different factors involved in ethical decision-making can be managed by people and groups.\n\nGeographical Concepts & Skills\n\nStudents will learn:\n\nDifferent types and distribution of environmental changes and the forms it takes in different places.\n\nEnvironmental, economic and technological factors that influence environmental change and human responses to its management.\n\nEnvironmental worldviews of people and their implications for environmental management.\n\nStudents will also learn to:\n\nPredict changes in the characteristics of places over time and identify the possible implications of change for the future.\n\nIdentify, analyse and explain significant spatial distributions and patterns and identify and evaluate their implications, over time and at different scales.\n\nCollect and record relevant geographical data and information, using ethical protocols, from reliable and useful primary and secondary sources.\n\nThe Law and You\n\nBuilding on prior knowledge about government and democracy in Australia, students will develop the skills necessary to become active and informed citizens within a parliamentary democracy. Through the lens of a current community issue, students will learn how to enact positive change in society via the processes of effective decision-making and critical thinking. As part of this, students will learn how to effectively voice their opinions in society by developing a creative campaign on their chosen issue. Students will also explore the operation of a range of legal institutions, such as parliament, the courts and the police. Through developing a comprehensive understanding of such institutions, students will be able to recognise how the law applies to everyday people.\n\nCivics & Citizenship – Government and Democracy\n\nStudents will learn to:\n\nDiscuss the freedoms that enable active participation in Australia's democracy within the bounds of the law, including freedom of speech, association, assembly, religion and movement\n\nExplain how citizens can participate in Australia's democracy, including the use of the electoral system, contact with their elected representatives, use of lobby groups, interest groups and direct action\n\nDiscuss the role of political parties and independent representatives in Australia’s system of government, including the formation of governments, and explain the process through which government policy is shaped and developed\n\nAnalyse how citizens’ political choices are shaped, including the influence of the media\n\nCivics & Citizenship – Laws and Citizens\n\nStudents will learn to:"
