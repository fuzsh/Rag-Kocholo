        "text": "This listing of studies by school is based on which studies are actually taught by a school. Many schools, however, increase the range of studies available to students by sharing arrangements with other schools or providers; so students can enrol in studies at other schools or providers, such as Virtual School Victoria or the Victorian School of Languages (VSL). Details of these arrangements can be obtained from individual schools.\n\nThe schools and studies information is current as of 4 June 2024. Studies offered by schools will vary from year to year. Please contact the school for further details to ensure you have the latest information.\n\nFor information on VCAA-approved VET programs (VE1s), please refer to the VCE VET program page. For information on school-based or part-time apprenticeships and traineeships (VE2s), please refer to the School-based apprenticeships and traineeships page. For information on other VET qualifications or high-level VET qualifications (VE3s), please refer to the Other VET qualifications page."
