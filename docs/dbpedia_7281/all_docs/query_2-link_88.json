        "text": "A look of disappointment swept across Andrew Vassett's face as his VCE results flashed up on the computer screen.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know how I feel about that,\" the former Viewbank College student muttered through his fingers.\n\nThat was exactly one year ago.\n\nAs the class of 2016 nervously wait for their VCE results to be released next Monday, we caught up with last year's year 12 students to see how their lives were panning out.\n\nThey have all come to the same realisation – their ATAR didn't matter that much.\n\n\"The ATAR at one stage seems extremely important but it is pretty meaningless in the end,\" Andrew said.\n\nWhile the 18-year-old may have initially been disappointed with his ranking (an impressive 93.6), he was still accepted into the course of his choice, arts at the University of Melbourne.\n\n\"I put in a lot of work and looking back at it now, I'm happy with how I went.\"\n\nHe said that the VCE had prepared him for the challenges of university, and exams were no longer daunting. \"I've realised that if I put in the work, then there's no point in stressing.\"\n\nFormer Presbyterian Ladies' College student Ashlyn Field still remembers the incredible feeling that washed over her as she flung her pen on the desk after her last exam.\n\n\"It felt so amazing,\" she said. \"I felt free ... to do anything I wanted without feeling guilty for watching TV when you should be studying.\"\n\nShe says her ATAR was an important reflection of her hard work during the VCE, but was \"irrelevant\" now.\n\nThe 19-year-old is studying medicine at Monash University, a degree where selection is based on a student's ATAR, and their performance in the Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admission Test and interviews.\n\nShe is still good friends with her former classmate Rebecca Subbiah, who is also at Monash, studying commerce.\n\nRebecca has a word of advice for students waiting for their results – relax.\n\n\"There's not a lot you can do now,\" she said. \"Take a deep breath, take it as it comes, and don't be disappointed [with] whatever you get. There are so many opportunities.\"\n\nStephen Zhang was dubbed the \"home school hero\" last year after achieving a perfect score of 99.95 via distance education.\n\nThese days, he's studying a bachelor of science at the University of Melbourne. He is unsure about what he wants to do next, but is considering biomedical research or medicine.\n\nDoes he have any regrets with how he handled the VCE?\n\n\"I might have wanted to pick up Chinese as a VCE subject instead of physics,\" he said.\n\nMatthew Bunney, who is also studying a bachelor of science at the University of Melbourne, says he wished he had enjoyed more social events during year 12.\n\nBut the Elizabeth Blackburn School of Science graduate says he has more time on his hands now. And no one asks him about his ATAR at university.\n\n\"You don't tell people. It is one number on one day,\" he said.\n\nClaire Brown, the associate director of Victoria University's Victoria Institute, said many universities were moving away from using ATARs during their selection process. \"The ATAR is reflecting a world that was, not the world we are moving into,\" she said.\n\nShe said that if Australia wanted to become a knowledge economy, more people with lower ATARs would need to access tertiary education.\n\n\"It is even more important that we focus on the potential and calibre of the students during their course of study, and the value that the institution adds.\"\n\nPlease share your #VCE moment.
