        "text": "Parents paying the costs of state school budget cuts as voluntary fees rise\n\nState schools charge parents to secure a place for their children\n\nState school parents are waving goodbye to the concept of a \"free\" public school education.\n\nBooks, uniforms and camps are among the items they are expected to pay for, and the cost is rising each year.\n\nA document leaked to Fairfax Media reveals the list of \"essential items\" Viewbank College is charging parents for next year.\n\nItems on the list included the school's SMS parent notification service, wellbeing and diversity programs, a homework club and the Year 12 magazine.\n\nAccording to the education department's guidelines, state schools can charge parents directly for items such as text books, uniforms, camps and transport.\n\nBut extra-curricular programs, school magazines and school facilities and equipment should remain \"optional\" payments, with these items supplied on a user-pay basis.\n\nSonja Terpstra has a student at the school and said the department's policy on parent payments was too broad, allowing state schools to evade scrutiny.\n\n\"There needs to be clearer communication around what can be charged and what can't. When you seek advice from the department on these payments, you don't get any clarity,\" she said.\n\nAfter receiving a call from Fairfax Media, the school removed seven of the items from the list and rendered them voluntary payments.\n\nThis is despite charging parents for most of the items last year.\n\nViewbank College principal Judith Craze said the school gave parents an itemised breakdown of their payments at the end of each year.\n\nShe said no student would miss out if parents could not afford the payments.\n\n\"No student has ever been denied any of the items on the list, we are a very inclusive school,\" she said.\n\nMs Craze said it was impossible for the school to offer a high-quality learning program without parent payments.\n\n\"A school like ours, which offers a very broad program, could not operate without those payments.\"\n\nParents Victoria executive officer Gail McHardy said chronic underfunding in the sector meant schools relied on parents to cover some costs.\n\n\"The onus should not be on the schools to make up the shortfall in funding, and that cost should not be imposed on families,\" she said. \"The government needs to know how much it costs to deliver a program in the 21st century and it needs to fund accordingly.\"\n\nVictorian parents pay an average of $558 a child in fees.\n\nA 2015 Victorian auditor-general report into the cost of state education revealed there was a \"lack of transparency\" surrounding parent payments.\n\nThe report found the education department had failed to ensure it had the \"checks and balances in place\" to supervise school practices.\n\nAn education department spokesman said: \"The department is working with Viewbank College to revise its policy to ensure parents can clearly understand what they are being asked to pay for under the essential items, optional and voluntary contributions categories, and that this is compliant with Department policy.\"\n\nEducation Minister James Merlino requested that the department undertake a full independent review of its parent payment policies earlier this year, including how the application of these policies are monitored across the system.\n\nThe findings of the review are due to be released in December."
