        "text": "​​​We upgraded the school. This major modernisation project included constructing a two-storey performing arts centre that provides the school with a theatre, as well as music and drama teaching facilities. We also upgraded science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) learning areas.​​\n\nWe refurbished the student toilets in the canteen and Block A, and made minor repairs to windows in Block G toilets, to improve amenity, cleanliness and hygiene. This work was supported by our Minor Capital Works Fund – a program for small building projects that make a big difference in our schools."
