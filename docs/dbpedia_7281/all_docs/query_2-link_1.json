Particular attention will be paid to the safety of international students from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds.\n\n维克班中学国际留学生项目手册（中文简体）(Mandarin)\n\n維克班中學國際留學生項目手冊 (中文繁體) (Cantonese)\n\nViewbank College International Student Program Brochure (English)\n\nTRƯỜNG TRUNG HỌC VIEWBANK Chương trình Học sinh Quốc tếTiếng Việt）(Vietnamese)\n\nวิทยาลัย VIEWBANK หลักสูตรนักเรียนนานาชาติ （แบบไทย）(Thai)\n\nStudying in Victoria\n\nVictorian government schools are a destination of choice for international students. Our schools provide international students with a high-quality education, excellent English language tuition, caring welfare support services, secure homestay, and pathways to higher education. To learn more about studying and living in Victoria as an international student, see: www.study.vic.gov.au\n\nAbout our School\n\nViewbank College is a co-educational government secondary college approximately 17 kilometres from the Melbourne city centre. Located close to a range of native flora and fauna reserves with attractive school grounds, the college is close to Latrobe University, shopping centres, banking, medical and entertainment amenities. The school is serviced by regular train lines and bus routes with easy access to Melbourne.\n\nOur College has excellent facilities including home rooms for Year 7 classes, state of the art ICT network and quality support for the 1:1 laptop program. Viewbank College has recently completed a major building project – a flexible performing arts centre which has both music and drama facilities for classroom teaching, as well as new mathematics classrooms and a total new fit-out of the mathematics/science area and the arts area which encompasses a “maker’s space” for our STEAM program. Viewbank also has outstanding facilities, including the Banyule Theatre and an impressive oval, basketball courts and soccer field, which enhance the opportunities for students to perform at their best.\n\nViewbank College welcomes Years 7-12 international students from across the world. At our College, we are proud of our International Student Program. Our international students contribute a great deal to the multicultural diversity we enjoy. In recent years we have hosted international students from China, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India, and South America. Families select our College for its academic standards and its reputation.\n\nViewbank College has a number of extra-curricular activities that assist international students to fit into a different culture and education system, as well as building up supportive relationships with both teachers and students.\n\nTo learn more about the types of subjects and supports available for international students, see: Viewbank College\n\nTo chat with our school ambassadors, see: chat with the international student coordinator Summer Guo\n\nHow to apply\n\nMost international students must apply to the Department of Education in order to study in a Victorian government school. To learn about the application types and to apply, see: How to apply\n\nWe do have a small Homestay Program, but students under 15 years of age will only be considered if they live with a parent or a DHA approved relative.\n\nPlease note: A telephone or video interview may be conducted by our International Student Coordinator upon receiving the application.\n\nClasses for International Students at Viewbank College are conducted face to face, unless circumstances beyond our control require online learning. Year 10 students participate in Work Experience for one week during Term 2. All students complete online workplace training instruction to assist them with workplace health and safety. Their placement is closely supervised, and staff visit their work placement to check their progress.\n\nEnglish Language Support\n\nPrior to entering mainstream classes, students, where required, can study an Intensive English Language course at an English Language centre located 4 kilometres from Viewbank College.\n\nYears 7-9\n\nOur International Students join mainstream classes for all their studies. We have found this the best way to help them quickly improve their English and to become part of the Viewbank College community. However, students receive an additional 3 lessons per week of EAL (English as an Additional Language), where they work in small groups. Here they can work on developing their language skills and they can be assisted with classwork.\n\nYear 7 & 8 Handbook\n\nYear 9 Handbook\n\nYears 10-12\n\nFrom 2021, there are separate EAL English classes at Years 10, 11 and 12. In these small classes, senior students are able to develop their English language skills to a higher level.\n\nThere are also homework sessions run by teachers after school. Students can attend these sessions for help with their work in English, Humanities, Maths and Science subjects.\n\nSenior School Handbook\n\nOther Language Studies\n\nWe offer Japanese and German at Viewbank College, but students have the opportunity to study their first language as part of their VCE course. They can choose to enrol at the Victorian School of Languages (VSL) – www.vsl.vic.edu.au\n\nOr we may approve study with a registered third-party provider. These classes are held outside of normal school hours.\n\nAssessment & Reports\n\nAll International students will receive an Interim report, a Mid-year report and an End of year report. Student/Parent/Teacher conferences are held twice a year over two days, to allow parents and guardians of students to attend interviews in person with teachers. Interviews can be booked online via Compass. Assessment methods are outlined in the school handbook for all year levels.\n\nSpecial Programs to note:\n\nAccess to a range of STEAM programs\n\nExtension opportunities in Mathematics and Science\n\nExtensive instrumental music program\n\nICT and media studies\n\nJapanese and German languages\n\nStrong English as an Additional Language support Program\n\nHomework clubs in Mathematics/Science and English/Humanities\n\nStudent leadership program\n\nPastoral care and student counselling support\n\nCollege Nurse\n\nWork Experience Program\n\nWell-developed Respectful Relationships Program\n\nExtracurricular activities include:\n\nMusical instrument tuition and performance\n\nCollege production and drama performances\n\nSporting Program\n\nDebating and public speaking\n\nVaried Lunchtime Activities program\n\nG’Day USA overseas trip\n\nSister school exchange trips to Germany and Japan\n\nPre Departure\n\nAll students and families are provided with a number of essential documents which outline the school policies, cost of books and uniforms, and information about living in Australia prior to arrival in Australia. It also allows communication to take place between the student and the International Student Coordinator prior to departure.\n\nTo learn more about important information before you arrive, read the Pre-departure and Homestay guide available in English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Khmer.\n\nAirport Pickup\n\nAll students who require airport pickup will be met by a staff member from the International Student Program and taken to their homestay.\n\nOrientation Program\n\nWe have an orientation session for all students as soon as they arrive. We will provide them with a package including guidelines and school rules, procedures, etc. Details about Australia, its customs and culture, the local area, and the school community are also incorporated.\n\nHomestay Accommodation\n\nWe have a number of families offering homestay to students who have applied to come here without family. Generally, we would expect students to remain in homestay until the end of their course at Viewbank College. Homestay providers are selected carefully and go through an application process. All homestays are monitored closely and visited regularly by the International Student Coordinator and International Student Coordinator Assistant. A Homestay Responsibility Agreement is signed by both the homestay provider and the student to ensure each party is fulfilling their responsibilities. We have strict homestay regulations to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nFamilies who might be interested in providing homestay for a student can email the International Student Coordinator, Summer Guo or the Assistant Keah Mizzi.\n\nTo learn more about staying with a homestay family in a Victorian government school, see:\n\nHomestays\n\nHomestay Provider Policy Information\n\nHomestay Provider Enquiry Form\n\nSome Useful Links\n\nLiving in Australia – Cultural Information\n\nComplaints and Appeals Procedures\n\nCost of Living –www.study.vic.gov.au – (Cost of living tab)\n\nEmergency and Healthcare Services: – www.study.vic.gov.au/en/living-in-victoria/health-and-safety/Pages/default.aspx (tabs for Safety Health and Emergencies)\n\nInformation about Melbourne – http://whatson.melbourne.vic.gov.au\n\nLocality – Services Information: www.banyule.vic.gov.au – translations available\n\nPublic Transport – www.viewbank.vic.edu.au (enrolment tab/transport)\n\nWellbeing: www.viewbank.vic.edu.au ( student learning tab/wellbeing resources)\n\nStudent Health and Support Line available 24/7: Telephone : 1800 887 283 with interpreters\n\nInformation relating to Viewbank College:"
