        "text": "Co-educational, secondary, day school in Viewbank, Victoria, Australia\n\nViewbank College is a public secondary school located in the north eastern suburb of Viewbank, in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nViewbank College was founded on the site of Rosanna East High School in 1994, the result of a merger between it and Banyule High School.[1][2]\n\nThe two original schools serviced the surrounding area, predominantly enrolling students situated in the City of Heidelberg (now known as the City of Banyule). Banyule High School commenced in 1961 and by 1970 its student population had swelled to over 900. As a result, Rosanna East High School was started in 1970 to reduce the pressure on Banyule High School. It began operating in the grounds of Rosanna Golf Links Primary School but the following year, with the completion of the construction of new buildings at the Warren Road site, the school moved to its permanent location in Viewbank.[1] With decreasing enrolments in both schools, in 1993 talks were held in consideration of a merger. By January 1994, Viewbank College as a school had begun. On 6 November 1996, an official opening was conducted by the Honourable Richard McGarvie, the Governor of Victoria at the time.\n\nThe school continues to operate from the Warren Road site and retains ownership over the Banyule Theatre (previously part of Banyule High School)[2] with the remaining land sold off for residential development. The school is predicted to have more than 2,000 students by 2022. The theatre is now used for teaching and performance.[2]\n\nIn 2019, sketch Comedy group Aunty Donna filmed a 16-part webseries entitled Glennridge Secondary College at Viewbank College, with funding and support from Screen Australia. It was released on YouTube weekly from 20 February 2019.\n\nProgram\n\n[edit]\n\nAs well as offering students diverse learning challenges in the classroom, students have opportunities to develop and explore their talents through the Enhanced Acceleration Program, the debating Program, the music and drama programs and the extensive Sports Programs. Students are actively encouraged through the strong Student Leadership program to become involved in the greater life of the college.\n\nThe college encourages parent involvement through the College Council, Friends of Music, Friends of Viewbank and Friends of the Performing and Visual Arts.\n\nViewbank has an association with Narita Kokusai High School in Japan.[4]\n\nPerforming Arts\n\n[edit]\n\nIn recent years Viewbank College has become renowned in the local area for their Musical Productions. Each year over 120 students are involved in all aspects of the shows, including but not limited to Cast, Stage Crew, Audio Crew, Lighting Crew, Art Crew,[5] Orchestra, Makeup Crew and Front of House. The shows are generally \"Big Broadway Musicals\" attracting over 1400 ticket sales over 6 shows. Productions are held in July/August each year and were held at the college's Banyule Theatre until 2017.\n\nIn the 2015â€“16 State Budget, $11.5 million was allocated to the school to build a dedicated 400 seat Theatre and adjoining Performing Arts Facilities. Completion of the Arts Centre was in 2018. The project was managed by the Victorian School Building Authority.[6] It now hosts the College Production each year as well as many more College events. The theater is also hired out regularly for external events.\n\nYear Production 1994 Man of La Mancha 1995 Sweeney Todd 1996 Son of Phantom 1997 The Pirates of Penzance 1998 Annie Get Your Gun 1999 Bye Bye Birdie 2000 Mid Summer Nights Dream 2001 Lola Montez 2002 The Scarlet Pimpernel 2003 Guys And Dolls 2004 Little Shop of Horrors 2005 Anything Goes 2006 Annie 2007 Crazy For You 2008 Grimm Tales 2009 Oliver 2010 Hot Mikado 2011 Oklahoma 2012 Hello Dolly 2013 How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying 2014 Hairspray 2015 The Producers 2016 The Addams Family 2017 All Shook Up 2018 Singin' In The Rain 2019 Back To The 80's 2020 Grease (Cancelled due to COVID-19) 2021 Chicago (High School Edition) 2022 We Will Rock You 2023 Legally Blonde 2024 Seussical\n\nYear Middle School Production 2007 A Snow White Tale 2008 Charlie & The Chocolate Factory 2009 The Wizard Of Oz (Did Not Occur) 2010 Alice In Wonderland 2011 The Wind In The Willows 2012 Twinderella 2013 Rapunzel: A Twisted Tale 2014 Attack Of The Zombies 2015 Robin Hood 2016 Law and Order- Nursery Rhyme Unit 2017 Super Useless 2018 Space Play 2019 End Of The Line 2020 Program did not run due to COVID-19 2021 Viewbank Variety Show 2022 Game On 2023 Cola 2024 Once upon a Crime\n\nViewbank College also offers an extensive musical education program featuring many instruments and also voice lessons.
