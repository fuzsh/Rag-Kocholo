I am looking for properties in Viewbank primary and Viewbank College/Vermont Primary and Vermont Secondary zones. I would love to get 4 bed 2 bath but might have to settle down with 3 bed 1 bath as I am on a tight budget 1 mil. Which suburb would suit the best and where is the likelihood of finding a house. I am currently in renting in Doncaster East. Finally what will be the impact of North East Link on Viewbank and which suburb, will have a greater growth.Our jobs are in Box Hill and Doncaster East, currently renting in Doncaster East.\n\nUnfortunately you wonâ€™t get a decent house in either suburb for less than 1.2-1.3m at least. Maybe 1.1 few months ago. Some parts of yallambie are zoned for Viewbank, but keep in mind zoning can change\n\n8 Corbie Way, Yallambie, Vic 3085\n\nhttps://www.realestate.com.au/sold/property-house-vic-yallambie-140256631\n\nMost areas in NE will benefit from NE link unless of course the tunnels under it."
