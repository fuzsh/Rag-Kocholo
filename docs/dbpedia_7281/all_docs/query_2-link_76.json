        "text": "Minister for Education James Merlino and Member for Ivanhoe Anthony Carbines today visited local schools to tour facilities, meet staff and students, and discuss priorities including the ongoing school provision review.\n\nA review into school provision in Banyule is now moving to the next stage, where it will look at how best to meet the education needs of the area.\n\nMr Merlino and Mr Carbines today visited Ivanhoe Primary School, in Ivanhoe, Charles La Trobe P–12 College, in Macleod West, and Viewbank College, in Rosanna, to talk with staff and students firsthand about the Banyule school provision review.\n\nStage One of the independent review took place last year and examined primary and secondary school needs across Banyule, including in Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe East, Heidelberg, Heidelberg Heights, Heidelberg West, Rosanna, Macleod and Bellfield.\n\nIt found that between now and 2031 there is likely to be a surplus of government primary and secondary school places across the study area. However, it also found that issues exist – such as transport, accessibility and the location and configuration of schools – that limit the effectiveness of the school network to meet need.\n\nStage Two of the Banyule school provision review will involve further consultation with the community and key stakeholders.\n\nThe review delivers on the Andrews Labor Government’s commitment to undertake a school provision review in postcodes areas of 3081 and 3079.\n\nIvanhoe Primary will also benefit from a boost to its equity funding this year, receiving $12,083 in 2016 year compared to nothing in 2015. Charles La Trobe P–12 College will benefit from equity funding of $1,600,375 this year, a boost of $401,176 compared to 2015. Viewbank College will receive boosted equity funding of $71,344 this year, up from nothing in 2015.\n\nThis increase is part of the Labor Government’s Education State commitment to provide an extra $566 million to help schools and students most in need to break the cycle of disadvantage.\n\nQuotes attributable to Minister for Education James Merlino\n\n“We are making Victoria the Education State by ensuring that every community has access to great schools, our teachers and principals are supported to be their best, and every student has the chance to succeed in learning and in life.”\n\nQuote attributable to Member for Ivanhoe Anthony Carbines\n\n“Together, the Andrews Labor Government and our community are putting the long term needs of our students first. I look forward to working together on stage two of the review which will identify priorities for future investment in our schools and students.”"
