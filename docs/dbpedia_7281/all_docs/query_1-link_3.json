        "text": "Vision\n\nViewbank College is a dynamic learning community, with a focus providing high quality educational opportunities that develop the potential of all its students. Our learning environment is caring and prioritises the personal and academic growth of all students.\n\nWe build active partnerships between staff, students and parents. We value a sense of individual worth and achievement, building curious, adaptable, resilient and ethical members of the community.\n\nValues\n\nViewbank College is a lead school in promoting Respectful Relationships.\n\nAt the heart of our community, our College Pledge underpins the way we relate to each other on a daily basis.\n\nHistory of Viewbank College\n\nViewbank College was formed in 1994 as a result of a merge between Banyule High School and Rosanna East High School. Both schools had a long tradition of offering an excellent education to students from Heidelberg, Rosanna and the surrounding areas. Banyule High School commenced in 1961 and by 1970 it had a population of over 900 students; it was then decided that a new high school was needed in the area. Rosanna East High School started in 1970 in the grounds of Rosanna Golf Links Primary School and moved to new buildings at the Warren Road site in 1971.\n\nOur Logo\n\nThe Viewbank College logo is a representation of our geographical location on a hillside overlooking the Banyule Wetlands and the valley of the Yarra River. Its circular shape is symbolic of the global village and is depicted in Australian ochre tones. It was designed in response to a 1993 competition to celebrate the amalgamation of Rosanna East High School and Banyule High School – the layering of the two schools colours is evident in the horizontal interleafing of maroon and gold."
