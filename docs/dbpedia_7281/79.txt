History of Viewbank College

Viewbank College was formed in 1994 as a result of a merge between Banyule High School and Rosanna East High School. Both schools had a long tradition of offering an excellent education to students from Heidelberg, Rosanna and the surrounding areas. Banyule High School commenced in 1961 and by 1970 it had a population of over 900 students; it was then decided that a new high school was needed in the area. Rosanna East High School started in 1970 in the grounds of Rosanna Golf Links Primary School and moved to new buildings at the Warren Road site in 1971.

Our Logo

The Viewbank College logo is a representation of our geographical location on a hillside overlooking the Banyule Wetlands and the valley of the Yarra River. Its circular shape is symbolic of the global village and is depicted in Australian ochre tones. It was designed in response to a 1993 competition to celebrate the amalgamation of Rosanna East High School and Banyule High School â€“ the layering of the two schools colours is evident in the horizontal interleafing of maroon and gold.
