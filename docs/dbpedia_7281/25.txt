The Performing Arts & Technology Centre is a lighthouse facility for Viewbank College. A high achieving public secondary school in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Viewbank College has a strong performing arts legacy and required a facility that could both showcase their young talent and provide multiple flexible spaces for teaching & learning.

Located on a tight footprint of available land, the PAC creates a connected atrium to the technology centre, allowing for the co-location of arts & science into a single precinct. The facility includes:

• Music & Drama Department

• 350 seat theatre and backstage

• Foyer & associated amenities

• General purpose classrooms

• Materials Technology classroom

• Refurbishment of Art, Textiles, Vis Comm & Science spaces.

The theatre has been designed for maximum flexibility, and caters to the following configurations such that it can be timetabled to capacity throughout the school day:

• 350 seat theatre, stalls & balcony, stage, extended stage (orchestra) and bio box

• Back-of-house (greenroom) spaces utilize the Music & Drama classrooms with additional storage, lighting & makeup facilities

• 230 seat seminar space (balcony) that can be closed off from a 120 seat studio performance space (stalls) and run concurrently

• Conference centre or exam centre combining the stalls & foyer to allow for 150 seated guests
