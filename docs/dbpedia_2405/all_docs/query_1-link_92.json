        "text": "Two Keith Hollingsworth Masonic Scholarships, each valued at $500, were presented to two Year 10 students from Ringwood Secondary College on Tuesday 12 July.\n\nThe scholarships, awarded to Lily Hualngo and Lachlan Griffith, were presented by Mrs Iris Hollingsworth, the widow of the late Keith Hollingsworth.\n\nFunded by the Maroondah Daylight Lodge No. 607 and the Freemasons Foundation, the scholarships are intended to assist in providing further educational opportunities to the recipients.\n\nLily Hualngo has made the most of her opportunities at the college since coming from a refugee background, has shown a high level of dedication and enthusiasm towards her studies, and her friendly approach has assisted students with a similar background to embrace the many challenges of starting school in a new country.\n\nLachlan Griffith began in 2016 with a renewed passion. He regularly shows new students around the school and helps them get settled at the college, has a great attitude, focus and determination towards his studies and a high awareness of collective responsibility, upholding the values of the college.\n\nThe scholarships are named after Keith Hollingsworth who was the Foundation Master of Maroondah Daylight Lodge. He was greatly respected in Masonic circles, particularly in the field of research. Keith had an extensive history in education and at the time was the youngest person to be appointed to the position of school principal. He later became involved in education in the Ringwood area having set up the Ringwood Coaching College which operated successfully for many years. Because of this connection, the scholarships were directed to Ringwood Secondary College."
