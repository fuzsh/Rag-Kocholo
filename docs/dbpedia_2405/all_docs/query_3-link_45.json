        "text": "When I walked into All Things Considered, Richard Gaines’ art show at Montclair’s adventurous BrassWorks Gallery, I stopped in my tracks. There was a black leather head with needles stuck in it, and more heads like it in different colors with different means of torture: nails, spikes, shells. His work did what he wanted it to: it made me stop, look and think. He calls these pieces Headgear, and Spike Lee owns one of them.\n\nThe gallery was filled with arresting images: portraits made from wood chips, mirrors draped with frayed rope, scrap wood in the shape of a tree, and small brown faces crammed into buckets. The Bravitas Group owns several distinctive properties in New Jersey and uses its hallways and free spaces for artists to show their work pro bono. They encouraged Gaines to go for it with this show.\n\n“Wood chips, glass, gravel, scrap metal, etc.; these materials I find in my wandering through the streets of my neighborhood,” he says. Rope is another frequent element in his work with its disturbing echoes of black history. When he frays it, it can represent all kinds of hair.\n\nWhen I visited his home studio in Montclair, he proudly showed me a mahogany door he had just found. What he doesn’t find in his travels, he buys at American Royal Hardware in Montclair where they know him well.\n\nAt 6-feet, 6-inches tall, Gaines is a serious artist with a deep voice and a hearty laugh.\n\nHe and his sister Dana were born in Newark and the socially conscious family moved to Montclair in the late 1960s. His mother, Marie, was an administrator in the Newark School System and his father, Richard Sr., had been a professional basketball player who became an educator. With his height, it was assumed by some that Gaines would also play basketball. “No, you do you,” his dad said. The family loved Broadway theater and one of Richard’s early influences was the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld. Gaines went to Montclair High School, a great school, but he often played hooky and took the bus to New York City where he took in the atmosphere of Washington Square Park.\n\nHe heard about Portfolio Day at the Pratt Institute and with no formal training put together a presentation in two days. It got him accepted at four art schools and he chose the School of Visual Arts, where he hung out with Keith Haring and moved to Manhattan. After graduation, he needed a job and through his mother he became a teacher. He eventually took a job he loved at the Regional Day School in Newark, where he worked with children with autism and spearheaded a program between the Newark School System and the Montclair Art Museum. He didn’t make art for 30 years.\n\nGaines retired from the Regional Day School in 2017, started making art again and moved back to Montclair in 2020 just as the pandemic took hold. When George Floyd was murdered, “The knee on the neck” and all the images he saw on CNN angered and inspired him. Homebound, he poured himself into his work using all of his history and pent-up artistic energy to make art about society’s impact on Black men. His grandfather was killed by white men on his way home from work and his body was thrown onto train tracks, he said.\n\nWith his keen eye, his skill, his history and big heart, Richard Gaines’ art connects the dots between our troubled past, our volatile present and what he hopes, we hope, is a brighter future.\n\nFor more about Gaines, visit www.richardgaines.com\n\nFor more information about Bravitas, visit www.bravitas.com"
