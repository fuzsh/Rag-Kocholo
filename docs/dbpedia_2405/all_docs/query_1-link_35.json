        "text": "Hollywood star Jack Black has responded to a heartfelt plea from students from Ringwood Secondary College in Melbourne to visit their production of School of Rock, based on the actor's 2003 film.\n\nThe students began campaigning after they realised Black would be in town touring with his band Tenacious D.\n\nRingwood Secondary College teacher and director of the production Lauren Rowe told ABC Radio Melbourne that it was not an impossible dream, as Black was known for his spontaneous interactions with fans.\n\n\"I hope he'll see … and want to come and see the kids and support them because they're so excited about it,\" she said.\n\nIn the video message to the rockstar the students could be heard chanting:\n\n\"Oh lord of rock Jack Black, please grace us with your mighty love.\"\n\nToo busy rocking\n\nThe Tenacious D frontman responded to the plea overnight, saying that while he wished he could attend the production, he would be busy with touring commitments.\n\n\"Ringwood Secondary College, are you kidding me? You're doing School of Rock? I love it — so touched,\" Black said in the response.\n\n\"And I wish I could come see it, but unfortunately I'm going to be rocking!\" He said.\n\nThe actor said that although it had been 20 years since the film was released, it was still his \"favourite movie\" he had ever made.\n\nBlack went on to impart some final words of wisdom on the students:"
