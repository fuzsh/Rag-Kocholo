        "text": "Lighthouse Edition 12 - 2024\n\nOne Spirit (of the Olympics) It’s almost impossible to miss that we are in the middle of the Olympics, particularly given the great start Australian athletes made in the first few days. One of the most enduring successes has been the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay team, with last Sunday’s Gold medal the fourth Olympics in a row for this team. Importantly, it has been a different combination of women each time, highlighting the strength of culture and tradition in both the relay team and wider swimming team.\n\nLighthouse Edition 11 - 2024\n\nWhat a delight it was to be able to join students in each of their Activities Week events across the final week of Term 2. Not only were they exposed to wonderful learning and community-building events, as I joined them I also had a number of ‘first-time’ experiences. For some reason, students seemed eager for me to try anything involving heights or controlled risk - including the ‘Edge’ experience with Year 9 and Axe-throwing with Year 11 - perhaps ensuring I’ve taken to heart the advice I’ve provided about stepping out of one’s comfort zone.\n\nProspective Staff Information Evening\n\nTeachers, are you thinking about making a change in 2025? Come along and find out what makes Aquinas College such a wonderful community to belong to and find out the future career growth you could experience with us."
