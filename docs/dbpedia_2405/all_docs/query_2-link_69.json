Each PPCC is partnered with a busy emergency department.\n\nPPCCs see people with low acuity conditions such as fractures, burns and mild infections.\n\nThe centres are open after hours (up to 16 hours a day, seven days a week), and have diagnostics on site or nearby.\n\nPPCCs are being delivered in partnership with the six Victorian Primary Health Networks (PHNs). This includes collaboration on clinical resources to support high quality, safe and consistent services and communication resources to promote the new services to the Victorian community."
