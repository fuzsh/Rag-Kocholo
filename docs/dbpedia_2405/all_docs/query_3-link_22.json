        "text": "Illuminare #2 2024\n\nWhen we gather at reunions, one of the common questions is \"Where are you now?\" This edition we explore where many of our alumni are and what they now do. It is amazing to see the variety and opportunities explored by so many. We hope there is someone from your year that you can connect with in this edition.\n\nLighthouse Edition 13 - 2024\n\nYesterday was the Feast of the Assumption, which marks the conclusion of Mary’s life of service on earth. As mother of Jesus - and mother of our church - Mary was present as witness at the key moments in Christ’s life, from his birth, to prompting his entry in public ministry at Cana, and at the foot of the cross. She did not - and could not - know the fullness of God’s mission in bearing and raising Jesus, responding to the call: “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” (Luke 1:38).\n\nLighthouse Edition 12 - 2024\n\nOne Spirit (of the Olympics) It’s almost impossible to miss that we are in the middle of the Olympics, particularly given the great start Australian athletes made in the first few days. One of the most enduring successes has been the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay team, with last Sunday’s Gold medal the fourth Olympics in a row for this team. Importantly, it has been a different combination of women each time, highlighting the strength of culture and tradition in both the relay team and wider swimming team."
