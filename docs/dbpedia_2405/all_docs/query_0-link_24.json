        "text": "CSEF Applications\n\nThe CSEF (Camps Sports and Excursions Fund) applications are now being processed for 2021. If you have already applied at the College last year, it will automatically be done for you. You do no need to do anything, no further action is required.\n\nIf you are now an eligible Centrelink Health Care Card holder and/or new to the College and have not completed the application, please do so and return to the College before Monday 15th March 2021.\n\nLinda Wheeler\n\nAdministration\n\n“Who Needs a Pool Anyway”\n\nThe alternative event to the Swim Carnival\n\nwill take place on the school oval on March the 9th. All year levels will be involved but will be staggered throughout the day\n\nWe encourage students to dress up and wear their house colours on the day.\n\nRoi Boutsikakis\n\nDirector of Sports\n\nRSC Heritage and Alumni Group\n\nI am pleased to announce that we started this year with a new member. This is significant as we have some members thinking about leaving the committee after serving for many years, so we need more new members, people who attended either RHS or RSC who would like to help maintain the long history of the college so it can continue to be recorded.\n\nThere are people out there now who know of others who attended this school during the past 50 years who would like to help continue the work that has already been done. What we need now are people with an interest in their school/college and have some free time to attend just eight meetings in the school year. These meetings are on Monday evenings on the 3rd and 10th weeks of each term.\n\nWe offer some services to the college, such as trial interviews, support the teachers where we can, as we did with 2019 Expo for students, manage a scholarship fund for students doing VCE and more recently, help the college to convert the old paper documents and photographs to a new digital format where they will be made available to all people visiting the college website.\n\nThat work was interrupted by the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020, but we expect to have it completed in this school year.\n\nAt the end of each decade this committee has created a way to celebrate and record the times and events of Culture and Service at this college, and currently we are looking at what we can do for the 70th Anniversary in 2024.\n\nMany of you would have attended one of these functions in the past, not thinking about how they came to fruition. Have you ever wondered about where those bollards came from, that record the six decades to 2013? It has been the people on this committee with some help from others. You can be part of helping with the next celebrations in 2024 by becoming a member of the RSC Heritage and Alumni Group.\n\nContact the college for details on how to get involved with your college on 9870 2002.\n\nBarry Ring\n\nConvenor\n\nRingwood Secondary College’s alumni (former students) program\n\nRingwood Secondary College is starting an alumni program to build and mobilise the school’s alumni community, with the help of Ourschool.\n\nOurschool is a not-for profit service that helps public high schools build a thriving alumni network to benefit current students and the school community.\n\nAlumni programs in private schools and universities are well established and provide huge benefits to students. Our alumni program will help us grow our alumni community to benefit our students.\n\nThe alumni program will focus on doing these key things:\n\nFind and connect with alumni\n\nInvite alumni back to school to inspire students about study and career pathways\n\nCreate opportunities for students via alumni providing work experience placements\n\nInvite alumni to provide philanthropic support for students and our school by contributing to school fund-raising projects, student scholarships or gifts in wills (longer term goals)\n\nIf you’re reading this and you’re a former student of Ringwood Secondary College, we would love to hear from you. Please get in touch with us by sending an email to:\n\nSylvia Tandberg\n\nalumni@ringwoodsc.vic.edu.au\n\nStay tuned for more alumni news in the school’s newsletter, Facebook page and website.

Kylie Spears, the Maroondah City Council Mayor, hosted the event on Thursday March 4th, kindly inviting to our Year 12 Prefects to participate in this celebratory breakfast.\n\nStudents: Lucy Philp, Emile Young, Hser Eh Blew Say"
