        "text": "Last week, Airmaster's HR Manager, Ralph Rio paid a visit to Ringwood Secondary College to offer recruitment advice. Addressing a number of VCAL students, Ralph discussed all things recruitment including interview techniques, dress codes and etiquette.\n\nThe presentation also offered the chance for students to ask questions and get a great insight into what employers look for when searching for potential candidates.\n\nThe VCAL program at Ringwood Secondary College is an alternative option for students in Years 11 and 12. It provides students with practical work-related experiences; as well as literacy and numeracy skills with the opportunity to build personal skills.\n\nHaving been in the industry for some years, Ralph was keen to share his knowledge with students and give back to the community.\n\n\"Education is so important and being able to build on that with sharing industry knowledge is something that I'm always willing to do\".\n\nAirmaster has a history of helping young people to achieve work-related skills alongside educational achievements. Currently, there are more than 100 apprentices employed nationally by Airmaster who are learning on the job skills while completing valuable qualifications."
