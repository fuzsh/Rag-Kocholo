        "text": "by Rosina Fotia, Principal\n\nLearning Focus\n\nClear focus during this month has been on the completion of Common Assessment Tasks. This will culminate with the Assessment Week planned for all Middle School classes and examination period for Year 11 students. Semester reports will be opened to families at the end of this term. These will contain a summary of assessments and staff assessment against attitudes to learning. On May 25, staff completed day one of training related to the Berry Street Education Model. This day was very well received and provided staff with an opportunity to explore strategies which support students to engage with their learning irrespective of external social and emotional pressures. This was the first of four days of training that the College has committed to over the next two years.\n\nReports\n\nSemester reports will be opened to families this week. These reports contain a summary of assessment tasks completed throughout the first semester as well as ratings against Work Habits. Where a student has had significant absences the code DNP-LP may be visible. This code indicates that the teacher was unable to make valid judgments through low attendance.\n\nEvening Events\n\nIt has been so refreshing to have students engaged in extracurricular activities on site. This term we have seen the Mid-Year Music Concert and the VCE Theatre Studies performances, as well as Middle School Drama performance. Attendance at these events has been positive and staff support has been exceptional. Well done to all staff involved.\n\nMinisterial Visit\n\nOn Friday 27 May the College was visited by the Honourable James Merlino, Minister of Education. The Minister completed a tour of the almost completed C-Wing and then undertook a sod turn to signify the commencement of Stage 3 works. I took this opportunity to request further funding support for the refurbishment of D-Wing and mentioned some issues the school is having with the practical completion issues related to Stage 1 works. Last week this visit was followed up with the release of the Lilydale District and Yarra Valley Education Plan video clip on the Minister’s Facebook page.\n\nBig Freeze\n\nCongratulations to the Senior VCAL class for their amazing work in raising awareness and funds for the MND cause. MND is Motor Neurone Disease (MND); an uncommon condition that affects the brain and nerves. Our students facilitated a range of fundraising activities which was highlighted with our own “Big Freeze”. Staff and students nominated to undertake an “ice bucket” challenge for the cause. The team was able to raise over $1,300 for the cause. An outstanding effort!\n\nReconciliation Week\n\nThis year’s National Reconciliation Week theme has been: Be Brave, Make Change. The College has again committed to providing educational opportunities to all College members regarding reconciliation. Tanna Draper Nagas, out First Nations Advocate, prepared explicit lessons for all year levels. These were aimed at educating, raising awareness and providing opportunities for refection. In support of the week, the student run café offered menu items containing indigenous ingredients. These were well received and sold out very quicky.\n\nBuilding Updates\n\nIt is anticipated that Stage 2 Building Works will be completed by the end of this term. Furniture and locker orders have been processed, although manufacturing delays may mean these resources will not arrive on site for some weeks.\n\nIt is with great sadness that I announce that my time at Lilydale Heights College is coming to an end. I have accepted the Principal position at Ringwood Secondary College and will commence in that role on Monday July 18 (Week 2, Term 3). I wish to thank our wonderful students and families for their support, encouragement, care and passion during my time in this role. I am so proud to have been associated with the College and all its stakeholders. Together we have made a huge impact and difference to learning outcomes for all the students in our care. Plans are in place to ensure that the College continues to thrive. Once future leadership arrangements are confirmed, they will be communicated to you. Once again, thank you and I wish you all well.\n\nTerm 3 begins Tuesday July 12. I wish everyone a safe and warm winter term break\n\nStay well."
