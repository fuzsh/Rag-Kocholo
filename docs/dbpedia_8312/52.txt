The Minutemen, Puzzle, and Koffee joined forces with The Runaways to create the song "Tired Of The Love." The song has a punk rock vibe thanks to the Minutemen cooperation, with frantic guitar riffs and harsh vocals. The song gained an alternative rock component from the Puzzle collaboration, with a more melodic and ethereal vibe. With a relaxed rhythm and soulful vocals, the Koffee collaboration added a reggae element to the mix.

The Runaways' partnership with Koffee is particularly intriguing because it demonstrates their openness to experimenting with various genres and styles. The song's incorporation of reggae adds a unique touch and demonstrates the band's range.
