        "text": "A revival of my favorite Marvel series\n\nRUNAWAYS VOL. 1 — FIND YOUR WAY HOME\n\nCOLLECTING ISSUES 1-6\n\nThis is a revival of my all-time favorite Marvel series. It picks up where the Runaways left off in Marvel continuity, but we really worked to make this story accessible to new readers. I love these characters as if they’re my own, and I think you will, too. This first volume is a getting-the-band-back-together story with lots of feelings and banter. Also, the world’s best dinosaur.\n\n\"(Rowell's) writing is as sharp and charming as always, and the arc she’s crafted is brimming with hope.\" – Tor.com\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble (exclusive edition)\n\nIndie Bound\n\nRUNAWAYS VOL. 2 — BEST FRIENDS FOREVER\n\nCOLLECTING ISSUES 7-12\n\nThis is the volume with the best kissing. Also: Time travel! Doombot! The Runaways Are Bad Superheroes. Molly gets an offer she might not refuse. And Gert walks downstairs in a very dramatic way.\n\n“Everyone in Runaways is growing up, but the creative team doesn’t confuse maturity with grimness or despair. These young heroes are growing up so they can find love and joy with the people they care about the most, overcoming the pain of the past to give themselves a brighter future.” – The A.V. Club\n\n\"This is a title where every character feels real and three dimensional, more than just archetypes or action stars but like actual kids with actual concerns, desires, deep-seated fears, and the ability to grow and change.\" – Retcon Punch\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nIndie Bound\n\nRUNAWAYS VOL. 3 — THAT WAS YESTERDAY\n\nCOLLECTING ISSUES 13-18\n\nNothing stays dead in Runaways, especially the past. Alex Wilder is back, and he’s got a trio of elder gods on his tail, and the other Runaways would rather not deal with it, thanks. This volume has: more kissing, a really sweet Old Lace story, and the best Christmas issue in comics history. (According to me.)\n\n“The best damn character writing in comics.” — AIPT!\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nIndie Bound\n\nRUNAWAYS VOL. 6 — COME AWAY WITH ME\n\nCOLLECTING ISSUES 32-38\n\nThe Runaways are in a dark and scary place. There are so many pieces to pick up and choices to be made — and if the team is good at anything, it’s making bad choices. Which leads them to descend into one of the most terrifying Marvel Universe locations ever: high school! It goes better for some than others. But when Wolverine and Pixie of the X-Men arrive with an offer for Molly, she finds herself faced with the biggest decision of her young life: stay with the Runaways, or finally find a home on the mutant island utopia that is Krakoa? Meanwhile, Nico made a rough decision — and she’s about to pay for it. And just as the Runaways finally rebuild their lives, everything comes crashing to the ground. And at the center of it all is…Gert?!\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nIndie Bound\n\nSome nice things people are saying about Runaways …\n\nPOLYGON\n\n\"The Runaways’ comic has been around since 2003, but it’s never been better than it is right now.\"\n\nDEN OF GEEKS\n\n\"It’s a masterful mix of superheroics, joyful immersion in Marvel continuity, and soapy teenage drama. ... If you liked the original series from Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, you’re going to be shocked at how much this feels like if that same book had never ended. Even though the characters have grown and changed substantially, their voices are distinct and seamless.\"\n\nPASTE\n\n\"Runaways represents not just a high mark for the franchise, but one of the best teen-centric books published by the ‘Big Two’ of Marvel and DC Comics in recent memory.\"\n\nBARNES & NOBLE\n\n\"Like Rowell’s novels, perfect gems of pop culture fizz and real heart, this is killer stuff: angsty, romantic, and consistently surprising.\"\n\nTHE COMEBACK\n\n\"Runaways is so much fun and accessible to new-and-old readers alike. It’s the rare continuation that rivals the initial conception.\"\n\nTHE VERGE\n\n\"[Rowell's] character voices are warm, troubled, and yearning, and Anka is as comfortable depicting couture as heartbroken tears. This isn’t just a fantastic new run for steadfast fans. It’s a coming-of-age journey all its own.\"\n\nMULTIVERSITY COMICS\n\n\"Rowell proved to have just the right amount of reverence for the original series while also taking the characters in new and interesting directions. [...] “Runaways is the perfect spiritual successor to the first series.\"\n\nTHE A.V. CLUB\n\n\"Writer Rainbow Rowell, artist Kris Anka, and colorist Matthew Wilson rekindle the fire of the original series to create a vibrant, stylish, angst-filled comic about the struggles of growing up and the difficulty of recapturing the joys of youth.\""
