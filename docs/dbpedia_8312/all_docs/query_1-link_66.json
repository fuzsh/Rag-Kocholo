        "text": "Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart, The Runaways\n\nYesterday I saw the film, The Runaways, a music-fueled coming of age biopic of the groundbreaking, all girl 1970's rock band The Runaways. The movie chronicles the years from 1975 to 1977, beginning with band's formation, their meteoric rise to fame under the Svengali-like influence of rock impresario Kim Fowley, and ending with lead singer Cherie Currie's eventual crash and burn, and her exit from the band.\n\nThe Runaways - Lita Ford, Cherie Currie, Jackie Fox, Sandy West, Joan Jett\n\nThe original band was formed in 1975 by drummer Sandy West and rhythm guitarist Joan Jett who on separate occasions introduced themselves to producer Kim Fowley about starting an all-girl band. Fowley gave Jett's phone number to West, and helped them to fill out their band with bassist Micki Steel. The band started as a trio playing party and club circuit around Los Angeles. The following year they added lead guitarist Lita Ford and lead singer Cherie Currie to the lineup. Bassist Steele left the band, and her spot was filled with first Peggy Foster, then Anne Boleyn, and finally Jackie Fox. The Runaways were signed with Mercury Records in 1976 and their debut album, The Runaways, was released shortly after. The band toured and played numerous sold out shows. After their second album, Queen of Noise was released in 1977 the band began a world tour. The Runaways arrived in Japan for a string of sold out shows, but bassist Jackie Fox left the group and was eventually replaced with Vicki Blue. After Currie left the band Jett took over lead vocals full time. In 1978, over disagreements about money and management, the band parted ways with Kim Fowley. Bassist Vicki Blue left the group and was replaced by Laurie McAllister, but The Runaways played their last concert on New Year's Eve in 1978 and broke up in April 1979.\n\nA BITE OF THE CHERRY\n\nThe Runaways had a hit single called Cherry Bomb, a song that Jett and Fowley penned on the spot at Cherie Currie's audition when she arrived with a song they didn't know. In tribute of the song I've included a Cherry Pie recipe. Who doesn't love cherry pie? It's also one of the easiest fruit pies to make. Fresh tart cherries are best but in a pinch (or out of season) one 16-oz can equals about 2 cups of tart cherries, or 3 cups of frozen cherries equals a fresh pound.\n\nTart Cherry Pie\n\n1 recipe for 9-inch double crust pie pastry\n\n5 cups whole tart cherries or dark sweet cherries (2 lbs)\n\n1 cup plus 1 tbsp sugar\n\n3 tbsp cornstarch or quick-cooking tapioca\n\n1/4 tsp salt\n\n2 tbsp water\n\n1 tsp fresh lemon juice (if using sour cherries) or 3 tbsp lemon juice (if using dark sweet cherries)\n\n1/4 tsp almond extract\n\n2 tbsp butter (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n\n1 tbsp milk"
