        "text": "The transport company is offering runaways between the ages of 12 and 21 a ride back home.\n\nAs part of the Home Free Program, Greyhound has partnered with National Runaway Safeline to make sure runaways have a safe way to return home to their families and legal guardians within the U.S. To be eligible for the bus tickets, children must be between the age of 12 and 21, be named on a runaway report and both the child and guardians should be willing to reunite with each other.\n\nEach person will only be able to use the Home Free service twice and will need to call the NRS helpline where trained staff members are available 24/7 to listen to issues surrounding the decision to leave home and provide council for those wanting to rebuild positive relationships. From there, the NRS team will facilitate a conference call between those that have left home and their legal guardians to create a plan of action and ensure there is adequate support to return to. After being safely returned home, there will be a follow-up meeting along with resources to aid the development of healthy caring bonds. Additional tickets will be made available for a parent or legal guardian if the runaway is under the age of 15.\n\nThe program helps around 400 kids and teenagers return to their homes every year. National Runaway Safeline is a range of additional support for missing children and those thinking of running away.\n\nA safe journey is also the company’s top priority. Thus the bus has a fresh air intake every five minutes, and all passengers require masks onboard.\n\nFor more information about National Runaway Safeline, visit www.1800runaway.org.\n\nIf you or someone you know has run away and wants to come home or you need some help, call toll-free 1-800-RUNAWAY (1-800-786-2929)."
