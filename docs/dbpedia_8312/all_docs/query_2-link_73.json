        "text": "While the Runaways were recording their first record, Kim Fowley brought in Ann Boleyn for an audition. In turning down working with the producer, she looked ahead to a life in metal. Hear some of the trials and tribulations of Ann Boleyn: the lead singer of Hellion, the mentee of Ronnie James Dio, the founder of New Renaissance Records.\n\nSOURCES\n\nThis season of Bad Reputation would not be possible without the work of journalist Evelyn McDonnell and her book Queens of Noise.

But Micki Steele, their original bassist and lead singer, was quickly pushed out of the band. Almost 10 years later, she found a home in the Bangles, a band that gave her more commercial success and creative satisfaction than the Runaways ever could. But what happened between leaving the Runaways and joining the Bangles?\n\nSOURCES\n\nThis season of Bad Reputation would not be possible without the work of journalist Evelyn McDonnell and her book Queens of Noise.

How did this affect the band’s development, and where did women who refused to work with the Runaways’ manager end up?
