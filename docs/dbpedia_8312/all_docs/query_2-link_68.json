Whether you consider them to be proto-punk rockers or heavy metal guitar heroes, there is no doubt that they helped change the landscape and the perception of women in the male-dominated field of rock n’ roll forever.\n\nCherie Currie, Joan Jett, Lita Ford, Sandy West, Jackie Fox, Vicki Blue; these teenage girls shocked and rocked both audiences and critics alike and in the process spoke to a whole new generation of girls - some of whom consequently turned to playing rock 'n' roll themselves. Arguably, The Runaways kicked down the door for future all-female bands such as The Go-Gos, The Bangles, L7, The Donnas and Sleater Kinney. The Runaways have also been named as an influence by numerous male-fronted acts like Redd Kross, The Germs, Motley Crue, White Flag, Guns ‘N’ Roses, The Adolescents and Smashing Pumpkins to name a few.\n\nTake It Or Leave It, a 2-disc collection, features 36 tracks and over 2 hours of music, spanning The Runaways‘ entire catalog. Their best known songs, like “Cherry Bomb”, “Queens Of Noise”, “California Paradise” and “Heartbeat” are all represented alongside more obscure tunes like “Hollywood”, “I Love Playin’ With Fire”, “Neon Angels On The Road To Ruin” and “Born To Be Bad”. Take It Or Leave It also includes two performances by original Runaways band members: lead vocalist Cherie Currie’s rocking remake of fan-favorite “American Nights” and “Dirty Magazines”, the last recording made by drummer Sandy West with her band Blue Fox.\n\nThe true sign of a successful tribute is that it shines a spotlight on the songs, and Take It Or Leave It does just that. This compilation brings attention to the original performances while also showcasing each band’s unique interpretation. Artists from various musical backgrounds participated on this project, each donating their time and resources to help Main Man Records honor The Runaways. Some of our very special guests include The Donnas, Shonen Knife, The Adolescents, The Dandy Warhols, Richard Barone (of The Bongos), Derwood Andrews (of Generation X), Toilet Boys, Care Bears On Fire (with Earl Slick of David Bowie/New York Dolls), Kittie, Starz, David Johansen (of New York Dolls) and Kathleen Hanna (of Bikini Kill/Le Tigre) & Peaches, (whose collaboration was produced by Ad Rock of the Beastie Boys) as well as members of Frehley’s Comet, Monster Magnet, The Fastbacks, The Cucumbers, The Doughboys and Cousin Oliver from The Brady Bunch, Robbie Rist!\n\nInterspersed with the music are mock radio ads by broadcast legends Rodney Bingenheimer, Carol Miller & \"Mr. Marty\" Martinez, candid comments from Johnny Ramone and a recollection of the band's appearance at CBGB's by noted radio personality Meg Griffin.\n\nIn honor of Sandy West, who lost her fight with cancer in 2006, Main Man Records will be donating a portion of the proceeds from Take It Or Leave It to the American Institute for Cancer Research in her memory.\n\nDisc One:\n\nTHE DONNAS - Queens Of Noise\n\nSHONEN KNIFE - Black Leather\n\nTHE BINGES - I Love Playin' With Fire\n\nBEBE BUELL BAND - Heartbeat\n\nDEENA & THE LAUGHING BOYS - Lovers\n\nFRANKENSTEIN 3000 - California Paradise\n\nDELIRIUM TREMENS - Wasted\n\nRICHIE SCARLET - Wild Thing\n\nBLUE FOX - Neon Angels On The Road To Ruin\n\nTHE EASY OUTS featuring GAR FRANCIS - Is It Day Or Night\n\nLAURA WARSHAUER - Little Lost Girls\n\nWHITE FLAG - C’mon\n\nCALI GIRAFFES - You’re Too Possessive\n\nTARA ELLIOTT & THE RED VELVETS - You Drive Me Wild\n\nPLANET SORROW - Thunder\n\nROBBIE RIST - Yesterday’s Kids\n\nSERPENTEENS - Little Sister\n\nADOLESCENTS - School Days\n\nBLUE FOX featuring SANDY WEST - Dirty Magazines\n\nDisc Two:\n\nTHE DANDY WARHOLS - Cherry Bomb\n\nRICHARD BARONE - Hollywood\n\nCARE BEARS ON FIRE with EARL SLICK - Saturday Night Special\n\nDERWOOD ANDREWS - Gotta Get Out Tonight*\n\nDAVID JOHANSEN - Blackmail\n\nTHE RIBEYE BROTHERS - Trash Can Murders\n\nDIGGER PHELPS - Rock & Roll\n\nTOILET BOYS - Born To Be Bad\n\nTHE SWALES - Midnight Music\n\nFRANKENSTEIN 3000 featuring CHERIE CURRIE - American Nights\n\nF-13 - I Wanna Be Where The Boys Are\n\nTHE STAY AT HOMES - Gettin’ Hot\n\nKITTIE - Fantasies\n\nSTARZ - Waitin’ For The Night\n\nJACK BRAG - Secrets\n\nCLINICAL TRIALS - Don’t Go Away\n\nKATHLEEN HANNA & PEACHES - Dead End Justice (produced by Ad Rock)\n\n* The retail digital version will not include interview clips nor Derwood Andrews' track.
