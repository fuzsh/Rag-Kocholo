        "text": "How \"underground\" was the Underground Railroad?\n\nPeople who had escaped their enslavement headed north to gain their freedom and to escape intolerable situations. They needed courage and resourcefulness to evade law enforcement officers and professional slave catchers who earned rewards for returning them to their masters. Southerners bitterly resented those in the North who assisted the slaves. They coined the term “Underground Railroad” to mean an organized network devoted to keep slaves away from their masters, sometimes even crossing the border into Canada. There was no actual physical “railroad” with engines and tracks, but the term stuck. In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law that levied heavy fines on anyone guilty of helping slaves to escape. Many in the north resented the law that forced them to help sustain a system that they opposed.\n\nUnderground Railroad \"Stations\" Develop in Iowa\n\nIowa shares a southern border with Missouri, which was a slave state. In the 1840s and 1850s, abolitionists (those who wanted to abolish slavery) developed a system of “stations” that could move runaways toward the Mississippi River to Illinois on their way to freedom. Members of two religious groups, the Congregationalists and Quakers, played leading roles in abolitionist activities. They were also active in the Underground Railroad in the state.\n\nBecause it had to be secret, we have few written records about the Underground Railroad in Iowa. One source has identified more than 100 Iowans involved in the effort. A main route across the state started in southwest Iowa near Council Bluffs where a free black, John Williamson, helped those fleeing slavery on their road to freedom. Hitchcock House in Cass County near Lewis is another known stop in one way or another with the Underground Railroad. Rev. George Hitchcock, a Congregationalist minister, passed along \"passengers\" to the next stop. James Jordan in West Des Moines and Josiah Grinnell in Grinnell were also leaders of the effort. Several of these sites are now museums open to the public.\n\nIt is impossible to know the numbers of blacks the Underground Railroad assisted. Individual families also responded when asked for help. Free blacks living in the state, particularly in southeast Iowa, were often involved. When the Civil War started and the Fugitive Slave Law could no longer be enforced in the north, many blacks escaped into the state and became permanent residents. In 1868, Iowa granted black men the right to vote. The Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools and discrimination in public accommodations were illegal in Iowa.\n\nIowa: A Free State Willing to Let Slavery Exist\n\nSlavery was a divisive issue for the United States from its very creation. The early conflicts were not about slavery in the South but its extension as new states joined the Union. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 established an east-west line along the southern border of Missouri that would forever divide free/slave settlement. States to the south could allow slavery; states to the north (with the exception of slave state Missouri) could not.\n\nSettlers knew that Iowa would be a free state. Most Iowans were willing to let slavery exist in the South. Like most white Americans of the time period, they believed in the superiority of the white race and opposed granting equal rights or opportunities to African Americans. They passed laws attempting to discourage blacks from coming to the state. On the national level, they wanted most of all to find compromises that would keep the Union together. Iowa did have a small population of abolitionists who wanted to abolish slavery everywhere as a moral evil.\n\nIn 1854, Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act that allowed the settlers in any new territory to decide the slavery issue there for themselves. This opened the possibility that Nebraska on Iowa’s western border could become a slave state. Most Iowans opposed that prospect. The Republican Party emerged strongly opposed to any further extension of slavery into western territories.\n\nSupporting Questions\n\nHow dangerous was the Underground Railroad?\n\n$200 Reward: Poster for the Return of Formerly-Enslaved People, October 1, 1847 (Document)\n\n\"Effects of the Fugitive-Slave-Law\" Print, 1850 (Image)\n\nFugitive Slave Law, 1850 (Document)\n\nHow did runaway slaves rely on the help of abolitionists to escape to freedom?\n\nAnti-Slavery Bugle Article - \"William and Ellen Craft,\" February 23, 1849 (Document)\n\nAnti-Slavery Bugle Article - \"Underground Railroad,\" September 16, 1854 (Document)\n\n\"A Presbyterian Clergyman Suspended for Being Connected with the Underground Railroad\" Article, November 8, 1855 (Document)\n\nWilliam Maxson Home in West Liberty, Iowa, 1890 (Image)\n\n\"Fugitive Slave Case Was Tried\" The Daily Gate City Article, April 13, 1915 (Document)\n\nHow did some runaway slaves create their own opportunities to escape?\n\n\"The 'Running of Slaves' - The Extraordinary Escape of Henry Box Brown\" Article, June 23, 1849 (Document)\n\nHenry \"Box\" Brown Song and the Engraved Box, 1850 (Image, Document)\n\n\"The Resurrection of Henry 'Box' Brown at Philadelphia\" Illustration, 1850 (Image)\n\nRobert Smalls: \"The Steamer 'Planter' and Her Captor,\" June 14, 1862 (Document)\n\n\"A Bold Stroke for Freedom\" Illustration, 1872 (Image)\n\nUnderground Railroad Source Set Teaching Guide Printable Image and Document Guide\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nHarriet Tubman\n\nHarriet Ross Tubman Day\n\nThe website includes the statement made by the State of Delaware about the observance of Harriet Ross Tubman Day on March 10, 2017.
