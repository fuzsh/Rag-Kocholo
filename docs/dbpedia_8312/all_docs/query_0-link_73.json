        "text": "Big hitters and all-girl band, The Runaways are an act that have some weight behind them.\n\nWith such big albums in the 70s it’s clear that their songs are not the most unpopular of bands.\n\nIf spandex was ever at an all time high, The Runaways’ gigs in Japan during the late 70s to be particular shows that not only Joan Jett but her band of merry band of sistas were very fond of the style.\n\nAmidst the glam rock popularity of their time, it’s clear that The Runaways were ever so true to the genre. With lively performances, fan screams that even Kiss would be jealous off and an explosive stage set you can expect not only an entertaining show but also a musically worth-while experience.\n\nThe stage presence of Cherrie Currie is unmissable due to how big she makes her skinny figure look as big as the stage. A long with the cool laid back approach of the rest of the band, there is a very easy/ cool vibe to the gig.\n\nWith a name like Joan Jett in The Runaways you can expect nothing short of a master class in how to encapsulate a crowd.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nCherrybomb! The Runaways haven't ripped up the stage since 2011 and I think it's about time they took to the stage again. These sassy, scandalous, sexy American women light up the night with their heavy American punk. Originating from LA, these ladies were active in the late 70's, but they have an air about them still of 'the girl power' vibrations which makes me consider them still current in todays massive music market. Women can relate to their tenacious and feracious attitude that they strut when performing live.\n\nThey were highly successful in Japan funnily enough. I consider them a strong influence to current bands like Dum Dum Girls and the Jezabels. With hits like Cherrybomb, Hollywood and even covering one of my favourite Velvet Underground songs Rock n Roll, I can proudly say that The Runaways will always be in my top ten girl bands.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
