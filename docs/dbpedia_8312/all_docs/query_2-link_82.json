        "text": "I feared that this review would be very sexist, but I was pleasantly surprised. Mr. Myers did a really good job with this one, concentrating mostly on the music and not on the fact that they were (and are) hot and sexy women.\n\nRead on.\n\nOrgasmic Review Dept.\n\nRunaways: getting better all the time\n\nThe Runaways: “Queens Of Noise” (Mercury Import) ***1/2\n\nAlbum review by Barry Myers\n\nJUST OVER three months ago, the Runaways planted a collective firm knee in the sceptics lower regions, turning on a series of exciting performances during their British tour, particularly their Roundhouse gigs. This confirmed their fast growing reputation as a tight rock’n’ roll outfit. Now unleashed is ‘Queens Of Noise’, the follow-up to last year’s debut, marking a reconciliation with ‘founder’ Kim Fowley. Fowley is credited as one of the composers of seven of the ten tracks, and also co-produced with Earle Mankey, in whose Santa Monica studios the album was recorded.\n\nThe final package has a crisper, slightly more powerful finish than its’ predecessor, though a couple of the new songs aren’t quite as effective. Lyrically, the tracks are naturally concerned with the themes of teenage rampage, California, and the heartaches of rocknlove. However, there is a shift of emphasis, on some numbers, to the inside-looking-out perspective, rather than vice-versa.\n\nThe cover pics are far more flattering than previously. Cherie, Joan, Sandy, Jackie and Lita are caught by the camera, decked out in black, clinging to long, metallic shafts. Imagery to keep the boys happy? Exploitation can work both ways and they employ it to their own advantage. If they were purely teenage sex symbols, devoid of musical talent, there would be no future for them in the rock’n’ roll world.\n\nRocked into motion by the biographical title track, hotly pursued by Joan Jett’s ‘Take It Or Leave It’, possible single material(?), Cherie Currie then makes her first appearance, on the reflective ‘Midnight Music’. Her involvement seems to have diminished, though the sultry, sensuous miss beautifully handles the albums two tear-jerkers in her irresistably moody manner. Was a reduced role for the aforementioned lady, a condition of Fowley’s return, who heavily bad-mouthed her in the last October issue of Crawdaddy? Hopefully, that’s just idle speculation. ‘Born To Be Bad’, not one of the best tracks, follows, but then it’s back to hard-ass rock, Cherie vocalising, for ‘Neon Angels On The Road To Ruin’.\n\nSide two is consistenly enjoyable, except for the last track. Divinely decadent Joan’s higher pitched vocals are perfect for ‘I Love Playin’ With Fire’, and than ace drummer, Sandy West, storms the band into two home-grown songs. Firstly Joan and Cherie both take ‘California Paradise’, my alternative single choice, and then Joan is back in the driving seat alone for `Hollywood’. ‘Heartbeat’ is Cherie’s other emotional show-piece, but then comes the disappointing finale. The seven minute epic ‘Johnny Guitar’ is poorly recorded and proves to be an unnecessary use of vinyl. `Queens Of Noise’ is recommended, but with their talents continually maturing, the improved studio sound, plus a complete selection of worthy material, their third album should be a bitch. They possess tremendous potential and although their studio work doesn’t yet match their live dynamism, they are taking on the challenge, presented by the bastions of bigotry and male-dominance of the rock industry, and winning.\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.
