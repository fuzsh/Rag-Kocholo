        "text": "NCMEC defines an Endangered Runaway as a child under the age of 18 who is missing on his or her own accord and whose whereabouts are unknown to their parent or legal guardian. These children are highly vulnerable and can experience homelessness when they are missing. According to a recent report from Chapin Hall,1 in 30 adolescent minors ages 13 to 17 endures some form of homelessness in a year.\n\nNCMEC partners with a variety of organizations that share our commitment to helping families and young people stay safe.\n\nNCMEC is proud to partner with the National Runaway Safeline. We encourage local communities to implement their evidence-based Let's Talk: Runaway Prevention Curriculum.\n\nFor families with a missing or sexually exploited child, NCMEC provides support services like crisis intervention and local counseling referrals to appropriate professionals. Our Team HOPE program connects families with peers who have had similar experiences and can offer coping skills and compassion. When a missing child is recovered, we help families with the reunification process, including mental health services and travel assistance.\n\nWith help from our private-sector photo partners, we coordinate the creation and dissemination of missing child posters to targeted geographic areas to help generate leads and engage the public in the search.\n\nThe public can also help in the recovery efforts by signing up in The ADAM Program to receive missing child alerts in their area.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the song \"Runaway Train\" featured missing children in its music video and helped close 21 cases! For the 25th anniversary of the song, we reimagined \"Runaway Train\" with new artists and a dynamic music video that updates itself with missing children from the NCMEC database based on a user's location. That means more missing children in front of more people in more relevant places."
