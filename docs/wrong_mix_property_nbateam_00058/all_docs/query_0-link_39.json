        "text": "Your browser does not support iframes.\n\nFrustration is, understandably, perhaps starting to build within the Nuggets. Denver lost its fifth straight game Sunday, 116-110 to the Trail Blazers in Portland, and late in the fourth quarter, things got a little ugly between Kenneth Faried and Blazers guard Steve Blake.\n\nWith about 7:15 left, Faried set a blind screen on Blake near the top of the key and added an extra push while doing so. Blake, clearly unhappy about the push, sent an elbow to Faried’s chest. Faried fell to the floor only to quickly get up and get in Blake’s face. The two had to be separated by teammates.\n\nAfter the game, Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts told CSNNW.com that he could see why Blake was upset about the play, but admitted he didn’t know if it was dirty.\n\n“That was a tough screen,” Stotts said. “I just quickly saw the replay, so I’m not sure if it was a dirty play. I just know that you can’t set a blind screen. You know, he was setting a screen, Steve didn’t see it coming, so I think it had more of an effect than maybe the intent.”\n\nFaried also addressed the play after the game and admitted he did a bit of acting to get the refs’ attention.\n\n“He got mad I back-picked him,” Faried said of Blake. “I’m playing offense, I’m making sure my point guard got open, and he ran into the back pick trying to go to my point guard. Then he got mad about it and pushed me. Yeah, I fell down to make sure the ref saw it.”\n\nWhether Faried acted or now, it’s hard to deny that Blake’s shove was innocent. So far, no fines have been issued by the league."
