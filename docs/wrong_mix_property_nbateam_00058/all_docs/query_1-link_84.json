        "text": "The trade sending Marcus Camby to Portland for Travis Outlaw(notes), Steve Blake(notes) and cash is now official. Here's what they're saying out in the ether about the deal ...\n\nClips Nation: \"I'm monumentally disappointed in this trade. From a fan's perspective it does nothing. If Camby was in such high demand, how can he not bring something for the team? Unless DTS is going to take that $3M and issue rebates, Clipper fans have a legitimate beef with this deal. There's no extra cap space for the summer (i.e. neither Telfair nor Thornton were dealt), there are no future picks, there are no long term prospects. The Bird rights to Blake and Travis Outlaw (while losing the Bird rights to Camby) is all this trade amounts to beyond mid-April. And by the way, Bird rights don't amount to much when you're hoping to be under the cap and sign a free agent.\"\n\nBlazersedge: \"Camby is not a great straight-up defender. He's not going to be handcuffing Dwight Howard(notes) or Andrew Bynum(notes). He will block shots, especially when providing help. The Blazers will take that. He can rebound, which the Blazers also need big-time since the centers went down. His offense is best when he's facing up. He has a nice free-throw area jumper, which also fits in with this team. He's not going to change the offense, however. Whatever you're frustrated with offensively now you'll still be frustrated with when Marcus plays. His biggest asset is simply being a proficient player with size. Juwan Howard(notes) has done yeoman's work at center but how long could he and the Blazers get away with playing him 30+ minutes in crucial games? When you're crawling through the desert and someone offers you a drink you don't ask whether it's tap water or purified.\"\n\nKevin Pelton, Basketball Prospectus: \"With Brendan Haywood(notes) in Dallas, the best short-term rental option in the middle is Camby, who makes little sense at this point for a Clippers team that has slipped 10 games below .500 and headed into the All-Star break on a four-game losing streak. With an expiring contract, Camby can help a team now without hurting the balance sheet going forward. [...] Camby has been stronger than ever on the glass, pulling down a career-best 22.7 percent of available rebounds and essentially one in three opponent misses (33.1 percent of available defensive rebounds). Both marks lead the league. Camby does have some issues defensively in terms of stepping out on the perimeter and playing the pick-and-roll, but he is an excellent defensive anchor who would upgrade most teams in the middle.\"\n\nHenry Abbott, TrueHoop: \"... [Travis Outlaw] has learned to become a very special kind of shooter. Few NBA players go from never being allowed to shoot to having repeated plays called for them with the game on the line. And every single player who ever makes that leap is, you can guarantee it, a hard worker. Which matters. Travis is frank that he really wants to be a star. That's his motivation, and I believe he'll keep working hard because of it. He's a real deal long athlete, he has this ability to score. He's also everybody's best friend, and to my eyes an important part of why the Blazers have generally been a cheerful team. However, he is not the most aware player. Some players are really quick thinking, but that's not him. The exact cluelessness that makes him impervious to crunch time pressure also makes him a liability in complex defensive schemes. His defense has gotten much better, and the sky's the limit for his individual D. But you know how Boston so cleverly rotates to keep everyone covered with help? Hard to picture him thriving in that system.\"\n\nClipperBlog: \"The Clippers can now go over the cap to retain Outlaw or Blake next season without being charged luxury tax. What are the chances a Donald Sterling owned team goes over the cap ever, especially in this economy? Pretty slim. If it does happen though, you could do worse than filling out your bench with Outlaw and/or Blake. Although the Clippers had Bird Rights with Camby, the team likely would have renounced him (and the rights) so they could have the space cleared to make offers to other free agents.\"\n\nHank Stern, Willamette Week: \"This is a deal that should improve the Blazers' playoff position this year, increasing the odds they can make it out of the first round. And they did it without sacrificing anybody who's part of the longer-term effort to build a championship contender. Good on them. As former Blazers coach Jack Ramsay said this morning on 95.5 The Game, it's worth noting that Camby has been injury-prone and the Blazers obviously don't need another big man to succumb to the team's unfortunate history of centers with injuries (Bill Walton, Sam Bowie, Greg Oden(notes), etc.) [...] Tonight's home game against the Clippers suddenly got a lot more interesting.\"\n\nEric Freeman, The Baseline: \"Everyone in this deal has an expiring contract, so L.A. is essentially trading their best asset for a little extra money for Donald Sterling. Kelly Dwyer rightly points out that Mike Dunleavy would also be interested in that money as a potential boost to his 2010-11 salary, so we have a case of the Clippers' head honchos acting in their self-interest above anything else. Congrats, guys.\"\n\nDwight Jaynes: \"Seriously, what did you give up to bring the second-leading rebounder in the league here? Not all that much. Camby is Joel Przybilla(notes) with a foul-line jumper. You could now make a case that the Trail Blazers have a chance to make a little noise in the playoffs. Now don't go thinking they're going to win a title or something, but they could end up being a tough out. Camby solves a real big problem on defense and the boards and if Brandon Roy(notes) is healthy, this team can win a series, depending on matchups. And it's a team you couldn't say that about prior to this deal. Basically, two teams traded players who don't fit their long-term future â€” and Portland came away with a big advantage.\""
