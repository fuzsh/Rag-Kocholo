        "text": "blake.kaman.JPG\n\nThe Blazers signed free agents Steve Blake and Chris Kaman on Thursday.\n\n(Bruce Ely/The Oregonian)\n\nTUALATIN — As a swarm of cars, fans and television news cameras gathered outside LeBron James' Ohio home and a host of reporters tracked private plane movement and scoured sources for a sliver of news surrounding big-name NBA free agents, the Trail Blazers on Thursday quietly put the finishing touches on their roster for next season.\n\nSteve Blake is coming home (again). Chris Kaman is bringing his unique personality to the city that likes to keep it weird. And the Blazers, as a result, are getting better.\n\n\"These are both guys that we targeted early in the process,\" Blazers general manager Neil Olshey said. \"We couldn't have come away with two guys that fit what we're trying to do better given the tools that we had at our disposal.\"\n\nThe additions are not sexy and Kaman and Blake did not generate a circus-like free agent frenzy like James and his Decision, Part 2, have caused in Cleveland and Miami and other parts of the NBA universe.\n\nBut this was always going to be a relatively quiet summer for Olshey and the Blazers, who had just two open roster spots and two tools (the midlevel and biannual exception) to use to improve the roster through free agency. By adding Blake and Kaman, the Blazers filled their biggest needs — adding a backup big and backup point guard — and they did so without sacrificing long-term flexibility or trading away valuable pieces of the team's core.\n\nBlake and Kaman don't merely add depth to the Blazers' roster, they add experience, toughness and versatility. The Blazers won 54 games and advanced to the second round of the playoffs last season and every key player from that team returns except sixth man Mo Williams. Blake, a steadier, grittier, pass-first point guard, will replace him and Kaman will add scoring, bulk and veteran savvy to the Blazers' frontcourt.\n\n\"We have higher ambitions for next season, and I think that they will both be instrumental in getting that success,\" coach Terry Stotts said. \"It's the perfect fit for both of them, and for us.\n\n\"These guys fill a lot of holes ... with their versatility. They're not one-position players. And I enjoy that part of it; to be able to put different people in different spots and kind of create opportunities out on the court. And they both do that for us.\"\n\nIt will be Blake's third stint in Portland, where he has played 269 games over parts of four seasons, which included some of the best of his career. In 2008-09, he averaged a career-high 11.0 points and shot a career-high 42.7 percent from three-point range as a starter, helping the Blazers win 54 games. And while he holds career averages of 6.9 points and 4.0 assists, he exceeded that production during each of his stops in Portland, where he's averaged 8.9 points 4.7 assists and 2.3 rebounds.\n\nBlake's versatility to play on or off the ball will allow Stotts to use him both behind All-Star Damian Lillard and alongside him in a similar role to the one Williams had last season. And where Williams was often feast-or-famine, Blake, while not flashy, is steady and consistent. His defense is an upgrade and his tough, unselfish demeanor will be a welcome addition to the locker room. What's more, his shooting prowess will be a perfect fit for Stotts' three-point-happy offense.\n\nBlake has made 39 percent of his three-pointers during his career and is listed among the franchise career leaders in multiple three-point shooting categories, ranking third in percentage (40.8) and seventh in makes (415).\n\nBut more than his past successes in Portland and his fit on the roster, signing with the Blazers was a family decision for Blake, 34, who for years has owned a home in West Linn.\n\nOlshey and Stotts set up a visit with Blake earlier this week to relay their interest and feel out whether a reunion would be possible. When Olshey called Wednesday night to offer Blake a two-year, $4.2 million contract, he and his wife, Kristen, debated their options throughout the night. Blake had multiple free agent suitors and he likely could have fetched more money if he waited for the dominoes to fall in NBA free agency.\n\nBut Blake and his wife decided Thursday morning that the potential of landing a little extra money was less important than being close to family — including their three sons, Nicolas, Jameson and Zachary — and playing for a winning organization on the rise.\n\n\"This was definitely a family decision,\" Blake said. \"My wife was very involved with the process, making the decision. So we talked about it a lot last night and (Thursday) morning, and we both felt this was the best place for me and my family.\"\n\nKaman, 32, is just starting a family — his wife, Emilie, is four months pregnant with their first child — so the allure of signing a two-year, $9.8 million contract with the Blazers was mostly about basketball and playing for a winner.\n\nIn 11 NBA seasons, Kaman has played on nine losing teams and been in the playoffs just once, in 2005-06 with the Clippers.\n\nHe brings a combination of scoring punch, size (7-feet, 265 pounds) and know-how to a frontcourt that, outside of starters LaMarcus Aldridge and Robin Lopez, is littered with youth. Kaman has averaged 11.7 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.4 blocks, while shooting 49 percent, in his career, and his versatility to play both power forward and center was enticing for the Blazers.\n\nKaman has not been a feature player for a couple years, but even in a limited role last season for the Los Angeles Lakers, he averaged 10.4 points and 5.9 rebounds and registered several eyebrow-raising performances. During a March win over the Suns, he recorded 28 points, 17 rebounds and six assists, and during a dynamic four-game run in February, Kaman averaged a double-double.\n\n\"Having played 11 years already, I've experienced the ups and the downs,\" Kaman said. \"I wanted to go somewhere where I felt like I would fit, that I would actually help the team, and not go to a team where they were trying to build or rebuild or where I would get stuck on the bench or play a small role. I wanted to go somewhere where I feel like I was going to help the team.\"\n\nAnd even though they weren't the sexiest signings, adding the combination of Blake and Kaman to the roster quietly makes the Blazers deeper, tougher — and better — next season.\n\n\"They're both gamers, they're about winning,\" Olshey said of his newest additions. \"Beyond depth, just their experience level and their ability to impact wins. We want to bring guys in here that we know can deliver in high-pressure, high-level environments. This is a team that was in the second round of the playoffs last year and you've got to target a certain type of player to be able to compete at that level, and both these guys are in that category.\""
