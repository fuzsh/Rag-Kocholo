        "text": "Editor’s note: This is a periodic review of the Plumas County District Attorney’s Office activities and criminal cases, written by Plumas County District Attorney David Hollister.\n\nThank you all for your support and efforts in making Plumas County a safe and just place to live, work and play. Please accept this as an update on public safety in Plumas County and some of the cases the Plumas County District Attorney’s office is handling.\n\nWhile Plumas County remains a remarkably safe place to live, we do see an uptick in crime during the busy summer season. During our Fourth of July week we had 17 in-custody arraignments, meaning the defendants were arrested on more serious crimes and were not released from custody by citation, bail or pretrial release prior to their first court appearance. In a normal week we would see about five of these arraignments. Crimes included brandishing a firearm, domestic violence, drug offenses, arson, driving under the influence causing injury and the like.\n\nThe increase in new cases is already impacting our regular criminal court calendars. A normal Friday calendar, addressing felonies, would have 20 – 25 cases heard. On Friday, July 12, our felony calendars included 57 cases. Among these cases were felony assault, theft of prescription drugs from an assisted care facility, kidnapping, residential burglary, felony domestic violence, drive-by shooting, arson of an inhabited structure and felony stalking.\n\nI am exceptionally appreciative of the efforts of and collaboration between all our law enforcement partners. During these last few weeks there have been countless hours of meetings, briefings and coordinated efforts with the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office, California Highway Patrol, U.S. Forest Service, California Department of Fish and Wildlife and many other agencies. This willingness to go above and beyond to make sure law enforcement is at the top of their game during this busy, often chaotic, time demonstrates a true dedication to serving the public.\n\nIn addition, the staff at the jail, led by Commander Steve Clark, has done an exceptional job dealing with everything from mentally ill and violent inmates to having a transportation van hit by a drunk driver on the way to court.\n\nIn addition to our work with law enforcement partners, I could not be more thankful for our criminal justice partners and their professionalism. While we may disagree on certain issues and/or cases, the efforts by our Plumas County Superior Court judge and his staff, the criminal defense bar and the DA’s office demonstrates a collective dedication to seeing justice is served despite staffing shortages and increased caseloads. The fact that our court, DA’s office and defense bar continue to be able to provide sound, professional and collegial legal efforts during very busy and stressful court calendars demonstrates a level of trust and is a credit to all involved and a true benefit to the citizens of Plumas County.\n\nFollowing, please find a sampling of recent case summaries. Space does not allow the updating of all pending or recently concluded cases. The following updates involve cases in which we have received requests for information. Should you have a question about the status of a case, please do not hesitate to contact the DA’s office directly by email or phone.\n\nFelon in possession of a firearm and LSD – People v. Kenneth Strong\n\nOn June 28, 2024, Kenneth James Strong, 35, a transient from Idaho, was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. While patrolling the Rainbow Family of Living Light gathering in the Antelope Lake area, Forest Service officers stopped a car for reckless driving. Strong was the passenger. During a joint investigation between the Forest Service and sheriff’s office, LSD, shotguns and rifles were located and determined to be possessed by Strong. Strong is scheduled to be sentenced July 26, 2024, when it is expected he will be sentenced to 16 months in state prison. Forest Service Law Enforcement Officer Mike Smathers and Plumas County Sheriff’s Deputy Dalton Johns did an excellent job coordinating and conducting this joint jurisdiction investigation.\n\nChild neglect – People v. Michael Ontiveros\n\nOn May 24, 2024, Michael J. Ontiveros, 38, of Greenville, was convicted of felony child abuse. Later, on July 5, 2024, Ontiveros was placed on four years of formal probation. Terms of his probation included serving 270 days in jail and attend a 52-week child abuse class. Ontiveros had been arrested following an incident in which his 7-year-old son accessed and ate LSD-laced sugar cubes out of his freezer. The child was treated in the emergency room and suffered no lasting injuries. Both Detective Christina Vickrey and Deputy Chandler Dale were instrumental in this investigation.\n\nDomestic violence – People v. Richard Kiszka\n\nOn June 21, 2024, Richard Peter Kiszka, 40, of Blairsden, was convicted felony domestic violence. Kiszka was arrested following a February 2024 incident where he assaulted his spouse in front of their 11- and 3-year-old children, leaving a black eye and significant bruising on her face, arms, neck and chest. On July 12, 2024, Kiszka was sentenced to three years in state prison and ordered to stay away from the victim for 10 years.

Richard Alvey\n\nOn May 10, 2024, Richard Thomas Alvey, 36, of Quincy, was convicted of felony elder abuse. On February 29, 2024, a Plumas County deputy was dispatched to a Cedar Street residence in Quincy concerning a disturbance and threats. Upon arriving, the deputy observed Alvey holding a knife to the 68-year-old victim’s neck. The deputy was able to immediately detain and disarm Alvey prior to conducting his investigation. Alvey was sentenced July 12, 2024, to three years in state prison. Deputy Blake Mathews did an exceptional job responding, controlling the scene and keeping all parties safe while cover officers arrived.\n\nRestaurant break-in – People v. Christina Ward\n\nOn June 27, 2024, Christina Janee Ward, 30, of Greenville, was arrested for felony commercial burglary. Ward is alleged to have entered the La Nacho Mama Restaurant in East Quincy during the overnight hours of June 26 where she stole cash from the register, a purse and beer. This case was quickly investigated by Sgt. Robbie Gott who was able to locate and arrest Ward the next day. At the time of the burglary, Ward had other pending cases. Ward is currently in custody and will next be in court Aug. 2, 2024, for a pretrial conference.\n\nDrive-by shooting – People v. Christian Governor\n\nOn April 8, 2021, an unknown person(s) drove by a residence on Pioneer Road in Quincy and fired a number of shots at the house and a car parked nearby. Nobody was hurt during the shooting nor was an assailant identified. The Plumas County Sheriff’s Investigation Division, led by Sgt. Steve Peay, then engaged in long and in-depth investigation utilizing search warrants and DNA typing, among other tools, to locate the perpetrator. On Aug. 3, 2023, Christian Raymond Governor, 24, formerly of Reno, Nevada, was charged with two felony counts of shooting at an inhabited dwelling and shooting at an unoccupied vehicle. Governor remains in custody with a future court date of July 26, 2024.\n\nEleven-hour manhunt – People v. Christopher Hale-Goodson\n\nOn June 6, 2024, Christopher Adam Hale-Goodson, 41, of Westwood, was arrested after an incident where he drove to Plumas County after threatening his ex-girlfriend and her father. The Plumas County Sheriff’s Office was able to intercept Hale-Goodson, whereupon he led deputies on a car chase and then a pursuit on foot. Hale-Goodson was at large for 11 hours prior to his arrest. On July 12, 2024, Hale-Goodson was convicted of felony evading and is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 30, 2024. This apprehension was the result of excellent teamwork by the sheriff’s office, CHP and Fish and Wildlife with Deputies Mahon, Peay, Mathews and Johns ultimately locating and arresting Hale-Goodson in a brushy area off Highway 70 near Butterfly Valley Road.\n\nArson at Lake Davis – People v. Evan MacMillan\n\nOn July 3, 2024, Evan Anders MacMillan, 36, of Reno, was arrested for felony arson of another’s property and two misdemeanor drug offenses for possessing methamphetamine and fentanyl after he was found to have set a Forest Service sign on fire at Lake Davis. When the deputy arrived, MacMillan appeared under the influence of a drug, was using lighter fluid to expand the fire he had started and was attempting to use a hammer to break the nozzle off of a propane canister. Fortunately, Deputy Bjorn Berg responded quickly and was able to apprehend MacMillan and control the fire before any greater damage could occur. MacMillan remains in custody and will return to court Aug. 16, 2024.\n\nTheft of copper wire – People v. Donald Neilson\n\nOn June 17, 2024, Donald Lee Neilson, 43, of Reno, was arrested for felony grand theft of copper wire. Neilson was located trying to free his Jeep from Union Pacific railroad tracks by a long tunnel near Chilcoot. Deputy Hermann and CHP Officer Wilmer sped to the scene to assist as they had been notified a long freight train was headed in that direction and might not have the necessary space to stop before hitting the Jeep. Fortunately, the train was able to stop before a collision. While assisting the driver, Neilson, Hermann and Wilmer noticed a large spooled pile of copper wire. A subsequent investigation uncovered the fact that the wire had been removed from the train tunnel, causing some $60,000 in damage. On July 12, 2024, Neilson was convicted of felony grand theft of copper wire and possessing a destructive device. Neilson will return to court Aug. 30, 2024, for sentencing.\n\nSheriff’s association embezzlement – People v. Cassandra Lavley\n\nOn April 12, 2024, Cassandra Beth Lavley, 39, of Quincy, was arrested on a felony complaint. The criminal complaint accuses Lavley of committing three felonies: two counts of embezzlement and one count of fraudulent alteration of books. The crimes are alleged to have occurred during 2022 and 2023 and involve Lavley, a Plumas County sheriff’s dispatcher, embezzling funds within her capacity as the secretary/treasurer of the Plumas County Sheriff’s Employee’s Association. The investigation, headed by Assistant District Attorney Graham Archer and District Attorney Investigator Shawn Adams, alleges Lavley embezzled over $20,000 from the association’s general account and needy kids account, which houses fundraising proceeds used by the association to provide gifts for children in need at Christmas time. She allegedly used the money for purchases such as concert tickets, designer clothing, furniture, televisions, a mattress, alcohol and food. On April 16, 2024, Lavley was released from custody on her own recognizance and with an order she not be in a fiduciary position. Lavley is next scheduled to appear in court Aug. 2, 2024, for a pretrial conference.\n\nEmbezzlement of Bucks Lake firefighters’ funds – People v. Jeffery Iversen\n\nOn Dec. 16, 2022, Jeffery Michael Iversen, 64, now of Florida, was charged in a one-count criminal complaint with felony embezzlement. Iversen is alleged to have embezzled $302,395.70 from Bucks Lake Fire Department Inc. and Bucks Lake Volunteer Firefighters Inc. A preliminary examination was held Nov. 3, 2023, where the judge found sufficient evidence for Iversen to be tried on the charges. Iversen’s motion to dismiss the case was denied Jan. 5, 2024. The matter is now set for Aug. 2, 2024, for the assignment of a visiting judge and to confirm a jury trial date.\n\nHR conflict of interest – People v. Nancy Selvage\n\nOn Nov. 16, 2023, a three-count criminal complaint was filed against Plumas County Human Resources Director Nancy Louise Selvage, 68, of Quincy, stemming from a May 2022 incident where she is alleged to have negotiated and recommended a 43% pay raise on behalf of both herself and the county. The criminal investigation occurred over many months, drawing additional focus after the Plumas County Civil Grand Jury published its 2022-23 report. A preliminary hearing was held April 9, 2024, where the Honorable Raymond Giordano found sufficient evidence for Selvage to be bound over for trial. A motion to dismiss the charges was withdrawn by the defense and the matter is now set for Aug. 9, 2024, to confirm a proposed November jury trial date.\n\nThere is a great deal of promise and hope for all who live, work and play in Plumas County — it continues to be a spectacular place on many levels.
