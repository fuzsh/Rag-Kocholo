        "text": "This was expected to be the case, but it remained to be confirmed.\n\nAs reported by the Blazers, Steve Blake has signed his player options worth $2,1 million and will continue with the Portland franchise for one more season.\n\nAt 35 years old, the point guard has chosen to play it safe and not expose himself to a market where it is most likely that he would have ended up signing a contract for a lower value than the current one."
