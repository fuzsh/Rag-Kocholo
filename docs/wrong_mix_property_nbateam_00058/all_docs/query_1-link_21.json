Blake, 34, has averaged 6.9 points, 2.2 rebounds and 4.0 assists with Washington, Portland, Milwaukee, Denver, L.A. Clippers, L.A. Lakers and Golden State. “Steve is the consummate gamer,” said Olshey. “His natural leadership skills, ability to run a team and offensive skill set are a natural fit for our roster composition and style of play.”\n\nBlake returns to the Trail Blazers for a third time during his NBA career after playing in Portland during the 2005-06 season and again from 2007-10. He signed with Portland as a free agent on each occasion, and was last traded from Portland on Feb. 16, 2010, in a deal that also sent Travis Outlaw to the Clippers in exchange for Marcus Camby.\n\nIn 269 games (232 starts) over four seasons with the Trail Blazers, Blake holds averages of 8.9 points, 2.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists. He notched career highs of 11.0 points per game and a 42.7 percent mark from 3-point range in 2008-09, his last full season with Portland. “Steve is the perfect fit for our team,” said Trail Blazers Head Coach Terry Stotts. “He brings experience, toughness, leadership, shooting and consistent defense. Steve will be a complement to our backcourt and provide mentorship for our young players.”\n\n​Blake (6-3, 172) played four years at the University of Maryland and was selected by the Wizards with the ninth pick in the second round (38th overall) of the 2003 NBA Draft.

Schlueter is the 1st Blazer player to return to team. While he was cut before the 1977/78 season began, Dale came back to finish out the season after injuries decimated the front line. He re-signed with team on March 25 and retired at conclusion of the regular season as he was not included on the playoff roster.\n\n1996\n\nThe Blazers trade Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant to Washington Bullets for Rasheed Wallace.\n\nJuly 17\n\nJuly 17\n\nJuly 19\n\n1994\n\n​\n\nBill Schonely and Eddie Doucette swap positions as Schonz moves back behind the radio mic, replacing Doucette, who moves to the TV side.\n\nJuly 20\n\n1991\n\n​The Blazers 3rd annual Slam 'N Jam event was held to raise money for Ramon Ramos, who was injured in a car accident on Dec. 16, 1989.

Adelman had a career year during the Blazers inaugural season, statistically speaking, scoring a career-high 1023 points and grabbing 282 rebounds, numbers he wouldn't top again. Adelman also passed for 380 assists, a career-high until the 1971/72 season when he passed for 413 assists.\n\nJuly 30\n\n1979\n\n​Jack McKinney leaves to coach the Lakers\n\nJuly 31\n\n1972\n\nThe Blazers started the day with two former NBA Rookie-Of-The-Year Award winners and ended the day with a third. The Blazers acquired 6'5\" forward Fred Foster from the Philadelphia 76ers for a 1973 2nd round draft pick and $5000 cash. Foster played 74 game with Philadelphia, where he averaged 11.9 points and 3.7 rebounds for the 76ers in the 1971/72 season. Instead of hoping a plane to Portland, Foster instead was traded by Portland to Detroit Pistons for Terry Dischinger, the player who won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in the 1962–63 season. ​\n\nDischinger was the first pick of the second round (#8 overall) by the Chicago Zephyrs in the 1962 NBA draft and had an immediate impact in the NBA, as he averaged 25.5 points and 8.0 rebounds despite playing only 57 games. \"During my rookie year I wanted to obtain my Chemical Engineering degree from Purdue, so Chicago let me attend school and play on weekends and holidays.\" Dischinger recalled. \"One time after class I left Purdue at 4 PM, taped my ankles in a cab and played that night in San Francisco. It wasn't that tough of a year because I received my degree, the rookie of the year award, and was paid to play the game I loved.\" Dischinger was named rookie of the year over four future Hall of Famers, whom he joined on the 1962–63 NBA All-Rookie Team: Zelmo Beaty, Dave DeBusschere, John Havlicek and Chet Walker.\n\nAfter his rookie season the Zephyrs moved to Baltimore, Maryland and became the Baltimore Bullets (today's Washington Wizards). In his second season, Dischinger averaged 20.8 points and 8.3 rebounds as Baltimore finished 31–49 under Hall of Fame Coach Leonard. Dischinger playing alongside future Hall of Famers Walt Bellamy and Rod Thorn, as well as Kevin Loughery, Gene Shue and Sihugo Green.\n\nDischinger attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana from 1959 to 1962, where he was also a member of the 1960 USA men's basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics under head coach Pete Newell. Dischinger, who was 19 years old and finishing his sophomore year of college, was the youngest member of the team. As a starting guard/forward, he was teamed with future Basketball Hall of FamersOscar Robertson, Jerry West, and Jerry Lucas. The team was named to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. He started all 8 games, scoring 90 total points, with an 11.3 points-per-game average as the fourth-leading scorer on the team. \"It was a fairy tale because I played with my idol, Oscar Robertson. The experience made me a much better player.\" said Dischinger.\n\nDischinger retired after his single season in Portland and attended dental school in Memphis Tennessee. Following his completion of school in Tennessee, Dischinger returned to Portland and begin an orthodontic practice in Lake Oswego. My younger son Brennen was seen by Dr. Dischinger in the early 90's after he lost his front tooth due to an accident with a swing set. My wife Shellie was unaware of who the dentist was initially but filled me in on his office when she returned home. A video of his office can be seen at the link below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BSmCBNgJn8"
