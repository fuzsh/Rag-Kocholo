        "text": "If the Lakers wanted to leave the end of Game 2 in Oklahoma City behind them, it wasn’t made any easier by people getting nasty toward Steve Blake, who missed the team’s last shot while down by one point.\n\nBlake’s wife, Kristen, posted to her Twitter account one message that said, in part: “I hope your family gets murdered.”\n\n“It’s pretty disappointing,” Steve Blake said Thursday. “There’s a lot of hateful people out there.”\n\nBlake said he has gotten plenty of support within the team for his missed shot. For his part, he said it was “time to move on” and “make up for it.”\n\nKobe Bryant said, “Of course!” in response to a question Thursday about whether he wanted to take that last shot. But he also agreed with a reporter, saying Metta World Peace made a “sound decision” to pass to the more open Blake.\n\n“Nobody else was open,” World Peace said. “Steve was the only one open. … I trust everybody on our team.”\n\nAfter watching the replay several more times, Lakers coach Mike Brown wavered from his postgame take that Bryant was “wide-open” on the far side of the court on the play. Brown said Thursday that World Peace “made the right decision” despite pointing out that perhaps Andrew Bynum could’ve been fed as he cut toward the basket in the paint, having gotten in front of Kendrick Perkins."
