        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Brandon Roy scored 23 points and matched his career high with 12 assists, and the Portland Trail Blazers held off the Los Angeles Lakers 112-103 on Tuesday night.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge had 22 points and 11 rebounds for Portland, which snapped a five-game losing streak. Channing Frye had a season-high 22 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nThe loss snapped a four-game winning streak for the Lakers, fighting to finish atop the Pacific Division. They need three wins -- or three Phoenix losses -- to take the division for the first time since 2004. The Suns beat the Memphis Grizzlies 127-113 earlier Tuesday night.\n\nThe Blazers led by as many as 18 points in the second half.\n\nThe Lakers pulled to 102-93 with 3:39 to go on Vladimir Radmanovic's 3-pointer. Free throws from Sasha Vujacic and Pau Gasol narrowed it to 102-96.\n\nAfter Travis Outlaw made a layup for Portland, Radmanovic hit a 3-pointer to make it 104-99.\n\nKobe Bryant's layup got the Lakers within three points, but Roy answered with his own layup and free throw with 44 seconds left to keep Portland ahead 106-101.\n\nGasol hit a pair of free throws, but the Lakers could not catch up.\n\nBryant finished with 34 points, while Gasol had 21 points and 13 rebounds. It was the Lakers' sixth straight loss at the Rose Garden.\n\nLamar Odom was called for a technical foul in the contentious game after his hard hit on Roy as he was driving to the basket with 30 seconds left in the third quarter.\n\nRoy went down and winced in pain as the teams started jawing at each other. Blazers coach Nate McMillan rushed on to the court to help Roy, while Bryant argued the call.\n\nRoy made both technical shots, giving the Blazers an 87-71 lead, then left to the locker room. He returned with about 10 minutes left in the game.\n\nThe Blazers were still without starter Martell Webster, who was examined for an irregular heartbeat after he was briefly hospitalized with dizziness and flu-like symptoms last week.\n\nPortland was coming off a 72-65 loss to San Antonio on Sunday. Portland center Joel Przybilla broke his hand on the rim during the game, and he was replaced in the starting lineup against the Lakers by Frye.\n\nEliminated from the playoffs, the Blazers were still trying to finish with a winning record for the first times since the 2002-03 season.\n\nThe Blazers led all of the first half, going up 49-40 on Aldridge's jumper from the corner with 2:23 to go. Portland extended it to 56-45 on Jarrett Jacks' two free throws with 42 seconds left.\n\nThe Blazers led 58-47 at the half.\n\nPortland went up 77-61 in the third quarter on Steve Blake's 3-pointer. But the Lakers answered with a 10-0 run orchestrated by Bryant that closed Los Angeles to 77-71.\n\nThe Lakers, coming off a 114-92 victory in Sacramento, were without Luke Walton, who missed his second straight game for the Lakers because of a strained right hamstring."
