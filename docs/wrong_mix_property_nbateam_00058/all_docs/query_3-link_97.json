He was helped to the locker room.\n\nThe Lakers initially reported the injury was not serious and Nash was able to play. But just 1:16 into the second half it was clear he was struggling and he headed back to the locker room.\n\nThe exact nature of the injury was not known. Nash was replaced by Steve Blake.\n\nNash had two points and four assists against the Blazers."
