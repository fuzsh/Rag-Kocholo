        "text": "Blake’s family was threatened after the shooting guard missed a potential go-ahead three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left in Game 2, a two-point Lakers loss. Brown teared up when asked about the threats before Game 3, calling them “a doggone shame.” “That gets me emotional right now,” Brown said. “I just feel bad for his family, I feel bad for him. That shouldn’t be a part of life, to have somebody want to do stuff like that or attack your family, your kids. I don’t like that.” Blake’s wife, Kristen, tweeted her gratitude Friday to those who have supported the couple. “I am deeply grateful & humbled by the outpouring of love, support, & most of all prayers for our family in light of recent events-THANK YOU!” she tweeted.\n\n“I thought it was a great play, you know my answer,” (LeBron) James said Thursday about (Steve) Blake’s shot (from last night game against the Thunder). “The person that should be very happy is Russell (Westbrook), he (got) caught peeking in the paint and left a very good shooter open. Those are the same shots Derek Fisher has hit multiple times for the Lakers. If Steve Blake makes that shot, it’s a whole different storyline.”"
