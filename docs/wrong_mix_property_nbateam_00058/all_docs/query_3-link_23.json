        "text": "By of the\n\nPortland, Ore. – Bucks coach Scott Skiles said that the Portland Trail Blazers were playing in a “different gear” than the Bucks in their 120-108 victory Wednesday night at the Rose Garden and one play at the end of the first quarter illustrated what he meant as much as anything.\n\nMilwaukee’s Luke Ridnour had made a jumper with 4.9 seconds left in the first quarter to cut Portland’s lead to 28-16, but the Blazers then in-bounded and took the ball the length of the court without resistance and guard Steve Blake sank an open 23-foot jumper at the buzzer to give Portland a 15-point lead after one quarter.\n\n“That was way too easy,” said Skiles. “That’s what I meant by them being in a different gear. Their awareness of what was going on in the game compared to our’s was somewhat frightening.”\n\nIt was another long night on the road for the Bucks who have now lost the first three games of their six-game Western trip.\n\nPortland, which led by 33 points in the third quarter, shredded the Bucks defense all night and ended up shooting 60.3% which was a season-high for a Bucks opponent and a Portland season high. Every Portland starter shot at least 60% and eight Trail Blazers scored at least nine points. Portland’s 66-46 halftime lead was their biggest lead of the season at the break and its 66 points tied a season high for either half.\n\n“We had an awful lot to do with them shooting so well,” said Skiles. “They were just in a different gear than us for most of the night, other than the first 2-3 minutes of the game. They were quicker and more athletic and they drove by us pretty much at will. (LaMarcus) Aldridge just turned and shot over us without much resistance and they built a 30-point lead and they deserved it.”\n\nSaid Portland coach Nate McMillan, “I thought it was good. I love our energy. I love what I saw with both groups tonight. I told them that’s how we want to play. That first half, we were really good. I thought throughout the game was really good. We started getting a little loose late in the ball game and they started trapping us but I loved our energy.”\n\nThe Bucks rookies had contrasting nights.\n\nBrandon Jennings had 12 points on 4-of-11 shooting with seven assists. He struggled against the bigger Portland guards such as Andre Miller.\n\nAsked what he would like Jennings to do against bigger guards, Skiles said, “Compete.\n\n“But a lot of it is learning as well. They would throw it to Andre and they would throw it back out and they’d throw it back in and Brandon was still behind him. He’s got to compete right there. He’s got to compete for that spot. But he’s 30-some games into his rookie season and that never happened to him at Oak Hill and it didn’t happen to him (in Europe). So he’s got a lot to learn from that standpoint.“\n\nJodie Meeks made 9 of 17 shots and scored 21 points and provided a lift in the first half after the Bucks had gotten off to another slow start.\n\n“Obviously, whenever you go into a game you want guys to play well and I thought Jodie did that tonight,” said Skiles. “And I thought he did in the first half when the game was still in doubt. What’s happened to us is a guy has looked like he deserves more minutes but when you go to give him more minutes, the guy you took out looks like he deserves minutes.\n\n“That’s been the nature of our team so far. But we’ll keep putting Jodie out there and give him opportunities. Obviously with the way we struggled to make shots, he’s shown the ability on any given night to make shots.”"
