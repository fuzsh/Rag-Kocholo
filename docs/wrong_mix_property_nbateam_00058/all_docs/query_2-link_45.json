        "text": "Calgary golfer Steve Blake had just finished a chemotherapy treatment before heading down to California this week to qualify for the US Senior Men’s Open.\n\nWhen he returns to Calgary on Thursday, Blake will have another treatment the following day.\n\nOn Monday, Blake, who is battling Stage 4 lung cancer, was named the first person on the tee sheet for the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic Champions Tour event at the Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from August 14 to 18, 2024. Blake received one of five sponsor exemptions in the 78-player field.\n\nBlake told media on Monday that the diagnosis eight months ago blindsided him. He said the chance to play with some of the greatest names in golf opened the door to tell his story and potentially make a difference in someone else’s life.\n\n“It’s also a great opportunity for me to represent Calgary, my community and everybody that’s been so supportive over the years,” said a tearful Blake, via livestream from California.\n\nBlake, who is also a financial advisor, received an exemption to first live out his dream and tee it up at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club in 2018. He captured the Canadian golf world’s attention by playing his way into the U.S. Senior Open earlier that summer at a qualifying event outside San Diego. Blake played alongside World Golf Hall of Fame Members including Vijay Singh, Davis Love III, Mark O’Meara, Bernhard Langer, and Colin Montgomerie.\n\n“This is going to be totally different. When I played in 2018, I was just trying not to embarrass myself and display some sort of competency in golf,” Blake said.\n\n“This time around it will be about embracing these special moments in life, absorbing the moments, and sharing the moments with my family, my friends, and my community.”\n\nReally easy to follow Blake’s lead\n\nBlake’s wife Kelly said the diagnosis was obviously a shock for the whole family. She said that Steve took it like a champ and said, “you know what, life isn’t over.”\n\n“He’s the one that gets up every day and it makes it really easy for us to follow his lead and stay positive and we have an incredible support system of our family and our incredible friends,” she said.\n\n“So, he truly is inspirational and just for him to get announced like this is just made the fight that much better for him.”\n\nShe also tipped the media off that he’s using new golf clubs. Ones that are a better fit for the toll the disease and the treatment are taking on his body. His practice rounds thus far are about dialing in the feel and distance with the new sticks.\n\nKelly said she knows her husband feels a lot of pressure to make the family proud.\n\n“We are beyond proud. So regardless of what happens, obviously we want him to win and we want him to lead, but it’s so much bigger than that at this point,” she said.\n\nTournament executive director, Sean Van Kesteren, said they were honoured to be able to provide this opportunity to Blake. Especially on Blake’s 56th birthday.\n\n“Reflecting on the story, it’s clear to me that giving one of Calgary’s top senior golfers, who needs a supportive retirement community right now, the opportunity to play in front of his friends and family is not only extremely rewarding, but supports the tournament’s mission of making a positive impact on the people in our community,” he said."
