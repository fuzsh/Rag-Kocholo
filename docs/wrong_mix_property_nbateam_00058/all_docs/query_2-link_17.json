He's handsome, healthy, has a large family and a big fortune. He's got all the things a man would want. He's self-educated and self-made, smart, caring and a tough business man. He was born and raised in Pennsylvania. He's the son of Tom and Ellen Carrington, and has a younger brother called Ben. Both his parents are dead, Ellen in a fire caused by Ben, and Tom from a heart attack in 1985.\n\nBlake learned the oil business from below the ground up, working as a rigger by day and attending college by night. In 1955, he married the very beautiful and very young Alexis Morrell. Alexis gave birth to altogether four children; Adam, Fallon, Steven and Amanda. But their marriage broke (see below in the page for further details), and in 1964 they got divorced, and Blake drove Alexis out of Denver. This effected Blake, and made him a less emotional, more ruthless man, and he had a difficult time being a single parent. Luckily, this changed, when he in 1980 got involved with his secretary, Krystle Jennings.\n\nIn 1981 (the Dynasty pilot episode) they got married, and Krystle's love and kindness changed Blake's life totally. They had a daughter, Krystina, in 1984. Through Dynasty Blake bravely fought for the good of his company and his family, refusing to ever give up. His main interest was oil, but in 1987, he also tried to run for the governor election, which he lost.\n\nThis is Krystle's description of Blake:\n\n“ You're like a man on a mountain sometimes, your mountain - and you don't want anyone to climb it with you. ”\n\nSeason one[]\n\nIn the series premiere, Blake marries his secretary Krystle Jennings. Their marriage is strained by her discomfort as she learns about Blake's ruthless side, especially in business. Blake rapes Krystle when she is reluctant to have sex with him. Blake struggles with his daughter Fallon's promiscuity and his son Steven's homosexuality. He catches his son in an embrace with another man, and in a fit of anger pushes them apart. Steven's lover falls, hits his head, and dies. Blake is arrested and charged with murder. In the season finale, a mysterious witness enters the courtroom. Visibly agitated, Blake turns to his lawyer and asks, \"What's she doing here?\"\n\nSeason two[]\n\nThe mystery witness is Blake's ex-wife, Alexis. She testifies to Blake's violent temper. He is found guilty, but given a suspended sentence. While Blake struggles to save Denver-Carrington from financial troubles, he is thrilled to learn that Krystle is pregnant. Krystle loses her baby in a horse riding accident. Blake suggests that Krystle meet with his friend, psychiatrist Nick Toscanni.\n\nLater, Blake is blinded after mobster Logan Rhinewood bombs his car. Blake suspects that Krystle is having an affair with Nick, so after his sight returns he continues to feign blindness in order spy on her. In the season finale, he confronts Nick. The men are on horseback, and Blake is thrown from his horse. Nick leaves him unconscious on the ground.\n\nSeason three[]\n\nKrystle finds Blake and gets him to help. Blake learns that Fallon's son, his namesake \"Little Blake\" has been kidnapped.\n\nBlake and Alexis make a televised plea for the return of their kidnapped infant grandson L.B. Colby. While on the air, Alexis confesses a dark secret from their past: their firstborn son, Adam, had been kidnapped as a baby and never recovered. Traumatized by the event, they had hidden his existence from their subsequent children Fallon and Steven. Weeks later, an attorney from Billings, Montana, approaches Blake and claims to be Adam. Blake does not believe him, but eventually accepts him as his son - especially when Alexis does.\n\nBlake learns that Krystle's divorce from her first husband was never official. He and Krystle are going through a bad patch and they separate. Blake learns that Steven is missing and presumed dead in an oil rig explosion. He refuses to believe that Steven is dead. When Steven's ex-wife appears with a baby that she says is Steven's, Blake offers to keep the child. Later, he learns that Steven is alive. He flies to Singapore to convince him to return to Denver. In the third season finale, Blake learns that Steven is living with another man. Blake decides to sue for custody of his grandson.\n\nSeason four[]\n\nBlake loses his custody fight when Steven marries Claudia Blaisdel. However, they reconcile when Blake and Krystle remarry. But Alexis is still seeking for revenge and enlists Rashid Ahmed in order to sabotage a deal he has with Blake. Blake is broken.\n\nIn the meantime, Fallon, who was suffering from severe migraine, runs away before her second wedding with Jeff and is caught in a car accident. Blake is devastated.\n\nSeason Five[]\n\nBlake manages to save his company but he mourns the death of his daughter, Fallon. Blake also learns that he has an illegitimate half-sister, Dominique.
