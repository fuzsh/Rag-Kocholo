        "text": "I’ve been deeply entrenched in NBA fandom since my earliest days. I remember as a child I would lay on the living room floor with a bucket full of popcorn watching the Blazers battle their opponents. I also latched onto NBA video games at an early age, playing through titles like NBA Shootout and, more notably, NBA Live 2003 (which I still own to this day). I’ve always loved the idea of a single player campaign in NBA games but I had a hard time getting into NBA 2K11.\n\nMy most recent experience, prior to my time with 2K15, was with 2K14. Aside from the Jackson Ellis rivalry, I found the mode to be interesting. I started out as a shooting guard, hoping to get selected by the Portland Trail Blazers. Indeed, I did get an interview with Portland, who told me that they would select me in the first round. I did go in the first round but Portland passed me up in favor of CJ McCollum. I went eleventh overall to the Philadelphia 76ers, who drafted the real ROTY in 2013-2014. Magically, the 76ers were still able to get Carter-Williams, creating a pretty dangerous young core of Noel, MCW, and myself. Even with a pretty entertaining premise and execution, I felt underwhelmed by my asshole teammates who either wanted to demote me to their sidekick (Evan Turner) or bitch (Jason Richardson). Then there were the extremely repetitive conversations with the GM, who kept bringing up a specific employee’s birthday. The damned bastard must have turned 100 before I finished my first year. Bring in the fact that only a select few players were voiced (namely, Lebron James and fictional Jackson Ellis) while the others were subtitled and you get a potential-filled mode that requires a lot of polish.\n\nFor all the shit that sports games get for annual releases, NBA 2K15 did a surprisingly good job at paying an ear to criticism. Jackson Ellis’ role was minimized, real NBA players were brought into voice mentors for each team, and teammates functioned substantially more, well, like teammates. We’ll start off focusing on 2K’s decision to take Ellis down a notch. The previous 2K14 was all about getting drafted high and competing with Ellis, who also maintained a high profile as a rookie. 2K15 went for a lower profile by forcing you to go undrafted regardless of what you do. I was skeptical of this decision at first but after having played it, I can say with confidence that it’s far more engaging than its 2014 counterpart. No longer are you at the mercy of a team to hold up their end of interview-based promises. Rather, you can tryout for essentially any team that you like. Tryout difficulties vary by team with some teams requiring a mediocre performance during your scrimmage and others demanding as close to perfection as possible.\n\nPortland was surprisingly hard to try out for at small forward. I needed to get a Teammate Grade of A- or better. The first time I tried, I failed. Defeated, I went on to try out for the Detroit Pistons, who brought me on. That’s not the play-through I want to highlight though because that ended with me leaving Detroit in disgrace, going to New York, and immediately demanding a trade to Portland.\n\nHere’s where I give my first tip:You cannot play the scrimmage again once you complete it and, in some cases, failure can mean a team losing any interest in you whatsoever for the entire season and the upcoming free agency. My first playthrough resulted in Portland have 0% interest in me despite a stellar rookie season and bringing the Pistons from the East Conference cellar to a tense playoff series with the Cavaliers. Anyway, you can restart as many times as you like. I used that to my advantage to make it onto the Blazers roster with a ten-day contract. My first couple weeks with the Blazers were marvelous. Sure, the GM intimidated me with the shape-up-or-get-out nature of the ten-day contract but I was immediately mentored by Robin Lopez, my favorite player of all time, and Arron Afflalo. Yeah, Portland had TWO fully voiced mentors. This wasn’t because 2K deemed Portland more worthy of an additional voice actor than other teams. As you may know, Arron Afflalo was traded to Portland in 2015. As a result, Portland got two voice-acted mentors while Denver has…..zero? Well shit. Better luck next year, Nuggets fans.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, teammates tend to be less irritating than last year. Rather than forcing me to wear a clown nose,carry baggage around, or pass the ball to make another player’s career, I found Lopez and Afflalo to be a lot more invested in my growth as a player. Sure, Lopez chided me for not passing the ball much during one game but he didn’t try to make me the Robin to his Batman.\n\nThe mentors make it feel a lot less like you’re hanging from a cliff by the tips of your fingers. These guys have your back and they’ll confront you about getting too worked up about a victory or loss, getting too selfish, or thinking about stats over the final score. With the support of Arron, Robin, and sizable experience playing NBA 2K games, I was welcomed back to Portland with a second ten-day contract. After some break out games, most notably a 30 point game in an overtime loss in San Antonio, I was given a full contract for the remainder of the season. Even if you get the feeling that it’d be hard to not get that contract, it’s a special moment and I relished it.\n\nFrom there, my player played his way off the bench and into the starting lineup, replacing Nicolas Batum in the process. That entire journey was peppered with press conferences and 15 second (approximately) post-game interviews with, you guessed it, Doris Burke. During those little snippets, you can react in one of two ways. Usually it’s pretty obvious which one you SHOULD choose but occasionally you’ll mix up and say something that makes you come off as an asshole. If you demand a trade, you’re going to be an asshole. I’m sorry. I did it in New York and I could see the GM’s dreams just die in front of his eyes. The dialogue went something like this:\n\n“Is there any way we could convince you to stay?”\n\n“No way! I hate this city! Get me outta here!”\n\nSo maybe I ad-libbed a little bit but it was pretty funny. Needless to say, the dialogue in the game could be a little more fleshed out (maybe with a Mass Effect renegade option throw in as well?). Do keep in mind though that the choices you make in dialogue can affect team chemistry and that CAN affect how things go on court.\n\nWhen I first came to Portland, which was roughly around the time of the All-Star Game, the Blazers were in fifth place in the Western Conference. As April rolled around, Portland rose to second place in the West, only a couple games behind the Spurs. Everything was going just great for Rip City, right?\n\nWrong. Rip City got rocked by some drama emanating from guess who? Yours truly. I left his cell phone out in the locker room after discussing free agency options with my agent. Being more of a snoop than TMZ, Arron Afflalo fished through my texts and exposed the discourse to the public. Because Portland has two mentors, my game kind of glitched out and while Arron found the phone, Robin later took credit for finding it. Maybe they were working together? The whole debacle actually isn’t as bad as it could have been. With the exception of a couple questions during press conferences and a discussion with a GM, the whole situation doesn’t make a particularly large impact on your game if you don’t let things spiral out of control by being an asshole.\n\nThe drama didn’t throw off Rip City’s game at all. The race for first in the West went down to the wire with the last game being the decider. We won our matchup with Dallas and therein nabbed Portland a first seed it hadn’t seen since I was born in 1992.\n\nLeading into my alternate reality of how the playoffs went down, there are a couple things I should mention. First, the Los Angeles Clippers did not qualify largely due to a season-ending injury that Chris Paul suffered earlier in the season. Second, while Golden State entered the playoffs in third place against a sixth place Dallas, they too lost their leading point guard with an unplayable injury. Needless to say, they lost to a healthier Texan team but fought hard with a seven game series.\n\nPortland had to face Oklahoma City and cover athlete Kevin Durant, who talked trash prior to our series. Outside of a well fought fourth game, Kevin Durant and the Thunder were all bark and no bite. While not sweeping them, we eliminated the Thunder 4-1 and moved on to my least favorite team, the Houston Rockets.\n\nBecause Houston didn’t have Kevin Durant, there wasn’t any trash talking which I found kind of disappointing. I found Houston to be a lot easier to handle since their stars were at center and shooting guard rather than small forward. I exploited that matchup heavily and, dare I say, rocketed to the top of scoring leaders in the post season. As in the real life series in 2014, Houston was eliminated by Portland. This time, it was done in four games.\n\nThe next match-up really excited me. Portland would now go face-to-face with previous number one, San Antonio. We’d only played them once after I was signed and we lost. Would our late season surge mean nothing against a team that made its name through experience and postseason success? Unfortunately, San Antonio didn’t give me much of a challenge. Kawhi Leonard choked in almost all of our matchups, leading to Portland winning the Western Conference for the first time since 1992 and San Antonio being swept in God knows how long. As with Houston, there were no trash talkers to be found here.\n\nWith little surprise, I found that my finals match-up was with Cleveland. Chicago had been first in the East but guess what happened to them? Yeah, they lost Derrick Rose and had Jimmy Butler playing through an injury of his own. They managed to eliminate the Raptors with a sweep……somehow. They weren’t quite as fortunate when matched up with the Pacers, however.\n\nThere was no love lost for the Cavaliers here; we made short work of them. Lebron didn’t play bad per se but he wasn’t the Lebron you’d expect during the playoffs. At long last, the Blazers hoisted the Larry O’Brien trophy for the first time since 1977.\n\nWhile the celebrations from round to round were relatively underwhelming for the most part, the championship celebration was really special. For me, the highlights of our victory celebration were Wesley and Dame hugging it out and raising both the Larry O’Brien trophy and my own personal Bill Russell Award. Following the game, I had a moment with Arron in the locker room. He said he was proud of me, we fist bumped and went on to enjoy our respective off seasons.\n\nWhile some NBA games could have called it quits there, 2K15 took it a step further and allowed players to experience free agency in all its glory and drama. To start off the experience, you get to choose three teams that your agent will focus on. You can choose other teams after that but this just allows for some better contracts and all that. I chose Portland at number one and would have been content with just that but I had to choose three. The other two teams I chose were Golden State because I have family down there and New Orleans because that’s just a fantastic city in general.\n\nBefore you make any decisions, you get two visitors. One visitor is from another team and that could really be any mentor from another team. The other is a mentor from your team trying to convince you to stay. It’s a classic LaMarcus Aldridge situation…sigh. In my situation, Brandon Knight tried to recruit me to the Suns to no avail. My bro Robin Lopez visited a short time later trying to keep me in Rip City, to which I quickly agreed. I made it official by signing a three-year contract to stay with Rip City.\n\nThat’s the main bulk of the plot for NBA 2K15‘s MyCareer rookie season. There is one last thing I want to touch on though. One of the big reasons, beside the fact that it’s just fun as hell, that I kept coming back to this mode was the particularly tumultuous off-season the real Portland Trailblazers had. This game was there for me during a pretty hard time where I had to say goodbye to not one but four starters I’d come to know and love. It sounds petty but this last summer was one of my hardest. My family is full of die hard Blazers and when Rolo, L-Train, and Wes left, it was like a series of relatives died. Needless to say, this was a good escape for me. In this world, the Blazers weren’t falling apart but succeeding. This offseason resulted in Wesley Matthews leaving for the New York Knicks and Chris Kaman returning to the Los Angeles Lakers. I don’t need to tell you that it beats what happened out in the real world.\n\nIn conclusion, I’d recommend this to any sports gamers as well as gamers who happen to be sports fans. This is a must buy for Oregonian gamers….assuming they’re not traitors who root for the Lakers. This is an incredibly immersive experience for a sports game, breaking stereotypes set in the past and creating a mold that other franchises hopefully follow.\n\nWhen I first heard of “Bojack Horseman,” the main draw for me was Aaron Paul. I’d just come off of binge-watching “Breaking Bad” like the rest of America and I needed me some more Jesse Pinkman. I mean seriously, watch this (only if you have either watched through Season 3 of “Breaking Bad” or don’t really have an interest in the show). All that being said, I didn’t necessarily have an immediate connection with the idea of the show or even Will Arnett.\n\nWhat I ended up getting with Season I of “Bojack Horseman” was anything but what I expected. It was a unique package, an animated show which didn’t reset to zero after every episode, had deep characters, and some intensely painful moments. At the center of these selling points is the titular character, who is a self-loathing former star from a 90s Sitcom known as “Horsin’ Around.” Rather than sticking to old cliches like alcoholism (don’t get me wrong, Bojack IS an alcoholic), the show delves into showing rather than just telling when it comes to his flaws. This best summed up by what Bojack’s former best friend, Herb Kazzaz, who tells him that while he wants to be the “good guy,” he’d be much more at peace if he accepted that he was, in actuality, a self-centered scumbag.\n\nBojack Horseman really is a scumbag. He essentially turns on his best friend because of his fanbase’s homophobia (Herb Kazzaz is outed as gay during his time as a producer on “Horsin’ Around). He also tries to seduce numerous married women as well as the daughter of an old friend, and sabotages a friend’s rock-opera to keep him dependent on him. Bojack takes on a similar role to characters in literature that we’re forced to root for that, on paper, are questionable or outright terrible people. What enables people like me to root for Bojack is because he’s not just a two-dimensional, alcoholic dickwad. He shows flashes of being good and the problems he does have in life show seem to emanate from a really terrible life at home with two abusive, neglectful parents.\n\nBojack’s assortment of friends and companions, for the most part, have depth. Todd Chavez seems to be just a zany, lazy stoner but he shows himself to be one of the most stable characters on the show. No matter how much Bojack hurts him, he remains his friend though after the rock opera incident, he does distance himself a bit. Mr. Peanutbutter, Bojack’s frenemy, starts out as a relatively shallow character. In the first season, I rooted for Diane Nguyen, Bojack’s one-sided love interest, to break it off with Mr. Peanutbutter. Nonetheless, Diane becomes Mrs. Peanutbutter and season II actually features a pretty compelling relationship between the two. You can see that with all his flaws, Mr. Peanutbutter genuinely loves Diane and she loves him back. They fight, sure, but Mr. Peanutbutter easily overcomes the undeserving husband label in the show’s second time out. He remains the prototype Hollywood douche but one with a heart of gold which shines through a lot with his interactions with Diane and Todd.\n\nHerb Kazzaz, who I mentioned earlier, is another compelling character. He doesn’t spend a whole lot of time in the limelight compared to Todd, Diane, Princess Carolyn, Mr. Peanutbutter, or Bojack, but he leaves a huge impact on the show. Herb embodies a lot of the idealism that Bojack had in his earlier years and even as Bojack seems to descend into nihilism, Herb remains a constant, if eventually bitter, do-gooder. He acts as a great foil to Bojack. Both characters start out as promising comedians who make their names on “Horsin’ Around.” Herb’s character brings me to one of the focal points of this blog: Bojack Horseman does very well at avoiding cliched characters. Herb isn’t a flamboyant homosexual (not that there’s anything wrong with that) and he doesn’t conform to a lot of the LGBTQ stereotypes that are perpetrated through shows like “Family Guy” or “American Dad.” He’s more than witty one-liners, fashion statements, and sucking face with the same sex. He’s more than his sexuality and society’s perception of what he’s supposed to be.\n\nNow, I don’t necessarily hate Seth McFarlane or his shows. I watch “Family Guy” from time to time and I consider myself a fan of “American Dad.” I don’t think that every show needs to be measured by the examples set by “Bojack Horseman” or other shows with deep characters. That being said, for all the progressive political beliefs that Seth McFarlane has, he writes some incredibly offensive stereotypes into his show that serve little purpose. I know that’s not exactly fair, especially coming from an avid “South Park”fan. Sure, “South Park” also can play off of a lot of stereotypes but the show at least hits below the belt with everyone, be they Democrat or Republican, heterosexual or homosexual. “Family Guy” has a liberal undercurrent that seems to rip on organized religion and conservative political beliefs while also being incredibly anti-semitic and even homophobic at times.\n\nNow, Bojack Horseman doesn’t delve nearly as much into politics. The closest they get to that is the satire it does of Bill Cosby’s sexual assault allegations and even then, they portray it more as a human rights issue than a political one. Of course, the show also touches on cultural reactions to homosexuality. In that instance, the primary focus is placed on Bojack’s abandonment of Herb rather than questioning whether or not Homosexuality is inherently good or bad. I must admit, however, that there is a certain irony in the fact that Herb Kazzaz displays infinitely more dedication to the idea of family than Bojack, even in the face of homophobic outrage.\n\nOne final, important caveat to bring up when comparing “Bojack Horseman” to Seth McFarlane’s works is that “Bojack” arguably a more balanced mess of dark comedy and drama while shows like “Family Guy” are almost completely comedically oriented. This all may be comparing apples to oranges but I’d say that choosing the orange of “Bojack Horseman” can open up audiences to a much richer experience.\n\nWith a title like this, I’m sure I could inspire the wrath of thousands of Blazers fans. Before your fingers press eagerly against your keyboards to assail me and call me a fool, hear me out. My favorite Trailblazer of all time spent two years with the Blazers and, while making a huge impact on the court, will not be featured in the Blazers Hall of Fame. He’s one of the more eccentric players in the NBA, save Chris Anderson (who is a different kind of eccentric, if you ask me). I’m speaking, of course, of Robin Lopez.\n\nRobin Lopez came to Portland in 2013 with a three-way trade that cost the Blazers very little. I’d been aware of Robin Lopez prior to his arrival but I knew little more than the fact that he was Brook’s brother. Needless to say, Portland was in a pretty bad spot after coming off of its second straight season without a playoffs appearance. Morale in Rip City hadn’t been this low since the Jail Blazer era, which featured a team that not only failed to connect with its Oregonian fanbase but would occasionally insult it. Bonzi Wells, the prototype Jail Blazer, once said, “We’re not really going to worry about what the hell (the fans) think about us. They really don’t matter to us. They can boo us everyday, but they’re still going to ask for our autographs if they see us on the street. That’s why they’re fans, and we’re NBA players.” Thankfully, Portland hadn’t know that kind of NBA roster in years. In 2013, Portland was still struggling to cope with the absence of Brandon Roy, whose health wore down to such a point that he retired in 2011, only to come back for a short stint the following year.\n\nNeedless to say, I had a tabula rasa of expectations for the Trail Blazers when RoLo arrived. Like Alphaville’s “Forever Young,” I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst. That year, Portland would go on to shock the NBA by notching 54 wins and defeating the Houston Rockets in dramatic fashion in the first round. Within a few years of losing Brandon Roy, the Blazers were back to being a playoff team.\n\nThe Jail Blazers era has long been fresh on my mind and because of that, Blazer players’ interaction with their fans has been very important for me. Through his time in Portland, Robin Lopez not only showed that he appreciated Portland’s support but that he actually enjoyed and loved the city as well. He shared similar interests with Rip City, particularly in regards to books. When asked what his favorite place in Portland was, Rolo replied with Powell’s City of Books. He was even featured in a video where he visited the locally famous bookstore.\n\nRobin’s love for books even factored into his community activity as a Blazer. Often on television, I would see a commercial starting with Robin’s deep voice saying, “Do you want to be a reading super hero like me?” The commercial was a part of a campaign on behalf of Knowledge Universe and the Trail Blazers which promoted literacy among children. Those brief glimpses into the bookworm side of Rolo were quirky, funny, and,above all, sincere. You could really tell that he wasn’t just phoning in. I mean seriously, look at this guy.\n\nNot only did Robin make it clear that he was a bookworm, but he unabashedly expressed his love for comic books. In an interview with Willamette Week, Robin talked of the Teen Titans comics as well his desire to obtain a copy of Walt Disney’s Comics and Stories. Later, Robin’s affinity for comics would go beyond interviews as he would go on to show up at Portland’s Wizard Con, meeting famous stars like Stan Lee, Billy Dee Williams, Adam West, and Peter Mayhew. I narrowly missed him when I went.\n\nSo why do I love Robin? He did leave Portland, after all. To make what could be a very long blog short, Robin put all of himself into his time in Portland. He gave everything on the court and, off the court, he actually invested himself in Portland rather than just passing through. He wasn’t afraid to be a little bit weird, just like the city he played for. I do hope we’ll see Rolo back in Blazers black and red someday. Until then, I’ll be rooting for him when he comes to play in the Moda Center.\n\nOne of my favorite video game series in recent memory is Far Cry. While I now own the whole series, I didn’t exactly start at the beginning. I came to know the franchise through Angry Joe’s review of the third installment. Convinced by Angry Joe’s praise, I went out and bought the game. Far Cry III featured a lot of things I enjoyed: a beautiful open world, an interesting story, and fantastic combat. At the same time, I recognized some flaws like extremely limited NPC interaction and a kind of emptiness to the game once everything is said and done. I would often refer to the game as “Skyrim with guns” (yes, I am familiar that most would consider Fallout III to more appropriately fit that title) despite these problems. Hell, I even liked Far Cry III more in certain respects.\n\nNeedless to say, I was more than a little enthused when I heard about Far Cry IV. Now, I avoided any delusion I could have had and recognized that this title would probably bear a lot of similarities to its predecessor. For the most part, I was okay with that. What I ended up with was a game I both loved and hated.\n\nWhat I Loved\n\nA lot of the elements of Far Cry IV that I loved were the same things I enjoyed about the third game. The fictional nation of Kyrat, based on Nepal, is beautiful and expansive while at the same time distinct from the Rook Islands. Furthermore, the environment demanded different things from the player. The mountains of Kyrat introduced us to the new climbing and rappelling mechanic.\n\nOf course, with a new world to roam there is also a new set of animals to hunt. As with Far Cry III, hunting and crafting work hard in hand in really interesting ways. You start out with few weapon slots, a small wallet, and only a few pouches for grenades. As you hunt more, you’re able to carry more. There’s not a whole lot you can say for the animals here; they’re different. There’s no better or worse here. Oh…and beware of the honey badgers. They’re terrifying much like the crocodiles in Far Cry III. I swear that those crocs had it out for me. Terror, thy name is crocodile….and honey badger.\n\nI also found that I loved some of the new additions to the tried and true Far Cry formula. Getting around the map has never been so fun. Not only can you fly around these cool mini-copters (or “buzzers” as they’re called in game) but you can even use a wingsuit to glide around….or die when you try it with insufficient elevation as I did numerous times. Speaking of transportation, this game has possibly the easiest fire-from-vehicle mechanic I’ve ever played before. It’s not like GTA V, where you’ll attempt to shoot a criminal from a car and instead slaughter an entire family taking a picnic. The way it works here is that you’ll move the vehicle with your left joystick and aim with the other. It took a bit of time to get used to but once I did, I found it surprisingly easy to down other vehicles on the move.\n\nLast but not least, I have to address the co-op. It’s amazing. Unlike Far Cry III, you can actually roam around the map essentially doing whatever you want. My buddy and I would team up in taking down bases and fortresses, using sniper rifles and bows to silently pick off guards. There is a tether so you can’t just roam on opposite sides of the map doing God knows what but I honestly didn’t have an issue with that. Hell, I only noticed it one or two times. All in all, the co-op adds some depth and replayability to the overall experience of Far Cry IV.\n\nWhat I Hated\n\n{SPOILERS}\n\nFar Cry III was one of my favorite FPS campaigns, second only to the Bioshock series (or at least I and Infinite). A lot of that had to do with Vaas as the game’s villain. I still regard him as one of, if not the best villain in gaming. His pure insanity and evil helped drive a story about a vacation that went horribly wrong. As you played through the campaign, you realized more and more that you were becoming what you fought: Vaas. The closer you get to the end, the more your character thirsts for blood. Sure, there was the whole “noble savage” thing going on where you’re basically a White American saving a bunch of third-worlders. I can see where critics would tear Far Cry III a new one for not exactly considering all the racial implications there. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed THAT campaign.\n\nWith those criticisms in mind, Far Cry IV tried to make a story that could hold its own under scrutiny. Ajay Ghale was the solution to the racial problems of the third game. Unfortunately, while Ajay Ghale was born in Kyrat, he’s WHITE. It was a nice idea to make the protagonist a non-American but why not make him look more Kyrati/Nepalese? Making him a stereotype wouldn’t be better but if you weren’t reminded that Ajay was originally from Kyrat every five minutes, you wouldn’t know he was from there at all.\n\nBut that’s just a minor detail, right? Ubisoft still has an entire game to carve up another interesting plotline. They certainly tried to, anyway. The basic premise for this game is that Ajay is returning to his homeland to scatter his mother’s ashes. Ajay’s mother was involved with the dictator, Pagan Min, while his father fought for the insurgent Golden Path. And you thought you had it bad with your thanksgivings. Anyway, Ajay’s reputation precedes him. Pagan Min picks Ajay up at the airport, pretty much killing everybody else around him. After being rescued by the Golden Path, you basically are tasked with choosing how to resist Pagan Min. Will you choose to side with the progressive Amita or the traditional Sabal? Will you choose to harness the drug trade to benefit the Kyrati economy or condemn it as moral bankruptcy? On paper, making these kind of decisions would really add to the storyline. Unfortunately, these decisions are often incredibly obvious. Furthermore, the storyline doesn’t flow well at all. Basically, you strike at Pagan Min, he strikes back. None of the characters really show much depth throughout the game until the last few missions when your comrades start to bare their souls and reveal their motivations.\n\nPagan Min is meant to be a spiritual successor to Vaas but outside of his arrogant prissiness, there’s nothing more to his character. The only time that Pagan Min comes closer to Vaas is when Noore’s origin story is revealed. Noore was a humanitarian who basically blew the whistle on various human rights violations in Kyrat. After those reports, Pagan Min invited her back to help facilitate sweeping changes to human rights in the nation. He told her to bring her family with her. Once they arrived, he held the family captive and forced Noore to take charge of a gladiator arena and essentially participate in the violations she’d spoken out against. Like the protagonist of Far Cry III, Noore becomes what she hates.\n\nThe side quests in Far Cry IV are so-so. You’ll work for Willis, a racist CIA operative, Longinus, a troubled yet religious African arms dealer, Hurk, an eccentric American daredevil, and….ugh, Yogi and Reggie. Yogi and Reggie’s missions are clearly mention to mirror the drugs from Far Cry III but they do it so poorly. Rather than the high that your character gets from Far Cry III, your screen will basically turn different colors as you try to find Yogi and Reggie to get your stuff back. Their missions go the same way pretty much every time. You see Yogi and Reggie, they offer you some drugs, they prick you with an additional drug, you wake up, and you try to find them as some mildly weird stuff happens around you.\n\nFar Cry IV also tries to capture that same high through its Shangri-La missions, where you’re transported into a spirit world to fight Kyrati demons. These also work their way into the main storyline as one of Pagan Min’s lieutenants tries to harness that world’s power. These missions didn’t really draw me at all. You basically spin some prayer wheels, kill some demons, and leave. I’m pretty sure there’s some Kyrati joke about that.\n\nMy last qualm with this game is something that I took issue with regarding the third game. Once you beat the game, there’s really nothing to do. There are mini-games and plenty of map to roam but it doesn’t have the staying power that games like the Elder Scrolls do. There aren’t nearly enough side quests and, again, NPC interaction is pretty poor. I know that’s a pretty rough assessment, especially considering the fact that games like Skyrim are the exception and not the rule. However, with meaningful co-op being added to the game, there needs to be more to do than some mini-games and hunting.\n\nConclusion\n\nEven with a ho-hum plot, Far Cry IV is well worth the price it’s listed at today (according to Gamestop, it’s $39.99 new). It’s one of the best co-op experiences I’ve had for this console generation. I’d still recommend Far Cry III over this but if you’re wanting to add more to your current gen shelves, you’ll want to include this.\n\nSo heavy metal has a tendency to be a bit of a white sausage fest. While I don’t think that white, male musicians should be shamed (that would be ridiculous) I do think that minorities in heavy metal need to get a little more light shed on them. That being said, let’s kick off the best minorities in heavy metal.\n\nSingers\n\nLzzy Hale, Halestorm\n\nEthnicity: Caucasian American\n\nGender: Female\n\nThough active since 1997, Lzzy Hale has only started to gain traction the past couple years. She’s gained her fame through the band, Halestorm, which also features her brother Arejay. Lzzy stands out because she doesn’t adhere to symphonic or power metal, where a lot of female vocalists in metal make their names or follow latest -core trends. Sure, she straddles the line between hard rock and metal but she’s a lot of fun.\n\nBenji Webbe, Skindred\n\nEthnicity: Afro-Welsh\n\nGender: Male\n\nI had no idea what to think of Skindred when I first saw it. Skindred is a really interesting mixture of heavy metal and reggae. REGGAE. It’s great, if somewhat hard to get used to at first, and it gives the band staying power because it’s something you just don’t see in heavy metal. The root of Skindred’s reggae flavor is Benji Webbe. Not only has Benji Webbe led Skindred but he’s been featured with bands like Bullet For My Valentine and Soulfly.\n\nZach De La Rocha, Rage Against The Machine\n\nEthnicity: Mexican-American\n\nGender: Male\n\nI can still remember singing, “Some of those who work forces are the same who burn crosses.” Say what you will about nu metal but Rage Against The Machine is a legend in political heavy metal. One of the things that really caught my attention regarding RATM is the fury that the band genuinely has due to its political beliefs. You’re not getting this feigned or phoned-in aggression that you can get with some heavy metal groups. These guys are seriously pissed off and they express it well through their lyrics, music videos, and their political demonstrations. I mean SERIOUSLY. THE NYSE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THE BAND WAS SHOOTING ITS MUSIC VIDEO ON ITS DOORSTEP. Zach De La Rocha plays a huge part in all of that and he is, in my opinion, the ultimate nu-metal vocalist. He is what all nu-metal singers should strive to be.\n\nBrujo, Brujeria\n\nEthnicity: Mexican\n\nGender: Male\n\nBrujeria takes all of the political fury of Rage Against The Machine and mixes it in with Mexican nationalism and obscene imagery. How can you not like a band with that premise? Unlike RATM, Brujeria falls more in line with Extreme Metal than Nu Metal. It makes sense because Brujeria has featured the likes of Shane Embury and FUCKING JEFF WALKER FROM CARCASS….AS A FUCKING BASSIST! It baffles me how Juan Brujo and co were able to get guys from such big groups, let alone from England. Juan Brujo’s been doing this since 1989 and it doesn’t look like he’ll be stopping his bru-tality anytime soon.\n\nTom Araya, Slayer\n\nEthnicity: Chilean-American\n\nGender: Male\n\nCome on, does this guy really need an introduction? He’s basically the bad ass santa of heavy metal. He’s played a huge part in what is undeniably one of the best thrash bands of all time. Slayer’s still going strong despite losing Jeff Hannemann (may he rest in peace) and Dave Lombardo. Some may prefer other vocalists from the Big Four to Tom but I’ve always felt that he was the best by far….Hell, I’d say that about Slayer in general. With new stuff in the works, Tom is showing that he’s still relevant even with Slayer’s changing identity.\n\nDavid Draiman, Disturbed\n\nEthnicity: Jewish-American\n\nGender: Male\n\nSpeaking of Jeff Hanneman, David Draiman of Disturbed got into a bit of a scuffle with the deceased Slayer guitarist….more or less, anyway. Described as “defiantly Jewish” by Jpost, Draiman has gotten into several disputes with heavy metal and pop culture icons over anti-semitism. How does Jeff Hanneman factor into this? Well, both Jeff Hanneman and Lemmy Kilmister are/were collectors of Nazi-Era artifacts. Draiman’s grandparents were holocaust survivors, a theme which has carried over into “Never Again.” Since confronting Kilmister and Hanneman, Draiman has also condemned future Daily Show host Trevor Noah and Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters for antisemitism.\n\nMan, I haven’t even touched on his music yet. Draiman’s one of those singers which you hear and you’re like, “That’s David Draiman.” It’s kind of like when you hear Eminem or Kurt Cobain. Draiman has that gruff vocal style that really compliments Dan Donegan’s riffs well. Recently, Disturbed just got back together so we should be seeing some awesome stuff in the near future.\n\nAngela Gassow, formerly of Arch Enemy\n\nEthnicity: German\n\nGender: Female\n\nThis is another band where I can definitely see influences from members’ previous bands. Arch Enemy was founded by former Carcass guitarist Michael Amott. You can see a lot of similarities between the two bands, even in the vocals. Gassow bears a lot of similarities to the singing style of Jeff Walker, which is already very distinct. I also give her kudos for not falling into -core metal or into symphonic metal. I don’t have anything against the latter genre but again, there’s something to be said for going down the road less traveled.\n\nGuitarists\n\nTom Morello, Rage Against The Machine\n\nEthnicity: Sicilian/Kikuyu Kenyan American\n\nGender: Male\n\nMorello’s one of those guitarists who could really carry a song all on his own, like Buckethead or Slash. He often doesn’t, instead playing in Rage Against The Machine. He’s done some work on his own but I’d have to say that his shining works were “Killing In The Name” and “Bulls on Parade” with RATM. He also did a track for the A-Team film, which he totally could have phoned in but damn if that wasn’t the best track off of that soundtrack.\n\nSlash, Guns N Roses\n\nEthnicity: Afro-English\n\nGender: Male\n\nWhat can I say about Slash that hasn’t been said already? The guy’s reputation precedes him. He’s the reason why Guns N Roses was so rocktastic. The band’s been a shell since he left. Nuff Said.\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nEthnicity: African-American\n\nGender: Male\n\nSo it may be a bit of a stretch to label Jimi Hendrix as “heavy metal.” He was more of a precursor to the genre as he played around the time when the genre was in its infancy. Black Sabbath was just getting going around the time that Jimi passed on. Nonetheless, Hendrix established himself as arguably the best guitarist of all time. He had some pretty heavy riffs too, most notably “Foxy Lady.”\n\nDino Cazares, Fear Factory\n\nTo Be Cont’d"
