        "text": "AT THE MODA CENTER, PORTLAND\n\nWhat happened: The Detroit Pistons are one game away from their second losing streak of 10 or more games this season. The current losing skid was extended to nine. Damian Lillard dropped 28 points 9-for-12 shooting and added nine assists for good measure as the Blazers (43-20) torched the Pistons with 57.5% shooting. His consecutive triples – the last coming at the 5:47 mark of the fourth quarter – gave the Blazers a 109-89 lead and fans started heading for the exits. Andre Drummond had 16 points and 17 rebounds and Greg Monroe had 19 points for the Pistons (23-42). Reggie Jackson had 11 points and 10 assists as the Pistons moved to 1-9 since he was acquired from the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nMore Blazers: LaMarcus Aldridge added 22 points and seven rebounds and former Central Michigan standout Chris Kaman scored 15 points off the Blazers bench. Former Piston Arron Afflalo scored 15 points.\n\nUnsung hero: Center Meyers Leonard has turned into a deadly shooter and scored 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting for the Blazers. He was 2-for-3 from three-point range.\n\nTemper, temper: Blazers backup big man Joel Freeland and Pistons forward Shawne Williams got into a skirmish that forced both players to be ejected late in the game. Williams first had words with Leonard. Freeland came to his teammate's defense and the two players delivered light head butts to each other, earning their ejections.\n\nOdd line: Blazers back-up Steve Blake had seven assists – and didn't scratch in the other 14 columns of an NBA expanded box score.\n\nOverheard: \"The thing that makes me think guys care is watching them play defense. I don't really care about fighting, not fighting or anything else. I'm not mad at him, but so what?\" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said when asked if he liked to see Williams' skirmish.\n\nGot next: The Pistons conclude the four-game, five-night trip tonight when they face the Utah Jazz, winners of 9 of 12 games since the All-Star break. The Jazz has featured the league's best defense during that stretch."
