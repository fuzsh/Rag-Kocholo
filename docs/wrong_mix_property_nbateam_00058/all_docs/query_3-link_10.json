        "text": "We are all very aware Hood is coming back from an Achilles injury. We haven't been under a rock. Hood isn't ready to be playing the role they have him playing yet. He just isn't there.\n\nJulius posted that he should only be playing spot minutes while he gets back to as close as his old form as he can. He might not ever get close to that, who knows.\n\nJulius also said we should play Giles.\n\nI agreed. I said we should bench Hood, playing him only spot minutes as Julius suggested until he gets more into form. I noted the Melo/Kanter front court is not working. I noted the bench would work better with Hood benched, Melo moved to the three, and Giles to the four.\n\nNatebishop and TBpup agreed.\n\nYou decided to suggest we have no idea Hood is returning from an Achilles injury. We know. We all know. It doesn't need to be explicitly forenamed.\n\nI laid out why it's the worst team. We very well might even make the 8th seed (because obviously we need to keep Terry around). I never said the metric was wins and losses.\n\nWe haven't improved on last year at all. In fact, we look markedly worse.\n\nWe are pissing away Dame's prime.\n\nOur offense is completely built around iso and me-first basketball. Melo went almost the entire game without PASSING the ball. The defense actually looks worse than last year. The team looks selfish. Uninterested. Lost. Defeated. This is the worst Blazer TEAM I have ever seen.\n\nYes I read all that. Just can’t wrap head around critiquing Rodney Hood of all people last night and calling him lost and unconfident when it’s just because he had a horrific injury one year ago. Like all of a sudden he forgot how to play basketball.\n\nThe last 4 games were definitely bad. How many games will the Blazers win? Who knows. Playing like they have the last three to four games, probably not very many.\n\nWhat we are saying is there are several red flags here. The Blazers are playing the worst we have seen in years. The defense is worse than it was last season after adding more defensive presence.\n\nThe players look out of shape, out of mind. Neither their bodies, hearts, or heads are in the game.\n\nMaybe its just having new players. But, Blazers had new players last year and started the season far better.\n\nMaybe its just lineups. But, unfortunately Stotts won't change them until we go 0-10 or something. He likes to force it and continue to hope it will work even when it won't. He goes by who he thinks deserve the minutes by way of senority rather than what actually works and what is best.\n\nMaybe its suddenly changing to a new defensive scheme that has sidetracked the team, but it is hard to buy that is at fault. The last four games, I have not seen a team working to fit in a new scheme. I have seen lazy and selfish play along with incompatible lineups that simply aren't and won't work because of player personality and play type as well as an inability by the coach to make adjustments and adapt because he is so set on his way working or no way at all.\n\nWhat we are saying is, there are several issues here and we are concerned.\n\nTo be fair... we watched the same thing happen for three straight preseason games (one of which was against the KINGS) and then saw the exact same thing play out in the season opener.\n\nGot it... so more underachieving and selfish than anything. Appreciate the clarification.\n\nI agree with several issues to be concerned abot part. Should/could have seen some of those things before a game was even played.\n\nI was responding to the hyperbolic nature of worst ever. I would suspect after 72 games, this take won't look as strong, but it appears we all define how to measure \"worst team\" differently."
