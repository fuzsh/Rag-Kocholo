        "text": "With the association’s executive committee seeking to oust Fisher in his role as president, Lakers guards Kobe Bryant and Steve Blake both voiced support for their former teammate and his goals of hiring a law firm to conduct an independent audit to examine the union’s business practices. “What’s wrong with doing an audit?” Bryant asked. “I’m very curious about that. Extremely. We all should be.”\n\nFisher has responded to the union’s request for him to step down by repeatedly saying he does not plan on resigning from the position. In a statement released Friday night, Fisher said he will continue to strive to protect the players in the union and added the executive committee’s “has now waged a personal character attack on me to divert attention from the real issue. The truth.” Blake, the Lakers’ player representative, stood behind Fisher and stood up for his character. “All I know is Derek’s a great guy,” Blake said. “I think he was a great leader for our team, and I think he’s a great leader for the players association.”"
