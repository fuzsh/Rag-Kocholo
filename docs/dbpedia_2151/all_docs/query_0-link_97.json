        "text": "New York, NY (June 15, 2023) – On July 14, 2023, the New York Asian Film Foundation and Film at Lincoln Center will kick off the 22nd edition of the New York Asian Film Festival (NYAFF), with 60+ new and classic titles, a greatly expanded selection of short films, and an exciting slate of celebrated guests from Asia and the diaspora. The festival runs from July 14–30, 2023 at Film at Lincoln Center (FLC), with a special weekend of screenings (July 21–23) at a new venue, the historic Barrymore Film Center in Fort Lee, New Jersey, the birthplace of the motion picture industry in America.\n\n“As filmmakers from Asia continue to earn the lion’s share of top awards (and attention) on the international film festival circuit, this year’s selection shows that those are still trees hiding a forest of talent,” said Samuel Jamier, executive director of NYAFF and president of the New York Asian Film Foundation. “We are thrilled to offer a platform that is ever more culturally relevant with new films from all corners of Asia. It is a year of massive expansion for us at a time when a growing number of American filmmakers of Asian descent are conquering screens and hearts. We look forward to bringing passionate stories to passionate audiences in a city that remains a global center of film culture and business!”\n\nThe NYAFF Opening Film is the North American premiere of the unique Korean genre mashup Killing Romance, directed by Lee Won-suk. The director will be joined at Film at Lincoln Center on opening night by his lead actor, Lee Sun-kyun (Parasite, A Hard Day), who turns in an unforgettable performance as the indescribably overbearing husband of a disgraced supermodel-movie star, fully armed with his history of versatile roles in everything from art-house collaborations with Hong Sang-soo to rom-coms to his SAG Award-winning turn in Bong Joon Ho’s Parasite. Director Lee Won-suk has a rich history with NYAFF—his first film, How to Use Guys with Secret Tips, premiered at NYAFF 2013, and Lee won the Audience Award at NYAFF 2015 with his second feature, the big-budget period drama The Royal Tailor. It’s a thrill to welcome him back with his third feature.\n\nThis year’s Hong Kong Panorama, point of origin and DNA of the festival’s programming (NYAFF started off as a Hong Kong movie showcase), is an explosive cocktail of genre nostalgia and humanistic drama, drawing the contours of a road map for the future of the island’s cinema. A new 4K restoration of Patrick Tam’s 1982 Hong Kong New Wave watershed Nomad (Director’s Cut) enhances the film’s outré mix of romance and violence, and one of Leslie Cheung’s early great roles. Cutting-edge noir auteur Soi Cheang’s Mad Fate harkens back to the region’s time-honored legacy of crime films with a new sense of urgency and manic energy; Amos Why’s Everyphone Everywhere captures pandemic-era life in Hong Kong via the city’s reliance on cell phones like no other film, and has more to say on recent social shifts than hours of CNN commentary; The Sunny Side of the Street sees the incomparable Anthony Wong lending salty sympathy to new immigrants; and A Light Never Goes Out highlights the city’s iconic neon craftwork and all its storied achievements, offering a unique love letter to the island’s culture.\n\nAs previously announced, actor and producer Louis Koo, one of Hong Kong’s biggest stars, is to be honored with NYAFF’s Extraordinary Star Asia Award. Koo has more than 100 credits to his name, including sci-fi action thriller Warriors of Future, the highest-grossing Asian film of all time in the territory following its release last August. The award highlights his work as a producer and philanthropist, recognizing his many exceptional contributions to the Asian film industry, including the One Cool Group, now an industry powerhouse, and his support of award-winning work both in and outside Asia. Of the many Koo-starring films featured at NYAFF over the years, recent highlights include the White Storm trilogy, Paradox, A Witness Out of the Blue, All U Need Is Love, and his new lifesaving drama Vital Signs, which he will be on hand to introduce. NYAFF will also present the latest One Cool production, In Broad Daylight, a shocking exposé of abuse at a care home based on real events.\n\nNYAFF’s China lineup showcases novel work and a filmmaker-in-focus program/tribute to entrepreneur turned director and producer Zhang Wei, who has built a unique body of cinematic work, making the naturalistic portrayals of the marginalized in China’s rapidly changing society his signature. In the context of U.S.-China tension, and the frequent demonization of the country’s regime, showcasing his hard-hitting films The Empty Nest, Factory Boss, and The Rib (Director’s Cut) takes on a particularly acute significance; all stories focus unblinkingly on hot-button issues through unassuming characters and straightforward storylines that turn the spotlight on societal fault lines and fractures with impact far beyond the country’s borders. Making their North American premieres are Wang Chao’s A Woman, a tale both simple and sweeping in scope that chronicles the sexual and political day-to-day existence of a female factory worker during the years of the Cultural Revolution, and Liu Jian’s Art College 1994, a fond satire of student life told in his charmingly stark and sardonic animation style, made famous by his previous film, Have a Nice Day (2017).\n\nNYAFF’s bold and diverse South Korean lineup, presented with the support of the Korean Cultural Center New York (KCCNY), includes Lee Hae-young’s Phantom, an action-packed spy drama set in 1933 that is one of this year’s biggest hits in the country; the boisterous family comedy Bear Man, from Park Sung-kwang, featuring Park Sung-woong in two indelible roles; Hail to Hell, the impressive feature debut of female helmer Lim Oh-jeong, about two oddballs who track down the bully who pushed them to the brink of suicide; the rousing underdog dramedy Rebound from Chang Hang-jun, in which a group of misfits come together to play nonstop basketball for eight days straight in the KBA National Tournament; and A Tour Guide from Kwak Eun-mi, the touching and timely story of a young North Korean defector who excels at leading Chinese-language tours of Seoul but lives a maladjusted, precarious life as a stranger in a strange land.\n\nNYAFF’s Japanese lineup, supported by the Japan Foundation, is led by the North American Premiere of veteran auteur Junji Sakamoto’s audacious, aesthetically brilliant new jidaigeki, Okiku and the World, which he will be on hand to introduce. Also a must-see is the New York Premiere of Daishi Matsunaga’s heralded LGBTQ+ love story Egoist. The director will be joined on stage by leading actor Ryohei Suzuki (2015 NYAFF Audience Award winner; HK: Forbidden Super Hero; Last of the Wolves), a superstar in his native Japan, and the 2023 NYAFF Screen International Rising Star Asia honoree. A superstar of another sort, musician-actor Satoru Iguchi (King Gnu) will also be on hand at FLC for the North American Premiere of In Her Room, an otherworldly erotic tale by veteran female screenwriter Chihiro Ito (Crying Out Love in the Center of the World; Spring Snow), who makes her long-awaited directorial debut with this enigmatic love story.\n\nTokyo-based Indian director Anshul Chauhan and actor Shogen will appear with their film December, a riveting courtroom drama. Erstwhile New York City resident Takeshi Fukunaga will return with his third feature, the haunting allegory Mountain Woman, a mythic tale of female oppression and liberation starring Toko Miura (Drive My Car). Also showcased in the Japan lineup are A Hundred Flowers, the award-winning directorial debut by Genki Kawamura (superproducer of Monster, Your Name, Belle, and Rage); Ryūichi Hiroki’s tragic study of the maternal instinct in the form of a Rashomon-like procedural, Motherhood; the thrillingly dark genre gem #Manhole by Kazuyoshi Kumakiri; and Shinichi Fujita’s superheroine (or supervillain?) ode to the literal and figurative empowerment of young women, Mayhem Girls.\n\nNYAFF’s Taiwan lineup features some of the most striking and daring new films from the “beautiful island.” Movie star Kai Ko makes his directorial debut with Bad Education, a controversially dark coming-of-age comedy-thriller; the LGBTQ+ action-comedy Marry My Dead Body foments a gender-fluid revolution with its premise of a macho cop who unwittingly marries a gay ghost; and Gaga, by Taiwan’s first indigenous female director, Laha Mebow, who will be in attendance, chronicles a tangled web of drama across three generations of an Atayal tribe family.\n\nNYAFF reaches further across the continent for even more incredible cinematic discoveries. Philippines: I Love You, Beksman is the fabulously campy tale of a “straight guy with a queer eye” who must overcome his gay family’s apprehensions when he meets the superfly girl of his dreams; based on a shocking real-life story, Where Is the Lie? boasts out-of-the-box storytelling and an extraordinarily luminous performance by trans actor EJ Jallorina as the tragically lovelorn target of a sexy but vicious cyberbully; the timely drama 12 Weeks chronicles a fiercely independent 40-year-old woman’s attempts to arrange a safe abortion in a devoutly anti-choice nation where it is illegal. Singapore: Geylang is a wild pop-art genre joyride seething with the tropically hot melting pot flavors of the city-state put through a riotously macabre Moebius strip of neon-noir influences. Thailand: Kitty the Killer is an anarchic action-comedy about a team of top-notch female assassins who must transform a ridiculously goofy young man from zero to hero in order to wreak bloody vengeance on the agency that betrayed them; You & Me & Me is the directorial debut of real-life identical twin sisters, and art may be imitating life in this glorious teenage coming-of-age fever dream where two look-alike siblings fall for the same boy and must confront their true feelings and who they really are, as they experience the pangs of first love. Vietnam: Glorious Ashes, the first film in over a decade from cinematic poet Bui Thac Chuyên, spins a poignant and dizzying tale of love, loneliness, and pyromania in a devastating omnibus-like tangle of interconnected romance gone wrong in yesteryear’s Mekong Delta.\n\nOnce again this year, the festival will be co-hosting, with Korean Cultural Center New York and Film at Lincoln Center, a free outdoor screening in Lincoln Center’s Damrosch Park. Set for July 21 is Bong Joon Ho’s 2006 masterpiece The Host, arguably one of the greatest monster movies ever made. Highlighting the type of hilarious, ragtag family dynamics that would win him an Oscar for Parasite years later, Bong’s David-versus-Goliath story stars Song Kang-ho and Bae Doona.\n\nA second wave of announcements will be made shortly, containing NYAFF’s Centerpiece and Closing films, the Uncaged Competition lineup and jury, special guests and award honorees, master classes and panels, and other exciting events. NYAFF is also thrilled to host the Opening Night Market on July 14 and the Monday Matsuri to Midnight on July 24, both with live music and Asian food stalls, as well as other parties and receptions.\n\nFrom the deadly serious to the gleefully absurd, from the disquieting to the freaky, NYAFF continues to celebrate the most vibrant and provocative cinema out of Asia today.\n\nThe New York Asian Film Festival is co-presented by the New York Asian Film Foundation and Film at Lincoln Center, and takes place from July 14–30, 2023 at FLC’s Walter Reade Theater (165 West 65th Street, New York, NY), and on July 21–23 at the Barrymore Film Center (153 Main Street, Fort Lee, NJ). It is curated by executive director Samuel Jamier, associate director Claire Marty, China region expert and consultant Hiroshi Fukazawa, and programmers David Wilentz, Karen Severns, Koichi Mori, and Jenny Lin.\n\nBy Amy Kuperinsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\n\nThere’s a sprawling family tree on the wall of the new Barrymore Film Center.\n\nIn a red box at the center: John Barrymore, the vaunted actor of stage and screen. Born in 1882, he would become one of the pillars of America’s first Hollywood — Fort Lee.\n\nIn a golden box off to the left: John’s granddaughter Drew Barrymore. The actor, born in 1975, is now a talk show host and social media sensation known for taking great joy in the little things, like running into the rain.\n\nThe $16 million Barrymore Film Center, a new 21,500-square-foot cultural space in Fort Lee with a 260-seat movie theater and museum that opened Friday, is a tribute to the borough’s status as the birthplace of the United States film industry.\n\nNew Jersey’s place in movie history is often overlooked, but stands as a point of pride. Now we have a gleaming repository for that pride, named for Fort Lee’s “royal” film family.\n\nMajor film studios like Fox, Universal, Goldwyn Pictures and World Pictures once called Fort Lee home, as did Alicé Guy-Blache, the first woman director, who owned Solax Studios.\n\nBy 1915, the town’s 17 bustling film studios meant that Fort Lee was populated by movie industry figures.\n\n“The livelihoods of hundreds and hundreds of people were all about making movies,” says Nelson Page, executive director of the Barrymore.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Barrymore Film Center runs the Main Street institution, which was funded by the borough of Fort Lee.\n\n“They took a big risk in building this, and that’s why I say nobody does it better than Fort Lee,” Page says.\n\nThe ‘royal’ family of Fort Lee\n\nThe Barrymore’s airy, Hollywood feel sets it apart from imposing Fort Lee high-rises and the rest of Main Street.\n\nIt’s all silver and white, adorned with a bold splash of that unmistakable signal of celebrity, both in the lobby and up a cascading staircase:\n\nRed carpet.\n\nSo, will Drew Barrymore be walking this red carpet anytime soon?\n\nSo far there are no appearances from the actor on the books, Page says. But she would be a most welcome guest.\n\nAfter all, these are her people — and acting is certainly the family business.\n\nThe Barrymore, which had a grand opening gala fundraiser Oct. 15, launches with a museum exhibit celebrating the Barrymore family, that “royal” family of the early film scene.\n\nJohn Barrymore’s father (and Drew’s great-grandfather), actor Maurice Barrymore, had a house in town where John lived with his older brother, Lionel, and older sister, Ethel — all actors (their mother was actor Georgiana Drew).\n\n“What made the Barrymores so amazing is that they had developed this wonderful theatrical career in New York City,” Page says. “Then what happened was they made the transition to film, and that transition made them mega-famous. And so they were famous for two different sets of audiences.”\n\nThe movies they filmed in Fort Lee were in black-and-white, but the exhibit, open at the 2,500-square-foot museum through the end of April, is in full color. It’s a collection replete with large, vivid move posters and props from Broadway shows, like John Barrymore’s throne and dagger from his successful 1922 run in “Hamlet.” (A Broadway theater has borne Ethel Barrymore’s name since 1928; her grandson was expected to visit the center.)\n\nFilms opening the Barrymore included the John Barrymore comedy “Twentieth Century” (1934), the Barrymore drama “Counsellor at Law” (1933), the Barrymore romance “Don Juan” (1926) — the first feature film with synchronized sound (not dialogue) — and “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” (1920), a silent film starring the actor, with live organ at the Barrymore Center from John Baratta.\n\nThe Barrymore will be a home to film retrospectives, film festivals and regular movie screenings — including more silent films, sometimes with live musical accompaniment.\n\nIt is a big draw of the new theater, whose curved, cavern-like walls were designed for optimal acoustics. It’s a throwback to Page’s days running theaters, when he would host live organ performances when screening silent films.\n\nThe Barrymore also boasts an orchestra pit, which will be christened Oct. 29 when the center screens the 1925 silent film classic “The Phantom of the Opera,” starring Lon Chaney. The New Jersey Festival Orchestra and soprano Sydney Anderson will perform live.\n\nKeeping the movies alive\n\nPage worked in theatrical exhibition for 33 years, starting in 1979.\n\nHe owned movie theaters in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Now the 68-year-old finds himself opening another theater at a time when the very act of going to the movies is in danger of disappearing.\n\nPage sees his role as not just being an executive, but also a steward of something precious to him — the legacy of the moviegoing experience.\n\n“Everything I know in my life, I learned by going to the movies,” Page says. “And I think a lot of people feel the same way.”\n\nThe center’s director has been heartened by people’s passion for those early movies.\n\n“There is a tremendous wave of rediscovery of cinematic roots,” says Page, who lives in Hamburg. (”I got to be in love to drive 120 miles a day,” he says).\n\n“Silent films get a bad rap because they’re improperly timed and they’re jumpy, but then again I dare anybody to see ‘City Lights’ (1931) and not cry. I dare anybody to see ‘The Last Laugh’ (1924) and not be totally heartbroken. I dare anybody to see ‘The Big Parade’ (1925) and not be amazed at the cruelty of World War I. These films were incredibly perceptive and amazingly intuitive ... if you want to see raw cinema, you see silent.”\n\nPage got his first movie theater gig in the ’70s after working as a media specialist at his alma mater, Dumont High School, when he was 17. He started as a doorman at Fairview Cinema.\n\n“I was there two days before I decided, ‘This is what I want to do for the rest of my life,’” Page says. “I was a doorman for three days, then I was the assistant manager. And I just fell in love with the business.”\n\nIn less than two years, he had his own theater — Cedar Lane Cinemas in Teaneck.\n\nHe calls it his “film school in reverse.” He wasn’t going to make movies, but he could appreciate them and share them with others.\n\nIt was not an easy business. But Page stuck with it after leaving the Teaneck theater, later operating the Galaxy Theatre in Guttenberg and returning to Cedar Lane. Eventually, though, remaining in the business became “economically impossible,” he says.\n\n“A Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night, even in a 250-seat theater, if there are 10 people there, it’s a lot,” Page says. “You’re holding your breath for the whole week to get to Saturday night. And if it snows, you’re dead.”\n\nHe can wax nostalgic all day about the years when movie theater companies owned film studios, but the sobering reality is that today’s theaters are eclipsed by the massive variety of entertainment options that don’t require people to go anywhere.\n\n“You step on the threshold of grave peril if you don’t look at this as a business,” Page says.\n\nMotion picture capital of the world\n\nFort Lee has seen the consequences of competing interests.\n\nBy the ’20s and ’30s, many of the town’s 17 movie studios had burned down or been destroyed. By the end of World War II, most physical evidence of them was gone.\n\n“When you tell people that Fort Lee, New Jersey, was the motion picture capital of the world, everybody laughed,” Page says. “They just thought it was the funniest thing in the world, but it’s absolutely true.”\n\nPioneering Black director Oscar Micheaux made his films in Fort Lee. So did D.W. Griffith.\n\n“In fact, where the film center now stands is in a shot of a Mack Sennett film called, ‘The Curtain Pole’ (1909),” Page says. “You can see clear as day, right on Main Street there, where the film center now stands. So I mean there’s movie history all around us.”\n\nIf the first film directors wanted a Western look, a wilderness scene, a waterside setting or a city, New Jersey had it, along with those famous action-ready cliffs above the Hudson River — which forever became associated with the term “cliffhanger” and silent serial star Pearl White.\n\nThe Barrymore Center calls on us to remember.\n\nSitting just outside the George Washington Bridge, the theater and museum are what Page thinks can be their own bridge from film past to film future.\n\nAs much as it is a tribute to Jersey’s place in the early days of the movie business, the Barrymore places Fort Lee firmly in the still-twinkling cinematic firmament. Twin triangles on the exterior of the center intentionally point westward, toward Hollywood.\n\nPage has his own family connection to Fort Lee — his maternal grandfather was a riveter from Guatemala who worked on the George Washington Bridge for four years.\n\n“Knowing that there was a project that he worked on 300 yards away, it kind of is an amazing thing,” he says. “Every time I walk out of the building, I always look at the New Jersey tower, and I’m thinking, ‘I hope he’s proud.’”\n\nA home for cinephiles\n\nPage has been chairman of the Fort Lee Film Commission since 2000.\n\n“This is the culmination of all my experience,” he told NJ Advance Media on a recent tour of the light-filled, windowed Barrymore, lined with more movie posters down the halls.\n\n“People often have asked me the question, ‘Why did all the studios move out of Fort Lee?’ Because of greed.”\n\nIt helped that the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce beckoned with land and sunny weather. And New Jersey’s Thomas Edison, who founded the first film studio, Black Maria in West Orange, put a crimp in filmmakers’ plans when his trust with George Eastman charged licensing fees to use cameras made by Edison and film from Eastman Kodak.\n\nThe original idea for the Barrymore, hatched in partnership with Mayor Mark Sokolich, was to build a commercial theater. But it evolved into a repertory theater, Page says — a venue with red curtains and seats to match the red carpet, one that would recognize the Jersey roots of the movie business as well as emerging filmmakers.\n\nIt’s been seven years since the conception of the project, and the opening comes four years after the groundbreaking.\n\n“We figured it would take 18 months to get the building built,” Page says.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic froze that timeline, but now he’s proud to throw the doors open every weekend.\n\n“This is built for regional appeal,” Page says. “We want people from all over to participate.”\n\nThe building’s design is intended to be modern with a nod to the past — with art deco influences and references to famous venues like Radio City Music Hall and the Metropolitan Opera House, he says.\n\nThis will be cinema presented with care, Page promises.\n\n“Motion picture exhibition is an art form,” he says. “It’s all about the lights. It’s all about the smell. It’s all about the popcorn. It’s all about presentation and creating an atmosphere where people want to come back.”\n\nMany films will be shown in their original format on the Barrymore’s 20-by-40-foot screen. November brings “Patton” (1970) in 35 mm.\n\n“We want to give them a taste of what this was like through the director’s eye,” Page says.\n\nThat also means valuing black-and-white movies for the rich contrasts they bring to the screen.\n\n“These films were crafted specifically to be shadowed and textured,” he says. “That’s where you get these wonderful film noir movies. Film noir is all in light and dark shadows and gray tones. If you made those films color, they would lose the impact and importance.”\n\nThe center’s walk of fame includes the Barrymores, Mary Pickford and silent film stars Theda Bara, Pearl White and Lon Chaney.\n\n“These are the people who made films in Fort Lee and left their mark in cinema history,” Page says.\n\nBut the Barrymore isn’t just trying to appeal to fans of early film. Programming will span 120 years of moviemaking.\n\n“Especially contemporary filmmakers,” Page says, “because that’s the future of all this. Ultimately, we are who we were. We want to continue that rich film tradition.”\n\nThere’s a full lineup of movies embracing the Halloween spirit, like Tim Burton’s “Sleepy Hollow” (1999), Jim Harman’s “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” (1975), Tobe Hooper’s “Poltergeist” (1982) and Ivan Reitman’s “Ghostbusters” (1984). You can catch a doubleheader of “The Thing” — the 1951 version and the 1982 version.\n\nOn the schedule next summer: A boot camp for high school filmmakers.\n\n“We want to try to entertain. We want to educate. And we want to certainly enthrall,” Page says.\n\nHe sees the center’s invitation to cinema from all eras as an alternative to the often solitary experience of streaming via mobile device.\n\n“That’s what we’re providing in a very big way ... that movies can still be a shared experience,” Page says.\n\nThough Fort Lee paid for the construction of the center, its $1 million annual operating budget now passes to the nonprofit Friends of the Barrymore to manage. Admission to the museum, which is open on days of screenings, is free, while film tickets go for $15 a pop ($9 for members).\n\nBefore the opening of the building, the Barrymore hosted a virtual short film festival for two years. This April, the event will be in person in Fort Lee.\n\nSo far, more than 600 people have joined the Friends of the Barrymore. They live in New Jersey, but also California, Florida, Canada and the United Kingdom, Page says.\n\n“These people want to support film,” he says. “They want to support the idea of movies and make sure that it lasts forever.”\n\nOriginal Article\n\nJim Beckerman / NorthJersey.com / Published 0ct 19, 2022\n\nThe new $16 million Barrymore Film Center in Fort Lee, finally opening Oct. 21 after two years of COVID-related delays, is a lot of things.\n\nIt's a museum. It's a 267-seat repertory film theater. It's a reception space. It's a tribute to Fort Lee's role, 120 years ago, as the birthplace of the movie industry.\n\nIt's also a monument — the greatest since Joyce Kilmer — to a tree. The branching, forking family tree of America's greatest acting dynasty, the Barrymores, takes up an entire wall of the museum area. They, too, have roots in Fort Lee.\n\n\"When you look at that family tree, you realize how far back they go,\" said Mayor Mark J. Sokolich, who spearheaded the project along with some very knowledgeable film people.\n\n\"What made the Barrymores so amazing is that they were a theatrical family that made the jump to film,\" said Nelson Page, executive director of the new facility.\n\nFamous family\n\nYou probably know Drew — star of \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" and \"Ever After.\" Also maybe her grand-uncle, Lionel — who torments Jimmy Stewart every Christmas as mean Mr. Potter in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946).\n\nBut bigger than either, in their day, were John Barrymore, \"The Great Profile,\" the definitive Hamlet of his generation, and Ethel Barrymore, namesake of a theater on West 47th Street. They, and many other Barrymores, are celebrated in the exhibit \"The Barrymores: The Royal Family of Fort Lee,\" at the museum space through April 30.\n\nThere are a lot of them. And they are genetically unmistakable.\n\n\"I had two guys delivering some equipment to the film center a few weeks ago,\" Page said. \"I brought them around to a portrait of Ethel, and one guy said, 'Well, that's Drew Barrymore right there.' And I said, no, that's Ethel Barrymore — circa 1912.' They were stunned.\"\n\nThe Barrymore Center is about much more than this extraordinary family — though they'll be highlighted in the coming weeks.\n\nThe center opens to the public the weekend of Oct. 21 with a Barrymore six-pack. On Friday, Oct. 21, you can see John in \"Twentieth Century\" (1934; 7:15 p.m.) and \"Counsellor at Law\" (1933; 9:15 p.m.). On Saturday there's \"Don Juan\" (1926; 1 p.m.), \"A Free Soul\" (1931; 4:15 p.m. — this one stars John's brother Lionel) and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (1920; 7:30 p.m.).\n\nThese films will be shown in the center's state-of-the-art auditorium — whose scalloped, Deco-ish ceiling, designed by architect Daria Pizzetta, is a nod to both Radio City Music Hall and the retro-futurist designs of William Cameron Menzies, the visionary behind the 1936 sci-fi classic \"Things to Come.\" This is a theater for movie people, by movie people.\n\n\"We wanted something that had the feel of the future, with a tip of the hat to the past,\" Page said.\n\nFully equipped\n\nThree projectors will enable the Barrymore to screen virtually any format: 4K digital for the latest blockbuster; 35 mm and 70 mm projectors for vintage films that aren't available any other way.\n\nAn orchestra pit — perhaps the first designed for a movie theater since the 1920s — can accommodate up to 20 musicians for revivals of silent films. The 20-by-40-foot screen will dominate a stage big enough to mount a live show. There is a three-keyboard organ. Accompanist John Baratta will be doing the honors at the Oct. 22 screening of \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\"\n\n\"In the silent days, they used to have a full orchestra on weekends, and they'd use the organ during the week,\" Page said. \"The organ was the voice of silent films. Then, once we got into the sound era, the organ still brought live sound for overtures and intermissions.\"\n\nThe talkie transition began in 1926 — and naturally, a Barrymore was at the center of that, too. \"Don Juan,\" starring John at his most lovably roguish, was the first feature with prerecorded \"Vitaphone\" sound. It paved the way, a year later, for 1927's \"The Jazz Singer,\" the film that really lit the fire.\n\nIn sum, the Barrymores are key to film — just as film is key to Fort Lee.\n\nJohn, Ethel and Lionel all made films here in the early days. Between 1910 and 1918, Fort Lee was the center of the world's film production. At least 17 big studios were cranking out movies in this Hollywood-on-the-Hudson, including some whose names we still know: Universal, Fox, Paramount (originally Artcraft). By the 1920s, they'd all packed up and moved to California.\n\n\"This was at one point in time the motion picture capital of the world,\" Page said. \"It was the first studio town.\"\n\nThe big picture\n\nThe Barrymore Center is about that history, too.\n\nA second-floor gallery features plaques honoring some of the pioneers who did their early work here. Stars like Mary Pickford, Theda Bara, Lon Chaney and Pearl White (whose movie serial \"cliffhangers\" were actually filmed on the Palisades cliffs). Producers like William Fox, Sam Goldwyn and Universal's Carl Laemmle.\n\nThere were also groundbreakers like Alice Guy-Blaché, the first woman studio head, and Oscar Micheaux, the trailblazing African American director whose \"Symbol of the Unconquered\" was filmed here in 1920. A \"Walk of Fame,\" on the pavement outside the center, salutes these and other local heroes. \"I think it's important for future generations to recognize these names,\" Page said.\n\nBut the Barrymore, its creators emphasize, will be about Fort Lee's present and future, as much as its past.\n\nOn Thursdays starting Nov. 17, there will be a 10-week program of Korean films. South Korea happens to be at the center of the movie universe right now, just as Fort Lee was a century ago. Films like the Oscar-winning \"Parasite\" and the hit TV series \"Squid Game\" have been industry game-changers. And it also happens that 23% of Fort Lee's population is Korean.\n\n\"Korean movies are going through an amazing renaissance right now,\" Page said. \"Film is just so elastic; it can stretch so many different ways. We're going to explore all those boundaries.\"\n\nThe full schedule for the coming months is still under construction, but among other highlights is a Judy Garland centennial festival including \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" (1 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. Nov. 25), a big-screen revival of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (7 p.m. Nov. 19), and a showing of Disney's 1959 \"Sleeping Beauty\" (7 p.m. Nov. 5) coupled with a live appearance by one of its creators, Floyd Norman — the studio's first African American animator. Also, on Dec. 17, there will be a holiday screening of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" Because of course.\n\n\"People remember Lionel Barrymore because of 'It's a Wonderful Life,' \" Page said. \"So all this ties together very neatly.\"\n\nBehind the curtain\n\nMuch as the Barrymore is a salute to Fort Lee, to the movies and to the Barrymores, it's also a monument to some other, very persistent people — living and dead. Movie lovers who believed in it and spent years, even decades, laying the groundwork. It was Sokolich, the mayor, who proposed a major movie theater for the city's burgeoning downtown. But it was a cadre of Fort Lee historians and film lovers who convinced him just what kind of theater it should be.\n\n\"I never get into these things unless I know I have the people who are committed and passionate about them,\" Sokolich said. \"And with this theater, we have some incredibly passionate people.\"\n\nPage is one of them. The Hamburg resident has spent a lifetime in the movie exhibition business, as past owner-operator of the Galaxy in Guttenberg, the Cedar Lane Cinemas in Teaneck, and the Lafayette Theatre in Suffern, N.Y.\n\nAnother is Richard Koszarski, the film scholar whose \"Fort Lee, the Film Town\" and \"Hollywood on the Hudson\" are definitive studies. Critic Theodore Huff, town historian Sylvia Abbott and film buff Lou Azzollini — all deceased —deserve a nod, as does director Thomas Hanlon, whose 1964 documentary short \"Before Hollywood, There was Fort Lee\" started it all.\n\n\"The Barrymore Film Center is the fruit of all those years of effort by so many people,\" Koszarski said.\n\nAbove all there is Tom Meyers — executive director of the Fort Lee Film Society, a lifetime resident who had made it his 30-year mission to wake the world from its amnesia about Fort Lee's movie past. \"We built consensus in the town, awareness,\" Meyers said.\n\nAll his life, he'd been hearing hints of the town's past glories. Both his grandparents had worked for the industry. \"My grandmother Carrie Viola told me that as a child in Fort Lee, they let the kids out of school early so they could be extras in films,\" he said. \"They paid a dollar a day and free lunch.\"\n\nWhen Meyers grew up here, the few remaining studio buildings were derelict hulks. Few people in town had any idea what they'd been. Few movie histories mentioned Fort Lee.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Meyers began working to raise the town's movie profile. In 2001 he helped get the corner of Linwood Avenue and Main Street renamed Theda Bara Way, after the famous \"vamp\" who lured men to their doom at Fox Studios. In 2012, the corner of Washington Avenue and Fifth Street was rechristened Carl Laemmle Way.\n\n'Save the Barrymore House'\n\nBut Meyers also suffered defeats. All his horses and men couldn't prevent the area's first studio, Champion (founded in 1910), from being razed in 2013. And one of his most heartbreaking setbacks was in 2001, when the Borough Council voted 4-2 to demolish the Barrymore House.\n\n\"We had a big public meeting,\" said Meyers, who was then on the council. \"We had over 100 people in T-shirts saying 'Save the Barrymore House.' \"\n\nThis was a ramshackle Victorian on Hammett Avenue in the Coytesville section — Meyers' own neighborhood — where actor Maurice Barrymore raised his three famous children, Ethel, Lionel and John. With all that history, it still came down.\n\n\"The mayor at the time, Jack Alter, told me publicly, 'Someday there will be a building worthy of the Barrymore name in this town, so don't worry,' \" Meyers said. \"And he was right.\"\n\nThe 21,500-square-foot Barrymore Film Center is, arguably, a more fitting shrine to the acting dynasty. Particularly through April, when the Barrymore exhibit will acquaint visitors with Barrymores galore.\n\nIt's a line that stretches back to actor John Drew, from the 1840s — and encompasses such ancillary characters as Bramwell Fletcher (he was the archaeologist who went mad when he saw Boris Karloff lurch out of his sarcophagus in 1933's \"The Mummy\"), comedian Tom Green (briefly married to \"E.T.'s\" Drew) and Dolores Costello, wife of John and grandmother of Drew, the beautiful, fragile mother of 1942's \"The Magnificent Ambersons.\"\n\nSome of the best material relates to John Barrymore — famous in his day not only as the world's greatest actor and most handsome man, but also the world's greatest womanizer and lush. His affairs with Evelyn Nesbit and Mary Astor, and his drunken escapades on and off stage, were legendary.\n\nBarrymore's chair, dagger and prompt-book from \"Hamlet,\" and his suit of armor from \"Richard III\" — among other items on display — testify to his acting prowess.\n\nAnd the other stuff? Ask anyone in Fort Lee.\n\n\"These stories were handed down from generation to generation,\" Meyers said. \"We knew an old lady in the neighborhood who dated John Barrymore when he was there. Her father took a shotgun and went to see Maurice Barrymore and said, 'Keep him away from my daughter.' \"\n\nEven before women had the right to vote, Blaché, in her actions and in her films, expressed female drives, desires and self-determination.\n\nPublished Sept. 6, 2019\n\nOverlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.\n\nBy Manohla Dargis\n\nIn 1911, The Moving Picture News wrote that Alice Guy Blaché, the first female filmmaker in history, was a “fine example of what a woman can do if given a square chance in life.”\n\nBlaché had already founded a successful film company in the United States by the time the article was published, announcing a new studio she was opening in New Jersey. She soon built that studio, adding to her triumphs. Cinema was Blaché’s passion — she called it her Prince Charming — and it took her across continents and centuries in a life shaped both by soaring achievements and by some of the same struggles that women moviemakers face today.\n\nShe was aware of her singularity.\n\n“I have produced some of the biggest productions ever released by a motion picture company,” Blaché told the entertainment weekly The New York Clipper in 1912.\n\nShe made — directed, produced or supervised (often doing triple duty) — about 1,000 films, many of them short, the standard at the time.\n\nShe would later leave the industry at a time when her life was marred by personal and professional disappointments, then spend years trying to claim her place in the very history that she had helped make.\n\nLike other trailblazing women from cinema’s formative years, Blaché has been discovered, somehow overlooked and rediscovered anew. Only now, largely because of the feminist film scholars who are writing women back into history, does her place seem secure.\n\nBlaché got her start in films when she was 22 and working as a secretary in Paris for Léon Gaumont, an inventor who had begun manufacturing motion-picture cameras. To demonstrate them to clients, his company made short films that Blaché thought could be better.\n\n“I had read a good deal,” she wrote in “The Memoirs of Alice Guy Blaché,” which was ushered into publication posthumously in 1976 by the historian Anthony Slide. And she had done some “amateur theatricals.”\n\nBlaché, center, in a scene from “Sage-Femme de Première Classe” (“First Class Midwife”), from 1902, about a young couple who go shopping for a baby. (Blaché played the husband.)Credit...Photograph Collections of the Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n\nShe asked Gaumont if she could film a few scenes.\n\n“It seems like a silly, girlish thing to do,” Gaumont told her, Blaché recalled many decades later in a French television interview, “but you can try if you want. On one condition: that your office work does not suffer.”\n\nArmed with a cameraman, an actress and a painted backdrop, she made “La Fée aux Choux” (“The Cabbage Fairy”) in 1896, her first film. A pantomimed one-minute charmer, it shows a young woman who, with a smile and a bosom wreathed in flowers, plucks squalling naked babies from a cabbage patch constructed out of wood. Some historians believe that Blaché’s inaugural effort was “Sage-Femme de Première Classe” (“First Class Midwife”) her 1902 remake about a young couple who go shopping for a baby. (Blaché played the husband.)\n\nGaumont soon made Blaché the head of film production at his company, where she produced and supervised hundreds of films, helped create an organized studio system years before Hollywood was a company town and trained luminaries of the art like Louis Feuillade. When she moved to the United States, where she resumed her film career, her time at Gaumont was touted in profiles. In 1912, the trade journal The Movie Picture World, wrote: “She inaugurated the presentation of little plays on the screen by that company some 16 or 17 years ago.”\n\nAlice Ida Antoinette Guy was born in Saint-Mandé, on the eastern edge of Paris, on July 1, 1873. Her parents, Marie and Émile Guy, were French but lived in Chile, where her father was a bookseller; Marie returned to France for Alice’s birth and then left the child with a grandmother. Three years later, Marie returned for Alice, and they sailed to Chile. While passing through the Strait of Magellan, near Chile’s southern tip, as she recalled in her memoir, she conjured up fairies and beasts on walls of ice — an early, whimsical prelude to her screen reveries.\n\nAssorted tragedies in Chile followed, and the Guys eventually returned to France, but over time the family disintegrated, leaving Alice to support her mother.\n\nMuch of Alice’s early years seemed to prepare her for a life in cinema, filled as they were with adventures, deprivations and moments of fortitude. In her first secretarial position, in an all-male factory, she recalled, she boldly stood up to a sexual harasser.\n\n“My youth, my inexperience, my sex,” Blaché wrote of her entrance into moviemaking, “all conspired against me.” But she was hardworking and tenacious, and would prove to be prolific.\n\nIn 1894, she talked Gaumont, then the second-in-command at a photography company, into hiring her. Not long after, Gaumont formed his own company and Blaché became a pioneer, making films that were colored by hand and others that used a pioneering sound system, which synced visuals with prerecorded wax cylinders. Blaché can be seen in one clip starting a phonograph while she directs both the cast and the crew. Among her Gaumont titles are “La Femme Collante,” a risqué charmer about a maid with an amusingly sticky tongue, and “Le Matelas Alcoolique” about a peripatetic mattress with a drunken man sewn into it.\n\nIn 1907, she married Herbert Blaché, another Gaumont employee, and resigned as head of film production to accompany him to the United States, where he was sent to promote Gaumont’s sync-sound film system. The undertaking was a bust. But in 1910, two years after giving birth to their daughter, Simone, Alice Blaché formed the Solax Company and began making her own movies. She was so successful that in 1912 — the year she gave birth to their son, Reginald — Blaché built her own state-of-the-art studio in Fort Lee, N.J., then a bustling film town.\n\nShe kept up a heroic pace at Solax. She would jump in her car or on a horse to scout locations, including an orphanage, an opium parlor, night court and Sing Sing prison, where she declined the invitation to witness an execution. She supervised other directors and assistants, oversaw a stock company of adult and child actors, and corralled a menagerie of animal performers, among them rats, lions, panthers and a 600-pound tiger named Princess. On one studio wall she hung a sign that read, “Be Natural.”\n\nHer interest in realism as well as performance dovetailed with what her biographer Alison McMahan said was Blaché’s greatest achievement. Her films, McMahan said in a phone interview, “focused on the psychological perspective of the central characters.\n\nBlaché told The Clipper in 1912: “I have always impressed upon my associate directors that success comes only to those who give the public what it wants, plus something else. That something else I would call our individuality, if you please.”\n\nBlaché expanded her repertoire at Solax with cowboy films like “Two Little Rangers,” which features a pair of gun-toting heroines, one of them a girl with long curls who backs a villain off a cliff. Whether or not it was feminist by design, the film is feminist by default. Blaché wondered if women were ready for the right to vote, but in her actions and in her films she expressed female drives, desires and self-determination.\n\nAt Solax, she successfully made the transition to feature filmmaking, creating longer, more narratively complex titles that were well-received, though they also entailed higher production costs and longer preparations. Yet while Blaché navigated the shift to features creatively, she didn’t weather the seismic changes affecting the fast-growing movie world, including monopolistic distribution practices. By 1914, she and Herbert Blaché had joined forces with another enterprise for which they both directed.\n\nThe last chapter of Blaché’s filmmaking career was marred by setbacks and disappointments both in her new ventures with her husband and as a director for hire. She made “The Ocean Waif,” a touching romance about an abused young woman and a writer that gives (almost) equal weight to both.\n\nOther films followed, but by the time she directed the well-regarded “Her Great Adventure,” Blaché was struggling with her health, financial difficulties, a broken marriage and continued industry upheaval. She declined to direct a “Tarzan” movie. In 1922, the Solax studio was auctioned off, and Blaché, now divorced, returned to France with her two children.\n\nIn France she tried to find film work with no luck. It’s unclear why she didn’t succeed, although by the 1920s, the movies were a big business and no longer as hospitable to women who wanted to make their own films. She sold her books, paintings and other possessions and wrote articles and children’s stories.\n\nShe and her daughter, who worked for the American Foreign Service, spent the last years of World War II in Switzerland, where Blaché began writing her memoir. She also tried to find her films, but most were unavailable and presumed lost. She nevertheless persevered, gave interviews and in time gained some recognition for her pioneering role in cinema.\n\nBlaché wrote of her life: “It is a failure; is it a success? I don’t know.” She died on March, 24, 1968, in a nursing home in New Jersey. She was 94.\n\nIn 2012, the Fort Lee Film Commission installed a new gravestone for Blaché. The original one had noted only her name and the dates of her birth and death. The new memorial states that Alice Guy Blaché was “first woman motion picture director,” the “first woman studio head” and the “president of the Solax Company, Fort Lee, N.J.”\n\nThe memorial is also adorned with the Solax logo: an image of the sun rising on a new day.\n\nJim Beckerman, North Jersey Record\n\nPublished 6:54 a.m. ET April 24, 2019 | Updated 7:27 a.m. ET April 24, 2019\n\nWhen the movie business began — roughly 1895 — it was the Wild West. There were no rules. And consequently there was no one to tell Alice Guy-Blaché that ladies do not become movie directors.\n\nSo you can hardly blame her, in 1896, for becoming the first female film director — for that matter, one of the first film directors, period.\n\nNor can you blame her for being an innovator in narrative film, sound film, comedy, fantasy, Westerns, and films of social comment, for becoming one of the first film executives, or for building one of the largest, most advanced movie studios of the day in Fort Lee, in 1912. For being, in short, one of the great formative figures in film history.\n\n\"She's the mother of cinema,\" says film director Pamela B. Green, whose documentary film \"Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché\" opens April 26 at New York's IFC Center on Sixth Avenue (it will later platform out nationwide). It's already been featured at the Cannes, New York and Telluride film festivals.\n\n\"She did the work, took the trail, climbed the mountain,\" Green says.\n\nJodie Foster narrates the film, which includes commentary from Ava DuVernay, Julie Taymor, Julie Delpy, Geena Davis, and Sir Ben Kingsley and several Blaché relatives, not to mention New Jersey's own Tom Meyers, executive director of the Fort Lee Film Commission, and Teaneck film historian Richard Koszarski (\"Fort Lee: The Film Town\"). Fort Lee is a big part of this story.\n\n\"This was the first American film town, before the industry moved to Hollywood,\" Meyers says. \"That's why Alice Guy-Blaché moved here.\"\n\nIn an era when women are demanding, more than ever, a place at the Hollywood table, \"Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché\" is a reminder that in the early days, women took a seat anyway — invited or not.\n\n\"She had intelligence, and a great sense of humor,\" Green says. \"She was extremely determined, and passionate, and a hard worker. I related to those elements.\"\n\n\"Be Natural\" was the phrase, posted on signboards, on the glassed-in stage of Solax Studios, the enormous $100,000 facility that Guy-Blaché, assisted by her husband, Herbert, built on Lemoine Avenue in Fort Lee (where the Acme supermarket, next to Fort Lee High School, is now).\n\nShe wanted to remind her actors not to exaggerate, not to be \"theatrical,\" but to behave like real people. Or, as director John Ford later said, in his gruff, masculine way, \"Don't act, react.\" But Guy-Blaché said it first.\n\n\"She wanted them to give a sense of realism, so audiences could emotionally relate and say: That's me, or that's my aunt, or that's my cousin,\" Green says. \"She wanted people to have an emotional connection with the films she was making.\"\n\nMaking a name\n\nIn her day, movie directors were seldom credited on screen. But Guy-Blaché was still known, at least within the film community.\n\nShe gave interviews. She wrote for magazines (\"There is nothing connected with the staging of a motion picture that a woman cannot do as easily as a man,\" she said in Moving Picture World in 1914). Her work was admired — and imitated — by other directors, including Alfred Hitchcock and Sergei Eisenstein. Viewers loved her use of naturalistic settings, and her ability to coax believable performances from actors.\n\n\"She helped develop the grammar of cinema,\" Green says. \"She helped move the medium forward when it was in its infancy, when people didn't believe in it.\"\n\nGuy-Blaché, who spent her last years in Mahwah and is buried there (she died in 1968), spent the final years of her life writing her autobiography, trying to round up the 1,000 or so films she wrote, directed or produced between 1896 and 1922, and trying to set the record straight with film historians (mostly male), who — when they didn't ignore her completely — often attributed her films to other directors.\n\n\"If she had lived just a little bit longer, maybe it could have been different,\" Green says. \"But she was old, and the world wasn't ready. I guess my purpose was to be her last chapter, to restore her legacy, which she couldn't do herself, but which she wanted to do very badly.\"\n\nGuy-Blaché was in the right place at the right time. The time was 1894. The place was Paris, where the 21-year-old Alice got a job as a secretary to a camera company — which was in turn bought by a consortium that became Gaumont, one of the giants of the early film industry.\n\nMovies, then, were little one-minute slices of life: workers leaving a factory, a train pulling into a station. Motion — any kind of motion — was miraculous enough.\n\nNot for Guy-Blaché. She was literary: Her father had been a bookstore owner. She pronounced the real-life snippets of street traffic, the seaside bathers and frolicking children, dull. She asked her bosses if she could try to make a film of her own.\n\n\"La fée aux choux\" — \"The Cabbage Fairy\" — made in 1896, depicts a sprite in a cabbage patch, harvesting all the newborn babies (Guy-Blaché knew all about cabbage patch kids 80 years before the American toy industry). It was one of the first — if not the first — staged, fictional films, one of the first to tell a story. And it launched Guy-Blaché on a 25-year career. In short order, she became head of production at Gaumont.\n\n\"She gave film the gift of storytelling,\" Meyers says. \"In America, the first narrative film was 'The Great Train Robbery' [1903]. But Alice was making narrative films well before that.\"\n\nHer range was prodigious. She made dramatic films like \"The Birth, Life and Death of Christ\" (1906), \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" (1913), and \"Esmeralda\" (1905), an early version of \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.\" She made comedies, like \"Matrimony's Speed Limit\" (1913) and \"Canned Harmony\" (1912). She made Westerns, like \"Algie the Miner\" (1912) and \"Two Little Rangers\" (1912).\n\nShe made sound films (\"True Jiu Jitsu,\" 1905, \"Indiscreet Questions,\" 1905) more than two decades before \"The Jazz Singer.\" She made fantasy films with trick effects. She made — notably — films about gender equality, about reversals of sex roles, about women as take-charge heroes (\"In the Year 2000,\" 1912, \"A House Divided,\" 1913, \"Hubby Does the Washing,\" 1912). For good measure, she made one of the first films with an African-American cast, \"A Fool and His Money\" (1912).\n\nComing to America\n\nIn 1910, she had come to America with her her husband, Herbert Blaché, who was then chief of Gaumont's American operations. Soon after, they left Gaumont to form their own studio.\n\nSolax was originally based in Flushing, Queens, but two years later relocated to Fort Lee — then the center of American movie production, with some 17 studios grinding out films. Several of those studios — notably Solax, Éclair, and Pathé — were French. The French, at that time, were at the forefront of film technique. But America was where the audience and the money were.\n\n\"There were so many French filmmakers living in Fort Lee at this time,\" Meyers says. \"There were French-language newspapers here.\"\n\nThe studio, however, didn't last. Guy-Blaché eventually lost Solax — apparently the financial mismanagement of her husband had a lot to do with it — and in time the studio became a film storage facility. In 1964, the building was torn down.\n\n\"It was the 1960s, and there wasn't much thought given in those days to film history,\" Meyers says. \"It's only recently that there's been some acknowledgment. Back in the 1960s, it was pretty forgotten.\"\n\nForgotten, also, was Guy-Blaché — as were the many women who followed in her footsteps.\n\nWhile Guy-Blaché was the first female film director, she was not the only one in the early days.\n\nLois Weber, Ruth Baldwin, Dorothy Arzner, Leontine Sagan, Lotte Reiniger and Wanda Tuchock are just some of the other women who, in cinema's age of innocence, were calling \"Lights, camera, action!\" And it wasn't just directors. There were women screenwriters (Anita Loos, Frances Marion, Jeanie MacPherson, June Mathis). There were women producers (Mary Pickford, Alla Nazimova). What happened to them all?\n\nTheirs was the fate of the cowboy, and the internet startup — the fate of the pioneer.\n\nAfter the freebooting early days are over, big money, regulation and standardization force out the trailblazers. And when Hollywood became big business, one that men could start taking seriously, the powers-that-be decided — in so many words — that a woman's place was in front of the camera, not behind.\n\n\"Once it became a viable business, once people saw that movies had a future and could make money, then women got pushed out and men took over,\" Green says.\n\nToday, as women are struggling to regain a foothold in an industry they were forced out of, 100 years ago, Alice Guy-Blaché is their patron saint.\n\n\"She was an artist and an entrepreneur, and that makes her significant,\" Green says. \"She was a mogul.\"\n\nbenaturalthemovie.com\n\nFort Lee's days of movie stardom may have been a flash in the pan, but the New Jersey town’s role in the history of film is unmistakable.\n\nBy Laura Kiniry\n\n22 February 2019\n\nA famous black-and-white image from the early days of film shows actress Pearl White looking coyly to her side while three men – one standing beside a movie camera, the others closer to the ground behind the actress – are setting up a scene on a precarious cliff above a distant body of water. The now-iconic still is from White’s 1918 film serial The House of Hate, a nail-biting murder mystery that ended in suspenseful cliffhangers each week.\n\nIn fact, this is where the term ‘cliffhanger’ (as it refers to film) is believed to have been coined. Still, the setting is far from Hollywood. It’s northern New Jersey – just across the Hudson River from New York City – which for a brief but glorious time in the early 20th Century was the silent film capital of the world.\n\nWalk around Fort Lee today and you’ll see that it’s brimming with modern development. With more than one-third of the borough’s population of Asian origin – and more than a third of that Korean – Fort Lee’s centre bustles with 24-hour eateries serving up everything from pork-bone hotpots to spicy soft tofu soup.\n\nTowering high rises face out across the Hudson toward upper Manhattan, and traffic pours into downtown from both levels of the double-decker George Washington Bridge. Though while film buffs might easily recognise the borough’s landmark bridge from films such as Woody Allen’s Broadway Danny Rose, Fort Lee’s role as the birthplace of the motion picture industry seemed to have been lost in the vaults for decades, and is only recently being rediscovered.\n\n“Fort Lee’s movie history was one of those things that was always in the background growing up,” said Eric Nelsen, a historical interpreter for Palisades Interstate Park – the backdrop for White’s House of Hate photo – who grew up in New Jersey’s Bergen County (of which Fort Lee is a part). “But once you start digging into it, all the information is actually overwhelming.”\n\nAccording to Tom Meyers, founder and executive director of the Fort Lee Film Commission, a non-profit dedicated to preserving and promoting the borough’s unique film history, Fort Lee housed more than a dozen working film studios during World War One – such as the Victor Film Company, Fox Film Corporation and Goldwyn Picture Corporation (the last standing of which, Champion/Universal, was bulldozed in 2013). And if you grew up in town any time since, chances are you had relatives who worked in the industry. “My grandmother got her start as a film extra and then later moved on to cutting film,” Meyers said, “and my mother and uncles worked for the studio that would later merge with Universal.”\n\nFrom approximately 1909 to 1918, Fort Lee was the centre of the cinematic universe (Hollywood’s first film studio opened in 1911, but it took until the early ‘20s for the West Coast film industry to become well known). Inventor Thomas Edison had already built his Black Maria, ‘America’s first movie studio’, in nearby West Orange, New Jersey, where he kept his home and laboratory, and with the help of his assistant, William Dickson, invented the kinetoscope, precursor to the film projector.\n\nThere was local momentum for sure, but Fort Lee was also camera-ready. The greater borough’s natural and manmade landscapes made it the perfect place for picture-making. There were the Palisades’ sheer cliffs – an easy stand-in for canyon country – and below them the Hudson River, which could be made to look like a seaside harbour, coastal stretch or in some cases even an ocean. The top of the Palisades’ were a mix of wide-open plateau and tall trees that at the right angle resembled the woods of England, as was the case in the obscure 1912 adventure short, Robin Hood. Then there was the town itself, with its wood-frame houses, narrow streets and a small stretch of stone and granite businesses that served as ‘Anytown, USA’. Directors even rented horses from a nearby stable for films’ many Wild West scenes. With such a wealth of scenic variety in such proximity to a major hub like New York City, Fort Lee appeared to have had it made.\n\nA lot of what the industry takes for granted today was all figured out in Fort Lee\n\n“It’s strange to think that movie making is so ubiquitous today, yet it all began here in Fort Lee barely a century ago,” Nelson said. “A lot of what the industry takes for granted today – things like using multiple cameras for different angled shots, and ways to diffuse light – it was all figured out in Fort Lee.”\n\nWith the films came the actors, many of whom went on to become big Hollywood stars: names like Fatty Arbuckle, Mary Pickford and Theda Bara all got their start in Fort Lee. Others, such as the first-ever host of the Academy Awards, Douglas Fairbanks, moved to the borough for its cinema opportunities as well. The Marx Brothers began their film career here with their first-ever comedy short, the now-lost Humor Risk – and patriarch of the Barrymore acting dynasty, Maurice Barrymore, was not only a Fort Lee resident but also helped build a local volunteer fire station. To raise money, he staged a play called Man of the World at the former Buckheister’s Beer Garden on Main Street, where a car park now stands. His 18-year-old son John – Drew Barrymore’s grandfather and one of the most celebrated actors of his era – played the starring role. It was his acting debut.\n\nBut Fort Lee’s film heyday was short lived. When frigid temperatures bring the US’ Mid-Atlantic region to a standstill and winter transforms the Hudson River into a sea of slush and ice, it’s easy to see why the movie industry soon left northern New Jersey for Hollywood’s perpetually sunny skies. A coal shortage that left studios unheated during a brutally cold New Jersey winter, coupled with the influenza pandemic of 1918, caused many of Fort Lee’s movie studios to close indefinitely. Rather than reopen, they simply up and moved to year-round warm and temperate California. Many of the borough’s studios were left abandoned and eventually burned down or were torn down over the years for redevelopment, and Fort Lee’s film history became a thing of the past.\n\nIn fact, when local resident Sean Ng first moved to Fort Lee from Manhattan about five years ago, he knew nothing about its days as a cinema star. But soon he started noticing large plaques detailing the borough’s legendary past erected in several spots throughout town, especially closer to its commercial centre. “[Now that I’ve discovered the local film history], it feels rather special,” he said. “When you speak of movies, Hollywood usually comes to mind, not Fort Lee, New Jersey.” He asked some his neighbours for more information, but few of them knew much the borough’s film era.\n\nIt’s strange to think the place that pioneered the world’s movie industry remains so low-key about its background, but there’s been active motion to change this. Along with nearly a dozen plaques commemorating Fort Lee’s film history, there are also several decorative street signs honouring local stars of the silent screen, including John Barrymore Way (on the corner of Main Street and Central Road, where the original Buckheister’s once stood) and Theda Bara Way (on the corner of Main Street and Linwood Avenue, named for the femme fatale actress who became one of film’s original sex symbols). Just this autumn, ground broke on the Barrymore Film Center, a film museum and 260-seat cinema scheduled to open in February 2020, with its entrance right across the street from Fort Lee’s historical First National Bank building, used in the DW Griffith 1911 drama Her Awakening.\n\nWhen you speak of movies, Hollywood usually comes to mind, not Fort Lee, New Jersey\n\nThe bank is one of the few structures that remains from the borough’s silent-film days, where apartment buildings, car parks, convenience stores and rampant reconstruction have since usurped colonial-style mansions and movie studios. But you can still take a stroll through downtown’s Monument Park, where actor-turned-director Griffith shot early films such as 1909’s The Cord of Life and Harley Knowles directed 1917’s The Volunteer. Or snap some pics outside Rambo’s, a former two-storey saloon along First Street in the borough’s residential Coytesville neighbourhood that is now government-assisted housing for veterans. In the early days of film, Rambo’s stood in for everything from a New England tavern to a Western saloon – and later earned the nickname the ‘Silicon Valley of Film’ from Meyers and his colleagues for being an incubator of early film ideas. “Crew from every film studio came here because it was the only game in town for lunch,” Meyers said. “They sat in Rambo’s outdoor picnic area and came up with innovative new ways to do things, like diffusing light by holding a tablecloth up to the sun.”\n\nOf course, there’s also Cliffhanger Point, that natural overhang that Pearl White and her own crew made famous. “For years I never knew where that sight was,” Nelson said, “but when we finally found it, it was so obvious. You could actually line up the cracks in the rock.]\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Fort Lee’s days of movie stardom may have been a flash in the pan, but the town’s role in the history of film is unmistakable. “This is the place that pioneered film studios,” Meyers said. “The studios and many of their films may be gone, but their ghosts undoubtedly remain.”\n\nThey’re simply lurking behind high-rises and 24-hour Korean eateries.\n\nThe small New Jersey outpost across the river from Manhattan that pre-dated the glamour of Hollywood as the center of the film industry\n\nBefore Hollywood, Fort Lee, New Jersey, was the first-ever film town in the 1910s, at the birth of the motion picture industry\n\nBy 1915 a high concentration of film studios had gathered in the New Jersey borough, including the original Universal Studios, the American branch of the French Éclair Studios and the Solax Company\n\nThe proximity to New York City and the diverse landscapes ranging from open fields to rural neighborhood streets to the cliffs of the Palisades made Fort Lee an ideal location for the brand-new film industry\n\nBy 1918, however, changing circumstances including America's involvement in the First World War and the 1918 influenza epidemic disrupted the film industry in Fort Lee\n\nStudios closed their doors in the small town and moved out to Hollywood, leaving Fort Lee practically abandoned and forgotten\n\nA new documentary about Fort Lee, The Champion: A Story of America's First Film Town, has just been nominated for a New York Emmy\n\nThe film follows the story of Fort Lee's first film studio, the Champion Studio, which was built in 1910\n\nBy ANN SCHMIDT FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPUBLISHED: 12:12 EDT, 7 March 2018 | UPDATED: 12:13 EDT, 7 March 2018\n\nWhen Tom Meyers thinks of growing up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, he always goes back to the summer of 1971 when he was 10 years old. He and his friends would go to Gus Becker's Saloon on First Street where the owner, in his late 80s, would give the boys sodas and tell them about bartending in the 1910s, when Fort Lee was crawling with movie actors, crew members, directors and producers.\n\nMeyers remembers a poster of Florence Lawrence, the first American movie star, on the wall. Lawrence personally signed the poster to Becker who told the boys about her, the actress Pearl White and the acting family, the Barrymores, who all shot and worked – and in the case of the Barrymores lived – in Fort Lee.\n\nThe New Jersey borough just across the Hudson River from New York City became the first American film town in the 1910s when a concentration of film studios operated all within a few blocks of each other, producing thousands of silent films. At its height in the mid-1910s, the town had 11 working studios including Fox Film Corporation, the Goldwyn Picture Corporation, Éclair Studios and The Solax Company.\n\nBy 1918 however, changing circumstances were disrupting the film industry, particularly in Fort Lee. With the United States' entrance into the First World War in 1917, the 1918 influenza pandemic and the frozen-over Hudson River in 1918, many of the East Coast studios shut their doors and moved out west to Hollywood, leaving Fort Lee mostly deserted with empty lots and abandoned studios.\n\nDespite two short documentaries about the borough, one made in 1935 and the other in 1964, Fort Lee's film history was mostly forgotten in the wake of Hollywood. Its history wasn't even taught in Fort Lee itself, Meyers says. Instead, he learned about it from his parents and grandparents, who had worked in the industry, and from Becker.\n\nFort Lee, New Jersey, was the first-ever film town in America in the 1910s, even before Hollywood. At its height, the small New Jersey borough across the Hudson River from upper Manhattan had 11 working studios in close proximity to one another. Pictured is America's first named movie star, Florence Lawrence, on a film set\n\nStudios were drawn to Fort Lee as the perfect place to shoot a variety of films because of the wide range of landscapes. The borough had open fields, quiet residential streets and the cliffs of the Palisades. Starting in 1907, the first New York City-based studios were taking day trips to Fort Lee for filming. Pictured is a still from an unknown Western made by the Champion Studio and shot in Fort Lee\n\nFort Lee's history has been brought back to the light, however, with the release of a documentary which has just been nominated for a New York Emmy. The Champion: A Story of America's First Film Town was produced by the Fort Lee Film Commission, of which Tom Meyers is the executive director and founder.\n\nThe 30-minute documentary follows the story of the Champion Studio, Fort Lee's first film studio founded by Mark Dintenfass in 1910. When the Fort Lee Film Commission started the project in 2013, the studio had just been sold and was in danger of being demolished. As much as commission tried to preserve the historic building, it was torn down that same year.\n\nAfter it was demolished, the scope of the documentary changed. The project was no longer just about the studio, it became about 'trying to save American film history. It told a story wrapped around Fort Lee as the first American film town', Meyers says.\n\n'This is what happens when you don't care for this history,' Meyers tells DailyMail.com about the demolished Champion studio. 'What should have happened there, that could have been a jewel of a building, converted into a place for new filmmakers to learn their craft, like student filmmakers, young people. Right now it's still an empty lot.'\n\nThough film studios were taking day trips to Fort Lee starting in 1907, the Champion Studio (pictured during its construction in 1910), was the first studio to set up shop directly in Fort Lee\n\nThe Champion studio (pictured from the 1964 documentary Before Hollywood There Was Fort Lee, NJ) was also one of the last studios to remain in Fort Lee. In 1923, it was sold and turned into a printing plant, which it remained as until it was sold again and demolished in 2013\n\nThough the history of Fort Lee as a film town has been largely forgotten in the shadow of Hollywood, a new documentary about the borough has been released. The Champion: A Story of America's First Film Town was even nominated for a New York Emmy\n\nFort Lee, named after General Charles Lee by George Washington during the Revolutionary War, is across the Hudson River – and today the George Washington Bridge – from upper Manhattan. After the Civil War it became something of a resort town and by the late 19th century the Palisades Amusement Park in Fort Lee and Cliffside Park, New Jersey, brought even more visitors.\n\nAbout 30 miles away in West Orange, New Jersey, the American motion picture was born. Thomas Edison built the first film studio, the 'Black Maria' in 1893 and he patented the first motion picture camera in 1897. Though it is often overshadowed by Hollywood, Meyers says this history should not be forgotten.\n\n'All of that happened in the state of New Jersey,' he says. 'It wasn't California, it wasn't New York. This was the state of New Jersey.'\n\nHowever, production companies did spring up in New York City, filming the short, silent films that were popular at the time inside their brownstone studios on 14th street, or on the roof for exterior shots. By 1907, some studios had discovered Fort Lee as a good place for filming with its dirt roads, residential streets lined with clapboard houses, open fields and the cliffs of the Palisades, all perfect for a wide range of films.\n\nGus Becker's Saloon, which was then known as Rambo's Saloon, played a huge part in the industry. It was the perfect hangout for actors and crew members when they had finished filming and the upstairs was often used for a dressing room for actors. The saloon itself starred in hundreds of films, its porch easily arranged for different sets.\n\nBecause of Fort Lee's close proximity to the city – just a hop, skip and a jump via the new subway system and a ferry across the Hudson – it became the perfect place for filming day trips. It also helped that filming in Fort Lee made it more difficult for Edison's patent detectives to follow independent filmmakers and gather information in order to charge licensing fees for the use of cameras, film and projectors.\n\nThe 30-minute documentary follows the story of the Champion Studio within the larger context of Fort Lee and the earliest years of the film industry. Pictured left is a movie poster for All For Love, which was made in Fort Lee by Victor Studio, which had combined with the Champion Studio. Both studios were among those who had been folded into the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in 1912. Pictured right is a scene from the 1911 short, silent film How He Redeemed Himself, produced by Champion Studio and shot in Fort Lee\n\nPictured is a still from the 1911 short silent film In the Great Big West, produced by Champion Studio and shot in Fort Lee. The film is about a young doctor named Harold Walters who is in love with Dorothy Desmond, but conflicts between his love for her and his duties as a physician\n\nMark Dintenfass (pictured) was the first to set up his studio, Champion Studio, actually in Fort Lee. He had gotten his start in film producing in New York City, but was put out of business there because of licensing fees put on by Thomas Edison who had the patent for the first moving picture camera\n\nThough Mark Dintenfass had started producing films in New York City, the fees put him out of business, so he decided to set up his company just beside Fort Lee, in the town of Englewood Cliffs. His studio, the Champion Studio, was the 'first permanent motion picture studio to be built in the Fort Lee area', film scholar, Rutgers professor and Fort Lee Film Commission member Richard Koszarski says in the documentary. It was built in 1910 and by the end of 1911, two other studios had already followed suit and set themselves up in Fort Lee.\n\n'It's this concentration,' Koszarski tells DailyMail.com. 'It's what we call the film town, or the phrase that's used is the birth of the American film industry. Now, there were studios around the country before they started building studios in Fort Lee. There were studios in Brooklyn, downtown Manhattan, Philadelphia. What you have in Fort Lee is this concentration. They are packed together. Within one block you'll have three different companies operating studios, which means that you also have around it all the support equipment. You can walk, literally, down the street to your choice of film laboratories.\n\n'That concentration, we think of Hollywood, the concentration of studios. And it wasn't just a coincidence, it was useful for the studios to be together because, so they could interact. But that happened earlier and in an even more compact way in Fort Lee... There was a lot of this cooperation and people could learn from one another. It's a good thing to have a concentration of an art industry like that.'\n\nCompanies including the American branch of the French Éclair Studios, the Solax Company, the Willat Film Manufacturing Company, the Peerless-World Studio and Paragon Studio had brought themselves to Fort Lee in the 1910s, and others including Victor Studios and Goldwyn Pictures were founded in Fort Lee, making it the first-ever American film town.\n\nTo stay afloat in the midst of the intense competition between studios, Dintenfass and other smaller independent studio heads joined together into the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in 1912, which bought The Champion and kept Dintenfass on as the manager.\n\nPictured is a still from the restored 1912 short film Robin Hood, the earliest surviving film version of the story, which was shot in Fort Lee by Solax Studio and directed by Étienne Arnaud\n\nOne of the most frequently used sets in Fort Lee films was Rambo's Saloon, which started as a hangout for actors and crew members after a long day of filming. Its upstairs floor became the perfect place for actors' dressing rooms and because the porch could be easily arranged for different sets, the saloon itself starred in hundreds of films. Pictured is Florence Lawrence in her dressing room\n\nBefore the Champion documentary came out last year, there were two other attempts to remember the history of Fort Lee. Ghost Town: The Story of Fort Lee was created in 1935 by Theodore Huff and Mark A Borgatta. Before Hollywood There Was Fort Lee, NJ was created in 1964, directed by Thomas Hanlon\n\nAs the first film town, Fort Lee was a center of progress. Filming techniques and technologies were advancing and women were given empowering roles. Actress Pearl White was the star of the adventure film serial, The Perils of Pauline, which showed her riding horses and climbing the Palisades cliffs. Alice Guy-Blaché was the first female film director and studio owner of Solax, which she had built in 1912. She produced thousands of films in her career.\n\nHowever, by 1918 things were changing for the film industry and Fort Lee. Because of restrictions put in place when the US joined World War I in 1917, East Coast studios would have days without electricity, which prevented them from filming without lights. Meanwhile, the constant sunshine in Hollywood meant West Coast studios didn't need constant lighting. When the influenza pandemic hit the United States in 1918, it started in the East Coast, giving studios another excuse to shut their doors – though it ended up following them west.\n\nBut one of the final problems for Fort Lee specifically was that in the winter of 1918, the Hudson River froze, cutting off the only transportation between Fort Lee and New York City: the ferry. The George Washington Bridge, which connects the two today, wasn't completed until 1931.\n\nKoszarski says the East Coast studio owners decided to 'temporarily' close their doors and just focus on Hollywood for a while before returning, 'but then it was really easy to say, well we won't open them again', though he adds they did end up coming back, just not to Fort Lee.\n\n'A number of the companies said, we already have studios on the West Coast and the East Coast, let's just forget about this East Coast thing. Too many problems,' he says. 'Immediately, they realized that was not a perfect solution. So as soon as the war ended, they began to build new studios in the east, but not in New Jersey, because there was no bridge to New Jersey.'\n\nPictured is an ad for a Goldwyn Pictures film, The Danger Game, released in 1918. Goldwyn Pictures had their studio in Fort Lee. The Danger Game, starring Madge Kennedy in the leading role, is a 'melodramatic comedy' and is included in the DVD set with the 2017 documentary The Champion\n\nFlorence Lawrence (painting left and a 1908 portrait right) was a Canadian-American actress and the first movie star. She was at the height of her fame in the 1910s, starring as the leading lady in many silent films shot in Fort Lee. She starred in almost 300 films during her career\n\nFort Lee stayed relatively quiet after the studios left in the 1920s, with the exception of African American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, who rented out Fort Lee studios in the '20s and '30s at a time when he wouldn't have been able to shoot in Hollywood. He is considered the first major African American feature filmmaker, who produced both silent and sound films.\n\nOther than Micheaux and other independent filmmakers renting out those spaces, the abandoned industrial properties and empty studio lots remained up until the 1940s and '50s, Koszarski says, though some were used for Broadway company warehouses. Laboratories and film storage warehouses did remain in Fort Lee, fully operational and employing the residents of the borough.\n\n'That was kind of your back office business,' Koszarski says. 'But it employed lots of people. It didn't employ fancy movie stars or directors, so it gets written out of film history.'\n\nAnother film included in The Champion documentary DVD set is The Indian Land Grab, a 1910 short Western shot in Fort Lee\n\nThe borough only really came back into the limelight in 2013 with the Bridgegate scandal where toll lanes on the upper level of the George Washington Bridge were intentionally closed by political appointees of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. But as far as film history, Fort Lee is hardly, if ever, mentioned. Part of that can be attributed to a stylistic change, Koszarski says, which happened around 1918 and made it so that films made before 1918 weren't preserved.\n\n'The style of making films changed,' he says. 'So that films from before 1918 suddenly seemed very old and early. And films made after 1918, even though they may be silent films, still seemed to work like \"real movies\". So people who were stars before 1918 or directors, the careers, they just went into a black hole.'\n\nThe loss of Fort Lee's history also comes down to the fact that Hollywood was just better at promoting itself.\n\n'Hollywood has a much more successful promotional machine,' he says. 'Hollywood had a Chamber of Commerce that promoted itself as the center of the film universe. That this is where all films are made. And they began doing that in the late teens and early '20s and as far as New York was concerned, New York, you know, would sort of look down on this as just like crazy entertainment business... And in Fort Lee, it was a residential community. They were almost happy to see these noisy industries leave. Of course they took the jobs with them. So it was very easy to write it out.'\n\nHe adds: 'And unfortunately, there's a huge amount of the product that has just vanished. We don't have it anymore so that even historians can't dig out old films.'\n\nTo stay afloat in the midst of the intense competition between studios, Dintenfass and other smaller independent studio heads joined together into the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in 1912, which bought The Champion and kept Dintenfass on as the manager. Pictured is a Universal Set from 1912\n\nWhen Tom Meyers was growing up in Fort Lee in the early 1970s, he says he and his friends used to go to Gus Becker's Saloon - what used to be Rambo's Saloon - after school. Meyers says Becker, the owner who was in his late 80s at the time, would tell them all about bartending in the 1910s when the film industry was still big in Fort Lee. Becker even had a poster of Florence Lawrence (pictured) on the wall that she had personally signed to Becker\n\nBack in 2013 Meyers heard that Rambo's Saloon was going to be demolished, so he and the Fort Lee Film Commission, which he founded in 2000, worked with the Fort Lee Mayor and Council to prevent that from happening. They were able to arrange for the house to be turned into affordable housing for veterans and their families, while still maintaining the exterior of the building.\n\nAround the same time, there was also word that the Champion studio had been sold and was going to be demolished. Unlike Rambo's, the Champion was in Englewood Cliffs, where the mayor and city council were less interested in preserving the space. The Champion had been sold by Universal in 1923 to a printing plant, which is what it continued to be until 2013 when it was sold and demolished.\n\nIts demolition is what prompted the commission to create The Champion documentary based on Koszarski's 2004 book Fort Lee: The Film Town. The documentary was released in a DVD set in October, which includes the 1935 documentary about Fort Lee called Ghost Town: The Story of Fort Lee as well as eight silent films produced in the borough from 1910 to 1918.\n\nKoszarski says the documentary isn't necessarily about just the Champion Studio so much as it is about the importance of taking care of history.\n\n'The Champion documentary is not just important because we said oh here was this studio, this rather small and even in the context of Fort Lee, insignificant studio,' he says. 'It's because the documentary is about trying to save history and reminding people that film history is not just something that comes in a can on reel, but film history also is cultural and there are physical archaeological traces around us.\n\n'It's kind of a reminder that even for a little studio, it did have some firsts. It was probably the first one built out here and so on. I can't, and the movie doesn't, make the argument that they were making the best films, even in Fort Lee. But they were making films… but at least you had this trace, this archaeological trace and then the archaeological trace is gone.'\n\nAfter the 1920s, Fort Lee stayed relatively quiet and the closed up studios remained mostly unused with the exception of a few independent filmmakers and African American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, who is considered the first major African American feature filmmaker and produced both silent and sound films. He rented studios in Fort Lee in the '20s and '30s at a time when he wouldn't have been able to shoot films in Hollywood. Pictured is a still from his 1920 film The Symbol of the Unconquered\n\nIris Hall (pictured) starred in the silent film. This scene of the film was shot on the side of the Champion Studio (in the background). The Symbol of the Unconquered is the last time the Champion Studio is pictured in a film\n\nFor Marc Perez, the director of the documentary, a member of the Fort Lee Film Commission and someone who grew up in Fort Lee as a child, the more he worked on the film, the more passionate he was about it.\n\n'Filmmaking is an art form,' he tells DailyMail.com. 'That's still really new when you compare it to everything else, music painting and sculpture and all these things. It's really like a baby compared to all that and I don't think people yet understand that these short films made in 1915 were a piece of art. Nobody knew what they were doing and they figured out how to tell a story with this technology, but I don't know if [people] understand that it needs to be preserved today or else the film gets disintegrated, it goes away... It's really unappreciated right now. And I think just more of this kind of stuff is needed to appreciate.'\n\nDespite the loss of the Champion Studio building and the years of its forgotten film history, the Meyers and the commission are working to create a space for film to have a future in Fort Lee. Back in 2001, the Fort Lee Film Commission attempted to save the historic Barrymore House, where the American acting family had lived. Though the house was demolished, the commission plans to open the Barrymore Film Center in 2019, which will have a film museum and a 260-seat cinema where they plan to showcase classic films, art house films and student films.\n\n'We want this to be not just about Fort Lee, although that'll be the anchor,' Meyers says. 'But truly make this really a place where American cinema has a home, the history of American cinema and the future of American cinema and give that through a perspective of world cinema.\n\n'It's going to be a lot of diverse programming and all of this really comes out of the rubble of the Champion Studio. So out of that loss, we're going to enshrine the memory of the Champion and tell that story to future generations in this film center. And we hope that'll help preserve what history has left, not only in Fort Lee, but around the country.'\n\nLupino and Collins aren’t mentioned in the same breath as Scorsese and\n\nSpike Lee, but they should be. Let’s put them back in the conversation.\n\nBy MANOHLA DARGIS and A.O. SCOTT SEPT. 20, 2018\n\nThis season will bring a number of female-driven movies, including new work from Nicole Holofcener, Karyn Kusama and other directors who just might be poised for a breakthrough. These films are reminders that even as female activists continue to demand industry reform post-Harvey Weinstein, women — much as they have always done — are also working hard as writers, directors, producers and costume designers.\n\nWomen have been on the cinematic front lines from the start. While men took most of the credit for building the movie industry, women — on camera and off, in the executives suites and far from Hollywood — were busily, thrillingly, building it, too. That’s the reason for our list of Movie Women You Should Know, which is not a canon or a pantheon but a celebration and an invitation to further discovery. Here are some of the art’s other pioneers — its independents and entrepreneurs, auteurs and artisans.\n\nANITA LOOS\n\nShe Wrote the Book on Screenwriting\n\n“How to Write Photoplays,” 1920\n\nOne of the most prolific and powerful screenwriters of her time — with a career that began in 1912 and stretched into the late ’50s — Anita Loos was in some ways bigger than Hollywood itself. She brought the clout and cachet of a best-selling novelist and successful Broadway playwright to the nascent movie industry, adapting her own work and those of her peers to the new medium. In 1920 she and her husband, John Emerson, published “How to Write Photoplays,” an early example of an enduring genre. This manual for aspiring movie scribes included a wealth of advice both practical (“Writing for the Camera,” “Marketing the Story”) and existential:\n\nAbove all things the scenario writer should keep alive. Just keep yourself with lively, laughing, thinking people, think about things yourself, and cultivate a respect for new ideas of any kind. Take care of these small ideas and the big plots will take care of themselves.\n\nGood advice, then and now, and revealing of Loos’s own approach. She was protean and prolific — her credits range from D.W. Griffith’s “Intolerance” (1916) to George Cukor’s “The Women” (1939) — sociable and shrewd. “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” her best-seller from 1925, was brought to the screen first in 1928 and then, as a musical, in 1953, with Marilyn Monroe singing about diamonds and Anita Loos laughing all the way to the bank. (A.O. Scott)\n\n➞ Loos wrote in a memoir that “in its heyday, Hollywood reflected, if it did not actually produce, the sexual climate of our land.” She could almost have written that sentence with “I” in place of the word “Hollywood.”\n\nMARION E. WONG\n\nShe Directed the First\n\nChinese-American Film\n\n“The Curse of Quon Gwon,” 1916-17\n\nIn July 1917, the magazine the Moving Picture World ran a brief story on the Mandarin Film Company accompanied by a photo of its president, the Chinese-American filmmaker Marion E. Wong. Based in Oakland, Calif. — a source of independent cinema even then — the company, the item read, had recently completed its first film, “The Curse of Quon Gwon” and was expected “to continue the production of films dealing with Chinese subjects.” It was “the only Chinese producing concern in this country.”\n\n“The Curse of Quon Gwon: When the Far East Mingles With the West,” as it is fully titled, proved to be Wong’s only film. The earliest known movie by a Chinese-American filmmaker, it was long thought lost until the director Arthur Dong happened upon some surviving material while making his 2007 documentary “Hollywood Chinese.” Even in its current truncated form, Wong’s film beguiles partly because of its melodrama — a young couple, a lonely bride, cultural dissonance, the promised misfortune — and because of flourishes of beauty, like the image of a woman gazing into a mirror before her life is cleaved in two. (Manohla Dargis)\n\nDEDE ALLEN\n\nShe Edited Gangsters So They Flew\n\n“Bonnie and Clyde,” 1967\n\n“Make it go faster.” That’s what the director Arthur Penn told Dede Allen when she was editing “Bonnie and Clyde.” She did, brilliantly. Over a decades-long career, she edited six films by Penn, who saw her as a true collaborator, calling Allen “an artist” and an “essential part of the creative process.” She worked hard, memorizing every frame until the footage ran in her head. Likening herself to the actors, Allen said she, too, became the roles to “viscerally, emotionally feel the way the characters feel.”\n\nDede Allen Associated Press\n\nLike all of filmmaking, editing was wide open to women in cinema’s earliest years. By the 1920s, though, the regimented studio system had become divided along gender roles. Although some women had lengthy careers as studio cutters, by the late 1930s, as Allen once said, “it was not considered proper for a girl to come in and take a job from a father with children.” She and her husband moved to New York, where she edited her first notable feature in 1959 and in time helped filmmakers revolutionize the art by turning editing into energy, feeling, character. (M.D.)\n\n➞ Director Arthur Penn wanted to give “Bonnie and Clyde” all “this energy” Allen said. “We were able to go in with angles and close-ups and only pull back when we wanted to show what Arthur called ‘the tapestry,’” she explained, adding “I broke many of my hard and fast rules about story, character and how a scene plays.”\n\nALICE GUY BLACHÉ\n\nShe Was the First Woman\n\nin the Director’s Chair\n\n“The Cabbage Fairy,” 1896\n\nAlice Guy Blaché helped invent cinema as we know it. The first female filmmaker and among the first to make a fiction film, she made her debut in 1896 with the one-minute “The Cabbage Fairy.” She shot this charmer — which shows a sprite smilingly plucking real babies from a cabbage patch — on a Paris patio while working as a secretary for Gaumont, which would soon be a film powerhouse. Historians ignored and even rejected that date perhaps, as the theorist Jane M. Gaines has suggested, it was unthinkable that a young female secretary supporting a widowed mother could be responsible for an early-cinema milestone.\n\nGuy Blaché is thought to have made some 1,000 films (mostly shorts) that included cowboy flicks, cross-dressing comedies and melodramas; about 150 had synchronized sound (this was before the industry widely embraced sound). She founded a film company, Solax, and built a studio in Fort Lee, N.J., where she hung a banner for her actors that read, “Be Natural.” Her last film was released in 1920 and then she was forgotten until scholars began to realize that she had been there all along. (M.D.)\n\nBARBARA LODEN\n\nShe Had It With Men and\n\nMade a Film About It\n\n“Wanda,” 1970\n\n“Wanda,” the only feature Barbara Loden directed — she was not yet 50 when she died, in 1980 — is a movie both of and ahead of its time. Like many American films of its time, “Wanda,” made in 1970, is the story of an earnest quest for freedom set in a vividly naturalistic American landscape. But most of the rebels and seekers of the New Hollywood were men, heirs of Huck Finn in flight from social conventions and, as often as not, the demands of women.\n\nWanda Goronski, played by Loden herself, tells a different story. An unhappy housewife in Pennsylvania’s coal country — where Loden grew up — her prospects are defined, thwarted and betrayed by men. There is a blunt, brutal matter-of-factness in the way Loden portrays Wanda’s fate as she leaves her husband and drifts through problematic love affairs. There is also a quiet and insistent empathy.\n\nBefore turning to writing and directing, Loden appeared in “Wild River” and “Splendor in the Grass,” both directed by Elia Kazan, whom she married in 1967. The vaunted realism of Kazan’s films can seem downright sentimental compared with “Wanda,” which has an honesty about marriage, work, sex and class that still feels radical and raw. (A.O.S.)\n\nLEIGH BRACKETT\n\nShe Scripted Hard-Boiled Men\n\n“The Big Sleep,” 1946\n\n“She wrote that like a man” — this was the gruff praise that the director Howard Hawks bestowed on the screenwriter Leigh Brackett’s work on “The Big Sleep.” They met because Hawks had been looking for someone who could help turn the Raymond Chandler novel into a film for Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Hawks thought Brackett had the right strong stuff after reading one of her crime novels. “He was somewhat shaken,” she said later, “when he discovered that it was Miss and not Mr. Brackett.”\n\nBrackett was 28 when Hawks brought her in to write “The Big Sleep” along with William Faulkner. “He was wonderful on construction,” she said of Faulkner, “but just couldn’t write lines an actor could speak.” A prolific science-fiction author, Brackett kept writing scripts — notably Hawks’s “Rio Bravo” — and turned in the first draft of “The Empire Strikes Back” just before she died at age 62 in 1978. (M.D.)\n\nIDA LUPINO\n\nShe Gave Noir Its Emotion\n\n“Outrage,” 1950\n\n“I don’t want to smile all the time,” Ida Lupino said in 1942. She was 24 and under contract at Warner Bros., which wanted her to be another Bette Davis. Reluctant to take Davis’s seconds, Lupino had signed a strategic short contract with the studio that allowed her to work elsewhere. She went on to make great films at Warners, but there were bad roles, too, and frustration. By 1949, she was ready to be truly independent, citing the neorealist director Roberto Rossellini as inspiration. “When are you going to make pictures about ordinary people in ordinary situations?” he had asked her.\n\nLupino answered by founding a company, The Filmmakers, with her husband and one other. They were set to shoot their first film, “Not Wanted” — about an unwed mother — when its director fell ill. Lupino discreetly took over. Lupino kept on calling the shots, and for decades was the only female director in Hollywood. Working with low budgets and sometimes uneven casts, she turned sensation into emotion in lean, tense, tough films like “Outrage,” a shadow-strafed noir about a young woman who, after she is raped, is forced to find herself. (M.D.)\n\nLOTTE REINIGER\n\nShe Was the Anti-Disney\n\n“The Adventures of Prince Achmed,” 1926\n\nMore than a decade before Walt Disney released “Snow White” — often cited as the first animated feature — the German animator Lotte Reiniger completed “The Adventures of Prince Achmed,” which used hand-cut paper silhouettes photographed against a tinted background to tell a fanciful story of enchantment and danger. Like Disney, Reiniger mined the canon of European fairy tales to provide entertainment for children, completing more than 70 films, including versions of “Puss in Boots,” “Hansel and Gretel” and “Cinderella” in a career that began during World War I and lasted until 1980.\n\nLotte Reiniger working on silhouettes for “Prince Achmed.” ullstein bild/Getty Images\n\nIn Berlin in the 1920s, Reiniger was part of an international circle of artists and intellectuals that included Bertolt Brecht and Jean Renoir. She made a handful of live-action films and a series of short sound movies based on operas and classical music. Most of that work is lost, but “Prince Achmed” and the silent shorts that survive testify to the power of her technique, a haunting, painstaking and expressive form of animation with roots in ancient puppetry and shadow theater. Reiniger herself wielded the scissors, fashioning intricate backgrounds and figures that float in blue or pink light"
