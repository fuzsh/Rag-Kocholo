        "text": "Every biography (as I discovered in the course of writing one) can be two books: one about its subject; the other about the adventures arising from the research. I wrote only the former, the one about the subject, and I kept my adventures out of it; even so, they’re relevant in their absence, because, for a biography to be worthwhile, it must also be personal. All good biographies of artists are also books of criticism, reflections of the writer’s judgments, preferences, and passions regarding the work of the artist in question; those guiding tastes and emphases provide the hidden but decisive structure for the information that the book delivers. Even if a biography appears to stick close to the subject’s life, its constellation of information subtly reflects not just the course of research but also the course of the author’s life long before writing a biography was ever in sight.\n\nHere, now, is a remarkable new book that does everything—biography, criticism, film history, memoir, and even fiction, all at once, all out in front. The book is “Suite for Barbara Loden,” by the French author Nathalie Léger, which was originally published in 2012 and is recently out in English translation from the small press Dorothy. It’s all the more remarkable for doing so much in a mere hundred and twenty-three pages (in the translation by Natasha Lehrer and Cécile Menon). Barbara Loden directed one feature film, “Wanda,” from 1970, in which she also starred. She was already an actress, including in “Wild River” and “Splendor in the Grass,” both directed by Elia Kazan, whom she married in 1968. She won a Tony Award for her stage role in Arthur Miller’s “After the Fall,” from 1964. But Loden’s place in artistic history is assured by “Wanda,” one of the best American independent films ever made. She had other projects in mind (including an adaptation of Kate Chopin’s novel “The Awakening”) but was unable to find financing for them. She died of cancer in 1980, at the age of forty-eight.\n\nIt’s apt that “Suite for Barbara Loden” (whose original French title was “Supplément à la Vie de Barbara Loden”—“Supplement to the Life of . . .”) is the work of a French writer. The most significant critical appreciation of “Wanda” is by Marguerite Duras, who, shortly after Loden’s death, interviewed Kazan for Cahiers du Cinéma and discussed the film with him, expressing her desire to distribute the film herself and asserting that “there’s a miracle in ‘Wanda.’ ” Loden was a hero of Europe—her film won a prize at the Venice Film Festival and was screened at Cannes—yet, in its limited release here, in 1971, the film found scant and grudging acceptance. (Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, said that there’s “much to praise” in it, but felt that “its truths . . . are too minor and muted for a feature film” and called it “an unresourceful and monotonous movie visually.”)\n\nIn her combination of the conversational and the incantatory, the fragmentary and the infinite, Léger captures something of Duras’s own tones and moods, yet her approach to Loden and her appreciation of “Wanda” are entirely her own. Léger’s mode of criticism is original and difficult, and she pulls it off with a quiet literary flair: interspersed throughout the book are her descriptions of the movie, scene by scene, with perceptions and emphases that bring the sequences vividly to the imagination while also subtly imbuing them with her own perspectives.\n\nLéger begins with a line that could be the start of a novel—“Seen from a distance, a woman, etched against the darkness”—but that she soon identifies as a moment from early in the film. “Wanda” is the story of Wanda Goronski, a poor resident of a Pennsylvania coal town who withdraws from her family life and accepts a divorce from her husband. Without work, abandoned on a roadside, she wanders into a bar that, unbeknownst to her, is being robbed (the bartender is tied up and out of sight), then gets a ride from a man who turns out to be the robber; she becomes his unintended but then willing accomplice in his next criminal scheme, as well as his lover. Her relationship with this man, whom she calls Mr. Dennis (Michael Higgins), is based on his crude aggression and domineering rigidity and her readiness to submit to his orders, big or small. His schemes culminate in a carefully planned and brutally plotted bank robbery. Structured like a criminal-lovers-on-the-run film noir, filmed with rough-textured documentary-style images that are nonetheless sharply composed with a high-relief, sculptural density, “Wanda” is an existential adventure in which the existence in question is that of Wanda herself—her furious effort at self-recognition and self-creation in a world that controlled her self-image and even effaced it from her own mind.\n\nThe book began, Léger writes, as a commissioned encyclopedia entry about Loden, which she approached in a spirit of overkill that matched what she considered to be the magnitude of the subject: “I felt like I was managing a huge building site, from which I was going to excavate a miniature model of modernity, reduced to its simplest, most complex form: a woman telling her own story through that of another woman.” For Léger, the vastness of her small book is in the greatness of “Wanda”—and of Loden, for making it. She decided not to fulfill the commission and, instead, to write a biography of Loden, but slammed up against an insurmountable set of obstacles:\n\nOne person never answered the phone, another wanted money before they would grant me access to anything, another refused to show me the photographs that she had taken of her in the last year of her life. Cultural organizations had better things to do; there were legal complications that meant that I couldn’t get permission to see any files on her. The librarian responsible for the Elia Kazan archives told me she was sorry, but there was nothing in his papers about his second wife. As for those who had worked with her on the film, they were either dead or didn’t want to talk about it.\n\nThe shadow subject of the book is the impossibility of writing a comprehensive biography of Loden that would be worthy of her. Léger went ahead with the project anyway, turning it into a surrogate biography that replaces the archival material and the interview answers that she can’t get with the work of implication and imagination, replaces the novelistic solidity of an extended biography with the lacunary lyricism of an array of resonant fragments.\n\nStill, Léger pursued a prodigious course of research, including travel to the sites of the shoot and archival trawling that yielded, among other treasures, the original news article, from 1960, that inspired Loden’s film: the story of a woman named Alma Malone, who had taken part in a bank robbery (involving, like Wanda’s, a kidnapping as well) with a man whom she always called Mr. Ansley. The detail that intrigued Loden: at Malone’s sentencing, after her conviction, she thanked the judge, expressing relief at her impending imprisonment. (The anecdote reminds Léger of a line spoken by Jean-Paul Belmondo in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Breathless,” released in 1960; Léger also cites Loden’s own enthusiasm for that film.) Movingly, Léger traces Malone’s own story and discovers that she was released from prison in April, 1970: “She never knew that at that very time her story was being told by Barbara playing the role of Wanda.”\n\nLéger’s multifaceted approach to Loden’s life and work is itself organized around a powerful magnetic field of her own ideas and passions—her recognition of “Wanda” as an essentially feminist masterwork. In the process, the book is, locally, a refutation of feminist critics who, at the time of the film’s release, repudiated it on the grounds of the protagonist’s apparent passivity in the face of masculine authority. Globally, it’s a recalibration of what constitutes, today, a progressively feminist work of art; Léger undercuts the current-day cliché of evaluating films on the basis of their female characters’ degree of “agency” and constructive purpose.\n\nIn her biographical consideration of Loden’s film, Léger quotes Duras’s judgment that “there is an immediate and definitive coincidence between Barbara Loden and Wanda.” She tracks down Loden’s own remarks on the subject, such as “Wanda’s character is based on my own life and character. . . . Everything comes from my own experience,” and a remark, from 1971, to a women’s-film journal, that the film is “like showing myself in a way that I was.” Léger’s sharp aperçu that “Barbara Loden was born in 1932, six years after Marilyn Monroe, two years after my mother, the same year as Elizabeth Taylor, Delphine Seyrig, and Sylvia Plath,” turns out to be no idle list of names. Taylor doesn’t play a role in the book, but Léger’s mother turns up throughout, as a quizzical and practical interlocutor who, when they watched “Wanda” together, told her about her divorce from Léger’s father, about “the violence that had been inflicted on her” in their marriage. (An anecdote about her mother’s blank-eyed amble in a French shopping mall after the divorce runs through the book in correspondence with a similar scene in the film, of the solitary Wanda killing time in a mall.)\n\nLoden’s prize-winning performance in Miller’s play, a pièce à clef about his marriage to Monroe, prompts Léger to riff on the congruences between the two women, with quotes from Kazan and Loden herself (as well as a sharp insight from the director Joseph L. Mankiewicz) to back it up. As for Plath, Léger quotes from her journal regarding her “submerging” herself in a man’s existence and being “supremely happy with my newfound selfless self.” Seyrig is the actress who starred in the title role of Chantal Akerman’s work of grandly intimate fury, “Jeanne Dielman,” as well as in Duras’s “India Song”; Loden both refers to Jeanne’s silence in the film and quotes Seyrig to great effect regarding the essential condition of women: “Actresses do what all women are expected to do. We just throw ourselves into it more.” The book presents Loden’s singularity as nonetheless exemplary of the artistic and personal struggles of women of her generation—and, for that matter, of modern women over all, including Léger herself.\n\nAs Léger conducts her research, she reports not merely the informative results but the first-person experience from which her discoveries arise. The book’s research involved travel to the towns in Pennsylvania and Connecticut where the movie was shot, and Léger describes those trips with an epigrammatic precision that reflects “Wanda” and Loden in their polished facets. In a Pennsylvania mining town, Léger talks with an older waitress from a mining family who describes the process in great detail and with sardonic good humor. A superb set piece finds Léger in the company of a graduate student in Waterbury who gives her a tour of the real-life scrappily handmade Christian theme park where, in the film, Mr. Dennis has an odd and brief reunion with his father. Léger describes motels and bars and roads, towns and radio broadcasts, industrial sites and also telephone calls with Loden’s son and Loden’s former collaborator, turning her own experience into latter-day projections of Loden’s own inner world.\n\nThere’s even what I took to be a fictionalized episode of Léger’s interview of Mickey Mantle, who, the documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman told her, “knew Barbara Loden when she was a dancer at the Copacabana.” Mantle didn’t have anything to say to Léger about Loden, but he talked of his work on his autobiography, of his desire to speak precisely about the inner experience of playing baseball—and of his studies of Melville, Hemingway, and Proust in an effort to learn how to do so. Léger’s expression of her own incredulity—“Mickey Mantle is talking to me about Proust”—doesn’t render the incident any more credible to a reader; rather, it comes off as an unfortunate bookish prejudice that equates verbal expression with high culture. (That prejudice is certainly not shared by Loden, whose dialogue for the unsophisticated characters of “Wanda” has a scarred and jagged poetry.) But it’s the book’s single gross misstep, and one that hardly diminishes its insight, power, or pathos.\n\n“Suite for Barbara Loden” rises to a crescendo along with Léger’s account of the film’s ending, in which she cites Duras’s recognition that Loden “has found a way of making holy the very thing that she has tried to show as a kind of degradation.” Wanda’s utterly guileless indifference has the feeling of an adamant integrity; her total acceptance is rather a total defiance of the norms of society that exclude her from it. The mereness of the world may buffet Wanda as it will, but she isn’t of it. In its exaltation of an absolute purity of heart that resembles an absolute innocence, Loden’s one feature film resembles, above all, the films of Robert Bresson—presenting a vision of uneasy, unwanted heroism, and of a world condemned to need such a heroine. Here, too, Loden’s identity fuses with that of her protagonist."
