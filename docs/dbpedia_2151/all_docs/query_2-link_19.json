        "text": "If forging identities from the long dead of the past can be perilous, it can also enable explorations into the nature of social revolt. Like hagiography, fictions that seek to retell history can reconfigure the past, overcoming its transient, ephemeral nature. But these stories can also draw legitimate attention to the struggles faced by historically oppressed political movements, and redress the anonymity of their principal agents. Rachel Kushner's 2013 novel The Flamethrowers approaches the history of 1970s feminist art in precisely this way, unearthing a range of forgotten feminist artists of the period, assuag-ing and even correcting their historical dispossession. But the novel does more than this by enmeshing this group of imagined artists, which are associated with feminism's second wave, with the overt masculinities of the Futurists of the 1920s and '30s. It gathers together these young Italian Fascists and New York feminists and ensconces them in an abstract bubble of time. To be sure, Kushner places these two movements in counterposition.\n\nNew Day Films was formed in 1972 as a feminist media collective to distribute films addressing gender issues. Forty years later, New Day boasts close to two hundred members and yearly distribution profits of $1 million. This article uses New Day's history to illuminate the economic and political implications of the media collective's recently developed digital platform. It argues that this distribution format extends the logic of the collective, which has informed both New Day's institutional culture and its dominant aesthetics. Drawing on interviews with key New Day members, research on the initial production and reception of the collective's earliest work, and analyses of the style and structure of both canonic and contemporary films in its collection, this article demonstrates that the organization's valorization of collective production and collective political action has a key analogue in its development of an aesthetic of collectivity. This aesthetic helps constitute the political “discussion film” and is coevolving in compelling, interactive ways with New Day's embrace of new technologies for noncommercial distribution."
