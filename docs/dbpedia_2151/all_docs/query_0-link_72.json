        "text": "Controversial filmmaker Gaspar Noé’s 2018 feature film ‘Climax’ opens with a set of interviews being shown on an old television screen, either side of which there are bookshelves. The right-side shelves contain movies, the left books.\n\nAnybody who has seen the film will instantly associate some of the titles with scenes in the movie, if you haven’t seen it this listing may be of use.\n\nHere’s a listing of the books (from the bottom upwards):\n\nFilmmaker Luis Buñuel’s ‘Mon Dernier Soupir’ his autobiography translated by Abigail Israel as ‘My Last Breath’.\n\nPierre Petit ‘Molinier, une vie d’enfer’. Pierre Molinier was a French painter, photographer and “maker of objects”. According to Wikipedia,\n\n“In 1955 Molinier made contact with the leading surrealist Andre Breton and by 1959 was showing at the International Surrealist Exhibition. At this time they defined the purpose of his art as ‘for my own stimulation’, indicating they future direction in one of their exhibits in the 1965 Surrealist show – a dildo.\n\nBetween 1965 and his suicide in 1976, he chronicled his exploration of his subconscious transsexual desires in “Cent Photographies Erotiques”: graphically detailed images of pain and pleasure. Molinier, with the aid of a remote control switch, also began to create photographs in which he assumed the roles of dominatrix and succuba previously taken by the women of his paintings. In these black and white photographs, Molinier, either alone with doll-like mannequins or with female models, appears as a transvestite, transformed by his ‘fetish’ wardrobe of fishnet stockings, suspender belt, stilettos, mask and corset. In montages, an unlikely number of stockinged limbs intertwine to create the women of Molinier’s paintings.\n\nHe declared that all his erotic works had been painted for his own stimulation: “In painting, I was able to satisfy my leg and nipple fetishism.” His primary interest regarding his sexuality was neither the female body or the male body; Molinier said that legs of either sex arouse him equally, as long as they are hairless and dressed up in black stockings. Regarding his dolls, he said: “While a doll can function as a substitute for a woman, there is no movement, no life. This has a certain charm if one is before a beautiful corpse. The doll can, but does not have to become the substitute for a woman”[3]\n\nFor the last 11 years of his life Molinier played out his own most profound moments in the ‘theatre’ of his Bordeaux ‘boudoir – atelier’. He intended his photographs to shock, inviting the viewer to bring to the images his or her own response of excitement or disgust.”\n\n‘L’aventure Hippie’ by Jean-Pierre Bouyxou and Pierre Delannoy. It subject matter is the birth of the sixties counterculture, with a special focus on French developments. It was first published at Plon in 1992.\n\nA title by Carlos Castaneda, Castaneda wrote a series of books that purport to describe training in shamanism that he received under the tutelage of a Yaqui “Man of Knowledge” named don Juan Matus.\n\n‘Taxi Driver’ by Paul Schrader. The film script.\n\n‘Murnau’ by Lotte H. Eisner. A biography of German Expressionist F.W. Murnau which includes a copy of the original script of the film ‘Nosferatu’.\n\n‘Fritz Lang’ (no author shown), one would assume it is a biography or an analysis of his films.\n\nMichel Bakounine ‘Oeuvres’, a selection of works by the Russian revolutionary anarchist. He is among the most influential figures of anarchism and a major figure in the revolutionary socialist, social anarchist, and collectivist anarchist traditions. Bakunin’s prestige as a revolutionary also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.\n\n‘Les Sociétés Secrètes’ (‘Secret Societies’) author indecipherable.\n\n‘Psychopathologie de la vie quotidienne’ by Sigmund Freud. Translated as ‘The Psychopathology of Everyday Life’\n\n‘l’inconscient’ by Sigmund Freud. Translated as ‘The Unconscious’\n\n‘Nietzsche’ by Stefan Zweig. A biographical study of the philosopher Nietzsche.\n\n‘Mi Hermana y yo’ by Freidrich Nietzsche. Translated as ‘My Sister and I’.\n\n‘Mon voyage en enfer’ by Patricia Hearst. The English title is ‘Every Secret Thing’ where Hearst provides her personal account of her activities and relationships beginning with her kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army on February 4, 1974.\n\n‘L’histoire de l’œil’ by Georges Bataille, a 1928 novella written by Georges Bataille that details the increasingly bizarre sexual perversions of a pair of teenage lovers, including an early depiction of omorashi fetishism in Western literature. It is narrated by the young man looking back on his exploits.\n\nVirginie Despentes ‘Baise Moi’. The blurb reads: Manu and Nadine have had all they can take. Manu has been brutally raped and determines it’s not worth leaving anything precious lying vulnerable—including her very self. She teams up with Nadine, a nihilist who watches pornography incessantly, and they enact their own version of les vols et les viols (rape and pillage)—they lure men sexually, use them up, then rob and kill them.\n\n‘Frisson De Bonheur’ by Philippe Vuillemin. I believe this is a rare graphic novel.\n\n‘Le meilleur de moi-meme’ by Philippe Vuillemin\n\nOscar Wilde’s ‘De Profundis’. The letter written by Oscar Wilde during his imprisonment in Reading Gaol, to “Bosie” (Lord Alfred Douglas).\n\nIn its first half, Wilde recounts their previous relationship and extravagant lifestyle which eventually led to Wilde’s conviction and imprisonment for gross indecency. He indicts both Lord Alfred’s vanity and his own weakness in acceding to those wishes. In the second half, Wilde charts his spiritual development in prison and identification with Jesus Christ, whom he characterises as a romantic, individualist artist. The letter begins “Dear Bosie” and ends “Your Affectionate Friend”.\n\n‘Suicide mode d’emploi’ by Claude Guillon and Yves Le Bonniec.\n\n‘Mars’ by Fritz Zorn. ‘Mars’ is an autobiographical book by Fritz Angst (1944–1976) under the pseudonym Fritz Zorn.\n\n‘Cinemas Homosexuels’ by Marcelle Yazbeck. A single issue French cinema journal focussing on homosexuality in cinema, published in 1981 by Papyrus\n\nOsvaldo Lamborghini’s ‘Novelas y cuentos’. Avant-garde Argentine writer this work not translated into English. Two of his stories and three of his poems have been translated and published by Sublunary Editions in the USA (coincidentally his poems appeared in ‘Firmament’ Issue 1.1, where a number of my own ‘Fragments’ also appeared!!!)\n\n‘platt plein daz’ spine does not contain an author\n\nLuis Buñuel and the number “4”. I believe this is Ado Kyrou’s ‘Luis Bunuel, CINEMA D’AUJOURD’HUI No: 4’\n\n‘La Métamorphose’ by Franz Kafka\n\n“Anourses Contes” – whatever that means?\n\nEmil Cioran ‘De l’inconvénient d’être né’. Translated as ‘The Trouble With Being Born’. Here’s a quote for those who have seen the film “We Do not rush toward death, we flee the catastrophe of birth, survivors struggling to forget it.”\n\n‘Les Paradis artificiels’ by Charles Baudelaire. First published in 1860, about the state of being under the influence of opium and hashish. Baudelaire describes the effects of the drugs and discusses the way in which they could theoretically aid mankind in reaching an “ideal” world.\n\n‘Jacques le Fatalist’ by Denis Diderot. (“Jacques the Fatalist and his Master” in translation by various translators).\n\nNietzsche ‘Par-delà le bien et mal’. Translated as ‘Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future’\n\nThe films on the right-hand side of the shelves were a lot simpler to decipher (find):\n\nEraserhead\n\nAngst\n\nZombie\n\nSuspiria\n\nHaraKiri\n\nThe Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome\n\nVibroboy\n\nQuerelle\n\nUn Chien Andalou\n\nSalò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\n\nPossession\n\nThe Mother and the Whore\n\nFox and His Friends\n\nAlthough this has taken me an inordinate amount of time to decipher it has added another layer to the film ‘Climax”, one I thoroughly recommend.\n\nUnited States, 1970, Kent State and Jackson State shootings occur during violent student protests, there’s a burning disenchantment with President Nixon and the Vietnam War, the previous year’s Woodstock Festival is released on film, along with the counterculture films ‘Five Easy Pieces’ and ‘M*A*S*H’. At the 31st Venice Film Festival a small independent film, ‘Wanda’ premiered, winning the Best Foreign Film gong. Despite the award ‘Wanda’, directed by Barbara Loden, was released in a single theatre in New York, “Cinema II”, and was never shown in the rest of the country.\n\nIt quickly slipped from view “Forgotten in the United States”, but “much admired in Europe”, screening at various festivals and events.\n\nPick up a recent textbook about Hollywood movies from the 1970’s and you are likely to come across a ‘Wanda” reference:\n\n…although the auteur renaissance introduced a new American cinema, this generation of movie directors was still by a vast majority male. The few women directors working at the time did not benefit from the commercial Hollywood financing that their male counterparts accessed and instead were relegated to indie micro-financing and playoffs at the art house, university film series, and museum showcases. Even the best of the films made by women in the 1970s remain difficult to find and screen today. For example, in 1970, the accomplished stage actress Barbara Loden produced, wrote, directed, and starred in a terrific no-budget film, Wanda. The film tracks its title character as she stumbles upon a petty criminal with whom she goes on the lam. He treats her with casual cruelty, but she stays with him anyway, because her life before she met him (drinking, sleeping around, sponging off her sister) wasn’t any better. Creatively financed, shot on a shoestring, and distributed by a company otherwise specializing in martial arts imports, Wanda grossed on its first run, such as it was, just over $100,000. “When the Movies Mattered : The New Hollywood Revisited” edited by Johnathan Kirshner & Jon Lewis\n\nThis short precis does not give the film any justice, Wanda, disenchanted with her life leaves her husband and children, in search of something better, throughout she carries a large oversized handbag, which contains her worldly possessions, she grips it so tightly you can also believe it contains her hopes, her memories, her desires.\n\nFast forward forty odd years, and Nathalie Léger has been asked to provide a short encyclopedic entry on ‘Wanda’, and/or Barbara Loden. Her research, obsession, exploration becomes far too detailed to be an encyclopedia entry, it has become a journey, a book, ‘Suite for Barbara Loden’ (translated by Natasha Lehrer and Cécile Menon), and thankfully the wonderful Dorothy Project has brought this French work to English readers.\n\nWhat is it that attracts me so to Wanda? I have never been homeless, I have never abandoned my children, I have never given over my existence or even my financial affairs to any man, I don’t think I have ever entrusted even the most banal area of my life to anyone. I’ve left men, sometimes heartlessly, with the trembling joy that one feels slipping away down a side street, or vanishing into a crowd, or jumping onto a passing train, or standing someone up; the acute and rare pleasure of avoiding something, of evading something, of disappearing into the landscape – but never the experience of surrender. And yet: it did happen to me once, just one time and it was enough, but who hasn’t experienced that – not knowing how to say no, not daring to say it, yielding to the mortal threat, escaping in the end by withdrawal, absence, slipping to the ground, no longer even offering him the gift of fear, no longer pretending, no longer thinking the unthinkable, protecting oneselg in shock, vomiting, the lusted-after body suddenly repulsive, leave me alone, leave me alone. But mostly what happened is that I’ve allowed myself to be pushed around, just waiting for it to be over, preferring misunderstanding over confrontation – it’s impossible in moments like that to think that defending my body could be worth the effort, and anyway what does that mean, “my body,” at the age of fifteen? Only this matters: not to be alone, not to be abandoned.\n\nThis short work is a blend of auto-fiction, research and memoir, like Wanda, Nathalie Léger is carrying around a metaphorical oversized handbag, a repository for her thoughts, a place to store her memories, and her bag becomes the pages you read.\n\nI watched ‘Wanda’ a few years ago when I was doing a 1970’s Hollywood counter-culture binge, and revisited the movie last year with a poet friend of mine, whose insights into the female psyche added an extra layer to this wonderful film. Now I’ve experienced Nathalie Léger’s response, her “Suite for Barbara Loden” and the appreciation again increases.\n\nOnce upon a time the man I loved reproached me for my apparent passivity with other men. We were in the kitchen having breakfast: he told me that he was afraid of that habit particular to women in general and me in particular, in his opinion, of being either unable or unwilling to resist uninvited male desire, of the madness of giving in to whatever they asked of us. He couldn’t understand how hard it is to say no, to be confronted with the desire of another and to reject it – how hard it is and possibly how pointless. How could he not understand the sometimes overwhelming necessity of yielding to the other’s desire to give yourself a better chance of escaping it?\n\nThe book also plays through the various scenes in the movie, “she sits up and gently strokes his forehead until he cries out”, and then fallows Nathalie Léger’s personal attachment to each scene. A short work, this is also a fine accompaniment to a wonderful film.\n\nI have seen a few reviews, of this book, that are quote scathing and I wonder if the reader hadn’t had the opportunity to view Barbara Loden’s film before reading, it was very hard to find, until recently when the Criterion Collection released a restored print. My reading journey was brilliantly enhanced by having a solid grounding and relationship with the film ‘Wanda’ and a fair understanding of Barbara Loden’s struggle to raise funds, be recognized, be acknowledged as someone other than Elia Kazan’s wife, and her subsequent death at only forty-eight years of age. This allowed me to travel with Nathalie Léger and see her peeling away the layers of the film, applying them to her own experiences, justifying her obsessive travel to understand more about Barbara Loden and simply relishing in a gem of a movie that could easily have been lost.\n\nOnce again the Dorothy Project delivers a thoughtful and provocative work of feminist literature, a collection of works that deserve wide readership.\n\nUnder a juniper-tree the bones sang, scattered and shining\n\nWe are glad to be scattered, we did little good to each other,\n\nUnder a tree in the cool of day, with the blessing of sand,\n\nForgetting themselves and each other, united\n\nIn the quiet of the desert.\n\nT.S. Eliot\n\nBlack screen, white text, so opens the 1990 film ‘The Juniper Tree’, written and directed by Nietzchka Keene, based on the Brothers Grimm Fairy Tale. The quote is a short piece taken from the much longer work by T.S. Eliot’s, “Ash Wednesday”.\n\nThe juniper tree is mentioned only twice in Eliot’s poem, both references in part II of the poem, the one above appearing at the end of the section, the other reference at the beginning:\n\nLady, three white leopards sat under a juniper-tree\n\nIn the cool of the day, having fed to sateity\n\nOn my legs my heart my liver and that which had been\n\ncontained\n\nIn the hollow round of my skull. And God said\n\nShall these bones live? shall these\n\nBones live? And that which had been contained\n\nIn the bones (which were already dry) said chirping:\n\nBecause of the goodness of this Lady\n\nAnd because of her loveliness, and because\n\nShe honours the Virgin in meditation,\n\nWe shine with brightness. And I who am here dissembled\n\nProffer my deeds to oblivion, and my love\n\nTo the posterity of the desert and the fruit of the gourd.\n\nReading Eliot’s poem, I found the juniper tree reference removed from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, although there are some similarities.\n\n‘The Juniper Tree’ published in the Grimms’ collection was written by Philipp Otto Range, and has been seen as a counterpart of the Greek myth of Cronus, who devours his children in order to ensure he retains his power. The tale opens:\n\nA long time ago, as many as two thousand years ago, there lived a rich man with a wife who was both beautiful and good. They loved each other dearly, but they had no children, even though they longed for them. Day and night the wife prayed for a child, but still they had none.\n\nShe becomes pregnant and “in the seventh month, she picked the berries from the juniper tree and gorged herself on them until she became miserable and was ailing. According to the classical antiquity physician Galen, the juniper tree’s berries can be used for contraceptive purposes and to induce abortion. However the mother eventually “bore a child as white as snow and as red as blood. When she saw the child, she felt so happy that she died of joy.” The child was a boy, the husband buries the mother under the juniper tree.\n\nHe remarries and his second wife gives birth to a daughter. “When the woman looked at her daughter, she felt nothing but love for her, but whenever she looked at the little boy, she felt sick at heart….The devil got hold of her so that she began to hate the little boy, and she slapped him around and pinched him here and cuffed him there.” The second wife eventually beheads the young boy by slamming the lid of an apple chest onto him as he is reaching for an apple. “The mother then took the little boy and chopped him up. She put the pieces into a pot and cooked them up into a stew.” The father thought the stew tasted really good and as he ate “he threw the bones under the table.” The daughter collects the bones in her silk handkerchief and puts them “down in the green grass under the juniper tree.”\n\n“The juniper tree began stirring. Its branches parted and came back together again as though it were clapping its hands for joy. A mist arose from the tree, and right in the middle of the mist a flame was burning, and from the flame a beautiful bird emerged and began signing gloriously.”\n\nThe bird, the boy reincarnated, sings:\n\n“My mother, she slew me,\n\nMy father, he ate me,\n\nMy sister, Marlene,\n\nGathered my bones,\n\nTied them in silk,\n\nFor the juniper tree.\n\nTweet, tweet, what a fine bird am I!”\n\nSinging and collecting, a golden chain, a pair of red shoes and a mill stone. Continually singing his song, he drops the golden chain for his father, the red shoes for his sister and drops the millstone on the mother’s head crushing “her to death.” The smoke, flames and fire return and the “little brother was back, standing right there. He took his father and Little Marlene by the hand, and the three of them were filled with joy. Then they went back in the house, sat down at the table, and dined.”\n\nA fable filled with eating aligned with death, gorging the juniper berries, apple chest, the child cooked as stew, happily dining once the step-mother is deceased, it is also a tale of childhood innocence vanishing and, according to the notes in “The Annotated Brothers Grimm”, “by crushing the mother and joining the father, the children have been seen as “successfully” negotiating the path from dependence to autonomy.”\n\nT.S. Eliot’s poem has a few similar references, primarily the bones, other interpretations of his poem state that the juniper tree in Eliot’s poem references the Bible – I Kings 19 (in some Bible versions it is a “broom bush” or “broom tree”, however in the King James Bible it is a “juniper tree”).\n\nAnd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.\n\nThe poet is lost in the woods and like Elijah in the Bible, who is lost in the desert, he is nourished and renewed by an angel.\n\nOnto the film, where we have a single father, with a son, Jonas, and two sisters who are seeking a new home as their mother has been stoned and burned for being a witch. The older sister becomes the stepmother, by using witchcraft, potions and incantations to attract the single father as her husband. The connection to nature, as appears in the Grimm Brothers tale is here, an early scene showing Björk, who plays the youngest sister Margit, reciting an incantation to stop the buzzing of the fly, and soon thereafter she entertains the young Jonas with shadow puppets, using her hands, whose actions align perfectly with the crowing of the rooster or the barking of the dog. Margit has a power over nature.\n\nThe film is filled with religious symbolism, crucifixes, prayer as well as the witchcraft elements. Margit also having visions of a mother figure.\n\nWhilst the film does have elements of the Grimm fairy story, it deviates in a significant number of areas, a stand alone work that feels more aligned to religious and witchcraft themes, and less to the family, natural world, eating associated with death and childhood growth themes.\n\nI loved the Brothers Grimm tale for its extreme themes, I rather enjoyed the movie and I question the T.S. Eliot reference, did the director just see a juniper tree in a poem and thought “I’ll make that the epigraph”?\n\nSeems readers like the merging of poetry and film, last week’s post about Roy Andersson’s film featuring Peruvian poet César Vallejo’s poem ‘Stumble Between Two Stars’ has been my most popular post for 2020. Let’s continue the theme.\n\n“The only female director of the French New Wave, Agnès Varda has been called both the movement’s mother and its grandmother” according to Criterion. Her short, 12 minute, film ‘Les dites cariatides’ (‘The So-Called Caryatides’) (1984) was made for French television, and features the music of Offenbach (his 1864 opera bouffe ‘La Belle Hélène’) and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire.\n\nThe film opens with a slow panning shot of a nude bronze sculpture light pole and then a nude man walking the streets of Paris. From the off the feminist themes abound, I won’t comment on these here, but if you’re after an explanation of the feminist themes in this short film I highly recommend the article “Wandering in the Presence of Women: Les dites cariatides” by Eloise Ross – click here for a link.\n\nCaryatides, “the bearers of doors, lintels, capitals or balconies.” Agnès Varda tells us their origins and a brief history, whilst her camera pans from feet to head across a number of Parisian examples, from the late 19th century. In Paris there a twelve twin like men – “Pairs symmetrical but not identical” the males representing force and power, there are fifty twin like females, naked, bearing the weight on their heads, calm and composed.\n\nPoems from Charles Baudelaire’s ‘The Flowers of Evil’ are read by Agnès Varda, again whilst the camera pans the caryatides. The subtitles on the version of the film I watched were uncredited, so I can’t direct you to the translator, however I transposed a number of the lines and have managed to find three of the poems in ‘The Flowers of Evil’ (with very different translations).\n\nSonnet XLIII\n\nWhat sayest thou, to-night, poor soul so drear,\n\nWhat sayest—heart erewhile engulfed in gloom,\n\nTo the very lovely, very chaste, and very dear,\n\nWhose god-like look hath made thee to re-bloom?\n\nTo her, with pride we chant an echoing Hymn,\n\nFor nought can touch the sweetness of her sway;\n\nHer flesh ethereal as the seraphim,\n\nHer eyes with robe of light our souls array.\n\nAnd be it in the night, or solitude,\n\nAmong the streets or ‘mid the multitude,\n\nHer shadow, torch-like, dances in the air,\n\nAnd murmurs, “I, the Beautiful proclaim—\n\nThat for my sake, alone ye love the Fair;\n\nI am the Guardian Angel, Muse and Dame!”\n\nIllusionary Love\n\nWhen I behold thee wander by, my languorous love,\n\nTo songs of viols which throughout the dome resound,\n\nHarmonious and stately as thy footsteps move,\n\nBestowing forth the languor of thy glance profound.\n\nWhen I regard thee, glowing in the gaslight rays,\n\nThy pallid brow embellished by a charm obscure,\n\nHere where the evening torches light the twilight haze,\n\nThine eyes attracting me like those of a portraiture,\n\nI say—How beautiful she is! how strangely rich!\n\nA mighty memory, royal and commanding tower,\n\nA garland: and her heart, bruised like a ruddy peach,\n\nIs ripe—like her body for Love’s sapient power.\n\nArt thou, that spicy Autumn-fruit with taste supreme?\n\nArt thou a funeral vase inviting tears of grief?\n\nAroma—causing one of Eastern wastes to dream;\n\nA downy cushion, bunch of flowers or golden sheaf?\n\nI know that there are eyes, most melancholy ones,\n\nWherein no precious secret deeply hidden lies,\n\nResplendent shrines, devoid of relics, sacred stones,\n\nMore empty, more profound than ye yourselves, O skies?\n\nYea, does thy semblance, not alone for me suffice,\n\nTo kindle senses which the cruel truth abhor?\n\nAll one to me! thy folly or thy heart of ice,\n\nDecoy or mask, all hail! thy beauty I adore!\n\nBoth of the above translated by Cyril Scott.\n\nThe third poem, the first Agnès Varda quotes is “Beauty”\n\nBeauty\n\nI am fair, O mortals! like a dream carved in stone,\n\nAnd my breast where each one in turn has bruised himself\n\nIs made to inspire in the poet a love\n\nAs eternal and silent as matter.\n\nOn a throne in the sky, a mysterious sphinx,\n\nI join a heart of snow to the whiteness of swans;\n\nI hate movement for it displaces lines,\n\nAnd never do I weep and never do I laugh.\n\nPoets, before my grandiose poses,\n\nWhich I seem to assume from the proudest statues,\n\nWill consume their lives in austere study;\n\nFor I have, to enchant those submissive lovers,\n\nPure mirrors that make all things more beautiful:\n\nMy eyes, my large, wide eyes of eternal brightness!\n\nTranslated by William Aggeler, and if you’d like the original text with other translations click here.\n\nMore poetry on film and as I come across further examples I may post them here, Agnès Varda’s film may be short at only 12 minutes but it packs a lot into that time, worth hunting down.\n\nSomething a little different from me. Literature and film culture blending.\n\nAn homage to Peruvian poet César Vallejo appears at the beginning of Roy Andersson’s 2000 film ‘Songs From The Second Floor’. “Älskade Vare De Som Säter Sig (“Blessed be those who sit down”) – César Vallejo 1892- 1938 In Memorium”\n\nThe film itself featuring lines from Vallejo’s poem ‘Stumble Between Two Stars’ and featuring numerous scenes that are direct references to the poem (for example, a door closed on a finger).\n\nThe film shared the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000, and reading a few online reviews, it appears as though several reviewers didn’t check the very obvious César Vallejo references.\n\nI thought I’d present the poem here for people who have watched, or will watch the Swedish filmmaker’s first film in a trilogy, followed by ‘You, The Living’ (2007) and ‘A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence’ (2014). Worthwhile films indeed.\n\nSTUMBLE BETWEEN TWO STARS\n\nThere are people so wretched, they don’t even\n\nhave a body; quantitative the hair,\n\nlowers, in inches, the affable grief;\n\nthe mode, above;\n\ndon’t look for me, the molar of oblivion,\n\nthey appear to come out of the air, to add up sighs mentally, to hear\n\nsharp lashes on their palates!\n\nThey leave their skin, scratching at the sarcophagus in which they are born\n\nand rise through their death hour after hour\n\nand fall, along their frozen alphabet, to the ground.\n\nPity for so much! pity for so little! pity for those women!\n\nThe pity in my room, hearing them wear glasses!\n\nThe pity in my thorax, when they buy dresses!\n\nPity for my white grime, in their combined scum!\n\nBeloved be the Sanchez ears,\n\nbeloved the people who sit down,\n\nbeloved the unknown man and his wife,\n\nthe neighbor with sleeves, neck and eyes!\n\nBeloved be that one with bedbugs,\n\nthe one who wears a torn shoe in the rain,\n\nthe one waking the corpse of a loaf with two matches,\n\nthe one who clothes a door on a finger,\n\nthe one who has no birthdays,\n\nthe one who has lost his shadow in a fir,\n\nthe beast, the one who looks like a parrot,\n\nthe one who looks like a man, the rich poor man,\n\nthe complete skinflint, the poor poor man!\n\nBeloved be\n\nthe one who is hungry or thirsty, but has no\n\nhunger with which to satiate all his thirst,\n\nnor thirst with which to satiate all his hungers!\n\nBeloved be the one who works by the day, by the month, by the hour,\n\nthe one who sweats from pain or from shame,\n\nthat one who goes, by order of his hands, to the movies,\n\nthe one who pays with what he lacks,\n\nthe one who sleeps on his back,\n\nthe one who no longer remembers his childhood; beloved be\n\nthe bald man without a hat,\n\nthe just man without thorns,\n\nthe thief without roses,\n\nthe one who wears a watch and has seen God,\n\nthe one who has an honor and does not die!\n\nBeloved be the child, who falls and still cries\n\nand the man who has fallen and no longer cries!\n\nPity for so much! Pity for so little! Pity for them!\n\nTaken from ‘The Complete Poetry César Vallejo – A Bilingual Edition’ (translated by Clayton Eshleman)\n\nPersonally I’m not convinced this is a great translation “the one who clothes a door on a finger” (“el que se coje un dedo en una puerta”) surely it means “the one who catches their finger in a door”? There are other translations of the poem available online, seek them out if you’re intrigued."
