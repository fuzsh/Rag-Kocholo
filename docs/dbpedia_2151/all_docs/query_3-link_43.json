On this wanderful (groan) episode of Oeuvre Busters, George and Liam discuss Barbara Loden's foundational film, Wanda, from the so-so year of 1970. Your podcast hosts also take a look at Loden's appearance on the Dick Cavett show of the same year and what turns out to be a rather awkward interview. Topics discussed in this episode: George's creaking chair; genre hopping; the necessary drug that is coffee; the proper way to eat pasta; and class politics in America. Also, we beg the Criterion collection to let us in the closet, because we love free shit.Also, for more on Wanda, please take a look at these amazing essays on the film and on its legacy as a feminist classic: https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5811-wanda-now-reflections-on-barbara-loden-s-feminist-masterpieceWanda is now available on the new Criterion channel for streaming, so check it out when you can!Topics not discussed: the fascist radio broadcasts of American poet Ezra Pound, and how these radio appearances led to Pound being charged with treason at the end of World War 2.Once again, thank you for rating, reviewing and subscribing whenever and wherever you can! We appreciate all the love!\"Robobozo\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",
