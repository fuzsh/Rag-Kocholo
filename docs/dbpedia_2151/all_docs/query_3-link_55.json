        "text": "Cara Jocelyn Delevingne (born 12 August 1992 in London, England) is a British fashion model, voice actress, model, actress, and socialite who voices herself as the DJ of Non Stop Pop FM in Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.\n\nBiography[]\n\nDelevingne is an English model and actress, winner of \"Model of the Year\" at the 2012 British Fashion Awards. She has had a varied career in the fashion world. First it was the face of Burberry Beauty campaign in 2012, the face of the spring/summer 2011 collection - 2012 Burberry and a long list of brands such as H&M, Zara, and Chanel. She starred in films such as Paper Towns and Suicide Squad. Her initial voiceover work for GTA V predates all but one credit of her film acting career, making her role as DJ Cara one of her first acting performances.\n\nIn-Game Persona[]\n\nGTA's Cara is presented as a hyper-energetic fan of dance-pop, fixated on making people get up and dance. It's implied that she might be on ecstasy as she hosts her radio show, since she reminds herself (and her audience) to \"stay hydrated\" before commercial breaks, unless they want to pass out. Fainting spells due to dehydration is a common side-effect of recurring ecstasy use.\n\nShe's also presented as a big fan of the game Righteous Slaughter 7 and its series to the point where she often plays the game during commercial breaks. Although, she takes offense to the game's fan community, citing how obnoxious and profanity-prone players are on the live audio chat by claiming if males who played the game were nicer, more females would play. It is also presented that she enjoyed watching the film The Loneliest Robot in Great Britain and its main character, which may be a reference to the fact she is of British origin.\n\nOn the whole, DJ Cara exhibits a cheery on-air disposition and emphasizes enjoying life.\n\nRelationship with GTA Saga[]\n\nDelevingne followed Karl Lagerfeld (radio DJ K109 The Studio), as a personality from the fashion world chosen to DJ a GTA radio station. She had posted on Twitter that she would be a DJ in GTA V; she is the DJ on the station Non Stop Pop FM. The enhanced version of GTA V includes a number of introductions and other dialogue by her that weren't in the original release. These were recorded in a second recording session, rather than being held from the original session, as she tweeted that she was back with Rockstar to update her clips for new versions of the game.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nCara has mentioned on-air that she's been the recipient of at least two \"creepy\" texts from Hugh Harrison, a judge on Fame or Shame; it can be assumed that he is attracted to her.\n\n[]\n\nCara Delevingne on Twitter\n\nCara Delevingne's IMDb Entry\n\nNavigation[]"
