        "text": "If forging identities from the long dead of the past can be perilous, it can also enable explorations into the nature of social revolt. Like hagiography, fictions that seek to retell history can reconfigure the past, overcoming its transient, ephemeral nature. But these stories can also draw legitimate attention to the struggles faced by historically oppressed political movements, and redress the anonymity of their principal agents. Rachel Kushner's 2013 novel The Flamethrowers approaches the history of 1970s feminist art in precisely this way, unearthing a range of forgotten feminist artists of the period, assuag-ing and even correcting their historical dispossession. But the novel does more than this by enmeshing this group of imagined artists, which are associated with feminism's second wave, with the overt masculinities of the Futurists of the 1920s and '30s. It gathers together these young Italian Fascists and New York feminists and ensconces them in an abstract bubble of time. To be sure, Kushner places these two movements in counterposition.\n\nThis thesis is a two-part work. Its components, a written paper and a one-night symposium/film screening event entitled Tennessee Williams: Gender Play in 2015 and Beyond, have been closely coordinated with my dramaturgical research for the February 2015 University of Massachusetts Amherst Department of Theater production of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\" The written inquiry is structured around a chronological, selected American production history of \"Cat\"; this history, rendered in a series of three case studies, will (1) synthesize preexisting analyses of \"Cat\"’s dramaturgical profile, its impact on American theater, and its position in Williams’s oeuvre; and (2) examine the interplay between this body of scholarship’s primary foci (e.g., gender, sexual identity, and family dysfunction) and the evolving cultural climate in which its subject, \"Cat,\" is perennially reinterpreted and restaged. In other words, my thesis reframes \"Cat\" as a series of inherently American—and potentially unanswerable—questions posed by Williams to his viewers; it then investigates the artistic and critical responses generated by sixty years of public engagement, or “dialogue,” with those questions. Ultimately, each case study will illustrate my central premise: that the value of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" lies in its ability to resonate, both in production design and reception, with the social, sexual, and domestic challenges of the period in which it is produced.\n\nElia Kazan is remembered primarily for two reasons: as filmmaker and as informer. These two sides to his personality come together in his most famous picture, On the Waterfront (1954). For that reason, this film can be analyzed either as a metaphor for the events of early 1950s that left deep marks on American history, or as an apology for Kazan’s own role as informer during House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) hearings in 1952. But there is much more to On the Waterfront and to Kazan’s filmmaking than this. In most of his films, he focused on individuals who faced pressure from contradictory forces, subject to crises and changes that proved both existential and historical. However, if we were to rely solely on contemporary critics and later film historians, especially Americans, we may be led to a judgment that reduces the film to a single meaning: that it constituted a defense and justification for the crime Kazan committed in 1952, when he informed on eleven ex-comrades from an American Communist Party cell, where he had been active between 1934 and 1936. Any effort to understand Elia Kazan as historian necessarily must consider both the scenes depicted in his films as well as the apprehension of these images by film historians and critics. They speak less of Kazan’s films than of the violent confrontation — which constitutes his main theme — between different orders of truth and of an understanding of reality. And when they do speak of Kazan in some way, they do so more eloquently when referring to his appropriation of a discourse belonging to the “other”, the distinct, one who had belonged to a group but refused to abide by its rules. In presenting Kazan’s vision of America, this article shows how the same discourse emanating from an “outcast” becomes neutralized and rejected precisely in that which it proposes as most original. In other words, it is possible to understand one director’s contribution to an understanding of the history of his times, while at the same time take into account how his work is digested by film critics and by historians. At the same time, both the discourse and the way it is perceived by others document the same story.\n\n[co-authored with Carl Burgchardt] This essay analyzes Elia Kazan’s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), an adaptation of Betty Smith’s bestselling novel of the same title (published two years earlier). The central visual elements in this film are thresholds or openings, such as windows, doorways, and stairways, which together comprise a liminal space whose crossings serve as the literal inscriptions of Kazan’s dialectical project. These are sites of indeterminacy, where personal transitions and economic transactions take place. Significantly, the film’s most intense moments of emotional harmony and discord occur in front of (or through) these in-between thresholds, where softness gives way to hardness (and vice versa). The alternating pattern of harmony, contrasted with interpersonal conflict, constitutes what the authors call the ‘emotional dialectics’ of the film. Transitions from dreamy contentment to harsh realization or an awareness of the hard truth of a situation occur rapidly in these liminal spaces. Building on the work of theorists such as André Bazin, Jean Mitry, and Dudley Andrew, the essay concludes that A Tree Grow in Brooklyn not only targets the relational chasms to be crossed by its main characters but also builds a bridge between the producers of the past (including director Kazan) and viewers of the present, contemporary audiences who are asked to peer through a cinematic ‘window’ and partake in a view of the warmth and intimacy to be found in an immigrant family’s life.\n\nThis essay explores the use of sound–image disjunction in Marguerite Duras's India Song (1975) in relation to migration, bilingualism and cinema's metaphoric potential. Employing sound–image disjunction with unprecedented constancy, the cinema of Duras traces a sustained exploration of the creative possibilities of this formal strategy and its capacity to establish a signifying relation between otherwise irreconcilable elements. A key work in this respect, India Song evinces a desire to not only reconstruct memories of the filmmaker's past (in Indochina), but to bring these into relation with the present (in France), and to do so through the construction of a new and foundational bind between word and image; in short, to create a single, meaningful reality out of a linguistically and geographically disjoined experience. Striving towards this difficult goal, Duras focuses on the unification of word and image through what might best be termed the filmic equivalent of a metaphorical utterance or act. In so doing, she raises a number of questions with regard to the complex interactions between sound and image in the cinema, as well as the latter's relationship to language as such. This essay therefore aims to elucidate Duras's basic formal strategy, especially as evidenced in India Song, and to consider its broader implications for the relationship between language, migration and cinematic practice."
