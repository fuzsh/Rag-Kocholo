        "text": "The Pioneering American Jewish Women Directors\n\nFrom Elaine May to Claudia Weill\n\nLAWRENCE BARON\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFor most of the silent movie era American studios employed a considerable number of women directors. Initially churning out low-budget shorts, the studios emulated the egalitarian practices of live theatre, where the positions men and women filled were fluid. Popular actresses like Mary Pickford and directors like Alice Guy-Blaché and Lois Weber even founded their own production companies. As the Hollywood movie industry evolved into a profitable big business dependent on the profits from star-studded feature films, it consolidated around a handful of major studios that were managed like corporations and required external investment. Their owners gradually removed women from the ranks of directors out of concern that having women in such a key role would scare off financiers.1 The gender criteria for various filmmaking jobs negotiated by the craft unions thereafter further limited the opportunities for women to direct.2\n\nFrom the 1930s until the 1960s, Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino were the only women directing studio feature films.3 During this period, women directors gravitated to New York, where documentary, experimental, and independent filmmaking was centered. In New York film circles there were two notable Jewish women precursors of the directors discussed in this essay. Maya Deren created avant-garde motion pictures that eventually earned her the title of being “the mother of underground film.”4\n\nShirley Clarke specialized in documentaries and gritty realistic feature films about urban drug and gang subcultures. Her Robert Frost: A Lover’s Quarrel with the World (1963) won an Oscar for best documentary feature.5 Neither Deren nor Clarke directly addressed Jewish themes in their works.\n\nPostwar changes in American society in general, and the film industry in particular, paved the way for the increased entry of women directors into Hollywood moviemaking during the 1970s. The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and establishment of the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission in 1965 promoted gender equality in hiring. The cultural and social turmoil of the 1960s fostered the development of progressive ethnic, feminist, and youth audiences who sought less formulaic cinematic fare. The decline in movie viewership resulting from competition primarily from television and secondarily from foreign films spurred Hollywood to fund films more attuned to the tastes of those emerging audiences. The Production Code of 1930 that prescribed the morally acceptable ways female characters could be portrayed on screen was replaced by a more permissive rating system in 1968, facilitating the subsequent production of films covering a broader spectrum of female experiences. The major studios pledged to uphold federal demands for eliminating gender bias in employment as mandated by federal law but relied more on tokenism than a systematic plan for doing so.6 Nevertheless, between 1967 and 1980, the number of women directors of American feature films rose to seventeen.7\n\nThe emergence of what has been variously termed the “American New Wave,” “New Hollywood Cinema,” or the “Hollywood Renaissance” from those years converged with the burgeoning assertiveness of Jewish Americans to identify openly with their immigrant origins, the Holocaust, Israel, or Judaism.8 Within the world of entertainment, this phenomenon manifested itself with the rise of a generation of Jewish celebrities like Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Allen, and Lenny Bruce, who neither downplayed nor masked their ethnic or religious backgrounds as had been common practice in Hollywood. In turn Jewish Americans took pride in the fame of these coreligionists.9 Film historian Vincent Brook has contended that Jewish filmmakers like Woody Allen, Stanley Kubrick, Sidney Lumet, Mike Nichols, and many others were so overrepresented among the directors associated with the “New Hollywood” that their contributions to this body of films could be dubbed the “Jew Wave.”10\n\nAlthough the vast majority of the directors Brook mentions are men, three women appear on the list of Jewish directors he compiled: Elaine May (née Berlin), Joan Micklin Silver, and Claudia Weill.11 Feminist scholars usually include this triumvirate in their discussions of significant American women directors.12 Patricia Erens recognizes their early films in her survey of American Jewish cinema,13 whereas Lester Friedman omits Weill from his book on the same topic. His study of Jewish American directors, coauthored with David Desser, devotes one paragraph to May and two sentences to Micklin Silver.14 The cohort of Jewish women directors between 1967 and 1980, however, extends beyond May, Micklin Silver, and Weill to encompass Joan Darling (née Kugell), Lee Grant (née Rosenthal), Joan Rivers (née Molinsky), Stephanie Rothman, and Linda Yellen. Jewish women comprised eight of the seventeen women directing\n\nAmerican feature films during this period.\n\nFurthermore, May, Micklin Silver, and Weill made films that explored women’s issues in the context of narratives about Jewish characters. This essay analyzes their different approaches to addressing feminist and Jewish concerns in their movies from the 1970s. It will briefly examine the continuity in their later works and how being a woman affected the trajectories of their careers. Finally, it will assess their impact on American cinema.\n\nELAINE MAY\n\nIn 1971 Elaine May directed A New Leaf, becoming the first woman to direct a feature film for Paramount Pictures since Dorothy Arzner in 1931 and the first to helm a Hollywood studio film since Ida Lupino in 1966.15 She directed three more studio films in the 1970s and 1980s, surpassing Barbara Loden, whose critically acclaimed independent film Wanda (1970) is regarded as the first significant woman’s movie of the New Hollywood era, but who never directed another feature film.16 Both went from being successful entertainers, a stage and screen actor in Loden’s case, and actor and improvisational comedian in May’s. Their pathway to directing had historical precedents in the careers of Lois Weber and Ida Lupino, both of whom transitioned from being actors to directors. It would become a common career progression for the Jewish women directors who followed May like Lee Grant, Barbra Streisand, and Goldie Hawn in the 1980s. Possessing connections and fame helped but did not guarantee that these female performers would overcome the reservations male studio executives and their financial backers harbored about the ability of women to oversee the production of a profitable product. The American Film Institute tacitly acknowledged this gender bias by populating the majority of its first Directing Workshop for Women in 1975 with prominent actors, comedians, producers, and writers. Only three of its nineteen participants had prior directing experience.17\n\nBorn in 1932, May grew up in the Yiddish theatre where her father directed and both her parents acted. Her father cast her in productions starting at a young age. When her father died, her mother moved to Los Angeles. May dropped out of school when she was fourteen, married two years later, and gave birth to her daughter Jeannie the following year. She soon divorced her husband, trained as a method actor, and audited courses at the University of Chicago. She met Mike Nichols in 1954 as an ensemble member of the city’s Compass Players, where both honed their improvisational comedy skills. They became a celebrated comedy team on television variety programs, the concert circuit, and eventually on Broadway but split up in 1962. During the remainder of the 1960s, May concentrated on acting in movies and writing film and stage scripts. After adapting the short story “The Green Heart” by Jack Ritchie into the screenplay for A New Leaf, she persuaded Walter Matthau to play the male lead in it if she could secure funding for the movie. May enlisted Arthur Penn, who had directed her Broadway show, to assist her in selling the script to Paramount and soliciting producers to fund it. Attempting to preempt studio interference in the casting and editing of A New Leaf, she agreed to act, direct, and write the film for $50,000 even though Matthau received $375,000 as his salary. This disparity illustrated the inequalities women faced even when they were elevated to the position of director.18\n\nMatthau played Henry, a scion of a wealthy family who has squandered his inheritance. He hatches a scheme to marry a rich woman and then murder her to inherit her money. Henrietta, played by May, is both affluent and single. Despite being repulsed by her klutziness, sloppiness, and social ineptitude, he proposes and they wed. Henrietta, a famous botanist, epitomizes the absentminded professor who is brilliant in her field, but naïve about romance. May mines the incongruities of the couple for laughs. For example, Henry tries to impress her with his taste in fine wines, but she insists they drink tropical coolers mixed with Manischewitz Malaga. Her naming of a new species of fern after him and fawning dependence lead to his change of heart when he has the opportunity to let her drown during a camping trip and instead rescues her.19\n\nA New Leaf previewed the way May depicts female characters, which initially elicited consternation from feminist movie critics but subsequently has engendered a reappraisal that her portrayals of men are more negative than of women. While cognizant of how hateful Henry appears, film historian Barbara Koenig Quart castigated May for portraying Henrietta as clumsy, incompetent, insecure, and stupid. She interprets Henrietta’s fondness for Manischewitz as code that she is Jewish and lacking refinement, overlooking that there is nothing else in the film suggesting that she is Jewish.20 Notwithstanding the humorous characterization of Henrietta’s traits, she evokes sympathy as a trusting and vulnerable soul, contrasting sharply with Henry’s lethal duplicity.21 As Melissa Anderson astutely observes, “With A New Leaf, May established a theme that runs through the quartet of films she’s directed: the derangements of coupledom, whether sexual or platonic, with a breezy but still biting focus on the pitiful vanities and obtuseness of men.”22\n\nMoreover, the way May originally envisioned Henry was far darker than that of a cad who merits forgiveness when he saves Henrietta. A subplot in the rough cut of the film has Henry poisoning two people whom he discovered were blackmailing Henrietta. May’s version of the film ran 3 hours, a prohibitive length for a comedy. The studio reduced it to 102 minutes, eliminating the storyline about Henry’s unpardonable crimes. Irate over the bowdlerization of her film, May sued in vain to remove her name from the film and prevent its release. The abridgement A New Leaf underwent and the omission of Henry’s homicidal acts probably rendered it funnier and more watchable. In spite of going over budget and not reflecting May’s bleaker intention, it recouped its production costs and earned Golden Globe nominations for best motion picture comedy or musical and best actress for May’s performance.23\n\nMay’s second movie, The Heartbreak Kid (1972), features two Jewish lead characters,24 Lenny played by Charles Grodin and Lila played by her daughter, Jeannie Berlin. Lenny projects an aura of being a playboy whose dapper clothes, sports car, and pipe smoking belie his job as a store-to-store sports equipment salesman. Lila, a sweet curly haired woman who is a bit zaftig and plain looking, expects Lenny to wait to have intercourse until they are married. Their Jewish wedding is a haimish [unpretentious] affair held in her parents’ living room, where there is barely enough space to seat the guests. Lenny comfortably schmoozes with her family and their friends, with whom he dances the obligatory hora to the tune of “Hava Nagila.” During the drive to Miami for their honeymoon, Lenny quickly finds Lila’s emotional neediness, sexual inexperience, sloppy eating habits, and voice irritating. In Miami Lila gets badly sunburned on the couple’s first day, requiring her to remain in the hotel room until the blistering and pain subside. Lenny exploits her absence to court a beautiful blond named Kelly Corcoran whom he meets on the beach. Played by Cybill Shepherd, Kelly’s cool demeanor, lithe figure, and sexy innuendos mark her as the polar opposite of Lila. To be with Kelly, he lies to Lila about why he frequently leaves her alone in the hotel room. Lenny rashly decides to divorce Lila and marry Kelly. After Lenny shares his intention with her parents over dinner, Mr. Corcoran vehemently opposes the idea. His motive may stem from antisemitism too, given that he moved his family out of the hotel where Lenny and Lila were staying because he didn’t like “the element” there.\n\nSeveral days later when Lila feels better, Lenny takes her to a fancy restaurant to break the bad news. He eases into it by obliquely philosophizing about the inevitability of all things ending, which Lila misconstrues as intimating that he is dying from a terminal disease. He loses his patience and blurts out that he wants out of the marriage. Crestfallen and shocked, Lila moans, sobs, and tries to go to the bathroom to vomit. Lenny insensitively tries to placate and silence her by offering water to drink, promising she can keep his car and the wedding gifts, and remarking it is better that their breakup happened before they had children. Having jettisoned Lila, he embarks on a quest to Minneapolis to win over Kelly and her father. He scares off Kelly’s boyfriend by posing as an undercover narcotics agent who threatens to bust him and his friends for smoking marijuana, while he wears down Mr. Corcoran with his relentlessness and refusal to accept a $25,000 dollar bribe to stop pursuing Kelly. The antiseptic coolness of the church ceremony and fancy reception for Lenny and Kelly constitute the antithesis of the small wedding Lila and he had. Lenny’s platitudinous banter with two children attending the event results in both walking away and leaving him alone on a couch. The isolation he experiences inverts the traditional message of “love conquers all” conveyed by Hollywood romantic comedies about couples from different ethnic or religious backgrounds—often emblematized by Irish and Jewish pairings like Lenny and Kelly—and resembles The Way We Were (1973) and Annie Hall (1977), where such couples fail to overcome these differences.25 Lawrence Epstein has contended that “The Heartbreak Kid is an argument against romantic assimilation.”26\n\nAlthough The Heartbreak Kid was a commercial and critical hit, the criticism leveled at it came mostly from feminists who expected women directors to portray female characters more sympathetically.27 Barbara Quart considered Lila “one of the most negative images of a Jewish woman on film—created by a Jewish woman, with her own daughter in the role of the offensive woman.”28 Blame for this can be partially ascribed to Bruce Jay Friedman, who wrote the short story that inspired the screenplay by Neil Simon, which Friedman dedicated “to any man who has ever, for one fleeting moment or more, harbored the thought that his wife was not absolutely the most wonderful woman he has met.”29 Simon bears some responsibility too, since he typically exaggerates the idiosyncrasies of characters for laughs. Parenthetically, he had preferred casting Diane Keaton in the role of Lila to clarify that Lenny’s decision was based on Lila’s annoying quirks and not on her appearance.30\n\nYet the unflattering similarities between Henrietta and Lila point to May’s role in creating women leads whose affectionate blind trust renders them perfect foils for deceitful men. May’s comedy routines about Jewish women often relied on popular stereotypes. The famous skit of her playing a domineering Jewish mother phoning her scientist son performed by Mike Nichols captures, in Joyce Antler’s opinion, “the mixture of guilt, dependency, and rebelliousness that came to represent the fault lines of the Jewish mother-son relationship.”31 On the other hand, May’s detractors ignore how she subverts the treatment of Jewish men, women, and values in contemporaneous movies like Goodbye, Columbus (1969).32 To be sure, Lila may be passive and not classically attractive or poised, but she remains a decent person who cannot fathom why Lenny would dump her. She evinces none of the cunning, entitlement, flirtatiousness, and materialism that became the hallmarks of the Jewish American princess stereotype exemplified by Brenda Patimkin.33 Compared to Lenny, Lila is a saint. Ethan Warren has opined that “by allowing Lila to stay grounded as a recognizable and sympathetic presence who’s just slightly tough to take, May makes Lenny’s own awfulness so transparent that he has no choice but to recognize it himself, an effect that paradoxically humanizes him even while heightening his cruelty.”34\n\nThe scene where Lenny tells Lila he wants a divorce demonstrates how detestable he is. Clem Bastow describes it succinctly: “Unable to cope with her response, Lenny forces her to drink water, chastising her for making a fuss (oblivious to the fact that every woman in the restaurant has been critiquing him with her gaze all night), even as she begs him to help her to the ladies’ room so she can throw up.”35 The pathos Jeannie Berlin’s performance evoked earned her an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. Even Quart concedes that The Heartbreak Kid can be seen as “a scathing portrait of those late 1950s/1960s ethnic young men on the make, who dominated the literary scene in those years.”36\n\nMay’s next film, Mikey and Nicky (1976), dealt with a man betraying his best friend.37 Mikey, played by Peter Falk, was a childhood buddy of Nicky, played by John Cassavetes. Both work for a Jewish mob boss named Resnick, who has put a contract out on Nicky’s head for embezzling some of his gang’s money. Terrified to leave his hotel room, Nicky summons his old pal to help him evade the assassination. What he doesn’t know but begins to suspect is that Mikey has been assigned by Resnick to report on Nicky’s whereabouts so the gang’s hit man can kill him. While Mikey is purportedly shepherding Nicky to safety, the two share childhood memories and festering resentments that culminate in the argument that leads Mikey to stop tailing Nicky. As the assassin closes in, a desperate Nicky seeks sanctuary at Mikey’s house, but Mikey barricades the door to his house allowing the gunman to kill Nicky.\n\nRichard Brody of the New Yorker praised Mikey and Nicky as a “welcome correction to The Godfather” and May for presenting a “feminist angle on the gangster film.”38 Rather than idealize the personal solidarity within a crime syndicate, she exposes the internecine battles that turn Mikey against Nicky and the repressed grievances between the two that facilitate Mikey’s transformation from Nicky’s best friend to an accomplice in his murder. The deceptions that sever their bond seep into their relationships with women. Nicky’s wife has separated from him and kept custody of their daughter because he has cheated on her. He is physically and verbally abusive of his mistress, whose sexual services he offers to his colleagues. She resists Mikey’s advances, which provokes him to attack her. Critic Nathan Rabin sums up the gender relationships in the film accordingly: “If you’re a woman in this milieu, you are hated and abused for putting out too easily but punished for not putting out at all.”39 Mikey lives a staid suburban life by concealing his underworld ties from his wife, but the shooting of Nicky outside their home is bound to end that charade. Peter Sobczynski perceptively describes the film as “a dark and penetrating drama about friendship, loyalty, self-preservation, and the kind of empty machismo that would one day be referred to as ‘toxic masculinity.’”40\n\nThe Jewish component of Mikey and Nicky merits some attention as well. Despite the tendency in American movies to portray Jewish men as more intellectual, moral, and sensitive than Gentile men, there is no shortage of feature films about Jewish gangsters, like Murder Inc. (1960), which incidentally cast Peter Falk in his breakout role, and Lepke (1975).41 In Resnick’s gang, Jews are the insiders and Nicky the Italian is an outsider. What distinguishes May’s take on this genre is a remarkable scene in which Nicky brings Mikey to a cemetery to visit the grave of Nicky’s mother. Nicky is not religious and does not know what to say when he finds it. Although Mikey is a nonbeliever too, he respectfully avoids stepping on gravesites and recites the Kaddish [Jewish mourning prayer] to honor the memory of Nicky’s mom.42\n\nThe production of Mikey and Nicky was fraught with conflicts between May and Paramount Pictures over May’s exceeding the budget, shooting too much footage, protracted editing of it, and legal battles to prevent the release of the studio’s final cut that diverged significantly from the version she envisaged. Paramount prevailed and limited the markets where the film was released. Mikey and Nicky received mixed reviews. Two years later former Paramount producer Julian Schlossberg purchased the rights to it, restored May’s final version, and rereleased the film to theatres in 1985, when it garnered critical acclaim.43\n\nMay’s clashes with Paramount over A New Leaf and Mikey and Nicky damaged her prospects for directing again. Todd McCarthy, her assistant on the latter film, speculates that she “set back the cause of women directors in Hollywood by ten years.”44 Maya Montañez Smukler counters his claim by opining that Hollywood executives already harbored sexist reservations about hiring women directors before and after May.45 For the next ten years May enjoyed success as a screenwriter and script doctor, earning an Oscar nomination for best screenplay for Warren Beatty’s Heaven Can Wait (1978). Though uncredited, she revised the scripts for Beatty’s Reds (1981) and Dustin Hoffman’s hit Tootsie (1982). Beatty’s appreciation of her contributions to his films prompted him to sign her as the director for Ishtar (1987), which starred Hoffman and him.46 Even before Ishtar’s release, negative stories about its runaway budget, May’s overweening perfectionism, and the film becoming a vanity project for its two leads soured audiences and critics on it. Reviewers savaged it and reduced it to one of Hollywood’s most legendary flops, losing nearly $40,000,000. Elaine May has not directed a film since Ishtar, in contrast to several male directors who have gone on to make other movies despite the colossal financial losses incurred by one of their previous pictures.47\n\nElaine May intended Ishtar to be a parody of the old Crosby and Hope road movies and a satire about American foreign policy in the Middle East. Echoes of her prior treatment of male characters and inclusion of Jewish moments reoccur in it too. Beatty as Lyle and Hoffman as Clarke play a singer-songwriter duo oblivious to their lack of talent. A Jewish agent books them to perform in a backwater lounge in the fictional Arab country of Ishtar. Clarke’s Jewishness is on display when he repeatedly corrects Lyle’s pronunciation of the Yiddish word “schmuck” and when a rabbi is summoned to dissuade him from committing suicide. The CIA and an alluring female revolutionary recruit each man as a spy on opposite sides of a local civil war. This temporarily reintroduces the theme of betrayal since each man suspects the other of working for the enemy of their respective ally. By the end Clarke and Lyle renew their friendship, and the CIA negotiates a peace deal between the rebels and the Emir to avoid its covert operation in the country from being exposed. The pact includes a provision for producing an album by the hapless pair. As the bad publicity Ishtar received has receded into the past, critics have reevaluated the censure initially heaped upon it.48\n\nFollowing the debacle of Ishtar, May returned to acting and screenwriting with much success. She authored the scripts for The Birdcage (1996) and Primary Colors (1998), with both earning nominations for best adapted screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. Her performance in Small Time Crooks (2000) won the National Society of Film Critics’ award for best supporting actress. At the age of eighty-seven she recently won the Tony award for best leading actress in a Broadway drama for her role in The Waverly Gallery.49 Soon thereafter, it was announced that she had been signed to direct a new movie starring Dakota Johnson.50\n\nAlly Acker ascribes May’s focus on the foibles of male characters rather to the dominant masculine culture in which she was raised a generation before second-wave feminism.51 Alexandra Heller-Nicholas warns against defining feminism too narrowly when judging May, whose “professional practice as a director at least was strongly governed by a strength of will to act against what was expected of her as a woman.” She cites how May “critiques institutions such as marriage (A New Leaf, The Heartbreak Kid) and undermines for both comic (Ishtar) and tragic effects (Mikey and Nicky) clichés surrounding male friendship.”52 May became only the third woman director after Arzner and Lupino to be inducted into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.53\n\nWhile May did not stress the Jewish aspects of her characters, neither does she efface them to appeal to general audiences. Eric Goldstein maintains that “Jewishness has often provided the material for her comedy, as well as being a source for some of the identity conflicts of her characters.”54 By making most of her protagonists identifiably Jewish, she, along with the string of roles Streisand played in the 1960s and 1970s, set a precedent for Micklin Silver and Weill, who would place more emphasis on the Jewishness of the leads in their movies.\n\nJOAN MICKLIN SILVER\n\nJoan Micklin Silver’s and Claudia Weill’s routes to directing Hollywood movies parallel each other. Both started by directing educational television programs and documentaries in New York. They independently financed their first feature films. Those films generated positive publicity at European and American film festivals, eventually landing their directors studio contracts at a propitious time when American studios had started to cater to the changing tastes of female audiences by producing a cycle of popular films directed by men about strong women characters, like Martin Scorsese’s Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974), Fred Zinnemann’s Julia (1977), Herbert Ross’s The Turning Point (1977), and Paul Mazurksy’s An Unmarried Woman (1978). As had happened with May, male producers substantially reedited the first studio films made by Micklin Silver and Weill, expressing distrust in their box office viability.55 Though Micklin Silver continued to shoot studio films into the 1990s, both she and Weill gravitated toward directing episodes of TV series and movies for television and premium cable networks.\n\nBorn in 1936 and raised in Omaha, Micklin Silver married Raphael Silver and moved to his hometown of Cleveland in 1956, where she wrote plays for local theatre groups. In 1967 the couple moved to New York, where she scripted and directed educational films, including The Immigrant Experience: The Long Long Journey (1972), a dramatization of a story about a Polish immigrant boy and his family in the United States at the turn of the century. Since she was descended from Russian Jews and her father, grandparents, and other relatives regularly reminisced about their lives in the Old Country and about becoming Americanized, she requested to change the ethnicity of the characters to Jewish, but this was denied because the director felt that Jews were too “atypical.” Around the same time, Universal Pictures optioned the rights to her screenplay Limbo (1972), based on interviews she had conducted with wives of American POWs and MIAs in the Vietnam War for a series published in McCall’s magazine.56 The film’s director, Mark Robson, dropped her from the production when she questioned alterations he had made in the shooting script to soften the assertiveness of its lead character. Nevertheless, he allowed her to observe the making of Limbo, which she regarded as a filmmaking education.57\n\nTo pay homage to the immigrant heritage of her parents, she shopped the idea of adapting Abraham Cahan’s Yekl: A Tale of the New York Ghetto for the screen. She recalls one producer frankly telling her that “feature films are expensive to make and expensive to market and women directors are one more problem we don’t need.” One person whose support she solicited cautioned her that the audience for the film would be limited because Jews were only “two percent of the population,” which seems like a weak argument except for Micklin Silver’s choice of keeping much of the dialogue in Yiddish. Angry over his wife being denied the chance to direct, her husband, Raphael, responded by forming the production company Midwest Films and raising $350,000 to fund Hester Street (1975).58 Once the film was made, it couldn’t find a distributor and faced the prospect of being screened only in synagogues. After it was shown at Cannes and other European film festivals, it opened in the United States at a theatre in New York that Raphael rented. Word of mouth enabled it to receive more bookings. Wherever it played, it received glowing reviews. Yet it did not secure broader distribution until Carol Kane was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for her role as Gitl. Hester Street eventually grossed $5,000,000 in ticket revenues and won Micklin Silver a nomination for best comedy screenplay from the Writers Guild of America.59 Released at the height of the ethnic roots and feminist movements, it was, as Hasia Diner has remarked, “the right film at the right time.”60\n\nCahan’s story focused primarily on the unbridled Americanization of Jake, a Russian Jewish immigrant, and how it drives him to divorce his embarrassingly “greenhorn” wife, Gitl, in favor of Mamie, a more assimilated immigrant woman whom he had been courting before Gitl and his son joined him in New York.61 Micklin Silver shifted the emphasis to Gitl’s “amazing journey in terms of where she started, how she came over, and what happened to her from there.”62 From the moment Gitl and their son, Yossele, arrive at Ellis Island, Jake forces them to Americanize by cutting Yossele’s peyess [sidelocks], renaming him Joey, and teaching him how to play baseball. He berates Gitl for wearing plain long dresses and a sheitel or babushka to cover her hair and for speaking Yiddish. Jake’s landlady, Mrs. Kavarsky, mentors Gitl on how to look like an “American lady” by discarding her sheitel and modest clothes for more fashionable garments and hairdo. When Jake glimpses Gitl’s new appearance, he assumes she has purchased a stylish wig and tries to rip it off her head. In the course of their ensuing argument, Gitl blurts out that she knows about Mamie, whom she calls a “Polish whore.” Mrs. Kavarsky attempts to reconcile the couple, but Jake stalks out of the room. Kavarsky assures Gitl, “Don’t worry, this one will come back,” but Gitl replies, “I don’t want him back. Genug—enough!”\n\nMicklin Silver endows Gitl with more agency than she possesses in Cahan’s story. Deeply wounded by Jake’s infidelity, Cahan’s Gitl possessively holds onto Joey to ensure he will remain with her but never announces her decision to leave Jake. Instead, Jake raises the prospect of divorce and tries to purchase Gitl’s acquiescence with money from Mamie’s savings. The movie fabricates a scene with Mamie’s lawyer trying to bribe Gitl to grant Jake a divorce. Gitl remains taciturn as he incrementally raises the offer to the point where it depletes Mamie’s entire nest egg. Although both versions monitor Gitl’s growing fondness for the kindly and pious Bernstein, who teaches Joey Hebrew, the film reverses the gender roles by having Gitl propose to him. Micklin Silver’s reenactment of the Jewish ritual where the wife accepts the gett [writ of divorce] from the husband exposes the unequal treatment of divorced women, who have to wait ninety-one days to remarry, whereas divorced men can remarry immediately. In the closing scene, a confident and stylishly dressed Gitl, who now insists her son be called Joey, strolls with Bernstein, discussing the store they plan to buy. At the end of Yekl, Cahan’s Gitl still feels grief-stricken over the dissolution of her marriage.63 Gitl is a Jewish heroine who resists the wholesale assimilation embodied by Jake for an acculturation that preserves her faith as she adopts the external trappings of looking and speaking like an American. Micklin Silver’s empowerment of Gitl undermines Lester Friedman’s judgment that Gitl “fails to accomplish anything” beyond replicating “the shtetl [predominantly Jewish village in Russia] tradition of supporting the scholar.”64\n\nThe success of Hester Street brought Micklin Silver to the attention of Hollywood studios. She met with one studio executive and pitched Fred Barron’s script for Between the Lines.65 It revolved around the personal and professional relations among the staff members of a Boston countercultural newspaper called the Back Bay Mainline that had enjoyed popularity at the beginning of the 1970s but faced declining revenues as the idealistic radicalism of that decade waned. To save it from financial ruin, a corporate media company purchases it with the aim of making it more commercially viable. When no studio offered to produce the screenplay, Raphael Silver’s Midwest Films entered the breach and marshalled the profits from Hester Street to fund it.66 Since theatres were trying to book big budget blockbusters in the post-Jaws (1975) era, the distribution prospects for an indie film like Between the Lines were limited. Micklin Silver’s direction, the casting of a talented ensemble of up-and-coming actors like John Heard, Lindsey Crouse, Jeff Goldblum, Jill Eikenberry, and Bruno Kirby, and witty dialogue picked up awards from the Berlin Film Festival and the Los Angeles Critics Association.67\n\nAs an ensemble piece with a spectrum of characters, Between the Lines was not designed to highlight feminist or Jewish issues. Yet strands of both are easily detectable in it. Micklin Silver pairs the women characters with men on the staff with varying outcomes. Photographer Abbie, played by Lindsey Crouse, has an on-off relationship with Harry, played by John Heard. She retains her enthusiasm for the newspaper’s muckraking mission, whereas Harry has lost faith in the transformative impact of his investigative reporting. When they jointly interview a stripper, Abbie establishes greater rapport with her, angering Harry because he resents Abbie encroaching on his domain. Abbie surpasses him in eliciting thoughtful answers from the stripper as well as getting striking pictures of her. Laura, played by Gwen Welles, lives with Michael, played by Stephen Collins. She still writes for the paper while he is working on a novel. When he lands a contract for his book, he selfishly assumes she will quit her job and join him in New York. Though she prevaricates, she eventually yields to his demands. Finally, the receptionist, Lynn, played by Jill Eikenberry, resists the sexual harassment of the paper’s officious advertising director and exhibits courage and integrity when she becomes the first staff member to quit rather than work under the new corporate regime that has taken over.68 Quart lauds Micklin Silver as a “feminist director” who excels at observing the gender dynamics in such male-female encounters without becoming polemical.69\n\nJeff Goldblum’s character, Max Arloft, the Back Bay Mainline’s rock critic, spices up the film with a Jewish flavor. His brashness, swarthy appearance, and wisecracking code him as a Jew, but Micklin Silver supplies him some dialogue that is explicitly Jewish. Asking his boss for a raise, he grounds his request in his need to help his parents afford to visit him on the major Jewish holidays. He contends this is particularly important for Pesach because it would sadden him to be alone when looking for the afikoman [a piece of matzah hidden during the Seder that children hunt for to win a prize]. In a subsequent scene, Max delivers a pretentious lecture to a class of college coeds about the parallels between the Beatles’ song “Blackbird” and Wallace Stevens’s poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.” To impress them and possibly attract a groupie, he mentions the Latin root of the word “act.” As he elaborates on its Latin origins, he gratuitously throws in several Yiddish terms. Micklin Silver’s inclusion of such distinctly Jewish material belongs to a trend Nathan Abrams discerns in contemporary Jewish films of inserting in-jokes that only Jewish audiences would understand in films that otherwise do not expressly target them.70\n\nMicklin Silver’s first experience directing a Hollywood film underlines the problems the first cohort of modern women directors confronted when dealing with studios more invested in the marketability of their films rather than their cinematic quality. Signed by 20th Century Fox to make two movies, she planned to obtain the rights to adapt Ann Beattie’s novel Chilly Scenes of Winter for the screen but discovered that Triple Play Productions, an independent company founded by three actors, already had acquired the property for a minimal cost after the major studios balked at producing it. Micklin Silver convinced a sympathetic Fox executive to let her direct and write the film with Triple Play producing it. After Fox dropped the project, the executive moved to United Artists to be a vice president and revived the endeavor. The story concerns a single man, Charles, obsessed with Laura, a married woman separated from her husband. When she returns to him, Charles doggedly stalks her. In the novel and original version of the film, Charles and Laura reunite in the end. In today’s parlance the film would be called a dramedy interspersing funny banter with the disturbing compulsiveness of Charles’s love. Worried about the foreboding implications the title Chilly Scenes of Winter conveyed, United Artists changed it to Head over Heels (1979), much to Micklin Silver’s chagrin. Beattie quipped that the new title “sounded as if Fred Astaire should be dancing across the credits.”71\n\nHead over Heels received mixed reviews and did poorly at the box office. Yet the film developed a cult following due to its humorous dialogue, quirky premise, and stellar performances by John Heard as Charles and Mary Beth Hurt as Laura. United Artists Classics, a new studio division founded in 1980 to reissue its quality films, expressed interest in rereleasing the movie as Chilly Scenes of Winter if it were reedited with a less upbeat conclusion consistent with its overall melancholic tone. Micklin Silver eliminated the closing scene where Laura shows up in Charles’s kitchen after he had accepted the finality of their breakup. This lent the film a narrative coherence the first version lacked and elevated it into a critical and commercial hit.72\n\nDuring the 1980s, Micklin Silver directed the children’s story How to Be a Wonderful Person in Just Three Days (1983) for the PBS series Wonderworks and Finnegan Begin Again (1985) for HBO.73 Although directing for television relieved her of the responsibilities of casting, pitching movie scripts to studios, and raising funding, she returned to the world of studio feature films in 1988 when she made Crossing Delancey,74 based on an off-Broadway play by Susan Sandler, who wrote the screenplay as well. Micklin Silver and her husband tried in vain to convince a Hollywood studio to produce it. What turned the tide was casting Amy Irving for the role of Izzy. She was married to Steven Spielberg, who liked the script and provided an entrée to Warner Brothers, which negotiated a negative pickup contract with Midwest Films. This stipulated that the studio financed the film but left its production in the hands of Midwest Films. When Warner Brothers screened Crossing Delancey, it requested many changes that Micklin Silver was not obligated to do, since her contract granted her rights over the final cut. She refused, and the positive responses by preview audiences vindicated her judgment.75\n\nCrossing Delancey has been called the “ultimate Jewish rom-com.”76 When a love story involves Jewish characters in Hollywood films, their paramours are usually Gentiles because the star-crossed plotline engenders comical incongruities or tragic conflicts.77 Crossing Delancey achieves the same effect by matching Izzy, a secularized modern Jewish woman who works in a trendy bookstore on New York’s Upper West Side, with Sam, a Jewish man played by Peter Riegert, a traditionalist who has remained on the city’s Lower East Side to run his father’s pickle business. Izzy is enthralled by the famous author Anton, played by Jeroen Krabbé, after he reads from his novel at the bookstore where she works. Bubbie, Izzie’s grandmother, endearingly performed by Yiddish theatre veteran Reizl Bozyk, worries that Izzy will not find a nice Jewish man to marry. Consequently, she hires a matchmaker who, in turn, arranges for Izzy to meet Sam. Izzy resents this meddling and assumes there can be no chemistry between her and someone like Sam, but Sam proves to be more intriguing than she expected. He’s handsome and modern even though he, as Stephen Silver puts it, “owns a strong and customized Jewish identity.”78 Drawn by the allure of Anton’s celebrity, Izzy quickly learns that he is really looking for a mistress and secretary. Despite repeated efforts to discourage Sam’s interest in her, it finally dawns on Izzy that he possesses endearing qualities that merit her romantic attention.\n\nMicklin Silver exudes an affectionate Jewish sensibility in Crossing Delancey. Whether evoking the ambiance of the Lower East Side, having Sam mention that he said “a special bracha” [blessing] before he gave Izzy a new hat, depicting Izzy’s attendance at the bris of a baby boy born to one of her girlfriends, or peppering the dialogue of Bubbie and the matchmaker with Yiddish words and phrases, she instills the movie with almost as much Jewish content as appeared in Hester Street. In a way Crossing Delancey could be interpreted as a sequel to Hester Street, with Bubbie as an elderly Gitl striving to maintain Jewish continuity by preventing the intermarriage of her granddaughter. Izzy’s escape from the old Jewish neighborhood resembles Jake’s distancing himself from his immigrant roots. Sam’s attachment to Judaism parallels that of Mr. Bernstein, the boarder in Hester Street whose kindness and piety gradually render him in Gitl’s eyes a desirable spouse to replace Jake.\n\nMicklin Silver has demonstrated a commitment to portray her Jewish heritage in film and other media throughout her career. She directed the thirteen-part anthology Great Jewish Stories from Eastern Europe and Beyond (1995) for National Public Radio, Showtime’s remake of Rod Serling’s In the Presence of Mine Enemies (1997) about a rabbi in the Warsaw Ghetto, and her last independent feature film, A Fish in the Bathtub (1998), about a bickering Jewish couple.79 Marlene Booth rightfully credits Micklin Silver with “showing not only that women can direct films but that films about Jewish topics can succeed with Jews and non-Jews alike.”80 In 1995 the National Foundation for Jewish Culture bestowed its Jewish Cultural Achievement Award in the media arts on her.81\n\nMicklin Silver has been equally prolific in depicting issues relevant to women. Along with Julianne Boyd she cowrote A … My Name Is Alice (1983), a feminist musical review that became an off-Broadway hit.82 While she exercised less creative control over the cable television movies she directed than over her feature films, she has repeatedly selected projects highlighting feminist concerns like HBO’s A Private Matter (1992) about a pre–Roe v. Wade abortion case, Showtime’s Charms for the Easy Life (2002) about the assertiveness of three generations of North Carolina women, and Lifetime’s Hunger Point (2003) about an adolescent girl suffering from anorexia.83 Montañez Smukler credits her with being the only woman director “able to build a body of work during the 1970s and then into the 1980s that was hers without any studio or producer interference” except for the interference with Chilly Scenes of Winter that ultimately was rectified.84\n\nCLAUDIA WEILL\n\nBorn in 1946, Claudia Weill is the only baby boomer among the trio of women directors who combined feminist and Jewish themes in their films. In 1967 she spent a summer interning on the production of a documentary about the counterculture of Haight-Ashbury, which piqued her interest in filmmaking. Like Micklin Silver, she began her vocation in educational television, directing episodes of Sesame Street and WNET’s The 51st State, which covered stories about current events in New York. Along with pioneering Jewish woman director Joyce Chopra and two other filmmakers, she cofounded a feminist filmmaking collective in 1971. Weill cowrote and served as a cinematographer for Chopra’s Joyce at 34 (1972) about the impact pregnancy was having on her career as a documentarian.85 This brought Weill to the attention of Shirley MacLaine, who employed her as a cinematographer and codirector of the Oscar-nominated documentary The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir (1975) about the status of women in the communist country.86\n\nCodirecting and filming other people’s documentaries nurtured a desire in Weill to direct a feature film. It took nearly three years to complete her first film, from conceiving its plotline, hiring a screenwriter, applying for grants, and soliciting donations to augment her own investment in it. She shot Girlfriends (1978) in fits and starts as she accumulated sufficient money to do so.87 She submitted it to the Rotterdam and Cannes Film Festivals, where it was warmly received. Returning to New York, she couldn’t find a distributor so she traveled to Los Angeles to procure one. Warner Brothers embraced the film to capitalize on the buzz Girlfriends generated abroad and the recent success of the wave of women’s films directed by men.88 This paid off, as its box office take exceeded its modest budget. The National Board of Review ranked Girlfriends as one of the top ten films of 1978, and the Academy of Italian Cinema conferred its Donatello award on Weill for the best directing debut of the year.89\n\nThe story revolves around Susan Weinblatt, played by Melanie Mayron. Devastated when her best friend and roommate, Anne, played by Anita Skinner, announces that she is moving out to get married, Susan must cope with being alone and struggling to carve a niche for herself as a photographer in the city’s competitive art scene. In the meantime, she ekes out a living photographing bar mitzvahs and Jewish weddings for a synagogue. Film scholar Marsha Kinder describes Susan “as an intense Jewish girl with a great sense of humor, who can look homely and dumpy one minute and beautiful and voluptuous the next, but whose intelligence, talent and spirit are never in question.”90 Erens counts Susan among the Jewish “ugly ducklings” who appeared in several movies from the 1970s and served as the antithesis of the Jewish American princess. As Kinder indicates, Susan’s charm and demeanor transform her into a swan during the course of the film.91 Weill recalls that she grew up watching movies and television programs with gorgeous female leads whose sidekicks were “a little more ethnic, maybe Jewish, usually a little more overweight or underweight, and not as conventionally pretty” and who possessed great personalities and wit. She admits, “I guess I wanted that person to be the protagonist.”92\n\nSusan epitomizes some feminists who deferred getting married to pursue their careers. She feels abandoned when Anne becomes betrothed and worries that she is sacrificing her literary ambitions to become a wife and subsequently a mother. Conversely, Anne envies Susan’s independence and undergoes an abortion out of concern that having a second baby will leave her with no free time to write. Their friendship survives. Contending with loneliness and professional rejection, Susan invites a young homeless woman, Ceil, to temporarily reside with her but gently spurns her sexual overtures in a tender scene that some feminist critics misconstrued as homophobic. Susan eventually strikes up a relationship with an understanding boyfriend named Eric, played by Christopher Guest, but refuses to relinquish her autonomy when he suggests she move out of her apartment and into his to save money.93\n\nThe film’s Jewish moments consist of scenes where Susan is photographing synagogue events and conversing afterward with Rabbi Gold, played by the veteran actor Eli Wallach, whom Weill cold-called to offer him the part. Following a bar mitzvah reception, Susan confides in him how she once eavesdropped on her grandfather while he was wearing his tefillin and fervently davening. Sensing that he was communing with God, she entered the room, and he brusquely shouted at her to get out. Yearning to dialogue with God like her grandfather, as a girl Susan had entertained the ambition of becoming a rabbi. Gold believes she would have been a great rabbi. Susan rehearses that possibility by donning his clerical robe. A palpable mutual attraction blossoms during this exchange, with Gold kissing Susan goodnight and asking her out on a date. Their relationship ends a few days later when Susan learns that Gold is married. Although Sally Priesand became the first American woman rabbi in 1972, Girlfriends features the first time in an American feature film where the idea that a woman could be a rabbi was broached, five years before Barbra Streisand’s Yentl (1983).94\n\nGirlfriends, however, is primarily remembered as a landmark feminist film. Victoria Myers recently commented, “Girlfriends was a precursor to the female friendship narratives of the ’90s. At the time of its release, it not only put a female story front and center, but also touched on normalizing abortion and had an overtly Jewish female protagonist (a taboo which had only been broken by Barbra Streisand a decade prior).”95 Katie Goh credits Girlfriends with establishing the template for movies like Frances Ha (2012) and television series like Sex and the City (1998–2004) and Girls (2012–2017), featuring circles of single women pursuing careers and love in New York. Goh detects many parallels between Frances Ha and Girlfriends.96 Greta Gerwig, the star of Frances Ha and a successful director herself, recollects, “When I saw Girlfriends it felt like the film had been made just for me.”97 Lena Dunham, creator of Girls, similarly felt that Girlfriends anticipated her program: “From the first shot, I was transfixed. By the complex relationships, the subtlety, the odd comedy that was awkward long before awkward was cool. I almost thought, ‘Have I seen this and been gently ripping it off for the last five years?’”98 Dunham acknowledged her debt to Weill by choosing her to direct an episode of Girls in 2013.99\n\nThe recurring theme of women balancing their professions with their private lives informs Weill’s first studio venture, It’s My Turn (1980).100 The casting of Jill Clayburgh as Kate Gunzinger signified that the character was a modern woman since Clayburgh was associated with such roles from her two previous films, An Unmarried Woman and Starting Over (1979).101 On the one hand, Kate relishes her teaching and research as a University of Chicago mathematics professor whom Columbia University is considering for an administrative position. On the other, she settles for a comfortable, albeit unsatisfying, relationship with Homer, played by Charles Grodin. He makes her laugh while eschewing any deeper commitment. Kate travels to New York to interview at Columbia and attend her father’s second wedding. There she meets his new son-in-law, Ben Lewin, a baseball player who retired early due to an injury. Hewing to the “opposites attract” formula, the ostensible mismatch between the clumsy scholar and the coordinated athlete, played by Michael Douglas, evolves into a romantic coupling. Captivated by the intimacy she achieves with Ben, Kate decides to take the job at Columbia even though it will derail her career as a mathematician. For the sake of his daughter, Ben is not ready to leave his unhappy marriage. He counsels Kate to predicate her choice between administration and teaching on which she enjoys more rather than on whether it would allow her to reside in the same city as him. Kate decides to stay at the University of Chicago, assuring her best student that she will be there awhile, and breaks up with Homer, revealing that she yearns for someone more emotionally available to her. In the closing scene she receives a gift of a signed baseball from Ben, indicating their relationship is not over.\n\nWeill tackled the proverbial topic of career versus love because “she wanted to get into something that I think is happening to a lot of people, and that’s that they’re making significant progress in terms of their work, but they’re finding themselves emotionally impoverished.”102 In an interview conducted by Roger Ebert she admitted, “As far as the women’s movement goes, the new film may actually be reactionary. Here’s a woman who has too much ‘space,’ too much freedom. She finds that she wants a messy relationship.”103 Some critics, however, chided Clayburgh’s performance for rendering Kate so genial and unassertive that she hardly seemed like an independent woman, let alone a feminist.104\n\nAlthough Jewishness does not loom as large in It’s My Turn as it does in Girlfriends, the protagonists and the occasion that brings their families together leave no doubt that this is a movie about Jews. Both the Gunzingers and the Lewins are Jewish. Though brief, the marriage ceremony shows men wearing yarmulkes and concludes with the ritual breaking of a glass by the groom. A rabbi naturally officiates it. Weill avoids the stereotypical caricatures films often rely on when portraying Jewish men or women in her depictions of Kate and Ben. Kate may be a bit uncoordinated, but she is positively graceful compared to Lila in The Heartbreak Kid. Her intelligence and occupation differentiate her from the domineering Jewish mothers and materialistic Jewish princesses appearing in many films of this era.105 Ben’s sporting career contrasts with his brother, who is a psychiatrist. Neither Ben nor Kate possesses the curly hair, dark complexion, or crooked nose that often mark characters as Jews in Hollywood movies.106\n\nAs was the case with May’s and Micklin Silver’s first studio releases, the producer for It’s My Turn, Ray Stark, allegedly sabotaged the original vision of the story. Frustrated over disagreements he had with Weill, he may have been the source of reports leaked to the press about how Clayburgh and Douglas took advantage of her inexperience. Another rumor circulated that Douglas was so upset with how Weill had botched the film that he didn’t want to be involved in publicizing it. Douglas denied that he was unhappy with the film. According to Douglas’s biographer, John Parker, Stark reedited Weill’s cut of the film but ran into opposition from other Columbia executives, who preferred her version. Weill diplomatically admitted that there had been creative disagreements between Stark and her but added that this was to be expected as part of the collaborative process of filmmaking. Grodin believed Weill had been mistreated by Stark because she was a woman. Weill subsequently divulged that she had been subjected to sexual harassment by Stark: “Stark would come on set and literally run his hand down my back to see if was wearing a bra or not. That was acceptable at that time. The notion of a woman director was really alien.” Montañez Smukler surmises that Stark may have allocated fewer studio resources to promote It’s My Turn as retribution, contributing to its commercial failure.107\n\nWeill left Hollywood at the beginning of the 1980s to direct plays in New York and then returned to direct television movies and program episodes. According to her, she shifted to television because “it was much easier, also just to go to work. By then, I had gotten married and had two small boys, so I was much less interested in having an albatross around my neck for several years.”108 The transition to directing for television could be perceived as a demotion, since in this period the made-for-TV movie was deemed “the bastard stepchild of its silver screen counterparts.”109 Weill’s involvement in television predated the rise of its “platinum age,” when cable premium and streaming channels have produced outstanding films and shows, upping the game for network fare.110 Weill directed multiple episodes of acclaimed programs like thirtysomething (1987–1991) and Once and Again (1999–2001).111 The former often highlighted conflicts arising from the Jewish-Christian intermarriage of its main characters.112 Weill’s television movies addressed women’s issues, like a widowed wife learning she is destitute due to her husband’s gambling habit in CBS’s The Face of a Stranger (1991) and the legislative erosion of abortion rights in Showtime’s Critical Choices (1996).113\n\nDespite her relatively brief stint making studio feature films, Claudia Weill’s contribution to cinematic history has not gone unnoticed. She became the fourth woman director to be admitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2019 the Library of Congress’s National Film Preservation Board named Girlfriends to its National Film Registry, along with May’s A New Leaf. Hester Street received that honor in 2011.114 Film doyen Stanley Kubrick applauded Girlfriends as one of the few American productions he would “compare to the serious, intelligent, sensitive writing, and filmmaking that you find in the best directors in Europe.”115\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAfter a nearly total absence of women directors from Hollywood movies and the decline of the studio system in the 1960s, studio receptivity to more innovative filmmaking converged with government pressure to eliminate gender discrimination in employment and the rise of the feminist and ethnic identities movements. This fortuitous combination of factors acted as a catalyst for the hiring of more women directors by the major studios in the 1970s. Jewish women were overrepresented in that first cohort of women directors.\n\nAmong their ranks, Elaine May, Joan Micklin Silver, and Claudia Weill interjected Jewish characters, rituals, or settings in tandem with feminist themes into their films. Scholarship about women directors has recognized their contributions to the emergence of feminist cinema but has devoted less attention to the Jewish dimension of their films. Scholarship about Jewish cinema has not always acknowledged May and Weill for the Jewish aspects of their films.\n\nThis neglect may partly stem from how their careers making theatrical releases were abbreviated and channeled into screenwriting in May’s case and directing in television in Weill’s. The specter of sexism lurks in the background as a possible cause for their shortened stints as studio directors. It is difficult to ascertain how much of a role it played in May’s squabbles with producers and the demise of her directing career after Ishtar or from the highly publicized acrimony surrounding the production and distribution of Weill’s It’s My Turn. Statistics indicate that women directors are afforded fewer opportunities by studios to make additional motion pictures if they develop a reputation for being “headstrong” or make a film that fails financially.116 When accessing their studio careers, it is worth recalling how Barbra Streisand once characterized the differential standards applied to male and female directors:\n\nA man is commanding—a woman is demanding. A man is forceful—a woman is pushy. A man is uncompromising—a woman is a ballbreaker. A man is a perfectionist—a woman’s a pain in the ass. He’s assertive—she’s aggressive. He strategizes—she manipulates.\n\nHe shows leadership—she’s controlling. He’s committed—she’s obsessed. He’s persevering—she’s relentless. He sticks to his guns—she’s stubborn. If a man wants to get it right, he’s looked up to and respected. If a woman wants to get it right, she’s difficult and impossible.117"
