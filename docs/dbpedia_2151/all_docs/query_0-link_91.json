        "text": "En route to Daytona, a gang of bikers roar into Nowheresville in the late 1950s and they’re not made welcome by the bulk of the locals. To be fair, they don’t go out their way to endear themselves to them. They don’t even make any real attempts to endear themselves to each other.\n\nA fatalistic young man of few words and even fewer scruples, Vance fully expects he’ll be’ going to Hell in a breadbasket.’ Played by Willem Dafoe in his first major role, Vance appears to be the gang leader and Davis (Robert Gordon) his right-hand man.\n\nWith a rockabilly revival underway, vocalist Gordon, was making waves around this time and his 1981 album Are You Gonna Be The One sold over 200,000 copies. Initially, he was employed to help with the soundtrack but his 1950s image and charisma persuaded co-directors Kathryn Bigelow and Monty Montgomery to offer him a central role. Dafoe convinces too as a biker, sculpting his hair into a ‘duck’s arse’ with dollops of grease and looking no stranger to a saddle, despite having never ridden a motorbike prior to being cast. Not that he mentioned this at his audition.\n\nThe gang hit a truck stop diner and hang about a nearby garage fixing a bike fault. They gab away in some hepcat argo that any squares watching will find difficult to decipher. They smoke endlessly, drink bottles of Coke (and Dixie beer and Thunderbird wine) and strive to be cool (rather than just being cool). There’s no shortage of tough guy posturing with some tough gal posturing too via Davis’s girlfriend Sportster Debbie (played by Tina L’Hotsky – and yeah, that’s just about the name on her birth certificate).\n\nDavis brings out a flick knife and pathetically plunges it into the fabric of their booth seat, gouging away. In the garage, a trio of them stand around each other and take turns throwing a knife at the floor between their feet.\n\nAs action goes, that’s about as exciting as things get in the first half of the film, though it never veers into a bore. The script could be described as minimalist and Bigelow’s background was originally in art, one early mentor being Richard Senna, a big-name minimalist sculptor who specialized in huge abstract pieces (which I have at best a very minimal interest in). Bet she loved Edward Hopper as well, though. Everything in The Loveless looks fantastic. I mean, I want a coffee from that diner and a Coca Cola from the bright red vending machine in the garage and I want to ride one of those bikes down an endless blacktop like Vance.\n\nOr at least I think I do momentarily, although I haven’t been on a motorbike since Compulsory Basic Training was introduced in Britain decades ago and would likely find riding at any kind of speed a little scary nowadays.\n\nA waitress is drawn to bad boy Vance, but he’s more keen on a younger female who drives a red Corvette convertible into the forecourt of the garage for petrol. This is Telena (Marin Kanter), the daughter of crooked local businessman Tarver (J. Don Ferguson), a full-blown maniac with no redeeming qualities. He takes an instant dislike to the gang. ‘They’re a buncha commies,’ he seethes, although the chances of any of them reading up on Marx or Engels are about the same as this guy ever being described as warm-hearted or lovable. He hatches a plan to make sure their visit won’t last long.\n\n‘You never can tell on a day like this,’ Vance drawls via a voice-over early on. ‘Things could be goin’ jake one minute, then, presto, before you know it, you’re history.’ Will things go jake for Vance and the gang? I wouldn’t want to give too much away but the chances of a big ol’ happy ending here are slim. Needlefish slim.\n\nKathryn Bigelow and Monty Montgomery, a pair who’d studied together at NYC’s Columbia Uni and worked on the Debbie Harry vehicle Union City, Montgomery as creative producer, Bigelow being the script supervisor, not only co-directed but also co-wrote the screenplay and Montgomery has since admitted that maybe they should have spent more time on their script.\n\nComparisons have been drawn to other biker movies and the basic plot does resemble The Wild One in many regards, while the focus on long lingering shots of lustrous chrome and leather bring to mind Kenneth Anger’s Scorpio Rising, influences that Bigelow has acknowledged. Interestingly enough, clips of The Wild One can be glimpsed on a TV during Anger’s film which he claims just happened to be showing as he shot a scene with a biker in his room, describing this as a ‘magical coincidence’, although I’d just call it a coincidence. Then again, I’m no occultist.\n\nLike Scorpio Rising, the soundtrack of The Loveless is very good, especially Eddy Dixon’s Relentless and Robert Gordon’s End Theme. Chris ‘Motorbikin’ Spedding played guitar on a number of tracks, and there’s some period music too, including Little Richard’s Rip It Up. Not completely my thing, but it works pretty much perfectly with the impressive visuals.\n\nOn its release few critics loved the film. Many felt frustrated by its sluggish pace and some accused its directors of favouring style over substance. The characters are also a hard bunch to take to. Even Telena, the film’s most sympathetic character, possesses some very negative personality traits. Emotionally empty from the off, Vance is far from your average protagonist and when the plot finally gets going in the final third, he remains almost annoyingly apathetic to the action in two key moments both involving Telena.\n\nDespite the restrictions of his character, Willem Dafoe proves himself to already be an exceptionally gifted actor and he has, of course, since enjoyed a long and busy career working with the likes of Martin Scorsese, Abel Ferrara, Robert Eggers and David Lynch – he played Bobby Peru in Wild at Heart, where Monty Montgomery served as one of a trio of producers. Has there been a more consistently fine actor in Hollywood since the 1980s dawned? I can’t think of any.\n\nMarin Kanter’s next film would be the punkish Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (with Steve Jones, Paul Cook and Paul Simonon among others), although in contrast to Dafoe, she failed to establish herself as a regular presence on cinema screens.\n\nAs for Robert Gordon, his turn as Davis turned out to be his second and final appearance on the big screen*. The life of an actor with early morning rises and often mind-numbingly lengthy waits between takes didn’t appeal to him. He continued on in the music business without ever breaking through as a major act and will maybe remain best remembered for the song Fire, which was gifted to him by Bruce Springsteen, who also contributed keyboards to the track and later recorded it himself.\n\nKathryn Bigelow went on to make cinematic history, becoming the first woman to bag an Oscar for best director for The Hurt Locker in 2010. I realise it’s a minority view, but I prefer her 1980s output, especially the vampire western Near Dark. That same decade she also shot a memorable promo for Mötley Crüe, I mean New Order, though not for their track Love Less. According to Hooky, the idea for this video came from Bernard ‘Ace’ Sumner and he also claims that many American fans who’d seen the video turned up on their next US tour expecting the band to be wearing the same kind of hair metal clobber when they took to the stage. Don’t know if I believe that one but it’s yet another entertaining anecdote from the bassist.\n\n*Gordon’s other claim to cinematic fame was appearing with Debbie Harry in Amos Poe’s Unmade Beds in 1976. His band of the time Tuff Darts shared many a bill with Blondie at CBGB including the opening night of their 1975 summer festival of unsigned bands, with The Ramones and Talking Heads also on the bill.\n\nA human sized female mouse is flabbergasted about recent events at Vince Lombardi High and she’s squeaking angrily to the Principal. On her cutesy dress is embroidered ‘I Hate Mousework’.\n\nOn first seeing Rock’n’Roll High School in 1979 (it was shot the year before although it’s set in the very near future of 1980), I wasn’t entirely convinced by it. I’d wanted something that resembled producer Roger Corman’s biker flicks from the 1960s but with punk rockers. Or maybe a social realist film shot in the streets surrounding CBGB, featuring a bunch of desperado Ramones fans behaving badly.\n\nThis is a very different beast. A teensploitation flick that focuses on comedy as much as it does on music, some of it gloriously silly.\n\nThen there was the fact that the schoolkids were all so old. As filming took place I was still at secondary school myself. On screen, The Ramones’ biggest fan and leading Vince Lombardi rebel Riff Randell is played by P.J. Soles, who was over a decade older than me, albeit she was a very young looking 28.\n\nThe movie kicks off on the day when Riff’s soon to be nemesis, Miss Evelyn Togar takes over as Principal. Her main aim is to improve discipline. She’s a prim and proper authoritarian and vehemently opposed to modern music. And this uptight woman is played wonderfully by Mary Woronov, former dancer with The Velvet Underground!\n\nThe problem between the pair is later summed up by Togar as: ‘I am a reasonable, well educated, mature, adult member of society and you are a spoiled, heathen punk.’ Randell, though, isn’t dressed in black with spiky hair and there’s not a safety pin in sight. Instead, she wears bright colours. When we first see her, she’s wearing a red satin jacket patterned with musical notes. If the movie had been named Disco High, she would have fitted in just as well.\n\nOkay, a little background and something of a spoiler. Roger Corman was initially keen on the movie being called Disco High to cash in on the success of Saturday Night Fever. Director Allan Arkush, though, had other ideas. A man who’d worked for years at the Fillmore East, where he’d seen the likes of The Who, Doors and Led Zeppelin, Arkush wanted a rock band to feature, a wise decision, as by this point disco was absolutely mainstream, with clubs like Studio 54 employing an elitist door policy. The climax of the script was to be the pupils blowing up their school and a disco inferno just wouldn’t work. Loud and fast guitars were required and who better to provide that than The Ramones?\n\nAllan Arkush hadn’t appreciated the band on first hearing them but had eventually got them after repeated listens to their debut album. By the time the film was in development, Rocket To Russia was one of his ten favourite albums.\n\nAs he cast the film, P.J. Soles wasn’t even aware of the CBGB favourites and her initial reaction on hearing them was: ‘Is this music?’\n\nCo-star Dey Young, who plays Kate, Riff’s geeky best pal, hadn’t heard of them either and when she first met them, she ‘thought they were the oddest creatures I had ever seen.’ You might think she was exaggerating but according to their tour manager Monte A Melnick’s book On The Road With The Ramones, back then in the warm Californian sun, they had problems even entering Disneyland: ‘Because we looked so weird,’ while another time: ‘Joey and Dee Dee decided they wanted to walk around Hollywood, so I went with them. The police stopped us within minutes.’ Most of the world took a while to catch up with the NYC band.\n\nIronically, the only cast members who already knew and admired them were Paul Bartel, who plays Mister McGree and none other than Miss Togar herself, Mary Woronov. Mary has also admitted to being high on the set! And she wasn’t the only one.\n\nThere’s even some mild drugtaking in one of the movie’s most memorable scenes, when Riff smokes a joint (in reality a herbal ciggy) and fantasises about The Ramones playing in her bedroom, Joey serenading her with I Want You Around as he gangles around her.\n\nBeing one of Roger’s Corman New World productions, the budget was tight but even so Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky were often bored hanging around while waiting for the cameras to roll. Luxuries were scarce on the set, and they weren’t keen on the early starts required by film crews. The school’s empty classrooms functioned as dressing rooms. Sometimes they would head over to the school fence, where local punk fans congregated. Some threw over drugs, which Dee Dee was all too happy to pick up, pocket and then try out. He was out his face for the entire shoot. Although an expert in lines of drugs, his three lines of dialogue in the screenplay had to be pruned to one. And even that required take after take after take.\n\nJoey wasn’t much better. He kept forgetting Mister McGree’s name and repeatedly called him Mister McGloop. Due to the tightness of the schedule that day, Allan Arkush was forced to keep Joey’s mistake in – which I reckon only adds to the fun.\n\nThe two giant mice we see had as much chance of carving out careers as actors in Hollywood as any of the band.\n\nIn her gym class, Riff performs a new song she’s written with the intention of delivering in person to Joey and persuading The Ramones to play it: Rock’n’Roll High School. This is great, even though you might accuse the verses of Riff’s song of resembling Sheena Is A Punk Rocker too closely, but forget that, how can she get the song into the hands of her heroes?\n\nLuckily they announce a tour with a date at the Roxy in LA – sorry, the ‘Rockatorium’ in LA.\n\nOf course, just about everybody in school wants to see the show but only Riff is prepared to skip school for three days to land herself a spot at the front of the queue. On the third day, they pull up to the venue in the Ramonesmobile, a pink Cadillac convertible with Gabba Gabba Hey license plates, and proceed to enter the building, playing I Just Wanna Have Something to Do as they do so. It’s crazy. It’s great. In reality, it was 7 in the morning and they were all as hungover as hell.\n\nRiff snaps up one hundred tickets, which have been requested by her classmates, but unfortunately for Riff and Kate, Miss Togar confiscates their tickets when she discovers the reason for Riff’s recent absence from school.\n\nWill our heroine and her pal somehow get to the concert? You bet. But when Miss Togar discovers Riff and Kate defied her, she launches her ‘first major step in putting the school back on the right track,’ the next morning with a mass burning of rock albums including those by The Ramones.\n\nThis means war.\n\nP.J. Soles is the bubbliest Ramones fan ever but eventually her infectiousness won me over and the fact that she wants to be a songwriter rather than just find the boyfriend of her dreams (she only has eyes for Joey) makes a nice change for a teen movie, although there is also a more traditional subplot where Kate desperately wants to go out with Tom Roberts (Vincent Van Patten), the captain of the football team, and the kind of All American boy that Riff has zero interest in. Of course, Tom only sees Kate’s big owlish glasses and swotty persona – although those science skills of hers are gonna come in handy later in the film. He becomes desperate to date Riff. Problems. Problems.\n\nSeymour Stein and Jonathan Brett coordinated the soundtrack and, considering the movie’s cost (around $200,000), they worked marvels. It not only includes The Ramones but acts such as The MC5, Velvet Underground, Alice Cooper, Eddie and the Hot Rods and even Fleetwood Mac and Wings.\n\nYou won’t be surprised that the best thing about the film is getting to see The Ramones at the top of their form perform Blitzkrieg Bop, Teenage Lobotomy, California Sun, Pinhead, and She’s the One live. Superb stuff. It took me back to my own schooldays, seeing them play a pulverising set at the Glasgow Apollo in 1977. Still one of the very best concerts I’ve ever attended.\n\nFinally, a little trivia. James Cameron of Titanic and Avatar fame, worked uncredited as an production assistant. And if you ask me this is much more enjoyable than anything else he went on to direct. As I watched last night, I even smiled widely at the mum mouse’s ‘I Hate Mousework’ dress.\n\nIndeed, so much did I enjoy the movie this time around, that I made the frankly stupid decision to seek out 1991’s unofficial sequel of sorts Rock ‘n’ Roll High School Forever. Hey, we all make bad decisions in life and hopefully we learn from them.\n\nEven Mary Woronov can’t save things as quasi-fascist Vice Principal Vadar, a more extreme version of Miss Togar. Ruth, Kate and Tom are long gone, replaced by a bunch of charmless pranksters who play in a band called The Eradicators. How bad are they? They even manage to drain every bit of life out of a song like Tutti Frutti. I’m still attempting to eradicate their music from my memory.\n\nI’m likely atypical on this one. I’m guessing we’ve all heard people speculate about the period of history and place that they would most like to witness if a time machine existed that could transport them back. Suggestions tend to involve grand events, being able to see the first Olympics in ancient Greece or getting a gander at Michelangelo as he painted the Sistine Chapel.\n\nMe? I’d like to be able to see some shows by the likes of The Sex Pistols and The Clash in London in 1976. Or take in early appearances by the New York punk acts just a little earlier at iconic venue CBGB.\n\nLuckily young film school student Julian Temple had the nous to take his camera along when he had the chance to document the Pistoleros and Clash live before they’d ever issued even a single, so at least I can get a flavour of events.\n\nOver in NYC, Amos Poe was already doing something very similar along with Czech born musician Ivan Král.\n\nAmos Poe had been born abroad too, in Tel Aviv. In the States, he got to know guys like Richard Hell and Terry Ork while working for New Line Cinema, when it was an independent film distribution company. He hired Král as his assistant and, in their spare time, the pair began filming a number of new bands together.\n\nChoosing Král was an inspired choice. This was a young man with an intersting backstory. As a teenager he’d scored a hit in Czechoslovakia with a band called Saze (translation: Soot), but this success came just after his family relocated to America, where they had to be protected by the FBI as the Communists regime there were desperate to imprison his father for publicly condemning the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia at the UN. Ivan became involved with glam rockers Luger, who played Max’s Kansas City and often supported Kiss in their early days. More significantly, he briefly joined an embryonic Blondie and then the Patti Smith Group, two bands at the heart of the burgeoning New York punk scene. On his own accord he’d already recorded some footage of Iggy and The Stooges on his dad’s Yashica Super 8, before teaming up with Poe.\n\nActually, Král partly shot live bands as aide memoirs of his stay in New York in case he was ever deported back to Communist Czechoslovakia. Thankfully, he wasn’t.\n\nWhen he and Poe had filmed enough bands, the pair decided they could assemble it into something that might do the rounds of America’s often lucrative midnight movie circuit.\n\nThe Blank Generation is mostly shot at CBGB but The Bottom Line in Greenwich Village and Max’s are two of the other locations utilised.\n\nThe handheld camera is restless throughout, swish panning around. Shot in 16mm black and white, it opens with two Patti Smith tracks. There’s Gloria followed by her take on the Velvet Underground’s We’re Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together. Not the whole songs, a chunk of the former and just a snippet of the latter. One minute Patti’s in a biker jacket, the next in some kind of poncho dress, then she’s in a T-shirt. At one point, book in hand, she’s obviously giving a poetry reading. The sound is not synched, and no effort has gone into attempting to make it appear as if it might be.\n\nThis is because Poe, who did the bulk of the editing in the space of 24 hours, wanted to reference Jean-Luc Godard, who’d been keen to make viewers very aware they were watching a movie back when he was directing Nouvelle Vague classics like Breathless and Bande à part. Think of that famous dance scene in the latter when the jukebox music is repeatedly faded out to make way for some narration.\n\nNext up is Television with Tom Verlaine displaying the kind of sunken cheekbones that suggest he could have been doing with a decent plate of scran. Heroin chic before that term had been coined. We get Little Johnny Jewel and Mi Amore (and then some more Little Johnny Jewel for no easily identifiable reason).\n\nAgain snippets only and out-of-synch sound. Which is becoming more and more disconcerting the longer I watch.\n\nTime for some salvos of speed bubblegum in the shape of The Ramones. LoudmouthShockTreatmentIDon’tCareBlitzkriegBopLoudmouth. Hell, yeah. We’re then treated to a young and preppy looking David Byrne and Talking Heads looking suitably tense and nervous as they perform Psycho Killer. At this point Tina Weymouth could still be termed a beginner on the bass but this bassline is one of the most perfect you will ever hear.\n\nAfter these CBGB superstars, we have a stream of bands that mostly might be called CBGB Division 2.\n\nThe Tuff Darts play down n’ dirty rock’n’roll. And it strikes me that it might have been an idea to flash up the band names along the way rather than leaving it to the end to let us know who some of these people are. Wayne (now Jayne) County is certainly recognizable enough, though, as he/she puts his/her own spin on Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl?\n\nIn among the Division 2 bands like The Marbles, The Miamis and The Shirts are Blondie. This might seem surprising, but the band were initially not thought of very highly by many. When Charles Shaar Murray crossed the Atlantic to cover the burgeoning scene for NME at the tail-end of 1975, he predicted that ‘Blondie will never be a star because she ain’t good enough.’ We all get things wrong, CSM.\n\nDebbie loves the camera but not as much as the camera loves those cheekbones and that pout of her’s. Here she wants to be platinum blonde, just like Marilyn and Jeane, Jayne, Mae and Marlene. This sequence with some live footage and some messing around on a fire escape and three of the guys pushing a car down a road could work as a video in its own right, albeit a particularly scuzzy video.\n\nRather than anything remotely punk, Harry Toledo’s Knots sounds like ominous psych. So ominous that you could imagine it having been written and recorded in the immediate wake of some awful late 1960s event like Altamont or the Tate-LaBianca murders. I like it a lot. According to the booklet that accompanies the Max’s Kansas City 1976 album, Harry had disappeared from the music world by the start of the 1980s, leaving only one EP produced by John Cale. A shame.\n\nNew York Dolls track Funky But Chic isn’t one of their strongest and maybe they just look too respectable as they perform it. By the Doll’s standards anyway. They no longer look like the future but The Heartbreakers, who end the film do. This is when Richard Hell was part of the band and the song that would become the anthem of New York punk was a highlight of their set.\n\nBackstage, Lizzy Mercier Descloux poses moodily with Richard Hell and we also see glimpses of the CBGB New Year’s Eve party of 1975. Oh look, there’s Tina Weymouth. Wow, a smiling Debbie’s partying too. Is that John Cale in the festive paper hat? It sure is.\n\nThe film premiered at CBGB on a night that also saw The Heartbreakers play live. Since then Poe has made many films and even had a shot at writing for Hollywood. It wasn’t for him. He’s been described as ‘the titan of the No Wave Cinema Movement’ and ‘the progenitor of punk cinema’.\n\nIn her new autobiography Face It, Debbie Harry writes about how she and Chris Stein once planned to produce a remake of Godard’s Alphaville, with Debbie in the Anna Karina role and Robert Fripp playing Lemmy Caution. Godard thought they were crazy but sold them the rights anyway. Although he didn’t own them. Their record company resisted the idea of them taking time off to pursue such a project anyway, and not too surprisingly, the Poe, Harry and Stein Alphaville never got off the ground. Probably for the best.\n\nToday Amos spends much of his time painting and teaching film.\n\nIvan went on to compose music for some other Poe films including Subway Riders. After playing with Patti, he joined up with Iggy Pop.\n\nA sometimes frustrating but utterly fascinating watch, The Blank Generation remains a crucial document of the emerging mid-1970s music scene and I am very grateful to Poe and Král for chronicling so many of the key players in an age before concert-goers had the chance to spend most of their time aiming iPhones at the stage.\n\nI would have liked to have seen Suicide but hey, they didn’t play CBGB at all in 1975 when most of The Blank Generation was shot. A wee bit of research tells me they did play in the summer of 1974 in a support slot with The Fast and didn’t return until three nights in December 1976 in a support slot for The Ramones. This ended with a show on the night of the 25th. How Christmassy that must have been? Yo ho ho.\n\nCome on inventors, get a move on. I want a time machine ASAP and if I ever get one you can bet I might just set those controls to the Bowery on that particular Christmas night.\n\nFor more on The Blank Generation: https://theblankgeneration.com/\n\nFor more on Amos Poe: http://www.amospoe.com/\n\nFor more on Amos Poe, Ivan Ivan Král : http://www.ivankral.net/"
