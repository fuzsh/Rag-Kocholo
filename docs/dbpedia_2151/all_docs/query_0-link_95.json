        "text": "Fall 2023\n\nENG 813: Literature in English before 1800: Unread Shakespeare\n\nInstructor: Dr. Stephen Deng\n\nTh: 5:00 – 7:50 pm\n\nAs a tribute to my late mentor Richard Helgerson, who regularly taught a course of this name and concept, “Unread Shakespeare” will focus on lesser-read Shakespeare plays, with the “lesser” qualification being determined by what Shakespeare works (plays or poems) students in the class have or have not previously read. The course book will be a complete works of Shakespeare, and on the first day, we will go through and mark which works students have not read. We will then compile a list of the works that few or none have read, and we will decide as a class which works we will read throughout the semester. Students will be responsible for weekly response papers that I will use to establish an agenda for discussion based on students’ interests. Students will also have three presentations throughout the semester: one on a critical article or book about the work we are reading for that week; one on a historical topic related to the work; and the final in a “mini-conference” in which students will discuss their final paper project. Feedback from the mini-conference event should aid students in completing a 15-20 page final paper to be turned in at the end of the semester.\n\nENG 818: Studies in Genre and Media Popular Culture: U.S. Comics Culture and Practice\n\nInstructor: Dr. Julian Chambliss\n\nM: 5:00 – 7:50 pm\n\nThis class will examine the comic book page, aesthetics, and history in the United States. We will address critical inquiry in comic studies before exploring texts, creators, and movements that have defined comic culture in the United States. Significant themes include newspaper comic strips, superheroes, graphic memoirs, and racial representation. This course will address form’s evolution, comic production, and how cultural narratives linked to comics in the United States have evolved over time.\n\nENG 818 Histories in Genre and Media: The Public Humanities\n\nInstructor: Dr. Joseph Darda\n\nW 5:00 – 7:50 pm\n\nWhat is a public? A public sphere? A counterpublic? And which public does the public humanist aspire to reach? This seminar will consider what it means to do the public humanities and what it tells us about the rest of the (private?) humanities. We will engage with a wide range of humanities scholars who have––through writing, filmmaking, podcasting, and community organizing––reached an audience that includes more than, well, us. Borrowing the methods of, among others, Judith Butler, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, LeAnne Howe, David Graeber, Jill Lepore, and Khalil Gibran Muhammad, we will develop public humanities projects of our own. Expectations include not writing a seminar paper.\n\nFLM 800: Methods in Film Studies\n\nInstructor: Dr. Joshua Yumibe\n\nTh: 4:10 – 6:00 pm, 7:00 – 10:00 pm\n\nThis course offers an introduction to methods of interpreting, writing on, and teaching film. It is designed to help graduate students develop a research and teaching trajectory in cinema and media studies for their work at MSU and beyond. Students will begin by engaging with tools of close analysis and basic concepts of film form. They will move from there to categories of genre, authorship, and other critical traditions that engage the medium as a social institution, psycho-sexual apparatus, and cultural practice. The course will introduce students to subfields of film history and theory, digital and archival media, and race cinema, particularly as these areas pertain to cinema as a medium in global circulation. We will have ongoing discussions of teaching and syllabi development throughout the semester. Screenings will be connected to the MSU Film Collective on Thursday nights and may contain work by filmmakers such as Charles Burnett, Maya Deren, Sergei Eisenstein, Alice Rohrwacher, Sarah Maldoror, Mariam Ghani, and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nFLM 820: Studies in Postcolonial Cinema: Cinema and Media of the Middle East\n\nInstructor: Dr. Kaveh Askari\n\nT: 9:10 am – 12:00 pm, Th: 9:10 – 11:00 am\n\nThe goal of this course is to address some of the major trends and issues in cinema produced and exhibited around Southwest Asia and North Africa, including the contexts of their production and audiences. We will discuss how we can integrate critical theory relevant to the Middle East with the weekly screenings of works of cinematic art produced in cities throughout the region from the 1950s to the present day. The course gives special attention to cinema, but topics will range from photography in colonies and royal courts, to video installation in galleries, to contemporary social media. We will learn how to analyze Middle Eastern media work, and how to situate it within a historical context that pays particular attention to the intersections of art and social organization.\n\nSpring 2024\n\nENG 800 Race, Gender & The Human\n\nInstructor: Yomaira Figueroa\n\nW: 11:30 – 2:20 pm\n\nTheoretical and historical considerations of the category of the human. Attention to the development of race, ethnicity, gender and their critical intersections in relation to the U.S. and the discipline of the Humanities.\n\nCourse objectives:\n\nUnderstanding the particular forms of inequality rooted in the most brutal forms of radical dehumanization. Introduce students to historical and theoretical understandings of the human and to questions of value, equity, and social justice. Train students to reflect upon the current conditions of knowledge production in the U.S. and the history of the humanities and the university in the context of these issues.\n\nColonialism, Settler Colonialism Afterlives of Slavery and Indigenous Dispossession Construction of Gender and Sex as Science Histories and Theories of Racialized Gender Diaspora and Border Studies Engagement with Ethnic Studies and Disability Studies\n\nHistory of the Humanities Discipline Interdisciplinary Approaches to the Humanities\n\nENG 802: Literary Criticism and Theory\n\nInstructor: Kinitra Brooks\n\nT: 3:00 – 5:50 pm\n\nOne of the major ways in which marginalized folks are pushed out of crucial conversations and methodologies in academia and beyond is through intimidation–often achieved by using what is considered “high” theory or les belles-lettres. In this course, we will familiarize ourselves with those thinkers and influencers of the hegemonic discourse and read them through critical race and gender lenses. It is my hope that you leave this course more confident and surer of your critical positionality–and that you don’t get a feeling of dread or fear every time someone brings up Hegel, Kant, or Foucault.\n\nENG 814.002: Literature in English after 1800: Empire, Race, and Disability in Nineteenth-Century Britain and the U.S.\n\nInstructor: Zarena Aslami\n\nT, Th: 12:40 – 2:00 pm\n\nThis course takes a transnational and transimperial approach to reading key nineteenth-century literary and nonfiction texts created in Britain, throughout its empire, and in its former colony, the United States. British and U.S. national and imperial formations, practices, and discourses conceptualized what it meant to be human and what it meant to be an imperial citizen, as they expanded their empires in the name of progress, civilization, and destiny. In doing so, they relied upon concepts of race and disability that were mutually constitutive and deeply entangled. In this course, we will track the intersections of race and disability across a selection of prominent novels, poems, and memoirs of the period. We will also discuss how gender, sexuality, and economic relations intersect with race and disability. Finally, while attending to these representations, we will ask how certain texts critique and resist official and institutional discourses about what race and disability mean, pointing to utopic possibilities for self and belonging. Possible literary readings include Mary Prince, Charles Dickens, Walt Whitman, Black Hawk, Charlotte Brontë, Arthur Conan Doyle, James Fenimore Cooper, and Mary Seacole.\n\nENG 814.001: Literature in English after 1800: Dario Fo & Franca Rame: Marxists, Feminists, Stage Jesters\n\nInstructor: Juliet Guzzetta\n\nM W: 12:20 – 2:00 pm\n\nIn 1997 Dario Fo won the Nobel prize for literature to the sound of gasps, sneers and applause around the world. With Franca Rame, his partner in life and art for 70 years, they enjoyed the distinction of being the most performed living playwrights across the globe for more than three decades of their lives. Known for their fearless political satire, was their theater a method of political protest or was it an artistic practice that engaged contemporary politics, societies, and structural bias? How can one use performance as an analytical tool to think about society, and how is theater itself a tool that can influence society? In this class we will consider the connections between art and activism, protest and performance, crafted comedy and real-life tragedy.\n\nExpect to expand, explore, and experiment with practices of reading, watching, theorizing, writing, and maybe even performing.\n\nENG 826: Special Topics: Peculiar Genres of Academic Writing\n\nInstructor: Kathleen Fitzpatrick\n\nM: 4:10- 7:00 pm\n\nThe vast majority of writing practice in graduate school is focused on the seminar paper, which serves as a prototype for the journal articles it’s expected you’ll produce across your career. And fair enough! The journal article is an important genre, and one that demands a lot of practice. But some of the most important forms of writing that you’re likely to do in the future, wherever your career path may lead, are all too rarely taught. So this course, which is more writing workshop than seminar, will give you exposure to and practice in several such forms – including the blog post, the op/ed, the personal statement, and perhaps most importantly the grant proposal – to explore how they work and what they’re asking of you. It will also aim to give you some tools to bring to bear on the other peculiar genres you might run into over the years — hopefully with good results for your more standard writing practices, too.\n\nWS 897: Feminist Theories, Epistemologies, and Pedagogy\n\nInstructor: Ellen McCallum\n\nW 4:10 – 7:00 pm\n\nFall 2022\n\n1) ENG 802: Literary Criticism and Theory\n\nAesthetics, Politics, and the Problem of Knowledge\n\nEllen McCallum\n\nWednesday 4:10-7:00\n\nThis episode of ENG 802 will set up exchanges between classical and contemporary critical theories. We’ll look at how classical critical theory sought to overturn existing orders of knowledge and how contemporary thinkers have been taking that overturning to the next level. Possible exchanges may include:\n\nFoucault’s Order of Things, Wynter, and Ferguson’s Re-order of Things. Adorno and Moten’s In the Break. Heidegger and Calvin Warren. Freud and Khanna’s Dark Continents. Derrida’s Grammatology and Spivak. Chuh’s The Difference Aesthetics Makes and Benjamin/Adorno/Brecht’s exchanges in Aesthetics and Politics. Sedgwick’s Epistemology of the Closet and Amin’s Disturbing Attachments.\n\n2) ENG 813: Literatures in English before 1800\n\nReading the Early Modern Archive: Cross-cultural Encounters and Identity Formations (1550-1700)\n\nJyotsna Singh\n\nMonday 3:00-5:50\n\nThe course will be based entirely on pre-1800 primary materials in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at the MSU Libraries.\n\nIt will be will be structured as a seminar with a two-fold purpose:\n\nIt will introduce students to primary cultural, historical, and literary texts that cover selected topics such as (but not exclusively): Travel Writing, “Discoveries” of Africa, Race and Religion, Climate and Geography, Islamic empires, Global Trade, as well as selected literary works by authors such as Shakespeare, Spenser, and Marlowe.\n\nIt will also cover a material investigation of books and book production, covering topics such as early modern print culture and the production, circulation, and provenance of selected texts.\n\nWe will study the above topics within the framework of the theoretical/cultural readings below: ( access through D2L)\n\n“Unpacking my Library: A Talk about Book Collecting,” Walter Benjamin (1931), In Illuminations,Ed, Hannah Arendt.\n\n“Colonial Archives and the Art of Governance,” Laura Ann Stoler, Archival Science2002.\n\n“ ‘ To Go Beyond’: Towards a Decolonial Archival Practice,” J. J. Ghaddar and Michelle Caswell, Archival Science, 2019.\n\nAt least half the classes will be held in the Special Collections reading room in the MSU Libraries. Each student will also be required to visit the Reading Room and consult the books on reserve. Activities of the course will include readings, discussions, class presentations, and three written assignments, the final project being an article-length paper on a topic each student will develop in consultation with the professor. You also be asked to familiarize yourself with the Early English Books online (EEBO) database in the MSU Libraries Electronic resources. No purchase of texts is required.\n\n3) ENG 819: Special Topics in Language and Literature\n\nDr. Sheila Contreras\n\nTuesday/Thursday 12:40-2:00\n\nIn the late 1970s, Lorna Dee Cervantes in “Poem for the Young White Man Who Asked How I An Intelligent Well-Read Person Could Believe in a War Between Races,” wrote “I am not a revolutionary/I don’t even like political poems.”\n\nIn an interview with Alexander Chee as a finalist for the Aspen Prize, Valeria Luiselli, author of Lost Children Archive, discussed her novel in the context of her work translating in the courts for unaccompanied minor children. At one point, she says that she had to start over because she realized that she was writing with a purpose, and novels should not have a purpose. To write a novel with a purpose “would be a disservice to my guild” (paraphrased).\n\nAmalia Ortíz, in her Preface to Canción Cannibal Cabaret, claims poetic propaganda as her purpose: “I embraced the idea of creating a self-aware production aimed at making an impact as thought the performance itself were a propaganda campaign”(xiv). Luiselli’s position derives from Aristotle’s Poetics, and an emphasis on craft and aesthetics have guided literary criticism and analysis for a good, long time.\n\nHere, I would like to explore the relationship between literature and politics, aesthetics and propaganda, escapism and activism. Along the way, we will also look at current journalism around “woke librarians” and the dismantling of structural analysis in the classroom (CRT). In this historical moment, pressing questions come to the fore as the policing of the educational space intensifies: What does it mean to talk about “aesthetics”? Are such discussions always separate from social context and “purpose”? How does the idea of “craft” configure reader expectations, and do those expectations limit forms of literary production? What role does literature play in politics, social critique and transformation? Should literature be expected or allowed to play such a role?\n\nI hope that we can come up with additional, new questions to propel our analysis. I look forward to the answers we will forge together.\n\nTentative Reading List:\n\nAristotle, Poetics.\n\nHernández, Leticia. Mucha Muchacha/too much girl. 2015.\n\nCervantes, Lorna Dee. Emplumada. 1981.\n\nLuiselli, Valeria. Lost Children Archive. 2019.\n\nOrtíz, Amalia. Rant, Chant, Chisme. 2015.\n\n—. Canción Cannibal Cabaret. 2019.\n\nVillanueva, Tino. Scene from the Movie Giant. 1993.\n\n4) ENG 826: Special Topics Seminar\n\nQueer Archives\n\nKristin Mahoney\n\nTuesday 3:00-5:50\n\nIn this course, we will consider the affective drives that guide the reconstruction of queer history. What motivates the desire to look backwards, and how do we respond when we are unable to see what we want in the past? We will think about the practices historical subjects used to encode and record their desires and identities, and we will consider contemporary practices for ordering, arranging, and digitizing these records. How do we alter or shape the interpretation of records through archival practices? Our readings will raise questions about what constitutes an archive, what cannot be archived, and what political functions queer archives might perform. We will move between the analysis of literary texts and archival material that might frame or reshape our reading of these texts, and we will work with digital archives as well as the LGBTQ+ Collection in MSU’s Special Collections, engaging in original archival research and curating collections of material for the participants in the course.\n\n5) FLM 820: Topics in Film Studies\n\nFilm Festivals and World Cinema\n\nKaveh Askari\n\nThursday 4:10-7:00\n\nThis course will offer students an opportunity to explore how the institution of the film festival has shaped possibilities of cinema as a global medium from the 1950s to the present day. We will discuss the role of the film festival in circulating films across national borders (consulting theories of the provenance of film as it travels), in establishing standards of taste (engaging the historiography of world cinema and its connection to world literature), in preserving certain canons of forgotten films (tracking the efforts of organizations like the World Cinema Foundation), and in establishing forms of community. We will consider festivals’ roles in social movements–from midcentury notions of global solidarity to contemporary grassroots media activism. As our schedule permits, we will video conference with festival directors, programmers, and archivists from major film festivals around the world. The course will be linked to the fall Film Collective. The program will consist of films that surprised audiences, created controversy, or otherwise marked turning points in the history of film festivals.\n\nSpring 2023\n\n1) ENG 800: Studies in Race, Gender, and the Human\n\nZarena Aslami\n\nMonday 4:10 – 7:00 PM\n\nThis course introduces students to the study of how the modern concepts of race and gender shape the category of the human across discourses and institutions. As scholars and teachers in the particular site of the U.S. research university, we will examine how our concrete present has been shaped by the past and the stories the past has told about power, legitimacy, and who counts as human. While Enlightenment thinkers in Europe and the British settler colonies in North America, then later the U.S., sought to free themselves from the State and the Church by vaunting the principles of reason, objectivity, equality, and the right to property and self-possession, they simultaneously bound some human subjects to continued servitude, oppression, objectification, and dispossession. What are the seductions of humanist thinking? What are the violent consequences? How do we do intellectual work within, against, and beyond this context? In this course, we will examine the historical development of the humanities and social sciences and the history of the U.S. university. We will also explore alternative methodologies and practices that work toward different social imaginaries.\n\n2) ENG 814: Literatures in English after 1800\n\nRace and American Modernism\n\nJoshua Lam\n\nMonday/Wednesday 10:20-11:40\n\nHow has racial difference been inscribed in the creation and canonization of modernist aesthetics in the US? While race has long been regarded as central to the development of American modernity, scholars (and editors, publishers, anthologists) have often regarded the modernist aesthetics of canonical figures like Gertrude Stein, T.S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound as distinct from African American literary aesthetics of the same era, including those associated with the Harlem Renaissance and the New Negro movement. This course will examine texts from “traditional” (ostensibly white/European) modernism and African American modernism, framed by recent critical attempts to complicate this putative divide. Our historical scope will be broad; with a focus on primary texts, we will read literature from the post-Reconstruction era; canonical modernist figures; “New Negro” writers and anthologies; and a few authors who resist placement in these lineages and milieus. We will also examine scholarly attempts to challenge the notion that white and black writers created what Michael North calls “two different modernisms.” These include interdisciplinary and historical accounts of “Jim Crow Modernism”; investigations of racial imitation and masquerade; narratives of passing and queer of color critique; and scholarship on sound and recording technologies (e.g., sonic Afro-modernity).\n\nThe seminar will be driven by questions about the coherence and diversity of aesthetic forms; the relation between aesthetic forms and social categories of identity; and their mutual imbrication with material historical conditions (from urbanization and segregation to publishing and print culture). While our primary focus will be the role of race in the formation of modernist aesthetics in the US, we will also attend to how scholars treat race as an analytical category in contemporary literary studies. The seminar is designed to introduce students to the varied aesthetics of literary modernisms, and to help students evaluate frameworks for thinking about race and intersectional identities in US literature. It will engage primarily with the fields of modernist studies and African American literature, with important contributions from Black studies and critical race theory.\n\nWhat this class is not: This course does not aim to provide a standard history of modernist literature, nor does it focus exclusively on African American literature. It is organized by examining intersections between the fields of modernist studies and African American studies, which were institutionalized as fields of academic study separately (modernism in the 1950s, Black studies in the late 1960s). Inspired by scholarship and academic work that began to examine points of intersection (first in the 1980s, then accelerated within modernist studies in the late 1990s), this class returns to the old question “what was modernism?” and seeks to: a) chart new paths and answers to that question (‘new to you’ and/or new to all of us) through our own readings of the primary texts, and b) examine some of the ways that question has been answered by scholars in the last two decades through readings of secondary texts (intended primarily for graduate students).\n\nPrimary texts may include:\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois, Darkwater: Voices from Within the Veil\n\nPauline Hopkins, Of One Blood: Or, the Hidden Self\n\nGertrude Stein, Three Lives\n\nJean Toomer, Cane\n\nWaldo Frank, Holiday\n\nNella Larsen, Passing\n\nAlain Locke (ed.), The New Negro\n\nWallace Thurman et al. (ed.), Fire!!\n\nGeorge S. Schuyler, Black No More\n\nJohn Dos Passos, Manhattan Transfer\n\nRichard Wright, Lawd Today!\n\nSelections from secondary texts such as:\n\nK. Merinda Simmons & James A. Crank, Race and New Modernisms\n\nHouston A. Baker, Jr., Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance\n\nRoss Posnock, Color and Culture: Black Writers and the Making of the Modern Intellectual\n\nJames Smethurst, The African American Roots of Modernism: From Reconstruction to the Harlem Renaissance\n\nRachel Blau DuPlessis, Genders, Races, and Religious Cultures in Modern American Poetry, 1908-1934\n\nDavid Levering Lewis, When Harlem Was In Vogue\n\nSiobhan B. Somerville, Queering the Color Line: Race and the Invention of Homosexuality\n\nMichael North, The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language & Twentieth-Century Literature\n\nAldon Lynn Nielsen, Reading Race: White American Poets and the Racial Discourse in the Twentieth Century\n\n3) ENG 818: Studies in Genre and Media\n\nPopular Culture: History, Practice, and Theory\n\nGary Hoppenstand\n\nTuesday/Thursday 7:00 – 8:20 PM\n\nThis class will examine the dynamic social, cultural, and technological relationships that led to the establishment and dominance of a national entertainment culture in America over the past two hundred years, following the advent of the Industrial Revolution. The major topics to be covered in the course include: 1) The popular press (such as dime novels, pulp magazines, newspaper and comic strips, comic books, paperbacks and bestsellers); 2) vaudeville; 3) popular film; 4) recorded popular music; 5) popular story radio; and 6) popular television. This course will seek to draw important social and cultural connections among these expressions of entertainment culture (through an understanding of such concepts as icons, stereotypes, rituals, heroes, narrative formulas, and myth/belief structures), in the process offering an overview of how our American entertainment culture of today (and the near future) has been shaped and defined by earlier forms of popular culture entertainment beginning in the nineteenth century and evolving through the twenty-first century.\n\n4) FLM 820: Topics in Film Studies\n\nMobile Media\n\nKuhu Tanvir\n\nMonday/Wednesday 4:10-7:00/6:00\n\nThere are new innovations in media technologies everyday, and if there is one overarching theme that connects most of the innovation of the last fifteen or twenty years, it is mobility: the ability to have our media to move with us. This course will be a deep dive into the association between media and movement. We will study mobile media as a technological, socio-cultural and political player in the contemporary media landscape. One of the key goals of this course is to consider media and mobility in a global context; in other words, to go beyond the debates that are relevant only to the United States and the rest of the developed world and to engage with media mobility in the Global South. We will approach media mobility from a range of perspectives: infrastructure, network, transmediation, exhibition, production, distribution, and storage, to name a few.\n\nThe course fulfills requirements for the Film Studies certificate and the DH certificate for graduate students.\n\n5) WS 897: Feminist Theory, Epistemology, and Pedagogy\n\n(cross-listed with ENG)\n\nAminda Smith (History)\n\nTuesday 4:10 – 7:00\n\nFor override into course, contact WGS advisor, Patrick Arnold at arnoldp5@msu.edu<\n\nFall 2021\n\n1) Zarena Aslami\n\nENG 800: Studies in Race, Gender, and the Human\n\nTuesday 4:30-7:20pm\n\nTheoretical and historical considerations of the category of the human. Attention to the development of race, ethnicity, gender and their critical intersections in relation to the U.S. and the discipline of the Humanities.\n\nCourse objectives: Understanding the particular forms of inequality rooted in the most brutal forms of radical dehumanization. Introduce students to historical and theoretical understandings of the human and to questions of value, equity, and social justice. Train students to reflect upon the current conditions of knowledge production in the U.S. and the history of the humanities and the university in the context of these issues.\n\nColonialism, Settler Colonialism\n\nAfterlives of Slavery and Indigenous Dispossession\n\nConstruction of Gender and Sex as Science\n\nHistories and Theories of Racialized Gender\n\nDiaspora and Border Studies\n\nEngagement with Ethnic Studies and Disability Studies\n\nHistory of the Humanities Discipline\n\nInterdisciplinary Approaches to the Humanities\n\n2) Robin Silbergleid\n\nENG 814: Literature in English after 1800\n\nTopic: “Personal Essay, Creative Criticism, and Autotheory”\n\nMonday/Wednesday 3-4:20pm\n\nThis class is designed as a hybrid creative writing workshop and seminar on modes of creative nonfiction writing that incorporate elements of “the personal,” including memoir and personal essay, creative literary criticism, and autotheory. Our reading will include a range of personal essays, examples of creative literary criticism, and relevant theoretical and critical work by writers such as Maggie Nelson, Claudia Rankine, Elissa Washuta, Jenny Boully, T. Fleishmann, Leslie Jamison, Cherrie Moraga, Gloria Anzaldua, Audre Lorde, Jane Gallop, Jane Tompkins, and Roland Barthes. Please note this course is designed to be cross-listed with English 423 Advanced Creative Nonfiction writing; as such, it will also offer graduate students the experience of a creative writing course, with regular discussion of writing habits, elements of craft, and student work in progress.\n\n3) Sheila Contreras\n\nENG 819: Special Topics in Language and Literature\n\nTopic: “Borderlands Literature”\n\nTuesday/Thursday 3-4:20pm\n\nHere, we trace the critical contours of Mexican-American/Chicano/Chicana/ Chicanx literary production over time, since the late 1960s. Grounded in a handful of primary texts, course readings will explore the meta-discourses surrounding Chicanx literary history and production, with deep attention to secondary criticism and theory from across the disciplines.\n\nOur main goal will to be to chart the development of, first, Chicano, then Chicana/o, Chican@, and now Chicanx literary production and surrounding discourses. In broad terms, this will happen over several dimensions as we interrogate the governing rhetorics of the folkloric/anthropological and the nationalist (Indigenist and Marxist), which were followed closely and impacted by the interventions of third-world feminist and LGBTQIA+ critical voices. Our approach to the literary texts, historical developments, material contexts, philosophical meditations and political imperatives of Chicanx critical discourses will be decidedly interdisciplinary.\n\nThis course issues from an other side of the US immigration debate, spotlighting perspectives submerged beneath and repressed by forces that fossilize the Mexican presence as irrevocably tied to the experiences and traumas of im/migration.\n\nSelections or full primary texts (tentative/subject to change):\n\nAnzaldúa, Gloria Borderlands/La Frontera\n\nBrown, Ariana, Sana, Sana\n\nMoraga, Cherrie, Loving in the War Years\n\nMuñoz, Manuel, Zigzagger\n\nOrtiz, Amalia, Cancion Cannibal Cabaret\n\nRivera, Tomás, y no se lo tragó la tierra/And the Earth Did not Devour Him\n\nSánchez, Erica, Lessons on Expulsion\n\nValdez, Luis, Los Vendidos\n\nVillanueva, Alma Luz, La Llorona/Weeping Woman and Other Stories\n\nEl Plan de Aztlán\n\nEl Plan de Santa Barbara\n\nCritical/secondary work selections and full texts (tentative and incomplete):\n\nAnaya, Rudolfo, et al, Aztlán: Essays on the Homeland\n\nBlackwell, Maylei, et al, Chicana Movidas\n\nBroyles-Gonzalez, Yvonne, Teatro Campesino\n\nCalderón, Héctor, et al, Criticism in the Borderlands\n\nCastañeda, Antonia, selections\n\nGarcia, Alma, Chicana Feminisms: The Basic Historical Readings\n\nGómez-Quiñones, Juan, Chicano Politics\n\nHall, Stuart, selections\n\nLimón, José, selected readings\n\nMarez, Curtis, Farmworker Futurisms\n\nSandoval, Chela, Methodology of the Oppressed\n\nVargas, Deborah, et al, Keywords in Chicana and Chicano Studies\n\n4) Julian Chambliss\n\nENG 826: Special Topics Seminar\n\nTopic: “Public Digital Humanities: A Praxis Approach”\n\nMonday/Wednesday 3-4:20pm\n\nThis graduate seminar examines the theory and practice of public digital humanities. The course will provide a framework to understand the choices made in interpreting and presenting humanities topics to scholarly and public audiences. We will consider digital humanities definition and practice and explore case studies using projects and individuals to understand how a public digital humanities praxis shapes scholarly discourse.\n\nThis course will have three parts. Part I explores the many publics we serve. Who are they? What relationship do we as scholars have to the public? Part II considers the digital. What structures, practices, and activities comprise the digital, and how do we align it with our teaching, scholarship, and service? Part III will focus on praxis. How can we synthesize a framework of action for digital public humanities? Key to this process will be creating a class book, an open educational resource grounded in examining public digital humanities from the participants’ perspective and exploring community, identity, and ethics questions.\n\nThe point of this course is to build our capacity to understand the benefits and challenges associated with public digital humanities praxis. We are working with culture in the public sphere. Can we do better?\n\n5) Ellen McCallum\n\nENG 826: Special Topics Seminar\n\nTopic: “Queer Theory: A Theirstory”\n\nWednesday 5:00-7:50pm\n\nWith the 1990 publication of Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble, widely seen as a founding text of queer theory, this new field of inquiry may seemed to have come out of nowhere. But of course, many different thinkers and writers and movements had been contributing to a vibrant reconsideration of sexual differences, subjectivity, and sociality. Psychoanalysis, Black feminism, deconstruction, academic feminism, the women’s movement, gay liberation, and the AIDS crisis are among some of the key influences. Without going so far as to assert a linear chronology, this course looks to the prehistory of queer theory, which is to say a sampling of works that appeared in primarily in the 1970s and 1980s. The authors named below do not represent a final list but merely sketch a horizon of possibilities.\n\nWe’ll read acknowledged precursors drawn from writers such as Gayle Rubin, Leo Bersani, Gloria Anzaldua, Audre Lorde, Michel Foucault, and Teresa de Lauretis, as well as consider some whose work is not centered in the queer limelight, such as Guy Hocquenghem, Marilyn Frye, Essex Hemphill, Joseph Beam, Stephen Heath, Monique Wittig. We may sample collaborative sources such as Combahee River Collective and New Narrative practitioners. If there’s time, we’ll look to the moment of queer theory’s coalescence in Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s Epistemology of the Closet and differences 1991 feminist/queer theory special issue.\n\nSpring 2022\n\n1) Kinitra Brooks\n\nENG 802: Literary Criticism and Theory\n\nTopic: “Critical Readings of the Hegemony”\n\nTuesday 4:10-7pm\n\nOne of the major ways in which marginalized folks are pushed out of crucial conversations and methodologies in academia and beyond is through intimidation–often achieved by using what is considered “high” theory or les belles-lettres. In this course, we will familiarize ourselves with those thinkers and influencers of the hegemonic discourse and read them through critical race and gender lenses. It is my hope that you leave this course more confident and surer of your critical positionality–and that you don’t get a feeling of dread or fear every time someone brings up Hegel, Kant, or Foucault.\n\n2) Tamar Boyadjian\n\nENG 813: Studies in Genre and Media\n\nTopic: “Once Upon a Myth… Women in Romance from the Medieval to Pop Culture”\n\nTuesday/Thursday 2:40-4pm\n\nThis course traces the trajectory of the genre of “romance” from the medieval to contemporary film and pop culture, focusing particularly on the representation of women. Readings will include oral and written romances, fairy tales, and fantasy literature, coupled with critical theory around genre, gender and sexuality, queer theory and pop culture.\n\n3) Kathleen Fitzpatrick\n\nENG 818: Studies in Genre and Media\n\nTopic: “Peculiar Genres of Academic Writing”\n\nMonday 4:10-7pm\n\nThe vast majority of writing practice in graduate school is focused on the seminar paper, which serves as a prototype for the journal articles it’s expected you’ll produce across your career. And fair enough! The journal article is an important genre, and one that demands a lot of practice. But some of the most important forms of writing that you’re likely to do in the future, wherever your career path may lead, are all too rarely taught. So we’re going to spend the semester with a number of those forms – including the blog post, the op/ed, the personal statement, and perhaps most importantly the grant proposal – to explore how they work, what they’re asking of you, and how you might approach these and other peculiar genres as part of a wide-ranging writing practice.\n\n4) Joshua Yumibe\n\nFLM 800: Methods in Film Studies\n\nTuesday 12:40-3:30 & Thursday 12:40-2:30\n\nThis course offers an introduction to methods of interpreting, writing on, and teaching film. It is designed to help graduate students to develop a research or teaching trajectory in cinema and media studies for their work at MSU and beyond. Students will begin by engaging with tools of close analysis and basic concepts of film form. They will move from there to categories of genre, authorship and other critical traditions, central to the formation of the discipline of cinema studies, that discuss aspects of the medium as a social institution, psycho-sexual apparatus, and cultural practice. The course will introduce students to subfields of film historiography, industry studies, and of studies of media infrastructures as they pertain to cinema as a medium in global circulation. Screenings will include work by filmmakers such as Burnett, Deren, Eisenstein, Hitchcock, Jia, Kiarostami, Mambéty, Rohrwacher, and Weber.\n\nFall 2020\n\n1) Jyotsna Singh\n\nENG 813: Literature Before 1800\n\nTopic: “Gender, Power, and Violence in Jacobean Tragedy-c. 1580s-1620”\n\nIn this Part I- In this course, we will explore a spectacular period in English drama, when a group of plays known as Jacobean tragedies (including selected plays by Shakespeare) opened up a universe in which sexual and political betrayal combine with incest, insanity, forced marriage and ferocious honour codes, often leading to violence. While drawing large audiences with their titillating representations of early modern society, these plays also offered serious reconsiderations of gender roles within shifting power hierarchies, and especially of the realignments of women’s power and agency within a climate of toxic masculinities. Drawing on early modern gender studies, we will study several representative texts in terms of the cultural and ideological struggles of the period. To reveal the contextual archaeologies of these gendered worlds, we also delve into two ancient masterpieces by the Greek playwrights, Aeschylus and Euripides.\n\nPart II of the course will address a larger presentist question: what is about these violent, baroque, and classical plays that haunt our contemporary imagination? What kind of culture did they spring from? Why are they again filling our theatres today? Do they resonate with the gender politics we can recognize in our times? In addressing these questions, we will examine several contemporary productions that deploy cross-racial and cross-gender casting and thereby enable intersectional analyses of gender, power, and violence.\n\nKey texts: The Duchess of of Malfi, The White Devil (Webster); The Changeling (Middleton and Rowley); ’Tis Pity She’s a Whore (Ford); A Woman Killed with Kindness (Heywood); Women Beware Women (Middleton); The Broken Heart (Ford); and Troilus and Cressida, Measure for Measure, and The Winter’s Tale (Shakespeare); Classical plays: Aeschylus, Agammemnon; Euripides, Iphigenia at Aulis.\n\n2) Robin Silbergleid\n\nENG 814/ENG 423: Literatures in English after 1800\n\nTopic: “The I and the Eye: Writing and Reading Personal Nonfiction”\n\nWhat do we mean when we say “I”? How do writers of personal essay and literary criticism deploy the first person as rhetorical strategy? In what other ways, and in what contexts, do writers and theorists incorporate something we might understand as “the personal” within their scholarship? What are the effects, risks, and privileges associated with this choice? This class will provide a semester-long investigation into the tradition and practice of personal nonfiction; the syllabus will include a range of personal essays, examples of creative literary criticism, and relevant theoretical and critical work by writers such as Maggie Nelson, Claudia Rankine, Eula Biss, Kiese Laymon, John Edgar Wideman, Rebecca Solnit, Cherrie Moraga, Gloria Anzaldua, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Leslie Jamison, Jane Gallop, Jane Tompkins, Nancy K. Miller, and Roland Barthes. Please note this course is designed to be cross-listed with English 423 Advanced Creative Nonfiction writing; as such, it will also offer graduate students the experience of a creative writing course, with regular discussion of student work in progress.\n\n3) Joshua Lam\n\nENG 814/ENG 450: Literatures in English after 1800\n\nTopic: “US Modernism in Black and White”\n\nHow has racial difference been inscribed in the creation and canonization of modernist aesthetics in the US? While race has long been regarded as central to the creation of American modernity, scholars (and editors, publishers, anthologists) have often regarded the modernist aesthetics of canonical figures like Gertrude Stein, T.S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound as distinct from African American literary aesthetics of the same era, including those associated with the Harlem Renaissance and the New Negro movement. This course will examine both canonical and lesser-known texts from “traditional” (ostensibly white) modernism and African American modernism, framed by recent critical attempts to think against or complicate this putative divide. Our historical scope will be broad; we will read literature from the post-Reconstruction era; canonical modernist figures; “New Negro” writers and anthologies; and a number of authors who resist placement in these lineages and milieus. We will also examine scholarly attempts to complicate or challenge the notion that white and black writers created what Michael North calls “two different modernisms.” These include interdisciplinary and historical accounts of “Jim Crow Modernism”; investigations of racial imitation and masquerade; narratives of passing and queer of color critique; and scholarship on sound and recording technologies (e.g., sonic Afro-modernity).\n\nThe seminar will be driven by questions about the coherence and diversity of aesthetic forms; the relation between aesthetic forms and social categories of identity; and their mutual imbrication with material historical conditions (from urbanization and segregation to publishing and print culture). While our primary focus will be the role of race in the formation of modernist aesthetics in the US, we will also attend to how scholars treat race as an analytical category in contemporary literary studies. The seminar is designed to introduce students to the varied aesthetics of literary modernisms, and to help students evaluate frameworks for thinking about race and intersectional identities in US literature. It will engage primarily with the fields of modernist studies, African American literature, and critical race theory.\n\nPossible texts include:\n\nGertrude Stein, Three Lives\n\nW.E.B.

This seminar is concerned with contemporary poetry’s response to two polar categorizations of life– the ordinary and the extraordinary. We will study the ordinary (conventional, established, assumed) and extraordinary (innovated, extreme, hazarded) formal methods poets have recently deployed in order to represent, enact, and witness these categories of existence. We will be preoccupied with the outermost edges— the extremities— of lived experience, be they endotic or exotic, and the poetic practices that query their symbiosis. Thus, we will track contemporary poetic responses to the polar edges of lived experience—the quotidian and the limit event, OR, the everyday and the calamity— to examine how they theorize subjectivity and collective experience. In other words, we will study poetry to understand how the order of things— the ordinary— hinges on that which lies outside the normal course of events.\n\nMy role will be that of a curator. I will bring together a cross-sectional gallery of poetry— broadly defined— selecting across generic, aesthetic, periodic, and national boundaries. The syllabus will not offer a survey of a period, movement, or method. Rather, the texts we examine and live with will show us emerging approaches to the imbrications between the disparate categories of the everyday, the commonplace, the banal, the extreme, the calamity, and finally, the limit event. We will strive to imagine how poetry could offer a holographic bridge to the diachrony of these categories of experience. Readings will consist primarily of post-war and contemporary poetry, selections from critical theory, continental philosophy, interviews and correspondence. *You will track your response to these galleries by keeping a live and ongoing catalogue of the infra-ordinary, witnessing your everyday life, interiority, and your reading experience as they intersect with the extraordinary movements in the political world.\n\nWe will pursue a rigorous amateurism, as a way of moving against the grain of devotional and compulsory professionalism, in order to recuperate the foundational impulses of intellectual activity– pleasure, embodiment, social alignment, and purposeful study of literature beyond the service to arbitrary fields ascribed by institutions. In this, we will pursue the greater project of decolonizing the practice of literary criticism, as theorized by Edward Said. To wit: We will study, create, and converse without “losing sight of the raw effort of constructing either art or knowledge” in order to examine and experience “knowledge and art as choices and decisions, commitments and alignments” and not merely “in terms of impersonal theories or methodologies” (“Professionals and Amateurs”). This goal will be carried out through two specific pedagogical methods: 1. Sustained and continual dialogue (in person and via Zoom) with poets and critics, whose work and criticism we will study; 2. The active rehearsal of innovation in critical methods, exercised through *presentations that pitch your extant skill-sets against the grain of intellectual conformity. Ultimately, we will endeavor to theorize the contemporary as an emergent condition that tethers poetry (as a genre and an institution) to its practice and criticism. *You will demonstrate your investments and contributions to this emergent condition by proposing a substantial critical object, and by completing it through research, peer workshop, and consultancy with me.\n\n* Refers to objects and activities that will be assessed in this seminar.\n\nPrimary Resources\n\n(Either as books/performances, rarely, or more often, as selections)\n\nClifton, Lucille. “4/30/92 for rodney king” from Collected Poems of Lucille Clifton (1991)\n\nConrad, CA.

In many ways it is. And yet many of us strive for connections with other humans and opportunities to share aspects of our lived experiences. This course examines a variety of one-person productions from a range of theater artists who typically write their own scripts including Ty Defoe, Coco Fusco, Spalding Gray, E. Patrick Johnson, Sarah Jones, Lisa Kron, Young Jean Lee, Franca Rame, Anna Deavere Smith, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Doug Wright. In addition to studying specific performances, we will also consider performance as an analytical tool, examining its relationship to everyday life and social practices. These critical interventions will engage with works by both leading and up-and-coming scholars such as Judith Butler, Jill Dolan, Donatella Galella, Fred Moten, Peggy Phelan, Adrienne Rich, Joseph Roach, Richard Schechner, Rebecca Schneider, D. Madison Soyini, and Wu Tsang. Through primary and secondary texts, students will explore and experiment with reading, watching, theorizing, writing, and maybe even performing about the performances of others.\n\n6) Kaveh Askari\n\nFLM 820/FLM 451: Topics in Film Studies\n\nTopic: “Recycled Cinema and Media”\n\n*Satisfies elective for Graduate Certificate in Film Studies\n\nFilms rarely disappear after they leave the theater. They are continually reissued, rediscovered, and remade. This course tracks films with particularly rich and interesting afterlives in the Global South. We will examine three primary ways that film history is reprocessed and remade. First, we will explore how documentary and experimental filmmakers have established an important tradition of critical filmmaking by directly borrowing and reediting found footage. Second, we will consider how the widespread global practice of remaking celebrated films creates another important site where a film’s meaning can be recontextualized. Third, we will follow formations of archival and curatorial practice in different regional contexts as archivist-curators have preserved and presented technological transformations in the history of moving images and have altered the canon of world cinema. Each of these dimensions of recycled cinema have shaped the way that film history has been written, and students will use the case studies in the course to reflect on their own practice of writing cinema and media history.\n\nSpring 2021\n\n1) Yomaira Figueroa\n\nENG 802: Literary Criticism and Theory\n\nTopic: “Race, Gender, and the Human: The Interdisciplinary Study of Human Difference in the U.S.”\n\nTheoretical and historical considerations of the category of the human. Attention to the development of race, ethnicity, gender and their critical intersections in relation to the U.S. and the discipline of the Humanities.\n\nCourse objectives:\n\nUnderstanding the particular forms of inequality rooted in the most brutal forms of radical dehumanization. Introduce students to historical and theoretical understandings of the human and to questions of value, equity, and social justice.

In effect, rather than read Hamlet through a variety of critical lenses, we will “read” the critical contexts through the lens of Hamlet as a touchstone of early modern literature. We will first examine the early texts themselves – the two quartos and the folio version – in order to raise long-standing questions about the early modern publication process, the development of the idea of a literary author, relations between text and performance, the complex task of modern editing of Shakespearean texts, and the idea of textual “authenticity.” We will then look at an array of scholarship on Hamlet, from early- to mid-twentieth century “classics” of criticism, to studies “after theory” including psychoanalytic, feminist, and postmodern approaches, to historicist and materialist criticism considering political, religious and economic “con-texts” for the play, to recent interests in transnational, cognitive, counterfactual, queer and race studies approaches. In conjunction with criticism on Hamlet, we will examine adaptations and works inspired by Hamlet, such as Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Heiner Müller’s Hamletmachine, and Akira Kurosawa’s The Bad Sleep Well, as well as film versions of the play by Laurence Olivier, Grigori Kozintsev, and Michael Almereyda. By the end of the course we will consider the future of early modern literary studies, especially the apparent “return” to theory, and how Hamlet might inform these new critical contexts.\n\nWe will try to arrange viewings of the films outside of class time, and students will do a singular or joint presentation/lead discussion on the film in the following class. Also during the semester students will give two other presentations: one on a book-length study of Hamlet (chosen from the books on reserve listed below), including leading of discussion on the work; and the second on the student’s final essay topic in a “mini-conference” during the final day of class. For final projects students may explore in more depth one of the topics discussed or focus on another category related in some way to Hamlet.\n\n3) Gary Hoppenstand\n\nENG 818/ENG 478B: Studies in Genre and Media\n\nThis class will discuss the various theories of popular fantasy narratives as they apply to fiction and film. Thematically, we will examine the narrative range of fantasy from High Fantasy to Grimdark Fantasy, with an understanding that fantasy employs a narrative genre that explores the “real world” human condition through secondary worlds of imagination.\n\n4) Gordon Henry and Matthew Fletcher (MSU Law School)\n\nENG 826/ENG 437B: Special Topics Seminar\n\nTopic: “Philosophy of Enactment: Federal Indian Law in American Indian Novels and Poetry”\n\nIn “The (Post)colonial Construction of Indian Country: American Indian Literature and Federal Indian Law,” Eric Cheyfitz argues for reading American Indian Literature in the context of Federal Indian Law (and policy.) Therein Cheyfitz writes\n\n“The lack of awareness of the field of federal Indian law is in large part due to the fact that while studies of U.S. Native American oral and written expression to date have alluded to federal policy in Indian matters, they have done so at best in a fragmentary way, and never in a way that argues the intimacy of law and literatures in this field . . . “\n\nFor this course, we will put Cheyfitz’s argument to the test, by exploring how federal Indian law and policy informs key elements of the social, political and structural backdrop of Native literature and by examining ‘the legal conditions” of tribal communities and characters, as represented in American Indian novels and poetry. Primary texts for the course will include, The Surrounded, by Darcy McNickle, House Made of Dawn, by N.Scott Momaday, Heirs of Columbus by Gerald Vizenor, Almanac of the Dead by Leslie Marmon Silko, Ledfeather by Stephen Graham Jones, The Round House, by Louise Erdrich and New Poets of Native Nations, edited by Heid Erdrich. Another primary text, Matthew Fletcher’s, Principles of Federal Indian Law will provide legal and political context for readings in literature. In addition, the course will include supplemental readings dedicated to theories of law as literature and literature as law. Thus, we will draw on essays and book chapters, from the work of Robert Cover, Jacque Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Bruce Duthu, Vine Deloria, Sean Coulthard and Bill Ashcroft to reflect on theories of law and literature as potential ways of expanding how we read and write about American Indian Literature, as contextualized by federal Indian law and policy.\n\n4) Kuhu Tanvir\n\nFLM 810: Seminar in Film Studies\n\nTopic “Digital Dickering: Mediating Popular Culture”\n\nPopular culture media objects–film, television, radio–are not isolated entities, but instead, exist as part of a complex network of media ecologies. Not only is each medium imbricated in transactions with other mediums, but each medium negotiates a web of formats, transfers, and exchange within itself. This course asks students to engage with these media negotiations. The course will cover a wide array of exchanges that occupy a spectrum of legality: including songbooks, celebrity posters, film trailers, bootlegged media and fan-made media objects, to name a few. The goal of the course is to study these networks and exchanges and to evaluate their role in engendering popular media as we understand it.\n\nFall 2019\n\n1) Zarena Aslami\n\nENG 819: Special Topics in Language and Literature\n\nTopic: “Disability Studies: Introductions and Interventions”\n\nMonday, 4:10-7pm\n\nThis seminar introduces graduate students to the interdisciplinary field of disability studies. At its core, disability studies interrogates how a specific idea of the body (in its physical, mental, emotional, psychological, and intellectual capacities) in modern western culture has been taken as the measure of the normal around which physical, conceptual, and political environments have been built. It critiques how the institution of medicine, among others, perceives disability as a deficit or lack that must be cured or eradicated. Across the semester, we will explore the significant interventions that disability studies scholars and disabled writers, artists, and activists have made. In particular, we will track their critique of the exclusive category of man and ableism in its many forms, their reimagining of the human, their foregrounding of the intersections of disability with race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and nationality, and their visions of a socially just world. Questions we may consider: How does thinking about disability revise current critical conversations on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class? What are the limits of critiques that do not take disability into account? Disability studies has also been critiqued for not considering questions of class, race, and sexuality. How do recent scholars address those limits? How does attention to dis/ability revise our interpretations of cultural texts? How does ableism persist in the academy and what strategies can we use to dismantle it? Possible readings include works by Audre Lorde, Tobin Siebers, Eli Clare, Sami Schalk, Therí Alyce Pickens, Alison Kafer, Keah Brown, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, Jasbir Puar, Sunaura Taylor, Robert McRuer, and Alice Wong.\n\n2) Steve Arch\n\nENG 826: Special Topics Seminar\n\nTopic: “Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing”\n\nWednesday, 5-7:50pm\n\nThis course will examine the theory and the practice of editing manuscript and printed materials. Since how one edits a text is a version of how one reads a text, the topics covered will be related to issues of literary interpretation as posed by contemporary reading practices. The course will attend to a practical expertise peculiar to the craft of editing, weaving back and forth between theory (textual criticism) and practice (scholarly editing). We will read and discuss a set of foundational texts that set out the history and rationale for several currently available editorial models (such as documentary editions; Lachmannian stemmatic editions; Greg-Bowers eclectic critical editions; fluid text editions; and socially-based editing). We will examine the new skills and policies demanded by computer-based editions. We will study the composition and publication history of at least one famously problematic text, such as King Lear, Sister Carrie, Frankenstein, or Ulysses. In addition to completing several short writing exercises, each student will identify a text in her research area (or potential research area) – perhaps one from the Special Collections department of the MSU Library – and prepare an edition in accordance with an appropriate editorial method.\n\n3) Tamar Boyadjian\n\nENG 813: Literature in English before 1800\n\nTopic: “England and the “East”: Imagining Europe and the Orient Across Medieval Literature”\n\nThursday, 4:10-7pm\n\nThis course examines the ways in which medieval England views the “east,” and the way the “east” views England, in a number of literary and historiographic works produced in the medieval period. How and in what forms does the “east” present itself in medieval English literature? What is the “east” and who are its people: Saracen, Arab, Muslim, Jew, Mongol, “other”? How do these representations of the “other” simultaneously reflect a perception of England and its people? How do the period of the crusades shift these types of representations? At the same time, how do the people and cultures of the “east” or the Middle East represent England? How might these literary depictions of peoples and places lead to larger conversations regarding moments of intercultural exchange and acculturation in the medieval period?\n\n4) Emery Petchauer\n\nENG 819: Special Topics in Language and Literature\n\nTopic: “Breakbeat Lit: Hip-Hop Generation Sounds and Stories”\n\nTuesday, 4:10-7pm\n\nThe seminar begins with the idea that there is a more-or-less coherent aesthetic system across the narrative, sonic, visual, and bodily expressions of hip hop — an idea proposed by Tricia Rose in her 1994 monograph Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America. These aesthetic forms include flow, layering, rupture, and sampling. In this seminar, we focus on stories told through fiction, poetry, personal narrative, urban stylized lettering, and dance – well beyond rap music – to explore these hip-hop aesthetic forms. Since real people around us today also create hip hop through these practices, this course also engages directly with contemporary hip hop creators in the region and some of their material and sonic practices like beat making.\n\nPrimarily, the seminar engages broad questions about aesthetic forms and how they seem work – often in concert and collision with one another – across a range of related expressions: narrative, sonic, visual, and corporal. Most specifically, the following questions will drive learning in this seminar: What is the relationship between the aesthetic forms of hip-hop arts and the socio-political concerns of the hip-hop generation? What do Black and hip-hop aesthetics afford to life today both on and off the page? What happens when people beyond the cultural origins and originators take up and apply these aesthetics practices? These questions push the seminar to engage with the following fields: African American literature and poetics, popular culture, hip-hop studies and pedagogy, Black and hip hop feminisms, cultural rhetorics, and urban education.\n\nSecondarily, the seminar also engages broad questions around the ethics of archiving/teaching material cultures and oral narratives in formal institutions. These questions – curricular, cultural, and ethical – have accelerated over the past decade as institutions (Cornell, Harvard, William and Mary, etc.) and museums (National Museum of African American History and Culture) have acquired or curated the material collections of hip-hop cultural pioneers. What are the stakes associated with archiving and teaching hip-hop in a university setting? More succinctly, are graduate seminars where hip-hop goes to die? From these questions, graduate students will develop ethical stances about engaging with and teaching popular, folks, and youth cultures in formal academic settings. These stances, I hope, will serve them well within the variety of settings they may serve as scholars and instructors.\n\nUseful ideas about hip hop come from a variety of disciplines (literary studies, ethnomusicology, cultural studies, dance, etc.), cultural creators working entirely outside of academic constraints, and from hip hop itself. Consequently, the readings for this seminar will cut across various disciplines, at time extend outside of academe, yet give students space to bend the learning toward their particular disciplinary homes.\n\nPossible readings, viewings, listenings:\n\nFiction, poetry, essays:\n\nAdam Mansbach, Angry Black/White Boy: A Novel, 2005\n\nWish to Live: The Hip Hop Feminist Pedagogy Reader, 2012\n\nThe Breakbeat Poets: New American Poetry in the Age of Hip Hop, 2015\n\nFlyboy 2: The Greg Tate Reader, 2016\n\nTotal Chaos: The Art and Aesthetics of Hip Hop, 2006\n\nListening\n\nPublic Enemy, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold US Back, 1988.\n\nJ Dilla, Donuts, 2006.\n\nRapsody, Beauty and the Beast, 2014.\n\nKendrick Lamar, DAMN, 2017.\n\nFilms:\n\nStyle Wars, 1983\n\nLa Haine, 1995\n\nCriticism:\n\nFred Moten, In the Break: The Aesthetic of the Black Radical Tradition, 2003\n\nJennifer Lynn Stoever, The Sonic Color Line: Race and the Cultural Politics of Listening, 2016\n\nLoren Kajikawa, Sounding Race in Rap Songs, 2015\n\nCarol Levine, Forms: Whole, Rhythm, Hierarchy, and Network, 2015\n\nHistorical and contextual:\n\nTricia Rose, Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary American, 1994\n\nJeff Chang, Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: A History of the Hip Hop Generation, 2005\n\nJoseph Schloss, Foundation: Bboys, Bgirls, and Hip Hop Culture in New York City, 2009\n\nJoseph Edwoozie, Breakbeats in the Bronx: Rediscovering Hip Hop’s Early Years, 2017\n\nSpring 2020\n\n1) Yomaira Figueroa\n\nENG 802: Literary Criticism and Theory\n\nWednesday, 5-7:50pm\n\nThis seminar will offer an overview on disciplinary formations in the humanities and will focus on three distinct and intersecting areas of study: theories of the human, diaspora studies, and decolonial thought. This course should be of interest to students engaging in transdisciplinary approaches to literary and cultural studies, critical approaches to the study of race, gender, and sexuality, and those interested in epistemologies from below.\n\n2) Scott Michaelsen\n\nENG 818: Studies in Genre and Media\n\nTopic: “Climate Change Knowing (and Unknowing)”\n\nMonday, 4:10-7pm\n\nThe anticipated coming of anthropogenic climate change is turning our world upside down, and it can be hard to get our bearings. We seem to know so little regarding how we got here. The term “anthropocene” entered public discourse less than twenty years ago, but this is not the beginning of the story of our modern relationship to climate. Key geological-climatic works were published in the nineteenth century by figures such as Charles Lyell (Principles of Geology, 1830-33), Louis Agassiz (Studies on Glaciers, 1840), and James Croll (Climate and Time in Their Geological Relations: A Theory of Secular Changes of the Earth’s Climate, 1875), and geological fictions began appearing, such as The Last Man (1805) by Jean-Baptiste Francois Xavier Cousin de Grainville, and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) by Jules Verne. There are literally hundreds of works of climate fiction written between 1805 and our present moment.\n\nThis seminar is designed as an introduction to two worlds: first, the burgeoning field of climate change theorizing, and, second, a few of the key works of climate fiction. Key topics include climate change in relation to questions of geology, ecology, race, class, colonialism, religion, politics, psychology, sex, gender, and sexuality. We will read our literary and theoretical materials in pairs, searching for thematic and historical connections at every turn. Our pairs include:\n\nJules Verne, Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864)\n\nAmitav Ghosh. The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable (2016)\n\nJ.G.

It is designed to help graduate students to develop a research or teaching trajectory in cinema and media studies for their work at MSU and beyond. Students will begin by engaging with tools of close analysis and basic concepts of film form. They will move from there to categories of genre, authorship and other critical traditions, central to the formation of the discipline of cinema studies, that discuss aspects of the medium as a social institution, psycho-sexual apparatus, and cultural practice. The course will introduce students to subfields of film historiography, industry studies, and of studies of media infrastructures as they pertain to cinema as a medium in global circulation. Screenings will include work by Deren, Hondo, Hitchcock, Julien, Lang, Neshat, and Stephan.\n\n4) Kinitra Brooks\n\nENG 826: Special Topics Seminar\n\nTopic: “Conjure Feminism”\n\nTuesday, 4:10-7pm\n\nConjure feminism is a course that will examine conjure and rootwork as intellectual traditions of black women. This course will be an ambitious hybrid of combining multiple elements of theory and praxis. We will theorize the importance of spirit work in the cosmologies of Black Women across the diaspora with particular focus on Womanist Theologies and Traditional African Religious Practices. We will also examine the construct of the Conjure Woman and how it has developed over time. Simultaneously, I would like us to begin to get our hands dirty…in the garden and discovering the practices of the rootworker as much as possible. Finally, I hope all of our work to be presented at BSAM Santiago in Cuba the second week of April as there is a planned travel portion to this course that is possible but has yet to be finalized.\n\nPossible Texts Include:\n\nLiterature:\n\nMama Day by Gloria Naylor\n\nStigmata by Phyllis Alesia Perry\n\nSong of Solomon by Toni Morrison\n\nDestroyer by Victor LaValle\n\nHarrow County by Cullen Bunn\n\nFilms:\n\nWake by Bree Newsome\n\nLemonade by Beyoncé\n\nThe Skeleton Key by Iain Softley\n\nTheory:\n\nBlack Magic: Religion and the African American Conjuring Tradition by Yvonne P.

Films of war have played a central role in both fortifying images of an ascendant nation, united in an aggressive communal cause, and in contesting narratives of nation and historical purpose that have resulted in disasters such as the Vietnam War. In several of the films we will study, the imagery and themes of earlier war films are placed in immediate dialogue with more contemporary ideas and techniques, a case in which the genre memory of past representations is called up and explicitly revised. One such example is the recent remediation of World War I documentary footage by Peter Jackson, They Shall Not Grow Old (2018), in which silent, black and white, scratched and darkened films from the Imperial War Museum collection are renovated through advanced digital tools and techniques. By grafting in color, brightness, and the sounds of the actual past, the meaning of WWI, as it has been widely understood, is effectively changed.\n\nThe seminar will center on films that have played a consequential historical and cultural role, that have become defining cultural touchpoints, and that have provoked controversy and in some cases, a rethinking of the past. Among the films we will study are All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), Apocalypse Now (1979), Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Dunkirk (2017), and Letters From Iwo Jima (2006). As the seminar progresses, we will consider how the language of genre has changed with the “new wars” of the 21st century, marked by the erosion of the distinction between civilians and combatants, by the erasure of the spatial boundaries of the battlezone, and by the emergence of new types of protagonists whose consummate warfare skills are matched by their pathological tendencies.\n\nThe reading for the seminar will be drawn from major works on war and the representation of violence, including Fredric Jameson’s “War and Representation;” Yuval Noah Harari’s The Ultimate Experience; Sarah Cole’s, At The Violet Hour; Derek Gregory’s “The Natures of War;” and Hermann Kappelhoff’s, The Front Lines of Community.\n\nThe screenings may include:\n\nEdison War “Actualities” (1897), Thomas Edison\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930), Lewis Milestone\n\nThey Shall Not Grow Old (2018), Peter Jackson\n\nSaving Private Ryan (1998), Steven Spielberg\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima (2006), Clint Eastwood\n\nDunkirk (2017), Christopher Nolan\n\nApocalypse Now (1979), Francis Coppola\n\nParadise Now (2005), Hany Abu-Assad\n\nWaltz With Bashir (2008), Ari Folman\n\nThe Hurt Locker (2008), Kathryn Bigelow\n\nZero Dark Thirty (2012), Kathryn Bigelow\n\nEye in the Sky (2016), Gavin Hood\n\nA Private War (2018) Matthew Heineman\n\nFall 2018\n\n1) Jyotsna Singh\n\nENG 813: Literature in English before 1800\n\nTopic: “Shakespeare, Race, and Empire”\n\nThursday, 4:10-7pm\n\nWhy did Shakespeare choose Othello, a Moor, a racialized “other,” as the protagonist of one of his classic tragedies? What led the playwright, who had portrayed the conventional negative stereotype of the Moor in Aaron (in Titus Andronicus), to mark a departure from the earlier image in his later play, Othello? Did Shakespeare and his contemporaries have any direct contact with peoples from Africa, with New World “Indians,” with Jews, and with Asian east Indians? Did Prospero’s relationship with Caliban in The Tempest invoke a colonial allegory of Western “discoveries” and dominance over the New World? Why did Shakespeare insert the figures of the “Indian boy” and the Indian “votaress” with evocative associations of “India” in A Midsummer Night’s Dream?” Cumulatively, these questions lead us to consider whether the Shakespearean era was a period of an emergent, western global colonialism and imperialism (which some define as proto-colonialism). Such questions and issues have only increased in relevance and urgency in our contemporary global era, given the growing ideological fault lines of struggles for racial, gender, and social equality.\n\nMapping this historical terrain, we will explore a wide cross-section of Shakespeare’s works, in conjunction with early modern primary texts such as travel writing, and selected criticism and performance histories, while working within the theoretical frameworks of critical race studies and postcolonial theory. Our aim in this course is to understand more fully how Shakespeare staged race and ethnicity, as well as sexual and social relations. In doing so, we will participate in the continuing discussions about whether his works challenged dramatic, cultural, and social conventions of race or participated in the “race thinking” of the early modern period. Finally, with this critical practice, I hope that we can begin to disarticulate associations between the playwright’s works and “whiteness” — a term encompassing the universalizing idea of a timeless Shakespearean canon itself. What can we learn about race and attitudes towards race, in Shakespeare’s time and our own?\n\nSELECTED REQUIRED TEXTS: (This is not a comprehensive list).

In this course, we will begin by focusing on this Decadent literature of the fin de siècle, paying particular attention to the works of Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley, and examine the manner in which this “diseased” literature constituted itself in opposition to Victorian ideals of moral health, responsibility, and progress. We will think about Decadence’s foundational role in the establishment of a queer literary tradition, and we will consider Decadence’s vexed relationship to empire, focusing on works by writers from colonized nations, such as W. B. Yeats and the Caribbean writer M. P. Shiel, who implemented Decadent style in a critique of the imperial project. Some of the most exciting recent work within the field of Decadent studies has foregrounded the manner in which Decadence engenders what Dennis Denisoff refers to as a “queer way of envisioning—or, more precisely, of enacting—a subject’s relationship to the environment.” This work has highlighted the movement’s investment in eco-paganism and the rethinking of the bonds between human and nonhuman animals. With this in mind, we will also play close attention to the Decadent treatment of the natural world and the manner in which this element of the movement might be understood in relationship to its sexual dissidence and its interest in occultism. In the second half of the semester, we will turn to a consideration of the rich afterlife of Decadence during the modernist moment, focusing in particular on camp modernist writers, such as Ronald Firbank, who leaned on Decadence to generate a queer antidote to modernism’s high seriousness, and on Harlem Renaissance writers, such as Richard Bruce Nugent, who turned back to Wilde in order to imagine a queer, black future. We will think about the manner in which Decadent’s global afterlife can be detected in the work of South African illustrators, such as Beresford Egan, and Sri Lankan photographers, such as Lionel Wendt. In the final section of the course, we will consider modernist and avant-garde cinema’s engagement with Decadence and position the films of Alla Nazimova and Kenneth Anger as an extension of the Decadent tradition.\n\nReadings may include:\n\nOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891)\n\nOscar Wilde, Salome (1893)\n\nSelected poems and short stories by W.

This course will examine that global recognition and the celebrated art-house filmmakers who helped to achieve it. It will also explore vital traditions of Iranian filmmaking and film-going often overshadowed by this reputation including the New Wave cinema before the 1979 revolution, midcentury thrillers and musicals, documentary movements, and films of the diaspora. Recurring themes of the course will include the role of cinemas in the modern city, the relation between film and the other arts, the influence of Hollywood and Indian cinema, and the formations of gender identity in different periods in Iranian cinema history. Students with interests in world cinema, postcolonial studies, feminist theory, the relation between media and Islamic religious values, or questions of modernity in the Global South will have opportunities to build upon their knowledge of these topics in their research papers.\n\n4) Lamar Johnson\n\nENG 819: Special Topics in Language and Literature\n\nTopic: “Critical Race English Education”\n\nMonday, 4:10-7pm\n\nThis course illuminates the heightened increase in the racial violence against Black lives and bodies that continues to sweep across the country. In this course, Critical Race English Education: Revolutionizing English classrooms and Literary Studies, we will analyze the interconnection between the physical and symbolic violence that unfolds in Black communities (e.g., churches, neighborhoods, parks, playgrounds, gas stations, etc.) to the physical and symbolic violence that erupts in preK-12 classrooms and higher education courses. As a community of learners, we will examine how English courses and classrooms are dominated by Eurocentric language and literacy practices and ideologies which are acts of violence that constantly remind Black people that their lives, language, culture, race, ethnicity and humanity don’t matter. As such, this course aims to counteract the racial violence that erupts in English classes and within language and literacy studies by providing humanizing pedagogical and curricula practices that reject anti-black racism ideologies pertaining to Black life. In addition, in this course, special emphasis is placed on understanding the ways in which race and racism are situated in the field of English and literary studies and language and literacy studies while simultaneously thinking about transformative ways to make the field of English and literary studies sites for racial justice. In closing, we will explore and unpack readings from language and literacy scholars and activists (e.g., Derrick Bell, Gloria Ladson-Billings, Marcelle Haddix, David Kirkland, Carter G. Woodson, and Angela Davis).\n\n5) Ellen McCallum\n\nENG 826: Special Topics Seminar\n\nTopic: “The Nature of Representing Nature”\n\nWednesday, 4:10-7pm\n\nThis course will investigate how scholars frame nature as locus of humanistic or posthumanistic inquiry. What are the lessons we learn from how nature is represented in sundry discourses, or that nature itself, for instance via scientific inquiry, presses upon our understanding? If science has become the dominant discourse in which nature is understood (perhaps even in contrast to humanities’ dominating culture), how has that epistemic configuration been challenged or capitalized on in recent work? Our consideration will be anchored around Karen Barad’s Meeting the Universe Halfway (quantum physicist bringing the insights of Niels Bohr’s ontology to thinking through deconstruction, feminist and queer theory) with a view towards other feminist/queer thinking on nature • ecology • matter: for example, Catriona McLeod’s Queer Ecologies, Nicole Seymour’s Strange Natures, Mel Y. Chen’s Animacies; Jane Bennet’s Vibrant Matter; Elizabeth Povinelli’s Geontologies, Vicky Kirby’s Quantum Anthropologies. To contextualize this conversation, we will put these texts in conversation with more historical ecology and spatial texts like Aldo Leopold’s Sand County Diaries, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, as well as more recent ecological reconsiderations like Timothy Morton’s Ecology without Nature, Eduardo Kohn’s How Forests Think, Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing’s Mushroom at the End of the World. We will triangulate these two strands by bringing in some systems theory (such as Anthony Wilden’s System and Structure) and/or Bruno Latour’s Actor Network theory or other nonrepresentational theories to contextualize how systems thinking relates to a reconsideration of subjects, and objects, agents and matter.\n\nSpring 2019\n\n1) Yomaira Figueroa\n\nENG 802: Literary Criticism and Theory\n\nThursday, 5-7:50pm\n\nThis seminar will offer an overview on disciplinary formations in the humanities and will focus on three distinct and intersecting areas of study: theories of the human, diaspora studies, and decolonial thought. This course should be of interest to students engaging in transdisciplinary approaches to literary and cultural studies, critical approaches to the study of race/gender/sexuality and those interested in epistemologies from below.\n\n2) Cara Cilano\n\nENG 814: Literature in English after 1800\n\nTopic: “Spatial Studies, Mobility Theory, and Postcolonial Belongings”\n\nThursday, 1:50-4:40pm\n\nThrough a framework informed by critical geography, sociology, cultural studies, and postcolonial theories, students will investigate how literary characters and non-literary actors occupy place and move through space. Our goal is to assess how, when, and why certain identities qualify as ‘proper’ subjects of place, while others are designated/targeted as ‘improper’ not because of the identities themselves but due to the relations that shape them. Locations, gender, race, religion, history (all as lived and imagined), as well as the ubiquitous presence of technology in our daily lives, are of particular interest to our analyses.\n\nReadings may include the following:\n\ntheoretical\n\nTim Cresswell\n\nDoreen Massey\n\nMimi Sheller\n\nJohn Urry\n\nMichel de Certeau\n\nJane Jacobs\n\nHenri Lefebvre\n\nPeter Adey\n\nliterary\n\nThomas King, Truth and Bright Water\n\nMichael Ondaatje, Warlight\n\nSorayya Y.

We will investigate the historical, political, and theoretical development of PCS, chart its development amid related fields like communications, American Studies, and cultural studies, examine some of the critiques that have been and continue to be leveled against it, and show its promise for understanding the new digital environments. Since Popular Culture Studies constitutes the study of particular forms–like television, popular fiction, comic books, and video games–the course will identify key approaches to these forms, including definitions of concepts (like “form,” “genre,” and the “popular”) and exploration of genealogies and archives, remediations and adaptations, and social and cultural contexts. While the course identifies key texts with which to begin, we expect it to be a collaborative one, in which students identify avenues of interest under expert guidance. Professional development in the field will be provided, including an introduction to delivering conference talks and publishing.\n\nRepresentative texts:\n\nJohn Storey, Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, 7th edition, Routledge, 2015.\n\nRobin D.

Particular attention will be paid to cinema’s relation to other color media (photography, mass advertising, painting, stage design) and to theoretical debates in philosophy, art history, and literature over the physiological effects and ideologies of color. The course will also examine the ways in which color technologies circulate transnationally yet are received and interpreted in locally specific ways. Works to be covered may include films from early cinema (Annabelle Dances, The Red Spectre), narrative cinema of the 1920s (The Toll of the Sea, Redskin), Technicolor of the 1930s (Becky Sharp), melodrama and musicals (All that Heaven Allows, The Bandwagon), global art cinemas (Black Narcissus, Daisies, Touki Bouki, The Scent of Green Papaya), experimental film (Harry Smith, Oskar Fischinger, Stan Brakhage), and contemporary works (Days of Heaven, Blue Velvet, Hero, Marie Antoinette).\n\nPotential Readings\n\nRegina Lee Blaszczyk, The Color Revolution (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2012).\n\nDavid Batchelor, Chromophobia (London: Reaktion, 2000).\n\nJonathan Crary, Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the 19th Century, (Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 1992).\n\nRosalind Galt, Pretty: Film and the Decorative Image (New York: Columbia Univ.

This seminar is concerned with contemporary poetry’s response to two polar categorizations of life– the ordinary and the extraordinary. We will study the ordinary (conventional, established, assumed) and extraordinary (innovated, extreme, hazarded) formal methods poets have recently deployed in order to represent, enact, and witness these categories of existence. We will be preoccupied with the outermost edges— the extremities— of lived experience, be they endotic or exotic, and the poetic practices that query their symbiosis. Thus, we will track contemporary poetic responses to the polar edges of lived experience—the quotidian and the limit event, OR, the everyday and the calamity— to examine how they theorize subjectivity and collective experience. In other words, we will study poetry to understand how the order of things— the ordinary— hinges on that which lies outside the normal course of events.\n\nMy role will be that of a curator. I will bring together a cross-sectional gallery of poetry— broadly defined— selecting across generic, aesthetic, periodic, and national boundaries. The syllabus will not offer a survey of a period, movement, or method. Rather, the texts we examine and live with will show us emerging approaches to the imbrications between the disparate categories of the everyday, the commonplace, the banal, the extreme, the calamity, and finally, the limit event. We will strive to imagine how poetry could offer a holographic bridge to the diachrony of these categories of experience. Readings will consist primarily of post-war and contemporary poetry, selections from critical theory, continental philosophy, interviews and correspondence. *You will track your response to these galleries by keeping a live and ongoing catalogue of the infra-ordinary, witnessing your everyday life, interiority, and your reading experience as they intersect with the extraordinary movements in the political world.\n\nWe will pursue a rigorous amateurism, as a way of moving against the grain of devotional and compulsory professionalism, in order to recuperate the foundational impulses of intellectual activity– pleasure, embodiment, social alignment, and purposeful study of literature beyond the service to arbitrary fields ascribed by institutions. In this, we will pursue the greater project of decolonizing the practice of literary criticism, as theorized by Edward Said. To wit: We will study, create, and converse without “losing sight of the raw effort of constructing either art or knowledge” in order to examine and experience “knowledge and art as choices and decisions, commitments and alignments” and not merely “in terms of impersonal theories or methodologies” (“Professionals and Amateurs”). This goal will be carried out through two specific pedagogical methods: 1. Sustained and continual dialogue (in person and via Skype) with poets and critics, whose work and criticism we will study; 2. The active rehearsal of innovation in critical methods, exercised through *presentations that pitch your extant skill-sets against the grain of intellectual conformity. Ultimately, we will endeavor to theorize the contemporary as an emergent condition that tethers poetry (as a genre and an institution) to its practice and criticism. *You will demonstrate your investments and contributions to this emergent condition by proposing a substantial critical object, and by completing it through research, peer workshop, and consultancy with me.\n\n* Refers to objects and activities that will be assessed in this seminar.\n\nA Foreigner Carrying in the Crook of His Arm These Tiny Books: i.e. The Gallery\n\nPrimary Resources\n\n(Either as books/performances, rarely, or more often, as selections)\n\nBäcker, Heimrad. transcript (2010)\n\nBergvall, Caroline. “Ride” (2006)\n\nBernstein, Charles.“My/My/My”from Asylums (1975)\n\nBerrigan, Ted.
