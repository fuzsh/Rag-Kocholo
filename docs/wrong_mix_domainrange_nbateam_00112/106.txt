The Cavaliers have announced that Kyle Korver will miss Thursday’s game against the Pistons with left foot soreness and also confirmed that Andrew Bogut will be out the remainder of the season and playoffs due to his fractured left tibia.

Korver is scheduled to travel with the team during the trip and the Cavaliers will have J.R. Smith along for the trip to potentially fill in Korver’s role. It’s good to see the Cavaliers play it safe with Korver in a season that has been so brutal with regards to injuries.

In an odd note, Tyronn Lue is clearly still battling whatever illness that forced him to miss Monday’s game against the Heat, and is planning on meeting the team in Detroit tomorrow to coach.

On Bogut’s end, the release mentioned that he is “expected to successfully complete his recovery process in advance of training camp for the 2017-18 NBA season,” but I still expect Bogut to be bought out to open up a roster spot.

The road back to being fully healthy has been a bumpy one for the Cavaliers, and good news in J.R.’s return is counteracted by Korver missing games, but on balance, things seem to be trending up, and we should expect to see this team closer to 100 percent sooner rather than later.
