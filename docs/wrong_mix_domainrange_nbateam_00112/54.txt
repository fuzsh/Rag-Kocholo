ATLANTA — Paul Millsap scored 26 points and Kyle Korver added a season-high 22 on Friday night to lead Atlanta to a 105-98 victory over the Detroit Pistons, helping the Hawks forget about the first time these teams met here four weeks ago.

Detroit walloped Atlanta 121-85 on Dec. 2 in Philips Arena, but after Korver made three consecutive free throws to open the second quarter and break a 19-all tie, the Hawks never again trailed nor were even tied.

Dwight Howard had 10 points and 15 rebounds for the Hawks, who have won consecutive games for just the second time since Nov. 15-16 against Miami and Milwaukee, the last two games of their 9-2 start.

Jon Leuer led the Pistons with a career-high 22 points to continue a scoring binge in his fourth start, Reggie Jackson tied his season high with 20, and center Andre Drummond put up his 22nd double-double of the season with 15 points and 15 rebounds.

Detroit has lost seven of eight games, the Pistons’ only win in that span coming Monday over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Atlanta built a 51-41 lead, and it grew the lead to 17 points in the third quarter as Dennis Schroder, Korver and Millsap made 3-pointers.

The Pistons closed the deficit to 74-62 by the end of the third quarter, and made three runs in the fourth.

Jackson’s layup with 4:17 to go shrank Atlanta’s lead to 92-88, but Howard scored seconds later on a one-handed dunk of an alley-oop pass from Schroder. Fouled on the play by Leuer, Howard added the free throw for a seven-point lead.

Detroit came no closer than five points from there.

Korver’s final points came from the free throw line, where he made two of three with 1:02 left in the game for a 101-93 lead.

HOUSTON — James Harden had a triple-double with 30 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists and Houston routed Los Angeles.

Clippers guard Austin Rivers and father/coach Doc Rivers were both ejected in the second quarter as Los Angeles dropped its fifth straight.

It’s the seventh triple-double this season for Harden and his third straight 30-point game. Montrezl Harrell added a career-high 29 points to help Houston win its third in a row.

CELTICS 117, HEAT 114

BOSTON — Isaiah Thomas scored 29 of his career-high 52 points in the fourth quarter, setting a club record for points in a period and leading Boston to a victory over the Miami Heat on Friday night.

Thomas hit six 3-pointers and converted a three-point play in the fourth quarter and broke the franchise record of 24 points in a quarter set by Larry Bird in 1983 and matched by Todd Day in 1995. Thomas also topped his career high of 44 points he scored on Dec. 20 at Memphis.

TIMBERWOLVES 116, BUCKS 99

MINNEAPOLIS — Andrew Wiggins scored 31 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 18 points and 16 rebounds to help Minnesota beat Milwaukee.

Zach LaVine added 24 points and Shabazz Muhammad had 22 points in 18 minutes off the bench for the Wolves. They shot 55.8 percent from the field and hit 13 of 25 3-pointers. LaVine hit 6 of 9 from deep and Giannis Antetokounmpo had 25 points, seven rebounds and five assists for the Bucks, and Jabari Parker scored 20 points. They played the first of at least two games without starting point guard Matthew Dellavedova because of a strained hamstring.

WIZARDS 119, NETS 95

WASHINGTON — Trey Burke scored a season-high 27 points, John Wall had another double-double and Washington beat Brooklyn to win its third straight game and reach .500 for the first time this season.

With fellow guard Bradley Beal out with a sprained ankle, Wall took over with 19 points and 14 assists for his eighth double-double in nine games. Burke was 10 of 12 from the floor, making his first seven shots and scoring 20 points in the first half.

PACERS 111, BULLS 101

INDIANAPOLIS — Paul George scored 11 of his 32 points in the final 4 1/2 minutes to help Indiana beat Chicago to snap four-game losing streak.

George broke a 97-97 tie by making a jumper with 4:07 left, then made three free throws on Indiana’s next possession and a layup with 2:52 left for a 102-99 lead. The Pacers sealed the win with a 9-2 spurt.
