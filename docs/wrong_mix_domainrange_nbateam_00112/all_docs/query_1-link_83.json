        "text": "Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nAccording to Christopher Dempsey of The Denver Post, the Denver Nuggets plan to target Kyle Korver during the upcoming period of free agency. Dempsey continues to say that Korver will be \"at, or near, the top\" of Denver's wish list.\n\nThe Nuggets are nothing short of wise to make Korver their top priority.\n\nKorver may not be a superstar, but he's one of the league's elite three-point shooters. He set an NBA record by shooting 53.6 percent from beyond the arc in 2009-10 and led the league in three-point field goals made in 2004-05.\n\nFor his career, Korver has formulated a slash line of .433/.418/.876.\n\nConveniently, Korver is leading the Atlanta Hawks against the Nuggets on March 4. This will give the Nuggets a chance to evaluate their top target up close and personal.\n\nIf it were up to head coach George Karl, he wouldn't need to play against Korver.\n\n...[Kyle Korver] right now moves without the ball as good as anybody in the NBA, and he will get his opportunity to be the first option in 10-15 minutes of the game that we’re going to have to be responsible and see how he’s shooting it. And then you can’t give them the open three, you can’t give him the ‘oh, what happened’ three. You’ve got to be ready. He’s a big part,” said George Karl.\n\nHigh praise from a legendary coach.\n\nKarl is well-versed in the strengths and weaknesses of every opponent he faces. With that being said, a player doesn't receive such an extraordinarily high level of praise for being average.\n\nKarl knows exactly why Korver is dangerous and how he could improve his team.\n\nThree-Point Shooting\n\nThe Denver Nuggets currently rank 26th in the NBA in three-point field-goal percentage and they're 19th in three-point field goals made per game.\n\nDenver wouldn't just benefit from Korver's presence—they desperately need it.\n\nThe Nuggets have long been one of the most explosive offensive teams in the NBA. They're currently averaging 105.5 points per game and crash the offensive glass at a league-best 13.4 boards per game.\n\nUnfortunately, the Nuggets struggle in the half court due to their inability to convert jump shots.\n\nBy adding Korver, however, the Nuggets would have an elite three-point shooter. Not only can he space the floor, but Korver can also keep defenses honest and prevent interior collapses.\n\nIf it's possible, Korver could also create more offensive rebounding opportunities.\n\nVeteran Leadership\n\nGeorge Karl wasn't the only current Denver Nuggets member to offer up high praise for Korver. Current Nuggets center Kosta Koufos joined Karl in raving about the sharpshooter, praising his on- and off-court presence.\n\nKoufos played with Korver on the Utah Jazz, and it appears as if the former would welcome a reunion.\n\n“He’s an unbelievable shooter, he’s so gifted with that,” Koufos said....“He’s what you think of a professional. He comes in, works hard, he’s very motivational, very positive, a great player. He’s one of the better teammates I’ve ever played with.”\n\nAll of those traits exemplify why Denver needs to make this happen.\n\nThe Nuggets would not only benefit from Korver's shooting ability, but his locker room presence, as well. As a high-character player who commands respect, the veteran would be nothing short of a positive addition.\n\nNearly 10 years in the league and 54 postseason games played counters any argument to suggest otherwise."
