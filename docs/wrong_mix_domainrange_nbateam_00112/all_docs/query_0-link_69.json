        "text": "Hawks guard Kyle Korver scored 24 points on 7 of 10 shooting, including 7 of 9 from 3-point range in Atlanta's 107-99 win over the Bulls Saturday. It was the most 3-pointers Korver has made in a game this season and most since Dec. 18, 2013 when he went 8 of 10 from 3-point range.\n\n\"I think they enjoy sharing the ball. They enjoy playing with each other,\" Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. \"They know that they'll all reap the benefits of it if everybody plays unselfishly.\"\n\nKorver added six rebounds and two assists to his total Saturday. He and the Hawks will look to keep rolling Monday agaionst the Pistons.\n\nMore News\n\nKyle Korver: Joins Nets' staff\n\n08/13/2021 • by RotoWire Staff\n\nBucks' Kyle Korver: Logs 12 minutes\n\n08/29/2020 • by RotoWire Staff\n\nBucks' Kyle Korver: Starting Tuesday\n\n08/12/2020 • by RotoWire Staff\n\nBucks' Kyle Korver: Leads team in scoring\n\n08/11/2020 • by RotoWire Staff\n\nBucks' Kyle Korver: Posts vintage performance\n\n03/10/2020 • by RotoWire Staff\n\nBucks' Kyle Korver: Not listed on injury report\n\n03/06/2020 • by RotoWire Staff"
