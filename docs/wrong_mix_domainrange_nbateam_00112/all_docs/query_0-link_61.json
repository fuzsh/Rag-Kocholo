        "text": "Everyone think Sixers will beat the Pistons? hardly, Iverson has to say he is confident. Otherwise whats the point of showing up? he wants his team-mates to believe they can win. If you go into a series not beleiving that you can win then you have lost the series before It even starts.\n\nAllen Iverson can say all the words he wants and how he is motivated and believes his team can win but the bottom line is there are no upsets in a best of 7 series, You are either the better team or you aren't. Maybe in a best of 5 game series you would find an upset here and there but in a 7 game series, the best teams always win.\n\nFact remains the Pistons are a title contending team who are the defending champions and they are going up against a team that barely finished above 500 this year. The Pistons are the much better team not only talent wise but coaching wise, depth and alot better defending the paint.\n\nAt the start of this series I said Pistons would win in 5 but after watching the Sixers in game 1 where as soon as the Pistons put their foot on the gas, they simply blew them away I wouldn't be surprised If it ends up a sweep. The Sixers had so many things go right for them, Iverson shot the ball well and was everywhere, Webber had the best game of his Sixer career and Sammy D did a great job on the boards and on defense. All this while Billups and Rip Hamilton both didn't add anything to the game. Pistons shut down most of the role players and really If the Pistons stay focused this series should not last too long.\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quote:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">Everyone think Sixers will beat the Pistons? hardly, Iverson has to say he is confident.

What makes you so certain that it's not possible? Just because it never has been done, doesn't mean it can't be done. When you look at the big picture, the 76ers might only get one game, but when you think about it and grant the fact that this team truly believes they can win gives them a chance to win. They arguably have the most heart out of any team in the league, and if they grind things out, they may shock the world.\n\nAnd the thing with Iverson is that when he believes he can do something, he can do it. Yes, you're right it's not ground breaking news that he's confident, cause like you said, he's suppose to be or what?s the point of showing up? However there is a difference from actually saying something and doing it on the court opposed to just saying just to boost your teammate?s confidence up. The way he has expressed his confidence and the way he has stressed it out even before he knew who he was going to face in the first round, this guy is on a mission. And the from what he said last off-season about vowing to be a leader and than backing it up by having the career of his life that just goes to show if he believes he can do something, anything is possible. I just don't see why you can?t give him the benefit of the doubt that he may even though it?s unlikely when you look at the big picture that he can shock the world.\n\n--\n\n<font color=\"Red\">OT</font>: When are the awards being handed out btw (MVP, ROY etc)? I think it's today, but I'm not sure.\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quote:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">It doesnt matter what you know, it's what you can prove.

They are still a one man team and any good numbers Webber gets these days is a bonus. Just because the Sixers believe they can win and play with heart doesn't mean there is a chance at an upset. Most teams in the playoffs play with heart, passion and that belief. It doesn't get them anywhere in reality. Bottom line is heart doesn't win series's or championships. Talent + team-work and heart does. You can't just one one.\n\n<div class=\"quote_poster\">Quote:</div><div class=\"quote_post\">And the thing with Iverson is that when he believes he can do something, he can do it.

He is supposely on a mission every year and does the best he can every year, he just doesn't have the team-mates to do anything shock worthy. If he was on some kind of mission why did the Sixers barely finish with a 500 record? surely If this year was so much different from past years, why did the Sixers have an average record? the answer, there isn't enough consistant players around him, he does everything for that team. There's not much more than he can do.\n\nOne man can not win a series on his own. Tracy Mcgrady will tell you that. I don't see why I should give him the benefit of the doubt when there is no real signs that the Sixers can shock the world, the Pistons are better in every possible way. If the Sixers had some one like Yao Ming next to AI then maybe.\n\nThats not to say Yao is some kind of superstar but Yao is a big man who has alot of talent to breakout and have huge games. Like last night for example. There is no one on the Sixers that I can say that about. Maybe Chris Webber of a couple of years ago but not now.\n\nAnyway as for your questions about the awards, they hand them out soon and on different days. MVP isn't anounced until the 2nd round though.\n\n2005 NBA Playoffs: Game 2, Philadelphia 76ers @ Detroit Pistons 4-26-05\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n@\n\n<font color=\"DarkRed\">Philadelphia 76ers</font>(0-1)<font color=\"blue\">Detroit Pistons</font>(1-0)\n\n<font color=\"blue\">Place:The Palace of Auburn Hills</font>\n\n<font color=\"blue\">Time: 7:30 PM est</font>\n\n<font color=\"blue\">TV:NBA TV</font></div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Last Meeting: Sixers 85,Pistons 106</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\"> Probable Starters\n\n<font size=\"1\">(PG Allen Iverson, SG Andre Iguodala, SF Kyle Korver, PF Chris Webber, C Samuel Dalembert)</font></div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">_________________________________________</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">Probable Satrters\n\n<font size=\"1\">(PG Chauncey , SG Rip Hamiltion, SF TayShaun Prince, PF Rasheed Wallace, C Ben Wallace)</font></div>\n\n<font color=\"DarkRed\">Philadelphia 76ers</font>\n\n<u>Keys to the Game</u>\n\n<ul><font color=\"Red\">Consistency</font>\n\nOn many occasions the 76ers have started games very strong, but seem to get weaker and weaker by the minute after they get off to that good start. We've seen it happen on a Sunday against the Celtics for example, and just recently after pulling out on a 16 point lead on the Pistons the 76ers end up loosing by double digits instead of winning by them. There are many reasons for this, which I will reach to later but the bottom line is the Sixers have to stay consistent throughout the game. If the 76ers could stay consistent on a regular basis, you would be surprised at what they could accomplish. When playing a great team like Detroit you have no choice but to stay consistent or the end result will be similar to what happened the last time the 76ers and the Pistons played. For the 76ers to be consistent they have to play as a team, and learn how to score in the half court offense. Philadelphia?s playing style is a run-n-gun type style but you can't rely on that for 48 minutes. Reason being is because most teams will adjust to that, especially the Detroit Pistons.\n\n[/list]\n\n<ul><font color=\"Red\">Role Players/Bench</font> As many of you know, the 76ers had a 16 point lead in Game One, and were looking good against the Pistons starting five. The Pistons bench was different from the starters though, guys like Antonio Mcdyess and Carlos Aroyyo brought them back into the game. Both were active in the game, but both should be easily handled as well. Mcdyess has to many open jumpers and like most NBA players would, he made them, with that being said we need to contest every shot and make him take shots that he isn't comfortable with. He also got a couple of offensive boards on the Sixers as well, so they need to block him out and not let him be active on the glass. If the 76ers contain the Pistons bench then they will be a lot better off, because they won the game for the Pistons last time.\n\nVice versa, the 76ers have to get some production from their bench. They need guys like Marc Jackson to produce inside and play tough, Aaron Mckie to play hard defense and help run the offense, and guys like Rodney Rogers and John Salmons to make the open jumpers. As for the role player?s part of the keys to the game, the younger starters like Korver and Iguodala need to step up their game. I understand both are new comers in the playoffs but we need both of them to contribute like they have been earlier this season. Without Kyle and Andre the Sixers team lag a part of their success and that hurt them in game once.\n\n[/list]\n\n<ul><font color=\"Red\">Defense Down the Stretch/force turnovers</font>\n\nPhiladelphia did a good job early in the game forcing the Pistons to turnovers and converting them to points. But as the game came on the 76ers were not forcing turnovers, or making defensive stops. As a result guys like Rasheed Wallace and Prince began to come on for the Pistons adding to the lead ever since they were up only two points at the half. Both of them got a few too many open looks, and playing the defending champions you cannot give up uncontested jump shots.[/list]\n\n<div align=\"center\"><u>Key Players</u></div>\n\n<div align=\"center\"> </div>\n\n<font color=\"red\"><div align=\"center\">Sheed Wallace Projected Game Stats: 25 points 8 rebounds 4 assists\n\nAllen Iverson Projected Game Stats: 41 points 2 rebounds 6 assists</div></font>\n\nMy Prediction: The 76ers showed in game one that the Pistons aren't flawless. You can make an argument that if Philly would have kept with it they could have very well pulled off a win in game one. It will be tough to defeat this team no matter what, because the Pistons are the defending champs. But if we want to win, AI is going to have to play huge, he'll have to dominate. I have a feeling AI will bring it tonight. The question is, will The Answer be enough? I think if Allen dominates tonight and they play as a team, the 76ers can pull it off, that does not mean it will happen though.\n\n2005 NBA Playoffs: Game 3: Detroit Pistons @ Philadelphia 76ers\n\n<font color=\"White\">...........</font> <font color=\"White\">..........................</font>\n\n<font color=\"blue\">Detroit Pistons (2-0)</font> @ <font color=\"red\">Philadelphia 76ers (0-2)</font>\n\nTime: 8:00 PM, EST\n\nArena: Wachovia Center\n\nTV: ESPN\n\n____________________\n\n<font color=\"Blue\">DET Leads Series 2-0</font>\n\n____________________\n\n<font color=\"blue\">Detroit Pistons Starting Five</font>\n\n<font size=\"1\"><font color=\"blue\">PG</font> Chauncey Billups\n\n<font color=\"blue\">SG</font> Richard Hamilton\n\n<font color=\"blue\">SF</font> Tayshaun Prince\n\n<font color=\"blue\">PF</font> Rasheed Wallace\n\n<font color=\"blue\">C</font> Ben Wallace</font>\n\n<font size=\"1\">Complete Playoff Roster</font>\n\n<font size=\"1\">Head Coach- Larry Brown</font>\n\n____________________\n\n<font color=\"red\">Philadelphia 76ers Starting Five</font>\n\n<font size=\"1\"><font color=\"Red\">PG</font> Allen Iverson\n\n<font color=\"Red\">SG</font> Andre Iguodala\n\n<font color=\"Red\">SF</font> Kyle Korver\n\n<font color=\"Red\">PF</font> Chris Webber\n\n<font color=\"Red\">C</font> Samuel Dalmbert</font>\n\n<font size=\"1\">Complete Playoff Roster</font>\n\n<font size=\"1\">Head Coach- Jim O'Brien</font>\n\n____________________\n\nPlayoffs Stat Comparisons\n\n<font color=\"White\">...............................</font><font color=\"red\">Philadelphia 76ers</font><font color=\"White\">...................</font><font color=\"blue\">Detroit Pistons</font>\n\nScoring:<font color=\"White\">.....................</font><font size=\"1\">A.

Forget about Iverson and Webber, Dalembert seems to be the only that?s giving them a consistent performance. Coming off two consecutive exceptional games, look for Dalembert to get his way once again playing at home. Ironically with his size and stature you would think he would have a hard time again the Wallace boys, coming into this series, one would think that the Wallace?s would bully him around but that doesn?t seem to be the story, Dalembert is having an exceptional series thus far and from the looks of Game 2 it doesn?t seem as if he is going to slow down. His shot blocking, rebounding and even scoring is the reason why the 76ers aren?t losing by 35-40 points. Dalembert doesn?t usually perform like this and luckily for the 76ers he is, so just think where the 76ers would be without him because the way Sammy is playing is a MAJOR bonus.\n\nProjected Stats: 13 Points , 1 Assists, 15 Rebounds, 1 Steals, 4 Blocks\n\n____________________\n\nKeys To The Game\n\n<font color=\"Red\">Philadelphia 76ers</font>\n\n<ul><font color=\"Red\">Home Crowd</font> Whatever the 76ers do they cannot spot the Pistons. They get a few stops within the game, hold a sizeable lead and then they lose it. Maintaining the energy and intensity has been a big problem for the 76ers in this series. Every positive they have done in this series thus far has been off of energy but yet they just cannot hold on to it. However, that problem may very well be fixed this time around. Playing at home in front of they?re fans, they?re surrounds and the whole nine can boost they?re confidence up which ultimately leads to energy. So if the 76ers can feed off of the home crowd and get running up and down the court, they?re chances at winning this game is fairly well.[/list]\n\n<ul><font color=\"Red\">Force turnovers</font> The 76ers has done a good job at forcing turnovers, so they must make sure they do the same. Again playing at home will give them energy and than forcing turnovers will get them up and down the court in which they are most effective. So before anything can be done, they must get some stops and force some turnovers.[/list]\n\n<ul><font color=\"Red\">Playoffs Are For Superstars </font>?And Iverson knows this very well. He is aware about his disappointing performance in Game 2, so expects him to have a big game or more like the 76ers are going to need him to play big. A 40 point performance could be what the 76ers need. Webber on the other hand just needs to make sure his shots fall down. And getting into the low post wouldn?t help either. Yes, his lift isn?t there but you don?t need lift to draw fouls.[/list]\n\n____________________\n\nPersonal Prediction\n\nThe 76ers will control this game from the get go and never look back.\n\n96-111 76ers"
