        "text": "Speaking at All-Star Weekend in New York, Korver was asked about how he prepares and practices his shot. He explained that being a great shooter is all about finding a repeatable shooting stroke, and then repeating it over and over and over again until it's routine:\n\n\"I think the secret to shooting is finding a shot you can make exactly the same every single time and then do it a whole lot. There's no secret potion to it all. You just gotta find something, however you are, like, whatever feels good to you, but shoot it so you can make it the exact same every single time. The exact same. Like, a little bit off can change a lot. So you focus on trying to make it the exact same, and over time hopefully you become a good shooter.\"\n\nKorver's obsessiveness with perfecting his shot is pretty well chronicled.\n\nHe has a list of 20 checkpoints he works on for his shot. The list includes phrases that help him maintain his correct shooting form, things like, \"up strong,\" \"hold follow-through,\" and \"slight bend at waist.\"\n\nHe also undergoes rigorous offseason training that affects his mentality as much as his physicality. This past summer he ran a 5k underwater while carrying an 85-pound rock with other trainers.\n\nAt 33 years old, Korver is one of the rare players who continues to get better as he ages, and his discipline and attention to detail is certainly part of his historic shooting."
