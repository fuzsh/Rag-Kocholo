        "text": "Already facing a daunting task after losing the first two games at home in the Eastern Conference finals, the Atlanta Hawks were dealt another major blow Saturday when 3-point specialist Kyle Korver was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs because of a severely sprained right ankle.\n\nThe guard was injured in Game 2 while scrambling for a loose ball. Cleveland’s Matthew Dellavedova slammed into the side of Korver’s ankle late in the third quarter of the Cavaliers’ 94-82 victory Friday night.\n\nX-rays at Philips Arena were negative, but a follow-up MRI and exam at Peachtree Orthopaedic Clinic confirmed a severe high-ankle sprain. Korver will be examined by a foot and ankle specialist to determine the best course of treatment, but there is no chance that he will play again this postseason, the team said.\n\n“We will miss him,” Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer said. “It’s very, very difficult for him personally but more so for how much this team has done together, how much he’s been a part of that. He’s a huge part of our leadership, our fabric, our fiber.”\n\nBudenholzer hasn’t decided who will start Game 3 at Cleveland on Sunday night. Kent Bazemore seems the most likely candidate, but he’s also the top backup for small forward DeMarre Carroll, who is dealing with a sprained left knee. The other guards on the roster are little-used Shelvin Mack and John Jenkins.\n\nBudenholzer said Carroll was “still a little sore” but should definitely be able to go in the next game, a must-win for the Hawks if they’re to have any realistic chance of coming back in the best-of-seven series. No NBA team has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit in the playoffs.\n\nIrving aggravated tendinitis during Game 1 and sat out Friday.\n\nCoach David Blatt said Irving’s status for Sunday will be a medical decision and won’t be affected by Cleveland’s seeming stranglehold on the series.\n\n“If he’s able to play, then he’ll play,” Blatt said. “He’s a big part of the team, and this series is not finished. But if he’s not able to play, he won’t. That’s the determining factor.”\n\nThe Cavaliers will once again look to LeBron James to lead the way. He is averaging 30.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.5 assists in the series. But he’s taking nothing for granted.\n\n“We’re just as desperate as we were in Game 1 and Game 2,” he said.\n\nHistory is on his and the Cavaliers’ side. James has been up 2-0 in a series 14 times, and he has closed out all 14."
