        "text": "Kyle Korver went 0-of-5 from three-point range on Wednesday. (Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Sport)\n\nThe sky is falling in Atlanta after the Hawks suffered their 12th loss in 13 games on Wednesday.\n\nAdding to the dreary days: Kyle Korver's record three-point streak came to an end in the loss, too.\n\nAfter connecting on at least one three-pointer in 127 consecutive games, shattering Dana Barros' record of 89, Korver went 0-of-5 from long range in the Hawks' 102-78 loss to the Blazers.\n\n\"I'm a little bummed,'' Korver said, according to the Associated Press. ''The streak was good, it was good while it lasted. Someday I'll look on it and be proud. Not tonight, obviously. This was a tough game all the way around for us.''\n\nKorver finished 1-of-9 overall and totaled just five points. After free-falling down the Eastern Conference standings the past few weeks, the Hawks are now clinging to the No. 8 seed, holding a three-game lead on the Pistons.\n\nGOLLIVER: All-Tank Team: Starting lineup that could lose to Philly\n\nDuring the 127-game run, Korver hit 337 threes. He's shooting a league-leading 47.6 percent from deep on the season, making him a marked man every night, streak or not.\n\n''I was thinking, \"Don't let him touch the ball,''' Blazers guard Wesley Matthews said after helping end Korver's streak. ''I was mad when he did touch it.''\n\nKorver played just 28 minutes as coach Mike Budenholzer rested him because of the lopsided score.\n\n\"We were getting blown out. I never wanted to keep it going like that,'' Korver said. ''If they would've put me back in, I would have gone in, but I wasn't looking to get back in just to keep the streak alive.''\n\nThe NBA's longest three-point streak is now held by Warriors guard Stephen Curry, at 50 games."
