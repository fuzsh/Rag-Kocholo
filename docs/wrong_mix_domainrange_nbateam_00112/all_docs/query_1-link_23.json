        "text": "Korver accumulated averages of 8.6 points (41.6 FG%, 39.7 3P%, 82.2 FT%), 2.3 rebounds, 2.0 threes, 1.2 assists, 0.4 steals and 0.2 blocks in 19.1 minutes across 70 appearances in 2018-19. He has now been limited to a single-digit scoring average in three of the last four seasons. Moreover, this was Korver's first campaign since 2015-16 (and just the fifth time in his 16-year career) that he failed to shoot at least 40.0 percent from beyond the arc. The 38-year-old veteran signed with the Bucks this offseason, reuniting with his former coach in Mike Budenholzer. Reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and company figure to benefit from the consistent offensive spacing provided by Korver. That said, he just posted his lowest minutes average since 2009-10, and there's no guarantee Korver will see an uptick in playing time going forward given his age and the likelihood that the club prioritizes keeping him fresh for the playoffs.\n\nIn his first full season with Cleveland, Korver saw his playing time fall to 21.6 minutes per game, which was his lowest mark since the 2010-11 season. It wasn't exactly a surprise, though, considering his age and placement on an Eastern Conference Finals contender. As has been the case for much of his career, Korver's biggest contribution came as a floor spacer. The veteran wing knocked down 2.2 three-pointers per outing, while sinking 43.6 percent them, which was right on par with his career mark of 43.1 percent. Elsewhere, Korver added 9.2 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.2 assists. Korver's role shouldn't change much ahead of the upcoming campaign, even after the offseason departure of superstar LeBron James. He could see a few more minutes or shot attempts on a per game basis, but Fantasy owners need to remember that Korver is now 37 years old, so the Cavaliers aren't likely going to rely on him for long stretches. Those in deeper leagues can consider Korver if a decent source of three-pointers is needed, but his workload itself and lack of counting stats across the board hurt his value significantly in shallower leagues.\n\nThe opening of the 2016-17 season marked Korver's fifth year in Atlanta, though he ended up playing just 32 games before being traded to Cleveland at the the trade deadline. Korver surprisingly saw his averages increase with the move to a more talented roster, averaging 10.7 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.0 assist across 24.5 minutes in 35 games. He's was relied upon mostly for his ability to stretch the floor as a three-point threat, considering the 36-year-old veteran averaged 2.8 three-pointers with the Cavaliers, while also shooting an impressive 48.5 percent from the three-point line. That earned Korver a three-year, $22 million extension in the offseason. Korver should once again be a key contributor off the bench, though the addition of Jae Crowder in the Kyrie Irving trade could potentially cost Korver some minutes at the small forward spot. That said, Korver should still see a relatively large workload backing up J.R. Smith at shooting guard, so if his playing time does ultimately fall, it won't be by much. It's extremely unrealistic to expect Korver to shoot something similar to the 48.5 percent from deep that he did in his limited time with the Cavaliers last season, so look for him to drop much closer to his career average of 43.1 percent. He'll once again enter the upcoming campaign as one of the league's elite shooters and he should be a decent source of three-pointers in deeper leagues.\n\nKorver's improbable All-Star season in 2014-15 was one of the many reasons why the Hawks set a new franchise record with 60 victories, but his statistical backslide last season may have been just as responsible for the team dropping back down to 48 wins. An extended shooting slump in December and January dampened Korver's overall line, and he was never really able to fully recover, finishing with averages of 9.2 points, 3.3 rebounds, 2.1 rebounds and 2.0 three-pointers in 30.0 minutes per game. A career 42.9 percent shooter from three-point range, Korver dipped under 40 percent for the first time since 2008-09, and while his 39.9 percent mark was still well above average, it was difficult for the Hawks to stomach that sort of decline from a player who doesn't offer much impact on the defensive end. Korver is still one of the game's elite shooters and could very well bounce back and show some more efficiency in 2016-17, but he's now 35 years old and is set to become a free agent next summer. Perhaps in acknowledgement of that fact, the Hawks re-signed swingman Kent Bazemore to a four-year, $70 million contract this offseason and spent first-round draft picks on wings Taurean Prince and DeAndre' Bembry. While neither of the rookies figure to eat into Korver's role in a significant way, the veteran sharpshooter could still see his minutes decline for a third straight season.\n\nIn his 12th season, Korver pumped out 12.1 points on 8.0 field goal attempts per game to go along with 4.1 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 0.7 steals, and 0.6 blocks in 32 minutes per game through 75 regular season contests. Making his first All-Star appearance, the former Creighton star shot a scalding 49 percent from the field, 49 percent from downtown, and 90 percent from the free-throw line, sinking 2.0 three-pointers per game. Korver cooled off during 14 playoff games before sustaining a season-ending injury, averaging 11.1 points on 9.5 field goal attempts, 5.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.4 steals, and 1.1 blocks in 38 minutes per game on 39 percent from the floor, 36 percent from beyond the arc, and 81 percent from the charity stripe. Despite the sad ending, overall it was a spectacular season for the first-time All-Star, and given DeMarre Carroll's departure this offseason, it's possible Korver will have even more responsibility in 2015-16. He has yet to return to basketball activities following offseason right ankle and right elbow surgeries, but the 6-7, 210-pound wing expects to be ready for training camp.\n\nKorver re-established himself as one of the league's top three-point threats last season. Not that there was any real doubt about his abilities. He shot a staggering 47 percent from distance in 2013-14, just a hair off his career shooting percentage of 48, while hitting 2.6 three-pointers per game. In the process, he established a new NBA record by hitting at least one three-pointer in 127 consecutive games, but he's not a one-dimensional chucker. Korver also contributed four rebounds, one steal, and a career-high 2.9 assists per game, while shooting his usual otherworldly 93 percent from the free-throw line. A free agent this summer, Korver opted to re-up with the Hawks for four more seasons and is likely to return to his starting role, but don't be surprised if Korver's minutes – and by extension, his overall numbers - dip a bit. His 34 minutes per game last season established a new career high for his playing time, but this year's Hawks are a lot deeper on the wing than last year's model. New additions like Kent Bazemore and Thabo Sefolosha will give coach Mike Budenholzer the option to rest Korver a bit more this season.\n\nIt's no secret where Korver's value stems from. He averaged 2.6 three pointers per game last season - his best average since the 2004-05 season. He finished second in the Association at 46 percent from downtown, which allowed him to finish fourth with 189 made three-pointers, despite missing eight games. After Stephen Curry, Korver is on that short list of guys who can make the case for being the second best long-range shooter in the world. With only DeMarre Carroll behind him on the depth chart at small forward in Atlanta, he's a good bet to once again approach 30 minutes per game (he averaged 31 mpg last season). Even though 69 percent of his field-goal attempts were from behind the stripe last season, he still posted a solid 46 percent mark from the floor, so he won't hurt your team there. He is a fantastic free-throw shooter (88 percent for his career), but he very rarely gets to the line (1.1 attempts per game last season), so it's not much of a consideration with respect to his fantasy value. The 10.9 points, 4.0 rebounds and 0.9 steals he averaged last season prove that he has something to offer other than his long-range stroke, but evaluating your team's need for three-point shooting during the draft should be the only thing that leads you to scoop up the 32-year-old Creighton product.\n\nKorver is unquestionably one of the elite three-point shooters in the league, averaging at least 1.1 three-pointers per game in each of the last six seasons despite starting a total of only 10 games over that stretch. He is also an excellent free-throw shooter and a better defender than many people think. He will have a chance to earn a starting job and could provide tremendous value from behind the arc if he gets increased playing time this season.\n\nKorver had a very up-and-down season, his first in Chicago. He’s a good source of three-pointers, but he’s unlikely to get enough minutes to be of use in standard leagues. Target him if you’re playing in deeper leagues and need threes.\n\nBelieve it now and read it later: Kyle Korver is a better fantasy player than you're thinking he is. Back in his peak, playing 30-plus minutes per game, he was a legitimate top-100 player even while scoring only 11 or so points per game-almost entirely thanks to his three-point shooting. He's still the same guy on a per-minute basis. The problem has been getting the minutes: Korver averaged only 18.3 of them per game last year. He moved with Carlos Boozer to Chicago this offseason, where he's behind Luol Deng on the small forward depth chart.\n\nAs a three-point specialist, Korver is one of the best in the NBA. In his two years with Utah, he has averaged just under his career averages, shooting three-pointers at a 40 percent clip and scoring 10 points per game. During the off-season, Korver had minor wrist surgery, but that shouldn't prevent him from being used as the designated scorer from the Jazz bench.\n\nKorver came over from Philadelphia and helped the Jazz improve as a threat from 3-point range. He’s a superb perimeter shooter and, when restricted to that role and not asked to do more, can be a very effective player. He played fewer minutes per game in Utah than he did in Philadelphia, but scored just as many points and shot better. The Jazz will continue to use him in a similar fashion this year. And if Matt Harpring’s playing time is reduced, Korver could get more playing time but we also expect C.J. Miles and Morris Almond to pick up any available minutes. He has also been receiving minutes at the SG position.\n\nKorver lost his starting gig last season, but as a sixth man his scoring totals actually increased to a career-high 14.4 points per game. But that’s about the only positive we can draw from last season. Korver’s value to fantasy teams lies almost entirely in his long-range shooting, but his three-point rate has declined steadily over the last three seasons. He hit 1.8 treys per game last season – a nice number, but not the number you’d like from someone with a long-range bomber’s resume. Other negative signs: the selections of Rodney Carney and Thaddeus Young with Philly’s last two lottery picks add more athletic and complete options on the wing, and may squeeze Korver’s playing time further.\n\nKorver ranked ninth in three-pointers made per game last year with 2.2, but his fantasy value doesn’t extend much beyond that. He averaged 11.5 points last year but doesn’t do anything else (3.3 boards, 2.0 assists, 43% FG%) to help a fantasy team. With John Salmons in Sacramento, Korver should be in the mix for the starting small forward spot with the Sixers. If Korver plays starter minutes (averaged 31.3 last year), he could be a good fit if you’re looking for threes in the latter rounds of your draft.\n\nKorver's value is wrapped up almost entirely in his ability to nail the three. He tied Quentin Richardson with 226 treys for tops in the league last year and figures to be camped out by the arc all of this year, as well. Nearly 74% of Korver's shots were threes in 2004-05. He shot just 201 attempts from the field that weren't threes, or roughly 2.5 attempts per game, so it's no wonder his field goal percentage of 41.8% is so close to his rate from downtown, 40.5%. His sweet stroke carries over to the charity stripe, and he can steal better than average, but will hurt you everywhere else. With so much value tied to Korver's three-point shooting, watch new coach Maurice Cheeks' usage in the preseason, as he may not want as much bombing from outside as Jim O'Brien did.\n\nOnly averaged 11 minutes a game last year, but will be leaned upon to shoot the three this year. O'Brien likes the kid and his three point shot, so if he improves defensively he will see more time.\n\nGreat shooter, but will have trouble matching up with NBA threes defensively. Won't see much playing time during his rookie season."
