        "text": "The Utah Jazz have been one of the worst shooting teams in the NBA this season.\n\nIn terms of raw three-point percentage, Only the Atlanta Hawks (31.8 percent) and Oklahoma City Thunder (30.7 percent) have been worse than the Jazz (31.9 percent).\n\nThat being the case, it should come as little surprise that general manager Dennis Lindsey was poking around the NBA trade market for a shooter.\n\nAnd, oh, did he ever get one.\n\nKyle Korver is one of the best shooters the game has ever seen.\n\nIn fact, if you’re just looking at it through a statistical lens, it’d be hard to argue he’s any worse than top 10. So, let’s go ahead and do just that.\n\nAmong the 406 players with at least 1,000 career three-point attempts, Kyle Korver (57.5) is fourth in career Effective Field Goal Percentage, trailing only Steve Novak (60.5), Stephen Curry (58) and Joe Ingles (57.7). Among the 188 with at least 2,000 career attempts, Korver trails only Curry.\n\nFirst off, Joe Ingles also being in that one is pretty nice. Just imagining Donovan Mitchell/Rudy Gobert pick-and-rolls, flanked by Ingles and Korver has me believing in this team’s offensive potential again (please do this, Quin Snyder).\n\nMore directly on point with that stat, that level of efficiency over 16 years in the NBA is astounding. And if we just limit the sample to start in 2012-13 (his first with the Hawks), that eFG% jumps up to 62.1. Meaning, in those seven seasons, an attempt from the field from Korver has been worth an average of 1.24 points.\n\nThe best offense in the NBA over that stretch (not surprisingly, the Golden State Warriors), has scored around 1.12 points per possession and 1.09 per field goal attempt.\n\nKyle Korver is on pace for his 12th season in which he qualified for the three-point percentage leaderboard and shot at least 40 percent from three. Only Steve Nash (13) has more. Stephen Curry and Reggie Miller are tied for third place with 10.\n\nThis is another strong indicator of Korver’s longevity. The magic number for three-point shooters has long been 40 percent, and Korver’s hit that in more years than most players play in total. The average career length for an NBA player is around five years.\n\nKyle Korver has seven seasons in which he qualified for the three-point percentage leaderboard, took at least five threes per game and shot at least 40 percent from three, tied with Stephen Curry for the all-time lead.\n\nKlay Thompson has six such seasons. Ray Allen had five. Reggie Miller, Peja Stojakovic and JJ Redick are tied at four.\n\nThis one gets at volume a little bit. Generally speaking, the more a player increases his volume of shots, the harder it is to maintain efficiency. Korver is one of the absolute best at it. His attempts are down this season (first year under five a game since 2011-12), so it’ll be interesting to see if that ticks up with Utah.\n\nKyle Korver is sixth in NBA history in career three-point percentage at 43.17.\n\nSteve Kerr, Hubert Davis, Stephen Curry, Drazen Petrovic and Jason Kapono are the only players ahead of Korver on this leaderboard. None of them took as many career threes as Korver (though Curry will probably pass him before this season ends).\n\nCurry and Korver each have over 5,000 career attempts. Kerr, Davis, Petrovic and Kapono were all under 2,000.\n\nKyle Korver is 16th in NBA history in career free-throw percentage at 87.98.\n\nOne of the old-school measurements for shooting prowess.\n\nKyle Korver led the NBA in three-point percentage four times, free-throw percentage once and threes made once.\n\nKorver’s three-point percentages in the league-leading seasons were 53.6 percent in 2010, 47.2 percent in 2014, 49.2 percent in 2015 and 45.1 percent in 2017.\n\nKyle Korver is fourth in NBA history in threes made with 2,238.\n\nRay Allen (2,973), Reggie Miller (2,560) and Jason Terry (2,282) are the only players with more made threes. Passing Terry seems to be a foregone conclusion. And if he makes as many threes per game with Utah as he has over the last three seasons, he’ll be within striking distance of Miller by the end of this contract.\n\nKyle Korver’s 53.64 three-point percentage in 2010 is the all-time record for a single season. His 49.22 percent in 2015 ranks 12th. He has six total seasons in the top 100.\n\nKorver’s sustained excellence over nearly two decades of NBA basketball was punctuated by a few truly incredible shooting seasons. The 2015 season that ranks 12th by percentage might actually be more impressive than the record-setting season in 2010. He took over four times as many threes (110, compared to 449) in that 2015 campaign.\n\nOver the course of his career, the average distance on a Kyle Korver field goal attempt has been 20.8 feet.\n\nKorver’s had five seasons where his average shot distance was at least 22 feet, 10 seasons at at least 21 feet and 12 seasons at at least 20 feet. He should provide spacing for the Jazz in a way few players can. When one of the greatest shooters of all time is that far from the hoop so often, you can basically turn a possession into a game of four on four while Korver’s defender chases him around.\n\nKyle Korver has 189 career games with at least four made threes. Stephen Curry (269) and Ray Allen (265) are the only players with more games with at least four threes.\n\nIt’s pretty staggering how many of these games Ray Allen and Stephen Curry had, but they obviously had much bigger roles on offense than Korver throughout their careers. For a specialist to have this many games in which he hit double-digits on nothing but threes is pretty rare. Most of the players at the top of that list were in alpha-type roles.\n\nNBA.com/stats has catch-and-shoot data publicly available back to the 2013-14 season. Over that stretch (six seasons) Kyle Korver’s Effective Field Goal Percentage on catch-and-shoot attempts is 66.3.\n\nThis one’s outrageous. In the 2014-15 season alone, Korver’s eFG% was 71.8.\n\nThat’s Korver’s career shot chart, courtesy of Austin Clemens. I mean, just look at it.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, stats courtesy of NBA.com, Basketball Reference, Cleaning the Glass or ESPN."
