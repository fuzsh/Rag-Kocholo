        "text": "Kyle Korver trade gives Cavaliers another weapon, says Stan Van Gundy\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. - The rich get richer.\n\nOn Saturday, the reigning NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers announced the acquisition of sharp-shooter Kyle Korver from the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThe move was first reported earlier this week, and the Hawks get Mo Williams, Mike Dunleavy and a future first-round pick.\n\nBut the focus is Korver, the career 43% three-point shooter.\n\nWith defenses focused on LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said trying to slow the Cavs becomes even harder.\n\nRelated:\n\nAnd wait until shooting guard J.R. Smith returns from a right thumb injury.\n\n“You’re going to spend a lot of time with them having Kyrie and LeBron out there penetrating and Kevin Love, Channing Frye or either Korver or J.R. Smith on the perimeter,” Van Gundy said.\n\n“It’s not easy to guard.”\n\nThe Cavs (27-8) are pacing the Eastern Conference. The Pistons have two more games remaining against the Cavs (March 9 and March 14).\n\n“It just gives Cleveland another weapon and when you’re playing with a guy like LeBron, who’s probably the best passer in the league, and Kyrie Irving, who draws a lot of attention, they want to put as much shooting out there as they can,” Van Gundy said.\n\nContact Vince Ellis at vellis@freepress.com.
