        "text": "NEW YORK — Chauncey Billups didn’t think he would ever see again anything close to what he had with the Detroit Pistons, that five players would sacrifice individual glory for the sake of team success – and still receive individual accolades.\n\nThat was until he came across the Atlanta Hawks, a superstar-less team that is running away with the best record in the Eastern Conference this season in selfless fashion and became just the eighth team in NBA history to send four players to the all-star game.\n\n“With the salary cap and guys getting paid nowadays and this whole superstar thing – everybody want all the shots – I just don’t know that it could be duplicated. But they’re kind of changing what I thought a little,” said Billups, a five-time all-star who is now an analyst with ESPN. “They’re playing a beautiful basketball and I see a lot of similarities because they’re moving the ball, they care one another. Everyone on the team knows who they are and I think that’s undervalued.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Pistons are the last NBA champion that didn’t have a bonafide superstar at the forefront, with Billups becoming the first Finals MVP without all-star credentials. Billups would eventually receive individual honors after the Pistons’ consistent winning – they made six consecutive trips to the conference Finals and reached the NBA Finals twice – made it impossible to ignore his talents and those of Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace and Ben Wallace. All four made the all-star team in 2006, when the Pistons had a league-best 39-6 record.\n\nFive years later, the Boston Celtics sent Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and Rajon Rondo to the all-star game. That this has occurred three times in the past nine years, and each time in the East, speaks to the dearth of quality teams and the shallow talent pool in the conference compared to the much more competitive West. But like the Pistons, what the Hawks have accomplished is equally impressive since the other six teams with four all-stars also had at least two surefire Hall of Famers.\n\nAl Horford, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver are far from household names but their Hawks team has a better record than those led by LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony. Bryant and Anthony are the highest- and fourth-highest-paid players in the NBA – at $23.5 million and $22.5 million, respectively – but their teams have combined to win 23 games while Horford, Millsap, Teague and Korver earn a combined $35.7 million and have 20 more wins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It is a team sport,” Horford said, “but usually the people that sacrifice the most are the most successful.”\n\nTeams built around one, two or even three superstars aren’t obsolete but tougher to construct, especially since franchise-elevating talents are even harder to come by. Only six of the 28 players selected to the all-star game by fans, coaches or Commissioner Adam Silver entered the league in 2010 or later.\n\nAlso, the current collective bargaining agreement discouraged the creation of super teams by establishing a more punitive luxury tax and providing financial incentives for players to stay with their organizations. The effect that the new television deal — which kicks in after next season — will have on player movement remains to be seen.\n\nAssembling the most talent possible will always be the goal for NBA executives, but how it all comes together on the court might look different than in the past. Having multi-skilled players at every position – especially big men capable of spreading the floor – has become the ideal. An Eastern Conference executive credited the 2008-09 Orlando Magic, which reached the Finals with 6-foot-9 shooters Rashard Lewis and Hedo Turkoglu, as almost “accidental” pioneers of that movement. (Millsap serves that role for the Hawks.) And, fewer teams rely on just one or two guys to provide the bulk of the scoring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Steve Kerr took over the league-leading Golden State Warriors, his primary duty was to make them less about Stephen Curry going one-on-one and more about sharing. The result has been Curry taking the lead in the most valuable player race with a more wide-open offense producing another all-star in Klay Thompson.\n\n“I think the game has been evolving the last few years, into more of a ball movement game,” Kerr said. “I think Phoenix set the stage for that, with Mike D’Antoni and Steve Nash, the pace and the spacing and then Miami and San Antonio really sort of followed that up and played a lot of stretch [power forwards]. And when you can space the floor with your big guys it allows for a lot of cutting and driving lanes. So I think the game is changing.”\n\nThe Hawks and Warriors rank first and second in assists per game and 11 of the top 12 teams are in position to make the playoffs, with Boston – despite trading away Rondo and former leading scorer Jeff Green – only 1½ games out of the eighth spot. The Spurs won a championship by the largest margin in NBA history last June by bludgeoning Miami with ball movement and Tim Duncan believes that the Hawks’ success under Mike Budenholzer, a former San Antonio assistant under Gregg Popovich, is no coincidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“He’s done exactly what Pop would do,” Duncan said of Budenholzer. “He just kind of stayed on him and kept hammering and kept pushing until they started to believe that their system would really work. I think once they bought into that they started winning games, the guys understood that’s the way it should be played. He’s proven you can win that way.”\n\nInspired by the Celtics winning a championship in their first season after bringing together Garnett, Pierce and Allen, Miami created its own big three with James, Wade and Chris Bosh. Bosh believes that what the Heat accomplished the previous four seasons is far more difficult than what the Hawks are doing this season but added that both situations present challenges.\n\n“It’s yet to be written what they’ve done yet,” Bosh said. “They’ve done a fantastic job, but they’ll soon see that when you get to the playoffs, that just builds expectations. You have a good record, you’re expected to do certain thing. And it’s nothing sort of championship for them.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBosh marveled at the Hawks’ balanced attack – Atlanta doesn’t have any players ranking in the top 30 in scoring – but stressed that in the postseason, “You still have to have guys to step up. They do spread the wealth but at the same time, those guys have to play well quite a bit. and you do have to have that collective ego, as well as individually, because if you’re counting on for 16 points a game – which they have like eight guys that’s averaging 16 – they each have to do their job.”\n\nTeague said that hasn’t be a problem. “It’s actually really easy. Any given night, anybody can have a big game. It’s rare that all five guys are having an off night. It’s more common, if you have a star player, maybe one or two star players, they can’t have off nights. Our level is not a 35-point-a-night level. Guys on our team average 17, 16 points, so it’s a consistent level that we can always play at.”\n\nBillups still believes that successful teams can still be built around a superstar, such as Anthony, “but I think there’s going to be some situations like [the Hawks] that happen every now and again that change your theory on that. It is an aberration. It doesn’t happen that much.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eight teams that sent four players to the all-star game:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1962) Elgin Baylor Frank Selvy Jerry West Rudy LaRusso\n\nBoston Celtics (1962) Tom Heinsohn Bill Russell Bob Cousy Sam Jones\n\nBoston Celtics (1975) John Havlicek Dave Cowens Jo Jo White Paul Silas\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers (1983) Julius Erving Moses Malone Maurice Cheeks Andrew Toney\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1998) Kobe Bryant Eddie Jones Shaquille O’Neal Nick Van Exel\n\nDetroit Pistons (2006) Chauncey Billups Richard Hamilton Ben Wallace Rasheed Wallace\n\nBoston Celtics (2011) Ray Allen Kevin Garnett Paul Pierce Rajon Rondo\n\nAtlanta Hawks (2015) Al Horford Kyle Korver Paul Millsap Jeff Teague\n\nMore on NBA All-Star Weekend:\n\nHow John Wall matured into an elite defensive point guard\n\nWall’s dirty little dunking secret: He can’t do it left-handed\n\nWatch Mo’Ne Davis blow by Kevin Hart with a spin move\n\nSteinberg: John Wall, magnet for haters and hot takes\n\nFive ways to fix All-Star Weekend\n\nWall wants Magic Johnson’s all-star game assists record\n\nBlogging the NBA: Wizards Insider | Michael Lee |D.C.
