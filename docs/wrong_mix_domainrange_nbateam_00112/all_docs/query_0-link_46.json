        "text": "Stanley Johnson rocked Detroit style.\n\nWearing nice glasses, the Pistons fourth-year forward looked ready to enjoy Saturday night following the 111-102 victory over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nA bright white jacket and a white shirt accompanied the glasses as he spoke with reporters.\n\nJeans, no socks and stylish kicks completed the look.\n\nIt was reminiscent of Johnson’s introduction to area media when wore a pink suit to announce his arrival to the Pistons organization.\n\nMaybe Detroit swag is a better description.\n\nThe return of Johnson’s swagger is the top thing I like about the Pistons’ last 10 games — a stretch where there was much to like.\n\nWindsor: Dwane Casey has brought winning basketball back to Detroit\n\nThe Pistons have won eight of 10 games, including five straight.\n\nThe Pistons (13-7) sit fourth in the Eastern Conference — 5½ games clear of the ninth-place Washington Wizards so the playoff push is in ideal shape.\n\nThey have feasted on a weak schedule with seven wins over the worst teams in the league.\n\nThe road gets tougher in December.\n\nThe Warriors were the first of a 15-game stretch of facing opponents with a combined .530 winning percentage.\n\nBut if Johnson’s resurgence continues, the Pistons could navigate the rough waters.\n\nThings didn’t start well this season for Johnson.\n\nGiven the starting nod at small forward to start the season, Jackson was benched in favor of Glenn Robinson III after eight games.\n\nAs he has done in the past, Johnson has excelled off the bench.\n\nThe stats are solid: He’s averaging 12.6 points and shooting 46 percent from the field and 34 percent from 3-point range.\n\nHe has a net rating of plus-2.3 after a minus-4.3 rating in the first 10 games.\n\n“When I talked to him, he was all for it,” Pistons first-year coach Dwane Casey said. “No resistance is what it was, but as a coach, I have to do what’s best for our team to help us win.\n\n“It’s helped our team. It’s helped our spacing, it’s helped our defense. It’s helped Stanley because he can get more minutes at different positions and help us in different ways defensively.”\n\nWith most of his minutes coming in lineups without center Andre Drummond, the floor is open for his coast-to-coast drives.\n\n“The ball’s not sticking a lot,” backup point guard Ish Smith said this week. “We’re just kind of flowing so he gets it off the rim, pushes it and he’s creating shots for other guys and he kind of plays with a freedom.\n\n“Everybody on that second unit plays with that freedom, that flow and he’s playing at a very high level right now.”\n\nJohnson’s 3-point shooting percentage for the season has inched up to 31.3 percent – not great, but better than earlier this season.\n\nJohnson’s greatest impact comes at the defensive end.\n\nThe most impressive performance of the 10-game stretch was when he forced five turnovers from Raptors star Kahwi Leonard in the last nine minutes of the thrilling last-second victory at Toronto.\n\nThe resurgence has Casey closing games with Johnson, who typically draws the toughest perimeter assignment on defense.\n\nHis two-way potential was on display against the Warriors when he scored 13 of 19 points in the first half.\n\n“I just know we were playing really hard and we were playing together,” Johnson said. “It really didn’t matter who scored or who got the stops or anything like that.\n\n“I think we did a good job of getting Ish the ball on the run and he’s making a lot of plays for us.”\n\nThe bad: Andre’s case of the yips\n\nDrummond is having an excellent season, averaging 18.6 points and 16.4 rebounds per game.\n\nDespite the excellence of Blake Griffin, Drummond leads the Pistons in win shares according to Basketball-Reference.com.\n\nBut after a 2-for-8 night at the free-throw line against the Warriors, Drummond is in a 4-for-22 slump and down to 47 percent for the season.\n\nTeams have noticed.\n\nThe Warriors were the second team in four games to intentionally foul Drummond in an effort to catch up late.\n\nDrummond is working diligently to shake the woes.\n\nHe took to the floor after a game to practice free throws on the Little Caesars Arena floor.\n\nAnd he’s getting in extra shots after practices.\n\nBut before last season, Drummond was arguably the worst free throw shooter in NBA history.\n\nDespite his improvement to 60.5 percent last season, the issue is something that will likely plague Drummond his entire career.\n\nHe’s not a natural shooter.\n\nThe bad: Korver off the market\n\nThe Pistons are shooting 33 percent from 3-point range, which is 26th in the league.\n\nThey are shooting 35 percent over the last 10 games, which is 17th in the league.\n\nThey are improving. The return of Luke Kennard could help more.\n\nThe Pistons could also look to the trade market.\n\nTwo league sources told the Free Press this week the Pistons are gauging the market for shooters.\n\nWell, duh.\n\nOne shooter is off the market with the Utah Jazz acquiring veteran sharp shooter Kyle Korver from the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nDid the Pistons have interest in the career 46 percent 3-point shooter?\n\nWell, duh.\n\nA league source tells the Free Press that the Cavs wanted a first-round pick from the Pistons for Korver.\n\nThe Cavs received two second-round picks and the expiring contract of swingman Alec Burks from the Jazz.\n\nA first-round pick for a role player was a non-starter for the Pistons, which is smart.\n\nA first-round pick (picks?) would be in play to land a star such as Bradley Beal or Kemba Walker. That would be smart – although the day both players become available it’s tough to see a Pistons package that would win the sweepstakes for either.\n\nThe trade market is still a couple of weeks from heating up so stayed tuned.\n\nBut one avenue for reinforcement appears to be closed.\n\nThe good: Pistons find depth?\n\nThe Pistons are successful for four main reasons.\n\nGriffin.\n\nDrummond’s offensive rebounding.\n\nTheir 3-point defense.\n\nThey don’t commit turnovers.\n\nBut after being carried through the first 10 games by Drummond and Griffin, the supporting staff started to emerge.\n\nOnly one rotation player (Robinson III) has a negative net rating over the last 10 games.\n\nJohnson is surging.\n\nReggie Jackson is playing efficiently.\n\nIt needs to continue.\n\nThe bad: No trust for Robinson?\n\nIn his first start of the season, Robinson scored 16 points in 30 minutes in the overtime loss to the Miami Heat.\n\nBut he hasn’t reached 15 minutes in six straight games, turning into a ceremonial starter.\n\nHe has scored five points in the last four games.\n\nJohnson, Bruce Brown and Langston Galloway are getting crunch time minutes.\n\nThe return of Kennard could limit Robinson’s minutes even more.\n\nIt would appear Robinson’s issues come at the defensive end since Casey is very complimentary of the defensive prowess of the three wings getting key minutes.\n\nIf this continues, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Kennard supplant Robinson in the starting lineup.\n\nThe good: Blake’s impromptu stand-up routine\n\nThe mood was light following the Warriors victory.\n\nGriffin’s efforts to become a professional stand-up comedian are well-documented and reporters were treated to open mic night in the locker room.\n\nThe victim was Brown.\n\nBrown wandered over to the scrum in front of Griffin’s locker.\n\nHe interrupted Griffin, who was answering a question.\n\n“Hold on, I’m not done with this first question,” Griffin said with a grin.\n\nBrown got his question in.\n\n“How would you say Bruce Brown’s swag is? Not today, but overall.”\n\nGriffin sized him up.\n\nAnd he offered this with words dripping with disdain.\n\n“I see pants on. A black cartoon T-shirt with a team-issued jacket. And a supreme satchel.\n\n“That’s classic rookie attire.”\n\nFollow Vince Ellis on Twitter @vincent_ellis56."
