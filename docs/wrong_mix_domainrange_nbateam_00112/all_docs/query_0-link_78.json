        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) Paul Millsap had 23 points and nine rebounds, and the Atlanta Hawks snapped the Detroit Pistons' five-game winning streak with a 112-95 victory Saturday night.\n\nThe Hawks have won 13 of their last 16 and moved a game ahead of Miami atop the Southeast Division. The Pistons remained two games ahead of Chicago for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, since the Bulls lost to Orlando on Saturday.\n\nAndre Drummond had 19 points and 17 rebounds for Detroit, but the Pistons couldn't recover from a poor first quarter. Atlanta never trailed and led by as many as 20 in the fourth.\n\nJeff Teague had 12 points and 12 assists, and Kent Bazemore added 17 points for Atlanta. Tobias Harris scored 21 points for the Pistons.\n\nThe Hawks have scored over 100 points in a season-high eight straight games, but it was their defense that put Detroit in an early hole. The Pistons missed their first seven shots from the field and fell behind 11-2.\n\nIt was 27-15 after one quarter, and although Detroit pulled within eight late in the second, Millsap responded with a three-point play and a 3-pointer in the final 35 seconds to give Atlanta a 56-42 advantage at halftime.\n\nAtlanta led 66-47 in the third after a 3-pointer by Teague. The Pistons cut it to seven late in the period, but the deficit was ultimately too much to overcome, and the Hawks put the game away in the fourth.\n\nDrummond and Atlanta's Dennis Schroder had to be separated during an altercation near the basket with 3:14 left in the third. Schroder was given a foul and Drummond received a technical. During the delay to hand out those punishments, the Chicago-Orlando score was announced, giving the Detroit fans something to cheer about during a tough game.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHawks: Kyle Korver had a four-point play in the second quarter. ... Atlanta had 34 assists.\n\nPistons: Detroit has two games left in a nine-game homestand. The Pistons are 5-2 so far, with both losses coming to Atlanta.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHawks: At Chicago on Monday night.\n\nPistons: Host Oklahoma City on Tuesday night."
