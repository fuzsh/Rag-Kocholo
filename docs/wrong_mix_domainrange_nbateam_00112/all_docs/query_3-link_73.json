        "text": "You may have heard this story before, but if not, here's a reminder: Kyle Korver was once part of a trade involving a copy machine.\n\nThe sharpshooting, 16-year NBA veteran gave a commencement speech Saturday at his alma mater, Creighton University, and he used the story as some motivation for the graduating class.\n\n\"The 51st pick, to the New Jersey Nets,\" Korver began, recounting the day he was drafted in 2003. \"I found out shortly afterwards that I had been traded to Philly. I'm not sure if traded is the right word.\n\n\"I was more or less sold for an undisclosed amount of money. I later found out (the Nets) used that money to pay for the entry fee for their summer league team, and with the leftover money, they bought a copy machine.\"\n\nNo, Korver wasn't joking.\n\n\"But it's OK,\" he continued. \"Because a couple of years ago, that copy machine broke. And I'm still playing.\"\n\nKorver was met with applause from the crowd, and with good reason. He has played for five NBA teams in his career and has earned roughly $80 million from contracts. He was selected an All-Star in 2015, has played in the NBA Finals twice and will go down as one of the best shooters in league history (he's fourth on the all-time three-pointers made list with 2,351)."
