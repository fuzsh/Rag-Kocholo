        "text": "Even with the Jazz winning seven of their last eight games, players understand the NBA is a business always in search of better opportunities — hence, former Jazzman Alec Burks learning he was traded for Kyle Korver ahead of the Jazz’s road contest versus Brooklyn in November. “Sometimes we forget, but this is a business and we saw it with AB (Alec Burks), a guy who was here eight years, and right before a game he was gone, and that’s it,” Rubio recalled. “That hits you. “As a team, it’s hard when a trade happens, especially when you have a team that connected, but I know and understand it’s a business and Kyle (Korver) is helping the team a lot,” he continued. “It was a great move so there’s balance to putting too much commitment to being a friend to somebody. That happens at every work; if they got a better job offer or the boss just decides to cut personnel, that happens. It happens in every business. I understand that this is a game and that’s why we love the game, but at the end of the day it’s a business.”\n\nSince the beginning of the 2014-15 season, when Steve Kerr took over in Oakland and the Warriors took over the NBA, 105 players have attempted at least 1,000 3-point shots. Of that group, Curry ranks first in overall makes and second in efficiency. It’s not fair, my dudes. He shoots more than anyone, and with the exception of the ridiculous Kyle Korver, he sinks them at a higher rate. No player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry, and over the course of the Warriors’ dynasty, he has changed the way the entire league looks at 3-point scoring. Curry’s jumper is so lethal that he has become the most efficient volume scorer on the planet — of the league’s top 20 scorers, nobody has a higher TS% than Curry. Not even Giannis Antetokounmpo, and all he does is dunk it.\n\nDespite being traded from Cleveland to Utah for Alec Burks and two future second-round picks a little over a month ago, the 37-year-old sharpshooter remains appreciative for the little over two seasons he played as a Cavalier. “Some people come back with a chip on their shoulder and feel like they’ve got to give it to the other team but it’s not going to be like that for me,” Korver admitted. “Just a lot of gratitude for the time I had there.”\n\nKyle Korver: Is there anything we regret? I think we overachieved as a group. We squeezed every ounce that we had out of ourselves. We left it all out there for sure. I think everyone was just exhausted by the time the season was over. It was a great season. I just think we didn’t have quite the experience that we would have needed to beat that Miami team to win the championship. Taj Gibson: I remember after we lost in the East finals, I didn’t have to buy a meal. I was eating everywhere free. I was just enjoying Chicago. I was going to Gibson’s like four times a week. I was in there. I still to this day know every waiter. I know the chefs, everything. I was going in there, literally, in shorts and slippers. Like, I was living there.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons’ Zaza Pachulia and Utah Jazz’s Kyle Korver are the other still active members of the 2003 draft class, in addition to the James-Anthony-Wade trio. “I got to keep it going,” James said. “I got to keep it going for the class of ’03, that’s for sure. So I love where I’m at right now, and D-Wade has definitely had a helluva career, obviously. A first-ballot Hall of Famer, a three-time champion and so on and so on. I mean, it speaks for itself. But what he’s done for that franchise and what he’s done for that community since he’s been drafted has been a pretty good story.”"
