        "text": "Two-Step Synthesis of Lithiated MoS2 Films\n\nIn the two-step growth process, lithiated MoS2 films were synthesized in the same manner as undoped MoS2. First, metallic Mo layers (1, 3, 10 nm thick) were deposited on the sapphire wafers. In the second step, the part of the sulfur powder used for sulfurization annealing process was replaced by Li2S. Two concentrations of Li2S corresponding to 20% (0.1 g) and 50% (0.25 g) sulfur substitution were used. An image depicting the films after the lithiation process can be found in the Supplementary Material (Figure S1). Lithium sulfide is a solid compound with a melting point of about 938 °C. For this reason, we used a sulfurization temperature of 800 °C. We revealed that at this temperature and under a sulfur reduction atmosphere, Li2S evaporates, and no traces of the compound remain in the crucible after the reaction. We also conducted tests at lower annealing temperatures (400 and 600 °C); however, the Li2S evaporation rate was significantly reduced. Therefore, we decided to use a temperature of 800 °C for the sulfurization with Li2S.\n\nThe conversion of Mo to MoS2 was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. a,b shows the normalized Raman spectra of the as-prepared films. In all cases, MoS2 was formed, as confirmed by the presence of characteristic E2g1 and A1g peaks. The varying intensities of the E2g1 intensities in the normalized spectra suggest different orientations of the MoS2 layers, especially for the 12 nm thick films and with different nominal Li2S powder concentrations. The crystal structure was examined by XRD measurements in a symmetrical configuration ( c,d). For 4 nm films, a very wide 002 peak of 2H-MoS2, with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of more than 2°, dominated the pattern. The peak broadening is caused by low film thickness. The presence of a single MoS2 peak in the pattern is consistent with the dominant horizontal orientation of the as-prepared films. In contrast, for the case of the thickest films (40 nm), the 002 peak has a very low intensity in the symmetrical scan. We speculate that this can be a consequence of the predominant vertical alignment in the films. Focusing on the 12 nm MoS2 film, the peak intensity of the film prepared with a larger amount of Li is much higher than that prepared with 20% Li2S, due to different MoS2 orientation.\n\nThe in-plane ordering of the lithiated MoS2 layers was determined from φ-scans. We selected the strongest 103 diffraction of the hexagonal MoS2 phase for the analysis. We observed an epitaxial ordering only in the case of the thinnest films using both Li concentrations (see insets in c,d). Six peaks separated by 60° observed in the pattern correspond to the diffractions coming from 6 equivalent planes: (103), (013), (1̅13), (1̅03), (01̅3), and (11̅3) and confirm the hexagonal symmetry of MoS2. The presence of distinct maxima in φ-scans indicates the tendency of the layers to grow epitaxially. This tendency has not been previously observed for undoped films. We hypothesize that the presence of lithium during the sulfurization process promotes the epitaxial growth of horizontally aligned MoS2 films.\n\nThe orientation of lithiated MoS2 films was examined by GIWAXS measurements ( ). As expected, the horizontal alignment was observed for the films prepared from 1 nm thick Mo. For the case of the 3 nm thick initial layer, vertically aligned films grew when a smaller amount of Li2S was used. However, horizontally oriented lithiated MoS2 layers were obtained using a 50% of Li2S powder composition. For the thickest initial Mo layers, vertical alignment was present for the 20% Li2S concentration and mixed vertical and horizontal alignment when a 50% Li2S concentration was used. Thus, the presence of lithium resulted not only in the tendency of the films to grow epitaxially, but it also favored horizontal alignment of the lithiated MoS2 films.\n\nAlthough the MoS2 films were prepared from sputtered Mo layers, Mo can easily oxidize in air. Therefore, the initial layer is composed of both Mo and MoOx.52,53 In some cases, the sulfurization of molybdenum oxide results in the horizontally aligned phase rather than the vertical one. Hutár et al.54 studied the influence of the oxidation level of the initial Mo layer on the orientation of the final MoS2 films. In this case, vertically aligned MoS2 was formed from the Mo layer stored in the air. Horizontal MoS2 growth occurred only when the Mo layer was subjected to targeted ozone exposure. To eliminate the potential influence of natural oxidation, we ensured that the pre-deposited Mo layers were exposed to air for an equal duration for both MoS2 and Li-MoS2.\n\nChemical Composition Analyses\n\nConfirmation of the presence of lithium as well as the chemical composition of the layers was identified by a combination of synchrotron-based soft X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, and elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA). Both XPS and ERDA composition analyses resulted in a S:Mo atomic ratio close to 2 and confirmed the presence of lithium for all samples. shows Li 1s and Mo 4s XPS core-level spectra taken from the Li-MoS2 samples prepared by two and three-step methods (Mo 3d and S 2p XPS spectra can be found in the Supplementary Material, Figures S4 and S5). The Li 1s peaks for the 4 and 12 nm Li-MoS2 samples were centered at 55.8 ± 0.1 eV, while the Li 1s peak of 40 nm Li-MoS2 is shifted to 56.4 ± 0.2 eV. The binding energy of 55.8 eV can be attributed to Li-intercalated MoS2.44 However, the literature shows a significant variation in the reported binding energy values for a specific phases, and several different phases exhibit nearly identical binding energies.55 Thus, the chemical phase assignment based on the Li 1s binding energy should be done with caution. However, our assignment of the Li 1s peak to lithiated MoS2 is supported by Li K-edge XANES spectroscopy, as discussed in the following. On the other hand, the observed shift of the Li 1s peak toward higher binding energies for the 40 nm MoS2 film suggests the presence of a different chemical phase. Through the utilization of XPS depth profiling, wherein XPS signals were collected by varying the excitation energy (refer to Supplementary Material, Table S1), we found that the shifted Li 1s component is limited to the top surface of MoS2, indicating the formation of a thin layer of a different Li-based compound. The presence of −SO42– anions, which appeared in the S 2p spectra (Figure S4) of 40 nm thick MoS2 films, indicates that the main compound on the surface is likely Li2SO4.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that Li K-edge XANES spectra are distinct for various lithium compounds, with specific energy positions and line shapes, that serve as unique fingerprints for identifying phase composition.56−59 shows the Li K-edge spectra collected on the 4 and 40 nm thick Li-MoS2 films grown starting from 1 and 10 nm Mo layers. The thinner film exhibits a Li K-edge spectrum which has not been reported in the literature previously. Phases such as Li2S, LiOH, Li2CO3, and Li oxides can be excluded as they would exhibit certain distinct features that are not present in the observed spectrum. Thus, we ascribe the Li K-edge shape obtained from 4 nm thick Li-MoS2 film to the lithiated MoS2. The Li K-edge spectrum recorded for the 40 nm thick film is quite different, although weak features of Li-MoS2 in the energy range from 55 to 58 eV are still visible. The dominant features between 60 and 70 eV are attributed to Li2SO429 being the main phase on the surface. However, after removing the topmost surface layers, 40 nm Li-MoS2 exhibited a Li K-edge spectrum that is nearly identical to the one obtained for the thinner film. This suggests that the thicker MoS2 films were lithiated in a similar manner to the thin ones.\n\nTo support our assignment of the measured Li K-edge XANES spectra to Li-MoS2, we have explored the electronic structure of the unoccupied states of Li-doped MoS2 theoretically ( ). Since none of the experimental techniques we used showed any evidence of the 1T′-MoS2 allotrope, only the hexagonal 2H-MoS2 host lattice is considered in our simulations. The layered structure of MoS2, in which the S–Mo–S triple layers interact by weak van der Waals bonds, allows easy intercalation of Li atoms. The intercalation sites between the sulfur atoms in the van der Waals gap can have either octahedral or tetrahedral coordination. The corresponding simulated Li K-edge spectra are presented in . The calculated spectra for Li atoms in both interstitial sites reproduce the main experimental features, the primary edge above 57 eV as well as the pre-edge region around 55 eV. A slightly better agreement with the measured spectrum can be seen in the spectrum calculated for Li atoms in the tetrahedral sites. The Li K-edge shape is dominated by the dipole allowed excitation of the Li 1s core level electrons to Li 2p unoccupied states. The calculated orbital-projected densities of states (lDOS), plotted in , show that the pre-edge features in the Li K-edge spectrum originate from the unoccupied Li 2p state hybridized with mixed Mo-S states near the bottom of the conduction band, whereas the region between 57 and 63 eV is dominated by unoccupied Li 2p/2s states which are partially mixed with S 3p.\n\nWe have also performed calculations for hypothetical substitutionally doped 2H-MoS2 with Li on Mo sites and with Li near a single sulfur vacancy. The simulated spectrum for the model with sulfur vacancy showed good agreement with the experimental spectrum. Note that the Li atom migrated rather deep inside the van der Waals gap after the structure relaxation. Similar to the intercalation Li-MoS2 compound, the primary edge reflects the unoccupied Li 2p state, whereas the pre-edge region corresponds to Li 2p strongly hybridized with S 3p–Mo 4d states. In summary, the theoretical calculations confirmed that the distinct Li K-edge spectral shape observed on Li-doped MoS2 prepared in this study corresponds mainly to LixMoS2 intercalates.\n\nNext, we examine the amount of Li incorporated in MoS2. The Li molar fraction can be estimated by XPS from the Mo 4s and Li 1s intensity ratio. However, in order to keep the photoemission sensitivity to Li 1s sufficiently high, photon energies below 600 eV were used. The probing depth for such low energies is less than 4 nm for MoS2. Therefore, the Li concentration was also examined by ERDA, which provided us with information on the elemental composition from the whole volume of the thin films prepared here. Table 1 shows the Li:Mo ratios calculated from ERDA measurements compared with the results obtained from XPS.\n\nTable 1\n\nlayer thicknessLi2S amount (%)two-step synthesisthree-step synthesisx (LixMoS2)x (LixMoS2)ERDAXPSERDAXPS4 nm MoS2200.150.11 ± 0.040.140.13 ± 0.0212 nm MoS2200.040.3 ± 0.10.630.17 ± 0.0540 nm MoS2200.05n/aa0.06n/aa4 nm MoS2500.270.10 ± 0.032.200.10 ± 0.0112 nm MoS2500.080.41 ± 0.060.440.10 ± 0.0540 nm MoS2500.02n/aa0.02n/aa\n\nFor the thinnest films (4 nm Li-MoS2) prepared with 20% Li2S, the lithium content determined from XPS and ERDA was very similar for both routes. On the other hand, the lithium concentrations obtained by the two techniques differ for the other samples. We ascribe these differences to the presence of an uneven Li depth distribution in the grown layers. The 4 nm thick films prepared with a higher fraction of Li2S contained larger amounts of lithium inside the film according to the ERDA results. This indicates that lithium is concentrated close to the substrate and thus is not detectable by XPS. Similar results were obtained for 12 nm Li-MoS2 prepared by the three-step route. These films had horizontal alignment with epitaxial ordering. We assume that such a structure facilitates lithium storage inside MoS2 films. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a lithium-rich interface was formed between the MoS2 and the sapphire substrate. On the contrary, the 12 nm Li-MoS2 films synthesized in two-steps exhibited less lithium in the bulk and higher concentrations in the near surface regions. The reason for the reversed concentration profile could be a different Li2S decomposition ratio and diffusion coefficient of Li in MoS2 and on metallic Mo. For the thickest films (40 nm MoS2), we also observed that most of the Li was concentrated on the surface. All thick films had a dominantly vertical alignment. We speculate that the intercalated Li is thus more accessible to gas molecules, and Li segregated to the surface upon interaction with residual oxygen in the CVD chamber or after the air exposure. It is worth noting that while the Li 1s XPS spectra of the 40 nm Li-MoS2 samples taken after a long air exposure were significantly altered, those of the 4 and 12 nm Li-MoS2 exhibited minor or no changes (see Supplementary Material, Figure S6). This finding supports the presence of reactive lithium species on the surface of the 40 nm thick sample.\n\nshows the as-measured transmittance and reflectance spectra of 12 nm and 40 nm thick lithiated MoS2 layers prepared by a two-step method with 20% ( a) and 50% ( b) portion of Li on a transparent sapphire substrate. The spectra were measured from the thin film side of the sample (i.e., the light beam hits the thin layer first and then the substrate).60 The latter is ∼13.6% if the sapphire refractive index of 1.7 is considered. For the thinner samples, the reflectance and transmittance sum up to nearly 100% in the lowest energy part of the spectrum below ∼1.2 eV. The absorbance is negligible in that range and so is the extinction coefficient of the MoS2 layer. In such a case, it can be shown that the reflectance of the sample converges to the sapphire substrate reflectance in the limit ν → 0.61 If we take into account the sapphire refractive index n3 = 1.7, the latter amounts to approximately 14%.\n\nAbove ∼1.7 eV, the absorption of the MoS2 layer sets in, visible in the spectrum as a decrease in the sample’s transmittance. Two excitonic peaks can be seen in the reflectance and transmittance spectra as weak features at around 1.9 eV. At even higher energies, the spectra’s shape is given by the dispersion of the MoS2 complex refractive index, which reflects the electronic band structure of MoS2.\n\nThe existence of a feature below 1.7 eV that manifests itself as a broad maximum (in reflectance) and minimum (in transmittance) makes the spectra of the thicker samples significantly different from those of thinner ones. Even though the layer absorption is undoubtedly not negligible in this range, the feature is due to a thin film interference from the MoS2 layer. The reflectance at the maximum is given by (n22 – n3)2/(n22 + n3)2.61 Taking the values of 0.43 and 0.49 for the reflectance, we get n2 = 2.86 and 3.10 for the sample with 20% Li2S and 50% Li2S, respectively. The position of the reflectance maxima can be calculated from 1/4n2d, giving the values in the range of 2.5–2.7 eV, much higher than those observed. On the other hand, the maxima are asymmetric, with their high-frequency parts cut off as the layers begin to absorb significantly. This shifts the maxima′s positions to lower energy and reduces their amplitudes. Therefore, the real refractive index of the two samples is expected to have larger values than those calculated above.62−64 The strong layer absorption also suppresses thin-film interference maxima and minima in the visible and UV spectral ranges.\n\nThe position and the intensity of the excitonic peaks at 1.9–2.0 eV are sensitive to high levels of Li doping.65,66 However, the optical spectra in do not show any substantial changes compared to undoped MoS2, indicating that our samples are still in the low doping regime."
