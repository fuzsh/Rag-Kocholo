Research shows that the number of related accidents in households across the globe have more than quadrupled since 2002.\n\nLeft untreated, an ingested Lithium Coin battery can get stuck in the oesophagus causing a harmful chemical reaction which can become fatal in as little as two hours. That’s why Duracell and the European Academy of Paediatrics are reaching out to parents, paediatrics and caregivers about the dangers of Lithium Coin battery ingestion and how to prevent it.\n\n*Applied on 2032, 2025 and 2016 batteries. Those batteries have a diameter of 20mm, which is similar to the size of a child’s oesophagus. If swallowed, they are linked to major effects vs. smaller batteries.\n\nHow can this be prevented?\n\nDuracell’s latest innovation\n\nBaby secure\n\ntechnology\n\nDuracell’s latest innovation\n\nBaby secure\n\ntechnology\n\nThe battery has a ring-shaped layer which has a bad taste to discourage swallowing from babies and toddlers. We are using Bitrex®, the bitterest substance in the world commonly used in household products to prevent ingestion. The bitter taste layer on the Duracell cell is non-toxic and completely harmless if consumed. Find out more on bitrex.com.\n\n*Applied on 2032, 2025 and 2016 batteries.

That’s why more and more devices are powered by lithium coins. However, those batteries can be a hazard for small children.\n\nEvery year hundreds of children accidentally ingested lithium coin batteries. If swallowed, a lithium coin battery can get lodged in a child’s oesophagus and cause serious harm in as little as two hours.\n\nFollow these 5 steps\n\nF\n\nFind out which devices in your home contain lithium coin batteries (specifically 2032, 2016 and 2025 sizes) and store those devices away and out of reach of children.\n\nI\n\nInspect the devices for any that don't have screw on compartments and seal them with tape.\n\nR\n\nRemove expired batteries and place them away safely and out of reach of children until you can recycle them properly.\n\nS\n\nSelect lithium coin products with safety features that reduce the risk of accidental ingestion, like the Duracell Child Safety Pack that can be only opened by an adult using a pair of scissors, or the Duracell bitter taste ring-shaped layer that can discourage swallowing form babies and toddlers.\n\nT\n\nTeam up with friends and family to spread this information and keep children safe.\n\nOther\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nLooking for more information and additional tips?\n\nIf your child swallows a battery, go to the emergency room.\n\nIf you have other questions or concerns, call +44 (0) 844 892 0111 or send an email to nirdic.nirdic@belfasttrust.hscni.net.\n\nWant to learn about batteries for the B2B market?\n\nIf you want to find out more about Procell, the professional brand of the Duracell company, click continue to Procell.
