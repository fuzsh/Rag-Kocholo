When the baggage is to be checked in, the lithium battery must be removed and carried in the cabin as a carry-on item.\n\nMore information about the Smart Baggage with Integrated Lithium Batteries and/or Electronics (pdf).\n\nSmall lithium battery-powered vehicles\n\nIATA issued a notice on the classification of small lithium battery-powered vehicles when shipped as cargo and the provisions that apply, specifically the wording of Special Provision A214. Devices such as balance wheels, air wheels, solo wheels, mini balance boards and hoverboards, are classified as UN 3171, battery-powered vehicles. See the Cargo Provisions: Small Vehicle Powered by Lithium Batteries (pdf)\n\nGuidance material\n\nTo assist shippers in understanding the complete requirements related to the transport of lithium batteries, including packing instructions, IATA has prepared the updated Lithium Battery Guidance Document (pdf). This 2024 guidance document includes updated and additional FAQs for shippers to learn how to comply with the 65th Edition of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) on definitions, classifications, exceptions, and prohibitions.\n\nThe guidance document on the carriage of battery-powered cargo tracking devices and data-loggers has been revised to include reference to EASA guidance and the revised FAA advisory circular as well as to incorporate revisions to the 62nd edition (2021) of the IATA DGR. The guidance document has been further revised following the adoption of an exception from the application of the lithium battery mark on packages containing COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe guidance document also provides information to manufacturers of these active devices, users of the active devices and operators that must approve the carriage of active devices in cargo.\n\nDownload the Guidance Document â€“ Battery Powered Cargo Tracking Devices / Data Loggers (pdf)\n\nRaising awareness"
