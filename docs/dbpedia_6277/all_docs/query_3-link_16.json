        "text": "1 SEI film formation mechanism\n\n1.1 SEI film growth process\n\nThe solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film in lithium-ion batteries is a thin film generated by electrolyte decomposition and reaction. The formation process of the SEI film can be divided into two main stages: the in-situ formation stage and the subsequent reconstruction stage.\n\nIn-situ formation stage: When the lithium-ion battery is first charged, the solvent and salt in the electrolyte react with the reduction product on the electrode surface to generate a series of organic and inorganic compounds. These compounds will aggregate on the electrode surface to form an initial SEI film. In this stage, lithium ions are transferred from the electrolyte to the electrode to form metallic lithium or metal alloys.\n\nSubsequent reconstruction stage: In the early stage of SEI film formation, it has high resistance and low ion conductivity, so the decomposition of the electrolyte continues. With the further transfer and reaction of lithium ions, the SEI film is gradually reconstructed to form a more stable structure with higher ion conductivity. In this process, organic compounds can be oxidized into carbonates, polymers and oxides, and inorganic salts can form stable precipitation with lithium ions.\n\n1.2 Degradation of SEI membrane\n\nAlthough the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) membrane plays a key protective role in lithium-ion batteries, the SEI membrane will degrade with the cycle of battery use, resulting in a decrease in battery performance. The degradation of the SEI membrane is a complex process affected by many factors. The organic solvent in the electrolyte solvent will undergo electrolyte decomposition reaction to produce oxides and reduction products. These decomposition products react with the components in the SEI membrane, resulting in membrane degradation and increased resistance. The decomposition products of the electrolyte solvent can chemically react with the organic and inorganic components in the SEI membrane, resulting in membrane structural destruction and blockage of ion conduction channels. Especially under high voltage and high temperature conditions, the decomposition reaction of the electrolyte solvent is more intense, which accelerates the degradation process of the SEI membrane.\n\nSome electrolyte salts decompose under high voltage conditions, producing harmful chemicals that can react with components in the SEI membrane, further exacerbating membrane degradation. For example, the decomposition products of some lithium salts, such as fluorides and sulfates, are highly reactive and can react with organic and inorganic components in the SEI membrane, leading to membrane destruction and loss of ion conduction channels. In addition, some organic salts and additives may also decompose into harmful byproducts, which have a negative impact on the stability of the SEI membrane.\n\nMetallic lithium or metal alloys on the electrode surface may corrode, peel off, or reprecipitate. These changes can destroy the integrity and stability of the SEI membrane. For example, during the charge and discharge process, lithium dendrites may form on the surface of lithium metal, leading to the rupture and inhomogeneity of the SEI membrane. In addition, oxidation and precipitation reactions on the surface of lithium metal may also lead to degradation of the SEI membrane and blockage of lithium ion transmission channels. Finally, environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and oxygen concentration can also affect the stability of the SEI membrane. High temperature and humidity may cause volatilization of electrolytes and evaporation of solvents, which in turn affect the stability of the SEI membrane. The presence of oxygen can trigger the oxidation reaction of the electrolyte, leading to the destruction and degradation of the SEI film.\n\n1.3 Components of the SEI film\n\nThe SEI film is a composite structure composed of a variety of organic and inorganic compounds. Among them, the organic components include the decomposition products of the electrolyte solvent, the reduction products of the lithium salt and the polymer additives. The inorganic components include oxides, carbonates, lithium salt precipitates, etc. The electrolyte solvent will undergo decomposition reactions during the charge and discharge process of the battery to produce a variety of organic substances. These organic products mainly include carbonates, carbonates, polycarbonates and polymers. These organic substances form the skeleton structure of the SEI film through polymerization, cross-linking and rearrangement reactions, and play an important role in the transmission of lithium ions. The generation process of organic components is complex and diverse, depending on the composition of the electrolyte, the properties of the electrolyte solvent and the working conditions of the battery. In addition, polymer additives are often introduced into the electrolyte to enhance the stability of the SEI film and the lithium ion conductivity.\n\nSecondly, the inorganic components in the SEI film also play an important role. The inorganic components mainly come from the reduction products of the electrolyte salt and the precipitates of the lithium salt. Electrolyte salts undergo reduction reactions in batteries to generate inorganic substances such as hydrides, carbonates, and hydroxides. The precipitates of lithium salts include compounds such as lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and lithium phosphate. These inorganic substances play a role in enhancing the structure and improving ion conductivity in the SEI membrane. They can fill the pores of the SEI membrane, increase the density of the membrane, and provide channels for ion transmission.\n\nIt should be noted that the specific composition and structure of the SEI membrane are affected by many factors, including the working conditions of the battery, the composition and concentration of the electrolyte, and the characteristics of the electrode material. Researchers use different electrolyte solvents, additives, and electrode materials, as well as optimize battery design and operating conditions to regulate the composition and performance of the SEI membrane in order to improve the cycle life and safety of lithium-ion batteries.\n\n2 Improvements and latest research progress of SEI membranes\n\n2.1 Carbon negative electrode materials\n\nCarbon negative electrode materials are widely used in lithium-ion batteries, and their performance and structure play an important role in the formation and stability of the SEI membrane. The surface functional groups of carbon negative electrode materials can react chemically with solvents and salts in the electrolyte to promote the formation of SEI film. For example, the functional groups of fluorine-containing compounds can react with solvents to generate fluorides, and then form a stable SEI film with lithium salts. In addition, other functional groups such as carboxylic acids and ketones can also react with salts or solvents in the electrolyte to form a more stable SEI film.\n\nSurface defects of carbon negative electrode materials (such as holes, cracks, etc.) can serve as the starting point for the formation of SEI film. These defects provide active sites, which are conducive to the adsorption and aggregation of electrolyte decomposition products, and then form SEI film. In addition, surface defects can also provide more reaction sites to promote the growth and stability of SEI film. The stability of carbon negative electrode materials directly affects the stability of SEI film. When the carbon negative electrode material undergoes deintercalation reaction, the SEI film must be able to effectively protect its surface to prevent further reaction and corrosion. Therefore, carbon negative electrode materials with good chemical stability and corrosion resistance can protect the integrity of SEI film and improve the cycle life of the battery.\n\nIn order to improve the performance and stability of the SEI film, researchers have modified carbon negative electrode materials through methods such as surface modification, conductive additives and nanostructure regulation. For example, a protective layer is applied to the surface to enhance the compatibility and corrosion resistance of carbon negative electrode materials with electrolytes. This protective layer can be composed of polymers, oxides, metals or other compounds, which can prevent harmful substances in the electrolyte from further corroding the carbon negative electrode materials and promote the formation and stability of the SEI film. In addition, the addition of conductive agents such as carbon black, conductive polymers, etc. can improve the conductivity of carbon negative electrode materials and promote the formation and stability of SEI films.\n\n2.2 Organic electrolyte\n\nThe electrolyte is an important component of lithium-ion batteries, and its composition and properties have a significant effect on the formation and stability of the SEI film. The selection of electrolyte solvents directly affects the formation and stability of the SEI film. Some organic solvents have high reducibility and easy decomposition, which can easily lead to the degradation of the SEI film. Therefore, the selection of stable solvents is crucial to the stability of the SEI film. In recent years, some new solvents such as ionic liquids and supramolecular solvents have been studied and applied to improve the safety of batteries and the stability of the SEI film. Lithium salts in electrolytes are important components of SEI film formation. The selection and concentration of lithium salts will affect the chemical composition and structure of SEI film. Commonly used lithium salts include lithium hydrochloride, lithium phosphate, lithium sulfate, etc. The selection of lithium salts should consider their solubility, stability and the effect on SEI film formation and stability. Suitable lithium salts can promote the formation of SEI film and improve its stability and ion conductivity.\n\nAdditives are an important means to optimize the performance of electrolytes. The type and concentration of additives can adjust the properties of electrolytes and the formation of SEI films. For example, adding fluorine-containing additives can promote the formation of SEI films and increase their stability and ion conductivity. Fluorine-containing additives can introduce fluorine atoms on the surface of SEI films to enhance their compatibility with electrolytes and electrodes, thereby improving the stability of SEI films. Polymer additives can also improve the mechanical stability of SEI films and reduce cracking and peeling of films. Thiol and thiophenol additives can react with lithium salts in SEI films to form compounds such as sulfides and sulfates. These compounds can enhance the stability and ion conductivity of the SEI membrane, reduce the degradation and resistance increase of the SEI membrane; some multifunctional additives can simultaneously have multiple functions to improve the performance of the SEI membrane. For example, phosphorus-containing additives can enhance the chemical stability and mechanical strength of the SEI membrane, inhibit the decomposition of the electrolyte solvent and the capacity decay of the battery.\n\nThe performance and stability of the SEI membrane can be improved by optimizing the formulation and composition of the electrolyte. Researchers are committed to developing electrolytes with higher stability and better compatibility with electrodes and SEI membranes to improve the cycle life and safety of lithium-ion batteries. At the same time, the design of the electrolyte also needs to comprehensively consider the conductivity, solubility, stability of the electrolyte, and the impact on the cost and sustainability of the battery.\n\n2.3 Application of artificial intelligence and machine learning\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning can extract the correlations and laws hidden in the data through the analysis and model training of a large amount of experimental data. In SEI membrane research, this means that researchers can use machine learning algorithms to process and analyze experimental data to better understand the formation mechanism and performance of the SEI membrane. By training on a large amount of experimental data, machine learning models can learn the key parameters, chemical composition and structural characteristics of SEI membranes, as well as their relationship with battery performance. These models can help predict and optimize the performance of SEI membranes and guide material design and battery optimization. For example, by building a machine learning-based model, the effects of different additives on SEI membrane stability and ion conductivity can be predicted, thereby providing guidance for the rational design of additives.\n\nUsing machine learning algorithms and high-throughput experimental techniques, researchers can efficiently screen and design materials with excellent SEI membrane performance. By learning and predicting the characteristics and properties of a large number of materials, machine learning models can help discover potential SEI membrane material candidates. Machine learning can learn the characteristics and properties of known materials, establish a predictive model, and then predict the performance of unknown materials. This material prediction model can provide guidance for researchers and accelerate the material research and development process. For example, by learning from the database of existing SEI membrane materials, machine learning models can predict the SEI membrane performance of new materials, thereby screening out materials with good performance and accelerating the development and application of new materials.\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning methods can also be used to optimize the performance and stability of SEI membranes and achieve rapid screening of optimal parameter combinations. By building models and performing multi-parameter optimization, researchers can quickly evaluate the effects of different parameters on SEI membrane performance and find the best parameter combination. Machine learning models can quickly screen and optimize in the search space of multiple parameters, thereby reducing trial and error and experimental costs. This efficient parameter optimization method can help researchers better understand the characteristics of SEI membranes and find the best SEI membrane materials and battery designs.\n\n3 Future Development Directions\n\nWith the continuous improvement of performance requirements for lithium-ion batteries, research on improving and optimizing SEI membranes will continue to receive attention. Future development directions include developing more stable electrolytes with high lithium ion conductivity, designing electrode materials with excellent electrochemical properties and mechanical stability, exploring new SEI formation mechanisms and regulation strategies, developing efficient SEI membrane evaluation methods and testing technologies, and promoting the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in SEI membrane research. In terms of electrolytes, researchers will focus on developing more stable electrolyte materials with high ion conductivity and low interfacial resistance. This includes the development of new electrolyte materials such as solid electrolytes and ionic liquids to improve battery safety, cycle life and temperature resistance. At the same time, designing electrode materials with excellent electrochemical properties and mechanical stability is also a focus of attention. The design and optimization of new alloy materials, porous structure materials, and conductive polymers will help improve the lithium storage capacity of the electrode and the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface.\n\nIn addition, future research will be devoted to exploring new SEI formation mechanisms and regulation strategies. Through more in-depth experimental and theoretical research, researchers will reveal the formation process and chemical reaction mechanism of the SEI film, thereby improving and optimizing the performance of the SEI film. The development of efficient SEI film evaluation methods and testing technologies is also an important direction for the future. In situ/galvanic cell characterization technology and advanced material characterization methods will be used to monitor and evaluate the performance and stability of the SEI film in real time. In addition, the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods in SEI film research will be further promoted. Through the analysis of a large amount of experimental data and model training, artificial intelligence and machine learning models can predict and optimize the performance of SEI films. In terms of material screening and design, machine learning algorithms can accelerate the process of material screening and SEI film performance prediction. In terms of optimization and rapid screening, artificial intelligence and machine learning methods can be used to quickly search and optimize multi-parameter space to improve research efficiency and accuracy."
