        "text": "Recently the rechargeable Li and Li-ion polymer batteries have improved due to development of Li-ion conductive gel electrolytes and of high energe granting intercalation compounds. In our laboratory the composite cathodic film, the composite carbon anode film and PVC-based electralyte film were successfully prepared by casting procedures. Cycling experiments of the cells with Li or composite carbon anode in contact with PVC-based electrolyte and composite cathode were performed. Relatively good performance of the cell with Li anode, the composite cathode and LiPF6-EC-DEC electrolyte was achieved in that over 50 cycles were possible with minimal capacity loss upon cycling. The same cell with PVC-based electrolyte was cycled over 20 cycles. Replacing Li anode by composite carbon anode, the cell behaved like the latter. It is found that appropriate amount of carbon content is helpful to improving specific capacity."
