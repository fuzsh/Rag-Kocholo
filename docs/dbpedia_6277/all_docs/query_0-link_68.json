Transparent samples with the surface crystallised Li2Si2O5 films on the glass were prepared which showed optical second harmonic generation. The orientation of the top crystalline layer was changed to b‐axis when ultrasonic surface treatment with an aqueous suspension containing Li2Si2O5 particles was applied before the heat treatment.\n\nNo Reference information available - sign in for access.\n\nNo Citation information available - sign in for access.\n\nNo Supplementary Data.\n\nNo Article Media\n\nNo Metrics\n\nDocument Type: Research Article\n\nAffiliations: Department of Environmental Chemistry and Materials, Faculty of Environmental Science and Technology, Okayama University, 2-1-1 Tsushima Naka, Okayama-shi 700, Japan\n\nPublication date: 01 December 1998\n\nShare Content\n\nAccess Key\n\nFree content\n\nPartial Free content\n\nNew content\n\nOpen access content\n\nPartial Open access content\n\nSubscribed content\n\nPartial Subscribed content\n\nFree trial content"
