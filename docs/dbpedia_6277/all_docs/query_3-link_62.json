        "text": "Lithium's mechanism of action is still unknownLabel. However, the “inositol depletion theory” suggests 3 main potential targets3. These targets are inositol monophosphatase, inositol polyphosphatase, and glycogen synthase kinase 3(GSK-3)3,6.\n\nThe “Inositol depletion theory” suggests lithium behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of inositol monophosphatase in a manner inversely proportional to the degree of stimulus3. This inhibition lowers levels of inositol triphosphate6. However, stronger inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase are not as clinically effective and low levels of inositol triphosphate are associated with memory impairment3,6.\n\nLithium acts on inositol polyphosphatase as an uncompetitive inhibitor3. This inhibition is thought to have multiple downstream effects that have yet to be clarified3.\n\nLithium regulates phosphorylation of GSK-3 which regulates other enzymes through phosphorylation3. Lithium can also inhibit GSK-3 through interfering with the magnesium ion in the active site3.\n\nTargetActionsOrganismUInositol monophosphatase 2Not AvailableHumansUInositol monophosphatase 1Not AvailableHumansUGlycogen synthase kinase-3 betaNot AvailableHumansUGlutamate receptor 3Not AvailableHumans\n\nIn rats, the oral LD50 is 525mg/kg and the inhalation LC50 is >2.17mg/L over 4 hoursMSDS.\n\nThere is insufficient data regarding the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or fertility impairment of lithium carbonateLabel. However, studies in rats and mice have shown repeated daily dosing of lithium carbonate result in adverse effects on male reproductive organs, spermatogenesis, and testosterone levelsLabel.\n\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the incidence of cardiovascular abnormalities in first trimester administration of lithiumLabel. Animal studies have shown adverse effects on the fetus and fertility overallLabel. The risk and benefit of lithium use in pregnancy must be weighed and should lithium treatment continue in pregnancy, serum lithium concentrations should be regularly monitored, dosages should be adjusted, and lithium should be decreased or stopped 2 or 3 days before delivery to avoid maternal and/or neonatal toxicityLabel.\n\nBreastfeeding is not recommended with maternal lithium use but if it is continued, the infant should be monitored for thyroid function and symptoms of lithium toxicity such as hypertonia, hypothermia, cyanosis, and ECG changesLabel.\n\nSafety in effectiveness in patients under 12 years has not been established, however dosing for patients 12 years and older is similar to that of adult patientsLabel.\n\nSafety in geriatric patients has not been established, however caution is advised when using lithium as this population is more likely to have impaired renal functionLabel.\n\nPatients with creatinine clearance between 30mL/min and 89mL/min should be started at a lower dose and slowly titrated to the correct dose while monitoring serum lithium levelsLabel. Patients with a creatinine clearance less than 30mL/min should not take lithium, especially in the case of a low sodium dietLabel."
