        "text": "Introduction\n\nSafe rechargeable batteries with higher specific energy are crucial for a wide variety of applications,1−7 and lithium metal is one of the most attractive anodes because it is the lightest and most electropositive metal, possessing a theoretical specific coulometric capacity (3860 mAh/g) 10 times greater than that of the graphite anodes used in lithium-ion batteries (372 mAh/g), a density of 0.59 g/cm3, and a high negative reduction potential of −3.040 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode.6,8−12 The emergence of lithium battery technologies, for which a range of electrolytes and cathodes is contemplated, has been hailed as the likeliest group of successors to the current multibillion dollar lithium-ion battery paradigm.13 Such technologies include lithium–sulfur14−16 and lithium–air/oxygen configurations.17−19 A major problem that emerges when lithium metal anodes are cycled is the growth of dendrites.3,8,12,20−24 The passage of current through these structures can short the battery or cause catastrophic failure.23 Efforts to prevent dendrite growth have primarily focused on blocking these protrusions.8,16,20,22,25−27 Li dendrite growth has been shown to stem from impurities in the Li metal electrode, which facilitate the nucleation of subsurface dendritic structures, and removal of such impurities can inhibit dendrite growth, although the exact impurity that catalyzes dendrite growth remains unclear.10 What is clear, however, is that producing lithium with greater control over purity and morphology will be critical for the success of energy storage technologies built from a lithium anode platform.\n\nAbout 75% of current lithium production originates from brines in the salars-evaporite basins (dried salt lakes) in the high Andes of Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia.28 This lithium is highly diluted, requiring extensive extraction operations and a copious water supply. It is then concentrated through solar evaporation (18–24 months). The base metal contaminants depend on the original brine content, typically Na, K, Ca, and Mg, with Na being a major impurity of around 1%.29 Lithium metal with purities in the range of 99.5–99.99% can be subsequently manufactured using electrowinning from molten eutectic LiCl–KCl salt electrolysis at around 500 °C.30 The energy requirements (35–40 kWh kg-Li), combined with the production of anhydrous lithium chloride feedstock, make for an energy-intensive process.31 Producing high-purity lithium metal at the level suitable for energy storage technology (>99.99%) is therefore challenging. For development into form factors suitable as electrodes, the lithium is extruded from an ingot into a foil typically limited to thicknesses above 100 μm and often prepared as a lithium–aluminum alloy foil, to maintain mechanical strength. There are inherent difficulties associated with preparing extruded thin lithium metal films <100 μm, with little possibility for control over microstructure. An alternative, that of a pure thin film-on-substrate, would be highly desirable for next-generation battery researchers and lithium metal battery manufacturers alike.\n\nHere, we demonstrate the ability of producing high-purity (with respect to metals content) lithium thin films in a variety of highly uniform and tunable morphologies at room temperature by an electrolytic cell. Dendrite-free thin films of high purity with respect to base metal contaminants are electrolytically deposited on a copper anode. The method is a low energy consumption approach when compared to the existing lithium manufacturing process. The cell design relies on a lithium-ion conducting solid-state membrane to transport Li+ ions from an aqueous mineral solution (lithium carbonate or other suitable lithium containing feedstock) to an organic conducting electrolyte in the absence of additives.32−36 The morphology of the lithium can be precisely tuned as a function of current density in an extremely narrow window (1–10 mA/cm2). The morphologies produced are spheres, cubes, and, most significantly, rods—an array of uniform, self-aligned, tightly packed, perpendicularly oriented rods with diameters of 300 nm. Purity and structural characterization of the three Li metal film morphologies (self-aligned nanorods, spheres, and nanocubes) were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). To evaluate the electrochemical performance of the different Li metal film morphologies for Li-ion batteries, two-electrode cells, in the form of standard CR-2032 coin-type cells, were fabricated and compared to Li metal foil as a standard. The rods, with lengths in excess of microns (10–200 μm), give rise to smooth films of lithium with an iridescent blue color. Microscopy of the rodlike array is reminiscent of the arrangement of chitin in morpho butterfly wings, the cause of structural coloration and their blue color. We present and advocate an additive-free method to produce high-purity lithium suitable for electrochemical applications, including energy storage, in which pure, dendrite-free electrodes with morphological control over a small range of current densities can be accomplished in one step ( ).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nTo evaluate the purity of the electrodeposited lithium metal, samples were analyzed independently by Intertek (Intertek Group PLC) for ICP-MS. The lithium purity was determined to be 99.985 wt % against a scan of 69 isotopes, 99.996 wt % on a metal basis. A complete list of the elements scanned and their concentration is presented in Table S1, Supporting Information. The major impurities in the film were silicon (69 ppmw), sulfur (19 ppmw), sodium (13 ppmw), and phosphorus (10 ppmw). The source of silicon impurities is systemic: it is known for ICP-MS and confirmed by Intertek that the silicon-rich environment of the ICP torch regularly causes significant background problems in the analysis. Consequently, the reported silicon concentration is unreliable because of these high background levels. The small amount of sulfur likely stems from the Cu foil pretreatment step, where trace amounts of sulfuric acid might have adsorbed onto the Cu surface. Phosphorus contaminants are from the LiPF6 salt in the organic electrolyte solution that was not completely removed from dimethyl carbonate (DMC) rinse after deposition.\n\nBy controlling the lithium deposition rates, distinct morphologies of deposited Li can be prepared, as shown in A–C. The deposition rates of −3, −5, and −7 mA/cm2 formed Li rods, spheres, and cubes respectively. The low-magnification images ( ) show uniform structures, which is consistent across the entire 3 cm × 3 cm electrode surface. The electrochemically deposited films deposited at −3 mA/cm2 form self-aligned, highly compacted nanorods with hemispherical tips with diameter of about 300 nm. See also Figure S1, Supporting Information. The Li spheres, deposited at −5 mA/cm2, exhibited a higher surface roughness and an average particle size of ∼1 μm. The Li cubes, deposited at −7 mA/cm2, had an average size of ∼100 nm. This is a somewhat unique observation of electrodeposited Li metal with sphere and cube morphologies, and of self-aligned rod morphologies without any additives.5,6\n\nThe deposition of relatively thick layers of highly crystalline Li metal is further confirmed in the XRD pattern, by a sharp peak at 35.9° 2θ (PDF #15-0401), as shown in . It also shows the formation of low-crystalline LiF, expected to be a part of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, defined by broad peaks of low intensities at 38.7 and 45.0° 2θ (PDF #04-0857). No sign of lithium oxidation is found in the initial material. LiF is thought to play a critical role in the formation of nanorods.8,37 Following exposure to air during the XRD measurement, the sample begins to oxidize, visible in the diffractograms taken after 15 and 30 min of exposure ( ). An expected reaction with air moisture results in the formation of LiOH (peaks at 32.4, 35.6, and 51.4° 2θ PDF #32-0564) as a hydrolyzation product, following the reaction 2Li + 2H2O → 2LiOH + H2. The intensity of LiOH peaks increases with longer exposure times. The hydrolysis is ultimately observed visually by the reactive lithium film turning white. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a proven powerful technique in the characterization and compositional analysis of electrode materials, including electrochemically deposited lithium.38,39 To acquire complementary information about the nonmetal contents, understand the composition of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, and estimate the SEI layer thickness, high-resolution XPS spectra were recorded for Li rod films ( A,B). Samples of freshly deposited lithium films were rapidly transferred from inert atmospheres to the XPS chamber to minimize the effect of air exposure. XPS was then recorded on pristine samples, followed by Ar+ sputtering to obtain depth profile information regarding the film from the surface (0 nm), down to 700 nm with successive intervals. Nonsputtered, pristine samples reveal the presence of Li as the main element, together with four impurities—F, O, C, and P ( a,c). Two of them—C and P, which originate from the organic solvent and electrolyte (or their decomposition products)—completely disappear after the Ar+ sputtering of the topmost 10 nm of the film, suggesting localization of these elements to the film surface (Figure S2, Supporting Information). XPS analysis is able to reveal detailed information regarding the nature and composition of the film: peak deconvolution of the first scan in the Li 1s region shows that the lithium metal (Li0) signal appears prior to Ar+ sputtering, suggesting an SEI layer thickness of <10 nm ( A). The top surface layer consists of lithiated products of decomposed DMC (viz. CH3OLi, CH3COOLi), organic electrolyte salts (viz. LiPF6, LiPOxFy), LiF, and LiOH. The presence of LiOH is most likely due to the reaction of Li metal with water vapors when it is exposed to air during the transfer to XPS machine. No evidence of pure DMC on the lithium surface was found in the C 1s region (see Figure S1, Supporting Information), indicating (i) complete DMC removal upon vacuum drying at −30 psi in the glovebox antechamber, and/or (ii) post reaction of DMC with Li at the surface. After sputtering, LiF and LiOH are the main impurities observed in the sample. The XPS spectra in the O 1s region also reveal the presence of Li2O ( a), which may be due to the exposure of LiOH to high-energy Ar+ sputtering beams, following the reaction 2LiOH → heating → Li2O + H2O, and therefore the presence of Li2O may be due to the analysis procedure. It is therefore deduced that fluorine is the major impurity for the electrolytically deposited lithium film in a H2O/O2-free environment. Considering the observation of two separate crystalline structures of Li and LiF, as evidenced by XRD and XPS, and consistent amounts of LiF through the sample, we suggest that lithium rods are formed by a pure lithium metal enveloped by a thin layer (<10 nm) of LiF. This layer is expected to act as a barrier, preventing Li rods from growing in and keeping them aligned in parallel.14 When used as an electrode for energy storage applications, the LIF may also play a beneficial role in the context of Li-ion conductivity, acting as a protective layer against formation of the SEI layer due to electrode exposure to organic electrolyte and preventing dendrite growth upon cycling.9 Similar qualitative results were obtained for the film of Li spheres, but with a thicker SEI layer—up to 40 nm (assuming a sputtering rate of 4 nm/min; see Figure S3, Supporting Information). A Li0 signal appeared only after the first sputtering. Moreover, C and P elements were found even after 21 min of sputtering (∼84 nm in depth). It should be noted that these results might be affected by surface roughness of the film, which causes nonuniform exposure to the ion beam and, consequently, uneven etching of the film.\n\nTo demonstrate the applicability of the lithium films and their morphologies, preliminary electrochemical testing was conducted. It was anticipated and observed that precise control over lithium morphology during deposition and growth can affect coulometric capacity. As a preliminary investigation of performance, the electrolytically deposited lithium films were tested using an asymmetric Li|C coin cell (see Experimental Section for cell preparation details). Capacity/cycling was analyzed using C-rate. Current density was estimated to be 2.2 mA/cm2 for 1C. At 0.1C, the gravimetric capacity of composite graphite versus lithium rods yielded a 1st cycle capacity of ∼258 mAh/g and a reversible capacity of 100 mAh/g at the 8th cycle, showing around 3 times better performance than lithium spheres and commercial lithium foil (both showed a reversible capacity of ∼35 mAh/g) tested under the same conditions. This is in good agreement with previous theoretical studies and experimental results, which suggest higher predicted values for rod-structured films compared to those obtained for smooth films.14 Similar trends in performance were observed at a higher cycling rate of 0.2C, 3 times higher capacity if lithium rods are used as a anode when compared to a commercial foil or the lithium spheres. At an increased C-rate of 0.5, the capacity of all three coin cells dropped down to 5 mAh/g. This could be due to a limitation on Li-ion diffusion (insufficient time for ions to intercalate graphite), which leads to redox reactions occurring mainly at the interface of the graphite electrode/electrolyte. Upon decreasing the cycle rate back to 0.1C, performance of the coin cell with Li rods was recovered up to 76 mAh/g, but gradually decreased down to 13 mAh/h and stabilized after the 40th cycle. In the case of Li spheres and commercial foil, the capacities were completely recovered and relatively stable up to ∼50 cycles. It is noted that the components used to construct the cells were not of the best choice for testing graphite as the working electrode (for instance, 1 M electrolyte solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/DMC/diethyl carbonate (DEC) in 4:2:4 by volume ratio is optimized to be used in manganese oxide batteries)."
