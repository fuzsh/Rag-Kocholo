LIBs laid the foundation of wireless electronics such as mobile phones and laptops. They are now used for everything from powering electric cars to storing energy from renewable sources on a grid scale. In 2019, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists for their contributions to rechargeable lithium-ion electrochemistry.\n\nThirty years later, LIBs are ubiquitous, but also well known for their dangers. As anyone traveling by plane can attest, Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has restrictions on device power (100-watt hours max per device) and spare, uninstalled LIBs must be transported in carry-on luggage only. Package handling services like UPS restrict lithium-containing batteries.\n\nLithium-ion car batteries are controversial, although they have been used in Teslas since 2021. The primary danger is fire due to flammable solvents in the electrolyte gel. If improperly charged or damaged so that oxygen or water is available, traditional lithium batteries can explode or cause fires. Issues with the dangers of LIB water exposure made the news in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian when a large amount of EVs with damaged batteries caught fire in southern Florida.\n\nFortunately, fires caused by LIBs can be extinguished with water, unlike the non-rechargeable lithium batteries which require a class D fire extinguisher. This is because LIBs have no elemental lithium. Instead, lithium ions are “intercalated” within layers of an oxide or phosphate cathode. The cathode is the positive electrode that acquires electrons from the\n\nThe anode is the negative electrode that releases electrons to the external circuit and oxidizes during the electrochemical reaction. See Figure 2. LIB anodes are typically made of graphite, coated on copper foil. In an open-air environment, or a non-rechargeable battery, the anodic material corrodes away while the cathode remains intact. In a rechargeable battery, corrosion leads to capacity loss. Material instability is ultimately what leads to a battery dying.\n\nConnecting the two ionically, is the electrolyte divided into two compartments by a barrier membrane. In a lead-acid car battery, the electrolyte is aqueous sulfuric acid. In most lithium batteries today, the electrolyte is a lithium salt solution such as lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6). It may be in a liquid or gelatinous form, or it may be a solid polymer.\n\nA lithium polymer battery, or more correctly lithium-ion polymer battery (abbreviated as LiPo), is a rechargeable battery using a highly conductive semisolid (gel) polymer as an electrolyte. These batteries provide higher energy density, meaning that they provide more energy relative to their mass. They are used in applications where weight is a critical feature, such as mobile devices, radio-controlled aircraft, and some electric vehicles.\n\nThe cost to produce all-solid-state batteries can range from four to 25 times that of lithium-ion batteries, according to the Japan Science and Technology Agency. Electrolytes account for 76% of materials costs. Lowering mass production costs will be key to bringing solid-state EV batteries into the mainstream because automotive applications requiring a large amount of electrolyte.[1]"
