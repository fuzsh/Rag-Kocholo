        "text": "We find rechargeable lithium batteries everywhere from deep-sea to space exploration, and wearables to implants. Fresh challenges call for new solutions. The thin film lithium-ion battery shows great potential, for it enables us to create revolutionary designs.\n\nWhat is the Difference from Ordinary Lithium-Ion?\n\nConventional lithium-ion batteries make us shape the product around their bulk. Thin film technology is easier going. It can scale down to micrometer or even nanometer thickness.\n\nTo give you an idea, a micrometer is one millionth of a meter. A nanometer is a thousand times thinner which is quite mind blowing.\n\nA thin film lithium-ion battery provides similar or improved current and voltage to its fatter cousin. Moreover, it allows us to make thinner medical devices, laptops, and smart phones. This in turn cuts down on storage and transport costs. Not to mention the carbon footprint of the casing. In addition, we can mold the batteries into any shape.\n\nWhat Goes on Inside a Thin Film Lithium-Ion Battery?\n\nThe cathodes in both battery types are metal oxides deposited as a film. Silver nanowires make the best current collector due to flexibility and weight.\n\nThe biggest difference is the electrolyte that separates them. Standard lithium-ion batteries use porous glass or polymer mesh. In the case of the thin film lithium-ion battery, something as simple as printer paper could to the job.\n\nHow Effective is Thin Film Lithium-Ion Battery Technology\n\nThe thin batteries perform better than their thicker cousins, if we overlook the cost. They have a longer cycling life, better energy density, are smaller, and weigh less. They have many potential applications such as smart cards and solar storage devices. For now, we will have to wait until thin film lithium-ion battery design catches up with our dreams.\n\nRelated\n\nBendable Battery Announced by Panasonic"
