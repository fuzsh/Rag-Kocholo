        "text": "Flexure testing for determination of the flexural strength of the active material coating is extremely important for the service life of lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThe active material of the electrodes consists of a 50-100 µm thick coating, of which the mechanical properties can vary greatly due to the chemical composition and the production process. This knowledge is important for defining optimal settings of production parameters such as throughput speed, roller angles, and pre-load forces. Determining the flexural strength using a 2-point flexure test kit enables the determination of the maximum permissible bending angle and bending radius at which the coating remains intact and the contact between the arrester foil and the active material is maintained. Here the zwickiLine testing machine with 2-point flexure test kit and integrated high-resolution load cell proves to be the perfect solution.\n\nThe Z-direction adhesion test is a more reliable and reproducible way of determining the bond strength and assessing the type of failure. Five specimens can be prepared simultaneously in the tensile bond Z-direction fixture. The testing machine also automatically performs the defined parameters of contact pressure and duration identically for each specimen. This test fixture helps reduce operator influence on the measurement result when compared to peel tests.\n\nEach individual specimen is then pulled off in the Z direction and a clear maximum bond strength value is determined. In addition to very efficient specimen preparation and high repeat accuracy, this method also allows you to determine the cohesion and adhesion components of the fracture pattern. The good comparability of the results achieved with this test procedure also enables reliable monitoring of the coating quality in the production process.\n\nThe behavior of the battery cells during the charge and discharge process, especially the expansion of the cell, referred to as battery swelling or battery respiration, influences the performance and service life. This phenomenon is particularly evident in prismatic cells and pouch cells, as well as solid-state batteries. However, understanding the expansion of cylindrical cells is also becoming increasingly important in the development of new battery generations.\n\nThe precise characterization of this behavior under simultaneous tempering is critical. Respiration of the cell must be taken into account for the assembly in the module, as the expansion of the cells in the module leads to a change in the pressure on the cell. This pressure and the temperature significantly influence the service life and performance of the cells. Therefore, accurate characterization of the cell respiration and swelling are very important. ZwickRoell offers various approaches for characterization of the cell behavior in the charge and discharge cycle, including electrical cyclization, high-precision deformation measurement, long-term test procedures and controlled temperature.\n\nTemperature control of the entire battery cell\n\nThe battery cell is heated to a desired operating temperature using a temperature chamber, which is kept constant in the chamber for the duration of the test. Control is based on the ambient temperature in the temperature chamber. Depending on the risk, safety during the test is ensured via the temperature chamber or a proactive chamber with a suitable hazard level.\n\nPrecise and homogeneous temperature control of the complete battery cell\n\nBy actively heating and cooling the compression platens, the surface temperature of the battery cell is homogeneously tempered and precisely controlled from above and below. On the other hand, local temperature fluctuations within the battery cell can also be compensated. Critical temperatures at high discharge currents, for example, are therefore counteracted and reliable testing is ensured.\n\nThis type of testing was developed in collaboration with MBTS. An article has now examined the influence of different temperatures, pressures and discharge rates on the electrical properties of a standardized lithium-ion battery cell for automotive applications.\n\nLink to article\n\nBattery abuse tests are destructive reliability tests for lithium-ion batteries. These tests are required for market release and use of batteries in automotive applications. During the tests, the battery is exposed to extreme conditions to ensure its safety and reliability. In addition to thermal and electrical tests, typical abuse tests also include mechanical tests.\n\nDuring mechanical tests, the battery is physically stressed by an object penetrating it or by applying a mechanical load to it in order to test its integrity. For example, this involves investigating how nail penetration (nailing), which causes an internal short circuit, or crushing affects the functionality and safety-related behavior of the battery.\n\nThese battery abuse tests typically lead to thermal runaway, which can result in fire or explosion. Due to environmental regulations and occupational safety awareness, these tests must not be carried out in open environments or old buildings without exhaust gas treatment, to ensure reproducible environmental conditions.\n\nWith the universal testing machine AllroundLine Z100 from ZwickRoell and the Weiss Technik extreme event environmental simulation system, battery tests can be performed with a maximum force of 100 kN. Thanks to the mechanical modularity, test tools can be changed easily and safely and various mechanical abuse tests can be carried out safely on one machine. The test results are evaluated with the testXpert testing software.\n\nMore on battery abuse testing with extreme event chamber"
