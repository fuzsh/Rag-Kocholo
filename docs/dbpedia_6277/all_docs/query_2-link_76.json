These additives are reductively decomposed at the negative electrode, so as to form a coating film, which restrains the electrolytic solution from decomposing.\n\nthe present invention provides a method of manufacturing a lithium-ion secondary battery, the method including an electrolytic solution making step of making an electrolytic solution by mixing at least an organic solvent and an electrolytic salt together, an electrode insertion step of inserting an anode and a cathode into an outer case, and a liquid injection step of injecting the electrolytic solution into the outer case; wherein the electrolytic solution making step or the liquid injection step adds a compound having an alkyl group with a carbon number of 10 or greater and an epoxy, vinyl, or silanol group at a terminal to the electrolytic solution.\n\nthe above-mentioned method can yield a lithium-ion secondary battery capable of achieving both the initial charge/discharge efficiency and rate characteristic at a high level.\n\nthe alkyl group When a compound having an alkyl group with a carbon number of about 1 or 2 and an epoxy, vinyl, or silanol group is added to an electrolytic solution, for example, the alkyl group polymerizes at the time of charging, thereby forming a coating film on the anode surface. Though thus forming a coating film by polymerizing the alkyl group restrains the electrolytic solution from decomposing, the formed coating film becomes a resistance at the time of charging/discharging, thereby increasing the internal resistance of the battery and lowering the rate characteristic.\n\nthe alkyl group does not polymerize at the time of charging, whereby the compound is supported or adsorbed onto the anode surface or combined thereon through the epoxy, vinyl, or silanol group.\n\nthe alkyl group part yields such a degree of freedom as to pass ions moderately therethrough, whereby the internal resistance of the battery is kept from rising.\n\nthe existence of the above-mentioned compound can restrain coating films and the like, which may raise the internal resistance, from being formed on the anode surface, thereby yielding a rate characteristic better than that obtained without adding the above-mentioned compound to the electrolytic solution.\n\nthe rate characteristic is improved by adding the above-mentioned compound has not been elucidated completely, it is presumed that the above-mentioned compound covers the anode surface by being supported, adsorbed, or combined thereon, so that an alkyl chain, which is a part of the compound, shapes a flow of lithium ions, thereby allowing the lithium ions to move smoothly.\n\nthe support, adsorption, or combination of the above-mentioned compound onto the anode surface occurs at active sites of the anode surface selectively and in preference to the decomposition of the electrolytic solution. Since the decomposition of the electrolytic solution occurs at the active sites of the anode surface, the above-mentioned compound supported, adsorbed, or combined at the active sites restrains the decomposition of the electrolytic solution from proceeding. Therefore, adding the above-mentioned compound to the electrolytic solution can keep the irreversible capacity from being generated by the decomposition of the electrolytic solution, whereby a favorable initial charge/discharge efficiency can be obtained.\n\nthe âanodeâ and âcathodeâ are determined with reference to the polarities of the lithium-ion secondary battery at the time of discharging for convenience of explanation. Hence, the âanodeâ and âcathodeâ become the âcathodeâ and âanodeâ, respectively, at the time of charging.\n\nthe above-mentioned compound is represented by the following general formula (1):\n\nn is an integer of 9 to 17.\n\nthe above-mentioned compound is added by 0.3 to 3.0 mass % with respect to the total amount of the electrolytic solution after adding the compound.\n\nthe amount of addition of the compound falls within the range mentioned above, the above-mentioned effects are exhibited more effectively, thus making it possible to yield a lithium-ion secondary battery which can achieve both the initial charge/discharge efficiency and rate characteristic at a high level.\n\nthe anode contains at least one of graphite, an Si-containing compound, and an Sn-containing compound as an active material.\n\nthe anode containing such an active material can more effectively exhibit the effects mentioned above, thereby yielding a lithium-ion secondary battery which can achieve both the initial charge/discharge efficiency and rate characteristic at a high level.\n\nthe present invention provides an electrolytic solution containing an organic solvent, an electrolytic salt, and a compound having an alkyl group with a carbon number of 10 or greater and an epoxy, vinyl, or silanol group at a terminal.\n\nthe above-mentioned compound is represented by the following general formula (1):\n\nn is an integer of 9 to 17.\n\nthe above-mentioned compound is contained by 0.3 to 3.0 mass % with respect to the total amount of the electrolytic solution.\n\nthe content of the compound falling within the range mentioned above can exhibit the above-mentioned effects more effectively when a lithium-ion secondary battery is constructed, whereby both the initial charge/discharge efficiency and rate characteristic can be achieved at a high level.\n\nthe present invention provides a lithium-ion secondary battery comprising an anode, a cathode, and an electrolytic solution, wherein the electrolytic solution is the above-mentioned electrolytic solution in accordance with the present invention.\n\nthis lithium-ion secondary battery uses the above-mentioned electrolytic solution in accordance with the present invention, it can achieve both the initial charge/discharge efficiency and rate characteristic at a high level, because of the reason explained in connection with the above-mentioned method of manufacturing a lithium-ion secondary battery.\n\nthe anode contains at least one of graphite, an Si-containing compound, and an Sn-containing compound as an active material.\n\nthe anode containing such an active material can more effectively exhibit the effects mentioned above, whereby both the initial charge/discharge efficiency and rate characteristic can be achieved at a high level.\n\nthe present invention provides a lithium-ion secondary battery manufactured by the above-mentioned method of manufacturing a lithium-ion secondary battery in accordance with the present invention.\n\nThis lithium-ion secondary battery can achieve both the initial charge/discharge efficiency and rate characteristic at a high level, because of the reason explained in connection with the above-mentioned method of manufacturing a lithium-ion secondary battery.\n\nthe present invention can provide a method of manufacturing a lithium-ion secondary battery for producing a lithium-ion secondary battery capable of achieving both the initial charge/discharge efficiency and rate characteristic at a high level, an electrolytic solution, and a lithium-ion secondary battery.\n\nFIG. 1 is a front view showing a preferred embodiment of the lithium-ion secondary battery in accordance with the present invention\n\nFIG. 2 is an
