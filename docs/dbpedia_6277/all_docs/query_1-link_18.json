        "text": "The Benefits of Lithium Hydroxide\n\nThere are two forms of lithium that can be used in electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries, lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. So, the first question may be, where does lithium come from? Lithium comes from spodumene ore via hard rock mining, or from metallic brines stored in man-made ponds in the high deserts around the\n\nLocation. Location. Location.\n\nIn building out a US-based supply chain for electric vehicles and battery manufacturers, accessibility and affordability are key. Our spodumene mineral resources are located within the world-class Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt (“TSB”) which historically provided most of the western world’s lithium between the 1950s and 1980s. The TSB has been described as one of the largest\n\nLithium supply versus electric vehicle and battery demand\n\nRemember that famous saying, “Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink.” With respect to the lithium hydroxide that is preferred by EV manufacturers, currently there are parallels to that saying. At Piedmont Lithium, we’re going to help change that. According to Bloomberg NEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook, by 2025 EVs will hit 10% of\n\nCreating a U.S. Lithium Supply Chain Helps Create U.S. Jobs\n\nBuilding a US-based lithium supply chain to support electric vehicle manufacturing holds enormous potential for the U.S. Economy; positively impacting the lives of American workers and American families. In addition to helping improve our quality of life by improving the quality of our environment, lithium-driven businesses create well-paying jobs and economic opportunity. With the demand\n\nWhy U.S. Made Lithium Hydroxide?\n\nThe benefits of producing lithium hydroxide in the U.S. can be found in both the market and the material. In addition to combating the threat of China controlling such an important industry and reaping the financial benefits, building a lithium supply chain in the U.S. will advantage American electric vehicle manufacturers, battery makers, chemical companies,\n\nWhy US-Based Lithium? An Opportunity Ready to Happen.\n\nCurrently, China controls 83% of the processed lithium needed to produce lithium-ion batteries. They also have a large position in actual battery assembly. Beyond their production dominance, they are heavily invested in sourcing the raw materials required to produce battery-grade lithium. This comes from partnerships with countries and companies in Chile, Argentina, Australia, and several\n\nBreaking Down Battery Types.\n\nOver the last decade, engineers have intensified their efforts on maximizing the amount of energy that lithium batteries can store, charge and discharge quickly, while also minimizing battery size and weight. As a result, we’ve seen three dominant battery chemistries applied in powering EVs: Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP), Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NCM) and Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum (NCA). While the\n\nWhere Lithium Comes from Does Make A Difference? Brine vs. Hard Rock.\n\nAs with most things in life there are usually more than one way to do something. The same holds true when it comes to sourcing lithium. There are two primary processes, lithium from brine, or lithium from hard rock, which is our approach at Piedmont. Let’s take a look at both approaches. Brine: As described"
