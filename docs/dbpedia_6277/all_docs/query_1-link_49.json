        "text": "A typical lithium-ion battery consists of two current collectors, an anode, a cathode, a separator and electrolyte. Current collectors work as a support for electrode materials. They are also electrical conductors between electrode and external circuits.\n\nFor lithium-ion battery, various current collectors are used such as Al, Cu, Ni, Ti, and stainless steel. Within the above materials, Al and Cu are the most commonly used materials as current collectors. Al is used for a cathode current collector and Cu is used as an anode current collector. Al and Cu current collectors can further be categorized into foil, meshed, foam and carbon coated type current collectors.\n\nMeshed foil is generally lighter than regular foil with the same thickness. It can improve device power density due to its lighter weight and more active material loading. Besides, for the meshed structure, it has better electrolyte infiltration, better coating adhesion and reduced internal resistance.\n\nFoam type current collectors has higher porosity, light weight, high strength and specific surface area. It can improve capacity, cycling performance and thermal management.\n\nCarbon coated type current collectors has several advantages.\n\nImproved electrical conductivity and less internal resistance\n\nImproved adhesion at active layer/current collector interface\n\nInhibition of cell polarization and short circuit caused by dendrite growth\n\nPrevention of substrate corrosion caused by electrolyte\n\nAl current collectors\n\nAl is widely used for cathode due to its high electrochemical stability and conductivity. Moreover, Al has good mechanical properties and low density which is beneficial for increasing battery gravimetric energy density.\n\nMSE supplies offers various type of Al current collectors.\n\nCu current collectors\n\nCu is widely used for anode since it also has high electrochemical stability and conductivity.\n\nMSE supplies offers various type of Cu current collectors.\n\nCu foil\n\nConductive Carbon Coated Copper Foil\n\nMeshed Cu foil\n\nCu foam\n\nShiny on both sides\n\nSingle side\n\nLighter weight\n\nPorous, light weight\n\nDimension customizable\n\nDouble side coated\n\nDimension customizable\n\nDimension customizable"
