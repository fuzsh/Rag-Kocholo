        "text": "The introduction of lithium batteries has been one of the most critical steps in the evolution of battery technology. Lithium batteries provide the opportunity to replace big bulky, leaky lead-acid batteries with compact Li-ion battery systems with significantly better capacity.\n\nThe lithium-ion battery industry has dominated over traditional options, such as lead-acid batteries. In fact, lithium battery technology is so popular that many different types of lithium batteries are available on the market for all applications and needs.\n\nIn this article, we will compare different types of lithium batteries, their advantages, disadvantages, and uses.\n\nWhat is a Lithium Battery?\n\nLithium batteries are rechargeable batteries that create electric current due to the movement of lithium ions between the cathode material (negative electrode) and the anode material (positive electrode).\n\nThe materials used in a lithium-ion battery are lithium-based compounds for the anode and usually a graphite carbon cathode. The electrodes are separated by an electrolyte which varies based on the particular type of lithium battery technology.\n\nThe lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode during the charging process. During discharging of the lithium-ion battery, the lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode.\n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Lithium Batteries?\n\nLithium-ion battery types differ based on the lithium compound used in the anode electrode. There are six different types of lithium batteries:\n\nLithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4 or LFP)\n\nLFP batteries have Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LiFePO4) as the anode material, and this is one of the most widely adopted battery technologies nowadays. The anode is made of Lithium Iron Phosphate, one of the most stable and non-toxic lithium compounds.\n\nIt results in greater thermal stability in fully charged conditions. Whereas other lithium-ion battery types tend to exhibit thermal runaway in these conditions.\n\nCharacteristics of LFP Batteries\n\nNominal Voltage: 3.2V-3.3V\n\nOperating Voltage: 2.5V-3.65V\n\nCycle Life: 2500\n\nThermal Stability: up to 270°C\n\nCharge Rate (C-Rate): 1C, typically charges to 3.65V in 3 hours\n\nDischarge Rate (C-Rate): 1C, can be 25C in certain cells, cutoff varies between 2-2.5V\n\nSpecific Energy: 90Wh/kg to 120 Wh/kg\n\nAdvantages\n\nLonger cycle life: three to five times longer than other types of lithium batteries.\n\nHigh-quality cells: an Eco Tree Lithium battery gives you a minimum warranty of six years. With proper use, it is guaranteed that your LFP battery will last at least that long.\n\nMade with a very stable compound of phosphate and iron. No risk of explosions or the release of toxic gases.\n\nWide operating range – an impressive Depth of Discharge (DoD) of about 98%-100% eliminates the danger that the battery will get damaged if discharged fully, unlike other lithium-ion batteries.\n\nHigh thermal stability: LFP is the most stable battery chemistry across the entire temperature range and is guaranteed to operate safely in any application.\n\nDisadvantages of LFP batteries\n\nThere are no particular disadvantages to LFP batteries. Some people consider the higher cost as a negative factor.

The unique selling point of lithium cobalt oxide batteries is their high energy density, which makes them the best choice for some particular applications with this requirement.\n\nLCO batteries have a significantly low specific power. This means there is a limitation to their load capability, making them unsuitable for applications such as electric vehicles.\n\nCharacteristics of LCO Batteries\n\nNominal Voltage: 3.6V\n\nOperating Voltage: 3V-4.2V\n\nCycle Life: 500 to 1000 cycles\n\nThermal Stability: up to 150°C.

This means that NMC batteries are less cost-effective than LFP batteries.\n\nApplications\n\nElectric Vehicles\n\nE-bikes\n\nMedical devices\n\nPower tools\n\nLithium Titanate Batteries (Li2TiO3 or LTO)\n\nLTO batteries are different from the other lithium-ion batteries mentioned previously. These batteries use Lithium Titanate (Li2TiO3) as the anode material instead of a graphite anode. The cathode materials are Li-NMC or Lithium Manganese Oxide.\n\nCharacteristics of LTO Batteries\n\nNominal Voltage: 2.4V\n\nOperating Voltage: 1.8Vto 2.85V\n\nCycle Life: 3000 to 7000 cycles\n\nThermal Runaway: 175°C to 225°C\n\nCharge Rate (C-Rate): 1-5C, charges up to 2.85V\n\nDischarge Rate (C-Rate): 10C, cutoff at 1.8V\n\nSpecific Energy: 50 KWh/kg to 80 KWh/kg\n\nAdvantages of LTO Batteries\n\nThe life cycle of LTO batteries is one of the longest.\n\nThey are thermally stable.\n\nDisadvantages of LTO Batteries\n\nLTO batteries usually cost twice as much as LFP batteries.\n\nThe lower energy density of these batteries provides little energy when their size is taken into account.\n\nApplications\n\nElectric powertrains\n\nMedical equipment\n\nIndustrial tools\n\nLithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxide Battery (LiNiCoAlO2 or NCA) Batteries\n\nNCA batteries replace the Manganese in NMC batteries with Aluminium. Due to the similar materials used and cell construction, NCA and NMC batteries share some common features. The addition of Aluminium to Lithium Nickel Cobalt Oxide adds the element of chemical stability to an NCA battery.\n\nCharacteristics of NCA Batteries\n\nNominal Voltage: 3.6V\n\nOperating Voltage: 3V to 4.2V\n\nCycle Life: 500 cycles\n\nThermal Runaway: 150°C – Greater chance of instability when fully charged\n\nCharge Rate (C-Rate): 0.7C, charges up to 4.2V\n\nDischarge Rate (C-Rate): 1C, cutoff at 3V\n\nSpecific Energy: 200 KWh/kg to 260 KWh/kg\n\nAdvantages of NCA Batteries\n\nThe specific energy of NCA batteries is high, making this lithium-ion battery technology useful for applications with a moderate to high load over a long time.\n\nDisadvantages of NCA Batteries\n\nNCA batteries have a relatively short life span compared to other lithium-ion battery types.\n\nThe thermal stability of these batteries is poor, and there is a high risk of thermal runaway in outdoor use.\n\nThe cost of NCA batteries is high, considering their short lifespan. This makes them the least cost-effective lithium-ion battery.\n\nApplications\n\nElectric vehicles\n\nCell Form Classification of Lithium Ion Batteries\n\nBesides the classification based on electrode materials, there is another way to classify lithium-ion battery systems. There are three types of lithium-ion batteries based on this classification:\n\nCylindrical Cells\n\nThese are the most widely used commercial lithium-ion cells. They form the batteries used in toys, medical devices, gadgets, and more. Cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells differ from conventional batteries, as the former are rechargeable lithium batteries with a higher capacity.\n\nThis type of cell features sealed electrodes and electrolytes in a protective cylindrical metal can. A cylindrical lithium-ion battery offers excellent safety and the best protection against thermal elements. Cylindrical Li-ion batteries are also the cheapest ones to manufacture.\n\nPouch Cells\n\nUnlike a cylindrical or prismatic cell, a lithium pouch cell is physically flexible. The battery cell is sealed in flexible foil or plastic film for protection. A lithium pouch cell is very lightweight and can be made into batteries of any shape or size. These batteries are used in drones, RC vehicles, jump starters, etc.\n\nPouch cells tend to swell when used. Therefore, when integrating these cells into any application, it is important to allocate extra space to account for the swelling of the cell.\n\nPrismatic Cell\n\nPrismatic cells are cubic lithium batteries that contain electrode sheets and separators in a sturdy plastic housing. Prismatic cells are made in a single-row or two-row module of four cells, with arrestors having the same polarity. Prismatic cells are more expensive batteries than cylindrical cells but provide much greater storage.\n\nLithium batteries in cell phones and laptops are all prismatic energy cell batteries. While lightweight and thin, these batteries are prone to heating due to the metal casing used.\n\nHow Do Different Types of Lithium-ion Batteries Compare?\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the comparison between different types of lithium-ion batteries:\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many different types of lithium-ion batteries, and as is evident from the information above, lithium batteries vary drastically in terms of their characteristics. This makes different lithium-ion batteries suitable for different purposes and requirements.\n\nEven among any particular lithium-ion battery type, the properties of the battery can vary significantly among different battery manufacturers.\n\nFor instance, while most lithium iron phosphate batteries last for about five to six years, LiFePO4 batteries from Eco Tree Lithium last at least eight to ten years. The manufacturer provides a six-year warranty policy so that you know your battery will last at least that long.\n\nEco Tree Lithium’s LFP batteries also come with an integrated Battery Management System (BMS). This system provides protection from elements such as overcharging, overheating, operation in cold temperatures, etc.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHere are the answers to some commonly asked questions regarding lithium batteries:\n\nAre all lithium batteries the same?\n\nNo, all lithium batteries are not the same. In fact, the difference between two lithium-ion batteries can be that of night and day due to their technological complexity. The characteristics of a lithium-ion battery depend on the particular lithium-based compound used at the electrodes.\n\nHow many different types of cells are used for lithium batteries?\n\nBased on electrode materials, there are six different types of lithium cells: LFP, NMC, LCO, NCA, LTO, and LMO. Based on the cell shape, there are three types of lithium-ion batteries- cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic, each with distinct battery performance parameters.\n\nWhich type of lithium battery is safest?\n\nLithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP batteries) are the safest among current lithium-ion batteries on the market. LFP batteries do not contain toxic substances like cobalt and have excellent thermal and chemical stability characteristics.\n\nLithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP batteries) are considered to be the safest batteries out there.
