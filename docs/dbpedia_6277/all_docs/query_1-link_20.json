        "text": "Lithium-ion battery-powered personal devices have moved well beyond mobile phones and laptops. Many of us have rushed to buy electric power tools, bikes, vacuums, and more. We can recharge them and use them in more places since they don’t require a power outlet. They’re safe when stored properly and great for the environment. Unfortunately, relocating with these devices is another story. Lithium-ion batteries can pose safety and environmental hazards during a household move.\n\nIf you oversee corporate relocations or are with a moving company, here are some challenges to plan for and steps you can take to avoid lithium-ion battery risks. You play an important role in educating your employees and customers. When they understand the risks, they tend to comply more fully with recommended safety precautions.\n\nWhy aren’t lithium-ion batteries safe to move?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation deems lithium-ion batteries a hazardous material. When you receive an online purchase of a lithium-ion battery-powered product, you’ll notice the outside packaging has a warning label. In transport, these batteries can leak toxic chemicals, catch fire, or even explode.\n\nThese events can happen on a moving van or in a shipping container for a few reasons:\n\nImproper packing. Items shift while moving, and a heavy box or household good could fall, damaging the batteries in a device\n\nExcessive heat. A move can expose cargo to extreme heat. The back of a truck, an airport tarmac, a container port, or temporary storage facility can become an oven. This is especially true for summer moves. High internal cargo temperatures can also occur when a moving van is parked in direct sun for a prolonged period. Lithium-ion batteries and high heat do not mix. Excessive heat can cause a spark inside the battery casing, leading to a chain reaction that eventually causes the casing to explode.\n\nTrucking accidents. According to Bureau of Transportation statistics, highway incidents among trucks with hazardous materials caused more than 20,000 fatalities in 2020, in addition to property damage. And the numbers keep climbing. If a truck catches fire from an accident, lithium-ion batteries will help that fire spread or even explode.\n\nLiquids spilling on the lithium-ion battery. Liquids can corrode or damage the internal battery safety devices and cause the battery to overheat, ignite, rupture, or leak. Sometimes, condensation will develop inside a shipping container as it moves across different climates. Any moisture source can harm a lithium-ion battery.\n\nHow can you avoid lithium-ion battery risks during relocation?\n\nFollowing these five steps can help keep your shipment safe:\n\nRespect the dangers. Lithium-ion batteries present a risk to property and life when moving. (Improperly stored batteries in a house present these same concerns.) No one wants to leave an expensive battery behind or ship it separately when moving. However, the potential cost of not doing this is high.\n\nGet rid of old lithium-ion batteries. The older these batteries get, the more dangerous they become. They deteriorate and catch fire more easily. Check with your local waste recycling program or the national Call2Recycle for proper disposal before moving.\n\nKnow the manufacturer’s packing guidance for each lithium-ion device. Each product will have its own instructions. Residents may need to go directly to the manufacturer if they do not have these instructions.\n\nUse FedEx or UPS to ship batteries to your new residence. Both companies have specific guidance and will ensure your batteries are properly packaged.\n\nIf the battery is reliable and newer, consider selling it or giving it away. Then, purchase a new one with high quality ratings when you’ve settled into your new home. Manufacturing defects in poorly made lithium-ion batteries can cause the dangers cited above.\n\nAgain, thorough customer education by movers and corporate relocation specialists leads to better compliance with safety recommendations. From your experience in the industry, you likely have stories about battery mishaps during moves. Share these stories with your customers. Real-life examples help underscore why lithium-ion battery precautions are so important. No customer wants to put their shipment at risk."
