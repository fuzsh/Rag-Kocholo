        "text": "A comprehensive, accessible introduction to modern all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries.\n\nAll-solid-state thin-film lithium-ion batteries present a special and especially important version of lithium-ion ones. They are intended for battery-powered integrated circuit cards (smart-cards), radio-frequency identifier (RFID) tags, smart watches, implantable medical devices, remote microsensors and transmitters, Internet of Things systems, and various other wireless devices including smart building control and so on.\n\nComprising four chapters the monograph explores and provides:\n\nThe fundamentals of rechargeable batteries, comparison of lithium-ion batteries with other kinds, features of thin-film batteries.\n\nA description of functional materials for all-solid-state thin-film batteries.\n\nVarious methods for applying functional layers of an all-solid-state thin-film lithium-ion battery.\n\nDiagnostics of functional layers of all-solid-state thin-film lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThe monograph is intended for teachers, researchers, advanced undergraduate students, and post-graduate students of profile faculties of universities, as well as for developers and manufacturers of thin-film lithium-ion batteries.\n\nBiography\n\nD.Sc. Tatiana Kulova is a prominent scientist in the field of chemical power sources, especially in lithium-ion batteries. She is head of Laboratory of processes in batteries in Frumkin Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry. She is author of more than 250 papers in scientific journals. Simultaneously she is Professor in National Research University \"Moscow Power Engineering Institute\". She is a member of the International Society of Electrochemistry.\n\nM.Sc. Alexander Mironenko is the chief technologist of the Yaroslavl branch of the K.A. Valiev Physical-Technological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences with forty years of experience in the field of micro- and nanoelectronic technologies. Since 2009 he has been developing technologies for the deposition of functional layers of all-solid-state thin-film lithium-ion batteries. For the past 10 years, he has been leading a group of young scientists, working in the field of battery technology and diagnostic methods for materials for lithium-ion batteries. Author of over 40 publications in scientific journals and monographs.\n\nProf. Alexander Rudy is a specialist in the field of mathematical modelling, dynamics of nonlinear systems and heat and mass transfer in solids. He has been the head of the Yaroslavl branch of the K.A. Valiev Physical-Technological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences for more than 10 years. Simultaneously he is the head of the Department of Nanotechnology and Electronics in the Centre for Shared Use of Scientific Equipment \"Diagnostics of Micro- and Nanostructures\" at the P.G. Demidov Yaroslavl State University. Author of 3 monographs and over 150 publications in scientific journals and 14 patents for inventions.\n\nProf. Alexander Skundin is an acclaimed scientist in the fields of electrochemistry and power sources. For 20 years he headed the Department of Processes in Chemical Power Sources in Frumkin Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry. He is author of more than 300 papers in scientific journals and 5 monographs. He is also Professor in National Research University \"Moscow Power Engineering Institute\". He is a member of the International Society of Electrochemistry and The Electrochemical Society."
