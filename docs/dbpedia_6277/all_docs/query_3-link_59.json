        "text": "Lithium is the first element that we are learning about that is a solid at room temperature. Lithium is pretty; a shiney silvery alkali metal. It is so soft it can be cut with scissors and it's so light that it floats on water. But it's also extremely reactive so it doesn't stay shiney or silvery very long. For this reason, it is never found \"in the wild\" in its pure elemental form (on earth). Similar to helium, lithium has many uses, not the least of which are lithium-ion batteries, soldering flux and, since it burns a brilliant scarlet colour, it provides those spectacular red colours to fireworks. But in my opinion, lithium's medicinal uses are among its most important attributes: it is critically important as a mood stabilizer for hundreds of thousands of people who find relief from the worst symptoms of bipolar disorder. Lithium also lessens symptoms for some migraine sufferers and for some who experience cluster headaches. How it works in the body remains elusive.\n\nAs a Seattle native and a fan of Nirvana (even before they experienced their crushing international success), I thought about sharing their hit song, \"Lithium\" with you. However, some people might not appreciate watching a boring old music video, so I instead decided to share this lovely little rendition of that song, using sock puppets:\n\nTo review, we've learned a little about these elements:"
