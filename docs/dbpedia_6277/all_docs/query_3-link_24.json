        "meta_description": "Low ambient temperatures significantly reduce Lithium ion batteries' (LIBs') charge/discharge power and energy capacity, and cause rapid degradation through lithium plating. These limitations can be addressed by preheating the LIB with an external heat source or by exploiting the internal heat generation through the LIB's internal impedance. Fast external heating generates large temperature gradients across the LIB due to the low thermal conductivity of the cell, while internal impedance heating (usually through AC or pulse charge/discharging) tends to be relatively slow, although it can achieve more uniform temperature distribution. This paper investigates the potential of combining externally sourced resistive film heating with bidirectional pulse heating to achieve fast preheating without causing steep temperature gradients. The LIB is modeled with the Doyle Fuller Newman (DFN) electrochemical model and 1D thermal model, and reinforcement learning (RL) is used to optimize the pulse current amplitude and film voltage concurrently. The results indicate that the optimal policy for maximizing the rate of temperature rise while limiting temperature gradients has the film heating dominate the initial phases and create the ideal conditions for pulse heating to take over. In addition, the pulse component shares the heating load and reduces the energy rating of the auxiliary power source.",
