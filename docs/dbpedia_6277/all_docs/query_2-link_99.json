        "text": "Lithium batteries are powerful, long-lasting options for personal and professional use. We use these battery packs for golf carts, forklifts, RVs, and much more. However, there may come a time when you need to put temporarily unused batteries in storage. Doing so the wrong way, however, could result in damage to the batteries and a reduction in performance when you go to use them again.\n\nBigBattery is here with a guide to safely storing lithium batteries and ensuring you have the proper physical and mechanical conditions to maximize the longevity of your batteries. Fortunately, lithium battery packs are highly durable, and you may only need to make a few changes for adequate long-term storage. Read on to become a battery-storage pro!\n\nRemoving and Charging the Battery\n\nOne of the first questions to address with battery storage is whether you need to disconnect the battery from its larger power system. For example, you may think you can put your golf cart into storage, and that effectively puts the battery away with it. However, that’s not the best idea.\n\nEven when you turn off the electrical components of your golf cart, camper van, or other vehicle, the battery still self-drains at a rate inherent to its chemistry, and leaving it connected will cause it to drain faster, potentially shortening its lifespan. So for the sake of your lithium battery pack and what you connect it to, we recommend separating the two when keeping them in extended storage, typically 3 – 6 months or longer.\n\nWhen you plan to store your battery pack for a long time, be sure to charge the battery to around 60 – 80 percent capacity. Again, your batteries will self-discharge over time, so keeping a written record of when you put them in storage or most recently charged them can benefit you in the long run.\n\nAdditionally, we suggest charging your battery pack roughly every three months. While many modern lithium battery chargers have a fail-safe to prevent overcharging, we advise against leaving your battery on a charger for any extended charging period.\n\nFinding the Right Storage Area\n\nWhen figuring out how to store lithium batteries, you should consider several factors. Fortunately, it’s usually not too difficult to find adequate conditions in which to store these packs and keep them safe from damage. Here are just some of the things you should pay close attention to:\n\nTemperature\n\nUnlike many older lead-acid batteries, lithium battery packs have a much greater tolerance for extreme temperatures. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be careful. The ideal temperature range for a lithium battery pack in storage is between 35 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. No matter where the ambient temperature of your storage area falls within that range, you should try to keep that temperature as consistent as possible.\n\nLithium batteries are not likely to suffer any noticeable damage unless you store them at consistently extreme temperatures such as under 20 degrees or over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Nevertheless, keeping them at a comfortable temperature is ideal for battery longevity. Being stored outside the optimal temperature range for long periods may cause them to self-discharge faster and require more maintenance while in storage.\n\nLight\n\nYou don’t need to keep your lithium batteries in pitch blackness, but limiting light as much as possible is generally a good idea. Exposure to light, especially natural sunlight, may cause cosmetic damage and temperature changes that can negatively impact the inner workings of your batteries. So try to reduce exposure to harsh or overly direct sunlight and keep your batteries in a cooler, covered area to reduce the risk of any long term issues.\n\nHumidity\n\nIt’s usually not a good idea to mix batteries with water, and that same idea applies when you want to keep batteries in storage. While lithium batteries have self-contained structures that typically do a good job of keeping out excess moisture, you should always try to keep them in a dryer area with little to no humidity. If you live in an area with high humidity, we suggest keeping a dehumidifier or a desiccant bucket nearby. This will help keep some of the moisture from affecting your battery pack."
