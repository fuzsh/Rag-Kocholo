        "text": "Prismatic & Pouch Battery Packs\n\nMore and more lithium ion applications are utilizing prismatic or pouch cell (soft pack) designs which are an excellent way to reduce weight and cost, as well as optimize packaging efficiency at the battery level.\n\nPrismatic Cell Battery Packs\n\nIntroduced in the early 1990s, the prismatic cell satisfies the demand for thinner sizes and lower manufacturing costs. Wrapped in elegant packages resembling a box of chewing gum or a small chocolate bar, prismatic cells make optimal use of space by using the layered approach. These cells are predominantly found in mobile phones with lithium-ion. No universal format exists and each manufacturer designs its own. If the housing design allows a few millimeters extra in a cell phone or laptop, the manufacturer designs a new pack for the sake of higher capacity. High volume justifies this move.\n\nPrismatic Cell Battery Packs\n\nPrismatic cells are also making critical inroads into larger formats. Packaged in welded aluminum housings, the cells deliver capacities of 20 to 30Ah and are primarily used for electric powertrains in hybrid and electric vehicles. Figure 4shows the prismatic cell.\n\nThe prismatic cell requires a slightly thicker wall size to compensate for the decreased mechanical stability from the cylindrical design, resulting in a small capacity drop. Optimizing use of space makes up this loss. Prismatic cells for portable devices range from 400mAh to 2,000mAh.\n\nPrismatic cells are contained in a rectangular can. The electrodes are either stacked or in the form of a flattened spiral. They are usually designed to have a very thin profile for use in small electronic devices such as mobile phones. Prismatic cells provide better space utilization at the expense of slightly higher manufacturing costs, lower energy density and more vulnerability to swelling, but these are minor effects which don't constitute a major disadvantage.\n\nThe prismatic cell improves space utilization and allows flexible design but it can be more expensive to manufacture, less efficient in thermal management and have a shorter cycle life than the cylindrical design.\n\nLFP Prismatic Cells PN# 2614897-Fe-40 3914897-Fe-50 26148129-Fe-50 54173200-Fe-200 71173200-Fe-275 Typical Capacity (Ah) @0.2C 40 50 50 200 275 Nominal Voltage (V) 3.2 3.2 3.2 3.2 3.2 Dimension (mm) 148*27*97 148*40*103 148*27*129 173*53*207 173*71*207 Weight (g) 0.86 1.15 0.86 4.1 5.2 Internal Resistance (mΩ) 1 1 1 0.2 0.4 Discharge Continuous Discharge 3C 3C 3C 3C 3C Charge Standard 0.5C 0.5C 0.5C 0.5C 0.5C Max. 1C 1C 1C 1C 1C End Voltage (V) 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 Temperature Charge 0~45°C 0~45°C 0~45°C 0~45°C 0~45°C Discharge -20~60°C -20~60°C -20~60°C -20~60°C -20~60°C Life Cycle 2000 cycles 2000 cycles 2000 cycles 2000 cycles 2000 cycles\n\nPouch Cell Battery Packs\n\nIn 1995, the pouch cell surprised the battery world with a radical new design. Rather than using a metallic cylinder and glass-to-metal electrical feed-through for insulation, conductive foil tabs welded to the electrode and sealed to the pouch carry the positive and negative terminals to the outside.\n\nThe pouch cell makes the most efficient use of space and achieves a 90 to 95 percent packaging efficiency, the highest among battery packs. Eliminating the metal enclosure reduces weight but the cell needs some alternative support in the battery compartment.\n\nThe pouch cell offers a simple, flexible and lightweight solution to battery design. Exposure to high humidity and hot temperature can shorten service life.\n\nLFP Pouch Cells PN# F706094 F134295 F7075130 F1046148 F1187021 Typical Capacity (Ah) @0.2C 2.5 3.3 4.5 6 8 Nominal Voltage (V) 3.2 3.2 3.2 3.2 3.2 Dimension (mm) 96*61*7.2 97*43*13 132*76*7.1 150.47*10 127*88*21 Weight (g) 75 97 130 146 225 Internal Resistance (mΩ) 5 4 4 3 3.5 Discharge Continuous Discharge 30C 30C 30C 30C 30C Pulse Discharge 60C 2S 60C 2S 60C 2S 60C 2S 60C 2S End Voltage (V) 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 Charge Standard 0.5C 0.5C 0.5C 0.5C 0.5C Max. 1C 1C 1C 1C 1C End Voltage (V) 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 Temperature Charge 0~45°C 0~45°C 0~45°C 0~45°C 0~45°C Discharge -20~60°C -20~60°C -20~60°C -20~60°C -20~60°C Life Cycle 2000 cycles 2000 cycles 2000 cycles 2000 cycles 2000 cycles\n\nPouch Cell Applications\n\nThe pouch battery pack can be found in applications in consumer, military, as well as automotive industries. No standardized pouch cells exist, so each manufacturer builds the cells for a specific application. Pouch packs are commonly Li-polymer. Its specific energy is often lower and the cell is less durable than Li-ion in the cylindrical package.\n\nPouch Cell Battery Pack Inside Application\n\nSwelling Pouch Cells\n\nSwelling or bulging as a result of gas generation during charge and discharge is a concern. Battery manufacturers insist that these batteries do not generate excess gases that can lead to swelling. Nevertheless, excess swelling can occur and most is due to faulty manufacturing, and not misuse. Some dealers have failures due to swelling of as much as three percent on certain batches. The pressure from swelling can crack a battery cover, and in some cases break the display and electronic circuit board. Manufacturers say that an inflated cell is safe. While this may be true, do not puncture a swollen cell in close proximity to heat or fire; the escaping gases can ignite. Figure 6 shows a swelled pouch cell.\n\nPouch casings are typically used for Lithium Polymer cells with solid electrolytes, providing a low cost \"flexible\" (sometimes in unintended ways) construction. The electrodes and the solid electrolyte are usually stacked in layers or laminations and enclosed in a foil envelope. The solid electrolyte permits safer, leak-proof cells. The foil construction allows very thin and light weight cell designs suitable for high power applications but because of the lack of rigidity of the casing the cells are prone to swelling as the cell temperature rises. Allowance must be made for the possibility of swelling when choosing cells to fit a particular cavity specified for the battery compartment. The cells are also vulnerable to external mechanical damage and battery pack designs should be designed to prevent such possibilities.\n\nLooking For Prismatic or Pouch Cells?\n\nUpgrade your power systems with our li-ion prismatic and pouch cells.
