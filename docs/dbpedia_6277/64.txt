Dense crystalline thin films of Li2Si2O5 oriented in c‐axis were obtained by surface crystallisation of an as‐polished glass with the composition Li2O–2SiO2. Transparent samples with the surface crystallised Li2Si2O5 films on the glass were prepared which showed optical second harmonic generation. The orientation of the top crystalline layer was changed to b‐axis when ultrasonic surface treatment with an aqueous suspension containing Li2Si2O5 particles was applied before the heat treatment.
