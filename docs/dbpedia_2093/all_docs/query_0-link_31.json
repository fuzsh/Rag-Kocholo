This article looks at the local context of the governorship of Tang Yulin, at the role of Zhang Xueliang and regional leaders, and at the central government's involvement, principally through Song Ziwen (T.V. Soong), in order to understand China's failure in Rehe. This failure strongly influenced the subsequent Tanggu truce and affected the careers of Song and Zhang in the short term, but did not deter Jiang Jieshi from continuing his anti-communist encirclement campaigns.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nModern Asian Studies , Volume 42 , Issue 4 , July 2008 , pp. 733 - 750\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0026749X06002708 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2007\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

Its Japanese garrison, the Kantōgun, was originally created by Japan in 1905 to protect the Japanese-leased territory in Guandong, then known as Kwantung, and the South Manchurian Railway Zone.\n\n6\n\n6 Crossley, Pamela & Rawski, Evelyn, ‘A profile of the Manchu language in Ch'ing history’, Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 53, 1 (1993)CrossRefGoogle Scholar, p.95n suggests 1821 as the last year, but 1820, when the Jiaqing Emperor died in Rehe, seems more accurate, for the Daoguang Emperor no longer went there.
