        "text": "No matter what it took to get here, Jac Caglianone admitted he was excited to be in the Quad-Cities to start his professional baseball career.\n\nThe Kansas City Royals’ top pick in this summer’s draft made his debut with the River Bandits on Tuesday despite travel issues.\n\n“It was interesting to say the least,” Caglianone said of his travels from the Royals Arizona Complex on Monday, which included being diverted to Milwaukee en route to Chicago and then having to drive from the Windy City after finally getting there but missing the final connecting flight.\n\nDespite not getting into the Quad-Cities until almost 3 a.m. Tuesday, he was in the starting lineup against the Midwest League-leading Wisconsin Timber Rattlers and ripped his first professional base hit. In his third at-bat of the game, he drilled a fifth-inning double off the wall in right field, finishing 1-for-4. His double had an exit velocity of 110 miles per hour.\n\n“Emotions are high; I’m excited to be here,” the No. 6 pick in the 2024 draft said before the game. “It’s a very nice change of pace from the heat in Arizona. … This is the first step to hopefully a long journey, and I’m excited.”\n\nThere is plenty of excitement in the Royals’ organization over the two-way player signed to a $7-million dollar contract and what he might bring to the Big League club someday.\n\n“All that stuff is outside noise,” Caglianone said of the chatter regarding his contract and draft status. “At the end of the day — outside of what pick you were or anything — it’s the opportunity to be here and the opportunity to grow. … I’m just looking forward to playing some baseball.”\n\nHe got his career off to a good start in Arizona, opening eyes and earning his spot with the High Class A squad.\n\n“He was able to play in games, live BPs, and he had a really good week,” Royals Director of Player Development Mitch Maier said in a club-produced story. “And he’s ready to get out and get playing at one of the affiliates. Just seeing what he did in college and what he did this past week, we feel comfortable that he can go to Quad Cities and start his professional career there.\n\n“We’re really excited to get him out and get him going with the group and see what he can do.”\n\nStill, the 21-year-old Tampa, Florida, native tried to keep his focus simple ahead of his first pro at-bats.\n\n“In the grand scheme of things, it’s the same game you’ve played since you were little,” he said. “Not making the moment too big is the biggest thing for me. Just taking it one pitch at a time.”\n\nIf Tuesday’s batting practice was any indication, Caglianone is in for a bountiful career as a hitter — even if the 2024 John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year in college and a first-team All-American doesn’t return to the mound for a while.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe ball was just jumping off his bat during batting practice as he peppered the outfield wall with line drive after line drive, even knocking a pair over the wall in the power alley in right-center.\n\n“It’s impressive; he’s a big, strong guy,” QC manager Brooks Conrad said of Caglianone. “I like his swing, and I like the way his body moves. He was barreling up pretty much every ball out there today.\n\n“He’s impressive physically and also has a good idea how to get the bat to the ball. … Anybody who has power like him, it’s fun to go out there and watch him get into some.”\n\nThe former Gator — who ripped 35 homers in 65 games his senior season while slashing .419/.544/.875 — appreciated Tuesday’s BP and the return to a routine despite a lack of sleep.\n\n“It was really, really cool,” Caglianone said of his first pre-game session with his new team. “It’s every kid’s dream to play professional baseball, and this is kind of like that first step. … I made sure to take it all in.”\n\nCaglianone admitted he “feels like a Gypsy lately” going from the College Baseball World Series with the University of Florida to KC’s Arizona Spring Complex to the Midwest League in a matter of a month or so.\n\n“Hopefully I start to feel at home,” he said.\n\nHe joins a team that comes into the week with a 47-54 record but still in the hunt for a second-half playoff berth. He will try to adjust to his new surroundings and become the impact player the Royals hope he can be.\n\n“Honestly, just trying to get my feet wet and get acclimated to pro ball and get a feel for the game at this level,” Caglianone said of his hopes for the final five weeks of the season. “Grow as a player and figure out strengths and weaknesses and what to work on.”\n\nConrad had some lasting first impressions of the 6-foot-5, 250-pounder.\n\n“First impression is probably his size,” Conrad said of the hulking first-baseman/pitcher with a chuckle. “He’s an imposing figure. He is a big ol’ guy, and you shake his hand and yours disappears.”\n\nConrad said that the plan was to monitor his adjustment as they gave him as much experience as possible in the final 30 games of the regular season.\n\nThe QC manager, chasing his 300th managerial victory, believes this is a great place for Caglianone to get things rolling in the final five weeks of the season.\n\n“We’ve got a good group of guys here, and he’s not going to have any problems fitting into this clubhouse,” Conrad said. “These guys go about their business and have fun playing the game. … I think it’s a good clubhouse to come to and a good situation for him to come to. He can be himself and just come and play ball.”\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nTom Johnston\n\nsports writer/golf editor\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
