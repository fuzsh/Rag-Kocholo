THE STRUGGLE FOR COMPLETE LIQUIDATION OF BANDITS IN THE NEWLY LIBERATID AREAS OF CHINA I In the first half of 1950, with the enthusiastic assistance of the local people in the respective areas, the People's Liberation Army launched its`bandia liquidating campaign in the newly liberated areas of Southwest, Central and South, Northwest, and East China any concluded it with a successful victory. According 'to the first draft of statistics, some 40,000 bandits were liquidated in those 6 months. At present, with the exception of certain areas in Fukien, Kwangtung, Kwangsi, and Western Hunan, bandit groups in East, Central South, and Northwest China have been basically destroyed. The bandits' strength in Southwest China has received a crushing blow. Bandits who had caused considerable trouble or had created rather serious tensions in other areas have als. been practically -.eliminated. In the immediate future, one of the most important tasks of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Militia in the respective areas is to continue destroying the remnants of bandit.groups still scattered in the Southwest, Kwang- tung, Kwangsi, Western Hunan, and Fukien who are still causing much trouble to the local people in out-of-the-way places. Remnants of the Kuomintang Army have turned into bandits and have conspired with the local feudal elements and profes- sional bandits to cause trouble,) IM making conditions extremely complex and our task of liquidating them very difficult. However, our undaunted Liberation Army, wih its oglorious the resppeectiveiareas,will continueitoco- thet People's elentlessly Ple follow faithfully the pronouncement of Chairman Mao that \"We are a fighting team, also a working team.\" They will penetrate deeply into the farm villages in rally- ing; the masses to implement land reform, to carry out the program of rent reduc- tion, and to wage war against bandits and local blackguards under the guidance of hne'eeht Pebp1b1rew,o i, rhmeut.

In the Northwest, the bandit groups in the various areas have been eliminated, and thus tr..ansportationb- lines in that area have been made safe, lished. At the same time, the people, who had been much troubled by the bandits, are now returning to their homes to pursue their normal productive activities. The guiding principles of the People\"s Liberation Army in eliminating bandits are military suppression, political reindoctrination, and rallying and uniting the masses. By examining its experiences in various regions, tt has developed the following three procedures to accomplish its tasko The first procedure is based mainly on military suppression in conjunction with political offensive, aimed at eliminating bandit groups anddeefeattingg heirgth main forces. When launching a -bandit-liquidating campaign, superior is concentrated to ccnfront the bandit groups with a determined attack. After the block- bandit are defeated employed a to liquidate remnants of by such ade and not giving them a minute's respite. The second procedure is based mainly on political offensive in conjunction with military isolation. The masses are rallied to assist in rounding up the ringleaders and eliminating scattered bandits. When the a numberrmed arecalrin- ing toward areas in which bandits are operating, a large habitants may fear coming in contact with the People's Liberation Army, and others may even leave due to the bandits' threats. Undeuchon itions, the PeOple'sm- Liberation Army will try to propagate the army principles portance and objectives of liquidating the bandits, and the determination of the Central People's Government to eradicate bandits, asking the people not to assist bandits but to aid the government's campaign by giving information. Because the people have been much annoyed by the bandits, they have a deep hatred for them, and only with patient treatment will they eventually conquer their fear and aid bandit-suppression units. For example, once a citizen of Ni*''~=tong in An-shun .seen, Kweichow Province, raced 40 li fone li equals 1/3 mill '.-to the headquarters of the bandit-suppression unit to give information. The people's warmicl vePfor- their army is very moving. During the battle at Yang iWe ? when the People's Liberation Army had gone without food or water for 2 days, the local populace, upon their own initiative, sent food and water to their positions. In fostering political disintegration of bandit groups, the policy of leni- ene y and determined suppression is employed, pointing out to the bandits that if they do not surrender, the only road left open to them is teat d policy , whle towardnthose who truly repent the People's Liberation Army will adopt of en. Therefore, in all areas, fostering of political disintegration has given outstand- ing accomplishments; the inner circles of the bandit intelligence headquarters are being shaken; and the numbers of those who surrender or repent have multiplied. For example, in the Southwest Military Region, the number which surrendered in March was 20 percent of the total number of bandits, in April it was 34 percent, and in May it reached 54 percent, while in Eastern and Northern Szechuanu PProvince, the number ranged from 60 percent to 80 percent. Also, in breaking up groups, attention is paid. to families and relatives. They are invited to round- table discussions, where the government's liberal and lenient policies are ex- plained, as well as its determination to suppress the bandits, and they are told -4- CONFIDENTIAL F I n, Pill Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/09/21: CIA-RDP80-00809A000700010255-6 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/09/21: CIA-RDP80-00809A000700010255-6 I not'to'miss the excellent opportunities offered them of persuading the bandits to repent, returm.to their own homes, and engage in productive work. A mother of a bandit at pi-ahan in Szechuan province, when she understood the policies of the People's Liberation Army in liquidating bandits, by crying and begging, persuaded her 'son to surrender. The third procedure ib to rally the masses to support the government in liquidating scattered bandits and local blackguards, with the 'aim of uprooting the bandits' sources of supply and destroying the feudal exploitation of the farm villages.
