Our culture can be unforgiving if you're unable to conform to standard concert etiquette. This can exclude individuals who are unable to sit still or who may express emotions such as joy or excitement through vocalization. This relaxed, sensory-friendly concert aims to remove barriers, allowing everyone to be themselves and enjoy a musical experience in a safe and judgement-free environment.\n\nYour experience includes:\n\nA relaxed, family-friendly concert environment that embraces neurodiversity.\n\nAn information guide and social narrative to help you prepare for the event.\n\nA limited number of Sensory Toolkits containing fidget toys and noise-reducing headphones, available for use during the event.\n\nAn indoor quiet room to take a break.\n\nMovement and dancing during the concert are welcome!\n\nFlexible seating: Bring your own picnic blanket or lawn chairs and choose how close you’d like to be to the stage and speakers during the concert.\n\nLimited audience size for reduced crowds.\n\nTrained event staff: The Mid-Michigan Autism Association has provided training to our staff to help them better understand the characteristics of autism and how to better communicate and support autistic individuals.\n\nPlease contact Kiersten Alcorn, Manager of Community Engagement, at kalcorn@dso.org with any accessibility questions.\n\nMade possible by Gilbert Family Foundation."
