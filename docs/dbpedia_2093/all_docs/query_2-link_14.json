        "meta_description": "The bandido or bandit uprisings that began in 1959 had their origins in the resistance of some peasants to agrarian reform. Many small property owners with a few coffee trees or tobacco plants or a small cattle herd feared the redistribution of private lands. Many landless rural laborers also joined the fight against the comunistas who administered the agrarian reforms. The Castro Regime maintained that the “real” peasants supported the Revolution. Indeed, rural residents who benefitted positively from land reform did fill out the militia units that fought the “bandits” in the Escambray Mountains and elsewhere on the island. The Cuban counterrevolution, in this regard, compares to the Vendée in France, the Cristero Revolt in Mexico, the kulaks of Russia, and the Contra Movement of Nicaragua.

        "text": "4Thousands of revolutionary militiamen pursued several small bands of outlaws throughout 1960, yet the number of bandidos rose. Osvaldo’s group dispersed and escaped encirclement on several occasions, only to regroup later on. Ramírez himself was captured and escaped miraculously by throwing himself over another, higher cliff.\n\n6Castro’s accusation contained an element of truth. Urban allies belonging to the Auténtico Party network in Havana had been using connections to the CIA at the American Embassy to direct air drops into the Escambray for Osvaldo’s alzados. Presidnt Eisenhower closed the embassy in January 1961, which complicated the delivery of arms. Thereafter, Auténtico operatives in Havana had to make arrangements by radio with Miami. Nonetheless, government forces recovered most air drops and some of the equipment landed by boat as well.\n\n8Finally in April 1961, news of the Bay of Pigs invasion gave the alzados a welcome respite in April 1961, as Castro’s militia units left the Escambray to converge on Playa Girón. Many volunteers in Osvaldo Ramírez’s band believed that final victory against Castro’s communist regime was close at hand.\n\n9The following tells the story of the rural rebels who resisted the revolutionary state. The rural rebellion attracted disaffected residents all over the island nation, not just in the hotbed of the Escambray. Whereas the Gusano Counterrevolution reflected urban middle class resistance, the bandido affair concerned smallholders and their rural allies. Cuba’s rural counterrevolution from 1959 to 1965 had even deeper roots in the peasantry than did Fidel’s M26. Therefore, in order to discount the farmer origins of the anti-Castro movement, the very same revolutionary leaders who exaggerated the peasants’ contributions to the struggle against Batista had to explain away the greater role they played in the anti-Castro rebellion. Revolutionaries now decried the isolation, ignorance, and misguided fanaticism of Cuba’s rural residents as relics of the pre-revolutionary era. Thus they dug up the word bandido, the term by which the Spaniards defamed the rebels of the independence war and Batista used to describe Castro’s guerrillas.\n\n10Remarkably, the rural Bandido Counterrevolution outlasted the Gusano Counterrevolution. The Bay of Pigs invasion of April 1961 spelled the end of the urban middle class opposition in Havana and other cities. Yet the Castro’s government did not extinguish resistance in the countryside until mid-1965. Despite the Revolutionary State’s overwhelming repression, how did the Bandido Counterrevolution endure so long ?\n\n11The answer had to do with the origins of the alzados. The rural rebellion arose not from traditional capitalist exploitation on plantations but from the rapid transformation of social relationships that the Revolution had set in motion. True, the regime’s land reform decree ended the unjust plantation system in Cuba. But it also created an institution, the INRA, that intervened in the daily lives of an independent peasantry that had existed at the margins of the sugar industry. The National Agrarian Reform Institute became the instrument by which the revolutionaries mobilized rural residents to socialize the economy. Such rapid change was bound to meet resistance, which in turn propelled the government to invest greater resources in pacifying the countryside. In the time of Osvaldo Ramírez, armed resistance sprouted like thorny marabú bushes in some of the remotest parts of the countryside. Guerrilla warfare resumed in Cuba because of agrarian reform.\n\n12However, these rural guerrillas of the 1960s differed greatly from Castro’s fighters of the late 1950s. The alzados mainly fought in small groups without an effective centralizing leadership. The size of Oswaldo Ramírez’s outlaw gang in 1961 did not at all fit the norm. Therefore, the government’s defeat of one band of resisters merely led to new uprisings elsewhere until exhaustion set in after six whole years of rural unrest. The linkage to political rivalries of the 1950s contained some relevance in the beginning. Rural rebels also had support from Cuban political exiles abroad which, in the 1960s, remotely connected the rebels to the Central Intelligence Agency. However, following the Bay of Pigs debacle, Washington recognized the futility of trying to support the alzados and drew down its active assistance.\n\nCleansing the Escambray\n\n14The first bandido uprisings occurred relatively simultaneously in the late summer of 1959 within two to three months following Fidel’s land reform decree. Rebels escaped to the Órganos Mountains of Pinar del Río on the western end of the island republic. They gathered up arms in the hills of Matanzas overlooking the lowland sugar plantations dating from the eighteen century. Resistance sprouted also in the highlands of Las Villas and Camagüey in the center of the island. Even in Oriente Province where loyalties to Fidel Castro remained strong, some mountain people found cause to alzarse, to rise in revolt, in the recent M26 strongholds of the Sierra Maestra and the Sierra del Cristal. [See map 6.1.]\n\n15Traditional sugar plantations did not characterize these locations. Rather one found smallholders, tenant farmers, and guajiro squatters. Some residents of these highland zones went down to the plantations to cut cane during the zafra. However, few of these mountain men belonged to powerful pre-revolutionary organizations such as the Union of Sugar Mill Workers and the Association of Landowners (colonos). After the revolution triumphed, rural resistance sprang up in the most remote areas of the countryside. But the heartland of rebellion spread in all directions from the highest elevation, Topes de Collantes, in the mountains of the Escambray. This location constituted the area of operations of Osvaldo Ramírez and his successors.\n\nCauses\n\n20The struggle itself justified the increasing intrusion into the countryside by agents of the revolutionary state. Conferences took place. Instructions went out. Political and military authorities scrutinized the rural population like never before. One “order of the day” for the Escambray in September 1961 instructed local authorities to take the pulse of the people to see\n\n14 Ejército Rebelde, “Orden del día de la conferencia del Escambray,” 24 Sep 1961, doc. 503-(4.1), MLC (...)\n\n“if the guajiros [peasants] are understanding the Revolution better ; if they are liberating themselves from the influence of the old bosses ; if they are disposed to joining up with the local militias ; if they can still be attracted by the alzados ; or if they assist in collaborating with them and helping them.”\n\nThe Rebels\n\n22The rebel groups existed as decentralized, dispersed, and short-lived groups. They differed greatly from the previous anti-Batista resistance bands of the late 1950s that had grown exponentially over a period of two years. Fidel’s own M26 in Oriente Province had developed into a rural fighting force of three thousand armed men with a central command structure. In the Escambray Mountains, the Second Front of Comandantes Menoyo and Morgan, claimed to number two thousand men. In contrast, the rebel bands of the early 1960s averaged less than twenty men. Few alzados remained in the field more than a few months ; only a handful stayed in the fight beyond one year. The difference depended on the response of the government. Batista’s army did not press the rebels, and the Castro military forces gave them no quarter.\n\n26Despite the fact that the government claimed the allegiance of the peasantry, many campesinos (farmers) and rural workers figured among those detained by government forces.\n\nThe Militias\n\nThe United States\n\n42American intelligence agents operated out of the U.S. Embassy in Havana during the first two years of the Cuban Revolution. Apparently, the revolutionaries believed that the CIA’s presence close at hand helped them more than hindered the process of consolidation. Fidel did not expel embassy personnel in January 1961. They left of their own accord because the Eisenhower White House knew the men of Brigade 2506 were preparing to invade Cuba.\n\n49After the Bay of Pigs, American intelligence agents either lost interest in the Bandido Revolution or received little information on it. The extensive CIA reports on Cuba deposited in the Kennedy and Johnson Presidential Libraries contain little on the alzados. Even the Miami Cubans forgot about them. For all money that the CIA was pouring into Manuel Artime’s commando operation (see Chapter 6), he did not have much communication with the Bandido Counterrevolution.\n\n51The FDR and MRR at the time were receiving the largest share of CIA funding in Miami.\n\n53Still, the Bandido Counterrevolution lingered on until mid-1965. CIA responsibility for rebellion in the countryside seems exaggerated.\n\nOsvaldo’s story concluded\n\n57In July 1961, Osvaldo Ramírez gathered together several other bandit chieftains and proclaimed himself commander in chief of the National Liberation Army. By then, he had become famous for having killed the Afro-Cuban literacy teacher Conrado Benítez as well as other representatives of the revolutionary state. Ramírez appointed six captains to head up guerrilla activities in six combat zones throughout Las Villas and Camagüey Provinces. Despite the image of command and control, the separate groups within his command operated on their own. Other resistance leaders in the region did not acknowledge Osvaldo’s authority. Militia patrols kept them all in survival mode rather than on the offensive.\n\nStruggle against the bandits, 1962-1965\n\n68Still no single victory proved decisive. For every three bands of alzados rounded up, two others popped up elsewhere. The capture and killing of no single leader ended the uprising until the dissidents became exhausted and accepted the presence of state institutions in the countryside. The INRA organized and managed the collective farms fashioned out of the big plantations. The ANAP brought the private farmers under state control.\n\n71Many G-2 recruits in the early 1960s served in the Struggle Against the Bandits. Seventy-seven men of them died in action from January 1960 to June 1965. They lost their lives confronting counterrevolutionaries attempting a boat landing or a seaborne arms drop ; others, in the act of apprehending suspected collaborators. Intelligence agents also died in firefights with alzados or attempting to prevent the illegal emigration of armed opponents.\n\nEpitaph for revolutionary violence\n\n78Nationwide, the bandidos fielded nearly 300 separate bands of anti-Castro rebels. In the Escambray itself, 177 outlaw gangs had operated, most on a short-term basis, between September 1959 and July 1965. Two thousand combatants had taken up arms and at least 6,000 collaborators had participated in the anti-Castro uprising. The people of the Escambray bore about one-half the burden in the fight against the Revolution.\n\n81Evidence taken from Cuban sources suggest an alternative narrative. It indicates that the counterrevolution in the countryside had powerful organic origins. The appeal of bandadismo stemmed from the discomfort of some rural producers felt toward rapid social change. Mass mobilizations disrupted the normal rhythms of rural life. The invasion of the countryside by the National Agrarian Reform Institute altered the structures of producing, buying, and selling agricultural products. Those who benefitted by the new order – and they appeared to have been in the majority –remained loyal to the Revolution. Those who calculated that they might lose out acted on their resentments.\n\n82True, the CIA did encourage Cuba’s rural rebellion. The bandidos could have been collaborators, a fifth column that might provide American policymakers with allies in overthrowing the first socialist republic in the Western Hemisphere. But the obstacles to American interference in Cuba’s rural affairs remained powerful. CIA incompetence in delivering arms to the alzados figures as the greatest drawback. Dedication of the militiamen is another. Lack of communication is a third. Historians should not automatically accept the government’s explanations emphasizing “ignorance.” To do so would rob the rural people of their agency. The evidence demonstrates much agency being exercised by those who chose to flee into the mountains. The outlaws won few victories in six years of fighting, and still newcomers ran away to take up arms.\n\n83The analyst has to come back to the political instincts of Fidel Castro. His masterful consolidation of revolutionary power enabled him to coordinate all the state agencies in quelling the internal rebellion. The ministries and the mass organizations snapped to his orders. Teachers, security agencies, police, militiamen, officers and soldiers, agrarian officials, neighborhood committees, and communist administers, peasant leaders—all marched to his commands. Moreover, he used the strength of both Gusano and Bandido Counterrevolutions to heighten the dedication of his followers. CIA meddling merely raised their enthusiasm for the Revolution.\n\n84The historian has to answer one more important question. If Washington did not control and direct the bandido insurrection, why did it end at the precise moment in 1965 that President Johnson transfered the anti-communist campaign from Cuba to Vietnam ? The White House shut down Manuel Artime’s commandos and the Miami CIA station simultaneously."
