Has limited battery.\n\nMODERN WARFARE ZOMBIES OVERVIEW (MWZ)\n\nCONTENT SUMMARY (Mid-Season):\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nThe Dark Aether Story Continues: Saving Dr. Jansen (Mid-Season)\n\nCONTENT SUMMARY:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nFactory and Office: Clad in muddy white corrugated metal, the Factory is the largest feature on the southwestern shoreline. This commanding, three-floor building and basement comes with an exterior gantry overlooking the dockside and Harbor, and ascenders offer rapid access to the rooftop. Inside are control rooms, with a lower floor midsized storage room half-filled with barrels and boxes. This is where you’ll find a long concrete tunnel hallway with covered access to and from the Factory. Toward Stronghold is a single-level brick office with a pitched roof and views across the docks.\n\nDockside and Freighter: One of the lowest-lying areas on the map, the docks provide a straight and flat route around the Factory, with a crane, tower, tram station platform, and docked freighter to utilize for climbing or cover. The red hull of the freighter is visible to spot at distance, and the ship has a larger top deck compared to the yellow freighter moored at Dock.\n\nLiving Quarters\n\nAvailable on: Rebirth Resurgence Modes.\n\nAnnounced during infil, if this public event is activated, it allows you some added protection, enabling the equipping of an additional Armor Plate for the duration of the match. The extra plate slot is visible above your health bar where plate information is normally seen:\n\nThis increases your Operator’s Armor Hit Points from 150 to 200.\n\nThe extra plate slot is applied no matter the plate carrier type you have equipped (standard 3-plate, Communications Vest, Medic Vest, Stealth Vest, or Tempered Plate Carrier).\n\nYou begin the match with an additional plate equipped.\n\nExcept for the Tempered Plate Carrier, you have four filled plates at the start of a match. 200 Health, 50 Health per plate.\n\nThe Tempered Plate Carrier, if equipped, has three plates, with the third one partially filled at the start of a match. A full Tempered Plate Carrier has 200 Health, 66.7 Health per plate.\n\nAdjust your tactics accordingly, as this Public Event allows you to last longer between re-plating and lengthens the TTK and ammo expenditure when downing foes.\n\nNew Mission Contract: Spy Drones (Launch)\n\nAvailable on: Rebirth Island.\n\nIt’s back! The most prized Perk possession in all of Call of Duty: Warzone returns! This hexagon of omnipotence may be incredibly difficult to discover — in fact, it’s only very rarely found at a [[REDACTED]] or in specific [[REDACTED]] — but its effectiveness cannot be understated. Once found, this grants you every applicable Perk in the game and continues to function even if you subsequently access your Loadout Drop with your chosen Perks. In addition to the default Perks available to all Operators (Tac Pads, Commando Gloves, Quick-Grip Gloves, Climbing Boots, and Overkill), Specialist grants you the advantages of the following 29 additional Perks, but only for the remainder of the match:\n\nPerk Slots 1 and 2 (all Perks active): Battle Hardened, Double Time, E.O.D., Focus, Irradiated, Mechanic, Mountaineer, Scavenger, Shrapnel, Sleight of Hand, Spotter, Strong Arm.\n\nPerk Slot 3 (all Perks active): Cold-Blooded, Escapist, Payout, Primed, Quick Fix, Resupply, Stalker, Survivor, Tempered, Tracker.\n\nPerk Slot 4 (all Perks active): Birdseye, Combat Scout, Flex, Ghost, High Alert, Resolute, Shrouded.\n\nUpdated Movement: Aquatic Gameplay Comes to Rebirth Island! (Launch)\n\nAvailable on: Rebirth Island.\n\nDotted around Rebirth Island’s upgraded communications facilities is a series of 10 Biometric Scanners, terminals that include full biometric scanning capabilities. Once per match where these Scanners are active, you can approach a Biometrics Scanner and quickly check your statistics. The Scanner produces a Keycard based on your identity (placed directly into your Backpack), along with an XP reward. Inspect the Keycard, and you’ll see it contains your Operator name, Clan Tag, and Access Level.\n\nKeycards: These take up a slot in your Backpack, can be dropped or looted, and can unlock a special menu in any Rebirth Island Buy Station for the duration of the remaining match.\n\nKeycard Rarity: There are six different rarities of Keycard:\n\nBronze (common)\n\nSilver (relatively common)\n\nGold (uncommon)\n\nPlatinum (rare)\n\nPolyatomic (very rare)\n\nOrion (incredibly rare)\n\nThe percentage chance of receiving a specific rarity is [[REDACTED]], but your chances improve if a squadmate is close by during a scan, or if you repeat the scanning process in the next few days.\n\nBuy Station Access and In-Match Rewards: Bring your Keycard, or one you’ve looted from the corpse of a foe to any Rebirth Island Buy Station, and a special Keycard menu will be accessible, based on the highest card you have in your possession. General examples of expected items from each Keycard menu are as follows (with any Equipment and Perks selected from your favorite Loadout):\n\nBronze: Random ammunition, Cash ($), Armor Plates, Lethals, and Tacticals.\n\nSilver: Random ammunition, Cash ($$), Armor Plates, Lethals, Tacticals, Perk Package.\n\nGold: Random ammunition, Cash ($$$), Armor Plates, Lethals, Tacticals, Perk Package, Plate Carrier, Field Upgrade.\n\nPlatinum: Random ammunition, Cash ($$$$), Armor Plates, Lethals, Tacticals, Perk Package, Plate Carrier, Field Upgrade, Killstreak.\n\nPolyatomic: [[REDACTED]] free equipment selects at the Buy Station, [[REDACTED]] Weapon.\n\nOrion: [[REDACTED]] free equipment selects at the Buy Station, [[REDACTED]] Weapons, additional [[REDACTED]].\n\nAdditional and Permanent In-Game Rewards: There is growing evidence that returning to a Biometric Scanner on subsequent but nonconsecutive visits may unlock a variety of additional assets — including camouflage for your armaments — as well as communications deemed “Most Secret.” No further details have been authorized.\n\nNew Feature: Variable Time of Day (In-Season)\n\nThe preceding image (above) shows the three main landing examples (this is for demonstration purposes only). The circle radii shown don’t appear on your in-game Tac Map. When your first teammate lands, they create a small radius around them, roughly the size shown in the previous image. The rest of the team simply needs to land within that radius to “land together,” as follows:\n\nFull Squad Landing (Quads): All four Operators’ landing radii overlap with at least one other.\n\nFull Squad Landing (Trios): All three Operators’ landing radii overlap with at least one other.\n\nTwo Half Squad Landing (Quads): Two pairs of Operators land separately, with each pair’s landing radius overlapping.\n\nMajority Squad Landing (Quads): Three of the four Operators land with overlapping radii, and one Operator lands separately.\n\nMajority Squad Landing (Trios): Two of the three Operators land with overlapping radii, and one Operator lands separately.\n\nDuo Squad Landing (Duos): For Duos, both squadmates need to land with their radii overlapping.\n\nIn-Match Rewards: Did your team successfully land (somewhat) together? You’ll know if you did, as you’re awarded XP, Cash, and even a special Supply UAV revealing legendary and personal loot cache locations across the nearby vicinity.\n\nMark the Landing Destination: Each squad member receives XP if any teammate pings the location where you land before the first squad member touches the ground.\n\nFull Squad Landing (Quads, Trios): Land as a full squad for a sizeable XP and Cash bonus, as well as a Supply UAV.\n\nMajority Squad Landing (Quads, Trios): Land with two other members (Quads) or one other member (Trios) for a reasonably XP and Cash bonus, as well as a Supply UAV.\n\nHalf Squad or Duo Squad Landing (Quads, Duos): Land with one other teammate (Quads) or land with your teammate (Duos) and both of you receive a modest XP and Cash bonus.\n\nReturning Feature: Weapon Trade Station (In-Season)\n\nAvailable on: Rebirth Island.\n\nThe newly improved Weapon Trade Station (WTS-2) is currently being installed across Rebirth Island for an in-season activation. This acts in a similar manner to the previous version. Access this reinforced locker and trade an unwanted weapon for one of lesser quality and some extra loot. The quality of the weapon you trade in is related to its rarity, which is a measurement of how many attachments the weapon has. Each rarity has an associated color in the info box you view when you pick up a weapon:\n\nCommon Weapon (Gray): 0 or 1 Attachment\n\nUncommon Weapon (Green): 2 Attachments\n\nRare Weapon (Blue): 3 Attachments\n\nEpic Weapon (Purple): 4 Attachments\n\nLegendary Weapon (Orange): 5 Attachments\n\nUltra Weapon (Orange): 5+ Attachments\n\nThe rarity of the weapon you receive is two levels “more common” than the weapon you dropped into the Weapon Trade Station. For example, if you find an Epic Rarity weapon with four attachments, you can trade it in for an Uncommon weapon with two attachments, plus a random assortment of additional items, at the Weapon Trade Station.\n\nAdditional Weapon Trade Station items that are dropped at the completion of the trade can include ammo, cash, equipment (Tacticals, Lethals, Field Upgrades, Killstreaks, Gas Masks), and — on very rare occasions if you’re incredibly lucky and trade a formidable weapon — the Specialist Perk Token!\n\nUnsubstantiated Intel (Launch)\n\nAs with Multiplayer Ranked, there are a few rewards reminders you should be aware of. Players can earn Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play: Resurgence rewards in three ways:\n\nRank Rewards: Available at launch and can be earned in any season. Players can continue their previous Rank grind in Season 3.\n\nSeason Rewards: Available at the start of a season and only available in that season.\n\nEnd of Season Rewards: Rewards that are awarded after the season has ended and represent either your highest attained division or an active placement in the Top 250 Division. Season 3 brings new Seasonal Weapon Camos to unlock in Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play: Resurgence!\n\nNew Season 3 Rewards: Throughout Season 3, you can earn the following rewards related to your match placement, as well as your Kills and Assists:\n\nPlacement Challenges:\n\nFinish in the Top 15, 25 Times: “Eat.

These Skins are the same as the ones you can unlock in Modern Warfare III Multiplayer Ranked Play.\n\nOnce you unlock the Skins from one Skill Division, you can permanently use them in the future seasons of Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Warzone:\n\nGold Competitor Skin (Male and Female, SpecGru and KorTac): Reach this division.\n\nPlatinum Competitor Skin (Male and Female, SpecGru and KorTac): Reach this division.\n\nDiamond Competitor Skin (Male and Female, SpecGru and KorTac): Reach this division.\n\nCrimson Competitor Skin (Male and Female, SpecGru and KorTac): Reach this division.\n\nIridescent Competitor Skin (Male and Female, SpecGru and KorTac): Reach this division.\n\nTop 250 Competitor Skin (Male and Female, SpecGru and KorTac): Reach this division.\n\nSeason 3 Ranked First Place Player: The player who finishes Season 3 in the No. 1 position on the Top 250 Leaderboard will receive ultimate bragging rights and the following prestigious rewards:\n\n#1 Overall: “MWIII Season #1 Overall” Animated Calling Card\n\n#1 Overall: “MWIII Season #1 Overall” Animated Emblem\n\nIf you need a refresher on Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play Resurgence for Call of Duty: Warzone, consult the Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play Guide here.
