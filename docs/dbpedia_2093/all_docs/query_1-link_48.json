        "text": "The Battle of Bamianshan was a battle fought between the nationalists and the communists during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era and resulted in communist victory. Order of battle: Nationalists: Temporarily Organized 1st Army Communists: 141st Division of the communist 47th Army Bamianshan, meaning Eight Sided Mountain literally, is located 10 km to the north of the town of Liye in the border region of Hunan, Sichuan and Hubei. The difficult terrain made it ideal as a hideout for bandits, which had plagued the local region for more than a century. By the end of 1949, the bandits were led by Shi Xingzhou. In late December 1949, the nationalist Temporarily Organized 1st Army led by its commander Chen Zixian withdrew to the mountains and convinced the local bandits to join them, fighting the communists together. The nationalists planned to use the mountain as a guerilla base to launch operations against their communist enemy. In mid-January 1950, the 141st Division of the communist 47th Army was tasked to exterminate the nationalist guerrillas and the division began its intensive training in mountain warfare.\n\nThe Battle of Baoying was a part of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post-World War II era. The battle was fought in the Baoying region in central Jiangsu. It was a clash between the communists and the former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force who rejoined the nationalists after World War II. The battle resulted in a communist victory.\n\nThe Battle of Dachen Archipelago was a struggle between the Nationalists and the Communists for the control of several archipelagos just off the coast of Zhejiang, China during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era, and it was part of the First Taiwan Strait Crisis. The Communists targeted and eventually took the Dachen Archipelago, and the other two smaller archipelagos from Nationalists: the Southern Muntjac Archipelago and the Southern Deer Mountain Archipelago."
