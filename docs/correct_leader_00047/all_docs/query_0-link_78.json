        "text": "Senior MEPs have asked officials to provide more detailed options, including estimated costs, before they decide whether to tear down or refurbish the European Parliament’s main building in Brussels.\n\nParliament officials say the Paul-Henri Spaak building is coming to the end of its life and has major structural problems. Completed in 1993 at a cost of 42 billion Belgian francs (just over €1 billion), it was acquired by Parliament for €303 million between 1993 and 1995.\n\nThe Parliament’s administration, headed by Secretary-General Klaus Welle, prepared a note for MEPs last month informing them of the state of play — and nudged them in the direction of tearing down the building and starting again, rather than renovating the existing structure.\n\nBut at a meeting on Monday, the Parliament’s Bureau, which includes the institution’s President Antonio Tajani and 14 vice presidents, asked the administration to present a more detailed summary of potential options.\n\nOne official said there was “panic” among MEPs about the building’s problems, with lawmakers fearing they could approve a construction project whose costs would spiral out of control.\n\n“The proposals should address all potential options under discussion. These include, inter alia, no action, renovation and reconstruction,” the Parliament said in a statement.\n\n“The proposals should be accompanied by detailed assessments on the feasibility of the projects, in particular as regards to the duration and cost, and address any relevant legal matters, especially with regard to liability issues.”\n\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “There is panic because they might have to sign a decision that will cost three times more than what will be on paper.”\n\nThe building includes the “Hemicycle” where plenaries take place when Parliament holds sessions in Brussels, as well as Tajani’s office.\n\nThe Parliament has been looking at the problem for years: In 2010, the Paul-Henri Spaak building was included in a list of sites needing major works; and in 2015, the Parliament’s in-house directorate general for property presented a confidential cost estimate for three options, from renovation to rebuilding.\n\nRebuilding, said that in-house document, “reflects the real institutional ambitions of the Institution” and “answers the serious security matters relating to the structural stability of the building.”\n\nAccording to that in-house estimate, rebuilding would require an investment of €430 million at 2015 prices, plus or minus 10 percent.\n\nThis article was updated to include how much the Parliament paid for the building."
