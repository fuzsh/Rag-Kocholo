        "text": "The Espace Léopold is the complex of parliament buildings in Brussels housing the European Parliament, a legislative chamber of the European Union.\n\nIt consists of a number of buildings, primarily the oldest, the Paul-Henri Spaak building, which houses the debating chamber and the President's offices, and the Altiero Spinelli building which is the largest. The buildings are located in the European quarter in the east of Brussels, with building starting in 1989.\n\nThe complex is not the official seat of Parliament, which is the Immeuble Louise Weiss in Strasbourg, France, but as most of the other institutions of the European Union are in Brussels, Parliament built the Brussels complex to be closer to their activities. A majority of the Parliament's work is now geared to its Brussels site, but it is legally bound to keep Strasbourg as its official home.\n\nSight description based on Wikipedia.\n\nCreate Your Own Walk in Brussels\n\nCreating your own self-guided walk in Brussels is easy and fun.
