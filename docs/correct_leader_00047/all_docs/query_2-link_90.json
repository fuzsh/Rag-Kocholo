        "text": "Maltese MEP Roberta Metsola has been re-elected as President of the European Parliament, making history once again. This significant achievement marks the first time a woman will serve two consecutive terms in this prestigious role, reinforcing Metsola’s legacy in European politics.\n\nSince its establishment in 1952, the European Parliament has seen 33 Presidents, including iconic figures such as Paul Henri Spaak and Robert Schuman. Metsola, who first took office in January 2022, became the 33rd President and only the third woman to hold the position. Her predecessors, Simone Veil (1979) and Nicole Fontaine (1999), were both trailblazing Frenchwomen. As the first Maltese and the youngest President ever, Metsola has broken multiple barriers.\n\nThe election process for the European Parliament President is outlined in the Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, specifically rules 14 to 16. The outgoing President, or one of the Vice-Presidents, oversees the election. Eight tellers, chosen by lot from among the MEPs, ensure the integrity of the process.\n\nThe 10th legislature of the European Parliament began its session today in Strasbourg, with the election of the President as the first item on the agenda. The session was opened by Metsola herself, who then handed over proceedings to Vice-President.\n\nToday, after the ballots were counted, Roberta Metsola was re-elected, becoming the first female President to serve two consecutive terms and the second President overall to achieve this, following German Socialist Martin Schulz (2012-2017).\n\nUpon her re-election, Metsola delivered a powerful address, emphasising her commitment to the values of the European Union and the challenges ahead. She reaffirmed her dedication to the Parliament’s role in shaping EU policies and representing the citizens of Europe.\n\nAs President, Metsola will continue to wield extensive executive and representative powers. Her role is pivotal in the EU institutional framework and on the international stage, reflecting the Parliament’s influence as a co-legislator and policy shaper.\n\nMetsola’s re-election is a moment of immense pride for Malta, highlighting the country’s growing influence in European affairs. Her leadership promises continuity and stability for the Parliament as it navigates critical issues such as supporting Ukraine amid ongoing Russian aggression and addressing the EU’s internal and external challenges.\n\nThe European Parliament will also elect Vice-Presidents and Quaestors in this session, setting the stage for the next two-and-a-half years of legislative activity. The session will address key topics, including the election of the President of the European Commission and debates on critical policies and international relations.\n\n#MaltaDaily"
