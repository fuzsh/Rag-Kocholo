        "text": "Paul-Henri Spaak (born January 25, 1899, Schaerbeek, near Brussels, Belgium—died July 31, 1972, Brussels) was Belgium’s foremost statesman in the decades following World War II and a leading advocate of European cooperation. He played a major role in forming the European Economic Community (EEC; later succeeded by the European Union), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and Benelux, the customs union of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg (see Benelux Economic Union).\n\nAfter practicing as a lawyer (1921–31), Spaak became a socialist member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1932. As foreign minister (1936–38), he won acceptance by Great Britain and France of Belgium’s independent foreign policy in the years before World War II. He became Belgium’s first socialist prime minister (1938–39) and again served as foreign minister (1939–45) in Hubert Pierlot’s government, which was exiled in London (1940–44). In London in 1944 Spaak helped form the Benelux customs union, which took effect in 1948. He helped draft the United Nations Charter in 1945 and served as president of the organization’s first General Assembly in 1946.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nAfter a term as foreign minister (1945–47), Spaak became prime minister in the Social Christian–Socialist coalition government (1947–50) that introduced woman suffrage (1948) and brought the National Bank under state control. In 1948 he signed the Brussels Treaty establishing a regional defense alliance among Britain, France, and the Benelux countries, and he helped align those nations with the United States the following year to form NATO. Spaak’s counsel was influential in persuading King Leopold III to abdicate the Belgian throne in 1951."
