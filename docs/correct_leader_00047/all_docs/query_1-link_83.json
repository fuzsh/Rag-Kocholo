        "text": "The College of Europe, established on the initiative of the Hague Congress, dates back to 1949 and is the oldest postgraduate institute of European studies. The founding idea was to establish an institution where university graduates from many different European countries could study and live together in preparation for careers related to European cooperation and integration.\n\nSince 1992, the College operates on two campuses, one based in Bruges, Belgium, the other in Natolin, Warsaw, Poland. Our formula ‘one College, two campuses’ is inspired by the same ‘esprit du Collège’.\n\nEvery year, hundreds of students from all over Europe and beyond benefit from a truly multicultural learning experience before embarking on inspiring international careers.\n\nThe College of Europe is characterised by its academic independence, its bilingualism, the diversity of its teaching staff and its multicultural environment, which together create a genuine European ‘microcosm’.\n\nThe academic programmes of Bruges and Natolin provide students with a specialised grounding in the European dimension of their fields of study, as well as an in-depth understanding of Europe in all its complexity.\n\nBy working together in an international community of students, academic assistants, faculty and staff members from all corners of the continent and beyond, students experience Europe first-hand and benefit from a wide range of teaching methods and from challenging teamwork and negotiation exercises.\n\nFor more than 70 years the College of Europe has contributed to the European integration project, providing generations of leaders the knowledge, experience and collective wisdom that enabled them to turn the dream of a unified, peaceful and prosperous continent into reality.\n\nToday, exactly as in the times of its foundation, the College of Europe is ready to form a new generation of women and men capable of imagining and building the social, economic and political renaissance of our continent, guided by the project of integration as well as its relations with the rest of the world.\n\nOn our two campuses, Bruges and Natolin, you will find not only a top quality postgraduate institute of European studies with a unique interdisciplinary approach and senior academics and practitioners from over twenty-five countries, but also a truly European living experience that will remain with you for the rest of your life, as you will become part of an extraordinary network - the College family."
