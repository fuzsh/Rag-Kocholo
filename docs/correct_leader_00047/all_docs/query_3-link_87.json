        "text": "The European Parliament has signed a 12-year lease on a large office building in Brussels that used to be the headquarters of the European Commission’s research department.\n\nThe move, described by one observer of the Brussels property market as possibly the biggest office deal of 2013, signals the continuing outward expansion of the Parliament, beyond its main Brussels site between Place du Luxembourg and the Parc Léopold.\n\nCommission staff moved out of the building on the south side of Square de Meeûs earlier this year. The 11-storey building, which has 40,000 square metres of office space, is now being renovated – it dates from 1978 and was previously renovated in 1996 – ready for the Parliament to move in next year.\n\nInitially, the building will provide offices for temporary staff who are earmarked to occupy an office block at the corner of rue Treves and rue Belliard, that is currently being re-built, referred to as the TreBel building.\n\nLater, after 2017, the Square de Meeûs site will be used to accommodate Parliament staff as they are decanted temporarily out of two wings of the Parliament’s main site, the Altiero Spinelli and Paul-Henri Spaak buildings, which are to be renovated.\n\nUnder EU rules, public buildings that are older than 20 years must be renovated and the Spaak and Spinelli buildings were completed in 1995. The plenary chamber in the Spaak building has been out of use since last summer, when cracks were discovered in its ceiling beams.\n\nThe Parliament declined to disclose how much rent it will pay for the Square de Meeûs building. The first two years of use will be rent-free, which means that no budget appropriations have been recorded in publicly available documents.\n\nJean-Michel Meersseman of Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate services firm, described the transaction as possibly the biggest office deal of this year. Jones Lang LaSalle represented the building’s owner, KanAm Grund, a German real estate fund, in the negotiations with the Parliament.\n\nMeersseman said that the lease was concluded in the form of a usufruct, which transfers temporary ownership with all its obligations, but also with tax advantages compared to a rental contract.\n\nThe Parliament has already concluded an agreement to buy the TreBel building, which is to provide 32,000 square metres of office space at a price of €125 million in 2011 prices. That building is supposed to be ready in 2017.\n\nThe lease of the Square de Meeûs building was approved by the Parliament’s budgets committee without a formal opinion, on the recommendation of Monika Hohlmeier, a centre-right German MEP who is the Parliament’s buildings rapporteur. The decision to approve the lease without an opinion suggests that the committee had no concerns.\n\nThe Parliament’s main building in Luxembourg, the Konrad Adenauer, is also currently being renovated and extended at an estimated cost of €550m. It is supposed to host staff of the Parliament’s secretariat-general, who are currently spread across the city."
