        "text": "NATO leaders are meeting this week in Washington to mark 75 years of the military alliance.\n\nThe will take place amid debates over the commitments and contributions of member nations.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said at a political rally over the winter that he’d encourage Russia to to a NATO country that doesn’t contribute its fair share to mutual defense.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Trump’s comments “dangerous.”\n\n“NATO is a sacred commitment,” Biden said at the time.\n\nBut stress within the alliance over who carries their weight isn’t new.\n\nSince 2006, NATO members have of their national economic power on defense. But that’s not been the case.\n\njust 11 NATO members hit that mark last year: Poland, the U.S., Greece, Estonia, Lithuania, Finland, Romania, Hungary, Latvia, the U.K. and Slovakia.\n\nAnd NATO says 23 of its are expected to meet or exceed the target this year.\n\nBut that 2% threshold doesn’t tell the full story, so to more accurately show how much allies are contributing to mutual defense.\n\n“The 2% of GDP is an input-oriented measure, but it doesn't really measure either of the outputs or the quality – the efficiency with which the inputs are converted into outputs, the level of the outputs, or the quality of the outputs,” King Mallory, a senior international defense researcher at RAND, said Monday. “So, what we did is we took the traditional spending measure, but we added to it spending on peacekeeping operations, and we added to it the cost of countries that were imposing sanctions on countries like Iran and Russia, lost exports. Because there's a real cost. They cost jobs.”\n\nMallory said they also looked at how many tanks, aircraft, satellites and such each country contributes, adjusting for their age.\n\nAnd RAND included traditional American allies in Asia, such as Japan, South Korea and Australia to give a more complete picture.\n\n“The thing that was slightly worrying about it was that six or seven, what we call frontline states that border with potential future competitors like Russia or China, were in that lowest category, as was one major antipodean ally,” he said.\n\nThere is a caveat with the RAND report, which was this spring.\n\nThe report was commissioned by the secretary of defense’s office early in the Trump administration, and the RAND researchers finished their work in 2019. But review and release of the report was put on hold during the pandemic and staff turnover at the Pentagon.\n\nThe RAND report also doesn’t name the countries that fell short, noting the age of the data and that there was a desire to avoid publicly shaming such countries.\n\nMallory said some allies have stepped up their spending in that interim five-year period. But the report showed 20 countries weren’t sharing their part of the burden.\n\nA score of 1.0 in the index developed by the RAND researchers meant a country was contributing at least its fair share.\n\nThe U.S. scored 1.32 on the RAND burden-sharing index.\n\nSix NATO allies, mostly small countries in south and central Europe, scored higher.\n\nNine other allies scored above or just below the 1.0 cutoff, according to RAND.\n\nThe index showed the U.S. bore around 47% of the total burden.\n\nMallory said the Pentagon had sought feedback on ways to get allies to contribute more.\n\n“But really in the final analysis, what causes people to contribute more is with the threat-scenario changes. And boy, has it changed in the intervening five years,” he said. “We've got Russia and Ukraine, we've got China bullying its allies, its neighbors. So, various nations voluntarily have kind of stepped up their contributions since we (finished) this report.”\n\nHe called Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “a real wake-up call to NATO countries about having allowed their forces to hollow out too much.”\n\nAllies started digging in their ammunition stocks to help Ukraine, and the shortcomings became very apparent, Mallory said.\n\nIs NATO's future at risk?\n\n“I don't think so,” Mallory said. “I think it is served us well over many, many years.”\n\nHe noted the cohesion NATO has shown in face of the Russian invasion.\n\nAnd he spoke about NATO’s value to the U.S. in terms of security influence.\n\n“It allows us to kind of punch further, but it's not to be taken for granted,” Mallory said."
