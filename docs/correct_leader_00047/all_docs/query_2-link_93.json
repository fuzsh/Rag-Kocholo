        "text": "C o u n t d o w n The Olympic Games will start at the end of this week! Named the 'Games of the XXXIII Olympiad', they will be held in Paris from Friday 26 July to 11 August. Following the Olympics, the Paralympic Games will take place from 28 August to 8 September. In this context, the sports hall Gilles Boutantin in Cormeilles-en-Parisis has been designated as ‘Games Preparation Centre’. This gymnasium boasts 5,000m2 dedicated to sports, equipped with all the necessary comforts and facilities. It features a double hall with a 40m-long metal lattice beam, a 499-seat grandstand, a foot/punching room, a dojo, a weights room, a meeting room, and 8 changing rooms. It provides accommodation and training facilities for Japanese athletes in #athletics and #volleyball for the Games. We have provided our expertise in #structural #engineering alongside the architects of DIETRICH UNTERTRIFALLER. More of the project: https://lnkd.in/euT5huVi\n\nD e c o n s t r u c t i o n We participated in the Dolmen program to deconstruct the Osserain Bridge in southwest France! The planned deconstruction of this #masonry bridge enabled the implementation of a bold research operation to analyse the behaviour of this type of structure and advance the understanding of these materials. The French National Project DOLMEN aims to advance the understanding of the behaviour of masonry structures and transfer the research results to the profession. This will improve the evaluation and maintenance of existing heritage safely and sustainably and reinstate masonry in the catalogue of contemporary construction techniques. To watch videos of the various stages of the experiment: https://lnkd.in/eQfuxEPt #Research #Stone #Engineering #France\n\nS u s t a i n a b i l i t y The Brétigny-sur-Orge sports complex in the ZAC Clause Bois Badeau eco-neighborhood (near Paris) will feature a multi-sports hall with a 250-seat grandstand, a gymnastics hall, and a versatile cross-shaped hall. The design will include a 5-meter-high brick base topped with wood, creating a protective belt and a glazed entrance hall. Timber beams will support the multi-sports and gymnastics halls, forming striking canopies. The structure will use glued laminated timber and wood cladding. We collaborate with AAVP ARCHITECTURE as structural engineers.

We specialise in the refurbishment of existing structures, including timber, masonry, concrete, iron and more, across all design stages. Over the next few weeks, we will showcase various projects where we've had the honor of preserving, converting, extending, or restoring listed buildings. These projects highlight our commitment to maintaining the historic charm of these structures while enhancing their functionality. The project at 50 Montaigne Street in Paris involved a comprehensive building retrofit. The work included replacing structural cores, removing walls and columns for new office spaces, enlarging elevator shafts and stairs, designing a new façade on the avenue side, landscaping the roof, and refurbishing the courtyard-facing facades. We provided our structure and façade engineering expertise to the teams of FRESH architectures.

In the context of the 2024 #Olympic and #Paralympic Games, which will be officially launched in precisely 15 days' time, the first part of the project regarding lightning has been completed, with the development of the area around the Warsaw Fountain, designed by Agence 8'18''. #Engineering #France #Architecture\n\nF e a t u r e d Summer often evokes the idea of recharging one's batteries, and 'La Source' pavilion is a prime example of this concept. Situated in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, this 110m2 pavilion, designed by Atelier LAVIT, offers a unique and tranquil setting. We contributed to its realisation as structural engineers. The project is showcased in BOOKSTORMING - ARCHISTORM magazine No. 125 and on ArchDaily. See on Archdaily: https://lnkd.in/d7VyTA-u #Wood #Steel #Paris\n\nS o o n The metal structure of the panoramic bar-restaurant at the High Garden project in Rueil Malmaison (Greater Paris area) is nearing completion! Collaborating with the architects of Harmonic + Masson & Associés, we have provided our expertise in structure and façade engineering to this suspended building and its unique \"cloud\". This \"cloud\" consists of 3,240 stainless steel tubes, intricately assembled around the bar-restaurant to give the impression of floating on air. This architecturally ambitious building is part of the High Garden eco-district project. It offers a panoramic view of the new district and is expected to be completed by the end of July 2024. #Engineering #Structure #Façade #France\n\nD i a l o g u e Last week, the Transformation Dialogue ‘TiD 7 I KI für eine nachhaltig gebaute Umwelt’ took place in #Berlin. The event was organised by the Federal Bauakademie Foundation. Our colleague Christoph Gengnagel spoke alongside Kika Brockstedt, Friederike Rohde and Matthias Zühlke about the role that artificial intelligence (AI) will play in sustainable construction in the future. Three examples were used to give an insight into the use of AI in the context of the built environment and to reflect on its impact and sustainability: on a macro scale (urban and regional level), on a micro scale (materials and products) and in work process integration (everyday life of planners). #conference #AI #sustainability\n\nB u i l d i n g R e t r o f i t At Bollinger+Grohmann, we offer a wide range of services beyond new construction.

These projects highlight our commitment to maintaining the historic charm of these structures while enhancing their functionality. In this project, the clock tower on the campus of the Technical University of Darmstadt, which was destroyed in the Second World War, was given a new dome. The aim was to create an observatory for the Department of Physics on the stump of the tower and to create a safe and harmonious link to the existing building. Walter & Sichau Architekten was responsible for the design, and we were commissioned to carry out the structural and the façade engineering.
