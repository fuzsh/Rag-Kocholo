        "text": "A number of EU foreign ministers spoke of their reverence for US president Joe Biden and his decision to step down as candidate.\n\nSome of the policies that are waiting at the doorstep of both the next parliament's employment committee and the programme of the next European Commission are public procurement, abuse of workers, use of AI in the workplace, social dialogue and exposure to harmful chemicals.\n\nAn Italian general made a fortune from a gay-bashing book, while a Greek male model earned tens of thousands eating bugs on TV, but new MEPs' values and dignity aside, some financial declarations also raised red flags on lobbying.\n\nThe EU Commission this week is expected to publish its annual rule of law report, while the boycott of the Hungarian presidency continues. On Tuesday, the EU parliament's 20 committees and four subcommittees are set to elect its chairs and sub-chairs. Meanwhile, G20 financial ministers will meet in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIndia is mulling whether to impose its own carbon tax to offset losses from the EU’s new carbon levy on imports.\n\nThe Netherlands isn't joining a boycott of Hungary's EU presidency, as its new government sits on the fence on rule-of-law.\n\nFrance is the only country in Europe with bans on religious headwear in sports such as women’s football, basketball and volleyball. This is why ahead of, and during, the forthcoming Paris Olympics and Paralympics, Amnesty International is calling for an end to these violations of women and girl athletes’ human rights.\n\nUK new prime minister Keir Starmer urged European leaders to work together to combat human trafficking in the first major diplomatic test of his promises to ‘reset’ relations with the EU.\n\nAs the climate crisis accelerates, some European governments are seeking to silence groups that are trying to raise the alarm."
