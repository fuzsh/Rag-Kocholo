        "text": "MEPs have backtracked on multi-million euro plans to overhaul their main building in Brussels, potentially averting a major public relations drama in the process.\n\nIn the votes on the EU budget for 2023 on Wednesday in Strasbourg, MEPs agreed to reconsider plans to revamp the Paul-Henri Spaak building in Brussels. The proposal to overhaul the building, which houses the plenary chamber, at an estimated cost of €500 million had been pushed through the Budget committee by EPP and Renew Europe members.\n\nHowever, that had prompted criticism that EU lawmakers were prepared to spend such a large sum amid a cost of living crisis across Europe.\n\nHowever, by a wafer-thin majority of one, led by the EPP and Renew Europe, EU lawmakers rejected an attempt by the Socialist group to cancel plans for the Parliament to purchase the Osmose building in Strasbourg as part of an exchange deal that would convert the Salvador De Madariaga building, which houses offices for MEPs and officials, into a hotel.\n\nThe result is a partial victory for the Socialist group, whose budget spokesperson Nils Usakovs remarked that “sense has prevailed for now.” However, he described the plans to proceed with the Osmose purchase as “simply outrageous.”\n\nThere is still time to block the Osmose purchase, which Usakovs says is “not cost neutral as its proponents claim,” as MEPs have four months to block the plan following a discussion in the Budget Committee due to be held next Wednesday.\n\n(Benjamin Fox Euractiv.com)"
