        "text": "Trade and international development aid should more often be used as leverage to force countries to accept the return of rejected migrants, says the European Commission.\n\nA constitutional overhaul would be a required step for Baku to sign an agreement. This condition hampers, if not kills the hope for an Armenia-Azerbaijan peace agreement before COP29.\n\nIn Georgia, another key Eastern Partnership country that was the first victim of Russian aggression in 2008, new EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas will have to deal with surging Russian influence and the transformation of Georgia into a Russian vassal against the will of its people.\n\nThe European Commission has faulted Hungary for not doing enough to tackle rule of law issues in the country.\n\nWomen’s representation remains limited in most influential European Parliament posts, while democratic forces achieved a partial 'cordon sanitaire’ during the constitutive meeting of the 20 committees.\n\nHungary has vowed to keep blocking EU funds for Ukraine, while calling for Europe's support to break Ukraine's oil sanctions on Russia.\n\nWhen I started reading the European Commission’s political guidelines, several sections filled me with hope. However, hope started to fade into worry as I noticed a glaring omission in the document: disability.\n\nThe EU places too much emphasis on fundamental rights including privacy and too little on law enforcement — an imbalance should be corrected, the Swedish government has told member states’ delegations."
