        "text": "Emerging between the tidily renovated Gare du Quartier Léopold railway station and the scenic Léopold Park stands the imposing European Parliament building, a structure crafted from glass, stone, and steel, consisting of two primary blocks. The first of the two, known as the Spinelli building, houses the offices of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and the EU library, as well as featuring an information office where EU-related information is provided, along with answers to inquiries about the building and guidance on guided tours.\n\nOn the other hand, the Spaak building is the residence of the horseshoe-shaped debating chamber, equipped with a curved glass roof that reaches a height of 70 meters. Completed in 1997, this building showcases a striking cylinder-shaped glass dome reminiscent of the Crystal Palace. While it has its admirers, it's locally referred to as \"Le caprice des dieux\" (\"Folly of the gods\"), which not only alludes to its cheese-shaped appearance but also humorously comments on the EU's perception of its own significance.\n\nThe thirty-minute tours of the Spaak building are relatively brief, providing a glimpse into the debating chamber and the adjacent stairwell. Visitors are provided with headphones that guide them through and offer explanations about the functioning of the EU. While not necessarily a must-see attraction, the tour does provide insights into the building's purpose, primarily housing the Parliament's various committees (with most debates taking place in Strasbourg). To join the tour, visitors should report to the Spaak building's visitor entrance fifteen minutes before the scheduled time and remember to carry photo identification.\n\nChocolate Tour in Brussels\n\nBelgium is considered one of, if not the, best producer of chocolate in the world.

They treat beer the way the French treat wine: for the makers, it's a prized art; for the drinkers, it is something to be savored and discussed. They say that, on average, Belgians drink 150 liters of beer per year per person, and one would often see them sipping it from early in the... view more\n\nTour Duration: 1 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 2.1 Km or 1.3 Miles\n\nMont Des Arts Cultural Walk\n\nMont des Arts, meaning \"hill of the arts\", is one of the most important cultural sites in Brussels.
