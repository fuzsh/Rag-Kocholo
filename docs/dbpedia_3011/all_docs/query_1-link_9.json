        "text": "When people look back and remember the First World War, they often remember the assassination of Franz-Ferdinand, the sinking of the Lusitania, or the Zimmerman telegram. Not often do they recall the role that Canada played in the war. However, Canadians were a significant factor of the Allies’ success. Although Canada only possessed two Navy warships at the time and was known for being a peaceful country, she supplied over 60,000,000 shells to the Allies’ troops and endured over 67,000 casualties and 173,000 men wounded across multiple battles. With that said, it could also be argued that internal political conflicts in Canada afflicted their overall contribution to the war. In fact,\n\nThis paper will review the actions of American forces during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Upon the arrival of American forces to France in June 1917, an inexperienced combat force quickly transformed in just 15 months and abruptly ended the war after a 47 day campaign. They were led by General John J. Pershing, fighting against an experienced German foe who had been in battle for over three years prior to their arrival. The American forces involved consisted of the U.S. 1st Army, which was centered in the offensive and part of the overall Allied Expeditionary Force. French forces took part in the offensive to the west, British forces fought to the east. The offensive was named after the very thick Argonne Forest was to the west and\n\nThe authors of these book, S.E. Hinton, The Outsiders, and Gary D. Schmidt, The Wednesday Wars, did a great job at making these books. The main characters, Ponyboy and Holling, are well thought out. The Outsiders is a book about a boy who is a gang and have lost his parents. The gang is a part of the Greasers, the poor kids, who are always attacked by the Socs., the rich kids. One day Ponyboy and Johnny are attacked and Johnny kills one. They run away where they save kids from a burning church. They get burns and are rushed to the hospital. Meanwhile Ponyboy and Greasers are having a rumble with the Socs. After the rumble Johnny dies in the hospital and Dally is killed by police because he wanted to die. The Wednesday Wars is about a 7th grader who thinks his teacher hates him. He doesn’t have parents who care about him and sister thinks he has no guts. He learns that Mrs. Baker is actually nice when she helps him practice for events such as the play and track meet. His dad however is only thinking about business and not about his kids. Holling eventually stands up to him. The characters have plenty of differences between them from their parents, to the personality, but they have the same kinds of friends.\n\nThe Second World War was an important event in Canadian history, turning an unobtrusive country on the outer edge of global affairs into a critical player in the 20th century’s most important struggle. The Canadian Prime Minister of the time, William Lyon Mackenzie King was hesitant to join the Second World War due to the devastating effects of the first war still being fresh. Canada took all variables into account and launched Canada into the war very well, with a primary focus on the manufacturing duties of the war. Notably, Canada carried out a vital role in the Battle of the Atlantic, allowing goods produced in Canada to pass the ocean and neutralize threats by German U-boats. In addition, Canada played a big role in the air war over Germany and contributed forces to the campaigns\n\nThe carnage of world war one was the result of the clash between new technologies, but old strategies. Blitzkrieg warfare would be the first form of modern military tactics for it fully utilizes the technological advancements of that time. The term “Blitzkrieg” was not invented by the Germans, but by an English magazine that described the invasion of Poland (Showalter). While many accredit the invention of Blitzkrieg warfare to Heinz Guderian, Germany's Chief of Mobile Troops during WWII, it was actually invented far before that. In fact, it was developed right after WWI after seeing the devastating effects of trench warfare(Showalter). Ironically, the basis of Blitzkrieg warfare was also laid by German Field Marshall Alfred von Schlieffen of the famous Schlieffen plan of WWI(Showalter). The basic essence of Blitzkrieg warfare was built upon the belief that Germany was always going to be out resourced and out numbered in every war and thus in order to win it, the Germans must strike hard and fast and penetrate deep behind enemy lines(Showalter). Thus, Blitzkrieg warfare was the most effective military tactic of its time because it utilized all of the technology of its time, it not only utilized physical warfare, but also psychological warfare, and because Germany’s opponents were not prepared for this kind of warfare.\n\nGreece, a British ally attacked turkey and was fought off. Then Turkey advanced on the British at Chanak and outnumbered the British. The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, called on the dominions and colonies of the British Empire for help. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King refused to send Canadians without question. King wanted Parliament to decide whether Candian forced should go. Arthur Meighen, leader of the opposition (1922) said, “ When Britain’s message came[asking for help at Chanak], then Canada should have said: “ Ready, aye ready; we stand by you.” I hope the time has not yet gone by when that declaration can be made” (p.219). This shows how Britain controlled Canada and involved them into in every problem they got into. Not all Britain’s battles are ours too. The Chanak affair signalled that Canada wants to make its own decisions about involving themselves in conflicts. In 1923, Canada only could sign treaties with other countries that had been co-signed by British officials. After ww1 halibut stocks off the Northwest coast of Canada and the U.S were endangered due to\n\nThe First World War, also known as the Great War, began in about 1914 and went on until 1918. This brutal war was an extremely bloody time for Europe and the soldiers that fought in it. These men spent their days in trenches holding down bases and taking in attacks from all sides. The soldier's only free time was consumed with writing letters to those on the home front. The letters they wrote contain heart breaking stories of how their days were spent and the terrible signs of war. The War consumed them and many of them let out all their true feelings of war in their letters to loved ones. In The First World War: A brief History With Documents we can find some of these letters that help us understand what the First World War might have\n\nIf you were to consider the most shocking event that occurred during world war one and two, the first thing that might come to mind would probably be the Holocaust. And it certainly is a significant occurrence, rivaling even the war itself, but not a lot of people know that before this happened, during world war one, the Armenians faced a similar oppression from the Ottoman Empire. The Armenian Genocide was intently executed by the Ottoman Empire for accusation of alignment with the Soviet Union and was concealed under the guise of move due to war.\n\nThe first world war was one of the most brutal and remorseless events in history; ‘the global conflict that defined a century’. Over nine million soldiers and a large amount of innocent civilians lost their lives. Empires crumbled, revolution engulfed Russia and America rose to become a dominant world power. Huge armies deployed new weapons of devastating effect from rifles and pistols to torpedoes and flame throwers. These weapons were used not only in the trenches but by tanks too. This was an advantage to those who were able to access such machinery as they could easily launch bullets and missiles at nearby enemy bases. The downfall of the tank was the fact it was unable to cross the trenches. Tanks were not the only pieces of equipment that could access this machinery but U boats and planes too. The British carried ‘bolt action rifles’ in which fired 15 rounds per minute at a minimum range of 1,400 metres away. This allowed the British to take out foes at a far greater range. By using machinery in which rules out the need for getting up close to the enemy was a great advantage during world war one. Soldiers ran from trench to trench attacking with all that they had. This resulted in a massacre as the soldiers running toward the trenches were shot down. Machinery such as machine guns and heavy artillery were the weapons used in the trenches. In modern day society, machine guns are the main weapons used by soldiers. This wasn’t the case around the 1914s. They took four"
