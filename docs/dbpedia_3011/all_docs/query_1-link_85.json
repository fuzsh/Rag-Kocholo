Canada gained greater autonomy from Britain in the early 20th century through several events:\n\n1) Canada joined the League of Nations independently in 1919, demonstrating its ability to make decisions on the world stage without British involvement. \n\n2) In the Chanak Affair, Canada refused to automatically send troops to fight with Britain in Turkey, showing it would decide its own military participation. \n\n3) The Halibut Treaty saw Canada sign its own treaty with the US regarding fishing rights without British approval, taking control of its treaty-making.\n\n4) The Statute of Westminster formally recognized Canada and other dominions as equal and independent from Britain passing laws for them.",
