        "text": "This chapter examines the origins of the Ruhr crisis, from October 1922 to January 1923. It is divided into four sections. The first covers the domestic-political background in Britain; it also explores the initial phase of British policy from October to December 1922, when the British tried to stall Poincaré’s calls for a large conference to be held at Brussels to discuss the German default. Ultimately, Poincaré could be satisfied only by agreeing to hold a much smaller preliminary conference in London in December 1922. This conference is covered in the second section. The London Conference achieved little, merely postponing negotiations until Paris in January 1923. The interim weeks between London and Paris, when British officials and politicians sought a way out of the impasse, is examined in the third section. The last section concentrates on the Paris Conference and the final split between France and Britain."
