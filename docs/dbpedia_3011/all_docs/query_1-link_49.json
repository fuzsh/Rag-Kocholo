        "text": "Selecting a Crisis\n\nSelect a crisis by using the dropdown list near the top left of the interface.\n\nClick on \"crisis number\" to sort the list sequentially by crisis number (the default), or \" crisis name\" to sort the list by ICB crisis name.\n\nSelecting a crisis from the dropdown list will bring up the crisis summary for that crisis in the main interface window. In addition, the entire interface will be set to work with the selected crisis.\n\nOnce you have selected a crisis, you can use the \"next\" and \"prev\" controls at top left to move forward or back one crisis at a time.\n\nSelecting Crisis Data Views\n\nAfter selecting a crisis, select any one of the Crisis Data View controls to pull up relevant data in the main interface window.\n\n! Select the arrows to preview the system- and actor-level variables available in each data view.\n\n! Once in a Crisis Data View, you can use the \"next\" and \"prev\" controls on the left-hand side of the Admin Bar to move forward or back one crisis at a time while remaining in that data view.\n\nSearching the Crisis Database\n\nQuick Search\n\nSelect the \"search\" tab at the top of the ICB Data Viewer interface.\n\nSearch using any ONE of the available search options:\n\nexact word or phrase\n\ntrigger year\n\nactor\n\nWhen searching for crises based on an exact word or phrase, the database looks for matches only within the crisis summaries. Your search string will be highlighted within the crisis summary text when you review the crises listed in your search results.\n\nNote that the simple algorithm used in the ICB Data Viewer text search will also return results where your search string is part of longer words or phrases (e.g., searching for \"media\" will return a list of crisis summaries that include the words \"media,\" \"mediate,\" \"immediately,\" etc.).\n\nWhen searching for crises by trigger year, make certain to enter a four-digit value for the year (e.g., 2000)\n\nAdvanced (Multivariate) Search\n\nSelect the \"search\" tab at the top of the ICB Data Viewer interface.\n\nFrom within the Search panel, select the Advanced Search option.\n\nNext select \"System Level\" or \"Actor Level.\"\n\nThe Advanced Search Page allows for simple Boolean-style searches using the \"and\" and \"or\" Boolean operators. For important details, see Boolean Search Tips.\n\nTo execute a search:\n\nSelect a variable from the list.\n\nSelect a comparison operator (i.e., equal to, not equal to, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to) from the list.\n\nDepending on the variable, either select OR enter the value to be compared.\n\nNote: For most variables, you need only select a value from a list. However, for some variables (e.g., system-level BREXIT), you will need to enter a numeric value, while for others (e.g., system-level TRIGDATE), you will need to enter a date (in mm/dd/yyyy format).\n\nFor each additional variable, select a boolean operator (i.e., and, or) and repeat steps 1 to 3.\n\nSelect the search button.\n\nCases that match your query conditions will be listed, in chronological order.\n\nModifying an Advanced (Multivariate) Search\n\nWhen modifying an advanced (multivariate) search, be sure to use the \"Modify this search?\" control. Do NOT use the back button, as your original search criteria will be lost.\n\nDownloading ICB Data Sets and Codebooks\n\nSelect the \"ICB Data Collections\" link to find authoritative versions of the ICB data sets and codebooks available for download.\n\nThe data sets are available in two different formats, SPSS for Windows and tab-delimited text. All files have been compressed into ZIP files.\n\nBrowsing the ICB Codebook\n\nSelect the \"Codebook\" control at the top of the ICB Data Viewer interface to open the codebook panel. Choose a coding level, system or actor, and then any variable name to begin.\n\nReturn to the main list of coding variables at any time by clicking the word \"Codebook.\"\n\nClearing the ICB Data Viewer\n\nTo clear and reset the ICB Data Viewer, use the \"Clear Data Viewer\" control near the top right of the ICB Data Viewer interface.\n\nThis action will clear all data and searches, and will return you to the ICB Data Viewer introduction."
