The Chanak Crisis took place in 1922. The city was held by British troops during 1922. The reason why this city was really important to the British was because it had a perfect shipping route out of the Mediterranean sea. The Chanak Crisis occurred when a group of Turkish nationalists threatened to attack British troops stationed in Chanak. The reason why these Turkish nationalists were attacking the British was because Turkish territory had been taken over by other countries mainly by the British. On September 15 1922, Britain sent a telegram to Canada asking if they would send troops to Chanak if something would go wrong. Canada would reply back by deciding with their parliament before sending any troops for support. This act created a large independence for Canada as they decided on their own for a problem. The British and Turkish nationalists settled an agreement for the land and therefore not creating violence.

In 1914, Great Britain declared war on Germany when they pushed into Belgium’s borders when Belgium was already neutral. When Britain declared war, Canada was forced to join and fight because they were a colony of the British Empire. In the war, Canada had enlisted a total of 611, 711 troops. Out of those 611 711 troops that were enlisted, 418, 052 troops went overseas to fight the battle. The 418 052 men that went overseas to fight, 56 638 died and 132 550 were wounded in the war. Canada’s first major battle was the battle of Ypres. Even though the German Empire was stronger than Canada’s army, their support for the British overpowered Germany. After the battle ended Canada had lost 6000 men but was known as a strong country.
