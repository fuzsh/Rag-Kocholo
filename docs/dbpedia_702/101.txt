Chart Performance: Pop (#6) & Adult Contemporary (#5); 1982

Story Behind The Song By Ed Osborne

I Go Crazy, Cool Night, ’65 Love Affair: these are the records for which Paul Davis is remembered. However, Paul also notched up seven chart singles in the seven years preceding I Go Crazy (#7; 1978). Of those, 1974’s Ride ‘Em Cowboy had risen the highest – to #23 – and the album of the same name marked Paul’s first appearance on the album chart.

Although Paul racked up a couple of more Top 40 records after I Go Crazy, over three years slipped by before he scored another bona fide hit in the form of Cool Night. Whereas I Go Crazy took a lengthy 26 weeks to reach its peak position, Cool Night did it in 14 weeks so at least things were improving for Paul.

They got even better with the release of his next single, ’65 Love Affair which debuted on the Hot 100 just three weeks after Cool Night dropped off and, in just 13 weeks, became Paul’s pop biggest hit.
