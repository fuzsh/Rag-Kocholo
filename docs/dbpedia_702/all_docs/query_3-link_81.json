        "text": "This Masterpiece Recording Still Tops Our List of Ivan Lins Songbook Albums.\n\nA Love Affair: The Music of Ivan Lins needs some musical context before we begin.\n\nThis article was first published by Connectbrazil.com on September 13, 2000\n\nThere always seems to be a stack of world music CDs on our review desk. The latest girl group from Peru, The Lost Chants of Armenia. Music for making tea!\n\nFortunately, for all of us, Ivan Lins has always understood the difference between World Music and world-class music. So has producer Jason Miles.\n\nJason Miles did a masterful job with A Love Affair: The Music of Ivan Lins to achieve something not contemplated since Creed Taylor chased that same vision 38 years ago.\n\nSongwriter Lins has always left the lyrics to his beautiful melodies for others to provide: opening up a universe of creative input from top songwriters. And the influence of his childhood years in Cambridge, MA has provided a cultural reference for all continents.\n\nA Love Affair: The Music of Ivan Lins pairs 10 of his best songs with an equally stellar line-up of pop performers.\n\nThe result is a phenomenal album that spans virtually every musical category to fly in the face of what we’re told World Music should be.\n\nWhile other great Brazilian songwriters have musical styles that are easily identifiable, Lins’ versatility is such that each song carries its own distinctive signature.\n\nIf unfamiliar with his work, you’d be hard-pressed to think that this one composer wrote any two songs.\n\nAnd this composer writes very well.\n\nConsider that ‘She Walks This Earth (Soberanna Rosa)’ won the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and that ‘Camaleão’ was nominated for the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.\n\nThen don’t forget the Grammy award won by Quincy Jones for ‘Velas’ several years ago.\n\nSimply put, Ivan Lins’ melodies speak volumes.\n\nYou’ll immediately appreciate the difference between the first few seconds of Chaka Khan’s version of ‘So Crazy’ (Cru-Cre Corroro) or Vanessa Williams’ read of Lins’ timeless ballad, ‘Love Dance’. And Sting’s treatment of ‘She Walks This Earth’ found us digging deep to recall what the original sounded like!\n\nMusical Mastery\n\nOnly a master songwriter of Lins’s caliber could ever hope to provide the perfect canvas for musicians to paint on. Think about that for a moment.\n\nWith so many “pop” formats to explore these days, it’s no surprise to find James “D Train” Williams paired with Lisa Fischer on the soulful ‘You Moved Me To This’, or Brenda Russell perfectly matched for ‘Nocturne’ in what could just as easily have been a song written by Burt Bacharach for Dionne Warwick.\n\nJazz fans will welcome Grover Washington, Jr.’s soprano sax play on ‘Camaleão’ and the understated jazz-samba guitar lead from Peter White on ‘Elis’.\n\nFreddy Cole’s intimate voice on ‘I’m Not Alone- Who Loves You’ leads perfectly to Diane Reeves and her softly elegant portrayal of ‘Sweet Presence’ to reveal their own “Love Affair” with Lins’ music.\n\nAnd our ‘One Track’ from A Love Affair: The Music of Ivan Lins? Here it is.\n\nMusic, Travel, Friends, And Fun!\n\nA Love Affair: The Music of Ivan Lins\n\nStories like ‘A Love Affair: The Music of Ivan Lins’ are what we do.
