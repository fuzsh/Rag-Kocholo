        "text": "\"You... Flock of Seagulls... you know why we're here?\"\n\nStill a laugh-out-loud funny reference to me. Loved 'em. Paul Reynolds was more influential than he gets credit for, I think. Others agree:\n\nhttps://rock929rocks.com/2019/08/08/a-theory-on-how-the-edge-found-his-sound/\n\n\"It’s easy to dismiss The Edge as some guy who lets a chord ring out and then proceeds to tap a dozen different switches on his pedal board. Sure, there’s a bit of that in The Edge’s sound, but he’s also the only guitar player (sorry, Bono) in a band known for lush, anthemic rock songs. So while he’s not known for whaling out leads and solos, he’s certainly an innovator when it comes to creating soaring soundscapes with his guitar. And I think the inspiration for his innovation comes from a particular source.\n\nAt the tender age of 17, Paul Reynolds joined 80s new wave force A Flock Of Seagulls just before the release of their breakthrough self-titled album, which featured the smash hit singles “I Ran” and “Space Age Love Song.” Revisit the clips below and, while you’re marveling at the hair styles, pay close attention to Reynolds’ guitar work.\n\nAgain, these songs were everywhere in 1982. When you listen to what The Edge does guitar-wise on U2’s 1983 and 1984 albums–War and The Unforgettable Fire–there’s a noticeable difference from what he was doing on the band’s first two albums. What I’m saying is that it’s not too much of a stretch to say that The Edge bit a little bit of Paul Reynold’s style, and the timeline backs my theory up. I hear the influence loud and clear on “Pride (In The Name Of Love).”\"\n\nNope.... not a fan....often refer(d) to them as \"Flock of A**H***'s\"\n\nView attachment 797552\n\nI've determined this to be true.\n\nI went with some friends to see them at a Colorado Springs night club around 1992. It was the guy who played keys and sang, with three other random musicians playing as \"Flock of Seagulls\". They sounded great, but during their break I asked the vocalist, who was hanging out at the bar, if I could get a photo with him. He said, \"No. If you want a photo, you can purchase an autographed 8X10 of me for $12.99.\" Perhaps it was a good business move, but it was also an a**h*** move.\n\nThen we left with a couple of drunk strippers we met on the dance floor; one of them passed out in the car and puked all over me - we threw her and her friend out of the car in a parking lot in a snow storm..... but that's a different story altogether.\n\nI've determined this to be true.\n\nI went with some friends to see them at a Colorado Springs night club around 1992.
