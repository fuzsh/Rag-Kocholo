        "text": "Can men wear Pandora charm bracelets?\n\nI am a very happy man as I type this as today is Christmas day and I have just finished opening my gifts. Santa must have read my mind this year as I got exactly what I wanted! I won't show you what I got quite yet - I want to finish this story first :) My mother in law has always been a fan of charm bracelets . I must admit that ever since I saw her Pandora one I fell in love with the endless design possibilities and the hundreds of charms one can buy to make each jewellery piece unique and timeless. At first I (like the rest of you I'm sure) assumed that only women could wear charm bracelets. I have been known to push the boundaries when it comes to wearing things that are sometimes labelled as \"females only\". This was the case when I bought my first bomber jacket with faux fur on the hoodie - at the time only girls were wearing this - fast forward three years and you now see men wearing them everywhere. Another good example is my previous obsession wit\n\nA Guy's Love For Dolls\n\nI'll be the first to admit that having grown up in Mexico City - a very Catholic and \"machista\" city - I never really felt comfortable playing with dolls as a kid. If I would have been caught playing with dolls at school or at a party I would have likely become a victim of social ridicule and bullying. Guys are supposed to like plastic cars, toy soldiers, monster trucks, cowboys and guns. I was always a little bit different than other boys I grew up with. I liked My Little Ponies, Care Bears , She-Ra, and yes... Barbie dolls . While I never actually openly played with dolls, I managed to steal one from one of my cousins during a sleepover weekend. It felt so wrong and yet so right. I was excited to get home to play with it. I remember hiding it underneath the washroom vanity and locking myself up to bring it out. Looking back now, I don't really know what I was so ashamed of. Society and cultural gender roles can have a big impact on the way we behave as both kid\n\nThe 10 Commandments For Instagram Success\n\nPhotography is a great communication tool that enables us to say a lot without necessarily \"saying\" anything. For as long as I can remember I have enjoyed capturing moments through the lens of a camera. I always had mine with me while growing up and my mom can attest to the huge bills she paid to develop my films. I am a fan of beauty and art in all forms but for some reason photography holds a very dear place in my heart. There are only few things I enjoy more than looking through an old album of photos. The memories are so vivid that one is immediately transported back into that exact moment. What I also like about looking at photographs is that they emit a feeling and that such feeling is captured by the person who took the picture but interpreted by whoever looks at it. With the onset of mobile technology my love for photography has only increased as now it is easier than ever to be able to express one's views with the aid of a camera. I still remember the tim\n\nNoseless Bicycle Saddles - What You Need To Know\n\nThose who know me in person know that I really enjoy riding my cruiser bike around the Vancouver seawall and the downtown core - our city is filled with beauty and it is truly designed for the ultimate comfort of bicycle fanatics like me. Riding brings back memories of the freedom I used to experience in my childhood while exploring my neighbourhood in my bike along with my friends. We live in a society in which we spend progressively less time communing with nature and biking is a great alternative to let go of our tech filled lives (besides the occasional Instagram post as we ride of course) - plus, can you think of a better feeling than the warm ocean breeze caressing your face? As we grow older we need to be aware of the benefits but also of the potential side effects any activity we choose to engage in so we can protect our bodies. Biking is no exception. I have a very small testicular cyst and as such riding had been uncomfortable for me over the last couple of years. Ridin\n\nTeeth Whitening - Is It Worth It?\n\nA few weeks ago I reviewed Aria Dental, the clinic of my new dentist Dr. Mehio . Since I was a new patient to his dental studio I qualified for the special price of $299.00 for Zoom whitening - something I couldn't pass by. My husband @guccisimo had gotten it done two days before our wedding almost three years ago now and the results were drastic. I had never gotten my teeth whitened before and for that reason I was feeling excited/worried/curious. Dr. Mehio answered all my questions before getting started with the procedure. He explained to me that the old Zoom whitening procedure used an acidic solution and that it could damage your teeth's enamel but that Zoom has since revised the procedure and there is now only one known side effect: teeth sensitivity . Teeth Whitening Simulation - Before and After The process itself is quite straight-forward. First, the dentist makes sure you don't have any problems with your roots or that there are no cracks in your teeth.\n\nBlytheCon Vancouver 2015\n\nAs most of you know by now I am one of the four organizers for the first ever Canadian BlytheCon to be held in Vancouver at the Sheraton Wall Centre Hotel on Sunday August 9, 2015. We are all extremely excited to welcome all of you to our beautiful city. Here's a video of our venue: Our theme will be \"Always The Bridesmaid Never The Bride\" and we have lots of surprises, workshops, contests and giveaways planned to make of your visit a truly unforgettable one. Let's just say that a little bird told me that we have over twenty custom dolls to give away the day of the event - and we are not talking about unknown customisers either - we are talking about some of the most respected customisers in the industry. Our featured doll will be Nicky Lad (RBL) and you can see her featured as our ‘main girl’ in our illustrations made by the amazingly talented Chun Fu (puppy52). We’re very excited to invite everyone to bring their Nicky Lads to BlytheCon Vancouver for a c\n\nThe Secret Circle: A Tribute Filled With Hope\n\nEver since I can remember I have been interested in witchcraft shows and movies. I love the mystery, the spells, the magic, the supernatural romance and the drama. Mexican culture is full of rituals that incorporate either white or dark magic. We have entire markets in Mexico City dedicated to selling ingredients to cast spells. I certainly grew up with witchcraft around me. My favourite movie of all times is The Craft - I recall watching it as a teenager multiple times and loving every minute of it. As much as I loved that movie I never really thought that something else could come along that would be able to trump it. Then came The Secret Circle - a TV show based upon the book series by L.J. Smith ( The Vampire Diaries ). The series depicts the life of six witch teenagers who unite their forces by creating a \"circle\" of power and energy that binds them to one another forever. Drama quickly begins when Cassie (the main character) discovers not only that she is a\n\nThe Power Of Fruit\n\nI was forwarded this article at work yesterday and since we all go through our ups and downs with our health I thought it would be a good idea to post it here. I have recently discovered that our bodies can heal themselves if we give them a chance and this is another great example of that. I hope you enjoy it: Dr. Oz on Eating Fruit - GOOD ADVICE FOR EVERYBODY. . . EATING FRUIT This is informative! We all think eating fruit means just buying fruit, cutting it up and popping it into our mouths. It's not that easy. It's important to know how and when to eat fruit. What's the correct way to eat fruit? IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUIT AFTER A MEAL! FRUIT SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. Eating fruit like that plays a major role in detoxifying your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities. FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD.
