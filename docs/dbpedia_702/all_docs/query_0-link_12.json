        "text": "Post by laura on\n\nHere is the thread in which you can post your own critiques about recent AT40: The 70s or AT40: The 80s shows!\n\nHere's the one I did on the 9/20/86 show:\n\n40: PARANOIMIA – THE ART OF NOISE WITH MAX HEADROOM(a rather spacy song, but I guess that's how The Art Of Noise is)\n\n39: WE DON’T HAVE TO TAKE OUR CLOTHES OFF – JERMAINE STEWART (fun song)\n\n38: MAD ABOUT YOU – BELINDA CARLISLE (one of my faves in this particular show)\n\n37: GIRL CAN’T HELP IT - JOURNEY(not one of my absolute favorite songs from the band)\n\n36: GLORY OF LOVE (THEME FROM “THE KARATE KID PART II”) – PETER CETERA (not that big on ballads like this)\n\n35: POINT OF NO RETURN – NU SHOOZ (nice, but TOO MUCH DRUM!)\n\n34: EARTH ANGEL (FROM “KARATE KID PART II”) – NEW EDITION(decent cover)\n\n33: I DIDN’T MEAN TO TURN YOU ON – ROBERT PALMER (a very funky dance tune that I like)\n\n32: SWEET LOVE – ANITA BAKER (her voice on this song is just beautiful)\n\n31: MONEY$ TOO TIGHT (TO MENTION) – SIMPLY RED (a really cool song the first time I heard it)\n\n30: TRUE COLORS – CYNDI LAUPER (wonderful tune!)\n\n29: A MATTER OF TRUST – BILLY JOEL (should have charted higher IMO)\n\n28: RUMORS – TIMEX SOCIAL CLUB (guilty pleasure, no matter how bad it may sound)\n\n27: PAPA DON’T PREACH – MADONNA (not my fave Madonna song)\n\n26: LOVE WALKS IN – VAN HALEN (it's Van Halen! What else? )\n\n25: TWIST AND SHOUT – THE BEATLES (and it's the Beatles! Who doesn't love their music?)\n\n24: MAN SIZE LOVE (FROM “RUNNING SCARED”) - KLYMAXX (rather low point in the show IMO)\n\n23: ALL CRIED OUT – LISA LISA & CULT JAM WITH FULL FORCE (nice, but prefer her dancy stuff she released a year later)\n\n22: HEAVEN IN YOUR EYES - LOVERBOY (I just skipped it)\n\n21: PRESS – PAUL McCARTNEY (Makes you yearn for more Beatles songs IMO)\n\n20: HEARTBEAT – DON JOHNSON (should have stuck to acting)\n\n19: TYPICAL MALE – TINA TURNER (pretty good I guess)\n\n18: MISSIONARY MAN – THE EURYTHMICS (one of their last hits, I believe, but it's still a cool-sounding song)\n\n17: THROWING IT ALL AWAY - GENESIS (great cut from a great album)\n\n16: THE CAPTAIN OF HER HEART - DOUBLE (a good sleep aide)\n\n15: TWO OF HEARTS – STACEY Q (such a cute song, can't resist!)\n\n14: WHEN I THINK OF YOU – JANET JACKSON (one of my faves from Janet)\n\n13: SWEET FREEDOM (THEME FROM “RUNNING SCARED”) – MICHAEL McDONALD (Favorite song on the countdown)\n\n12: HIGHER LOVE – STEVE WINWOOD (Used to like it, now... not sure)\n\n11: LOVE ZONE – BILLY OCEAN (boring)\n\n10: BABY LOVE - REGINA (comes in at a close second for my favorite song on the chart)\n\n9: DREAMTIME – DARYL HALL (I could care less)\n\n8: DON’T FORGET ME (WHEN I’M GONE) – GLASS TIGER (makes me happy)\n\n7: VENUS - BANANARAMA (nice and danceable)\n\n6: WALK THIS WAY – RUN-D.M.C. (If it wasn't for this group, then Aerosmith would not have came back! This song made history, IMO)\n\n5: WORDS GET IN THE WAY – MIAMI SOUND MACHINE (too slow for me, but the melody is a thing of beauty)\n\n4: TAKE MY BREATH AWAY (THEME FROM “TOP GUN”) - BERLIN (once again, not to big on soundtrack ballads)\n\n3: FRIENDS AND LOVERS – CARL ANDERSON AND GLORIA LORING (I skipped this one too)\n\n2: DANCING ON THE CEILING – LIONEL RICHIE (For once, I agree with VH1 on this song)\n\n1: STUCK WITH YOU – HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS (This one I don't agree with VH1, but I prefer their stuff from Sports)\n\nThe songs bolded were the songs that debuted in that particular week.\n\nRemember, this is just my opinion, and I will be posting another critique as soon as I hear the upcoming 9/17/83 show.\n\nPost by vto66 on\n\nInspired by laura's song-by-song review of a recent \"American Top-40\" rebroadcast, I've decided to do my own version for XM's recent replay of the \"American Top 40\" show from September 1, 1979. Hope you all enjoy it.\n\nAnd here we go....\n\n40. Young Blood--Rickie Lee Jones (Quite a bit funkier than \"Chuck E's In Love,\" but not a bad song.)\n\n39. Hold On--Triumph (Never heard this one before, but I like it. Catchy melody, strong beat and passionate vocals)\n\n38. Saturday Night--Herman Brood (Hearing this song reminded me of a Bryan Adams song from a few years later. This one's OK)\n\n37. Girl Of My Dreams--Bram Tchaichovsky (Another first-timer for me!! Great little pop-rock song with a late-60s feel to it. I wouldn't mind hearing this one more often on XM 70s)\n\n36. What Cha Gonna Do With My Lovin'--Stephanie Mills (I didn't care for this one too much. I prefer her hit from a year later \"I Never Knew Love Like This Before.\")\n\n35. Don't Stop Till You Get Enough--Michael Jackson (This is it, folks, the song that officially ushered in the Golden (not to mention Platinum) age for MJ. All the trademarks of the classic Michael Jackson sound are there, including a rocking guitar break paving the way for \"Beat It.\" One of his better tunes, IMHO)\n\n34. You Can't Change That--Ray Parker Jr. and Raydio (One of my favorite songs ever. A unique combination of funky soul with a mellow pop-rock flavor, and somehow they made it work.)\n\n33. Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin--Journey (This marked the first Top-40 appearance for these Bay Area Boys. I always liked this one for its interesting mix of soulful, Sam Cooke-like vocals by Steve Perry, hard-driving rhythms and that relentlessly catchy \"Na-Na-Na...\" vocal riff. Even today, it's still regarded as a classic rocker.)\n\n32. The Boss--Diana Ross (The Queen of Motown tries her hand at disco, and does a pretty good job. I found this one very listenable and likable, and almost as good as \"Upside Down\")\n\n31. Pop Muzik--M (I used to love this song when it first came out, but now I think it's kind of silly)\n\n30. Oh Well--The Rockets (Not a great song, but not a terrible one either. It does have that \"classic rock\" flavor to it)\n\n29. Ring My Bell--Anita Ward (Not one of my favorite songs. I kind of feel the same way about this one as I do about \"Pop Muzik.\")\n\n28. Different Worlds--Maureen Mc Govern (Another favorite of mine!!! Maureen's vocals are strong yet pretty, and another example of blending pop and disco styles. I also liked the show from which this theme song came, \"Angie\" which, BTW, co-starred the future Mrs. Frank Barone)\n\n27. Cruel To Be Kind--Nick Lowe (Excellent tune!!!! Another one with a late-60s pop-rock feel yet still sounding very current and hip for its time. A true classic!!)\n\n26. Highway Song--Blackfoot (Tolerable)\n\n25. Born To Be Alive--Patrick Hernandez (Great dancing tune. One of the better disco songs I've heard)\n\n24. Morning Dance--Spyro Gyra (I'm not a big fan of \"smooth jazz,\" but this one is OK. It reminds me of laying on a beach on some island somewhere.)\n\n23. I Do Love You--GQ (Good song, with yet another \"retro\" feel to it, this time reaching back to those \"shooby doo wop\" days of the late-50s. I liked \"Disco Nights\" better, but this one was pretty good too)\n\n22. Driver's Seat--Sniff' 'N' The Tears---(One of my favorite tunes on this show!!! Great melody, great lyrics, great beat, and I gotta love that low-pitched \"Yeeeahh!!\" toward the end of the song. I remember this song being pretty popular in San Jose when I was growing up)\n\n21. Bad Case Of Loving You--Robert Palmer (My favorite Robert Palmer song. I never cared much for his later stuff. The melody reminds me a bit of \"Born To Be Wild.\")\n\n20. Heaven Must Have Sent You--Bonnie Pointer (Like some of the other songs, this is a pleasant mix of various styles. In this case, we have the disco beat, a bit of classic-60s \"girl group\" flavor and Bonnie's playful homage to jazz greats Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald in the fade-out. Very enjoyable)\n\n19. Rise--Herb Alpert (Smooth Jazz doesn't get much smoother than this. Another one I remember liking the first time around, and I'm still pretty fond of it today.)\n\n18. Hot Summer Nights--Night (Hearing this song makes me want to cruise down to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk. A spirited rocker with a catchy-pop flavor that reminds me of a cross between a poppier version of Heart and a rockier version of the Pointer Sisters.)\n\n17. When You're In Love With A Beautiful Woman--Dr. Hook (Ahh Yes!! Dr. Hook!!! A great song by a great band!! Mellow yet spirited. I detect elements of rock, soul, pop and even disco in this neat little package of a tune)\n\n16. Goodbye Stranger--Supertramp (I'm not a big Supertramp fan, but this, IMHO, is one of their better ones)\n\n15. Let's Go--The Cars (Classic tune by one of my all-time favorite bands!!! Some 30 years later, it still sounds just as fresh and vibrant)\n\n14. Sail On--The Commodores (Love this one too!! Lionel Richie's vocals have a laid-back country flavor to them, and I can't help but love that bongo riff toward the end of the song)\n\n13. Suspicions--Eddie Rabbit (One of my least favorite songs on this week's chart. It's tolerable, but nowhere near as memorable as, say \"I Love A Rainy Night\" or \"Driving My Life Away.\")\n\n12. Lonesome Loser--Little River Band (Not a bad song, but I don't like this one as much as some of their others like \"Lady\" and \"The Night Owls.\")\n\n11. Bad Girls--Donna Summer (Gotta love that \"Toot-Toot-Hey-Beep-Beep\" vocal-and-police-whistle riff!! I was always a sucker for Donna Summer and I actually got to see her perform live last month. As great as she sounds on record, hearing her live was awesome!! She even pointed in my direction during one of her songs. Another classic)\n\n10. I'll Never Love This Way Again--Dionne Warwick (A classic ballad. My favorite Dionne Warwick song and one that ranks up there with her work with Burt Bacharach and Hal David.)\n\n9. Mama Can't Buy You Love--Elton John (Not a typically Elton-sounding tune, but still a good one. This one reminds me more of Hall & Oates from their mid-70s period.)\n\n8. Sad Eyes--Robert John (Pleasant-sounding tune with passionate falsetto vocals not unlike those of Barry Gibb. This one could almost be mistaken for a Bee Gees song. I don't know if that's good or bad, but this one's pretty good.)\n\n7. Lead Me On--Maxine Nightingale (Another mellow one. I found this one quite likable, though her other hit \"Right Back Where We Started From\" is probably more fondly remembered by others.)\n\n6. The Devil Went Down To Georgia--Charlie Daniels Band (At last!! The pace picks up with this witty country-rocker featuring some fast-and-furious fiddling. One of my all-time favorite country songs!! The version heard here was the tidied-up-for-Top-40 \"Son of a gun\" edit, but no matter, this song still sounds great.)\n\n5. Don't Bring Me Down--ELO (Another great song by another great band. )\n\n4. After The Love Has Gone--Earth Wind and Fire (Good song. Quite a change of pace from their more familiar funkier material)\n\n3. The Main Event/Fight--Barbra Streisand (Yes, even Streisand hopped aboard the disco bandwagon, and she sounds pretty impressive here. Then again, she's one of those singers who sounds good pretty much singing anything, which could be why she's still at it after all these years.)\n\n2. Good Times--Chic (One of my favorite disco songs!! One of the last, maybe one of the only, truly great disco songs and one that still sounds great to this day.)\n\n1. My Sharona--The Knack (Those drums, that bass, that rocking guitar riff, that sassy \"M-M-M-My-Yi-Yi-WOOOHH!!\" vocal hook all add up to what would become the most popular song for all of 1979. I loved it then, and I still love it now!!! One of THE true classic rock anthems of all time and a perfect end to a nearly-perfect AT40 show.)\n\nBack to Top Logged\n\nPost by mkarns on\n\nI guess I'll try my hand at last week's 9/20/80 list. I thought it was mostly very good:\n\n40: DON'T YA WANNA PLAY THIS GAME NO MORE - ELTON JOHN (poignant; only debut of week)\n\n39: OLD FASHION LOVE - THE COMMODORES (OK, but couldn't hear some of it)\n\n38: FIRST TIME LOVE - LIVINGSTON TAYLOR (good; as you might expect, he sounds almost like James)\n\n37: MORE LOVE - KIM CARNES (fine Smokey Robinson remake)\n\n36: WHO'LL BE THE FOOL TONIGHT - LARSON-FEITEN BAND (talented backup musicians, but song was nothing special.)\n\n35: IT'S STILL ROCK AND ROLL TO ME - BILLY JOEL (good, rocking song)\n\n34: YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOUR LOVE FOR ME - JERMAINE JACKSON (good, but skipped part of it)\n\n33: HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE BACK - DARYL HALL & JOHN OATES (heard only part; OK)\n\n32: HOW DO I SURVIVE - AMY HOLLAND (uptempo song with Holland's husband, Michael McDonald, singing backup; one of many guest appearances he did around this time.)\n\n31: LET MY LOVE OPEN THE DOOR - PETE TOWNSEND (brilliant, catchy solo hit)\n\n30: BOULEVARD - JACKSON BROWNE (great)\n\n29: TAKE YOUR TIME - S.O.S. BAND (excellent)\n\n28: INTO THE NIGHT - BENNY MARDONES (OK, but first verse lyrics are a bit uncomfortable, when you think about it. Hit again in 1989.)\n\n27: MAGIC - OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN (great)\n\n26: NO NIGHT SO LONG - DIONNE WARWICK (powerfully sung ballad; similar to \"I'll Never Love This Way Again\")\n\n25: WOMAN IN LOVE - BARBRA STREISAND (subtly catchy; Barry Gibb's production worked well)\n\n24: LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME - BOZ SCAGGS (very good)\n\n23: JESSE - CARLY SIMON (excellent)\n\n22: NEVER KNEW LOVE LIKE THIS BEFORE - STEPHANIE MILLS (great)\n\n21: SOMEONE THAT I USED TO LOVE - NATALIE COLE (nice, old-fashioned jazz/pop feel; reminded me of something her father might have done)\n\n20: HE'S SO SHY - POINTER SISTERS (expertly sung, as you'd expect from the Pointers)\n\n19: DON'T ASK ME WHY - BILLY JOEL (OK, but not one of his best)\n\n18: HOT ROD HEARTS - ROBBIE DUPREE (so-so)\n\n17: REAL LOVE - DOOBIE BROTHERS (good sample of their sound at the time)\n\n16: ALL OVER THE WORLD - ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA (not one of their better songs)\n\n15: SAILING - CHRISTOPHER CROSS (either relaxing or dull, depending on your perspective)\n\n14: YOU'LL ACCOMP'NY ME - BOB SEGER (very good)\n\n13: YOU'RE THE ONLY WOMAN - AMBROSIA (sounds like the McDonald-era Doobies)\n\n12: XANADU - OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN (appealing in a campy way; I hear it now and think of Roger the alien from \"American Dad\" singing it with an Olivia-esque blond wig on his head.)\n\n11: I'M ALRIGHT - KENNY LOGGINS (great rocker; first of his many 1980s soundtrack hits.)\n\n10: EMOTIONAL RESCUE - ROLLING STONES (not one of their best, but it is neat hearing Mick Jagger both sing in falsetto and speak.)\n\n9: ONE IN A MILLION YOU - LARRY GRAHAM (nice soul ballad)\n\n8: DRIVING MY LIFE AWAY - EDDIE RABBIT (great rockabilly-style song)\n\n7: LATE IN THE EVENING - PAUL SIMON (excellent; beat and horns hint toward his later world music approach)\n\n6: GIVE ME THE NIGHT - GEORGE BENSON (good dance music/jazz fusion)\n\n5: LOOKING FOR LOVE - JOHNNY LEE (nice midtempo country/pop)\n\n4: FAME - IRENE CARA (last of 8 soundtrack hits in countdown; a classic)\n\n3: ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST - QUEEN (also classic)\n\n2: ALL OUT OF LOVE - AIR SUPPLY (some call it schlock, but it's pretty powerful, and enduring, as it's recently turned up in TV commercials and elsewhere)\n\n1: UPSIDE DOWN - DIANA ROSS (collaborating with Chic's Rogers & Edwards worked out great.)\n\nPost by coldcardinal on\n\nI'll do 9/1/84, which was recently featured on XM. This was the beginning of 6th grade for me, and the tail end of a bad summer.\n\n40: LUCKY STAR - MADONNA (I like Borderline better; caused rapid uptick in Madonna-bes around my elementary school)\n\n39: ONLY WHEN YOU LEAVE - SPANDAU BALLET (not particularly memorable)\n\n38: TWO SIDES OF LOVE - SAMMY HAGAR (see #39)\n\n37: THERE GOES MY BABY - DONNA SUMMER (decent remake)\n\n36: 17 - RICK JAMES (I think he phoned this one in. Sounds more like a caricature of his sexy funk style)\n\n35: GO INSANE - LINDSAY BUCKINGHAM (great overlooked song -- catchy beat)\n\n34: THE LUCKY ONE - LAURA BRANIGAN (I loved this one. Still do, despite the cheese factor)\n\n33: I JUST CALLED TO SAY I LOVE YOU - STEVIE WONDER (didn't like it, but it's grown on me over the last 24 years)\n\n32: PANAMA - VAN HALEN (blah. It just made me want to hear I'll Wait)\n\n31: RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE - EURYTHMICS (not one of their more inspired compositions)\n\n30: TORTURE -THE JACKSONS (I like the dark, ominous feel. Works best on AM radio w/ bad reception)\n\n29: DANCING IN THE DARK - BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (has grown on me tremendously as an adult -- \"I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book\" could be my motto)\n\nLDD: BELIEVE IT OR NOT – JOEY SCARBURY (ah, late summer 1981)\n\n28: HARD HABIT TO BREAK - CHICAGO (fabulous, intense composition -- this was one of their creative peaks, IMO)\n\n27: LEAVE A TENDER MOMENT ALONE - BILLY JOEL (my least favorite of the 6 A.I.M. singles)\n\n26: WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT - TWISTED SISTER (never cared for it)\n\n25: SAD SONGS (SAY SO MUCH) - ELTON JOHN (another strong tune from his great mid-80s era)\n\n24: SEXY GIRL - GLENN FREY (not a GF highlight)\n\n23: WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES - NIGHT RANGER (just makes me want to hear Sister Christian)\n\n22: COVER ME - BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (strong, often overlooked single)\n\n21: CRUEL SUMMER - BANANARAMA (beautiful song -- even remakes can't ruin it)\n\n20: DYNAMITE - JERMAINE JACKSON (not nearly as bad as his follow-up)\n\n19: ALL OF YOU - JULIO IGLESIAS & DIANA ROSS (yawn)\n\n18: STATE OF SHOCK - THE JACKSONS (I never realized just how rambling and disorganized this one was -- good vibe, though)\n\n17: ROCK ME TONIGHT - BILLY SQUIER (doesn't age well)\n\n16: THE GLAMOROUS LIFE - SHEILA E (solid tune, showing off her percussion skills)\n\n15: ROUND AND ROUND - RATT (one of the great hair-metal songs)\n\n14: DRIVE – THE CARS (RIP Benjamin Orr. This was a great one)\n\n13: LIGHTS OUT - PETER WOLF (maybe a bit too clever and stylized -- but very catchy)\n\n12: I CAN DREAM ABOUT YOU – DAN HARTMAN (. . .speaking of RIP. I liked it as a kid, love it as an adult)\n\n11: THE WARRIOR - SCANDAL FEATURING PARRY SMYTH (pretty good)\n\n10: IF EVER YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN - PEABO BRYSON (meh)\n\n9: IF THIS IT - HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS (not my favorite from Sports -- but definitely good)\n\n8: LET'S GO CRAZY - PRINCE & THE REVOLUTION (pretty good song from a fabulous album)\n\n7: SUNGLASSES AT NIGHT - COREY HART (one of my favorites from one of my favorites)\n\n6: SHE BOP - CYNDI LAUPER (wow, that is one dirty song. Not that there's anything wrong with that)\n\nLDD: HEARTLIGHT – NEIL DIAMOND (Oh, jeez. Well, at least it's not Through the Years)\n\n5: WHEN DOVES CRY - PRINCE (awesome)\n\n4: GHOSTBUSTERS - RAY PARKER JR. (not so awesome)\n\n3: STUCK ON YOU - LIONEL RICHIE (I like that this charted pop, soul, and country)\n\n2: MISSING YOU - JOHN WAITE (gets better with age. JW was an underrated cheese-pop writer/singer)\n\n1: WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT - TINA TURNER (yeah yeah, great story. But I never cared for it)\n\nPost by laura on\n\nI'm bored now, so I'll take on 9/4/82, which played a couple of weeks ago.\n\n40: LOVE OR LET ME BE LONELY - PAUL DAVIS (did not realize this was a remake, but still a decent rendition. RIP)\n\n39: GLORIA - LAURA BRANIGAN (yes, this is my favorite song on the show, though the video left much to be desired. Another great talent that we lost too early)\n\n38: LET ME GO - RAY PARKER JR. (boring)\n\n37: I RAN - A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS (rather funky song, imo. The guy's hair was silly)\n\nLDD: FOLLOW YOU, FOLLOW ME - GENESIS (the LDD was rather touching. Nothing like complete strangers helping somebody in need)\n\n36: SOMEDAY, SOMEWAY - MARSHALL CRENSHAW (pretty good song, even though this was the first time I heard it)\n\n35: NEVER BEEN IN LOVE - RANDY MEISNER (skipped this tune)\n\n34: VALLEY GIRL - FRANK & MOON ZAPPA (hilarious song)\n\n33: OUT OF WORK - GARY U.S. BONDS (was he trying to imitate Springsteen?)\n\n32: DO YOU WANNA TOUCH ME - JOAN JETT & THE BLACKHEARTS (This song rocks...literally)\n\n31: WHAT'S FOREVER FOR - MICHAEL MURPHY (not very good)\n\n30: HOLD ON - SANTANA (prefer his stuff from \"Supernatural\")\n\n29: ROSANNA - TOTO (I wonder what happened to those two after this song feel off the charts)\n\n28: I KEEP FORGETTIN' - MICHAEL McDONALD (another personal favorite song)\n\n27: LET ME TICKLE YOUR FANCY - JERMAINE JACKSON (not as good as Michael)\n\n26: HOT IN THE CITY - BILLY IDOL (rather his later songs over this)\n\n25: KIDS IN AMERICA - KIM WILDE (a very nice-sounding song, kind of a cult classic)\n\n24: SOMEBODY'S BABY - JACKSON BROWNE (pretty good)\n\n23: BLUE EYES - ELTON JOHN (what happened to the guy at that time?)\n\n22: AND I'M TELLING YOU I'M NOT GOING - JENNIFER HOLLIDAY (hate to say this, but Jennifer Hudson puts her to shame)\n\n21: ONLY TIME WILL TELL - ASIA (yet another favorite)\n\n20: YOU CAN DO MAGIC - AMERICA (not really my scene)\n\n19: ONLY THE LONELY - THE MOTELS (the singer sounds great, but the other parts of the song I did not really care for)\n\n18: KEEP THE FIRE BURNIN' - REO SPEEDWAGON (not as memorable as \"Keep On Loving You\" imo)\n\n17: THINK I'M IN LOVE - EDDIE MONEY (gives a needed rocky edge to the countdown)\n\n16: AMERICAN MUSIC - THE POINTER SISTERS (not exactly my fave from the Pointers)\n\n15: WHO CAN IT BE NOW - MEN AT WORK (quintessential 80s song!!)\n\n14: EYE IN THE SKY - THE ALAN PARSONS PROJECT (a nice and calm song. Very relaxing)\n\nLDD: THE LEADER OF THE BAND – DAN FOGELBERG (yawn, but still RIP)\n\n13: LOVE WILL TURN YOU AROUND - KENNY ROGERS (can't have an early 80s survey without classic country!)\n\n12: LOVE IS IN CONTROL - DONNA SUMMER (very dancy and discoy, but I like it)\n\n11: JACK AND DIANE - JOHN COUGAR (classic Mellencamp, though he did not call himself that yet lol)\n\n10: TAKE IT AWAY - PAUL McCARTNEY (rather the Beatles, like I said before)\n\n9: WASTED ON THE WAY - CROSBY, STILLS AND NASH (CS&N, not really my faves)\n\n8: VACATION - THE GO-GO'S (a fine rock tune, remember hearing this in a Rugrats episode)\n\n7: HURTS SO GOOD - JOHN COUGAR (Again, more classic Mellencamp)\n\nEXTRA: SHOW ME – JOE TEX (never heard of the guy. Sry)\n\n6: YOU SHOULD HEAR HOW SHE TALKS ABOUT YOU - MELISSA MANCHESTER (low point in the show)\n\n5: EVEN THE NIGHTS ARE BETTER - AIR SUPPLY (see #6)\n\n4: HOLD ME - FLEETWOOD MAC (what do you expect? It's Fleetwood Mac!! A wonderful ditty)\n\n3: HARD TO SAY I'M SORRY - CHICAGO (another soothing slow song)\n\n2: EYE OF THE TIGER - SURVIVOR (makes me want to get up and go, especially when having to walk long distances on a college campus)\n\n1: ABRACADABRA - THE STEVE MILLER BAND (of all the songs played in this show, this is definitely the guilty pleasure, even though it is kinda cheesy)\n\nAnd for coldcardinal, I once had to do a dance routine to \"She Bop\". I was nine years old and had to wear a very-colorful costume. Later in life, I realized what the song was about, and I kinda felt a little weird. I did a dance to a song about...can't think of a metaphor!\n\nPost by mkarns on\n\nGoing back a couple more weeks, my impressions of 8/31/85:\n\n40: NO LOOKIN’ BACK – MICHAEL McDONALD (faster than most of his hits; kind of like \"Sweet Freedom\")\n\n39: C-I-T-Y – JOHN CAFFERTY & THE BEAVER BROWN BAND (not bad, but felt like much-watered down Springsteen)\n\n38: I WONDER IF I TAKE YOU HOME – LISA LISA & CULT JAM WITH FULL FORCE (good Latin-ish beat. Very loud percussion.)\n\n37: EVERY STEP OF THE WAY – JOHN WAITE (decent; in \"Missing You\" mode)\n\n36: LIVE EVERY MOMENT – REO SPEEDWAGON (upbeat, positive message)\n\n35: WHEN YOUR HEART IS WEAK – COCK ROBIN (pretty dull)\n\n34: STATE OF THE HEART – RICK SPRINGFIELD (OK, but not as good as Rick's earlier, more guitar-based rockers.)\n\n33: ROCK ME TONIGHT – FREDDIE JACKSON (first hit set style for quintessential 80s \"love man\" R&B singer)\n\n32: GLORY DAYS – BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (great baseball/nostalgia anthem)\n\n31: SAVING ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU – WHITNEY HOUSTON (beautiful)\n\n30: LONELY ‘OL NIGHT – JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP (good but he's done better)\n\n29: CRY – GODLEY & CREME (the video, with the changing face images, is memorable; the song not as much)\n\n28: TAKE ON ME – A-HA (also probably best known for video, but song stands very well on its own.)\n\n27: THERE MUST BE AN ANGEL – EURYTHMICS (good, with Stevie Wonder's harmonica a nice touch)\n\n26: OH SHEILA – READY FOR THE WORLD (deriviative of Prince, but great, fast R&B.)\n\n25: SHAME – THE MOTELS (well sung if overproduced; earlier hits were better.)\n\n24: MYSTERY LADY – BILLY OCEAN (fine midtempo soul)\n\n23: DRESS YOU UP - MADONNA (less memorable than other \"Like a Virgin\" singles, but still good)\n\n22: YOU SPIN ME ROUND (LIKE A RECORD) – DEAD OR ALIVE (great club anthem with frenetic beat)\n\n21: WHO’S HOLDING DONNA NOW – DEBARGE (soothing but catchy)\n\n20: LIFE IN ONE DAY – HOWARD JONES (upbeat with a message, like Jones' previous \"Things Can Only Get Better.)\n\n19: EVERYTIME YOU GO AWAY – PAUL YOUNG (Daryl Hall song done well)\n\n18: IF YOU LOVE SOMEBODY SET THEM FREE - STING (first solo hit allowed him to stretch out and incorporate more of a jazz/soul feel while keeping a memorable hook)\n\n17: SMOKIN’ IN THE BOYS ROOM – MOTLEY CRUE (fun remake of 70s hit)\n\n16: DARE ME – THE POINTER SISTERS (fun and catchy, though obviously not a good lead in for a somber story--you know what I'm alluding to.)\n\n15: WHAT ABOUT LOVE - HEART (lovely)\n\n14: FREEDOM – WHAM! (not bad, but take or leave for me)\n\n13: POP LIFE - PRINCE & THE REVOLUTION (interesting pop/psychedelic flavor; purportedly incorporates a tape of him being booed off the stage opening for the Rolling Stones)\n\n12: INVINCIBLE (THEME FROM “THE LEGEND OF BILLIE JEAN”) – PAT BENATAR (awesome)\n\n11: DON’T LOSE MY NUMBER – PHIL COLLINS (not his best; I mostly associate it with what I think was a dumb video)\n\n10: MONEY FOR NOTHING – DIRE STRAITS (cool song on its own, though not entirely representative of their other stuff.)\n\n9: YOU’RE ONLY HUMAN (SECOND WIND) – BILLY JOEL (Billy goes pop-psychological with a memorable chorus, though when I hear it now I imagine Dr. Phil with a piano.)\n\n8: CHERISH – KOOL & THE GANG (nap time)\n\n7: NEVER SURRENDER – COREY HART (Lots of uplifting messages in this week's songs. I think this is OK but somewhat bland)\n\n6: SHOUT – TEARS FOR FEARS (I liked it then, though it's been overplayed with time)\n\n5: SUMMER OF ‘69 – BRYAN ADAMS (Attempt at conjuring up 60s nostalgia does the same for the 80s for me. Very good.)\n\n4: WE DON’T NEED ANOTHER HERO (THUNDERDOME) – TINA TURNER (Tina in Mad Max--expectedly great)\n\n3: FREEWAY OF LOVE – ARETHA FRANKLIN (What do you expect? The Queen of Soul on top of her game.)\n\n2: ST. ELMO’S FIRE (MAN IN MOTION) – JOHN PARR (Quintessential 80s soundtrack anthem.)\n\n1: THE POWER OF LOVE – HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS (Lewis' upbeat pop at its best)\n\nPost by freakyflybry on\n\nI'll give this a try, and I'll usually just critique whatever 80's AT40 show was on that week.\n\n40. The Motels - Suddenly Last Summer (debut) - I like this one, about the same as \"Only The Lonely\"\n\n39. Moody Blues - Sitting At The Wheel (debut) - This is okay but they've had so much better... they started to sound the same in the 80's.\n\n38. Madness - It Must Be Love (debut) - forgot how this goes\n\n37. Prince - Delirious (debut) - it's ok but one of my least favourites from him\n\n36. The Kinks - Don't Forget To Dance (debut) - forgot how this goes\n\n35. Stevie Nicks - Stand Back (24) - great song! One of her best solo songs\n\n34. Peabo Bryson & Roberta Flack - Tonight I Celebrate My Love (36) - this is pretty decent... one of a very few Roberta Flack songs I can tolerate\n\n33. George Benson - Lady Love Me (30) - forgot how this goes\n\n32. Robert Plant - Big Log (32) - it's not bad but kinda boring\n\n31. Juice Newton - Tell Her No (31) - it's not bad, but she's had better; still it was nice to hear after \"Love's Been A Little Bit Hard On Me\" was shafted as no 1982 shows with that on it were aired this year\n\n30. Sheena Easton - Telefone (Long Distance Love Affair) (37) - good song... she's still had a few better though\n\n29. The Fixx - One Thing Leads To Another (38) - great song! My favourite on the show so far\n\n28. Talking Heads - Burning Down The House (33) - an 80's mix show essential! Love this one\n\n27. Elton John - Kiss The Bride (28) - he's had many better but this is good too, and very typical of his 80's sound\n\n26. Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton - Islands In The Stream (34) - my favourite song from both artists! Still, I prefer \"Ghetto Superstar\" that sampled this!\n\n25. Jeffrey Osborne - Don't You Get So Mad (27) - okay, I won't get mad. This song is okay, but he's had better (especially \"Stay With Me Tonight\", and \"You Should Be Mine\" was okay too)\n\n24. David Bowie - China Girl (23) - great song! One of my favourites from him\n\n23. Shalamar - Dead Giveaway (25) - it's so-so, not big on Shalamar in general\n\n22. Men At Work - It's A Mistake (16) - this wasn't a mistake! It was a great song!\n\nLDD: Journey - Faithfully - great song! It really fit the dedication well\n\n21. Rick Springfield - Human Touch (18) - good song, even if it sounds like all his others.\n\n20. Human League - (Keep Feeling) Fascination (12) - good song! I prefer \"Don't You Want Me\" and \"Human\" though\n\n19. Laura Branigan - How Am I Supposed To Live Without You (20) - this wasn't bad but I generally prefer her on uptempo synthpop songs... I actually think Michael Bolton did this better\n\n18. Culture Club - I'll Tumble 4 Ya (10) - funky song, I like this one much as I do with their first few hits\n\n17. Spandau Ballet - True (22) - love this! Very recognizeable and classic\n\n16. The Police - King of Pain (21) - great song! One of their best\n\n15. Naked Eyes - Promises, Promises (19) - I like this but prefer \"Always Something There To Remind Me\"\n\n14. Frank Stallone - Far From Over (17) - it's okay but nothing special\n\n13. Jackson Browne - Lawyers In Love (13) - see what I said above\n\n12. Stray Cats - (She's) Sexy & 17 (14) - I like this but prefer \"Rock This Town\" and \"Stray Cat Strut\"\n\n11. Donna Summer - She Works Hard For The Money (7) - great song! One of my favourites from her\n\n10. Asia - Don't Cry (11) - I like this but I prefer their first 2 hits\n\n9. Air Supply - Making Love Out Of Nothing At All (15) - great song! One of my favourites from them, ironically blocked from #1 by its soundalike still to come!\n\n8. Taco - Puttin' On The Ritz (4) - another 80's mix show essential, very creative spin on a show tune\n\n7. Michael Jackson - Human Nature (9) - good song but I preferred it when SWV sampled this.\n\n6. The Police - Every Breath You Take (6) - great song! Despite the overplay, it's held up well for me\n\n5. Eurythmics - Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) (2) - great song! No wonder the bass line was sampled in so many remixes as it's so classic\n\n4. Bonnie Tyler - Total Eclipse Of The Heart (8) - great song! One of the most powerful vocal songs on this chart\n\n3. Men Without Hats - The Safety Dance (3) - another 80's mix show essential... I like this one, but prefer the short version (as I'm sure Chris does too)\n\n2. Billy Joel - Tell Her About It (5) - good song! One of his best but he's still had better\n\n1. Michael Sembello - Maniac (1) - good song! Another 80's mix show essential\n\nPost by laura on\n\nNice job freakyflybry! Here's my opinions on the show:\n\n40: SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER – THE MOTELS (so-so, but still pretty good)\n\n39: SITTING AT THE WHEEL – THE MOODY BLUES(not really what I expected to hear from an artsy band like them. Catchy though)\n\n38: IT MUST BE LOVE - MADNESS(Didn't recognize the song at first, but as I kept listening, I then realized it was from a Levi's commercial that aired a few years back. Great btw)\n\n37: DELIRIOUS - PRINCE (nice funky song from the 1999 album)\n\n36: DON’T FORGET TO DANCE – THE KINKS (meh)\n\n35: STAND BACK – STEVIE NICKS (one of my favorites on the show!!!)\n\n34: TONIGHT I CELEBRATE MY LOVE – PEABO BRYSON AND ROBERTA FLACK (boring)\n\n33: LADY LOVE ME – GEORGE BENSON (rather \"Turn Your Love Around\")\n\n32: BIG LOG – ROBERT PLANT (fine song. The beat gets repetitive after a while)\n\n31: TELL HER NO – JUICE NEWTON (I skipped this one)\n\n30: TELEFONE (LONG DISTANCE LOVE AFFAIR) – SHEENA EASTON (such a cute song! Love it!)\n\n29: ONE THING LEADS TO ANOTHER – THE FIXX (another fave)\n\n28: BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE – TALKING HEADS (one of the more interesting songs, doesn't hurt that it was a great song)\n\n27: KISS THE BRIDE – ELTON JOHN (personally, I prefer his stuff from later on in the eighties)\n\n26: ISLANDS IN THE STREAM – KENNY ROGERS WITH DOLLY PARTON (a cute little duet)\n\n25: DON’T YOU GET SO MAD – JEFFREY OSBORNE (ok, but not his best by a longshot)\n\n24: CHINA GIRL – DAVID BOWIE (pretty good song. Funny even)\n\n23: DEAD GIVEAWAY - SHALAMAR (has a really good beat to it, but my fave is the song they did for Footloose)\n\n22: IT’S A MISTAKE – MEN AT WORK (not as good as Down Under or Who Can It Be Now, but acceptable)\n\nLDD: FAITHFULLY - JOURNEY (video aside, this song is sweet)\n\n21: HUMAN TOUCH – RICK SPRINGFIELD (not his best, I'll tell ya that)\n\n20: (KEEP FEELING) FASCINATION – THE HUMAN LEAGUE (I like this song)\n\n19: HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU – LAURA BRANIGAN (another favorite.

Starship - We Built This City (debut) - great song! Seems more like their style evolved rather than suddenly changed for me as \"No Way Out\", despite being under the Jefferson Starship name, sounded more like a Starship song.\n\n39. Glenn Frey - You Belong To The City (debut) - What are the odds of 2 City songs debuting back to back? This song's pretty good, one of his best solo songs\n\n38. The Hooters - And We Danced (debut) - dancing at Hooters? I wonder what was on their mind when they came up with their name? Anyway, the song's pretty good\n\n37. Bryan Adams - One Night Love Affair (debut) - good song but he's had better\n\n36. ABC - Be Near Me (debut) - good song, one of my favourites from them\n\n35. Bryan Adams - Summer Of '69 (21) - remember what I said about One Night Love Affair? Well, this is one of the better songs that I was hinting at, as it's one of my favourites from him\n\nLDD: Beach Boys - In My Room - the song's pretty good, especially considering they're not really known for doing ballads\n\n34. Don Henley - Sunset Grill (40) - good song but I generally prefer his top 10 hits\n\n33. Eurythmics - There Must Be An Angel (22) - good song, but they had a few better\n\n32. UB40 & Chrissie Hynde - I Got You Babe (28) - very typical of a UB40 remake, but it was pretty good... still, I prefer the original\n\n31. Paul Young - I'm Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down (38) - I like this, but I think it's my least favourite top 40 hit from him\n\n30. Night Ranger - Four In The Morning (35) - good song but I prefer their previous 3 top 40 hits; still, I prefer this over \"Don't Tell Me You Love Me\" and \"Goodbye\"\n\n29. Hall & Oates with David Ruffin & Eddie Kendricks - The Way You Do The Things You Do/My Girl (Live at the Apollo) (31) - it was okay, but it was TOO LONG! Probably one of my least favourites from them\n\n28. Tears For Fears - Head Over Heels (39) - great song! I still prefer \"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\" though\n\n27. Billy Joel - You're Only Human (18) - good song, good message... still, prefer many other Billy songs\n\n26. Motley Crue - Smokin' In The Boys Room (20) - one of my favourite songs from them... I know it's a remake but I don't know the original\n\n25. John Waite - Every Step Of The Way (26) - it wasn't bad but one I'd need to hear more to appreciate\n\n24. Loverboy - Lovin' Every Minute Of It (30) - great song! One of my favourites from them\n\n23. Aretha Franklin - Freeway of Love (16) - one of my favourites from her, great comeback single\n\n22. Jan Hammer - Miami Vice Theme (37) - for an instrumental, this was surprisingly decent\n\n21. Pat Benatar - Invincible (12) - great song! One of my favourites from her though I do prefer stuff like \"Love Is A Battlefield\"\n\n20. Bruce Springsteen - I'm Goin' Down (29) - I like this but it's my least favourite \"Born In The U.S.A.\" single\n\n19. John Cafferty & the Beaver Brown Band - C-I-T-Y (25) - not bad, but I prefer some of their other stuff\n\n18. Godley & Creme - Cry (19) - it's ok but not really anything that special\n\n17. Huey Lewis & the News - The Power of Love (8) - great song! One of their best and one of the best 80's movie themes\n\n16. Sting - Fortress Around Your Heart (23) - great song, one of his best solo songs\n\nLDD: John Lennon - Imagine - classic song... but such a sad LDD about Samantha Smith\n\n15. Stevie Wonder - Part-Time Lover (24) - one of my favourites from him, he was still on top of his game at this point\n\n14. Pointer Sisters - Dare Me (11) - I like this but prefer many others... still, I guess they were more careful about not placing the death dedication after this song!\n\n13.

Mick Jagger & David Bowie - Dancing In The Street (17) - a good duet, one that worked well for charity\n\n10. John Mellencamp - Lonely Ol' Night (15) - I like this but I prefer many other songs from him, I doubt it would even rank in my top 10 from him\n\n9. Whitney Houston - Saving All My Love For You (14) - another good song but Whitney's had so many better\n\n8. John Parr - St. Elmo's Fire (3) - great song! Another one of those 80's classic movie themes, seems like there were a lot on the chart around this time in 1985\n\n7. A-Ha - Take On Me (13) - great song! An 80's mix show essential\n\n6. Madonna - Dress You Up (10) - I like this but she's had dozens of better songs\n\n5. Ready For The World - Oh Sheila (9) - good song, but not one of my absolute favourites\n\n4. Phil Collins - Don't Lose My Number (5) - great song! One of my favourite Phil songs\n\n3. Wham! - Freedom (6) - I like most of their other hits better but this is still good\n\n2. Kool & the Gang - Cherish (2) - one of my favourites from them... despite being known for their uptempo songs, they did a ballad quite well\n\n1. Dire Straits - Money For Nothing (1) - classic! I want my MTV to actually play music videos"
