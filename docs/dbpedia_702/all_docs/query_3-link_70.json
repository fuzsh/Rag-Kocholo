        "text": "Welcome to Monday‚Äôs Music Moves Me on Sundays! This week‚Äôs challenge is to build your song picks around April-born singers, songwriters, or musicians.\n\nI picked a single artist, Paul Lavon Davis, born April 21,1948. The American singer, songwriter was known for his hits from the 70s. I only knew him as a pop singer but his career crossed genres. His songwriting gave him a few #1 country hits.\n\nIn the playlist, the first five tracks are singles and the last four tracks are #1 country duets and a country single.\n\n‚ÄúI Go Crazy‚Äù I remember well and I totally forgot about his hit songs. He recorded ‚ÄúRide ‚ÄòEm Cowboy‚Äù in 1974 and it peaked #4 on Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, #23 on Billboard Hot 100, and #47 on the Country chart. His country songs never reached my ears. Davis died April 22, 2008, just one day after his 60th birthday from a heart attack.\n\nOkay, you‚Äôre next. Who or what did you pick? I can‚Äôt wait to hear!\n\nThe 4M co-hostess are featured in my right side bar underneath the banner. The guidelines are simple. Every other week, a suggested (not mandatory) theme is given to build your song picks. YouTube and other music sites have options to create and embed playlists or individual songs into your post. On the off weeks, we dance to whatever music moves you (your choice)! To access the party, add your music post below, and visit others on the dance floor. Let the party begin!\n\nApril is a busy month with the A to Z Challenge for some of you. I am not participating in the annual event. If you‚Äôre taking part in the blog fest, give yourself a pass to share whatever music moves you all month. I invite you to visit the Awww Mondays community hosted Sandee at Comedy Plus. Have a boogietastic week! XüíãXüíã, Cathy\n\nSave"
