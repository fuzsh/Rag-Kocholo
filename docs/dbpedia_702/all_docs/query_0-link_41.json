        "text": "From \"Summertime\" by Ella Fitzgerald to \"Espresso\" by Sabrina Carpenter\n\nFlashpop/Getty Images\n\nWhen I think about summer, al fresco dinner parties are the first thing that come to mind. Also, stylish swimsuits, pool floats and even delicious summer appetizers. But let's face it, the BBQ gathering wouldn't be as epic without a catchy playlist featuring songs about summer.\n\nPerhaps you're in the mood for pop tunes that'll make you dance the night away at a rooftop bar. Or maybe you're just looking to mellow out to some soothing jazz (like Louis Armstrong's “Summer Song”) or other classics that take you straight back to the '70s (like ABBA's “Summer Night City”). No matter your preference, I compiled a comprehensive list of songs that'll have you feeling the warm-weather vibes. Here are the 65 best songs about summer.\n\n1. “Summertime” by Ella Fitzgerald\n\nRelease year: 1935\n\nGenre: Jazz\n\nIt’s one of the most covered songs of all time (with over 25,000 recordings to be exact), so it’s no surprise the original jazz ballad from George Gershwin’s Porgy & Bess is the summer classic.\n\n2. “Summertime Blues” by Eddie Cochran\n\nRelease year: 1958\n\nGenre: Rock & Roll\n\nBasically a teenager himself, gone-too-soon ‘50s rocker Cochran channels that adolescent angst of working all summer long.\n\n3. “Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini” by Bryan Hyland\n\nRelease year: 1960\n\nGenre: Pop Rock\n\nThe cheeky rock-pop song is all about a girl who’s feeling shy showing off her two-piece. While bikinis are everywhere today, the style was considered revealing and daring back in the day. But no matter what you’re wearing—a muumuu or a thong—this golden oldie is fun to bop around to.\n\n4. “Summer Song” by Louis Armstrong\n\nRelease year: 1961\n\nGenre: Jazz\n\nSing along to this ode to the season of sun with lyrics like, “Why must summer, ever end…” and, “Love, to me, is like a summer day,” as you pine for those long June through August days.\n\n5. “Surfin’ Safari” by The Beach Boys\n\nRelease year: 1962\n\nGenre: Surf Rock\n\nIt’s only right that the Beach Boys would make a song about this popular water sport. In fact, they made a few quite a few songs about summer that you should probably check out.\n\n6. “(Love Is Like a) Heatwave” by Martha and the Vandellas\n\nRelease year: 1963\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul\n\nAh, the feeling of the summer heat and love is combined in this '60s hit. With lyrics like, \"It's like a heatwave, burning in my heart...,\" the scorching heat is not the only thing blossoming this season.\n\n7. “Surfer Girl” by The Beach Boys\n\nRelease year: 1963\n\nGenre: Pop Rock/Folk\n\nSomething else the Beach Boys are known for? Their amazing harmonies. In this case, they bring together their love for the surf with their skill for tight chords, and I'm just here rooting for the summer song’s couple to stay together forever…well, at least until fall.\n\n8. “Surfin’ U.S.A.” by The Beach Boys\n\nRelease year: 1963\n\nGenre: Pop Rock/Folk\n\nI don’t even know how to surf, but this is iconic track has me inspired to reach out for a board to chase some gnarly waves. Hang ten, right?\n\n9. “Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer” by Nat King Cole\n\nRelease year: 1963\n\nGenre: Jazz/Funk\n\nGrabbing a bite, catching a movie and spending time at the beach, Nat King Cole croons all about those nostalgic “lazy-hazy-crazy” summer moments.\n\n10. “Surf City” by Jan & Dean\n\nRelease year: 1963\n\nGenre: Surf Music\n\nThis city has it all: summer, surfing and girls. One of the summer songs that will have you falling into this dream where the fun never ends. (Don’t forget your surfboard.)\n\n11. “A Summer Song” by Chad & Jeremy\n\nRelease year: 1964\n\nGenre: Soft Rock/Folk\n\nThe English pop duo sure know a thing or two about lost summer love with lyrics like, “And when the rain, beats against my windowpane, I’ll think of summer days again, and dream of you.”\n\n12. “Under the Boardwalk” by The Drifters\n\nRelease year: 1964\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul\n\nThe best part about warm weather? A chance to hang out at the boardwalk. This soulful hit brings us right back to the our favorite seasonal vacay spots.\n\n13. “California Girls” by The Beach Boys\n\nRelease year: 1965\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nAre you surprised that the Beach Boys repertoire is chock full of summer songs? Well, before Katy Perry, the “Kings of Surf Music” dedicated a whole song to West Coast girls.\n\n14. “Summer in the City” by The Lovin’ Spoonful\n\nRelease year: 1966\n\nGenre: Hard Rock\n\n“All around, people looking half dead, walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head…” Someone sure knows about summers in New York City.\n\n15. “Summer Wind” by Frank Sinatra\n\nRelease year: 1966\n\nGenre: Traditional Pop\n\nWhile Frank Sinatra sang hits like “New York, New York” and “Come Fly with Me,” he also made us wallow in heartbreak with this summer love song.\n\n16. “Summer Rain” by Johnny Rivers\n\nRelease year: 1968\n\nGenre: Pop, Blues, Folk\n\nJohnny Rivers describes the moments he and his love danced all summer long. Talk about a romantic.\n\n17. “Hot Fun in the Summertime” by Sly & The Family Stone\n\nRelease year: 1969\n\nGenre: Psychedelic Soul\n\nBetween the harmonies and upbeat instrumental beats, this soulful track can revive any summer shindig.\n\n18. \"It’s Summer\" by Gladys Knight & the Pips\n\nRelease year: 1969\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul\n\n\"There's magic in the air, Winter's disappeared, It's summer!\" Soul queen Gladys Knight totally captures how to feel about the first days of summer.\n\n19. “Here Comes The Sun” by The Beatles\n\nRelease year: 1969\n\nGenre: Folk Pop\n\nThere are plenty of popular Beatles songs out there, but \"Here Comes The Sun\" is on the top of the list. It's time to leave the dreary winter behind and sing along to \"Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...\"\n\n20. “Summer Breeze” by Seals & Crofts\n\nRelease year: 1972\n\nGenre: Soft Rock\n\nRoll down the car windows, listen to this feel-good song and just take in that chill summer breeze.\n\n21. “School’s Out” by Alice Cooper\n\nRelease year: 1972\n\nGenre: Alternative/Indie\n\nRemember when the last school bell finally rang? Add head-banging beats and rock legend Alice Cooper and you have a heavy-metal version of that exact feeling.\n\n22. “Saturday in the Park” by Chicago\n\nRelease year: 1972\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nInspired by the excitement of Central Park, the band Chicago paints a picture of people coming together to enjoy the weather at one of the most beloved and traversed public places in the city.\n\n23. “Summer” by War\n\nRelease year: 1976\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul\n\nNeed a soulful summer song for your playlist? This first line captures it all: “Ridin’ ‘round town with all the windows down…” That ‘70s feeling is still very much alive in this R&B single.\n\n24. “In the Sun” by Blondie\n\nRelease year: 1976\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nWhile I'll always have “Heart of Glass” and “Rapture” on repeat, this 1976 rock song is the perfect addition to a day at the beach.\n\n25. “Rockaway Beach” By The Ramones\n\nRelease year: 1977\n\nGenre: Alternative/Indie\n\nThis 1977 song is an ode to the largest public beach in Queens, and it might just convince you to book your next getaway to the sandy shore.\n\n26. “You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night)” by Meat Loaf\n\nRelease year: 1977\n\nGenre: Alternative/Indie, Pop, Hard Rock\n\nIf anyone can sing passionately about a summer fling, it’s Meatloaf. Take it from the singer, “There’s not another moment to waste!” and make the most out of the steamy season.\n\n27. “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers\n\nRelease year: 1977\n\nGenre: Adult Contemporary\n\nCelebrating warmer weather is one thing, but why not take it up a notch by serenading your partner with this cozy classic?\n\n28. “Summer Nights” by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John\n\nRelease year: 1978\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nHere's to one of the best movie soundtracks and top summer songs to ever exist. The iconic duet between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John will have you singing “tell me more, tell me more” as their characters relay their memories of the months they spent together.\n\n29. “Sun Is Shining” by Bob Marley\n\nRelease year: 1978\n\nGenre: Reggae\n\nWith lyrics like “Sun is shining, the weather is sweet...Make you wanna move your dancing feet now,” it brings back memories of barbecues and chill summer days.\n\n30. “Hot Stuff” by Donna Summer\n\nRelease year: 1979\n\nGenre: Disco/Dance\n\nWhile it's not really about summer, the funky melody and Donna's vocals are enough to make you want to hit the dance floor this season. (Plus, Summer is literally her name. That has to count for something, right?)\n\n31. “Summer Night City” by ABBA\n\nRelease year: 1979\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nThis Swedish pop group has some of the most iconic songs in music history (Think: “Dancing Queen,” “Mamma Mia,” to name a few). So it’s no surprise they have a summer hit to get you on your feet.\n\n32. “Vacation” by The Go-Gos\n\nRelease year: 1981\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nSiri, play a song about summer that helps us get over someone. This ‘80s jam from the all-girl band The Go-Go’s embodies the struggle of moving on from a summer romance. With punk icon Belinda Carlisle on vocals, I give you permission to rock out.\n\n33. “Cruel Summer” by Bananarama\n\nRelease year: 1983\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nThink crowded cities, burning hot pavement, and the sun beating down on your back, and you’ll get this funky track from another all-female girl group.\n\n34. “Suddenly Last Summer” by The Motels\n\nRelease year: 1983\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nCould this be the ‘80iest song of all time?

Snoop Dogg\n\nRelease year: 2010\n\nGenre: Pop, Dance\n\nOne of the summer anthems of the 2000s, Perry devotes this song to all Cali girls. While you’re dancing to the pop beats, I'll be booking my next vacay to the Golden State.\n\n52. “Summer Time” by Vybz Kartel\n\nRelease year: 2011\n\nGenre: Reggae\n\nIf you're not planning a summer getaway to Jamaica, then this catchy reggae tune will definitely transport you there (for four minutes).\n\n53. “Summertime Sadness” by Lana Del Ray\n\nRelease year: 2012\n\nGenre: Alternative/Indie\n\nLana Del Ray is known for sad love ballads, and, shocker, “Summertime Sadness” is no different. It’ll take you on a rollercoaster of emotions, so I hope you’re strapped in for the ride.\n\n54. “Cruise” by Florida Georgia Line\n\nRelease year: 2012\n\nGenre: Country\n\nIf you're looking to dedicate a summer song to your significant other, this country hit is definitely a flirty way to get someone's attention. (And the remix with Nelly is just as good.)\n\n55. “This Summer” by Superchunk\n\nRelease year: 2012\n\nGenre: Folk, Indie Rock\n\nCelebrate the joys of adventure with lyrics like “We’ve got a clear path down to the sea. We split the city at dark when roads are clear…” and let it inspire your next road trip. Badlands, anyone?\n\n56. “Summer” By Calvin Harris\n\nRelease year: 2014\n\nGenre: Electro House\n\nNothing screams summer festivals, friends and dancing until the sun goes down like this 2014 hit by DJ Calvin Harris. The second the beat drops I have no choice but to dance the night away.\n\n57. “Cool for the Summer” by Demi Lovato\n\nRelease year: 2015\n\nGenre: Pop Rock\n\nThe upbeat pop song is all about taking risks and making a move on your summer crush before the season is over. Hey, if Demi Lovato is telling you to go for your crush, it’s gotta be the right move.\n\n60. “Feels Like Summer” by Childish Gambino\n\nRelease: 2018\n\nGenre: R&B\n\nThis Grammy-nominated hit has the perfect recipe for a great summer song—the mellow beats, the impressive vocals from Childish Gambino and seasonal hints. But leave it to the \"This Is America\" artist to also shine a light on a pressing issue like climate change in his lyrics, making the song even more meaningful.\n\n61. “Hot Girl Summer” By Megan Thee Stallion Feat. Nicki Minaj & Ty Dolla $ign\n\nRelease year: 2019\n\nGenre: Hip Hop/Rap\n\nWhen this song came out in 2019, the term “Hot Girl Summer” took over in more ways than one. This powerful female anthem calls women to live their best lives during the sunny season. So blast this summer smash at your next girls’ night.\n\n62. “Watermelon Sugar” by Harry Styles\n\nRelease year: 2019\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nWhile many fans have mixed interpretations of the song’s meaning, you can’t deny that the lyrics and guitar-horn sections give off peak summer vibes.\n\n63. “Cruel Summer” by Taylor Swift\n\nRelease: 2019\n\nGenre: Synth-Pop\n\nNot to be mistaken for the Bananarama's song with the same name (see: #33), Taylor Swift pours her heart out on this pop hit about a whirlwind romance. As she shared during iHeartRadio session, \"This song is one that I wrote about the feeling of a summer romance, and often times a summer romance can be layered with all these feelings of pining away and sometimes even secrecy.\" We've all been there Tay.\n\n64. “Moscow Mule” by Bad Bunny\n\nRelease: 2022\n\nGenre: Reggaeton\n\nWhile the entire Un Verano Sin Ti album is essentially one giant ode to summer, the single \"Moscow Mule\" is the pinnacle. I'm a huge Bad Bunny fan, but don't worry if you can't sing along in Spanish (or understand what he's saying). You can still vibe out and grab the signature summer cocktail while you're at it.\n\n65. “Espresso” by Sabrina Carpenter\n\nRelease: 2024\n\nGenre: Disco/Synth-Pop\n\nI don't know what Sabrina Carpenter put in this catchy song, but I've been singing it nonstop since its release in April 2024. The pop hit is fun and playful—and a great addition for your next pool party playlist. With lyrics like \"My 'give a f***s' are on vacation\" to \"I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer,\" I'm crowning this the song of summer.\n\nRELATED\n\nThe 70 Best Summer Movies of All Time & Where to Watch Them\n\nBeauty and Cultures Editor\n\nWrites trend stories, product reviews and how-tos across beauty, cultures, fashion and entertainment\n\nOver 5 years of experience as a Beauty Editor\n\nStudied journalism with a minor in creative writing at SUNY New Paltz"
