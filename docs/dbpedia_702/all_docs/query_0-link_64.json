        "text": "The personal experience of listening to music is probably my favorite feeling in the entire world. There is nothing more cathartic, more soul-stirring, or more fundamentally interesting than taking in a great album; it just feels like the most intrinsic and natural form of human artistic heights. Getting into music has been my defining experience over the last decade. The slow movement from the music that your parents leave you towards entirely new directions that allow you to discover the eternally vast catalog of human creativity is something that I feel like defines the adolescence of most music fans. There is so much with music, so much to talk about and to dive deeper in to. Within the past 5 years, I have managed to discover bands and artists who have spoken to me in such distinctly personal ways that it sometimes feels like direct communication. And yet I always feel like I have just scraped the tip of the iceberg. I just know there is so much more out there, so many new experiences, music heading into 2020 looks incredibly bright.\n\nThe 2010s were an insanely groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting time in the music industry; the entire experience and market of music has been digitized for better or for worse, and social media and the internet now replace the predominance of the label from the 2000s. Genres were innovated upon in ways that couldn’t even be imagined in 2009; production, sound design, and countless other technical musical aspects are now truly in their golden age of growth and development. Technology has helped musical achievement reach new heights, but these are only the tools. What is even more remarkable is the breakout in the brand new, vastly diverse and unique, and revolutionary voices which were only so rarely accessed in music before. Queer, trans, POC, and all varieties of marginalized voices made their impact and poignancy common knowledge; the 2010s were the decade where the music industry truly lost white heteronormative orthodoxy as its defining trait. So many new genres, new ideas and forms, and even experiments in what music itself is have become prominent. The 2010s were the new apex of musical change and innovation.\n\nAfter months of subconsciously thinking about how I would order my favorites from this decade, eventually, I couldn’t help but put the time into doing something like this. It felt right to me, and I genuinely appreciate anyone who shares in this experience with me. I really do think these are the best 100 albums of the decade, and I will attempt, with increasing fervor, to offer why I think so. However, the line between “best” and “favorite” is always a strange territory to me; because music is such a subjective experience, all music criticism is personal judgment by its very nature. Thus, I understand how personal this list is, and I hope that, in a way, it maybe helps the project: this is really just one experience of music, categorized just for the sake of it. Thank you for reading.\n\nMitski’s popularity exploded with Be The Cowboy, partially as a testament to the excellence of her earlier career, but largely because the album is a culmination of her journey and her most polished and researched sound to date. She has found her songwriting niche as the master of vagueness and subtlety; lines like the choruses of “Two Slow Dancers” and the lines about venus and global warming which manage to be heart-wrenching and desolate despite being trivial at a surface level. Mitski challenges you to understand the struggles she faces and her reckoning with past abusive relationships through the same lens that she does. She executes this challenge by creating compelling, haunting, and universally appealing music that is even more rewarding to those who relisten and attempt to dig deeper into what the album has to offer. It is one of the most layered releases to be put out in years and is a testament to the power of songwriting and poetry. Oh, and her singing is still, like, top 5 in the business right now. That helps a lot too.\n\n56 | Weyes Blood - Titanic Rising (2019)\n\nDoris is, far and away, the best of the early Odd Future efforts and is emblematic of an era of a group which would go on to create their own subculture and music genres. Earl’s flow is insanely developed in comparison to his experience on this album; songs with Vince Staples are some of the most technically precise and contrite tracks put out this decade. The album is ripe in the way of good features; Tyler The Creator drops his early obnoxious public persona and delivers his most endearing bars from the era, Domo Genesis has his only good verse maybe ever, and handfull of the less-recognized voices in the Odd Future extended universe make some of their best contributions. Earl Sweatshirt, even at a young age, was fully-cognizant of the depths of evil and destruction felt by those living in capitalist societies, and his music reflects a sort of youthful jadedness and anger which has become the political fuel for generations of leftist young people. He was one of the first to tap into this feeling in our generation, and the one who probably still does it the best.\n\n28 | 21 Savage, Offset, and Metro Boomin - Without Warning (2017)\n\nAs much as I am tempted to just write the word “gec” 1,000 times for this blurb, it would be a disservice not to talk about how forward-thinking this album is and how genre-defining it will come to be. Laura Les and Dylan Brady have created the best Bubblegum Bass album to exist yet, and it would be a good world if the sounds and bold new choices made by the duo came to define the genre. Equal parts a child of early 2010s internet culture and early 2000s nostalgia, 1000 gecs is a celebration of the complexity of queer existence in a dystopian and confusing modern-day world. There are poppy poignant love songs which embody this queer experience, such as “Ringtone” and “gec 2 Ü,” just as much as there are insane otherworldly nether dimension bangers such as “800db cloud” and “money machine,” which feel as if they were born from the bottom of a pirated 2004 version of GarageBand gone rouge. 1000 Gecs says a lot, and it says it in all 23 minutes. Even more than that, it feels like they got across what they wanted to say, in their own Gectastic way. 1000 gecs is also impressive because it has the best Ska song of the decade on it, and that's nuts.\n\n24 | The Avalanches - Wildflower (2016)\n\nSome Rap Songs is a live look into the inception of a completely-new genre being crafted in real-time. There are incredibly few and far between instances for the listener to be able to witness someone cracking into a completely new, completely off-the-wall way of approaching music. Earl Sweatshirt, with Some Rap Songs (and the also-brilliant follow-up EP Feet Of Clay), is doing precisely that; messing with time signatures, avant-garde jazz riffs, freeform production, and monotone depressing lyrics, all of which come together in the cauldron of creativity to brew up an entirely new musical concoction. The sound of this album, whose roots can be seen on the more somber parts of Doris such as on “Chum,” is eternally distressing; something about the way this record resonates through your mind feels off, almost otherworldly. However, long after you finish listening to the album, this unease and lack of understanding turns into motivation to listen even more. From this repeated listening, the absolute genius of the production, flow, lyrical content, and the sound of this album manage to imprint themselves on your brain. Some Rap Songs is the definition of a groundbreaker as well as the definition of a grower; I can’t imagine any album I’d say more benefits the listener with repeated listening. This album is meditative yet jaded, cynical and depressed yet whimsical. Some Rap Songs is a victory for artistry and will come to be one of the most influential records of the century.\n\n15 | Lil Uzi Vert - Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World (2016)\n\nJordan Terell Carter is one of the most visionary artists of this generation, and the Playboi Carti Self-Titled is not only an insanely powerful introduction to the music world at large, but an unparalleled celebration of his worldview, and one of the tidiest, most diverse collections of songs that have been put out this decade. Every song on Playboi Carti is completely distinct in both sound and content from its album mates. Somehow, Carti was able to select 12 completely disjunctive, yet insanely polished, song ideas and meld them into a completely realized work. Carti’s self-titled is the perfect embodiment of the Playboi Carti lifestyle, brand, sound, and general approach to the world. Humans are multi-faceted and complicated, so on an album whose concept is himself, Carti captures these differences and personal oddities so well that to listen to this album feels like knowing Carti himself.\n\nNot only is the construction of this album immaculate. Carti is a master of remembering to make the songs good above all else. He exhibits this virtuoso by delivering tunes that never tire, keep on plodding, and even manage to grow on you despite being so out of touch with each other. “Location” has some of the spaciest production I’ve ever heard in a rap song, and it's absolutely cathartic and beautiful; from this track, he moves seamlessly to “Magnolia,” a pop radio hit which feels scientifically designed to be his ‘popular’ song. The songs with Lil Uzi on this album are the peak of the two’s collaborative work, and “New Choppa” with A$AP Rocky elicits terrifying late-night horror carnival vibes. Even deep cuts like “Half & Half,” “NO. 9,” “Kelly K,” and “Yah Mean” are all so creative and charming that you can't help but be won over by Carti and his infallible persona. This is one of the most spirited and well-crafted trap tapes to ever be released and is a landmark of personal achievement in the realm of the self-titled album.\n\n10 | Rihanna - ANTI (2016)\n\nThe phrases ‘sprawling’ and ‘expansive’ are often thrown around in music criticism where they don’t apply. Music writers use these words to define albums that are incredibly well-put-together and long, yet not diverse or epic enough to fit said adjectives. ANTI is the closest definitional album that I can find for those terms that are thrown around far too often; a sprawling pop masterpiece that permeates across all borders and genres of music and comes together under the vision and seemingly god-given natural talent of Rihanna. No album this decade achieves as many different things, and does them all as fantastically, as ANTI does. This record is so consistent that even the 3 bonus tracks are not only essential but worthy of consideration as actual album tracks (I don’t want a world where “Goodnight Gotham” isn’t considered part of the main ANTI canon). This album is truly something special and all too rare in the music scene today; an album that is great largely because of how fully it encapsulates the base definition of great albums. ANTI is a primal exercise in album composition and a test of the limits of diversity and style brought together under one roof of musical genius, and it succeeds more than is possible to describe.\n\n9 | 21 Savage & Metro Boomin - Savage Mode (2016)\n\nSavage Mode is the magnum opus of the most important producer of the decade and a testament to the power that fantastic production can have and the heights to which it can carry an album. Metro Boomin’s beats on this album are the most masterful we’ve ever seen in his career; the culmination of his efforts from 2014 onward and a striking reaffirmation for him as the best producer on the planet. There are very few albums where the artist is more in-tune with the production than the brilliant and haunting 21 Savage is with Metro’s direction. Every word that leaves his mouth is exactly in tune, exactly on time, and strikes even harder than the one that came before it. This is the most technically crafted trap tape that I have ever heard. This tape set the direction for a half-decade of both trap and pop rap and very well may be the peak of the genre.\n\n21 doesn’t need to convince you that he is a hard motherfucker. As soon as you hear the brilliant first two tracks, “No Advance” and “No Heart,” his badassery unquestionably oozes from every pore. As far as innate believability of the lyrics because of the rapping flow, 21 pales only to maybe Pusha T as far as genuineness in delivery. 21 Savage is a fantastic rapper who was able to put behind the amateurishness of his early work on this album, crafting what is far and away a top 10 rap performance for the decade. Savage Mode is the best of every world; lyrics, production, flow, sound, and everything else you could possibly want in a rap album is consummately taken care of by the artists. Metro deserves to have his name on the album, and 21 deserves his place in the pantheon of great rappers of our time.\n\n8 | Mitski - Bury Me At Makeout Creek (2014)\n\nBury Me At Makeout Creek was my high school breakup album, my personal anthems of a young love lost, and the acute pain felt at the time that it occurs. However, to pigeonhole this album as being a breakup record (or even a romantic record) would be a disservice; Mitski is an artist who approaches music from countless different pathways and to define her work as only one thing is wrong. Part singer-songwriter, part rock, and part everything else, Bury Me at Makeout Creek is a stunning record that gets more done in 30 minutes than other artists manage to do with 2-hour efforts. If you’re looking to experience catharsis embodied fully in music, you will find it on this album. If you’re looking to uncover the rawest and most base release of emotion communicated through shredding guitars and heartbreaking vocals, you will find it on this album. If you want precise guitar work, immaculately constructed motifs, and directions you never knew a guitar could go in, you can find it on this album. Regardless of why you find yourself drawn to music as a medium, you will find something positive and wondrous contained in the walls of this brief yet stunning work.\n\nRock as a genre has historically been hostile to voices that are not from the white male perspective, and Mitski’s music is a complete repudiation of this sadly-persistent attitude in the music community. With Bury me At Makeout Creek, Mitski made a better rock and roll album than 99.9% of the rock bands this decade, and it isn’t even really a “full” rock album. Talent is prescribed entirely on bases not related to gender and race, and too long have rock and roll voices and exposure been defined by these archetypes. Mitski’s music is internally defiant of these gender roles and racial definitions of genre, and her music is a full rejection and complete defeat of such patterns of thinking.\n\n7 | Lana Del Rey - Norman Fucking Rockwell! (2019)\n\nNorman Fucking Rockwell is a fabulously introspective and stunningly beautiful exploration of womanhood in America. The record is a love letter to Americana and a testament to the atmosphere that enabled the culturally pervasive Lana Del Rey to grow into the woman and artist she is today. Del Rey’s voice is as good as it's ever been, growing even sweeter and more daunting with age; as a result, NFR is one of the most stunning vocal performances of all time. Lana kills it, and she kills it on every track. It is impossible to not feel some kind of way while listening to “Venice Bitch,” or really any song on this album for that matter. Whether it’s the strength of her voice as both an artist, or the strength of her voice as a singer, something about these songs has the power to place you directly in Lana’s viewpoint. This allows you to experience the emotions, feelings, and experiences Lana has with more clarity than any other piece of media I have ever engaged with. I first listened to this album while stranded on a bus after waiting for six hours following an accident. The record was so transformative that it immediately pulled me from the annoyance and triviality of my own situation into the real, expensive, and complex problems that Lana Del Rey grapples with in her life. Norman Fucking Rockwell is a masterpiece of empathy as much as it is of singer-songwriting. I can only hope my experience with this album continues to evolve in the way it has in the short time since its release.\n\n6 | Fiona Apple - The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do (2012)\n\nThe fact that Fiona Apple takes the title of this flawless work from her own poetry is abjectly unsurprising given the composition of the album. The Idler Wheel... is prosaic and poetic at its core and all the way through its existence; Apple is a master of the subconscious blend of poetry and music, and it is the most apparent on this album. A product of 13 years of work, this album is the strongest narrative musical work this decade by a solid margin. This album contains better poetic content than most poetry collections and better narrative content than most novels. Fiona Apple is the single most magnanimous singer-songwriter on the face of the Earth, and this album is her reintroduction to a new generation with her most heartbreaking work yet.\n\nFiona Apple captures the feeling of disconnectedness and loneliness caused by depression and general ennui better than any other artist I can think of. She is blazingly aware of her own faults and beats herself up for them more than she beats up others for theirs. This consistent dejectedness and loneliness that she espouses makes you long to only see good things for her and her life. The lyric “How could I ask anyone to love me, when all I do is ask to be left alone” is easily one of my favorites of the decade, and it isn't even the best lyrical selection from the album. Even past the lyrical and thematic content, this album *sounds* great too. She is able to incorporate percussion and strings with more versatility and vivaciousness than I have ever seen. Fiona Apple is an indispensable voice.\n\n5 | Car Seat Headrest - Twin Fantasy (2018)\n\nTwin Fantasy is the best rock and roll album of the decade. Even if you were to remove the stunning, beautiful, and poignant content of this album’s thematic motifs and lyrical content, you still have a band that has completely set themselves apart from other rock acts thanks to their ingenious evolution of the rock and roll sound for a new generation. Much like Phil Spector’s Wall Of Sound revolution, Car Seat Headrest have made rock a 21st-century genre through the sheer widening and complication of sound. Songs on Twin Fantasy are never repetitive or tiring in the slightest even though the record clocks in at an hour and a half long. If anything, the album feels short given the scope of its sonic achievement, masterful guitar work, stellar production, and far-reaching lyricism.\n\nAt its core, Twin Fantasy is a love story and statement on queer existence in this new generation. The record weaves the tale of a dying relationship made and developed through the internet with dazzling sound design and lyrical excellence. It highlights the contradictions that things like technology, being queer, distance, family, and emotionality can have on love and the emotional fallout that happens when these things seem to conspire against you. I can’t describe how relevant Twin Fantasy was for me personally in the coming out process. This album’s lyrical content, subdued humor, and the resignation of Will Toledo were some of the first things that truly helped me understand my own queerness, and I know I am far from alone in this. This is a special once in a generation sort of album.\n\n4 | Beyoncé - Lemonade (2016)\n\nBeyoncé’s immaculate Lemonade represents the ultimate triumph of the concept album as a valid media organization. Never before and never again will there be a better effort to capture one’s own pain, sense of loss and abandonment, and anger at unfaithfulness than there has been here. Although many among us can relate to the fierceness of the lyrics, the intensity of her sentiment, and the graceful nature of her forgiveness, it is impossible to say any of us have truly felt Beyoncé’s pain. The overarching motif Lemonade is that relationships, no matter how public, are inherently personal; therefore, the reactions and emotions caused by their twists and turns are entirely personal. Nobody can understand exactly what it is like to be you, and thus nobody can really ever 100% feel how Beyoncé felt during the construction of this album. However, one of the many reasons this record is flawless is because so many people relate to it so personally. Beyoncé managed to construct an album that is both wholly personal and universally relatable. What began as an entirely subjective experience has transformed into an objective battle cry for womanhood and black identity in America, and this is an altogether unique artistic occurrence.\n\nLemonade brings in talent from all genres and musical heritages. Beyoncé is able to create classic White Stripes era riffs with Jack White with the same ease as she manages to deliver a fantastic Kendrick Lamar set piece. So many people contributed small parts of themselves and their own pain into the creation of this record, and Beyoncé immaculately fused it together under the hood of her own experience. This album is starkly beautiful sounding, and it feels amiss to not mention the production given how insanely consistent it is from the front to the back of the record. This album is truly something special.\n\n3 | Playboi Carti - Die Lit (2018)\n\nDie Lit is trap’s best album and an absolute tour de force of cloud trap. Playboi Carti carried the momentum of his self-titled work more successfully than anyone could have imagined, forming a machiavellian treatise on life, a penning love letter to Atlanta trap, and completely revamping an entire genre in the process. Die Lit is massive, sprawling, and expansive in both its sound and ideas. Pierre Bourne has emerged as a new saint in the pantheon of all-time producers, bringing his completely fresh and insane sound to a genre already filled with dozens of other visionaries waiting to help develop it. Carti’s flow rests somewhere between that of a goblin and a pop singer, a tense sort of duality that slaps hard and remains unchallenged in the rap game today. It is absolutely unprecedented how an album with this many tracks manages to deliver essential songs at such a high ratio; consistency is one of this album’s biggest selling points. Carti continues to be a visionary both musically and culturally, and it has become increasingly evident that he is in the middle of constructing a new vision of punk trap while also on one of the best album runs of all time.\n\nDie Lit is cool, sleek, and long-lasting, but above all, it manages to be pervasively fun. This album is one of the most joyous and pleasant listens of the decade, a work of absolute eternal happiness and aesthetic jubilation. It is impossible to overstate how much this album means to me and how much I have listened to it. The spirit of this album remains undefeated despite injustice and pain, Carti holds an indomitable spirit that he successfully projects out into the world.\n\n2 | Kanye West - Yeezus (2013)\n\nIt is absolutely impossible to overstate the impact of Yeezus as a record; from its lasting and entrenched influence on the future of rap and hip-hop production to the emotional wrath and disquiet it immediately released in the souls of the music fans who had years to reckon with it. From the hundreds of artists who have taken pieces of this record into their own to the monumental meaning it has to artistry as a whole, the shadow of Yeezus looms large over the music industry even today. This album will continue to be regarded as one of the decade’s most classic and influential works, and it is without question that this analysis is deserved. Yeezus operates on the same thematic and aesthetic wavelength as The Great Gatsby; it is an album about the depravities of wealth and success, and the failure to understand oneself as a human in the light of drug abuse and moral depravity. This is all a byproduct caused by a predatory culture that feeds upon those human relations that offer the only hope of escape from this bleak and wretched world. These messages are packed into a compact 40-minutes where no two songs sound alike. “Black Skinhead” is one of the best rock songs of the decade, “Bound 2” is a completely unrivaled love song, and “Send It Up” is a drill-infused genre-bending masterwork. Every song on this album accomplishes a different goal but works toward the same end, all coming together to form one of art’s mightiest achievements.\n\n1 | Lorde - Pure Heroine (2013)\n\nPure Heroine captures the essence of pure, unadulterated young love, more brilliantly and perfectly than any other album has ever even come close to. Pure Heroine is a victory for the pop genre and an undisputed top 2 or 3 pop album of all-time. Such isolated works of transformative genius, works that contribute to a completely different and compelling direction for a genre as varied and diverse as pop, are once in a lifetime opuses. The fact that Lorde managed to compose such a work on her DEBUT album at the age of 16 is unequivocal proof of her genius. I can’t even remember what I was up to at 16 besides gaming. This album would feel like an anomalous showing if Lorde has not also released another one of the best albums of the decade. And really, how anomalous can this perfect of an album be? The talents of Lorde and her truest, completely ungarnished inner-self are present in every pore of this album.\n\nPure Heroine is an album about love; love that shockingly persists in spite of the wasteland of suburbaness and apathy which has long been at war with the psyche of the youth. It feels wrong to even discern between analyses of songs on this album given how flawless every minute of this record is and how the miraculous whole speaks for itself better than any particular partition of the music. This album is a work of sublime thematic genius, an absolutely infallible artistic achievement completely lacking a single bad moment, error, or lapse in thematic judgment. “Royals” is one of the best hit songs of the decade, and “Team” is even better; there’s no part of this album that doesn’t completely break the mold. It is impossible, once introduced, to stop thinking about the stark utopia of suburban love that Lorde has generated on this album. Pure Heroine is, quite simply, one of the best albums of all time."
