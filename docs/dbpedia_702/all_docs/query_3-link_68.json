        "text": "Post by jlbass on\n\nTry WMGA in Huntington West Virginia as RHN posted in another topic on this message board. The show broadcasts from 11am-3pm central time (12 noon-4pm eastern) on Sunday.\n\nWMMX has continued to broadcast the Flashback series that Premiere sponsored from 2000-2002. Unlike \"AT40: The 80s\", \"Flashback carried only the last 3 hours of the original AT40 show (I have copies of Flashback if you want to hear them), beginning around #30 or so. I checked the WMMX website and they never mention AT40, Casey Kasem or Flashback, only something called \"Timewarp Weekend\". However I can confirm that the show is broadcast at 6am or 7am (central time) on Saturday mornings.\n\nUnlike WMMX, WMGA announces the beginning of AT40: The 80s on Apr 8, 2007 and they have \"Listen Live\" which means the show can be heard (hopefully) via Internet.\n\nPost by MEF on\n\nWMMX did air American Top 40 the 80s on 4/7/07. The station did air the 3/5/83 AT40 show, instead of an old AT40 Flashback rerun. I only heard the last hour from 9 to 10 am. I'm not sure if WMMX is airing the whole 4 hours or not. However, WMMX messed up the ending. The person who downloads the show into the WMMX computer was not paying attention. On the old AT40 Flashback show, there were only 4 segments, the last 2 were promos in hour #3. However, on AT40 the 80s, there are 5 segments in hour #3. Segment 4 is the optional segment with Ed McMann voiceover. The programer did not download the 5th segment in hour 3.\n\nThus, on WMMX, segment 3 and segment 4 with the optional segment with Ed McMann aired. However, segment 5 did not air. Thus #2 and #1 were cut off.\n\nWFCX had promos on during American Top 40 the 70s, with Casey saying American Top 40 the 80s will be airing on the FOX (WFCX) on Sundays. However, Casey does not give you the time on Sundays. The website says watch for news for American Top 40 the 80s coming soon. As soon if AT40 the 80s does air on WFCX, I will let everyone know.\n\nPost by nenad on\n\nmef said:\n\nWFCX had promos on during American Top 40 the 70s, with Casey saying American Top 40 the 80s will be airing on the FOX (WFCX) on Sundays.

Thanks!\n\nI have updated my website with all the known stations and schedules airing classic AT40's:\n\nradio.nenad.net/radio1.htm"
