        "text": "The ’70s were quite the decade for John Denver: hit after hit, millions of albums and singles sold, TV specials and guest appearances, movies, extended tours, etc…etc…\n\nThe man was extremely busy for 10 straight years, so it was only natural that when the ’80s came around, he lightened his schedule and turned his attention to several special projects and humanitarian pursuits, many involving natural resource and environmental conservation.\n\nJohn still toured a bit and released a few albums and singles here and there, but his main focus was elsewhere.\n\nThat said, his last big hit was released in 1982: the simple, yet beautiful “Shanghai Breezes.”\n\nJohn was visiting Shanghai and was starting to feel homesick, when he realized that the sun, moon, stars, and even the breezes were the same no matter where he was at the time.\n\nThat simple thought gave birth to a song that went to #1 on the Adult Contemporary Charts in both the US and Canada.\n\nIt was John’s last #1 song…and also the last to appear in the Top 40 (at #31).\n\nNOTE: In case you’ve ever wondered, the flute solos were performed by Jim Horn, a member of the legendary group of studio musicians called “The Wrecking Crew.” During his long career, Jim has played woodwinds for everyone from The Beatles and Beach Boys…to The Rolling Stones, The Carpenters., and Tom Petty–just to name a small handful.\n\n“Shanghai Breezes” by John Denver: one last Great Song from a legendary performer.\n\nFor the stories behind more than 1,700 Great Songs of the ’70s and ’80s, visti my Facbeook page at https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCuuuk/\n\nBack in the day, there was absolutely was no critical middle ground on this week’s featured song.\n\nCashbox Magazine said it was “bursting with fine melodies and interesting musical changes…but 0n the other hand, Rolling Stone called it “the worst piece of light music Paul McCartney has ever done.”\n\n1971’s Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey (from the album “Ram”) was a #1 hit in the US, Canada, and New Zealand, reached #3 in Mexico and #5 in Australia. It became Paul’s first gold record after the Beatles broke up, selling well over a million copies.\n\nIn addition, it won the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists–an award usually given to choral or classical pieces.\n\nSo obviously, a lot of people loved it, regardless of what Rolling Stone had to say,\n\nThe song itself was stitched together from bits and pieces of songs Paul had been working on, and ended up being an interesting cross between an apology to Paul’s favorite uncle, Albert Kendall, for the apparent laziness of the current generation…and a slam on America’s Admiral William “Bull” Halsey, who was known for being stubborn and authoritative.(hence the “Bull” nickname).\n\nIt also features what were probably Linda McCartney’s best vocals.\n\nTaken as a whole, “Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey by Paul & Linda McCartney is at the very least… interesting…And at best, a “Great Song of 1971!”\n\nFor the stories behind more than 1,700 Great Songs of the ’70s and ’80s, visit my Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCuuuk/\n\nIf you’ve been following this blog for any given length of time, you’ve probably noticed that I often include Canadian chart statistics. There are 2 reasons for this:\n\n#1: It’s no secret that many Canadian groups and artists have crossed over the border to influence American musical tastes…and vice versa.\n\n#2: I grew up near the Canadian border, and it certainly influenced MY musical tastes! 🙂\n\nOn any given song, the chart numbers between countries could virtually be identical, or wildly different. And Then there are songs that don’t cross the border at all–and that can ALSO go both ways!\n\nI bring this up because this week’s featured Great Song of the ’80s , is a rarity: a Great Canadian Song that took 6 YEARS to cross the border and become a Great Song here in the US!\n\nIn 1983, Arnold Lanni, keyboardist for the Canadian group Sherriff, fell in love with Valeri Brown and wrote her a song for Valentine’s Day. They married 2 years later, but before that happened, Sheriff recorded and released “When I’m With You.”\n\nThe song went to #8 on Canada’s Top 40, but stalled at #61 in the US.\n\nNow You’d think that would be the end of it…and it almost WAS, especially after Sheriff turned in their badges and broke up in 1985.\n\nBut then, in November of 1988, KDWB in Minneapolis and WKTI in Milwaukee started playing the song…and by early 1989, other stations in the Midwest…and then the rest of the country… had started playing it as well, which led Capitol Records to re-issue the single.\n\nThis time, “When I’m With You” went to #1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary Charts in the US …but failed to chart at all in Canada!\n\nMany people thought Sheriff should reunite and go out on tour to back the song, but the ex-band members refused, and that was that.\n\nSo in the end, Sheriff became a one-hit wonder TWICE…with”When I’m with You:” a Great Song of 1983 up North…and 1989 here in the States.\n\nFor the stories behind more than 1,700 Great Songs of the ’70s and ’80s, visit my Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCuuuk/\n\nOne day in 1969, John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival was reading a newspaper when he saw an ad for the Walt Disney’ short film, “Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day.”\n\nIn a bit of mind bending, he thought to himself: “Wouldn’t Winnie & The Pooh Boys” be a fun name for a fictional jug band? Or better yet, how about “Willie and the Poor Boys?”\n\nAnd, believe it or not, that’s how John came up with the name of CCR’s fourth album.\n\nOn top of that, it gave him the idea for the title cut, and one of the group’s best songs: “Down on the Corner,” featuring the lyrics: “Down on the Corner, out in the street, Willie and the Poor Boys are playin,’ bring a nickel, tap your feet.”\n\nThe album and single were released in October of 1969, and when 1970 arrived, the single reached #3 on Billboard’s Hot 100. It was also a Top 10 hit in Canada and several European countries.\n\nTRIVIA #1: In case you’ve ever wondered, the “Kalamazoo” mentioned in the lyrics was an inexpensive Gibson guitar made in Kalamazoo, Michigan during the mid 20th Century.\n\nTRIVIA #2: The lyric, “Doubles on kazoo” was often misheard as “Devil’s on the loose,” which John not only thought was funny, but a good lyric to use in yet another CCR song: “Run Through the Jungle.” But that’s a story for another day. 🙂\n\n“Down on the Corner” the Great Song that kick started the ’70s for Creedence Clearwater Revival… thanks to Winnie the Pooh!\n\nFor the stories behind more than 1,700 Great Songs of the ’70s & ’80s, visit my Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCuuuk/\n\nLet’s start July with a bang.\n\nMonday: The writer was inspired by fans of Elvis on the anniversary of his death. Black Velvet by Alannah Myles (youtube.com)\n\nTuesday: This was sandwiched between the iconic #1’s Don’t Worry, Be Happy and Red, Red Wine.

They separated in 2010. The Beatles – All You Need Is Love (Official Music Video) (youtube.com)\n\nHave a safe, fun weekend!\n\nn the mid-80s, a lack of good material mixed with a serious drug problem put Eddie Money’s career on the skids. His record label, Columbia, was about ready to drop him, but, because he was cleaning himself up, they decided to give him one last chance–but only if he allowed them to choose his material. Eddie really had no choice but to agree.\n\nOne of the songs Columbia wanted him to record, was “Take Me Home Tonight.” Eddie didn’t think it had much hit potential, but he was intrigued by the part of the song that sampled “Be Me Baby,” the 1963 classic by the Ronettes–sung by Ronnie Spector (who, back in the day, was married to production genius–and future convicted murderer–Phil Spector).\n\nEddie thought it would be a good idea to have Ronnie record the part herself, but when he was told by Columbia that she wasn’t available…he asked his friend Martha Davis of the The Motels to sing it.\n\nMartha declined and told Eddie he should call Ronnie himself and not take “No” for an answer.\n\nSo Eddie called Ronnie and caught her in the middle of washing dishes. Ronnie told him she’d retired because she was tired of all the drama stardom had brought her way. Basically, she was happy to be living a quiet life out of the spotlight.\n\nBut Eddie had a comeback ready: “But Ronnie, the whole song is a tribute to you!”\n\nThat did the trick!\n\nThe song was recorded and released as a single from Eddie’s “last chance” album, “Can’t Hold Back.” And people LOVED IT!\n\n“Take Me Home Tonight” topped Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Chart, and reached #4 on the Hot 100! It later garnered a Grammy nomination for “Best male Rock Performance.” (Perhaps it should have been for “Best Duo,” but that’s just my personal opinion.)\n\nEddie Money was back…and so was Ronnie Spector, who then came out of retirement and resumed her singing career.\n\n“Take me Home Tonight:” A double comeback for Eddie and Ronnie, and a Great Song of 1986!\n\nDid you know that Jim Croce used to work in radio sales?\n\nNeither did I. But according to his widow, Ingrid, after Jim graduated from college–the first in his family ever to do so– his parents wanted him to work at a “real 9 to 5 job.” Plus Ingrid was still in college trying to finish up her degree and the couple needed a stable income..\n\nSo Jim did the responsible thing. He put off his music career for awhile and went to work selling radio airtime on the South side of Philadelphia.\n\nThere were a lot of pool halls in the area, and Jim would call on them looking for a “buy.”\n\nAfter a while, he started hanging out just to watch the pool sharks in action and met a local artist named Melvin Goldfield, who told Jim all sorts of stories about the underbelly of South Philly.\n\nAnd then he met local legend and “pool shootin’ son of a gun” Big Jim Walker–and the seeds of a “Great Song” were planted.\n\nA few years went by, bringing a number of life changes–too many to list here. (Honestly, his short life was filled with ups, downs, moves and career changes–but most of all, music.)\n\nBy 1972, Jim had left the radio business and had been kicking around the music scene for awhile with little success…but FINALLY ABC/Dunhill Records signed him to a recording contract, and before long, his debut album was ready to go.\n\nFor his first single, the record company chose a song that had been percolating in Jim’s mind since those days in South Philly: “You Don’t Mess Around with Jim.”\n\n(Note: Croce moved the location of the pool hall in the song from South Philadelphia to New York City–probably to protect the guilty.)\n\nThe song was an immediate hit, reaching #8 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and #9 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. In Canada, it peaked at #4 on their Top 40.\n\nSo, in effect, thanks to radio (and his incredible talent), the former radio salesperson scored a “Great Song of 1972.”\n\nAnd Great Songs” by Jim Croce kept coming until (and even beyond) his untimely death in a 1983 plane crash at the age of 30. It’s sad to think about, even today, 51 years later.\n\n“You Don’t Mess Around with Jim” by Jim Croce: a Great Song of 1972."
