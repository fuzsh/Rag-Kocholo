        "text": "Electropop is a genre of music that combines electronic music with pop sensibilities. It often features catchy melodies, upbeat rhythms, and synthesizer-heavy instrumentation. Electropop emerged in the late 1970s and has since evolved to encompass a wide range of styles, from the indie-influenced sound of artists like Lorde and CHVRCHES to the more mainstream pop sound of acts like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry."
