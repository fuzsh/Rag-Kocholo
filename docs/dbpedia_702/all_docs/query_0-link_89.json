        "text": "David Nerattini\n\nPlease welcome Mr. Claudio Simonetti. So you have to understand that, for us, Mr. Simonetti and the music he has done through the years â especially for us kids in their thirties â means horror music. We all grew up scared to death by some of the songs he composed. You may know some of the movies he made soundtracks for, [with] Dario Argento, the horror director â Suspiria, Deep Red, Phenomena, and even George Romero, Dawn of the Dead. Then in the â80s he was a main figure in Italo disco, responsible for the Capricorn band, which wasnât really a band but was Simonetti himself in his home studio. But weâll talk about all this later on. So, you were born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nYes, I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, because my father worked there for 15 years, and I stayed there for 12. I have a lot of feeling for Brazilian music because I lived there for the first part of my life. For everybody, the first ten years are very important for your whole life. I have a mix between Brazilian culture and Italian because, of course, I am Italian. My father Enrico Simonetti was a very famous musician in Italy and also a TV entertainer, so I was lucky because I was born into a musical family. I started playing and studying piano when I was eight, in Brazil. But actually I didnât like it very much, because I was very young and to study music is very hard, itâs very boring. I didnât feel like playing for hours and hours. But after two or three years, at the end of the â60s, the era of pop music was arriving â The Beatles and Rolling Stones, then later Genesis and King Crimson, thatâs my culture. I really enjoyed studying again, to study piano.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nSo you studied at Santa Cecilia?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nI studied composition and piano here in Rome, at Accademia di Santa Cecilia, but at the same time I played with rock bands in garages. It helped me learn how to use my classical background and put it in rock, because progressive rock and classical at the time was very similar. Most of the rock bands were coming from classical music â Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Yes, even Deep Purple. They have one album live with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. So that's my background.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nYou formed your first band in â72, I guess?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nMy first band was called Ritratto Di Dorian Gray [Portrait Of Dorian Gray], because Iâm a fan of Oscar Wilde. That was one of my favorite books.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nThere was a time in the early â70s when we had so-called Italian pop, but it was really progressive rock, similar but quite different to what was coming out from the rest of Europe.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nWe had some famous groups like PFM and Banco. Goblin came a little later.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nSo at the time you formed a band with your buddy Walter Martino, the son of another famous singer?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nWe were a band of second generations! We lived in London in 1974. After Ritratto Di Dorian Gray we formed a new band with Massimo Morante. I was doing military service at the time, in 1972. In this period we were writing songs in the studio for one year, and then we formed the early Goblin band, but under the name Oliver.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nLike Oliver Twist?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nYes. Then we lived in London for almost one year in 1974, we recorded a lot of demos and played a lot of concerts in England. Then we returned to Italy and had a contract with Cinevox Records, and they were the publishers of Dario Argentoâs films. This was 1974, he was a very famous director at that time, heâd made some films like The Bird With The Crystal Plumage. He was searching for a rock band to play in the film because he was a fan of rock. Heâd contacted Deep Purple for the The Cat OâNine Tails but they didnât agree to do it, so out of necessity our producer lent him our music. And Dario Argento liked it so much, he decided to choose us for Profondo Rosso. We were only just in our twenties, we were very young. He was very brave because he was a very big director, so it was unusual to go with a young band. But he made a good decision because the album Profundo Rosso sold more than three million copies.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nThis is the music that scared the kids quite a lot. Itâs synonymous with horror.\n\n(music: Enrico Simonetti â âDrugâs Themeâ from Gamma)\n\nThe church organ in the song was a real church organ, because we didnât have plugins or electronic keyboards, so every time we needed an organ we went to the church. It had 15,000 pipes â very big. For every instrument, you had to play the real one â no samplers, nothing. I think itâs a little better, more creative, because you have to construct your sound by yourself, not using just what you can find easily now. Especially for Suspiria, we did a lot of research. This was 1975. I used the Hammond B-3, the Hohner Clavinet and the Minimoog. Thatâs it, no more keyboards. The Moog was the first big synthesizer in the history of keyboards. There were no computers, no MIDI. The first MIDI keyboard I had was a Yamaha DX-7 in the early â80s. The first time I saw a MIDI keyboard I said, âWhy do you need to play two keyboards with the same one?â And that was the beginning of the next stage of technology, now we canât live without it.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nThe success of Profondo Rosso immediately made you a major player in the world of soundtracks.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nWith Goblin we played together for about three years or more. We did just two films with Dario [as Goblin], the others were with different members. We split in 1978 after Dawn Of The Dead. This was our last soundtrack, with George Romero.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nSuspiria was next, and this is the most famous Dario Argento movie outside of Italy.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nSuspiria in Japan was so famous that Deep Red was known as Suspiria Part 2, even though theyâre two completely different stories with different characters. Suspiria was very interesting because we worked for three months in the studio, using a lot of strange instruments like the Greek bouzouki, the Indian tabla and the Mellotron, a keyboard that uses pre-recorded tapes. It was an English keyboard you can hear in groups like Gentle Giant, Yes, King Crimson. Even The Beatlesâ âStrawberry Fields Foreverâ is the flute from the Mellotron. There is a very exceptional plugin that does it. The Mellotron uses tapes â every time you touch a key it plays this tape inside with a motor. You can play for eight seconds, no more, then at the end it starts again. To get the length of the sound, in the studio we started recording, then in the middle it starts again, so we get 15 seconds.\n\nIn Suspiria, it was Dario Argentoâs first film about witches. He asked us to write the music so the audience always feels like the witches are there, even if theyâre not on the screen. But the music should be... not scary, but always feeling like the witches are around them. I think Suspiria is Goblin's masterpiece.\n\n(music: Easy Going - âFearâ)\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nThis was â79, so the first synthesizers were coming out. How was the transition from the Hammond organ, the analog thing, to a straight synthesizer sound?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nI always liked technology. I bought my first Minimoog in 1972, so I had lots of synthesizers from the start. Iâm very upset because Iâve sold many of them, but Iâd like to have them again. I have a few vintage keyboards, I have the original Mellotron and the Minimoog, a Roland System 100, the first synthesizer with wheels. I have the Arp 2600 and PPG Wave 2.3. I have some of them. But now I try to keep all the keyboards I have, maybe in the next 20 years they will be appreciated more than now.\n\nSo I always like working with electronics. Even with Goblin, our last album wasnât a soundtrack, it was Il Fantastico Viaggio del Bagarozzo Mark, mixing rock and electronics. I had Roland synthesizers and the sequencers. So the passage through genres wasnât difficult because I always had the technology. In â82 I did Tenebrae, with two members of Goblin, because we couldnât use the Goblin name. For the first time Goblin â even though it was a different name, it was three-quarters of Goblin â used electronic drums. We used a Linn 9000, the first famous drum machine because it was the first to have a sampler inside and a MIDI sequencer. It was a big machine, very heavy.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nLike the granddaddy of the Akai MPC60 that came like eight years later?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nAll the â80s sounds were made on the Linn 2000 and 9000. We recorded the soundtrack of Tenebrae mixing electronics and rock, and we used a vocoder.\n\nAnyhow, now I have a new band called Daemonia. We play new arrangements of old Dario Argento stuff. We recorded it two years ago live with a big symphonic orchestra in Sienna, Tuscany. We did a remix of all the most famous Dario Argento soundtracks, not just mine but also Ennio Morriconeâs, Keith Emersonâs, plus two of my favourite songs, which are [the theme from] Halloween by John Carpenter â who says he was inspired by Deep Red â which we mix with âTubular Bellsâ from The Exorcist, by Mike Oldfield.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nWhat were your influences when it came to composing soundtracks?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nWe started just playing our music, we werenât influenced by anyone. Goblin has its own style and many composers imitated us. For instance, John Carpenter made Halloween in 1979 and we made Profondo Rosso four years earlier. But he says he was inspired by our music. I like a lot of American musicians but we had our own style. Of course we were influenced by rock bands of the â70s, like Genesis, but I think with Suspiria we found our own style.\n\n(music: Simonetti, Pignatelli & Morante â Unknown music from Tenebrae score)\n\nIn Italy in December there will be a special DVD box set of Dawn Of The Dead by George Romero. It will include a documentary and interview with George Romero, audio commentary, the Italian version in 5.1 sound with restored negatives. And there will be a fifth disc, a CD with the entire score completely re-played by me and Daemonia. The same Goblin soundtrack but remade by us.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nYou never use your own name in your records. You used it just a couple of times, one of which was âI Love The Piano,â which did well in the States and was released by Salsoul. How did that happen?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nThere are two versions, one is by Kasso and one is my version, which was the main track for an important TV show in Italy. One of the main writers of Italian television had their 30th birthday and we had a big show and I wrote it with the orchestra and the piano. They liked it also in the States, Salsoul is a big disco label.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nIn the late â80s you started to look back.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nI went back to making movies, and in 1984 I started making soundtracks for Argento. In 1984, Phenomena, then 1985, Demoni, then Opera. I started working again with Dario, not with Goblin but just by myself. And I started doing music for Italian TV shows. Later in the â90s I started again with my rock band, not rock & roll but gothic, progressive rock. And after that I made two albums, Simonetti Horror Project I & II, I donât have them here. Then I started playing with bands again. And in 1999 I formed Daemonia because I wanted to be on the road again, like in the â70s when I was doing Goblin. So we started doing the Goblin stuff in our style, re-arranging it, but now weâre doing our third album with completely new songs.\n\nWe play as Daemonia in many places â we did two concerts in America, we play in France and in Japan, where we had a live album, Live In Japan. Because Dario is very famous and Goblin didnât exist, we had a small reunion in 2000 for Sleepless, not the last, but one of them. Thatâs the last film of Darioâs I made a soundtrack for. It was released this year in January and on this album itâs completely electronic, everything, because Dario made a film about a serial killer who kills by internet with a webcam. So Dario told me he wanted the music to be completely electronic, so thatâs what I did. It was very fun because it was a return to the â80s when I was listening to Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream. So we heard a lot of old and contemporary electronic music. I like this album because itâs something different in my career.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nOf the new electronic music coming out in the last five or six years, is there anything you like?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nYes, of course. Aphex Twin, Squarepusherâ¦ [talks in Italian]. Anyway, this is the title track from The Card Player.\n\n(music: Claudio Simonetti â âThe Card Player Themeâ)\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nSo weâve gone from â72 to 2004. Any questions?\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhen I heard Daemonia it reminded me of FantÃ´mas, the band from America with Mike Patton and Dave Lombardo.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nThey do crazy music.\n\nAudience Member\n\nBut on the second album they also do horror scores, and I wanted to ask if you know them? And my real question is, when youâre working with Dario Argento how do you prepare? Do you meet with Dario and see the script or do you see the set where it will be filmed?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nDario always tells me he wants this kind of music, weâll listen to some records and heâll show me. Then after that he leaves me free to do what I like. I was lucky because Dario is a good friend, too, so he listens to my ideas. Of course, if he doesnât like it he says so. For Suspiria I read the script beforehand and we tried to play some songs to use on the set to help the actors. But when you read a script itâs not the same as the finished film, just as when you read a book itâs different to going to the cinema and seeing the film. Everyone has their own impression. We tried to record the music but we didnât use it, because when we saw the film it was completely different to what our thoughts were, so we went and re-recorded the music.\n\nAfter that Iâve always worked this way, watching the film then writing the music. Just for the last one, The Card Player, I started working on the music while he was shooting, because Dario was filming in Rome and I saw the mood and understood immediately what he wanted. So I went into the studio and started writing the music and then later I let him listen to it to see if he liked it. But this is unusual. Normally I still work on the music later.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWeâve heard some tracks from the beginnings of Italian disco and they were nice tracks. But when you say Italian disco to people they think itâs really awful, a rude word for some very bad music. Why do you think it got such a bad reputation?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nNow in a disco, I hear the new songs, they use the same arrangements we used in the â70s, for example Alcazar, and bands like that, they use a disco sound. I think Italian dance music was greatly appreciated. Even now weâre some of the main producers of dance music in the world. [Talks in Italian] Because we had so many good productions of Italian producers recording with American singers, American players, most of them are very famous but no one knows it was Italian productions. Like I said before, itâs like spaghetti westerns.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIn the â80s there was lots of really crap music called Italo disco. but it sounded completely different from what you were making.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nOf course, you get much ugly music. Itâs like every country, thereâs good music and bad music. We have groups like Eiffel 65, they sold 12 million copies all over the world. They're from Torino.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhat do you think of Giorgio Moroder and has he influenced you in any way?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nGiorgio Moroder is the master of Italian dance. He made one of Donna Summerâs best songs, âI Feel Love.â Heâs Italian, but heâs from northern Italy so heâs almost German, so he recorded his records in Munich.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI was under the impression he was German.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nNo, he was Italian and he was a real genius. He also won two or three Oscars for soundtracks. He wrote Top Gun and another soundtrackâ¦ [talks Italian] Midnight Express. I donât know what happened to him, he disappeared, maybe too much money, he doesnât need to write any more music. But he was the first very well-known Italian dance producer in the world, but he started in Germany.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI asked because his music influenced me, just in its danceability and also its complexity.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWho was Vivien Vee? Where did you meet her, was she American?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nI met her the first time when she was an Italian-American model in Rome, she was a very good singer, too. And with Giancarolo Meo, we decided to produce her. So I wrote the songs for the album, but when we went to the studio sheâd disappeared, because she was doing some modelling somewhere. Sheâd taken the plane and disappeared, we didnât know what happened to her. We had booked the studio, so Giancarlo [asked] his girlfriend, she was 18 years old, very nice. And she said, âI can sing,â because she liked singing. I did two demos with her in my studio, and then afterwards we recorded Vivien Vee. The funny thing is, she didnât know any English, sheâd never studied English before, she didnât know any words of English. She had to be helped in the studio with an American girl, and we taught her how to sing. And it was fun because she had very big success in the States and when we went there in 1979, â80, I was with her for TV shows and everyone wanted her autograph and I had to say, âNo, no no,â because she didnât speak English. We didnât want to let people know she was Italian, they thought she was American. We built an untouchable singer, no one can speak to her [laughs] because, of course, she canât speak at all. And then she became very popular on TV in Italy because she worked with Pippo Baudo, then the most famous television host. She was on TV for a few years and then she married and finished her singing career.\n\nAudience Member\n\nSome of the effects you used to record her voice were brilliant.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nThe accent is strange, but it works.\n\nAudience member\n\nI wanted to ask you about âFearâ because it reminds me of Michael Jacksonâs âBeat Itâ but it was two or three years before. Did you have any problems with the fact that he took your melody?\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nYou could have sued!\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nDo you have Michael Jacksonâs phone number? [Joking] No, I never knew this.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nHeâs a bit of a tease.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nMany of his songs, for example âBadâ â itâs the melody of Ghostbusters, itâs the same. [Talks in Italian]\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nFamously in Italy there was a trial between Michael Jackson and Al Bano, a popular folk singer. There is an Al Bano song that is exactly the same as âWill You Be Thereâ by Michael Jackson. He sued Michael Jackson but then they discovered they both copied another track.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nThe judge declared they had both copied from another one. One of the most famous cases in the world was âMy Sweet Lordâ by George Harrison.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nItâs the same song as âSheâs So Fineâ by The Chiffons, a vocal group from the â60s.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nBut anyway, of course when you write songs it could happen that you copy something, but you donât mind, it can happen. After, when you finish, you realise this is a copy of someone.\n\nAudience member\n\nWhatâs your favorite horror movie?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nThere are many. My favoriteâ¦ let me think. Of course I like Hitchcock, Psycho â itâs not a horror movie but itâs one of my favorites. Also Brian de Palma, John Carpenter, of course Argento. When I was a kid I always loved horror films, like Hammer Horror â Dracula with Christopher Lee. So I always had a good feeling between me and horror movies. The Exorcist â if you see it now you may laugh, but at the time it was a very scary film.\n\nAudience member\n\nWhatâs your favorite soundtrack?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nMaybe Psycho by Bernard Herrmann is one of the best. But I like Jerry Goldsmith and John Williams.\n\nAudience member\n\nWhat about soundtrack made as compilations?\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nActually I don't like soundtracks made of compilations of many songs. If I want to go buy the soundtrack of Spiderman itâs very hard to find the original soundtrack, you find just the compilation of rock bands that you hear in the film for a few seconds. This is a commercial to sell soundtracks. I like some films where bands wrote music especially for the film. [Talks in Italian] Pink Floyd wrote some very good music for Antonioni. I like, for example, Evanescence, I donât know if they wrote music for a movie but they are one of the most interesting new bands â very gothic, even if they are pop music. And Linkin Park and Nickelback â itâs good to hear that in a film, just for the end titles.\n\nDavid Nerattini\n\nYou said tomorrow youâre playing in Bolzano.\n\nClaudio Simonetti\n\nTomorrow Iâll be in Bolzano at the Eurac Auditorium because two years ago I started to composed the music F.W. Murnauâs 1922 silent movie, Nosferatu. [Applause] Thank you! Itâs my favourite film even if itâs very old. I wrote the soundtrack for this film, I presented it in Paris two years ago for the first time, and tomorrow for the first time in Italy I will play live during the screening of the film in Bolzano. Itâs very unusual for me to play one hour and 40 minutes live, itâs nice. I hope to release it on DVD soon. Iâll send you the first copies."
