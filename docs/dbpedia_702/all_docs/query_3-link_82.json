        "text": "By Russ:\n\nThe career of this singer/songwriter/keyboard craftsman spanned many genres including Soul, Soft Rock, Pop, Adult Contemporary and Country; and several of his blockbuster hits dominated the charts for record-breaking duration.\n\nMost notable songs included 1977’s “I Go Crazy“, a #7 pop hit which once held the record for the longest chart run on the Billboard Hot 100. Then in 1982 “‘65 Love Affair“, which at #6 was his highest-charting single.\n\nTragically, Paul died of a heart attack the day after his 60th birthday.\n\nPaul Lavon Davis\n\n(April 21, 1948 – April 22, 2008)\n\nWhat People Say\n\nThis man’s ego (if he had one) truly resided in his ability to write beautiful music. I read that he was shy and didn’t like performing and was more of a “home-body”, hence his short performance career as he didn’t like being on the road. I also read he had an autistic son, Jonathan, from his marriage (he was divorced) and that he was very devoted to him. This is another fine human being I wish I could have known.\n\nVIDEOS\n\n1977 / I Go Crazy /\n\n.\n\n1980 / Do Right /\n\n.\n\n1981 / Cool Night /\n\n.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Davis had two #1 Country Music hits as a guest vocalist on songs by Marie Osmond and Tanya Tucker.\n\n.\n\nYou’re Still New To Me / with Marie Osmond /\n\n.\n\nI Won’t Take Less Than Your Love / with Tanya Tucker and Paul Overstreet\n\n.\n\n/ I Don’t Want To Be Just Another Love / with Crystal Gayle\n\n.\n\n1991 / Bop / with Dan Seals / Yep, Paul wrote this one too\n\nSONGS\n\n1970 / A Little Bit Of Soap /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-a-little-bit-of-soap-1970.mp3\n\n.\n\n1970 / I Just Want To Keep It Together /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-i-just-wanna-keep-it-together.mp3\n\n.\n\n1973 / Ride em Cowboy /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-ride-em-cowboy-1973.mp3\n\n,\n\n1976 / Superstar /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-superstar-1976.mp3\n\n.\n\n1977 / Sweet Life /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-sweet-life-1977.mp3\n\n.\n\n1980 / Just A Little /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-cry-just-a-little.mp3\n\n.\n\n1980 / All The Way /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/all-the-way.mp3\n\n.\n\n1982 / ’65 Love Affair / this is a driveway song… a song you hear on the radio so rarely, then when you get home when it is on, you sit in the driveway listening to it until its done.\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-65-love-affair.mp3\n\n.\n\n1984 / It Takes Two To Tango /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-it-takes-two-to-tango.mp3\n\n.\n\n1986 / If We Can Get Through The Night /\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paul-davis-if-we-can-get-through-the-night.mp3\n\n.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1968 Davis started off as a songwriter for Malaco Records, based in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1969 Ilene Berns, widow of Bert Berns, signed Davis to the Bang Records label.\n\n1970 / His first album, “A Little Bit of Paul Davis”, was released\n\nIn this album, Paul released a cover version of The Jarmels’ hit “A Little Bit of Soap” and it reached #52 on the Billboard pop chart.\n\n1980 / Paul Davis’ second album was called simply “Paul Davis“\n\nTrack List:\n\nIn 1974, he recorded his third album, Ride ‘Em Cowboy\n\nOn this album, the title track, his first top 40 single, peaked at #23 on January 18, 1975. (The same song became a Top 40 Country hit for Juice Newton in 1984.)\n\nIn 1976 Davis reached #35 in September with “Superstar“, a tribute song not related to any of the 1971 hits by that name.\n\nIn 1977, he released his 5th album Singer of Songs: Teller of Tales\n\nThis album featured his first American Top 10 single with the ballad “I Go Crazy,” which after 30 weeks on the Hot 100 peaked at #7 on March 18, 1978. “I Go Crazy” spent 40 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, which at the time set the record for most weeks on the chart.\n\nTrack #4 was also a major hit for him, Sweet Life – This is a song about a young husband and new father who is thrilled about his station in life, in spite of financial problems and things that didn’t always go as planned. The song was his fourth-highest peaking pop hit, peaking at #17 on the Billboard chart in late 1978. On the Cash Box chart, the song spent three weeks at #15. The song also reached #15 in Canada.\n\nOn May 17, 1980, his gospel-tinged “Do Right” peaked at #23, and American DJ Casey Kasem noted the religious aspects of this song, along with other songs before it, on that day’s edition of American Top 40.\n\n1981 / His album “Paul Davis Cool Night”\n\nDavis signed with Arista Records and scored two more hits, “Cool Night” (which in February 1982 reached #11 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Adult Contemporary chart) and “‘65 Love Affair” (a Top 10 hit on both charts).\n\nHis Arista debut album spawned a third hit with a remake of “Love or Let Me Be Lonely“. The single contained a third verse of music which was not included on the album version, and despite its Top 40 and AC success, had never been reissued on any CD release until Wounded Bird reissued the Best of Paul Davis compilation in 2011.\n\nDavis retired from making records for a time, except for two duets that went to #1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. The first was in 1986 with Marie Osmond singing “You’re Still New to Me“; while the second, in 1988, was a collaboration with Tanya Tucker and Paul Overstreet singing “I Won’t Take Less Than Your Love“.\n\nDavis also wrote “Meet Me in Montana“, which his friend Dan Seals and Osmond took to #1 on the Billboard country chart in 1985. He also wrote “Bop“, a solo #1 country hit for Seals in early 1986.\n\nDavis recorded a duet with Marsha Morgan called “Looking for a Light” which was well received regionally in the southeast.\n\nBefore his death on April 22, 2008 (one day after his 60th birthday), Davis had returned to singing and songwriting by recording two songs, “You Ain’t Sweet Enough” and “Today“. These have not been released.\n\nThrough the years, Davis was heavily influenced by technology. He owned numerous synthesizers and spent a great majority of his spare time at his home composing music that he hoped would be used in future films. Additionally, Davis was very versatile with sampling and using the Synclavier and Fairlight CMI.\n\nMany of his songs, including his best known hits, are owned by Paul McCartney through his MPL Publishing company.\n\nPersonal life\n\nPaul Davis survived a shooting in Nashville, Tennessee on July 29, 1986. He was leaving a hotel on Music Row with a female companion when an unidentified man walked up, demanded his wallet, and shot him in the abdomen.\n\nDavis was an avid golfer, and was also an avid billiards enthusiast. As a member of Music City Amateur Billiard Tour in Nashville, he was competitive in the late 1990s. Additionally, his father was a preacher.\n\nDavis was once married to Pamela Gayle Jay Davis, who enjoyed a brief career with Bang Records/Web IV Music in Atlanta, GA where her husband Paul was writing and recording his songs. When their only son Jonathan was born, Pamela left her job in the music world to dedicate the following 38 years to his care, spending every day seeing to his special needs. Pamela died on March 20, 2017.\n\nDavis died of a heart attack at the Rush Foundation Hospital in Meridian, Mississippi on April 22, 2008, a day after his 60th birthday.\n\npaul’s Keyboard Equipment\n\n1970-1971: Fender Rhodes electric piano, Yamaha grand piano, RMI Electra, Farfisa Organ, Hammond B-3 organ, Moog synthesizer, EMS Synth\n\n1972-1974: Minimoog, ARP 2500, ARP 2600, ARP Odyssey Mark 1, Moog Opus 6, Hammond B-3 organ, Fender Rhodes, Yamaha grand piano, EMS VCS3 Synthi\n\n1975-1976: Minimoog, ARP 2500, ARP 2600, ARP Odyssey Mark 1, Korg MiniPops drum machine, Polymoog, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Solina, EMS VCS3 Synthi\n\n1977-1979: Minimoog, Polymoog, Yamaha CS-80, Korg MiniPops drum machine, EMS VCS3, EMS Vocoder 2000, ARP 2600, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha grand piano, Hammond B-3 organ.
