        "text": "And now the full chart rundown from mid-February - change is in the air!\n\nNew Wave finally fights its way back toward the top of the charts. I was very excited by this development.\n\nAbout 4 months before while I was listening to the radio one afternoon a DJ in Phoenix introduced a song as the new single from Vangelis, and I thought I'd had a stroke. A single. From Vangelis. On Phoenix radio. I couldn't believe it. I dove for the Sears stereo to fire up the cassette deck to record as the intro faded in, because I could already tell from the sound of the thing it was definitely Vangelis, but it didn't seem possible. This guy who I'd been following for the past year or so as a cult act suddenly had a single on US radio? What was happening?\n\nAs the tune unfolded I marveled at how it was pretty much every trick Vangelis knew how to pull condensed into around 3:30. You'd heard bits and pieces of this electronic \"orchestra\" before in his work, but never assembled for something quite this concise and bombastic. And it just kept building as it went - countermelodies, a key change, the kitchen sink. And it was simply gorgeous. I had no idea what the hell Chariots Of Fire was about - rockets? Didn't matter. I knew I had to nab that single.\n\nI figured I should hit the record store and buy it as soon as I found it, because there was no way American radio was gonna play this thing. And then a few weeks later I heard it on Casey Kasem, slowly climbing the charts. Every week I'd listen, assuming it had finally done a plunge off the Top 40 like that Beatles movie medley, but every week it would finally appear a few positions higher on the countdown.\n\nThen I started hearing it a lot on Phoenix radio. First on one or two stations, then across the dial, from light rock to pop. I heard it on AM radio (shudder).\n\nAs it climbed into the Top 10, I started to wonder if the unthinkable was gonna happen - did this thing actually have the momentum to make it all the way to #1? Every week I'd listen, expecting to hear it had dropped on the countdown, and every week it would chart higher. When it made it to #2 at the start of May, behind \"I Love Rock And Roll\", I figured that was it, as it had been on the Hot 100 an astounding 21 weeks by that point. A truly impressive achievement even without topping the charts.\n\nBut the next week it managed even that feat, becoming one of the last instrumental pieces to top the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts after an astounding 22 week run.\n\nThat wall of beige was crumbling.\n\nAnd here we had another example of it.\n\nDecent lite power pop follow-up to \"Physical\" but nothing remarkable.\n\nMore New Wave. Yea!\n\nSleek R&B number from Stevie.\n\nTedious light rock.\n\nMore New Wave hitting the charts. Things had absolutely shifted.\n\nOK, so Stevie borrowed the rhythm from \"Bring On The Night\" by the Police. It worked. Maybe her finest solo hit.\n\nTwo annoying numbers from acts who'd do much better stuff.\n\nDavis was having I think his last big pop hit here, another member of the wall of beige that had dominated the charts the past couple of years, although here even he's going '80s New Wave. I liked Davis a lot more than most of his peers.\n\nSadly kinda forgotten, but I thought this was a decent follow up to their biggest hit.\n\nMore New Wave!\n\nHall & Oates went more New Wave on their follow-up. Kool & the Gang had been one of the few R&B acts to survive the disco apocalypse. Decent hits but not their best work.\n\nTheir chart run was coming to an end here if memory serves, and this thing is disco dated as hell, but I absolutely loved this song. I think had it come out a year or two earlier it would have been a huge hit, but in this crowd it was like a polyester leisure suit. Those days were over.\n\nIt's hilarious to me this thing was a massive hit during this era. Proof positive the charts were in chaos.\n\nIn which two superstars embarrass themselves simultaneously. Big hit but did neither of them any favors.\n\nCountry's all over - at least Willie's hit is great.\n\nI'd forgotten about Meco's \"Pop Goes The Movies\"! There's a blast from the past. Hilarious to see it back-to-back with the Beatles medley. This was the end of the line for disco schlockmeister Meco as well I believe. Meco passed away May 26, 2023 at the age of 83 in Florida.\n\nThe wall of beige brings us...another tee vee theme. Ack!\n\nThis was another sign things were changing on the pop charts. I couldn't get enough of \"Genius Of Love\" or its amazing video.\n\nThe only person who liked it more than me was Mariah Carey.\n\nThis is one of my great music memories of 1982 - it was blasting from the park near my junior high the last day of school later in '82. I hated that place and it felt like the universe was celebrating the end of my sentence to that institution and the start of a free summer. It was off to high school in the fall.\n\nAnother single from the Tattoo You grab bag. Decent, but it's no \"Start Me Up\" or \"Waiting On A Friend\".\n\nAnd here we have it, the single that changed everything. I remember hearing Casey Kasem announcing this the week it appeared on the countdown - my first time hearing it - and Casey telling us how the band said they eschewed electric guitars because they were cliche or played out or whatever and I remembered thinking, \"Hallelujah! Yes!\" because I was sick to death of the same old **** up and down the dial. Bring on the synths, please.\n\nThen a few weeks later I saw the video. Holy cow! This changed everything. And it did. Within weeks the country had been chased off the charts, the wall of beige crumbled to dust and a slew of New Wave hits - many of them from the UK - started invading the US charts. The MTV era had begun. And not a moment too soon.\n\nDecent Ray Parker effort, he'd get all the way to #4 with it, but he'd have to step up his game to compete in the new environment.\n\nGreat chart to have picked, @W.B. Really captures the music scene right at the start of a major inflection point.\n\nThat's true. I switched from an AM top 40 station to an FM top 40 in November 1980 and never looked back.\n\nThe hits continued on AM for quite a while, but (as noted) ratings and interest dropped. I remember for a while something called AM Stereo was thing. In this area, CKOC Hamilton was the first to do it in 1983, followed by CHUM and CFTR shortly afterwards. I don't think it really had much of a positive effect. Most of those stations gave up the hits during the next few years.\n\nThat 22-week run to the top was the longest in history at that point. It would be beaten in early '83 by a record that re-charted. Oddly, the Canadian and US 45s each had a different picture sleeve, which was unusual as most of the time they were the identical.\n\nI remember watching an Entertainment Tonight piece on Key Largo during early 1982 and one of the DJs they interviewed said they thought the reason it was such a big hit is because the weather was so bad for so many places that entire winter - and that we'd all like to escape to Key Largo for three minutes every four hours.\n\nThe debut at No. 29 for Ebony & Ivory was the highest debut since John Lennon's Imagine entered at No. 20 a decade prior. I was surprised when I picked up Billboard that week and saw the debut - I hadn't even heard the song yet!\n\nI quite liked Don't You Want Me when it was a hit, but it's like another (Jack and Diane mentioned above) that I heard just a few too many times. I have the 45 but I kind of like Human League's next No. 1 a little better. Good stuff though!"
