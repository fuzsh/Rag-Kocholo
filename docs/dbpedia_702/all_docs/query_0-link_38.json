        "text": "Working as an omnipresent pop figure in her genuinely independent micro-industry Jane Weaver is a rare example of a passionate and resilient Northern female artist who re-creates, re-invents and refreshes where many others come and go. Her synth-pop psych and conceptual pop LPs have earned her a faithful fan base which has extended to a long discography of collaborations often released through her own musical “Woman’s Institute” imprint Bird Records which she runs with Finders Keepers Records in Manchester. This Summer sees the release of her new self produced synth driven LP “The Silver Globe” made with a wide cast of global collaborators such as soundtrack composer David Holmes, Andy Votel with extra music from Australian prog legends Cybotron and sound effects from electronic pioneer Suzanne Ciani. Wearing her penchants for French wave, cosmic Deutch rock and European fantasy films on both of her sequinned sleeves Janes 6th studio album follows the highest critical acclaim for her previous self funded album ‘The Fallen By Watchbird’ and a campaign that bought together the unlikely coupling of artists like Wendy & Bonnie, Demdike Stare and The Focus Group. This year Jane’s new brand of motoric cold-funk and technicolor domestic synth flourishes unite 10 new conceptual pop songs about power-plant fun-fairs, sci-fi education centres and post-apocalyptic love affairs while her characteristic gossamer vocals cross octaves to theatrical deft effect."
