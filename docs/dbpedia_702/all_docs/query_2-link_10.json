The lyrics, however, remained squarely in the ’50s, with references to drive-ins, car hops and doo-wop.” Either way, the track unmistakably features an early 80s pop sound!\n\nDavis is perhaps best known for his ballad “I Go Crazy” (1977), which peaked at only #7 on the Hot 100 but remained in the Top 100 for 40 weeks, setting what was then the record for the longest run on that chart. He scored a 1982 hit with “’65 Love Affair,” which reached #6 on the Hot 100 and later spent 20 weeks on that chart. It also reached #5 on Billboard‘s Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.\n\nIn an interview with ClassicBands.com, Davis was asked about the lyric stating that the earlier era’s music was “simple and clear.” His response: “There’s something magical and inspirational about the discovery of what was the beginning of rock ‘n’ roll. The songs were simple. They weren’t real complicated. All of them didn’t deal in real heavy thoughts, either. It was just fun back then, and much simpler, easier to understand.”\n\nStarting in C mixolydian mode, the tune shifts to regular old C major for the chorus at 0:37, then back to C mixolydian at 1:02. At 3:15, there’s a shift up a whole step to D major just before the tune starts a long fade."
