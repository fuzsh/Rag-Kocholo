        "text": "The news that Prince is to play 21 dates in London this summer caused a great deal of excitement in my household, particularly when he explained exactly why he had chosen the capital. \"I've had some of my favourite shows here,\" he whispered. He promised to change the show every night because \"we play so many different styles of music, it's really hard to get a full dose of what we do unless you come to several shows. Also, I have a wide fan base that come to multiple shows; I see that a lot in London.\"\n\nHis last comment refers, of course, to me. I once saw him play 17 consecutive nights at Wembley Arena. This was 1990, his Thieves in the Temple tour, and by about the fifth evening, when he saw me, yet again, jigging around in the front row and performing all the actions to I Would Die 4 U he actually stopped the music, crossed his arms in that ultra-camp way of his, and rolled his huge, long-lashed eyes at me as if to say, \"Oh no, not you again.\" (My routines - and I am blushing as I write this - entailed 1. Coyly indicating an eye. 2 . Clutching at one's heart. 3. Holding up four fingers and then, finally, 4. pointing at \"P\", as we hardcore fans called him, even when he changed his name to a Squiggle; I had the character installed on my keyboard for when I wrote his biography - OK, a hagiography - back in 1996.) I think my proudest moment as a fan was when, during one particularly vigorous love-making session (with his mike stand, not me, don't be silly), he dripped sweat on me and watched as I dipped my finger in it and licked it off.\n\nI am wondering what outfit to wear to his upcoming concerts, because P is a little bit particular about what he has to cast his eyes over in the audience. For the 1987 Sign o' the Times concert in Paris we all had to wear peach and black; for the Lovesexy in-the-round gigs at Wembley we had to wear tight black Spandex, with words in white lettering down arms and legs. I wonder what it'll be this time, as both P (who is 48) and his fans are now so old?\n\nThe best news for us antiquated groupies (me and the rest of the front-row posse have been feverishly emailing each other since the dates were announced), is that, as well as seven concerts taking place at the Millennium Dome, the remainder will happen, on a whim, at various locations around London. My best memories of seeing the small one on stage are of the \"secret\" after-concert gigs he was rather partial to. What made those gigs unique is that you never knew what he was going to play, or who would join him on stage; one night it was Mica Paris, another Miles Davis.\n\nWhy was I so in love with Prince? From the very first album of his that I bought (Dirty Mind), I have always found that he stirred something deep and naughty inside me. I loved the fact that he was painfully shy, and that he loved women with not a hint of misogyny. He wanted to be our girlfriend, to dress us and to hear our problems. His songs spoke of performing cunnilingus which, let's face it, was pretty unheard of in most R&B records. I loved the fact that he felt he was ugly and so decided to transform himself into someone whom I, and millions of other women, found beautiful.\n\nWhen I interviewed him at his studio complex, Paisley Park, in Minneapolis, he was married (oh! The disappointment!), and his baby son had died shortly after birth, but he was still courteous and willing to give up his time. He is a great mimic. I was so nervous my mouth dried up and I started stammering, and he fell about laughing as he took me off: \"Y-y-yess L-l-lizzie, sp- sp-spit the question out!\" My best memory is of sitting next to him as he played one of his many pianos; he has beautiful, manicured, bony fingers.\n\nI will be first in line for my Â£31.21 ticket (a reference to the title of yet another new album, 3121). I have missed chasing Prince around the world in recent years. We have both grown a great deal older, but at least P, on the evidence of an alarming performance of the splits at a gig in Milan last September, has remained as supple as the first time I saw him, when he, and I, in homage, were wearing grubby raincoats over stockings in Camden in 1981.\n\nOh, those were the days and, hurrah!, they are about to come back."
