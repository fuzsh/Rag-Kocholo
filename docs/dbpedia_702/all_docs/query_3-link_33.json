        "text": "He was definately into the technology. I recall getting one of those demo sheet records (that you put the nickle on so it wouldn't slide) for the LT Sound Vocal Eliminator. Paul was demonstrating why he liked to use echo and reverb on his vocals and how that would help people who wanted to put their own voice over the new backing tracks they were creating with the Eliminator. He talked about how he did actual over dubbing of the background singers to make them sound more full than just using a delay.\n\nLet me just jump in here.\n\nThe main drums on those LRB tracks are very real, but if you mean that electronic tom sound (in Shut Down, Turn Off for example), those are Simmons drums.\n\nYou remember, those sextagonal shaped drum pads...they were actually little analog synthesizers that were triggered by the pads.\n\nThe Linn LM-1 was a digital machine that used samples."
