        "text": "Ambient Vision's Q & A With\n\nJohn Koch-Northrup about Relaxed Machinery & More\n\nAV: You've had quite a long history with music going all the way back to the age of 5. Tell me about your discovery of synths and electronics in relationship to your music and how you began to explore it.\n\nJKN: My grandma started teaching me piano when I was five. Although I don't really remember that far back really well, I'm assuming it was seeing her play the organ at their house that got me interested, and probably music just being \"in me\". She played organ for 65 years at the same church in the small town I grew up in. What an amazing thing. I have many great memories of her playing. Once she felt she'd taught me as much as she could she pushed me to another teacher - and it kind of went on like that over the years until I completely stopped taking piano lessons when I was 19."
