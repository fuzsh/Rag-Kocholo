        "text": "Paul Lavon Davis (April 21, 1948 – April 22, 2008) was an American singer and songwriter, best known for his radio hits and solo career which started worldwide in 1970. His career encompassed soul, country and pop music. Typically, the slower the tempo of a Davis record, the longer it took to reach its peak position. Notable songs in his career include 1977’s “I Go Crazy“, a No. 7 pop hit which once held the record for the longest chart run on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the No. 6 “‘65 Love Affair“, his highest-charting pop hit. In the mid-1980s, he also had two country No. 1 hits as a guest vocalist on songs by Marie Osmond and Tanya Tucker, and wrote singles for other country singers. His appearance in the mid-1970s to early 1980s resembled Leon Russell.\n\nBefore his death on April 22, 2008 (one day after his 60th birthday), Davis had returned to singing and songwriting by recording two songs, “You Ain’t Sweet Enough” and “Today.” He died from a heart attack at the Rush Foundation Hospital in Meridian, Mississippi. -Wikipedia"
