The music video features shots of the band as well as a feud between a maniacal alien and wacky bear. It was directed by Alex Zarek, who’s worked with the likes of Real Friends and Knuckle Puck.\n\n2. We Set Signals – “Where Were You”\n\nFor fans of: Point North, Stand Atlantic and Trash Boat\n\nBrisbane punk rockers We Set Signals shared their new song and music video for “Where Were You.” The track features dramatic crescendos, urgent guitar chords and powerful vocals that shape it into an extraordinary modern rock classic. Vocalist Nick Wilkinson entirely wrote, recorded, produced, mixed and mastered the track, sharing how he was inspired by a relationship that grew toxic. “After the breakup, I had no idea who I was or what I wanted,” he says. “It took everything in me to just survive and rebuild myself.”\n\n3.

The eclectic pop track features bouncy vocals and undeniably catchy synth parts sure to get stuck in your head. “‘Vertigo’ is a warning to a friend who’s trying to pursue someone who’s emotionally unavailable and has a history of breaking hearts,” vocalist Karina Savage noted. The band are preparing to release their sophomore record later this year, following up their successful 2018 debut LP, To Love You.\n\n5. Larkins – “Are We Having Any Fun Yet?”\n\nFor fans of: half•alive, Vistas and BLOXX\n\nManchester’s Larkins are proving they’re indie-rock up-and-comers with their new single and music video, “Are We Having Any Fun Yet?” It serves as the first release since their acclaimed EP, Hit And Run, which dropped in February. The experimental synth track pairs a somber delivery with an upbeat gang vocal chorus, encapsulating where the future of indie music is headed. The video accompaniment features stunning, emotive visuals as frontman Josh Noble wanders through the streets tired and bloody, truly a spectacle to behold.\n\nRead more: Machine Gun Kelly wants his new album to be about more than just music\n\n6.

The post-rock quintet announced they have signed to No Sleep Records, shared their haunting new single “Ad Nauseam, I Drown” and plan on releasing their fourth album later this year. Their single bends the confines of rock, morphing punk vocals with metal basslines and screams reminiscent of Jason Butler (letlive., FEVER 333). “The song is about the facade of relevance and where it sits on the spectrum between purposeful art and undignified bullshit,” the band say. “These days it often feels like we’re being smothered in the latter.” The band launched an exclusive seven-inch that has since sold out, but you can keep posted here for future preorders.\n\n7.
