        "text": "There's an interview with Steve Lillywhite (by John Robb) where he talks about first experimenting with what would become the gated sound on Siouxsie and the Banshees' album The Scream released November 1978.\n\nSometimes it works very well. But it depends who's steering the ship. A lot of 60's/ 70's rock stars that tried to adopt the 80's big sound failed miserably. I think a lot of that sound was being shoehorned into songs where it didn't belong. This was more of an issue with the 'rock dinosaurs' rather than newer artists though. Strangely Fleetwood Mac got away with it. 'Tango in the Night' is littered with every 80's cliche you can think of, but it works.\n\nPhil and Hugh Padgham, actually. Hugh was experimenting with gated reverb and Phil played to the sounds Hugh was creating.\n\nPeter liked the sound and the pattern Phil was playing and asked him to play/record it for several minutes. Peter (depending on which account you read) either wrote 'Intruder' after that, based on/inspired by what Phil played to the sound Hugh created, or he had already written 'Intruder' before that and then adapted it to work with the drum part Phil played.\n\nOf course Phil then hired Hugh Padgham to engineer his first solo album 'Face Value' (including 'In The Air Tonight') the following year (well, the studio overdubs for the album, as the basic tracks were actually Phil's self-recorded 8-track home demos - ie primarily keyboards and drum machine).\n\nAfter that Hugh Padgham was invited to engineer the next three Genesis albums (Abacab/ST/Invisible Touch).\n\nHugh Padgham became one of the \"go to\" guys for those looking for that particular big 80s drum sound.\n\nHere is Phil's home demo version (prior to being overdubbed in a proper studio for the album release of 'In The Air Tonight' (released as a B-Side):\n\nI have to disagree. I think 'Tainted Love' has that cool icey synth sound that was prominent in the very early 80's. It's a world away from the mid 80's synth sound.\n\nI think there are two categories of 80s sound:\n\n1. The 78-82 new wave / electronic sounds of some the bands mentioned in other threads - Human League, Gary Numan, the sonic Trevor Horn production stamp. MTV in 1981.\n\n2. The 83 - 89 bloated corporate rock sounds mentioned in the other threads too (Phil Collins is one example).\n\nBetween 89-91 you have the rise of Big Hair Rock (though that started in 87, but not including GNR) and by 91 you have the rise of Grunge (Nirvana et al).\n\nThese are somewhat loose dates, but these are my recollections, having been in high school and college from the late 70s through the 80s.\n\nAnd for those of you who follow the music of the original ELO, you'll know that Jeff Lynne was chasing electronic sounds during that time period - programmed drums, drum machines, and the keyboard systems mentioned above. Of course, the rapid movement of technology meant that Jeff could spend more time on pads and calculators rather than making warm, human music, and it shows in their last 3 albums (although Time has the most humanity since ELO played those songs live). No doubt that Lynne was influenced by Trevor Horn and the sounds of the period.\n\nI'd go sooner with Hair Metal. Slippery When Wet by Bon Jovi was 1986. I remember one track ('Let It Rock', I think) that was crazy over the top with 80's gimmicks.\n\nPeter Gabriel's 3rd album (released May 1980) features both (rather extensively) and it may also be where Kate Bush (who sang backing vocals on a couple songs on the album) was introduced to the Fairlight (which became a big part of her sound on her next album).\n\nAnyway here's PG's 'Intruder':\n\nGood call on Systems of Romance. That one tees up a lot of what was to come."
