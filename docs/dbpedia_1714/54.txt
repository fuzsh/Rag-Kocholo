Album Description & Collectors information:

This is the Coloured Red Vinyl Edition of the album "KISS - Dynasty" originally the seventh studio album by American hard rock band Kiss. It was produced by Vini Poncia and released on Casablanca Records on May 23, 1979. Dynasty marked the first time that the original four members of Kiss did not all appear together for the entire album. The album marked a departure from the band's hard rock sound towards a more pop-oriented sound with an emphasis on disco influences.

The album features the hit singles "I Was Made for Lovin' You" and "Sure Know Something", both of which were successful on the charts. The album also includes contributions from all four members of the band, with guitarist Ace Frehley taking lead vocals on "Hard Times" and bassist Gene Simmons singing lead on "Charisma" and "X-Ray Eyes".

The album received mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising the band's willingness to experiment with new styles while others criticized the band's departure from their traditional sound. However, it was a commercial success, reaching No. 9 on the US Billboard 200 chart and being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Overall, Dynasty is an important album in the Kiss discography, as it marked a significant shift in the band's sound and helped to establish them as a popular music act in the late 1970s.
