        "text": "Kesha‘s debut single “Tik Tok” is turning 15! On Tuesday, the “Joyride” singer celebrated the anniversary of the Animal single by reminiscing on its release and promising to re-record the song with the anti-Diddy “lyric change” she’s adapted at shows as soon as she’s legally allowed to do so.\n\n“TiK ToK was the first single that I put into this world that had my voice AND my name credited!!!! I remember making it fun and happy because that’s how I felt and wanted others to feel,” Kesha wrote on Instagram, captioning photos from the single’s photoshoot. “What I’m so proud of is that’s how this song STILL makes me feel, through it all, and those are emotions I want all of us to connect to.”\n\n“That girl was naive and wild and playful,” she added. “This song eternalizes a side of myself that I love very much, and now see I have to protect fiercely. The world has changed so much and so have I.⁣”\n\nSince disturbing allegations were made against Diddy in November 2023, Kesha has changed the track’s opening line “Wake up in the mornin’ feeling like P. Diddy” to “Wake up in the mornin’ like fuck P-Diddy” at live shows. She started singing the new version when she joined Reneé Rapp at Coachella in March.\n\n“I absolutely love the new lyric change,” she wrote. “Yes, it is permanent. ⁣I will re-record it when I have legal rights to! Now, my first baby stands for so much. It stands for fiercely protecting fun and unadulterated joy, in myself and in others.”\n\n“Tik Tok” was featured on the singer’s album Animal, which dropped in 2010. “TikTok” lasted nine weeks at Number One on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time, making history for having the highest digital downloads for a female artist in one week. The LP also featured other major hits, including “Your Love Is My Drug,” “Blah Blah Blah” with 3OH!3, and “Backstabber.”\n\nTrending\n\n“I hope you all can find 3 1/2 minutes of play in this song and connect with your wild child-like joy,” Kesha wrote. “Thank you for making my life so magical animals, it’s one for the books!”"
