        "text": "Pink Friday is the debut studio album by rapper Nicki Minaj. It was released on November 22, 2010, by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Universal Motown Records. After signing a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment in 2009, Minaj began planning the album that same year and work continued into 2010. Minaj enlisted a variety of producers whose efforts resulted in a primarily hip hop, pop and R&B album, which sees additional influences from electronic music. The album features guest vocals from Eminem, Rihanna, Drake, will.i.am, Kanye West and Natasha Bedingfield.\n\nThe album was promoted with eight singles; \"Your Love\", \"Check It Out\", \"Right Thru Me\", \"Moment 4 Life\", \"Super Bass\", \"Did It On'em\", \"Girls Fall Like Dominoes\", and \"Fly\". \"Super Bass\" peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and entered the top ten worldwide, while five other singles peaked within the top 40 on the Hot 100. Minaj also supported the album with a five-date promotional concert tour during October 2010. After a much anticipated release, Pink Friday debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 375,000 copies in its first week, marking the second highest sales debut for a female rapper since Lauryn Hill. The album later peaked at number one, becoming Minaj's first number one album.[1]\n\nNicki Minaj Album Sales To Date\n\nDownload Zip ðŸ”¥ https://tinurll.com/2yuXSh ðŸ”¥\n\nThe album received mostly positive reviews from critics, however some were ambivalent on Minaj's exploration of pop.[2] Internationally, it also charted within the top 20 in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[3] As of February 2018, the album has sold two million traditional copies in the United States.[4] The album has been certified 3 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined album sales, track sales, and song streams equivalent of three million album-sale units. Pink Friday was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012, alongside Minaj's other nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rap Performance for the single \"Moment 4 Life\". A sequel to the album, Pink Friday 2, was released in 2023.\n\nAfter a major record label bidding war, Young Money Entertainment announced on August 31, 2009, that Nicki Minaj had signed to the label.[5] Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording locations, including 25 Sound Studios in Detroit, Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California. Hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz confirmed his collaboration with Minaj for the album, with Minaj discussing a song \"Catch Me\", that she described as \"moody\" and \"mellow futuristic\" which later became a bonus track on the album.[6][7] Minaj also confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that the Black Eyed Peas member and record producer will.i.am contributed production to the album.[8] Hip-hop artist and producer Kanye West was also confirmed for the album.[9] Producer Bangladesh also contributed to the album.[10] In 2011, a track entitled \"We Miss You\" from the album leaked online.[11] Minaj responded saying the song \"was sent to Mariah Carey and Keyshia Cole over a year ago\" but did not \"make Pink Friday due to clearance issues\".[11]\n\n\"Right Thru Me\" is styled with pop-rap tones, and has an electronic beat, while being influenced by R&B.[13][22][23] Lyrically, the song describes someone who wonders aloud about how a lover can see the real her.[13][24] Lyrically, \"Moment 4 Life\", is about a desire to maintain a feeling of accomplishment, as Drake follows behind Minaj and raps the same theme of enjoying the moment.[25] Straying away from the standard rap song construction of three verses and a hook, Nicki performs a brain-dump of sorts on the track, spitting as if she's making a speech to both her fans and detractors.[26] \"Check It Out\" features the nearly constant repetition of the piano and vocal hook from the Buggles' 1979 classic, \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which is famous for being the first video ever played on MTV.[15] \"Super Bass\" utilizes electronic music and bubblegum pop in its composition, while Minaj raps over a hip hop beat,[27][28][29] Minaj explained the song's concept, stating: \"'Super Bass' is about the boy that you are crushing over, [...] And you kind of want to get your mack on, but you're taking the playful approach.\"[30]\n\n\"Massive Attack\" was released on April 13, 2010, through digital distribution. The song was a distinct change from Minaj's previous work on mixtapes and features, thus receiving mixed to positive reviews from critics, commending lyrical content and distinctiveness, but critiquing that it did not fit her \"Barbie\" persona well. The song bubbled under the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 22, and peaked at number 65 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Massive Attack\" was initially announced as the album's lead single, however, after the single's poor chart performance, it was pulled from the album.[31]\n\n\"Your Love\" was released as the album's first official US single on June 1, 2010, and as the first single in the United Kingdom on July 2, 2010. Initially, the song had never been planned for release, but due to abounding airplay it was mastered and used as the follow-up to \"Massive Attack\". The song peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, number four on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and topped the Hot Rap Songs chart for eight consecutive weeks. Minaj became the first female artist to top the Hot Rap Songs chart unaccompanied since 2002. It also charted in Canada and the UK.[32]\n\n\"Check It Out\" was released on September 3, 2010.[33] It was a joint single from the album between will.i.am and Minaj.[34] A music video for the song was directed by Rich Lee and was released on October 25, 2010.[35] The song has since peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Right Thru Me\" was released on September 24, 2010. A music video directed by Diane Martel was released for the single on October 27, 2010.[36] The song peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\"Moment 4 Life\", which features Drake, was released on December 7, 2010,[37] as the album's fourth single. The music video for \"Moment 4 Life\" was released on January 27, 2011.[38] The song peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped both the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Rap Songs charts. \"Roman's Revenge\" featuring Eminem was released as a promotional single to iTunes on October 30, 2010.[citation needed]\n\n\"Super Bass\" was released as the album's fifth single and officially impacted radio on April 5, 2011.[39] It was released to iTunes in some markets on May 13, 2011. The song became an international top ten hit. In its seventh week on the Billboard Hot 100, the song had peaked at number 3, making it Minaj's first top ten placement as a lead artist.[40]\n\n\"Fly\", which features Rihanna, was the album's eighth and final single. It was sent to US rhythmic radio and to Top 40/Mainstream radio on August 30, 2011.[41][42] The song peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as in the top 20 in Australia and the United Kingdom.[citation needed]\n\nOn July 8, 2010, Minaj announced via Twitter that the album would be released on November 23, 2010.[43] It was later announced that the album was pushed up by one day to November 22, 2010.[44] Minaj's official website and related social networking outlets later announced that the digital download version of the album would be available for pre-order through iTunes on October 30, less than a month before the release date of the physical edition.[45]\n\nOn her Twitter, Minaj stated that if she reached one million followers she would dedicate a Ustream to her fans. On August 3, 2010, Minaj went on Ustream to call fans who emailed her their phone numbers and to reveal the album's title.[14] Later that same day, Minaj revealed on Ustream that the album's name would be Pink Friday, stating, \"To carry on a great tradition of Black Friday, we are going to switch it up this year in honor of the Nicki Minaj album and call that day Pink Friday, and call my album Pink Friday!\"[46] A deluxe edition of the album was also confirmed.[47] Minaj released the official artwork for her album cover on Friday, October 15, 2010.[48] Rap-Up commented on the album cover, stating \"The cover features Minaj as a doll alarmingly staring at the camera, sitting armless on the ground with her elongated legs in a flowing silver corset, pink stilettos, and a stark pink wig.\"[49] GL Woods, the photographer of the cover, stated that Minaj wanted to look like a \"broken Barbie\".[50] Woods photographed Minaj for an Out, which had a similar theme; according to the photographer, Minaj was inspired by the photoshoot.[50]\n\nPrior to the release of Pink Friday, MAC Cosmetics announced and launched a lipstick called \"Pink 4 Friday\" that was sold for four consecutive Fridays beginning November 26, 2010, in promotion of the album.[51] In 2011, OPI Products created a six-piece nail polish collection with Minaj, in which the colors of the collection were named after select songs from the album.[52] In December 2011, Mattel produced a custom-made, Minaj-themed Barbie doll valued at about $15,000 for auction. The doll's design was modeled after Minaj as how she appears on the Pink Friday album cover, with the pink wig and a similar outfit.[53][54]\n\nA 2020 reissue of the album, titled \"Complete Edition\", was released to coincide with its 10th anniversary on November 20, 2020, containing all the bonus tracks that were released from other versions of the album, such as \"Bedrock\", and the Lil Wayne remix of \"Roman's Revenge\".\n\nMinaj announced via the social networking site Twitter that she would kick off a five-date promotional tour a month before the album dropped.[55] Tweeting, \"Ok Barbz, here are the 1st 5 dates on my Pink Friday Tour,\" the tour began in Philadelphia on October 22, and ran through October 30 in Trinidad and Tobago.[55][56] 9d9a05e021\n\nfree download games for android phone\n\nwatch season 3 suits online free\n\nrave motion pictures hurst tx movie times\n\ndownload the big bang theory season 1\n\nwhat is the score of the afc championship game"
