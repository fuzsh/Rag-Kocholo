        "text": "The discography of American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, consists of 12 studio albums, 23 live albums, 3 compilation albums, 42 singles, and numerous official bootlegs.\n\nPearl Jam was formed in 1990 by bassist Jeff Ament, guitarist Stone Gossard, and guitarist Mike McCready,[1] who then recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder and drummer Dave Krusen. The band signed to Epic Records in 1991. A few months after the completion of the band's debut studio album, Ten, drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band. Ten broke Pearl Jam into the mainstream, and became one of the best-selling alternative albums of the 1990s.[2] Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, Vs. Upon its release, Vs. set the record for most copies of an album sold in a week,[3] and spent five weeks at the top of the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. Burdened by the pressures of success, Pearl Jam decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos.[4] In 1994, the band released its third studio album, Vitalogy, which became the band's third straight album to reach multi-platinum status in the U.S."
