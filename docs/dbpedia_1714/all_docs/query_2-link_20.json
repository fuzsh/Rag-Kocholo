The theme was composed and produced by Chance, and can be previewed (and potentially purchased) at iTunes, Amazon and all the usual outlets.\n\nChance also has a new soundtrack album out this month. On November 8th, Ubisoft Music released the Dinosaurs Strike OST. The original orchestral action score was composed and orchestrated by Chance with Aurelien Baguerre producing. Tracks were recorded in Prague and Salt Lake City. Paul Taylor handled sheet music preparation while Pierre Langer contracted the orchestra. The score was mixed at The Pod, HUGEsound and Dynamedian by Mike Roskelley, Chance Thomas and Tillman Sillescu.
