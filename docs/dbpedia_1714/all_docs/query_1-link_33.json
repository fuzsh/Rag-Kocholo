        "text": "This month is the No Nut November month, which meant we were on the diet from things like nuts (probably not, it just an unrelated NNN event). Speaking of no nutting, here’s a bunch of new albums that is going to blow your nuts. Whether it’s going to bust a nut or fail to surpass, that’s why we’re put a test on these newest releases.\n\nIn New Album on the Corner, we were breaking down several Indonesian albums that dropped by this month. It would be their revelations of their true colors of their albums. Whether it’s an album or extended play, we would check them out for their sounds.\n\n1. A. Nayaka — Culture Shock\n\nTracklist :\n\nTop\n\nMarila Berdansa\n\nSweet Time\n\nTenang\n\nToo Long\n\nDrunk Calling [ft. K. Waltz]\n\nManusia [ft. Nisya, Basboi]\n\nCompany\n\nStronger\n\nBreathe\n\nNo Complaints [ft. Ben Utomo, Fariz Jabba]\n\nPAY’D [ft. YHB Sleepsalot, Wolfy]\n\nPOP [ft. ALYPH]\n\nIt all started when A. Nayaka & his family move to Houston, Texas in 2001. During his Houston years, that’s when he started to embraced hip-hop music. Upon return to his home country, he decided to became a musician by started with joining a metal band in the late 2000’s. After that, he return to his hip-hop early roots and started to make his own music independently before he signed to a major label called Def Jam Indonesia. So far, he drops 4 studio albums, 1 EP, & 2 mixtapes during his milestone.\n\nA years and not long after his recent album titled “Cold Cuts” dropped, A. Nayaka make his move again with his another new album titled “Culture Shock”. He recollected his life journey with bilingual approach is somehow a smooth move. The way he delivered the bilingual language between English & Bahasa on each tracks felt so new to matched the album’s vibe, let alone the variation of its sound range. However, there’s some minuses that could have been elevated by himself if not alone. This new album is totally neat by overall.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Top, Sweet Time, Tenang, Drunk Calling, Manusia, Company, Stronger, Breathe, PAY’D, POP\n\n2. Adlani Rambe — Bidadari Terindah\n\nTracklist :\n\nHingga Tutup Usia\n\nBidadari Terindah\n\nKu Harus Memilikimu\n\nDahulu\n\nVitamin\n\nLalai\n\nCerita Yang Sama\n\nSaat Ku Mulai Nyaman\n\nTeman Buaya\n\nAdlani Rambe is well-known for making cover songs from Musica Studio’s artists since he himself was introduced in the surface as a newcomer in 2020 and the label gave him his shot to created the cover version of Nike Ardilla in one album. After his first move, he began to throw a bunch of cover albums everywhere from the beginning of 2020's.\n\nWorking as usual, Adlani Rambe went on to released his new album titled “Bidadari Terindah”. By this time, he took a different turn on his musicality than his previous direction before. This album is pretty much heavily ballad but not too much at all. The lyricism is also pretty basic and nothing does harm for it. But on the downside, he seemingly struggling to slipped the zeitgeist onto this album as well. Since this album is filled with original works, it’s somewhat between mediocre and decent to put it mildly.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Hingga Tutup Usia, Bidadari Terindah, Ku Harus Milikimu, Dahulu, Vitamin, Cerita Yang Sama\n\n3. Drewgon — Purple Season\n\nTracklist :\n\nSahasrara [ft. Annisya]\n\nLive as a King, Die as a Legend [ft. Damero.]\n\nBANGIN’\n\nPurple Hearts [ft. Yacko]\n\nIce & Fire [ft. Flyzad]\n\nHip-hop scene in the eastern part of Indonesia is in the position of bubbling pot where it developed slowly but spread widely at small scale. One of the latest example would have to be Drewgon from Kei Island, Maluku, who take part of the rap game since his entrance in the late 2010’s by participate in national scale hip-hop contest. 2 years after his first showoff, he began to deployed his songs including his first studio album. Not only that, he also working together with several notable musicians such as Mardial, Ben Utomo, Yacko, etc.\n\n3 years after the successful release of his debut album, Drewgon launched his new EP titled “Purple Season”. You can heard how much raw energy he put in while inserting various elements of trap, drill, afrobeat, & not to mention R&B as well. He expressed a lot of things on this EP from one topic to another like self esteem, self confidence, & inner peace. That whole thing could have been more purple if he can make a right portion that made this EP so good. By the way, this whole thing felt so strong-willed from his perspective, could not argue more to overlook on this one.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Sahasrara, BANGIN’, Ice & Fire\n\n4. Heals — Emerald\n\nTracklist :\n\nSilau\n\nGleam\n\nOxymoron\n\nTasteless\n\nWeathre\n\nEnvi\n\nSupra\n\nDesign\n\nAir Emas\n\nWalking Cliche\n\nAre You Ready\n\nNo one ever felt so fuzzy other than one of the prominent shoegaze band from Bandung named Heals. Founded in 2013, this band blew people out of the water with their thoughtful approach on the aspect of perspective. Their debut album in 2017 put the band as a big deal for the music scene in Bandung but only to stay on the low cut after doing many shows around the corner.\n\nAfter taking a long period of hiatus, Heals has finally return and FFWD Records literally woke up from their torpor bed. By this occasion of their comeback, the band released their newest album titled “Emerald”. About this sophomore album, the band really made it more complex and more mature to delivered this one absolute unit. It’s not just that, they gave even more surprises from every side, which aren’t limited to genre, instrumentation, or theme’s plotline. By overall, this is their best comeback album or called it as ‘boundary breaker’ album.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Silau, Gleam, Oxymoron, Tasteless, Weathre, Envi, Supra, Design, Air Emas, Walking Cliche, Are You Ready\n\n5. Leipzig — Coltrane Brigade Communique\n\nTracklist :\n\nMenunggu Begal\n\nThe Beach Beneath the Paving Stone\n\nFrom Paris to Cisokan\n\nJazz in the City\n\nDeluded & Distracted [ft. Elang Eby]\n\nForever Bacang\n\nNembang Wirahma (The Mackenzie Montage) [ft. Latif Prabowo]\n\nGoodbye Blue Monday\n\nLe Dulpas Terror! [ft. Brez84]\n\nCadas Pangeran in C Minor\n\nStill remain in the same place called Bandung, there’s another band that worked in the garbage disposal unit named Leipzig. Their primary song titled “Nothing Grand & Nothing Fun” really solidifed their sounds of 1970’s post-punk and it blew people’s ear by its infectious snarky mode. The moment they heard their song and so do to their first album, the band attracts more followings overnight.\n\nLast year, Leipzig had a great shot with their debut album. But by this time, the band is going to take another shot with their new album titled “Coltrane Brigade Communique”. It’s a bit shady at first but you won’t believe what you just listened on the next entire tracklist and this album is almost everything sounds so interesting. The lyricism is more heavier than their first album, Their commitment to exploration are being shown in full motion, and they even delivered it with multilingual approach. This wild one album is more than just raw, but it does outblown their sonic direction to the next level.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : The Beach Beneath the Paving Stone, From Paris to Cisokan, Jazz in the City, Deluded & Distracted, Forever Bacang, Nembang Wirahma (The Mackenzie Montage), Goodbye Blue Monday, Le Dulpas Terror!, Cadas Pangeran in C Minor\n\n6. Summerlane — Hope, Fear & Everything in-Between\n\nTracklist :\n\nHeaven’s Hell\n\nSebelum Selamanya [ft. Chintya Gabriella]\n\nSomewhere Somehow\n\nDance Over Me\n\nSummerbones\n\nSebelum Selamanya\n\nIn a typical basis of pop punk band, it would be always to have some formation changes from time to time. This had been happened many times to Summerlane from Jakarta that experienced the same ups & downs thing. Beside all of that, they build their reputation in the late 2010’s and they seemingly overcome the barrier around their neck.\n\nJust like regular day, Summerlane return to their cooking base. But by this time, they released their new EP titled “Hope, Fear & Everything in-Between”. So far, the band kept their energetic pop punk forces going around with their new EP and the outcome is a decent between hit & miss. The lyrics doesn’t go far away from their daily basis like youth spirit, relationship issues, and uncertainty. For overall, it’s an alrighty one without any exaggeration at all.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Heaven’s Hell, Sebelum Selamanya [ft. Chintya Gabriella], Summerbones, Sebelum Selamanya\n\n7. INDAHKUS — Eclipse\n\nTracklist :\n\nIt’s You [ft. PB GLAS]\n\nSepercik Kenangan\n\nHow to Let You Go\n\nTakut Kesepian\n\nToxic\n\nWanna talk about K-pop? Yes, but not in South Korea. We’re talking about a musician that does the whole experimentation on its thing and her name is INDAHKUS if you wonder or curious about it. She started her music career off independently and she has her own record label where she cooked her own music. As the years past by, her popularity got grew when her debut album came out thanks to one of the tracks that spotlighted on the last one.\n\nSince 2023 is another year for her to make music, especially singles, INDAHKUS decided to released her new EP titled “Eclipse”. On the sidenote, she unveiled her other side of its personal aspect. In the case of sonic direction, she took two-way street approach by implementing both hyperful & balladry at the same time on this EP. This one could be enjoyable while listening at full length.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : It’s You, Sepercik Kenangan, How to Let You Go, Takut Kesepian\n\n8. Dead Bachelors — Special\n\nTracklist :\n\nLast Night Was Amazing\n\nA Weekend Song for Me and You [ft. Vira Talisa]\n\nSpecial [ft. Shinjoko]\n\nGone\n\nGrowing Up with You [ft. Andreas Arianto]\n\nIt all began with two radio host at Prambors named Narendra Pawaka & Mario Pratama. They worked together for a long time and they had their nickname called ‘Duo Budjang’. One day, both came out with the idea of making their own band called Dead Bachelors. Ever since then, the duo created their musical dynamicism that revolved around alternative indie as their main pillar. Between the late 2010’s and early 2020’s, they had a lot of nerf to bringing a bunch of new colors to their musicality.\n\n2 years after their third EP was released, Dead Bachelors make their return with their new EP titled “Special”. Speaking of sonic tales, they bring something more charismatic and managed to culminated their new offering on this EP. Not too shady since the duo make it sounded so charming.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Last Night Was Amazing, Special, Gone, Growing Up with You\n\n9. Pongki Barata — POP\n\nTracklist :\n\nAku Peluk Kamu\n\nPertemuan Kedua\n\nIrama Asmara\n\nHati Yang Terang\n\nBerartikah Diriku Bagimu\n\nKuat Sendirian\n\nJiwaku Hidupku\n\nJiwa Muda\n\nAku Peluk Kamu (Saxophone Version)\n\nIrama Asmara (Saxophone Version)\n\nWho doesn’t get to know so much better being a notable songwriter in Indonesia other than Pongki Barata. Beside his main role in Jikustik (now a former member), he has a solo career that still run to this day and he also co-founded his side project band called The Dance Company. This is the same musician that responsible for notable hits in 2000’s such as “Seperti Yang Kau Minta”, “Menangis Semalam”, “Aku Bukan Pilihan”, etc. He even carved his name as one of the songwriter icon in this country.\n\nNot long after digging his old stuff from his Jikustik years, Pongki Barata released his new album again titled “POP”. It’s another Jikustik’s sixth studio album situation all over again but it was made by himself in a synth pop mode. For the entire part, it’s a 50:50 outcome when it comes to maintain its experimentation, whether it’s from the outside or inside of his musicality. Nothing special nor surprising about this album but at least he does something refreshing about his early influences back in the 80’s. Plus, big kudos to Tommy Widodo (One Way’s keyboardist) for co-producing this whole concept album.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Pertemuan Kedua, Hati Yang Terang, Berartikah Diriku Bagimu, Kuat Sendirian, Jiwaku Hidupku\n\n10. Karina Christy — Circle\n\nTracklist :\n\nDylan\n\nBetter with You [ft. William]\n\nBlue\n\nLittle Kid [ft. RIMALDI]\n\n80 (Interlude)\n\nPlease\n\nCan’t Escape\n\nShould’ve Been\n\nAll Good\n\nNight Like This (Voice Memo)\n\nKarina Christy had a near hit run on Indonesian Idol (Season 7), but only ended up in Top 15 and didn’t even make it to Spectacular Round. In the aftermath, she became the vocalist of Asta and then she decided to launch her solo career instead. She drops a handful of singles on a few occasions and somehow made a minor breakthrough.\n\nAfter the ups and downs of her milestone, Karina Christy has finally released her very first album titled “Circle”. The nuance is almost like a full circle, she spilled her recollection of her friendship, her family, her love life, and any other aspect that related to her daily lives. The execution deliverance is a bit upbeat and somehow can be sounded serene as well. Could not be less flawed if it’s considered to be decent. Not a big problem to tackled the nearest barrier around the album’s theme.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Dylan, Better with You, Blue, 80 (Interlude), Please, Should’ve Been, All Good, Night Like This (Voice Memo)\n\n11. Twnts — Arah Waktu\n\nTracklist :\n\nIntro\n\nHai Untukmu\n\nMenunggu [ft. Lala Fidela]\n\nTak Memiliki\n\nLosing You\n\nWhen it comes to Malang, there’s two things that comes to people’s mind, an apple & Coldiac. But there’s another band lived with their undiscovered potential named Twnts. They kicked off their gigs in 2020 and started to score their performance in every campus throughout the early 2020’s. This band entered the surface as one of the newcomer acts that were on the run.\n\nBefore 2023 come to an end, the right moment came for Twnts to released their debut EP titled “Arah Waktu”. So basically, the band carried their pop sounds with the few variety of styles. Just like what laid out in the album’s title, the band interprets each different time cycles that always gonna have the beginning & the end, it happened on every living aspect. That kind of sonic direction with brainstorming approach is really what made this EP so raw & fresh at the first impression. It’s a great start by this new band.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Intro, Hai Untukmu, Menunggu, Tak Memiliki, Losing You\n\n12. Sara Fajira — Tresna\n\nTracklist :\n\nInto You\n\nHinggil\n\nLara\n\nTresna\n\nYtb, Got It\n\nSweet Tooth [ft. Naykilla]\n\nLost & Not Found\n\nMoonstruck\n\nTranquil\n\nSara Fajira started off as a young rapper that kicked her debut on national television. But one day, she’s being tasked to be a featured vocal for Weird Genius and one of their song titled “LATHI”. When her collab song dropped to the world, all hell broke loose. It became a phenomenon hits in the entire archipelago, that success elevated her name also. But this is also where she ended up being as a one wonder hits artist for some reason.\n\nMany people wonder what Sara Fajira is doing now, this is what she’s been into. By this time around, she dropped his debut album titled “Tresna” and the title can be read in upside down by the way. Ah yes, it’s exactly what she got into with small niche of Javanese music element that circulated around the boiling pot of electropop. She even put up a nerve to dig deep into the meaning of love with a hybrid sense of mixed feelings to it. Let’s just hope that she would not being ended up as just another one-hit wonder artist because this new album has a lot of potential going on.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Into You, Hinggil, Lara, Tresna, Ytb, Got It, Sweet Tooth, Tranquil\n\n13. Atta Halilintar — Novebless\n\nTracklist :\n\nBlessing [ft. Aurelie Hermansyah, Kris Dayanti, Anang Hermansyah, Lenggogeni Faruk, Ashanty]\n\nBalin [ft. Aurelie Hermansyah, Rhoma Irama]\n\nAshiap [ft. Joe Flizzow, MK K-Clique]\n\nMerah Putih Selamanya [ft. Bia Dozan, Eno Smaper]\n\nAku Juga Manusia [ft. Sohwa Halilintar]\n\nKonoha Wakanda [ft. Thariq Halilintar, Jeri Taufik Lizam]\n\nSexy Heart [ft. Zynakal]\n\nMy Idol\n\nHey Nak\n\n*sigh* For Allah’s sake, how on earth do we have to break down on this one. You’ve got a YouTuber that responsible for ruining YouTube in Indonesia (particularly on trending page), the dude who breed the prank video then made some unnecessary clarification videos, the same person who make the most WHY-est superheroine movie called “Ashiapman”, and this is the guy who made the goofiest disstrack titled “Work Hard Pray Hard” that opened with ‘numbers don’t lie, angka yang berbicara’. You don’t need an introduction since you know about Atta Halilintar or at least to pretend he doesn’t exist. (dear lord, please save us!)\n\nAnyone thought that Atta Halilintar just ended up in a single format but nope, he actually dropped his album format by this year. So, he released his debut album titled “Novebless” and so let’s suffer together throughout this one hell of a ride. So, how does it feel after listening to this whole thing? Baffled? Frustated? Nauseating? Or face palm? It could be more than just all of the above. There’s another question mark about this album, how the hell did he reunited Anang Hermansyah & Kris Dayanti as the co-featured? All the while, both former duet spouse did single-handedly carried the first track for the specific part. Some of them is redeemable but for the most tracks, WHY do we even bother anyway? It’s better to get a therapy session after getting through of this whole bland album.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Blessing, Merah Putih Selamanya, Aku Juga Manusia\n\n14. Psaiki — Death Wish\n\nTracklist :\n\nCancer Stick\n\nNonesense [ft. Red Uzi]\n\nHow I Been\n\nLong Time\n\nI Went Too Far\n\nPsaiki entered the game of rap music as a newcomer & also an obscured rapper. He blazing his way from 2022 and it’s just nearly keeps of it. Despite being obscured from the start, that doesn’t really stop him as a productive musician as he does today.\n\nPutting another productive work as usual and shortly after his recent studio album went out, Psaiki released his new EP titled “Death Wish”. It looks like his heatstroke doesn’t died out yet and this EP is packed as psyche as it can be. At the clout perimeter, it’s a bit tighter on a portion without overwhelming. Like any other day, his ride isn’t going to stop as the tracklist goes. It’s a nearly blunt EP, good but flawed.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Nonesense, How I Been, Long Time, I Went Too Far\n\n15. Suara Kayu — Perjalanan Mimpi\n\nTracklist :\n\nObat Rindu [ft. Kucaimars]\n\nTak Perlu Ada Senja [ft. Fiersa Besari]\n\nKembali Pulang [ft. Feby Putri]\n\nKubiarkan Kau Pergi Hari Ini [ft. Rio Ardhillah]\n\nIstimewa Di Hati [ft. Project Pop]\n\nRekat [ft. Arif Hidayat, Gritte Agatha]\n\nLove Forever (English Version) [ft. Arash Buana]\n\nLove Forever (Indonesian Version) [ft. Arash Buana]\n\nDuring the first year of COVID-19 pandemic, Suara Kayu knocked the door at the music scene. As the rookie folk duo, they really stand out as one of the prominent acts in the early 2020’s. Shortly after the duo landed their record deal with Warner Music Indonesia, they were able to widespread their works on a large scale. So far, they dropped at least 2 albums since their breakthrough.\n\nIt seems Suara Kayu isn’t going to stop for breaking the mold, the duo released their new album titled “Perjalanan Mimpi”. For the first time on their milestone, they made a collaborative album which each of these tracks has featured artists like Fiersa Besari, Feby Putri, Project Pop, Arash Buana, Arif Hidayat, & etc. The duo has surely made their dream vision out of this album. Most of the chemistry between the duo and its featured artists are closely matched along, not to mention with basic theme about story’s recollection around them. It’s nearly excellent to say at least.\n\nFarrel’s Cuts : Obat Rindu, Tak Perlu Ada Senja, Kembali Pulang, Kubiarkan Kau Pergi Hari Ini, Rekat, Love Forever (English Version), Love Forever (Indonesian Version)"
