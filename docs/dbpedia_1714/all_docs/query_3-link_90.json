        "text": "On 3. May 1977, Kiss entered Record Plant studio, New York City, to record “Love Gun” with Eddie Kramer again as producer. It is the first Kiss album to feature a lead vocal performance from Ace on “Shock Me”. He recorded his lead vocal part while lying on the floor of the studio because he liked the added pressure on his chest. Making “Love Gun” the first album to feature lead vocal performances from all four band members (It was also the last studio album to feature Peter on every song).\n\nPaul Stanley:\n\n“I wrote “Love Gun” on the airplane to Japan. That was written in my head, the whole thing. And then when I landed I had to play it to make sure it worked and it was all there. I think most of the time when you write songs that are great, you know it. I always thought “Love Gun” was a great song, and today I still think it’s a tremendous song. It’s probably the song I enjoy playing the most. To me “Love Gun” is quintessential Kiss and is probably one of the five signature essential songs. I played bass on the song. I was at a point where I liked going to Electric Lady recording demos on my own and coming up with the parts and the arrangements. With some songs it was clearly a matter of giving people parts to play because the vision I had was complete. A song was not only a song but it was an arrangement. So it was easier to go in the studio and say here’s what the picture looked like. If I remember, no one was available to come in to play bass, which was all the better. The bass part just made sense.”\n\n– “Kiss: Behind the mask”, book by David Leaf"
