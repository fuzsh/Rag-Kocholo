        "text": "It feels absolutely bamboozling that 2010 was a whole decade ago. From the devastating Haitian earthquake and Chilean miner’s miracle to the vuvuzela-infested South African Football World Cup and spiralling Wikileaks fiasco, there was plenty – good, bad and downright ugly – to stick in the memory.\n\nIn terms of rock music, though, it was a resounding annus mirabilis. As the pop-punk and metalcore trends that had dominated the ’00s had stagnated, we saw a return to a truly alternative sound. Whether in the establishment of new artists who would go on to dominate (Ghost, Kvelertak, The Menzingers, letlive.), in the daring diversification of existing heavyweights (Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance, Bring Me The Horizon), or in the return to form of the most reliable standard-bearers (Deftones, Avenged Sevenfold, Jimmy Eat World), rock music was exciting, thought-provoking, thoroughly alive.\n\nTen years down the line, many of those albums have been heightened by retrospect: love, loss and the inexorable artistic evolution of our greatest performers all impacting the contemporary listening experience. It’s fascinating to think how these records shaped sounds – and attitudes – today. Which of this Top 50 do you still have on heavy rotation? And which rippers have we missed? Let us know in the comments…\n\nHarvey Milk – the experimental noise-rock collective from Athens, GA named after the United States' first openly gay elected politician – had been churning away in one form or another for the best part of two decades by the time they released eighth (and still latest) studio album A Small Turn Of Human Kindness. Sonically, it was the ultimate statement of their monolithic, slab-heavy quality, but its real stand-out attribute was the arch melancholia of tracks like I Just Want To Go Home and I Know This Is All My Fault, which owed as much to more mainstream miserabilists like Leonard Cohen and Nick Cave as Sunn O))) and Black Sabbath.\n\n“I remember that we were doing a lot of drugs at this point,” Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba has reflected to K! on the making of his band’s aptly-titled seventh album. “As a result, it was a really, really fun record for us to make, but totally not for very good reasons. But, like all Alkaline Trio records, the songs on there are really honest.” The first record released through their own Heart & Skull label, This Addiction’s tales of narcotic infatuation, love, death, divorce, grief, suicide, politics, and war offered fans their clearest view thus far into the Chicagoan songwriters’ hearts, while the economic compositions of songs like Lead Poisoning, Piss & Vinegar and Dorothy brought back the blackened pop-punk mega-hooks with which they’d made their name.\n\nAfter a period of experimentation, Korn returned to the formula they knew best for album number nine. For detractors, the tellingly-titled Remember Who You Are is just that: formulaic. Recording as a four-piece and reuniting with uber-producer Ross Robinson, however, there is much to enjoy here. Singles Oildale (Leave Me Alone) and Let The Guilt Go are amongst their roughest-edged latter day promos, while there’s an unchained energy about album tracks like Pop A Pill and Trapped Underneath The Stairs that still concussively connects.\n\nWhen it came to writing his band’s breakthrough sophomore LP, The Wonder Years frontman Dan “Soupy” Campbell came to a realisation: perhaps the overwhelming depression he’d been suffering was being exacerbated by the sad music with which he’d been surrounding himself for so long. Aptly titled, The Upsides saw him striving to find the silver linings while still acknowledging the internal darkness. Songs as heartfelt as Everything I Own Fits In This Backpack and Hostels & Brothels made this the powerful first entry in a trilogy that would continue with 2011’s Suburbia I’ve Given You All And Now I’m Nothing and 2013’s The Greatest Generation.\n\nSo often has the description been repeated that referring to High On Fire’s unstoppable brand of overdriven stoner metal as “Motörhead-alike” has long since passed into cliché. Lemmy and the lads would’ve needed to be on a small mountain of speed to churn out a record as relentless as this, mind. Frontman Matt Pike sounds utterly possessed as the eight-and-a-half minute title-track burns into Frost Hammer and out across the likes of The Path and Fire, Flood & Plague, with the Des Kensel’s war machine drumming and Jeff Matz’s emphatic bass perfectly complementing the unyielding horns up/heads down composition.\n\nAlthough Liverpudlian progsters Anathema had almost entirely left behind the death-doom sounds that had once placed them alongside Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride as early as 2001, there was a pervasive melancholy about their work that lingered on. Eighth album We’re Here Because We’re Here saw them step into the light. From that sun-dappled artwork to the broader progressive atmospherics of songs like Thin Air and A Simple Mistake, this was the sound of a great band chasing the possibilities of a new day.\n\nThe disbandment of atmospheric Portland black metallers Agalloch in 2016 robbed heavy music of one of its most compelling and distinctive forces. After 2002’s brilliant sophomore release The Mantle, Marrow Of The Spirit is probably the best example of why. With six tracks running to over 65 minutes, there is a raw, rustic feel underlying the beauty and chaos of songs like Into The Painted Grey and Ghosts Of The Midwinter Falls. Scandinavian black metal might’ve set the bar, but this frostbitten masterpiece from the other side of the world raised it.\n\nTranslating, with minimal comprehensibility, as 'Moon Scales', the second album by French blackgaze masters Alcest was their first to feature now-integral drummer Jean “Winterhalter” Deflandre, and marked a proper sonic breakthrough with the scourging black metal of their roots stretched over shoegazey, post-rock soundscapes. A concept album about one man’s transcendent journey to another plane of existence, it has often been interpreted as a metaphor about death and the hereafter. Instead, frontman Neige has noted that its imagery should be less abstractly construed, and that songs like Percées de Lumière (Openings Of Light) and Solar Song simply depict the melancholic beauty of the imagined netherworld on which all of his music is based.\n\nSitting down to write his band’s seventh album, Jimmy Eat World mainman Jim Adkins made the unusual decision to pore over a collection of assorted works from photographers like Cindy Sherman and Hannah Starkey, formulating each song as a closed narrative based on the figures depicted. His aim was to delve deeper into character study than ever before. The results were intriguing, with the patchwork nature of Invented lending itself to a retrospective exploration of the band’s subtly shifting style up to that point, while the move away from personally reflective songwriting allowed new shades of urgency and melodrama to seep into songs like the swooning Cut and surging My Best Theory.\n\nThe fifth and final album from Sacramento underground alt. heroes Far was an overdue emotional culmination. Twelve years since Water & Solutions – after which the band initially called it quits – they dropped this final parting statement. More confident and commercial-sounding than their earlier brand of outsider post-hardcore, songs like Give Me A Reason and The Ghost That Kept On Haunting burst with catharsis and wonder. It’s the title-track, though – written for Deftones bassist Chi Cheng shortly before his passing – that best encapsulates the pent-up frustration and sadness of their extended hiatus.\n\nThe death of drummer, founding member and talented songwriter Jimmy ‘The Rev’ Sullivan on December 28, 2009 was a hammer-blow to his Avenged Sevenfold bandmates, and could very well have spelled the end of the band. Refusing to meekly fade away, the Huntington Beach metallers recruited Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy (one of The Rev’s great influences) and channelled their internal tumult – that grief, uncertainty and rage – into a record that was heavier (both sonically and emotionally) than anything they had produced before. Tracks like Buried Alive, So Far Away and Welcome To The Family stand as enduring tributes to their lost friend.\n\nAgainst Me!’s fifth album was born from a period of uncertainty for the band. There had been a minor fan backlash to the apparently “overproduced” sound of 2007’s New Wave. They had suffered a bus crash on I-80 in October 2008. Long-term drummer Warren Oakes left the band in 2009. Vocalist Laura Jane Grace was in the final stages of her gender transition and welcomed her daughter Evelyn with visual artist Heather Hannoura on October 30, 2009. Working, again, with legendary producer Butch Vig (Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins), however, they delivered a classic, with songs like I Was A Teenage Anarchist among their biggest, while Because Of The Shame and Bamboo Bones are among their under-appreciated best.\n\nThe Gaslight Anthem’s third LP is an often overlooked gem. Having fallen between The ’59 Sound’s breakout blend of energy and nostalgia and the potent iconography of Handwritten, its lightness of touch (indicating, to a degree, the direction in which frontman Brian Fallon would head as a solo artist) has stubbornly endured. Attaching their punk soul to tunes that are slicker and often more defiantly upbeat, however – The Diamond Church Street Choir is a finger-clicking favourite while the heartwrought title-track tugs on all the right strings – American Slang remains one of the decade’s landmark U.S. rock records.\n\nThere is a lingering sense that Danger Days… is the poor relation to 2004’s Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge and 2006’s The Black Parade. Fair as that may be, it should not be overlooked. The fourth and final(?) My Chemical Romance LP saw the New Jersey punks ditching the darkness with which they had burst onto (then taken over) the scene in favour of a post-apocalyptic wasteland bathed in blinding light. Drawing on the psych-rock, power-pop and proto-punk of the ’60s and ’70s, tracks like Sing, The Kids From Yesterday and the brilliantly-titled Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na) saw the band bow out with a defiant grin.\n\nTen years after Hybrid Theory made them the biggest rock superstars of the millennium, Linkin Park took a daring creative gamble that proved their greatness beyond the broad-stroke luridity of nu-metal. That didn’t stop it being wildly divisive at the time, of course. A daring concept album grappling with the anxiety of a society piling into the unknown – technology, nuclear power, the tensions around political and sociological progress – this was a different band to the one who’d dropped the simple, crowd-pleasing Minutes To Midnight only three years previously. Hell, that the title expands on the imagery of the Doomsday Clock with a reference to Hindu sacred text the Bhagavad-Gita (as quoted by nuclear innovator Robert Oppenheimer) confirmed that before a note even dropped. Scaling back the rock instrumentation, ramping up the politics and allowing Mike Shinoda to come to the fore, there were justified comparisons with Public Enemy’s 1990 masterpiece Fear Of A Black Planet. Tracks like When They Come For Me, Waiting For The End and Wretches And Kings still feel hauntingly relevant today.\n\nBring Me The Horizon’s rapid evolution had already paid dividends in moving from the scattergun chaos of 2006’s Count Your Blessings to the more measured melodic metal of 2008’s Suicide Season. It was with their third LP, though, that they began to look like the arena-conquerors we know today. Still awaiting the arrival of electronic genius Jordan Fish, there was an occasional awkwardness in the collisions between tracks as biting as Alligator Blood and warped ballads like Blessed With A Curse, but the growing confidence in that experimentation meant that their ascendancy was almost assured. Some fans were quick to label them sellouts, but held up against the more pop direction of the last few years, bangers like It Never Ends absolutely slam.\n\nIt took a minute for the shockwave unelashed by letlive.’s explosive second album to register on the K! radar. Dropping on April 13, 2010 via North Carolinan indie imprint Tragic Hero, it wasn’t until the following year’s re-release on Epitaph that the Los Angelinos’ soulful art-punk/post-hardcore really bled into the UK consciousness, winning a rare belated-entry at Number Two on our 2011 end-of-year run-down. The record’s lightning-in-a-bottle power and poignancy has only grown over the decade since. The sound of a group of musicians – chief among them vocalist Jason Aalon Butler – who’d been toiling for eight years already on the City Of Angels’ gritty underground, there was a rare mix of pent-up combustibility and open vulnerability in songs like Casino Columbus and Muther that owed as much to Refused or Glassjaw as Prince or even Jason’s father’s band Aalon. There are (valid) arguments that the album’s front-loaded structure leaves it feeling unbalanced, and that the socio-political message at its heart has been more clearly espoused by Jason’s subsequent outfit FEVER 333, but along with the band’s incendiary live shows from the time, Fake History simply burned that much brighter and hotter than the majority of 2010 releases.\n\nDeftones’ intended sixth album – an experimental but relatively quick-fire follow-up to 2006’s Saturday Night Wrist tentatively titled Eros – was derailed by the cruel whims of fate. When bassist Chi Cheng was involved in a serious traffic accident in November 2008 and slipped into a coma, the band were thrown into personal and professional turmoil. The strange, dark music they had composed thus far, they realised, was no longer representative of where they were at as people and artists. Rapidly reconfiguring with new bassist (and old friend) Sergio Vega, the band headed into the studio for two months with renowned rock producer Nick Raskulinecz (who had a busy year…) and emerged with a more direct record that balances delicately between Carpe Diem positivity, elegiac reflection and subliminal turmoil. From the snarling, propellant likes of You’ve Seen The Butcher and Rocket Skates to the almost-celestial scope of Beauty School and the probing title-track, Diamond Eyes harked back to the immediacy of the Sacramento masters’ early releases while hinting at impossible new light flickering on the horizon."
