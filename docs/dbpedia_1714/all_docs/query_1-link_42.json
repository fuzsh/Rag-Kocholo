Kanye knows how to stir\n\nthings up with natural disaster-like\n\nefficiency, so it's hard to fathom\n\nhow his music can live up to the\n\nlarger-than-life personality behind\n\nit. Well, it does and it doesn't.\n\nTwisted Fantasy could very well\n\nbe the best thing Kanye has ever\n\ndone, and that's saying something,\n\nconsidering his body of work. Every\n\ntrack boils over with inspiration,\n\nand even though there are six dif-\n\nferent guests on every song, the\n\nalbum remains a distinctly indi-\n\nvidual statement. 'Ye spits verses\n\nalongside Jay-Z, Pusha T, Raekwon\n\nand Rick Ross, and trades hooks\n\nwith Rihanna, Fergie and John\n\nLegend. Yet it's ultimately the\n\nKanye show. Only Mr. West can go\n\ntoe-to-toe with such big names and\n\nemerge the most compelling figure.\n\nIt's not even close.\n\nBut, of course, it's all by design.\n\nYou can hear it in the grandiosity of\n\neach track: ideas piled upon ideas,\n\nthe concluding three minutes of\n\ndistorted, Auto-Tuned droning on\n\n\"Runaway,\" the \"Hey, why not tack\n\non one more verse?\" attitude. Every\n\ntrack is so transparently the result\n\nof Kanye trying to make the best\n\nsong of his career (and he just might\n\nhave succeeded with \"Runaway\").\n\nYou can almost hear him in his\n\nHawaiian studio: \"Yeah, this one's\n\nit, the hottest ever.\" But it's just so\n\nKanye of him to forget that there\n\ncan only be one best, that there's\n\njust no room on one album for 1\n\n\"Runaway\"s.\n\nHe's stubborn. You can't knock\n\nhim for trying, especially when he\n\ncame so damn close. Each track\n\ncould easily be your favorite Kanye\n\nsong, depending on the week, the\n\nday, the season. \"So Appalled\" is\n\nfurious, and the beat is more of a\n\nbattlefield than a drum track. Swizz\n\nBeatz's existential hook (\"Middle\n\nfinger in the air, if you don't really\n\ncare / It's like that sometimes, man,\n\nridiculous / Life can be sometimes\n\nridiculous\") is at first disconcert-\n\ning, then a novelty and then finally\n\nan indispensable mantra. \"Blame\n\nGame\" makes superb use of Aphex\n\nTwin's \"avril 14th\" for the album's\n\nclosest thing to a ballad, and \"Devil\n\nin a New Dress\" is just pure, soul-\n\nsampling Kanye demonstrating his\n\nmastery of the form.\n\nAs the title implies, the album is\n\nan attempt to exorcise some of the\n\ncreator's demons - or, if not to exor-\n\ncise, to speak in tongues for 13 tracks\n\nand get them to reveal some sort of\n\ntruth. Kanye knows he's a \"douche-\n\nbag,\" an \"asshole,\" a \"scumbag.\" He's\n\ntrying to be a better person; it's just\n\nthat he doesn't know how to replace\n\nhis vices with virtue. \"Hell of a Life\"\n\nTaken trom Kanye's \"Men in Black II\" audition.\n\nplays on the Dark Fantasy (or is it\n\nBeautiful?) of being married to a\n\nporn star. He raps, biting the hook\n\nfrom \"Iron Man,\" \"No more drugs\n\nfor me / Pussy and religion is all I\n\nneed.\" On \"Runaway,\" he says \"I\n\ncould have me a good girl /And still\n\nbe addicted to them hood rats /And\n\nI just blame everything on you / At\n\nleast you know that's what I'm good\n\nat.\" He can see the light, but he's not\n\nquite sure if he can get there. And\n\neven if he could, would he want to in\n\nthe first place?\n\nIn this way, Twisted Fantasy is\n\nmired in conflict. There's an apoca-\n\nlyptic exuberance running through-\n\nout the album, a self-destructive\n\ninstinct to celebrate the good life in\n\nthe face of the knowledge that it'll\n\neventually kill. It's embodied in the\n\nbald-faced excess that defines the\n\nalbum; the same overindulgence\n\nthat makes each track a soaring\n\nmusical statement also works to\n\nundermine its merit. Can we really\n\nbelieve that the album is a product\n\nof genuine artistic inspiration when\n\nit's so consciously designed to be\n\nbetter than anything else out there?\n\nOr, more important: Does it matter\n\nwhat the product's ends are when\n\nthe thing itself is this fucking good?\n\nBut, really, it's a hip-hop album.\n\nThe best of the year - maybe the\n\nbest of the last few. Questions of art\n\nand intention mean nothing when\n\nyou're singing along, for the 40th\n\ntime, \"And I always find / Yeah I\n\nalways find something wrong.\"\n\nBecause with Kanye, you can always\n\nfind something wrong. But where it\n\ntruly matters - lyrics, beats, origi-\n\nnality, humanity - there's so much\n\nright, and no one straddles the\n\ndivide as boldly as Kanye West.\n\n'Girl Talk's 'All Day' party\n\nshows, let alone actually be\n\nough to compete in them.\n\nI pressed on.

On All Day, Gillis res-\n\ncues long-forgotten songs from\n\nthe dark recesses of music history\n\nand mixes them with previously\n\nunlistenable pop and other, more\n\nrespected tracks. The result is a\n\nhodgepodge of genres and guilty\n\npleasures. And this is probably\n\nyour only chance to hear Willow\n\nSmith open for the Rolling Stones.\n\nThat should be all the incentive\n\nneeded.\n\nTo avoid the legal nightmare of\n\nattempting to sell an album that\n\nsamples an entire spectrum of\n\nother artists, Gillis sidestepped\n\nthe traditional album release and\n\nmade All Day available to down-\n\nload for free via his label's web-\n\nsite - aptly titled Illegal Art. As\n\na testament to Girl Talk's under-\n\nground popularity (the album\n\nwas released unannounced), mil-\n\nlions downloaded the album on\n\nthe first day. Although Gillis split\n\nthe album into separate tracks,\n\nthe label website instructs fans to\n\nlisten to the album in its entirety.\n\nAnd honestly, it would be impos-\n\nsible to completely break down\n\nthis album. On each track Gillis\n\nsamples from a large pool of art-\n\nists and masterfully mixes them\n\nuntil it is impossible to distinguish\n\nLil Jon from Arcade Fire.\n\nGirl Talk induces a unique gid-\n\ndiness. Album opener \"Oh No\"\n\nwill cause listeners to laugh at\n\nthe shock value and marvel at its\n\ninventiveness.
