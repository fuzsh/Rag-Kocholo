        "text": "On this day in KISSTORY - August 11th, 1999 - We were inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Family members, friends and fans stood by as the KISS star was unveiled at the intersection of LaBrea and Hollywood. We were also presented with commemorative plaques from Hollywood's honorary mayor Johnny Grant, who proclaimed it KISS Day. Paul told the hundreds of fans on hand, \"We wouldn't be here without you. This star is for you people. It has our name on it, but everyone of you is responsible for it.\"\n\nThe exact address of the KISS star is listed as 7080 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nOn this day in KISSTORY - August 10, 1973 - We rocked the Hotel Diplomat in New York City. Our future manager Bill Aucoin caught the show & the rest is KISSTORY!\n\nBill Aucoin: When I first saw KISS at the Hotel Diplomat in 1973 they didn't have much of a show. They had the red beacons, a couple of amps. They were wearing black jeans. No one could afford leather. The show was just a regular rock 'n' roll show except they had spontaneity. They wanted to do something different and they wanted it very badly. That kind of devotion is worth more than anything. It's so special and you start picking up on it. I saw that magic in them.\n\nThanks to Eric Webb for sharing his autographed KISS Solo album picture disc collection with us. AWESOME pieces of KISSTORY!\n\nShow us your holy grail KISS item, KISS ARMY.\n\nShow us at www.KISSOnline.com/Letters"
