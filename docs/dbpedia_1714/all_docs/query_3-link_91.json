        "text": "Throughout my teenage years and into my early 20’s, I could usually be found at festivals, arena events, record shops, conventions and music practice rooms in an effort to see, hear, meet and sound like KISS. Being present at their headlining performance at 2008’s Download festival and seeing them a couple of years later in Manchester during 2010’s Sonic Boom Over Europe Tour. I definitely got a chance to experience the full makeup clad, blood spitting, fire-breathing, band member flying, drum podium levitating, guitar smoking, firework exploding, rock n’ roll experience that is a KISS stage show.\n\nThe two core members, Gene Simmons & Paul Stanley were held together by the long standing KISS drummer Eric Singer and Ace Frehley sound-a-like Tommy Thayer, in an electrifying, high energy thrashing through of many of their greatest hits. 2008 was a rather KISS heavy festival in Donington. As well as the band headlining Friday’s main stage, appearing on one of the smaller stages, the next day, was Ace Frehley and his band. Having seen Ace previously at London’s Astoria he really caters for the seasoned KISS fans. As well as performing most of his KISS penned / sung numbers he also gives his rendition of classic tracks such as Love Gun, Deuce, Love Her All I Can, Black Diamond and Cold Gin. Interspersed with cuts from his solo albums and Frehley’s Comet material, his show is phenomenal.\n\nFinding myself located somewhere on the KISS Venn Diagram between ‘fan’ and ‘fanatic’, many hours of my youth were spent digesting their studio back catalogue, live albums, concert videos, compilations and bootlegs. My appreciation for the band had laid dormant for a number of years whilst other musical avenues were being explored. However, over the last few weeks, I have found myself revisiting albums daily, being reminded of the initial spark that triggered such an infatuation. Having been (virtually) KISSless for a number of years, I have been able to revisit and reassess their work. Admittedly, I do sit on the ‘fanboy’ bench of KISS listeners, but I feel, I am able to critique their work in a much more even handed fashion than my 16 year old self.\n\nFor this post, I’ll be chronologically discussing their albums, culminating in an overall KISS rating and a song to check out on each. (Where I can) I’ve avoided recommending their singles, hits or songs that feature regularly in their live repertoire, as, if you’ve come this far into the post, you’re probably already a KISS fan to some extent. Therefore I shan’t insult you by telling you that Detroit Rock City was a decent tune or that I Was Made for Loving You had a catchy hook. I’ve really plumed the depths, sought out the obscure and have (attempted to) select a song from each that will keep you Rocking and Rolling between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Also, from 7 a.m. onward, assist you in partying for the remainder of the day on a 24/7 looping cycle. As the lines are often blurred between official KISS releases, live albums, compilations and bootlegs, this is what I’ll be covering:\n\nAll of their studio albums to date. The four Alive! albums. MTV Unplugged and the two compilations Killers and Smashes, Thrashes & Hits, both of which contain new original material.\n\nWith rock n’ roll / folk origins, KISS developed a heavier tone, which musically expanded throughout the 1970’s. Over the decades the band have flirted with the pop, disco, prog (conceptual) rock, heavy metal, glam and grunge genres to name but a few. From an album of acoustic renditions to their expansion with a full symphony orchestra, in revisiting the material, I have concluded there is no such thing as a “KISS” album. Only an album made by KISS. Without any further a do may I present… The Hottest Band in the World……\n\nKISS (1974)\n\nSingles Released: Nothin’ To Lose, Kissin’ Time, Strutter\n\nThe bands debut album is quite frankly one of the finest debut releases in the history of rock music. Even seminal artists such as The Rolling Stones, Alice Cooper and AC/DC didn’t completely deliver the goods on their first go, and it took a few releases for them to really get into the swing of things. The album could quite simply be re-labeled as a greatest hits album, as featured tracks such as Deuce, Black Diamond, Cold Gin, Strutter and Firehouse have been regular anthems present in the bands live repertoire. Deuce often opening proceedings.\n\nIt is painful at how close the album is to being perfect. There is an elephant in the room. An elephant that turns up smack bang in the middle of the record, and unnecessarily halts all the feel-good, rock n’ roll splendor. The elephant is of course, track 6, Kissin’ Time. The most painful thing about the inclusion of this track, is that, for a very brief period, there was a version of KISS released that didn’t include it. After the album initially failed to sell, the record company felt a hit single would help boost sales, so a cover version of a 1959 pop hit was inserted. Kissin’ Time is the only reason, the album doesn’t achieve top marks from me.\n\nRecommended Track: 100,000 Years (Because of their larger than life personas, people often forget what great musicians the members of KISS are. Particularly Gene Simmons, as, over the years, he became the biggest “celebrity” in the band, it’s not often he’s thought of in terms of his bass playing ability. This is just one example of a bass line from Gene that’ll knock you out.)\n\nKISS Rating: 9.5/10\n\nHotter Than Hell (1974)\n\nSingles Released: Let Me Go, Rock N’ Roll\n\nA much darker album tonally than their debut, Hotter Than Hell features 3 tracks penned by Ace Frehley, Not confident with his own vocal abilities, the songs are handled by the other band members. The album contains another handful of KISS classics, that would often be performed live throughout their career such as Watchin’ You and Goin’ Blind.\n\nThe whole album has a unique and interesting sound to it due to the lackluster production. As unique as the sound is, it doesn’t seem to encapsulate the electricity and flamboyance of the band, and the murky fuzz surrounding the tracks seems to dampen the upbeat and energetic moments throughout the album. Despite it’s flaws in production, the songs are indestructibly excellent, and the weird sound achieved is strangely mesmerising.\n\nRecommended Track: Comin’ Home (It would be 22 years before this song, got the care, attention and recognition it deserved when performed as part of their MTV Unplugged session.)\n\nKISS Rating: 8/10\n\nDressed To Kill (1975)\n\nSingles Released: Rock and Roll All Nite, C’Mon and Love Me\n\nA much more lighthearted / feel good, party rocker of an album than it’s predecessor. Containing the bands most recognisable rock and roll mantra, and a couple of rehashes of Wicked Lester songs, Dressed To Kill is much more in the vein of their debut.\n\nAdmittedly the songs don’t quite hold up for me when compared to the first two albums. There are some definite highlights however. Ace Frehley’s hypnotic guitar intro to Rock Bottom and the crunchier reworking of Wicked Lester’s She. Dressed to Kill would be the last studio album in the KISS collection of their initial stripped down rock n’ roll sound, before they would evolve, within the studio, to create all manor of loud and lewd concentrated chaos.\n\nRecommended Track: Love Her All I Can (Another reworking of a song originally performed by Wicked Lester.)\n\nKISS Rating: 6/10\n\nAlive! (1975)\n\nSingles Released: Rock and Roll All Nite\n\nOne of the most explosive and electrifying live albums in the history of rock music. Alive! is a phenomenal showcasing of the best tracks from the bands first three albums, managing to segue into extended jams and furious drum and guitar solos.\n\nAlive! helps breath life into the compromised recordings on Hotter than Hell and tracks from their second album such as Parasite, Watchin’ You, Hotter than Hell, Got to Choose and Let Me Go, Rock N’ Roll explode off the record. In terms of sales, Alive! was something of a phenomenon in comparison to the bands previous three albums and opened the doors to everything that would unfold for them over the next 40 years.\n\nRecommended Track: She (I’ve gone for this track based on the extended jam that the song descends into. Expanding on the jam from their first album following Let Me Know, the melodic duel guitar riffs would become something of a trademark throughout their 70’s stage shows.)\n\nKISS Rating: 10/10\n\nDestroyer (1976)\n\nSingles Released: Shout it Out Loud, Flaming Youth, Detroit Rock City, Beth\n\nProducer Bob Ezrin’s first collaboration with KISS was in the form of Destroyer. An album that churned out stadium anthems like they were going out of fashion. Expanding the bands sound to include string sections, choirs, sound effects and innovative recording techniques, the new KISS sound coincided with their newly developed fame and arena filling potential.\n\nThe album as a whole is excellent, if not slightly overwhelming. I must say I prefer the dirtier more raw sounding material from their first three albums, but Destroyer definitely was the beginning of the new era of KISS that elevated them from being a rock band to becoming rock Gods. With over a third of the album being released as singles and another third being God of Thunder, Do You Love Me and King of the Night Time World there really aren’t many obscure tracks to choose from to recommend. Never the less:\n\nRecommended Track: Great Expectations (Along with Beth, probably the biggest musical deviation from their usual guitar driven rock sound.)\n\nKISS Rating: 7/10\n\nRock and Roll Over (1976)\n\nSingles Released: Hard Luck Woman, Calling Dr. Love\n\nAfter the dizzying heights the band reached with Destroyer, their response was a choppy, back to basics rock n’ roll album. Casting aside session musicians the core members provided all the instrumentation and kept it minimal. From Paul’s opening broken chord on I Want You to Gene’s gruff delivery of Calling Dr. Love to Ace’s incredible solo on Love Em’ and Leave Em’, to Peter’s charming vocal work on Hard Luck Woman. The album romps along at a staggering pace without giving the listener time to pause for breath.\n\nThe song’s aren’t quite as memorable as any that feature on Destroyer but, for a band who have just gained prominence for expanding their sound, for them to produce a stripped down rock n’ roll album was the perfect response. Also, this has to be the greatest album cover in their collection.\n\nRecommended Track: Makin’ Love (Sharing similarities musically with Aerosmith’s Toys in the Attic from 12 months earlier, and along with Stanley’s opening I Want You, Makin’ Love bookends the album brilliantly.)\n\nKISS Rating: 8/10\n\nLove Gun (1977)\n\nSingles Released: Christine Sixteen, Love Gun\n\nBeing very much the sister album to Rock and Roll Over KISS continued, musically, in the same direction. I feel, of the two, Love Gun is the superior record. Stanley’s opener, I Stole Your Love hits you like a wrecking ball as it explodes off the turntable, and has to be the most forceful album opener KISS have ever released. Love Gun also showcases Ace Frehley’s first vocal outing on, arguably his finest KISS track Shock Me. Gene’s Plaster Caster is one of his finest, and the title track would become a KISS standard, featuring in their live sets for many decades to come.\n\nWhereas I feel Rock and Roll Over is a better album as a whole (all the tracks are consistently good), and despite Love Gun’s low points (the Peter Criss lead Hooligan and their cover of Then SHE Kissed Me), for my money Love Gun contains some of the bands finest work and, after the debut album is the second finest record, the original line up have produced.\n\nRecommended Track: Almost Human (A 60’s psychedelia infused Gene Simmons groove rocker that leads nicely into Plaster Caster)\n\nKISS Rating: 9/10\n\nAlive II (1977)\n\nSingles Released: Shout It Out Loud, Rocket Ride\n\nUtilising the original winning formula of 75’s Alive!, Alive II showcases cuts from Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over & Love Gun, as well as containing five new studio tracks. The bigger KISS sound that began to develop with Destroyer is apparent, and it’s clear to tell that the KISS live experience has definitely evolved from a ‘concert’ into a ‘show’.\n\nThe set list is great and all the tracks flow seamlessly into one another. It doesn’t quite have the intimacy Alive! had, but it is a fabulous document of the live KISS experience at the peak of their career. Aside from Frehley’s Rocket Ride, which is one of the greatest songs he’s ever recorded, the original tracks are generally quite forgettable and disposable. Despite this, they do contain some stellar guitar work from (brother of Bruce) Bob Kulick, friend of the band ad frequent collaborator.\n\nRecommended Track: All American Man (The best non-Frehley, new song on the record. A hard and heavy guitar lead Stanley number with an indestructible melody and some damn fine guitar work from Bob Kulick.)\n\nKISS Rating: 7/10\n\nGene Simmons (1978)\n\nSingles Released: Radioactive\n\nSimultaneously released with Ace, Paul and Peter’s solo albums Gene’s was perhaps the most diverse. I can only imagine the session musicians turned up to the studio in a clown car. With 27 musicians credited as well as a college choir, the album is musically all over the place.\n\nFrom classic rockers, to acoustic ballads, to a reworking of the KISS song See You in Your Dreams, to a cover of Disney’s When You Wish Upon a Star, the album feels like it could fall off the rails and descend into the abyss of the bizarre and un-listenable at any point. However, it never does. On paper, it shouldn’t work at all, but the result is weirdly superb.\n\nHaving always championed Paul’s solo album (then latterly Ace’s), when revisiting the four, Gene’s definitely stands out as the head of the pack. Whereas Paul’s is the safest (most KISS like) release, Ace’s is the most personally expansive, Gene’s, with wonderfully constructed songs such as See You Tonite, Radioactive and True Confessions is definitely the most colourful.\n\nRecommended Track: Burning Up With Fever (Opening with a strangely, unexplained, off key, broken guitar chord, the song kicks in with unexpected funk & soul infusions and romps it’s way through four minutes, ticking off the various genres it’s referencing on the way.)\n\nKISS Rating: 8/10\n\nAce Frehley (1978)\n\nSingles Released: New York Groove\n\nAfter Shock Me and Rocket Ride, fans were itching for more Ace. Ace Frehley is often haled as the finest of the solo projects, and is the perfect collection of pure, uncompromised Frehley. Along with (latterly Frehley’s Comet) drummer Anton Fig, Ace played the majority of instruments, and co-produced the album.\n\nWith songs such as Snow Blind and Rip It Out, Ace’s contribution was the heaviest of the four albums by far, and was fueled with his signature guitar sound. The haunting Fractured Mirror became the first in a series of instrumentals Frehley would release, including Fractured Too on 1987’s Frehley’s Comet, Fractured III on 1989’s Trouble Walkin’ and Fractured Quantum on 2009’s Anomaly.\n\nRecommended Track: I’m in Need of Love (The album as a whole is solid and this track is the perfect example of Frehley’s signature guitar sound working it’s magic.)\n\nKISS Rating: 8/10\n\nPeter Criss (1978)\n\nSingles Released: Don’t You Let Me Down, You Matter To Me\n\nThe softest and most family friendly of the solo albums. Peter Criss was a collection of inoffensive soft rock numbers. With producer Vini Poncia, Criss crooned his way through a combination of pop covers and originals, embracing his swing / big band roots.\n\nGiving the audience a different flavour completely as to what the seasoned KISS fan had come to expect. Peter’s voice is perfectly suited to the numbers, but as a whole, the album is generally uneventful.\n\nRecommended Track: Kiss The Girl Goodbye (One of the highlights on the album, with some fabulous acoustic guitar work. This folk infused ballad lends itself to Peter’s vocal styling perfectly.)\n\nKISS Rating: 5/10\n\nPaul Stanley (1978)\n\nSingles Released: Hold Me, Touch Me (Think of Me When We’re Apart)\n\nTeaming up once again with guitarist Bob Kulick, Stanley produced a very fine collection of hard rock originals. Paul being the only member of the group who’s album featured purely original tracks. It has the finest opening number of the four. Tonight You Belong To Me teases the listener in with a mystical intro leading into one of the best riffs in the KISS back catalogue.\n\nWouldn’t You Like To Know Me encapsulates the greatest Paul Stanley style of song writing, with it’s uptempo, heavy, yet pop, sensibilities and watertight vocal melody. The album is much more in the vein of previous KISS works, but with a more matured style of writing from Stanley. It is clear from this album, why Paul Stanley would be, almost single-handedly, the creative driving force behind KISS for most of the 1980’s.\n\nRecommended Track: Ain’t Quite Right (a bluesy rocker that slows the album down to a contemplative groove after the explosive opening.)\n\nKISS Rating: 8/10\n\nDynasty (1979)\n\nSingles Released: I Was Made for Loving You, Sure Know Something\n\nA rather divisive album in the KISS collection. Due to it’s pop / disco influences, a lot of fans were turned off by it’s softer more mainstream appeal. It was definitely the beginning of the end in terms of the original lineup disbanding. Having Anton Fig come in on the Dynasty sessions to replace Peter’s “substandard” drumming, Criss is only featured on one track, Dirty Livin’.\n\nContrasting with Paul Stanley’s disco infused I Was Made for Loving, Sure Know Something & Magic Touch, was Ace Frehley’s uncompromisingly hard rocking Hard Times, Save Your Love and his version of the relatively obscure Rolling Stones track 2000 Man.\n\nThe whole album is a bit of a mishmash of themes, musical styles and ideas, however… I love it. I think the bands flamboyance within the rock genre lends itself perfectly to pop. Whereas the new KISS sound differed from their previously heavier albums, Dynasty as a whole works. Of all the genres KISS have flirted with over the years, this is definitely one of the highlights.\n\nRecommended Track: Dirty Livin’ (Peter’s last contribution to a KISS album for 19 years.)\n\nKISS Rating: 9/10\n\nUnmasked (1980)\n\nSingles Released: Shandi, Talk to Me, Tomorrow\n\nMonopolising on the success of Dynasty KISS responded with an even more pop infused record with nearly all the songs co-written by producer Vini Poncia.\n\nSimilarly to Dynasty the album featured drummer Anton Fig and three songs lead by Ace Frehley. For my liking the album was a bit too overly polished, and didn’t have the rough edges of Dynasty making many of the tracks instantly forgettable.\n\nThere are a couple of definite highlights, but aside from the singles Talk to Me and Shandi, the album isn’t their finest work.\n\nRecommended Track: Is That You? (Setting tone for the entire record, the opening track showcases Paul’s falsetto vocal superbly. Whereas the song wasn’t written by anyone in the band, the slick production and infectious melody make it stand out against the other album tracks.)\n\nKISS Rating: 5/10\n\nMusic From “The Elder” (1981)\n\nSingles Released: A World Without Heroes, I, The Oath\n\nIf you could class the bands trans-formative disco period as divisive between fans, nothing in the whole of KISStory has isolated fans as much as Music From The Elder. Almost universally panned by fans and critics, the conceptual album is an experimental, progressive rock collection of songs featuring orchestral arrangements, choirs and a story ark linking the tracks together.\n\nThe album would mark the debut for KISS drummer Eric Carr, replacing Peter Criss and the departure of Ace Frehley. The Elder would be the last studio album to feature Frehley until 1998’s Psycho Circus.\n\nKnowing very little about KISS until 1999’s stoner comedy Detroit Rock City, Music From the Elder was the first full studio album I was exposed to. The reason this blog exists probably suggests to you that the album more than resonated with me.\n\nHaving originally heard The Elder on CD in 1997’s remastered version, the order of the tracks differs from it’s original vinyl release. Both versions work, but I feel 97’s re-ordering of the songs makes the album flow a lot more smoothly and coherently.\n\nBecoming something of a cult classic after it’s initial release, I can’t fault a single note on the record.\n\nRecommended Track: Only You (Along with A World Without Heroes, Gene takes a softer vocal approach on a number of tracks and it works very well in this conceptual context.)\n\nKISS Rating: 10/10\n\nKillers (1982)\n\nSingles Released: –\n\nDespite his presence on the album cover, Ace Frehley wasn’t involved in the production of this greatest hits compilation. Alongside a collection of KISS standards, there were four new recordings, featuring Bob Kulick on lead guitar. There were co-writing credits from a number of songwriters including Bryan Adams.\n\nThe album was released in response to The Elders commercial failure and the new compositions are much more in the vein of their earlier / heavier work.\n\nThe new songs are very enjoyable but sit slightly awkwardly next to the classic songs. Due to the difference in the current lineup (musically) and the production.\n\nIt’s clear to tell that the album was cobbled together as quickly as possible, in an attempt to erase the damage The Elder had inflicted.\n\nRecommended Track: Nowhere To Run (I am extremely biased when it comes to any of Bob Kulick’s work. Having met him at a KISS convention and realising he is the nicest man in the world ever, he can do no wrong. This really is a spectacular KISS song though. Not often referenced, due to Killers not spawning singles, the record would never be haled as a memorable KISS album.\n\nKISS Rating: 6/10\n\nCreatures of the Night (1982)\n\nSingles Released: I Love It Loud, Killer, Creatures of the Night\n\nIn Ace Frehley’s absence (from everything but the album cover), a culmination of guitarists helped fill in the gaps on various tracks. Such as (nice guy) Bob Kulick, Jimmy Haslip, Mr Mister’s Steve Farris, Robben Ford and (soon to be full time member) Vinnie Vincent.\n\nIt was, by far, the heaviest album KISS had ever produced. With dark lyrical content, wailing solos, pounding drums and rib-breaking riffs, Creatures of the Night seemed to be the complete antithesis of Unmasked.\n\nAgain, teaming up with Bryan Adams (with co-writing credits on 2 numbers) KISS also utilised Vinnie Vincent’s song writing potential, and he is a credited contributor on a third of the album.\n\nCreatures is a fantastic album, and despite the absence of a permanent guitarist, feels like a unified collaborative project whereby everyone is on the same page about the musical direction and production of the record.\n\nRecommended Track: Saint and Sinner (The album contains some of Gene Simmons’ finest works such as he appears to take the lead on this project. Penning and singing the majority of songs on the album, along with I Love it Loud, War Machine, Killer and Rock N’ Roll Hell, Saint and Sinner is a thumping, hard & heavy anthem that Gene lends his signature vocals to excellently.\n\nKISS Rating: 9/10\n\nLick It Up (1983)\n\nSingles Released: Lick it Up, All Hell’s Breakin’ Loose\n\nA seminal moment in KISStory saw the band shedding their makeup and appearing clean faced, publicly against a plain white background.\n\nLick it Up would also be the first (and last) album to credit Vinnie Vincent as a full member of the band. In the same vein as Creatures, KISS had produced another hard and heavy rock album, with nearly all of the songs co-written with Vincent.\n\nDiffering from Frehley’s signature rock n’ roll style of guitar playing, Vinnie Vincent was a much faster and harder player. With shredded solos and guitar sound more reminiscent of the 1980’s Hard Rock / Glam Metal scene that was developing, KISS had reinvented both their image and their sound.\n\nLick it Up is definitely one of the highlights of the band’s post-makeup releases. The title track alone is one of their best singles of the 80’s and a regular addition to the live set.\n\nRecommended Track: Young and Wasted (A heavy, guitar driven rocker sung by Gene is one of the albums highlights. The song would later be lead (vocally) by Eric Carr during the Animalize live tour and was one of the rare occasions in which the fans were treated to Carr’s singing.)\n\nKISS Rating: 6/10\n\nAnimalize (1984)\n\nSingles: Heaven’s on Fire, Thrills in the Night\n\nAfter Vinnie Vincent’s brief stint and quick departure from the band, guitarist Mark St. John was brought aboard. Compared, by Paul Stanley in KISS X-Treme Close Up, to Pope John Paul I, who was named Pope in 1978 then died 33 days later, Mark St. John, due to illness was forced to leave the band mid-tour and was subsequently replaced by Bruce Kulick.\n\nWith Gene Simmons’ loyalties straying from KISS, as he began perusing a questionable acting career, creative control fell to Paul Stanley. Continuing in the glam metal genre, the album as a whole was lacking the general quality of Lick it Up.\n\nAside from the two singles, there isn’t too much on Animalize to get excited about, and out of their 1980’s releases it’s my least favourite album.\n\nRecommended Track: Under the Gun (Of the album tracks, this one is a standout favourite for me.)\n\nKISS Rating: 5/10\n\nAsylum (1985)\n\nSingles Released: Tears are Falling\n\nGenerally panned as the worst KISS album cover in their collection, I actually quite like the Asylum sleeve. By this album, the band had descended further into the glam genre. With more vibrant costumes and more pop infused numbers, KISS, in comparison to their two previously heavier “unmasked” records, were becoming a more mainstream outfit. Their mainstream appeal would peak before the end of the decade with their next two releases.\n\nIncluding Bruce Kulick in the credits and on the cover signified his arrival as the fourth official lead guitarist in KISS. The lineup of Stanley, Simmons, Carr and Kulick would continue on until the beginning of the 1990s until Carr’s death in 91′. Kulick would then go on to contribute to the next 5 studio albums.\n\nI really like Asylum as part of the non-makeup era back catalogue. I much prefer the musical direction, and the more lighthearted numbers such as Uh! All Night and Who Wants to be Lonely. Bruce Kulick’s personality as lead guitarist seems to be much more suited to the band and Asylum feels like a much more well rounded album than it’s predecessor.\n\nRecommended Track: King of the Mountain (An explosive opening track lead by Eric Carr’s pounding drums, and carried by Paul’s powerful vocals.)\n\nKISS Rating: 7/10\n\nCrazy Nights (1987)\n\nSingles Released: Crazy Crazy Nights, Reason to Live, Turn On the Night\n\nIn an effort to generate more mainstream success, an outside producer, Ron Nevison, was brought in to help develop a more commercially accessible album. Softening the band’s hard rock sound further, the inclusion of power ballads, keyboards and additional collaborations with ‘hit-maker’ Desmond Child were the key ingredients to the success of Crazy Nights. The record became the bands best selling album of the 1980’s and the lead single Crazy Crazy Nights charted in 5 countries. For the first time in their career KISS had penetrated the UK Top 10 singles chart, reaching number 4 with Crazy Crazy Nights.\n\nI think the album is great. It is, admittedly, quite a departure from the heavier, more metal driven Lick it Up and Animalize, and shares similarities with other pop-rock artists of the time such as Bon Jovi. Despite the fact it differs from their previous albums in the ‘unmasked’ era, I feel the softer more pop oriented KISS sound works perfectly well and definitely suits the bands style of song-writing. The melodies on the 3 lead singles alone are undeniably infectious. Continuing with Gene’s wavering interest in the group, the album is very much a Paul Stanley project, as he takes lead on 7 of the 11 tracks. Along side the singles, I Would Fight Hell to Hold You and My Way are definite highlights from him.\n\nAs a band who have never worried about taking themselves too seriously, Crazy Nights is a light and unbelievably fun record, that is remarkably easy to digest, containing a full track-list of potential hits.\n\nRecommended Track: No, No, No (Conceived by a guitar lick from Bruce Kulick and adapted by Kulick & Eric Carr, No, No, No was the b-side to the Crazy Crazy Nights single. One of the heavier moments on the album, the song is a superb guitar lead rocker and, vocally, the best contribution to the album from Gene Simmons.)\n\nKISS Rating: 8/10\n\nSmashes, Thrashes & Hits (1988)\n\nSingles Released: Let’s Put the X in Sex, (You Make Me) Rock Hard\n\nA greatest hits record featuring re-mixes and re-recorded renditions of the bands best love songs, including the two new singles. It’s incredibly hard to release a single KISS greatest hits album. Having released over 40 singles since their first album, and differing stylistically over their 14 year tenure, due to band member / lineup changes, production techniques and the popular music scene of the time, a concise, coherent greatest hits record, is always going to be tricky. When held up alongside one another Strutter and Tears are Falling sound worlds apart.\n\nThe new singles, musically, are reminiscent of the Crazy Nights sessions and perfectly enjoyable.\n\nRecommended Track: Beth (The main reason to seek out this album, would be for Eric Carr’s rendition of the Peter Criss classic. It is very rare to find an Eric Carr lead song in the KISS back catalogue, which is staggering when you consider how fantastic his voice is.)\n\nKISS Rating: 6/10\n\nHot in the Shade (1989)\n\nSingles Released: Hide Your Heart, Forever, Rise to It\n\nThe 15 track 15th studio release from KISS was the final album to (fully) feature the dominant 80’s line up of Stanley, Simmons, Kulick & Carr. Keeping in check with Crazy Night’s success, the album contained the radio friendly hits Hide Your Heart and, Michael Bolton co-written, power ballad Forever.\n\nBecoming much more involved with the project, following his acting hiatus, Gene Simmons’ contributes 7 hard rocking numbers, featuring a few co-written with Tommy Thayer (who enters the picture a couple of decades down the line).\n\nIt’s the longest KISS album to date in terms of tracklist and run time, and because of this unfortunately a few songs could be considered as filler and the whole album is slightly overwhelming.\n\nRecommended Track: Little Caesar (Eric Carr’s first and final vocally lead original track on a KISS record. Firstly the song is superb and is easily the best on the album. The riff is heavy yet melodic and Carr’s vocals were perfectly crafted to carry any rock anthem you could throw at him.)\n\nKISS Rating: 6/10\n\nRevenge (1992)\n\nSingles Released: God Gave Rock N’ Roll To You II, Unholy, Domino, I Just Wanna, Every Time I Look You\n\nAfter the tragic passing of Eric Carr, drummer Eric Singer was initiated into the group and featured on their first 1990’s studio release. Reunited with producer Bob Ezrin, Revenge was much darker in tone than the last few KISS albums. With Gene Simmons creatively fully back on board, Revenge had all the ingredients of a seminal KISS release. For me, the most interesting KISS projects display a duality between Stanley’s flamboyant and melodic numbers and Simmons’ darker / heavier tracks. This is evident throughout the record, and Gene’s hard rocking Unholy is one of his finest songs to date (being the first Gene lead KISS single to be released in 10 years).\n\nPaul’s playful I Just Wanna and Take it Off are instant KISS classics, and, with the album dedicated to Eric Carr, the closing Carr Jam 1981 is a loving tribute to Eric, showcasing his talent on the skins.\n\nRevenge is definitely a breath of fresh air in the KISS collection and blows away any negative feelings certain fans may have had towards them during their 1980’s period. Eric Singer proving integral to the heavier 90’s grunge infused sound, would be an essential element in the 90’s KISS ensemble.\n\nRecommended Track: Spit (The perfect amalgamation of the Simmons / Stanley styling. Co-written and co-sung by the front men, Spit is one of the high points of the album.)\n\nKISS Rating: 9/10\n\nAlive III (1993)\n\nSingles Released: I Love it Loud\n\nProbably the most intriguing of the Alive series. Alive III is an interesting listen. It’s interesting in the sense that, it’s the brand new lineup performing songs that date back to KISS’s first album, up to the latest release, with everything in between. It really works for me as a live collection and it’s great to here the different takes on certain songs. Bruce Kulick in particular puts his stamp on songs that originally featured Ace Frehley, Vinnie Vincent and Mark St. John. Along with Eric Singer’s reliably heavy drumming, Alive 3 is a wonderful showcasing of some great song choices from KISStory, performed expertly, by their newly established lineup.\n\nOther treats included on the CD release of Alive 3 is a fold out KISS timeline covering the history of the band and all of it’s members.\n\nRecommended Track: Lick it Up (It’s clear to see why this track has remained a regular in a KISS live set since it’s release. The live version of Lick it Up is always a pleasure, no matter what the context and always allows for extended jams and solos.)\n\nKISS Rating: 7/10\n\nMTV Unplugged (1996)\n\nSingles Released: Rock and Roll All Nite\n\nHopping onto the bandwagon of the MTV Unplugged series, in 1996, KISS threw in their two pennies worth. Previous artists who’d dabbled with the medium in the 90’s were Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and most famously Nirvana. By this point, most KISS fans were aware that the group, generally don’t have any qualms about following trends or experimenting in different genres.\n\nWhat could have been a thrown together, bodge job, cash in, shameless promotion of their latest material was in fact the complete opposite. Firstly, the song choice was absolutely sublime. Naturally, a number of KISS tracks translate to acoustic guitars better than others, and songs such as Every Time I Look at You and Goin’ Blind were a dead cert to be included. However, KISS really dove into the depths of their back catalogue and pulled out some wonderfully obscure album tracks and rarities that worked remarkably well in this context. Opening with a little known / rarely (if ever) performed album track from their second album was only the beginning. We’d here renditions of a previously forgotten track from Gene’s 1978 solo album. Songs from Dynasty, The Elder, Creatures, Destroyer, Love Gun, Revenge and Dressed to Kill would all turn up. Each one better than the last.\n\nThe date of the recording August 9th 1995, would prove to be very important in the KISS timeline, as joining Paul and Gene, onstage for the first time in over a decade were both Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, which descended into a full blown jamming session with Eric and Bruce. This would be the seed that blossomed into the KISS reunion, resulting in a new studio album and a world tour.\n\nRecommended Track: See You Tonite (A really interesting song choice from Gene’s 78′ solo album. Presumably never performed live by the band, the song is definitely one of the highlights of an all around superb set.)\n\nKISS Rating: 10/10\n\nCarnival of Souls: The Final Sessions (1997)\n\nSingles Released: Jungle\n\nThe last full KISS album to feature Bruce Kulick is an interesting listen. Not widely referenced in KISStory, a lot of the material further embraced elements of the grunge scene that was popular in rock music at the time. Whereas disco KISS, pop KISS, metal KISS, acoustic KISS and prog-rock KISS generally worked rather well and produced some interesting results. I have to say, grunge KISS wasn’t a particularly successful venture.\n\nThe songs seem a bit forced to be heavier and grungey than they were originally intended, purely to satisfy the genre demands, and the lyrics don’t carry the weight or intellect of the subjects, they’re attempting to address.\n\nIt’s not completely without charm however, and naturally there are some interesting moments, but it’s a shame this project was Kulick’s last outing with the group after such an amazing run beginning with Asylum 13 years earlier.\n\nRecommended Track: I Walk Alone (Bruce’s Kulick’s one and only turn as lead vocalist on a KISS track. The song deserves recognition purely on that basis.)\n\nKISS Rating: 5/10\n\nPsycho Circus (1998)\n\nSingles Released: Psycho Circus, We Are One, I Finally Found My Way, You Wanted the Best\n\nFollowing the record breaking world tour, the original lineup were back together in full makeup.\n\nWell, for the purpose of the front cover, the original lineup were back together. In reality Peter Criss was only featured drumming on 1 track and Ace only played on 3. Without credits Bruce Kulick, Tommy Thayer, Bob Ezrin and drummer Kevin Valentine were left to fill in the gaps.\n\nMusically different from any of the band’s 80’s / 90’s releases, Psycho Circus was a throwback to the stadium filling, anthem based rock that brought the band to prominence in the mid 70’s.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from the title track and Frehley’s Into the Void, there really isn’t much on the record to write home about. It feels like KISS were desperately trying to recreate Destroyer in the 1990’s. The majority of tracks, feel like they’re written by a KISS tribute band that couldn’t get the performing rights to play actual KISS numbers, so had to formulaically concoct similar songs in the style of KISS.\n\nRecommended Track: Into the Void (Despite the lackluster album from which it comes, Ace Frehley just proves that, left to his own devices, he can maintain a superb level of songwriting.)\n\nKISS Rating: 5/10\n\nKISS Symphony: Alive IV (2003)\n\nSingles Released: –\n\nTeaming up with Melbourne’s Symphony Orchestra, KISS fused many of their much loved classics into a rock / classical extravaganza. With Ace Frehley having long since departed, Gene, Paul and Peter were joined by, long time collaborator, Tommy Thayer. Having donned Ace’s makeup, this would be the first instance, a new band member would adopt an already existing onstage persona.\n\nThe album teases the audience in, beginning with 6 opening tracks of pure KISS. Act 2 introduces the small Melbourne Symphony Ensemble backing the band, before an interval, after which, KISS would return to the stage to perform in front of the full orchestra.\n\nThe melding of the genres doesn’t work quite as successfully as it has in the past for different artists. Metallica’s S&M from 1999 being the high water-mark.\n\nSome of the tracks suit orchestral arrangements very well whilst others feel forced and unnecessary. The arrangements don’t seem to be as experimental or intricate as Metallica’s as, on a whole they purely follow the melody of the song, doing nothing other than enhancing the sound.\n\nIt was an admirable experiment, but despite collaborating with one of the most prestigious orchestras on the planet, the whole album is a tad dull.\n\nRecommended Track: Black Diamond. (An example of one of the tracks that benefits from orchestral backing. Plus it’s fantastic to hear Peter’s vocals on a live album again.)\n\nKISS Rating: 6/10\n\nSonic Boom (2009)\n\nSingles Released: Modern Day Delilah, Say Yeah, Never Enough\n\nWith the reliably excellent Eric Singer back on the drum stool, KISS kept their makeup on for their first studio release as Simmons, Stanley, Singer & Thayer.\n\nRevisiting their rock and roll roots, not only in the cover design, again collaborating with Rock and Roll Over artist Michael Doret, the band disregarded any other gimmicky, cash in, experimental mediums and knocked out a stripped down, no nonsense, hard rocking album.\n\nI must say, I like this album a lot. Not quite as memorable or seminal as the bands early work, but with an opening track like Modern Day Delilah, KISS grab you by the balls instantly, and don’t let up.\n\nTommy Thayer takes the lead on When the Lightning Strikes displaying great vocal talents, and whereas his style of guitar playing is clearly influenced by Ace Frehley, he puts his own stamp on the album, and is one of the main reasons KISS were able to achieve the raw, rocking 70’s inspired sound that differs from any studio release over the last 3 decades.\n\nRecommended Track: I’m an Animal (That riff. I mean…. That riff!)\n\nKISS Rating: 7/10\n\nMonster (2012)\n\nSingles Released: Hell or Hallelujah, Long Way Down\n\nContinuing in the style of Sonic Boom, Monster is a continuation of the latest KISS lineup and production team, compiling another hard rocking release. The album maintains the song quality throughout and again gives Thayer an outing on lead vocals on the brilliant Outta this World.\n\nThe only thing the album lacks, in comparison to it’s sister album, is a good cover. I mean, seriously. What’s the deal with the cover? When, only three years earlier, KISS had reenlisted the help of the artist responsible for perhaps their greatest and most iconic album sleeve of all time, they follow with this.\n\nIt looks like a bootlegged re-edit of a stock photo, pinched from the KISS website with some tacky font plastered over it. Obviously you can’t judge the album by it’s cover, but for those fans who hold Asylum up for crimes against taste. They need to seriously rethink their position.\n\nAgain, similarly to Sonic Boom the album shows the band at their best, producing fast, hard and heavy rock music. With no outside input to distract them I hope the band can stay on this path, at least for a few more albums. Whereas KISS albums from the 1980’s / 1990’s very much reflected what was going on around them in the music scene of the time. There will always be something timeless about 4 blokes banging the shit out of some instruments together.\n\nRecommended Track: All for the Love of Rock & Roll (Eric Singer’s first studio released vocally lead track. After filling in on the Peter Criss numbers live, Singer’s proved to have a perfectly well formed rock vocal, and this song, co-written by him and Paul Stanley is a fantastic listen.)\n\nKISS Rating: 7/10\n\nWell, there’s my musings on a whole heap o’ KISS. I could carry on wittering throughout a whole section of honorable mentions dedicated to Frehley’s Comet, Vinnie Vincent Invasion, Bruce Kulick’s Transformer, Eric Carr’s Rockology, Paul Stanley’s Live to Win etc etc etc etc. But for now… I need a cold gin."
