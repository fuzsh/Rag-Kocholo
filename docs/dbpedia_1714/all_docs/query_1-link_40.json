        "text": "From Undercover.com.au\n\nby Paul Cashmere - September 21 2010\n\nThe Neil Diamond album will be a collection of his favourite songs from other artists.\n\nNeil Diamond has covered The Beatles, Eagles, Bill Withers, Leonard Cohen and Leon Russell, to name a few, on the album ‘Dreams’.\n\n“You never know how long you’ve got and a lot of these songs have been waiting for me to record them for 40 years”, Diamonds said in a statement.\n\nThe album also features songs by Gilbert O’Sullivan (Alone Again Naturally), Harry Nilsson (Don’t Forget Me) and Randy Newman (Feels Like Home).\n\nNeil has also covered one of his own songs again, ‘I’m A Believer’. He wrote the song and gave it to The Monkees in 1966 but used it as an album track on his Shilo album in 1970.\n\nSony will released ‘Dreams’ on 2 November 2010.\n\nThe tracklisting is:\n\n1. Ain't No Sunshine\n\n2. Blackbird\n\n3. Alone Again (Naturally)\n\n4. Feels Like Home\n\n5. Midnight Train To Georgia\n\n6. I'm A Believer\n\n7. Love Song\n\n8. Losing You\n\n9. Hallelujah\n\n10. A Song For You\n\n11. Yesterday\n\n12. Let It Be Me\n\n13. Desperado\n\n14. Don't Forget Me\n\nListen to 3 songs here:\n\nhttp://www.neildiamond.com/player_v2.php\n\nI am a long time fan of the man, but he is way off track this time around. First, he covers one of all-time favorite songs, \"Alone Again (Naturally)\". Instead of bringing the super sad lyrics to a different depth, he instead attempts to sing the lyric to the tempo that he has chosen. \"Alone Again\" is not just a song, those lyrics really hold a LOT of weight and should be delivered that way. Gilbert O'Sullivan's original was put to an almost happy tempo, but when he sang the lyric, you could feel his deep emotions. Now, on the other hand, his newest self cover of \"I'm A Believer\" (isn't this at least his third self cover of this one?), he finally finds his own lyric and gives it a proper reading.\n\nNeil has slowly lost me ever since his \"Tennessee Moon\" album, so I think that I can safely say, that I hung in there a lot longer than most Neil fans? He just doesn't hold up for me anymore and that is a shame, because the guy really does have talent. Sadly, he just doesn't have the great tunes anymore and no, in case if you're wondering, I did NOT like the Rick Rubin stuff at all, as it all seemed a bit too pretentious to me.\n\nChris C\n\nCovers albums are not new for him - he did an album of oldies in the 90's called \"Up on the Roof\" that was not too good. Half of the September Morn album was covers, again, not too good. I really do like the covers he did when he was with Uni (Suzanne, If You Go Away, Mr. Bojangles, Until It's Time For You To Go, Both Sides Now, etc....)\n\nNot sure what to think of the three samples - sounds depressing. I was just playing Home Before Dark yesterday - I think it's one of his best albums, and I have them all.\n\nNot to nitpick, but the above notes by Paul Cashmere are incorrect regarding \"I'm A Believer\". True, it was given to the Monkees, but Neil did not \"use it for his Shilo album in 1970\". He had nothing to do with that album, which was a compilation put together by Bang three years after he left them. His recording first appeared on his second Bang album, \"Just For You\" in 1967. He covered it once before, on the 1979 September Morn (it's pretty bad, as is most of that album)\n\nIs there news on whether or not he will tour again?\n\nI have no interest in this.\n\nNot this, not Neil Sings Christmas, not Neil sings his favorite country chestnuts.\n\nIf he's got writer's block, then he should consider do an archival release of one of his unreleased albums from the past to keep product in the pipeline.\n\nNot only don't I really want to hear Neil sing covers, but most of those covers don't interest me in the slightest...\n\nOh well...\n\nI kinda have to agree , sadly i think original albums frome neil are a thing of the past ...\n\nI have been, and am, a huge Neil Diamond fan, but this does not work for me. I want everyone to make a decent liviing, but...\n\nI would rather he go back and remaster his catalog and sell me new discs that sound great. I bought 7 of the new Beatles and I would do the same for ND.\n\nHeck I even likes his movie, The Jazz Singer.\n\nFor me he became obsolete when he released \"Heartlight\". I bought a couple of his later albums, but other than a couple of songs here and there it no longer became worth it. Then when I bought \"12 Songs\" I realized why I became a fan to begin with. I also enjoyed the follow up \"Home Before Dark\", and after listening to the samples from his latest, I'll be looking forward to it as well."
