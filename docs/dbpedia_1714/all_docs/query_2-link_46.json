        "text": "All For Metal consisting of lead vocalists Tim “Tetzel” Wagner and Antonio Calanna, guitarists Jasmin Pabst and Ursula Zanichelli, bassist Florian Toma, drummer Leif Jensen, and showgirls Christina Schulz and Luisa Lohöfer, have unveiled a video for their latest single “Path of The Brave” from their upcoming sophomore album Gods of Metal (Year of The Dragon), which will be released via Reigning Phoenix Music on August 23, 2024.\n\nTrack List for Gods of Metal (Year of The Dragon):\n\n01. Cry For Help (intro)\n\n02. Gods of Metal\n\n03. Year of The Dragon\n\n04. The Way of The Samurai\n\n05. Temple of Silence\n\n06. When Monsters Roar\n\n07. Path of The Brave\n\n08. Like Thor and Loki\n\n09. Valkyries In The Sky (feat. Laura Guldemond and Tim Hansen)\n\n10. Welcome\n\n11. Who Wants To Live Forever\n\n12. The Journey Will Not End (outro)\n\nAll For Metal‘s debut album Legends landed the #1 position on the Sleaze Roxx’s Top Ten Albums of 2023 to which Sleaze Roxx stated: “It only took hearing two songs (the ballad “Legends Never Die” and the anthem “All For Metal”) but I knew that I just had to purchase All For Metal‘s debut album Legends right away and I finally had found an album (assuming that the song quality remained the same for the rest of the tracks) that had a legitimate shot to finish at the top of the Sleaze Roxx’s Top Ten Albums of 2023. As it turns out, all of the songs on Legends turned out to be very good. Granted, All For Metal ended up having a lot of competition for the top spot from Eclipse and Temple Balls but I had to give them the nod given it’s the album that I have listened to the most in 2023 and Antonio Calanna‘s voice is truly one of the best that I have ever heard.\n\nGranted, I was at first taken aback by the “other singer” Tim “Tetzel” Wagner‘s deep, deep voice but I got used to it fairly quickly. I know what some of you might think. This is a not a “sleaze” type record… I don’t like the fantasy theme… Who really cares when all the songs really rock? The songs are so good that even my youngest daughter — who is heavily into Eminem (don’t ask) — has been caught on multiple occasions singing along to All For Metal‘s songs (especially “Goddess of War” and “Born In Valhalla”). Long-time Sleaze Roxx writer Terry Martinson and I may not be on the same page for many records but we are definitely on the same one for All For Metal‘s debut album Legends. As Terry aptly put it at the conclusion of his album review, “To quote the newly named, by me “Wonder Twins”, Tetzel and Antonio, “You better run , run better run run, better run” right online and buy your copy of Legends immediately if not sooner.””"
