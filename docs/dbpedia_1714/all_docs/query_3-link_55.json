        "text": "Kiss by the mid-1980s had become Rock establishment – they are no rock royalty. The quartet of Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Peter Criss and Ace Frehley came together in January 1973 and according to legend played their first gig in front of just three people – a decade and a half later and they were filling stadiums. Their 1973 self-titled debut album for Casablanca Records got to No.87 on the US chart, while a year later the follow-up, Hotter Than Hell, made No.100. Come 1987 the band, minus Criss and Frehley released their fourteenth studio album, ‘Crazy Nights’.\n\nUnlike many of their contemporaries, Kiss did not enjoy a lot of mainstream success on the Hot 100, but ‘Crazy Crazy Nights’, co-written by Stanley and Scottish born songwriter Adam Mitchell picked up a lot of airplay, becoming a hit in many other countries, notably, Norway, The Netherlands, Australia and the UK where it peaked at No.4 – the best performing Kiss single on the British charts. It was the same position as the album reached in the UK helping to cement the band’s reputation as a live act outside America.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was a decade earlier that Love Gun was their big breakthrough when it made No.4 on the US album charts. It was during the making of the follow-up, Dynasty that Peter Criss began recording less with the band; by the time of Unmasked in 1980, Anton Fig was occupying the drum stool, full-time. Eric Carr took over from him for Music from The Elder in 1981 and was still there in 1987. By 1982’s Creatures of the Night Frehley had also left and a string of guitarists played on the albums between then and Asylum in 1985 when Bruce Kulick joined as a fulltime member of the band. During the 1990s Kiss was one of the top-grossing bands, yet only in 2014 were they finally inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nKiss was the brainchild of Gene Simmons (bass, vocals) and Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar, vocals), former members of the New York-based hard rock band Wicked Lester; the duo brought in drummer Peter Criss through his ad in Rolling Stone, while guitarist Ace Frehley responded to an advertisement in The Village Voice. Even at their first Manhattan concert in 1973, the group’s approach was theatrical, and Flipside producer Bill Aucoin offered the band a management deal after the show. Two weeks later, the band was signed to Neil Bogart’s fledgeling record label, Casablanca. Kiss released their self-titled debut in February of 1974; it peaked at number 87 on the U.S. charts. By April of 1975, the group had released three albums and had been touring America constantly, building up a sizable fan base.\n\nCulled from those numerous concerts, Alive! (released in the fall of 1975) made the band rock & roll superstars; it climbed into the Top Ten and it’s accompanying single, “Rock ‘N’ Roll All Nite,” made it to number 12. Their follow-up, Destroyer, was released in March of 1976 and became the group’s first platinum album; it also featured their first Top Ten single, Peter Criss’ power ballad “Beth.” Kiss mania was in full swing; thousands of pieces of merchandise hit the marketplace (including pinball machines, makeup and masks, and board games), and the group had two comic books released by Marvel as well as a live-action TV movie, Kiss Meet the Phantom of the Park. A 1977 Gallup poll named Kiss the most popular band in America. The group was never seen in public without wearing their makeup, and their popularity was growing by leaps and bounds; the membership of the Kiss Army, the band’s fan club, was now in the six figures.\n\nEven such enormous popularity had its limits, and the band reached them in 1978 when all four members released solo albums on the same day in October. Simmons’ record was the most successful, reaching number 22 on the charts, yet all of them made it into the Top 50. Dynasty, released in 1979, continued their streak of platinum albums, yet it was their last record with the original lineup — Criss left in 1980. Kiss Unmasked, released in the summer of 1980, was recorded with session drummer Anton Fig; Criss’ true replacement, Eric Carr, joined the band in time for their 1980 world tour. Kiss Unmasked was their first record since Destroyer to fail to go platinum, and 1981’s Music From The Elder, their first album recorded with Carr, didn’t even go gold — it couldn’t even climb past number 75 on the charts. Ace Frehley left the band after its release; he was replaced by Vinnie Vincent in 1982. Vincent’s first album with the group, 1982’s Creatures Of The Night, fared better than Music from the Elder, yet it couldn’t make it past number 45 on the charts.\n\nSensing it was time for a change, Kiss dispensed with their makeup for 1983’s Lick It Up. The publicity worked, as the album became their first platinum record in four years. Animalize, released the following year, was just as successful, and the group essentially recaptured their niche. Vincent left after Animalize and was replaced by Mark St. John, although St. John was soon taken ill with Reiter’s Syndrome and left the band. Bruce Kulick became Kiss’ new lead guitarist in 1984. For the rest of the decade, Kiss turned out a series of best-selling albums, culminating in the early 1990 hit ballad “Forever,” which was their biggest single since “Beth.” Kiss was scheduled to record a new album with their old producer, Bob Ezrin, in 1990 when Eric Carr became severely ill with cancer; he died in November of 1991 at the age of 41. Kiss replaced him with Eric Singer and recorded Revenge(1992), their first album since 1989; it was a Top Ten hit and went gold. Kiss followed it with the release of Alive III the following year; it performed respectably but was not up to the standards of their two previous live records.\n\nIn 1996, the original lineup of Kiss — featuring Simmons, Stanley, Frehley, and Criss — reunited to perform an international tour, complete with their notorious makeup and special effects. The tour was one of the most successful of 1996 and in 1998 the reunited group issued Psycho Circus. While the ensuing tour in support of Psycho Circus was a success, sales of Kiss’ reunion album weren’t as stellar as anticipated. Reminiscent of the band’s late-’70s unfocused period, few tracks on Psycho Circus featured all four members playing together (most tracks were supplemented with session musicians), as the band seemed more interested in flooding the marketplace with merchandise yet again instead of making the music their top priority. With rumours running rampant that the Psycho Circus Tour would be their last, the quartet announced in the spring of 2000 that they would be launching a U.S. farewell tour in the summer, which became one of the year’s top concert draws. But on the eve of a Japanese and Australian tour in early 2001, Peter Criss suddenly left the band once again, supposedly discontent with his salary. Taking his place was previous Kiss drummer Eric Singer, who in a controversial move among some longtime fans, donned Criss’ cat-man makeup (since Simmons and Stanley own both Frehley and Criss’ makeup designs, there was no threat of a lawsuit) as the farewell tour continued.\n\nWith the band scheduled to call it a day supposedly by late 2001, a mammoth career-encompassing box set was set for later in the year, while the summer saw perhaps the most over-the-top piece of Kiss merchandise yet — the “Kiss Kasket.” The group was relatively quiet through the rest of the year, but 2002 started with a bang as Gene Simmons turned in an entertaining and controversial interview on NPR where he criticized the organization and berated host Terry Gross with sexual comments and condescending answers. He was promoting his autobiography at the time, which also caused dissent in the Kiss camp because of the inflammatory remarks made toward Ace Frehley. Frehley was quite angry at the situation, leading to his no-show at an American Bandstand anniversary show. (His place was taken by a wig-wearing Tommy Thayer, but no one was fooled and the band looked especially awful while pretending to play their instruments during the pre-recorded track.)"
