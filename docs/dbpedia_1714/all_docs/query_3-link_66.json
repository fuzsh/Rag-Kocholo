        "text": "First re-release on picture disc of the debut full-length solo album by the former lead guitarist and vocalist of legendary American Hard Rock/Glam Rock band Kiss.\n\nIt was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978. The album featured Anton Fig on drums, which later performed session work on the Kiss albums \"Dynasty\" and \"Unmasked\", as well as become a member of Ace Frehley’s band Frehley’s Comet. Fig along with Will Lee, who played bass on three tracks on the album, became permanent members of Paul Shaffer’s band on \"Late Night\" with David Letterman and \"Late Show\" with David Letterman.\n\nOf the four Kiss solo albums released simultaneously in 1978, the best of the bunch is guitarist Ace Frehley's. Similar in approach to Paul Stanley's album, Frehley did not stray far from the expected heavy Kiss sound (like Gene Simmons and Peter Criss did with their releases), but Ace was equipped with better compositions than Stanley.\n\nFrehley proved once and for all that he was not simply a backup musician to Kiss head honchos Simmons and Stanley. All of the tracks are strong, such as the venomous opener, \"Rip It Out\", as well as a few tracks that confirm how Frehley was indulging in alcohol and drugs a bit too much by the late '70s (\"Snow Blind\", \"Ozone\", and \"Wiped Out\"). You'll also find many underrated compositions (\"Speedin' Back to My Baby\", \"What's on Your Mind?\", \"I'm in Need of Love\"), a gorgeous instrumental (\"Fractured Mirror\"), and the Top 20 hit single \"New York Groove\". Unfortunately, when Ace left Kiss in 1982 (eventually forming Frehley's Comet), he never came close to topping this solid and inspired 1978 solo outing.\n\nCasablanca/Lilith Ltd., 1978/2006 (LR114LPP). Manufactured in EU. 180g Picture Disc.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide One\n\n1. Rip It Out 3:40\n\n2. Speedin' Back To My Baby 3:37\n\n3. Snow Blind 3:55\n\n4. Ozone 4:40\n\n5. What's On Your Mind? 3:27\n\nSide Two\n\n6. New York Groove 3:03\n\n7. I'm In Need Of Love 4:37\n\n8. Wiped-Out 4:13\n\n9. Fractured Mirror 5:26\n\nTotal playing time: 36:38 min.\n\nFirst re-release on picture disc of the debut full-length solo album by the bassist and co-vocalist of legendary American Hard Rock/Glam Rock band Kiss.\n\nIt was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978.\n\nAlthough he is the bass player in Kiss, Simmons played mainly electric and acoustic guitars on the album, leaving the bass duties to Neil Jason. The album features guest appearances from well-known musicians, including Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Bob Seger, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, Donna Summer and Cher. Though unknown at the time, backing vocalist Katey Sagal would go on to a successful television career.\n\nMost Kiss fans associate Gene Simmons with the band's hardest-rocking compositions; after all, he's responsible for such heavies as \"Watchin' You\", \"Calling Dr. Love\", \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Goin' Blind\". So many Kiss fans must have been surprised when they heard this Gene's diverse solo album, with songs that contained choirs and string arrangements, plus elements of Beatles pop, '70s Funk/Disco and feel-good Rock & Roll. Granted, there are a few heavy rockers (such as the single \"Radioactive\", \"Burning Up With Fever\" and \"See You in Your Dreams\"), but Simmons was always a closet Beatles fan, as evidenced by \"See You Tonite\", \"Always Near You\", \"Man of 1,000 Faces\" and \"Mr. Make Believe\".\n\nSimmons re-recorded \"See You in Your Dreams\" because he reportedly was not happy with the way it was recorded on \"Rock and Roll Over\". The only real misstep is a preposterously embarrassing cover of the Disney classic \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (complete with Disney-esque sound effects/music). Simmons said that he covered \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" because he related to the song and was a fan of Disney movies. But Simmons made sure that the top artists of the day lent a hand (Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, Donna Summer, Cher, Bob Seger, Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter, Helen Reddy, and Janis Ian), which makes Gene's solo album an unpredictable yet ultimately enjoyable release.\n\nThe album reached #22 on the US Billboard album chart, making it the highest-placing of all the four Kiss solos of 1978. It was certified Platinum on October 2, 1978, having shipped 1000000 copies.\n\nCasablanca/Lilith Ltd., 1978/2006 (LR113LPP). Manufactured in EU. 180g Picture Disc.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide One\n\n1. Radioactive 3:51\n\n2. Burning Up With Fever 4:22\n\n3. See You Tonite 2:28\n\n4. Tunnel Of Love 3:53\n\n5. True Confessions 3:30\n\nSide Two\n\n6. Living In Sin 3:51\n\n7.

When You Wish Upon A Star 2:43\n\nTotal playing time: 39:00 min.\n\nFirst re-release on picture disc of the debut full-length solo album by the rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of legendary American Hard Rock/Glam Rock band Kiss.\n\nIt was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978. It is the only album of the four Kiss solo albums to feature all original songs, as Simmons, Criss and Frehley each recorded one cover song on their albums.\n\nPaul Stanley's 1978 solo album was the most Kiss-like of the four, sounding more like an official band release rather than a solo outing. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing - Stanley had become a seasoned Hard Rock songwriter by this point, churning out some of Kiss' best material (\"Love Gun\", \"Detroit Rock City\", \"I Want You\" etc.), and wisely stuck to his winning formula on Paul Stanley. With the help of studio musicians, as well as guitarist Bob Kulick (who was almost an original member of Kiss, and brother of future Kiss replacement guitarist Bruce) and Rod Stewart/Vanilla Fudge drummer Carmine Appice, Stanley's album is on par with Ace Frehley's as far as consistency is concerned. A couple of epic compositions (by Kiss standards) are highlights: \"Tonight You Belong to Me\" and \"Take Me Away (Together as One)\", as are the more straightforward tracks \"Ain't Quite Right\", \"Wouldn't You Like to Know Me?\", \"It's Alright\" and \"Goodbye\".\n\nWhile his other Kiss bandmates took more chances with their solo records (with varying results), Stanley's album is more or less what a new Kiss album released in 1978 would have sounded like!\n\nThe album reached #40 on the US Billboard album chart. It was generally regarded as the second best of the solo albums, following Frehley's.\n\nCasablanca/Lilith Ltd., 1978/2006 (LR116LPP). Manufactured in EU. 180g Picture Disc.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide One\n\n1. Tonight You Belong To Me 4:40\n\n2. Move On 3:11\n\n3. Ain't Quite Right 3:35\n\n4. Wouldn't You Like To Know Me? 3:18\n\n5. Take Me Away (Together As One) 5:34\n\n6. It's Alright 3:34\n\nSide Two\n\n7. Hold Me, Touch Me (Think Of Me When We're Apart) 3:40\n\n8. Love In Chains 3:33\n\n9. Goodbye 4:09\n\nTotal playing time: 35:14 min.\n\nFirst re-release on picture disc of the debut full-length solo album the drummer of legendary American Hard Rock/Glam Rock band Kiss.\n\nIt was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978. The album was produced by Vini Poncia, who went on to produce the Kiss albums \"Dynasty\" (1979) and \"Unmasked\" (1980). Criss covered \"Tossin' and Turnin'\", which was a #1 hit for Bobby Lewis in the U.S. during the summer of 1961. The song was subsequently covered by Kiss on their 1979 tour. Much of the material on the album was originally written in 1971 for Criss's pre-Kiss band Lips.\n\nAt the peak of their popularity in 1978, Kiss decided to maximize their sales potential and exploit their loyal audience by having each member release a solo record on the same day. Instead of sending sales through the roof, it had the unexpected effect of stopping their momentum cold. It wasn't because the market was flooded with Kiss product - although it certainly was, since they released nine albums, including two double-live records and a compilation, in the course of four years - it was because the albums were, for the most part, terrible. Peter Criss' effort was one of the most undistinguished of the bunch, lacking hooks on the Pop-Metal rockers or the power ballads, as well as personality throughout. Even Kiss fans will have a hard time making their way through this record, or any of the other solo albums.\n\nThe album was the lowest charting of all the Kiss solo albums of 1978, reaching #43 on the US Billboard album chart. Of the four solo albums, \"Peter Criss\" was the only album to have two singles released from it: \"Don't You Let Me Down\" and \"You Matter to Me\".\n\nCasablanca/Lilith Ltd., 1978/2006 (LR115LPP). Manufactured in EU. 180g Picture Disc.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide One\n\n1. I'm Gonna Love You 3:19\n\n2. You Matter To Me 3:17\n\n3. Tossin' And Turnin' 4:01\n\n4. Don't You Let Me Down 3:43\n\n5. That's The Kind Of Sugar Papa Likes 3:01\n\nSide Two\n\n6. Easy Thing 3:54\n\n7. Rock Me, Baby 2:53\n\n8. Kiss The Girld Goodbye 2:46\n\n9. Hooked On Rock 'n' Roll 3:37\n\n10. I Can't Stop The Rain 4:26\n\nTotal playing time: 34:57 min.\n\nRemastered re-release of the tenth full-length studio album by legendary American Horror/Glam Metal/Hard Rock band.\n\n“Creatures Of The Night” represented a conscious effort by KISS to return to the Hard Rock style that had helped them achieve commercial success with \"Destroyer\" and \"Love Gun\". Their Pop-oriented albums \"Dynasty\" and \"Unmasked\" had started a decline in popularity that reached Rock bottom with 1981's \"Music from The Elder\". By 1982, KISS knew it needed to deliver on their earlier 1980–81 promise of a heavy record.\n\n“Creatures Of The Night” was the band's last for Casablanca Records, the only label for which KISS had recorded up to that point. The album was dedicated to the memory of Casablanca founder and early KISS supporter Neil Bogart, who had died of cancer during the recording sessions. It is also the band's last album recorded with Ace Frehley credited as an official member and their first album with Vinnie Vincent as the initially-uncredited lead guitarist (Vincent would later be credited but not featured on the cover of the 1985 reissue of the album). It was also KISS' last album to feature the band with their trademark makeup until \"Psycho Circus\" was released.\n\nThe first key ingredient was songwriter/guitarist Vinnie Vincent, who was soon to replace Ace Frehley as the band's new lead guitarist. Though Frehley did not play on the album, his face was still featured on the album cover for contractual and commercial reasons. Frehley had been pushing the band to do a heavy Rock record since \"Dynasty\", and by the time of \"Creatures Of The Night\" he was fully disillusioned with the band, and that combined with alcoholism and a prescription medicine dependency (begun after a car wreck) led to his leaving the band during the recording sessions. On the tour, Vincent was introduced with his Egyptian Ankh make-up, designed in a hurry by Paul Stanley. In 1985, KISS re-released the album in their non-make-up state with a cover featuring Gene Simmons, Stanley, Eric Carr and then-current guitarist Bruce Kulick (even though Kulick did not play on the album). Vinnie Vincent had long since departed the band (being twice fired) by 1985.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.\n\nKISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums. Band has 14 Platinum albums, with three albums being multi-Platinum.\n\nOn April 10, 2014, the four original members of KISS were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nKISS was ranked by MTV as the ninth \"Greatest Metal Band of All Time\", and placed tenth on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list, as well as being ranked as the third \"Best Metal and Hard Rock Live Band of All Time\" by Loudwire.\n\n\"Creatures Of The Night\" would not attain Gold status until 1994. The album would receive critical recognition with both Kerrang! and Guitar World magazines placing the album at #5 on their lists of best hard rock albums in 1982. Carr noted in an interview that \"Creatures Of The Night\" is his favorite KISS record that he played on. Simmons and Stanley, who have generally been dismissive of the band's post-1977 albums, considered \"Creatures Of The Night\" to be one of their stronger efforts.\n\n\"Creatures Of The Night\" was certified Gold by the RIAA on May 9, 1994. It also was certified Gold in Brazil in 1983, for sales of 100 000 copies.\n\n\"Creatures Of The Night\" was re-released in 1997 in a remastered version.\n\nKISS Catalog, Ltd./Mercury Records, a PolyGram Company, 1982/1997/2014 (378 645-2).

With their approval, Ezrin acquired the original 16-track analog master tapes and had them digitally transferred for remixing. In addition to re-equalizing elements of each song, Ezrin also added in some parts of tracks that had been omitted from the original mix.\n\nThese include some additional vocals on \"Detroit Rock City\" and \"Beth\", and the substitution of a guitar solo by Frehley on \"Sweet Pain\" for the one from the original that had been performed by Wagner (a version of \"Sweet Pain\" with Frehley's solo was included as track 6, while the original version with Wagner's solo is appended as a \"bonus\" track at the end of the new CD). Ezrin also used digital manipulation to fix an incorrect lyric (changing \"down 95\" to \"doin' 95\") on \"Detroit Rock City\". The resulting album, titled \"Destroyer: Resurrected\", was released on August 21, 2012. It featured Ken Kelly's original cover artwork prior to alteration by Casablanca for the 1976 release.\n\n\"Destroyer: Resurrected\" returned to the Billboard charts, debuting at #11 the week after its re-release.\n\nEach track sounds crisper, clearer and louder, which are always welcome qualities when you’re listening to a classic album of the likes of \"Destroyer\"!\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.\n\nKISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums.

Magazine listed “Destroyer” at No. 36 among the \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time\". In 2003, it was ranked No. 489 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

It was the first album by the band to be certified Gold. The success of \"Alive!\", which spent 110 weeks on the charts, benefited not only the struggling band but also their cash-strapped label Casablanca Records. KISS signed a new contract with Casablanca in late 1975, partly because the label had been very supportive from the start of the band's career. The contract was for two albums, an indication that Casablanca was unsure if the group could duplicate the accomplishments of \"Alive!\".\n\n“Destroyer” is the first KISS album to prominently feature outside musicians, such as members of the New York Philharmonic. One musician not credited was Dick Wagner, from Alice Cooper's band, replacing Ace Frehley on the track \"Sweet Pain\". Wagner also played the acoustic guitar found on the song \"Beth\".\n\n“Destroyer” was the third successive KISS album to reach the top 40 in the US, as well as the first to chart in Germany and New Zealand. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on April 22, 1976, and Platinum on November 11 of the same year. It was the first KISS album to achieve Platinum status. The album marked a departure from the raw sound of the band's first three albums. The success of \"Alive!\" and \"Destroyer\" enabled the band to embark on their first tour of Europe.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.\n\nKISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums. Band has 14 Platinum albums, with three albums being multi-Platinum.\n\nOn April 10, 2014, the four original members of KISS were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nKISS was ranked by MTV as the ninth \"Greatest Metal Band of All Time\", and placed tenth on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list, as well as being ranked as the third \"Best Metal and Hard Rock Live Band of All Time\" by Loudwire.\n\nIn 1989, Kerrang! Magazine listed “Destroyer” at No. 36 among the \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time\". In 2003, it was ranked No. 489 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2006, it was placed at No. 60 on Guitar World Magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time.

Possibly due to the short length of the album, original vinyl versions had long pauses between each track to create the illusion that the sides were longer than they were. Each side ran just 15 minutes, and some of the song times were listed incorrectly on the vinyl versions. For example, \"Two Timer\" was listed at 2:59 and \"Ladies in Waiting\" was listed at 2:47.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.\n\nKISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums.

A live version of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" from \"Alive!\", issued as a single later that year, reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n“Dressed To Kill” was re-released in 1997 in a remastered version.\n\nKISS Catalog, Ltd./Mercury Records, A PolyGram Company, 1975/1997/2014 (378 645-7).

It is also the final KISS album to feature Carr in its entirety before his death in November 1991. Just like its predecessor album, \"Crazy Nights\", \"Hot In The Shade\" also features keyboards and synthesizers. The album is one of the band's longest, with a running time of nearly an hour, and contains the most songs of any KISS studio album with 15.\n\n“Hot In The Shade” showcases a more straight ahead Hard Rock sound after the keyboard-centered Pop Metal in \"Crazy Nights\" and even flirts with Speed Metal in \"Boomerang\". \"Little Caesar\" was Eric Carr's first lead vocal on an original song, although he had previously sung lead on a re-recorded version of \"Beth\" on the compilation album \"Smashes, Thrashes & Hits\".\n\n“Hot In The Shade” was certified Gold on December 20, 1989 by the RIAA and has sold over 800 000 copies since its release. Its most successful single, \"Forever\", reached #8 on the Billboard charts, the band's highest charting single in the US since \"Beth\", 13 years earlier.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.

Of the album's twelve songs, four were new compositions recorded specifically for it: \"I'm a Legend Tonight\", \"Down on Your Knees\", \"Nowhere to Run\" and \"Partners in Crime\". These new songs were recorded at the behest of Phonogram Records, in response to the commercial failure of 1981's \"Music From The Elder\".\n\nNumerous outside songwriters and session musicians were employed for the writing and recording of the four new songs on \"Killers\", as well as the subsequent album, \"Creatures Of The Night\". Songwriter and musician Mikel Japp, who co-wrote three songs on Paul Stanley's 1978 solo album, co-wrote \"Down on Your Knees\" with Stanley and Bryan Adams. Adam Mitchell, another outside songwriter, was brought in by producer Michael James Jackson.\n\nDespite being pictured on the album's cover art (from the photo session for \"Music From The Elder\"), lead guitarist and co-founder Ace Frehley did not participate at all in the production of \"Killers\". He had essentially ended his active involvement with KISS in late 1981, although he would not officially leave the band until the end of 1982, after the release of \"Creatures Of The Night\". His replacement for the \"Killers\" sessions was Bob Kulick, who had previously substituted for Frehley on a handful of studio tracks on 1977's \"Alive II\"; however, whereas Kulick had been asked to mimic Frehley's playing style when recording for \"Alive II\", he was permitted to employ his own techniques for \"Killers\". The four new songs were considered a \"primer\" for KISS' next release, while some fans have indicated that fan club memos at the time listed Frehley as \"temporarily out of action\", possibly due to a car accident or something similar, and originally listed Vinnie Vincent as a temporary replacement for Frehley.\n\nDue to the large volume of KISS live albums and greatest hits albums already available domestically, Phonogram decided to issue the \"Killers\" outside the US. The album sold in moderate numbers, reaching its highest chart position of #6 in Norway. It peaked at #21 and #27 in Australia and Japan, respectively. In Sweden and the UK, it reached #41 and #42, respectively. None of the singles released from the album charted in any country. Also, due to the shape of the S in their band logo, there were two covers: one with the standard \"S\", and a more European friendly version with a \"backwards\"-Z shape.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.\n\nKISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums.

With the exception of \"Kissin' Time\", all of the material for \"Kiss\" was written before the band entered the studio. Some of the songs were written during Wicked Lester's brief existence, while \"Firehouse\" was written by Paul Stanley, when he was attending the High School of Music & Art in New York City.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.\n\nKISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums.

Casablanca Records and FilmWorks shipped 1 000 000 copies of the album on this date.\n\nIt was the band's first album to feature a lead vocal performance from Ace Frehley, making it the first KISS album to feature lead vocal performances from all four band members. It was also the last studio album to feature Peter Criss on every song, as he was replaced by session drummer Anton Fig for all but one song on 1979's \"Dynasty\".\n\n\"Love Gun\" was certified Platinum on June 30, 1977.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.

Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons contacted former members Peter Criss and Ace Frehley and invited them to participate. It marked the only time the original lineup performed publicly without their trademark makeup, and was also the only time Frehley and Criss shared a stage with Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick. It was the first time Singer had part of a lead vocal on an album (shared with Criss on \"Nothin' to Lose\"). Fan reaction to Criss and Frehley at the show was so positive that, in 1996, the original lineup of KISS reunited, with all four original members together for the first time since 1979.\n\nIt is the first live album by the band that is not part of the \"Alive\" series.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.\n\nKISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums.

In an effort to return to their Hard Rock roots, KISS began recording music more akin to the Hard Rock style that launched them to popularity in the mid-1970s. But at the same time, Simmons, Stanley, and creative manager Bill Aucoin felt that just returning to a harder sound was not enough. They believed that only a bold, artistic statement would regenerate public interest in KISS. To that end, they enlisted producer Bob Ezrin to work with the band, who, in turn, employed members from the American Symphony Orchestra and St. Robert's Choir to record tracks for the album. Ezrin had worked with the band before, producing their hit 1976 album \"Destroyer\". He had also co-produced Pink Floyd's 1979 concept album \"The Wall\". Simmons, Stanley, and Aucoin felt that Ezrin could help bring their ambitions to fruition. Most participants in the album's recording admit that it was a major misstep for KISS. Ezrin, despite his recent success with the even more ambitious \"Wall\" album, admitted that his judgments concerning \"Music From The Elder\" were clouded due in large part to a cocaine addiction at the time. Stanley and Simmons admit that they were \"delusional\" concerning the project, while Frehley has stated that he felt that it was not a good idea to begin with.\n\n\"Music From The Elder\" was the first album with drummer Eric Carr and the last album to feature Ace Frehley, until their 1996 reunion Alive Worldwide Tour, apart from appearing on the cover of the compilation album \"Killers\" and the next album, \"Creatures Of The Night\", as well as a handful of promotional appearances with the band until late 1982.\n\nDespite the general negative feelings towards this album, it has garnered some occasional praise in recent years. In 2011, the American website Guitar World mentioned the album among their \"50 Great Albums Celebrating Their 30th Anniversary\" in 2011, while the Brazilian Roadie Crew Magazine did likewise in a list of \"The 81 Greatest Albums of 1981\". Later, in 2017, Roadie Crew rank it among their \"Greatest 40 Concept Albums Ever\" at #22. In 2016, Classic Rock Magazine ranked the album among a list of \"The 20 Most Underrated Classic Rock Albums Ever\". In 2018, the French edition of the Rock Hard Magazine included it in the Volume 2 of its \"Ideal Metaltheque\", in the concept albums category. There are rumours that \"The Elder\" has sold around 500 000 copies, however, this has yet to be substantiated by any official audit, and has not been certified Gold as of 2018.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums. KISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums. Band has 14 Platinum albums, with three albums being multi-Platinum. On April 10, 2014, the four original members of KISS were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Criss' vocals are featured on the tracks \"Baby Driver\" and \"Hard Luck Woman\". Paul Stanley, who originally wanted the latter song to be sung by Rod Stewart, gave it to Criss, after Gene Simmons insisted Criss sing the song instead.\n\nAlthough \"Hard Luck Woman\" did not equal the success of \"Beth\", it did become another top 20 single for KISS. \"Calling Dr. Love\" became a concert staple.

The album marked the first time KISS had used the contributions of outside songwriters to such a large extent, as all tracks except two of the Frehley contributions, \"Talk to Me\" and \"Two Sides of the Coin\", were written or co-written by someone outside the band. Despite being credited, Peter Criss had no involvement with the recording of the album; Anton Fig played all the drums uncredited. The band filmed a promotional video for \"Shandi\" with Criss. It was the last time he appeared with KISS until he performed with them at a \"Kiss Convention\" on June 17, 1995. Criss was fired from the band in May 1980 due to his erratic behavior.\n\nKISS is one of the best-selling bands of all the time, having sold more than 75 000 000 records worldwide, including 25 000 000 RIAA-certified albums.\n\nKISS also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning band of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums.

The album got a Gold certification from the RIAA two months after its launch, although it was the first KISS album not to obtain the certification of Platinum since \"Destroyer\" (1976). Meanwhile, in Europe and Oceania, KISS maintained its popularity; \"Unmasked\" topped the charts in Norway and New Zealand, and reached the top 5 in Australia, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. The band decided to take a break from the U.S., and Kiss played in Australia, England, New Zealand, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, and Italy.\n\n\"Unmasked\" was re-released in 1997 in a remastered version.\n\nKISS Catalog, Ltd./Mercury Records, a PolyGram Company, 1980/1997/2014 (378 646-6).

The album featured Anton Fig on drums, which later performed session work on the Kiss albums \"Dynasty\" and \"Unmasked\", as well as become a member of Ace Frehley’s band Frehley’s Comet. Fig along with Will Lee, who played bass on three tracks on the album, became permanent members of Paul Shaffer’s band on \"Late Night\" with David Letterman and \"Late Show\" with David Letterman.\n\nOf the four Kiss solo albums released simultaneously in 1978, the best of the bunch is guitarist Ace Frehley's. Similar in approach to Paul Stanley's album, Frehley did not stray far from the expected heavy Kiss sound (like Gene Simmons and Peter Criss did with their releases), but Ace was equipped with better compositions than Stanley.\n\nFrehley proved once and for all that he was not simply a backup musician to Kiss head honchos Simmons and Stanley. All of the tracks are strong, such as the venomous opener, \"Rip It Out\", as well as a few tracks that confirm how Frehley was indulging in alcohol and drugs a bit too much by the late '70s (\"Snow Blind\", \"Ozone\", and \"Wiped Out\"). You'll also find many underrated compositions (\"Speedin' Back to My Baby\", \"What's on Your Mind?\", \"I'm in Need of Love\"), a gorgeous instrumental (\"Fractured Mirror\"), and the Top 20 hit single \"New York Groove\". Unfortunately, when Ace left Kiss in 1982 (eventually forming Frehley's Comet), he never came close to topping this solid and inspired 1978 solo outing.\n\nCasablanca Records/KISS Catalog Ltd./Mercury Records, a PolyGram company, 1978/1997/2014 (378 645-8).

It is the only album of the four Kiss solo albums to feature all original songs, as Simmons, Criss and Frehley each recorded one cover song on their albums.\n\nPaul Stanley's 1978 solo album was the most Kiss-like of the four, sounding more like an official band release rather than a solo outing. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing - Stanley had become a seasoned Hard Rock songwriter by this point, churning out some of Kiss' best material (\"Love Gun\", \"Detroit Rock City\", \"I Want You\" etc.), and wisely stuck to his winning formula on Paul Stanley. With the help of studio musicians, as well as guitarist Bob Kulick (who was almost an original member of Kiss, and brother of future Kiss replacement guitarist Bruce) and Rod Stewart/Vanilla Fudge drummer Carmine Appice, Stanley's album is on par with Ace Frehley's as far as consistency is concerned. A couple of epic compositions (by Kiss standards) are highlights: \"Tonight You Belong to Me\" and \"Take Me Away (Together as One)\", as are the more straightforward tracks \"Ain't Quite Right\", \"Wouldn't You Like to Know Me?\", \"It's Alright\" and \"Goodbye\".\n\nWhile his other Kiss bandmates took more chances with their solo records (with varying results), Stanley's album is more or less what a new Kiss album released in 1978 would have sounded like!\n\nThe album reached #40 on the US Billboard album chart. It was generally regarded as the second best of the solo albums, following Frehley's.\n\nCasablanca Records/KISS Catalog Ltd./Mercury Records, a PolyGram company, 1978/1997/2014 (378 640-7).

On the surface, that probably makes it their best album in a long, long time. Even their better albums of the last 30 years have generally been nods to current musical trends, so at least now they’re giving a nod to their own success.\n\nKISS has always been about entertaining their fans and that's just what \"Sonic Boom\" does. The other thing to keep in mind is that the release is available exclusively through Walmart, so really, they just want your money. Ultimately, \"Sonic Boom\" once again reminds us that KISS is that middle-aged guy with the top three buttons of his Hawaiian shirt undone who drives around in his convertible and still manages to bag the occasional college chick with his old pick-up lines from the '70s. You want to roll your eyes, but admit it; you love hanging out with the dude!\n\n\"Sonic Boom\" debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, selling 108 000 copies in its first week of release. The #2 position was the highest mark ever reached by the band, beating the #3 debut of \"Psycho Circus\" in 1998. The album finished 2009 with 238 000 units sold. \"Sonic Boom\" finished 2010 as one of Billboard's Top 50 Rock Albums. Metal Hammer listed the album in 13th place on the Metal Hammer Albums of 2009 list. Since its release, \"Sonic Boom\" has received Gold certification in Norway.\n\nQuad-Fold Wallet Digipack includes original album, bonus CD “Kiss Klassics” (a completely re-recorded greatest hits album that until now had been exclusively released in Japan as “Jigoku-Retsuden”), bonus DVD “Kiss Live in Buenos Aires” (six-song live DVD recorded April 5, 2009, as part of the South American leg of the Kiss Alive/35 World Tour) and 20-page booklet.\n\nKISS Catalog Ltd./Kiss Records, 2009 (200901).
