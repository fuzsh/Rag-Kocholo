        "text": "This one, while potentially well known inside this circle, is a recent favorite of mine, and while the majority of their work appears elsewhere in the blogosphere, I haven’t seen this 12” around.\n\nThe Arms of Someone New (primarily a collaborative project between Mel Eberle and Steve Jones, also involved with Area) formed in Champaign, Illinois in 1983, releasing their first 7” the following year. At first, their sound had a biting, synth-driven edge to it, which eventually gave way to the growing ethereal scene into the late 1980s. I happen to dig the majority of their recordings in both spectrums, but this one falls more on the biting, danceable side of the band’s catalog. We have two remixes of the single here (both drastically different from the version that appeared on their 1984 12”), with two slower, but no less stellar tracks taking up the b-side. Here’s the breakdown:\n\nThe Arms of Someone New- Every Seventh Wave 12”\n\n1. Every Seventh Wave (Intermix)\n\n2. Every Seventh Wave (Album Mix)\n\n3. The Sense of an Ending\n\n4. Everything at Once\n\n*download it here*\n\nFor those interested in the rest of the band’s discography, get it here, here, here, and here. Pretty sure this is the last piece of the puzzle!\n\nWhen I think of the best UK bands, few spring to mind quicker than B-Movie. I’ve covered them twice here before, once with their 1985 LP Forever Running and then a few years later with their unstoppable Nowhere Girl 12”. I’ve been meaning to upload their earlier singles for some time now, probably years, but it just slipped through the cracks. I hope you’ll forgive me, folks.\n\nThat said, contained within this zip file is the majority of B-Movie’s early works, starting from their first 12”s in 1980 and spanning until 1984. Quite a prolific period for the band, with most of their best songs being issued in this two year time period. Here’s the rundown:\n\nB-Movie- Take Three 7” (1980)\n\n1. The Soldier Stood Alone\n\n2. Drowning Man\n\n3. Soundtrack\n\nB-Movie- Nowhere Girl (1980)\n\n1. Nowhere Girl\n\n2. This Still Life\n\n3. Institution Walls\n\n4. Airplanes & Mountains\n\n5. Left Out In The Cold\n\n6. Remembrance Day\n\nB-Movie- Remembrance Day 12” (1981)\n\n1. Remembrance Day\n\n2. Institution Walls (Remix)\n\nB-Movie- Marilyn Dreams 7” (1981)\n\n1. Marilyn Dreams\n\n2. Film Music Part 1\n\nB-Movie- Marilyn Dreams 12” (1981)\n\n1. Marilyn Dreams\n\nB-Movie- Nowhere Girl 7” (1982)\n\n1. Nowhere Girl (Version)\n\n2. Scare Some Life Into Me\n\nB-Movie- Nowhere Girl 12”\n\n1. Nowhere Girl (Version)\n\n2. Remembrance Day\n\n3. Nowhere Girl (Short Version)\n\nB-Movie- A Letter From Afar (1984)\n\n1. A Letter From Afar (Big Mix)\n\n2. A Letter From Afar (Instrumental Mix)\n\n3. A Letter From Afar (Small Mix)\n\n*download it all here*\n\nAgain, in case you missed them the first time- here’s the full Nowhere Girl 12” (including the 12” extended mix) and their 1985 LP, Forever Running.\n\nHere’s a virtually unknown 12” from UK post-punk band Blue Siege. Definitely a must for fans of Sad Lovers and Giants, For Against, The Chameleons, etc., and also for those who like something a little more jangly (Winter Hours, early R.E.M.). Melodic singing, driving post-punk tracks, and a nice, punchy atmosphere. Prominent use of organ on here, if that’s your thing!\n\nCan’t find a ton of information about this one, though I do believe it’s from 1986. The band released a 7” just before via Pride Communications, the same label who issued this recording. The 7” features production from Chris Layhe of the Icicle Works, another touchstone for the band’s sound. As for obtaining a copy of this one, there’s a few kicking around on ebay and various online record outlets, so snap one up!\n\nBlue Siege- Ruins No Longer Remain 12”\n\n1. Ruins No Longer Remain\n\n2. Stolen Daylight\n\n3. Like Red Rags To the Bull (Soweto)\n\n4. Hollow Man\n\n5. River Has Gone\n\n6. Drifting Apart\n\n*download it here*\n\nHere’s a real quick post before I sneak off for the weekened. Uploaded here, by generous donation, we have one of the best minimal synth singles out there, at least in my opinion. The a-side is an absolute romantic synth classic, while the b-side here is a more atmospheric, piano-driven affair, an interesting but pleasant counterpoint to the sheer pop perfection on the flip.\n\nFun fact about this one. Main contributor Chris Payne was also in both Visage and the Dramatis (who had a solid hit with Gary Numan on vox). Easy to see why there’s such great mastery on this one! Here’s the info:\n\nThe Electronic Circus- Direct Lines 7”\n\n1. Direct Lines\n\n2. Le Chorale\n\n*download link removed* – this 7” was reissued in 2017 by Animated Records in Chicago, and again in 2021 by Iron Lung Records. Support these labels and the artists and pick up a reissue copy if you can!\n\nFor those not entirely thrilled with the idea of a Depeche Mode clone, here’s a request that should suit you well. This particular 12” has been posted before over at music…isms, but the author admittedly wasn’t able to provide the b-side at good quality. A shame, as I find the second track on this 1982 single to be the best of the three!\n\nYou can read more about this UK synth/post-punk hybrid and nab the rest of their work over at music…isms, so let’s just dive right in!\n\nEx Post Facto- Oceanic Explorers 12”\n\n1. Oceanic Explorers\n\n2. Bast\n\n3. Marilyn\n\n*download it here* (RE-RIPPED at 320kbps on 7.31.18)\n\nI’m not usually fond of posting cassette rips, but this one’s an exception. Here we have an unlisted, scarce demo tape by Scottish synthpop band Dr. Strangelove, who were active in the early 1990s.\n\nThis seems to be their only “release,” though the band did, in fact, make a promotional video for the first track. They soon disappeared into the ether, without a trace. However, just a few years ago, 3 of the 4 members reconvened and formed Analog Angel, re-recording many of their older songs in a newer format. Their re-recording of “Why Do You Do” is virtuallty identical to the original, quality improvements aside. Analog Angel have, in fact, released their debut album, which can be purchased via their webpage.\n\nTheir promotional video gained a bit of internet notoriety when it appeared with the tag “Depeche Mode-esque.” Naturally, forming in the early 90s and adopting a synth-pop sound, Depeche Mode was a major influence in both style and execution. Fans of Black Celebration and Music For the Masses should enjoy this one.\n\nDr. Strangelove- Demo K7\n\n1. Why Do You Do?\n\n2. Consequences\n\n3. ‘Title Unknown’\n\n*download it here*\n\nSorry I can’t offer any artwork, but here’s the video for ‘Why Do You Do’ for your viewing pleasure:\n\nSome of you may have seen this one kicking around previously over at Capa Nostra Syndicate, but I believe there may be a skip or two on that particular upload. So apologies for the repetition, but here’s a freshly ripped version of this quirky minimal synth/post-punk hybrid from 1981.\n\nThis particular LP actually serves as a nice companion to the VHF lp. Quirky synths, minimal beats, and a strange connection to bands like Devo, Voice Farm, and Futurisk. Of course, there’s a few duds along the way, but I especially am fond the first track. Minimal synth fans should recognize David Kane, one of the album’s main contributors. Better known as Quintronic, he’s the man responsible for the Trek w/ Quintronic LPs, which you can get over at Mutant Sounds. Kane was responsible for the electronic elements of the LP, while Kent Weber (of the Fems), played all guitars and effects. Terry Sullivan, the vocalist, has no other releases as far as I can tell.\n\nCelibates- A Shameless Fashion\n\n1. Coming Alone\n\n2. Keeping The Count\n\n3. Making Moves At Random\n\n4. Girls With Headphones\n\n5. Rap City (In Blue)\n\n6. She’s The One\n\n7. Reflex\n\n8. Whipped Cream Girls\n\n*download it here* (RE-RIPPED 8.17.17)\n\n(press photo courtesy of Greg)\n\nGlad to hear you’re all enjoying the last few posts so much! Moving right along, I have two posts slated for today, so bear with me. The first is something a little more well known, but no less fantastic. Actually, while this 12” isn’t exactly rare, I haven’t seen either of these mixes floating around in circulation before, so I’m pleased to offer them here.\n\nThere’s so much to be said about John Carpenter that I don’t quite know where to begin. Responsible for some of the best films in the horror genre, his scores also have earned huge notoriety over the years, influencing both ambient and electro music. While the score to Christine (based on Stephen King’s novel of the same name) is a more haunting, delicate affair, it’s the disco tracks and pulsing beats that really stand out to me. I included a mix of this track on the second Sequins and Spandex comp., a three minute mix that’s over before it truly begins, and has the unfortunate sound of a car engine revving throughout. Until I got this 12”, I never knew a car-less mix existed, let alone one that’s nearly double the length! The second mix is the one in question, while the first is an extended mix of the Sequins track… Both are performed by The Splash Band, who was responsible for doing a lot of these italo-infused dance mixes via the legendary ZYX label.\n\nWithout any further ado, here’s the info:\n\nThe Splash Band- Christine 12”\n\n1. Christine (Part 1)\n\n2. Christine (Part 2)\n\n*download it here*\n\nI was going to wait until Monday came to post this one up, but news travels fast, and a few people are already asking for it. Up on the slab we have one of the rarest new wave records in existence, the elusive VHF LP. Not to be confused with the heavy metal band of the same name (though the logo looks conspicuously like Van Halen), this particular EP has more in common with Speak and Spell era Depeche Mode, Erasure, and soulful synthpop in that vein.\n\nThis LP was released in the UK in 1984 on Pennine Records. A power pop single by Any Trouble was the label’s only other release. Coincidentally, VHF has a bit of a power pop vibe going for it, instead employing a slew of synth leads and drum machines in that minimal style we all love to get the job done. A curious mix, which generally works.\n\nThis doesn’t complete the VHF saga though… There’s a 7” out there for the title track, which I believe features an exclusive b-side. Maybe we’ll hear that one some day, but in the interim, here’s the info for this ‘holy grail’ of rare wave records:\n\nVHF- 1st Impressions LP\n\n1. The Peril Of Passion\n\n2. Let Me Fall\n\n3. Smile On Demand\n\n4. No Surprise\n\n5. I Know You Wanna Say Goodbye\n\n6. Don’t Call Me\n\n7. First Impressions\n\n8. Key To My Heart\n\n9. Our Love Is Undecided\n\n10. Mirage\n\n11. Counting The Days\n\n12. Replacement Heart\n\n*download it here*\n\nUp next we have a killer demo tape from Italian minimal synth band Atelier Du Mal. I’m usually not too fond of cassettes, as I find the sound quality to be very sub-par on the whole, but this one is a real gem. Barely sounds like a cassette, let alone a demo, for that matter!\n\nThis is the band’s only official release, though track two, ‘Back to Taiwan,’ has been reissued as part of the Crollo Nervoso DVD set, essential listening/viewing for fans of obscure Italian wave.\n\nEnough chatter, here’s the info:\n\nAtelier Du Mal- Noblesse Oblige Demo K7\n\n1. A Promise\n\n2. Back to Taiwan\n\n3. Another Kind of Madness\n\n4. Waiting for Someone\n\n5. Staticita\n\n6. Palau\n\n7. Marienbaad\n\n8. Decadence (Underground Life)\n\n*DOWNLOAD LINK REMOVED* – this tape has been reissued by Mannequin! Pick it up here.\n\nThat’s all for today (major treat coming soon- stay tuned), but I’d like to draw your attention to the De Press LP post from years past. Freshly re-uploaded, for those who missed out the first time. Thanks to all for keeping me on my toes!"
