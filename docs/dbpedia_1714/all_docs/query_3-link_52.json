        "text": "Peter Criss had a car accident in 1978 that injured him, thus he only played drums on \"Dirty Livin'\". Anton Fig was brought in to record the majority of the tracks. Of course, this wasn't announced at the time as KISS was still a perfect family in the fans' eyes and the band wanted to keep it that way.\n\nAnton Fig later went on to record with Frehley's Comet and became the regular drummer on Late Night with David Letterman.\n\nRichie Fontana plays drums on I Was Made For Lovin' You. \"Escape From Hell\" was the subtitle of Dynasty's Japanese release.\n\nIn the original album, a huge poster was included of the four KISS members, pictured below. Click on the image to view a larger image.\n\nThe cover of the Dynasty album is actually a collage of photos taken from the photo session, and not a group shot as it appears.\n\n'2,000 Man' was originally performed by The Rolling Stones on their 'Their Satanic Majesty's Request' album in 1967.\n\nKISS' manager, Howard Marks, co-wrote \"Charisma\" with Gene.\n\nGiorgio Moroder was originally scheduled to produce Dynasty. Moroder would later go on to fame as producer of the music in Flashdance as well as with Donna Summer.\n\nPaul plays bass and performs the guitar solo in 'Sure Know Something.' Paul also plays bass in 'I Was Made For Lovin' You.'\n\nAce plays all the instruments except the drums on '2,000 Man,' 'Hard Times' and 'Save Your Love.' Anton Fig handles the drums for these songs.\n\nDynasty was the last high-charting album by KISS for several years at #9 on Billboard's charts.\n\nRumor had it that Paul wrote 'I Was Made For Lovin' You' as a joke to prove how easy it was to write a disco song.\n\n\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" was KISS' first songwriting collaboration with Desmond Child, who would show up later on 'Animalize,' 'Asylum,' 'Crazy Nights,' 'Smashes, Thrashes & Hits,' and 'Hot In The Shade.'\n\nA third KISS/Marvel comic was supposed to be released in 1979 but was shelved after KISS found out Marvel wanted ownership of the KISS characters' copyrights.\n\nKiss in their new \"Dynasty\" costumes.\n\nThe Dynasty tour was the first to have Gene soar up to the rafters after his solo to perform 'God of Thunder.' This was done again on the reunion tour.\n\nPaul, still struggling to come up with an antic for his 'character,' like the other three members, had originally wanted a laser to appear to shoot out of his eye during the show but found out he could be permanently blinded if he tried it.\n\nThe band was planning to open an amusement park called KISS World at this time. KISS World would be all KISS, all the time, with KISS themed games, rides and memorabilia, but the cost turned out to be too great. To bad, that would have been a blast!\n\nA fateful appearance on Halloween 1979 on The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder saw an interview turn into mayhem when Peter and Ace overtook the proceedings from the usual conversation leaders, Paul and Gene. Ace was noticeably wasted, but was very charming and funny.\n\nThe Dynasty tour actually lost money due to poor ticket sales and an extravagant stage show (EACH concert cost nearly $1 million!).\n\nDuring a December 1979 show in Shreveport, Louisiana, Peter quit drumming in the middle of a show and KISS was forced to end the show early. The band was infuriated by Peter's actions. After the Dynasty tour was over, Peter announced his plans to the group that he was leaving. His last performance with KISS was on December 16, 1979.\n\n1979-1984 would be the hardest years of KISS's career as their popularity plummets and they lose a total of 4 members."
