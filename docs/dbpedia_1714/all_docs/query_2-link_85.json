        "text": "Maxwell has released his new single “Simply Beautiful,” a rendition of the classic Al Green song.\n\n“The first time I heard Al Green’s music I was amazed. He is such an icon, I mean what a brilliant musician and songwriter. It’s been an honor to get in the studio and record one of his songs. I’ve been singing ‘Simply Beautiful’ on tours for a while. It’s nice to finally record it, in its entirety,” states Maxwell.\n\nNext month Maxwell will kick off “The Serenade” tour on September 14th at Hard Rock Hollywood. The expansive 25+ date tour sees the soul singer returning to legendary arenas, such as Barclays Center in Brooklyn, Kia Forum in Los Angeles, and more.\n\nMaxwell will be joined by special guest two-time Grammy Award-winning R&B powerhouse Jazmine Sullivan and rising singer/songwriter October London.\n\nCheck out the new single and a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Maxwell‘s new single, “Simply Beautiful.” Maxwell shares his deep admiration for the iconic musician and songwriter."
