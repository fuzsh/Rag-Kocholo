        "text": "Micheal Ray Stevenson (born November 19, 1989), known professionally as Tyga (; a backronym for Thank You God Always), is an American rapper. After a number of independent releases, he signed a recording contract with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, an imprint of Cash Money Records and Republic Records in 2008. His major label debut, Careless World: Rise of the Last King (2012) peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and saw generally positive critical reception. It spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top 40 singles \"Rack City\" and \"Faded\" (featuring Lil Wayne). His third album, Hotel California (2013) was met with trailing critical and commercial response, along with his collaborative album, Fan of a Fan: The Album (2015) with singer Chris Brown.\n\nDue to disagreements with Young Money, Tyga's fourth album, The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty was released independently in June 2015. Executive-produced by Kanye West, it became his lowest-selling album to that point with estimated sales of 5,000 album equivalent units in its first week. His fifth and sixth albums, BitchImTheShit2 (2017) and Kyoto (2018) were met with continued stagnation. Following this, his May 2018 single, \"Taste\" (featuring Offset) marked a brief period of commercial resurgence, peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming his first top 40 single since \"Ayo\" (with Chris Brown) in 2015. It served as lead single and preceded the release of his seventh album, Legendary (2019).\n\nEarly life\n\nMichael Ray Nguyen-Stevenson was born in Compton, California, on November 19, 1989, and raised there until he \"was about 11, 12\", before moving to adjacent Gardena. He was born to Jamaican and Vietnamese parents. His mother was born in Vietnam and has the maiden name Nguyen. He grew up listening to Fabolous, Lil Wayne, Cam'ron and Eminem among many others.\n\nOn December 3, 2012, debate arose concerning Tyga's upbringing. Tyga claimed to have been brought up in the low socioeconomic area of Compton, but in leaked footage from the unaired television show Bustas, he claimed he grew up in a \"well-to-do\" home in the Valley, where his parents drove a Range Rover. He also claimed that he attained his nickname from his mother calling him Tiger Woods. There has been speculation that his claims on the show were satirical and not to be taken seriously. Tyga responded to the video's leak on Twitter: \"When u 14 an ambitious u don't give a fuk about anything. Scripted tv isn't that what we all live for. Hahahaha.\"\n\nCareer\n\n2007–2010: No Introduction and mixtapes\n\nTyga's career began with him releasing a multitude of demo tapes and mixtapes. His 2007 debut mixtape, Young On Probation, garnered the attention of fellow California rapper and Gym Class Heroes lead vocalist, Travie McCoy. Seeing talent in the young artist, McCoy offered him a record deal with the independent label DCD2 Records (known then as Decaydence Records). Tyga also formed the record label G.E.D. Inc. (Grinding every day, Getting every dollar, or Getting educated daily) around the time, the same imprint that helped launch the career of fellow West Coast rapper Schoolboy Q, with whom he's worked with early in his career. Tyga also has a G.E.D. Inc tattoo above his right eyebrow.\n\nOn June 10, 2008, Tyga released his debut independent album, No Introduction, on Decaydance Records. The album was preceded by the single \"Coconut Juice\", featuring McCoy. One of the songs from this album, \"Diamond Life\", was used in the video games Need for Speed: Undercover and Madden NFL 2009, as well as in the 2009 movie Fighting.\n\nIn late 2008, Tyga signed a new record deal with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, which was a subsidiary of Cash Money Records at the time. Tyga met Wayne at the 2008 VMA's, performing the remix of Fall Out Boy's \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\". He was first featured on the song \"Bedrock\" by Young Money soon after signing to the label. He later released the mixtape Fan of a Fan with singer Chris Brown and producers DJ Ill Will and DJ Rockstar. It features other artists such as Bow Wow, Lil Wayne, and Kevin McCall featured in several tracks. Four tracks are also accompanied by music videos. The track \"Deuces\" was released as the lead single of the mixtape and reached No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs by August 26, 2010. The track has also been nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The track, among others, was on the track list of Chris Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E.. Tyga also told MTV in an interview that the mixtape's production took just short of a week.\n\n2011–2012: Careless World: Rise of the Last King\n\nCareless World: Rise of the Last King was his second studio album. The album was released on February 21, 2012, on Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records, and Universal Republic Records. Careless World: Rise of the Last King is a move to the rapping style he featured in the collaboration album We Are Young Money rather than the poppy dance element exemplified on his previous effort, No Introduction. Tyga stated that the album shows he has grown up but still relates to the kids. In preparation for the album, Tyga released the mixtape #BitchImTheShit in December 2011.\n\nThe first official single, \"Far Away\", was released on May 17, 2011, and peaked at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. The second official single, \"Still Got It\", was released on October 4, 2011, and peaked at 89 on the Billboard Hot 100. The third official single, \"Rack City\", was released on December 6, 2011. It was originally listed on Tyga's Well Done 2 mixtape, and was added to the album after it gained commercial success. It debuted at number 94 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has peaked at number 8 since then. The fourth official single, \"Faded\", was released on January 13, 2012. It peaked on the Hot 100 at No. 33.\n\nTyga's sixth single, \"Do My Dance\" which features 2 Chainz was released on October 2, 2012, and peaked at No. 79 on the Billboard Hot 100. He has released various mixtapes such as well-acclaimed #BitchImTheShit and Well Done 3.\n\n2012–2013: Hotel California\n\nTyga's third studio album, Hotel California, was released on April 9, 2013. Tyga performed at Harvard University's Yardfest in the Spring of 2013, despite opposition from critics who've signed a petition seeking to keep him away over what they call his \"violently misogynistic lyrics\". At this time, Tyga collaborated with singer Sabi on her song \"Cali Love\".\n\nHotel California was released on April 9, 2013. The album featured guest appearances from Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Rick Ross, 2 Chainz, Game, Wiz Khalifa, Future and Jadakiss. Along with production by Cool & Dre, D. A. Doman, DJ Mustard, Detail, Mars of 1500 or Nothin', The Olympicks, and SAP among others. The album was supported by three official singles along with the promotional single \"Molly\". The album was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics. It also was less successful than his debut album commercially, debuting at number seven on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 54,000 copies in the United States.\n\n2013–2015: The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty\n\nMain article: The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty\n\nOn August 27, 2013, Tyga released a new single with DJ Mustard, \"Throw It Up\".
