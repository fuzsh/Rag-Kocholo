        "text": "Another month has passed. The fall season is approaching — unless you live in Los Angeles, which is pretending that it’s Phoenix in August. Fuck is up with that? It’s like that town has been placed in a cosmic microwave and the user likes his burritos very well done.\n\nOn the other hand, we’ve had way too many grey, chilly days in Seattle this September, which is traditionally one of the best months of the year. The weather gods have clearly dropped acid over the last 30 days and forgotten which end is up. But eventually they will get themselves straight, remember which season is approaching, and get ready to just blast the fuck out of our whole country with a vicious winter. Won’t that be fun?\n\nNo, it won’t be fun. It will suck like a new-born piglet at dinner time. But one pleasant constant will remain true — there will be new metal, regardless of how foul the weather becomes. And that brings us to another monthly installment of METAL IN THE FORGE, a forge being the old name for a place where a blacksmith heats metal and works it into the shape of something useful.\n\nAnd that’s what we’re interested in — new metal that will be useful in scrambling our brains, or uplifting us to a place where it really doesn’t matter what the fucking weather is doing.\n\nWhat we do in this series of posts is update the list of forthcoming new albums we first posted on January 1. (All the other updates can be found via the “Forthcoming Albums” category link on the right side of our pages.) Below is a list of still more projected new releases we didn’t know about at the time of our previous updates, or updated info about some of the previously noted releases.\n\nOnce again, we’ve cobbled together news blurbs from other sites, or from press releases, about bands whose past work we’ve liked, or who look interesting for other reasons. Perhaps needless to say, these are bands that mostly fit the profile of music we cover on this site — the kind that would like to tear your head off.\n\nSo, after the jump, in alphabetical order, you’ll find our list of cut-and-pasted items from various sources since our last update about forthcoming new releases.\n\nABRAXAS: “ABRAXAS, the new death metal band featuring Makoto Mizoguchi (PYREXIA, INTERNAL SUFFERING, HATE ETERNAL) on guitar and bass, Mike Hrubovcak (MONSTROSITY, VILE, DIVINE RAPTURE, I.C.E., AZURE EMOTE) on vocals and Lance Wright (VILE, QUINTA ESSENTIA, TEMPLE OF BLOOD) on drums, has completed work on its debut album, Damnation, due later in the year.”\n\nAGALLOCH: “Pacific Northwest band AGALLOCH will release its new album, Marrow Of The Spirit, on November 23 via Profound Lore Records. . . . At over an hour in length, Marrow Of The Spirit is AGALLOCH’s darkest, bleakest, most dense, detailed and aggressive album to date and in turn is the most accomplished album of their career.”\n\nATHEIST: “On November 9th, 2010, after 17 years the progressive aggressive forefathers reemerge more massive than ever. Atheist delivers Jupiter, a landmark return to earth of supersonically gargantuan proportions. In the late 80’s and early 90’s, this band, alongside fellow Floridians Death and Cynic, handcrafted the sub-genre that spawned bands such as Meshuggah, Between The Buried And Me, and Mudvayne.”\n\nBURNING THE MASSES: After multiple delays, Burning the Masses will release their new album, Offspring of Time, on November 9.\n\nCHILDREN OF BODOM: “CHILDREN OF BODOM recently entered Finland’s Petrax Studios to begin work on their as-yet-untitled seventh studio album.

Due in November/December, the CD was recorded between January and August 2010 and ‘perfectly captures the darkness and heaviness of the 10 songs there included, resulting in one of Finland’s heaviest albums ever,’ according to a press release. DESECRESY was formed in 2009 by Tommi Grönqvist (all instruments) and Jarno Nurmi (vocals), both whom previously played with the now-defunct Finnish act SLUGATHOR.”\n\nDIMENTIANON: “Paragon Records will unleash the third album from DIMENTIANON, New York’s masters of chaotic metal, on October 19.

The cover artwork was created by Xaay (BEHEMOTH, NILE, VADER) and it ‘fit[s] both the title, Apocalyptic, and our musical achievements just perfect,’ says the band. ‘We are blown away by the effort and feeling [Xaay] gave it.'”\n\nGENERAL CHAOS: “German metallers GENERAL CHAOS have inked a deal with Cyclone Empire Records. The band’s debut album, Calamity Circus, will be released on November 12. According to a press release, the CD ‘comes as a beautiful digipak with an awesome poster booklet and an artwork that shows a band and their love for detailed, humorous and cool artworks that never cross the border to all ludicrous or clownish crab and are 100% without any touch of stereotypes!'”\n\nGOD DETHRONED: “Dutch death metallers GOD DETHRONED have finished recording their ninth album, Under The Sign Of The Iron Cross, at the Soundlodge Studios in Leer, Germany. . . . Under The Sign Of The Iron Cross will be released on November 23 (one day earlier internationally) via Metal Blade Records.”\n\nGWAR: “Metal Blade Records has set a November 9 U.S. release date for GWAR‘s ‘newest and sickest’ album yet, Bloody Pit of Horror.”\n\nHORNED ALMIGHTY: “Danish black metallers HORNED ALMIGHTY will release their new studio album, Necro Spirituals, in Europe on October 25 via Candlelight Records. Recorded in May-June 2010 and mixed and mastered by Jacob Bredahl (HATESPHERE, KOLDBORN) at Dead Rat Studios, the CD is ‘comprised of the strongest and most fierce material written in the band’s eight-year existence,’ according to a press release. ‘Yet again, crushing all doctrines and rules with their ‘don’t-give-a-shit’ take on black metal, as a testament to all that is extreme.'”\n\nTHE INIQUITY DESCENT: “Vocalist Mathias ‘Vreth’ Lillmåns of Finnish folk metallers FINNTROLL has launched a brand new extreme-metal project called THE INIQUITY DESCENT. The band recently spent time in the studio recording 11 songs, four of which will make up the group’s debut release.

The group’s debut EP, Anthems, will be released on November 9.\n\nMESSENGERS pulled no punches this year when it charged onto the Dallas heavy music scene. In the band’s own words, they ‘just want to be heard,’ and playing music in the vein of CROWBAR, PANTERA and AGNOSTIC FRONT will get the job done.”\n\nMIRROR OF DECEPTION: “Germany’s ‘doom metal kings’ MIRROR OF DECEPTION will release their fourth album, A Smouldering Fire, on October 15 via Cyclone Empire. It will be available in two versions: a regular CD and a digipack containing the The First 2 Decades bonus CD.”\n\nNEBULAS FROST: “German/Swedish black metal combo NEBULAS FROST has uploaded its two-song ‘promo 2010’ to the band’s MySpace page.
