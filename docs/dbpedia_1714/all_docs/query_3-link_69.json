        "text": "In 2019, MJF, Richard Holliday, and Alex Hammerstone formed The Dynasty in MLW.\n\nThe group didn't have a long run as MJF signed with AEW in 2019, but the group is still talked about today and when MJF recently needed help on AEW programming, Holliday and Hammerstone were names mentioned amongst fans as potential backup for the former AEW World Champion.\n\nSpeaking to Jeremy Lambert & Joel Pearl on In The Weeds, Holliday commented on the Dynasty's run.\n\n\"This is my diagnosis of The Dynasty. We were like a rock band that released an LP and was never put on a huge platform for a long time. We released one LP, one album, whatever you want to call it, and it was a massive hit and people just want more and more and more. We never released album after album after album like these long-tenured factions that you see. People still listen to the music. They're still listening and they're like, 'we want another album of this.' It just holds up. It's held up the test of time. I'm proud of what we did, it's awesome that people still talk about it,\" he said.\n\nHolliday remains with MLW while MJF is healing up from injury in AEW and Hammerstone is a free agent.\n\nHolliday will challenge Alex Kane for the MLW World Heavyweight Title at MLW Kings of Colosseum.\n\nElsewhere during the interview, Holliday commented on his return to MLW. You can find his full comments by clicking here.\n\nFightful will have coverage of the event on January 6. Fans can order the event on Triller TV.\n\nFans can watch the full interview with Holliday in the video above."
