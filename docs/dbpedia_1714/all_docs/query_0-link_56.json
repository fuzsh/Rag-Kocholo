        "text": "Back in 2003, Kiss released, okay, the record company released a greatest hits compilation called The Millennium Collection: The Best of Kiss (1973-1979). It was the first of three volume set. Well, then in 2010, the label issued the ‘Icon’ Series with two volumes. The first volume is the exact same track list as ‘The Millennium Collection: The Best of Kiss’. There is nothing different to it at all except for crappier cover art and no inserts/liner notes. A very bare bones set. I do not recommend any of these sets as they weren’t done by Kiss per se.\n\nHowever, as the collector in me, I do have the brand new, first time on vinyl version of Icon as Walmart has just released an Exclusive Silver Black Splatter vinyl. And since I collect everything vinyl for Kiss, I had to have it for my collection wouldn’t be complete. Okay, my collection is not complete anyway as I am missing a couple pieces that are extremely pricey, but that is for another time.\n\nFor now, let us go through this set and talk about the songs since we are here.\n\nSIDE ONE:\n\nThe album kicks off with the first song of their debut, “Strutter”. The song was written by both Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons and over the years, this would be a rare experience as they would wind up writing songs by themselves. The music of the song was based off an old Gene song called “Stanley the Parrot” which was recorded even before there was a Wicked Lester. The song has a great opening drum fill by Peter and is an uptempo rock song that was inspired by all the sexy women in New York. There is a great bass riff by Gene why Ace belts out the solo. Paul sings the song and shows all the confidence a lead singer should show.\n\n“Deuce” is up next and also from the debut album. The song was written and sung by Gene and he doesn’t even know what the song actually means. He just thought it sounded good…and he was right. The opening line, “Get Up and get your Grandma out of here” is the best opening line. This is one of those songs that live sounds so much cooler and has more grit, but this is still awesome. The guitar playing is fantastic and Ace plays a killer solo to end the song. Peter lays down some nice fills and gives the song a great fast tempo beat that drives the song along.\n\n“Hotter Than Hell”, from the album of the same name, was written by Paul and another song he stole from somewhere else. This one is basically a re-write of the Free song “All Right Now” and you can hear that Free influence in it. The song is about picking up a woman in a bar and having your way and it turns out she’s married which burns you like the midday sun. Oh, good times. To keep with the Japanese theme, the song has Peter hitting a giant gong for added affect.\n\nThings keep getting better with another classic Paul Stanley song called “C’mon and Love Me” which is from the album ‘Dressed to Kill’. This song also gives Paul his first solo on a Kiss song and it is worth noting as it is wonderful. The song has a rock and pop feel and is catchy as hell with the help of Gene on those backing vocals. I love the line “She’s a dancer, a romancer, I’m a Capricorn and she is a Cancer” because Paul is not a Capricorn he’s Aquarius. So, basically he is lying to us. The second single on the album and only charted to #…who am I kidding, it didn’t chart.\n\nThen we get to the song that started it all for the band. The start to superstardom was because of “Rock & Roll All Nite” and the live version from the smash album ‘Alive!’. This is now their signature song and it is easy to see why. It is a pure rock anthem like no other. Now, it has been overplayed and I am truly sick of it and don’t care if I ever hear it again, but let’s be honest…it is a fantastic and amazing song to be played Live!!\n\n“Detroit Rock City” is up next and this is the Single Version not the album version from ‘Destroyer’. The original song was so different than anything they had done prior, musically and lyrically. They took a chance shaking things up a bit and it worked. The single version pretty much cuts out the opening bit of the boy getting in the car and all the car parts as well as the crash. The song does mention Detroit, but is really about a young fan that is killed why he was on his way to a Kiss concert. The story is based off an actual event that occurred outside a Kiss concert in Charlotte where a fan was hit by a car and killed outside the arena. Knowing it is based a real life event adds a little extra to the impact of the song.\n\nSIDE 2:\n\nSide two kicks off with “Beth” , also from ‘Destroyer’, which became one of the band’s biggest hits to date. It went all the way to #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was sung by Peter Criss. The song was one Peter had written prior to Kiss and written with guitarist Stan Penridge. The song is a ballad and played on piano by Bob Ezrin, with full backing orchestration by the New York Philharmonic. The song originally had the line “Beck what can I do” after the girlfriend of one of Peter’s bandmates in the band Chelsea. Of course, they changed to Beth which seem to work. The song was softly played and softly sung and was simply a beautiful song that was totally out of left field for the band up to this point.\n\nNow after the success of “Beth”, Peter was given another ballad to sing and I am sure it was in hopes of repeating that magic. This song, “Hard Luck Woman” from ‘Rock And Roll Over’, was written by Paul and Paul had written so Rod Stewart could sing and when listening to the track, I could hear Rod singing this. Paul was talked in to giving it to Peter and although the song did do as well as “Beth”, it still gave the band another Top 20 hit. It is mostly acoustic and Peter does a great job and delivers a sweet song. I also think Peter’s vocals fit the song as they give it some grit and an extra added layer of emotion. A nice change of pace on an album that has a lot of rock songs…this maybe should’ve been placed earlier to break things up a bit more but who am I to say anything.\n\n“Calling Dr. Love” is the first of four Gene songs on the ‘Rock And Roll Over’. The song stems from a Gene song called “Bad Bad Lovin’” which you can hear in many forms on Gene Simmons ‘The Vault’ (click links below). It is a heavy song and Gene sounds as menacing as ever. This is one of his signature songs. Interesting to note, on the backing vocals, you can hear Katy Sagal from Married With Children and Sons of Anarchy. Of course she wasn’t famous at this point.\n\nNow we get ot one of the band’s most iconic songs, “Love Gun” from the album of the same name. That barrage of drum hits by Peter are so recognizable that the second you hear, you know what you are getting. When Peter does that barrage towards the end and then Ace comes in with a mini solo, it is magical. If the bass sounds a little different, that is because Paul handles those duties. The song is still played live today and at almost every show since its release. Paul has stated that the song was inspired by “The Hunter” by Booker T. & the MG’s but I believe performed by Albert King. The song does mention a “love gun”.\n\nThe next song was the first single off Love Gun’, “Christine Sixteen”. Now this song wouldn’t fly today as it is an older man going after a much younger woman at only 16. But at the time, no one thought anything about it. Heck, they did this before with “Goin’ Blind’ off the ‘Hotter Than Hell’ album. There is a cool piano riff in the song which was done by Eddie Kramer. It is a fun, upbeat track and a favorite of mine for Gene. A cool, fun fact about the song, the demo was done with Gene and two unknown artist at the time by the name of Eddie and Alex Van Halen. They also did the demo for “Got Love For Sale” and you can hear those demos on Gene Simmons ‘The Vault”.\n\nThen we jump past Alive II and the solo albums all the way to ‘Dynasty’. The opening track and first single was “I Was Made For Lovin’ You”. The song was written by Paul Stanley, Vini Poncia and the great Desmond Child makes his first of many appears with the band (only one on this album). The story goes that Disco was really big at the time and the record company wanted the band to be a little more commercial. Paul thought any idiot could write a disco song and a bet was made and a few hours later, the song was written and the Paul proved his point. The song went to #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. And as I mentioned earlier, the result was people thought this was a disco album. Wrong!! This song did have every trapping of a disco song, the tempo, the beat, the pop sound, the disco sound effects…I mean it was disco…but it was good and it was catchy and they still play it, but I still don’t know if I can give it full marks. Now on a side note, this is Gene’s least favorite song (and Peter and Ace hate it too).\n\nAnd that is all folks. I know, you are heart broken, but no more songs on this album. As far as Compilation albums go, it is pretty basic. Nothing really cool and a ton of songs omitted that should be on a Kiss Greatest Hits album. But it is what it is and that is a cheap, low cost simply basic compilation. It is made for those fans who aren’t really fan, but just want a little set of their hits, probably because they like “Beth” or “Rock And Roll All Nite”. And this would fit that bill. For me, this is really skippable unless you are a collector. My Overall Score is a 1.0 out of 5.0 Stars for the set. Now, the vinyl version has a cool splatter so maybe I’d give it a 2.0 out of 5.0. But that is it. Thanks for hanging around.\n\nI do want to apologize as these pictures are not my copy of the vinyl. My copy is still sealed and I have no intention of opening it since this is a crappy compilation. I had to steal the pictures from Walmart’s website.\n\nThe Kiss Review Series:\n\nWicked Lester and the Progeny Demo Sessions (Bootleg)\n\nKiss – Kiss (1974)\n\nKiss – Hotter Than Hell (1974)\n\nKiss – Dressed to Kill (1975)\n\nKiss – Alive!
