Wavves\n\nKing of the Beach\n\n[Fat Possum]\n\nWhen Nathan Williams served up his new Wavves LP in August, it didn't seem like much time had passed since his insanely blown-out album just a year earlier. Inadvertently or not, Williams had become a polarizing figure in the indie world, and it seemed like he'd never really gone away. And he was definitely listening: Williams, alongside Billy Hayes and Stephen Pope-- Jay Reatard's former rhythm section-- gave their new set of songs their studio due, and the result is an intelligible, self-flagellating, high-fiving jaunt into pop-punk whose punch suggested Williams was brushing all that dirt off his shoulder. On his spinning piledriver of a single \"Post Acid\", the SoCal lifer sings in search of some grounding while on a bad trip: \"I'm just having fun with you.\" That's all this was ever meant to be. -- David Bevan\n\n49. Wild Nothing\n\nGemini\n\n[Captured Tracks]\n\nA joint partnership between Virginia's Jack Tatum and the 1980s, Wild Nothing started the year in obscurityand ended it as a residue of a lot of people's Indian summers. Perhaps that's because, like the music Gemini so lovingly references (the Go-Betweens, the Cure, Slowdive, and, above all else, Cocteau Twins), there's an easy warmth and and magnanimity to its songs. From the classic indie-pop shuffle of opener \"Live in Dreams\" to the 4AD-friendly psychedelia of \"Summer Holiday\" to the gloriously carefree gallop of \"Chinatown\", every single one of these songs feels like a window opening. 2010 was a banner year for fans of reverb, but for all the dreamy, swoony, swooshy, shoegazey confections to waft out of speakers over the past 12 months, few were as achingly gorgeous or as effortlessly evocative as this. --Mark Pytlik\n\n48. Forest Swords\n\nDagger Paths\n\n[Olde English Spelling Bee / No Pain in Pop]\n\nForest Swords-- the alias of Liverpool's Matthew Barnes-- was one of a number of acts in 2010 to attempt a critical reconsideration of goth, mining the music for its dread but setting aside any element of camp. Signed to New York's Olde English Spelling Bee, Forest Swords was often mentioned in the same breath as American acts like Salem and Balam Acab, but his sluggish tempos and general sense of resignation have more in common with England's Demdike Stare and Raime, while his dislocated dub and spindly, post-punk guitar lines echo Germany's Anika. Meanwhile, the influence of Seefeel, from neighboring Sheffield, can be heard all over Forest Swords' approach to space. (Taking those points of reference into account, Forest Swords' gloom seems more timely than merely trendy.) Dagger Paths can't ever be mistaken for anyone else, either, thanks to the jagged dovetailing of machine beats and trad, slightly stunted rock arrangements, and the way delay feedback and distended voices go rippling across the surface of it all. Only 34 minutes long, all of it spent lingering in a kind of delectable despair, it's the perfect mood piece: single-minded, but never running out of ideas. --Philip Sherburne\n\n47. Women\n\nPublic Strain\n\n[Jagjaguwar]\n\nThere's irony in the title of Women's second album, and not just the retrospective irony considering the onstage fight that cut their fall tour short. At first, Public Strain sounds private and subdued-- a mix of distant meditations and loose basement jams. But as the album progresses, things get more complicated. The repetition of \"China Steps\" is tense, the tightly wound guitar grind of \"Drag Open\" has a cutting wind chill, and even the Feelies-style strum of \"Locust Valley\" bears an insistent pulse. So when you listen to it all again, the first half sounds not so much mellow as pregnant with foreboding. In the mp3 age, making an album whose beginning depends on its end is a daring trick, but Women pulled it off on Public Strain, a looping cycle of songs that neatly inform each other. --Marc Masters\n\n46. Matthew Dear\n\nBlack City\n\n[Ghostly]\n\nThey call it Black City for a reason. It a place where Matthew Dear gets to leave his other guises behind. Gone is the minimalist guru and the good-natured synth-pop experimenter, replaced by a pervert, a bank robber, a manic kidnapper. Dear plays all those roles and more on his fourth and best long-player. It's a concept album where the concept is nothing more (or less) than our deepest depravities set to a skulking funk to which the Thin White Duke would nod approvingly. This is what Trent Reznor has spent much of the past 10 years trying to accomplish-- an album that balances sophistication, studio know-how, and a woozy evil into something your nightmares could dance to. So it's not too surprising when Dear takes Reznor's \"Closer\" pulse out for a moonless 4 a.m. test drive on \"You Put a Smell on Me\". With Black City, Dear offers a precisely thought-out guide to losing your mind. --Ryan Dombal\n\n45. Gil Scott-Heron\n\nI'm New Here\n\n[XL]\n\nOn his first album in 16 years, Gil Scott-Heron takes the measure of his life and finds that the pain of regret is not enough to kill his pride in the man he has become. The album followed drug problems and imprisonment, but he emerges clear-eyed from his tribulations, and late-life masterwork I'm New Here stands comfortably with the best of his 1970s material. Scott-Heron's ability to probe the darkness without surrendering to it is balanced by the music, a stunning electro-blues concoction that sounds less modern than futuristic. At the center is his voice, and whether he's singing out in a baritone blues croak or speaking calmly about his childhood in Jackson, Tennessee, with his grandmother, it has weathered to become an enthralling instrument. --Joe Tangari\n\n44. Kylesa\n\nSpiral Shadow\n\n[Season of Mist]\n\nThere's a whole lot of great psych-metal coming out of Georgia and its surrounding areas these days: Mastodon, Baroness, Withered, Black Tusk. And on Spiral Shadow, two-drummer Savannah monster squad Kylesa tower above all of them, heroes among heroes. Kylesa's Static Tensions was one of 2009's best metal albums-- a roiling, spitting, heaving beast of an album that never let up in its Southern sludge-boogie, hardcore fury. The grimy riffs hit just as hard on the follow-up, but the band also widens its scope, getting more downright melodic than anyone expected. Middle Eastern-tinged guitar flourishes whiz by, the grooves slow and deepen, and co-leader Phillip Cope occasionally allows himself the sort of staggering, psych-damaged guitar solo that recalls Built to Spill's Doug Martsch way more than Slayer's Kerry King. Increasingly, the band's Laura Pleasants steps to the front, her head-spun wail offering terrific counterpoint to Cope's scraggly roar. And at the center of everything sits \"Don't Look Back\", the sort of triumphantly bleary alt-rock anthem that we almost never get to hear anymore. --Tom Breihan\n\n43. Tame Impala\n\nInnerspeaker\n\n[Modular]\n\nThere couldn't have been a less sexy M.O. for 2010 than Tame Impala's. Instead of Pet Sounds, their psychedelic lodestone is Magical Mystery Tour; the Australian band's 60s-inspired rock is plenty chill, but never wavey, witchy, or anything else too du jour. In fact, their unapologetic retro yen feels almost anachronistic, in a year when nostalgia was often filtered through digital effects and technological affect. That's not to say that it isn't a laboriously (and thrillingly) produced album, thanks in part to the mixing of Dave Fridmann, a veteran producer who has worked with the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, and MGMT, among others. The froth on their fuzzboxes and buzz of their Humbuckers is never anything less than perfect; like all good stoners, they know that texture is as important as riffs. They just happen to have both in spades. There aren't a ton of stand-out songs-- the cathedral reverb, narrowly filtered vocals, and ringing harmonies do tend to blur together. But they change up keys, tempos, and rhythms enough to keep it interesting. More than that, Tame Impala always keep you on your toes, no matter how many times you think you've heard the song-- by them or any other artist. --Philip Sherburne\n\n42. Drake\n\nThank Me Later\n\n[Young Money Entertainment]\n\nEvery so often, hip-hop locates an artist who causes listeners to vehemently choose sides yet still sells a ton of records. Thank Me Later did that with Drake. Why did some people take to it? Well, I could bring up Drake's impeccable ear for beats, the pristine sequencing, or even the endearing goofiness of the lyrics, but ultimately his charm can be summed up in one line from \"Over\": \"What am I doing? That's right, I'm doing me.\" Chris Rock once joked that \"Mo Money, Mo Problems\" was the most popular song almost nobody could relate to, and Drake's greatest accomplishment is making the same case-- that someone who has everything would trade it for a dorm room and his mother's happiness. But while Drake's personal life is undoubtedly inextricable from Thank Me Later, you don't need to be a celebrity to relate to it-- just someone who's ever felt dissatisfied with society's idea of success. --Ian Cohen\n\n41. Delorean\n\nSubiza\n\n[True Panther]\n\nIn the past couple of years, the term \"Balearic\" has been associated with almost any sort of easygoing, luxe electronic music. It's good to remember, then, that islands like Ibiza have, for a long time, been a more moneyed, European version of the Jersey Shore. This beach culture-- and its arms-in-the-air parties featuring breakneck trance and piano-led house-- is the sonic inspiration for much of Subiza. Delorean don't seem at all ashamed of this background (see their blog) but nevertheless they've turned it into something less uncouth and more manageable-- like this feeling can be a part of your life without having to accept broad declarations of youth and escapism as some of sort of philosophy. So it's pop music, roughly. --Andrew Gaerig\n\n40. Abe Vigoda\n\nCrush\n\n[Bella Union / Post Present Medium]\n\nBack when Skeleton came out in 2008, Abe Vigoda were the teen phenoms of L.A.'s punky Smell scene. With their shouted vocals and tropical-punk riffs, the Chino, California-bred quartet gave every show, no matter what the venue, the clumsy energy of the coziest living-room gig. But Crush, the band's fourth full-length, finds them shooting for a different kind of intimacy-- the sound of romance circa 1980. It's a lush record, awash in woozy synths, reverb, and effect-heavy guitars. Singer Michael Vidal is finished yelling. Now he's a crooner with deep Ian McCulloch-worthy pipes. On tracks like \"Dream of My Love (Chasing After You)\" and \"Beverly Slope\" the band's vintage goth-rock fetish, only barely suppressed on previous efforts, finally breaks to the fore. --Aaron Leitko\n\n39. Best Coast\n\nCrazy For You\n\n[Mexican Summer]\n\nFor an album of such modest intent-- girls meets boy, girl loses boy, girl locks herself in bedroom and pines over him for all of eternity-- it's remarkable that Crazy For You became such a polarizing artifact, the simplicity of its execution seemingly matched only by the divisive discourse surrounding it. But whether you think Bethany Cosentino's boy-crazy jangle-pop mash notes sound timeless or tired, classic or clich√©d, you can't deny her sense of commitment-- her unwavering attempts to evoke that sense of disappointment in staring at a phone that never rings practically transforms Crazy For You into the world's first accidental concept album. And snicker all you want at Cosentino's remedial rhymes (miss/kiss, crazy/lazy, friend/end, etc.), but, as the swoon-worthy chorus of \"ooohs\" on \"When the Sun Don't Shine\" attests, her siren of a voice can sell a song without any words at all. --Stuart Berman\n\n38. Rick Ross\n\nTeflon Don\n\n[Maybach]\n\nIn Jay-Z's recent hip-hop tome Decoded, he writes, \"every hustler knows the value of a feint.\" Right now, Rick Ross must be the king of such disguises. He's one-time drug trafficker Freeway Ricky Ross one minute, then MC Hammer the next, then John Lennon, then Chicago gangster Larry Hoover. This from a guy who used to work as a correctional officer and has never had a platinum album or even a Top 10 single. He's hardly the coke-peddling tycoon he makes himself out to be, but that's more than OK because his \"larger than life\" sound is bigger and more decadent and stunningly gaudy than anyone else's. Listening to Teflon Don is like watching \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" in a gold bathtub while eating a $1,000 steak and texting your jeweler about that Russian doll neck piece that features two iced-out likenesses of your own head.\n\nSince Jay-Z actually went through some of the drug-dealing exploits he raps about, even his flossiest rhymes are riddled with consequences, regrets, reality checks. Perhaps due to his lack of real-life experience, Ross does not worry about such things. When he groans on opener \"I'm Not a Star\", he sounds like Goliath awakening from a restless slumber. He's huge enough to make MC Hammer a boast in 2010. Big enough to attract the likes of Kanye West, Erykah Badu, Diddy, and Jay-Z himself, who signed him to Def Jam in 2006. Exaggerated delusion is Rick Ross' art, and he's become quite the master. --Ryan Dombal\n\n37. Zola Jesus\n\nStridulum EP\n\n[Sacred Bones]\n\nConventional wisdom says that when Zola Jesus aka Nika Danilova releases her next LP, it'll be the one that rockets her into dark music superstardom (whatever that means). Only thing is, she's already planted that flag with the cathartic and bleak but gorgeous Stridulum EP. Prior to this record, her powerful voice was buried in tangled guitar murk, but on these six songs she ratchets up the intensity, cuts out any hiss, and sings to friends and lovers with grandiose conviction wise beyond her years. Songs like \"I Can't Stand\" pair an intensely beautiful industrial pulse with Danilova's thick, rounded voice towering above the entire world, making lyrics like, \"I can't stand to see you this way,\" sound not like empty comfort, but, impossibly, like rock solid assurance from a complete stranger. --Sam Hockley-Smith\n\n36. Emeralds\n\nDoes It Look Like I'm Here?\n\n[Editions Mego]\n\nEmeralds were a little tricky this year. After 2009's way-far-out What Happened, you expected the Ohio drone aesthetes to launch even crazier cosmic blastoffs, but instead they toned things down and went more ambient. That lessened their initial wow-factor some, but ultimately gave the record longer legs. Alongside guitarist Mark McGuire's excellent solo effort, Does It Look Like I'm Here? became the year's go-to zone-out soundtrack, the album to reach for when other avant-noise LPs felt too abrasive. Even when muted, the band's head-spinning moments were still very much present: check the oscillating synth patterns of 12-minute centerpiece \"Genetic\", constantly unfurling and re-spooling around the extended guitar lines at the song's core. Magnify certain moments like this, or let the whole thing just wash over you. --Joe Colly\n\n35. Gorillaz\n\nPlastic Beach\n\n[Virgin]\n\nFew albums this year have done such a striking job of wringing appeal out of deep-rooted melancholy as the third record by Gorillaz, who have been freed from the group's cartoon-band constraints to provide Damon Albarn's deftest work of pop modernism in the past decade. At its peaks-- the blissfully tense electro-funk of \"Stylo\", the longing pop-house of \"On Melancholy Hill\", the title track's Morricone-meets-Moroder spaghetti western new wave-- Plastic Beach provides the thrills of hooky, well-crafted pop with a feeling of baroque dejection. And its sleek production is craftily undercut with a cast of voices that mutter wearily (Mark E. Smith on \"Glitter Freeze\"; Lou Reed on \"Some Kind of Nature\"), belt heartachingly (Bobby Womack on \"Stylo\" and \"Cloud of Unknowing\"), lonesomely serenade (Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano on \"Empire Ants\" and \"To Binge\")-- or, as Albarn does more compellingly than he has in ages, wail with a haunting ennui. --Nate Patrin\n\n34. Crystal Castles\n\nCrystal Castles\n\n[Last Gang / Universal Motown]\n\nCrystal Castles are a standoff kind of band. Run-ins with security and fans, as well as plagiarism accusations made for an uneasy build-up to an already tough task of following up a debut album that defined a fleeting subgenre. The band approached the challenge with the same ethos of their live show-- diving in at the deep end, lead single \"Doe Deer\" provoking the haters with its bombed-out fury. It turned out to be a sleight of hand for one of the most surprising successes of the year. On this year's Crystal Castles, the band hammered the spectral shapes of the first album into something with focus and menace. It also had a heart, \"Celestica\" and \"Empathy\" proving to be two unexpectedly warm moments. It goes some way toward gathering up the shitstorm and blowing it into the distance. --Hari Ashurst\n\n33. The Tallest Man on Earth\n\nThe Wild Hunt\n\n[Dead Oceans]\n\nFour years after releasing his self-titled debut EP, the Tallest Man on Earth is still rambling around, changing up his Spartan sound just enough to make each new release distinctive. Drawing inspiration from the wilderness, The Wild Hunt may be his best and most refined album to date, full of songs that sound like he dug them out of the earth, still caked with dirt and fossils. The rare extroverted folkie, Kristian Matsson plays and sings loud, projecting outward instead of inward, as if to fill the entire valley with music. Rather than exhaust the possibilities of his voice and rambunctious guitar playing, The Wild Hunt finds new variations in the combination of these two basic elements, toggling between Dylan and Dock Boggs, rural and urban, outraged and pensive. And then there's the twist ending you never see coming: \"Kids on the Run\" switches from his trusty guitar to a wobbly tuned piano for a power ballad about adolescent angst, which does in three minutes what the Arcade Fire do in a full album. As gorgeous and lonely and conspiratorial as it may be, the song more crucially points the way to subtly new permutations of the Tallest Man sound, as if Matsson has so many new canyons and passes to explore. --Stephen M. Deusner\n\n32. Tyler, the Creator\n\nBastard\n\n[self-released]\n\nAfter a few decades of murders and crack deals, gangsta rap bloodthirst has lost a lot of its sting. But here we have a teenage skate-rat snarling in a demonic, asthma-wrecked rasp, talking about rape and dismemberment and coke-snorting and throwing in homophobic slurs, and suddenly every wound is fresh again. Bastard is a rough listen, to be sure; if you can hear it without wincing every 30 seconds or so-- without feeling some genuine despair-- you might have some serious problems of your own. But as with the most successful transgressive art, its ugliness digs deep into your brainpan and stays there.\n\nAnd only some of the value here is of the shock variety. Tyler's nihilistic gargle has cathartic star-power the same way DMX's livewire grunt once did, and many of the antisocial jokes are genuinely funny: \"I go to Obama rallies screaming out 'McCain!'\" The self-produced, spaced-out, lo-fi beats transform warped, woozy skronk-noise into rap thump. Ariel Pink is a favorite of Tyler's, and it shows. In all its violent weirdness, Bastard forms its own universe, and he doesn't do it without context. At the end of the opening title track, Tyler lets us know exactly where all this animosity might come from: \"Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email/ So I can tell him how much I fuckin' hate him in detail.\" --Tom Breihan\n\n31. Woods\n\nAt Echo Lake\n\n[Woodsist]\n\nIf last year's Songs of Shame proved Woods could stand among their peers on the Woodsist roster, At Echo Lake finds the Brooklyn band (headed by Woodsist founder Jeremy Earl) rising above them. In addition to Earl's deeply affecting songwriting not skipping a beat, the arrangements are significantly more expansive, hosting an entire world of musical ideas in their slender 29 minutes. Sounds, samples, and solos hover above, float through, and oscillate underneath the most stylistically varied collection of songs Earl has penned over the course of several albums: Distorted rumbling underscores dark acoustic ballad \"Pick Up\", while lively instrumental \"From the Horn\" is bolstered by a backwards guitar solo. Best of all is the eerie \"Death Rattles\", where Earl softly sings, \"God only knows, just to be by your side/ I would be there all night, I would be there all right,\" a devotional as chilling as it is lovelorn. Woodsist has released quite a few good albums over the years (including some by Woods themselves), but At Echo Lake is a record so stunning it deserves to have its entire name run across its label's banner. --Martin Douglas\n\n30. The-Dream\n\nLove King\n\n[Def Jam]\n\nBelieve all the sexual boasting on Love King, and you'd think Terius Nash aka The-Dream is the world's horniest guy, the self-proclaimed \"last romantic\" who will steal your girl and please her in ways she never thought possible. Funny thing is, Nash seems more like a studio nerd than anything else, with production gifts rivaling the Neptunes and Timbaland before him and an ability to pack tracks like \"Nikki Pt. 2\" with layered melodies without even the help of a traditional chorus. On his third full-length, Nash blows up his futuristic R&B sound bigger than ever before, stringing together carnal ballads and sturdy bangers like \"Yamaha\", the best Prince song since 1992. Frankly, the last thing other R&B producers should be worried about is their girlfriends. --Joe Colly\n\n29. The Fresh & Onlys\n\nPlay It Strange\n\n[In the Red]\n\nWhen someone tells me an album has no bad songs, I get dubious-- not about the claim, but about how ambitious a record that avoids failure could be. Well, there's not a bad song on Play It Strange, and yet there's ambition all over it. The Fresh & Onlys' mix of Buddy Holly melody, Byrds twang, and beatific joy might seem conservatively retro, in line with the garage leanings of San Francisco comrades Thee Oh Sees, the Mantles, and Sonny & the Sunsets. But the band constantly stretches those parameters, whether in the sprawling, eight-minute \"Tropical Island Suite\", the bombast of \"Who Needs a Man\", or a deceptively dark opener ironically titled \"Summer of Love\". So while it's fair to call Play It Strange a non-stop hit parade, the Fresh & Onlys deserve just as much credit for shooting at tons of different targets. --Marc Masters\n\n28. The National\n\nHigh Violet\n\n[4AD]\n\nIn 2005, the National were a band struggling for recognition, drunkenly and desperately clinging to a shit-kicking vitality while staring down deadening day jobs. Perhaps that's why they named their next album Boxer, but on High Violet, they've fought their way to the top only to turn their struggles inward. \"Terrible Love\", \"Bloodbuzz, Ohio\", and especially \"England\" are examples of a controlled turbulence that the National can now call their own. Every orchestral swell is rigorously planned and exactingly performed while Matt Berninger tries to reckon with the obligations of finances and family through the sort of hard-won wisdom and humor that one acquires only when abandoning the concern about losing one's edge as an aging male. See, that's the problem with using \"dad rock\" as a slur: You could stand to learn a lot from your old man. --Ian Cohen\n\n27. Four Tet\n\nThere Is Love in You\n\n[Domino]\n\nElectronic musicians don't really wear corduroy blazers and go alt-country, so they rarely get called \"mature,\" but There Is Love in You is a mature album. Hebden seems to have learned a lot in recent years: from his former schoolmate Burial, as a resident DJ at London's Plastic People (a small basement venue/community that was nearly shut down), in his collaborations with jazz drummer Steve Reid (who died just two months after this record's release). Where Hebden's records used to accumulate sound-- jazz drums colliding with breakbeats, buzzing guitars, and insects-- There Is Love in You mostly organizes them. The rhythms are coiled and clenched, the guitars deliberate, the voices allotted space. There is inspired neatness, like an art gallery: Hebden knows the tension and depth that proper placement create. It's not a casting off of his youth-- remember your first apartment's disorder?-- so much as a reordering of priorities. If the record's title is an indication, it has helped him locate something. --Andrew Gaerig\n\n26. Twin Shadow\n\nForget\n\n[4AD / Terrible]\n\nLooking to the 1980s for inspiration has been common for quite a while, and Twin Shadow, with a serious taste for the analog synths and ticking electronic drums of new wave, can certainly be lumped with this trend. But George Lewis, Jr.'s debut proves to be more than a revisionist sum of its parts, held together tightly by an airy co-production job courtesy of Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor and an ear for a great hook. The record is steeped in heartbreak and longing, as the dewy-eyed sound of the New Romantics is filtered through the weathered gaze of someone trying to forget. As Lewis sings on standout track \"Slow\", \"I don't wanna believe/ Or be in love.\" --Hari Ashurst\n\n25. Sufjan Stevens\n\nThe Age of Adz\n\n[Asthmatic Kitty]\n\nIn the time since 2005's beloved Illinois, Sufjan Stevens had released an album of outtakes, collected his Christmas music, and directed and scored an experimental film. But looming over these projects was a big question: When was he going to release the next proper album? The half-joke that he was going to do 50 albums about the 50 states had long stopped being repeated, but no competing ideas had taken hold. What would his new songs sound like? The All Delighted People EP earlier this year hinted at a change in direction, and then when The Age of Adz finally arrived, it turned out that he had delivered the perfect follow-up. It's an album built on earlier ideas that doesn't seem like a retread, and it also explores new thematic terrain. Taking a more personal tack with songs inspired in part by a long and serious illness, The Age of Adz infused the busy orchestration Stevens has become known for with a sparkly electronic sheen and featured bolder melodies and stronger vocals. Big-hearted, warm, and ambitious, the album felt immediately provocative even as it provided a sense of relief. It's also the kind of album that has a lot to explore and sounds better with every listen, so if Sufjan takes his time with the next one, this should hold us for a while. --Mark Richardson\n\n24. Hot Chip\n\nOne Life Stand\n\n[Astralwerks / Parlophone / EMI]\n\nAt first, all the straight-faced talk about wanting happiness and shining lovelights might make One Life Stand seem like an egregious misstep for the reliably frenetic Hot Chip. Sure, these recombinant pop mavens play up their more rambunctious side in public (as seen in Peter Serafinowicz's WTF video for \"I Feel Better\"), and their music's never less than enjoyable (as the title track and \"Hand Me Down Your Love\" can attest). It's their skirting of the line between profound and po-faced that makes One Life Stand so exhilarating; I doubt it's a mistake that the album's most affecting and emotional tune is titled \"Slush\". One wrong move, or one false note, and that's the sort of mess Hot Chip would've had on their hands. But there's no mistaking this album's heart-on-sleeve sincerity for anything less than completely genuine. --David Raposa\n\n23. Das Racist\n\nSit Down, Man\n\n[Mad Decent / Greedhead / Mishka]\n\nIf it were allowable, we could've just put \"everything Das Racist did this year\" in this slot. That'd cover Heems' Stereogum column dismantling the Indian minstrelsy of NBC's \"Outsourced\", their sardonic interview with The New York Times' Deborah Solomon (\"I would say we are proto-postworld pop\"), and their appearance on \"Our Show With Elliot Aronow\" where they called out Lady Gaga as \"clearly Illuminati.\" But the better of two excellent mixtapes is representative enough: Sit Down, Man saw Das Racist fine-tune their combination of comedic lyricism and genuine technique, graduating from smart(-ass) punchline rappers to high-concept agitators in the process. They pulled it off by taking their irreverent but on-point sociopolitical material and actually building cohesive tracks around it, backing it up with underground-icon guest spots (El-P, Roc Marciano), miles-deep rap-nerd jokes, and production nods ranging from Boi-1da and Devo Springsteen to Vijay Iyer and Enigma. For a crew that seems intent on sneaking their seriousness in undercover, they're not fucking around. --Nate Patrin\n\n22. Girls\n\nBroken Dreams Club EP\n\n[True Panther]\n\nGirls' 2009 debut, Album, was an instant classic, a blast of dizzy, wounded love from a band with an immediate, innate grasp of all things guitar-pop. But frontman Christopher Owens has had a rough life, and people with rough lives have a sad tendency to flame out early. It's easy to imagine Album being Girls' one great statement before the demons that helped Owens write his songs drowned his voice completely. So it's a great relief to hear Broken Dreams Club, a clear indication that this band is in it for the long haul. Broken Dreams Club comes from the same aesthetic universe as Album, but it's relaxed to the point of languor. Old-school Nashville pedal steel and crisp Cotton Club horns find their way in, and a warm oldies-radio vibe pervades. But we're still dealing with despair and hopelessness, and Owens still expresses this stuff in the most simple and direct terms possible: \"When I said that I loved you, honey, I knew it from the very start/ When I said that I loved you, honey, I knew that you would break my heart.\" At the center of it all sits \"Carolina\", a lazy sprawl that takes the band's own \"Hellhole Ratrace\" to a more peaceful place. --Tom Breihan\n\n21. The Walkmen\n\nLisbon\n\n[Fat Possum]\n\nSeconds into Lisbon opener, \"Juveniles\", it becomes clear: The Walkmen are in no rush to get to where they're going. Paul Maroon's guitar chimes loosely, while frontman Hamilton Leithauser croons about taking in country air. Everything about the song just feels easy, and that tone holds true for the rest of the record as well. Whether rocking (\"Angela Surf City\") or lolling (the title track) or unfurling New Orleans style horns (\"Stranded\"), on Lisbon the Walkmen settle into their sound in a manner only time and age can allow. There's a fantastic moment on \"Juveniles\" in which Leithauser, with the same comfortable, unflinching air, states simply, \"I am a good man by any count. And I see better things to come.\" That's confidence you can't fake. --David Bevan"
