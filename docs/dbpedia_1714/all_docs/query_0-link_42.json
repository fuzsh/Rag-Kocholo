        "text": "It's the follow-up to 2019's 'Lover'\n\nTaylor Swift has made a habit of surprise announcing her career moves - and this seemed to start with the release of her eighth album 'Folklore' back in July 2020.\n\nWritten and recorded during the Coronavirus pandemic, Taylor collaborated with a number of writers on the record, including Aaron Dessner, Bon Iver - who also features on a song - and William Bowery, the alias of her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn, amongst others. Here's everything you need to know about the record.\n\nWhen was 'Folklore' released?\n\nIt came out on 24th July 2020, while the deluxe edition featuring additional track 'The Lakes' was released on 18th August 2020.\n\nHow did Taylor announce the album 'Folklore'?\n\nTaylor surprised fans around the world when she announced the album 'Folklore'. The singer took to her socials the day before the album's release, sharing a black and white, grainy photo of herself sitting in a forest looking up at the sky.\n\nReferring to the COVID-19 pandemic, Taylor told her fans on social media: 'Most of the things I had planned this summer didn‚Äôt end up happening, but there is something I hadn‚Äôt planned on that DID happen. And that thing is my 8th studio album, folklore. Surprise ü§ó.\n\n'Tonight at midnight I‚Äôll be releasing my entire brand new album of songs I‚Äôve poured all of my whims, dreams, fears, and musings into. Before this year I probably would‚Äôve overthought when to release this music at the ‚Äòperfect‚Äô time, but the times we‚Äôre living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed.\n\n'My gut is telling me that if you make something you love, you should just put it out into the world. That‚Äôs the side of uncertainty I can get on board with. Love you guys so much ‚ô•Ô∏è.' (sic)\n\nWhat's the tracklist?\n\n1) 'The 1'\n\n2) 'Cardigan'\n\n3) 'The Last Great American Dynasty'\n\n4) 'Exile' (featuring Bon Iver)\n\n5) 'My Tears Ricochet'\n\n6) 'Mirrorball'\n\n7) 'Seven'\n\n8) 'August'\n\n9) 'This Is Me Trying'\n\n10) 'Illicit Affairs'\n\n11) 'Invisible String'\n\n12) 'Mad Woman'\n\n13) 'Epiphany'\n\n14) 'Betty'\n\n15) 'Peace'\n\n16) 'Hoax'\n\nDid Taylor tour the 'Folklore' album?\n\nTaylor was due to head out on tour in April 2020 to support and promote her seventh album 'Lover', but unfortunately this was cancelled due to the global pandemic. Instead, she included a 'Folklore' section into her 'Eras Tour', which began in March 2023 and will continue through to December 2024.\n\nWhere did it come in the charts?\n\n'Folklore' debuted at Number 1 in the UK, which is where it stayed for the first three weeks before dropping off the top spot. 'Folklore' was certified 2x Platinum by the BPI in December 2023, translating to over 600,000 UK album sales.\n\nA few months on from the record's release, it reached a major milestone - selling more than 1 million copies and becoming the first album to do so that year.\n\nFolklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions\n\nTaylor was the subject of a Disney+ special which featured the singer performing each song from the album and discussing how she'd written it. The synopsis reads: 'Taylor Swift performs every song from her best-selling album, 'folklore', in a truly intimate concert experience.\n\n'Accompanied by her co-producers, Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff, along with a guest appearance by Justin Vernon,Taylor filmed the event at the historic Long Pond Studios in upstate New York, a setting that evokes the nostalgic, wistful nature of the album.\n\n'In between live performances, she and her collaborators discuss the creation and meaning behind each song, and also share the challenges and joys of remotely producing this acclaimed and record-setting collection.'\n\nShe also released the performances as a live album of the same name.\n\nScroll through to learn more about Taylor Swift's albums:\n\nYou can hear songs by Taylor Swift on Tay FM.\n\nNow read:\n\nTaylor Swift: All your questions answered on the 'Cruel Summer' singer üé∂\n\nTaylor Swift's albums: Facts and figures about her super successful records\n\nAll of Taylor Swift's biggest and best career moments so far\n\nHow to listen to Tay FM:\n\nFor great music and incredible competitions tune into Tay FM on 96.4 and 102.8FM, online, on our Tay FM app, your DAB radio, or say ‚ÄòPlay Tay FM‚Äô on your Smart Speaker.
