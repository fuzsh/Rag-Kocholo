        "text": "1.\n\nMost of Everything 02:55\n\nWell, I gave away most of everything to see if then I could get free. I cut off most my hair because I was getting scared that I might be hiding something. It was like seeing my face for the first, for the very first time. And in going outside, I think how I might have changed. I wonder, “who am I today?” Now, I haven’t got a lot but it’s much more than I thought I’d need to get by… a simple path, a simple life.\n\n2.\n\nAll Below 03:11\n\nYou could cut those ties that had you strung up to your past, but you don’t. You got all that weight and all that stress, carrying time. Let it go. And if you tell a lie, oh, it echoes on. And if you cross a line, the line holds on. I wanna know… What does it sound like, ticking clocks, the metronome inside your head? Like bomb set to blow, heart beating in your chest, it’s a secret that you’ll keep again. You’ll level out the ground when the fucking thing explodes and your friends will have to bury it. You could live that dash or sit wait for the ending date to come. We work so hard, it goes so fast. We forget, become numb. And if you tell a lie, oh, it echoes on. And if you cross a line, the line holds on. I wanna know… What does it sound like, ticking clocks, the metronome inside your head? Like bomb set to blow, heart beating in your chest, it’s a secret that you’ll keep again. You’ll level out the ground when the fucking thing explodes and your friends will have to bury it. I wanna know if we’re getting out of here. Please make it clear.\n\n3.\n\nMatches 03:20\n\nIt’s not the same. Crashed the truck, burnt the house down. You set the fire. Some things do remain. I mean nobody died but the lies make the liar. Somebody’s gonna say “some children stay children and for that oh the child had to pay.” Just like the friction surface sets a flame and gravity starts pullin on it’s weight. It makes no sense to me. It didn’t have to be. I mean if you could, would you then take it back? Take it back.\n\n4.\n\nShift 02:53\n\nI could swear that I did see you changing shapes in front of me. I rubbed eyes and grabbed my heart. I shook my head then fell apart. Wonder now, was it a dream? It felt so real, but now it seems I’ve lost my sense. How the hell did you get by? Can’t lose ever night to asking, “why?” Evolve, progress, it’s to survive. But I shake and I stumble now how did I? Broken spirit and betrayed trust. Apologies and cover ups. Something new coming over me. I cannot speak but now I see I’ve lost my sense. How the hell did you get by? Can’t spend every night asking, “why?” Thinking deeply, I’ve arrived here at this point now feeling sure of what happens now, what happens next. Distilled the truth that’s all that’s left. And I don’t think I’m gonna run no more. When I say it stops here, then hey man it stops here. Oh I mean it’s got to stop here. No more.\n\n5.\n\nGiants Sleeping 02:58"
