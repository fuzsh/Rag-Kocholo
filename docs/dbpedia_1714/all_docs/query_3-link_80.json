        "text": "Here is the 6th solo album produced by Ryan Raddon, aka Kaskade, released by Ultra Records at the beginning of this month. Now, normally Kaskade productions aren’t my cup of tea, but I thought I’d share with you some tracks from his new album, Dynasty. After listening through most of his work for the past 5 or 6 years, I have pigeonholed Kaskade into the genre of ‘girly dance music’, and this label has stuck with him throughout his career. This album is nothing new, as all 12 tracks contain female vocals. The music is a chill, down-tempo style of house which is nice for loungin’ to. Just to set things straight, my stereotype of girly music doesn’t necessarily hold a negative connotation, it’s just a style that I believe girls would enjoy listening to more. A lot of his songs are vocal heavy, and while I did enjoy his collaborations with Deadmau5, I do find most of the tracks on his solo albums to be kinda cheesy.\n\nMany of the songs on this album were written by John Hancock, who along with Kaskade, Becky Williams, and Finn Bjarnson, form the group Late Night Alumni. There is even a Late Night Alumni song that some of you may have heard of, titled Empty Streets, which can be found on this album (it was featured on Tiesto’s In Search of Sunrise 5). I do see a lot of commercial value due to the heavy usage of vocals; by adding words to his music, Kaskade exposes his work to a larger audience, some of whom probably aren’t too familiar with dance music. One thing that I have noticed about Kaskade’s work is that even though he insists on producing tracks with vocals in it, the music is constantly getting better. The level of production on his last two albums have significantly improved from his previous releases. Although I greatly respect what he does on the tables, this album probably won’t get many more listens from me (unless a remix album comes out). However, if you like his style and what he has done previously, then you will probably love this new release."
