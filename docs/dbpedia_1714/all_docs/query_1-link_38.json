        "text": "Tracklisting: 1. Born to Die 2. Off to the Races 3. Blue Jeans 4. Video Games 5. Diet Mountain Dew 6. National Anthem 7. Dark Paradise 8. Radio 9. Carmen 10. Million Dollar Man 11. Summertime Sadness 13. This Is What Makes Us Girls\n\nHighest UK chart position: 1\n\nOriginal NME star rating: 8/10\n\n‘Born to Die’ is Lana’s worst-reviewed album. It was a brave, mysterious release, thrusting a confident identity into the mainstream before anyone knew what to do with it. She didn’t either – she offered it, curls sprayed and lips puckered, but her image didn’t bloom into a living thing until later. Here was a beautiful girl singing proudly about being sad. About loving men passionately. About sex, glamour, and money.\n\nThe world wasn’t an easy place in 2012 (when was it ever?), but it was certainly easier than now. ‘Born to Die’ was released when Donald Trump was merely a businessman and TV personality. Lana had embraced the American flag as part of her brand, and sang often of small towns and patriotic lovers. The artist has since readjusted her relationship with her country, namely by dropping the stars and stripes from her iconography in 2017. ‘National Anthem’ sits a little differently now. Its fireworks sound dangerous.\n\n2012 was a time where people could go viral online just because they were good. That’s what happened with ‘Video Games’, Lana’s favourite song. She described it as “Hollywood sadcore”, a deliberate wallow that was somehow still aspirational.\n\nLana was the first contemporary sad girl who sang. Someone who owned their feelings and increased the volume, rather than blocking them out with a catchy hook. She sang for, and with, girls on Tumblr, girls who now stan on Twitter. Lana wasn’t afraid of much on ‘Born to Die’ – not metaphors of cancer, nor immortal declarations of love, or comparisons with Nabokov’s controversial Lolita.\n\nThis was pop music, but nothing like before. Velvety vocals were poised over ferociously eclectic sounds, with trip-hop beats and pure, sweet melodies coexisting as if they’d never been apart. ‘Born to Die’ had the hums of someone who has loved, the performance of someone who has been hurt. Lana would purr for validation, and then growl for redemption. Her contradictions made her alluring.\n\nIt was a little rough, but epitomised what was, and still is, so singular. ‘Born to Die’ has always sounded like a dream, one maybe lost in its own haze at the time. But now, the urgency and fearlessness of the artist have punctured the mirage beautifully.\n\nIn their own words: “I’ve found, about five years down the line from writing the first song for that record, that I am surprisingly similar to the person in those songs – mostly in the way that I have a strong sense of who I am but not a clear idea of where I’m going.” Lana Del Rey, NME, December 2016\n\nKey track: ‘Video Games’\n\nGoosebump moment: The five-string snarling countdown of ‘Blue Jeans’.\n\nLike this?

Half Light II (No Celebration) 9. Suburban War 10. Month Of May 11. Wasted Hour 12. Deep Blue 13. We Used To Wait 14. Sprawl I (Flatland) 15. Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) 16. The Suburbs (Continued)\n\nHighest UK Chart position: 1\n\nOriginal NME star rating: 9/10\n\nA full decade on, ‘The Suburbs’ endures because it manages to look forwards, backwards, inwards and outwards all at once. It is a record coated in the anxiety of 2010, capturing post-financial crash unease and that sinking feeling that not only is the damage irreversible, but that things are only going to get worse. It bottles the comforting yet ultimately empty glow of nostalgia, but also a sense of dread about the future that now feels more than a little prophetic.\n\nMuch of the album’s energy comes from a sense of desperation. There are fantasies of fleeing fruitlessly from the sprawl, nostalgic daydreams laced with sorrow, and straight-up denial that anything is even wrong. Often there’s just impotence in the face of collapse – “By the time the first bombs fell we were already bored,” sings Win Butler on the title track. Yet no matter where the band seek their escape on ‘The Suburbs’, there’s a shapeless dread at the album’s core, something they can’t bring themselves to fully confront. Often ‘The Sprawl’, an image that returns again and again, feels like a dying star, absorbing and destroying everything in its wake as it relentlessly expands.\n\nYet for all of its paranoia and doom, ‘The Suburbs’ is a record that still sounds absolutely beautiful. Its title track and opener is a melancholy skip of piano and a march of percussion, gradually incorporating distant sweeps of violin and ghostly backing vocals. Then it careens into the fierce guitars of ‘Ready To Start’, submerges itself in the melancholy of ‘Modern Man’ and leaps back up to the sinister, magisterial rush of ‘Rococo’. From the tense, angular pop of ‘We Used To Wait’ to the irresistible electro pump of ‘Half Light II (No Celebration) and the record’s monolithic pièce de résistance ‘Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)’, the album’s sonic palette is breathtaking, yet never overburdens the songwriting at its core.\n\nArcade Fire have never shied away from a grandiose expression of emotions, but while on subsequent albums like 2013’s bloated ‘Reflektor’ and 2017 misfire ‘Everything Now’ they let their loftiness bog them down, ‘The Suburbs’ tempers the group’s preachier tendencies with a powerful injection of humanity.

Rather than the usual “interval training and drinking lots of water” her regimen included sword fighting, sensory deprivation tanks and voluntary surgery on her corneas to block out blue light.\n\nIt was almost certainly a pisstake, but it’s hard to be completely sure: Claire Boucher is a woman with form when it comes to pushing limits for the sake of her art.\n\nOriginally from Vancouver, she moved to Montreal to study Russian literature before switching to neuroscience, but never finished either course, lured instead to the city’s underground music scene. She banked everything on becoming Grimes, a decision that cost her friendships and relationships and left her without a permanent home for a time. But it paid off: her first two albums, ‘Geidi Primes’ and ‘Halfaxa’ – inspired by Frank Herbert’s Dune and medieval mysticism respectively – grew a cult following, and for her third, she was snapped up by 4AD, spiritual home of electronic goths. Faced with a proper grown-up label deadline and inspired by 11th-century German mystic Hildegard of Bingen, Boucher shut herself away for three weeks, taking speed and going up to nine days without sleep in an attempt to access deep-level creativity.\n\nWhich is how you end up with galactic gems called things like ‘Vowels = Space And Time’. ‘Visions’ sounds exactly like what it is: an album crafted as a midpoint between R&B and IDM in an insomniac chemical rush by a woman who with equal love for Nine Inch Nails and K-pop. Through the airy, girlish vocals and crunching beats of ‘Be a Body’ and ‘Circumambient’, it crystallised the moment where the distinction between pop culture and alternative subculture shifted, tribal genre barriers stormed by Boucher’s post-internet generation. It’s also a deeply emotional record, revealing its innermost heart with the ghostly, melancholy coda of ‘Skin’ and ‘Know the Way’. And it showed Grimes her forward path: her self-directed video for ‘Genesis’, with its flaming-sword-wielding apocalyptic hipster gang, hinted at the rich visual persona that emerged in 2015’s ‘Art Angels’. She’s never stopped getting weirder and thinking bigger since: her forthcoming ‘Miss_Anthropocene’ is “a concept album about the anthropomorphic goddess of climate change: a psychedelic, space-dwelling demon/beauty queen who relishes the end of the world.” You better believe she’ll be going Method for it, too.\n\nIn their own words: “Once you hit day nine, you start accessing some really crazy shit. You have no stimulation, so your subconscious starts filling in the blanks. I started to feel like I was channelling spirits. I was convinced my music was a gift from God. It was like I knew exactly what to do next, as if my songs were already written.” The Guardian, April 2012\n\nKey track: ‘Genesis’\n\nGoosebump moment: Boucher’s soft chirrup of “see you in the dark night!” on ‘Oblivion’, a song inspired by her experience of a violent assault.\n\nLike this?

His 2011 mixtape ‘Nostalgia, Ultra’ had drawn to him a small legion of dedicated fans and music journalists fawning over his work. At the listening party, the use of “he/him” pronouns in a project discussing heartbreak and emotion drew attention. To control the narrative, Christopher Breaux took to Tumblr to pen an open letter under his pseudonym Frank Ocean.\n\nIn it, he came out as queer, one of the first mainstream male artists in R&B and rap to do so. Soon after, the album, ‘channel ORANGE’, was released. It wasn’t the queer rights anthem many expected, instead the obscure nature of the project was what stood out. Flowing between funk, soul, RnB, hip-hop, and electronica with speckles of Marvin Gaye, and odes to Prince all underpinned by Frank’s penchant for unique lyricism, tenderness was crucial.\n\nIt’s slippery and cryptic, with Ocean taking on multiple identities — most famously during the sprawling 10 minutes of ‘Pyramid’ where Ocean re-invents one of the most famous rulers in history as a woman of the night who dons six-inch heels. On ‘Bad Religion’, Ocean uses a fictional back-and-forth with a cab driver as a personal therapy session while on ‘Super Rich Kids’, he admonishes the wealthy and privileged.\n\nThere is no formula here. It does what it needs to when it needs to. Take its featured guests. John Mayer backs away from the spotlight entirely, his guitar solos on ‘Pyramids’ and ‘White’ his only prominent contribution and he brings Andre 3000 out of semi-retirement to deliver a stand-out verse on ‘Pink Matter’.\n\nOcean captured the scattershot, jittery, anxious and depressive feelings that come with heartbreak, sex and love. All of the personas are consumed by guilt and vanity while grappling with the acknowledgement that acceptance is hard-won. With ‘Channel Orange’, Frank Ocean announced himself as a generational talent.\n\nIn their own words: “I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions.” Frank Ocean, Tumblr, 2011\n\nKey track: ‘Bad Religion’\n\nGoosebump moment: The beat-change halfway through ‘Pyramids’ when it goes from a club banger to a melancholic introspective track.\n\nLike this?

It was a bright start but the follow-up was really what set them apart from every other guitar-wielding group on the Radio 1 playlist. They’d shown hints of something more in songs like ‘Heart Out’, but ‘I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It’ was the album that expanded their world beyond big choruses, running the gamut from post-rock soundscapes and bangers to mental health-referencing scream-alongs and funk-flecked ‘80s paeans to the effects of cocaine.\n\n‘I Like It When You Sleep…’ stood out not just because of its innate eclecticism, but for its restless race through the ego of The 1975’s frontman Matty Healy. Packed with self-referential nods and sardonic wordplay, it established him as a pop star with opinions on everything, a brain that never stops ticking over and a lot of extreme life experience. ‘Love Me’ took on selfie culture, while ‘She’s American’ rolled its eyes at a Stateside lover obsessed with status. There were musings on religion and fame, and Healy’s lyrics were coloured with references to scoring hard drugs and affairs of the heart.\n\nWith its refusal to play it safe, ‘I Like It When You Sleep…’ pushed The 1975 from being simply loved and into another world of great influence. You can hear their DNA in the younger bands signed to their label, Dirty Hit – see Pale Waves and No Rome – but their sound has travelled much further than their own stomping ground. Hints of their particular ‘80s-styled synths and fidgety guitar lines cropping up as far afield as in the music of K-pop groups such as Day6 or Pentagon.\n\nEven their aesthetic has coloured the last four years of the decade. Pink rectangular lights now adorn countless stages and pastel neon signs shine on artwork with stunning vistas in the background. Their crisp, clean iconography has been replicated throughout the pop sphere, rounding out their place as one of the most influential bands of the last 10 years.\n\nIn their own words: “There’s fuck all wrong with the album. Nothing. It’s perfect for me” – Matty Healy, NME cover feature, November 25, 2016\n\nKey track: ‘Somebody Else’\n\nGoosebumps moment: The raw pain in Matty’s rasping voice as he declares, “Well I think I’ve gone mad/Isn’t that so sad?” on ‘The Ballad Of Me And My Brain’.\n\nLike this?

Like so much of Lamar’s work to follow, it combined dense lyricism and incredibly intricate delivery (listen to the beautiful tumble of words that unspools on ‘good kid’) with a neat conceit that threaded the whole thing together in an unfussy way.\n\nOpening track ‘Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter’ saw Kendrick evoke his endearingly misspent youth, bombing through LA in his mum’s car to meet a girl named Sherane. Young Kendrick discovers his talent over the course of the narrative, with ‘Backseat Freestyle’ recounting early lyrics with which he attempted to will himself into superstardom: “All my life I want money and power… I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower/So I can fuck the world for 72 hours”. This wily approach enabled the rapper to espouse traditional hip-hop braggadocio while satirising it as the adolescent posturing of a kid not quite as confident as he made out.\n\nEventually he achieves the success he once dreamt of, with Dr. Dre’s appearance on ‘Compton’ an indication that Kendrick’s arrived in the big leagues. But that’s only half the story of ‘good kid, m.A.A.d City’. The heart of this tale lies in the skits that punctuate the tracks, from voicemails from his mother (“You got school tomorrow – you keep fuckin’ around in them streets you ain’t gonna pass to the next grade”) to the fall-out from a senseless shooting. This is a story of family, and how that family kept Kendrick from becoming another victim of his environment – a luxury not afforded to many of his less lucky peers. In that sense, this pretty specific tale is actually universal. Everyone has a family, or doesn’t, and we’ve all been shaped by the people around us.\n\nOn ‘Money Trees’ he upturns the image of the criminal with the gun and focuses on the person receiving the bullet (“the one in front of the gun lives forever”), an indication of Lamar’s 360-degree narrative scope. No wonder Pharrell called him “this era’s Bob Dylan” for his “masterful storytelling”. His decision to end with the Dre-assisted ‘Compton’ underlined the point that ‘good kid, m.A.A.d City’ is this generation’s ‘Straight Outta Compton’, destined to grace ‘best of’ lists forever more. And here we are.\n\nIn their own words: “At first, I was scared to show fear because you can never be sure how people will perceive you. But I dared myself to do that, to stand out. Now I’ll talk about being beaten up or robbed or making a stupid decision because of a girl or whatever.” – Kendrick Lamar, The Guardian, December 2012\n\nKey track: ‘Backseat Freestyle’\n\nGoosebump moment: Literally every time that warped backing vocal chants “Drank” on ‘Swimming Pools (Drank)’.\n\nLike this?

But ‘Let England Shake’ reinvented her utterly.\n\nIn the years after the 2003 Iraq war, as its grim aftermath rippled outwards, Harvey had found herself drawn to dig in the deep roots of human conflict. There were war correspondents, she reasoned, and war poets. Why not a war songwriter? The lyrics of ‘Let England Shake’ took almost two years to perfect, as she digested works on the First World War, the Bosnian conflict and the war on terror, trying to make the words work as standalone poetry. The narrative voice that emerged needed a new sound, which Harvey crafted using a recently adopted instrument, the autoharp, shaping her vocals into an eerie, keening croon to suit dark, detached visions of the recurrent patterns of war.\n\nRecorded in a live, loose way with her core collaborators in a Dorset village church, ‘Let England Shake’ is haunted by voices that seem to float out of the past. The military bugle call in ‘The Glorious Land’, a skewed nursery rhyme of British and American nationalism, seems more like a ghostly squall than an instrumental flourish, and Harvey’s narrator on the title track is as blithe as a musichall sweetheart as she and a paramour splash around in the “fountain of death” amid jangling strums and naive plinks.\n\nHarvey’s hard work pays off richly for the listener – ‘Let England Shake’’ calls you back to its horrors again and again, lines like “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat” sticking nastily in the brain. The album’s success – her first Top 10 record, album of the year in NME and her second Mercury prize win, making Harvey the only artist ever to do the double – also decisively secured her place as a top-tier songwriter, one you’d be wise not to underestimate.\n\nIn their own words: “I was wanting to show the way history repeats itself, and so in some ways it doesn’t matter what time it was, because this endless cycle goes on and on and on.” Polly Harvey, NME, January 2011\n\nKey track: ‘The Words That Maketh Murder’\n\nGoosebump moment: The moment in ‘The Words That Maketh Murder’ when Harvey invokes the ghost of Eddie Cochran’s Summertime Blues with pitch-black irony: “What if I take my problem to the United Nations?”\n\nLike this?

The latter is seen as Kanye’s defining artistic statement, the moment where his genius was not just spoken about by the man himself, but by the world at large.\n\n‘Yeezus’, by contrast, is a strange beast: a tight, 40-minute album that lacks a thematic link and with a shoddy cover that pretends it’s a CDR. But really, ‘Yeezus’ found Kanye at the absolute peak of his powers, delivering a collection so wildly futuristic that the rest of the world is still catching up. Seriously, listen to ‘Black Skinhead’ and Billie Eilish’s ‘Bad Guy’ back to back – six whole years separate them.\n\nKanye’s detractors, you suspect, have two primary grumbles. One: his arrogance. And two: his lack of focus. Those taking offence with Kanye’s displays of self-confidence don’t – or didn’t, at this point – realise it’s a mask for the fragility of his ego and an extension of his humour. Here, the ego was out of control. Where now he’s making music purely for the big guy in the sky, here, ‘Ye was declaring himself a deity on the urgent rush of ‘I Am A God’. Featuring the immortal lyric “I am a God/Hurry up with those damn croissants” it put Kanye’s way with comedy front and centre. Later on ‘Bound 2’, the most brilliantly unsentimental love song of all time, he constructs this zinger: “So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas/She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist/Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?”\n\nThe album itself is a thrill ride of glitchy electronics, soul samples, filth and bombast. Its Ritalin-sharp focus is what sets it apart from the rest of West’s oeuvre. This is what he sounds like when he’s really concentrating, something that, arguably, he has never truly managed since. Follow-up ‘The Life Of Pablo’ was his great, unfinished folly and ‘Ye’ and ‘Jesus Is King’ sprawling and inconsistent. But ‘Yeezus’ remains futuristic, flawless and impeccable. This was Kanye standing on top of the world. He had the success. He had the acclaim. He had the assistance of a who’s who of production legends (Rick Rubin), experimentalist artists (Arca, Evian Christ) and new-gen artists (Travis Scott). And in Kim Kardashian, he finally had the girl of his dreams. No wonder he felt godlike. We don’t necessarily “miss the old Kanye”, but we may never see the like of him again.\n\nIn Their Own Words: “Yeezus was the beginning of me as a new kind of artist. Stepping forward with what I know about architecture, about classicism, about society, about texture, about synesthesia—the ability to see sound—and the way everything is everything and all these things combine, and then starting from scratch…” (Interview Magazine, 2014)\n\nKey track: ‘Black Skinhead’\n\nGoosebump moment: ‘Blood On The Leaves’, for the sensitive sampling of the harrowing ‘Strange Fruit’.\n\nLike this?

That doesn’t change even if you’re one of the most famous young pop stars on the planet, but at least you can pour your feelings and reflections into a decade-defining album as you work through the debris of a relationship. That’s exactly what Lorde did when she experienced her first major break-up, using it as inspiration for her second album ‘Melodrama’ and coming out with a record that serves as both a pint-of-ice-cream kind of wallow sesh and the kick up the arse you need to get out of bed and realise you’re still a whole person without your ex.\n\nRather than make a loosely related collection of songs, Lorde set ‘Melodrama’ out over the course of a house party. It began with ‘Green Light’ and her doing her “makeup in someone else’s car” and ended with ‘Perfect Places’, an ode to what she’s dubbed “the transcendent nature of partying”. In between, she was full of lust and ready to carve up the makeshift dancefloor, watery-eyed in quiet, painful moments, and – for a brief moment – craving revenge.\n\nAs you’d expect from someone whose debut album showcased a deep thinker and a dreamer full of wisdom and sharp observations, ‘Melodrama’ was the kind of album that dissected the end of a relationship in precise, gut-wrenching pen strokes. “The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy/‘Til all of the tricks don’t work anymore,” she concluded on ‘Liability’. On ‘Writer In The Dark’, her voice dipped and soared like a young Kate Bush as she pledged her everlasting love to her ex (“I’ll love you ‘til my breathing stops/I’ll love you ‘til you call the cops on me”). She took cues from the queen of sad bangers Robyn and matched the heft of her heartbreak with slamming house piano chords and contrasting slabs of euphoria.\n\nBut the album’s most affecting moments came in the little specific details, such as buying groceries with her ex on ‘Hard Feelings / Loveless’ or coming alive in a new city as she finally let go of her pain. Much like ‘Supercut’, the whole record felt like a montage of moments; a flip-book of memories crashing into each other and causing a pile-up in your heart. It was all so raw and real that it felt like it was happening to you, and almost made you long for a break-up so you could burrow down into it and come out as strong, clever, and cool as Lorde.\n\nIn their own words: “It’s about contrast: really big and grand, and really tiny and intimate. Going from the personal, emotional stuff to the headlines and the web… You’re talking about literal, out-there violence and, like, heart violence” – Lorde, NME, June 2017.\n\nKey track: ‘Green Light’\n\nGoosebump moment: When all of the layers strip away on ‘Hard Feelings / Loveless’, leaving only string flourishes to accompany Lorde as she recalls the little moments in a relationship.\n\nLike this?

We don’t just mean the languid stomp of opener ‘Do I Wanna Know?’ or the showy solo at the start of ‘R U Mine?’. No – we mean the way that as soon as you heard ‘AM’ erupt out of your speakers for the first time it was clear that from now on the Arctic Monkeys were moving to a different beat.\n\nThey were magpies, of course, but they were good at it. The band cheerfully admitted to nicking a few ideas from the likes of Dr Dre, Outkast and Aaliyah, but what was really remarkable was the sheer range and scope of their rampant looting. They stole from hip hop, glam, Motown, rock’n’roll, R&B and even doo-wop with equal ease and evident delight. They picked Phil Spector’s pockets and mugged John Lennon. They lifted that “Mad sounds/In your ears” bit from a song by their early producer Alan Smyth. For the finale, they just straight-out recited a John Cooper Clarke poem. Somebody should have called the police.\n\nThis disparate collection of pilfered genres and stolen sounds came together seamlessly with Turner’s too-clever-by-half lyrics about love, lust and the grey area in-between. It’s still hard to get over the elegantly sketched scene in the car in ‘Arabella’, which ends with the phenomenal line: “The horizon tries but it’s just not as kind on the eyes.” The man can chirpse. He had us at: “I’m sorry to interrupt/It’s just I’m constantly on the cusp/Of trying to kiss you.” But ‘AM’ was about so much more than just chat-up lines. What about the lovely, melancholy double meaning of: “Leave me listening to the Stones/2000 Light Years From Home”? The writing is sharply-observed, sometimes self-lacerating and often laugh-out-loud funny. There were a lot of great albums released in the 2010s but only one of them features prominent lyrical references to both Mean Streets and Thunderbirds.\n\nWhat it all amounted to was as good a portrait of what it was like to be staying out too late and getting into trouble in the 2010s as anyone wrote in any medium, with the added bonus that it was also really fun to dance to. That meant it connected with people. It sold more copies than One Direction’s ‘Up All Night’. It became the soundtrack for countless nights out, hook-ups and comedowns in every town and city of this country. It was the album of the decade.\n\nIn their own words: “It sounds like a Dr Dre beat, but we’ve given it an Ike Turner bowl-cut and sent it galloping across the desert on a Stratocaster.” Alex Turner, NME, July 2013\n\nKey track: ‘Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?’, which somehow delivers on Turner’s ludicrous hype quoted above.\n\nGoosebump moment: If ‘AM’ is an album on which our narrator finds himself torn between the immediate pleasures of the flesh and a deeper romantic longing, then ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ is the moment he chooses love.\n\nLike this?
