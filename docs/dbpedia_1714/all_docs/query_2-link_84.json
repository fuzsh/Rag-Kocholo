        "text": "The long awaited second season of the hit drama series, “Kold x Windy” premieres tomorrow on ALLBLK. Fans of the series won’t be disappointed!\n\n“Kold & Windy” exposes the reality behind Chicago’s south side and its street culture that has influenced our entire nation.\n\nThis season brings conflict and desire, along with new characters and betrayals. Rising hip-hop and drill star Malika “Kold” Wise (Sh’Kia Augustin), who is now very pregnant with her deceased fiancé’s child, has fallen into an emotional rollercoaster of anxiety and violent fits.\n\nAlthough Kold x Windy have recently signed with Achieve Jamz, Malika seems to have lost her musical footing. Forced to return to committing her “stains,” she’s reverting to the life she so desperately tried to leave behind.\n\nHer trusted confidant and group member Renee “Windy” Johnson (Nijah Brenea), is still obsessed with reppin’ Kold x Windy on the mic and in the streets. Despite her bulletproof façade, Renee is dealing with her own set of demons.\n\nUB Exclusive Preview: The F*ck Is This?\n\nNew to the cast is Reginae Carter as Miss 290, one half of Kold & Windy’s rival rap group, K-Town. Returning cast includes Brely Evans as GeGe, Kaja Brielle as Shelly Winter, Kiyanne Muhammad as Temperance “Temper” Davis, Solo Lucci as Pop Off, and more.\n\n“Kold x Windy” is co-created and executive produced by Kenny Young, Phil James, and Vernon “Xtreme” Brown of Chalice Entertainment. Brett Dismuke, Head of Content, Nikki Love, SVP of Production and Development and Ashley McFarlin, VP Production and Development serve as executive producers for ALLBLK."
