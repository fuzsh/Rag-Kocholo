Since the issue of the last general catalogue in October, 1902, this business has undergone a great development. The membership has increased to an enormous extent, a result brought about in great measure by the recommendation of members to their friends. For this emphatic approval of our endeavours we tender our best thanks to the public, and intend in the future, as in the past, still to merit its confidence. When the scheme, formulated by the management, has been realised in its entirety the Library will be the largest and most popular in the kingdom. The frontispiece shows one of the new London depots, and is typical of the way in which a number of the new branches are fitted. All true book-lovers find great pleasure in handling clean books, and this pleasure is intensified if the volumes are housed in quiet and comfortably furnished rooms, such as the one depicted. The system of exchanging books, too, that is in use at this Library, works extremely well, saving the members much annoyance, and the assistants a great deal of time and unnecessary labour. titrl^ 6ooo/^=/overs Lihncirij. It will be noticed that this edition of the general catalogue has been much enlarged and revised, a fact which has necessitated the raising of the price to 1/- nett. In perusing the catalogue readers will observe tliat fiction predominates — a result brought about solely by the superior demand, which we, in common with other libraries, experience. Recognising this, we have embodied an entirely new and unique feature in this section, whereby a considerable number of the better known titles have been annotated and the stories described. For many of these characterisations our thanks are due to Mr. Swan Sonnenschein, for permission to make use of one of his publications entitled, \"A Guide to the Best Fiction,\" by Ernest A. Baker, M.A. Whilst we have thus given prominence to fiction, we are very desirous that subscribers should understand that this does not imply that we deem the better class of book unwelcome or unprofitable to us. We trust that the catalogue will prove a valuable aid to readers and students for the purpose of study, as well as recreation, and at the same time serve to demonstrate the resources of the library in the different branches of literature. JESSE BOOT. Nottingham, October, 1903. THE LATEST PUBLICATIONS. PRICE ONE PENNY. This booUlet, which is issued ;it frequent intervals from the ofSces of Boots Book-lovers Library, contains an alphabetical list of the very newest books. Many of the titles are annotated, and it is hoped tliat the characterisations of the principal novels will be found of value to the reader. The \"Book-loveks\" Reading Cases ARE ON SALK AT ALL BRANCHES OF THE LIBRARY. ONE PENNY EACH. These detachable book covers are made in five sizes, and in several shades of cloth. A sample case will be posted to any address on receipt of two penny stamps. jAWJ^ SSookBlovens l^ibrary. UdDantages of n^embersbip. Books taken out at one branch may be exchanged at any other branch in the kingdom, and exchanges will be made as often as desired. We have already branches in the most important towns in England, and London, Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham, will be covered by numerous sub- branches. A list of the branches already open will be found on pages 506'509. Any book that is in print and suitable for circulation will be quickly obtained for Members. Technical and medical works, expensive illustrated volumes, and books for which there is little demand, will not be added to the Library. Much worn or soiled books are at once withdrawn from circulation and replaced by new copies. A list of the latest publications is published at frequent intervals, price one penny. The extremely simple system of exchange, the absence of irritating rules, and the perfect service given to Members, make this the best Circulating Library in the kingdom. cSook=lovers Ltfyrari^.

The membership entitles you to exchange books at any branch of the Library. For addresses of the branches see pages 506'509. Subscriptions may commence at any date, and are payable in advance, A receipt is given on payment, and the membership token is posted to the member the day following. The terms of membership and charges to non- members -will be found on page xi. The token (a small ivorine paper knife) can be securely attached to any volume belonging to the Library. This is done by opening the book and threading the little silver-plated tube through the wire loop that appears at the top of each volume. To w^ithdraw the token, thread the little tube back again after having opened the book in the middle. The membership tokens are the property of the Library, and must be returned when the subscription is renewed or discontinued. Each membership token is stamped with the date on -which the membership expires. On payment of the renew^al of the subscription a nev/ token is sent to the branch, and is exchanged for the old one when next the member calls at the Library. DISCONTINUANCE When discontinuing the membership it is essential OF SUBSCRIPTION, that a token be handed in with each volume returned to the Library. RENEWAL OF SUBSCRIPTION. EXCHANGES AND TIME ALLOWED FOR READING. METHOD OF EXCHANGING T'.iE BOOKS. Exchanges may be made as often as desired, and there is no limit to the time allowed for reading. Books may be exchanged at any branch on pro- duction of a membership token for each volume. Unless a token is attached books will only be exchanged on payment of the fee charged to non- subscribers. J^fOtTi^ 'Jjoo/i= lovers Uihrany. INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS AND NON^MEMBERS icouunucd). WHEN CHANGING You will doubtless appreciate the fact that you BOOKS. arc not kept waiting while an entry is made of the book you return, and of the one taken in its place ; also that you are not questioned as to your name and address. All that you have to do is to show the librarian that you have a token for each book you wish to exchange, and you are then at liberty to choose other volumes. BOOKS OBTAINED Any book that is in print and suitable for TO ORDER. circulation will be quickly obtained for members (see page s..). Order post cards, wth postage stamp affixed, may be obtained at any branch, price one half'penny. When particulars of requirements have been filled in, the card must be handed to the assistant, who will order the books from the Head Offices, and on their receipt will post the card to the member's address. Order post cards may also be had without the stamp affixed (gratis), but in this case the member must not expect to receive a notification that the work required has been obtained. Members may have order post cards to be filled in at home, and can order books to be sent to the branch of the library that is most convenient for their next exchange. No book will be reserved for more than three days, and after the expiration of that time will be placed on the shelves for general use. Non-members can only obtain the books in demand after members have been supplied. In no case are books specially purchased for non-members. LIST KEPT OF Many members keep a list of the works they BOOKS REQUIRED, wish to read. These lists the assistants will be pleased to file for reference, but it must be on the understanding that members do not expect to find books constantly placed aside in their names. To do J>vvt^ iSook=lovers db nary. INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS AND NON^MEMBERS (Contuuced). this would mean that if six volumes were subscribed for, six would be waiting aside, and probably another half-dozen in process of being despatched to the assistants' instructions. This converts a six volume subscriber into one for eighteen volumes. If, however, due notice is given that certain books will be called for, the volumes w^ill be obtained and placed aside. We only accept subscriptions, with the guarantee that books shall alw^ays be awaiting your next exchange, at double the terms advertised. Of course it is essential that a sufficient list of the books desired is kept with the librarian. LEAVING BOOKS Should you desire to return your books to the TO BE CALLED FOR Library with the intention of applying for them later on, or at another branch, you must be careful to obtain from the librarian a receipt for each book. This receipt takes the form of a small metal shield that is easily attached to the membership token. On producing the membership token and shield at any branch of the Library you wll be entitled to one volume. A separate token as ■well as a shield w^ill be required for each additional volume. SPECIAL PRIVILEGES The Management respectfully request that you AND CONCESSIONS, will not ask any concessions of the assistants. It is desired that everyone shall be treated with uniform attention and courtesy, and when assistants are tempted to break the instructions for working the Library it is in direct disobedience to the Management. SUGGESTIONS AND The Management is always glad to hear of COMPLAINTS. any suggestions for the improvement of the Library Complaints of want of courtesy on the part of the assistants, or difficulty in obtaining the books desired, will have immediate attention. Communications regarding the Library manage- ment should be addressed to Mr. Jesse Boot. HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, TRAVEL, &c. i0i BOOK-LOVERS LIBRARY. ->>■< WORKS OF HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, TRAVEL, ETC.
