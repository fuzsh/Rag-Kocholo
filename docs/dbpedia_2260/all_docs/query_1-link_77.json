        "text": "St Michael and All Angels parish church\n\nMost of the fabric of the parish church of St Michael and All Angels originates from the 15th century, including the rood-screen. The north aisle screen is of a different style and design and possibly comes from another church, whilst the screen at the base of the tower was put together from the remains of the 1625 Jacobean gallery, demolished in 1875. Saint Apollonia was depicted on one of the panels but this has been badly disfigured.[2] The 12th century Norman font according to Arthur Mee (1965) is \"believed by many to be the finest in Devon\".[3] It is sculpted from local Beer stone, and a fibreglass replica cast is currently (January 2016) in storage at Exeter's Royal Albert Memorial Museum.\n\nIn 1749, a peal of eight bells was hung in the church, having been cast by Bilbie of Cullompton.[4] It was then the largest peal in the county. These eight bells were re-cast from the original five hung prior to 1550.[5]\n\nOther buildings\n\nCartwheels is a typical 15th-century Devon cob and timber farmhouse near the church, overlooking the Rectory. Mile End Cottage, on the main road through the village, is the house that Charles Dickens rented for his parents in 1839.[6] Gidley's and Gidley's Cottage in Ide Lane are reputed to be the oldest dwelling in the village. There are numerous other thatched cottages including Pixies cottage (close to the church), and Laurel cottage (in Ide Lane), dating from the 17th century onwards as well as a Victorian prison building, recently renovated.\n\nFrom 2 April 1928, Alphington had a halt on the old Teign Valley railway-line, but this was closed on 9 June 1958. It is still possible to see the abutments of the bridge that used to carry the railway-line over Church Road, and also smaller scale masonry remains at the previous overbridge in Ide Lane."
