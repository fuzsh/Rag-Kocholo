        "text": "“DARWIN WAS HALF RIGHT.“\n\nBack in the spring of 2001, this curious intertitle greeted anyone who tuned in for the premiere of Special Unit 2. The mid-season replacement aired right after Star Trek Enterprise on UPN, and it joined the likes of WB castoffs Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Roswell. Unlike the now-defunct network’s other genre offerings, Evan Katz‘s series was distinctly a comedy. From start to finish, Special Unit 2 is not only a whimsical tale of good versus evil, it reminds us that humor is often the key to comprehending the horrors of day-to-day-life.\n\nSet in Chicago, a street cop named Kate Benson (Alexondra Lee, Paranormal Activity 4) learns that monsters do exist after all. Or, as the covert division Special Unit 2 prefers to call them, “Links.” After she’s partnered with hothead Nick O’Malley (Michael Landes, Final Destination 2), Kate’s brought up to speed on how to deal with these “missing links” between animal and man. They come up against various otherworldly threats such as a fear-eating scarecrow, wall-dwelling ghouls, and sisterly gorgons. It’s never a dull day at Special Unit 2.\n\nThe X-Files forever changed how scripted television does horror. Older entrants like Kolchak: The Night Stalker paved the way, but Chris Carter made the template that modern shows follow when it comes to investigating the paranormal. Special Unit 2 doesn’t deal with aliens (or vampires, as the mere thought of their existence is “ridiculous”), but its two main characters are absolutely caricatures of the iconic Dana Scully and Fox Mulder.\n\nHeading up this colorful cast are Kate and Nick, two good-looking twenty-somethings with complementary personalities. They first meet during a rash of gargoyle-related abductions. Kate Benson, tolerably skeptical about everything in life but the supernatural, is always sensitive to things that go bump in the night. Everyone around Kate always discounted her suspicions until she found a home at Special Unit 2. From the red hair, to the occasional bout of academic insight, she’s the Scully in this duo. Nick, on the other hand, is a crude echo of Mulder. While Fox had his fair share of skin rags, Nick is hardly shy about what he did after hours. In truth, O’Malley’s overt sexuality is a cover-up for a rather horrifying past that’s touched upon from time to time.\n\nIn a smart move, the writers never tried to force a romance between Kate and Nick. Their winsome chemistry comes from a playful revulsion towards one another’s quirks and life choices. At any cost, they always have each other’s backs when the going gets tough. Like when Nick attends Kate’s disastrous high school reunion, he recognizes how selfless his partner is even after being humiliated by her classmates. And Kate puts herself in harm’s way to save her friend when his obsessions and loyalties get the best of him. As much as they are considered an ersatz Mulder and Scully, Nick and Kate’s steadfast friendship is a large part of why fans can look past the show’s other flaws.\n\nIn charge of this troop of misfits is Special Unit 2’s boss, Captain Richard Page (Richard Gant, Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday). He’s the stern fatherly figure that his employees never asked for. And when Captain Page isn’t handling Nick and Kate, he has to contend with the office gnome. Not a metaphor seeing as gnomes reasonably exist in this universe. Due to his penchant for robbery, Carl (Danny Woodburn, Death to Smoochy) is bound to helping Special Unit 2 until further notice. For all that necessary Link background, the team looks to resident biologist Sean (Sean Whalen, 3 From Hell) in the first season, and then to his eager replacement, Jonathan (Jonathan Togo), in the second. Last, but not least, Pauley Perrette (The Ring) has her job cut out for her as Special Unit 2’s overworked PR manager, Alice.\n\nAside from its most obvious muse, Special Unit 2 enthusiastically takes cues from Buffy, CSI, and The Matrix. It was a post-Y2K world where trance music, pop culture laden wit, and wire-fu were all used un-ironically. Slow-mo fights, dance club stakeouts, and celebrity references weren’t uncommon in the series. This all might seem like a demonstration of the show’s low originality, but Special Unit 2 was really a clever send-up of the time period.\n\nOver the span of nineteen episodes, Special Unit 2 created an offbeat collection of beasts and frights rooted in both ancient folklore and modern culture. The episodic format of the show allowed for many single-use yet memorable adversaries. One minute mermen are targeting virginal maidens, the next a monster composed of liposuctioned body fat is looking for its next meal. It may seem as if the majority of these Links are too disposable, but there was a hint of an overarching story and a potential Big Bad. Unfortunately, the show was canceled before the writers could revisit that budding plot. Still, this sundry gang of imaginative creatures will speak to those who like hands-on visual makeup and charmingly dated special effects.\n\nThe writing was breezy and tongue-in-cheek; episodes were easy to jump into without needing too much prior knowledge. Critics at the time were unimpressed only because they took the show at face value. In hindsight, they realize Katz had crafted a misjudged, low-stakes satire of action and horror movies. Special Unit 2 isn’t great television in the conventional sense, but it is a perfect time capsule of an era where small-screen horror was approachable, weird, and just plain fun.\n\nAs a veteran of what we now call the “old internet,” I remember a time when the scariest media you could find online consisted of seemingly innocent image macros containing sinister details lurking in the background. Known as “mindf*ck” images, half the fun of sharing these spooky memes was the anticipation of finding whatever poorly photoshopped demon face that awaited you in the dark.\n\nYears later, I still find myself fascinated by hidden horrors and I’m clearly not the only one – as we can see by the success of films like Osgood Perkins’ Longlegs, which features its own set of demonic background scares. And in honor of this specific kind of subliminal fright, we’ve decided to come up with a list celebrating six of the freakiest hidden scares in film.\n\nFor the purposes of this list, we’ll be classifying “hidden horrors” as any easily missable background scare that isn’t necessarily meant to be caught during your first viewing. And while we’ll only be discussing movies today, I’d also like to give a shout-out to Mike Flanagan’s excellent The Haunting of Hill House series, which features some of the best subtle scares in the genre.\n\nAs usual, don’t forget to comment below with your own favorite hidden frights if you think we missed a particularly spooky one.\n\nWith that out of the way, onto the list…\n\n6. Early Crawler Reveals – The Descent (2009)\n\nSpelunking is already terrifying enough even without the presence of flesh-eating humanoids adapted to living in the cavernous dark, so it makes sense that Neil Marshall’s claustrophobic thriller about a group of women trapped in an ancient cave system is often hailed as one of the scariest movies of all time.\n\nHowever, among Marshall’s varied bag of cinematic tricks is his decision to use the dark itself to obscure terrifying details that only eagle-eyed viewers will be capable of noticing. Case in point: a lot of hardcore fans don’t realize that we’re introduced to the film’s Crawlers almost as soon as the leading ladies enter their titular descent, though these “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it” appearances are initially limited to silhouettes and shifting limbs in the shadows.\n\n5. The Faces – Midsommar (2018)\n\nFrom wall-crawling mothers to subliminal demonology, Ari Aster’s Hereditary already had its fair share of unsettling background scares, but the director’s next film would take hidden horror one step further with the use of nearly imperceptible faces that were seamlessly blended into the background of several scenes.\n\nThrough pareidolia (our species’ natural tendency to recognize familiar facial patterns among random imagery), these faces were meant to evoke a sense of subliminal unease while also hinting at the true (possibly paranormal) nature of the film’s events – as well as Dani and her family’s possible involvement with the Swedish cult.\n\n4. The Witches – The Lords of Salem (2012)\n\nDespite having repeatedly stated that his dream project is a hockey biopic about the Philadelphia Flyers, rocker-turned-filmmaker Rob Zombie has developed an inaccurate reputation as a predictable director who can only tell stories about foul-mouthed redneck murderers. Thankfully, Zombie got the chance to make at least a couple of movies that broke the Firefly Family mold, and the best of these has to be his supernatural spook-fest, The Lords of Salem.\n\nA decidedly more cerebral and surprisingly subdued project than any of the director’s other endeavors (including his underrated fable about survivor’s guilt, Halloween 2), LoS also benefits from a disturbing collection of silent jump scares as the witches stalk and taunt our troubled protagonist from the shadows of her own home – often hiding in the corner of seemingly innocuous shots.\n\nRegardless of what you think about the rest of the film, you’ve got to admit that this is Zombie’s scariest film to date.\n\n3. Background Spirals – Uzumaki (2000)\n\nIt may not be remembered as one of the J-Horror greats (mostly due to the inherent difficulty of translating stylized imagery to live-action), but Higuchinsky’s adaptation of Uzumaki is still one hell of a creepy ride. Telling the story of a town that becomes infected by supernatural spirals, the film also makes use of subliminal patterns in order to immerse viewers in the same madness as its ill-fated characters.\n\nSeveral times throughout the experience, the background imagery will subtly shift into a spiral shape without calling much attention to itself, with these transformations often being accompanied by the ghostly faces of the curse’s previous victims. The CGI isn’t always convincing, but I appreciate the eerie attention to detail here.\n\n2. Mr. Pipes – Ghostwatch (1992)\n\nA simulated live broadcast, Stephen Volk’s subversive mockumentary is still influencing horror media to this very day. From the WNUF Halloween Special to Late Night with the Devil, countless films have attempted to recapture the nostalgic horror of tuning into supposedly cursed programming, but very few have achieved the same level of believability as this surprisingly well-crafted hoax.\n\nIn fact, keeping with the grounded approach, many of the film’s scares are actually hidden deep in the background – with the most disturbing examples involving the cheekily named poltergeist, Mr. Pipes. While in-universe viewers eventually call into the show to report that they’ve seen Pipes lurking in the footage, Ghostwatch never spoils the phantom’s eerie appearances, allowing you to look for these frights at your own risk.\n\n1. Alice’s Real Ghost – Lake Mungo (2008)\n\nA masterclass in both misdirection and slow-burn Found Footage, there are plenty of reasons to love Joel Anderson’s Lake Mungo. However, despite the film’s many qualities, I think what really makes this Australian gem stand out is the fact that it remains an exceedingly rare example of hidden horror being used as a narrative tool.\n\nI won’t be going into detail about the flick’s layered use of barely visible apparitions (it’d be a shame to spoil the experience for those who haven’t yet seen the film) but suffice to say that Lake Mungo’s chilling finale will leave you second-guessing nearly every frame of the experience preceding it.\n\nNot bad for the most low-budget film on this list!"
