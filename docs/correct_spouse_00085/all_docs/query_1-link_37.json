        "text": "Paranormal Activity is an American supernatural horror franchise consisting of eight films and additional media. Created by Oren Peli, the original film premiered in 2007 and was widely released in 2009.\n\nThe films are typically based around various families who become haunted by the demon Asmodeus \"Tobi\" of the Book of Tobit, that stalks, terrifies and ultimately murders several members of the family and other bystanders during the course of the films. The series makes use of production cameras set up and used security cameras or other recording devices in an attempt to present the films as found footage.\n\nThe series has received overall mixed reviews across all films. The first and third films received generally positive critical reception, the second and fifth films received more mixed reviews, and the fourth, sixth and seventh received mostly negative reviews. The series was financially successful, making strong profits based on return on investment. The series as a whole has grossed over thirty times the overall budget.\n\nA seventh mainline installment, titled Next of Kin, was released on October 29, 2021 to the Paramount+ streaming service, with an eighth installment, The Other Side, set for a 2023 release.[1]\n\nFilms[]\n\nParanormal Activity (2007)[]\n\nMain article: Paranormal Activity (film)\n\nSet in October 2006, a young couple, Katie and Micah, who have recently moved to a new house in San Diego, California, are terrorized by a demon that has stalked Katie since childhood. The film is designed to look like a found footage-styled film with Micah filming the activity in their house.\n\nParanormal Activity 2 (2010)[]\n\nMain article: Paranormal Activity 2\n\nSet in August 2006, two months before the events of the first film, Katie's sister Kristi and her family reside in Carlsbad, California, where they experience strange activity after her baby, named Hunter, is born. The film uses security cameras and in some scenes, a hand-held camera to film the activity in the house.\n\nParanormal Activity 3 (2011)[]\n\nMain article: Paranormal Activity 3\n\nSet in September 1988, it focuses on a younger Katie and Kristi, who live with their mother Julie and her boyfriend, Dennis, in Santa Rosa, California. As they experience sightings and then encounter \"Tobi\" the demon for the very first time. Concerned, Dennis decides to set up a few cameras around the house with the help of his friend Randy, who also encounters \"Tobi\" as well. There are many cameras set around the house, one of which is attached to a small oscillating fan that moves the camera back and forth from the kitchen area to the living room and vice versa. The film also uses a hand-held camera handled mainly by Dennis.\n\nParanormal Activity 4 (2012)[]\n\nMain article: Paranormal Activity 4\n\nSet in November 2011, the film focuses on Alex Nelson and her family residing in a neighborhood in Henderson, Nevada. The family began to experience hauntings, concerning Alex's adopted brother, Wyatt, after Katie and her mysterious son, Robbie, move in across the street. Alex is helped by her boyfriend, Ben, to film the activity via MacBook webcams, a video camera, an iPhone camera and Kinect technology.\n\nParanormal Activity: The Marked Ones (2014)[]\n\nMain article: Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones\n\nSet in June 2012, the film follows a Latino community in Oxnard, California, where a group of high school graduates deal with the demon of a mysterious cult which has \"marked\" one of them. They document their experiences using basic tools of recording and with clues from the previous films to try to understand what is happening to them. The Marked Ones is the last film in the series to feature Katie Featherston.\n\nParanormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension (2015)[]\n\nMain article: Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension\n\nSet in December 2013, the film follows the Fleeges, a family of three who, after having relocated to a house in Santa Rosa, California, discover several tapes, set in 1992, that show Katie and Kristi in the midst of their initiation ritual to enter a demonic coven. The family begins to be haunted by the demon when the daughter, Leila, is targeted as she was born on the same date as Hunter from Paranormal Activity 2. Along with normal recorders, the family also discovers a unique video recorder that can visibly show supernatural happenings, which they use to record the increasing paranormal activities.\n\nParanormal Activity: Next of Kin (2021)[]\n\nMain article: Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin\n\nA seventh installment, Next of Kin,[2] was directed by William Eubank with a script by Christopher Landon.[3] Originally scheduled for release on March 19, 2021,[4] the film was delayed to October 29.[5] Due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema, the project skipped its theatrical release and was instead released via streaming, as a Paramount+ exclusive film. [6][7] This installment features a teenage girl named Margot who, alongside her group of friends, attempt to make a documentary on an Amish community to try and find out more about Margot's mysterious past, only for them to discover the horrific secrets the town holds. Although not addressing the events of its six predecessors, Next of Kin does still have a slight connection by featuring the same demon and overarching antagonist Tobi, otherwise known as Asmodeus from the Book of Tobit.\n\nParanormal Activity: The Other Side (2023)[]\n\nMain article: Paranormal Activity: The Other Side\n\nThe day after Next of Kin's release to the Paramount+ streaming service in October, Screen Rant confirmed that an eighth film had been greenlit for an October 2022 release on the service, tentatively entitled Paranormal Activity: The Other Side.[8] Featuring a script written by franchise creator Oren Peli, his first since writing-directing the original 2007 Paranormal Activity film, the film would be directed by Wincent Sommers, and star Sonja Gerhardt, Chethrin Schulze, Nika Sofie, Tamara Hitz, Chany Dakota, and Leon Pelz.[8] After then announcing the film would feature a \"return to Katie Featherston's story with Tob[i]\" the following November,[9] by January 2022, the film was specified by The 25th Frame to be set for an October 14, 2022 release date.[10] However by February 28, British listings service Radio Times reported that the film (described as an action-horror, roughly 89 minutes long) had been delayed to an unspecified 2023 release date. The Other Side will feature four young friends who move into Katie and Kristi's childhood house together before college starts, only to discover the gruesome past of their home and it's connection to the 1988 incidents. Set in the 1990s, it will reportedly address the fire that destroyed the property which has only been mentioned briefly in a few past installments.[11]\n\nJapanese sidequel[]\n\nParanormal Activity 2: Tokyo Night (2010)[]\n\n:Main article:Paranormal Activity 2: Tokyo Night\n\nA non-canon Japanese language Paranormal Activity sequel was released in 2010. It follows Haruka Yamano, who was in a car accident that broke her legs. She stayed home with her brother while their father was away as strange activity started happening in the house. It is later revealed that Haruka killed the possessed Katie in the car accident, causing the demon to transfer to her.\n\nCast and crew[]\n\nCast[]\n\nList indicator(s)\n\nA dark grey cell indicates that the character was not in the film or that the character's presence in the film has yet to be announced.\n\nAn Template:Note label indicates an appearance through archival footage or stills.\n\nA Template:Note label indicates a cameo role.\n\nA Template:Note label indicates a infant version of the character.\n\nA Template:Note label indicates a toddler version of the character.\n\nA Template:Note label indicates an uncredited role.\n\nA Template:Note label indicates a voice-only role.\n\nA Template:Note label indicates a younger version of the character.\n\nCharacter Films Video game Paranormal Activity Paranormal Activity 2 Paranormal Activity 3 Paranormal Activity 4 Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul 2007 2010 2011 2012 2014 2015 2021 2017 Asmodeus \"Tobi\"\n\nof the Book of Tobit Katie Featherston Unseen Katie Featherston Andrew Jacobs Mark Steger Kirby Johnson Jessica Belkin Katie Featherston Henry Ayres-Brown Palmer Naftal Katie Featherston Katie Featherston Chloe Csengery Chloe Csengery[12] Chloe Csengery[13] Micah Sloat Micah Sloat Micah Sloat Dr. Fredrichs Mark Fredrichs Amber Amber Armstrong Diane Ashley Palmer Kristi Rey (née Featherson) Sprague Grayden Sprague Grayden Archive footage, uncredited Jessica Tyler Brown Jessica Tyler Brown\n\n(young) Daniel Rey Brian Boland Ali Rey Molly Ephraim Molly Ephraim Hunter Rey\n\nWyatt Nelson Jackson Xenia Prieto[14] Aiden Lovekamp[15] Aiden Lovekamp William Juan Prieto[16] William Juan Prieto[17]\n\n[18] [19]\n\nMartine Vivis Cortez Dennis Chris Smith Archive footage, uncredited Julie Lauren Bittner Lois Hallie Foote Hallie Foote Randy Rosen Dustin Ingram Lisa Johanna Braddy Alex Nelson Kathryn Newton Ben Matt Shively Robbie Brady Allen Doug Nelson Stephen Dunham Holly Nelson Alexondra Lee Jesse Arista Andrew Jacobs Hector Estrella Jorge Diaz Marisol Vargas Gabrielle Walsh Irma Arista Renée Victor Arturo Lopez Richard Cabral Ryan Fleege Chris J.

Miller TBA Cinematography Michael Simmonds Magdalena Gorka Doug Emmett Gonzalo Amat John Rutland Pedro Luque Production company Blumhouse Productions Distributor Paramount Pictures Paramount+\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nFirst-time director Oren Peli had been afraid of ghosts his whole life, even fearing the comedy film Ghostbusters, but intended to channel that fear into something positive and productive. Peli took a year to prepare his own house for shooting, going so far as to repaint the walls, add furniture, put in a carpet, and build a stairwell. In this time, he also did extensive research into paranormal phenomena and demonology stating, \"We wanted to be as truthful as we could be.\" The decision to make the supernatural entity in the story a demon was a result of the research pointing to the most malevolent and violent entities being \"demons.\"\n\nThe phenomena in the film take place largely at night—the vulnerability of being asleep, Peli reasoned, taps into a human being's most primal fear, stating, \"If something is lurking in your home there's not much you can do about it.\"\n\nAttempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and eliminating the need for a camera crew, a \"higher degree of plausibility\" was created for the audience and they were \"more invested in the story and the characters\". Peli says that the dialogue was \"natural\" because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as \"retroscripting\" used in the making of The Blair Witch Project.\n\nIn casting the movie, Peli auditioned \"a few hundred people\" before finally meeting Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, \"If you saw the footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years.\" During a guest appearance on The Jay Leno Show on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work. The film was shot out of sequence due to Peli's self-imposed seven-day shooting schedule, though Peli would have preferred the story unfold for the actors as he had envisioned it. Sloat, who controlled the camera for a good deal of the film, was a former cameraman at his university's TV station. \"It was a very intense week\", Peli recalled, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the acting footage was being finalized.\n\nParamount and DreamWorks hired screenwriter Michael R. Perry to create Paranormal Activity 2. Oren Peli, the director of the first film, served as a producer for this prequel. Kevin Greutert, director of Saw VI, was initially hired to direct the prequel; however, Lions Gate Entertainment exercised a clause in Greutert's contract to have him direct the final film in the Saw film series. Both of the actors from the first film, Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, reprise their roles in the prequel. Tod Williams directed Paranormal Activity 2, which started production in May 2010 and was released in October the same year.\n\nParanormal Activity 3 and 4 were directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, documentary filmmakers who were well-known for their feature debut Catfish. Production on the third entry began in June, 2011, with a release October 21 of the same year. Filming for the fourth film commenced in June, 2012, with a release of October 19.\n\nA Latin American-themed fifth film, Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones was released on January 3, 2014. Oren Peli, the creator of the franchise, returned to produce the film, while Christopher Landon, a screenwriter who had worked on the prior three entries in the series, served as the writer and director.\n\nThe sixth film in the series, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,[20] was announced to be released on October 25, 2013.[21] However, in August 2013, the release date was pushed back to October 24, 2014.[22]\n\nOn September 17, 2014, the film's title was finalized and the release date was set on March 27, 2015,[23] later changed to October 23, 2015.[20]\n\nIn September 2013, it was confirmed that Gregory Plotkin, a film editor who had edited every release in the series since Paranormal Activity 2, would make his directorial debut with the sixth film.[24][25] Oren Peli, the creator of the franchise, and Jason Blum would return to produce the sixth film. In late September 2013, Paramount hired Almanac writers Jason Pagan and Andrew Stark to write the screenplay.[26] Though series writer Christopher Landon said that several sequels would follow The Ghost Dimension to wrap up the story,[27] producer Jason Blum later confirmed that the film would indeed be the last in the series.[28]\n\nHe said:\n\n\"It’s coming to an end. This is it, the finale. We’re saying it before the movie opens. We’re not going to grind this horror franchise into the ground. This will keep Paranormal Activity as part of this culture and this particular time in a really fantastic way… All the questions that everyone has asked from the past Template:‘Paranormal ActivityTemplate:’ films: What does Tob- look like? What’s the backstory to the families? These questions have been teased out. Now they will be answered.\"\n\nA seventh film was released on October 29, 2021.\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office performance[]\n\nFilms Release date Box Office Gross Box Office Ranking Budget Ref.
