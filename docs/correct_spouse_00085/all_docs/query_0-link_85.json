        "text": "There are plenty of things that go bump in the night. When it comes to the month of October there may be more than ever thanks to watching a glutton of horror movies. We all know there are lots of different subgenres of horror movies but none have been mined as repetitively as the found footage has. Thanks to the one that really started it all (The Blair Witch Project) these types of horror films have really started to run themselves into the ground. And no series seems as ready to put the final nail in the coffin as the Paranormal Activity franchise. Calling these the new Saw would be an understatement, because at least something happens in those movies.\n\nIn 2009, Katie (Katie Featherston) and her nephew Hunter went missing. Their whereabouts still unknown until now (2011) we are informed, thanks to a “Previously, on Paranormal Activity” style opening. Being brought up to speed we find out that Katie and Hunter have left Carlsbad, California, but we are moving on to Henderson, Nevada. What follows is the found footage of a new family – mom and dad, Holly (Alexondra Lee) and Doug (Stephen Dunham); teenage daughter Alex (Kathryn Newton); and six year old (Wyatt Aiden Lovekamp). Alex has a sorta-boyfriend, Ben (Matt Shively), who has a knack for recording their webchats. One night, all hell is breaking loose across the street and it turns out that their neighbor is being carted off to the hospital and the son, Robbie (Brady Allen), is going to stay with them for a few days. Soon enough, all hell starts breaking loose and it all seems linked to Robbie and his mom."
