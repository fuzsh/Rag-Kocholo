        "text": "Continuity mistake: Near the end of the movie when Alex walks from the room at the end of the hall following Wyatt's voice in Katie's house she sees Katie at the end of the hall. Katie charges at Alex and breaks though the door, forcing Alex to jump from the window. If you watch Katie, her shirt starts out black when she is running down the hall to immediately turning white when she breaks through the door. (01:22:00)\n\noddy knocky\n\nQuestion: This is more of an observation than it is a question; however feel free to chime in with an answer. I realize that this is a \"hidden footage\" movie and each scene has to depict that. But Alex's actions at the end of the film seem to go against human logic. She finds her boyfriend dead in her closet, she knows her dad is across the street and that something is terribly wrong. Why would she take the time to find the video recorder, turn it on and take it with her to find her dad. Someone who just found a dead body in her closet would simply run out of the house or call the police; WITHOUT taking the time to worry about the camera."
