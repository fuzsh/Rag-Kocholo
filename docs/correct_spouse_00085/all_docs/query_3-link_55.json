Born in San Francisco's Chinatown, Lee was raised in Hong Kong where he began his journey into martial arts under the tutelage of Yip Man, a master of the Wing Chun style. His early training sparked a lifelong passion for martial arts which would later propel him to global fame. In the 1960s, Lee moved back to the United States, where he studied philosophy at the University of Washington. There, he met Linda Emery, whom he married, and together they had two children. In addition to his studies, Lee also opened a martial arts school, teaching a style he developed called Jeet Kune Do. His unique approach attracted students from various backgrounds, including numerous Hollywood stars. Lee's charisma and talent quickly caught the attention of film producers, leading to roles in several television series, such as The Green Hornet. However, it was his return to Hong Kong and his subsequent leading roles in films like Fists of Fury, Enter the Dragon, and The Way of the Dragon that catapulted him to international stardom. These films showcased not only Lee's martial arts prowess but also his acting ability and his philosophical insights, making him an iconic figure in popular culture. Tragically, Lee's life was cut short when he passed away in 1973 at just 32 years old.

His early life was marked by a rich cultural exposure, with schooling in Switzerland and later Wellington College. Unbeknownst to many, his first professional ambition was not acting; instead, he initially sought a career in diplomacy before the outbreak of World War II redirected his path. Lee served in the Royal Air Force and Special Forces during the war, an experience that honed his resilience and would later inform his gripping portrayals of complex characters. Lee's acting career launched in the late 1940s, but it wasn't until the late 1950s that he became synonymous with horror, playing the role of Count Dracula in a series of Hammer Horror films. These performances solidified him as a titan of the genre and earned him international acclaim. However, he was far from being typecast, displaying remarkable range across diverse roles. His tall stature, deep voice, and intense gaze made him an ideal choice for villainous characters, most notably Saruman in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. In addition to his illustrious acting career, Lee also demonstrated a passion for music. He released several albums and singles in various genres, showcasing his deep, resonant voice. His musical endeavors ranged from opera to heavy metal, the latter of which earned him a place in the \"Metal Hammer\" Golden Gods Awards in 2010.
