Following that film debut, Lee worked primarily as a guest star on episodic television.\n\nWith her angelic blonde looks, she was often cast as the childhood version of a show's regular character, such as a grade-school Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) on the cult favorite series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" or, on two occasions, a tween-aged Dr. Elliot Reid on the often surreal medical sitcom \"Scrubs.\""
