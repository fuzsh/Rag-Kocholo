        "text": "Special Unit 2 is an American science fiction comedy-drama that ran on UPN from April 11, 2001 to February 13, 2002 for two seasons.\n\nSeries summary[]\n\nUnbeknown to many, strange, mythological creatures walk the streets of Chicago: medusas, sandmen and gargoyles being just some of them. While most live quietly among their human neighbours, who are largely oblivious to their existence, others turn to crime - which is where Special Unit 2 come in. Detective Kate Benson (Alexondra Lee) is a newly assigned Special Unit 2 officer, partnered with the callous and jaded detective Nick O'Malley (Michael Landas). They investigate and solve crimes too strange for the regular police force, while reporting to captain Richard Page (Richard Gant) and working with Carl (Danny Woodburn), a kleptomaniac gnome who is the force's link with the strange underworld of Chicago.\n\nBrand connection in Special Unit 2[]"
