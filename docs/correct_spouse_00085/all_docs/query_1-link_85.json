        "text": "Dave – 6th October 2016 – 9pm\n\nCreated by: Rob Grant and Doug Naylor\n\nWritten and directed by: Doug Naylor\n\nLIFE IS BUT A SCREAM\n\nLister (Craig Charles) will claim it’s curry, while based on this week’s evidence, Cat (Danny John-Jules) will argue strongly in favour of sea salt, but ultimately it seems like variety is the spice of life aboard the Dwarf this series. We are now three episodes in to XI – half way – and we’ve already been treated to a romp to an alternative Earth in the style of series VI (“Twentica”) and a more sombre investigative mystery which harkened back to III’s classic two-hander, “Marooned” (“Samsara”).\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\n15 – 101mins – 2016\n\nMOTHER’S PRIDE\n\nMila Kunis transforms from Black Swan to black sheep as the pressures of juggling work and domestic life causes her to go cray-cray at the P.T.A, kicking out her insufferable bum of a husband (David Walton) and failing to kowtow to the playground’s in-crowd – lead by queen bee Christina Applegate – any longer.\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\n15 – 84mins – 2015\n\nNIGHT OF THE CHICKEN DEAD\n\n“Circle, circle, dot, dot: now you have a cooties shot.”\n\nAfter graduating from The Faculty in 1998, Elijah Wood now finds himself battling another supernatural threat on American academia, albeit from the opposite side of the staff room door. A batch of contaminated chicken nuggets turn the prepubescent summer schoolers attending Illinois’ Fort Chicken Elementary into flesh-craving ghouls. Seems Jamie Oliver was right to crack down on school dinners all along!\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\nWait, where’s the review? I hear you ask. Well, #ICYMI on my Twitter feed, yesterday marked the start of a very exciting new opportunity for me, as I became a film reviewer for the website of the excellent 80s Picture House podcast.\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\nDave – Thursday 29th September 2016 – 9pm\n\nCreated by: Rob Grant and Doug Naylor\n\nWritten and directed by: Doug Naylor\n\nSLIME AND PUNISHMENT\n\n“Smeg happens, you just have to roll with it.”\n\n“I’ve been rolling in smeg all my life!”\n\nWhile bantering bunkmates Lister (Craig Charles) and Rimmer (Chris Barrie) bicker over a game of Mineopoly, Kryten (Robert Llewellyn) and Cat (Danny John-Jules) bring a drifting escape pod on board for analysis. Intrigued by the craft’s origins, the boys from the Dwarf investigate the SS Samsara’s mothership, which crashed into an ocean moon 3 million years ago. Finding themselves divided into pairs, they must solve the mystery of what wiped out the eviscerated crew before they drive each other insane.\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\nThe (digital) doors to the CR@Bpendium have now been open for ten months, and since last November I have posted all manner of reviews, from raving about films I have adored to ranting about live performances which haven’t quite cut the mustard. On the passing of Prince, I even took an ill-advised foray into poetry. For my first “blog-day” milestone – my 100th post – I dived back into my archive to bring you an unpublished cinema review of the latest Step Up film, All In, from my “between-blogs” period where I was still writing, but to no audience. Dark days!\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\n12 – 99mins – 1983 – 3D\n\nMUMMY’S VERY ANGRY\n\n“I bet I can overcome your childhood fears…”\n\nEmerging from a swirling cloud of claret, a gawping beheaded fish face drifts, gurning, towards the screen. Blasting out from behind it, Superman-style, a bold, heavily-shadowed multi-coloured font welcomes you confidently to the, err, visual spectacle that is Jaws 3-D. And so Peter Benchley’s killer shark franchise swims on, despite now being far removed from the author’s original prose inspiration.\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\n12 – 86mins – 1996\n\nAN EYE FOR A LIFE\n\nA staple of BBC programming for years before and after, this TV Movie – broadcast in May of 1996 but set on New Year’s Eve 1999 – is something of a black sheep in the serialised sci-fi family drama’s cannon. Premiering during the “wilderness years” after its 1989 cancellation it was intended as a backdoor pilot to a revived series, but never capitalising on its renewed interest in the dormant property. Doctor Who wouldn’t return to weekly episodes for almost another decade.\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\nDave – Thursday 22nd September – 9pm\n\nCreated by: Rob Grant and Doug Naylor\n\nWritten and directed by: Doug Naylor\n\nBIGGER. BETTER. SMEGGIER.\n\n“Have you been drinking the giggle water?”\n\nEvery new series of Red Dwarf has been a reboot of sorts. From the location shooting of II expanding on the grey-scale claustrophobia of the ship-set original run, to the addition of a new main character and the gender-swap of another in III. Since co-creator Rob Grant ejected himself from an airlock after 1993’s series VI leaving Doug Naylor solely in charge at the helm, the boys from the Dwarf have been testing the water with all manner of reinventions, morphing from audience-less sci-fi drama (VII) to broad laugh-prominent farce (VIII).\n\n… Keep Scuttling!\n\n15 – 123mins – 2016\n\nRENÉE-ATRIC MOTHER\n\nTwelve years, many a failed relationship and a considerable number of shedded pounds after her last big screen foray and everyone’s favourite everygirl singleton is back – and everything is v. much as it was after Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, even if her friends are all now settled down with young families and her famous diary is now being typed on an iPad.\n\n… Keep Scuttling!"
