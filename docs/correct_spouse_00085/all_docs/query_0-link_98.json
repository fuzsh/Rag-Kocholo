        "text": "There are several sub-genres within the horror genre, but none as controversial or criticized as the Found Footage sub-genre of Horror. Thanks tot he success of The Blair Witch Project, the genre came right to the forefront with every kind of angle imaginable. Nonetheless, not all Found Footage Horror is bad and I think I found a gem in today’s film. Creep is one of those found footage films that I decided to check out that was written, directed, and stars Patrick Brice (Safety Not Guaranteed) with Mark Duplass (The One I Love) lending a hand in the writing department and he stars in the film as well. Brice plays young videographer Aaron who is just looking to make some money with the skills that he has. One day, he decides to answer an ad from a guy who is looking for a videographer. That is when Aaron meets the mysterious Josef (Duplass) who proceeds to tell Aaron that he has cancer and that he wants to make a project so that his son can watch long after he dies. Aaron agrees to take the job, but the further he goes with the job is when he starts to notice that things are just not adding up and that Josef might not be the person he claims to be after all.\n\nI will admit that at first, I kept thinking to myself where the hell are they going with this film, but when it gets to the good stuff the film gets really good. While Mark Duplass definitely deserves a lot of credit because he was the MVP, I think Patrick Brice deserves some credit as well. He does an excellent job playing the all too trusting Aaron who wants to believe that Josef is telling him the truth about why he is there. Mark Duplass just takes this film to a whole other level with his performance and he was the right man to do it because the role needed the charisma he possesses. I know what you guys are thinking and that is how is the camera work? For the most part, it’s not that bad because you have to remember it’s a videographer shooting the footage so there is minimal shaky camera work at best. That was actually a relief to me as well because I hate the found footage films that just rely on the shaky camera effect. If I wanted to watch that, I would have my two year old nephew walk around with a camera for an hour and the half. I definitely think that this is a film that is worth checking out because the end will shock you or maybe it won’t cause you will see it coming. I am going to give the film an A- for a final grade.\n\nIt is officially October 31ST which means that I want to take the time to officially wish everyone a Happy and Safe Halloween. I have been doing Eddie’s 31 Days Of Halloween since 2012 and it has been a joy to do every year since I love horror and Halloween. I have watched so many amazing films and that is 186 films with today’s entry. I wanted to watch a film that expressed the joy of the month of October and I found that in The Houses October Built. The found footage horror film follows five friends in Brandy (Brandy Schaefer), Zack (Zack Andrews), Bobby (Bobby Roe), Mikey (Mikey Roe), and Jeff (Jeff Larson) as they go searching the country for the most ultimate and terrifying haunted house the country has to offer. The only problem is that while on this journey, they manage to piss off some people from a haunted house and they begin to stalk and terrorize them. Can they find the ultimate haunted house or will the people after them catch up? The film also stars Tansy Alexander (Grey Sheep) as Trannyotomy, Kahl Brice (Sacrament) as Head Clown, Chloë Crampton (Chastity Bites) as Porcelain, Amber Campisi (Kendra) as Amber, Bart Butler (Property Lines) as Haunt House Clown in Alley, and the film was directed by Bobby Roe (The Houses October Built 2).\n\nI am very picky when it comes to Found Footage Horror films because some can be really good or just plain annoying especially with the shaky camera effect. The one thing this one does not really have is the shaky camera effect for the most part, but what it does that annoys me is it cuts when it gets good. You don’t get the full visual of what they do, but it does work because if they are carrying a camera, an attack would end them being able to film it. One of the things I will give this film is that it had some real creepy characters in like Porcelain who was just super creepy. The movie tries everything from a lot of jump scares which is essentially the bread and butter of an haunted house to even including some shots of boobs from a strip club that they visit. Horror wouldn’t be horror without some of those scenes, am I right? The acting is actually pretty decent as they do their best Blair Witch Project impression and the haunted house workers were great as well. In the end, this is definitely a film that I believe is worth watching because it may be one of the better found footage films out there. The film is available on Netflix right now and I think you should give it a shot. I am going to give the film an B+ for a final grade.\n\nI want to start by wishing everyone in the world a very safe and Happy Halloween because the day is finally here. I was looking endlessly for something special to watch for today and I found the film. If it wasn’t for the service Shudder, I may not have found the film WNUF Halloween Special which is a found footage Horror film. Someone finds a tape from 1987 that is simply marked WNUF Halloween Special on it and it’s a special from a news station known as WNUF. The special that the station is airing features their ace reporter Frank Stewart (Paul Fahrenkopf) as he investigates paranormal activity in a house that has been abandoned for 20 years. The house was once the site of a mass murder known as the spirit board murders and Frank is there to debunk it along with some paranormal investigators. The film also stars Nicolette le Faye (Call Girl Of Cthulhu) as Veronica Stanze, Leanna Chamish (Malice) as Deborah Merritt, Richard Cutting (National Treasure: Book Of Secrets) as Gavin Gordon, Brian St. August (Reunion) as Dr. Louis Berger, Helenmary Ball (Witch’s Brew) as Claire Berger, Sabrina Taylor-Smith (Click On This) as Donna Miles, and the film was directed by Chris LaMartina with commercials in the film directed by Shawn Jones, James Branscome, Scott Maccubbin, Lonnie Martin, Matthew Menter, and Andy Schoeb.\n\nI want to start off by saying that this is an incredible film even for a found footage horror film because it’s like you’re watching a TV network. The film has that old 80’s TV news network look to it whether it be the look of the picture or even the graphics. The fact that they created commercials for this film was awesome cause these commercials brought me back like it was the 80’s. I also wanted to say that Paul Fahrenkopf was an absolute joy to watch on screen because he was so believable as a news reporter from the 80’s. The film was very well executed because the costumes were good and they even referenced the right kind of bands for the time. Even the news segments and special reports are incredible to the point I could watch it all day. Some of my favorite commercials in the film were ones like special TV shows they created commercials for or even Heavy Metal Licks album that was for sale. The local businesses commercials were so good that you actually believe that those are real places. The film was kind of a comedy horror film, but towards the end, it has it spooky moments. You have to check this out for yourself, you will not regret it at all. I am going to give the film an A- for a final grade.\n\nOne of the most frightening series in my opinion was Hellraiser especially when the first film was released. The concept of the film alone freaked me out never mind that Pinhead (original was Doug Bradley) freaked me out as well. With that being said, I decided that for today’s film, I would check out the latest in the series Hellraiser: Revelations. Nico (Jay Gillespie) and Steven (Nick Eversman) are best friends that are about to runaway from home and head to Tijuana, Mexico for some unadulterated fun and pleasure. All of the fun comes to an end when they become the owners of a puzzle box that when opened brings experiences that are not know to man. The two disappear and leave their families wondering what happened until one shows up out of nowhere and all hell breaks loose. The film also stars Steven Brand (The Scorpion King) as Ross Craven, Tracey Fairway (A Hologram For The King) as Emma Craven, Sebastien Roberts (One Way) as Peter Bradley, Sanny van Heteren (Unknown) as Kate Bradley, Devon Sorvari (Gilmore Girls) as Sarah Craven, Stephan Smith Collins (NCIS: Los Angeles) as Pinhead, Jolene Andersen (Syrup) as Female Cenobite, Daniel Buran (Major Crimes) as Vagrant, and the film was directed by Víctor García (Return To House On Haunted Hill).\n\nGoing into this film, I didn’t want to completely crap on this film, but unfortunately I kind of have to as a horror fan. I am not going to dog Stephan Smith Collins performance as Pinhead because he had very minimal on screen time. The only thing I will say is that they could have made his suit more form fitting. Doug Bradley always looked convincing as Pinhead and this one just felt like a guy wearing the costume. I do however like the idea of two Pinheads with one known as the Pseudo Pinhead because it makes look like he has a follower or a pinhead in training. I definitely think that was something different for the series and it was kind of cool. Of course, like an Hellraiser film, it’s tries to get weird and test the limits of Horror with the imagery (like two people making out while chained) or the idea of incest when brother and sister begin making out. They also trued something a little different with the film as they added the found footage element to the film especially when the family is trying to figure out what happened. It’s only really during those scenes that you have to deal with the annoying found footage scenes. Other than that, it’s an OK film, it’s definitely not the best in the series, but it’s at least worth one watch. I am going to give the film an C- for a final grade.\n\nI was dying to watch this film The Gallows last year, but when the time for Eddie’s 31 Days Of Halloween came around, it was available anywhere for me to watch it. Now that I found the film available on demand, I decided to watch it for today’s film. Back in the early 1990’s, Beatrice High School attempted to put on a play called The Gallows, but tragically it claimed the life of student Charlie Grimille (Jesse Cross) when the gallow gives way and he was hung to his death. Now 20 years later and the school is trying to put the production back into work with the current crop of students. Reese Houser (Reese Mishler) is having a hard time remembering his lines for the play so he his best friend Ryan (Ryan Shoos) has the bright idea of trying to sabotage the play, but something sinister lurks as the hangman returns to claim his revenge. The film also stars Cassidy Gifford (God’s Not Dead) as Cassidy, Travis Cluff (The Measure Of A Man) as Mr. Schwendiman, Price T. Morgan (The Flip Side) as Stage Boy, Theo Burkhardt (Picture Perfect) as Rick Houser, Alexis Schneider (Con Killer) as Actress In Play, and the film was directed by Cluff and Chris Lofing (Kid HULK).\n\nI didn’t know going into this film that it was a found footage film so if you are not a fan of those types of films then I do not blame you for missing this one. The Gallows is one of those films where it’s a cool idea at the time, but the execution was just horrible. All of my friends that had seen this film told me to avoid it, but it was one of those films where curiosity definitely killed the cat. I had to watch it for myself to see whether they were right or not and they were definitely right. The famous scene in the trailer with Kathy Lee Giffords daughter where she is just sitting there (see picture to the left) before she is taken by the hangman. Yeah, the scene wasn’t as cool as it seemed in the trailer. This is probably my least favorite Blumhouse film made so far. Even though the film’s tragedy is set in the 90’s and takes place today, the film was almost like an homage to classic 80’s horror where a tragedy takes place in a school (e.g. Return To Horror High, Slaughter High). Even though, it tried to be like those films, they didn’t execute properly like those films did. The acting is pretty decent, but if you do not like shaky cameras and unsteady shots then do not watch this one. I am going to give The Gallows an C- for a final grade.\n\nOne of my favorite found footage horror films is V/H/S which I have reviewed the first two films for different years on here for Eddie’s 31 Days Of Halloween. So, when I saw on Netflix that there was another V/H/S film, I just had to watch and review for this years edition. The film is called V/H/S: Viral and it centers around a police chase with three other stories in there. The first story we are presented with is a guy whose girlfriend gets kidnapped during a police chase as well as a story about a magician (Justin Welborn) with a cape that not only grants him the ability to perform magic not like any other, but it has a thirst for humans. The third story centers around an inventor (Gustavo Salmerón) who invents a machine that allows him to travel to an alternate universe, but the universe is not all it cracks up to be when weird things start to happen. The fourth story centers around some skateboarders (Nick Blanco and Chase Newton) who are looking to make it bid by recording a video of them doing crazy stunts. One day, their cameraman suggest that they go to Tijuana to a place no one dares to go. The two of them then have to fight for their lives before they get sacrificed. The film also stars Marian Álvarez (Wounded) as Marta, Shane Brady (Spring) as Taylor, Patrick Lawrie as Kev, Emilia Ares Zoryan (Falling Overnight) as Iris, Chad Guerrero (Nightcrawler) as Uncle Alberto, Noelle Ann Mabry (Ghouls Gone Wild) as Lulu, Emmy Argo (Banshee) as Scarlett, Jessica Luza (Let’s Be Cops) as girl in shower, and the film was directed by Justin Benson (Spring), Gregg Bishop (Dance Of The Dead), Todd Lincoln (The Apparition), Aaron Moorhead (Spring), Marcel Sarmiento (ABC’s Of Death), and Nacho Vigalondo (The ABC’s Of Death).\n\nEvery single of the stories was actually pretty good and there were several stories within the main story which was called Vicious Circles. So, its safe to say that there was actually more than just four stories in total within this film. One my favorite stories within this film had to be the one called bonestorm which was the one about the skateboarders who are trying not to be sacrificed in Tijuana. A lot of that story and some of the other stories introduced the Go Pro camera to the series which was originally based on the idea of VHS tapes that were found, but these are going viral. I would say that Parallel Universe which is the one about the inventor would be my second favorite one only because of the world he enters in. The universe is the complete polar opposite of what are world is in every which way you can imagine. It’s one of those stories that reminds you of the old adage of curiosity killed the cat. For the most part, you know what kind of cinematography you are getting when it comes to a found footage horror film so expect some frequent cuts, shaky cameras, etc. I am definitely hoping (in a way) that they’ll come out with another film for the series because I enjoy watching this one. The acting is pretty good as well and I love the fact that they use a lot of unknown talent in this film. I am going to give this film an B+ for a final grade only because the other two still edge this one out.\n\nAt one time, there was no one in the world that didn’t enjoy a good spoof film with the likes of Airplane!, Naked Gun, Top Secret, and even Spaceballs as some of the choices that were available to you to watch at the time. Then there came a time when I felt that there was just too many of them on the market that were just not that funny. Marlon Wayans who wrote and stars in today’s Cheeseball Cinema film A Haunted House wrote the last great spoof film in Scary Movie 1 and 2. Marlon stepped up his game with A Haunted House which is about a guy name Malcolm (Wayans) who is about to have some big changes in his life. He is allowing his girlfriend Keisha (Essence Atkins) move into his house so that they can go tot he next level in their relationship. The only thing Malcolm doesn’t realize is that Keisha is bringing some baggage with her and its in the form of a demon (ghost) in this film that spoofs Paranormal Activity. The film also stars Nick Swardson (Grandma’s Boy) as Chip The Psychic, Marlene Forte (Star Trek) as Rosa the housekeeper, David Koechner (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy) as Dan the security man, Dave Sheridan (Horrible Bosses) as Bob, Cedric The Entertainer (Ice Age) as Father Williams, J.B. Smoove (The Sitter) as Keisha’s step dad, and the film was directed by Michael Tiddes (A Haunted House 2).\n\nI wasn’t expecting much from this film to be honest with you going into it, but as I really started to watch it I was surprised that it took me this long just to watch it. Marlon Wayans corrected the universe as far as spoof films were concerned because Scary Movie 5 was atrocious and that came out around the same time as this one. I loved the fact that Swardson, Koechner, Cedric The Entertainer, and Wayans were all in the same film together because they were a great combination. Much like The Interview, there were a lot of gay jokes which can be overused and abused at times, but for some reason when it comes from Swardson it can be funny. They basically followed the outline of Paranormal Activity with the constant filming and I have to say that this may be the first found footage spoof that I have ever seen. The movie for the most part was pretty legit as the acting was amazing and if you’re into the T&A aspect of these posts, there is only one quick scene in the film. I do want to say that you have no idea how many times I waited to see something from Alanna Ubach (Waiting) who looked absolutely sexy in this film and there was one time that I thought we were going to, but we were denied. On a scale from 1 being close to an A-list Hollywood film and 5 being the cheesiest film of all time, I am going to give this film a 1.5 for a final grade.\n\nWhat would a Halloween be without Paranormal Activity? Some may say that it would be a better place while others may say that they enjoy watching them. The movie takes place five years after Katie killed her boyfriend Micah, her sister, her brother in law, and kidnapped their son Hunter. According to the film, they still have not been found yet and instead of being in Cali, we are now in Nevada where a suburban family will witness strange things in their neighborhood when a young odd and mysterious child and his mother move in next door. The film stars Katie Featherston (Paranormal Activity), Kathryn Newton (Bad Teacher) as Alex, Matt Shively (The Barrio Tales) as Ben, Aiden Lovekamp as Wyatt, Brady Allen as Robbie, Stephen Dunham (The Mummy) as Doug, Alexondra Lee (What Women Want) as Holly, Alisha Boe (Amusement) as Tara, and Brendon Eggertsen (Just Go With It) as Derek in the found footage horror film directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman.\n\nThere is one thing that I always wonder about watching these films and that is sometimes I regret watching them afterwards. The way they film everything in this film is a little different as the laptops in the house are used as recording devices and at times they get cute with some of the demon happenings, but they’re not scary at all. A knife flies up in the air after the mom had used it and she doesn’t even see where it went. So, how is that scary? They have a book fall off the shelf every once in a while as if to say that it’s a scary thing that happens. Like most of all the films in the series, the real action is at the end when the sh** begins to go down. One thing that I will give them is that who I thought was Hunter doesn’t end up being Hunter which had me fooled. Other than that, there isn’t anything really creative about the film or anything different that would have constituted the idea of another film. We’ll have to wait and see what Paranormal Activity 5 brings us, but for now this film gets a C.\n\nI’ve been pondering for a long time as to whether or not I should watch this film because I am getting a little sick of the found footage horror films that have taken over horror. I do however have to say that this film was far from disappointing, I am actually happy that I took the time to watch this one. Yes the camera shakes can get a little tiring, but this is taking found footage to a whole new level. There are five stories in this film besides the main one we get in the beginning. A bunch of friends like to horse around and film everything that they do from stalking women and forcing them to show their breasts to breaking into places and smashing everything. Well, someone hires the guys to break into a house to steal a VHS tape and what they discover will shock even you. They discover a body in one of the rooms and lots of VHS tapes that they decide to watch. The first VHS tape centers around three guys that get a pair of glasses that records everything. So, they decide to go into to town to find some unsuspecting women to film doing the nasty. What they don’t expect to find is the succubus. In the second VHS tape, we get a couple that are on a road trip, but the husband doesn’t see what is about to come. The third VHS tape centers around a bunch of friends going through the woods while one of them uses them for bait for the glitch killer. The fourth video reminds me of a Rosemary’s Baby type scenario, but through Skype and it involves ghosts. The fifth and final VHS tape that we see evolves four friends going to a party on Halloween, but the party isn’t what they thought it was going to be.\n\nThe film stars Hannah Fierman (God Is Dead), Calvin Reeder (Jerkbeast), Jas Sams (The Art Of Suicide), Sophia Takal (Gabi On The Roof In July), Jason Yachanin (Poultrygeist), Helen Rogers (Block), and Lisa Marie Thomas (Footloose). As I had previously stated in the above paragraph, some of the shots are real shaky and can get a little annoying, but you expected that coming into it. All I can really say is that this is clearly one of the best independent Horror films of the last two years at least. Some of the scenes are real intense especially the first V/H/S tape that is reviewed where you see a man get castrated. If you’re on Netflix, do yourself a favor and check this one out, you won’t regret it. I am giving the film an A- because I never felt the movie lagged at all, it kept my attention, and VHS tapes are still cool in my book."
