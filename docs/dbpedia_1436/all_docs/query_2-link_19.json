        "text": "“If they don’t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.”\n\n― Shirley Chisholm\n\nAfter the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, women of color were often kept from the polls through a variety of tactics. They faced racial and ethnic discrimination and were often discouraged from voting via violence.\n\nAs we celebrate the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage this year we celebrate the hard won achievements of the women who made possible the modern right to vote!\n\nWe have come a long way, but we still have miles to go to achieve equality for all and especially for women of color. The Commission on the Status of Women and Girls enters this centennial with a new commitment to be intentionally inclusive of all women, particularly Black, Brown, and Indigenous women, members of the LGBTQ community, young women, and those most vulnerable among us. Specifically, the Commission has been hard at work to re-imagine the role we play as a support system for the women and girls of California and the ways in which we celebrate our history.\n\nAs a companion to our effort to encourage voting through the Your Vote is Your Voice campaign, we are proud to celebrate the contributions of women of color specifically to the struggle that made votes for women possible.\n\nBelow you will find links to exhibits, articles, videos, and timelines as well as a small snapshot of some of the suffragist heroines we don’t always get to see or celebrate. Please feel free to contact us if you would like to request that include additional links to this collection.\n\nUntold Stories of Black Women in the Suffrage Movement\n\n(Video by Seattle Channel)\n\nIt wasn’t until the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that all African Americans were granted the full right to vote, but the fight began in the 1800s alongside the women’s suffrage movement.
