        "text": "Apportionment and Redistricting Process for\n\nNovember 22, 2021\n\nthe U.S. House of Representatives\n\nSarah J. Eckman\n\nThe census, apportionment, and redistricting are interrelated activities that affect representation\n\nAnalyst in American\n\nin the U.S. House of Representatives. Congressional apportionment (or reapportionment) is the\n\nNational Government\n\nprocess of dividing seats for the House among the 50 states following the decennial census.\n\nRedistricting refers to the process that follows, in which states create new congressional districts\n\nor redraw existing district boundaries to adjust for population changes and/or changes in the\n\nnumber of House seats for the state. At times, Congress has passed or considered legislation\n\naddressing apportionment and redistricting processes under its broad authority to make law affecting House elections under\n\nArticle I, Section 4, of the U.S. Constitution. These processes are all rooted in provisions in Article I, Section 2 (as amended\n\nby Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n\nSeats for the House of Representatives are constitutionally required to be divided among the states, based on the population\n\nsize of each state. To determine how many Representatives each state is entitled to, the Constitution requires the national\n\npopulation to be counted every 10 years, which is done through the census. The Constitution also limits the number of\n\nRepresentatives to no more than one for every 30,000 persons, provided that each state receives at least one Representative.\n\nAdditional parameters for the census and for apportionment have been established through federal statutes, including\n\ntimelines for these processes; the number of seats in the House; and the method by which House seats are divided among\n\nstates. Congress began creating more permanent legislation by the early 20th century to provide recurring procedures for the\n\ncensus and apportionment, rather than passing measures each decade to address an upcoming reapportionment cycle. Federal\n\nlaw related to the census process is found in Title 13 of the U.S. Code, and two key statutes affecting apportionment today are\n\nthe Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 and the Apportionment Act of 1941.\n\nApril 1 of a year ending in â0â marks the decennial census date and the start of the apportionment population counting\n\nprocess; the Secretary of Commerce is to report the apportionment population of each state to the President by the end of that\n\nyear. Within the first week of the first regular session of the next Congress, the President is to transmit a statement to the\n\nHouse relaying state population information and the number of Representatives each state is entitled to. For a discussion of\n\nrecent changes to this timeline, see CRS Insight IN11360, Apportionment and Redistricting Following the 2020 Census. Each\n\nstate receives one Representative, as constitutionally required, and the remaining seats are distributed using a mathematical\n\napproach known as the method of equal proportions, established by the Apportionment Act of 1941. Essentially, a ranked\n\nâpriority listâ is created indicating which states receive the 51st-435th House seats, based on a calculation involving each\n\nstateâs population size and the number of additional seats a state has received. The U.S. apportionment population from the\n\n2020 census was 331,108,434, reflecting a 7.1% increase since 2010, and 7 House seats were reapportioned among 13 states.\n\nAfter a census and apportionment are completed, state officials receive updated population information from the U.S. Census\n\nBureau and the stateâs allocation of House seats from the Clerk of the House. Single-member House districts are required by\n\n2 U.S.C. Â§2c, and certain other redistricting standards, largely related to the composition of districts, have been established by\n\nfederal statute and various legal decisions. Current federal parameters related to redistricting criteria generally address\n\npopulation equality and protections against discrimination for racial and language minority groups under the Voting Rights\n\nAct of 1965 (VRA), as amended. Previous federal apportionment statutes have, at times, included other district criteria, such\n\nas geographic compactness or contiguity, and these standards have sometimes been referred to in U.S. Supreme Court cases,\n\nbut they are not included in the current federal statutes that address the apportionment process. These redistricting principles\n\nand others, such as considering existing political boundaries, preserving communities of interest, and promoting political\n\ncompetition, have been commonly used across states, and many are reflected in state laws today.\n\nThe procedural elements of redistricting are generally governed by state laws, and state redistricting practices can vary\n\nregarding the methods used for drawing districts, timeline for redistricting, and which actors (e.g., elected officials,\n\ndesignated redistricting commissioners, and/or members of the public) are involved in the process. Mapmakers must often\n\nmake trade-offs between one redistricting consideration and others, and making these trade-offs can add an additional\n\nchallenge to an already complicated task of ensuring âfairâ representation for district residents. Despite technological\n\nadvances that make it easier to design districts with increasing geographic and demographic precision, the overall task of\n\nredistricting remains complex and, in many instances, can be controversial. A majority of states, for example, faced legal\n\nchallenges to congressional district maps drawn following the 2010 census, and these legal challenges can take multiple years\n\nto resolve.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\nlink to page 5 link to page 5 link to page 8 link to page 9 link to page 11 link to page 12 link to page 13 link to page 15 link to page 15 link to page 17 link to page 17 link to page 18 link to page 18 link to page 18 link to page 21 link to page 22 link to page 5 link to page 8 link to page 8 link to page 19 link to page 7 link to page 7 link to page 14 link to page 15 link to page 26 link to page 27 link to page 28 link to page 29 link to page 30 link to page 24 Apportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction ..................................................................................................................................... 1\n\nApportionment Process ................................................................................................................... 1\n\nFederal Requirements/Guidelines for Reapportionment: History and Current Policy .............. 4\n\nReapportionment Method and Timeline .................................................................................... 5\n\nRedistricting Process ....................................................................................................................... 7\n\nFederal Requirements/Guidelines for Redistricting: History and Current Policy ..................... 8\n\nPopulation Equality ............................................................................................................. 9\n\nRacial/Language Minority Protections .............................................................................. 11\n\nOther Redistricting Considerations .......................................................................................... 11\n\nCompactness and Contiguity ............................................................................................ 13\n\nPreserving Political Subdivisions ..................................................................................... 13\n\nPreserving Communities of Interest .................................................................................. 14\n\nPromoting Political Competition; Considering Existing District or Incumbent ............... 14\n\nState Processes for Redistricting ............................................................................................. 14\n\nCongressional Options Regarding Redistricting ..................................................................... 17\n\nConcluding Observations .............................................................................................................. 18\n\nFigures\n\nFigure 1.

The\n\nrequirement to have proportional representation in the House is found in the U.S. Constitution,\n\nand constitutional provisions also underlie other elements of the census, apportionment, and\n\nredistricting practices. Figure 1 provides a generalized timeline for how these three interrelated\n\nprocesses occur, and the sections of the report that follow provide additional information on\n\napportionment and redistricting. For a discussion of how the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-\n\n19) pandemic affected the timing of the most recent census and apportionment, see CRS Insight\n\nIN11360, Apportionment and Redistricting Following the 2020 Census. For additional\n\ninformation on the census process, see CRS Report R44788, The Decennial Census: Issues for\n\n2020, and CRS In Focus IF11015, The 2020 Decennial Census: Overview and Issues.\n\nFigure 1.

Graphic created by Amber Hope Wilhelm, CRS Visual Information Specialist.\n\nApportionment Process\n\nApportionment (or reapportionment) refers to the process of dividing seats in the U.S. House of\n\nRepresentatives among the states. Article 1, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution, as amended by\n\nSection 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that seats for Representatives are divided\n\namong states, based on the population size of each state. House seats today are reallocated due to\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n1\n\nlink to page 7 link to page 7 link to page 8 link to page 14 Apportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nchanges in state populations, since the number of U.S. states (50) has remained constant since\n\n1959; in earlier eras, the addition of new states would also affect the reapportionment process, as\n\neach state is constitutionally required to receive at least one House seat.\n\nThe 2020 census reported a 7.1% overall increase in the U.S. apportionment population since the\n\n2010 census, to 331,108,434 individuals.1 The ideal (or average) district population size increased\n\nacross most states following the 2020 census, and some states experienced larger growth levels\n\nthan others.2 Three states experienced decreases in average district population size following the\n\n2020 census.3 The average congressional district population for the United States following the\n\n2020 census was 761,169 individuals.4 Seven U.S. House seats shifted across states following the\n\n2020 census; seven states lost seats and six states gained seats, distributed as shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 2 provides additional historical data on the number of states and number of seats affected\n\nby each apportionment since 1910.\n\nThe map in Figure 2 illustrates changes in statesâ ideal district size and changes in the number of\n\nHouse seats allocated to each state between the 1990 and 2020 apportionments. Regional patterns\n\nof population change observed following previous censuses continued in 2020, as the percentage\n\nof House seats distributed across the Northeast and Midwest regions decreased, and the\n\npercentage of House seats distributed across the South and West regions increased.5 California\n\nhad the largest House delegation following the 2020 census, with 52 seats; Alaska, Delaware,\n\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming each had a single House seat.6\n\n1 The apportionment population reflects the total resident population in each of the 50 states, including minors,\n\nnoncitizens, Armed Forces personnel/dependents living overseas, and federal civilian employees/dependents living\n\noverseas; for more information see U.S. Census Bureau, âCongressional Apportionment: Frequently Asked Questions,â\n\nJanuary 8, 2021, at https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment/about/faqs.html.

Article I, Section 2, requires that\n\nthe national population be counted at least once every 10 years in order to distribute House seats\n\nacross states. Broad parameters for the number of House Members are also contained in Article I,\n\n7 Article I, Section 2, clause 3, originally stated, âRepresentatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the\n\nseveral States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be\n\ndetermined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and\n\nexcluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.â Following the abolition of slavery, the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, Section 2, states, âRepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their\n\nrespective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.â For more\n\ninformation, see Office of the Historian, U.S. House of Representatives, âProportional Representation,â at\n\nhttps://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Proportional-Representation/.\n\n8 Article 1, Section 2, provides that a first census would be taken within three years of the first meeting of Congress,\n\nand until the population was formally enumerated by a census, there would be 65 House Members, allocated among\n\nNew Hampshire (3), Massachusetts (8), Rhode Island (1), Connecticut (5), New York (6), New Jersey (4),\n\nPennsylvania (8), Delaware (1), Maryland (6), Virginia (10), North Carolina (5), South Carolina (5), and Georgia (3).\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n4\n\nlink to page 5 Apportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nSection 2: there can be no more than one Representative for every 30,000 persons, provided that\n\neach state receives at least one Representative.\n\nFederal statute establishes a number of other elements of the apportionment process, including\n\nhow to count the population every 10 years via the decennial census; how many seats are in the\n\nHouse; how those House seats are divided across states; and certain related administrative details.\n\nIn the 19th century, Congress often passed measures each decade to address those factors\n\nspecifically for the next upcoming census and reapportionment. By the early 20th century,\n\nhowever, Congress began to create legislation to standardize the process and apply it to all\n\nsubsequent censuses and reapportionments, unless modified by later acts.9\n\nOne example of such legislation was the permanent authorization of the U.S. Census Bureau in\n\n1902,10 which helped establish a recurring decennial census process and timeline. Other\n\nlegislation established the current number of 435 House seats;11 this number was first used\n\nfollowing the 1910 census and subsequently became fixed under the Permanent Apportionment\n\nAct of 1929.12 Congress also created a more general reapportionment formula and process to\n\nredistribute seats across states. The timeline for congressional reapportionment and current\n\nmethod for allocating seats among states were contained in the Apportionment Act of 1941,\n\nwhich would then apply to every reapportionment cycle, beginning with the one following the\n\n1950 census.13 The size of the House, method for reapportionment, and timeline for\n\nreapportionment are codified in 2 U.S.C. Â§2a and are further detailed in the section below,\n\nalongside the relevant census procedures codified in Title 13 of the U.S. Code.\n\nReapportionment Method and Timeline\n\nThe apportionment steps detailed below are also summarized by the timeline in Figure 1.

Â§2 note.\n\n11 This excludes the nonvoting House seats held by Delegates and the Resident Commissioner; Article I, Section 2, and\n\nresulting apportionment practices, only address Representatives from U.S. states.\n\n12 The 1910 apportionment act (P.L. 62-5, August 8, 1911, 37 Stat. 13, Ch. 5) set the House size at 433, but provided\n\nfor the addition of one seat each to New Mexico and Arizona, if they became states before the next apportionment,\n\nwhich they did. The next enacted apportionment bill was the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 (P.L. 71-13, June\n\n18, 1929, 26 Stat. 21, Ch. 28), which preserved the methods of the preceding apportionment for subsequent\n\napportionments. The enabling acts for Alaska and Hawaii statehood provided temporary increases in the size of the\n\nHouse to provide seats for the new states until the next regular reapportionment, and as a result, the House had 437\n\nseats between 1959 and 1962. See P.L. 85-508, July 7, 1958; P.L. 86-3, March 18, 1959, 73 Stat. 4.\n\n13 P.L. 77-291, November 15, 1941, 55 Stat. 761, Ch. 470.

The priority list rankings are calculated by taking each stateâs apportionment population from\n\nthe most recent census, and multiplying it by a series of values. The multipliers used are the\n\nreciprocals of the geometric means between every pair of consecutive whole numbers, with those\n\nwhole numbers representing House seats to be apportioned.21 The resulting priority values are\n\nordered from largest to smallest, and with the House size set at 435, the states with the top 385\n\npriority values receive the available seats. See the Appendix for additional information on the\n\nmethod of equal proportions and other methods proposed or used in previous apportionments.\n\nThe President then transmits a statement to Congress showing (1) âthe whole number of persons\n\nin each State,â as determined by the decennial census and certain administrative records; and (2)\n\nthe resulting number of Representatives each state would be entitled to under an apportionment,\n\ngiven the existing number of Representatives and using the method of equal proportions. The\n\nPresident submits this statement to Congress within the first week of the first regular session of\n\nCensus: Issues for 2020; and CRS In Focus IF11015, The 2020 Decennial Census: Overview and Issues.\n\n15 13 U.S.C.

The method of equal proportions is sometimes referred to as\n\nthe Huntington-Hill method. Prior to the 1941 act, other apportionment methods could be used; one such alternative\n\nused in several reapportionments was the Webster method. Generally, these apportionment methods vary in how they\n\napproach fractional seat entitlements and what rounding points should be used in order to distribute those fractions of\n\nseats across states. For a discussion of alternate mathematical approaches, see U.S. Census Bureau, âMethods of\n\nApportionment,â July 18, 2017, at https://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/apportionment/\n\nmethods_of_apportionment.html; and Laurence F. Schmeckebier, âThe Method of Equal Proportions,â Law and\n\nContemporary Problems, vol. 17, no. 2 (Spring 1952), pp. 302-313.\n\n21 A geometric mean is the square root of the product of two successive numbers multiplied by each other; the\n\nreciprocal of a geometric mean is 1 divided by the geometric mean. To find the âmultiplierâ for each stateâs second\n\nseat, for example, the geometric mean of 1 and 2 would be used; 1 multiplied by 2 equals 2, and the square root of 2 is\n\n1.41452. The reciprocal of this geometric mean would be 1 divided by 1.41452, or 0.70711.

Each state receives the number of\n\nRepresentatives noted in the Presidentâs statement for its House delegation, beginning at the start\n\nof the next session of Congress (typically, early January of a year ending in â3â).\n\nStates may then engage in their own redistricting processes, which vary based on state laws.\n\nFederal law contains requirements for how apportionment changes will apply to states in the\n\nevent that any congressional elections occur between a reapportionment and the completion of a\n\nstateâs redistricting process. In these instances, states with the same number of House seats would\n\nuse the existing congressional districts to elect Representatives; states with more seats than\n\ndistricts would elect a Representative for the ânewâ seat through an at-large election and use\n\nexisting districts for the other seats; and states with fewer seats than districts would elect all\n\nRepresentatives through an at-large election.23\n\nRedistricting Process24\n\nCongressional redistricting involves creating or redrawing geographic boundaries for U.S. House\n\ndistricts within a state. Redistricting procedures are largely determined by state law and vary\n\nacross states, but states must comply with certain parameters established by federal statute and\n\ncourt decisions. In general, there is variation among states regarding the practice of drawing\n\ndistricts and which decisionmakers are involved in the process. Across states, there are some\n\ncommon standards and criteria for districts, some of which reflect values that are commonly\n\nthought of as traditional districting practices. Districting criteria may result either from shared\n\nexpectations and precedent regarding what districts should be like, or they may result from\n\ncertain standards established by current federal statute and court decisions. These criteria\n\ntypically reflect a goal of enabling âfairâ representation for all residents, rather than allowing\n\narbitrary, or discriminatory, map lines.25\n\nRedistricting efforts intended to unfairly favor one groupâs interests over anotherâs are commonly\n\nreferred to as gerrymandering.26 Packing and cracking are two common terms that describe such\n\ndistricts, but there are various ways in which district boundaries might be designed to advantage\n\nor disadvantage certain groups of voters. Packing describes district boundaries that are drawn to\n\nconcentrate individuals who are thought to share similar voting behaviors into certain districts.\n\n22 P.L. 77-291, November 15, 1941, 55 Stat. 761, Ch. 470. The statute is written to apply to the first regular session of\n\nthe 82nd Congress âand of each fifth Congress thereafter.â\n\n23 2 U.S.C.

Cracking may be thought of as the\n\nopposite of packing, and occurs when individuals who are thought to share similar voting\n\npreferences are deliberately dispersed across a number of districts. This approach dilutes the\n\nvoting strength of a group and can prevent its preferred candidates from receiving a majority of\n\nthe vote in any district.\n\nFor some states, redistricting following an apportionment may be necessary to account for House\n\nseats gained or lost based on the most recent census population count.27 Generally, however,\n\nstates with multiple congressional districts engage in redistricting following an apportionment in\n\norder to ensure that the population size of each district remains approximately equal under the\n\nequality standard or âone person, one voteâ principle (discussed under âPopulation Equalityâ\n\nbelow). Some states might make additional changes to district boundaries in the years following\n\nan initial redistricting; in some instances, such changes are required by legal decisions finding\n\nthat the initial districts were improperly drawn.28\n\nFederal Requirements/Guidelines for Redistricting: History and\n\nCurrent Policy\n\nFrom time to time, Congress considers legislation that would affect apportionment and\n\nredistricting processes. The Constitution requires the apportionment of House seats across states\n\nbased on population size, but it does not specify how those seats are to be distributed within each\n\nstate. Most redistricting practices are determined by state constitutions or statutes, although some\n\nparts of the redistricting process are affected by federal statute or judicial interpretations.29\n\nThe current system of single-member districts (rather than a general ticket system, where voters\n\ncould select a slate of Representatives for an entire state) is provided by 2 U.S.C. Â§2c.30 In\n\naddition to requiring single-member districts, Congress has, at times, passed legislation\n\naddressing House district characteristics. For example, in the 1800s and early 1900s, some federal\n\napportionment statutes included other standards for congressional districts, such as population\n\nequality or geographic compactness.31 None of these criteria is expressly contained in the current\n\nstatute addressing federal apportionment.32\n\n27 Table 1 provides information on which states gained and lost seats following the 2020 census, and Table 2 provides\n\nadditional historical data on the number of states and House seats affected by each apportionment since 1910.\n\n28 See CRS Report R44798, Congressional Redistricting Law: Background and Recent Court Rulings.\n\n29 Ibid.\n\n30 P.L. 90-196, December 14, 1967, 81 Stat. 581. The requirement for single-member districts had previously appeared\n\nin the Apportionment Act of 1842 (June 25, 1842, 5 Stat. 491). For additional history, see Erik J. Engstrom, âThe\n\nOrigins of Single-Member Districts,â ch. 3 in Partisan Gerrymandering and the Construction of American Democracy\n\n(Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2013), pp. 43-55.\n\n31 Examples include a requirement for equal population size âas nearly as practicableâ (âAn Act for the Apportionment\n\nof Representatives to Congress among the several States according to the ninth Census,â February 2, 1872, 17 Stat. 28);\n\nand districts of âcontiguous and compact territoryâ (âAn Act Making an apportionment of Representatives in Congress\n\namong the several States under the Twelfth Census,â January 16, 1901, 31 Stat. 733; âAn Act for the apportionment of\n\nRepresentatives in Congress among the several States under the Thirteenth Census,â P.L. 62-5, August 8, 1911, 37 Stat.\n\n13, Ch. 5). Some of these provisions appeared in several subsequent apportionment bills.\n\n32 P.L. 77-291, November 15, 1941, 55 Stat. 761, Ch. 470.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n8\n\nlink to page 14 Apportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nMany of the other federal parameters for congressional redistricting have resulted from judicial\n\ndecisions.33 It is not uncommon for states to face legal challenges regarding elements of their\n\nredistricting plans.34 One analysis of the 2010 redistricting cycle, for example, found that\n\nredistricting lawsuits had been filed in 38 states,35 and legal challenges to congressional districts\n\nin several states continued for a number of years.36 This report is not intended to be a legal\n\nanalysis.

Under what is known as the âequality standardâ or\n\nâone person, one voteâ principle, the Court has found congressional districts within a state should\n\nbe drawn to approximately equal population sizes.38 Mathematically, there are several ways in\n\nwhich the population difference across districts (or deviation from an ideal district size) may be\n\nexpressed.39\n\nThese equal population standards apply only to districts within a state, not to districts across states. To illustrate how district population sizes can vary across states, Table 3 provides Census\n\nBureau estimates from 1910 to 2020 for the average district population size nationwide, as well as\n\nestimates for which states had the largest and smallest average district population sizes.

One key\n\nstatutory requirement for congressional districts comes from Section 2 of the VRA, as amended,\n\nwhich prohibits states or their political subdivisions from imposing any voting qualification,\n\npractice, or procedure that results in denial or abridgement of the right to vote based on race,\n\ncolor, or membership in a language minority.44 Under the VRA, states cannot draw district maps\n\nthat have the effect of reducing, or diluting, minority voting strength.45\n\nOther Redistricting Considerations\n\nIn addition to requirements of population equality and compliance with the VRA, several other\n\nredistricting criteria are common across many states today, including compactness, contiguity,\n\nand observing political boundaries.46 Some of the common redistricting criteria specified by states\n\nare presented in Table 4. These factors are sometimes referred to as traditional districting\n\nprinciples and are often related to geography. The placement of district boundaries, for example,\n\nmight reflect natural features of the stateâs land; how the population is distributed across a certain\n\nland area; and efforts to preserve existing subdivisions or communities (such as town boundaries\n\nor neighborhood areas).

Additional information may be available from individual states. See the fol owing\n\ntext sections for an explanation of the criteria used as column headings in this table.\n\nNotes: States excluded from this table do not specify any of these criteria for congressional redistricting. These\n\nstates are Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Il inois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\n\nNew Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Some of these states\n\n(Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont) currently have a single House seat. Some states\n\nspecify different criteria for state legislative districts.\n\na. Factor is something that state may âallowâ for consideration.\n\nb. State currently only has one congressional district.\n\nCompactness and Contiguity\n\nAs a districting criterion, compactness reflects the idea that a congressional district should\n\nrepresent a geographically consolidated area.47 Compactness of congressional districts is a\n\nrequirement in 31 states, but often, state laws do not specify precise measures of compactness.48\n\nGenerally, a compact district would tend to have smoother boundaries and might resemble a\n\nstandard geometric shape more than a less compact district. In some conceptualizations, a\n\ncompact district would have an identifiable âcenterâ that seems reasonably equidistant from any\n\nof its boundaries.49\n\nFederal apportionment acts between 1842 and 1911 contained provisions requiring that\n\ncongressional districts be of âcontiguous territory,â50 and most states have included similar\n\nlanguage in their current redistricting laws. For a district to be contiguous, it generally must be\n\npossible to travel from any point in the district to any other place in the district without crossing\n\ninto a different district.51\n\nPreserving Political Subdivisions\n\nMost states require that redistricting practitioners take into account existing political boundaries,\n\nsuch as towns, cities, or counties. In many instances, districts may not be able to be drawn in\n\nways that encompass entire political subdivisions, given other districting standards, like\n\npopulation equality, that could take precedence. Maintaining political subdivisions can also help\n\n47 For additional background on compactness as a redistricting principle, see William Bunge, âGerrymandering,\n\nGeography, and Grouping,â Geographical Review, vol. 56, no. 2 (April 1966), pp. 256-263; Jacob S.

Some state laws direct redistricting authorities to preserve the\n\nâcoreâ of existing congressional districts; other states prohibit drawing district boundaries that\n\nwould create electoral contests between incumbent House Members.52\n\nPreserving Communities of Interest\n\nSome states include the preservation of communities of interest as a criterion in their redistricting\n\nlaws. People within a community of interest generally have a shared background or common\n\ninterests that may be relevant to their legislative representation. These recognized similarities\n\nmay be due to shared social, cultural, historical, racial, ethnic, partisan, or economic factors. In\n\nsome instances, communities of interest may naturally be preserved by following other\n\nredistricting criteria, such as compactness or preserving political subdivisions.53\n\nPromoting Political Competition; Considering Existing District or Incumbent\n\nSome states include measures providing that districts cannot be drawn to unduly favor a particular\n\ncandidate or political party. The term gerrymander originated to describe districts drawn to favor\n\na particular political party,54 and it is often used in this context today. Redistricting has\n\ntraditionally been viewed as an inherently political process, where authorities have used partisan\n\nconsiderations in drawing district boundaries. Districts generally may be drawn in a way that is\n\npolitically advantageous to certain candidates or political parties, unless prohibited by state law.55\n\nSome states, for example, expressly allow the use of party identification information in the\n\nredistricting process, whereas others prohibit it; similarly, some states may allow for practices to\n\nprotect an incumbent or maintain the âcoreâ of an existing district, whereas other states prohibit\n\nany practices that would favor or disfavor an incumbent or candidate.56\n\nState Processes for Redistricting\n\nRedistricting processes are fundamentally the responsibility of state governments under current\n\nlaw and practice. Among the 44 states with multiple House districts, a variety of approaches are\n\ntaken, but generally, states either allow their state legislatures or a separate redistricting\n\ncommission to determine congressional district boundaries.

Graphic created by Amber Hope Wilhelm, CRS Visual Information Specialist.\n\nNotes: Iowa has nonpartisan legislative staff create its redistricting maps but requires legislative approval to\n\nenact them. In New York, redistricting plans also require gubernatorial approval.\n\nHistorically, and in the majority of states today, congressional district boundaries are primarily\n\ndetermined by state legislatures. Currently, 33 states authorize their state legislatures to establish\n\ncongressional district boundaries. Most of these states enable the governor to veto a redistricting\n\nplan created by the legislature; Connecticut and North Carolina do not allow a gubernatorial\n\nveto.57\n\nIn recent years, other states have begun to use redistricting commissions, which may be more\n\nremoved from state legislative politics.58 In 11 states that currently have multiple congressional\n\ndistricts (Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New\n\nYork, Virginia, and Washington), redistricting commissions are primarily responsible for\n\nredrawing congressional districts. In three other states (Maine, Rhode Island, and Utah), a\n\ncommission serves in an advisory capacity during the redistricting process. Commissions may\n\nalso be used as a âbackupâ or alternate means of redistricting if the legislatureâs plan is not\n\nenacted, such as in Connecticut, Indiana, and Ohio.\n\nThe composition of congressional redistricting commissions can also vary; many include\n\nmembers of the public selected by a method intended to be nonpartisan or bipartisan, whereas\n\nother commissions may include political appointees or elected officials, such as in Hawaii and\n\nNew Jersey. A commissionâs membership, the authority granted to it, its relationship to other state\n\ngovernment entities, and other features may affect whether a commission is perceived to be\n\nundertaking an objective process or a more politicized one. Some proponents of redistricting\n\ncommissions believe that using independent redistricting commissions can prevent opportunities\n\n57 See âState-by-State Redistricting Procedures,â Ballotpedia, at https://ballotpedia.org//State-by-\n\nstate_redistricting_procedures.\n\n58 National Conference of State Legislatures, âRedistricting Commissions: Congressional Plans,â July 12, 2021, at\n\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/research/redistricting/redistricting-commissions-congressional-plans.aspx.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n15\n\nApportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nfor partisan gerrymandering and may create more competitive and representative districts.59\n\nOthers, however, believe that political considerations can remain in commission decisionmaking\n\nprocesses, and that the effect of redistricting methods on electoral competitiveness is overstated.60\n\nFor more information on redistricting commissions, see CRS Insight IN11053, Redistricting\n\nCommissions for Congressional Districts.\n\nThe timeline for redistricting also varies across states, and can be affected by state or federal\n\nrequirements regarding the redistricting process; the efficiency of the legislature, commission, or\n\nother entities involved in drawing a stateâs districts; and, potentially, by legal or political\n\nchallenges made to a drafted or enacted redistricting plan.61 In general, the redistricting process\n\nwould usually begin early in a year ending in â1,â once each state has learned how many seats it\n\nis entitled to under the apportionment following the decennial census.62 Many states complete the\n\nprocess within the next year. After the 2010 reapportionment, for example, Iowa was the first\n\nstate to complete its initial congressional redistricting plan on March 31, 2011, and 31 other states\n\ncompleted their initial plans by the end of 2011. The remaining 11 states with multiple\n\ncongressional districts completed their initial redistricting plans by the middle of 2012, with\n\nKansas becoming the final state to complete its initial plan on June 7, 2012.63 Some states may\n\n59 Katie Zezima and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, âVoters Are Stripping Partisan Redistricting Power from Politicians in\n\nAnti-Gerrymandering Efforts,â Washington Post, November 7, 2018, at https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/\n\nvoters-are-stripping-partisan-redistricting-power-from-politicians-in-anti-gerrymandering-efforts/2018/11/07/\n\n2a239a5e-e1d9-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html; Lyle Denniston, âOpinion Analysis: A Cure for Partisan\n\nGerrymandering?â SCOTUSblog, June 29, 2015, at https://www.scotusblog.com/2015/06/opinion-analysis-a-cure-for-\n\npartisan-gerrymandering/.\n\n60 For example, see Alan Abramowitz, Brad Alexander, and Matthew Gunning, âDon't Blame Redistricting for\n\nUncompetitive Elections,â PS: Political Science and Politics, vol. 2839, no. 1 (January 2006), pp. 87-90; David A.\n\nLieb, âNew redistricting commissions splinter along partisan lines,â AP News, September 18, 2021, at\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/elections-ohio-virginia-redistricting-voting-districts-b27ebd5a7dd99ad613ac896ed16ffcde;\n\nMeagan Flynn, âVirginiaâs redistricting commissionâs failure to transcend partisanship has lessons for other states,\n\ncritics say,â Washington Post, October 25, 2021, at https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/25/\n\nredistricting-virginia-lessons-partisan/; and Nick Corasaniti and Reid J.

Given the historically limited role the\n\nfederal government has played in the redistricting process, concerns about federalism may arise in\n\nthe context of certain congressional efforts addressing redistricting. The types of legislative\n\nproposals briefly introduced in this section reflect some common examples of redistricting bills\n\nintroduced in recent Congresses; they are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the options\n\nCongress has considered or could consider related to redistricting.\n\nSome legislative proposals in recent Congresses would establish criteria for districts, such as\n\npopulation equality, compactness, contiguity, or preservation of existing political subdivisions.65\n\nBills have also been introduced that would require states to use independent redistricting\n\ncommissions and/or maintain certain standards of public input and transparency regarding the\n\nredistricting process.66 Some congressional bills include provisions to prevent states from\n\nredistricting more than once following an apportionment, which is a practice sometimes referred\n\nto as âmid-decade redistricting.â67 Other bills would expand oversight by the Department of\n\nJustice under certain circumstances related to existing requirements of, or proposed amendments\n\nto, the VRA.68\n\n64 Justin Levitt and Michael P.

In the 117th\n\nCongress, the House passed H.R. 1, and a similar version of H.R. 1 was also passed by the House\n\nin the 116th Congress. H.R. 1 is a multifaceted bill that addresses multiple areas of election\n\nadministration, among other topics; with respect to redistricting, it would require states to use\n\nindependent redistricting commissions, adopt certain redistricting criteria, and prohibit mid-\n\ndecade redistricting.69\n\nConcluding Observations\n\nApportionment and redistricting address fundamental elements of representational democracy.\n\nDetermining how many elected representatives should serve in the House, and how many people\n\nshould be in each congressional district, are central questions for those who are concerned with\n\nhow responsive the House can be to the interests of the American public. During earlier eras in\n\nthe United States, the number of seats in the House of Representatives generally increased as the\n\nAmerican population increased, and district sizes could be kept more equal over time and across\n\nstates. The House size, however, has been set at 435 seats throughout the last century, while the\n\nnational population has continued to grow and concentrate in certain geographic areas, leading to\n\nlarger constituencies across all House districts over time and disparate district sizes across states.\n\nCertain elements of the apportionment process are established by the U.S. Constitution. This\n\nincludes the requirement for representation in the House based on state population size; the\n\nreallocation of House seats every 10 years upon the completion of a national population count;\n\nand the requirements that each state receives at least one Representative and that there can be no\n\nmore than one Representative for every 30,000 persons. Other elements of the process are\n\naddressed through federal legislation, such as the overall number of House seats or method of\n\ndistributing seats among the states. Congress more regularly legislated in this area prior to the\n\nmid-20th century, passing decennial acts to address upcoming censuses and apportionments, rather\n\nthan creating bills intended to apply for all future reapportionment cycles.\n\nWhereas apportionment is a process largely governed by federal statute, redistricting is a process,\n\nin practice, largely governed by state law. Certain federal standards apply to House districts,\n\ngenerally in the interest of preserving equal access to representation, but the method and timeline\n\nby which those districts are created is largely determined by state law. In states with multiple\n\ncongressional districts, there are a multitude of ways in which district boundaries can be drawn,\n\ndepending upon the criteria used to create the districts. There is often an expectation that\n\ncongressional districts will be drawn in a way that ensures âfairâ representation, but âfairnessâ\n\ncan be a somewhat subjective determination.\n\nMany lawmakers and members of the public may agree on some of the more basic\n\nrepresentational principles embedded in apportionment and redistricting law, but can find it\n\ndifficult to apply those principles in practice. The criteria commonly used for redistricting today\n\nreflect a combination of state and federal statutes, judicial interpretations, and practices from past\n\nredistricting cycles that may require trade-offs between one consideration and another. Ensuring\n\nequal population size across all congressional districts, for example, may be an agreeable goal for\n\nmany individuals. In practice, however, the geographic and demographic distribution of residents\n\nwithin and across states, coupled with requirements to observe state boundaries, provide all states\n\nH.R. 4, H.R. 1799, H.R. 8352, S. 561, and S. 4263; and H.R. 151, H.R. 2978, H.R. 3239, H.R. 5785, and S. 1419 from\n\nthe 115th Congress.\n\n69 For additional information and resources, see CRS In Focus IF11097, H.R. 1 and S. 1: Overview and Related CRS\n\nProducts.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n18\n\nApportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nwith at least one Representative, and maintain a constant number of House seats, make this goal\n\nmore difficult to achieve. Although mapmaking software today can design districts with\n\nincreasing precision with respect to geographic boundaries and population characteristics, this\n\ntechnological capacity has not necessarily simplified the overall task of redistricting. A majority\n\nof states faced legal challenges to congressional district maps drawn following the 2010 census,\n\nreflecting differing perspectives on fairness, representational access, and how competing\n\nredistricting criteria should be weighted.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n19\n\nApportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nAppendix. Determining an Apportionment Method\n\nCongress is a bicameral legislature, in which each state receives equal representation in the\n\nSenate and each stateâs representation in the House is based upon its population. Essentially, any\n\nmethod of apportionment for the House must consider three key variables: (1) the number of\n\nHouse seats; (2) the number of U.S. states; and (3) the apportionment population of each state. A\n\nmathematical decision must also be made regarding how fractions of seats are addressed, since\n\nHouse seats must be allocated as whole numbers, and simple division methods are unlikely to\n\nproduce this outcome for all (or any) states. Because the Constitution does not specify a particular\n\nmethod for apportionment, several options have been considered and utilized throughout history.\n\nWhen determining apportionment, parameters could be set for the number of seats in the House,\n\nthe population size of a district, or both.70 The Constitution, to an extent, addresses House size\n\nand district size by requiring that each state receives at least one House seat and requiring that\n\nthere can be no more than one Representative per every 30,000 persons.71 Yet these provisions\n\nprovide little practical guidance for what the size of the House or the size of a district should be.\n\nBased on the number of states and U.S. apportionment population from the 2010 Census, for\n\nexample, the House could range from a minimum of 50 seats to a maximum size of over 10,000\n\nseats. As a general principle, House size and district size are inversely related: a larger number of\n\nHouse seats means smaller population sizes for districts, and a smaller number of House seats\n\nmeans larger population sizes for districts. Attempts by the Framers and various Congresses to\n\naddress apportionment reveal a number of perspectives on how best to create a representative\n\nlegislature, along with political and logistical considerations related to changes in the size of the\n\nHouse.72\n\nPrioritizing Equal-Sized Districts or Preserving a Fixed House Size\n\nAn apportionment method prioritizing relatively equal district population size would establish a\n\nrepresentation ratio, where there would be one Representative per x number of persons. If the\n\nratio remains the same across apportionment cycles, increases or decreases in the U.S.\n\napportionment population would result in corresponding increases or decreases to the total\n\nnumber of House seats. The representation ratio could also be adjusted to create larger or smaller\n\ndistricts, in order to limit the magnitude of changes to the overall size of the House. If states\n\nreceive fractional allocations of House seats and there is no constraint on the size of the House, a\n\nsimple rounding rule could be utilized to arrive at a whole number of seats for the House overall.\n\nA general example of an apportionment approach prioritizing relatively equal district size\n\nfollows:\n\n1. determine an ideal district population size, d;\n\n70 For additional information, see Michael L. Balinski and H. Peyton Young, Fair Representation: Meeting the Ideal of\n\nOne Man, One Vote (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1982); and Efton Park, âThe Mathematics of\n\nApportionment,â University of Chicago Law School Roundtable, vol. 7, no. 1 (2000), pp. 227-237, available at\n\nhttps://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/roundtable/vol7/iss1/9/?.\n\n71 In practice, each House district must also be geographically contained within a stateâs boundaries; states cannot share\n\ndistricts.\n\n72 For example, the first amendment proposed by James Madison for the Bill of Rights addressed apportionment, but it\n\nwas not ratified. See Akhil Reed Amar, The Bill of Rights (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998), pp. 8-17;\n\nand Rosemarie Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 1776-1850 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell\n\nUniversity Press, 1987).\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n20\n\nApportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\n2. divide each stateâs apportionment population, ps1, ps2 â¦ ps50, by d to determine\n\nhow many House seats a state would be entitled to (its âquotaâ of seats), q; and\n\n3. determine a rounding rule to apply for states in which q is not a whole number.73\n\nUntil the early 20th century, the size of the House generally increased with each apportionment,\n\ndue to the addition of new states and population growth,74 but today, the number of House seats is\n\nset at 435 by federal statute.75 Arguments to expand the House have included expanding the range\n\nof interests that House Members would represent and ensuring that Members remained\n\nknowledgeable about local issues. Yet concerns have also been raised that it would not be feasible\n\nto increase the House size apace with national population growth.76\n\nTo be sure that a particular apportionment conforms to a specified size of the House, each state\n\nmust receive a whole number of seats, and the sum of all statesâ seats must equal the desired total\n\nHouse size. Many apportionment approaches vary on how to address fractional seats, as\n\nremainders will often result when calculating state seat quotas. A general example of an\n\napportionment approach to reach a certain House size follows:\n\n1. a set number of House seats, H, is agreed upon;\n\n2. divide the national apportionment population, pUSA, by H to determine an âidealâ\n\nor average district population size, d, also known as the âinitial divisorâ;\n\n3. divide each stateâs apportionment population, ps1, ps2 â¦ ps50, by d to determine\n\nhow many House seats a state would be entitled to (its âquotaâ of seats), q;\n\n4. determine a rounding rule to apply to any q values that are not whole numbers (to\n\nrepresent actual House seats, which cannot be divided);77 and\n\n5. add these rounded (or adjusted), q values; if this sum does not equal H, determine\n\na method to adjust state quotas so that the sum of the resulting q values equals H.\n\nThe following discussions provide an introduction to several methods that have been used for\n\ncongressional apportionment in the United States. To illustrate how these methods work, for each\n\nmethod an imaginary example is provided in the accompanying table, in which the size of the\n\nHouse is fixed at 20 Members and the seats are divided among four states (states A, B, C, and D)\n\nwith the populations specified in the tables.\n\nHamilton/Vinton Method (Ranking Fractional Remainders)\n\nCongress considered various methods of apportionment after the first census of 1790 and passed\n\nan initial apportionment bill in 1792 that would have utilized what is now known as the\n\nHamilton/Vinton method. President George Washington, however, exercised his first veto on the\n\nmeasure, in part, because the resulting apportionment calculations would have violated the\n\n73 An additional decision rule may also be necessary to ensure that each state receives at least one House seat, as\n\nrequired by the Constitution.\n\n74 An exception occurred in 1842, when the number of House seats decreased; for additional details, see Martin H.\n\nQuitt, âCongressional (Partisan) Constitutionalism: The Apportionment Act Debate of 1842 and 1844,â Journal of the\n\nEarly Republic, vol. 28, no. 4 (Winter 2008), pp. 627-651.\n\n75 P.L. 62-5, August 8, 1911, 37 Stat. 13, Ch. 5.\n\n76 For some of these considerations, see summary provided in Christopher St. John Yates, âA House of Our Own or a\n\nHouse Weâve Outgrown,â Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems, vol. 25 (1992), pp. 174-187.\n\n77 An additional decision rule may also be necessary to ensure that each state receives at least one House seat, as\n\nrequired by the Constitution.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n21\n\nlink to page 26 Apportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nrequirement of at least 30,000 persons per district for multiple states.78 Representative Samuel\n\nVinton later introduced legislation proposing this method, which was enacted, and this\n\napportionment method was first used in 1850 and continued to inform apportionment\n\nconsiderations throughout the rest of the 19th century, in conjunction with the Webster method\n\n(discussed below). The Hamilton/Vinton method is based on a fixed House size, H. Each state\n\nreceives the whole number of seats in its quota, q, of seats. The remainders from q are rank-\n\nordered from largest to smallest, and any additional House seats are apportioned to the states with\n\nthe largest remainders.\n\nTable A-1.

The denominator here is calculated by dividing the national apportionment population (pUSA = 11,882) by the\n\nnumber of House seats (H = 20).\n\nJefferson Method (Largest Divisors)\n\nFollowing the presidential veto of the Hamilton method, Congress adopted the Jefferson method\n\nof apportionment, which was used from 1792 to 1832. The Jefferson method for apportionment is\n\nbased on a fixed House size, H, and each stateâs quota of seats, q, is rounded down to the nearest\n\nwhole number. Often, the sum of the rounded-down q values is less than H. When this occurs,\n\ndivisor values smaller than d are tested until an adjusted divisor, dadj, is found that results in a set\n\nof q values which, when rounded down, sum to H.\n\n78 Although the method contained in the bill was a product of congressional debate, it has become associated with\n\nSecretary of State Alexander Hamilton. President Washington sought opinions from his Cabinet on the apportionment\n\nbill, and Hamilton wrote in support of this approach; Hamiltonâs letter is available at https://founders.archives.gov/\n\ndocuments/Hamilton/01-11-02-0189-0002.

The regular divisor, d, is often used as a starting point to inform what values could work for an adjusted\n\ndivisor, dadj. Here, 550 is used as the adjusted divisor value, but any integer between 513 or 552 would also\n\nproduce a series of q values that, when rounded down, sum to the total House size of 20 seats.\n\nb. The denominator here is calculated by dividing the national apportionment population (pUSA = 11,882) by the\n\nnumber of House seats (H = 20).\n\nWebster Method (Major Fractions)\n\nSome believed that the Jefferson method favored large states, and the Webster method was an\n\napproach first used for apportionment in 1842 and last used for apportionment following the 1930\n\ncensus. The Webster method is similar to the Hamilton/Vinton method but differs in how it\n\naddresses remainders of seats. Each state receives the whole number of seats in its quota, q; then,\n\nq remainders greater than or equal to 0.5 are rounded up to the next whole number, and those\n\nstates receive an additional seat. The example provided in Table A-3 happens to result in the\n\nsame number of House seats as the other examples in this appendix, which treat the House size,\n\nH, as fixed at 20 seats, but performing these initial calculations under the Webster method could\n\nresult in a subsequent adjustment to the number of House seats.79 If the House size remains fixed,\n\nand the initial sum of seats produced by the Webster method does not equal the desired number of\n\nseats, an adjusted divisor, dadj, can be used to calculate q values that, when rounded and summed,\n\nresult in a specific House size.\n\n79 For example, the rounding rule could result in a larger number of House seats (i.e., if each stateâs q had a remainder\n\nof 0.5 or above) or smaller number of House seats (i.e., if each stateâs q had a remainder lower than 0.5) than expected.\n\nExceptions to the Webster method âruleâ would have to be made for any state receiving a quota of less than 0.5 so that\n\nthe state would receive one House seat, as required by the Constitution.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n23\n\nlink to page 28 Apportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nTable A-3.

The method of equal proportions, also known as the Huntington-Hill\n\nmethod, seeks to achieve this objective, and has been used for all House apportionments since\n\n1941. This method differs from the Webster method by rounding up remainders for a stateâs\n\nquota, q, at the geometric mean, G, rather than at the arithmetic mean. The geometric mean is\n\nfound by multiplying two successive numbers together, then taking the square root of their\n\nproduct; here, the successive numbers represent a stateâs q rounded down to the nearest whole\n\nnumber (its âlowerâ quota) and a stateâs q rounded up to the nearest whole number (its âupperâ\n\nquota). Each state receives its âlowerâ quota of seats and then may receive an additional seat if its\n\nquota, q, is greater than or equal to its geometric mean, G.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n24\n\nlink to page 29 link to page 29 Apportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nTable A-4.

If the sum of the rounded geometric means for\n\neach state does not result in the desired number of House seats, there is an additional step: seats\n\ncan be apportioned using a priority list, which essentially ranks each stateâs claim to the ânextâ\n\nHouse seat apportioned (i.e., the 51st-435th seats), after each state receives the one seat it is\n\nconstitutionally entitled to.\n\nTo generate a priority list, each stateâs apportionment population is multiplied by a series of\n\nmultiplier values. The multiplier values are created using the reciprocal of the geometric mean\n\nassociated with each potential successive seat number for the state (above its constitutionally\n\nmandated first seat). For example, the multiplier value for a second House seat in any state would\n\nbe 1/â(1 x 2) or 0.707, the multiplier for a third House seat would be â(2 x 3) or 0.408, and so\n\non.80 The products that result from multiplying these values by each stateâs apportionment\n\npopulation are ranked from largest to smallest to create the priority list, and seats are distributed\n\nuntil H number of seats (currently 385, the number needed to get to a total of 435 seats once each\n\nof the 50 states receives its constitutionally required seat) have been apportioned.\n\n80 The Census Bureau typically calculates and provides a list of priority values for each apportionment; for the 2010\n\npriority list, see U.S. Census Bureau, â2010 Census Apportionment Results,â December 2010, at\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/dec/2010-apportionment-data.html.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n25\n\nlink to page 30 link to page 30 Apportionment and Redistricting Process for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nTable A-5.
