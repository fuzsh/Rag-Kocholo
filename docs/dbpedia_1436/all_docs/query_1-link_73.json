I should note that the outset that most Latino politics (like politics in general) is local. At the local level, a single national-origin group usually dominates the local Latino population, so there is a great possibility of Latino politics being framed in national-origin terms. Increasingly, even at the local level, however, the ethnic dimension of this politics is discussed as Latino or Hispanic. political influence increase and efforts to harness that influence grow. In the 2000 presidential race, for example, both parties made substantive and symbolic outreach to Latinos; each built their potentially winning set of states in the Electoral College on expectations for Latino turnout in specific states. The presumption of these activities is the existence of a “Latino vote” or, more generally a “Latino politics” that can be organized to express a Latino voice in political outcomes. This chapter analyzes the phenomenon of Latino politics with three guiding questions. First, I consider the validity of a Latino politics in the singular that has greater predictive value than the politics of the specific Latino national-origin groups. Here, I define politics broadly to include community-based civic activities, both in the United States and abroad; electoral politics; agenda setting and influence; and representation, with the recognition that the existing scholarship disproportionately focuses on electoral politics. Second, I examine electoral and nonelectoral politics to assess how Latino politics manifests itself and the institutional and demographic barriers that prevent Latinos from meeting the sometimes unrealistic levels of influence expected of them. Finally, I assess possible trajectories for the Latino politics of the next two decades, arguing that this future Latino politics is highly uncertain and is itself under construction.",

        "text": "Latino Civic Engagement\n\nThe most common forms of civic engagement in Latino communities, as in the population as a whole, are voting, organizational activity, charitable activities, and school-based activities. The share of Latinos who participate in each of these activities varies, but rarely exceeds half of adults. In recent presidential elections, for example, approximately 45 percent of Latino U.S. citizen adults voted (de la Garza and DeSipio, 2005); the percentage increased slightly to 47 percent in 2004. Turnout is much higher in Puerto Rican elections (a theme I return to later); more than 82 percent of Puerto Ricans on the island voted in the 2000 elections. Among parents, surveys find that 30 to 40 percent are involved with activities in their children's schools on a regular basis (de la Garza et al., 1992, Tables 8.12 and 10.73). Approximately 40 percent of Latinos report making charitable contributions in a prior year. If church membership is excluded, approximately one-third of Latinos are members of community-based organizations (de la Garza and Lu, 1998). Churches see higher participation rates, in the range of 70 percent, but it is not clear that these activities are civic in nature (DeSipio, forthcoming).\n\nThese levels of participation vary somewhat across Latino national-origin groups, but the intra-Latino differences disappear when socioeconomic differences are accounted for. In general, Latinos participate in these common civic activities at lower rates than non-Hispanic whites or blacks (de la Garza et al., 1992, Table 8.11; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady, 1995: Chapter 8). The one exception to this pattern is self-reported involvement in school-based activities among parents, in which Latino and non-Latino participation rates are similar.\n\nOther forms of civic engagement, such as protest, lobbying, making contributions to or working for political campaigns, and seeking to influence the policy-making process, involve smaller shares of Hispanics. No more than 10 percent of Latinos report having been involved in these activities. These patterns are broadly similar to those of other racial and ethnic groups. Few consistent differences appear among Latino national-origin groups in these less common activities (de la Garza et al., 1992, Table 8.11; DeSipio et al., 1998).\n\nImmigrant Latinos have the opportunity to participate in a form of politics available to few non-Hispanic whites and blacks—involvement in the politics of their home countries or home communities. Similar patterns appear in Latino immigrant transnational behaviors that appear in U.S. political activities (see ). Across a range of electoral, civic, and organizational activities, relatively few participate (DeSipio, Pachon, de la Gaza, and Lee, 2003). Approximately one-third of Latino immigrants reported that they attended a cultural or educational event related to their home country in the past year, but less than 1 in 10 attended a rally for home-country political candidates, attended a meeting to discuss home-country political affairs, or sought assistance from the home-country embassy or consulate. The exception to this pattern is a passive activity, following home-country politics in the news. Dominican immigrants and Puerto Rican migrants are more likely to have been engaged in transnational political activities than Mexican or Salvadoran immigrants (a result that persists in multivariate tests).\n\nTABLE 11-1\n\nLatino Immigrant/Migrant Home National Participation .\n\nThis pattern of lower Latino participation extends to voting as well. Approximately 57.9 percent of U.S. citizen adult Latinos were registered to vote at the time of the 2004 election, and 47.2 percent turned out to vote (see ).6 The registration and turnout rates are approximately 10 percent lower than those of non-Hispanic blacks and 18 percent lower than those of non-Hispanic whites. During the period for which there are reliable data on Latino turnout, they have voted at lower rates than blacks and whites. While these gaps have narrowed slightly, Latino turnout has not increased, despite the considerable growth in outreach to Latino voters over the past 20 years.\n\nTABLE 11-2\n\nRegistration and Turnout Among U.S. Citizen Adults, by Race/Ethnic Group, 2000 .\n\nAlthough there is relatively little research on the effect of immigrant generation on political behavior, available evidence suggests that immigrants are less likely to be involved in civic and nonelectoral political activities than are U.S. citizen Latinos (DeSipio, 2003b). Participation among immigrants generally increases with longer residence in the United States (DeSipio, 1996a). Once naturalized, Latino immigrants participate at lower rate than do U.S.-born Latinos (DeSipio, 1996b; Levitt and Olson, 1996; Minnite, Holdaway, and Hayduk, 1999; Mollenkopf, Olson, and Ross, 2001). Small sample sizes in surveys require some caution in generalization, but at least in terms of voting, the available evidence indicates that the third generation votes at higher rates than the second generation, controlling for demographic predictors of participation (DeSipio, 2003b).\n\nIn sum, Latino engagement in the civic and political life of the United States has been extensively measured, and the patterns found are relatively consistent. Latino engagement looks like that of other populations except that the rates are lower. Latinos have high levels of political efficacy (the sense that they can have individual influence over government) and generally trust government and civic institutions, so that lower levels of participation should not be interpreted as dissatisfaction with U.S. politics. Instead, as I discuss in the next section, the Latino-non-Latino participation gap results from institutional structures that lead to differential levels of mobilization and compositional differences between Latino and non-Latino populations.\n\nInstitutional Structures Shaping Latino Political Engagement\n\nIn 1975, Congress extended VRA coverage to four language-minority communities—Hispanics, Asian Americans, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives. Congress targeted these populations, and not all ethnic or linguistic minorities, on grounds that they had experienced multigenerational exclusion based on linguistic difference. Congress extended to these populations the same coverage that blacks had received in 1965—federal oversight of voter registration, voting procedures, and electoral rule changes—in areas with high concentrations of blacks and lower than average black voter turnout. The 1975 VRA extension added one specific protection for language minorities, bilingual election materials. Congress added to these targeted protections in 1982 when it mandated that jurisdictions had a responsibility to draw districts that would elect the candidate of a covered minority group's choice in areas where the size and concentration of the minority population allowed for drawing such a district. This “majority-minority” districting provision shifted the focus of the act from eliminating barriers to participation to encouraging minority officeholding.\n\nThe overall effect of VRA on Latino empowerment has been positive (but perhaps not as positive as many think), yet these benefits have come at a cost. First, Congress failed to use the opportunity of the 1975 extension to examine why Latinos voted at lower rates than non-Hispanic whites.7 Instead, it simply assumed that the reasons were the same as those for blacks (de la Garza and DeSipio, 1993). In other words, neither in 1975 nor in subsequent debates over VRA extension did Congress assess the unique features of Latino political history that shape Latino political behavior today, most notably the multiple generations of voter manipulation among eligible Hispanic voters. The “one size fits all” solution does not address the core reasons for low Latino electoral participation.\n\nSecond, by creating opportunities for Latino officeholding, in some cases ahead of the community mobilization traditionally necessary to elect people to office, the VRA shifted the focus of weak community and civic organizations away from mass organization and toward electing Latinos to office. This is an important goal. It may have, however, short-circuited the process of organizational development in Latino communities just as group numbers were reaching levels of critical mass sufficient for political mobilization.\n\nFinally, because the VRA linked the needs of all Latinos in a blanket extension to the Spanish-heritage population, it may have eventually undercut legislative or judicial support for continued Latino VRA coverage (the VRA is next up for renewal in 2007). To the extent that Congress examined political history to justify VRA extension to Latinos, it looked primarily to the Mexican American experience and to a lesser degree to that of Puerto Ricans. Other Latinos, including those yet to establish a critical mass through immigration, were brought into coverage, despite an explicit decision by Congress not to extend VRA coverage to all ethnic or linguistic minorities. Congress or the courts may eliminate VRA coverage for all Latinos in the future, including coverage of descendants of Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans who faced sustained electoral manipulation and exclusion, if the perception arises that the primary beneficiaries are post-1965 immigrants and their children.\n\nThe extension of VRA coverage to Latinos in 1975 jumpstarted a new incentive structure for new institutions in American politics to reach out to Latinos. Prior to 1975, Hispanic political participation was characterized by the absence of institutional incentives to participate and the failure to adapt institutions that have successfully spurred mobilization among other populations. The Latino population includes a disproportionate share of individuals who need incentives to vote and to participate in other forms of civic activity, such as new immigrants, Hispanics who were socialized politically during periods when their participation was discouraged by law or practice, and descendants of those never socialized into U.S. politics.\n\nThe experience of Latinos is not unique in U.S. immigrant history. What differs today is that political and civic institutions that mobilized new participants in the past have lost their ability to fill this role in American democracy. Most notable among these are political parties which, from the 1830s on, served as the engine of mass political participation in the United States. This role steadily declined throughout the 20th century as parties shifted their focus to fundraising, candidate recruitment, and technical support for candidates. Contemporary parties do little to mobilize new voters (Wattenberg, 2002). Instead, they have become increasingly skilled at identifying voters who turn out regularly. Prior to an election, they inform regular voters, but reach out to less regular voters only in the most competitive of races. Party skill at drawing electoral districts, single-member plurality electoral systems, and relatively low turnout among new voters reduces the number of these competitive races. The Latino community is disadvantaged by such strategies because it has a higher share of registered voters who do not go to the polls and a higher share of adult citizens who are not registered.\n\nThis selective outreach is reinforced by candidates and campaigns. Increasingly, candidates rely on expensive “air wars” (advertising campaigns) that provide information and encouragement to people who are likely to vote but do little to educate or mobilize people who are more distant from electoral politics. To pay for these air wars, candidates spend a higher share of their time fundraising and less time meeting citizens. Personal outreach, whether by candidates or their supporters, has been shown to spur Latino turnout, even when controlling for the effects of age, education, and income (Shaw et al., 2000).\n\nParties are certainly not the only civic institution that could take a role in mobilization. Unions have traditionally filled this role for many immigrants, as have ethnic civic organizations. But like parties, unions have also declined as mass organizations. Their decline, however, slowed somewhat in the 1990s. Several unions in New York and Los Angeles can attribute their revitalization to outreach to Latinos and other immigrants. Examples include New York's Health and Hospital Workers (Local 1199) and Los Angeles's Hotel Workers and Restaurant Employees. Based on their experiences, the American Federation of Labor has begun to invest in a campaign to reach out to Latinos and other immigrants and to recast trade unionism's traditional animosity toward expansive immigration policies.\n\nCivic organizations can also fill gaps left by the decline in party-based mobilization. The NALEO has experimented over the past four years with targeted mobilization in high- and medium-concentration Latino areas and among the newly naturalized. Although they demonstrate a positive impact on turnout, their efforts are very expensive and are difficult to fund with philanthropic support because of risks that their efforts can be perceived as partisan. Electoral mobilization methodologies are poorly developed, hence their effectiveness is often limited (Green and Gerber, 2004).\n\nState and local electoral laws also shape the opportunity for Latino electoral engagement. Latinos, and particularly Mexican Americans, are overwhelmingly concentrated in “reform” states, such as California. Reform states structured their electoral laws to reduce the power of organized interests and political parties. In California, for example, campaigns for all but state-level and national races are nonpartisan (Segura and Woods, 2002). So, there is no “D” or “R” cue for voters. The absence of this cue makes voting more confusing and difficult, dampening participation among adult citizens with low levels of political socialization. These reform states also practice various forms of direct democracy, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall. These direct democracy tools were passed with the notion that they would decentralize the democracy, but they confuse new participants, increase the information cost of participating, and also create the opportunity for majorities to limit the political gains of electoral minorities. Again, they serve to dampen Latino participation relative to Anglo participation.\n\nMore recently, many reform states have implemented term limits. Initially, term limits served as a boon to Latino officeholding, as they sped the transition from Anglo to Latino officeholders in districts where Latino population concentration rose. After the initial positive impact on Latino electability, however, term limits slowed the development of Latino electoral leadership. Newly elected Latinos did not have the opportunity to develop legislative and leadership skills that many of their Anglo and black predecessors had. Almost as soon as they are elected, these officeholders have to begin to plan their move to the next level of elective office. One reason that there are so few Latinos competing for statewide or national office is that legislatures that traditionally served as training grounds for executive office cannot fill this role when legislators are termed out after six or eight years.\n\nThe impact of the institutional factors on Latino turnout appears in a clear natural experiment examining electoral turnout among Puerto Ricans living on the island and on the mainland (Cámara Fuertes, 2004). Unlike other Latino migrants, Puerto Ricans become immediately eligible to register to vote in the United States upon migration and to vote within one month of arrival. Despite these relatively equal opportunities to participate politically in the United States or in Puerto Rico, turnout in Puerto Rican elections is approximately twice as high as Puerto Rican participation in mainland elections. The explanation for this difference is not entirely institutional; Puerto Rican elections involve contests between parties that are organized around the central question in island politics—status. But the structure of elections also differs, most notably in the near universal voter registration in Puerto Rico, the close competition between the two leading parties, the relative infrequency of elections and smaller number of races being contested, and the clear focus on party affiliation and party loyalty among all candidates. Each of these characteristics makes voting easier in Puerto Rico and increases turnout. At over 80 percent, Puerto Rico boasts a very high turnout among democracies.\n\nLatino Partisanship and Ideology\n\nLatinos are strong partisans (see ). Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans are strong Democrats; Florida Cuban Americans are strong Republicans, while their New Jersey coethnics vote reliably Democratic. This strong partisanship distinguishes Latinos from non-Hispanic whites, who are divided in their loyalties to the two parties. This strong Latino partisanship does not mean that Latinos are as partisan as blacks, who routinely offer the Democrats an eight-to-one advantage nationally.\n\nTABLE 11-5\n\nLatino U.S. Citizen Partisanship and Ideology (%) .\n\nThese levels of Latino partisanship have been relatively stable over the past 25 years. Republicans made some small gains in Latino partisanship during the 1980s, but not in the period since. Rather, the interesting shift has been among some Cuban Americans who have moved more toward the Democrats, or at least used their votes tactically in specific elections. It is quite possible, for example, that Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole among Cuban Americans.\n\nThese partisan loyalties are tied to the issue base of each party. Republicans, for example, often focus on Mexican American opposition to abortion, support for the death penalty, and support for traditional gender roles, to predict that Mexican Americans will become Republican. As I indicated in the discussion of Latino issue preference, these issues rarely drive Mexican American political engagement. Instead, concern with education and social service delivery cements Mexican American and Puerto Rican loyalty to the Democrats. Yet Democrats have not predicted a Florida Cuban conversion. Arguably, however, when Fidel Castro leaves office and foreign policy assumes lower priority on the Cuban American agenda, the same issues that link Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans to the Democrats will spur a shift among Cuban Americans to the Democrats. I do not expect that this will happen quickly, but I also do not see the foundation for non-Cuban Latinos to shift to the Republicans, as some pundits predict.\n\nLatino ideology is less understood and needs further study. Beginning with the Latino National Political Survey, there has been a relatively consistent but surprising finding that Latinos identify themselves ideologically as moderates and conservatives (see ). This ideological self-identification conflicts somewhat with the policy concerns of the community, which generally seek an expanded role for government (and a willingness to pay more taxes to fund these government activities). They also contradict the partisan loyalties of most Latinos to the Democrats. While I do not resolve this conflict here, I suspect that ideological self-identification reflects a different understanding of the meanings of “liberal” and “conservative” in Latino communities. This difference in meaning is particularly evident among immigrants who do not associate liberal and conservative with the same policies that majority populations do. Instead, conservatism reflects a desire to protect what has been achieved. If Latinos see government as an ally in achieving success in U.S. society, both moderates and conservatives can advocate expanded government and increased taxation.\n\nRepresentation and Elective Office\n\nIn the period since the extension of the VRA to Latinos, the number of Latino officeholders has increased dramatically. The only pre-1975 count of Latino officeholders found that, in 1973, there were 1,280 in the 6 states with the largest Latino populations (Lemus, 1973). By 2003, these same states had 4,130 Latino office holders, an increase of 228 percent (see ). Nationally, there were 4,623 Latino office holders in 2003.\n\nTABLE 11-6\n\nLatino Elected Officials 1973–2003, Selected Years .\n\nClearly, Latinos have been gaining access to elective office, but the surge in Latino officeholding has barely kept pace with demographic growth. Because neither immigrants nor new births—the components of growth—can immediately vote, maintaining parity with population growth represents an achievement. That said, Latinos are as underrepresented as they were at the beginning of the modern era of Latino politics. Being a much larger population, however, this has more serious implications for governance and policy making. Less than 1 percent of officeholders nationwide are Latino.\n\nThe vast majority of Latino officeholders are elected for local offices, such as school board members and city council members. Approximately 200 can be found in state legislative offices, in statewide offices, or in the U.S. Congress. One Latino holds a governorship—New Mexico's Bill Richardson—and three Latinos serve in the U.S. Senate. Traditionally, local offices serve as the steppingstones for election to more senior positions, so in some sense the growth in the pool of Latino officeholders bodes well for the future.\n\nSeveral recent elections, however, have cast some doubt on the likelihood of the quick rise of a new pool of Latinos in national and statewide office. Over the past few years, serious Latino candidates have lost races for governor in California and Texas and for the mayoralties of Los Angeles, Houston, and New York. After an initial defeat in 2001, Antonio Villaraigosa was elected mayor of Los Angeles in 2005. All Latinos in the U.S. Congress represent districts at least 40 percent Latino, as do most Latinos in state legislatures. Only one Latino in Congress gained office by beating an Anglo incumbent. There are a few more such seats that are not represented by Latinos, but future gains in officeholding will have to come from victories in districts with lower densities of Hispanics. Should legal challenges to the majority-minority districting provisions of the VRA succeed, such as the Supreme Court's ruling in Shaw v. Reno, steady growth in the number of Latino elected officials could end and underrepresentation will increase.\n\nWhen asked, Latinos indicate that they want to be represented by the best person, not necessarily the best Latino candidate. While I have been dubious of these responses in the past (they appear on multiple surveys), I am increasingly convinced. In several recent elections, and most notably in California's recall replacement election, a large share of Latino voters did not vote for the leading Latino candidate. In the California case, the Latino candidate—Lieutenant Governor Bustamante—ran a poor campaign that did little to reach out to Latino voters. He paid a price for this neglect (DeSipio and Masuoka, 2006). In other recent cases, Latinos in Democratic areas have rejected Latino Republican candidates in favor of white Latino Democrats (Michelson and Leon, 2001).\n\nThe consequences of Latino representation for Latino community empowerment have been less well studied than the individual dimensions of Latino participation and policy preferences (de la Garza, 2004). Studies of this question are considerably more difficult because they require analysis of the political cultures and local political coalitions of individual jurisdictions, but they will take on increasing importance in coming years. The VRA has ensured that the number of Latino officeholders and the share of the Latino population represented by Latino officeholders have steadily increased. As the VRA itself is challenged and new gains have to come at the expense of black populations in some areas, coalitional politics will take on added importance for Latino empowerment.\n\nNaturalization\n\nFuture growth in Latino electoral participation will depend on spurring naturalization trends. A recent estimate indicates that 4.2 million Latino legal permanent residents are eligible for naturalization (as are 3.5 million non-Latino legal permanent residents) (NALEO Educational Fund, 2004). Available survey evidence indicates that the vast majority of Latinos eligible for U.S. citizenship want, someday, to become citizens. Approximately 85 percent of Latino immigrants intend to become U.S. citizens, two thirds of citizenship-eligible Latino immigrants have done something concrete to naturalize, and slightly more than 40 percent have naturalized (DeSipio, 1996a). While achieving this goal will require considerable effort on the part of ethnic and national leaders, alone it will not be sufficient to ensure higher Latino electoral participation.\n\nThe number of Latinos naturalizing is growing (see ). In the early 1990s, the average number of Latinos naturalizing each year rose from 36,000 to 90,000. By 1996, the number had grown to as many as 422,000 and now averages in the high 100,000s. Although Mexican immigrants make up the majority of these new U.S. citizens (as they do of Latino legal immigrants to the United States), the numbers of Dominican, Salvadoran, and Colombian naturalized immigrants have also grown rapidly. The surge of naturalization in the late 1990s—resulting from a combination of a national challenge to the status and rights of U.S. immigrants, Immigration and Naturalization Service policy changes, and active promotion of naturalization rights in immigrant communities—reduced the number of immigrants eligible to naturalize. The number of citizenship-eligible immigrant Latinos remains large, however, and is growing again.\n\nTABLE 11-7\n\nNaturalization Trends by Country of Origin, 1991–2002 .\n\nThe formal rules for naturalization as a U.S. citizen are modest relative to most other immigrant-receiving countries. Immigrants must have resided legally in the United States for five years (three if married to a U.S. citizen). They must also demonstrate the ability to speak, write, and read English and demonstrate knowledge of basic U.S. history and civics. They must submit an application to the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (formerly the naturalization branch of the Immigration and Naturalization Service) and pay a fee of $320, plus a separate $70 fee for finger-printing. As part of the application, they must demonstrate that they are of “good moral character,” generally interpreted to mean that applicants have not committed serious crimes in the United States; are not a public charge (that they have not received needs-based social welfare benefits for more than half of the previous five years); and are willing to take an oath to defend the Constitution that requires that they abjure loyalty to their former sovereign. Applications filed take approximately 15 months for review.\n\nOf these requirements, the most innocuous—the application form—proves to be the most burdensome. Approximately twice as many Latinos eligible for naturalization request but do not complete the application as complete the naturalization process (Pachon and DeSipio, 1994). The current application is 10 pages and includes questions on hereditary titles to nobility and service in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nThis finding partially explains the gap between immigrants who naturalize and immigrants who do not. As with voting, naturalization is more likely to occur among older immigrants with higher incomes and more formal education. Longer residence in the United States and the higher share of life spent in the United States also increase the likelihood of naturalization (DeSipio, 1996a). Among Asian immigrants, there also appears to be a relationship between naturalization and the desire to immigrate relatives, but this relationship is less clear among immigrants from the Americas.\n\nAs was evident during the surge of naturalization in the late 1990s, increased community resources to support naturalization raise the likelihood that interested immigrants will complete the naturalization process. Community-based resources are not a constant. In the past, immigrant service agencies and political parties have promoted naturalization, but today those resources are rare (DeSipio, 1996a). Latino immigrants report that the most important reason for naturalizing is to achieve political voice and to vote, so this elite neglect has an impact on Latino political power.\n\nOne change in the structure of naturalization deserves note and may change the current dynamic. Many immigrant-sending countries, including many Latin American nations, are expanding opportunities for naturalized citizens to maintain the citizenship of their country of origin. While immigrants formally renounce their former citizenship at the time of naturalization, the United States does not prevent its newest citizens from reestablishing their former citizenship. To the extent that concerns about loss of nationality prevented some immigrants from pursuing U.S. citizenship, this new tolerance for and promotion of dual nationality may expand the pool of immigrants pursuing naturalization."
