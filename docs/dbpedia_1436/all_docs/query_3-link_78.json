        "text": "On the February 23, Mexico's, Antonio Lopez Santa Anna, takes possession of San Antonio.\n\nOn March 6, day 13 of the siege, Santa Anna's forces breach the Alamo defenses. All the defenders of the Alamo, 189 men, are killed.\n\nOn April 21, after joining forces with Sam Houston's army, Juan Seguin defeats the Mexican army in the Battle of San Jacinto—a battle that lasted all of 18 minutes.\n\nOn February 15, in Havana Harbor, Cuba, an explosion destroys a U.S. battleship—killing 266 men aboard. The United States subsequently declares war on Spain. The war lasts 13 weeks.\n\nThe Cuban Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Cubano) strikes a deal with the U.S. Congress; in exchange for the rebels' cooperation with U.S. military intervention, the United States promises to leave Cuba at the end of the war.\n\nThe United States acquires Puerto Rico through war and claims it as a territory.\n\nUnder the Platt Amendment, the United States limits Cuban independence as written into the Cuban Constitution. The United States reserves the right to build a naval base on Cuba and enforces that Cuba cannot sign treaties with other countries or borrow money unless it is deemed agreeable to the United States. With these parameters in place, the U.S. government hands the government of Cuba over to the Cuban people.\n\nThe Federación Libre de los Trabajadores (Workers Labor Federation) becomes affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, which in turn breaks from its prior policy of excluding non-whites.\n\nPuerto Ricans are granted U.S. citizenship.\n\nIn February, Congress passes the Immigration Act of 1917, which enforces a literacy requirement on all immigrants.\n\nOn April 6, the United States declares war against Germany, joining WWI.\n\nWith many able-bodied American men off to war, \"temporary\" Mexican workers are encouraged and permitted to enter the United States to work.\n\nIn May, the Selective Service Act becomes law, obligating Mexican immigrants in the United States to register for the draft even though they are not eligible.\n\nOn August 23, Macario Garcia becomes the first Mexican national to receive a U.S. Congressional Medal of Honor, yet is refused service at the Oasis Café near his home in Texas.\n\nPrompted by the WWII labor shortage, the U.S. government launches an agreement with Mexico to import temporary workers (braceros), to fill the void in agricultural work.\n\nDr. Hector Garcia, a witness to racial injustice, begins holding meetings for Mexican Americans to voice their concerns, and in March they establish a new Mexican American movement: the American GI Forum.\n\nThis group gets national attention after a Latino soldier killed in action, Pvt. Felix Z. Longoria, is refused burial in Texas. Then-Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, appalled by this blatant bigotry, makes arrangements for Longoria to be buried at the prestigious Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nOn April 17, 1,400 U.S.-trained Cuban exiles invade Cuba—within 72 hours, Fidel Castro's forces easily defeat the Bay of Pigs Invasion.\n\nAspira (Aspire) is founded to promote the education of Hispanic youth and acquires a national following, serving Puerto Ricans wherever they live in large numbers.\n\nWest Side Story is made into a film; the role of Anita goes to a Puerto Rican, Rita Moreno, who takes home an Academy Award for her performance.\n\nRafael Leonidas Trujillo, dictator of the Dominican Republic, is assassinated in a C.I.A.-backed plot.\n\nU.S. reconnaissance planes discover Soviet missiles in Cuba. Travel to and from Cuba is prohibited. The United States blocks a Soviet plan to establish missile bases in Cuba. The Soviet Premier withdraws the missiles on the condition that the United States publicly declares it will not invade Cuba.\n\nAfter the Community Service Organization turns down Cesar Chavez's request, as their President, to organize farm workers, Cesar and Dolores Huerta resign from the CSO. They form the National Farm Workers Association.\n\nCongress passes the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act establishes affirmative action programs, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender, creed, race, or ethnic background: \"to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past\" (Title VII). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is also established through Title VII to prevent job discrimination.\n\nThe Bracero Program, the government program initially put in place during WWII, ends. It brought Mexican laborers into the country to replace the American men who were fighting overseas. When the war ended the program continued.\n\nStriking workers are subjected to physical and verbal attacks throughout their peaceful demonstrations, and on March 16, the Senate Sub-Committee on Migratory Labor held hearings in Delano.\n\nMarch 17, the morning following the hearings, Cesar Chavez sets out with 100 farm workers to begin his pilgrimage to the San Joaquin Valley. After 25 days, their numbers swell from hundreds, to an army of thousands.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, the state capital is finally in sight. With public sympathy mounting and the spring growing season upon them, growers finally agree to meet with union representatives.\n\nOn March 6, a walkout is planned and coordinated among East L.A. high schools. Approximately 10,000 students peacefully walk out of four schools and are joined by parents and supporters. Police are sent to maintain order—and things get out of hand.\n\nFollowing the police riot, on March 7 the students walk out again. The walkouts continue for two weeks until the demands are met.\n\nJust days after the opening of the HemisFair in San Antonio, Chicano high school students stage walkouts—first in San Antonio, then in 39 towns across Texas, eventually spreading to nearly 100 high schools in 10 states.\n\nJose Angel Gutierrez is the mastermind behind much of this activism.\n\nWillie Velasquez of San Antonio organizes thousands of voter registration drives across the Southwest, encouraging the Latino population to vote.\n\nHe notices, however, that the problem is not the number of Latino voters, but the electoral system. He later would file voting rights lawsuits—never losing a case.\n\nCongress passes the Equal Educational Opportunity Act to create equality in public schools by offering bilingual education to Hispanic students.\n\nRussian-born immigrant Emmy Shafer spearheads a campaign to put an end to bilingualism and make English the official language of Miami. Her push for an English-only Miami is a harbinger of broader anti-immigrant sentiment that would spread across the country in the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\nIn the spring, Fidel Castro announces that any Cuban who wishes to leave may do so. Shortly after this declaration, a ramshackle armada sails from South Florida to the port of Mariel.\n\nOver a period of five months, more than 125,000 Cubans arrive in South Florida.\n\nThe newly arrived Cubans are quickly branded as mentally ill or criminal, following a CBS News story. Although only 4 percent are from mental hospitals, more than 25,000 have criminal records.\n\nThe media perpetuates the stereotype of mentally ill or criminal in shows and movies, such as Miami Vice and Scarface.\n\nThe English-only campaign comes roaring back, with Emmy Shafer again at the helm. In the 1980 election, voters approve the ordinance to end official bilingualism.\n\nSeeking to bring illegal immigration under control while maintaining a stable agricultural labor force, President Ronald Reagan signs the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA). It is intended to toughen U.S. immigration law; border security is to be enforced and employers are now required to monitor the immigration status of their employees. It also, however, grants amnesty to nearly three million immigrants – mostly Mexicans – who had quietly slipped across the border during the 1970s and '80s.\n\nEllen Ochoa becomes the first Hispanic woman to go to space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton names Federico Peña as Secretary of Transportation and Henry Cisneros as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, making them both the first Hispanics to hold those positions. He also appoints Norma Cantú, former Director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, to the position of Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights within the Department of Education. Twenty-five other Hispanics are appointed to positions needing Senate confirmation under this presidency.\n\nNAFTA takes effect, eliminating all tariffs between Canada, Mexico, and the United States within 15 years. Imports from the maquiladoras become duty-free.\n\nOn November 8, Californians pass Proposition 187 with 59 percent of the vote. This bans undocumented immigrants from receiving public education and benefits such as welfare and subsidized health care (with the exception of emergency services); makes it a felony to manufacture, distribute, sell, or use false citizenship or residence documents; and requires any city, county, or state officials to report any suspected or apparent illegal aliens.\n\nProposition 187 is ruled unconstitutional, on the grounds that only the federal government has the authority to regulate immigration. Eliseo Medina spearheads the movement to file lawsuits against Proposition 187.\n\nMedina becomes the first Mexican American Vice President of the Service Employees International Union."
