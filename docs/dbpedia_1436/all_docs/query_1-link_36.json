        "text": "Woman Suffrage Timeline (1840-1920)\n\n1840\n\nLucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton are barred from attending the World Anti-Slavery Convention held in London. This prompts them to hold a Women's Convention in the US.\n\n1848\n\nSeneca Falls, New York is the location for the first Women's Rights Convention. Elizabeth Cady Stanton writes \"The Declaration of Sentiments\" creating the agenda of women's activism for decades to come.\n\n1849\n\nThe first state constitution in California extends property rights to women.\n\n1850\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts, is the site of the first National Women's Rights Convention. Frederick Douglass, Paulina Wright Davis, Abby Kelley Foster, William Lloyd Garrison, Lucy Stone and Sojourner Truth are in attendance. A strong alliance is formed with the Abolitionist Movement.\n\n1851\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts is the site of the second National Women's Rights Convention. Participants included Horace Mann, New York Tribune columnist Elizabeth Oaks Smith, and Reverend Harry Ward Beecher, one of the nation's most popular preachers.\n\nAt a women's rights convention in Akron, Ohio, Sojourner Truth, a former slave, delivers her now memorable speech, \"Ain't I a woman?\"\n\n1852\n\nThe issue of women's property rights is presented to the Vermont Senate by Clara Howard Nichols. This is a major issue for the Suffragists.\n\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" by Harriet Beecher Stowe, is published and quickly becomes a bestseller.\n\n1853\n\nWomen delegates, Antoinette Brown and Susan B. Anthony, are not allowed to speak at The World's Temperance Convention held in New York City.\n\n1861-1865\n\nDuring the Civil War, efforts for the suffrage movement come to a halt. Women put their energies toward the war effort.\n\n1866\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony form the American Equal Rights Association, an organization dedicated to the goal of suffrage for all regardless of gender or race.\n\n1868\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Parker Pillsbury publish the first edition of The Revolution. This periodical carries the motto “Men, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less!”\n\nCaroline Seymour Severance establishes the New England Woman’s Club. The “Mother of Clubs” sparked the club movement which became popular by the late nineteenth century.\n\nIn Vineland, New Jersey, 172 women cast ballots in a separate box during the presidential election.\n\nSenator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas introduces the federal woman’s suffrage amendment in Congress.\n\nMany early suffrage supporters, including Susan B. Anthony, remained single because in the mid-1800s, married women could not own property in their own rights and could not make legal contracts on their own behalf.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment is ratified. \"Citizens\" and \"voters\" are defined exclusively as male.\n\n1869\n\nThe American Equal Rights Association is wrecked by disagreements over the Fourteenth Amendment and the question of whether to support the proposed Fifteenth Amendment which would enfranchise Black American males while avoiding the question of woman suffrage entirely.\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony found the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), a more radical institution, to achieve the vote through a Constitutional amendment as well as push for other woman’s rights issues. NWSA was based in New York\n\nLucy Stone, Henry Blackwell, Julia Ward Howe and other more conservative activists form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) to work for woman suffrage through amending individual state constitutions. AWSA was based in Boston.\n\nWyoming territory is organized with a woman suffrage provision.\n\n1870\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment gave black men the right to vote.

With Frances Willard at its head (1876), the WCTU became an important proponent in the fight for woman suffrage. As a result, one of the strongest opponents to women's enfranchisement was the liquor lobby, which feared women might use their vote to prohibit the sale of liquor.\n\n1876\n\nSusan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage disrupt the official Centennial program at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, presenting a “Declaration of Rights for Women” to the Vice President.\n\n1878\n\nA Woman Suffrage Amendment is proposed in the U.S. Congress. When the 19th Amendment passes forty-one years later, it is worded exactly the same as this 1878 Amendment.\n\n1887\n\nThe first vote on woman suffrage is taken in the Senate and is defeated.\n\n1888\n\nThe National Council of Women in the United States is established to promote the advancement of women in society.\n\n1890\n\nNWSA and AWSA merge and the National American Woman Suffrage Association is formed.

After its publication, NAWSA moves to distance itself from Stanton because many conservative suffragists considered her to be too radical and, thus, potentially damaging to the suffrage campaign.\n\n1896\n\nMary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and Frances E.W. Harper among others found the the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs.\n\nUtah joins the Union with full suffrage for women.\n\nIdaho adopts woman suffrage.\n\n1903\n\nMary Dreier, Rheta Childe Dorr, Leonora O'Reilly, and others form the Women's Trade Union League of New York, an organization of middle- and working-class women dedicated to unionization for working women and to woman suffrage.\n\n1910\n\nWashington State adopts woman suffrage.\n\nThe Women’s Political Union organizes the first suffrage parade in New York City.\n\n1911\n\nThe National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NAOWS) is organized.

The parade was the first major suffrage spectacle organized by the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).\n\nThe two women then organized the Congressional Union, later known at the National Women’s Party (1916). They borrowed strategies from the radical Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in England.\n\n1914\n\nNevada and Montana adopt woman suffrage.\n\nThe National Federation of Women’s Clubs, which had over two million women members throughout the U.S., formally endorses the suffrage campaign.\n\n1915\n\nMabel Vernon and Sara Bard Field are involved in a transcontinental tour which gathers over a half-million signatures on petitions to Congress.\n\nForty thousand march in a NYC suffrage parade.
