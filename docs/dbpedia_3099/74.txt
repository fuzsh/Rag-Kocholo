The Impossible Voyage:

a beautiful journey celebrating Georges Méliès' and our own creativity is now complete.

What a wonderful journey - discovering magic, magical friendships, collaboration and theatrical illusion.

Many thanks to the leaders, directors, designers, and volunteers who made this possible for our students.

Two, nearly sold-out shows, with multiple curtain calls at each - honoring everyone's hardwork, efforts, and dedication.

Artistic Directors Kim Bent and Kathleen Keenan send HUGE Thank Yous to our artistic family members who made the experience possible, memorable, and darn fine!

Taryn Noelle, Stevie De, Robyn Osiecki, Mary Dobbins, Simon Kennedy, along with Dona Bate, Mike Furey and all our incredible volunteers & Parents!
