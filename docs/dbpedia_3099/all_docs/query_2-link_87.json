Bruce Cameron,\n\nFrom my list on books for kids told from a dog’s point of view.\n\nBy Kristin O’Donnell Tubb Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am the author of eleven books for middle-grade readers, including three books from a dog’s point of view. These books have won five state book awards between them, and have been published in other languages. I’ve been writing for young readers for over 20 years. I also live with four furry friends of my own: Cookie (a cockapoo), Myrtle (a pug), Nala (a calico cat), and Daisy (a sweet mutt cat). I miss my big-hearted goldendoodle Lucky every day. And, like my dogs, I can be bribed with cheese.\n\nKristin's book list on books for kids told from a dog’s point of view\n\nWhy did Kristin love this book?\n\nThis is an adapted version of the bestselling adult novel, A Dog’s Purpose by W. Bruce Cameron. It’s a fresh and unique take on why dogs mean so much to us humans, and there are gobs of books in this series (all stand-alone, which is great.

This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis is the remarkable story of one endearing dog's search for his purpose over the course of several lives. More than just another charming dog story, \"A Dog's Purpose\" touches on the universal quest for an answer to life's most basic question: Why are we here? Surprised to find himself reborn as a rambunctious golden-haired puppy after a tragically short life as a stray mutt, Bailey's search for his new life's meaning leads him into the loving arms of 8-year-old Ethan. During their countless adventures Bailey joyously discovers how to be a good dog. But this life as a beloved…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Great Pet Heist\n\nBy Emily Ecton, David Mottram (illustrator),\n\nFrom my list on books for kids told from a dog’s point of view.\n\nBy Kristin O’Donnell Tubb Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am the author of eleven books for middle-grade readers, including three books from a dog’s point of view.

The sneaky plan they devise and why. The relationships between the entire cast of characters which includes not just Butterbean the dog but also Oscar the mynah bird, Walt the cat, a pair of rats named Marco and Polo, and others.\n\nIt is delightful, and you and your young reader will chuckle all the way through this one.\n\nBy Emily Ecton, David Mottram (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Great Pet Heist as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOcean’s Eleven meets The Secret Life of Pets in this “classic caper” (Booklist) following a ragtag group of pets who will do whatever it takes to avoid being sent to the pound.\n\nButterbean knew she wasn’t always a good dog. Still, she’d never considered herself a BAD dog—until the morning that her owner, Mrs. Food, fell in the hallway. Admittedly the tile was slipperier than usual, mostly because Butterbean had just thrown up on it.\n\nNow Butterbean and her fellow pets have to come up with a grand plan to support themselves in case Mrs. Food is unable to keep…\n\nPreview\n\nRobot Dreams\n\nBy Sara Varon,\n\nFrom my list on books for kids told from a dog’s point of view.\n\nBy Kristin O’Donnell Tubb Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am the author of eleven books for middle-grade readers, including three books from a dog’s point of view. These books have won five state book awards between them, and have been published in other languages. I’ve been writing for young readers for over 20 years. I also live with four furry friends of my own: Cookie (a cockapoo), Myrtle (a pug), Nala (a calico cat), and Daisy (a sweet mutt cat). I miss my big-hearted goldendoodle Lucky every day. And, like my dogs, I can be bribed with cheese.\n\nKristin's book list on books for kids told from a dog’s point of view\n\nWhy did Kristin love this book?\n\nI might be cheating a bit on this one; half of the story is told by Dog, yes, but the other half is told by Robot. This is a wordless graphic novel, and it is a deeply moving story about the seasons of friendship.\n\nRobot Dreams shows us just how fragile our dearest relationships can be if we don’t lovingly and tenderly take care of them. This story shows the bliss and joy of a new friendship, the pain of a friendship ending, and the growth it takes to move forward.\n\nI love this book with my whole heart, and I believe it is the perfect graphic novel. It is now an Oscar-nominated animated feature, so I’m not alone in my love of this beautiful story.\n\nBy Sara Varon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Robot Dreams as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis affecting, charming graphic novel about a dog and a robot shows us in poignant detail how powerful and fragile relationships are. After a Labor Day jaunt to the beach leaves the robot rusted, immobilized in the sand, the dog must return alone to the life they shared. But the memory of their friendship lingers, and as the seasons pass, the dog tries to fill the emotional void left by the loss of his closest friend, making and losing a series of friends, from a melting snowman to epicurean anteaters. But for the robot, lying rusting on the beach, the…\n\nPreview\n\nDog Man\n\nBy Dav Pilkey,\n\nFrom my list on graphic novels for young readers.\n\nBy Steve Breen Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI've been an editorial cartoonist and author of children's books for years, and I've always wanted to try my hand at a graphic novel. I'd want to explore this art form even if I didn't have kids. Editorial cartoons deal with serious, heavy issues. Comic strips can get monotonous, and picture books tend to skew young. Graphic novels for kids, however, are 'Goldilocks' projects for me—just right. They allow you to imagine incredible adventures for your characters, they give you an excuse to incorporate wacky humor, and the format provides a chance to have fun with art and design. What's not to love?\n\nSteve's book list on graphic novels for young readers\n\nWhy did Steve love this book?\n\nThis book is immensely entertaining due to its blend of slapstick humor, imaginative storytelling, and simple illustrations. In my mind, no other cartoonist or illustrator can convey so much silliness with so few lines!\n\nPilkey’s creation of a half-dog, half-man hero who finds himself in hilarious predicaments is a simple but genius premise. There are all kinds of wonderful supporting characters, too, like Evil Petey and cute Cat Kid. The comic book style format, drawn by mischief-makers Harold and George, adds to the charm here.\n\nClever wordplay, puns, and relatable themes of friendship, bravery, and perseverance will show you why this book was such a home-run success.\n\nBy Dav Pilkey,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Dog Man as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

I love horror and sci-fi, and I especially love stories that really dig into characters and how they smash into each other. My favorite scary books (and movies, etc.) are funny, and my favorite funny books are kinda scary. It can be super healing and empowering to read books about terrible things that are handled with a heaping scoop of empathy and humor and absurdity.\n\nTravis' book list on friendly freaks, monsters, and cryptids\n\nWhy did Travis love this book?\n\nEpic sci-fi with a cast of Earth-protecting animals.\n\nStar Beasts is told through the POV of Bandit, the newest captain on the team, so we get to learn the ropes along with him (perfect way to tell a story, eh?). It’s as rad as it is cute. Alien animals!\n\nAncient relic collecting! Stinky lemurs! And if you’re anything like me, you will absolutely geek out when you see the Novataur.\n\nI first read this book in self-pubbed form when I met the creators at WonderCon a few years ago. Nicest people on earth, coolest vision for their work, hilarious merch.\n\nAlso, Allyson is a fellow gardener, which is maybe not important to mention here, but it makes me happy.\n\nBy Stephanie Young, Allyson Lassiter (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Star Beasts as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWanna know the real reason Pluto isn't a planet anymore?\n\nBandit is a pup on Earth who leaves his family to join the secret order of the Star Beasts - cosmic creatures sworn to protect Earth and spread goodness throughout the universe. Only thing is, he's having trouble fitting in.

I started with the TV series and fell in love with the characters and humor. (Ice King is my favorite and he’s basically the antithesis of a Gary Stu, so he balances Finn out nicely.) After finishing the 13 seasons on Hulu I started on the graphic novels. It’s definitely the weirdest cartoon around and the plot lines are kinda random, but there are so many gems. Watch the first season. If you don’t like it, then we can’t be friends. So don’t even try.\n\nBy Ryan North, Shelli Paroline (illustrator), Braden Lamb (illustrator)\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Adventure Time, Volume 1 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

(In a good way!)\n\nThe touching story about an unusual pairing–a dog and a frog–is about friendship, acceptance, loss, and finally accepting loss.
