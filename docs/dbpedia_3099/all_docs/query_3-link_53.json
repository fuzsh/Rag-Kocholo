        "text": "Most people who watch cat videos online do it for fun. I do it for a living. And so it was with great interest that I learned of another soul, all the way across the country, who shared my obsession with the form. Like me, Will Braden had turned his love of cat videos into a profession by collecting and compiling them into a film he called CatVideoFest, now showing on a limited run at lucky movie theaters across the country. But would people actually gather to watch on the big screen the kind o things they can usually catch just scrolling through their phones? I was eager to find out.\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nI bought tickets to CatVideoFest 2024, showing at my local art house theater, for myself and my two daughters, who mostly think that smart phones were invented so they could watch cat videos on mine while waiting at the dentist office or while stuck in traffic. When my youngest has a nightmare, I soothe her with postings from a twitter account called “Cats That Heal Your Depression.”\n\nCats on Screen\n\nOur screening was full of similar fans. One theater goer told me that this is not his first year attending CatVideoFest, which has been running in some for or another for the better part of a decade. He told me that sometimes we just need something made of pure joy.\n\nAnother man, visiting the theater with his wife, said he was there in support of “childless cat ladies,” which had recently been denigrated by a politician on a podcast.\n\nMy kids and I settled in with popcorn and candy to watch the show.\n\nThe film was seventy-three minutes long, and ran the gamut from silly to hilarious to heartwarming. Braden’s short student film, Henri, which imagines his cat as a bored French artist riddled with ennui, was a definite highlight, as were the silly songs which punctuated several of the videos.\n\nAs a professional cat-video watcher myself, I was pleased to see that we had some of the same tastes in what makes for a good cat video. I saw the chimera Maine Coon I covered last month, as well as Momo the feline pottery artist. There really was something to love for every kind of cat lover.\n\nMy kids adored it. They laughed loudly through the entire film, though I’m not sure it’ll have any kind of long-term grip on them. After all, watching cat videos is something they do every day anyway.\n\nGiving Back to Animals in Need\n\nBut there are good reasons—aside from supporting local theaters—to watch this film instead of just scrolling through your phone. Braden’s efforts also go to supporting animal shelters in the area where the film is shown — a portion of each ticket sales goes to help local animals in need, and he’s raised over $150,000 dollars in this way since his project began.\n\nBut mostly, he’s hoping these movies just bring a bit of joy to the lives of those watching them. He says, “Everyone deserves a fun cat video to distract them from all the tough stuff in life.”\n\nAin’t that the truth.\n\nLooking for more PetHelpful updates?
