        "meta_description": "The Impossible Voyage by Notes, released 01 June 2006\n\n1. Mabouloff&#39;s Creation\n2. The Automabouloff\n3. All&#39;s Well...\n4. Stones, Pillows\n5. The Sky Will Welcome Us\n6. Advent\n7. Submerged\n8. Parade\n\nNotes was a project I began around 2005 with Adam Rodriguez. It was a constant effort to blend electronic and acoustic instruments with visuals and cinematic experience. Notes went through quite a few line up changes, with this album being based around myself, Adam Rodriguez and Andy Park.\r\n\r\nThe Impossible Voyage is a unique film from 1904 that is aesthetically exciting today as just about any other film. They fly a train into the sun. You must see it.\r\n\r\nWe toured around this album projecting the film behind us as we played to it. It was a delicate dance of triggering samples, watching for explosions, creating underwater sounds and making a sort of music to dream to.\r\n\r\n-Gabriel Sullivan\r\n\r\nThis album was written as an original score to George Melies&#39; silent film, The Impossible Voyage.\r\n\r\nAll songs written by Notes\r\n\r\nRecorded at The Root Cellar and Big Block Studios.",
