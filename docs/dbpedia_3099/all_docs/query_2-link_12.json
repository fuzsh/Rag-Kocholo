        "text": "The Impossible Voyage Production\n\nI composed a new electronic music score for the film of George Méliès ” Impossible Voyage” (1904). George Méliès was a French filmmaker famous for leading many technical and narrative developments in the earliest cinema. He was an innovative master in the use of special effects.\n\nThe project was initialized by Mr Daniel Kapelian, head of audiovisual and new media at French Embassy of South Korea and “Institut Français de Corée du Sud”. The film was shown to the audience in Seoul and Busan in October 2011 and I played live my music to accompany the movie during the performance.\n\nI really enjoyed the Geoge Melies Impossible Voyage project. I’m honored to compose a music for this more than 100 years old fantastic masterpiece.\n\nAt the ages of silent film, the story of the movie was only expressed by the gestures and moves of the actors. I composed the music in a similar way as for a modern ballet. In each scene of “Impossible Voyage” one can see the characters moving and gesticulating, expressing their feelings with their bodies. I created rhythms synchronizing their gestures and making them move like dancers.\n\nThe music consists of five parts: The Preparation, The Escape, Into The Sun, Under The Sea, The Return.\n\nEach part is written in an electronic music mood with beats, sonic atmospheres, sequences, gimmicks, special effects. I also used some ethnic samples of my recordings sessions of musicians from all over the World.\n\nThis new colorized version of the film, restored by Lobster Films – Paris is a 20 minutes story.\n\nI played live for the opening ceremony inside Seoul Station of the exhibition “Souvenirs From Earth”.I also played on the 5th of October 2011 and for overture of the French Night the 8th of October at Busan International Film Festival.\n\nFor the performances I used Ableton Live running on a Mac Book pro with an Akai apc40 as midi controller.\n\nThese events were sponsored by Louis Quatorze. It is an amazing lifestyle brand marrying traditional craftsmanship with a modern twist.\n\nThe gig was good despite the rather poor acoustic quality of the place: a big station hall from 1925 that obviously initially wasn’t designed for concerts…But it all went well and I received great feedback from the people joining the performance.\n\nA few days later I moved to Busan, a city in the south of the country where I performed Impossible Voyage at the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF 2011).\n\nMy Korean “Riviera” staying in Busan started with the exhibition of Isabelle Huppert, a French well-known actress, “Woman of Many Faces”. The exhibition was followed by a reception on a terrace between the skycrapers of Busan – an amazing view over this modern city.\n\nI rehearsed at the festival big hall the night before my performance and I encountered many technical problems which I was busy solving until early morning hours. The Busan Grand Hall theatre is an fantastic new place with changing color lights on the roof – a building that was finalised only a few weeks before the festival.\n\nMy performance in Busan the day after was at the opening of The French Night. My part was included between a 120 people-symphonic orchestra and the screening of “The Artist”, a French film by Michel Hazavicius with Jean Dujardin."
