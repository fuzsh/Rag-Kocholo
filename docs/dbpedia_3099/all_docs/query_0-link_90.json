        "text": "Martin offers a fictionalized rendering of the extraordinary 19th-century cross-country “Voyage of Discovery” headed by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.\n\nPrivate Nathan (Nat) Daniel Luck, the upbeat, first-person fictional narrator of the author’s retelling of Lewis and Clark’s two-year exploratory North American adventure, has finished his day’s work at their winter camp in the small village of Cahokia, Indiana Territory, where the members of the expedition have been preparing to head up the Mississippi as soon as the ice melts on the connecting Missouri River. Arriving at the local tavern, Nat spots his friend, Charles (Charlie) Floyd, waiting for him outside the door. Charlie has disturbing news to impart: He has learned from Captain Clark that there is a saboteur who has infiltrated the ranks. Clark has assigned Charlie the task of secretly watching all members of the crew to ferret out the infiltrator, and Charlie wants Nat to help him with this task. The novel is based on records from the expedition, including detailed diaries from Lewis and Clark, and selected historical publications and websites. What Martin brings to the story are his imaginative and dramatic renditions of the personalities and interactions among the many voyage participants, particularly their individual responses to the life-threatening experiences they encountered. The fictional saboteur provides a lingering background tension even to scenes that are otherwise tranquil and joyful. A skillful wordsmith, the author crafts descriptions of the Missouri River that give the powerful waterway the status of a full-fledged character: “It was a potent brown entity with as many different moods and personalities as those of us who traveled upon it.” Portrayals of the Indigenous tribes encountered by the explorers, while generally respectful, reveal the depth of European prejudice against the native peoples.\n\nLively, entertaining, and historically compelling, with a final clever twist.\n\nThe sequel to It Ends With Us (2016) shows the aftermath of domestic violence through the eyes of a single mother.\n\nLily Bloom is still running a flower shop; her abusive ex-husband, Ryle Kincaid, is still a surgeon. But now they’re co-parenting a daughter, Emerson, who's almost a year old. Lily won’t send Emerson to her father’s house overnight until she’s old enough to talk—“So she can tell me if something happens”—but she doesn’t want to fight for full custody lest it become an expensive legal drama or, worse, a physical fight. When Lily runs into Atlas Corrigan, a childhood friend who also came from an abusive family, she hopes their friendship can blossom into love. (For new readers, their history unfolds in heartfelt diary entries that Lily addresses to Finding Nemo star Ellen DeGeneres as she considers how Atlas was a calming presence during her turbulent childhood.) Atlas, who is single and running a restaurant, feels the same way. But even though she’s divorced, Lily isn’t exactly free. Behind Ryle’s veneer of civility are his jealousy and resentment. Lily has to plan her dates carefully to avoid a confrontation. Meanwhile, Atlas’ mother returns with shocking news. In between, Lily and Atlas steal away for romantic moments that are even sweeter for their authenticity as Lily struggles with child care, breastfeeding, and running a business while trying to find time for herself.\n\nThrough palpable tension balanced with glimmers of hope, Hoover beautifully captures the heartbreak and joy of starting over.\n\nA young woman’s experience as a nurse in Vietnam casts a deep shadow over her life.\n\nWhen we learn that the farewell party in the opening scene is for Frances “Frankie” McGrath’s older brother—“a golden boy, a wild child who could make the hardest heart soften”—who is leaving to serve in Vietnam in 1966, we feel pretty certain that poor Finley McGrath is marked for death. Still, it’s a surprise when the fateful doorbell rings less than 20 pages later. His death inspires his sister to enlist as an Army nurse, and this turn of events is just the beginning of a roller coaster of a plot that’s impressive and engrossing if at times a bit formulaic. Hannah renders the experiences of the young women who served in Vietnam in all-encompassing detail. The first half of the book, set in gore-drenched hospital wards, mildewed dorm rooms, and boozy officers’ clubs, is an exciting read, tracking the transformation of virginal, uptight Frankie into a crack surgical nurse and woman of the world. Her tensely platonic romance with a married surgeon ends when his broken, unbreathing body is airlifted out by helicopter; she throws her pent-up passion into a wild affair with a soldier who happens to be her dead brother’s best friend. In the second part of the book, after the war, Frankie seems to experience every possible bad break. A drawback of the story is that none of the secondary characters in her life are fully three-dimensional: Her dismissive, chauvinistic father and tight-lipped, pill-popping mother, her fellow nurses, and her various love interests are more plot devices than people. You’ll wish you could have gone to Vegas and placed a bet on the ending—while it’s against all the odds, you’ll see it coming from a mile away.\n\nA dramatic, vividly detailed reconstruction of a little-known aspect of the Vietnam War."
