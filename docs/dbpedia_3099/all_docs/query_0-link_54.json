        "text": "TED DEKKER is a New York Times bestselling thriller author. Heralded as a \"master of suspense\" by Library Journal, Dekker has sold millions worldwide, establishing himself as one of the most widely recognized author brands.\n\nHe began his career writing fantasy novels that explored spirituality (Black, Red and White) and has since become a major force in the mainstream fiction arena with his recent thrillers, \"Adam,\" \"Thr3e,\" \"Skin,\" \"Obsessed,\" \"BoneMan's Daughters,\" which landed in the #10 on the New York Times hardcover bestseller list in 2009, and \"The Bride Collector\". Dekker has been honored with a Christy Award as well as a Gold Medallion Award for Best Fiction. \"Thr3e\" and his novel \"House\" became feature films.\n\nDekker was born to missionaries and grew up among cannibals of Indonesia, and his peculiar upbringing gives him a unique perspective outside the cultural bubble, allowing him the freedom to share provocative insights in his fiction. After leaving Indonesia, Dekker graduated from a multi-cultural high school and took up permanent residence in the United States, earning his B.A. in philosophy and religion, and then went into business.\n\nIn the early nineties, Dekker decided to pursue his desire to write fiction, selling his company, moving his family to the mountains of western Colorado, and writing full-time. Two years and three books later his first novel, a supernatural thriller called Heaven's Wager, was published. Dekker proceeded to write 6 more supernatural thrillers, rising to the top of many bestsellers lists and earning himself critical acclaim and legions of fans. \"Thr3e\" heralded his launch into mainstream fiction and was followed by \"Obsessed,\" \"Skin,\" \"Adam,\" and \"BoneMan's Daughters,\" all of which hit the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nTed Dekker's fans are comprised of readers of all ages, backgrounds, and belief systems who love his compulsively readable stories, authentic characters, and universal and relatable themes that he explores from a unique point of view."
