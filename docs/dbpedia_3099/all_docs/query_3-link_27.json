        "text": "This game is much better than I expected it to be! I have been playing it for a little over a year now and I have very few complaints. The timers on certain features are reasonable and stop you from spending your whole day playing, but donât prohibit fun. Iâm not always a fan of the story itself, but the scenes are so beautiful and the island design portion is pleasing that it really doesnât bother me. Itâs usually pretty accurate to the timeline itâs set in and if you handle your money right, you can make your island very organized and aesthetically pleasing which also allows you to progress through scenes at a consistent pace. This game provides the sort of superficial pleasure that I think everyone could benefit from during these rough, fast paced times.\n\nMy only complaint at this juncture is the inconsistent frequency of âmarvelousâ cards (seasonal items) in the five-star boxes. When I first started playing, it seemed like I got a seasonal item about every three to four boxes, but over the last few months, Iâm lucky if I get one special item in no less than 12 five-star boxes (Iâve counted this to double check if it was just in my head). This makes it nearly impossible to get the seasonal grand prizes if you donât spend the majority of your life playing the game to earn enough coins.\n\nOver all, I absolutely love this game, but this recent problem is quite frustrating.\n\nI have been playing this game for a while and I love playing. Iâve shared with friends and family how fun this game is. I like that there is a story with the hidden object scenes. Recently I started listening to the podcast as well and itâs a good addition to the game. There are options to buy diamonds, decorations, etc in the game however the developers have created it so that purchase isnât a must which is nice. I do opt to watch the ads so that I donât use as much energy per game play. The decorations are nice. At first I didnât understand the benefits from having the decorations however after playing for a little while I slowly began to understand. It has become just as much fun to decorate the island as it is to play the scenes. The one thing that is bothersome a little is the time it takes to watch the ads and for the ads to load. It takes 30 seconds for some ads to just load and that doesnât include the watch time for the ads. Sometimes the ads wonât load it will just sit and spin. I have also encountered a few times that the ads did not load and it went on for me to start playing the scene once I start the playing then the ad will pop up kicking me out of playing the scene. This causes a lose of energy which is frustrating. The only other concern I have is the occasional foul language in the story. I donât like those types of words and feel that hey are not needed because it takes away from the quality of the game. Other than that a great game.\n\nI have loved playing this game for well over a year. I have had lots of issues and shenanigans. At level 638, I was booted off....and I started over at level 1. I have erased much of this review now that I got my original game back, with the help of the Wooga staff. I have been playing now(after getting back original account) for several months. So...if you enjoy beautiful graphics, well developed characters, a good story line...this is your game. If you enjoy making 15 attempts to actually get on this game, not being able to collect the rewards you earned without going through ridiculous clueless hints...this is your game. If you can't wait to have your progress stalled for days at a time, causing your teammates to suffer in challenges you are not able to be involved in....and if your life wouldn't be complete without those creative answers from the helpful staff to solve your problem by sneaking in more roadblocks, this is your game. If you don't spend actual money on a \"free game\" be prepared to suffer the consequences of your decisions..this is your game. Oh and at least once a month, be prepared for a gluttony of shenanigans...stock holder meetings. And lastly...please Wooga, no need for your \"sorry you are having issues\" memo...you made them . Not let's see if this gets posted and who can actually see it."
