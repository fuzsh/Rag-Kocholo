        "text": "The Impossible Voyage is a special effects film depicting the life story of M. R. Štefánik. With only a slight exaggeration, we could call the film a documentary as made by Georges Méliès. It takes an unusual approach to an original narrative form, highlighted by a distinctive artistic style and animation. The film tells the story of the period of Štefánik’s life from his arrival in Paris in 1904 to the fateful date of 4 May 1919.\n\nFeature hybrid movie about an incredible life of Milan Rastislav Štefánik portrayed in a form of animated docudrama."
