And I am glad he did.\n\nYou think it has always been easy?\n\nHell no!\n\nThere have been months when I didnâ€™t have a clue what I wanted to write about.\n\nSome articles have been a collection of messy thoughts and ideas before I have managed to structure them in a logical way.\n\nWhen faced with any kind of a struggle I have considered quitting as I didnâ€™t feel I was interesting or capable enough to continueâ€¦\n\nAnd yet here I am celebrating my one year writing anniversary.\n\nNot only have I kept on writing and publishing on a monthly basis but I am also currently considering launching my own website.\n\nLast June there was no one who could possibly convince me that I needed to have my own website. Even though many people tried.\n\nI was told that LinkedIn was not the most appropriate place for a blog. However, thinking about the structure, the design, the content, the hosting and everything else that needs to be in place before you launch a website was too big of a barrier to start writing in the first place.\n\nI am sure that if I would have pursued the website idea I wouldnâ€™t have published a single article until now.\n\nWhy would LinkedIn not be the right place?\n\nWhat I write about is what I care about and if I donâ€™t share it with my network then what I am doing it for?\n\nThatâ€™s why I decided to ignore all the logical suggestions and advice from the people around me and to do what felt right to me at that moment:\n\nTrust my own intuition\n\nno matter how irrational it might seem to others.\n\nI simply opened LinkedIn, copy-pasted the text of my very first article and pressed the publish button (well, as I already told you my husband did ðŸ˜‰ )\n\nThe reason I am sharing my story with you is not because I want to brag about my success.\n\nItâ€™s not that I have a huge list of followers or fans. My articles donâ€™t go viral and, no, I donâ€™t get any offers for paid writing assignments.\n\nFor the first time in my life, reaching the final destination is not my goal.\n\nThen comes the anticipation of the first reactions. For me it is enough even if only one of you ever benefits in some way from what I have shared.\n\nFor some articles I have reached out to people who have inspired me with their words or deeds. I have asked feedback from friends and family. I have connected with complete strangers and complete strangers have contacted me after reading my stories.\n\nItâ€™s been a hell of a journey and the best part of it is that I have no idea where this journey will take me to."
