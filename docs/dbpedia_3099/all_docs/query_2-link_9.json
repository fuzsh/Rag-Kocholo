        "text": "The Impossible Voyage (Voyage à travers l'impossible) is a 1904 silent film by pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès. The film's runtime is about 20 minutes (nearly five times the length of the average film of that era) and was probably inspired by Melies' successful earlier film; A Trip to the Moon. It is loosely based on Jules Verne's play, Voyage à travers l'impossible. Like most of Méliès' films at this time, it makes use of narrative, models and trick photography.\n\nPlot[]\n\nUsing every known means of transportation, several savants from the Geographic Society undertake a journey through the Alps to the Sun, which finishes under the sea.\n\nSteampunk elements[]\n\nThis section of the article is a stub.
