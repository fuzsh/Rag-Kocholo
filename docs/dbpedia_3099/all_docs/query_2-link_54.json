        "text": "Many children’s authors create animal and plant characters who talk and think like humans. But if the author’s understanding of other species is superficial, the characters’ nonhuman features become little more than a means to deliver jokes. The authors of “The Eyes & the Impossible” and “Big Tree” have avoided this pitfall and created characters who, although they speak with a human tongue, embody the strange magic of other beings.\n\nIn the foreword to THE EYES & THE IMPOSSIBLE (256 pp.; McSweeney’s wood-bound hardcover, $28; Knopf cloth, $18.99; ages 8 and up), Dave Eggers says of his characters, “No animals are real animals. And, most crucially, no animals symbolize people.” While Eggers’s animals use human language with great facility, he bestows on them the essence of their animal natures. They made me think of the eccentric way 7-year-olds construct theories and make decisions based on their own limited experience of the world around them.\n\nThe experience of Eggers’s animals is limited to a small island park patrolled by human rangers and regularly awash with visitors. His warm, comedic tale of interspecies friendship and the plotting of an “impossible” escape for three venerable Bison who live in a “large fenced-in park within the park” is told by Johannes, a dog. He is “the Eyes” of the park and reports to the Bison, who keep “the Equilibrium”: “When there was a new road cutting through the forest … I told the Bison and they decided where and when the raccoons needed to relocate.”"
