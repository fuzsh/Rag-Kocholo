        "text": "So many people fall into the camp of banking their dreams, their goals, and their ambitions, waiting for the perfect time, perfect moment, perfect conditions. But guess what? The perfect time never comes. The perfect conditions never exist. There will always be challenges, obstacles, and reasons why not to do something.\n\nIf you keep waiting for perfect conditions, your dreams may never become your reality. When you think about your passion and goals but fail to turn them into reality, you fall behind. Your dreams stay where they are, as dreams, but time, amongst many other things, continues to move forward\n\nMy challenge for you is to recognise that 2020 is your year to make things happen. If you feel deep down that you are not living the best version of you, or you’re not chasing your dreams, or you’re not living an authentic life, then it comes down to this. Have you set your goals? And more importantly, are you taking steps towards achieving them?\n\nTo achieve your goals, whatever they may be, may mean that the very first step is a step out of your comfort zone. You’ve got to push the edge of your boundaries to make your dreams happen.\n\nLet me share with you a short story about mother eagle and her baby chicks.\n\n‘Come to the edge,’ said the mother eagle.\n\n‘We might fall,’ said the chicks.\n\n‘Come to the edge,’ repeated the mother eagle.\n\n‘It’s too high!’ the baby chicks wailed.\n\n‘COME TO THE EDGE!’ the mother eagle repeated.\n\nAnd they came.\n\nAnd she pushed.\n\nAnd they flew.\n\nThere is so much potential inside each of us that sometimes to realise it, we need to push beyond our current boundaries. We need to go to the edge and jump. Believe me, when you set your sights on your goals, you will fly.\n\nThe opportunities are all around, but sometimes we are just too safe in our comfort zone to see them as opportunities. We see them as obstacles, but obstacles are blockers that you come across when you take your mind off your goals.\n\nYes, you have to take action. Yes, you will need to be courageous and brave, and yes, usually the first step will be the hardest. But when you commit to taking action, you will figure out the next step and the next.\n\nI’m a firm believer that in life, you can set your goals and keep setting them, but at some point, you need to walk to the edge and jump. To live your best life, you need to make your goals a reality. Don’t focus on all the reasons why you cannot take the next step; focus on all the reasons why you should.\n\nThe most important question to ask yourself is this: Do I believe in myself? And if you answer, yes, then go out there and make it happen.\n\nEd Sheeran, before he became the global superstar that he is today was a busk artist in London, playing his music. He had nowhere to live as he couldn’t afford a flat or a house on his own. So he stayed with friends, sleeping on their couches. One day one of his friends asked him why he didn’t just get a proper job, and his answer is very profound: “I would never go and get what people call a proper job because I had to know there’s only one pathway to realise my goals and ambitions, and that was to make it in the music industry. If I went to get a proper job as people call it, I would have suppressed my desire, my hunger to be me.’\n\nThe overwhelming number of real success stories in life have been achieved by people who have been diligent and thoughtful about setting goals and following and measuring the steps they take toward their achievement.\n\nYou and you alone control the substance and the quality of the thoughts and actions you pack into every day, week, month and year. As a result, you not only have the ability to set goals; you can make them come true.\n\nTo help you set and achieve your 2020 goals, read my complete guide to goal setting in 2020 and download my goal setting tracker here."
