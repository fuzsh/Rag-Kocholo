Once more, as I do many times a year, I got in my EV with my wife and travelled from my home in Madrid, in the center of Spain, to my parent’s place in the northwestern port city of A Coruña; about six hundred kilometers each way.\n\nOn both journeys, I left the house in the morning, later than I would have liked, but I wanted to write my daily post first. About half way, we stopped for lunch at one of the growing number of service stations with superchargers. As ever, the car was charged before we’d finished eating; 25 minutes. No drama, no pain, no issues.\n\nWhy do I point that out? Because I constantly meet people who believe such trips are impossible, or that I’m making this stuff up. Those recharges “have to take a lot longer” (some ill-informed souls even talk about “several hours”), they insist; it’s hard to find chargers, and when you do there’s an endless queue, something that has never happened to me in the more than four years that I have owed an EV. And of course, I’ll be fretting the whole trip, fearing that at any moment I’m going to be left stranded, which has never happened to me either; not even close. And the few people it has happened to ignored the car’s warning technology.\n\nWhy so many myths and lies about EVs? What leads so many people to ignore the evidence…"
