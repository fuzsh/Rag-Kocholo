        "text": "December 16, 2014\n\nI found this play very disappointing. Of course, I would have been looking in the wrong place had I expected anything more from it than an easy-flowing adventure story, but I think that before reading this play I had underestimated just how much rubbish could such a story be.\n\nThe characters in the play could be called one-dimensional only with some effort. That perhaps is also not surprising, given that the gist of the play is its plot, but even the plot I found unsatisfactory. One of the reasons for that is that the storyline is not only disingenuous to the extreme, but also irritating in its moral implications if one cares to make them, but it's hard to not care because they are so obviously questionable:\n\nHere is George Hatteras, grandson of a famous explorer whose heritage is kept secret from him, lest he be tempted to follow in his grandfather's steps and become an explorer himself. There is Eva, his fiancée, a 'good' character who would do anything to stop George from going on a journey and once he is on, to try to persuade him to go back. There we have the 'bad' doctor Ox, who wants to send George on a journey in order to separate him from Eva with whom Ox is in love, so in the entirety of his evil wickedness the doctor gives the characters a magic potion, and ta-da, they all find themselves on a journey through the impossible. The trio is accompanied by two clown-characters making unsuccessful attempts to be funny throughout the play, and Volsius, a 'good' version of Ox if you wish, seeming able to unproblematically make magic happen, who is there to help Eva to get George back from the journey. And there we all go, a romp through various scenes in three 'impossible' worlds which Ox reveals to George in the hope of making him go insane, whilst Eva and Volsious are unsuccessfully trying to talk him back while making sure on the side that he doesn't accidentally kill himself or who knows what. And this all lasts, until when it's time for the play to finish, and so Eva in a venturous spirit summons up the brilliance to reveal to Ox that if he lets anything bad happen to George, she will hate him, and so that complete freak of a bastard, the doctor, crushed under the enormous power of love, no longer tempts George to keep journeying and, suddenly, without any explanation offered, we are all back in the room where the play started, the happy ending being that George, now 'sane', promises Eva that he will no longer attempt any journeys, that he only wants to love her.\n\nI couldn't hear my comment over the sound of facepalms, so no further comment I believe here necessary, except the one that perhaps the ending of the play is indeed happy, for Eva didn't deserve the doctor who was too good for a woman who wants her pet-husband to never show his nose out of the house, passing this as 'love' on top of that, while she would make a good couple with a man who is apparently nothing like his grandfather and so incompetent he cannot handle both the adventure and the girl at the same time, and anyway he needs just too much help to survive and forgets his passion the minute a third person stops tempting him. In short: that was a close escape, Ox, next time choose some people who like to actually think. Anyhow.\n\nAnother reason I didn't like the play beside the storyline is that the rest of it, the 'filler' - although perhaps the storyline is the real filler here - is also quite boring with not a single scene that struck me as original, nor a line as memorable. Here we have 3 acts, the first taking place in the Earth's core, the second on the ocean-bottom, the third on the planet Altor, each of which a charming excuse for yet another magnificent set, another ballet performed by scantily-clad girls, and in general lots of shine and colour on stage, and music. Indeed it is easy for us today to forget that performance was the biggest thing in entertainment back in the days and the only place people could see such a spectacle of colour, noise, movement, - art, - on a large scale; yet I don't think that the fact that the story takes place in incredible locations is itself a sufficient excuse for the general shallowness of the entire play.\n\nIn this vein, I liked the fact that the edition included two reviews of the play performed in 1882, and I will conclude my review by quoting the end of the review by the Paris correspondent for the New York Times:\n\n'And now, if you wish, an opinion of the merits of the \"Journey Through the Impossible,\" I will say frankly that I have never seen anything more idiotically incoherent, or of which the dialogue is more pretentious. Under another name it is only a re-edition of \"Pilules du Diable,\" the \"Biche au Bois,\" the \"Mille et Une Nuits,\" which again are only speaking versions of the old-fashioned pantomimes. George is Harlequin, Heva Columbine, Volsius the Good Genius, Valdemar a good-natured Clown, and Doctor Ox the Wicked Enchanter. These adventures and mishaps have been seen a hundred times before, and if the people did not talk they would be all the better liked. Yet, for all that, the piece is successful - an immense success and a success which will last for months, as panoramas nowadays are all the fashion. M. Paul Cleves has given proof of taste and of unrivaled prodigality, and I should not be surprised if the \"Voyage a Travers l'Impossible\" equaled in vogue the famous \"Tour du Monde.\" Still, I think that it will prove to be M. Verne's \"Song of the Swan\"; That this will be the last trial of scientifico-fantastico-geographical dramas.'\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers."
