        "text": "What works: protect your mental health and prevent problems\n\nProtecting our mental health is easier than you might think. We can all do it every day, and with simple activities that help us feel OK, we’re better able to cope with life.\n\nIt’s a bit like brushing your teeth daily – important in preventing problems. It’s the same for our mental health. It can also be fun!\n\nEach of our tips has been created to help us look after our mental health, and, importantly, each is backed up by evidence from research, including the Mental Health Foundation’s ground-breaking study.\n\nOur tips will be easier for some and harder for others. Why not give them a try and see which ones suit you best?\n\nTrying new things can sometimes feel uncomfortable, but they usually get easier the more we practise them.\n\nOne thing to remember: none of us is perfect. We all have our limits. What’s good enough for you is great.\n\nFeeling very upset can interfere with our lives, making it hard to think clearly or work, relax, study, sleep or deal with other people.\n\nMany of us will know when we’re upset but not be sure what we’re feeling. Is it sadness, fear, shame, loneliness, anger or something else? We don’t always know why we’re feeling that way.\n\nIt often helps to give our feelings our attention without judging them, without telling ourselves we’re stupid or weak to feel the way we do. It may seem strange and uncomfortable to do this. But practice and patience with ourselves will help.\n\nNaming what we’re feeling is also likely to help. So, we can say to ourselves: “I’m feeling really irritable today but also sad.” Another helpful step can be to work out what has led to us feeling this way – might it be a disagreement or disappointment that you’ve had? Some women might find that their periods sometimes (or always) affect their moods.\n\nTalking kindly to ourselves, in the same way, we might reassure a small child we care about, is also important. It can be very comforting. You might feel uncomfortable initially, but give it a go – it might just help.\n\nSome people feel better if they write down their feelings in a notebook or on their phone. You might want to think about how to protect your privacy before doing this.\n\nYou could try repeating something positive about yourself a few times each day. (This is sometimes called a “mantra”. “I am on a journey, growing and developing”, for example.) Research shows this reduces negative thoughts and feelings.\n\nSome people also feel that an activity called “mindfulness” is helpful. Talking with someone else can also be helpful – and that’s our next suggestion…\n\nMany of us have learned to bottle things up inside us and try to ignore painful feelings. It can take a lot of courage to tell someone else how we’re feeling or what we’re finding hard, especially if we don’t usually do that kind of thing.\n\nJust talking things through with a person we trust can help and feel like a relief.\n\nUse your own words. It’ll make you feel safer and less alone, and that will help protect your mental health and prevent problems.\n\nTalking may also change how you see and feel about the situation in ways you find helpful.\n\nAnother possible benefit is that talking may strengthen your relationship with the person you speak with. This will benefit both of you and make it easier for them to turn to you when they need support themselves.\n\nInformation about talking with friends about your mental health\n\nInformation about talking with a health professional about how you’re feeling\n\nMany of us sometimes use drugs to block out “difficult” feelings such as sadness, fear or shame.\n\nNo one wants to feel bad; for some people, drugs and/or alcohol offer temporary relief.\n\nUnfortunately, they don’t stop the feelings from returning and may make things worse or create other problems, including damage to mental and physical health, relationships, work, or study.\n\nIf you think you may be using drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, it may help to notice it without beating yourself up about it. Being understanding and kind to yourself is good for your mental health.\n\nA possible next step could be to talk with someone you trust or one of the charities that offer confidential, free information and advice, including how to reduce the harmfulness of using drugs. Have a look at Talk To Frank, for example.\n\nYou could also look for other ways of coping with painful feelings, such as getting help with the situation causing them, if possible, and finding a trusted person to talk with. This could be a friend or relative, a colleague, a person working for a charity helpline, your GP or a counsellor.\n\nMany charities around the country offer low-cost or free therapy. Find more detailed information about getting help with your mental health from many potential sources.\n\nSome people find it helps to go to “anonymous” meetings, such as Narcotics Anonymous, to share with others who have/had similar experiences. Some of these meetings are also now online.\n\nMoney problems can be unavoidable, and we may have no choice about being in debt.\n\nFears about paying debts, bills and essentials such as food and electricity can be very stressful. If we feel responsible for sending money back home or are the only earner in our household, we may feel burdened and isolated.\n\nFeelings like this can make it harder to cope with everything, including the money problems themselves.\n\nThere are things we can do to help prevent financial problems causing issues with our mental health.\n\nWe might feel ashamed of what we’re going through, which may make it harder to tell anyone, leaving us feeling alone with it.\n\nThe truth is, we’re never alone with money problems. Research shows they are one of the most common and serious sources of stress for many people.\n\nEven if our finances are impossible to change, sharing our fears with another person who’s not involved and who you trust is likely to help us feel less alone and overwhelmed. This may help us to see new ways forward.\n\nIf we are struggling financially, including with debt, it can be helpful to talk about it with an expert at a charity that offers free money advice. They are very experienced with what can go wrong with people’s finances and what may help.\n\nIt can be really helpful to ask for help before any debt becomes unmanageable. But getting help will benefit everyone.\n\nHere is a list of organisations that offer free advice about financial problems, created by the charity Money and Mental Health.\n\nTalking with one of these free, expert advisers could also lead to you finding out about new possibilities, such as benefits you’re entitled to, your legal rights, ways to reduce the size of your debt repayments and other ways to save money."
