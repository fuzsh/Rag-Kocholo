Don&#39;t reset! Touch it now!)\r\n\r\nRule the sky! Rule the sea! Even the gods cannot rule me!\r\nWhat would I say? How to relay? How are we supposed to live this way?\r\nWhat the fuck am I supposed to do?\r\n\r\nTo know the truth is a burden that could break your bones and bury you\r\nTo know the truth.\r\n\r\nI had my first piece of black berry pie today, and I said my life aint never be the same,\r\nI said my life aint never gonna be the same",
