        "text": "In 2016, South Korea saw the start of a massive corruption scandal involving its political and business elite that brought down its first female president Park Geun-hye.\n\nThe scandal, which continues to ripple through South Korean society, generated huge protests.\n\nIt has centred on Park's relationship with an old friend, Choi Soon-sil, and has brought to the surface allegations of cult activities, influence-peddling and leaks of classified information.\n\nShe got to know Choi Tae-min, a pseudo-Christian cult leader dubbed \"the Korean Rasputin\".\n\nHe became a close family friend and Park's mentor, while also amassing considerable wealth and power.\n\nPark's father was assassinated in 1979. By this point she was firm friends with Mr Choi's daughter, Choi Soon-sil, who later became her adviser when Park became president.\n\nIn February 2018, Choi was sentenced to 20 years in jail for corruption, influence-peddling and abuse of power. She was earlier found guilty of using her position to solicit favours for her daughter.\n\nChoi was found to have had used her presidential connections to pressure conglomerates - including electronics giant Samsung - for millions of dollars in donations to two non-profit foundations she controlled.\n\nPark meanwhile has been accused of colluding with Choi, and giving her unauthorised access to state documents.\n\nMs Park was officially ousted in March 2017, following parliament's decision to impeach her in December. She was the country's first democratically-elected president to be forced from office.\n\nAfter losing her presidential immunity, she was charged with bribery, abusing state power and leaking state secrets.\n\nThey had earlier apologised, but it was unclear exactly what they were apologising for.\n\nChoi said she had committed an \"unpardonable crime\", though her lawyer said this was not a legal admission of guilt.\n\nPark admitted she had committed lapses, and apologised to the public for causing \"national concern\".\n\nThe firm was one of eight that has admitted making payments to the foundation, but denied it did so in return for any favours.\n\nIn August 2017, Samsung's de facto head, Lee Jae-yong, was jailed for five years for bribery and embezzlement. He was later freed in February after an appeals court reduced and suspended his sentence.\n\nLee was convicted over payments of 43bn won ($36.4m; Â£30.3m) made to Choi's foundations, as well as for giving a horse and several million dollars to assist the equestrian career of Choi's daughter.\n\nProsecutors had accused Lee of approving these payments and gifts in order to win government support for a major restructuring of Samsung.\n\nThe 2015 merger of two Samsung units, which paved the way for Lee to become the eventual head of South Korea's largest conglomerate, sparked controversy at that time.\n\nWhile Lee did not dispute that the payments were made, he maintained during his trial that he was not involved in the decisions and denied that he sought government favours.\n\nLee was also found guilty of hiding assets overseas, concealing criminal proceeds, and perjury.\n\nWho is Samsung's Lee Jae-yong?\n\nSince it began the whole affair prompted numerous mass protests in South Korea, many of which called for Park to step down.\n\nIt fuelled discontent against the government, the political elite and family-run conglomerates which dominate South Korea's economy.\n\nIt also propelled the liberal Moon Jae-in, who campaigned on a platform of a clean government, into power after Park.\n\nThough Choi and Lee have been convicted, much of the attention has still been focused on Park.\n\nFor many South Koreans, the former president who has been at the centre of one of the country's biggest scandals still has a lot to answer for."
