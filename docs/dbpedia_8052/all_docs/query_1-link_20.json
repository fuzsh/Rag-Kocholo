        "meta_description": "Park Geun-hye is the daughter of South Korea's former dictator, the late president Park Chung-hee. On December 19, 2012, Park - a Conservative - narrowly won the election to make history as South Korea's first female president. Born on February 2, 1952, she was the chairwoman of the conservative Grand National Party (GNP) between 2004 and 2006 and between 2011 and 2012 (the GNP changed its name to Saenuri Party in February 2012). Park has already served as South Korea's first lady, after her mother was killed in the 1970s.",

        "text": "The ruling could ease the legal troubles surrounding the Samsung heir, less than two years after he was pardoned of a separate conviction of bribery in a corruption scandal that helped topple a previous South Korean government.\n\nYoon Suk-yeol, opposition candidate, criticises An Chi-hwan’s track for ‘crossing certain lines’; some say song is about Yoon’s wife Kim Keon-hee but singer says it’s about mastermind behind disgraced former President Park Geun-hye.\n\nSouth Korean film student Oh Se-yeon talks to the Post about her documentary Fanatic, a film festival hit that examines what happens to fans when they see their K-pop idols accused of crimes.\n\nThe ruling means Park, who was ousted from office and arrested in 2017, potentially serves a combined 22 years behind bars\n\nThe neighbours’ differences over wartime labour compensation are deep, and they are unlikely to fundamentally resolve the issue, observers say.\n\nMany Chinese millennials are obsessed by Korean boy and girl bands but K-pop has been turned into a political hot potato by Beijing.\n\nProsecutors said Lee committed breach of trust and other offences when two Samsung units merged in 2015, which gave him greater control of the group.\n\nThe all-male group – including professors, schoolteachers and two Buddhist monks – gathered on Friday after Lee invoked a rarely used option to review legal cases.\n\nIt’s not just the coronavirus and the Shincheonji Church. Cults have been linked to a host of Korean scandals, from the Sewol ferry disaster to a president’s impeachment.\n\nThe Supreme Court ordered the retrial of Lee, who was convicted for bribery in a case that helped bring down former president Park Geun-hye. The decision comes as Samsung faces headwinds caused by global trade disputes.\n\nSamsung Group heir Lee Jae-yong faces a return to jail if the Supreme Court rules against him in a high-profile corruption case, potentially dealing a further blow to the group which is already suffering as a result of export curbs by Japan and the US-China trade war.\n\nThe 2016 marches against then president Park Geun-hye sparked attempts to paint protesters as North Korean supporters. Hongkongers opposed to the extradition bill must resist attempts to divide them, whatever their political differences.\n\nMore than 20,000 Koreans sign a petition urging action from President Moon Jae-in as many remember their own history of protest.\n\nThe predictions, delivered to the disgraced former president by police, covered a range of topics from diplomacy and national security to the economy and the president’s personal luck.\n\nThe family-run conglomerates that power South Korea’s economy have long been above listening to individual shareholders – or ants. But as the scandals mount, and take down presidents, those ants are fighting back."
