        "text": "In an historic ruling, South Korea's Constitutional Court has formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil, worsened an already-serious national divide and led to calls for sweeping reforms.\n\nIt was a stunning fall for Ms Park, the daughter of a dictator who rode a lingering conservative nostalgia for her father to a big win in 2012, only to see her presidency descend into scandal.\n\nThe unanimous ruling opens her up to possible criminal proceedings, and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed early from office since democracy in the country in the late 1980s.\n\nThe court's acting chief judge, Lee Jung-mi, said Ms Park had violated the constitution and law \"throughout her term\", and despite the objections of parliament and the press, she had concealed the truth and cracked down on critics.\n\n\"The removal of the claimee from office is overwhelmingly to the benefit of the protection of the constitution ... We remove President Park Geun-hye from office,\" Ms Lee told the hearing.\n\nMs Park denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSouth Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Ms Park's successor.\n\nLiberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Ms Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys.\n\nWhoever becomes the next leader will take over a country facing a hostile North Korea, a stagnant economy and deep social and political divides.\n\nPre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans had wanted the court to approve Ms Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that her ouster would further polarise the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents.\n\nMs Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation.\n\nOverwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Ms Park supporters were largely ignored. But they recently regrouped and have staged fierce pro-Park rallies since.\n\nPeople on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with.\n\nOne of Ms Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Ms Park is booted from office.\n\nMany participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected her impeachment.\n\n\"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University.\n\n\"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\"\n\nOthers disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public.\n\nProtests after verdict\n\nHundreds of demonstrators, both for and against Ms Park, gathered outside the court, which was blockaded by police buses.\n\nAfter the verdict, Ms Park's supporters and police scuffled at a demonstration outside the court — where two people died.\n\nPolice said one 72-year-old man was taken to hospital with a head injury and died, while the he circumstances of the second death were being investigated. Six people were injured, protest organisers said.\n\nElsewhere in the city, people welcomed her ouster.\n\nThe main thoroughfare running through downtown Seoul was blockaded after the court's decision in anticipation of growing protests later in the day.\n\nProsecutors named Ms Park, who now loses her presidential immunity from prosecution, as an accomplice in two court cases linked to the scandal, suggesting she is likely to be investigated and could face legal proceedings.\n\nMs Park, 65, was been accused of colluding with her friend, Choi and a former presidential aide, both of whom have been on trial, to pressure big businesses to donate to two foundations set up to back her policy initiatives.\n\nThe court said Ms Park had \"completely hidden the fact of [Choi's] interference with state affairs\".\n\nMs Park was also accused of soliciting bribes from the head of the Samsung Group for government favours, including backing a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that was seen as supporting the succession of control over the country's largest \"chaebol\" — or family owned — conglomerate.\n\nSamsung Group leader Jay Y Lee has been accused of bribery and embezzlement in connection with the scandal and is in detention — his trial began on Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn was appointed acting president and will remain in that post until the election.\n\nIf Hwang resigns, as some media have speculated he may to run for president, the finance minister will take over as acting president."
