        "text": "South Korea's top court has upheld a 20-year jail term for former President Park Geun-hye over a vast corruption scandal that led to her downfall.\n\nThe ruling on Thursday upheld the reduced term given to Park in July on appeal after she was originally sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors had tried to appeal against that reduction.\n\nPark was convicted of abuse of power and coercion after she was impeached in 2017.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday also upheld her fine of 18bn won (Â£12m, $17m).\n\nThe former president was her country's first democratically-elected leader to be forced from office in a fallout that also landed two conglomerate heads in prison.\n\nPark, 68, was initially sentenced to a total of 30 years in jail and fined 20bn won, but a high court later reduced the fine and the term to 15 years for corruption with another five for abuse of power.\n\nThursday's ruling is the final verdict in the case, the culmination of a scandal that had fuelled widespread rage against political and business elites.\n\nWhat was she convicted of?\n\nIn 2018 Park was found guilty of 16 out of 18 charges, most of which related to bribery and coercion.\n\nThe court ruled that she had colluded with her close friend, Choi Soon-sil, to pressure conglomerates such as electronics giant Samsung and retail chain Lotte to give millions of dollars to foundations run by Choi.\n\nShe was also convicted of forcing companies to sign lucrative deals with firms owned by Choi and donate gifts to Choi and her daughter.\n\nIn addition, Park was found guilty of leaking confidential presidential documents to her long-time friend.\n\nThe ex-leader has always denied wrongdoing and refused to take part in any of the court proceedings.\n\nWhat led to her downfall?\n\nPark's close childhood friendship with Choi lay at the heart of her undoing.\n\nThe woman swiftly became the leader's most trusted confidante.\n\nBut their relationship came under intense public scrutiny and Choi was deemed to have had undue influence over the nation's affairs through her connection with Park.\n\nAfter a prolonged series of hearings and months of huge street protests calling for her resignation, Park was finally removed from office in March 2017 and arrested shortly afterwards.\n\nChoi was eventually found guilty of corruption, and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2018.\n\nWho else was caught up in this?\n\nSome of South Korea's biggest companies and their leaders were drawn into the scandal, as well as numerous figures from the entertainment world and government servants.\n\nSamsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y Lee, was singled out in particular after details emerged that he had given a horse to Choi's daughter Chung Yoo-ra, who is an equestrian.\n\nHe was sentenced to jail, but only served five months before he was freed, when an appeals court reduced and suspended his sentence.\n\nMs Chung has also faced scrutiny, and was extradited from Denmark to South Korea in 2017 to face questioning.\n\nIs this unusual in South Korea?\n\nPark, the daughter of a former military dictator, is not the only ex-president to have been arrested for corruption.\n\nIn 2018, former leader Lee Myung-bak was charged with corruption over allegations he took bribes while in office.\n\nTwo others, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, were convicted for treason and corruption in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2009, former president Roh Moo-hyun killed himself while he was under investigation for corruption.\n\nWhat next for Park?\n\nThe country's first female leader now faces a total of 22 years behind bars - as she was separately sentenced to two years in prison for election law violations.\n\nBut the end of the legal process in her graft case also paves the way for a potential pardon as called for by her still vocal supporters.\n\nYet Park remains a divisive figure."
