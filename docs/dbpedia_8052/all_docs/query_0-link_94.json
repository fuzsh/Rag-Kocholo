        "text": "As the first female President of the Republic of Korea, Madame Park Geun-hye is an inspiration for all women trying to break through the glass ceiling and for all individuals committed to serving the people.\n\nI first met President Park at her inauguration and was privileged to be the first foreign leader to be received by her. Her peerless political parentage, being the daughter of a former President, is reflected in the vast experience she brings to politics and international affairs and in her vision to create a “second miracle on the Han River” to improve the well-being of her people.\n\nFemale leaders are often tested in ways that men are not. President Park has what it takes to usher in an era of hope and happiness for the Korean people and to contribute to the stability and dynamism of the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region, benefiting her country as well as East Asia and the ASEAN community.\n\nYingluck is the Prime Minister of Thailand"
