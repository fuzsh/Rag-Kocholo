        "text": "President Obama will welcome President Park Geun-hye of the Republic of Korea to the White House on October 16. President Park’s visit, her second to Washington since taking office, will underscore the strength and breadth of the U.S.-Republic of Korea partnership and demonstrate the close personal ties between the American and Korean people.\n\nPresident Obama and President Park will exchange views on a broad range of security, economic, and global issues, including the U.S.-ROK alliance and the critical role it plays in assuring regional stability and security. They will chart the expansion of our cooperation into new areas that will increasingly shape the relationship in the 21st century, such as environment, energy, space, health, and cybersecurity. They will also discuss the current security situation on the Korean Peninsula in the face of the continued threat from North Korea. President Park’s visit is rescheduled from June."
