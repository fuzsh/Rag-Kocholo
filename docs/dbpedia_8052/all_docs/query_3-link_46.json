        "text": "South Korea's former President Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in prison Friday after she was found guilty of corruption -- a scandal that exposed close ties and collusion between the government and the country's biggest corporations.\n\nThe 66-year old, who was dramatically impeached last year, was convicted on 16 charges involving bribery, coercion and abuse of power, at a hearing broadcast live on television. She was also fined $17 million. Prosecutors had demanded a 30-year sentence.\n\nPark was not present in court to hear the verdict, having chosen to boycott the hearings since last year. She had denied any wrongdoing and claimed there was a conspiracy against her.\n\nCash for favors\n\nPark, South Korea's first female president, was accused of being part of an elaborate cash-for-favors scheme with longtime friend and informal adviser, Choi Soon-sil. Prosecutors say Park abused her position by helping Choi seek donations from major Korean companies -- including Samsung -- for foundations she set up.\n\n\"The defendant abused the presidential authority delegated from the people of this country and it resulted in a large amount of chaos in terms of public order and state management,\" Judge Kim Se-yun told the court, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.\n\n\"The responsibility lies with the defendant who has abandoned her constitutional duties.\"\n\nChoi herself was given a 20-year jail term earlier this year after being convicted of corruption, influence-peddling and abuse of power.\n\nSamsung chief Lee Jae-yong was also implicated in the case and jailed for bribery last year, but in February a higher court reduced his five-year sentence and suspended it for four years.\n\nThe case put the relationship between the government and South Korea's largest family-owned conglomerates, known as \"chaebols,\" under the microscope, and brought hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets of Seoul demanding Park's ouster, as a tide of popular anger against the perceived unfair influence of the chaebols swept the country.\n\nPark, the eldest daughter of former President Park Chung-hee who was assassinated in 1979, came to power in 2012 after defeating Moon Jae-in, the current president.\n\nShe is expected to appeal Friday's verdict."
