        "text": "SEOUL, South Korea — A police detective who worked in the South Korean president’s office filed a report in 2014 accusing relatives and associates of an unofficial presidential adviser of meddling in state affairs.\n\nHe was promptly reassigned.\n\nThat was just the start of his troubles. After a newspaper reported some of his findings, the detective, Park Kwan-cheon, who worked as an anti-graft watchdog, was charged with leaking government documents. President Park Geun-hye, who is not related to Mr. Park, accused him of “undermining national discipline.” He was convicted and spent 16 months in prison.\n\nTo opponents of the president, the case confirms that she is just like her father, the military dictator Park Chung-hee: an isolated, authoritarian leader who uses state power against critics while shielded by a small coterie of advisers.\n\nMr. Park is not the only official who paid for raising alarms about the adviser, Choi Soon-sil, a longtime friend of the president who is at the center of the scandal crippling her administration. Other officials were demoted or forced to resign. At least two people, including a journalist, were prosecuted for spreading rumors that Ms. Park had a relationship with Ms. Choi’s ex-husband.\n\nAs the scandal grows, even many older South Koreans who revere Ms. Park’s father — and who were crucial to her election victory in 2012 — have turned against her. Her approval numbers have dropped to record lows, and crowds of protesters have called on her to resign. A large demonstration in Seoul was expected on Saturday.\n\n“In the end, she turned out to be a dunderhead who couldn’t even separate public affairs from private friendships,” said Kim Ky-baek, 64, who runs a nationalist website, Minjokcorea. “What so disappointed conservatives like me is that she tainted her father’s name, rather than honoring it.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
