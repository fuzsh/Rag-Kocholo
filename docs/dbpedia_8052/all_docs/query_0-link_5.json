        "text": "SEOUL, South Korea — The government of President Moon Jae-in said on Friday that it would pardon former President Park Geun-hye, who is serving a 20-year prison term after she was convicted on bribery and other criminal charges.\n\nMs. Park, 69, who became the first democratically elected South Korean leader to be removed from office through parliamentary impeachment, will be freed on Dec. 31 to promote “reconciliation and consolidate national power to help overcome the national crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the Justice Ministry said in a statement.\n\nShe has served four years and nine months of her sentence so far. Concerns about her health were raised after she was taken to a hospital in Seoul, the capital, for various illnesses last month.\n\nWhether Ms. Park deserved a pardon has become a divisive political issue ahead of the presidential election in March. The office of Mr. Moon, who by law cannot run for re-election, had sounded noncommittal until now when reporters asked about the prospects of releasing Ms. Park.\n\nMr. Moon said that Ms. Park’s declining heath had also been a factor in his government’s decision to release her.\n\n“It’s time for us to put our resources together and stride toward the future,” he said in a statement, calling for national unity to help overcome “the numerous difficulties facing the nation.” He added, “I hope this amnesty will help overcome differences in opinion and open a new era of consolidation and harmony.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
