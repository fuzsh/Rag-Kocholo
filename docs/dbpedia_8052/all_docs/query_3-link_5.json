        "text": "In just four years South Korea's president Park Geun-went from being a trailblazer to a figure of controversy linked to a deepening corruption scandal.\n\nAn angered Korean public called for her resignation and she was officially impeached in March 2017.\n\nHer unpopularity stands in stark contrast to the start of her term in 2012. In a tight presidential race, she beat Moon Jae-in to became the country's first female leader.\n\nIt was a notable achievement given that South Korea had the highest level of gender inequality in the developed world.\n\nWhen her mother was murdered by a North Korean gunman in 1974, Park served as first lady at the age of 22. Five years later, her father was assassinated.\n\nSome said the association with her father - and her experience as first lady - helped cement her win by overcoming prejudices among male voters.\n\nBut Park's personal history fell under public scrutiny again with the scandal surrounding Choi Soon-sil, her longtime confidante.\n\nThe two women's relationship stretches back to the 1970s when Choi's father, the shadowy quasi-religious figure Choi Tae-min, befriended the Park family.\n\nBut in 2016, allegations began emerging that Choi Soon-sil was being given inappropriate access to government decision-making, including editing some of Park's speeches.\n\nChoi was later accused of using her friendship to pressure some of South Korea's biggest companies into paying money into non-profit foundations she ran, in exchange for securing favourable treatment from the government.\n\nChoi was eventually found guilty of corruption and influence-peddling, as was the de facto head of Samsung, one of the companies allegedly involved.\n\nPark, who is accused of colluding with her friend, was impeached by parliament in December 2016. She was officially ousted in March 2017 when the decision was upheld in the supreme court, and was arrested on corruption charges.\n\nEveryone involved has apologised but consistently denied wrongdoing."
