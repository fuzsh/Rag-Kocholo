        "text": "(born 1952). The first female president of South Korea was Park Geun-Hye, who held office from 2013 to 2017. She was leader of the conservative Saenuri (“New Frontier”) Party.\n\nPark was born on February 2, 1952, in Taegu (Daegu), South Korea. As a young girl, she moved with her family to Seoul. Her father, Park Chung-Hee, became president of South Korea in 1963. Park Geun-Hye thus grew up in the South Korean presidential palace. She graduated from Sogang University (South Korea) in 1974 with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering.\n\nIn 1974 an agent of North Korea tried to assassinate Park Chung-Hee. The attempt failed, but Park Geun-Hye’s mother was killed. Park Geun-Hye became South Korea’s first lady. Five years later, her father was killed by the head of South Korea’s central intelligence agency. After her father’s death, Park Geun-Hye continued to be active in public life by leading educational and cultural foundations.\n\nIn 1998 Park was elected to the National Assembly as a candidate of the conservative Grand National Party. She was reelected for four more terms, serving from 1998 until 2012. Park twice served as chair of her party between 2004 and 2006. Under her leadership, the party won important electoral gains against difficult odds in the 2004 general elections. This success earned Park the nickname “Queen of Elections” in the media. Her career suffered a setback in 2007 when she lost the party’s presidential nomination to Lee Myung-Bak. In 2011, however, Park headed a committee that transformed the Grand National Party into the Saenuri Party. This effectively made her the party leader again.\n\nPublic opinion on Park was affected by opinions about her father’s rule; his legacy continued to divide South Koreans decades after his death. Many people despised him as a brutal dictator. Others celebrated him as the architect of the South Korean “economic miracle” that had followed decades of poverty. When Park Geun-Hye ran for president in 2012, she invoked her father’s slogan of “Let’s live well.” She promised to bring back the high rate of economic growth that South Korea had experienced under his leadership. Park also apologized to those who had suffered under her father’s regime.\n\nPark’s main rival for the presidency was Moon Jae-In, a center-left candidate. He had been imprisoned in the 1970s for having protested against the rule of Park’s father. On December 19, 2012, Park defeated Moon with a small majority of the popular vote. She took office as president of South Korea on February 25, 2013. Park was faced with a number of challenges, including the country’s high household debt and ongoing tensions with North Korea.\n\nIn April 2014 the Park administration was heavily criticized after the sinking of the ferry Sewol, in which more than 300 people died. It was the country’s worst disaster in nearly two decades. Many critics faulted the government for its handling of the incident and for having failed to enforce safety regulations. Several members of Park’s administration resigned, including the prime minister and Park’s top national security adviser. Moreover, the coast guard’s poor response during the crisis led Park to disband the service. The coast guard’s rescue duties were transferred to a new national safety agency.\n\nIn 2016 a major corruption scandal erupted when South Korea’s largest newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, reported that a member of Park’s administration had threatened to audit a number of large companies if they did not donate to two charitable foundations. Those foundations were later revealed to be connected to Choi Soon-Sil, a close friend of Park’s. Investigators concluded that Choi and her associates had used their ties to the president to enrich themselves. Choi was arrested in November 2016, and lawmakers soon began proceedings to remove Park from power. On December 9, 2016, the National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to impeach Park on corruption charges. Her presidential powers were suspended while the country’s Constitutional Court considered whether to remove her from office permanently. On March 10, 2017, the court unanimously voted to uphold Park’s impeachment, and she was formally removed as president. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-Ahn, who had served as acting president during Park’s suspension, continued in that role until new elections could be held. Park was arrested on March 31, 2017, on corruption charges that included bribery and extortion. In April 2018 she was convicted on multiple criminal charges, including bribery and abuse of power. She was sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $17 million."
