        "text": "South Korea’s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye on Friday, removing her from office over a graft scandal that has gripped the country for months.\n\nPark, 65, becomes the country’s first democratically elected leader to be ousted from office. A presidential election will be held in 60 days, according to the constitution.\n\nFollowing is a timeline of main developments in the scandal and events in her life and political career.\n\n1974: Park’s mother is killed by a bullet fired by a pro-North Korea assassin trying to kill her father, President Park Chung-hee. Park became acting first lady.\n\n1979: Park’s father is assassinated by his disgruntled spy chief.\n\n1998: Park returns to political life after years of seclusion. She becomes a member of parliament with a vow to save the country suffering from an Asian financial crisis.\n\n2004: Park becomes leader of the main conservative party, which scores an upset victory in parliamentary elections.\n\n2006: An assailant slashes Park’s cheek with a knife during an election rally.\n\n2012: Park wins her party’s primary to become presidential candidate and defeats liberal candidate Moon Jae-in.\n\nFeb 25, 2013: Park is sworn in as the first female president of South Korea, promising an era of hope.\n\nApril 16, 2014: The sinking of the Sewol ferry with the death of 304 people, most of them schoolchildren. The toll is attributed to the Park government’s failure to act quickly.\n\nOct. 25, 2016: Park makes her first public apology for giving a friend, Choi Soon-sil, access to draft speeches during the first months of her presidency.\n\nOct. 31, 2016: State prosecutors arrest Choi on suspicion of exerting inappropriate influence over state affairs.\n\nNov. 4, 2016: Park makes her second televised apology, saying she would take responsibility if found guilty.\n\nNov. 20, 2016: Prosecutors indict Choi on charges of abuse of power and attempted fraud.\n\nNov. 29, 2016: In her third televised apology, Park asks parliament to decide how and when she could give up power over the scandal.\n\nDec. 9, 2016: Parliament votes to impeach Park. She is stripped of powers while awaiting a court decision on the vote. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn becomes acting president.\n\nJan. 1, 2017: Park denies wrongdoing, calling accusations “fabrication and falsehood.”\n\nFeb. 17: Samsung Group chief Jay Y. Lee arrested for suspected role in the scandal.\n\nFeb. 28: Special prosecutor indicts Lee and other company executives for bribery and embezzlement.\n\nMarch 6: The special prosecutor says Park colluded with Choi to take bribes from the Samsung Group, paving the way for her to be prosecuted, if she is ousted from office.\n\nMarch 9: Lee’s trial begins on charges of bribery and embezzlement. He was indicted on charges including pledging 43 billion won ($37.24 million) in payments to Choi."
