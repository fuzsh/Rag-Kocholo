The introduction outlines major themes of this collection, which seeks to reopen the question of medieval abstractions, interrogating the term itself and asking about the ways it can be fruitfully applied to pre-modern material culture. It also provides an overview of contributions, which approach the concept of medieval abstraction from a multitude of perspectives—formal, semiotic, iconographic, material, phenomenological, epistemological. Keywords: abstraction, terminology, theory, Haggadah, matzah\n\nOn folio 22r of the thirteenth-century Hispano-Moresque Haggadah (Bl Ms. Or 2373) a kaleidoscopic circular image splits open a page of text, its axial symmetry indicated by four pyramidal protrusions on four sides (Figure 0-1).1 The protrusions, which dip into the text at an angle, are placed as if to suggest movement: the riotous circle—red, gold, silver, blue—seems poised to roll off the page onto the preceding folio. There, a word panel indicates the nature of the form: ‫ מצה‬, ‘matzah’, or the unleavened Passover bread (Figure 0-2). What are we to make of this startling image? Some of its elements seem, by all measures, abstracted and abstract—at least so in their modern sense: nonrepresentational and non-denotative, the image indexes its ostensible model only inasmuch as it echoes the round form of the actual bread. This is a matzah that is not a matzah: visually divorced from its prototype, it is semiotically trussed to it through the written word. It is a form that signals the unrepresentability of what is really at stake: no longer just an element of a Seder dinner, it is the metaphorized affliction of the Jewish people, a marker of their identity, an embodiment of their longing for divine redemption. It also is, most potently, a container for the Divine\n\nGertsman, E., Abstraction in Medieval Art: Beyond the Ornament.

The Shekhinah is a malleable vessel, void of definitive form or colour: an ever-shifting template whose shape and appearance are predicated on any given beholder’s cognitive apparatus as much as on any given projection of the divine.2 So it is with the Hispano-Moresque ‘matzah’, its interlaced form arrested in mid motion, plotting to escape both the page and the beholder’s grasp. This matzah’s emphatic abstraction is predicated on and brought into contrast with the figurative elements it comprehends: the four quadrupeds arranged around a floral form at the centre and a speckling of minute trifoliate plants against red and blue colour fields. It is, thus, also abstract in a very medieval sense, which sees abstraction not as the opposite of figuration but as its integral aspect. But the language with which we describe this form is patently post-medieval: ‘abstraction’ as a term in its application to visual culture is a phenomenon of the recent centuries. The Latin term abstractio, at least as it is known to us from the assorted writings on perception, mathematics, noetics, and universalism, as well as through a series of reinterpretations—Boethian reinterpretations of Aristotle, Aquinian reinterpretations of Boethius—means something else entirely. What this\n\n20\n\nElina Gertsman\n\nsomething else is constitutes one of the central questions of the present collection, wherein nearly every essay chafes at the confines imposed by modern vocabulary on medieval works of art: ‘ornament’, ‘decoration’, ‘abstraction’, ‘geometry’, ‘nonrepresentation’, ‘non-f iguration’, ‘stylization’, ‘non-denotation’, ‘non-mimesis’, ‘subtraction’, ‘lack’ flit in and out of these papers, here reluctantly discarded, there exultantly embraced. In this way, each essay toils, on the one hand, to disentangle present-day terms from objects at hand, and, on the other, to formulate productive ways to think through and build up concepts of what medieval abstraction might and might not be, how it might be manifested, and how it might be described. A project like this is utterly new, and yet its historiographic roots reach to the first years of the twentieth century, to Wilhelm Worringer’s Abstraktion und Einfühlung (1907; published in 1908) and Formprobleme der Gotik (1912).3 Worringer did not study medieval abstraction in any sustained way however, and neither did other luminaries of the field: not Henri Focillon in his remarkable Vie des forms (1934), which considers Romanesque painting in terms of space and/as ornament; not Ernst Gombrich in the erudite The Sense of Order (1979), where Ottonian illumination rubs shoulders with pre-Columbian sculpture. 4 When abstraction does become a focus of a continuous inquiry, the emphasis, not surprisingly, shifts to early medieval art. The writings of Victor Elbern, for instance, focus on metalwork; eschewing the question of ornament, he had written on the aniconic and the non-figurative schemata, emphasizing particularly the form of the Cross.5 Jean-Claude Bonne, conversely, has dedicated a great part of his scholarship to the question of ornament, particularly in Insular illumination, and has drawn connections between medieval visual culture and modern/contemporary art.6 Several recent studies tug the notion of abstraction in different temporal directions, towards late antiquity on the one hand, and towards Gothic art on the other.7 Of course, to fully reassess the historiography of abstract forms one would have to attend to a colossal constellation of studies, ranging from those on abstraction in medieval philosophy—such as Alain de Libera’s L’art des généralités—to those on abstraction in modern and contemporary visual culture: a patent impossibility within the scope of this unavoidably brief preface.8 Instead, in order to avoid being reductively selective here, I asked contributors to this volume to bring up and reassess as needed key studies in abstraction immediately relevant to their own essays. The resultant historiographic mosaic proves to be instructive, as from the very start the authors were given a wide-ranging brief: to approach the concept of medieval abstraction from a multitude of perspectives—formal, semiotic, iconographic, material, phenomenological, epistemological. This brief was framed by a still broader set of questions. Abstraction haunts medieval art, both withdrawing figuration and suggesting elusive presence. How does it make or destroy meaning in the process? Is it by detaching itself from matter and foregrounding the figurative?\n\nPreface: Withdr awal and Presence\n\n21\n\nIs it by dissolving the figurative into matter, by calling attention to the surface and to its planar artifice? Do the figurative and the abstract collapse upon each other? In what way does abstraction represent or deny? Does abstraction suggest the failure of figuration, the faltering of iconography, and can it truly escape the semiotics of colour or form? Does medieval abstraction function because it is imperfect, incomplete, and uncorrected—and is therefore cognitively, visually demanding? Is it, conversely, precisely about perfection? Just how closely are medieval abstraction and vision connected, and to what extent is the abstract predicated on theorization of the unrepresentable and imperceptible? Is there something intrinsic about the connection between abstraction and the divine? How much can the abstract really comprehend and elide with the aniconic? Does medieval abstraction pit aesthetics against metaphysics? How, f inally, does it define its viewers, medieval and modern? The Hispano-Moresque matzah image raises three broad themes—abstraction as the untethering of image from what it purports to represent, abstraction as a vehicle for signification, and abstraction as a form of figuration—and it is these themes that give general shape to the present book. Its first part is concerned with shifting dissemblance that simultaneously denies and invites abstraction as signification. Because later medieval painting is often framed as the demise of Hiberno-Saxon abstract forms in anticipation of early modern ‘naturalism’, I wanted to open this book with a set of essays that tackle largely later medieval art, although the groundwork here is laid by Vincent Debiais’s chapter, which looks at the uses of plain colour in manuscripts and wall paintings created between the ninth and the twelfth centuries. Debiais parses our notions of the ‘figure’ and the ‘monochrome’, provocatively positing colour not as a sign for something else but rather as the very subject of the image under scrutiny—a notion heretofore limited to the discussion of modern and contemporary colour-field painting. The necessity to step away from the modern conception of abstractions is confirmed in Aden Kumler’s essay that explores the so-called reticulated grounds in Gothic illumination. Kumler focuses specifically on a framed, apparently aniconic, miniature in an early fifteenth-century copy of Guillaume de Deguileville’s Pèlerinage de l’ âme, to argue that in eschewing narrative figuration, the image functions as an exemplar and a vehicle of an explicitly medieval concept of abstraction, here in relation to Trinitarian ontology. This exceptional ontology can be no more comprehended than the divine essence of the unknowable God, communicated in the Kennicott Bible, as Adam S. Cohen and Linda Safran argue in their essay. The illuminator of this late medieval Jewish Iberian manuscript, Joseph ibn Hayyim, confronts the ineffability of seeing, reading, and grasping the biblical text through the device of abstraction, which mutates throughout the book, scattering itself across full-page compositions and side panels,\n\n22\n\nElina Gertsman\n\nthe binding and the paste-downs. Abstraction, Cohen and Safran suggest, offers access to the indescribable God through order, beauty, and, above all, infinity. This infinity, and the unknowability of the divine, are, finally, the subject of Robert Mills’s essay, which explores Hieronymus Bosch’s Visions of the Hereafter panels, concentrating specifically on their non-figurative backs. Generally considered to imitate stony surfaces, these paintings, Mills contends, are emphatically unlike stone: their dissemblance from what they purport to represent indexes the notion of dissimilitudo between divine substance and phenomenological, sensible corporeality. Like the plain-colour surfaces discussed by Debiais, these panels call attention to their own thingness, to the liquescence of their pigment; like the evacuated image in the Pèlerinage de l’ âme and the complex mazes in the Kennicott Bible, they ask that we look through, with, and ultimately beyond the threshold of the sensible. All four essays in the first part of the book make clear that abstraction, built as it is on the slippage between signification and aporia, is predicated on figuration. The role of figuration in the semiotics of the abstract stands at the core of the second part of the volume, which looks at the way that abstraction intervenes in figurable reality as a form and a sign. Here we take a chronological step back in order to look at early medieval manuscripts that have historically been seen as hospitable grounds to abstraction of form. Danny Smith’s essay explores the seventh-century Ashburnham Pentateuch, zeroing in on four patches of pink paint variously applied over the first and the second person of God. Like Mills, who evokes Jackson Pollock’s drip canvasses to structure his argument about the materiality of Bosch’s paint, Smith looks to the language of Barnett Newman’s ideographic paintings to articulate the abstraction of the Godhead as the painterly matter of Creation itself. In turn, Benjamin Tilghman borrows from Jasper Johns to explore the semiotic instability of Vespertinum monograms, which oscillate between abstraction and figuration. Just as contributors to the first part of the volume worry the question of unrepresentabilty by focusing on the disjunction between image and prototype, Tilghman locates abstraction in the tension (and, ultimately, divorce) between lettering and its content. This tension is also explored in Gia Toussaint’s essay that takes, however, a different approach to the complex relationship between writing and figuration. Toussaint studies three distinct cases of what she calls ‘abstract ornamentation’, and posits it as both a formal and a semiotic vehicle for meaning-making. Abstraction, for Toussaint, is thus a complex union of script and ornament, activated by the artist as well as the reader-viewer. This activation—evident especially in two tenth-century carmina figurata letter mazes—is similarly the predicate of viewing practices explored by Nancy Thebaut. Thebaut looks at several eleventh-century evangeliaries produced at Echternach, which unite and juxtapose monochrome or skeuomorphic paintings on one side of the folio with figural paintings on their\n\nPreface: Withdr awal and Presence\n\n23\n\nobverse. In examining such ‘monochromes’, Thebaut returns to some of the issues brought up by Debiais in his contribution, while her focus on the materiality of paint on these folios establishes a dialogue with Smith’s essay. She nonetheless arrives at a different aspect of abstraction, finding an analogy between the semiological transformation of colour fields across the folios and the ontology of the Eucharist itself predicated on transformation. If the first two parts of the book focused on essential ontological questions that tied abstraction, one way or another, to the celestial plane, the last section turns towards the natural world and to the human pursuits that define abstraction in epistemic terms, at turns poetic, at turns ecological, at turns scientific, and oftentimes fallible. The chronological range of the four essays here is less restricted, comprehending the temporal span of the first eight contributions. Danielle Joyner examines two sixth-century bird-shaped Frankish brooches as a succession of abstractions that here mean removals and withdrawals. Guided as much by Gallic poetry as by eco-critical approaches, Joyner suggests that jewelled pieces include ornithological and environmental abstractions—that is, abstraction of visual elements from real birds, and abstraction of stones and metals from the earth, as well as subsequent abstraction of animal form from these natural elements. The concept of abstraction as removal and withdrawal similarly governs Megan McNamee’s essay, which considers devotional images through the lens of mathematical treatises. McNamee turns to eleventh-century codices to problematize their planarity, framing it by contemporaneous discourses on geometry and optics: abstraction—here reduction and withdrawal of solid forms—is used as a pictorial strategy of divergence between what it is possible to clearly describe / imagine / see and what it is possible to represent. A similar kind of divergence is addressed in Taylor McCall’s piece on late medieval anatomical diagrams, which turned to abstraction of form—what she defines as a disassociation between the idea and its figuration—as a vehicle for communicating hidden physiologies. Both McNamee and McCall ultimately see abstraction as an example of failure of figuration to show what cannot be shown. The same is finally true for Harris’s essay, which explores a fourteenth-century Hebrew Bible illuminated by Joshua ibn Gaon, where, however, even abstraction falters, serving as it does as an index and a sign of human fallibility in the face of divine perfection. Like McNamee’s flat cubes and McCall’s geometricized organs, the full-page abstractions on the pages of ibn Gaon’s Bible are purposefully flawed—flawed as a way to show the failure to represent what is ultimately unrepresentable. In suggesting painting as an analogy for an impossible ontology, Harris’s essay circles back to the issues tackled in the first part of the book: those of unrepresentability and dissemblance. Discussions of unrepresentability (of the divine) and fallibility (of human sight) similarly, and not surprisingly, govern Herbert Kessler’s response to the collection\n\n24\n\nElina Gertsman\n\nat hand. This penultimate essay focuses on the first cupola in the atrium of San Marco in Venice, but reaches broadly to comprehend the rich variety of topics brought up by other authors: the relationships between abstraction and figuration, abstraction and imagination, abstraction and materiality, abstraction and mathematics, abstraction and ineffability, abstraction and imperfection, abstraction and perception. Kessler’s response explores the San Marco cupola within a categorically medieval framework, calling up Honorius Augustodunensis in the epigraph, and carefully parsing sources from Pope Innocent III to Albertus Magnus and from Gerald of Wales to Pacificus of Verona. Still, even though the contributors to this volume aspire to study medieval abstraction on its own terms, they must, perforce, have recourse to present-day vocabularies and present-day definitions of the abstract. In fact, the shared visual vocabularies of images separated by many centuries have given rise, in the last decade, to a multitude of studies that ask whether medieval art is modern and whether modern art is medieval.9 While these questions are emphatically not the point of this book, several authors—notably Debiais, Mills, Smith, and Tilghman—evoke modern and contemporary art practices to set up their arguments. In order to give methodological shape to these evocations, this book’s coda, written by Charlotte Denoël, explores a complex set of affinities between medieval and contemporary art. In her essay, Denoël creates purposefully a-chronic conduits between Carolingian manuscripts and twentieth-century minimalist and conceptual art, to shed light on their visual and epistemological kinship. Denoël’s coda thus serves as a fitting conclusion to the book: it does not close the subject of medieval abstraction but rather opens it anew. The range of this book might be broad, but still, to many, it will not be broad enough: essays here focus on abstraction specif ically in the medieval art of Judaeo-Christian Europe, created between the sixth and the sixteenth centuries. This scope is predicated by what I see as shared ontological, theological, and epistemological concerns evidenced in the material culture that is delimited by fairly specific temporal and environmental geographies. It is not, as I write this, a fashionable position to take, at a time when we are acutely aware of the fraught history of our field that has long privileged Western medieval art.10 To that end, a word on these geographical limitations is needed. When I originally conceived of this volume and began conversations with colleagues and friends, I was pelleted with ideas: what about Almohad ornament? Byzantine gold ground? Buddhist aniconism? After a while, as I was jotting down notes, I became uncomfortably reminded of the famous fable that all of us Soviet children learned in school: Elephant paints a landscape and, before sending it out to the exhibition, invites friends to come and look at it. Everyone likes the painting but finds something missing: Crocodile wonders where the Nile is, Seal wishes for ice and snow, and\n\nPreface: Withdr awal and Presence\n\n25\n\nPig longs for acorns. Elephant picks up his paintbrush and adds all these elements, and then some (a pot of honey, just in case Bear is in the audience). Once finished, Elephant gathers his friends again, and they proclaim, quite justly, that the painting is an utter mess.11 Still, because of my long-standing commitment and scholarly sympathy to global medieval study, I cast a wide call for papers, gathering essays on Buddhist, Christian (both Western medieval and Byzantine), Islamic, Jewish, and Hindu art. When I began the editing process, however, it became abundantly clear that in my wish to be inclusive, I was doing the volume a disservice. The set of research questions I set out to explore was watered down, transformed into a cluster of case studies that pricked the surface of these questions; where many essays (included here) cohered beautifully, some seemed to stand on their own and therefore appeared definitively othered. All edited volumes, to some extent, present a congeries of sorts, but what I had on my hands was Elephant’s mess that tried both my scholarly and moral principles. The volume had to be transformed, its focus tightened, its cultural bounds redrawn; certain essays had to go, others had to be commissioned. The majority of those writers I had to leave behind saw perfectly my quandary and generously endorsed my decision. I am as grateful to them as I am to the authors whose essays I did include, and who bore my convolutions of conscience—which remade the volume nearly from scratch and therefore took a fair amount of time—with patience and encouragement. Perhaps this book will serve as an impetus for another volume on the subject, one with a global focus. After all, in my experience, the project of medieval abstraction is not unlike the impossible matzah of the Hispano-Moresque Haggadah: rich, colourful, kaleidoscopic, it keeps expanding and turning, seemingly without end. Scholastics talked about abstraction as an intellectual process that allows one to strip facts and phenomena of their specifics, and move from the sensorial observation to an ontological understanding of the universe. In putting together this volume, I borrow from their playbook: I hope that the sum total of this collection will allow the reader to isolate the multivalent meanings of ‘medieval abstraction’ from every given essay and put them together in order to move from specifics— reticulated Gothic ground, a geometricized bird, a figureless monochrome—to something rather more general, more universal, and therefore, dare I say, rather more abstract.\n\n26\n\nElina Gertsman\n\nNotes 1.\n\n2.\n\n3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.\n\nThe Hispano-Moresque Haggadah (BL ms.

Because they lack ‘images’, these colours cannot be analysed iconographically; because they lack ‘patterns’ or ‘motifs’, they cannot be studied as manifestations of medieval ornament. Considering the possibility of ‘abstraction’ in medieval art allows, however, for a change in focus: colour can become a sign of what escapes f iguration, revealing the essence of the subject and drawing attention to pictorial means. By exploring the notions of ‘paradox’ and ‘monochrome’, I discuss some examples of western medieval plain colour paintings created between the ninth and the twelfth centuries, and their relevance for a history of abstraction before the rise of abstract art. Keywords: figure; Gospels; abstraction; monochrome; sign; colour\n\nSymbolic approaches to medieval visual culture often establish colour as one of the most stable and unambiguous systems of signs: colours can be coded and decoded throughout the Middle Ages as markers of dual oppositions between good and evil, pure and impure, sacred and profane, male and female, etc.1 Colours would in this context complement an image or an object, qualify its status, and give its meaning. However, recent studies devoted to the anthropology of colour in the Middle Ages—to its social function of designation, distinction, or discrimination; to its empirical properties, material and economic value; and finally to its role in the network of medieval symbolic meanings—have shown that colour sometimes functions as a sign on its own, whether alone or in its interaction with other colours.2 Nevertheless, one still resists this possibility of meaning when colour, while being a sign, does not constitute an image. This is particularly the case for plain colour fields displayed independently of any other figure, which do not imitate, evoke, or even recall stone, marble, or any other architectural device. But it is also the case of the colour fields used as background for the implementation of figures\n\nGertsman, E., Abstraction in Medieval Art: Beyond the Ornament.

Here, colour acts in the place of the image, as it also does in many manuscripts; however, are its function and status restricted to the role of a partition, or of a background? How are we to articulate the presence of colour and the depth of the image? What kind of relationship does colour induce between figures and the image as a whole? This chapter addresses the use of plain colours in medieval manuscripts and wall paintings as evidence of visual abstraction during the Middle Ages. Such colour displays have received little attention in scholarship. By focusing on the two notions of figura and ‘monochrome’, this chapter explores some examples of plain colour paintings between the ninth and twelfth centuries in Western Europe, and their relevance for a history of abstraction before the rise of abstract art.\n\nThe ‘Monochrome’ Issue We must first distinguish the use of several colours with no figures from the use of a single colour. In the first case, colours, if they withstand what Yves-Alain Bois has referred to as ‘egoism’—i.e. if their visual impact or technical display do not make their chromatic environment disappear3—can interact and produce a discourse by virtue of their contrast, harmony, or complementarity.4 In the second case, colour must act by itself, much in the same way that shade and nuance do during the early modern period and as monochrome paintings do in contemporary art.5 The term ‘monochrome’, however, is never applied to such practices for the Middle Ages.6 On the contrary, art history uses it to describe the display of a single-colour figure set against a plain, light background: sketches, for examples, or line drawings, or grisailles in manuscript and glass paintings.7 And although medieval painting rarely meets the present-day definition of monochrome—first of all, for technical reasons related to the production of colours, whose uniformity of texture and shade is difficult to obtain; second, because changing light conditions (candlelight, daylight, etc.) often led to the perception of changing shades and fluid colours8—the term ‘monochrome’ is used in the following text to designate the implementation of a single, plain colour field (bounded or not) in the manuscript or in the monumental domain. The discussion of medieval monochromes—what we can call here a ‘monochrome hypothesis’—raises two essential issues: that of the frame and that of the application (or lack thereof) of a colour on the support. To explore these two issues, let us focus on two ‘images’ figuring the celestial silence of Rev 8:1 in two manuscripts of Beatus of Liébana’s Tractatus de Apocalypsin, a famous commentary written around 785 in the north of Spain.9 These two images belong to a larger ensemble of paintings\n\nColour as Subjec t\n\n35\n\nFigure 1-1. Silos Beatus, 1091-1109. London, British Library, Add. 11695, fol. 125v. Photo: The British Library.\n\ndepicting the moment of silence in the manuscript corpus of Beatus’s commentary, but they are the only ones that use a monochrome device. Fol. 125v in the Silos Beatus (painted around 1091–1109) presents a plain yellow field at the top of the inner text column (Figure 1-1); it is bound with a fine black edge, and is decorated with black lines on the sides and corners.10 The yellow colour has been painted directly onto the ruled writing space on the parchment, so the dry-point lines produce variations in the texture and shades of the yellow rectangle, which appears as a space of light in the centre of the page. In fol. 123v of the Urgell Beatus (dated late tenth century), the monochrome device is different (Figure 1-2).11 It also uses a frame made of a thin red line, but this edge encloses a piece of parchment that has been left blank. Ruling lines are clearly visible and only the frame makes an image appear in the manuscript—the monochrome hypothesis relies on the distinction of a surface within and without the rectangle through the device of the frame.12 One could certainly consider that the absence of any chromatic mobilization produces a phenomenon of a-chromia rather than of monochrome, but the implementation of a frame and the voluntary delimitation of an amount of material transform the parchment space into a ‘form’, with extended geometric proportions and colour, which, though not the result of any artistic gesture, builds an image of silence.13 The short text written vertically on the left of the edge, silentium zzzzzzzzz, makes this form explicit.14 These two examples attest, on the one hand, to the diff iculty of f inding in medieval practices a creative gesture based exclusively on the implementation of a plain colour. On the other hand, they show that such plain colour devices can act as ‘images’ even if no sign or pattern has been painted on the field. The stand-alone\n\n36\n\nVincent Debiais\n\nFigure 1-2.

It invites a discussion of the notion of background, both obvious and problematic in the context of two-dimensional images.16 The background is at the same time the partition separating an image from another part of the folio or wall, and the screen on which the image is projected, the space created for the display of the figures. Despite its flatness, the background allows to stage complex relations in the depth of the painted area with shapes and colours placed behind or underneath other colours and shapes. In this case, colour acts as a figure, as is best seen in the use of purple backgrounds in Carolingian and Ottonian Gospel books.17 Let us take the example of the double page at the beginning of the Gospel according to Matthew in a Gospel book painted in Cologne around 1030.18 Fol. 8v presents\n\nColour as Subjec t\n\n37\n\nthe author’s portrait (Figure 1-3): Matthew is shown writing the incipit of his text on a scroll held by an angel; he sits under a pediment surmounted by buildings and towers, which rest on two green marble columns with vegetal capitals. The entire composition is painted against a gold background in the upper part of the image, while a green strip below suggests the ground on which the furniture and columns rest. The location and display of the image are bounded on the folio by the tracing of a wide pink edge; its colour matches the colour of the pediment. This visual echoing equates the border with an architectural element that encloses the image in the centre of the page. The plain and flat coloured field in the background of the author’s portrait (present in all four evangelist portraits in the Cologne manuscript) contrasts with the projecting architecture of the pediment and with the furniture arrangement; its non-mimetic aspect seems in a certain way disconnected from the actual figuration of the writing action in the foreground, by contrast with the colour green used to display genuine material (marble and parchment).19 However, the colour field plays a vital role in the development of the visual discourse since it distinguishes the place of the material and terrestrial environment of the scribe’s action (the columns, the floor, the phylactery) from the divine and sacred content of what is written. Matthew’s gesture is akin to that of piercing the phylactery to bring out the light of the background, the light that also shapes the golden letters, the evangelist’s and the angel’s nimbus, and that diffuses on the columns. The angel’s location—he seems to arise from behind the pediment—ensures the connection between the two planes of the painting. If the colour field in the background is still non-mimetic, it is no longer non-figurative because it fully acts as an image of sacredness in the representation of the writing action. Facing Matthew’s portrait in the same manuscript, fol. 9 presents the incipit Liber generationis written on a purple background. It is framed by a double golden edge decorated with vegetal motifs and four medallions with busts. In the centre of this purple window, the beginning of Matthew’s Gospel is painted on either side of the initial L decorated with foliage and zoomorphic elements, tearing the plain colour with a vertical wound. The way the edge and ornaments have been staged against the purple, and the contrast between its colour and the colour of the letters, reinforce the presence of the plain colour in the background: it is as if the painter physically placed the alphabetic and iconic figures upon the colour field. What constituted the background in the author’s portrait is brought back to the foreground and is fixed in gold in the first words of Matthew’s Gospel. In a chromatic staging of the paradigm of the Incarnation, the purple colour field becomes the ‘place’ of the Scripture and the gold the Scripture itself: the Word (gold) becomes flesh (purple).20 The coloured field behind the letters is no longer a simple background for writing, but a figure presenting a theological reality in the interplay of contrasts and complementarities between colours.\n\n38\n\nFigure 1-3. Cologne Gospels, c. 1030. New York, Morgan Library, ms. 651, fols. 8v-9r.\n\nVincent Debiais\n\nColour as Subjec t\n\n39\n\nIn both images of this manuscript, the figurative reality of colour devices invites a consideration of the depth of the paintings: not as the juxtaposition of different colour fields but rather as the superposition of colours, with their phenomena of transparency, opening, and tearing. Placing images within the page and its frame is not only a matter of location upon a coloured background that would not produce anything in the shape and meaning of the painting; it is also a real disposition (in the rhetorical understanding of the word dispositio), organizing and transforming all the elements of the image into a new paradigm. In the frame, the plain colour of the background physically and intellectually merges with what has been painted on or in it. Engaging with the meaning of the monochrome backgrounds in the Cologne Gospel Book challenges the obvious flatness of medieval images and questions the very principle of what a background could be. The depth of the images is emphasized by the interplay of plain colours that can appear and disappear within a frame, that can move forward and backward according to the disposition of figures, and that can be seen through other colours. They should be regarded as successions of plans, as photographs or theatre stages. There, monochrome is not a choice par défaut but a visual device participating in the composition of the whole image. In the Cologne Gospel Book, the purple element has been staged behind the golden letters, and both colours move and act as figures in the depth of the folio.21 In the Cologne manuscript, the purple figures are used only for the incipits according to various modalities in the form and ornament of the edge, or in the calligraphic treatment of the letters; on these pages, colour acquires a figurative dimension despite the absence of figures. Nonetheless, in many other examples of Ottonian illumination, purple pages are used for various texts and images in Gospel books, as well as calendar and prayer pages in sacramentaries. Does such a diffusion of this chromatic process make colour less significant, less figurative, or more ornamental? The question should be raised even if the differences in the background colour seem to indicate a hierarchy of contents: for example, purple backgrounds are used only for the copy of the canon of the Mass in the sacramentary from St. Vitus of Monchengladbach—staging the liturgical moment of the consecration22—or St. Jerome’s preface in the Gospel book from Milan.23 If colour is not always a figure in these examples, it acts as a sign distinguishing specific parts of the manuscripts. The use of plain background colours in Matthew’s double page in the Gospel book of Cologne is a monumental example of the way that colour can indicate the nature or status of the text: here, purple and gold are the index of Christ’s dual nature. In other cases, these colours point out specific parts of the ritual or the special agency of sacramental sentences. The purple field, then, despite its diffusion, does not lose significance: instead, it physically creates a specific figurative environment for the written words.\n\n40\n\nVincent Debiais\n\nFigure 1-4. St. Vitus Sacramentary, c. 1050. Freiburg, Universitätsbibliothek, cod. 360a, fol. 20r.\n\nIn all these examples, colour is applied within an ornamental edge that does not contain it entirely. This edge is less a hermetic frame than a device presenting colour. Vegetal elements are meant to bring colour to the foreground and to give it a shape and order—in other words, to create a place for writing to be and to act, to participate in the design of what we have been calling a stage. Because it constitutes the environment of the text, the colour’s autonomy of meaning does not disappear because it stays behind the letters. Ottonian illumination provides many examples of colour fields continuing to act as figures in the framework of complex compositions. In the sacramentary of St. Vitus of Monchengladbach, three folios with no trace of writing follow the copy of the canon of the mass ending on fol. 20r (Figure 1-4).24 These pages have been painted with a purple colour field enshrined in an ornamental edge. Text resumes on fol. 22v, after a blank folio—with, however, a different colour arrangement. Fols. 20v–22r install colour as figures at the turning point of the manuscript between the text of the Canon and the Proper of the Mass (with Christmas liturgy beginning on fol. 22v). This break also corresponds to a switch from one hand to another in the manuscript, and it is quite tempting to explain the painting of these empty colour fields by technical conditions during the fabrication\n\nColour as Subjec t\n\n41\n\nof the manuscript, and by the preparation of a surplus of purple pages.25 Even if this possibility cannot be completely rejected, one should nonetheless consider that such negligence in the make-up of the manuscript is unlikely. The presence of colour might have been kept to highlight both the transition and the shift in the manuscript between liturgical texts of a different nature. Colour would thus enhance the permanence of liturgy and its effect, which persists after the suspension of the Agnus Dei (ending on fol. 20r) in the same way that colour fields persist after the suspension of writing. A random ordinatio of the manuscript (with a surplus of purple folios) is not incompatible with the interpretation of colour as a means to represent the particular temporality of medieval liturgy. In other manuscripts discussed below, the same device is used through the introduction of blank folios after the canon—regardless of the composition pattern of the quires—to point out the break in liturgical texts. In the sacramentary of St. Vitus however, the omnipresence of colour and its independence from writing are a way to translate into figures the very time of the liturgy and its relation to God’s persistence in the world.26 The choice between colour and no colour between purple and blank), which stages the suspension of liturgical words, is undoubtedly meaningful for what has been represented in the manuscript through a plain colour device. We could argue that the use of colour always produces phenomena of echoes and references among painted elements in the manuscript; it is a way of making images, signs, or visual properties endure, persist, and finally be present in other images. On the other hand, we could suggest that the use of no colour produces relation between the frame and the totality of the manuscript. The skin staged in the frame physically belongs to the whole object and such a blankness is probably a way to make this wholeness all persist in the part. In the same way that plain colour is not ornament in the St. Vitus sacramentary, blankness is not emptiness. Beyond any symbolism, colour/ no colour fields should be considered as processes of figuration by synecdoche in which monochromes elaborate on the relations between what has been painted and its physical, theological, and poetical environment. In other examples from Cologne, the presence of colour inside a frame and without any trace of writing can be found in manuscripts whose particular layout cannot be attributed to an imperfect fabrication of the book. The Gradus Gospel book, for instance, begins with a window opening onto a purple colour field: no text, no image here.27 A monumental majestas Domini is painted on the verso of this folio and the contrast between the two sides is striking: the dark density and plain feature of the colour field on the recto oppose the brightness of the leaf and omnipresence of figures and text on the verso. Purple colour almost disappears for the majestas Domini, and only remains as the background for the written names of the prophets and evangelists. Fol. 1, purple on the recto, gold on the verso, anticipates the device of chrysography on the scale of the manuscript. In the depth of colour\n\n42\n\nVincent Debiais\n\nand in the transparency of skin, one can see through the purple colour field the mandorla of the majestas Domini painting, and glimpse the divine presence through the body.28 The aniconic feature of plain colour on the recto should thus no longer be considered as non-figurative since, beyond any symbolism, it becomes the index of Christ’s presence in the manuscript, a presence revealed on the verso of the folio with the figurative painting of the majestas Domini. A purple field framed by an ornamental edge also opens the Gospel book from Bamberg cathedral.29 In this manuscript, it stands on the recto of a folio that features, on its verso, St. Jerome dictating his prologue. Here, colour is being built in the transition from the front of the leaf to the back, and the plain feature of the purple colour field gives way to a monumental interior and exterior landscape, furnished and inhabited by the writing gesture. In the Gospel book from St. Gereon in Cologne, the purple field is painted on the folio facing the majestas Domini on fol. 13r, creating the same opposition between darkness and light as in the Gradus manuscript.30 In Gundold Gospels, a dark edge encloses a space of virgin parchment facing John the Evangelist’s portrait painted on fol. 71.31 In these examples, technical reasons and possible issues regarding the ordinatio of quires cannot explain the figurative monumentality of colour as it is staged in the manuscript. The ability of colour to stand by itself as a figure, in dialogue with the copy of texts or the figurative images, led the painters to use it as an autonomous visual object at the core of the manuscript. As a monochrome gesture, the colour field possesses a shape and a meaning despite the lack of any other figure.\n\nSaturation and Ornament: Monumental Painting In the manuscript world, the use of plain colours differentiates specific places on the folio by establishing a disjunction between colour and colourlessness, between the inhabited space created by pigments and the relative virginity of the parchment left blank.32 The application of colour is therefore the sign of a pictorial gesture, a gesture of domestication of matter by a figure. Surrounded by a frame or not, colour fields create a space with extended and chromatic properties, a space that acts across textual, figurative, and ornamental environments throughout any given manuscript. Such a dynamic process of signification is based on the rhetorical ability of colours to create semantic links among visual elements and at different scales. Figurations by synecdoche, as in the Cologne Gospel Book and the St. Vitus sacramentary, are possible because they take place in the specific context of liturgical manuscripts, but they are mainly predicated on the ability of colours to act as figures. Therefore, monumental paintings often use the same monochrome devices in the dispositio of\n\nColour as Subjec t\n\n43\n\nFigure 1-5. Biblical narratives on the vault, c. 1100. Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, abbey church, nave. Photo: Vincent Debiais.\n\nthe images. Little is actually known about these backgrounds, about the conditions of their implementation, and their meaning in medieval buildings. Some recent investigations in archaeology and archaeometry at Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe have shown, for example, that the large coloured areas were painted a fresco in the Old Testament cycle on the vault of the nave of the abbey church.33 Human figures, architectural frames, and natural elements were, conversely, painted a secco onto these backgrounds, building a narrative sequence of scenes. For instance, the installation of a field of colour following a white background underlines the shift from one scene to another in the cycle of Noah (Figure 1-5): in the sequence representing Noah’s drunkenness and nakedness, and Canaan’s curse, the figures are first set on a green background, then on a white field; after that, first a yellow then a green background is painted, before returning to a white field in the following scene (the construction of the Tower of Babel). In this sequence, the switch from the white background to a colour field cannot be understood as a strict iconographic index, in the sense that the use of a specific colour cannot be systematically associated with a particular environment, figure, or action (to emphasize the indoor/outdoor opposition, for example); and this is the case for all the sequences painted on the vault. Within the same scene, the use of colour, and even more the contrast between two colours, highlights a particular element within the narrative.34 This is the case in the scene representing Canaan’s curse, where the yellow/green background visually increases the opposition between the cursed son (pictured on the yellow\n\n44\n\nVincent Debiais\n\nbackground) and his two brothers, who have not seen their father’s body in the scene of Noah’s drunkenness (pictured on the green background). This is also the case in the scene figuring Abel’s murder, where the violence of Cain’s gesture and its consequences are painted against a dark brown background in contrast to the two light sequences adjoining the scene. Unlike what we saw in the manuscripts example, colour fields do not possess any depth in Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe paintings. They do not reinforce the superposition of planes but the juxtaposition of the narrative elements, and thus offer a chromatic modality for the succession of the biblical events. If colour acts as one of the means to create a specific rhythm for the narrative, it also contributes to its accentuation and tonicity.35 Moving from one colour to another allows phenomena of acceleration or, on the contrary, of dilation of narration beside the profusion of figures and other painted elements. In Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, the coloured background constitutes the continuum of the decor and its rhythmic consistency within a very complex and syncopated narration that moves from one point of the vault to another.36 Colour visually stages the time frame of history, in the same way that purple backgrounds in the manuscripts from Cologne set the time frame of liturgy on the parchment. In this sense, there is a clear contrast between the continuous colour fields shaping the ground of the scenes, and the vertical succession of backgrounds that create the different sequences of the narrative. The first few feature either light or dark lines representing vegetal or mineral elements that transform colour into a natural environment, or a pattern of thin red and yellow strips. On the contrary, backgrounds are perfectly plain and the figures standing before the colour field are first set onto the ‘soil’ in such a way that the chromatic continuity of the background of the narrative is not interrupted by the deployment of images. A clear example is the tree at the forefront of the construction of the Tower of Babel: like the human figures and the building, it seems to stand before the white-painted background at the back of the scene. Colour thus appears as the continuous epidermis of the church. It saturates the decor on certain locations, creating special ‘places of images’ according to the narrative and theological discourse painted at the vault of the nave.37 The question raised by the colour fields in the Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe wall paintings does not concern the hypothetical figurative feature of plain colours but rather whether they should be considered as part of the decorative ornamental system within the church. Should they be treated in the same way we consider the ornamental ridge running throughout the entire nave from east to west? Do they possess the same nature and function as the strips separating the two registers on each side of the vault? Can they be likened to the painted architectural elements (arches, windows)? Do they belong to the same decorative gesture that led to the painting of false marble and cut stones on the lower part of the pillars and walls?\n\nColour as Subjec t\n\n45\n\nIs plain colour pure ornament? As the colour backgrounds in the scenes present no geometric, vegetal, or animal patterns, and because their location and format escape any systematization but visually accentuate the different rhythms of the biblical narrative, they do not belong to the main definition of ornament. Can ornament be conceived without shapes or patterns? Indeed, both the role of the colour fields in the organization of the Old Testament narrative and their relationship to the painted figures make colour act as the ‘ornament’ of the visual discourse, if we consider it from a rhetorical point of view. From this perspective, the colour of images produces the ‘colour’ of the narrative.38 The chromatic choice is neither more incidental nor more uncertain than the use of rhetorical figures in the production of a textual discourse. The absence of any representation within the colour field does not erase the ability of these background to shape the narrative. To put it simply, colourful backgrounds in the Saint-Savin paintings show that the syntax of images should also consider the analysis of plain colour fields, not because they are a technical data for the implementation of painted or carved images, but because they build a significant place for the image and because they give it a ‘colour’ in the same way that figures of speech produce a significant place in the text and grant it a poetic substance. Thus, we can no longer consider that, because it is plain or empty, or in the background of an image, colour does not contribute anything to the visual discourse. On the contrary, if we give it the rhetorical dimension it actually presents in most medieval images, colour signifies a figure of speech, and so stands at the crossroads of ornament and ‘ornamentality’, to put it in Jean-Claude Bonne’s words.39 It does not constitute the subject of the image, but it is what makes possible the image’s implementation and what reveals it, surrounds it, and gives it a particular semantic depth. This was already the case for the Ottonian manuscripts. In the opening page of Matthew’s Gospel, gold and purple are not the subject of the painting, but colours are the visual device putting the incipit Liber generationis into perspective with the entire theology of the Incarnation. In the sacramentary of St. Vitus, the subject of the painting is the canon of the Mass, and colours are a way to inscribe liturgical formulae into a specific conception of time and speech. In monumental paintings as in the manuscript domain, colours possess the agency to transform the visual discourse appealing to the rhetorical properties of order, quality, and emphasis.\n\nColour as Subject Looking at the use of monochrome in medieval paintings suggests the ability of colour to move from having representational properties in the visual display to becoming the subject of a pictorial action. 40 The pages showing nothing but colour\n\n46\n\nVincent Debiais\n\nin the manuscripts from Cologne might be evidence of such a conception, even if one cannot exclude that, with this device, Christ, figured in purple and gold, remains the ‘real’ subject displayed on the parchment. In a similar way, lime slurry or sludge on the walls of a religious buildings does not make ‘whiteness’ the real subject of the decor, but appears instead as a way of enhancing the church as the core of visual displays, functioning simultaneously as the signifier and the signified of its own presence in the shape and colour of the construction. Can medieval colour then reach the degree of significance at which it only constitutes a figure of itself? Can it attain the breaking point to refer to nothing but to what it is? A lot of research still has to be done on this topic, especially because it has to deal with a double dichotomy of figuration/non-figuration and ornamentation/narrativity. Such oppositions—too strong to belong to medieval aesthetics—do not allow us to consider the isolated and self-standing uses of colour as meaningful and figurative, just as they do not allow us to consider the uses for geometry, vegetal patterns, shadow/light contrasts, and scale effects as figurative, etc. On fol. 126v of the Gospel book from St. Andrew’s in Cologne, a large field of colour with shades of blue and green is painted and framed by an ornamental edge with vegetal patterns, as a window opening to the horizon, to the gathering of heaven and earth (Figure 1-6).41 As a landscape before the birth of landscape paintings, this image faces the evangelist Luke’s portrait on fol. 127. The simplest explanation, as for the purple backgrounds of other Cologne manuscripts, is that this chromatic device signals a missing image, a figuration that should be summoned by the spirit and triggered by the presence of God’s words in the manuscript.42 The relative emptiness of this folio would thus correspond to the blank folio facing Luke: a space to fill, in which colour is only the vehicle of a forthcoming image. Such a reading, as valid as it might seem, does not exhaust the visual devices implemented in the manuscript, and it must be considered, at least as a hypothesis, that the display of colour works here as a subject in itself, as an iconographic motif, and that it does not constitute a temporary state of visuality. Colour would be the real subject of the image and would refer to nothing but to itself. The painter would have figured colour precisely because it is at the core of the copy and illumination of the manuscript and allows for the very possibility of the book. Such a use of colour would be a creative gesture showing a profound reflexivity about the material ways of producing visuality, as deep as what can be seen in the calligraphic manipulation of letterforms, in the use of ornament, in the painting of portraits and narrative images. To attribute a figurative dimension to plain colours with no figures amounts to attributing to chromatic properties the ability to fully contain what they represent, in an intellectual movement back and forth between the idea and the visual means of its presence in the world—between the sign and its referent. This complex process, a synecdoche par excellence, is a form of abstraction in the medieval understanding\n\nColour as Subjec t\n\n47\n\nFigure 1-6.

In the examples presented in this short chapter, plain colours are abstractions of what they represent: Christ’s dual nature, liturgical time, the act of painting itself. Monochrome areas can therefore be called abstract images, not because they are non-figurative—on the contrary, they are, ontologically, figurations—but because the process of their creation and meaning passes through the epistemological process of moving from the part to the whole, from the object to the idea. As a process, medieval abstraction leads to a general emphasis on the pictorial means and on their persistence in the final result of the works of art; in the Gospel books from St. Andrew’s in Cologne, we can say that painting as the very process of abstraction is the subject of the image. Therefore, and even if this emphasis is one of the main features of modern painting from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, and even more in abstract art from the 1930s, it is, for different reasons, already at work in Western medieval art, where it fully participates in the definition of the artist in a relationship with God. 43\n\n48\n\nVincent Debiais\n\nNotes 1.\n\n2. 3.\n\n4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.\n\n13.\n\n14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19.\n\nMichel Pastoureau has already discussed the limits of such an unambiguous reading and shown how fluid medieval colours are. If symbolic, their reading and decoding should be careful and not systematic. For Pastoureau’s methodology, see Pastoureau, Figures et couleurs. For a bibliographical survey on this question, see Pulliam, pp. 3–5. I borrow the curious expression ‘egoistic colour’ from Yve-Alain Bois’s seminal but unpublished, lecture during the Paris symposium on Hubert Damish’s legacy; the lecture is available online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd0XrsAnCFQ (accessed 25 July 2020). The use of colours in heraldry and their discourse on medieval coats of arm are based on such relations between different colours; see the fundamental works by Michel Pastoureau on this question: Pastoureau, Figures et couleurs. Riout, pp. 39–44. As evidence of this, see Bath. See the variety of artistic manifestations gathered in the collective volume Aux limites de la couleur. Pastoureau, ‘Noir, gris, blanc’, pp. 16–18. On these images, see Debiais, Le silence dans l’art; Prado-Vilar, ‘Silentium’. For the context of images in the manuscripts of the Tractus de Apocalypsin, see Williams. London, British Library, Add. ms. 11695, f. 125v; on this manuscript, see Williams 2002, pp. 31–40 (n°16). Seu D’Urgell, Museo Diocesano, ms. 501, f. 123v; on this manuscript, see Vives. The Urgell Beatus copies an earlier version of the Tractatus and also borrows most of its images. The possibility of an unfinished image, blank by accident, remains for the figuration of silence on fol. 123v, even if the empty frame actually stages perfectly the idea of Rev 8:1; this is probably why this image has been left untouched at the end of the painting process. Prado-Vilar, p. 35. The image of silence in the Urgell Beatus should be put in perspective with other examples of empty frame or complex framing in medieval visual culture. See Méhu; Zchomelidse, pp. 247–53. For the implication of blankness and emptiness, see Gertsman, ‘Phantoms of Emptiness’. Prado-Vilar, p. 35. The interaction between the image and its frame has been addressed by Meyer Schapiro with the concept of ‘images-signs’; see Schapiro. The question of ‘backgrounds’ in medieval images has not been fully addressed; for a partial analysis, see Russo. See the reflections of Roger; Kessler, ‘The Eloquence of Silver’; Nees. New York, Morgan Library, ms. 651; Die ottonische Kölner Malerschule, 1967, n. 11, pp. 75–80; Ornamenta ecclesiae, 1985, v. 2, pp. 277–8. Cécile Voyer recently proposed similar interpretations for the relationships between letters, backgrounds, and architectural displays in the incipit paintings of Carolingian Gospel books; see Voyer.\n\nColour as Subjec t\n\n49\n\n20. Nees, p. 91 comments on the Godescal Gospel and the dedicatory poem; the first verses read: ‘The golden letters were written on pages painted purple. They reveal the celestial realm through the red-colored blood of God and the shimmering joys of the starry heaven, and the Word of God, glimmering in the majestic luster, promises the sparkling reward of eternal life.’ 21. Similar remarks could be made for the other double portrait-incipit pages in the Cologne manuscript where effects of depth are systematically present, and where plain colours act as figures. 22.
