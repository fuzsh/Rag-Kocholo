GILES AND STEVEN WAGSCHAL\n\nOne visitor to Iberia who left a particularly vivid account of his travels was the Enlightenment thinker and future president of the United States John Adams. On his 1779 voyage to France to carry out a diplomatic mission, Adams found himself stranded on the Galician coast after his frigate, the Sensible, took on water and had to be docked to await lengthy repairs. Adams elected to make the journey by land, across northern Spain, so that much of his journey followed the old Camino route to Santiago – albeit in reverse. Adams’s narrative not only records visual impressions, but strikingly describes the sounds, smells, tastes, and feel of eighteenth-century Iberia. His descriptions convey varying attitudes of curiosity, fascination, disapproval, and disgust. For instance, he hears the Spanish language as “harmony to the ear,” in contrast to “our language [which is] insipid and disgusting to them […] less sonorous, and infested with very dissagreable sibillations” (12.20).1 At times the chanting of monks pesters him like droning, swarming insects, but on other occasions is heard as beautiful music. The New Englander later enjoys the rhythms of a fandango song and dance. He is awakened by the smell of “the verdure in the gardens and fields,” the fragrances of “rich soil” and “very large” turnips and onions boiling in a pot, but also the reek of run-down inns filled with smoke and soot, where travellers share the filthy straw floors with livestock (12.14). Adams dwells on gustatory impressions, describing the pure waters of Asturian snow melt and how Spanish ladies savoured chocolate, sugar, and cakes. He repeatedly praises the “wines of the country […] good and wholesome […] red and white […] the Sherry, Alicante and Navarre […] the oldest and best” – although he was once offered a more questionable vintage: “the wine was very sour” (1.6). But what especially appeals to Adams’s palate are the produce, fish, and above all the cured hams, “most excellent and delicious,” raised on “chestnutts” and a “peculiar kind of acorns growing upon old pasture oaks, which were very sweet” (12.19). At the same time the reader can\n\n4\n\nRyan D. Giles and Steven Wagschal\n\nappreciate the feel of the warming sun on the coast, where Adams finds children “with necked legs and feet” standing on “stones in the mud,” followed by the sensation of the freezing highlands and the scourge of fleas, lice, and bedbugs (12.14). His written account of Iberia is, in a word, saturated with non-visual, sensory images. It is this often underappreciated range of imagery that concerns us in this volume. Its essays deal with the auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile experiences of Iberian writers and thinkers and span from the heyday of the medieval Camino to Santiago to the century in which Adams made his accidental journey. In spite of the “sensory turn” that has characterized studies in the humanities and social sciences over the past decade, very little scholarly attention has been directed to literary and cultural representations of non-visual sensory experiences – and much less to the Iberian Peninsula and in its colonies.2 Our purpose in this broad-ranging collection is to explore many of the ways in which Iberian writers crafted images to describe sensory perceptions of the Old and New Worlds, both real and imagined, from the Middle Ages to the early modern period. Previous research by Hispanists interested in the senses has tended to focus on visual representations and ekphrasis.3 Here we want to consider how medieval and early modern texts produced, activated, and continued to indulge the other senses (hearing, smell, taste, and touch) – from a multitude of perspectives, including literary and cultural history, philosophical aesthetics, and contemporary approaches to cognition. Our aim is to delve into the uses and meanings of these sensations in relation to material culture, employing other approaches that have developed over the past decade, including affective and cognitive studies and theories of embodiment in literature and culture. The essays show how the four non-visual senses, though underappreciated in most previous scholarship, are central to understanding Iberian authors and thinkers during the pre- and early modern periods. Furthermore, the collection has been envisioned as engaging with the growing field of Iberian Studies, conceived of as a dynamic interrelationship among cultures and languages, which are better understood in their plurality rather than in isolation. Emphasizing non-visual sensual representations, while still considering the power of sight, bridges various areas of interdisciplinary research. The essays engage a portion of the vast historical array of philosophical, medical, artistic, and cognitive conceptualizations of the senses. Both Plato and Aristotle set the stage for thinking about a hierarchical relationship among the senses. For the former, sight was the “noblest” (Republic bk 6: 256); for Aristotle, “above all others the sense of sight” is loved (Metaphysics A.1:689), and it was long ago recognized that some animals were superior to humans in the use of certain senses (e.g., Aristotle noted, correctly, that dogs had superior olfaction).4 The senses were understood in classical and medieval times as part of complex cosmological cycles. They were considered in relation to the Seasons, the Elements, the Constellations, and the\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nAges of Man, as well as to the four humours. Sight and hearing have often been conceptualized as distance senses, more closely associated with reason and even the divine. Isidore of Seville used distance in order to rank the senses; thus, sight was superior to hearing, which was superior to olfaction (Juttle 65). Touch and taste, as contact senses – for the body needs to come into direct contact with perceived objects – constituted a more direct connection to material culture. They were important for an understanding of the body and animal nature and, eventually, for recognizing the relation of the senses to the feelings and emotions of human beings; along with sight, each of the other four senses was symbolized by a different animal in many medieval illustrations.5 Aristotle and later thinkers theorized correctly that most sensation occurred in the brain, to which the various sensory organs transmitted information. However, there was considerable debate as to what role the nose had in this process, and it is the one sense that does not fit neatly in their hierarchies. For Aristotle olfactory sensation took place in the nose itself – just as sight occurs in the eyes – but for a majority of later thinkers from antiquity through most of the seventeenth century, including Galen and eventually the important Renaissance anatomist Vesalius, the nose was merely a conduit or “hollow tube” through which smells travelled to reach the brain where dedicated lobes (still known today as the “mamillary bodies,” since Avicenna had thought they looked like a woman’s breasts) sensed the smells (Palmer 62). In the Renaissance, anticipating Descartes, the Valencian humanist Joan Lluis Vives’s De anima et vita is the first work to explore in detail the fundamental relations between the senses and the arousal of emotional states, something that many current psychological and cognitive studies examine. Hedonic emotional states, as well as the unpleasant, anhedonic ones, including the emotion of disgust, are often aroused quite directly by some of the so-called lesser senses, especially olfaction and gustation. Beyond Sight will show how these sensory contexts are crucial to understanding cultural and literary encounters from these periods. Indeed, the hierarchy of the senses is somewhat unstable across cultures when studied scientifically in the twenty-first century. As cognitive linguists have recently demonstrated through a cross-cultural comparison of action verbs in thirteen languages, the sense of sight dominates language across cultures and appears to be universally considered the most important sense; while the importance of sight seems stable in this study of languages from nine different language families (including IndoEuropean, Mayan, and Niger-Congo), the position of the other senses in the hierarchy varies significantly (San Roque et al. 49–52).6 The essays in Beyond Sight will demonstrate a similar instability in their prominence across time, in which different senses, especially sound or smell, can take on a particular importance in changing socio-historical contexts.\n\n6\n\nRyan D. Giles and Steven Wagschal\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, poetic representations of the sensorial plane forged synaesthetic gateways to transcendence and the ineffable. Authors engaged in discourses of sacramental and purportedly miraculous seeing, hearing, tasting, and touching were central to efforts at affirming the faith, as were denials and deceptions of the senses. Such writers and their readers could be said to belong to what Barbara Rosenwein has described as “emotional communities,” which are brought together by shared “values,” “assumptions” and “accepted modes of expression” (24). She makes a distinction between larger and subdivided communities, considering how these interrelate and interact with “textual communities” and, more specifically, conventions of genres such as hagiography, which might predetermine the way emotional relations could be represented, promoted, or discouraged and for what purposes, be they ideological, didactic, or aesthetic (25–7). Members of these emotional communities might adapt from one set of expectations to those of another group, in terms of what emotional responses are to be emphasized or are idealized and in what contexts. The first section of the book, “Sensing Religion,” delves into all of these issues. It features two essays that study the importance of smell in the construction of saintliness and religious difference. It begins with “The Breath of Lazarus in the Mocedades de Rodrigo,” in which Ryan Giles examines a crucial episode from the medieval legend of the Cid’s youthful deeds, when the hero encounters a leprous beggar. Rodrigo offers charity to the stranger and experiences a prophetic dream. The ailing leper, now described as fragrant and dressed in white, speaks in Rodrigo’s ear, identifying himself as St Lazarus, sent by Christ to blow a fever into him, and in so doing to assure the hero’s victory in battle. Giles shows how the repellent, feverish flesh and breath of the leper challenged medieval Christians to reconfigure their senses and thereby perceive the fragrance of their Saviour’s redeeming Passion. The young Cid follows the example of saints and crusaders who drew on the model of Christus quasi leprosus to wage spiritual as well as military battles, conquering the stench of sin and death through the Passion and Resurrection of Christ’s anointed, sweetly fragrant flesh. Víctor Rodríguez-Pereira, in “Sabrosa olor : The Role of Olfaction and Smells in Berceo’s Milagros de Nuestra Señora,” then turns to Marian miracles collected by the medieval poet Gonzalo de Berceo in his Milagros de Nuestra Señora. The framed tales are preceded by an allegory that tells how the poet-pilgrim enters a garden with singing birds in trees, the sounds of a flowing river, and fragrant flowers. This sensory space freshens both the body and the mind, linking the sense of smell to an understanding of the meaning of Mary’s holiness. The same idea is explored later, when a cleric devoted to the Virgin dies and a flower grows out of his mouth, filling the air with a delicious smell, so that sensory reception is again linked to sanctifying grace. However, in the miracle that immediately\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nfollows it another cleric sings the five Joys of the Virgin – a song that, according to the poet, will protect Christians from being led into sin by their five bodily senses. Rodríguez-Pereira places Berceo’s writing in the context of medieval ways of understanding bodily senses, in particular smell, found in the works of theologians and hagiographic writers. His study demonstrates how Berceo draws on the danger of the olfactory as a pathway of deception and corruption, or as a means of revealing a higher truth that is conducive to salvation. Subsequent sections of the volume investigate the role of the mind in processing sensory information, as early modern writers engaged with a growing range of smells and tastes. They developed modernizing approaches to understanding the tangible and intangible, and ways of taking in and thinking about a range of urban sound- and smell-scapes. Renaissance and early modern humanists and travellers shed new light on experiences of pungent, bustling ports and city centres, and the exotic musical performances of empire. In this context Part II, “Cognition and the Senses,” offers an exploration of the period from the standpoint of scientific debates on the role of the senses in cognition, drawing on academic and popular treatises along with literary texts. In “The Internal Senses in Don Quixote and the Anatomy of Memory” Julia Domínguez considers the influence of early modern medicine in the masterwork of Spain’s best known author, Miguel de Cervantes. Her study examines numerous books on the subject from the fifteenth to the late sixteenth centuries with which Cervantes and his more well-read contemporaries would have been familiar. Not only do characters in the novel often suffer from pain, but a multitude of symptoms and ailments of different parts of the body are described, including neurological problems centred on the insanity of the main character, who frequently has difficulty correctly sensing and perceiving the world around him. This affliction is related to problems with what were called the interior senses or rational faculties of imagination, understanding, and memory, according to Renaissance neuropsychology. Specifically, Domínguez finds that the interior sense of memory, related to Quixote’s reading of chivalric novels, infringes on and impedes his ability to perceive what is taken in. Turning to medical literature, with which Cervantes was apparently familiar, along with other contemporary, Aristotelian theories, the essay sheds light on how Don Quixote’s interior sense of memory serves as a constant filter, bringing to mind what is remembered from books in a way that interferes with exterior sensation. In “Taste, Cognition, and Redemption in Guzmán de Alfarache,” Robert K. Fritz studies the particularly important role that the sense of taste, in light of historical and contemporary theories of cognition, plays on both narrative and rhetorical levels in Mateo Alemán’s picaresque masterpiece (Part One, 1599; Part Two, 1604). This cognitive historicist essay relates the aspects of flavour perception to\n\n8\n\nRyan D. Giles and Steven Wagschal\n\na divisive topic in the critical literature regarding Alemán’s novel, namely, whether or not it primarily promotes a Post-Tridentine Catholic world view or is instead about the ultimate impossibility of redemption from the rogue’s sinful origins. Applying principles of embodied cognition from George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (1999), alongside Patrick Hogan’s notion of the downward projection of neurobiological structure (2003), Fritz argues that gustatory metaphors in Guzmán de Alfarache reflect the process of evaluative conditioning by which the brain flavour system learns flavour preferences and aversions. These metaphors contribute to the articulation of a Christian message of redemption by implying that innate hedonic reactions can be conditioned and reconditioned to favour either virtue or vice, suggesting that through the exercise of free will and the aid of divine grace, human sinfulness can be redeemed. In this section’s final essay, “The Aesthetics of Disgust in Miguel de Cervantes and María de Zayas,” Steven Wagschal explores early modern notions of disgust in the work of royal physician Luis Lobera de Avila (1480–1551) and that of earliermentioned humanist Joan Lluis Vives (1492–1540) as well as current thinking on the emotion in philosophical aesthetics (Korsmeyer 2011) and cognitive studies (D. Kelly 2011). He compares techniques associated with the evocation of disgust in Cervantes’s Don Quixote, The Persiles, and other works and in three novellas by María de Zayas. Wagschal analyses, from a cognitive historicist perspective, the association among certain sensory perceptions (often involving foul smells), the evocation of the emotion of disgust, and constructed social categories in the writing of these authors. He explains how these two literary authors employ a range of disgust elicitors, including bad breath and rotting flesh, but do so quite differently. Despite often employing similar literary techniques, Cervantes and Zayas typify two divergent approaches to the elicitation of aesthetic disgust in the reader. Processes of early modern sensorial effects on human and social bodies lead to questions that are focused more on the relationship between individual experiences of hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting, as well as on understanding the inner life of the mind and the cultivation of inner desires in Renaissance and early modern culture. Such questions are addressed in Part III, “Perception,” which explores the representation of direct sensory perception, with an emphasis on the connection between perceiving and emotional states. In the first of these essays, “Sight, Sound, Scent, and Sense: Reading the Cancionero de Palacio,” E. Michael Gerli studies imagery that accompanies a lyric poem in this early Renaissance manuscript. The verses of “Contrast d’amor” (Contrast of Love) metaphorically convey the tempestuousness or storminess of a love affair and include a polychrome, richly historiated capital L in the form of a unicorn. Gerli finds that, for an audience schooled in the lore of the unicorn, it is evident that there is an entirely different, olfactory dimension meant to be elicited when\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nthe verse is combined with this image of a mythical beast that can be tamed only by the scent of a virgin. As he shows, medieval schoolmen described this attraction as an excess of warm humours dilating the heart and the nasal passages of the unicorn. Perceiving the rich aroma that emanates from between the virgin’s thighs, the animal is overcome with pleasure and lays its head upon her lap, fading into a blissful sleep. The illustration calls to mind the material emanations of the female body, whose fragrant sway cannot tame the violent winds of love that continue to beleaguer the speaking voice in the poem. The illustrations of the Cancionero de Palacio thus helped amplify the cognitive universe of its readers, opening up new understandings that transcended the written word and materiality of the text alone. Subsequent essays in the section turn from this fascinating, but lesser-known, songbook to ways of understanding problems with perception in learned and popular medical literature that was more widely circulated in early modern Spain. In “Treating Sensory Ailments in Early Modern Domestic Literature,” Carolyn A. Nadeau considers the question of what happens when one or more of the physical senses ceases to function as it should. If any of the senses was damaged, how would the loss be treated in order to restore harmony between the physiological and the psychological? This essay addresses these questions by considering the ongoing debate in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries between those who followed traditional Galenism and those who considered more innovative Galenic practices. Nadeau finds that the latter approach, espoused by physicians serving in the courts of Charles V and Philip II, began to base their principles on observation and followed the new anatomy and clinical approaches to better understand concepts of health and sensory perception. The essay then turns from medical treatises to prescriptive domestic literature from late fifteenth- to early sixteenth-century Spain as it seeks to understand strategies for maintaining the physical faculties and for curing sensory deprivation brought on by injury or illness. These works approach the higher and lower senses in different ways: for sight and hearing, remedies are curative and treat the individual only after a problem has occurred; touch and taste are both curative and, more often than not, preventative. Nadeau also examines the ingredients used in these remedies in order to understand the connections between the material world and the human body and, in doing so, to contextualize academic and popular approaches to natural medicine and the physical senses from the period. In the next essay, “Cervantes’s Exemplary Sensorium, or the Skinny on La española inglesa,” Charles Victor Ganelin identifies sensory perceptions and depletions as a central preoccupation in Cervantes’s Novelas ejemplares. He points out how characters cannot be fully comprehended without consideration of the senses at play, as evidenced by descriptions of clothing, which are accorded far greater detail\n\n10\n\nRyan D. Giles and Steven Wagschal\n\nthan the people wearing them. The richness of garments seduces the eye, but also compels touch, with texture almost crossing the threshold between text and reader. Similarly, sight cannot prove identity, but neither can sound; only touch against the skin can provide assurances. Throughout the novellas Ganelin locates qualifying statements that action will be carried out by all five senses, yet frequently only one of them is the deciding factor, working in conjunction with perceptiveness. This essay explores how the Novelas ejemplares demonstrate a sensorium reflective of the multivalent role that the senses played across the arts and, of course, in the wider conception of early modern representation. Cervantes’s ingenious sensorium holds a new mirror up to nature and questions old ways of social control and culture formation. This essay shows how the Novelas ejemplares clamour for a pervasive need to understand the senses, the language used to evoke them, and the cultural manifestations that call them forth. Cervantes, of course, lived during a time of imperial, transatlantic ambitions on the Iberian Peninsula – ambitions and expectations that had been conditioned by earlier legends of empire, as well as contact with the indigenous peoples of the Americas; exotic sensory experiences and performances; impressions of pungent, bustling ports, and new, distant, urban spaces. Contributions in Part IV, “Sensing Empire,” investigate the phenomena of widening, even global sensory realms, as writers imaginatively perceived and evoked smells and tastes in new ways. Its essays examine the vibrant role that sensual descriptions play in imperial aspirations and colonial encounters, from a prescriptive medieval account musing on Alexander the Great’s conquests to much later accounts of colonizers in which the sounds of indigenous and African identities seem to drown out the privileged visual descriptors of Europeans. Emily Francomano’s “The Senses of Empire and the Scents of Babylon in the Libro de Alexandre” shows how this thirteenth-century classic work explores the rich allegorical possibilities of Babylon as a multivalent biblical figura and creates a synaesthetic ekphrasis of the city as part of its poetic integument. Francomano examines the poet’s continual appeals to the senses, finding that the description of Babylon is the most sensual and rhetorically synaesthetic episode of the Alexandre: the poet’s audience is invited not just to see its majestic architecture, healthy and well-dressed inhabitants, and the abundant gems and worldly goods traded there, but also to listen to its birdsong and minstrels, to smell the plethora of spices ground in its mills, and to taste and feel the salubrious water streaming from its fountains. Moreover, this essay demonstrates how the synaesthetic ekphrasis of Babylon extends beyond the five corporeal senses to appeal to the inner, rational senses of Alexandre’s audience, while also inviting its audience to consider the relationships between sensory perception and allegorical sense in the poem’s meditation upon the rise and fall of Alexander the Great.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nIn “Portuguese Scenes of the Senses, Medieval and Early Modern,” Josiah Blackmore next examines a selection of testimonies of sensorial delight in Portuguese writings from the medieval through early modern periods. He begins with a contemplation on speech as one of the “senses of the mouth,” to follow C.M. Woolgar’s formulation in a well-known letter on the finding of Brazil by the Portuguese scribe Pero Vaz de Caminha (c. 1500). The essay looks at how coastal and maritime realms are privileged, idyllic scenes of sensorial experience and plenitude, and how a Portuguese imaginary related to water and nautical movement evolves from medieval lyric to early modern maritime imperial expansion, culminating in the work of Portuguese Renaissance poet Luís de Camões (c.1524–80). Blackmore’s work turns up unexpected and profoundly revealing links between touch and the workings of the heart and mind, as well as between carnal union and an early modern, maritime gnosis of an expanding globe-space. Henry Berlin’s essay, “Eucharistic Thought and Imperial Longing in Portugal from Amadeus da Silva’s Apocalypsis Nova (1502) to António Vieira’s História do Futuro (1663–1667),” begins by examining a part of Amadeus da Silva’s important Apocalypsis Nova (1502) that deals with the Eucharist. In this text he seeks to explain how the metaphysics underlying the Angel Gabriel’s account of the Eucharist is deeply relevant to the millenarian perspective of the Apocalypsis. If the work as a whole is structured by the question of presence and absence, this part of the text analyses the ability or inability to perceive real divine presence in the Eucharist – questions raised, in part, by what is felt, smelled, tasted, and heard during the sacrament. Despite Christ’s real corporeal presence, the accidents of the bread and wine are, Gabriel explains, theologically necessary conventional signs – mediated perceptions that, until Christ’s final return and the end of the world, are viewed in the perspective of Portugal’s imperial fortunes. Berlin’s study then turns to António Vieira’s unfinished, but influential História do Futuro (c. 1663–7), in which Vieira predicts the advent of a new, glorious era of Portuguese history. During this “Fifth Empire,” Christ will return, exerting not just spiritual but temporal control over the entire globe through Portugal’s kings. In this way the essay explains how ideas in these texts about the Portuguese empire’s place in sacred time and history relate to theological notions of Christ’s bodily being made sensorially present in the Eucharist and in the end of days. The book then moves from the stakes of maritime exploration of the known world, to indigenous and colonial Portuguese cultural encounters in America. Lisa B. Voigt’s “Festive Soundscapes in Colonial Potosí and Minas Gerais” demonstrates how musical performances in the context of public festivals were intended not only to produce sonic harmony but also to represent religious harmony, piety, and order. Specifically, Voigt focuses on the music, drumming, and other sounds represented in eighteenth-century accounts of ceremonial entries, which describe\n\n12\n\nRyan D. Giles and Steven Wagschal\n\nthe entry of the archbishop into Potosí on his way to Lima and festivities surrounding the entry of the bishop into a new diocese created in the mining region of Minas Gerais. The essay highlights the representations of subaltern musical performance – Indians in Potosí, blacks in Mariana – as well as the instances of cacophony and sonic disharmony. Music (and festivals) may have been understood as an effective means of indoctrinating and acculturating those who were new to the Catholic faith, whether indigenous or African, but the instruments, tunes, and rhythms of musical performances in festivals echoed other traditions and identities and served other goals. Furthermore, these examples point to the importance of attending to the soundscapes of festivals, even when the accounts that describe them emphasize their visual dimensions. Finally, Part V, “Sensing the Urban,” turns to the Old World to explore representations of increasingly overloaded senses in the early modern court and city. In “Celestial Visions and Demonic Touch: García’s Inventions in La verdad sospechosa Frederick A. de Armas examines the many falsehoods and fabrications in the play that are replete with images that evoke the senses. As the stories are heard, characters listening would be struck not just by the visual, but also by the tactile elements. Thus, hearing, sight, and touch are manipulated so as to make the lies seem tangible, while smell and taste also appear at times to buttress the other three. The wondrous materiality of García’s imagined scenes evokes the saturation of all five senses in the urban spaces of seventeenth-century Spain. At court, newness was avidly sought and the senses became overloaded, risking an imbalance of the humours and illness caused by excessive input, which might in turn affect the senses. The connective link between inventions, the senses, the four humours, and the four elements, de Armas argues, allows the audience to understand García’s excessive, mendacious and sensory fabrications. The element of fire, connected to García’s choleric disposition, exacerbates his imagination and leads him to trick and deceive. As de Armas shows, it also leads him to imagine fiery things, from the stars in the heavens to the more demonic fires of gunpowder. His verbal magic seduces through hearing and creates wonderment; while it seeks to show the brilliance of the sky and of his mind, it also hides the anxieties of a cosmos that no longer conforms to ancient authorities and a self that wills to turn away from sight to the lower senses. As de Armas shows, through the magic of his voice he can instil a desire for the lowest of senses and, although he claims to desire a celestial being, García hides his cravings for forbidden touch. In the final essay of the collection, Enrique García Santo-Tomás’s “Motherhood Interrupted: Sensing Birth in Early Modern Spanish Literature” asks why childbirth became a pivotal tool for early modern Spanish writers, as he engages in a sustained dialogue between the history of medical practices and literature that evoked all of the senses. García Santo-Tomás examines the changing history of the use of female and male midwives and the reliance on wet nurses as symptomatic\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nof the role of men in baroque society. He examines images of birthing in an urban milieu – as Iberian cities like Madrid and Seville experienced a demographic explosion throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries – focusing in particular on works by Cervantes, Alonso Jerónimo de Salas Barbadillo, and Francisco Santos. The essay finds that mothers of all guises, in fact, abound in the cultural representations of baroque Spain, but when motherhood is reflected, sensory experiences and their stakes are always problematic and reveal tensions related to the masculinization of women’s medicine. Santo-Tomás explores fictional accounts of sensing and perceiving scenes of parturition that reveal the fruitful potential of a type of image that, surprisingly, has received little attention. This meditation on sensory meanings attached to childbirth in early modern Iberia brings to a close the volume’s broadly conceived collection of essays. As the sections and chapter summaries attest, this collection approaches literary and cultural representations of the senses over the longue durée and through the expansive spaces of Iberian empires, real and imagined. Essays delve deeply into the smells and tastes of holiness and the sacred, disease and corruption, and premodern approaches to interpreting and allegorizing exotic and dangerous sensory experiences, when nothing less than salvation is at stake. The pages that follow provide insights into the significance of other senses in late medieval manuscript culture and into the role of sensory cognition in the creation of moral character during the early modern period. Also explored are failures and treatments of the nose and ears, the aesthetic, literary possibilities of disgust, and connections between the skin and tactility with religious, political, and gender identities in the creation of fiction. No less important in the chapters of this volume are wilful sensory deceptions in both Old and New World contexts, senses of communion and musicality as imperial conceptions of control and resistance, sensual experiences and representations of maritime exploration, and the birth and rebirth of baroque cultural productions. While they are divided into five sections, there is necessarily a significant overlap between and among the essays. Indeed, while the scope of this project might appear quixotically ambitious in temporal, spatial and thematic terms, we are confident that the results have broken new ground in the interdisciplinary study of the senses that extend beyond sight.\n\nNOTES 1 Citations are made by the month and day (in that order) given for entries in Adams’s diary and autobiography. 2 For instance, Mark Smith, Sensing the Past: Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, and Touching in History (Berkeley: U of California P, 2007); Stephen G.

Dogs indeed have far superior olfactory perception than humans in what, according to recent scientific literature, is referred to as “orthonasal olfaction,” which is what most lay people generally refer to as “smelling” or “sniffing.” In this regard some dogs can detect odours in a small fraction of the substance concentration compared with humans – hence the use of dogs, for instance, to sniff out illicit substances such as drugs or explosives. However, humans are more discerning than dogs at a particular kind of smelling, which is known as “retronasal olfaction” and is a kind of olfaction that importantly forms part of the experience of taste or flavour (see G. Shepherd 19–27). There is still some scientific debate on the relative strengths of human orthonasal olfaction versus that of other animals. In “Mechanisms of Scent-tracking in Humans” Jess Porter et al. tested whether humans would be able to perform “scent-tracking” in an open field in the way that dogs and other macrosmatic animals can, and they found that humans are able to do so and that they improve with practice over time. The two species were tested on different substances (chocolate for humans, pheasants for dogs), and while the research found that humans can scent-track, the paper refers to dogs as having “greater scent-tracking ability.” For instance, in Thomas de Cantimpré’s Liber de naturis rerum, the five senses are symbolized by a lynx (vision), a boar (hearing), a monkey (taste), a vulture (smell), and a spider (touch) (4,I,194; qtd in Nordenfalk 1).

GILES\n\nThe Mocedades de Rodrigo, concerning the youthful deeds of the Castilian hero later known as the Cid, is a mid-fourteenth-century poem that draws on epic traditions that are also present in earlier chronicles. It has been preserved in a single manuscript and has received increasing attention over the years from prominent scholars. Both Alan Deyermond and Samuel Armistead, for example, published important studies of the Mocedades that have shed light on its composition and purpose. These and other critics have been particularly interested in the existence of an earlier, oral gesta and also have considered how the Mocedades seems to promote the late medieval diocese of Palencia.1 Although most Hispanomedievalists are well acquainted with the story told in the Mocedades, this prequel to the classic Cantar de mío Cid may be less familiar to other scholars. The narrative first recounts the genealogy of the hero, who descends from the first nobles of Castile. Because the version that has been preserved was adapted by a Palencian cleric, it adds an account of how heroic Castilians played a role in the founding and supporting this diocese. We are then told how, at an early age, Rodrigo kills his father’s enemy. To re-establish peace the king orders him to marry the victim’s daughter, Jimena. Rodrigo’s initial refusal to fulfil this obligation sets the stage for a series of battles in which the young warrior defeats Christian and Moorish foes on the Peninsula and beyond the Pyrenees.2 One of the least understood episodes in the poem comes after Rodrigo completes his pilgrimage to Santiago, just before a victorious duel and followed by further military action.3 Travelling in cold, rainy weather, the young warrior and his 300 knights encounter a leprous beggar, who asks for help crossing the Duero. Although his knights express their disgust, spitting and backing away from the leper (“todos escopían e ívanse d’él arredrando”) (v. 638), Rodrigo takes the stranger by the hand, covers him with a green cape, and carries the sick man across the river Duero on a mule. The two then take refuge under a rocky outcrop\n\n18\n\nRyan D. Giles\n\nnear the riverbank and, after falling asleep next to the beggar, Rodrigo experiences a prophetic dream.4 The ailing leper, his diseased state described as being a “malato” and “gapho,” speaks in Rodrigo’s ear, identifying himself as St Lazarus, sent by Christ to “blow” a “fever” into him (a “resollo” and “calentura”) and in doing so assures the hero’s victory in battle (vv. 644–5, 649). Apart from a possible association with the life of Martin of Tours or other, similar legends, Deyermond observes that, by the end of the thirteenth century the Cid was accredited with the founding of a Palencian church and leprosarium dedicated to Lazarus. This saint was viewed by medieval Christians as a healed leper and protector of those who suffered from this disease.5 Armistead compares the leper’s breath to the epic tradition of heroes’ feeling the heat of battle fury, and both scholars consider further details found in the early fourteenth-century Crónica de los reyes de Castilla, which seems to have incorporated a traditional gesta concerning the Cid’s youth.6 Here, Rodrigo also is said to have shared food with the leprous beggar, and he asks the figure of Lazarus, who appears before him in white “vestiduras […] ‘¿quién eres tú que tal claridat e tal olor traes?’” (clothing […] “who are you that is so bright and has such a smell”) (Montaner 155).7 My purpose in this essay is to consider how differing sensory perceptions and experiences of the disease, in particular what Rodrigo refers to as “tal olor,” can shed further light on the meaning of the episode. Specifically, I will show how the repellent, feverish flesh and breath of the leper challenged medieval Christians to reconfigure their senses and thereby perceive the fragrance of their Saviour’s redeeming Passion. My findings build on the work of scholars such as John K. Walsh and Geoffrey West, who have shown how hagiographic rhetoric influenced epic writing in medieval Spain. At the same time we will see how being divinely chosen to suffer from the contagious disease was associated with a tradition of monastic knights’ taking up and dying for the Cross as they waged war against the enemies of Christendom. Not only was the premodern leper seen through and defined by a status of exclusion that Michel Foucault famously described as a manifestation of divine punishment and grace (5–7), the outcast’s significance in the medieval imaginary was at the same time dependent on potentially blessed, corporal interactions with non-lepers that often revolved around perceptions of and reactions to his smell. The evocation of “tal olor” in the Mocedades can be interpreted in at least two different ways. On the one hand it might allude to the saintly smell of resurrection in keeping with the Gospel story of Lazarus of Bethany, and on the other it could suggest the residual odour of the leper as the living dead. The fragrance of sanctity was often compared to honey, flowers, a sweet smell of herbs emanating from the tomb of virtuous Christians.8 Of course, just as the senses enable the human being to perceive a sign of transcendence, they were also employed by the Devil to lead\n\nThe Breath of Lazarus in the Mocedades de Rodrigo\n\n19\n\nthe sons of Adam into sin. Whereas all Rodrigo’s men are repulsed by the wretched beggar, the hero’s acts of charity seem to have enabled him to discern the sweet fragrance of holiness. According to medieval preachers, the nose was just as likely to deceive sinners as the eyes. For instance, Jacques de Vitry tells the story of an attractive, perfumed youth who was perceived by angels to be giving off a spiritual stench as a result of his sins (Beriou and Touati 123–4). Yet the reek of a corpse left behind by a redeemed soul went unnoticed by the same celestial beings. During the Mass incense was used as an olfactory symbol of prayer ascending to heaven, giving a foretaste of the fragrance of the divine.9 Christ’s anointed body was accordingly described as emitting a perfume, or what Walter Mapp describes as “an odor of sweetness that drew the heart to it” (Rawcliffe 134). On the other hand, foul bodily smells, and specifically the reek of the leper’s diseased flesh and breath – apparently provoking Rodrigo’s knights to spit and back away – were linked with the sulphurous torments of Hell and the demonic misuse of the senses.10 In some cases, the leper or leprosarium could even represent the collective guilt of humanity, an idea that is expressed in the popular and influential twelfth-century Policratus, where John of Salisbury speaks of a “general leprosy that affects us all” (46). Therefore, the revulsion of Rodrigo’s 300 knights could speak to a more generalized culpability or propensity to sin. They prove unable to overcome their sensory repulsion, much less to recognize their own spiritual leprousness or associate themselves with the suffering of another. In fact, the disease and associated bad smells were especially linked with hypocrisy.11 Jesus exposed those who boastfully praised God as stinking hypocrites, bearing the stench of the tomb. This attitude can be seen in illustrations of the personified Church holding her nose (see Rawcliffe 123).12 Comparable iconography can be found in depictions of Lazarus being summoned by Christ from the tomb while awaiting figures hold their noses as if they still expected him to emerge as a decomposed cadaver, in keeping with Martha’s warning that her brother’s body has been entombed long enough to smell (John 11.39). Late medieval manuscript illuminations include onlookers – sometimes identifiable as Jews, merchants, or Christian sinners – covering their noses as the cadaver somehow emerges from the tomb. In this case their gesture of disgust appears to suggest that they are tempted to disbelieve, and so they fail to overcome the misleading, instinctual reaction of the body’s senses. Such onlookers are prevented from perceiving the spiritually purified smell of Lazarus risen from the dead. They rely solely on exterior senses, as opposed to the soul’s sensory transcendence of death and decay, being revealed – paradoxically – through the corruptible matter of Lazarus’s body, in accordance with Carolyn Walker Bynum’s recent study Christian Materiality.\n\n20\n\nRyan D. Giles\n\nFigure 1.1 The Raising of Lazarus. Fifteenth-century French prayer book. Heures de RolinLévis, à l’usage de Paris, fol. 222v, detail. Photo credit, Erich Lessing / Art Resource.\n\nThe Breath of Lazarus in the Mocedades de Rodrigo\n\n21\n\nUndoubtedly, these connotations are implicated in the leper’s self-identification in Mocedades as Lazarus, the messenger of Christ, as well as the reaction of Rodrigo’s men. Medievals imagined Martha’s brother to have died of leprosy before having his life miraculously restored and rising from the grave in a white shroud (sometimes resembling bandages) with his flesh purified, in accordance with the “vestiduras blancas” (white clothing) depicted in the Crónica de Castilla. This event seems to influence Rodrigo’s story insofar as the beggar lies down with his host as a sufferer of leprosy, but arises from his sleep free of the disease. The figure was conflated in hagiography with another character from the Gospels, Lazarus the beggar, who, like Job, is afflicted with a disease that rots his skin and leaves him covered with sores. In Christ’s parable the beggar sits outside the gates of a rich man, but is denied charity (Luke 16.19–31). In the next life, he will be welcomed into heaven, whereas the avaricious are condemned to the depths of Hell. Thus, Rodrigo’s pious display illustrates an awareness of the eternal danger inherent in refusing to care for the sick, especially lepers. Ironically, the infernal destination of uncharitable sinners was imagined as reeking of bodily decay – in other words, smelling like a medieval leprosarium (cf. note 10). This very real odour was caused by the patients’ festering lesions (both oral and on their extremities); dirty bandages; the foul, stagnant water in which they bathed; in addition to the spoiled food that was often donated to them. Like Job, lepers who lived a righteous existence of atonement could attain a state of grace, since God had marked and elected them to undergo a redeeming trial. In recent years this phenomenon has been studied in depth by Carole Rawcliffe, who has brought together an abundance of relevant primary sources. For example, she discusses a popular sermon by Jacques de Vitry, called “Ad lepros et alios infirmos” (To Lepers and Others Who Are Sick), that recalls the ten lepers healed by Jesus, associating them with the Decalogue, as a Christianizing fulfilment of Mosaic law (57).13 Following this logic, the single leper cured after the Sermon on the Mount (Mark 1.40) was thought to represent Adam, whose inherited Original Sin could be healed in the body of the Church. For this reason, sermons urged Christians to go to confession “as soon as they detected the first symptoms of spiritual leprosy,” so they might return from the state of isolation that Hugh of St Victor called the “leprosy of vice” and “the contagion of sins, as by leprosy” (Rawcliffe 127). Christ’s curing of lepers in the Gospels was also reimagined in new miracle stories. According to one, a pious leper entered the empty basilica of St Denis to pray, lamenting that “nobody will dare to speak to me, because I have polluted breath” (Rawcliffe 114). Reminiscent of the leper in the later Mocedades, his breath is revealed instead to be especially efficacious when Jesus recognizes the purity of his prayer and immediately heals him.\n\n22\n\nRyan D. Giles\n\nOnce again, this episode can be compared to Job’s reeking skin being miraculously healed by God. The long-suffering Old Testament patriarch, who suffered from leprosy, according to medieval lore, was widely known through Gregory the Great’s Moralia in Job.14 Medieval writers cultivated a topic of Christus quasi leprosus, partly on the basis of their interpretation of Job’s misery as a prefiguration of the Passion. The idea of “Christ-as-leper” first emerged from St Jerome’s translation of a verse in Isaiah thought to prophesize the coming of Christ: “Surely he hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows: and we have thought him as it were a leper [quasi leprosum]” (53.4). As Rawcliffe has pointed out, this tradition linked the lacerated skin of the leper to wounds inflicted on the Saviour’s body (62).15 We will see how it further illuminates the significance of Lazarus’s being identified as a direct messenger of Jesus in the Mocedades. Notable examples of the quasi leprosus topic include a sermon by Gregory the Great that urges believers to perceive Christ’s presence in the sight and smell of the leper’s body: “what can be more abject in the flesh of man than the flesh of the leper, harrowed by swollen sores and suffused with nauseous exhalations? But see that he has appeared in the aspect of a leper; and He who is revered above all has not scorned to appear despised beneath all” (Rawcliffe 63).16 It has been shown how Rodrigo’s men fail to understand the hero’s charitable actions towards a stinking “gafo” in Mocedades story. Their misperception can be implicitly extended to the auditory realm. Lepers typically carried rattles, bells, or clappers to attract almsgivers, producing a sound that would have warned of their presence and at the same time caught the attention of Rodrigo and his knights when the “malato” begs for “piedad” (mercy) (vv. 636–7). The confinement of lepers during the Middle Ages was at times incomplete and sporadic and could be enforced with “laxity,” to the extent that sufferers (some of whom were imposters) could be seen and heard begging outside populated areas (Magner 126).17 In fact, medieval preachers may have employed lepers’ noisemakers as an auditory reminder intended to move their listeners to compassion for these and other sick Christians, who had been divinely chosen to serve as symbols of Christ’s suffering.18 In this way sensory appeals could be used to negotiate and reinforce what Barbara Rosenwein has called “emotional communities,” which included the “dead and the living” (62). It is also significant that the appearance of the beggar in the Mocedades seems to represent the interests of a leper house that, as Deyermond has shown, was probably attached to the parish of “San Lázaro” in Palencia and, according to a fourteenth-century legend, had been founded by the Cid.19 Being isolated in the leprosarium, similar to monks in a monastery, medieval lepers often combined the mortification that characterized their disease with a requirement of strict prayer regimes. They were seen as undergoing a sort of purgatory on earth, or sacrificing themselves through a living death. Visions of Purgatory from the period often\n\nThe Breath of Lazarus in the Mocedades de Rodrigo\n\n23\n\nindicate a reek that emanates from souls’ being purified. The hideous condition and repugnant smell of lepers was thought to free them from the seductions of beauty and sensuous living, what Bernard of Clairvaux calls a “divine gift” (Rawcliffe 55). Thus, the odour in the Mocedades legend, comparable to Lazarus pungently emerging from the tomb, could be interpreted as a blessedly foul smell or a stench that is sweetened by redemption through Christ. Such an olfactory reinterpretation was certainly a challenge. Sources from the period frequently describe the stomach-turning smell of leprosaria and other places where lepers gathered. For example, a legend collected in the fourteenth-century Fioretti di San Francesco (Little Flowers of St Francis), features a leper who warns “I will that you wash me all over, for I stink so foully that I cannot abide myself,” before being cured by the saint (Boeckl 84–5). These leprosaria were located outside the city walls, typically near water sources for bathing, not unlike the place where Rodrigo first encounters the “gafo” on banks of the Duero. In some cases, rotten meat and fish, as well as rancid lard were sent to the lepers as an act of charity, since their malodorous flesh was, in the words of Rawcliffe, “already riddled with the disease,” making them supposedly “able to eat it with impunity” (79). Visitors sought to imitate the saints by carrying out acts of mercy and sometimes they experienced sensory miracles. They were challenged to approach olfactory perception in Pauline terms – in other words, to smell their surroundings by means of the spirit as opposed to merely the flesh.20 I would suggest that “tal olor” together with the leper’s “resollo” in the Mocedades and Crónica could evoke just this kind of reimagining discernment of a sanctified fragrance in the breath of the “gafo.” These meanings did not escape later writers who drew on medieval legends of the Cid’s youth, building on accounts preserved in romances or ballads in addition to historiographic sources. In the early seventeenth-century play Las Mocedades de Rodrigo Guillén de Castro wrote a scene in which the hero’s charity for the leper broadly alludes to the tradition of saints such as those I have been discussing. While his soldiers react with repulsion (“‘asco tengo’ […] ‘vomitar querría’”) to the sickly “gafo,” Rodrigo prayerfully commends the power and heavenly fragrance of Lazarus’s breath: “¡Qué olor tan dulce y suave / dexó su divino aliento!” (163–4).21 Saints were said to have patiently overcome the repulsion caused by this stinking illness and thereby illustrated virtue and holiness, as in the lives of Elizabeth and the canonized bishop, Hugh of Lincoln, both of whom humbled themselves to wash the ulcerated feet of lepers. According to legend, the latter was even able to kiss leprous flesh, in the tradition of St Martin, since the “sweet perfume of Christ” made him “impervious to the vile odours that made others retch” (Rawcliffe 135).22 An insistence on artificially disguising bad smells was, at the same time, on occasion described as a “sin of the nose,” indicative of a refusal to attend to the sick and poor due to their stench. Such sinners instead chose to delight in\n\n24\n\nRyan D. Giles\n\nthe scents of perfumed flesh, ripe fruits, and other olfactory temptations of this world. The lepers themselves, or materials that had come into contact with them, such as wash water or bed linens, are described as smelling noxious to sinners but sweet to the saints, since holiness made their noses especially sensitive to inner truth. Hagiographers imagined them detecting a lingering fragrance of Christ, in spite of an exterior perception of lepers as overwhelmingly foul smelling.23 It has already been noted how St Martin, patron saint of soldiers, exemplified “heroic compassion” for a beggar as well as a leper who inspired disgust in others (Rawcliffe 144). On St Louis’s visits to leprosaria, the crusader personally brought food, like Rodrigo insisting on sharing food with the leper in the Crónica (Gaposchkin 44, 200). Some legends reflect the topic of Christus quasi leprosus and involve anagnorisis, in which a sufferer of the disease is revealed to be Jesus. In other words, the leper is recognized not just as pious or saintly, as in the case of the messenger Lazarus in Mocedades, but as the Son of God. Examples include Gregory the Great’s life of the holy monk known as Martyrius, and the better-known case of Francis of Assisi, who resolved to become a mendicant after recognizing a leprous beggar as Christ (Gobry 40). This convention follows a form of anagnorisis first used in the Gospels, when disciples recognize a stranger (peregrino) as the resurrected Christ, after breaking bread with Him (Luke 24.13–35). Importantly, medieval visitors to the leper hospitals were also challenged to overcome fears of contagion, as they spiritually recalibrated their senses to perceive Jesus dying for their sins in the bodies of the sick. From the standpoint of premodern medicine the leper’s smell was believed to have potentially deleterious effects on the body’s humours. By the mid-thirteenth century physicians influenced by Arab science proposed that a miasmic smell exhaled and otherwise emanating from the sick could enter the body as airborne particles and cause contagion.24 Such pollution could be counteracted by fumigation, for instance, the burning of aromatic plants, a practice thought to offer medicinal and protective effects against different kinds of illness, including the plague.25 The humoral imbalance or dicrasia of leprosy was primarily the result of a choleric “adustion,” causing the body to overheat like a furnace with an abundance of poison that could not be sufficiently expelled through exhalation and other forms of elimination (Rawcliffe 72). Putrefaction would take place, as it were, from the inside out, due to an unexpelled excess of black choler spreading its burning malignancy. This theory was heavily influenced by the Canon of Avicenna, which was translated in Toledo during the twelfth century by Gerard of Cremona and cautioned doctors to avoid “air corrupted … because of proximity to lepers” (Rawcliffe 92). Once again, odours were crucial to the contagion of disease, since they could transmit pathological bodily qualities through the air: “whereas clean and bracing air invigorated the entire body, promoting a sense of happiness and equilibrium, noxious vapours […] had\n\nThe Breath of Lazarus in the Mocedades de Rodrigo\n\n25\n\nthe opposite effect” (Rawcliffe 91). Although acceptance of a miasmic transmission of leprosy can be traced back to the mid-thirteenth century, Galen had already warned that the breath of ill patients was dangerous to physicians. Similarly, early Muslim physicians like the ninth-century Ibn Qutayba cautioned that “the leper gives off an odour so strong that it causes anyone who long remains in his presence or eats with him to fall ill” (Rawcliffe 92). Thus, inherent in the feverish heat of the breath of the “gafo” – the calentura of the resollo – is a contagious smell of disease and death. Yet this air will not sicken Rodrigo, but rather fortifies him, presumably as a result of his charitable acts and saintly recognition of the leper’s true olor as that of the body’s resurrection. For medieval audiences the fever given to Rodrigo also could be expected to confer a kind of fierceness in battle, as Armistead suggests. Lazarus was not only the protector of lepers, but also the patron saint of a knightly and monastic order that sponsored hospitals in Jerusalem and Acre as well as leprosaria throughout western Europe.26 It was founded by a first wave of crusaders who had contracted the disease in significant numbers and has been studied most thoroughly by David Marcombe. The seal of the order fittingly displays a priestly figure holding a cross – perhaps indicative of notions of Christ’s wounded body on the cross as quasi leprosus – together with a leper holding a rattle, his face covered with lesions (Marcombe 5). Knights of the order took up the cross by deploying their repulsive condition as a sort of pious weapon to fight against the Saracens, a militant imitation of Christ as “the most despised and rejected of men” (Marcombe 8).27 Their hospitals in the Holy Land, not unlike those in Europe, not only were places of quarantined separation – due to the disgust lepers inspired, and growing fears of contagion – but also functioned somewhat like a monastery, to the extent that brothers wore tonsures and habits and committed themselves to a regimen of communal prayer, following the Augustinian rite. The first masters were inspired by the example of a saintly monk named Alberic, who had taken a vow of poverty and dedicated his life to lepers at the newly founded Jerusalem hospital. Dressed like John the Baptist, “clad in a goat-hair shirt and wearing his hair and beard in an outlandish style,” Alberic was known to engage in public self-flagellation as a means of drumming up charity for the leprosarium (Marcombe 8–9). He purportedly fed himself on the leftovers of lepers, made their soiled beds, carried the most crippled among them on his back like St Christopher, and – similar to other holy workers – made a habit of kissing their flesh. In the Mocedades and Crónica we have seen how Rodrigo engages in comparable, though less extreme, acts of mercy by carrying the leper across the river and eating and lying down with him. According to Gerard of Nazareth’s account, Alberic also washed their feet with water that he carried to the hospital. The buckets became “mixed with blood and discharge,” but he\n\n26\n\nRyan D. Giles\n\novercame his initial reaction of “nausea” by immersing “his face and, horrible to say” drinking large quantites of the disgusting fluid (Marcombe 9).28 This pious legend, written in the twelfth century, seems to have influenced a tale by Juan Manuel in which a leprous nobleman decides to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. His vassals become nauseous from washing his sores, but then prove their loyalty by drinking “daquella agua que estava llena de podre et de pustuellas que salían de las llagas” (from that putrid water that was full of pus coming from his lesions) (229–30). After first spitting in disgust like Rodrigo’s men, they become remorseful and imbibe the polluted water. The legend of Alberic can also be compared to a scene in another fourteenth-century text, the Vita of Catherine of Siena, composed by the Dominican Raymundus de Vineis. Not unlike the loyal vassals in the Conde Lucanor, Catherine was said to have imbibed the pus from a nun’s cancerous breast. Like the saintly monk whose story seems to have inspired Juan Manuel, she does this as a means of overcoming her worldly disgust having received a vision in which she is nourished from the wound in Christ’s side. From the standpoint of audiences, as well as participants in this sort of medieval piety, their initial reaction of disgust could be made to yield a greater pleasure. As Carolyn Korsmeyer puts in in her transhistorical study of the aesthetics of aversion: “the conversion of the disgusting into the delicious. Certain encounters with what we might consider particularly profound eating transform an initially aversive experience into something significant and savorable” (72). Scholars have pointed out that, like the count in Juan Manuel’s story, aristocratic lepers in the Order of St Lazarus – many of them former Templars – continued to enjoy the privileges of their elevated class, in spite of their repugnant affliction.29 Numerous sources speak of diseased warriors from the order continuing to fight and die in large numbers, in hopes of preserving Christian rule over the Holy Land during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, in what has been called: “a last line of defence […] the ‘living dead’ mobilised in a desperate attempt to ward off the inroads of the infidel […] moulded by notions of chivalry and the special relationship between God and his chosen sufferers” (Marcombe 13).30 This context helps explain how the hot breath of the leper revealed to be Lazarus in the Mocedades becomes linked with Rodrigo’s readiness for battle against his enemies, comprising Saracens as well as tyrannical Christians. While the leper’s seemingly ambiguous odour is feared to be contagious by his knights, in accordance with contemporary medical theories, the young Cid follows the example of saints and crusaders who drew on the model of Christus quasi leprosus to wage spiritual as well as military battles. This story shows not only how the young Cid’s characterization draws on hagiographic conventions, but more important, how his epic persona can be understood in the context of an emotional, sensory community of warrior saints and redeemed sinners. The long-standing topic of the leper,\n\nThe Breath of Lazarus in the Mocedades de Rodrigo\n\n27\n\nwhich has concerned me in this study, encouraged believers to follow Christ by conquering the stench of sin and death through the Passion and Resurrection of His anointed, sweetly fragrant flesh. Medieval Christians contemplated the meaning of leprosy in hopes of overcoming the pungency of sin and decomposition, by breathing in the sweet olor of transcendent renewal through the resurrection of the material body. Just as Paul and the Church Fathers urged believers to follow the spirit as opposed to what was understood as the dead letter of the law inscribed in the flesh, medieval Christians who sought to imitate the saints were expected to perceive life in what their carnal senses told them was the oppressive and seemingly inescapable smell of death.\n\nNOTES 1 The manuscript is housed at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (ms. Español 12). In recent years Leonardo Funes has completed a critical edition of the poem, and Matthew Bailey has edited a volume of essays as well as a bilingual edition. Citations and translations are from Bailey’s edition. 2 Before the text abruptly ends the young hero makes an excursion north and defeats the French in battle, humiliating their king by refusing to pay tribute and even standing in opposition to the Holy Roman Emperor and the pope. 3 This duel with a count settles the question of whether Calahorra belongs to Aragon or Castile. 4 The topic of supernatural dreams and visions is, of course, characteristic of medieval epic as a whole and can be compared to the visit of the angel Gabriel in the Cantar de mío Cid. 5 Deyermond first links him to the monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña through the Cantar and later to the Diocese of Palencia in the Mocedades. He notes parallels with the life of St Martin, the patron of soldiers, who famously offered half of his cape to a beggar, and was also said to have healed a leper. Deyermond views the episode as a product of pseudo-hagiographic traditions attached to the young Cid. See also John K. Walsh’s classic study of the cult of saints and other religious expressions in the Spanish epic. 6 Armistead discusses accounts of heroic fevers written in Old English, Gaelic, and Germanic, comparing these to the power of the hot breath of Lazarus in this episode – and later in the narrative, when Rodrigo asks for a wine sop to hasten the return of the “calentura” promised to empower him in combat. The critic compares this to a late medieval romance, known as “La fuga del rey Marsín,” in which another character experiences what is described as psychosomatic “corajes” (furies), prior to going to battle against the Moors – a condition not unlike the battle fury that overcomes heroes in earlier traditions (72–3).\n\n28\n\nRyan D. Giles\n\n7 Alberto Montaner has studied different versions of the story and includes an appendix of primary texts. This retelling was later copied in the Crónica general de España de 1344 (see Armistead 69). As Deyermond puts it, Rodrigo’s devotion is “in marked contrast to his behaviour in most of the poem, but the contrast is even more marked if we recall the fear and horror with which leprosy was viewed in the Middle Ages” (“Epic” 113). On the other hand, as Armistead points out, “se miraba como un acto de piedad destacada y de lo más ejemplar” (was seen as a marked act of piety and especially exemplary) (72). 8 In hagiography this fragrance is often encountered when the incorrupt saint is being interred or exhumed. Examples of smelling holiness can be found in Berceo’s Milagros de Nuestra Señora: the flowery scent coming from this Marian devotee’s mouth (112c) recalls the poet’s earlier vision of paradise in his famous introduction (3a). A later instance of a delicious, heavenly smell defying death occurs in Alfonso X’s Estoria de España, when the Cid is visited by St Peter (634). Rebeca Sanmartín has studied later representations of the bodies of visionary Spanish women, even in death, exuding a pleasant fragrance (chap. 1). 9 In pilgrimage centres, including Santiago de Compostela, censers would be used to cover the odour of the many, often sickly, unwashed, and impoverished visitors, and represent the therapeutic holiness of the place and the sweet presence of Christ and the apostle entombed there. The meaning attached to incense hearkened back to the traditional offerings of the three kings, which according to the medieval play, Auto de los reyes magos, represented celestial kingship (Surtz 13–18). 10 Such corrupted air is vividly described in the early fourteenth-century infernal Visión de Filiberto: “connortosos olores […] creo que non te huele ahora tan bien […] acabando su vida en pecado mortal et en los viçios e plazeres del mundo […] atápanse […] como de cosa que fiede muy mal […] él que ayer era bivo ya podreçe” (pleasurable smells […] I believe now do not smell so good […] finishing their life in mortal sin and in the vices and pleasures of the world […] they cover themselves […] as if from something that reeks very badly […] he that was alive yesterday is already rotting) (Octavio de Toledo 52, 59–60). In keeping with other interpretations of bad smell, the Visión also links this stench with the mouth speaking fallen words as a result of Original Sin. My translation. 11 The sweet fragrance of hypocrisy and mortality are compared to the smell of a rotting apple in the Libro de buen amor: “El amor sienpre fabla mentiroso […] lo que semeja non es […] las mançanas […] más ante pudren que otra, pero dan buen olor” (love always speaks mendaciously […] it is not what it seems […] applies rot sooner than other [fruit] […] but are pleasantly fragrant) (sts 161–4). My translation. 12 Accordingly, leprous sores and lesions were likened by Isidore of Seville and Gregory the Great to “heresy that defiled the body of the Church” (Rawcliffe 111). The truly devoted were thought of as making offerings to God that emitted a pleasant scent, even if others found them to be foul smelling.\n\nThe Breath of Lazarus in the Mocedades de Rodrigo\n\n29\n\n13 The sermon exegetically refers to the impure status of Old Testament lepers’ being purified by the New Convenant. 14 On Job’s status as a patron saint of lepers, see the study by Lawrence Besserman. In Spain, during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, Pero López de Ayala translated and reworked parts of the Gregorian gloss into Castilian. 15 In fact, when tending to lepers, the religious sometimes imagined themselves imitating the Virgin Mary caring for the crucified body of her Son (142). 16 An even better-known example can be found in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, when the Parson cautions that treating deformed lepers with scorn constitutes an assault on Christ (308). 17 As Lois Magner points out, they could also be found in public places, including markets, sounding their noisemakers, exchanging money, after pointing to objects they wished to purchase (in order to avoid spreading contamination through their mouth) (126). An example of a phony leper using the expectation of charity to dupe a nobleman and his knights can be found in the thirteenth-century romance concerning an outlaw named Eustace the Monk (see Kelly, Knight, and Olgren 680). 18 The voices of lepers were typically ruined by the disease. Eventually, the course of the disease could not only render them mute, but destroy their capability for sensory perception by afflicting the eyes, nose, and ears, not to mention crippled hands denoted by the Spanish word “gafo” used in the Mocedades. The sound of the rattle the leper still managed to clutch must have signalled a kind of living, breathing memento mori. 19 Deyermond observes that the current location of the Gothic St Lazarus parish in Palencia would have been outside of the city during the later Middle Ages, not far from a branch of the Camino de Santiago – although no river is nearby (“Epic” 112). 20 For example, the arrival of Theobald of Champaign at a leprosarium was said to have transformed the scent in the air from a reek to a sweet smell (Woolgar 128). 21 An ecclesiastical contemporary of the dramatist, Alonso de Villegas, commented on the smell of Lazarus in his Flos sanctorum, linking Martha’s initial anticipation of and sensitivity to the “mal olor” with those who are overly scrupulous and overreact to the perceived faults of others: “dan mil arcadas, hazen ascos y melindres” (they retch a thousand times, are revolted and peevish) (5). 22 Other men and women also aspired to holiness by kissing leprous flesh, for example, in the life of St Matilda told in the Chronica majora of Matthew Paris (Huneycutt 104–5). 23 The holy, though often depicted as particularly sensitive to smells, were seen as protected from the repelling effects of foul odour, as if their presence and closeness to Christ had filled the air with a smell of spices or incense, powerful enough to cover the polluted reek of those being nursed in the leprosarium.\n\n30\n\nRyan D. Giles\n\n24 This danger is discussed in the Siete Partidas (no. 4.2.7), with regard to marital relationships in which one partner has contracted leprosy and moves into a leprosarium, warning that close contact can lead to contagion. In the case of unrepentant lepers, their smell could potentially compromise the state of the soul – for as one medieval preacher warns, “leprosy makes the soul spiritually very foul” (Rawcliffe 46). 25 This strategy of warding off miasmic contamination was perhaps most famously employed by the pope in Avignon when the Black Plague struck in the midfourteenth century. 26 A leper hospital was established in the newly conquered city of Jerusalem, through a land grant given in 1142 (Marcombe 7). 27 The order included knights – often noblemen from the Templars – who were officially required to join the Order of St Lazarus by 1260 after they had contracted leprosy in the East. The most famous leper of the crusader period is the Christian king of Jerusalem, Baldwin IV. Importantly, the order also included healthy sponsors and attendants (see Marcombe 11; Rawcliffe 54). The Third and Fourth Lateran Councils restricted lepers from living in proximity to the healthy, and it is likely that sick and healthy brothers remained in separate quarters (Boeckl 48–9). The green colour of the order might even be conveyed in the Mocedades by the sharing of Rodrigo’s “capa verde” (green cape) (v. 640). 28 The hospital in the Holy City was located on a road that led from the Mount of Olives to the River Jordan. Thus, the spectacle of monastic lepers and the seemingly grotesque charity of their devotees would have been witnessed by a large number of travellers, to include wealthy and even royal sponsors such as Almalric I, as well as regular almsgivers. The hospital was re-established outside the city walls of Acre, after Jerusalem was retaken by Muslim forces in 1187 (Marcombe 11). 29 “A knight suffering from leprosy remained a knight and his scars and spots did not bring him any closer to other lepers of common birth” (Marcombe 11). 30 The last remaining leprous warriors in Acre died in battle when the sultan of Cairo attacked the city in 1291. By this time the order had moved most of its operations into leper houses in France and elsewhere in western Europe (see the first chapter of Marcombe’s study). It is even possible that members were involved in the early founding and endowment of what Deyermond conjectures to be a hospital of “San Lázaro” in Palencia, documented after the fall of Acre. The establishment of this leprosarium was soon after attributed to the Cid, as mentioned earlier.\n\n2 Sabrosa olor: The Role of Olfaction and Smells in Berceo’s Milagros de Nuestra Señora VÍCTOR RODRÍGUEZ - PEREIRA\n\nGonzalo de Berceo (1196–1259) was a cleric from the area near the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla, located within what is now the autonomous community of La Rioja (northern Spain), where he was probably born, and most certainly was raised. In addition to several clerical positions he held in the monastery of San Millán, Berceo was also a prolific writer whose vernacular works consisted of five lives of saints, three poems written in honour of Holy Mary, one poem about Mass, and another about signs that would be seen in the End Times. Although the range of his writing is substantial, Berceo’s most popular work today is the Milagros de Nuestra Señora (Miracles of Our Lady) (c. 1246–52), a collection of miracles performed by the Virgin Mary, most of them taken from known Latin sources. As one would expect, the bibliography about the Milagros is broad in scope and extensive. Most studies have focused on the linguistic aspects of Berceo’s poetry in addition to his literary or rhetorical sources, biographical information about the author, and the place of the Milagros in the development of Marian tradition throughout thirteenth-century Europe. However, less attention has been given to Berceo’s use of sensory images, or issues concerning the senses in medieval culture and how this context relates to the works of the Riojan poet. One critic who considered aspects of this was Joaquín Artiles, who listed and commented on references to sensory images in a large number of passages from all of Berceo’s works. Though Artiles identifies references to the senses and images related to the five senses, he argued that vision is the most prominent of the senses within Berceo’s poetry. Moreover, when listing colour images found throughout Berceo’s poems, Artiles argued that Berceo’s use of colour lies in a middle point between the almost entire absence of colours in the Cantar de Mio Cid (Song of my Cid) (c. 1195–1207), and the “cromatismo del Libro de Alexandre” (the chromatics of the Book of Alexander) (c. first half of the thirteenth century) (151).\n\n32 Victor Rodríguez-Pereira\n\nAnother literary device discussed by Artiles, related to visual images, is that of synaesthesia. The term has been used mainly to describe a neurological human phenomenon in which stimulations of a sensory organ lead to experiences through another sense. For instance, it manifests itself in some people through a vivid association between numbers and colours. However, literary intersections of sensory images could be the product of an author’s perception and experience of the world, or an artistic resource intended to stress an idea or image so as to make it have a deeper impact on the works’ audience. Examples can be found in Berceo’s work, especially when he refers to the smells as “sabrosa olor” (flavourful smell), or “dulce olor” (sweet smell) (Artiles 157). In addition, Artiles lists instances in Berceo’s work in which images pertaining to different senses overlap, grouping them in four clusters: taste-sound, taste-smell, taste-visual, and taste-touch images (159–60). Though Artiles’s comprehensive work enumerates many of these images in the works of Berceo, he does not engage in a more thorough study of their deeper implications or connections between the poetry and the author’s cultural context. In his work, examples of images pertaining to the other senses, such as smell, touch, and hearing, are not fully explored by the author. In these pages I will study the role of olfactory imagery in Berceo’s Milagros in relation to ways of understanding the senses among medieval thinkers and the use of sensory images in hagiographic narratives. In my view Berceo’s use of olfactory images not only fulfils an aesthetic or artistic purpose, but also sheds light on the role of saints and Holy Mary as intercessors between God and humanity. Medieval thinkers like Thomas Aquinas pointed out that olfaction is a problematic sense, and he placed it in an intermediate point between vision and touch or taste. Ultimately, the sweet smell of saints and Mary that Berceo explores in his poetry points to the broader place of mester de clerecía (the cleric’s craft) poetry in thirteenth-century culture. Medieval attitudes towards sensory perception were anticipated, to a certain extent, by writers of late antiquity, who often made a connection between good smells and what is morally correct, and between foul smells and the opposite. This connection was often transferred to other areas of society, and often smells functioned as social markers, indicating an individual’s social class. Foul smells frequently were linked with foot soldiers, peasants, and the homeless, while pleasant fragrances were associated with the wealthy (Classen, Howes, and Synnott 33). Moreover, smells were also important in areas that we would find surprising today, such as warfare. For example, incense was commonly used to indicate surrender in Roman times, a tradition that probably gave us the common idea of the “smell of victory” (Classen, Howes, and Synnott 39). And, of course, smells were an integral part of social gatherings and events, such as banquets rich in different fragrances, and perhaps were used to counter the foul smells of improvised bathrooms placed\n\nSabrosa olor\n\n33\n\naround the rooms in a tradition that dates as far back as Pliny’s Historia Naturalis (Natural History) (Classen, Howes, and Synnott 14).1 Although some ancient approaches to smells persisted during the Middle Ages, Christianity during these centuries seemed to have a much more problematic relationship with olfaction. Christian conceptions of sin and evil, as they are linked to corporeality and the material, created anxieties about the body and everything that was remotely sensorial, an attitude that was particularly prevalent during the development of early medieval monasticism. Overpowering passions and desires entailed a kind of denial of the body, insofar as the senses could provide pathways to sin through it. Moreover, in certain cases like that of count Gerald of Aurillac, medieval asceticism entailed a constant cleansing of all bodily fluids, especially those provoked by “nocturnal illusions,” in order to keep the body clean of all visual and olfactory traces of sin (Odo of Cluny 123). Earlier Christians had even eschewed the use of incense for cultic purposes, since it had formed part of pagan temple rituals. Incense had also been used to pay tribute to deified emperors, a highly political custom that might have seemed outrageous to early Christians. Thus, during the first centuries of Christianity the practice of burning incense in religious ceremonies was forbidden. For Athenagoras and Justin Martyr, for example, the laws of the New Testament are specific: God requires only prayers, not physical offerings (Cuthbert and Atchley 81–2). Moreover, for other Church figures, such as Tertullian and Origen, using incense was a non-Christian practice that originated among the peoples of the Arabian Peninsula and should be rejected (Cuthbert and Atchley 83–4). Although the Magi were believed to have brought an offering of incense to the infant Christ, as a symbol of his divinity, the Gospels do not describe this gift being burned as part of their worship of the new Saviour. Nevertheless, Christianity eventually absorbed the practice of burning incense, and after the sixth century incense became widely popular in churches, allowing the potentially unpleasant smells of worshippers and pilgrims to be masked and offset. Fragrances also had practical and even medical uses during medieval times, perhaps motivated by beliefs concerning the pernicious qualities of certain smells for the human body. The links between fragrances and smelling and sustaining the human body had precedents dating back to ancient writers such as Pliny, who located in India a race called the Astomoi who could live for long periods of time “only on the air they breath and the scent they inhale through their nostrils” (7.26). The idea that fragrances could feed the body helped shape the belief that aromatic smells were thought to protect against diseases, and the belief that foul smells could cause them. For this reason, during the plague burning certain aromatic trees and herbs such as juniper and rosemary was customarily recommended to protect against contagion. In addition, doctors recommended\n\n34 Victor Rodríguez-Pereira\n\ncovering the nose with a pouch containing a mix of fragrant herbs or plants and, if nothing else, carrying an apple that one could smell while walking through infected areas (Ziegler 73). At the same time fragrant smells were used to cure more minor or common illnesses and conditions such as headaches, upset stomach, or gynecological cramping. Some medieval medical literature even recommended placing aromatized vapours around a woman’s genitalia in order to make a displaced uterus move back to its appropriate location (Classen, Howes, and Synnott 126). However, this was not the only approach to the senses, and specifically olfaction, during the Middle Ages. Alongside practical and medicinal uses of fragrances, Christian theology developed a literature of the senses that reflects on the role of the bodily senses in the context of human salvation. There were two approaches to the senses in medieval spirituality as it relates to Berceo and by extension to other clerical writers of the period. One of these is embedded in theological discourses on the body, whereas the other is rooted in popular beliefs of sanctity. Thomas Aquinas (1225–74) exemplifies the first of these approaches through his explanation of the five senses as passive powers of the soul that need the body in order to abstract impressions of worldly phenomena. Yet some senses are more important or useful than others on account of their capacity for “spiritual immutation,” that is, their capacity to acquire knowledge of things in the world while enduring the least amount of physical change on the sensing organ and the object of sensation (Campbell 169). Thus, for Aquinas the primary sense is sight, whereas hearing and smell are paired and classified as intermediary, and touch and taste are the least important. The reason for Aquinas’s structure is that a sense is more useful in apprehending reality (and consequently conducive to knowledge of God) according to its proportion of spiritual and natural immutation. Natural immutation happens when a change is effected in either the sensing organ or the object sensed. Consequently, according to Aquinas’s reasoning, sight is the most useful sense precisely because there is no transmutation in the eye, for example, upon seeing a colour (Aquinas I.78.3).2 Sight is followed by hearing and smell because the latter entail a natural change in the object sensed, but not in the sensing organ. That is, a natural process occurs in the object that emits the smell or sound, but no contact is necessary and therefore no natural change. Finally, Aquinas locates taste and touch at the bottom because of their pure materiality and need for contact, which leads to natural immutation in both the sensing object and the subject.3 For Aquinas a physical sense is more effective the less it needs natural immutation to facilitate knowledge of reality. This happens best when no physical change\n\nSabrosa olor\n\n35\n\nin the object or the subject takes place, thus making sight privileged, in the same way that the human soul seeks God not through physical contact but through immaterial contemplation. However, Aquinas does not study olfaction as succinctly as he does the other senses, perhaps on account of its problematic theological role. An example of the second type of Christian discourse of olfaction is exemplified by, among others, St Bonaventure in his account St Francis’s life, contained in the Legenda maior S. Francisci (The Greater Legend of St Francis) (c. 1260–3). In the fifth chapter of this text there are four episodes narrating miracles performed by the saint. Each sense-related miracle is clearly linked to the four properties of the body once reborn after physical death. In this way touch is linked with habitus (habit), taste with subtilitas (subtlety), hearing with agilitas (quickness), and sight with claritas (brightness). Yet the sense of smell is left out of this ascendant structure of the senses. Although one would be tempted to think that this meant the sense of olfaction was not important to St Bonaventure, chapter fifteen gives the sense of smell a much more prominent role, as it features the events of 1230, when St Francis’s body is exhumed and transported to another church. Much to everyone’s astonishment, the body of the saint is said to emit a sweet fragrance that draws believers to seek Christ: “ut per odorem salvificum affectus traheretur fidelium ad currendum post Christum” (so that through the redemptory smell the faithful would be drawn to run towards Christ) (Astell 127). The sweet smell of the saint’s corpse has the purpose of showing all believers God’s powers, so that they would seek Him more. Thus, smell becomes an intermediary agent that links humanity to sanctity. Smell also has a prominent redemptory function in another work by Bonaventure, the Itinerarium mentis Deum (Journey of the mind to God) (c. 1259). Unlike Aquinas’s seemingly troubled relationship with smell, for Bonaventure it is, in fact, an important sense because it helps the human faculty discretio (discernment) to distinguish between good and evil, echoing a similar comparison that had been around since pseudo-Denys, Hugh of St Victor (Astell 107). These examples show that Christianity had a more problematic relation with the “other senses,” such as smell, than with sight and hearing. Perhaps because of its ineffability, the impossibility of apprehending (or difficulty of preserving) smells, olfaction seemed to be more troubling for a religion that avoided the body, considered a path to perdition, as much as Christians praised it for its intellectual capacities. It is this concern for the usefulness, futility, and dangers of the senses with regard to the attainment or loss of salvation that characterizes Berceo’s Milagros. In the first part of the work the famous allegorical introduction, Berceo (or a “literary” version of himself that functions similarly to an Everyman) goes on a\n\n36 Victor Rodríguez-Pereira\n\npilgrimage until he finds a fragrant garden, following the medieval topic of the locus amoenus (delightful place): Yo maestro Gonçalvo de Verceo nomnado yendo en romería caesçí en un prado, verde e bien sencido, de flores bien poblado – logar cobdiçiaduero pora omne cansado. (st. 2) I, Master Gonzalo de Berceo, while on a pilgrimage happened to pause in a meadow green and untouched, full of flowers – a desirable place for a weary man.4\n\nThe garden overloads the reader with sensory images, most likely to convey the effects of this natural scenario in the human body to his listeners. A weary Berceo describes many fruits of different kinds that recall the sense of taste (st. 4), the delightful sounds of nature that the poet describes as “dulces e modulados” (sweet and modulated) (7), and a soft grass that recalls the sense of touch (11). However, two kinds of sensory images seem to be most important in this introduction and its relationship to the rest of the text: primarily olfactory images and, to a degree, gustatory images. The third stanza introduces the reader to the sense of smell through the description of flowers that emit a marvellous fragrance that “refrescavan en omne las carnes e las mientes” (they were refreshing to the spirit and to the body) (st. 3b). However, a fuller development of olfactory imagery comes in the fifth stanza: La verdura del prado, la olor de las flores las sombras de los árbores de temprados savores refrescáronme todo e perdí los sudores: podrié vevir el omne con aquellos olores. The greenness of the meadow, the fragrance of the flowers, the shade of the trees of soothing aromas refreshed me completely and I ceased to perspire: anyone could live with those fragrances.\n\nSmell here not only fulfils an olfactory function, but has alleviating and perhaps even palliative properties. Fragrances can sustain the body the way food does, but this is so because in introductory stanzas of the Milagros, much as in the medieval allegorical tradition, nothing is merely what it seems to be. This is the reason for\n\nSabrosa olor\n\n37\n\nBerceo’s warning to his audience in stanza 16: “palavra es oscura, esponerl"
