        "text": "Background:Novel variants of rice (Oryza sativa L.) can be obtained from induced mutations. The objective of the present study is to induce mutations in the background of Samba Mahsuri (BPT-5204), a popular and mega rice variety of India for creating novel variants for morphological, physiological and biotic stresses through using Ethyl Methane Sulphonate (EMS).Results: A population derived from 10, 500 M1 plants and their descendants was phenotyped for a wide range of traits leading to the identification of 124 mutants having variations in key agro-morphological traits, and 106 mutants exhibited variation for physiological traits. Higher yield is the ultimate goal of crop improvement and we identified 574 mutants having higher yield compared to wild type by having better yield attributing traits. Further, a total of fifty mutants showed better panicle exsertion phenotypes as compared to Samba Mahsuri leading to enhancement of yield. Upon rigorous screening for three major biotic st...\n\nClimate change resilient varieties are considered to be a long term solution to the yield loss brought about by certain phenomena caused by the changing climate. Abiotic stresses, such as drought, submergence and saline intrusions to rice field, are the most common climatechange related phenomena that cause yield losses in rice. Modern biotechnology tools, such as tissue culture and induced mutation by gamma radiation, are used in rice breeding to address this threat by enhancing genetic variability to improve plant architecture and phenotypic acceptability of rice cultivars with known tolerance to abiotic stresses but of poor phenotype. Tissue culture and gamma irradiation of submergence tolerant rice cultivar, Samba Mahsuri-Sub1 and saline tolerant, Pokkali, generated elite lines with improved phenotype and with retained abiotic stress tolerance. The study evaluated the field performance of the mutant lines in comparison with their respective wildtypes. The lines were evaluated fo...\n\nThe increase of yield potential in new rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties has been a major challenge for genetic improvement. The generation of mutants, followed by their characterization, constitutes a great possibility to isolate and select genes and genotypes that present agronomic traits of interest. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of chemical mutagen ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) on agronomic traits in 340 M3 families of rice derived from BRS Querência cultivar. Seeds from each family and the original genotype BRS Querência were sown in the experimental field, and the characters main panicle length, main panicle weight, main panicle grain weight, flag leaf width and plant height were evaluated. Data were subjected to analysis of variance (p ≤ 0.05), and a comparison of means was carried out by…\n\nUnderstanding agronomic traits at a genetic level enables the leveraging of this knowledge to produce crops that are more productive and resilient, have better quality and are adjusted for consumer preferences. In the last decade, rice has become a model to validate the function of specific genes, resulting in valuable but scattered information. Here, we aimed to identify particular genes in rice related to traits that can be targeted by different mutation techniques in the breeding of crops. We selected gain of function, misfunction, and specific mutations associated with phenotypes of agronomic interest. The review includes specific trait-related genes involved in domestication, stress, herbicide tolerance, pathogen resistance, grain number, quality, weight, plant structure, nitrogen use, and others. The information presented can be used for rice and crops with similar or homologous genes to breed crops that require improvement to achieve more sustainable production in challenging...\n\nRice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most important source of staple food to a major portion of human population. The production of rice is reduced by several kinds of biotic stresses. The main biotic stresses that severely hamper the rice production include viruses, bacteria fungi, nematodes and insects. Different conventional and modern biotechnological approaches have been implemented to combat the devastating effect of different biotic stresses on the rice production. Conventional approaches such as hybridisation have led to the development of stress-tolerant varieties. The modern biotechnological approaches such as geno-mics and transgenics have led to the identification of genes that confer tolerance to stresses followed by its insertion into the rice plants with the aim of decreasing the yield loss incurred by the different stresses. Mutagenesis, genomics and transgenic approaches have been very effective in developing varieties with improved tolerance to various stress factors. Here we review the creation of rice varieties with improved yield under different biotic stress, using mutagenesis, transgenics and genomics approaches.\n\nRice is a main source of food to millions of people across the world, and hence increase in its production/yield is vital to feed the rapidly growing population. However, the yield of rice is decreased to a large extent due to the adverse effects of several kinds of abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, heat stresses, etc. Different traditional and modern breeding approaches have been used to mitigate the damaging effects of different abiotic stresses on the rice production. Traditional breeding strategies such as hybridisation and selection have resulted in the development of few stress-tolerant varieties, but such strategies are laborious and time-consuming. The modern biotechnological approaches such as mutagenesis, transgenics and genomics have been effective in the identification, cloning and characterisation of genes that govern tolerance to different abiotic stresses. Insertion of such genes into the rice plants have decreased the yield loss caused by various abiotic stresses. Modern biotechnological tools have brought landmark achievements by developing varieties with enhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses. The role of mutagenesis, genomics and transgenic approaches in the creation of rice varieties with improved yield under different abiotic stress has been reviewed in this chapter.\n\nIn 2007, with the help of DBT, a research project to create mutant resources for functional genomics in rice was launched through a national initiative involving ICAR Genetically well-defined material is a prerequisite for functional genomics. Thus, the project aimed to generate EMS mutants in the background of an upland and short duration aus genotype, Nagina22, characterize the mutants and use them in crop improvement. As of now, nearly 85,000 rice M2 mutant populations have been created under the project. Based on field phenotyping, gain and or loss of function mutants for tolerance to herbicide spray, drought, salinity and resistance to rice leaf and panicle blast, sheath blight and high phosphorus (P) use efficiency under low P field have been identified. Notably, the herbicide-tolerant mutant identified is under the process of registration for distribution to public and private rice breeders under appropriate material transfer agreement. Besides this, the project also aims to serve as a 'National Repository of rice EMS mutant resource' for the researchers involved in rice biology and improvement in the country."
