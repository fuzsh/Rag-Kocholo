It's an FAS inhibitor. It'll block the melanocortin receptors of the perfume.\n\nFelix Lee: An antidote?\n\nDr. Jacob Hood: Just in case, OK?\n\nRenny Boyle: The designer wanted me to tell you that you should be wearing this.\n\nDior Model: What is it?\n\nRenny Boyle: It's called Fervor by Touchant. May I?\n\nDior Model: Yeah.\n\nRenny Boyle: [Lifts her hair and applies the perfume] It's gonna be the season's hottest fragrance.\n\nDior Model: Mmm. I like it.\n\nRenny Boyle: Yeah? Wait till you see the reaction on the crowd when they smell it. It's gonna be like nothing in this world."
