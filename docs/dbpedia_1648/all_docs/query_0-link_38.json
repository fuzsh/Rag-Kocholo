        "text": "Undersökningar i Germanisk Mytologi, första delen. Investigations into <strong>Germanic</strong> <strong>Mythology</strong>, Volume 1 by Viktor Rydberg IV. THE MYTH IN REGARD TO THE LOWER WORLD. <strong>44</strong>. MIDDLE AGE SAGAS WITH ROOTS IN THE MYTH CONCERNING THE LOWER WORLD. ERIK VIDFORLI'S SAGA. Among the Scandinavians far down in Christian times, the idea prevailed that their heathen ancestors had believed in the existence of a place of joy, from which sorrow, pain, blemishes, age, sickness, and death were excluded. This place of joy was called Ódáinsakur, theacre-of-the-not-dead, Jörð lifandi manna, the earth of living men. 1 It was not situated in heaven but below, either on the surface of the earth or in the lower world, but it was separated from the lands inhabited by men in such a way that it was exceeding perilous, although not impossible, to come there. A saga from the fourteenth century 2 incorporated in Flateyjarbók, and with a few textual modifications in Fornaldarsögur Norðurlanda, tells the following: Erik, the son of a petty Norse king, one Christmas Eve, made the vow to seek out Odainsakur, and the fame of it spread over all Norway. In company with a Danish prince, who also was named Erik, he proceeded first to Mikligard (Constantinople), where the king engaged the young men in his service, and was greatly benefited by their warlike skill. One day, the king talked with the Norwegian Erik about religion, and the result was that the latter surrendered the faith of his ancestors and accepted baptism. He told his royal teacher of the vow he had taken to find Odinsakur, - \"frá honum heyrði vér sagt á voru landi,\" - and asked him if he knew where it was situated. The king believed that Odainsakur was identical with Paradise, and said it lies in the East beyond the farthest boundaries of India, but that no one was able to get there because it was enclosed by a wall of fire, which reaches up to heaven itself. Still Erik was bound by his vow, and with his Danish namesake he set out on his journey, after the king had instructed them as well as he was able in regard to the way, and had given them a letter of recommendation to the authorities and princes through whose territories they had to pass. They travelled through Syria and the immense and wonderful India, and came to a dark country where the stars are seen all day long. After having traversed its deep forests, they saw a river when it began to grow light, over which there was a vaulted stone bridge. On the other side of the river, there was a plain from which came sweet fragrance. Erik conjectured that the river was the one called Pison by the king in Mikligard, and which has its source in Paradise. On the stone bridge lay a dragon with his mouth agape. The Danish prince advised that they return, for he considered it impossible to conquer the dragon or to pass it. But the Norwegian Erik seized one of his men with one hand, 1 er heiðnir menn kalla Ódáinsakr, en kristnir menn jörð lifandi manna eða Paradísum, \"that the heathen people call Odainsakur, but Christian people the land of living men or Paradise\" Eireks saga víðförla. 2 Eireks saga Víðförla"
