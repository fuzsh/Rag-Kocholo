        "text": "A pig slaughter happens every year at the old folks’ place in Osoblaha. It’s the only day of the year when the whole family gathers to rejoice, complain, eat, drink, and just live. But this year is different because Grandpa is unsure how to tell his son-in-law Karel that this will be the last slaughter. Karel’s daughter Romana misses her mother and her sister Lucie’s marriage is falling apart. Lucie’s son Dušan is lost in the clashes of the female and male worlds, Uncle Šupina is already drunk, the butcher Tonda is hiding the fact that his bullets are damp and the neighbor is plotting revenge on everyone for his miserable life. Throughout such a day, the resilience of mutual bonds is tested, revealing the strength and fragility of relationships formed by traditions, love, and grievances.\n\nCast / Karel Martinec , Miloslav Čížek , Pavlína Balner , Aleš Bílík , Albert Čuba , Karin Bilíková Writer / Adam Martinec DoP / David Hofmann Editor / Matěj Sláma Sound / Miki Kocáb , Peter Hilčanský Music / Jonatán Pastirčák Costumes / Zuzana Formánková Make-Up / Lucie Holubová Set Designer / Aneta Grňáková\n\nPhotogallery"
