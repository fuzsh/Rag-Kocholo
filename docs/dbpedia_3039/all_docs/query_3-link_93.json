        "text": "South Australian environment authorities are investigating claims feral pigs are being brought from as far away as New South Wales and released on the Limestone Coast.\n\nThe Limestone Coast Landscape Board (LCLB) said in August that it had eradicated three populations of feral pigs in the region in the preceding 18 months.\n\nBoard officers at the time believed the pigs were deliberately released, with subsequent investigations confirming two were deliberate and the cause of the third was unclear.\n\nLCLB operations manager Mike Stevens said the board was looking into reports members of the public were moving the pigs into the area from interstate.\n\n\"Feral pigs have a significant multi-million-dollar impact to the economy, the environment and pose a significant biosecurity threat as well,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether those animals are to establish populations for hunting or for personal use and they've got away from people, we're uncertain.\n\nThe latest investigations found one of the populations had been illegally released on a remote part of a property without the owner's consent.\n\nInvestigators believed the pigs had been on the property for up to three years before they were found and reported to the landscape board.\n\nAnother population was made up of two pregnant females, which officers believed were linked to recent deliberate releases in south-west Victoria.\n\nMr Stevens said the evidence so far meant it was far more probable they were moved and released by people and did not migrate to the area naturally.\n\nDeliberate releases 'despicable'\n\nInvasive Species Council of Australia advocacy manager Jack Hough said the suspected illegal releases were \"selfish\" acts that jeopardised South Australia's good position when it came to feral pigs.\n\n\"Across Australia we know one of the ways feral animals have been established in new areas is by deliberate transfer and deliberate release by hunters,\" he said.\n\n\"But it's not the only way they spread, and I think that's an important thing for us to keep in mind here.\"\n\nMr Gough added natural movement of feral pigs into SA was also likely to occur, meaning authorities needed to be ready to eradicate them quickly before they could establish in an area.\n\n\"These things will occur and the best way to keep on top of this is for the community to be very vigilant about feral pigs, and if they see feral pigs, the authorities are notified,\" he said.\n\n\"Also, the South Australian government needs to ensure the landscape boards, national parks and others have the resources to be able to respond really quickly, as occurred in this case.\""
