Facilities - The primary consideration for raptor housing facilities, whether indoors (mews) or outdoors (weathering area), is protection from the environment, predators, or undue disturbance. The applicant shall have the following facilities, which may be in the form of separate structures or an approved hybrid design fulfilling requirements of both:\n\n(i) Indoor facilities (mews) shall be large enough to allow easy access for caring for raptors housed in the facility. If more than one raptor is to be housed in the facility, the raptor shall be tethered or separated by partitions and the area for each bird shall be large enough to allow each bird to fully extend its wings. There shall be at least one window, protected on the inside by vertical bars, spaced narrower than the width of the bird's body and a secure door that can be easily closed. The floor of the mews shall permit easy cleaning and shall be well drained. Adequate perches shall be provided;\n\n(ii) Outdoor facilities (weathering area) shall be fenced and covered with netting or wire or roofed to protect the birds from disturbance and attack by predators. The enclosures shall be wide enough to ensure that the birds wings shall not strike the fence when flying from the perch. Protection from excessive sun, wind, and inclement weather shall be provided for each bird. Adequate perches shall be provided with at least one perch covered to protect a raptor from the weather.\n\n2.

Maintenance - All facilities and equipment shall be kept at or above the preceding standards at all times.\n\n4.

If that period of care will exceed 45 days, the permittee shall inform the Division's falconry permit administrator within three days of the transfer, of the reason for the transfer, where the birds are being held, who is caring for them, and approximately how many days they will be under the care of the second person.\n\n(k) Feathers that are molted or those feathers from birds held in captivity that die, may be retained and exchanged by permittees only for imping purposes. Feathers of golden eagles not retained for imping purposes shall be sent to the National Eagle Repository.\n\n(l) Non-transfer, interstate import and export conditions:\n\n1. Non-residents of the State which are permit holders from States which are recognized as falconry states by the Service may transport into Alabama raptors for personal falconry use (i.e. Falconry Meets, etc.) provided the laws and regulations concerning hunting and falconry are observed;\n\n2. Residents of the State who are falconry permittees may transport their raptors into other states which are recognized by the Service as falconry states for personal falconry use provided hunting and falconry laws and regulations are observed.\n\n3. This section does not prevent the importation, exportation, or exchange between permittees of legally acquired raptors taken from the wild or produced by captive propagation, if the permittees who import, export, or exchange raptors notify the Department in writing and as provided for elsewhere within these regulations.\n\n(m) Permittees holding the proper licenses may hunt, pursue and kill game birds and game animals during any of the established hunting seasons in accordance with existing regulations under the following provisions:\n\n1. Persons desiring to hunt with raptors must obtain proper hunting licenses along with proper falconry permits before attempting to take game birds and game animals;\n\n2. Persons hunting with raptors may hunt, pursue and kill game birds and game animals as follows:\n\n(i) Migratory game birds - during the gun seasons for birds pursued.\n\n(ii) Resident game birds and animals - from the opening date of the gun season for the species pursued through March 31.\n\n3. A permittee, whose hunting raptor accidentally kills game that is out of season or of the wrong species or sex, shall leave the dead quarry where it lies, except that the raptor may feed upon the quarry prior to leaving the site of the kill.\n\n4. Regular season bag limits for migratory game birds do not apply to falconry. Falconry bag limits shall not exceed 3 birds for all migratory game birds in the aggregate, whether or not an extended season is selected. Regular season bag limits for resident game birds and animals shall apply to falconry.\n\n(n) It shall be lawful for a nonresident to take or attempt to take raptors from the wild in Alabama, subject to the same restrictions and limitations as apply to resident permit holders, if the nonresident has a valid general or master level falconry permit from such person’s state of residence, a valid Alabama nonresident hunting license, and if such person’s state of residence provides the same privileges to residents of Alabama.\n\n(o) Violation of this regulation or federal regulation is just cause for revocation of permits by the Department.\n\nAuthor: Christopher M.
