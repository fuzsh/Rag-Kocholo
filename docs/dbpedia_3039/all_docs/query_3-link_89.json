        "text": "Pigs were brought from Europe to Australia by the First Fleet in 1788. Imported as livestock, pigs soon escaped and established wild populations that have expanded over time.\n\nIn 2021, it was estimated that Queensland had up to 2.3 million feral pigs. They are among Queensland's most widespread and damaging pest animals. Feral pigs spread invasive plants, degrade soil and water, prey on native species, damage crops and livestock, and carry diseases.\n\nA feral pig is a pig that lives in a wild state and is not being farmed or kept for another purpose. A pig is considered to be farmed or kept for another purpose only if it is in an escape-proof enclosure.\n\nYou can support a national feral pig mapping project by reporting feral pig populations.\n\nYou must manage the impacts of feral pigs on your land.\n\nYou must not move, feed, give away, sell or release feral pigs into the environment.\n\nLook out for signs of emergency animal diseases in feral pigs and report anything unusual to the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline on 1800 675 888 without delay."
