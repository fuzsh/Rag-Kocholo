        "text": "J.K. Rowling’s bestselling children’s book “The Christmas Pig” is set to get a film adaptation.\n\nVariety understands the project is in a very early stage of development in-house and a production company has not yet been attached.\n\nRowling’s production company Bronte already produces the BBC/HBO adaptation of her adult detective series “Cormoran Strike.”\n\n“The Christmas Pig” was first published in 2021 with illustrations by Jim Field. At the time of publication, Swift Films made a series of promotional videos for the project.\n\nThe book tells the story of a boy named Jack, who loses his childhood toy Dur Pig — nicknamed DP — on Christmas Eve after his stepsister throws it out of the family car. Although Jack is offered a replacement called Christmas Pig as consolation, he misses his old faithful friend and casts Christmas Pig (abbreviated to CP) aside.\n\nTo cheer Jack up, CP proposes a plan to rescue his best toy. The duo are shrunk down and sent to the Land of the Lost where they embark on a perilous journey to re-connect with DP. On the way they meet a cast of larger-than-life characters, including Santa Claus. Eventually Jack is able to come to terms with his loss and returns home to his bed with Christmas Pig.\n\nRowling has said she was inspired to write the book by her son’s twin toy pigs.\n\nThe author is best known for writing the “Harry Potter” series, which spans books, films, theme park attractions and consumer products. Last year it was confirmed that Warner, who made the original Harry Potter films as well as spinoff film franchise “Fantastic Beasts,” were developing a new television adaptation based on the original “Harry Potter” books.\n\nRowling has also written novels for adults including the “Cormoran Strike” series under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, which was first adapted for television in 2017. “Strike” stars Tom Burke as the eponymous private detective with Holliday Grainger as his business partner Robin Ellacott. A sixth season of the show is currently in production in the U.K.\n\nReps for Rowling declined to comment."
