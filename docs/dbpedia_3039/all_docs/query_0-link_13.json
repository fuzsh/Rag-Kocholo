        "text": "THE BAY OF PIGS INVASION/PLAYA GIRÓN\n\nA CHRONOLOGY of EVENTS\n\n1959\n\nJAN 1, 1959: The 26 of July Movement, led by Fidel Castro, succeeds in forcing General Fulgencio Batista into exile. Fidel Castro gives a victory speech from Santiago: this new revolution, he states, will not be like 1898, \"when the North Americans came and made themselves masters of our country.\"\n\nJAN 7, 1959: Washington officially recognizes the new government; in a memo to the President, John Foster Dulles states, The Provisional Government appears free from Communist taint and there are indications that it intends to pursue friendly relations with the United States. Early the next day, Castro's victory caravan finally reaches Havana, and the new regime takes charge.\n\nAPR 19, 1959: During Fidel Castro's first post revolution trip to Washington, he meets with Vice President Richard Nixon for three and a half hours. \"I spent as much time as I could trying to emphasize that he had the great gift of leadership, but that it was the responsibility of a leader not always to follow public opinion but to help to direct it in proper channels, not to give the people what they think they want at a time of emotional stress but to make them want what they ought to have,\" the Vice President reports in a four-page secret memo to Eisenhower, Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, and Allen Dulles. \"It was apparent that while he paid lip service to such institutions as freedom of speech, press and religion that his primary concern was with developing programs for economic progress.\" Nixon concludes that Castro is \"either incredibly naive about Communism or is under Communist discipline.\" But he also expresses his own appraisal of Castro as a man. The one fact we can be sure of, is that he has those indefinable qualities which make him a leader of men. Whatever we may think of him, he is going to be a great factor in the development of Cuba and very possibly in the development of Latin American affairs generally. (Richard M. Nixon, Rough Draft of Summary of Conversation Between the Vice President and Fidel Castro, April 25, 1959)\n\nJUL 8, 1959: A CIA briefing for the National Security Council reports on preparations in Cuba for efforts against Dominican Republic, either directly or through Haiti. (CIA, Briefing, Carribean Situation, July 8, 1959)\n\nSEP 4, 1959: Ambassador Bonsal meets with Fidel Castro in Cuba. The Ambassador expresses, our serious concern at the treatment being given American private interests in Cuba both agriculture and utilities. Castro responds saying he admires Americans, especially tourists, for whom he is planning great things. (Department of State Cable, [Ambassador Report on Meeting With Castro], September 4, 1959\n\nLATE OCTOBER 1959: President Eisenhower approves a program proposed by the Department of State, in agreement with the CIA, to support elements in Cuba opposed to the Castro government. The operations are intended to make Castro's downfall seem to be the result of his own mistakes. As a part of this program, Cuban exiles mount sea borne raids against Cuba from U.S. territory. (Wyden, pp.28-29; Gleijeses, p.3; Taylor Report, pp.3-4)\n\nFALL 1959: Manuel Artíme participates in a secret two-day meeting of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform in Havana. Numerous high officials of the revolution, including Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, attend the meeting. According to notes he takes on this \"unforgettable reunion\" - later published in his book Traicion - the discussion focuses on \"the true goals of the revolution.\" He quotes Castro as defining Democracy as \"this: a meeting of a group of men who know the road on which to take the people, that freely discuss the things they are going to do, having in their hands all the power of the State to do it.\" Castro also decides that the State will take possession of all land holdings, eliminating private property. At this point the campesinos will not be told of these plans, according to Artíme's notes. Artíme stresses that the leadership intends to deceive the Cuban public about the plans of the revolution.\n\nThe meeting of this \"criollo Kremlin,\" according to Artíme, provides the catalyst for the \"beginning of my rebellion.\" (Artíme, Traicion, pp. 3-16)\n\nNOV 1959: Manuel Artíme travels undercover to Mexico and makes contact with other Cuban exiles from the LAR in Mexico. A bible is used for coding messages. Dr. Lino Fernandez is asked to begin stockpiling weapons gathered by LAR and to create a network of internal security and intelligence. (Chronology of Irregular Forces)\n\nNOV 5, 1959: In a memorandum to President Eisenhower, Christian Herter describes the changing policy towards Cuba, All actions of the United States Government should be designed to encourage within Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America opposition to the extremist, anti-American course of the Castro regime. Herter adds, [However], in achieving this objective, the United States should avoid giving the impression of direct pressure or intervention against Castro, except where defense of legitimate United States interest is involved. (Department of State Memorandum, Current Basic United States Policy Toward Cuba, [Herter to Eisenhower], November 5, 1959)\n\nEARLY DEC, 1959: Rogelio Gonzalez Corso, Rafael Rivas Vazquez, Carlos Rodriguez Santana, Jorge Sotus and Sergio Sanjenis meet in Mexico and decide to create the Movimiento de Recuperación Revolutionaries (MRR), or Revolutionary Recovery Movement. They designate Angel Ros as secretary general of the new organization; he leaves for the United States to confer with Ricardo Lorie other Cuban exiles. (Chronology of Irregular Forces)\n\nDEC 11, 1959: J.C. King, head of the CIA's Western Division, writes a memorandum for Richard Bissell, and CIA Director, Allen Dulles stating that Castro has now established a dictatorship of the far left. The intelligence community estimates an increase in Cuban support for other revolutionary movements in Latin America, and \"rapid nationalization of the banks, industry and commerce\" sectors. The memorandum states that \"violent action\" is the only means of breaking Castro's grip on power, listing as the U.S. objective \"the overthrow of Castro within one year.\" King also recommends that \"thorough consideration be given to the elimination of Fidel Castro,\" marking the first time that the idea of assassination is committed to paper. (Cuban Problems, 12/11 /59)\n\n1960\n\nJAN 1960: The CIA sets up a Task Force WH-4, Branch 4 of the Western Hemisphere Division to implement President Eisenhower's request for an ambitious covert program to overthrow the Castro government.

(Informe Especial: 1960)\n\nJAN 25, 1960: President Eisenhower holds a conference to discuss the situation in Cuba. The President said that Castro begins to look like a madman. Ambassador Bonsal, also at the conference, adds, [Castro] is a very conspiratorial individual who tries to create the impression that he and Cuba are beleaguered. He is an extreme Leftist and is strongly anti-American.\n\nJAN 28, 1960: At four in the afternoon in the town of Chambas on the north coast, a Catalina plane drops incendiary bombs that fail to go off. The bombs have the inscription \"Bristo Marines.\" Another plane drops incendiary bombs on the cane fields in the refineries of Adelaida, Violeta, Patria, Punta Alegre, and Morón, in Camaguey; and Monati, Delicias, and Chapana, in Oriente. The incendiary devices dropped on the central Adelaide almost totally destroy 40 million \"arrobas\" [\"arroba\" = 25 pounds] of cane. (Informe Especial: 1960)\n\nJAN 29-31, 1960: A plane drops incendiary phosphorous bombs on 10 districts in the area of the Chapana refinery. Other bombing attacks take place on cane plantations in San Isidro and on houses in the Central Toledo in Havana.

(Informe Especial: 1960)\n\nFEB 1960: The Movimiento de Recuperación Revolucionaria - MRR - releases its \"Ideario\" of basic points. In the preamble, Manuel Artíme writes that MRR has been formed \"not only to overthrow Fidel Castro, but to permanently fight for an ideology of Christ; and for a reality of liberating our nation treacherously sold to the Communist International.\" Luis Boza prepares the document. (\"Ideario: Puntos Basicos.\")\n\nFEB 1-13, 1960: Planes drop bombs burning more than 17,000 arrobas of cane in Trinidad; and other bombing attacks take place in Punta Alegre, Camaguey province, against the Adelaide refinery, and in the central España. (Informe Especial: 1960)\n\nFEB 17, 1960: A CIA briefing to the National Security Council reports on the visit of Soviet official Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba. The USSR, it states, has shifted from cautious attitude to one of active support. The briefing also indicates that opposition to Castro is growing but that the anti-Castro groups both inside and outside the country lack organization and effective leadership. (CIA, Briefing, Cuba, February 17, 1960)\n\nFEB 18, 1960: A plane trying to bomb the central España, Matanzas province, explodes in mid-air.

(Gleijeses, p.6)\n\n-Rafael Rivas-Vasquez sends a confidential memorandum to Artíme on \"Propaganda and Psychological Warfare of the F.R.D. (Revolutionary Democratic Front) in Cuba.\" The goals, he writes is to make the F.R.D. known inside of Cuba, win over sectors of the country, and \"break the red power through creating a mystique [to oppose Communism] based on Christian principles and the democratic traditions of our people.\" Propaganda will be n and by radio. Psy-ops should include a \"campaign directed a demoralizing the military ...based in terror,\" a radio and flyer campaign to identify Castro's intelligence officials and Communist spies, promoting civic resistance, and spread the word about the resistance and its operations. Among the recommendations are to \"blow up\" Castro's radio station, the Voz del INRA, which is interfering with Radio Swans transmissions. \"Actions and sabotage, coordinated with written and radio propaganda ...give life to the slogans and civic resistance,\" Rivas Vasquez writes. (Propaganda y Guerra Psicológica 3/60)\n\nMAR 4-5, 1960: Sabotage of a French ship, La Coubre, in Havana harbor, carrying arms for Cuba, kills about 100 people and wounds some 300. The following day at funerals for the victims Fidel Castro accuses the United States of responsibility for the action. (Informe Especial: 1960)\n\nMID MARCH, 1960: The MRR's Miami-based secretary of propaganda, Rafael Rivas-Vasquez sends a memorandum to Manuel Artíme regarding methods of organizing resistance forces outside of Cuba. His suggestions include creating a Political Bureau, student movements, \"pro-democracy worker's fronts,\" drafting and distribution of a manifesto and pamphlet on MRR, and structuring various Executive Committees in Mexico, Venezuela and other countries in order to build an \"International Organization of Friends of a Free Cuba.\" (Algunas Sugerencias para el mejor funcionamiento en el Exilio ca. 3/13/60)\n\nMAR 17, 1960: At an Oval Office meeting with high-ranking national security officials, President Eisenhower approves a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) policy paper titled \"A Program of Covert Action Against the Castro Regime.\" The CIA plan involves four main courses of action: (i) form a moderate opposition group in exile whose slogan will be to restore the revolution which Castro has betrayed; (ii) create a medium wave radio station to broadcast into Cuba, probably on Swan Island, south of Cuba; (iii) create a covert intelligence and action organization within Cuba responsive to the orders and directions of the exile opposition; and (iv) begin training a para?military force outside Cuba and, in a second phase, train paramilitary cadres for immediate deployment into Cuba to organize, train and lead resistance forces recruited there.\n\nDuring the meeting, Eisenhower states that he knows of \"no better plan\" for dealing with this situation but is concerned about leakage and breach of security. He argues that everyone must be prepared to deny its existence and only two or three people should have contact with the groups involved, agitating Cubans to do most of what must be done. The President tells Mr. Dulles that he thinks he should go ahead with the plan and the operations but that \"our hand should not show in anything that is done.\" (Memorandum of Conference with the President, 3/18/60; CIA, A Program of Covert Action Against the Castro Regime, 3/16/60)\n\nMAR 20-21, 1960: Internal resistance forces destroy 400,000 arrobas of cane in the Cunagua central in Camaguey province.

In the first place so that they do not carry out aggression against us, and in second place, if they do, they will have to pay very dearly for their impudence and audacity in finding themselves on the soil of our country.\"\n\nThe following day, Castro warns, \"if there is an invasion, the war, they can be sure, will be to the death.\" (Informe Especial: 1960)\n\nLATE MARCH 1960: David Atlee Phillips, a CIA contract employee who until recently had maintained a public-relations company in Havana, is selected by the CIA as chief of propaganda for the Cuba project. At operation headquarters in Washington, Phillips is told that the Cuba project will go by the Guatemala scenario. (Phillips had performed the same function in PBSUCCESS, the 1954 operation against Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz. During the coup by a CIA?directed exile force, Phillips had operated a clandestine station supporting them.) CIA operative E. Howard Hunt, also a veteran of the Guatemala operation, is assigned the position of chief of political action for the project. His primary responsibility is to form a government-in-exile to replace Castro's government following the invasion. (Wyden, pp.20-22; Hunt, p.23)\n\nAPR 14, 1960: At a National Security Council meeting, Eisenhower administration officials weigh options for broadcasting propaganda into Cuba. U.S. Information Agency Director George Allen reports that USIA is considering establishing a Cuba?directed station in Florida and buying time on commercial stations there. Also under study is a proposal to fly an aircraft over Key West for the purpose of beaming television programs into Cuba. Meanwhile, Allen says, USIA's short?wave broadcasts to Cuba have been augmented. CIA Director Allen Dulles reports that \"some Cuban intellectuals [will] soon be broadcasting to Cuba from Boston at night, and that it is likely that a second radio station over which Cuban refugees might broadcast will be installed in five or six weeks.\" (NSC, Discussion of the 441st Meeting of the National Security Council, April 14, 1960.)\n\nMID APRIL 1960: David Phillips meets with the CIA official in charge of the Cuba operation, Deputy Director for Plans Richard Bissell. When Bissell asks how long it will take to create the proper psychological climate, Phillips says it will take about six months. Bissell directs the propaganda chief to have Radio Swan up and running in one month.\n\nOn Swan Island, a tiny, contested territory located about 100 miles off Honduras; the CIA begins construction of a 50?kilowatt medium?wave radio station. The island had served as a base for CIA broadcasting during the agency's successful campaign to oust Guatemala's President Arbenz, and some radio equipment used in that operation is still on the island. Phillips obtains a transmitter from the U. S. Army in Germany, which was preparing to make it available to the Voice of America. A detachment of Navy Seabees constructs a pier at Swan Island to facilitate the unloading of the equipment. (Phillips, pp.112, 114; Wyden, pp.22?

The document describes six major points of the MRR platform: respect for the dignity of the individual; firm devotion to representative democracy; unbreakable faith in the concept of private property and free markets; the development of capitalism; political pluralism; and the democratic credo against totalitarian communism. (MRR, Memorandum Personal y Confidencial, 4/25/60)\n\nMAY 1960: CIA operative Howard Hunt spends several days in Cuba on an undercover visit, during which he observes Cuban attitudes toward the revolutionary government and visits areas around revolution?controlled radio stations. After returning to Washington, he reports on his findings to his supervisors at the CIA and offers several recommendations, including a suggestion that the Agency destroy the Cuban radio and television transmitters before or coincident with the invasion: Hunt's recommendation is based on his belief that without radio and television to inform the country, Castro's heirs would be unable to rally mass support. . (Hunt, pp.36, 38)\n\nMAY 3, 1960: Fidel Castro proposes José Miró Cardona as new Cuban ambassador in the United States.

Other members of the brigade arrive later and are assigned numbers, including José Basulta (2522), and Rafael Quintero (2527). The training is originally scheduled to last 15 days but extends into a month and a half. In early July, the Brigadistas are transferred by plane to camps in Guatemala. (Brigadista Diary p. 2?6)\n\nMAY 24, 1960: CIA Director Allen Dulles updates the National Security Council on two semi?covert radio activities related to Cuba. He reports that \"several well?known Cuban refugees [are] purchasing time for anti?Castro broadcasts from a short?wave station in Cuba.\" In addition, he announces that Radio Swan is now on the air for \"test purposes. The station will go on the air quietly at first, will then attack [Dominican leader Rafael] Trujillo, and then later will begin to attack Castro.\" Radio Swan will be operated ostensibly by a commercial company.

There he meets an assistant to Phillips who is in charge of field propaganda work, and is dispensing CIA subsidies to several Cuban exile newspapers: Subscriptions to Latin Americans are sold at nominal cost to spread the anti?Castro word in countries where Fidel is regarded sympathetically.\n\nPhillips decides that \"a single station [is] not sufficient for the task\" of transmitting adequate propaganda. He later writes that \"We soon created a second capability independent of Radio Swan and the exile political groups by having CIA agents buy space on existing radio stations around the perimeter of\n\nthe Caribbean. These broadcasts were low?key and not recognizable as anti-Castro. Only after D?Day would they become activist voices, to influence Cubans when they faced the decision of who would win and who would lose. \"Several stations with CIA ties, including Radio Cuba Independiente, La Voz de Cuba Libre, and a Massachusetts?based station begin broadcasting anti?Castro messages. (Hunt, pp.46?47; Phillips, p.122; Soley and Nichols, pp.180?181)\n\nJUN 21, 1960: Over Radio Mambi, a Cuban government station, Castro government officials charge that a counterrevolutionary radio station, supported by U.S. dollars, is now broadcasting on Swan island.

The force takes the name 2506 Brigade, from the serial number of its first casualty, Carlos Rodriguez Santana, who fell two thousand feet off a cliff on a training hike. (Johnson, p.57; Wyden, p.51)\n\nThe CIA later reports that during this period, the effectiveness of Radio Swan begins to diminish: Although great numbers of Cubans still listen to the station, its credibility and reputation suffers because programming only represents the narrow interests of the Cuban groups producing the various broadcasts. The program producers are using exaggeration in order to sensationalize their broadcasts. An example: One of the announcers stated that there were 3,000 Russians in a park in Santiago de Cuba; the residents had only to walk to the park to see that this was untrue.

There will be no early attempt to break out of the lodgment for further offensive operations unless and until there is a general uprising against the Castro regime or overt military\n\nintervention by United States forces has taken place.\n\nIt is expected that these operations will precipitate a general uprising throughout Cuba and cause the revolt of large segments of the Cuban Army and. Militia.... If matters do not eventuate as predicted above, the lodgment ....can be used as the site for establishment of a ?, provisional government that can be recognized by the United States .... The way will then be paved for United States military intervention aimed at pacification of Cuba, and this will result in the prompt overthrow of the Castro Government.\n\nAir strikes are seen as a crucial component of the invasion: \"It is considered crucial that the Cuban air force and naval vessels capable of opposing the landing be knocked out or neutralized before amphibious shipping makes its final run into the beach.\" (CIA, Memorandum For.

Eisenhower makes it clear that the project is going very well and that it is the new administration's responsibility to do whatever is necessary to bring it to a successful conclusion. According to notes taken during the meeting, \"Senator Kennedy asked the President's judgment as to the United States supporting the guerrilla operation in Cuba, even if this support involves the United States publicly. The President replied Yes as we cannot let the present government there go on.\" (The White House, Meeting in the Cabinet Room, 9:45 a.m., January 19, 1961)\n\nJAN 19?20, 1961: Six American military men aboard the yacht \"Aries\" dock in Havana and claim that they have come to defend the Cuban revolution. On interrogation, they admit to coming to fight against the government but because of bad weather and running out of fuel they were obliged to enter Havana. The six are sent before a Revolutionary Tribunal.

The letter reviews the regime's \"calculated\" takeover of all sectors of the society?politics, religion, unions, repression etc. The DRE requests U.S. support in what they call a \"transcendent fight\" against Communism in Cuba. 'The role of the US is to prevent communism, disguised as Fidelism, from becoming the expression of the present revolutionary feeling in Latin America,\" the letter states. \"Finally, Mr. President, we want to state [that] our hope lies with someone like you...\" (DRE letter to Kennedy, 1/24/61)\n\nClark Clifford, special counsel to President Harry S.

Lemnitzer tells the President that in light of the \"shipment of heavy new military equipment from Czechoslovakia?30,000 tons or more?clandestine forces are not strong enough. [The U.S.] must increase the size of this force and this creates very difficult problems. What is required is a basic expansion of plans.\" (Gen. Goodpaster, Memorandum of Conference with President Kennedy, Washington, January 23, 1961, 10:15a.m., 1/27/61)\n\nJAN 27, 1961: The Joint Chiefs of Staff send a memo to the Secretary of Defense expressing their increasing concern that Cuba will become permanently established as a part of the Communist Bloc?with disastrous consequences to the security of the Western Hemisphere. They also state their belief that the primary objective of the United States in Cuba should be the speedy overthrow of the Castro Government.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs argue that the current Political?Para?Military Plan does not assure the accomplishment of the above objective and recommend that an overall U.S. Plan of Action for the overthrow of the Castro Government be developed by an Inter?Departmental Planning Group. (Joint Chiefs of Staff, Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, U. S. Plan of Action in Cuba, 1 /27/61)?Sherman Kent, chairman of the CIA's Board of National Estimates, sends Allen Dulles a secret memorandum entitled \"Is Time on Our Side in Cuba?,\" concluding that Castro's position in Cuba is likely to grow stronger rather than weaker as time goes on. The board, which does not know of the invasion plans, argues against the view that the Cuban population is eager to stage an uprising against Castro: While Castro will probably continue to lose popular support, this loss is likely to be more than counter?balanced by the regime's effective controls over daily life in Cuba and by the increasing effectiveness of its security forces for maintaining control.

Johnson, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, CIA Director Dulles, General Lemnitzer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Assistant Secretaries Mann and Nitze, and Tracy Barnes of the CIA.\n\nAfter hearing the estimate of the Defense Department that no course of action currently authorized by the United States Government will be effective in reaching the agreed national goal of overthrowing the Castro regime, and the State Department's view that any overt military action not authorized and supported by the OAS will have grave political dangers, President Kennedy authorizes:\n\n1) A continuation and accentuation of current activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, Including increased propaganda,increased political action and increased sabotage. Continued overflights for these purposes were specifically authorized; 2)The Defense Department, with CIA, will review proposals for active deployment of anti?Castro Cuban forces on Cuban territory, and the results of this analysis will be promptly reported to the President; 3) The Department of State will prepare a concrete proposal for action with other Latin?American countries to isolate the Castro regime and to bring against it the judgment of the Organization of American States. (McGeorge Bundy, Memorandum of Discussion on Cuba, Cabinet Room, January 28, 1961, 1 /28/61)\n\n?Fidel Castro, in a talk in Santa Clara, analyzes the causes of counterrevolution in Las Villas mentioning \"the infiltration of public posts, in the municipal and national administration, and even in the army and police forces, by elements that are truly adventurist, negative, and corrupt who link up with henchmen who flee immediately ...and begin to parachute arms into Escambray.\" (Informe Especial: 1961)\n\nJAN 30, 1961: C/WH/4 Jake Esterline attends a briefing given by Colonel Jack Hawkins and members of the [deleted] PM Section to Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral Wright, General Bull, and General Barnes in preparation for the January 32 briefing of designees of the Chairman of the JCS. The briefing, presented in a special CIA Bay of Pigs task force \"war room,\" emphasizes that \"the proposed strike could be conducted with no overt U.S. military support other than the provision of one LSD (landing ship dock).\" It was also emphasized that the \"estimate of the likelihood of success was very high in terms of staying in the initial objective area long enough and in sufficient control to permit introduction of a 'Provisional Government' and provide a rationale for the subsequent employment of overt military force, if desired.\" (R.D. Drain, Memorandum for the Record, 1 /30/61)\n\nLATE JANUARY 1961: Brigadier General David W. Gray, chief of the Joint Subsidiary Activities Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, receives orders from the JCS to form a committee with four other officers to study the CIA plan on behalf of the chiefs. After reviewing what will come to be known as the \"Trinidad Plan,\" Grays group concludes that the invading Brigade could last for up to four days, given complete surprise and complete air supremacy. Success will depend on uprisings in Cuba. Gray estimates the chances of success at about 30?70 but no figures are used in the Gray committees report. At a meeting with the Joint Chiefs on January 31, Grays report becomes an official JCS document. (Wyden, pp.89?90)\n\n?A revolt occurs among the Cuban exiles in training in Guatemala. Almost half of the more than five hundred men in camp resign, including the entire second and third battalions.

The evaluation concludes that \"since the Cuban Army is without experience in coordinated offensive action, the invasion force should be able to successfully resist the initial attacks\" but \"lacking a popular uprising or substantial follow?on forces, the Cuban Army could eventually reduce the beachhead.\" According to the JCS, \"the operation as presently envisaged would not necessarily require overt U.S. intervention.\" At the same time, the evaluation cautions that: It is obvious that ultimate success will depend upon political factors. It should be noted that assessment of the combat worth of assault forces is based upon second and third hand reports. For these reasons, an independent evaluation of the combat effectiveness of the invasion force and detailed analysis of logistics plans should be made by a team of Army, Naval, and Air Force officers. Despite the shortcomings pointed out in the assessment, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that timely execution of this plan has a \"fair\" chance of ultimate success and, even if it does not achieve the full results desired, could contribute to the eventual overthrow of the Castro regime. (JCS, Chairman L.L. Lemnitzer, Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, Military Evaluation of the CIA Paramilitary Plan, Cuba, 2/3/61)\n\nFEB 4 and 6, 1961: President Kennedy writes to Security Adviser Bundy inquiring whether the sharp differences of opinion on the Cuban operation have been settled, and two days later asks again whether the differences between the departments of State and Defense and the CIA have been resolved. The President asks if it has been determined what is to be done about Cuba and stresses that, if there are differences of opinion between the agencies, he would like them brought to his attention. (Gleijeses, pp.20?21)\n\nFEB 7, 1961: Officials of the Departments of State and Defense, the White House, and the CIA meet to discuss the \"Agency Plan\" and the \"JCS evaluation.\" According to a memo on the meeting, \"while the soundness of the plan itself [is] at no time questioned, a number of questions [are] raised.\" Specifically, the group discusses the ability of the strike force to reach the mountains from the landing site, the chances of a popular uprising in support of the invasion, the international political ramifications of the plan, and the need to introduce U.S. forces to ensure success.\n\nThe group reaches no consensus on what course of action to recommend to the President. White House Adviser Richard Goodwin points out that the President has \"made it quite clear that if there were unresolved differences of opinion of the, Cuban problem, the persons concerned should come to the President's office and in his presence orally set forth their arguments for his consideration and eventual decision.\" (Assistant Secretary of State Thomas . Mann, Memorandum for the Record, Meeting on Cuba, 2/7/61)\n\nFEB 8, 1961: In a memo to the President, McGeorge Bundy highlights the difference of opinion on the Cuba operation between the State Department, and CIA and Defense:\n\nDefense and CIA now feel quite enthusiastic about the invasion from Guatemala. At worst, they think the invaders would get into the mountains, and at best they think they might get a full?fledged civil war in which we could then back the anti?Castro forces openly. The State Department takes a much cooler view, primarily because of its belief that the political consequences would be very grave both in the United Nations and in Latin America.\n\nBundy notes that he and Richard Goodwin \"join in believing that there should certainly not be an invasion adventure without careful diplomatic soundings\" which are likely to support the position of the State Department. (McGeorge Bundy, Memorandum from the President's Special Assistant for National Security\n\nAffairs to President Kennedy, 2/8/61)\n\n?In an afternoon meeting of President Kennedy and his top advisers, Richard Bissell of the CIA reports the assessment of the JCS?that the CIA plan for landing the brigade has a fair chance of success. Success is defined as an ability to survive, hold ground, and attract growing support from Cubans. At worst, the invaders should be able to fight their way to the Escambray and go into guerrilla action. After the State Department representatives point out the grave effects such an operation could have on the U.S. position in Latin America without careful and successful diplomatic preparation, President Kennedy presses for alternatives to a full?fledged invasion, supported by U.S. planes, ships and supplies. A memcon written by McGeorge Bundy records Kennedy's question: \"Could not such a force be landed gradually and quietly and make its first major military efforts from the mountains?then taking shape as a Cuban force within Cuba, not as an invasion force sent by the Yankees?\" Kennedy authorizes creation of a small junta of anti?Castro leaders to give the Brigade forces some political purpose.

Over the next week, the camp is marked for an airdrop of supplies, and peasant recruits begin to sign up. Instead of the scheduled airdrop, however, the resistance force is surrounded by 16,000 government troops and police; Fernandez and five hundred of his men are captured on and around February 16th and taken to the Santa Clara jail. (Chronology of Irregular Forces)\n\nFEB 9, 1961: Admiral Dennison, Commander?in?Chief, Atlantic, meets with the President and asks him if the Navy needs?to prepare for any possible bail?out operations. The President responds definitely no, that if anything went wrong the force would fade into the hinterland. (Aguilar, p.164)\n\nFEB 11, 1961: In a memo to the President, Arthur Schlesinger argues that the \"drastic decision\" to enact the plan being promoted within the government only makes sense \"if one excludes everything but Cuba.\" Taken in the context of \"the hemisphere and the rest of the world, the arguments against this decision begin to gain force.\" He points out that there is no way to disguise U.S. complicity in the plan and \"at one stroke, it would dissipate all the extraordinary good will which has been rising toward the new Administration through the world.\" (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., \"Memorandum from the President's Special Assistant to President Kennedy,\" 2/11/61)\n\nThe CIA's Board of National Estimates sends the Director a memorandum outlining. international reactions to various U.S. actions against the Castro regime. The Board argues that the Soviet Bloc \"would regard Castro's downfall as a substantial, political defeat and would respond vigorously to any major U.S. move.\" While that response would be primarily political, in the event of a prolonged military struggle, the Bloc would seek to continue or increase military aid to the Castro regime. However, the Board \"believe[s] that the Bloc would avoid a direct military confrontation with U.S. forces.\"\n\nThe Board reports that most governments in Latin America would \"at least privately approve of unobtrusive U.S. support for an opposition move against Castro...\" However, reaction would ultimately depend on whether the U.S. is perceived to be \"assisting the Cubans themselves to settle their own destinies,\" or is \"imposing a new regime.\" As for \"reactions elsewhere in the Free World,\" the Board believes \"it would remind many people of the Soviet intervention in Hungary.\" (CIA, Memorandum for the Director, By Abbot Smith, Acting Chairman, Board of National Estimates, 2/11/96)\n\nThe CIA makes a further attempt to infiltrate a team from Brigade 2506 into Cuba. The ship almost capsizes in heavy seas. The men swim ashore practically naked, without weapons, money, or radio equipment. They are the first of the Brigade infiltration teams to land in Cuba. (Johnson, p.59)\n\nFEB 12, 1961: The Voice of America announces it will broadcast a series of anti?Castro radio programs, beginning with a documentary \"The Anatomy of a Broken Promise\" which reviews Castro's pledges to hold elections and how these pledges were broken one by one.

Varona, the coordinator and principal official of the Frente speaks to the Brigade and says that the Brigade headquarters cannot make decisions without first consulting the civilian structure in Miami. The following day, Verona expresses confidence in San Roman's leadership, which Brigade members greet with catcalls and shouts of derision. (Johnson, pp.62? 63)\n\nFEB 14, 1961: Adolph Berle writes a memo to Secretary Rusk on a decision-making meeting on the Cuba operation. \"We arranged leadership for the camps,\" he states. He also highlights a CIA paper on the dangers of aborting the operation. \"It suggests that dismantling the Cuban operation may mean explosions in three or four countries in Central America. If it is accurate, we should be prepared for the consequences of dismantling.\" (Cuba, 2/14/61)\n\nFEB 15, 1961: Thomas Mann, the assistant secretary of for Inter?American affairs, writes a memo to Rusk opposing the invasion. Mann notes that the CIA's original plan is based on the assumption that the invasion will inspire a popular uprising which is unlikely to take place. \"It therefore appears possible, even probable, that we would be faced with ...a) abandoning the brigade to its fate, which would cost us dearly in prestige and respect or b) attempting execution of the plan to move the brigade into the mountains as guerrillas, which would pose a prolonged problem of air drops or supplies or c) overt U.S. military intervention.\"\n\nMann argues that international law, the inability to hide the hand of the U.S., and the fact that Castroism would be more useful to the U.S. as a model of socioeconomic failure, rather than as a martyr?or victor?against U.S. intervention all are reasons to abandon the operation. \"I therefore conclude it would not be in the national interest to proceed unilaterally to put this plan into execution\" (Mann, The March 1960 Plan, 2/15/61)\n\nFEB 16?17, 1961: At 12.30 a.m. planes enter Cuban airspace flying at 300?500 feet over the village of Tortuguilla. At 8.35 a.m. two planes fly east to west at 500 feet over national territory. Between 7.45 a.m. and 9.50 a.m. planes enter Cuban airspace four times and at 2.00 p.m. planes again fly over the island. (Informe Especial: 1961)\n\nFEB 17, 1961: President Kennedy meets with representatives from the State Department, CIA, and Joint Chiefs of Staff, and following a discussion of planning and preparations for the invasion indicates that he would be in favor of a more moderate approach to the problem such as mass infiltration. The President urges an examination of all possible alternatives. Since the meeting does not result in a decision, the military plan for a D?Day of 5 March is forced to slip by a month. (Gleijeses, p.22; Aguilar, p.65)\n\nTwo days later, Richard Bissell responds to the Mann argument with a comprehensive opinion paper arguing for the invasion. He addresses the \"disposal\" problem if the mission is aborted: Brigade \"members will be angry, disillusioned and aggressive with the inevitable result that they will provide honey for the press bees and the U.S. will have to face the resulting indignities and embarrassments.\" Bissell concludes by arguing that this is the last opportunity for the U.S. to bring down Castro without overt U.S. military intervention or a full embargo:\n\nThe Cuban paramilitary force, if used, has a good chance of overthrowing Castro or at the very least causing a damaging civil war without requiring the U.S. to commit itself to overt action against Cuba. Whatever embarrassment the alleged (though deniable) U.S. support may cause, it may well be considerably less than that resulting from the continuation of the Castro regime or from the more drastic and more attributable actions necessary to accomplish the result at a later date.\" (Cuba, 2/17/61)\n\nFEB 18, 1961: McGeorge Bundy passes on both the Bissell and the Mann position papers to the President. \"Bissell and Mann are the real antagonists at the staff level,\" Bundy writes in a cover memo. \"Since I think you lean toward Mann's view, I have put Bissell on top.\" Bundy's own position is that the U.S. should institute a trade embargo first, let internal opposition build for several months and then launch \"Bissell's battalion.\" At that point, he writes, \"the color of civil war would be quite a bit stronger.\" (Bundy to JFK, 2/18/61)\n\nFEB 19, 1961: A plane flies over Cuban airspace and drops anti?Castro propaganda in Marianao, Regla and other districts of Havana.

Again entitled \"is Time on Our Side in Cuba?,\" it argues: 'To be sure, the regimes once overwhelming popular support has greatly diminished in recent months and various instances of guerrilla position, sabotage and economic dislocation have arisen to plague it. However, we see no signs that such developments portend any serious threat to a regime which by now has established a formidable structure of control over the daily lives of the Cuban people.\" (Wyden, p.99)\n\nMAR 11, 1961: At a White House meeting between 10:05 a.m. and 12:15 p.m., Richard Bissell presents the CIA's Proposed Operation Against Cuba to President Kennedy. The paper provides four alternative courses of action involving the commitment of the paramilitary force being readied by the U.S. These include the course of action favored by the CIA ? the Trinidad Plan that involves \"an amphibious/airborne assault .... to seize a beachhead contiguous to terrain suitable for guerrilla operations,\" with a landing of the \"provisional government ...as soon as the beachhead had been secured.\" The invading force is expected to repulse attacks by Castro militia with substantial losses to the attacking forces followed by defections from the armed forces and widespread rebellion. If the actions are unsuccessful in detonating a major revolt, the assault force would retreat to the contiguous mountain area and continue operations as a powerful guerrilla force. The assault, combined with a diversionary landing, according to the CIA plan, has the potential for administering a demoralizing shock that could lead to the prompt overthrow of the Castro regime. If not, guerrilla action could be continued on a sizable scale in favorable terrain.\n\nThe President rejects the Trinidad Plan as too spectacular, too much like a World War II invasion. He prefers a quiet landing, preferably at night, with no basis for American military intervention. No decision comes from the March 11 meeting and the President states his view that \"the best possible plan... has not yet been presented, and new proposals are to be concerted promptly.\"\n\nThe same day Bundy signs National Security Action Memorandum 31 noting that \"the President expects to authorize U.S. support for an appropriate number of patriotic Cubans to return to their homeland.\" Kennedy wants a plan to be prepared that would be less spectacular in execution, and therefore more plausible as an essentially Cuban operation. CIA officials, directed by Bissell, scramble to come up with a new plan in less than three days.

(Molina, \"Diario de Girón\", p. 83; Informe Especial: 1961)\n\nMAR 14 and 15, 1961: The CIA presents three alternative invasion scenarios to the Working Group of the Joint Staff. The Joint Chiefs of Staff review the plans and choose the alternative recommended by the Working Group?the Zapata Plan which involves a landing at the Bay of Pigs. They add, however, that none of the alternative concepts is considered as feasible and likely to accomplish the objective as the Trinidad Plan. (JCS, Evaluation of the Military Aspects of Alternative Concepts, CIA Para?Military Plan, Cuba, 3/15/61)\n\nMAR 16, 1961: At 4:15 p.m., Dulles and Bissell present President Kennedy with three alternative plans for the Cuban operation. His national security adviser reports that the CIA has done a remarkable job of reframing the landing plan so as to make it unspectacular and quiet, and plausibly Cuban in its essentials, and has briefed Kennedy in advance on the proposals.\n\nThe first option is a modification of the Trinidad Plan, the second targets an area on the northeast coast of Cuba, and the third, the so?called Zapata Plan, is an invasion at the Bay of Pigs. The President orders modifications of the Zapata Plan to make it appear more of an inside guerrilla?type operation. (Notes of General Gray; Gleijeses p.36)\n\n?Cuban security forces announce that 420 \"counterrevolutionaries\" have been put out of action in the Escambray campaign ? 39 killed in combat and 381 taken prisoner.

(Molina, \"Diario de Girón?? pp. 80?81; Informe Especial: 1961)\n\nMAR 16, 1961: Drawing on intelligence gathered in Cuba at the end of February, the CIA generates an information report that claims \"diminishing popular support of the Castro government.\" Estimates are that \"fewer than 20 percent of the people\" support Castro, and that \"many Cubans think that it is possible that Castro will soon fall.\" It concludes that \"approximately 75 to 80 percent of the militia units will defect when it becomes evident that the real fight against Castro has begun.\"\n\nBissell uses this and several similar intelligence reports to bolster his case that the invasion will spark a major uprising.

Several days later, Tracy Barnes sends Arthur Schlesinger the first draft of a proposed Council Manifesto, which Schlesinger later describes as \"so overwrought in tone and sterile in thought that it made one wonder what sort of people we were planning to send back to Havana.\" Barnes and Schlesinger recruit two Harvard academics, John Plank and William Barnes, to help redraft the document.
