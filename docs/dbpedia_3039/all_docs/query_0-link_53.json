        "text": "Introduction\n\nLiver transplantation offers several advantages for the treatment of patients with acute or fulminant liver failure or end-stage chronic liver disease, but is limited by the shortage of deceased human donor organs. In patients with acute liver failure, usually induced by chemical or viral hepatitis, the onset of disease is sudden and identification of a suitable donor organ is frequently not possible before permanent neurologic injury and/or death occurs.\n\nIn the USA, data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network indicate that in 2014 the number of patients on the waiting list for a human donor liver was close to 16,000. Of these, only 6,729 received a transplant.1 Of close to 10,000 who did not receive a transplant, 3,178 died or were removed from the waiting list because they were too sick to undergo a major operative procedure, which is approximately 20% of those on the waiting list and 30% of those who did not receive a transplant.\n\nSupport during the critical period when the patient is in acute liver failure may be aimed at (i) ‘bridging’ the patient to liver allotransplantation in order to prevent irreversible cerebral injury, or (ii) gaining time for regeneration of a damaged native liver, if this is considered likely.\n\nPotential solutions to the problem include (i) an artificial liver device, (ii) the transplantation of hepatocytes or (iii) hepatocyte-like expanded human stem cells, (iv) ex vivo pig or nonhuman primate (NHP) liver perfusion, or (v) the transplantation of a genetically-engineered pig liver. Regenerative medicine techniques whereby a human or pig liver is decellularized and recelluarized with cells from the potential recipient would not be applicable to patients with acute liver failure. This brief review will be restricted to assessing the potential therapeutic impact of pig liver xenotransplantation in acute liver failure and the remaining barriers that currently do not yet justify clinical trials."
