        "text": "Feral pigs are becoming a problem across a wider swath of the continent, thanks to a highly resilient genetic makeup.\n\nThese invasive animals cause billions of dollars in agricultural damage, eat or outcompete native species, and spread disease.\n\nExperts says the crisis is largely driven by people who trap and transport the animals so that they can be hunted.\n\nIt may be the year of the rabbit, but it’s the pig that has been making headlines lately. A so-called super pig is invading the prairie region of Canada, demonstrating a surprising ability to survive the region’s harsh climate and frigid temperatures. These animals are hardy, hard to catch, and destructive, causing billions of dollars in agricultural damage and soil erosion, and making life difficult for native species.\n\nWhile feral pigs are a recent problem for our neighbors to the north, here in the U.S., farmers and land managers have been battling the invasive species for decades, often with little to show for their efforts.\n\nWhat makes these porky ungulates so successful? A lot of it has to do with genetics.\n\nA Brief History of Sus Scrofa\n\nAfter millennia of chasing wild boar around the woods with spears, Homo sapiens finally got wise. Roughly 9,000 years ago, in what is now eastern Turkey, our ancestors began domesticating the Eurasian Boar, Sus Scrofa. By the time Christopher Columbus picked up a few to take along on his second voyage to America in 1493, the 400-pound tusked beast had been transformed into a pink, floppy-eared familiar. In that time, pig husbandry had produced a docile and resilient animal, one bred to survive a range of climatic conditions and to reproduce—a lot.\n\nAn engraving depicting a wild boar (Sus scrofa) native to Eurasia, North Africa, and the Greater Sudan Islands. Dated 19th century.\n\nAs subsequent explorers made landfall along the Eastern Seaboard, they too brought and released thousands of pigs—some on purpose, as a food source for follow-on expeditions, but many by accident. These runaway or discarded pigs grew into the continent’s earliest populations of feral hogs, which for centuries remained small, and contained to just a few southern states.\n\nAnd then, about 100 years ago, Americans decided that they would once again like to chase wild boar through the woods with weapons, which led to the importation and release of thousands of Eurasian boars onto fenced hunting preserves in states like New York, North Carolina, and Texas. Invariably, many of these animals escaped and bred with nearby populations of feral pigs, creating a hybrid pig that combined the rough-and-tumble toughness of a boar with the intelligence and year-round fertility of a domestic pig.\n\n“If it’s got a calorie in it and they can get their mouth around it they will eat it.”\n\nWith few natural predators on the landscape and increased interest in hunting the animals, the new and improved feral pig has proliferated across the continent. Today, there are an estimated 7 million feral pigs in the United States, breeding at an astonishing pace (a sow can produce up to three litters in a 14-month period), rooting up crops, and, well, pigging out.\n\n“If it’s got a calorie in it and they can get their mouth around it they will eat it,” Bill Hamrick, an expert in Nuisance Wildlife and Damage Management at Mississippi State University Extension, tells Popular Mechanics. “Plants, snakes, turtles, frogs, birds’ nests—anything.”\n\nFrom Hog to Hog Wild in an Instant\n\nHamrick doesn’t subscribe to the notion of a “super pig,” but explains that the feral pigs on the lam today are so successful because of their superior genetics.\n\n“You take a Eurasian boar, which is [a] rangier, tougher species and then mix that with a domestic stock that’s been strengthened by selective breeding, and you have a very strong hybrid,” he says.\n\nAs it turns out, even domestic pigs can turn feral in short order, relying on the ancient boar genes still encoded in their DNA. These “stealth genes,” as scientists call them, can be activated by changes in the pigs’ surroundings.\n\n✅ Get the Facts: Epigenetics\n\nOne of nature’s most dramatic examples of epigenetics is the grasshopper. When these springy green bugs have enough room to roam, they tend to be loners, content to live a quiet grasshopper life of solitude. However, when their population increases—say, after a particularly rainy year—and grasshoppers are forced to share tight quarters, these normally timid creatures quickly go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hide, thanks to a surge in brain chemicals brought on by the smell and touch of other grasshoppers. They become bigger and brighter, grow longer wings, and, instead of seeking solitude, pursue other grasshoppers to form an unruly mob. This transformation is called density-dependent phenotypic plasticity, and it’s how a docile grasshopper can become a destructive swam of locusts.\n\nEpigenetics also explains why a wild-born salmon is much more likely to survive a journey from fresh to saltwater than its hatchery-raised counterpart. Scientists have found that something about the hatchery fish’s captive environment seems to suppress the genes that help them survive in saltwater.\n\nEpigenetics happens in people too. According to a recent study, children who suffered from hunger or malnutrition as children were 20 percent more likely to develop diabetes as adults. Researchers think this association may be attributed to epigenetic changes in the expression of insulin genes brought on by starvation.\n\nThis is called epigenetics—which literally means “above” or “on top” of genetics—and it refers to the ways in which the environment can change the expression of certain genes in an organism. While these changes don’t alter the DNA sequence itself, they can change how cells “read” genes. In pigs, this means that a barnyard escapee will quickly resemble a feral hog, growing bigger and hairier in a matter of months.\n\nBut according to Hamrick, the real morphological changes happen when the first generation of feral piglets is born. Despite being one generation removed from a domestic existence, feral piglets will don tusks and develop a longer snout and flatter forehead to facilitate rooting.\n\nElusive Solutions\n\nIt took centuries for humans to create the genetic Frankenstein that is the feral pig, and it might take just as long to figure out how to eradicate it.\n\nBecause the animals reproduce at such an astonishing rate, efforts to reduce the population through lethal methods have mostly fallen flat. For example, wildlife officials in the Smoky Mountains have removed about 15,000 feral pigs over the past few decades while hardly putting a dent in the animals’ overall population.\n\nTo make matters worse, feral pigs are fast learners, swiftly figuring out how to avoid people and threatening situations. Pigs that have escaped a hunter’s crosshairs will begin foraging at night to elude their would-be assassins.\n\nBut the biggest obstacle facing efforts to rid the pig is the thing that got us here in the first place: human intervention.\n\n“It’s well-known they’re not migrating to different areas on their own,” explains Hamrick. “In most cases, people are trapping feral pigs and dropping them off somewhere so that they can hunt them.” He says that states that have made hunting the animal illegal have shown some success in reducing their populations, but namely in places that didn’t have too many pigs to begin with. In states with lots of pigs (or lots of hunters), a good solution remains as elusive as a greased pig.\n\nFor now, it seems, we’ll just have to live with the monster we created."
