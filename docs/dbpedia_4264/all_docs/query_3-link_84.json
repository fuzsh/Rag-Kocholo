They may have originated as far back as the cretaceous period. Their fossils were observed in North America, Asia, and Europe. Long before the first monkeys and their prosimian relatives developed, most animal species thrived and died. The first primates did not exist until about 50-55 million years ago, even though the planet is 4.54 billion years old and the first life goes back at least 3.5 billion years. Dinosaurs had been extinct for 10 to 15 million years when this happened."
