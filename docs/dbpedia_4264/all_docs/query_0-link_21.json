Acanthicus hystrix is distinguished from A. adonis ( Fig. 5 View FIGURE 5 ) by its dark brown to almost black color pattern, without spots or dots (vs. color pattern dark brown with white spots covering body and fins); presence of ochre to gray stripes in caudal fin (vs. stripes absent). It also can be differentiated by reaching up to 600.0 mm SL (vs. up to 134.5 mm SL), by the presence of vermicular blotches on abdomen (vs. abdominal blotches absent), and elongate first hypobranchial (vs. first hypobranchial short).\n\nDescription. Morphometric and meristic data summarized in Table 1. Dorsal profile of body slightly convex from tip of snout to vertical through dorsal-fin origin; nearly straight from that point to caudal-fin origin. Ventral profile of body straight from snout tip to caudal-fin origin. Ventral surface from cleithrum region to urogenital papillae with small plates. Greatest body width at pectoral girdle. Trunk strongly ornamented with five rows of keels; each one along each body plate series. Greatest body depth at dorsal-fin origin; body most slender at caudal peduncle.\n\nHead short, rounded anteriorly; snout and cheek completely covered by numerous small plates with sharply odontodes. Nasal bone rectangular, thin and elongate ( Fig. 2 View FIGURE 2 . Frontal bone elongated, contacting nares anteriorly and orbit laterally ( Fig. 2 View FIGURE 2 ). Anterior margin of frontal elongated, surpassing posterior margin or half nare length ( Fig. 2 View FIGURE 2 ). Parieto-supraoccipital elongate, its posterior edge wide without crest ( Fig. 2 View FIGURE 2 ). Sphenotic elongated ventrally, with little contact with IO6, without conspicuous odontodes ( Fig. 2 View FIGURE 2 ). Pterotic-supracleithrum expanded and with many fenestrae. Posterior area of pterotic-supracleithrum with one median plate or with several large plates. Orbit positioned dorsolaterally. Iris with small, dorsal flap over pupil. Infraorbital series with 7–8 bones and pores of laterosensorial system. Infraorbital 6 associated with posteroventral margin of orbit. Lateral line pores extend beyond the hypural plate.\n\nMouth moderate to large in size; lips large with width nearly long as length, covered with papillae; size of papillae decreasing towards posterior margin of lower lip; central buccal papilla present and very developed. Labial filaments absent. Upper lip folded over itself. Maxillary barbel short; base of barbel united to lips, with free tip. Lower lip not reaching anterior margin of coracoid. Premaxillae and dentary wide and short. Dentary oblique inwards. Teeth elongated, thin, with lateral cuspid well-developed, its distal edge slightly curved inwards. Medial end of premaxillary teeth curved inwards. Three pairs of large predorsal plates. Cheek plates eversible up to 90o, with hypertrophied odontodes.\n\nDorsal-fin rays i,8. Dorsal-fin base short, its length equals to 7 dorsal plates. Dorsal-fin spinelet V-shaped with locking mechanism. Seven furcate neural spines supporting dorsal fin. Pectoral and pelvic fins well developed, medial portion conspicuously expanded relative to base; distal margin rounded. Pectoral-fin rays i,6; unbranched ray covered with well-developed odontodes. Tip of adpressed pectoral fin reaching almost the end of unbranched pelvic-fin ray. Pelvic-fin rays i,5; pelvic-fin spine reaching vertical through anal-fin base when adpressed. Anal-fin rays i,4. Caudal fin i,14,i, truncate; caudal fin-ray filaments present in juveniles; supracaudal plates 7. Adipose fin absent. Three to four (usually three) procurrent caudal-fin rays. Total vertebrae 30, precaudal 13. Sixth rib very thickened, remaining ribs slender. Swimbladder capsule and transverse process of fourth vertebra expanded and surpassing rib of sixth vertebra ( Fig. 2 View FIGURE 2 ).\n\nColor in life. Body color pattern median to dark brown, without spots or blotches on dorsal surface. Ventral surface with vermiculate blotches in most specimens. Some specimens present body color pattern very dark, almost black (rio Madeira, rio Branco and rio Xingu). All fins usually median to dark brown, large specimens (more than 300 mm SL) can present ochre striated blotches poorly defined along the dorsal and caudal fin.\n\nColor in alcohol. Specimens in alcohol usually exhibit the same color pattern of live specimens, but in most cases more faint.\n\nDistribution. Acanthicus hystrix has a wide distribution in the Amazon basin, in drainages of rio Branco, rio Ucayali, rio Solimões, rio Trombetas, rio Japurá, rio Madeira, rio Xingu, and Tocantins-Araguaia basin; also in the Orinoco basin, in the río Orinoco and río Apure. Acanthicus adonis has a distribution restricted to the lower rio Tocantins ( Fig. 6 View FIGURE 6 ).\n\nEcological notes. Acanthicus hystrix can be found in the main channel of rivers, in moderate to strong currents, in shallow to deep habitats, and are usually collected at 2 to 3 meters in depth, hiding below conglomerate plates of rocks and gravel, or among medium to large bedrocks. In captivity, the species is omnivorous and detritivorous and usually feeds by scraping small particles from the substrate. Mature males usually develop more extensive and shaply odontodes on the pectoral spine, opercle and cheeks; they can also be more aggressive and exhibit territorial behavior (information about feeding and sexual dimorphism from www.seriouslyfish.com).\n\nFisheries and economical importance. Both species of Acanthicus are important resources as ornamental fishes. Acanthicus hystrix is recognized in the Altamira region by local fishermen as “acari avião” or “guariba” (Xingu) and internationally by aquarists as L155 (Schraml and Schäfer, 2004; Stawikowski et al., 2004; Werner et al., 2005). Acanthicus adonis is internationally recognized as “ adonis pleco”. The specimens are usually captured by diving with the aid of an air compressor, a typical way to capture ornamental fishes in the Altamira region (more about capture techniques in Sousa & Birindelli, 2009).\n\nGeographic variation. There are distinct geographical forms among Acanthicus hystrix . Some forms show great variation in color pattern and body shape, as in specimens from the Orinoco basin, rio Branco and rio Takutu, which present a dark color and more depressed body than those from others drainages. These specimens are usually referred to a different species or morphotype by the aquarium trade, Acanthicus sp. L193 (Orinoco, Apure) and Acanthicus sp. L407 (Branco and Takutu). However, is not uncommon that specimens from others drainages, like the Xingu and Madeira, present the same dark color pattern and depressed body shape. Material from several drainages was analyzed and the PCA analysis ( Fig. 7 View FIGURE 7 ) reveled that the morphometric data overlap among subpopulations. Based on this information, the color and body depth differences are here treated as geographical intraspecific variations.\n\nAcanthicus adonis has a distribution restricted to the lower rio Tocantins; however, it probably occurs in Peru (Erlend Bertelsen, pers. com.). Since there is no specific locality, and there are no samples from this locality in ichthyological collections, the map includes only the traditionally known distribution. Furthermore, this occurrence may be due to the introduction of this species by the aquarium trade.\n\nDiscussion\n\nArmbruster (2004) proposed 13 autapomorphies for Acanthicus hystrix (the sole congener included in his analysis): accessory process of first ceratobranchial wide (8:2), first hypobranchial elongated (23:1), ridge on hyomandibular absent (49:0), angle of dentaries oblique (69:0), five to six infraorbitals (91:1), lateral line continues beyond hypural plate (92:1), mesethmoid disk relative placement anterior to its main body (101:0), nasal bone very thin (105:0), adipose fin absent (137:1), posterior process of coracoid very elongate (159:1), anterolateral process of basipterygium wide through entire length (169:1), and viliform teeth (205:0). Most of these characters are external morphological features that diagnose the genus. Additional features are herein proposed as diagnostic for the genus, namely: (1) an enlarged and fenestrated compound pterotic associated to the distention of the posterior process of the Weberian apparatus, (2) an enlarged swim bladder capsule, extending beyond the sixth rib; (3) snout completely covered by plates; (4) the presence of abdominal plates; and (5) pectoral-fin spine, when adpressed, reaching almost the end of the unbranched pelvic-fin ray.\n\nMegalancistrus parananus was proposed as sister-taxa of Acanthicus hystrix by Armbruster (2004, 2008). Even though M. barrae and A. adonis were not included in both analyses, both genera are probably sister taxa because most characters used by Armbruster (2004) as synapomorphies of A. hystrix are present in A. adonis and the same occurs in M. parananus and M. barrae (pers. obs.). Recent hypothesis based on molecular data corroborated the monophyly of the Acanthicus clade. However, in a molecular hypothesis (Lujan et al., 2015) with the inclusion of A. adonis the conformation of the Acanthicus clade change to ( Megalancistrus ( Acanthicus ( Pseudacanthicus + Leporacanthicus ))). In Armbruster's (2004) morphological hypothesis, the clade Acanthicus hystrix plus Megalancistrus parananus is supported by several synapomorphies, including the presence of an enlarged compound pterotic, associated to the distention of the posterior process of the Weberian apparatus and the enlarged swim bladder capsule. However, in Megalancistrus , the compound pterotic is moderate in size, and the swim bladder capsule is rounded and does not extend beyond the sixth rib ( Fig. 3 View FIGURE 3 ). This condition also occurs, independently, in Panaque nigrolineatus (Armbruster, 2004; Lujan et al, 2010). These taxa have the highest encapsulated bladders reported in Loricariidae .\n\nAlexander (1964) suggested that, in Loricariidae , the reduction and consequent encapsulation of the swim bladder has occurred as an adaptation to a bottom-dwelling life style, and the importance of the Weberian apparatus has probably prevented the complete loss of the swim bladder. Furthermore, in groups with aerial respiratory organs, it is possible that the reduction of the swim bladder was in compensation of the hydrostatic effect of the accessory respiratory organs (Alexander, 1964; 1966). More recently, Lechner & Ladich (2008) correlated the morphology of the swim bladder with hearing ability, and suggested that reduced and encapsulated swim bladders do not affect hearing in low frequencies. The authors also indicated that in taxa among the Hypoptopomatinae , the large and well-perforated compound pterotic probably increases sound transmission to the inner ear. Based on this information it is assumed that in Acanthicus , Megalancistrus and Panaque the perception of sound might be more efficient than in other Loricariidae with the same proportion of swim bladder capsule and body size.\n\nMicracanthicus vandragti was described by Lujan & Armbruster (2011), and was considered by Armbruster (2008) sister taxon to all other members of the Acanthicus group by the presence of several characters, including the enlarged compound pterotic, associated to an enlarged gas bladder and bladder capsule whose posterior margin reaches the expanded rib of the sixth vertebra, as observed in species of Acanthicus . However, Micracanthicus vandragti can be distinguished from species of Acanthicus by the presence of an adipose fin, dentary teeth with longer shafts and larger cusps than premaxillary teeth, dentaries with a relatively short tooth cusp, and by having an intermandibular angle of 90o or less. Another character exclusive to Micracanthicus , among Hypostominae, is the reduction of body size to at maximum 42.4 mm SL (Lujan & Armbruster, 2011), while Acanthicus hystrix , one of the largest known loricariid species, can reach more than 600 mm SL.\n\nConcerning the taxonomy of A. hystrix, Isbrücker & Nijissen (1988) suggested that due to the widespread occurrence of the genus in the Amazon basin, the designation of a neotype for A. hystrix was urgent and necessary in order to delimit the type locality of the species. Nevertheless, although the holotype of Acanthicus hystrix is lost, the species is undoubtedly recognized by the figure of the type provided in the original description of the species. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, “the fact that the holotype specimen no longer exists or cannot be traced does not of itself invalidate the original designation” (ICZN, article 74.1.3). Aiming taxonomical stability, it is best to recognize the species and further support its validity through a comprehensive description than to make a small change in the taxonomy of the group by the unnecessary designation of a neotype.\n\nThe authorship of many species described in Spix & Aggasiz, 1829 has generated controversy in the literature. Historically, species authorships were generally considered to belong to Spix (Günther, 1868b; Eigenmann & Eigenmann, 1889; Regan, 1904; Fowler, 1954; Isbrücker, 1980), or more recently to Spix and Agassiz (Fisch- Muller, 2003; Ferraris, 2007). Spix and Agassiz’s “Selecta genera et species piscium quos in itinere per Brasiliam annos MDCCCXVII-MDCCCXX” was published in two fascicles, the first one in 1829 and the second in 1831; Acanthicus was described in the first one. According to Kottelat (1988), Spix collected the specimens and supervised the execution of the drawings, while Agassiz arranged the species in the systematic order and prepared the anatomical plates. Most plates of the first fascicle were engraved and colored before Spix’s death, and carry the names that Spix intended to give them, but Agassiz did not follow Spix's ideas in several cases when he judged that some names were inappropriate or misidentifications. Thus, Agassiz is the unique author of the species name in that case, including Acanthicus hystrix .\n\nConcerning the distribution of the genus, the type locality for Acanthicus hystrix is “flumine Amazonum” = [rio Amazonas]” and for A. adonis it is the lower rio Tocantins, Cametá. In the present contribution, the material of several drainages was examined and the distribution of the species highly expanded, showing that it has a widespread distribution in the Amazon, Tocantins-Araguaia, and Orinoco basins. Acanthicus hystrix occurs in whitewaters of Amazonian lowlands (rio Amazonas, rio Solimões, rio Madeira, rio Juruá, and rio Ucayali) as well as on Amazonian clearwater tributaries draining the Brazilian Shield, like the rio Xingu and Tocantins-Araguaia basin; and in the Guiana Shield, in rio Orinoco and rio Apure. On the other hand, Acanthicus adonis was only reported from the lower rio Tocantins, region of Cametá, occurring in sympatry with A. hystrix that has a wider distribution along its upper, median and lower course.\n\nThere are several differences between upland shield areas and lowland foreland basins that may have determined fish fauna distribution patterns. While the lowland rivers carry suspended solids and rich nutrients from the Andes (eg. whitewaters rivers: Madeira, Purus, Juruá, Ucayali), rivers originated in the crystalline shields of Brazil and Guyana (e.g. clearwater rivers: Tapajós, Xingu, Tocantins) are poor in nutrients (Goulding et al., 2003; Lima & Ribeiro, 2011). According to Lima & Ribeiro, (2011), there are several cases of restricted taxa distribution, either in lowlands (e.g. Hypoptopoma spp., Otocinclus vittatus , Lamontichthys spp., and Pterygoplichthys pardalis ) or in shields (e.g. Hypancistrus spp., Leporacanthicus spp., Parancistrus spp., Scobinancistrus spp.), whereas taxa with widespread distribution in the Amazon and Orinoco basins plus the Guyanese river systems, draining lowlands and shield areas, display a distribution pattern that should be called “northern cis-Andean South American”. Since Acanthicus hystrix is distributed both in lowlands and shields areas, but with no records in Guyanese river systems and in the rio Tapajós, it does not show any of the aforementioned distribution patterns. The lack of data of the species in the Guyanese systems could be related to the absence of information or deficient sampling efforts. In the rio Tapajós, on the other hand, even with recent expeditions to collect fishes and abundance of material in museum collections, Acanthicus spp. has not been reported from this drainage. Despite the occurrence of A. hystrix in geologically and chemically different systems (lowlands and shields), the species always inhabits river channels with strong currents and rock bottoms.\n\nKey to identification of species of Acanthicus\n\n1a.
