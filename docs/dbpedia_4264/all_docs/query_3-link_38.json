        "text": "Cambrian Period (543-490 mya)\n\nLand, which now covers about a third of the planet, remains devoid of life during the Cambrian period. Remnants of Rodinia, the dominant landmass during the late Proterozoic era, drift further apart. Where moving tectonic plates collide, mountain ranges form, especially on Gondwana, the largest of the fragments.\n\nAtmospheric and marine oxygen levels reach new heights in the generally warm and stable climate. These environmental factors may help trigger an \"explosion\" in animal diversity. In the seas, some three dozen animal phyla first appear, each with a distinctive body plan. While several of these groups disappear over time -- beginning with a series of extinction episodes near the end of the Cambrian -- most persist (though greatly modified) to the present day.\n\n543 mya: Hard-shelled animals\n\nBeginning in the early Cambrian, many animals evolve hard external skeletons of all shapes and sizes that shield and support their bodies. Shells, tubes, and spines, made primarily of calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, comprise a major part of the fossil record.\n\n540 mya: Oldest arthropod fossils\n\nArthropods, which include the insects and crustaceans, will become the most diverse phylum both on land and in the oceans. They are known for their segmented bodies, jointed legs, well-defined head area, and hard outer coating, or cuticle. While the oldest definitive arthropod fossils, which were left in abundance by communities of bottom-dwelling sea creatures called trilobites, date to the early Cambrian, trace fossils suggest they may have appeared even earlier, during the Vendian period.\n\n535 mya: Chordates\n\nMembers of the phylum Chordata, which include humans and all other vertebrates, have a stiff yet flexible rod that runs down the middle of the back, called a notochord. Made of cartilage-like material, not bone, the notochord provides support for the nerve cord. Other features characteristic of the chordate body plan are a tail and gill-like openings between the throat and the neck. In many chordates like the vertebrates, some of these features are apparent only in the early stages of embryonic development.\n\n530 mya: The Cambrian explosion\n\nThe basic body plans of the major animal phyla are established over a relatively short period of roughly 10 million years. All the major animal phyla that exist today -- about three dozen -- evolve from these Cambrian faunas.\n\n530 mya: Marine reefs\n\nMarine reefs are important ecosystems that support a wide variety of organisms. They form in shallow, tropical waters and are highly sensitive to changes in ocean conditions, like fluctuations in temperature and sea level. The archaeocyathids, spongelike animals that build the first reefs, go extinct only 10-15 million years after they first appear. Among the major reef-building groups that succeed the archaeocyathids include stromatoporoids and, much later, corals.\n\n500 mya: Gondwana forms\n\nA remnant of the Rodinia supercontinent, Gondwana is the southern hemisphere's primary landmass throughout the Paleozoic era.
