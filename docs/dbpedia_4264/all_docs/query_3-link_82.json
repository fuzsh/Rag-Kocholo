        "text": "Phylum Chordata belongs to the Kingdom Animalia and includes all the vertebrates, i.e., animals with a backbone, and several invertebrates, i.e., organisms without a backbone. They possess a bilaterally symmetrical body and are divided into three different sub-phyla.\n\nExplore more: Kingdom Animalia\n\nLet us have a detailed look at the characteristics and classification of the phylum Chordata.\n\nCharacteristics Of Phylum Chordata\n\nPhylum Chordata possesses the following characteristic features:\n\nNotochord\n\nIt is a longitudinal, cartilaginous rod running between the nerve cord and the digestive tract. It acts as a support for the nerve cord and is replaced by the vertebral column after the embryonic stage in all vertebrates.\n\nDorsal Nerve Cord\n\nIt is a bundle of nerves running along the “back” and splits into the brain and the spinal cord. It is hollow and lies dorsal to the notochord.\n\nPharyngeal Slits\n\nThey are the openings which allow the entry of water through the mouth without entering the digestive system viz. they connect mouth and throat. All Chordates have these openings on the lateral sides of the pharynx at some stage of their life.\n\nPost anal Tail\n\nIt is an extension of the body to the anus. In chordates, the tail is composed of skeletal muscles which help in locomotion in fish-like species. It is absent in most of the adult Chordates.\n\nOther characteristics of chordates include:\n\nBilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, coelomic and segmented body.\n\nThe body design is complex and well-differentiated.\n\nThe body has an organ system level of organization.\n\nAlso Read: Animal Kingdom\n\nClassification Of Phylum Chordata\n\nPhylum Chordata is classified into three subphyla, namely\n\nUrochordata (tunicates),\n\nCephalochordata (lancelets)\n\nVertebrata (vertebrates).\n\nThe subphylum Urochordata and Cephalochordata are collectively known as protochordates, which are marine animals. They are invertebrates but they share attributes of chordates.\n\nUrochordata\n\nThe adults are fixed to the substratum.\n\nIt is also known as Tunicate because the body of an adult is enclosed within a tunic made up of cellulose-like substance known as tunicin.\n\nNotochord can be seen only in the larval stage and disappears in adults.\n\nThe nerve cord present in larva is replaced by a dorsal ganglion in adults.\n\nThe larva can move and undergoes a metamorphosis.\n\nFor e.g., Ascidia, Salpa, Doliolum.\n\nCephalochordata\n\nThe atrium is present.\n\nMotile adult and larval stage.\n\nThe tail is present throughout life.\n\nThey show progressive metamorphosis.\n\nThe notochord is found throughout life.\n\nNumerous well-developed pharyngeal gill slits are present.\n\nFor e.g., Lancelets possess the notochord and nerve cord throughout their life. However, they lack the brain and bony vertebral column like Branchiostoma.\n\nVertebrata\n\nThe characteristic features of vertebrates include:\n\nThese are advanced chordates and have cranium around the brain.\n\nThe notochord is replaced by a vertebral column in adults. This is why it is said that ‘all vertebrates are chordates but all chordates are not vertebrates’.\n\nA high degree of cephalization is observed.\n\nThe epidermis is multi-layered.\n\nThey consist of three types of muscles-striped, unstriped and cardiac.\n\nThey have a well-developed coelom.\n\nThe alimentary canal is complete.\n\nThe heart is three or four-chambered.\n\nThey have well-developed respiratory and excretory systems.\n\nEndocrine glands are present in all.\n\nThey are unisexual and reproduce sexually, hagfish being an exception.\n\nFor e.g., humans.\n\nSubphylum Vertebrata is further classified into seven classes. They are:\n\nCyclostomata\n\nChondrichthyes\n\nOsteichthyes\n\nAmphibia\n\nReptilia\n\nAves\n\nMammalia\n\nExamples of Phylum Chordata\n\nExamples of phylum Chordata include the following:\n\nLampreys\n\nThis chordate belongs to the sub-phylum Vertebrata. It is a fish devoid of jaws and spends its larval stages as a filter-feeder. It gets transformed into a parasite as it grows into an adult.\n\nSea Squirt\n\nIt is a Urochordate with a barrel-shaped body attached to the substratum. The larva is tadpole-like and possesses a notochord. They bear a dorsal nerve, pharyngeal slits and a post-anal tail.\n\nAlso Read: Arthropoda"
