        "meta_description": "The Paul Smith's College VIC is a non-profit educational organization committed to providing access to the 2,800-acre campus. The Paul Smith's College VIC offers year-round environmental education and outdoor recreation opportunities. Before exploring the property’s outstanding trail network, stop by the visitor center’s nature museum and learn a few things about Adirondack ecosystems. While you’re there, you can ask staff about trail recommendations, and check out the art gallery and butterfly house before hitting the trails. Outside of the visitor center, a 25-mile trail network begins. Take the wide, easy path down to Heron Marsh and birdwatch from one of the viewing platforms. If you want something longer but just as easy, continue straight to the boardwalk over the marsh—this is an amazing opportunity to walk through a wetland without getting wet—or bear right and follow Barnum Brook to the Boreal Life trail, where another boardwalk winds past pitcher plants and bog rosemary to a viewing platform overlooking Barnum Pond. The VIC trails are free to use in the summer, but in winter the property becomes a cross-country ski center. For a small day pass fee (season passes are also available), visitors can use snowshoe, backcountry, and groomed cross-country trails. The groomed trails are maintained for both classic and skate skiing, and they take skiers through the variety of habitats on VIC’s property.",
