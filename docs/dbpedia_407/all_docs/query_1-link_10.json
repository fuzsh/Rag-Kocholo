A social challenge that make or break you. A tradition of great women.\n\nKatherine class of 2014\n\nSmith is what you make it. There are all sorts of opportunities to be artsy, athletic, musical, outdoorsy, and whatever else suits you, without losing the opportunity to focus on academics. With such a variety of people and programs, everyone can find their niche here.\n\nSally from Lawrence, KS\n\nSmith has a beautiful campus and downtown, faculty that (for the most part) treat you with respect, and an incredibly diverse student body. It is very liberal (and not just in the liberal arts sense) and most students are comfortable voicing their discord with current issues and sometimes even Smith's administration. Overall, I absolutely love it! Smith's small, women's* college atmosphere make it an ideal place to spend my four years.\n\nLaura from Windsor, CA\n\nSmith College is a well-rounded, academic and exciting college, that allows Smithies to explore and cultivate their interests while opening doors to the work world. Smithies are driven, enthusiastic students, and the environment at Smith never fails to bring out the best in them. Smith women are known for their presence and influence in the world, something Smith College steadfastly supports.\n\nMegan from Stafford Springs, CT\n\nSmith has awesome opportunities especially if you are into the sciences. Like doing research with a professor, professor's being flexible about waitlist and also classes that just are not that large.\n\nAlso, the students are awesome too (they are all a bunch of geeks).\n\nRamlah from Brooklyn, NY\n\nThe college campus is really beautiful with a lot of natural scenery. The students tend to be affluent young women with strenuous academic goals and there is a large LGBTQ presence on campus in addition to other social activism movements. The classes are rigorous regardless of your department but you can always find help if you ask for it.\n\nBronx, NY\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nBryn Mawr, PA\n\nProvidence, RI\n\nAmherst, MA\n\nBoston, MA\n\nCambridge, MA\n\nSouth Hadley, MA\n\nWellesley, MA\n\nNew York, NY\n\nNew York, NY\n\nIthaca, NY\n\nNew York, NY\n\nPoughkeepsie, NY\n\nSee All"
