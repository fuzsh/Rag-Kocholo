        "text": "Boston Colleges and Universities\n\nWhen it comes to Boston colleges and universities, there’s something for every student. Boston is a historic and beautiful city with some of the oldest architecture in the nation. There are dozens of incredible universities in Boston, all with varying programs and opportunities. In this guide, we’ll walk you through all of the best universities in Boston and discuss each school in depth.\n\nIn this article on Boston colleges and universities, we’ll cover everything you need to know about the best colleges in Boston, including:\n\nHow many Boston colleges and universities there are\n\nThe public, private, and community colleges in Boston (and a handy map of Boston colleges and universities to show you where they are)\n\nWhere colleges in Boston ranked on national and Boston-specific college lists\n\nIvy League Boston colleges and universities\n\nSome of the best architecture colleges in Boston, as well as Boston colleges and universities for music and art\n\nDetails about the Five College Consortium located just West of Boston\n\nAnd, where to find more resources on Boston colleges and universities\n\nKeep reading to learn more about universities in Boston!\n\nExploring Colleges in Boston\n\nBoston colleges and universities are some of the finest in the country. From MIT to Harvard to Northeastern, there are dozens of colleges in Boston area (and Boston proper) that consistently top the rankings.\n\nColleges in Boston vary in size, type, and specialty—there’s truly something for everyone! And though rankings aren’t everything, you’ll find many top universities in Boston. As you’ll notice throughout this guide, the best colleges in Boston are some of the best in the world. Later on, we’ll look at specific college rankings and see where colleges in Boston ranked across different lists.\n\nDifferent Boston colleges and universities will have different academic approaches and campus culture. If you do your research, you’ll find many different types of colleges in Boston that cater to different students’ needs. These include research universities, liberal arts colleges, women’s colleges, and community colleges.\n\nResearch Universities\n\nSome of the top universities in Boston are research universities. When you think of the best universities in Boston, you’re likely thinking of high-powered research institutions. Research universities in Boston include schools like MIT, Harvard University, and Boston University.\n\nYou’ll find both public and private colleges in Boston with great resources, so don’t feel limited one way or another. All of these schools have ample facilities to conduct research, including access to labs and prestigious graduate programs.\n\nLiberal Arts Colleges\n\nLet’s say you’re looking for overlap between “colleges in Boston area” and “liberal arts colleges.” If this sounds like you, you’re in luck! Many of the best universities in Boston are liberal arts colleges.\n\nA liberal arts education at one of the many colleges in Boston will help prepare you for many different careers. If you want a liberal arts education and research opportunities, Boston colleges can give you the best of both worlds. Many of the larger research universities, like Harvard or BC, have smaller colleges within them focused on the liberal arts.\n\nWomen’s Colleges\n\nOne of the best universities in Boston is the nation’s top-ranked women’s college. Wellesley College is a small liberal arts college and one of the original Seven Sisters Colleges. If you’re looking at a map of Boston and wondering “where is Wellesley?” take your focus slightly west. Wellesley isn’t located in Boston proper but in Wellesley, MA, about 17 miles outside of Boston.\n\nCommunity Colleges\n\nThe list of Boston colleges and universities also includes many community colleges. These are great options for students who don’t want to or are unable to follow a traditional 4-year, full-time college schedule. We’ll take a deep dive into the community colleges in Boston, like Bunker Hill Community College, later in this article.\n\nAs you can see, there are many types of Boston colleges and universities to explore! Plus, there are plenty of reasons why students might choose one of the top universities in Boston.\n\nMaybe you’ve always dreamt of a classic New England university experience complete with colorful autumn leaves and red brick buildings. Or, you might be interested in Boston colleges and universities because of the city’s rich history. Plus, students at most Boston schools are eligible for a free membership to the city’s renowned Museum of Fine Arts—another perk of attending the best universities in Boston.\n\nWith so many colleges in Boston, you may be feeling overwhelmed—but don’t worry! Let’s take a look at just how many colleges are in Boston.\n\nHow many colleges and universities are in Boston?\n\nAccording to the Boston Redevelopment Authority, there are 35 institutions of higher education in Boston. Colleges in Boston include universities and colleges like Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern University.\n\nHowever, this number only includes the colleges in Boston proper. For a real understanding of how many colleges are in Boston, we need to look at the greater Boston area. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 85 private universities and colleges in Boston. This includes one of the best colleges in Boston, Harvard University. While Harvard is technically located in Cambridge, MA (an adjacent city), you can still consider it alongside other Boston colleges.\n\nDue to how many colleges are in Boston, Boston colleges and universities dominate the area. While Boston only has 10% of Massachusetts’ total population, it has 34% of the total college students. Boston has the 4th largest student population of any city and has an outsized percentage of students to other residents. So, no matter where you go, you’ll find yourself surrounded by Boston’s many college students.\n\nIf your “colleges in Boston area” research leads you to eventually attend a Boston college, know you won’t be alone. There are over 300,000 students at the many incredible Boston colleges and universities to share the journey with you.\n\nWhat colleges are in Boston?\n\nNow that we’ve covered the sheer number of Boston colleges and universities, you probably have more questions. You might even be wondering: what are some of the most popular colleges in Boston?\n\nTo start, let’s take a look at a quick list of colleges in Boston. If any spark your interest, we’ll go more in-depth on many of these Boston colleges and universities later!\n\nBoston College and Boston University\n\nTwo of the most popular—and most often confused—colleges in Boston are Boston College and Boston University. BC is located in Chestnut Hill, MA, which is a suburb of Boston easily reachable by the Green Line train. BU, on the other hand, is located in Boston proper. Compared to Boston University, Boston College has a smaller student population and fewer graduate students. You can think of BC as a smaller liberal arts school and BU as a larger research university.\n\nBU and BC have similar rankings, though BC comes out ahead.

Harvard is the oldest university in the United States and is located in Cambridge, MA.\n\nThough Harvard is the most prestigious, it isn’t always ranked the highest. A recent study puts MIT at the top of the list of best colleges in Boston. The MIT ranking is also above the Harvard ranking in the U.S. News list of best colleges in Massachusetts.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also known as MIT, is a STEM-focused university. MIT is a great choice for students dedicated to pursuing a career in science, math, and other technological fields.\n\nGiven that the acceptance rate for MIT is 4% and the MIT ranking is high, you might think MIT is a great school for you. However, this won’t be the case for every student. Remember, MIT provides a very specialized education. Just because it is #1 in Boston doesn’t mean it’s best suited for your academic needs.\n\nTufts University\n\nAnother of the best Boston colleges and universities is Tufts. Tufts is located in Medford and Somerville, two small cities adjacent to Boston. Out of the colleges in Boston, Tufts is a popular choice. Sometimes referred to as a “little Ivy,” Tufts’ acceptance rate is most selective at 11%.\n\nAt Tufts, students get the best of both worlds. It’s removed from the bustle of the city but close enough to easily reach Boston’s attractions via the subway system. Students get to live on an idyllic college campus with the excitement of downtown Boston mere minutes away.\n\nThis list of colleges in Boston is just a fraction of the many Boston colleges and universities that exist. For a full list of colleges in Boston, check out this page from the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nMap of Boston colleges and universities\n\nThere are so many Boston colleges and universities, it can be hard to keep track of all of them. Below is a map of colleges in Boston colleges and universities. It includes the locations of some prominent universities in Boston as well as other colleges in Massachusetts.\n\nAbove, you’ll find colleges like Boston University, Northeastern, and Berklee College of Music, one of the music colleges in Boston. Boston University has one of the largest presences in Boston and is located right on the Charles River. Northeastern is located in the heart of downtown Boston, between the Museum of Fine Arts and Boston Symphony Hall.\n\nFenway Park\n\nEmmanuel College, one of the liberal arts colleges in Boston, is one of the Colleges of the Fenway. This is a collaborative of five Boston-based colleges and universities with proximity to—you guessed it!—the famous Fenway Park.\n\nThis group of Boston schools also includes:\n\nSimmons University\n\nMassachusetts College of Art and Design\n\nMassachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Services\n\nWentworth Institute of Technology\n\nCambridge\n\nAcross the river in Cambridge, you’ll find two of the best universities in Boston (and the best colleges in Massachusetts). Harvard actually spans both sides of the Charles River—from the undergraduate campus, you can look across the river and see the Business School. You can see Harvard’s proximity to the Charles River on our map of Boston colleges and universities. In fact, many of Harvard’s undergraduate dorms, called “houses,” are located right on the river. This makes it easy for students to walk, run, or picnic by the riverside on sunny days.\n\nSomerville\n\nTo the northwest is Somerville, sometimes seen as a more “hipster” city in the greater Boston area. There, you’ll find Tufts University, one of the many Boston colleges and universities in this guide. Tufts is a great choice for students who are looking to study in a slightly more laid-back setting.\n\nThe Tufts ranking is #32 out of all universities nationally, and the Tufts ranking in Massachusetts is #3. Within the colleges and universities in Boston, Tufts is known for their popular majors, Highly regarded Tufts majors include business, nursing, and psychology. Other popular programs include their International Relations program and study abroad options at their global campuses.\n\nOutside of Boston\n\nBoston’s suburbs are also rich in colleges. Even though these schools are sometimes included in lists of Boston colleges and universities, they are not technically colleges in Boston. Schools like Wellesley College, Brandeis, Bentley University, and even Boston College are all technically in the suburbs of Boston.\n\nKeep in mind, a suburban setting doesn’t make these institutions less academically rigorous or prestigious as colleges and universities in Boston. For instance, the Boston College admissions process is very selective, and the Boston College ranking is #36 nationally. And, in Wellesley, MA, you’ll find the best women’s college in the US.\n\nFurther away from Boston, you’ll find many other great colleges in Massachusetts. The Five College Consortium is a group of five schools located in Western Massachusetts. The Five Colleges include Smith College, another prestigious women’s college, and Amherst College. If you’re wondering “where is Amherst college?” the clue is in the name. Amherst is located in Amherst, MA, and is considered one of the best liberal arts colleges in Massachusetts and the country. The Amherst college ranking is #2 in liberal arts colleges nationwide.\n\nNow that you know where to find Boston colleges and universities, let’s focus on public colleges in Boston.\n\nPublic Universities in Boston\n\nDespite the many Boston colleges and universities, there are surprisingly few public universities in Boston. So, it’s no surprise the city’s university population is weighted toward private colleges in Boston. That being said, here is a list of public colleges in Boston:\n\nLet’s look at another category of schools you might find while googling “colleges in Boston area.” Next, we’ll take a look at a different selection of the colleges and universities in Boston: private colleges in Boston.\n\nPrivate Colleges in Boston\n\nAs previously mentioned, many of the top universities in Boston are private colleges. These colleges are all unique with regard to their college location, college size, and their college rankings. They run the gamut from small to large, from urban to suburban, and from co-ed to women only.\n\nNow, you may be thinking, where is Amherst college? Amherst is located too far outside of Boston to be considered among the private universities in Boston. But, if you’re interested in going to a liberal arts school, Amherst is one of the best colleges in Massachusetts. Not only that, the Amherst college ranking is #2 out of all liberal arts colleges in the country.\n\nCommunity Colleges in Boston\n\nAs you know, colleges (no matter where they are) can be pretty expensive. In fact, colleges like Tufts and Wellesley rank in the top 10 of our list of “Most Expensive Colleges.” For this reason, students might choose to pursue an education at one of the many community colleges in Boston.\n\nHere’s a list of some notable community colleges in Boston:\n\nWhy choose a community college?\n\nCommunity college can be a great option for students for lots of different reasons. It’s always more affordable than a private college, and likely more affordable than a public school. This is especially true if you don’t live in Massachusetts and are applying as an out-of-state student.\n\nAnother benefit is that community colleges in Boston offer more flexibility with scheduling and when you take your classes. So, if you work a job or are caring for a child or family member, you can structure your schedule around your other responsibilities. Community colleges in Boston also offer transfer services to help you earn a 4-year degree after getting your associate’s degree.\n\nIs Harvard University located in Boston?\n\nThough Harvard is often considered one of the best colleges in Boston, it is technically located in Cambridge, MA. So, you could certainly say it’s one of the best colleges in the greater Boston area.\n\nHowever, Cambridge is right next to Boston, and it’s incredibly easy to access Boston from Cambridge. In just a few stops on the Red Line, you can get from Harvard into the center of Boston. As a first-year student at Harvard, Boston is right at your fingertips. Whether you want to visit the MFA, see the swan boats at the Boston Common, or catch a Red Sox game, the opportunities are endless.\n\nWhat Ivy League schools are in Boston?\n\nIf you’re searching for “colleges in Boston area” you may be wondering if Boston is home to any Ivies. Harvard is the only Ivy League school located in Boston. However, other Ivies like Yale in New Haven and Brown in Providence are fairly close by.\n\nYou can reach these schools easily by bus or train. Harvard students will often travel to Yale for games to show their school pride and root for the Harvard Crimson.\n\nRemember, the Ivy League application process can seem a bit different from that of other schools. If you’re looking for more resources on how to apply to the Ivies, CollegeAdvisor has you covered. We have resources to guide you through every step of the process, from webinars with Admissions Officers to advice on navigating application deadlines.\n\nThough there are no Ivy League colleges in Boston besides Harvard, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other stellar colleges in Boston.

You’ll notice a mix of both public and private colleges in Boston on this list. In fact, many of the Boston colleges and universities on this list are among the best in the nation.

But, what about outside of the city?\n\nLet’s shift from colleges in Boston and focus on schools that are strictly outside of the city as we focus on colleges in Boston area. Keep in mind that you don’t have to be in the city to enjoy some of the benefits of attending colleges in Boston area. In fact, you’ll find that many colleges in Massachusetts give you easy access to Boston and its opportunities.\n\nSuburban and greater metropolitan areas\n\nMany of the universities from our previous best Boston colleges and universities list actually come up again here. Harvard and MIT are both located in Cambridge, technically outside of the city of Boston. Located just across the Charles River from Boston, students have easy access to the city’s many opportunities. However, they can also enjoy the benefits of a more suburban area with parks and neighborhoods. In fact, Cambridge is often recognized as one of the best college towns in the nation.\n\nTufts, Wellesley, and Brandeis are all located in the surrounding Boston area as well. Wellesley and Brandeis are both considered to be small universities. By contrast, with over 6,000 undergraduates, Tufts is technically a medium-sized school. However, due to their suburban locations, all three of these schools have a community-campus vibe.\n\nAs you build your college list, remember to focus on the factors that matter most to you. While college rankings are important, college size and campus feel matter more when it comes to finding your college fit.\n\nOther colleges in Massachusetts\n\nHow many colleges are in Boston? Well, we’ve already seen quite a few Boston colleges and universities, including colleges in Boston area. However, what about the rest of Massachusetts? Well, New England is not only home to Boston colleges and universities but also some of the best universities in the nation.\n\nMount Holyoke, Clark University, Williams College, and Amherst College are all private liberal arts universities located in Massachusetts. All of these universities have an undergraduate enrollment of less than 3,000.
