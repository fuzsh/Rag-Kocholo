        "text": "majors: Writing and rhetoric, history\n\nminor: urban studies\n\n\"Through the interdisciplinary framework of the Urban Studies program, I have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the history, politics, economy, and social relations of the urban world. Recently, I studied abroad in Berlin, Germany with Professor of Sociology Jack Harris, where I completed a project about urban development in the city after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the future, I hope to use the well-rounded perspectives I attained in this program to fight injustice and make change in the world.\"\n\nWork with local organizations to connect with Geneva residents or attend lectures hosted by the Urban Studies Program, The School of the Environment, as well as The Fisher Center for the Study of Gender and Justice to immerse yourself within the emerging possibilities – and pitfalls – of contemporary urban change in Geneva and beyond.\n\nAt Hobart and William Smith Colleges, learning goes beyond textbooks and classrooms. You’ll gain high-impact practical experience that deepens learning and opens doors.\n\nLearn about the emergence, challenges and future solutions of life in the city.\n\nurst 210 - gentrification\n\nIntroduce yourself to the already voluminous literature on gentrification, focusing on earlier debates of the 'classical' era, such as production vs consumption explanations, to more recent theoretical developments that include planetary gentrification, commercial/retail gentrification and advanced or super gentrification.\n\nbids 207 - contemporary american cities\n\nLearn key concepts, terms and interdisciplinary approaches to studying the field of urban studies the the context of the television series The Wire.\n\nsoc 251 - Sociology of the city\n\nGain a basic introduction to urban life and culture by examining the development of the city in Western history.\n\nsoc 253 - Global Cities\n\nExplore the overarching concept of “the global city” developed in the aftermath of the restructuring of the world economy since the mid-1970s.\n\nHIST 264 – Modern European City\n\nExamine the emergence and development of new industrial cities, such as Manchester and Bochum, and the transformation of older administrative and cultural centers such as Paris and Vienna.\n\nANTH 206 – Early Cities\n\nDiscover the manner in which humankind first came to live in cities.

I had amazing professors that genuinely cared and met lifelong friends in Theta Phi Alpha, which is the only sorority on campus. HWS helped prepare me for my current occupation by being so involved in the community and placing emphasis on having input from stakeholders whenever we did projects that were based specifically on Geneva. Professor of Sociology Ervin Kosta was always extremely supportive whether I was looking for advice academically or when I was looking for jobs and trying to decide what I wanted to do. I actually gained a ton from my independent study on climate resilience through urban studies, and I will be working on getting my county a county-wide resiliency plan.\"\n\nUrban Studies students have gone on to work for the following companies:\n\nAmeriCorps\n\nBrookings Institution\n\nCity College of New York\n\nCity Year\n\nGCC/IBT District Council 3\n\nGlasow Simmons Architecture LLP\n\nLettuce Entertain You, LLC.\n\nM&T Bank\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nNYC Department of Transportation\n\nPacific Coast Banking School\n\nPepsiCo, Inc.\n\nSkidmore, Owings and Merrill\n\nStoel Rives LLP\n\nVinco Properties"
