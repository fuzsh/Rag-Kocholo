        "text": "A rich tradition of EXCELLENCE\n\nFounded in 1877, Philander Smith University is the result of the first attempt west of the Mississippi River to make education available to freedmen (former African American slaves). The forerunner of the college was Walden Seminary, named in honor of Dr. J.M. Walden, one of the originators and the first corresponding secretary of the Freedmen's Aid Society."
