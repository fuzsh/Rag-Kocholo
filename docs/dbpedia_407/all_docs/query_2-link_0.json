The new signs, when present, will be accompanied by a yellow sign below with the former exit number. For clarity, both exit numbers are provided.\n\nFrom the South: Northampton is on Route I-91 in Massachusetts. From I-91 North take Exit 23 (old exit 18) and turn left onto Route 5. Follow Route 5 into the center of town. At the intersection of Route 5 and Route 9, turn left onto Route 9 (Main Street). Go straight through four sets of traffic lights, turning left into Smithâ€™s main entrance (College Lane) shortly after the seventh set. The Office of Admission is on your right, overlooking Paradise Pond. Parking is available next to the office or along Route 9.\n\nFrom the North: From I-91 South, take Exit 26 (old exit 20), and follow onto Route 5 South into the center of town. At the intersection of Route 5 and Route 9 (Main Street), turn right onto Route 9. Then follow the same directions as above from Route 9 to campus.\n\nFrom the East or West via the Massachusetts Turnpike: Northampton is on Route I-91 North (Mass Pike exit 45 [old exit 4]). Once on I-91, follow the directions above for visitors from the south.\n\nMapping Smith?\n\nIf you're using an online map application for directions to the Office of Admission, the address is 7 College Lane, Northampton, Massachusetts 01063"
