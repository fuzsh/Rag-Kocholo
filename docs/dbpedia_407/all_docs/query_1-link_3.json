        "text": "Smith’s campus is an environment where simple physical beauty—the flaming hues of New England’s fall, the architecture of the buildings, seasonal colors reflected in Paradise Pond—is a constant source of pleasure. Every season in New England has a mood, and each brings its own activities: fall hikes in the nearby Holyoke Range; winter skating, snowshoeing and skiing; spring rowing and picnics or studying outdoors under a willow tree. At Smith, you’ll quickly acquire a distinct sense of place.\n\nWhether your passion is biology or ballet, you’ll find that the sophisticated facilities and equipment at Smith are among the best available.\n\nSmith’s library system rivals those of larger colleges with its extensive collections of books, periodicals, digital resources, microforms, maps, scores, recordings, rare books, archives and manuscripts.\n\nThe Clark Science Center is a multibuilding complex of teaching and research laboratories and classrooms, equipped with confocal, scanning and transmission electron microscopes; a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer; lasers; reflecting and refracting telescopes; and a cosmic-ray detection facility.\n\nThe Brown Fine Arts Center is the home of Smith’s renowned Museum of Art, art department and art library. Considered one of the finest college art museums in the country, the museum is known for its distinguished collection of more than 20,000 objects from all periods and cultures.\n\nThe Mendenhall Center for the Performing Arts houses outstanding theater, dance and music facilities. It includes Theatre 14, with seating for 450 and a proscenium stage served by large fly and wing spaces, and two concert spaces: the 629-seat Sweeney Concert Hall and Earle Recital Hall, a smaller, more intimate venue."
