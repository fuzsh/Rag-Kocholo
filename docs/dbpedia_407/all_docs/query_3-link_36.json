Our low tuition makes us one of the top choices for private schools in the Midwest. We are committed to Roosevelt’s founding mission, expanding inclusivity, diversity and access. It is the bedrock of our culture—and it is the right thing to do.\n\nWith more than 40 master's degree programs, Roosevelt has the program to take you where you want to go in your career. Join an upcoming information session to connect with our admission staff and learn more.\n\nIn the classroom, it’s diverse, tolerant, and academically rigorous. Outside the classroom, there’s so much to do. Whether you’re into sports, the arts, or student organizations, you can be a spectator, participant, or both. Or explore one of the best cities in the world.\n\nCheck out the campus communities that make the big city small.\n\nWhen universities take your tuition, they should take responsibility for helping you succeed. We do.\n\nWe’ll help you choose the right classes. Navigate financial aid and housing questions. Connect you to tutoring and mentors so you can grow academically. With confidence.\n\nSee how we support student safety, growth and success.\n\nAnti-Discrimination Statement\n\nRoosevelt University has been committed in its programs and activities from its inception to a policy on nondiscrimination.
