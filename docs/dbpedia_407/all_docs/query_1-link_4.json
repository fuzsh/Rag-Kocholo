        "text": "On the Smith campus, simple physical beauty—the flaming hues of New England’s fall, the campus architecture, vibrant gardens and trees, and seasonal colors reflected in Paradise Pond—is a constant source of pleasure. Every season brings its own activities: fall hikes in the nearby Holyoke Range, apple picking on Mountain Day, winter skating and skiing, spring rowing and picnics, or studying outdoors under a willow tree. At Smith, you’ll quickly acquire a distinct sense of place.\n\nYou’ll always find plenty to do, whether you’re taking part in any of the 140-plus student-run organizations, athletics programs or informal groups, all of which offer you ways to share your interests and develop new friendships.\n\nWhether your passion is biology or ballet, Smith’s facilities and equipment are among the best available. Mendenhall Center for the Performing Arts houses two theaters, dance studios and design labs. Sage Hall has two concert spaces and dozens of practice rooms. The Clark Science Center has laboratories and classrooms equipped with state-of-the-art technology. The Brown Fine Arts Center houses the art library and Smith’s renowned art museum. And Neilson Library’s renovation, designed by acclaimed designer Maya Lin, features unique spaces to support scholarship and innovation.\n\nAt Smith, you’ll find ways to carve out your own path to become your most powerful self."
