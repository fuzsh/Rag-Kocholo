        "text": "RMJM was commissioned in 2001 for the redevelopment of Adam Smith College’s St Brycedale Campus. This was a complex, multi-phase project on a live site, incorporating demolition, new build and refurbishment works.\n\nThe campus is located in the historic town centre of Kirkcaldy and RMJM’s architectural solution found a balance between the civic setting and the contemporary image of the College.\n\nA five storey glazed tower signifies the entrance to the campus, complementary in scale to the surrounding historic roof-tops and towers. Two dramatic multi-storey spaces have been created internally. ‘The Atrium’ sits within the retained listed building, whilst ‘The Street’ separates old from new."
