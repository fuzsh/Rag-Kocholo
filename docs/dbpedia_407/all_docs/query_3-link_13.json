        "text": "Based on what you are saying, you’ll enjoy Smith more. The advantages of a small liberal arts college is the intimacy of a small, select group - your classes are smaller, you’ll know your professors personally (if you want to), your dorms and dining facilities are smaller - you will see the same people daily, many people will know your name- there’s a sense of belonging and it’s easier to feel like a full community member. At a big school you are more anonymous, more of a number, there’s more impersonal bureaucracy and you can dissappear easier.\n\nWith the two schools you have options for the campus environment is totally different - BU is a city campus, very spread out and not particularly beautiful (sorry BU). Smith is a women’s college with beautiful old buildings, a lovely suburban campus and many old-style traditions.\n\nNot everyone would enjoy Smith more than BU but based on what you’re saying, it’s much more what you want."
