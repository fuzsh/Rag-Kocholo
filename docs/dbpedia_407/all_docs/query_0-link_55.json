        "text": "History\n\nNamed for the founder of Sedalia, George R. Smith College was begun in 1888 when the daughters of George R. Smith gave land to the Freedman’s Aid and Southern Education Society of the Methodist Church for a school “devoted to the moral and intellectual culture of the colored people of the west.” The main building was completed in January 1894 and classes began with 57 students. George R. Smith College received a state charter in 1903.\n\nThe college instructed students “in all those branches necessary to usefulness and happiness.” The 1895-96 catalog described the aim of the school as “to lead the youth to form and cultivate habits of accuracy, care, promptness, neatness, cleanliness, economy; to instill into their mind and heart the principles of manliness, womanliness, truthfulness, faithfulness, loyalty to principle, the dignity of honest toil of any kind, a love for learning and a taste for all that is good, and pure and right, and the true significance of life itself.” A testimony of good character was required for admission, and students were required to attend chapel daily and religious services twice weekly.\n\nGeorge R. Smith College offered courses of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree. The eight courses of study were the following: classical, philosophical, scientific, normal, commercial, English, musical and industrial. There was also a college preparatory course for students who had completed the sixth grade.\n\nStowell noted that most students were from Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma, and that some worked their way through college with jobs in Sedalia. Following graduation, many became government employees and ministers. Several entered the medical profession\n\nOn April 26, 1925, a fire destroyed the school. The Methodists were unable to provide money to rebuild, so George R. Smith College closed. During its years of operation, it had graduated 3,000 students. Records went to Philander Smith College in Arkansas.\n\nBricks and Mortar\n\nGeorge R. Smith’s gift required that a building costing at least $25,000 be constructed. The four-story red brick building measuring 126 x 105 feet was built on 24 acres in the northeast part of Sedalia. Built at a cost of $40,000, this building contained 62 rooms, Among these were the chapel, dormitory rooms for 75 students, apartments for teachers, the presidential suite, kitchen and dining hall, labs, and library. The construction superintendent for the building was a former slave.\n\nA football ground, a baseball diamond and a running track were a part of the campus.\n\nAfter the fire, a Sedalia resident purchased the brick for $100, and had a residence built from them on Cooper Street."
