        "text": "The Five Colleges\n\nWe’ve got smarts.\n\nHampshire County is home to the “Five Colleges,” which comprises Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The schools are a stone's throw away from each other, so you can swing by them all in one day and see roughly 30,000 students milling about.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? It means we’re a culturally rich, diverse area chock full of intellectualism, innovation, and ivy, where you can catch a guest lecturer, see a student play, watch a hockey game, or soak up knowledge in an historic library. And we have all the trappings you’d expect in a college town – great late-night pizza, cozy cafes, and hip bars.\n\nFor information about the Five Colleges and campus events in Western Massachusetts, browse the links below."
