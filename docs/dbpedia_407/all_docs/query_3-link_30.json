That's sad...hmm...probably my friend Sue, since she's just down the hall. :)\n\nWhen was the last time you wore a dress?\n\nA couple of days ago. The nasty weather makes me want to dress cute to compensate.\n\nWhat are you reading now?\n\nUnfortunately, I never have time to read just for fun, so only class work: Madame Bovary and Assia Djebar's Fantasia are both really hooking me, though.\n\nDo you eat fast food?\n\nYes. I love Subway so much, but I try to stay away from McDonald's.\n\nWhat do you miss most about home?\n\nBeing surrounded by conservatives and having to contstantly defend my beliefs. But of course, also my family, especially my brother—but he's never \"home\" either.\n\nWhat is your favorite movie?\n\nLes Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg), a French musical from the ’60s with Catherine Deneuve. But basically, anything French works for me: 8 Femmes, Amelie, L'Auberge Espangole, Paris Je T'aime, etc.\n\nDescribe your worst date.\n\nI've got nothing...\n\nIf you suddenly had two hours of free time, what would you do?\n\nProbably waste it away discovering new music online or watching bad TV (Top Model marathon, anyone?). But I would love to take a bike ride around Northampton or kayak down the Mill River (in warm weather, obviously) or just actually sit down and watch a movie I've been wanting to see.\n\nWhat is your favorite wall hanging in your room?\n\nI love them all, but probably the pictures I took when I visited Paris and London, or a poster for Dave Chappelle's Block Party that my brother gave me.\n\nDo you consider yourself an urban, suburban or rural person?\n\nI'm definitely of surburban origins, but I like to think that I am, or will become, urban. I'm not sure if I'm cut out to be a city dweller, though. I guess I'll have to find out next year in Paris.\n\nWhat annoys the heck out of you?\n\nGrammatical errors...but that's because I'm a copy editor. Also, complaining, especially when the individual doesn't intend to do anything about it.\n\nWho are your role models?\n\nI've never really identified with any role models. I kind of like to think I find inspiration in myself. Otherwise, I guess I'd have to say my brother. He has always been older and smarter than me.\n\nWhat single piece of advice would you give to President Christ?\n\nLISTEN to students...actually listen to them. And actually make change. Not just forums and committees. I mean real change."
