        "text": "Eight massive tapestries of foliage, each nearly 20 feet high, frame Harvard University’s Smith Campus Center, suffusing the interior space with the bright, warm colors of living plants. Sustained by rainwater collected on the building’s roof, the vertical gardens reinvent the school’s iconic ivy-covered walls to bring new life to an aging building and expand the network of campus social spaces. The Smith Campus Center houses Harvard’s information desk, making the new space one of the first stops for many visitors. Steps away from Harvard Yard, the Center brings key landscape elements inside to establish a memorable and inviting common space for students, visitors, and the community."
