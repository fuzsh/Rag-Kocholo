        "text": "Panama City\n\nLocated next to the water in Panama City, Florida, Gulf Coast State College is ready to provide you a first-class education with an emphasis on success. With some of the lowest tuition rates in Florida, Gulf Coast offers you a variety of options focused on quality and practicality.\n\nLearn More\n\nNorth Bay\n\nThe 120-acre North Bay Campus in Southport was established in 1990 to elevate law enforcement firearms and driver training in the region. In 1996, the high-tech Burn Building Training Simulator was added to enhance Firefighter training. In 1999, the Division of Public Safety moved from the Technology Building on the Panama City Campus to the Charles H. Abbott building at North Bay. In 2005, a proposal was made to use approximately 15 acres to relocate and expand the Bay County Emergency Operations Center. The joint-use facility was completed in 2010 with the opening of the Collegeâ€™s 50,000 square-foot Public Safety Building, which provides office, classroom, and training space to the Division, and is also home to the Bay County Emergency Services Department, the County 9-1-1 call/dispatch center, and the Emergency Operations Center.\n\nLearn More\n\nTyndall Air Force Base\n\nIf you are an active service member, veteran, dependent, Department of Defense employee or a civilian (general public), then you can take classes at Gulf Coast State College's Tyndall Education Center. It is conveniently located on Tyndall Air Force Base off U.S. Highway 98 .\n\nLearn More\n\nOnline\n\nCourses are delivered using technology, where the student and instructor are separated by time, space, or both. Typically, online courses do not require attendance in a physical location; however, some online classes may require in-person evaluations or activities depending on the course. Online course formats include Asynchronous, Synchronous, and Combination.\n\nLearn More"
