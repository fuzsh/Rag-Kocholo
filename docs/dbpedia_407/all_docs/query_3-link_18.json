A book of bizarre accounts of everything—very smart and funny. And Neither Here Nor There: Travels in Europe by Bill Bryson. A hilarious perspective of travels in Europe. Non-stop witty humor.\n\nDo you eat fast food?\n\nNever at McDonalds, etc. Spoleto Express is good, though!\n\nWhat do you miss most about home?\n\nMy friends, the lake in my town and how everyone feels like they're in a winter wonderland for the entire winter season.\n\nWhat is your favorite movie?\n\nMy recent favorites are Atonement and Enchanted. Old favorites include The Italian Job and Les Choristes.\n\nDescribe your worst date.\n\nThe basic gist: My friend and I were traveling for a few days after a long summer job. We were both pretty tired from it all (two months without a day off) and to add to it, he wasn't feeling wonderful one particular night. While waiting for the bill at a reasonably classy place on the water, he ended up sitting with his arm cradling his head on the table. Just imagine a tired 2-year-old in a 22-year-old body—embarassing!\n\nIf you suddenly had two hours of free time, what would you do?\n\nWhen I have free time and no pressing things to catch up with, I love getting my mountain bike out and climbing Mt. Sugarloaf!\n\nWhat is your favorite wall hanging in your room?\n\nAll of them! I have two homemade photo boards, a world map and a few posters of a few of my favorite cities.\n\nDo you consider yourself an urban, suburban or rural person?\n\nI have lived in generally rural areas but it's time for a big city next!\n\nWhat annoys the heck out of you?\n\nSkiing or ski racing in the rain.\n\nWho are your role models?\n\nDifferent people I have met through school, summer jobs and athletics. I'd give names but they wouldn't mean much without knowing the person behind the name—it's who they are and what they do that makes them role models for me.\n\nWhat single piece of advice would you give to President Christ?\n\nGet to know the students on campus."
