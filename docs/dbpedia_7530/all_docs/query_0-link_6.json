        "text": "What is the Industrial Revolution?\n\nAcross Western Europe, particularly in England and Germany, the Industrial Revolution refers to a time when once agricultural societies were transformed into industrial urban working areas. The time period sees the birth of railways, factories and a push for rights in most areas of society.\n\nThe effects of the industrial revolution are still felt, and it should be remembered that the changes of that period affected Marx as he wrote.\n\nToday, Marx's theories are widely popular, and his ideas have been developed and modernised to be applicable to contemporary society.\n\nKarl Marx’s sociology: conflict theory\n\nThe sociology which Karl Marx has contributed to sociology is known as a conflict theory. Conflict theories believe societies are in constant states of conflict, as they are in competition. Marxists and neo-Marxists alike are conflict theories.\n\nAnother sociological perspective that is referred to as a conflict theory is Feminism.\n\nProduction in a capitalist society\n\nMarxist theory departs from the mode of production in capitalist societies, which refers to the way goods are made. The mode of production is broken down into two further sections: the means of production and the social relations of production.\n\nIn capitalist society, there are two social classes. Let's look at these now.\n\nSocial classes under capitalist society\n\nThe classes which are present in a society depend on the epoch (time period) in which you’re living. According to Marx, we live in the capitalist epoch and within this epoch, there are a number of social classes.\n\nWe will run through the definitions of these social classes before delving into further Marxist theory.\n\nThe bourgeoisie\n\nThe bourgeoisie is those who own the means of production. They are the large business owners, royals, oligarchs and aristocrats. This level can be understood as the ruling capitalist class, or 1% of the population. They also own private property and pass it down to their heirs.\n\nThis is one of the two main social classes in capitalist society.\n\nThe proletariat\n\nThe proletariat consists of the workers who make up most of society's labour force. This social class must sell its labour to survive. It is the second main social class in capitalist society.\n\nThe petite bourgeoisie\n\nThe petite bourgeoisie comprises the small business owners and is the lower level of the bourgeoisie. Those belonging to this level still work, but are likely to also employ a certain number of individuals.\n\nThe lumpenproletariat\n\nThe lumpenproletariat can be considered as the underclass, the unemployables who make up the lowest level of society. They were often referred to as 'dropouts' as they sometimes sold their services to the bourgeoisie. Marx argued that the revolutionary spirit would arise from this group.\n\nCriticisms of Karl Marx\n\nNot all theorists agree with Karl Marx. Two notable theorists who did not agree with Marx are Max Weber and Émile Durkheim.\n\nBelow, we will explore both theorists in greater detail.\n\nMax Weber\n\nMax Weber is another German theorist pivotal to the study of sociology. Weber agrees with Marx that property ownership is one of the biggest dividers in society. However, Weber does not agree with the view that class divisions are primarily based on economics.\n\nWeber argues that along with class, status and power are also important in society.\n\nConsider a doctor as an example. A doctor may be of higher status than a businessman in wider society due to the prestige associated with the position, even if the businessman is wealthier.\n\nWeber was intrigued by how different groups exerted power in society.\n\nÉmile Durkheim\n\nDurkheim is another theorist that does not agree with Karl Marx. Durkheim, a functionalist, has a more positive view of society. He argued that each part of society functions like a body, working together to ensure success. Society is ultimately harmonious and functioning.\n\nFor example, the education system prepares the future lawyers of the criminal justice system who work to protect human rights and small business issues. It also prepares the doctors of the future. The whole of society cannot, and should not, be understood through the lens of economics.\n\nOther criticisms of Karl Marx\n\nCritics argue that Marx focuses too heavily on social class and overlooks other social divisions in society. For example, women and people of colour have different experiences of capitalist society than a White man."
