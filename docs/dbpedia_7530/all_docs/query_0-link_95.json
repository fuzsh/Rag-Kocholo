It will also examine the social division of labor as a civilization factor, Marx’s theory of commodity fetishism, and his explanation of the “primitive accumulation.”\n\nCritical concepts in historical materialism, such as “structure/superstructure,” “ideology,” “class consciousness,” “alienation,” and “plus value,” will also be discussed. Prominent critics of Marx will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of his ideas, including the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat."
