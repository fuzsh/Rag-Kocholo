        "text": "The Baroque residential building in which Karl Marx was born dates back to around 1727 but is now home to an exhibition devoted to the world-famous critic of Capitalism. The exhibition takes visitors on a tour, with the ground floor centring around the life of Karl Marx with a particular focus on the man himself and his family as well as his life in exile. The top floor then moves on to look in greater depth at the work Karl Marx is so famous for. All of the main areas he worked in are covered here: philosophy, sociology, economics and journalism.\n\nHis radical assessment of capitalist society and the specific theses he delivered in the 19th century are brought to life in the form of a \"living book\". The third part of the exhibition looks at how his ideas have had an impact on us over time, all the way up to the present day, touching on the labour movement and the dictatorships born as a result of his belief system. Marx's favourite armchair is also on display alongside photographs and historical documents. Opening times: Every day: 9 amâ€“6 pm"
