Simply wonderful—analytical depth, critical knowledge, clarity of comprehension and presentation, grasp of theoretical and historical contexts, combine to create a most insightful Marx biography that will be an indispensable and lasting resource that scholars and researchers, activists and critics alike, should—and will—return to frequently.” —Werner Bonefeld, University of York, UK; author, Critical Theory and the Critique of Political Economy\n\nMarx has found his perfect biographer…. Heinrich’s attitude is the same as that of Marx: DOUBT EVERYTHING, even Marx himself. Only through this critical perspective Marx’s ambiguities and contradictions can be revealed, and his greatness and legacy be reclaimed. —Riccardo Bellofiore, University of Bergamo, Italy; author, In Marx’s Laboratory: Critical Interpretations of the Grundrisse"
