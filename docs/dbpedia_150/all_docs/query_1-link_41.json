        "text": "The RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a promising approach for targeted and eco-friendly insect pest management in sustainable agriculture. The RNAi involves the silencing of specific genes through the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), leading to the degradation of complementary mRNA and subsequent reduction in the expression of targeted proteins. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and future prospects of RNAi-based strategies for insect pest control. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying RNAi, delivery methods for dsRNA, and the design and selection of effective target genes. The application of RNAi in controlling various insect pests, including lepidopterans, coleopterans, and hemipterans is extensively reviewed. also highlight the potential challenges and limitations associated with RNAi-based pest management, such as off-target effects, variable efficacy across insect species, and the development of resistance. Strategies to overcome these challenges, including the use of nanoparticle-based delivery systems and the combination of RNAi with other pest control methods, are explored. Furthermore, discuss the environmental and ecological considerations surrounding the use of RNAi in agriculture, emphasizing the importance of assessing non-target effects and the need for appropriate risk assessment frameworks. The chapter concludes by outlining future research directions and the potential for RNAi to revolutionize insect pest management, contributing to the development of sustainable and resilient agricultural systems.\n\nInsect pests pose significant challenges to agriculture, forestry, and public health, causing substantial economic losses and threats to food security. Traditional pest control methods, such as chemical insecticides, have limitations due to the development of insecticide resistance, negative impacts on non-target organisms, and environmental concerns. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a promising approach for developing targeted and environmentally safe insect control strategies. This review explores the potential of RNAi-based methods for pest management, discussing the mechanism of RNAi in insects, factors influencing its efficiency, and various delivery strategies. We highlight the advantages of RNAi, such as species-specific targeting and reduced off-target effects, while also addressing challenges and limitations, including variability in RNAi efficiency among insect species and potential resistance development. The review examines the environmental safety and risk assessment of RNAi-based insect control, current applications, and future prospects. We also discuss the socio-economic impact and public perception of RNAi technology, as well as research gaps and future directions. The integration of RNAi-based insect control into integrated pest management programs is crucial for developing sustainable and effective pest control solutions. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state and future potential of RNAi-based insect control, this review aims to inform research, policy, and practice in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nInsect-pests infestation greatly affects global agricultural production and is projected to become more severe in upcoming years. There is concern about pesticide application being ineffective due to insect resistance and environmental toxicity. Reduced effectiveness of Bt toxins also made the scientific community shift toward alternative strategies to control devastating agricultural pests. With the advent of host-delivered RNA interference, also known as host-induced gene silencing, targeted insect genes have been suppressed through genetic engineering tools to deliver a novel insect-pest resistance strategy for combating a number of agricultural pests. This review recapitulates the possible mechanism of host-delivered RNA interference (HD-RNAi), in particular, the silencing of target genes of insect-pests. We emphasize the development of the latest strategies against evolving insect targets including designing of artificial microRNAs, vector constructs, and the benefit of using plastid transformation to transform target RNA-interfering genes. Advantages of using HD-RNAi over other small RNA delivery modes and also the supremacy of HD-RNAi over the CRISPR-Cas system particularly for insect resistance have been described. However, the broader application of this technology is restricted due to its several limitations. Using artificial miRNA designs, the host-delivered RNAi + Bt combinatorial approach and chloroplast transformation can overcome limitations of RNAi. With careful design and delivery approaches, RNAi promises to be extremely valuable and effective plant protection strategy to attain durable insect-pest resistance in crops. Graphical Abstract Development of transgenic plant using novel strategies to achieve durable resistance against the target insect\n\nInsect brains play important roles in the regulation of sex-biased behaviors such as mating and oviposition. The neural structure and function of brain differences between males and females have been identified, in which the antenna lobes (AL) showed the most discrepancy, however, the whole repertoire of the genes expressed in the brains and the molecular mechanism of neural signaling and structural development are still unclear. In this study, high-throughput transcriptome analysis of male and female brains was carried on in the Asia corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, and a total of 39.23 Gb data and 34,092 unigenes were obtained. Among them, 276 genes displayed sex-biased expression by DEG analysis, of which 125 genes were highly expressed in the males and 151 genes were highly expressed in the females. Besides, by homology analysis against genes that have been confirmed to be related to brain neurodevelopment, a total of 24 candidate genes were identified in O. furnacalis. In addition, to further screen the core genes that may be important for sex-biased nerve signaling and neurodevelopment, protein-protein interaction networks were constructed for the sex-biased genes and neurodevelopment genes. We identified 10 (Mhc, Mlc1, Mlc2, Prm, Mf, wupA, TpnC25D, fln, l(2)efl, and Act5C), 11 (PPO2, GNBP3, Spn77Ba, Ppn, yellow-d2, PGRP-LB, PGRP-SD, PGRP-SC2, Hml, Cg25C, and vkg) and 8 (dac, wg, hh, ci, run, Lim1, Rbp9, and Bx) core hub genes that may be related to brain neural development from male-biased, female-biased, and neurodevelopment gene groups. Our results provide a reference for further analysis of the dimorphism of male and female brain structures in agricultural pests.\n\nRNA interference (RNAi)-based biopesticides are novel biologic products, developed using RNAi principles. They are engineered to target genes of agricultural diseases, insects, and weeds, interfering with their target gene expression so as to hinder their growth and alleviate their damaging effects on crops. RNAi-based biopesticides are broadly classified into resistant plant-based plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) and non-plant-incorporated protectants. PIP RNAi-based biopesticides are novel biopesticides that combine the advantages of RNAi and resistant transgenic crops. Such RNAi-based biopesticides are developed through nuclear or plastid transformation to breed resistant plants, i.e., dsRNA-expressing transgenic plants. The dsRNA of target genes is expressed in the plant cell, with pest and disease control being achieved through plant-target organism interactions. Here, we review the action mechanism and strategies of RNAi for pest management, the development of RNAi-based transgenic plant, and the current status and advantages of deploying these products for pest control, as well as the future research directions and problems in production and commercialization. Overall, this study aims to elucidate the current development status of RNAi-based biopesticides and provide guidelines for future research.\n\nThe western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is an annual pest of maize in the United States Corn Belt. Larval feeding on the root system can promote significant yield loss through reduced water and nutrient uptake and decreased plant stability. Various management tactics, including crop rotation, insecticides, and transgenic crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner proteins, have been used to manage WCR densities. However, resistance has evolved to each of these tactics in local areas, highlighting the need for new management strategies. The use of RNA interference (RNAi) technology for WCR management represents the next phase of species-specific pest management. This paper reviews the current knowledge of RNAi for WCR management. We present an overview of traits that have been explored and the accumulated knowledge acquired on mode of action, resistance, ecological risk assessment, and mammalian safety. We conclude by highlighting the challenges and future directions of this technology for WCR management.\n\nThe hyper‐diverse order Coleoptera comprises a staggering ~25% of known species on Earth. Despite recent breakthroughs in next generation sequencing, there remains a limited representation of beetle diversity in assembled genomes. Most notably, the ground beetle family Carabidae, comprising more than 40,000 described species, has not been studied in a comparative genomics framework using whole genome data. Here we generate a high‐quality genome assembly for Nebria riversi, to examine sources of novelty in the genome evolution of beetles, as well as genetic changes associated with specialization to high elevation alpine habitats. In particular, this genome resource provides a foundation for expanding comparative molecular research into mechanisms of insect cold adaptation. Comparison to other beetles shows a strong signature of genome compaction, with N. riversi possessing a relatively small genome (~147 Mb) compared to other beetles, with associated reductions in repeat element content and intron length. Small genome size is not, however, associated with fewer protein‐coding genes, and an analysis of gene family diversity shows significant expansions of genes associated with cellular membranes and membrane transport, as well as protein phosphorylation and muscle filament structure. Finally, our genomic analyses show that these high elevation beetles have endosymbiotic Spiroplasma, with several metabolic pathways (e.g. propanoate biosynthesis) that might complement N. riversi, although its role as a beneficial symbiont or as a reproductive parasite remains equivocal.\n\nBacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a naturally occurring entomopathogenic soil bacterium, has been the active ingredient of sprayable Bt biopesticides for over a century. Insecticidal Bt Cry proteins are particularly well suited for use as plant-incorporated protectants in transgenic crops (Bt crops) due to their specificity against insect pests and safety for non-target organisms. The sustainability of these Bt products, however, has been challenged by the development of resistance in the field. RNA interference (RNAi), a species-specific control alternative that has been deregulated and commercialized in the USA and Canada, provides a new mode of action to complement the existing Bt products. Based on our preliminary research, we hypothesized that pyramiding/integrating Bt with RNAi can address/manage resistance issues related to Bt traits. To examine this overarching hypothesis, we (1) cloned and characterized a serine/threonine kinase gene (fused) of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a global superpest; (2) profiled Pxfused expression in Bt-resistant P. xylostella strains; and (3) investigated the involvement of Pxfused in Bt Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella. Pxfused expression was elevated ubiquitously in all Bt-resistant strains, and silencing of Pxfused led to larval and pupal mortality in both Cry1Ac-susceptible and -resistant strains, suggesting that Pxfused is a potential target for RNAi-based resistance management. Taken together, our results not only identify a molecular target to control a devastating lepidopteran pest, but also shed light on a novel resistance management strategy through the integration of two biotechnological techniques with distinct modes of action."
