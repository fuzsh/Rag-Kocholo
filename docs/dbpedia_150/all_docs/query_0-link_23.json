        "text": "Okra is folate rich, a nutrient that enriches red blood vessels, protects the heart, and lowers the risk of birth defects in babies. Okra, also known as bhindi and Ladyâ€™s fingers, is a flowering plant that belongs to the mallow family,It has unique, slightly peppery taste somewhere between an aubergine and asparagus. Its main medicinal value lies in its extra ordinary mix of soluble and insoluble fibre ,which helps lower blood sugar levels ,cleanse the intestines and feed gut bacteria.\n\nThe Special Investigator probing the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Jim Obazee, has discovered 593 bank accounts located in the United States, United Kingdom and China in which the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), under Godwin Emefiele, kept Nigerian funds without authorisation by the Board and Investment Committee of the bank. The CBN Special Investigator recommends the prosecution of Mr Emefiele and at least 13 others, including his deputy governors, for alleged gross financial offences."
