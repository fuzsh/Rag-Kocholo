After feeding for several weeks, the larvae molt into the pupal stage. They pupate in the soil, and then emerge from the soil as adults in July and August.\n\nAdult rootworms are about 0.25 inches (0.635 cm) in length.\n\nrootworm damage in corn is caused by larval feeding. Newly hatched rootworms initially feed on fine corn root hairs and burrow into root tips. As the larvae grow larger, they feed on and burrow into primary roots. When corn rootworms are abundant, larval feeding often results in the pruning of roots all the way to the base of the corn stalk. Severe root injury interferes with the roots' ability to transport water and nutrients into the plant, reduces plant growth, and results in reduced grain production, thereby often drastically reducing overall yield. Severe root injury also often results in lodging of corn plants, which makes harvest more difficult and further decreases yield. Furthermore, feeding by adults on the corn reproductive tissues can result in pruning of silks at the ear tip. If this \"silk clipping\" is severe enough during pollen shed, pollination may be disrupted.\n\nControl of corn rootworms may be attempted by crop rotation, chemical insecticides, biopesticides â e.g., the spore-forming gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis), transgenic plants that express Bt toxins, or a combination thereof.\n\nCrop rotation suffers from the disadvantage of placing unwanted restrictions upon the use of farmland.\n\noviposition of some rootworm species may occur in crop fields other than corn or extended diapause results in egg hatching over multiple years, thereby mitigating the effectiveness of crop rotation practiced with corn and soybean.\n\nChemical insecticides are the most heavily relied upon strategy for achieving corn rootworm control. Chemical insecticide use, though, is an imperfect corn rootworm control strategy; over $1 billion may be lost in the United States each year due to corn rootworm when the costs of the chemical insecticides are added to the costs of the rootworm damage that may occur despite the use of the insecticides. High populations of larvae, heavy rains, and improper application of the insecticide(s) may all result in inadequate corn rootworm control. Furthermore, the continual use of insecticides may select for insecticide-resistant rootworm strains, as well as raise significant environmental concerns due to the toxicity to non-target species.\n\nStink bugs and other hemipteran insects are another important agricultural pest complex.\n\nstink bugs are known to cause crop damage.\n\nMcPherson & McPherson (2000) Stink bugs of economic importance in America north of Mexico, CRC Press.\n\nHemipteran insects are present in a large number of important crops including maize, soybean, fruit, vegetables, and cereals.\n\nStink bugs go through multiple nymph stages before reaching the adult stage. The time to develop from eggs to adults is about 30-40 days. Both nymphs and adults feed on sap from soft tissues into which they also inject digestive enzymes causing extra-oral tissue digestion and necrosis. Digested plant material and nutrients are then ingested. Depletion of water and nutrients from the plant vascular system results in plant tissue damage. Damage to developing grain and seeds is the most significant as yield and germination are significantly reduced. Multiple generations occur in warm climates resulting in significant insect pressure. Current management of stink bugs relies on insecticide treatment on an individual field basis. Therefore, alternative management strategies are urgently needed to minimize ongoing crop losses.\n\nRNA interference is a process utilizing endogenous cellular pathways, whereby an interfering RNA (iRNA) molecule (e.g. , a dsRNA molecule) that is specific for all, or any portion of adequate size, of a target gene sequence results in the degradation of the mRNA encoded thereby.\n\niRNA interfering RNA\n\nRNAi has been used to perform gene \"knockdown\" in a number of species and experimental systems; for example, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants, insect embryos, and cells in tissue culture. See, e.g., Fire et al. (1998) Nature 391:806-811; Martinez et al. (2002) Cell 110:563-574; McManus and Sharp (2002) Nature Rev. Genetics 3:737-747.\n\nRNAi accomplishes degradation of mRNA through an endogenous pathway including the DICER protein complex.\n\nDICER cleaves long dsRNA molecules into short fragments of approximately 20 nucleotides, termed small interfering RNA (siRNA).\n\nthe siRNA is unwound into two single- stranded RNAs: the passenger strand and the guide strand.\n\nthe passenger strand is degraded, and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).\n\nRISC RNA-induced silencing complex\n\nmiRNA Micro ribonucleic acid\n\nPost- transcriptional gene silencing occurs when the guide strand binds specifically to a complementary sequence of an mRNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute, the catalytic component of the RISC complex. This process is known to spread systemically throughout some eukaryotic organisms despite initially limited concentrations of siRNA and/or miRNA such as plants, nematodes, and some insects.\n\nU.S. Patent No. 7,612,194 and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2007/0050860, 2010/0192265, and 2011/0154545 disclose a library of 9112 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences isolated from D. v. virgifera LeConte pupae.

The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleotide or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. A sequence that is identical at every position in comparison to a reference sequence is said to be 100% identical to the reference sequence, and vice-versa.\n\nNCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information\n\nBLASTTM Basic Local Alignment Search Tool\n\nBethesda, MD National Center for Biotechnology Information\n\nBlastn Blastn\n\nSpecifically hybridizable/Specifically complementary are terms that indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between the nucleic acid molecule and a target nucleic acid molecule.\n\nHybridization between two nucleic acid molecules involves the formation of an anti-parallel alignment between the nucleic acid sequences of the two nucleic acid molecules. The two molecules are then able to form hydrogen bonds with corresponding bases on the opposite strand to form a duplex molecule that, if it is sufficiently stable, is detectable using methods well known in the art.\n\na nucleic acid molecule need not be 100% complementary to its target sequence to be specifically hybridizable. However, the amount of sequence complementarity that must exist for hybridization to be specific is a function of the hybridization conditions used.\n\nHybridization conditions resulting in particular degrees of stringency will vary depending upon the nature of the hybridization method of choice and the composition and length of the hybridizing nucleic acid sequences. Generally, the temperature of hybridization and the ionic strength (especially the Na + and/or Mg \"1\"1\" concentration) of the hybridization will determine the stringency of hybridization. The ionic strength of the wash buffer and the wash temperature also influence stringency. Calculations regarding hybridization conditions required for attaining particular degrees of stringency are known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are discussed, for example, in Sambrook et al. (ed.) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2 nd ed., vol.\n\nstringent conditions encompass conditions under which hybridization will occur only if there is more than 80% sequence match between the hybridization molecule and a homologous sequence within the target nucleic acid molecule.\n\nStringent conditions include further particular levels of stringency.\n\nâmoderate stringencyâ conditions are those under which molecules with more than 80% sequence match (i.e., having less than 20% mismatch) will hybridize; conditions of \"high stringencyâ are those under which sequences with more than 90% match (i.e. having less than 10% mismatch) will hybridize; and conditions of \"very high stringencyâ are those under which sequences with more than 95% match (i.e., having less than 5% mismatch) will hybridize.\n\nHigh Stringency condition detects sequences that share at least 90% sequence identity: Hybridization in 5x SSC buffer at 65Â°C for 16 hours; wash twice in 2x SSC buffer at room temperature for 15 minutes each; and wash twice in 0.5x SSC buffer at 65Â°C for 20 minutes each.\n\nModerate Stringency condition detects sequences that share at least 80% sequence identity: Hybridization in 5x-6x SSC buffer at 65-70Â°C for 16-20 hours; wash twice in 2x SSC buffer at room temperature for 5-20 minutes each; and wash twice in lx SSC buffer at 55- 70Â°C for 30 minutes each.\n\nNon-stringent control condition sequences that share at least 50% sequence identity will hybridize: Hybridization in 6x SSC buffer at room temperature to 55Â°C for 16-20 hours; wash at least twice in 2x-3x SSC buffer at room temperature to 55 Â°C for 20-30 minutes each.\n\nnucleic acid molecules having sequences that are substantially homologous to a reference nucleic acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: l, 3, 5, and 80 are those nucleic acid molecules that hybridize under stringent conditions (e.g. , the Moderate Stringency conditions set forth, supra) to the reference nucleic acid.\n\nSubstantially homologous sequences may have at least 80% sequence identity.\n\nsubstantially homologous polynucleotides may have from about 80% to 100% sequence identity, such as 79%; 80%; about 81%; about 82%; about 83%; about 84%; about 85%; about 86%; about 87%; about 88%; about 89%; about 90%; about 91%; about 92%; about 93%; about 94% about 95%; about 96%; about 97%; about 98%; about 98.5%; about 99%; about 99.5%; and about 100%.\n\nthe property of substantial homology is closely related to specific hybridization.\n\na nucleic acid molecule is specifically hybridizable when there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the nucleic acid to non-target sequences under conditions where specific binding is desired, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions.\n\northolog refers to a gene in two or more species that has evolved from a common ancestral nucleotide sequence, and may retain the same function in the two or more species.\n\nnucleic acid sequence molecules are said to exhibit \"complete complementarity\" when every nucleotide of a sequence read in the 5' to 3' direction is complementary to every nucleotide of the other sequence when read in the 3' to 5' direction.\n\na nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a reference nucleotide sequence will exhibit a sequence identical to the reverse complement sequence of the reference nucleotide sequence.\n\noperably linked nucleic acid sequences are generally contiguous, and, where necessary, two protein-coding regions may be joined in the same reading frame (e.g., in a translationally fused ORF).\n\nnucleic acids need not be contiguous to be operably linked.\n\noperably linked when used in reference to a regulatory sequence and a coding sequence, means that the regulatory sequence affects the expression of the linked coding sequence.\n\nregulatory sequences or âcontrol elementsâ, refer to nucleotide sequences that influence the timing and level/amount of transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences may include promoters; translation leader sequences; introns; enhancers; stem-loop structures; repressor binding sequences; termination sequences; polyadenylation recognition sequences; etc. Particular regulatory sequences may be located upstream and/or downstream of a coding sequence operably linked thereto. Also, particular regulatory sequences operably linked to a coding sequence may be located on the associated complementary strand of a double- stranded nucleic acid molecule.\n\npromoter refers to a region of DNA that may be upstream from the start of transcription, and that may be involved in recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and other proteins to initiate transcription.\n\na promoter may be operably linked to a coding sequence for expression in a cell, or a promoter may be operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal sequence which may be operably linked to a coding sequence for expression in a cell.\n\na âplant promoterâ may be a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plant cells.\n\npromoters under developmental control include promoters that preferentially initiate transcription in certain tissues, such as leaves, roots, seeds, fibers, xylem vessels, tracheids, or sclerenchyma. Such promoters are referred to as \"tissue-preferredâ. Promoters which initiate transcription only in certain tissues are referred to as âtissue-specificâ. A \"cell type- specific\" promoter primarily drives expression in certain cell types in one or more organs, for example, vascular cells in roots or leaves.\n\nAn âinducibleâ promoter may be a promoter which may be under environmental control. Examples of environmental conditions that may initiate transcription by inducible promoters include anaerobic conditions and the presence of light.\n\nTissue-specific, tissue-preferred, cell type specific, and inducible promoters constitute the class of \"non- constitutive\" promoters.\n\na âconstitutiveâ promoter is a promoter which may be active under most environmental conditions or in most tissue or cell types.\n\nany inducible promoter can be used in some embodiments of the invention.

Modifications in RNA structure may be tailored to allow specific inhibition.\n\ndsRNA molecules may be modified through a ubiquitous enzymatic process so that siRNA molecules may be generated. This enzymatic process may utilize an RNase III enzyme, such as DICER in eukaryotes, either in vitro or in vivo. See Elbashir et al. (2001) Nature 411:494- 498; and Hamilton and Baulcombe (1999) Science 286(5441):950-952.\n\nDICER or functionally- equivalent RNase â enzymes cleave larger dsRNA strands and/or hpRNA molecules into smaller oligonucleotides (e.g., siRNAs), each of which is about 19-25 nucleotides in length.\n\nthe siRNA molecules produced by these enzymes have 2 to 3 nucleotide 3' overhangs, and 5' phosphate and 3' hydroxyl termini.\n\nthe siRNA molecules generated by RNase â enzymes are unwound and separated into single- stranded RNA in the cell. The siRNA molecules then specifically hybridize with RNA sequences transcribed from a target gene, and both RNA molecules are subsequently degraded by an inherent cellular RNA-degrading mechanism.\n\nsiRNA molecules produced by endogenous RNase III enzymes from heterologous nucleic acid molecules may efficiently mediate the down-regulation of target genes in coleopteran and/or hemipteran pests.\n\na nucleic acid molecule of the invention may include at least one non-naturally occurring nucleotide sequence that can be transcribed into a single- stranded RNA molecule capable of forming a dsRNA molecule in vivo through intermolecular hybridization.\n\ndsRNA sequences typically self-assemble, and can be provided in the nutrition source of a coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest to achieve the post- transcriptional inhibition of a target gene.\n\na nucleic acid molecule of the invention may comprise two different non-naturally occurring nucleotide sequences, each of which is specifically complementary to a different target gene in a coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest.\n\na nucleic acid molecule is provided as a dsRNA molecule to a coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest, the dsRNA molecule inhibits the expression of at least two different target genes in the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest.\n\na variety of native sequences in coleopteran and/or hemipteran pests may be used as target sequences for the design of nucleic acid molecules of the invention, such as iRNAs and DNA molecules encoding iRNAs. Selection of native sequences is not, however, a straight-forward process. Only a small number of native sequences in the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest will be effective targets. For example, it cannot be predicted with certainty whether a particular native sequence can be effectively down-regulated by nucleic acid molecules of the invention, or whether down-regulation of a particular native sequence will have a detrimental effect on the growth, viability, proliferation, and/or reproduction of the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest.\n\ncoleopteran and/or hemipteran pest sequences such as ESTs isolated therefrom (for example, as listed in U.S. Patent No. 7,612,194 and U.S. Patent. No. 7,943,819), do not have a detrimental effect on the growth, viability, proliferation, and/or reproduction of the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest, such as WCR, NCR, SCR, BSB, Nezara viridula, Piezodorus guildinii, Halyomorpha halys, Chinavia hilare, Euschistus servus, Dichelops melacanthus, Dichelops furcatus, Edessa meditabunda, Thyanta perditor, Chinavia marginatum, Horcias nobilellus, Taedia stigmosa, Dysdercus peruvianus, Neomegalotomus parvus, Leptoglossus zonatus, Niesthrea sidae\n\nnucleic acid molecules of the invention â e.g., dsRNA molecules to be provided in the host plant of a coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest\n\ntarget cDNA sequences that encode proteins or parts of proteins essential for coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest survival, such as amino acid sequences involved in metabolic or catabolic biochemical pathways, cell division, reproduction, energy metabolism, digestion, host plant recognition, and the like.\n\ningestion of compositions by a target organism containing one or more dsRNAs, at least one segment of which is specifically complementary to at least a substantially identical segment of RNA produced in the cells of the target pest organism can result in the death or other inhibition of the target.\n\na nucleotide sequence, either DNA or RNA, derived from a coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest can be used to construct plant cells resistant to infestation by the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pests.\n\nthe host plant of the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest â e.g., Z. mays or G. max), for example, can be transformed to contain one or more of the nucleotide sequences derived from the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest as provided herein.\n\nthe nucleotide sequence transformed into the host may encode one or more RNAs that form into a dsRNA sequence in the cells or biological fluids within the transformed host, thus making the dsRNA available if/when the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest forms a nutritional relationship with the transgenic host. This may result in the suppression of expression of one or more genes in the cells of the coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest, and ultimately death or inhibition of its growth or development.\n\na gene is targeted that is essentially involved in the growth, development and reproduction of a coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest.\n\nOther target genes for use in the present invention may include, for example, those that play important roles in coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest viability, movement, migration, growth, development, infectivity, establishment of feeding sites and reproduction.\n\na target gene may therefore be a housekeeping gene or a transcription factor.\n\na native coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest nucleotide sequence for use in the present invention may also be derived from a homolog (e.g.\n\nan ortholog of a plant, viral, bacterial or insect gene, the function of which is known to those of skill in the art, and the nucleotide sequence of which is specifically hybridizable with a target gene in the genome of the target coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest.\n\nMethods of identifying a homolog of a gene with a known nucleotide sequence by hybridization are known to those of skill in the art.\n\nthe invention provides methods for obtaining a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence for producing an iRNA (e.g. , dsRNA, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, and hpRNA) molecule.\n\nan iRNA e.g. , dsRNA, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, and hpRNA\n\nOne such embodiment comprises: (a) analyzing one or more target gene(s) for their expression, function, and phenotype upon dsRNA-mediated gene suppression in a coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest; (b) probing a cDNA or gDNA library with a probe comprising all or a portion of a nucleotide sequence or a homolog thereof from a targeted coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest that displays an altered (e.g.\n\nstep (c) identifying a DNA clone that specifically hybridizes with the probe; (d) isolating the DNA clone identified in step (b); (e) sequencing the cDNA or gDNA fragment that comprises the clone isolated in step (d), wherein the sequenced nucleic acid molecule comprises all or a substantial portion of the RNA sequence or a homolog thereof; and (f) chemically synthesizing all or a substantial portion of a gene sequence, or a siRNA or miRNA or shRNA or hpRNA or mRNA or dsRNA.\n\na method for obtaining a nucleic acid fragment comprising a nucleotide sequence for producing a substantial portion of an iRNA (e.g., dsRNA, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, and hpRNA) molecule includes: (a) synthesizing first and second oligonucleotide primers specifically complementary to a portion of a native nucleotide sequence from a targeted coleopteran and/or hemipteran pest; and (b) amplifying a cDNA or gDNA insert present in a cloning vector using the first and second oligonucleotide primers of step (a), wherein the amplified nucleic acid molecule comprises a substantial portion of a siRNA or shRNA or miRNA or hpRNA or mRNA or dsRNA molecule.\n\niRNA e.g., dsRNA, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, and hpRNA\n\nNucleic acids of the invention can be isolated, amplified, or produced by a number of approaches.\n\nan iRNA e.g., dsRNA, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, and hpRNA\n\na target nucleic acid sequence e.g., a target gene or a target transcribed non-coding sequence\n\nDNA or RNA may be extracted from a target organism, and nucleic acid libraries may be prepared therefrom using methods known to those ordinarily skilled in the art.\n\ngDNA or cDNA libraries generated from a target organism may be used for PCR amplification and sequencing of target genes.\n\na confirmed PCR product may be used as a template for in vitro transcription to generate sense and antisense RNA with minimal promoters.\n\nnucleic acid molecules may be synthesized by any of a number of techniques (See, e.g., Ozaki et al.
