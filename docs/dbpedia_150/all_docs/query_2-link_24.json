        "text": "The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) said Tuesday that the sewage treatment plant located in Wupa district, Abuja, was functioning properly.\n\nFelix Obuah, the coordinator of the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC), FCTA, stated this after inspecting the facility in Wupa and a dumpsite at Gosa in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nMr Obuah explained that he was at the facility to verify a report alleging that the facility had collapsed, causing leakage that could cause an outbreak of cholera.\n\n“I woke up Tuesday morning to read a disturbing misinformation in the form of a story that the main sewage treatment plant in the FCT has collapsed,” said Mr Obuah.\n\nHe added, “I quickly called the director of Abuja Environmental Protection Board to ascertain the veracity of the story, and he said it was not true. To be extra sure, I decided to come unannounced to the treatment plant to see things for myself.\n\n“I can tell you from what I have seen this morning that all the sections of the plant are working perfectly. All staff and hands are all working at their duty posts.”\n\nHe said there was no breakdown in the plant or any leakage of the main sewage line.\n\nThe coordinator advised residents of the territory not to panic, assuring that the maintenance of critical infrastructures was top-notch in Abuja.\n\n“The workers of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board are experts in the management of wastes and that is why no cholera outbreak has been recorded in the FCT.\n\n“I am satisfied with what I saw at the treatment plant. What was published this morning is the activity of mischief makers who just want to create panic where there is none,” he said.\n\nMr Obuah called on residents to disregard the story and go about their normal businesses, stressing that no leakage or pollution could lead to a cholera outbreak.\n\nOn Monday, the Environmental Health Officers Association of Nigeria (EHOAN), FCT chapter, raised the alarm over an alleged collapse of a main sewage line in the nation’s capital.\n\nEHOAN president Ismaila Dankog made the call in an interview on Monday. He urged the FCT Minister, Nyesom Wike, to prioritise the matter and take decisive measures to prevent a public health crisis in Abuja.\n\nMr Dankogi highlighted the severe risks posed by the incident, especially given the ongoing Cholera outbreak in the country.\n\nHe emphasised the increased risk of cholera transmission due to the damaged sewage infrastructure, warning of potentially catastrophic consequences if the situation remained unaddressed.\n\nHe outlined several critical concerns, including the possibility of a large-scale outbreak, compromised environmental health services, economic challenges, and potential loss of life.\n\nMr Dankogi called for immediate action, including a thorough investigation into the cause of the sewage line collapse and data collection from the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB).\n\nThe health expert also recommended engaging reputable contractors to repair the damaged sewage network and prevent further environmental contamination.\n\n“There is a need for the implementation of emergency measures to contain the cholera spread, including the provision of safe water by the water board, enhanced sanitation and hygiene facilities, and other preventive measures,” he said.\n\nMr Dankogi affirmed EHOAN’s readiness to collaborate with the minister and agencies for a swift response, emphasising that prompt action was vital to protect FCT residents’ health.\n\nMeanwhile, the AEPB cautioned Abuja residents against improper waste disposal practices threatening the integrity of the city’s sewage system.\n\nNdidi Emma-Agbodike, an assistant director at Wupa Basin Treatment Plant, AEPB, urged the residents to avoid dumping solid waste into sewer manholes, which is crucial for sewage flow and preventing spillage.\n\nAccording to him, improper waste disposal practices are becoming alarming in the territory, thereby increasing the level of blockages of the sewer system.\n\n(NAN)"
