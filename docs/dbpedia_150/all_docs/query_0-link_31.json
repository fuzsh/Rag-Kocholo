        "text": "Rural rivers play an important role as a major water supply in most parts of Northern Nigeria. Wanzum River is a major source of water to nearby communities. It serves various purposes, such as source of drinking water, fishing, irrigation and other domestic purpose. In this study, we explored the impact of human activities on macroinvertebrates assemblage and physicochemical data to ascertain the water quality status of the river. Samples of Physicochemical parameters and macroinvertebrates were collected from four (4) different stations for 12 months (December 2021-November 2022) using standard methods and procedures. The result of all the physicochemical data measured showed no significant (P>0.05) difference among the sampling stations except dissolved oxygen and turbidity. However, all the monitored physicochemical parameters differed significantly (P < 0.05) among the sampling months except dissolved oxygen. A total of 1385 individuals from 36 macroinvertebrates species were collected from all the sampled stations. Hemiptera had highest number with 760 individuals, Coleoptera (228 individuals), Odonata (138 individuals) and Trichoptera (3 individuals). The constructed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) correlation matrix was able to separate the perturbed and the less perturbed stations from each other as station1 and 4 which were the less perturbed, correlated positively with PCA axis 1. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) result showed little or no positive correlation between macroinvertebrate assemblages and the measured environmental variables as eigen value of both CCA axis is less than 1 (<1). The low abundance of Pollution sensitive taxa such as the Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera, as well as the high abundance of Hemiptera, and Coleoptera indicate that Wanzum River is being stressed along its course. Obviously, sampling stations 2 and 3 showed this stress as they recorded no members of Trichoptera group.\n\nWater is one of the most precious natural resources and it is essential for all form of life, despite the importance of water to human, anthropogenic activities have result to significant pressure on water bodies around the world. This study was aimed to check the water quality status of River Wanzum using physicochemical characteristics. Samples were collected and analyzed using standard methods and procedure for a period of 24 month (December 2021 to November 2023). The result of the study showed mean air temperature (24.62±0.20°C to 25.98±0.28°C), water temperature (23.99±0.42°C to 24.90±0.50°C), water depth (49.50±4.78 to 57.16±4.52cm), flow velocity (0.07±0.01 to 0.10±0.01m/s), turbidity (124.75±1.37 to 141.33±3.75 NTU), pH (6.83±0.10 to 7.01±0.11), Conductivity (68.16±6.05to 76.50±7.22 µS/cm), total alkalinity (23.50±0.83 to 24.75±1.50mg/L), total hardness (31.00±1.51 to 33.75±2.26 mg/L), dissolved oxygen (5.80±0.91 to 6.45±0.12mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (3.70±0.18 to 4.22±0.30 mg/L), chemical oxygen demand (4.59 ± 0.14mg/L to 4.94±0.21mg/L), nitrate (0.98±0.23 to 1.17±0.28 mg/L) and phosphate (0.33±0.09 to 0.55±0.13 mg/L). Out of all the measured values, only the dissolved oxygen and air temperature indicated a significant difference (p<0.05), with the remaining parameters demonstrating no discernible variation between the examined stations. With the exception of dissolved oxygen, every parameter examined in this study varied considerably (p<0.05) between the sampling months. The year-round farming practices along the River Wanzum have resulted in a shift in physicochemical factors, which may eventually hinder the effectiveness of using river water for residential purposes.\n\nDiatoms are widely utilised as excellent environmental indicators due to their ability to react to a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological changes that take place in the aquatic environment. This study was carried out to investigate some aspects of the ecology of diatoms in relation to environmental variables in Landzu River Bida, Niger state Nigeria. Samples were collected from five (5) sampling station and analysed using standard methods and procedures. The results show water temperature (23. mg/l). All the physicochemical variables measured show no significant (p>0.05) difference between the sampling stations except depth, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, phosphate and total dissolved solids which differ significantly (p<0.05) among the sampling stations while all the heavy metal differs significantly (p<0.05) between the sampling stations except magnesium and nickel. A total of 2499 individual organisms from 25 species were identified. Station 2 had the highest number of individuals with 561 organisms, followed by station 5 with 511 organisms while station 4 had 505 organisms. Station 1 had 481 organisms, while station 3 had the lowest with 441 organisms. The study shows diatom assemblage is influenced by human activities.\n\nEmu is a tropical stream in Northcentral Nigeria that serves as the water source for drinking and other domestic activities for Kusotachin communities, Niger State, Nigeria. This study evaluates the impact of anthropogenic activities on the ecological health of the stream using physicochemical parameters and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Macroinvertebrates were collected for a period of 8 months (July 2021 to February 2022) using modified kick sampling techniques, and the physicochemical parameters were determined using standard sampling and analytical procedures. Samples were collected from four different stations which are characterized by various anthropogenic activities across the stream bed. With the exception of depth, the measured physicochemical parameters showed no significant (P>0.05) difference between the sampling stations. However, there were significant (P<0.05) differences in air temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, total hardness, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, phosphate, and nitrate between the sampling months. A total of 506 individuals, from 30 species in eight groups of macroinvertebrates were identified. Hemiptera were the most represented group with 57.07% abundance, followed by Odonata with 27.44%, Arachnida (4.14%), Coleoptera (3.93%), Ephemeroptera (2.55%), Diptera (2.17%), Mollusca (1.38) % and the least abundance was 0.19% observed in Decapoda and Oligochaeta. The Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed little or no correlations between the determined macroinvertebrates and physicochemical parameters. CCA axis 1 accounted for 44.94% of the variation of the macroinvertebrates data set with an Eigenvalue of 0.30. CCA axis 2 accounts for 30.5% of data set of macroinvertebrates and an Eigenvalue of 0.20 while CCA axis 3 accounts for 24.55% variation in data set with an Eigenvalue of 0.16. Overall, the low abundance of Ephemeroptera and the absence of other pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate groups such as Plecoptera and Trichoptera, combined with deteriorating surface water quality, is an indication of pollution stress caused by various anthropogenic activities as the vegetative nature of the stream was the primary factor responsible for the macroinvertebrate assemblage structure.\n\nClean and quality water is of public health importance especially in developing countries like Nigeria where access to clean water is lacking in rural areas. The presence and abundance of some bacteria species are known indicators of unhealthy nature of water bodies that are subjected to environmental pollution (especially anthropogenic activities). Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the bacteria diversity of surface water in Emu stream in North-central Nigeria for a period of Eight (8) months using standard methods and procedure. Water samples were collected from four different sampling stations. The highest mean bacterial colony count of 5.4×10 3 CFU/ml was recorded in station 2, while the least value of 4.3×10 3 CFU/ml was recorded in station 4. A total of Ten (10) species of bacteria comprising nine (9) Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Campylobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Shigella spp., Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Aeromonas spp.) bacteria and one (1) Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacterium were isolated and identified. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the commonest isolates. Station 2 and 3 recorded the highest number (8) of bacteria diversity, whereas station 4 recorded the least number of 4 isolates. The presence of these isolate is an indication that the water is polluted and people consuming the water are at risk of water borne bacterial infectious diseases. Therefore, proper water treatment mechanisms are encouraged to be put in place before its consumption.\n\nOne of the biological components that play a vital role in the ecological integrity of an aquatic ecosystem is zooplankton. These organisms are good indicators of stressors, especially anthropogenic stressors in their environment. Thus, there is a need to study the diversity in a diversified freshwater lake (Dangana Lake) in order to provide baseline information and knowledge on the status of the lake for proper and adequate water preservation and conservation. In addition to the zooplankton structure determination, the study also examined the physicochemical parameters of the Lake. Three sampling sites were identified with distinct characteristics where water and zooplankton samples were collected for physicochemical analyses and biotic identification using standard protocols. Sampling was conducted for a duration of eight months. The monitored physicochemical parameters, i.e., temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and pH revealed no significant difference (p>0.05) among sampling sites. However, significance (p<0.05) amongst sampling sites was recorded in electrical conductivity, nitrate and phosphate. Seasonally, there was a significant difference (p<0.05) among sampling months in all the monitored parameters. A total of ten species of zooplankton were recorded with four species each of rotifera and copepoda and two species of cladocera. The order of abundance of zooplankton population was rotifera (56.39%), copepoda (29.18%) and cladocera (14.42%). Zooplankton population was significantly (p<0.05) higher during the dry season than in the rainy season. The Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed a strong correlation between the zooplankton and physicochemical parameters. Ipso-facto, the lake exhibited spatiotemporal changes in zooplankton composition and physicochemical parameters during the sampling period."
