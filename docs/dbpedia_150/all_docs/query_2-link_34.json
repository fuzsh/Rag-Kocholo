        "text": "Water remains the most useful universal solvent to human being and other animals, because of its derivative importance. However, effort to improve on raw water treatment would continue to be a subject of concern, because the process procedures are been violated or not properly upheld. This study was carried out in order to identify peculiar problems associate with water treatment at the Maiduguri Water Treatment Plant (MWTP). This research study was based on prompt time-schedules and plant site-visits, interviewed questions were made and accessing the technology adopted in the process stages. Analytical data were obtained through the use of sampling bottles, camera, record sheets and other necessary laboratory equipment. The analysis showed that treated water contained excess chlorine and aluminum with 1.10mg/l and 0.68mg/l respectively. From this study, the following are the root causes: poor facility lay out, poor organizational and functional structures, wear of pump impellers and surface deterioration in the transmission line, lack of calibration test, constant head system not operation properly, lack of jar test conduction, improper maintenance of filter system, and the use of chemical coagulant. Inferences were made at the end of the research to enhance process efficiency, healthier and more economical treatment MWTP.\n\nThis paper assesses the environmental impact of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Cameroon Real Estate Company (CRE) camp in the \"Cité-Verte\" district in Yaoundé (Cameroon) and the causes of its malfunction. The study was carried out in two stages. The first stage consisted of describing the wastewater treatment steps of the WWTP, and analyzing the staff interviews in order to determine the causes of malfunction that had been suspected. The second phase consisted of collecting water samples at the entry of the WWTP (P1), inside the WWTP (P2), and at the outlet of the WWTP (P3). This, in order to produce a list of the WWTP's collecting systems, characterize the various types of wastewater (P1 and P2) and the treated wastewater (P3), and then determine the effect of effluent discharges on the environment. Finally, the structural and operational malfunctions of WWTP are identified using the Ishikawa and the Pareto diagrams. The results of water characterization show that the mean values of pH (7.7), EC (1059.3 μS/cm), TDS (524.6 mg/L), T° (23.6 °C), BOD5 (10.8 mg/LO2), NO3- (2.3 mg/L), and fecal coliforms (447.3 CFU/100 mL) are below the acceptable limit values of the Cameroonian standard of treated wastewater discharge. However, the mean values of TSS (269.3 mg/L), PO43- (1661.6 mg/L), K+ (1220.6 mg/L) and Escherichia coli (10133.3 CFU/100 mL) exceed the recommended values set by the Cameroonian standard of treated wastewater discharge. The values of the wastewater parameters at the sampling point P3 are globally lower than those at the sampling point P1 but higher than Cameroon’s standard for PO4 3- and K+. These results demonstrated that the current system (filters and plants) is appropriate but not optimal. The Pareto diagram reveals that the inadequate plant controls, unfavorable working conditions, lack of maintenance and systematic control, and outdated equipment represent 20% of the causes responsible for 80% of the WWTP's malfunction. Therefore, the implementation of corrective and preventive measures is essential for better monitoring and determinization of the optimal performance of the WWTP of the CRE camp in the \"Cité-Verte\".\n\nEthically, the aesthetic view of a particular atmosphere, surrounding or environment depends on its decent hygienic state. This is so for the reason that, when an environment, surrounding, or atmosphere is hygienic the lives of those in that community are not threatened by pollution, illness and disease, in that way creating a sustainable environment. If wastewater is not appropriately managed it might turn out to be a point source of pollution will be a threat for the health of human populations and the environment. This research was carried out with the aim which probably of assessing the quality and quantity of wastewater released to the environment, to determine the constituents of wastewater through experimental laboratory analysis. Laboratory analysis was taken from different point in ABUAD, Various laboratory test such as DO, PH, BOD, COD, Turbidity, total hardness, calcium carbonate hardness, alkalinity, and ammonia, which was properly carried out following due procedure and analysed properly. These results shows that majority of the test carried out for was unsatisfactory according to standards. From the laboratory experiments carried out, it can be concluded from the result that Bakery:\n\nIntroduction. Access to safe drinking water is essential to health, and it is a basic human right. However, drinking water treatment plant efficiency and its water quality are not well investigated in low-income countries including Ethiopia. Methods. A laboratorybased cross-sectional study was conducted among 75 water samples. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 22 to generate descriptive statistics, and one-way ANOVA was used to test statistically significant difference. Results. Physicochemical qualities of the water samples from tap water sources were found to be pH (6.88 ± 0.05), turbidity (5.15 ± 0.006 NTU), electrical conductivity (170.6 ± 0.1 μS/cm), residual chlorine (0.19 ± 0.003 mg/L), and fluoride (1.17 ± 0.009 mg/L). e removal efficiency of turbidity, total hardness, and nitrate was found to be 94.4%, 52.3%, and 88.7%, respectively. Removal efficiency of the treatment plant for total coliforms up to 91.6% (15 ± 0.26 CFU/100 mL in tap water) and faecal coliforms up to 99% (1.51 ± 0.03 CFU/100 mL in tap water) was recorded. Parameters of pH, temperature, and faecal coliform were statistically significant different at p < 0.05 in tap water source. e overall efficiency of the treatment plant (68.5%) and the water quality index (76) were recorded. Conclusion. Based on the results, some of the investigated parameters of water quality (turbidity, residual chlorine, total coliform, and faecal coliform) were found to be not within the permissible limits of WHO guideline values for drinking water quality. e water quality index of the water samples was categorized under good water quality. To adequately treat drinking water and improve the treatment plant, adequate preliminary treatments like screening to reduce the incoming organic loading, proper chlorination of the drinking water system, and frequent monitoring and maintenance of the treatment plant system are required.\n\nThe Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) at AMA Breweries is a State of the art outfit put in place to meet the regulatory compliance for National Effluent Limitations in Nigeria for Breweries. The objective of the study was to investigate the quality of effluent discharge from AMA Brewery and establish whether the operation of Waste water Treatment Plant is efficient in removing the solid wastes and other potential pollutants originating from the combined Brewery effluent. Wastes water samples were collected at the inflow into the WWTP, outflow from the WWTP, settling pond and discharge channel and analyzed for pH, EC, TSS, TDS, hardness, alkalinity, acidity, nitrate, chloride, phosphate, sulphate, As, Al, Cr, Cd, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Fe, Mg, Ca, BOD, COD, DO, total plate count and total coliform using standard methods. Results obtained were analyzed and compared with National Effluent Limitation Guidelines for Breweries in Nigeria. Results showed that EC, TSS, alkalinity, COD, total plate count and total coliform were significantly above the permissible limits, while other parameters\n\nAbstract: Treatment of public water supply is an essential service in both developed and developing countries .Maintaining optimal environmental health and minimising prevalence of waterborne diseases are among critical challenges to development particularly in Africa It is a pro-active approach in public water supply quality control management to ensure consumers safety. The Lower Usuma Water Treatment commenced supply portable water to Abuja Metropolis in 1987.In recent past, media reports were up that Abuja Metropolis may likely to experience widespread incidence of waterborne diseases if the current situation is not checked. Only 42% of Abuja residents had access to safe water source. This underscores the relevance of the study to access the efficiency of the Lower Usuma Water Treatment (LUWT) Plant to supply portable water to Abuja Metropolis . Physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters of both the raw and treated water were stratifically sampled, and analyzed according to Standard Methods and Procedures. The results indicated that the source water was moderately contaminated .Plant Log Removal Value(LRV) and Efficiency were as follows: Physical parameters (0.48 to 0.51) and efficiency (65.25 to 68.19%),Chemical parameters (0.29-0.44 and efficiency(32.74-49.72%),heavy Heavy metals (0.25-0.52) & efficiency(63.28- 63.57%); Bacteriological parameters (0.69-1.28), and efficiency (59.93-67.87%). The Overall average LRV and percentage efficiency of the LUWT were found to be 0.56 and 64% respectively within the period of study. The quality of treated water was found to be significantly in compliance with the WHO Guideline Values for safe drinking water but it runs short of public demand due to development in the Metropolis. The study recommended that the plant unit operation should be scaled up and re-engineered to improve its efficiency and therefore minimise the frequency/incidence of waterborne diseases in the Abuja Metropolis. The study concluded that the LUWT plant was still technologically appropriate to deliver safe water to the public within the period under study. Key words: Efficiency, Assessment, Lower Usuma Treatment Plant, Abuja Metropolis,\n\nDomestic wastewater treatment plant performance (WWTP) currently refers to stringent wastewater quality standards (Minister of Environment and Forestry Regulation No. 68 of 2016) considering potential environmental degradation because of pollutants in the wastewater. This study evaluated the performance of the Regional Domestic WWTP in Cimahi City. Cimahi has 10 WWTPs which were operated by an Anaerobic Baffled Reactor system. Periodic monitoring only measured the wastewater characteristics after treatment with parameters: total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia, chemical oxygen demand(COD), biological oxygen demand(BOD), and oil and grease. Therefore, wastewater characteristics were measured before and after treatment at selected WWTP during peak and non-peak hours, with TSS, ammonia, and COD. Important hydraulic factors were also measured: flow velocity at peak and non-peak hours, hydraulic detention time, and sludge height. Effluent from all WWTPs did not meet the standard. However...\n\nProper disposal of wastewater still remains a major concern in developing countries. As population grows and urbanization increases, more wastewater is generated and there is great awareness on the health and environmental implication of poorly disposed wastewater. This research work develops a sustainable approach to wastewater disposal in the Federal University of Technology, Akure. The existing wastewater disposal system in use in the study area is the septic tank - soakaway system for individual buildings. This approach presents serious problems due to the choice of inappropriate technology, improper siting of infrastructure, lack of adherence to correct design concepts and lack of proper maintenance.Wastewater samples were collected and their properties determined through laboratory tests to ascertain the concentrations of significant physical, chemical and bacteriological constituents for the selection of appropriate wastewater treatment processes. The total estimate of the wastewater generated from various locations was 2.075 million liters per day based on the population of approximately 26,131.Taking into consideration the available pipe sizes in the market a pipe size of 100 mm was found to be suitable for wastewater conveyance from the office and residential areas based on the contributory population. The proposed wastewater treatment plant (three anaerobic ponds of 57.42 m x19.14 m x5 m connected in series) is to be sited at the lowest topographical level which is of suitable distance from the office and residential areas. Implementing this wastewater management approach in the university will mitigate the negative effect of septic tank - soakaway system and present an environmentally sustainable wastewater management approach"
