There is a topic on \"Route 66--how long do I need and where should I stop\".\n\nRoute 66 begins in Chicago but it's winter here and anyway, not much of Route 66 remains in the Midwest. Best to focus on the Southwest portion of the U.S. There will be some high elevations where you could encounter snowy conditions at this time of year even so.\n\nCOVID is still prevalent here in the U.S., so you will also need to familiarize yourself with COVID mitigation rules in the various states and localities you would be traveling through. My guess is that, other than Illinois, and especially Chicago where you will need to provide proof of full vaccination to do much of anything indoors, California rules will be the most strict. Bear in mind that these rules change from time to time, depending on the severity of outbreaks. And make sure you have really good travel insurance with coverage for medical care, in case you take ill while traveling.\n\nDo note that many if not most of the suggested places to visit in posts 1, 2 and 3 actually having nothing whatsoever to do with Route 66, they're just in that direction.\n\n2 weeks is actually quite a short trip if you have serious interest in Route 66. However, as you say you plan to do the trip 'soon' without specific details like actual dates, I'd recommend you stick to the south western half - both for better weather and to give you time to follow the route, do the details some seem to think are preferable, and also have time in the metro LA area, if that's of interest to you.\n\nHave you looked into vehicle rental yet? Assuming a one way trip, can you find any vehicle available and is the price acceptable to you?\n\nSWT\n\n#4 - “not much of Route 66 remains in the Midwest.” That statement is technically correct since US Rt66 was decommissioned, but incorrect in implying there aren’t many places to see associated with the old Mother Road along the way.\n\nI’ve traveled Rt66 from Chicago to Santa Monica though not all on the same trip. To me the eastern half from the mid-point at Adrian, TX is as interesting and enjoyable as the western half. A big highlight in the West is Grand Canyon which isn’t a part of Rt66, but a must see.\n\nBest thing to do to plan your trip is get some books and watch some videos. Books I recommend are EZ66 Guide by McClanahan and Rt66 Adventure Handbook by Knowles. They’re all you need to decide what you want to see. Another book with many pictures is Rt66 The Mother Road by Wallis. This book is now 30 years old but an informative and enjoyable read.\n\nSearch Route 66 on YouTube to find many relevant videos. Probably the most complete is a series of 35 episodes by Justin Scarred. I find his narrative style annoying but if you can tolerate him you’ll get lots of information. Note that there was a TV program titled Route 66. The show had nothing to do with the road so you can ignore those.\n\nIf you’ll be traveling before late April I would start the trip on the West Coast and end in Chicago to let the Midwest warm up a bit more. Even then you can encounter late cold weather.\n\nA draft itinerary from Santa Monica could include nights in Barstow, Kingman, Grand Canyon Village or Tusayan, Gallup, Santa Fe, Amarillo, Oklahoma City, Springfield MO, St Louis, Springfield IL. That’s 10 nights to Chicago which gives some leeway in planning."
