        "meta_description": "Author summary Most species contain two copies of their genetic endowment, each received from each progenitor. If one of the duplicated genes is non-functional, the remaining copy may supply enough product as to cover the requirements for normal function or, alternatively, may reflect the insufficiency through a visible phenotype. In rare occasions, however, having one copy is so deleterious that causes lethality. These so called “haplolethal regions”, exist across species and represent an evolutionary paradox since they should have been subject to intense negative selection. The inherent difficulties to study haplolethals have precluded their study so far. Here, we analyzed the case of one of the five haplolethal regions of Drosophila, the one associated to the Troponin I encoding gene wupA, by measuring the transcriptional effects of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements affecting this gene. The data show that this haplolethality results from the combined insufficiency of a large number of Troponin I isoforms, which are functionally specialized, show interference and require the integrity of the native chromatin structure for their quantitatively regulated expression. These features unveil novel aspects of gene expression and, possibly, on evolutionary gene splitting. Also, haplolethals underscore the biological significance of protein dosage, in particular for functionally related products.",
