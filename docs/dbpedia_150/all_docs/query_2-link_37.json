        "text": "WUPA featured the esteemed Joe Kostuch, PT, SCS, Regional Director at HPRC, in a recent interview on National Arthritis Month and knee pain. With his extensive experience and knowledge, Kostuch provides valuable insights on these health issues.\n\nKostuch emphasizes the prevalence of arthritis among adults, revealing that one out of four patients is likely to experience arthritis in the knee and the hip. Contrary to popular belief, arthritis knee pain is not solely an age-related issue. “You can have early onset of symptoms as early as the 40s and unfortunately some of the data on knee replacements and hip replacements are getting younger and younger. Overall, the number of knee replacements over the next ten years is projected to go up over 600%. That’s a huge number that we’re trying to battle and get ahead of.”\n\nKostuch shared three exercises to help with flexibility and strengthening of the knee. These are all exercises that can be performed at your desk, and anyone can perform. Additionally, make sure to pay attention to the activities you’re performing. You may have to switch up what you usually do to avoid bringing on more pain. For example, switch to walking if you’re used to running a few miles daily. If you’re used to playing tennis, you may look at golf, biking or swimming. Staying active and moving is the key to prolonging your healthy knees."
