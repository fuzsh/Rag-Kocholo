        "text": "Abstract\n\nInformation on water quality indicators and pollution levels are critical for water resource preservation and sustainable use. To this vein, this study considered the physicochemical properties, bacterial and fungal burdens in Wupa River, which is part of the Jabi River watershed, Abuja, Nigeria. Water samples were collected from two (2) sampling points for the assessments for the period of six months (January to June 2021) using standard procedures. The physicochemical parameters revealed that water temperature ranged from 24.75 to 26.65°C, Dissolved oxygen (DO) from 4.06 to 5.99 mg/l, Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) from 5.04 to 6.18mg/l. pH ranged from 7.06 to 7.29, Electrical conductivity 25.00µS/cm, Turbidity from 6.00 to 8.20 NTU and Transparency ranged from 7.00 to 7.47. The DO, BOD5, pH and turbidity show significant difference (p<0.05). However, temperature, transparency and electrical conductivity (E.C) had no significant difference between the sampling points (p>0.05). All the measured parameters showed no significance difference (p>0.05) between the sampling months. A total of four-Gram negative (Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shigella sp) bacteria were isolated and identified. Whilst Staphylococcus aureus is the only Gram-positive bacteria species encountered during the study period. Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. nidulans, Penicillium chrysogenum and Fusarium oxysporum were the species of fungi isolated and identified. The presence of primarily gram-negative bacteria isolates in the river, as well as the state of surface water quality during the sample time, indicates pollution stress produced by various human activities in the Wupa River Abuja.\n\nKeywords:\n\nFreshwater, physico-chemical parameter, bacteria, fungi, anthropogenic activities."
