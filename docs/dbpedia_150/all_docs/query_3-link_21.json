        "text": "It was very enlightening for myself and Engineer Mansour Fall of the Fecal Sludge Management Alliance (FSMA) to take a tour of the Wupa Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) that serves Abuja city. I have visited many WWTP across Africa, most of which are not functioning or well below the capacity of the population, but I haven’t been to this one in my city. Naturally, I assume it is just like the other ones across many cities in Africa. I was very wrong and I was shocked. But my visitor who has visited more treatment plants both in Africa and across the world than myself was more than shocked.\n\nFirst of all, the area around the treatment plant whose construction started in 2001 is neatly kept like that of a hotel\n\nThe plant covers an area of 297,960 square meters and is designed to serve a population of about 700,000 population’s meaning that the plant can accommodate an annual dry weather inflow of 5,500 cubic meters per day. It lies between longitude 7 8’20.33 and latitude 9 2’14.46’’ respectively the WUPA sewage treatment plant Abuja is designed for Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to handle waste water generated by a population of 700,000 equivalent and expandable to 1,000,000 populations equivalent on an average domestic waste water of 230 l/c/d.\n\nThe WSTP consists of six aerobic bioreactors of 27,700 cubic meters capacity each, making a total of 166,200 m3 capacity in parallel and in series to six clarifiers of 8,364 m3 capacity each, totalling 50,184 m3 capacity. The steps in the treatment plant is mechanical (physical) and biological treatment processes, involving screens, grit chambers, aeration tanks with solid retention time (SRT) of 20 days, clarifiers and sludge drying bed. Above is a picture of the plant from the observation point.\n\nThe primary wastewater generation sources in the FCT include domestic wastewater from houses, schools and small scale industries. It is important to bear in mind that the city has a population of close to 2 million people, however, most of them are not connected to the sewers that feed the treatment plant. This is due to planning and development control which are handled by other agencies of the government. As a result, most of the houses within some major estates and areas use septic tanks. It must be mentioned here that some of the septic tanks are emptied into the sewage system at some designated points. More needs to be done in this regard.\n\nDuring a tour of the plant, we were told by the very efficient staff that the influents coming to the treatment plant are fully treated and the EFFLUENTS discharged into a nearby river meets WHO standards. I was in awe. So I did a bit of digging and came across several reports of the evaluation of the performance of the treatment plant. The conclusion drawn by all of them is unanimous. That WUPA WWTP achieves higher percentages in terms of removal efficiencies for most parameters and the overall efficiency is in the order NH4- N< COD< BOD5<TSS. The effluent qualities meet the acceptable standards outlined by WHO for effluents to be discharged into water bodies which are critical to the provision of clean and safe water. The analysis revealed that parameters such as BOD520, COD, TSS, NH4-N, PO4- P, E.C, PH, temperature and DO in the final treated effluent when compared with the standards were found mostly within the limits set by WHO.\n\nA closer scrutiny shows that the agency that operates and maintains this plant is the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) under the leadership of Engineer Osilama Braimah who has been a staff of the agency for her 2 decades. This is also a testament to a history of good leadership that the agency has enjoyed over the years. The efficiency of the treatment plant shows that several enabling factors are at work here. These include effective leadership, strong human and technical capacity, reliable financing.\n\nThere is however, room for improvement.\n\nThe plant uses diesel powered generators for some of the areas where it needs power which include the UV disinfectant and others. In my view the flow of wastewater into the plant can generate power by retrofitting with small turbines. Additional power can come from other renewable sources like solar and wind. This will cut down on emissions and the cost of operations and also generate revenue for operation costs.\n\nWith further treatment, the water effluent can be meet drinking water quality which can be used my most of the industries within the Idu area where the plant is located. The treated sludge and other by products can also be a source of revenue.\n\nGovernance reforms can improve other areas like the tariffs for full cost recovery and initiate incremental transformation of plant’s fiscal performance. These reforms will need to address overall fecal sludge management in many ways that will need to effectively organise the sector through a citywide approach involving multiple stakeholders.\n\nThere are also other technologies that give alternative sustainable approaches for fecal sludge management. One is the OmniProcessor OP whose development was driven and supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Melinda Gates Foundation Can augment the work of many wastewater treatment plants across the continent. In Abuja for example, the other half of the population of the city and the satellite towns all with several millions of populations can benefit from the OP. The OP has the advantage to convert fecal sludge to energy, organic fertilisers, construction materials and potable water etc, etc.\n\nMoreover, the WWTP in Abuja also costs a fortune so I am not sure of how many similar plants the country can build.\n\nWatch this space for a review of other treatment plants and fecal sludge management updates from across Africa."
