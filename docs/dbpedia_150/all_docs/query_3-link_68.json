We like it. There are snacks, fruits, nuts and dried fruits on the table at the entrance. The proprietress is very beautiful. I hope to stay again next time. The night view around the accommodation is invincible, and the proprietress is reliable and kind, leaving a very good impression. On the first day, the proprietress offered to provide Uyghur hats for us to take to Khan Bazaar to take pictures. We stayed here for 4 nights, loved it and would recommend it. My daughter was not feeling well in the last two days, and the proprietress was also enthusiastic and caring, providing medical needs and reassuring our family.\n\nShow more\n\n4.8/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nTTravelinthePinkThey are currently the only hostel accommodating foreigners as of July 2023. Most of the hotels Trip. com provides don't allow foreigners. But Trip reps are very helpful via chat calling up options for you - and refund you if it turns out a booking denies you. And even compensate you for the hardship. Best booking company ever. The only negative that can't be changed is not enough toilets (porcelain hole in the ground, not a proper western toilet seat if that's important to you ) for the amount of people. I think my floor accommodates 14 people with just 1 shower/toilet. The shower is in the toilet space so it's very easy to slip and get your foot in the toilet floor hole.. Wear flip flops. If someone is in the shower and you need toilet, you better be able to hold it in. Also, the beds are thin flat japanese style matresses so I might not be your cup of tea. Besides that, the location is great. It's in the old town right on the wall above the nightlife bar street but the loud music don't reach the rooms. Rooms have fans and strong AC. That said, if there are Chinese in your room, they will ask to turn both off. They like it hot. .. I came on a loaded touring bicycle. They found space for it in the employee/storage room on the 2nd floor. I have a large bike and was able to carry it up the narrow stairs. If you're more than 1 person on a bicycle tour together, the bikes might not fit in the hostel. Maybe lock them outside. With tons of cameras and police, no one will dare steal them. At worse, people will pose next to your loaded bike as they did mine when I stopped for a cold beer before checking in. The staff spoke good English considering how remote Kashgar is and were very helpful and kind. Unlike typical hostels outside China , people are respectful and quiet here.\n\nShow more\n\n4.8/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nQQuxiaomiaoThe location is very good, in the old city, a quiet lane with both charm and noise, very close to Rainbow Lane and Budai Lane. The interior decoration of the homestay is also a beautiful and small style. Many tourists who take travel photos will take pictures at the door. It should be a special homestay in the old city. The interior space of the room is compact, but basically it is outside, and the squatting is enough to come back to sleep and shower. There are free dried fruit snacks and tea on the first floor. If you are driving, you need to find a parking space in the surrounding business district. The parking spaces around the old city are tight.\n\nShow more"
