        "text": "This study sheds light on the engineering and environmental performance of lime-activated incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) treated Hong Kong marine deposits (HKMD) slurry by stabilisation/solidification (S/S) technology, which is proposed using as fill materials in reclamation projects. The S/S performance of the treated HKMD with distilled water and seawater under different salinities was investigated. The results show that seawater could help S/S treated HKMD gain strength by using activated industrial wastes (ISSA and GGBS). The hydration and pozzolanic reactions between ISSA, GGBS, CaO and clayey compositions in HKMD make contributions to the strength development, porosity decrease and heavy metals stabilisation, which is supported by the characterization analysis including thermo-gravimetric (TG) analysis, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (NAI), scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) and the leaching test of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). Seawater of 1.8% salinity (18 g/kg) is better than the distilled water and seawater of 3.6% salinity as a substrate solution in the S/S treated HKMD, because of the highest unconfined compressive strength and lowest porosity in the treated samples. The highest pH may account for its highest strength under the 1.8% salinity conditions. The S/S process could effectively stabilize the contaminants regardless of the curing time and the salinity of the mixing solution, and the leachates from the stabilized HKMD are environmentally safe and meet the requirement of standard in Hong Kong on the recycling treated soil. Therefore, recycling wastes—ISSA and GGBS with lime can be used as an appealing binder to stabilize/solidify marine deposits as environmental-friendly reusable materials in reclamation projects.\n\nNon-lateritic soils are commonly used for construction purposes. However, due to the variability of the properties of the soil, it does not meet the design requirement. In this study, non-lateritic soil sample was taken from a borrow pit in Dungulbi, Bauchi State Nigeria. The materials were characterized and then stabilized with scrap tyre crumb rubber (STCR) in concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% by dry weight of the soil for various sizes of scrap tyre crumbs rubber (STCR) in the range (i.e. 0.212, 2.36, 3.35, and 4.75 mm). The test conducted on the non-lateritic soil-STCR includes compaction using three energies level and durability. The results obtained indicate a general decrease in both optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) as the STCR contents increases. For all the three different compaction energy levels used, the durability decreased with increase in the STCR content. The BSL compactive efforts resulted in higher durability values than the samples compacted using BSH and WAS compactive efforts. The highest durability obtained with the BSL compaction effort could be attributed to decrease in compressibility which is believed to be caused by lower compaction energy and less orientation of adjacent particles during compaction.KeywordsNon-lateritic soilSoil stabilizationScrap tyre crumb rubberDurability testOptimum moisture content\n\nGroundnut shell ash (GSA) and metakaolin (MK) were investigated for their stabilizing prospects in highly expansive clay soils due to the rising cost of traditional stabilizers and the need for cost-effective utilization of waste materials for useful engineering applications (black cotton soil). The natural soil’s index qualities revealed that it belongs to A-7-6 in the AASHTO classification system and CH in the USCS classification system. This implied that the soil is unsuitable for most engineering purposes. The natural soil’s liquid limit and plasticity index values of 60.2% and 30.1%, respectively, which indicated that the samples were malleable. The soaked CBR for natural soil is 1.67%, but it rises to 3.26% when 10% GSA and 10% MK are added. This value fell short of the recommended CBR values for pavement materials. The samples’ durability measured based on their resistance to strength loss, fell short of the recommended strength by 80%. This concludes that the groundnut shell ash and metakaolin cannot be used as standalone for stabilization of black cotton soil. However, when compared to the un-stabilized soil, the strength of UCS increased from 128.03 kN/m2 to 482 kN/m2 after 28 days of curing.KeywordsGroundnut shell ashMetakaolinBlack cotton soilCalifornia bearing capacity\n\nThis study proposes a method of gradually loading plate load on-site using lever arms to squeeze out pore water from clayey soils, allowing the soil to settle. Several types of tests were conducted, including a conventional field plate load test (CFPLT), a numerical field plate load test (NFPLT) and an innovative field plate load test (IFPLT) proposed in this study. Three trial pits with soils of varied engineering properties were studied using CFPLT, which employed the use of a heavy jack for load application, the NFPLT test using PLAXIS and an IFPLT, which employed a lever arm to magnify the applied static load. Disturbed soil samples collected from these trial pits were tested for index properties while the undisturbed soil samples were tested using the undrained triaxial compression test (UTCT) and laboratory consolidation tests. The results of the index properties classified these three clay soils as silt of low plasticity (ML) for clay from site 1, and clay of low plasticity (CL) for clay from site 2 and 3. The cohesion and angle of internal friction from the UTCT recorded cohesion values were 28, 29 and 37 kN/m2 for sites 1, 2 and 3, respectively, while the angle of internal friction values were 13, 8 and 6° for sites 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The plate load testing using the three methods showed similar graph pattern except that the allowable load occurred at approximately 350 kN/m2 for the CFPLT and 150 kN/m2 for the IFPLT. The high value of bearing capacity in CFPLT is due to the short period of time taken to load from a jack, which allowed the test to be completed within a short period of time. The ultimate bearing capacities computed from the laboratory test have values of 315.0, 231.0 and 270.0 kN/m2 for sites 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These values agree closely with the bearing capacities obtained for CFPLT but higher than the values recorded for the IFPLT. This is probably due to the long period of sustained loading during testing, which allowed for dissipation of pore water during each loading. Settlements obtained using the IFPLT were close to 25 mm, which is recommended as minimum settlements for building structures BS 8004, 1986.\n\nSoft soils have been adopted as a conventional fill material in land reclamation projects, which is quite promising in Hong Kong with a huge mass of dredged marine sediments produced per year. It is proposed to use Hong Kong marine deposits (HKMD) as fill material treated by stabilisation/solidification (S/S) technology with sustainable binding material. In this work, lime, incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) were selected as the binding materials. The S/S performance of the binders on HKMD slurry was investigated. The results showed that the use of ISSA and GGBS as part of the binder is effective in promoting the strength of HKMD slurry with a high initial water content of 200%. The HKMD slurry treated by 30% binders (30% lime and 70% (ISSA + GGBS) with ISSA: GGBS = 3) gains strength, which became higher with increasing curing time. The results from X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric (TG) analysis and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) presented the formations of calcium (aluminium) silicate hydrate (C-(A)-S-H), Friedel’s salt, and ettringite, which are mainly responsible for the strength increase of treated HKMD with their phases filling into the pores, interlocking and reinforcing the particles in the mixture. The porosity of the treated HKMD in bulk and powder state was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry technique (MIP) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms (NAI), it is found that the bulk porosity of treated HKMD samples reduces with curing time due to the neoformations, especially the ettringite crystal by SEM results. This work indicates the potential application of lime-activated recycling wastes (i.e., ISSA and GGBS) for S/S treatment of HKMD slurry.\n\nIn this study, it is aimed to evaluate the wastewater sludge supplied locally at 100 tons/day in the investigation area. In this context, the geotechnical properties of bentonite, zeolite-type clays and sands, which are common in the investigation area, were determined by mixing with sewage sludge ash (SSA) in specified ratios. Grain size distribution and specific gravity of pure materials and mixtures were determined. Direct shear tests, permeability tests, consistency limits tests, modified proctor tests and PH determination tests were performed with the mixtures. Soils were mixed with 0.5, 7.5, 10 and 12.5 percent SSA in order to determine the physical, chemical and mechanical properties. Mixtures of sand with 40% bentonite (i.e., BS40) and sand with 40% zeolite (i.e., ZS40) were used as host materials for SSA inclusion. As a result of extensive laboratory studies, it was observed that the engineering properties of the specimens changed significantly as a result of the 7.5% and 12.5% mixture of SSA. BS40/SSA7.5 and ZS40/SSA12.5 samples from the mixtures reached 83 kPa and 80 kPa maximum shear strength under 200 kPa normal pressure. The maximum unit weight of specimens was achieved by BS40/S5 and ZS40/S5 specimens as 1.72 and 1.82 g/cm3, respectively. With the addition of SSA, the hydraulic permeability of the mixtures decreased to an order of 10E–8 (cm/s) for BS40/SSA12.5 and ZS40/12.5 specimens. Experimental studies have provided significant engineering and environmental benefit in the evaluation of sewage sludge ash, which is inevitable in residential areas.\n\nIn this study, it is aimed to evaluate the wastewater sludge supplied locally at 100 tons/day in the investigation area.
