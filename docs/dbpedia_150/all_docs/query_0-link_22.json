        "text": "The occurrence of pathogens in discharged wastewater effluent may constitute potential public health risks. This study assessed the physicochemical and bacteriological characteristics of water samples taken from the Wupa River in Abuja, Nigeria, which receives the final effluent of the Wupa Wastewater Treatment Plant. Sixty sewage/water samples were collected over 12 months from five sampling points. Coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli were simultaneously enumerated using the membrane filtration technique and Chromocult Coliform Agar. HANNA multiparameter metre was used to measure the physicochemical parameters including temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and total dissolved solids (TDS). Results of the bacteriological analysis showed that impermissible high mean counts of E. coli (≥ 1.2 × 104 CFU/100 ml) and total coliforms (≥ 5.4 × 104 CFU/100 ml) were detected in 95% and 100% of the water samples respectively. These values exceed the acceptable standard limits. The mean values of physicochemical parameters ranged from 6.3 to 8.7, 20.9 to 27.3 °C, 116 to 325.0 µS/cm, 1.3 to 11.4 mg/l and 98.0 to 180.0 mg/l for pH, temperature, EC, DO and TDS respectively, with all conforming to international and national standards. Wupa River seems to have a minor negative environmental impact, per the physicochemical data obtained in this study. However, the high counts of faecal indicator bacteria demonstrated in the effluent samples were higher than those of the river at both upstream and downstream sites, implying that the river microbial load may increase to constitute an unchecked environmental hazard. Adequate disinfection of the Wupa plant effluent before discharge into the Wupa River is imperative.\n\nThis study evaluated the efficiency of microalgae activated sludge (MAAS) for wastewater treatment by investigating the influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on MAAS using batch regime pilot scale photobioreactors at Wupa Wastewater Treatment Plant. The outcome of the study showed that MAAS has a comparably high wastewater treatment performance in comparison with the current Wupa Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTPA) activated sludge (AS) method and is capable of treating wastewater to the defined Nigerian effluent standards. It was further revealed that treatment performance for most parameters were optimal from HRT3 (6-day hydraulic retention time). Precisely, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and BOD5 had highest removal efficiency at HRT3 with average total removal of 81.36%, 91.77% and 87.04% respectively. Correspondingly, the average percentage DO increment peaked at HRT3 with a value of 269.7%. In addition, there was a general deterioration of SVI with increasing HRT, particularly after HRT2 (4-day HRT). Notably, SVI30 was significantly good at HRT1 and HRT2 with SVI values of 48.6 ml/g and 105.52 ml/g; however, from HRT3 down to HRT9, the SVI30 became remarkably increases greater than that of HRT1 and HRT2, with values ranging from 685.61 to 1832.46 ml/g, which indicates a badly bulking sludge. The MAAS system is recommended as an attractive alternative to the conventional AS wastewater treatment in Nigeria and by extension West African subregion.\n\nThis Research work was carried out to Compare Treated and Untreated Wastewater samples from Wupa Sewage Treatment Plant Idu Research and Industrial Layout Abuja, Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Samples were collected from the period of June to August 2017. The samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters using standard analytical procedures. Results obtained in the study revealed that the Untreated wastewater and treated wastewater samples had the following values: the pH values for all the untreated wastewater sample ranged between 7.33-7.56 while that of treated wastewater sample ranged between 7.23-7.31, temperature; 26.60-27.20oC, 26.00-26.90 oC, electrical conductivity; 277.00-349.00 µS/cm, 244.00-307.00 µS/cm, turbidity; 188.00-435.00 NTU; 6.00-9.10 NTU, total dissolved solids; 162.00-180.00 mg/l, 132.00-158.00 mg/l, total suspended solids; 134.50-160.00 mg/l, 7.80-14.50 mg/l, total solids; 298.00-325.00 mg/l, 140.80-169.60 mg/l, dissolved oxygen; 2.00-3.60 mg/l, 6.00-6.90 mg/l, biochemical oxygen demand; 120.00-140.00 mg/l, 134.50-160.00 mg/l, chemical oxygen demand; 160.00-290.00 mg/l, 7.00-10.00 mg/l and total alkalinity; 45.80-68.00 mg/l, 40.00-55.00 mg/l for untreated and treated waste waters respectively. Thus the Wupa Sewage Treatment Plant Idu Research and Industrial Layout Abuja had a significant role in the control of pollution loads of wastewater and its quite effective.\n\nIn third world countries, industries mainly cause environmental contamination due to lack of environmental policies or oversight during their implementation. The Sheikhupura industrial zone, which includes industries such as tanneries, leather, chemical, textiles, and colour and dyes, contributes massive amounts of untreated effluents that are released directly into drains and used for the irrigation of crops and vegetables. This practice causes not only soil contamination with an excessive amount of heavy metals, but is also considered a source of toxicity in the food chain, i.e., bioaccumulation in plants and ultimately in human body organs. The objective of this research study was to assess the spatial distribution of the heavy metals chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb), at three depths of soil using geostatistics and the selection of significant contributing variables to soil contamination using the Random Forest (RF) function of the Boruta Algorithm. A total of 60 sampling locations were selected in the study area to collect soil samples (180 samples) at three depths (0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, and 60–90 cm). The soil samples were analysed for their physico-chemical properties, i.e., soil saturation, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM), pH, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and Cr, Cd, and Pb using standard laboratory procedures. The data were analysed with comprehensive statistics and geostatistical techniques. The correlation coefficient matrix between the heavy metals and the physico-chemical properties revealed that electrical conductivity (EC) had a significant (p ≤ 0.05) negative correlation with Cr, Cd, and Pb. The RF function of the Boruta Algorithm employed soil depth as a classifier and ranked the significant soil contamination parameters (Cr, Cd, Pb, EC, and P) in relation to depth. The mobility factor indicated the leachate percentage of heavy metals at different vertical depths of soil. The spatial distribution pattern of Cr, Cd, and Pb revealed spatial variability regarding subsoil horizons. Significant contamination was discovered near the Deg drain and the Bed Nallah irrigated area that indicated a high Cr topsoil contamination, and in a homogenous pattern in Cd and Pb (p < 0.05). Consequently, different soil management strategies can be adopted in an industrial irrigated area to reduce the contamination load of heavy metals in soil.\n\nIn Nigeria, the continuous discharge of industrial wastewater with non-complaint quality parameters as stipulated by the National Environmental Standards and Regulation Enforcement Agency (NESREA) is a daunting challenge. This precarious situation has led to the continuous decline in our freshwater quality, with adverse environmental and health implications. Consequently, monitoring of wastewater discharged from industries is of utmost importance in order to check them and raise awareness, where necessary. In this study, wastewater samples were collected from four processing facilities around Benin City and environs, namely: a carbonated soft drink company, a brewery, glass manufacturing company and a meat processing outfit (abattoir). Physicochemical parameters and heavy metal concentrations were evaluated in the samples. Results obtained were compared with set standards for effluent discharge by the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to determine the effluent quality and compliance level of the concerned industries. Data obtained from physicochemical analyses of the effluents from the industries revealed that some parameters, namely: PO4 3-(90.60-311.55 mg/L), SO4 2-(605.9-765.0 mg/L), Cl-(590.14-765.0 mg/L), calcium hardness (283.35-370.0 mg/L), and a heavy metal [Zn (1.90-2.11 mg/L)] had values higher than the maximum permissible limits of NESREA and USEPA while effluents from the carbonated drink and abattoir recorded Pb levels of 0.03 mg/L which was above the permissible limit stipulated by both regulating bodies. The study shows non-compliance of these industrial outfits with standards/guidelines set by the regulatory bodies and calls for appropriate action to stem the present trend whereby poor quality effluents are indiscriminately discharged into receiving water bodies.\n\nEfficient wastewater treatment is critical to the sustainability of the environment and protection of public health, and wastewater treatment plants. This study thus, investigates the coliforms removal efficiency of Wupa wastewater treatment plant, Abuja, Nigeria over a period of five consecutive years (2013-2017). The study was conducted using secondary data on average annual characteristics of raw sewage (influent) and treated wastewater (effluent) of the wastewater treatment plant. The correlation between the coliforms removal efficiency and other wastewater constituents such as biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solid and E.coli were also explored using paired sample mean t-test static at 5% level of significance (P<0.05). The outcome of this study indicated a total coliform and E.coli removal efficiency ranging between 99.96 % to 99.98%, and 97% to 99.7% respectively; with the year 2017 notably having the highest Total Coliform and E.coli removal efficiency of 99.98% and 99.7% respectively. The findings of the research also revealed that in the t-test statistical analysis t-test value of t-critical is less than the value of t-statistic which means that there is strong relationship between the following wastewater constituents; biochemical oxygen demand concentration and Fecal coliform, total suspended solids, E.coli, total coliform and fecal coliform with (p< 0.05) confidence value. In conclusion, the observed coliforms removal efficiency in this study (97%-99.98%) indicates a high removal efficiency which gives credence to several previous similar studies which reported coliform removal efficiencies of over 90%. The coefficient of correlation (r²) obtained from the research ranges between 0.49-0.97."
