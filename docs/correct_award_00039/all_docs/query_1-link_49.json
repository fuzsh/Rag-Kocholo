        "text": "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide suffer from conditions and diseases tied to hormone disturbances. In many cases, medical doctors and researchers called endocrinologists are the unsung heroes who see the pattern in a host of often odd or unique symptoms.Many of the medical breakthroughs of the past century, such as the discovery of insulin, have been attributed to endocrinologists. Ten winners of the Nobel prize (in both Physiology or Medicine, and Chemistry) were members of the Endocrine Society, the world’s largest medical society of endocrine professionals. As well, there have been thirty-five endocrine-related Nobel prizes in all awarded over the past century. The impact of endocrinologists and endocrinology-related research on the medical field has been profound.\n\nDiabetes\n\nDiabetes—a metabolic disease involving the inability of the pancreas to produce or use the hormone insulin that results in high blood sugar levels—affects more than 422 million men, women, and children worldwide. The Endocrine Society and the Hormone Health Network are recognizing the importance of this global epidemic with the aim of increasing awareness and prevention.\n\nThyroid Issues and Thyroid Cancer\n\nThe thyroid gland has a huge impact on a person’s health and our collective mission is to fuel the development of promising new treatments and improve the lives of patients. The science has come a long way. In the past few years researchers have discovered new ways to diagnose and treat thyroid cancer without surgery, have reduced the negative effects of thyroid disorders in pregnant women including gestational diabetes and higher rates of C-Sections, and have employed radical research methods to help develop new models for treating Graves’ disease.\n\nEndocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs)\n\nThe Endocrine Society has been highly engaged in global efforts to reduce harms due to exposures from EDCs. To advance understanding and protect the public health, the Society has called for increased support for research, collaborative efforts between scientists and policymakers to develop and revise policy, and centralized regulatory oversight of EDCs.\n\nReproductive Health\n\nHormones play a critical role in women’s reproductive health. They regulate menstruation, fertility, menopause, and sex drive. The Endocrine Society and the Hormone Health Network aim to educate women about how hormones can affect their health. The main hormones affecting the menstrual cycle and fertility are produced by glands in the brain and by the ovaries. During menopause, a time in a woman’s life when the menstrual cycles end and pregnancy cannot happen naturally, women may face hot flashes, mood swings, loss of sleep, and other symptoms. The Hormone Health Network’s Menopause Map™ can help guide women through their personal journey with menopause.\n\nObesity\n\nObesity is a global epidemic. More than 35 percent of adults and nearly 17 percent of children in the United States alone have obesity. Globally, more than 39 percent of adults are overweight and 13 percent are obese. The Endocrine Society and its members are committed to the research and clinical approaches needed to combat this worldwide burden.\n\nHormones and Cancer\n\nWhen a hormonal imbalance takes place, negative effects can occur. Sometimes these imbalances can even contribute to the development of cancer. In October, the Endocrine Society and the Hormone Health Network are recognizing the impact of cancer, with the aim of increasing awareness about the role hormones play in cancer risk.\n\nHistorical Vignettes\n\nDiscovery of Thyroxine (1914): Edward Kendall\n\nDiscovery of Insulin (1921): Fred Banting and Charles Best\n\nIdentification and Synthesis of T3 (1954): Rosalyn Pitt Rivers\n\nDiscovery of GNHR (1971): Andrew Schally and Roger Guillemin\n\nDiscovery of Hormone Processes (1972): Bert O'Malley\n\nDiscovery of Nuclear Receptors (1980s):Ronald Evans\n\nHistory of the Insulin Pump"
