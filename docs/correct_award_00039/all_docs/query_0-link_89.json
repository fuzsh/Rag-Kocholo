Initially she was not doing technical work but helping other\n\nwomen in the office with the filing. After 42 years she had worked her way up to senior technician with her name included on several publications.\n\nBlanche Lawrence\n\nBlanche J.

He started work there in 1934 so his career spanned a time of great change for science technicians with improving conditions and a breaking down of old social barriers in the laboratory.\n\nVicky Wilson\n\nVicky Wilson rescued DNA fingerprinting from the laboratory dustbin of history. Hers was the first DNA in the world to be fingerprinted when she worked for Professor Sir Alex Jeffreys at the University of Leicester.\n\nAndrew Schally – from technician to Nobel Prize\n\nAndrew Schally (1926-current) escaped Poland during WWII, became a technician in Mill Hill laboratories and from there went on to win the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nVikki Waring: from cupboard to laboratory\n\nFirst published May 2018 in The Journal. Vikki is a laboratory technician at the University of Nottingham in the School of Biosciences. She looks after students, bakes, and autoclaves heifer poo. This is her #TechnicianJourney. I’ve been a lab tech in Nottingham for a year and I’ve learnt so much in that time. I learnedContinueContinue reading “Vikki Waring: from cupboard to laboratory”"
