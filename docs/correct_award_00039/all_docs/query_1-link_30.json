        "text": "In 1977, Rosalyn Yalow became the second woman to win a Nobel prize in medicine for co-developing radio-immunoassay (RIA), a groundbreaking technique that uses radioactive isotopes to quickly and precisely measure concentrations of hormones, vitamins, viruses, enzymes, drugs, and hundreds more substances. The technique is so sensitive that it can detect a teaspoonful of sugar in a body of water 62 miles long.\n\nAs a result of Yalow’s work, many diseases and conditions can be diagnosed, treated, or tested. Children with dwarfism can be treated with human growth hormones; fetuses are checked for serious deformities; newborns are tested to prevent retardation; blood banks are screened for diseases; and athletes are tested for drug abuse.\n\nBorn in Bronx, NY, Yalow’s interest in chemistry began at Walton High School. By the time she got to Hunter College, an all-women’s school in New York (now part of the City University of New York), two professors managed to pique her interest in physics, influencing her decision to switch majors.\n\nYalow received her master’s degree in 1942 and Ph.D. in 1945. After a few jobs in electrical engineering and teaching, she decided to devote her career to full-time research. In 1950, Yalow began working with physician Solomon Berson with whom she gained clinical expertise while strengthening her physics, math, and chemistry. Together they discovered new ways to use radioactive isotopes to measure blood, study iodine metabolism, and diagnose thyroid diseases.\n\nLater they decided to apply their methods to hormones, one of the most important classes of small peptides. Because insulin was the most readily-available hormone in a highly-purified form, the scientists began investigating the adult onset of diabetes. Yalow also had a personal interest in this area because her husband, Aaron, was diabetic. Among the endocrine gland disorders, diabetes affects the greatest number of people, making insulin uniquely important. Death is unavoidable without insulin and its ability to lower blood sugar.\n\nUsing radioisotopes, Yalow and Berson discovered the need to detect insulin antibodies at low concentrations to measure circulating insulin. Upon discovering that globulins (serum proteins) bound radioactive insulin in the blood of insulin-treated diabetics, they concluded that insulin injections immunized patients so that they develop insulin-binding antibodies, which keeps the insulin molecules in the bloodstream.\n\nThis was the first evidence that very small proteins could stimulate an immunologic response, and demonstrated how remarkably sensitive the radioisotopic technique is in measuring incredibly low concentrations of substances. In 1959, Yalow and Berson published their proof of studying the primary reaction of antigen with antibody using the radioisotopic method, which they labeled radioimmunoassay (RIA).\n\nBefore this revolutionary breakthrough, scientists could only analyze reactions between antigens and antibodies and those that produced visible precipitation or other evidence, such as the clumping of red blood cells. The RIA method revolutionized endocrinology—the study of ductless glands and hormones—and the treatment of disorders like diabetes. For the first time, doctors could diagnose conditions caused by minute changes in hormones and treat conditions with hormones.\n\nIn 1968, Yalow became a research professor at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine and chief of Nuclear Medicine Service at the Veterans Administration Hospital. For her work, she was recognized with the Albert Lasker Prize for Basic Medical Research and the following year she was awarded the Nobel Prize with Andrew V. Schally and Roger Guillemin for their work on radioimmunoassay. Berson was not recognized, because he died before the award was announced.\n\nSee more Notable Women Scientists in History"
