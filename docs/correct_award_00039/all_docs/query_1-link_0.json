        "text": "Andrew V. Schally\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1977\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Veterans Administration Hospital, New Orleans, LA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for their discoveries concerning the peptide hormone production of the brain”\n\nPrize share: 1/4\n\nWork\n\nHormones are substances that convey signals between different parts of the body and regulate their functions. Around the pituitary in the brain, Releasing hormones serve to release other hormones and are formed around the pituitary gland. The releasing hormones occur in very small amounts. From large quantities of pig brains and lamb brains respectively, Andrew Schally and Roger Guillemin separately extracted a sufficient amount of releasing hormone to determine its structure in 1969. They subsequently were able to produce it with chemical methods."
