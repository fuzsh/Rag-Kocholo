        "text": "RIOS created a brand identity for the Los Angeles Fashion District by designing a set of utility box wraps that amplify the visitor experience. The experience and wayfinding design is inspired by the district’s vibrant colors and energy, creating a revitalized presence that guides visitors, offers moments of delight, and embodies the culture and spirit of the bustling region in the heart of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe design provides a dynamic experience for visitors across scales, catering to pedestrians and vehicles navigating through the 100-block hub. Each wrap utilizes the full surface area of each utility box, conveying the story and spirit of the LA Fashion District from all angles.\n\nThe design incorporates imagery and typography inspired by local merchants and services including Menswear, Textiles, Wholesale, the Flower District, and Santee Alley, an iconic outdoor shopping corridor. Each utility box features a map that provides wayfinding information and a deeper understanding of the district.\n\nA key goal of the design was to create an engaging experience for the district’s diverse visitors, ranging from casual shoppers and residents to employees and businesses. Several boxes feature unique expressions and interactive components to inspire discovery. Reflective mirrored vinyl allows participants to see themselves in the design itself for a playful photo opportunity. Dynamic compositions with illustrative details, photocollage elements, and exuberant catchphrases create a more memorable experience that encourages passersby to further explore the revitalized district.\n\nThe project enhances the identity and branding of the LA Fashion District. Each sub-district was assigned its own dominant color, giving it an easily recognizable presence while remaining part of a larger cohesive network.\n\nTypography is strategically used to play on scale, layering, and abstraction, adding visual interest to each box for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers alike. Textured details, inspired by textiles and fabrics inherent to the fashion industry, create a dynamic visual effect while alluding to the unique narrative of each district. These visual standards ensure that the newly rebranded district’s overall feel reflects the diverse people and presences in the area."
