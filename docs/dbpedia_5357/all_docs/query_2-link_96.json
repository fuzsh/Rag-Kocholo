        "text": "1. What kind of identification do I need to take with me to vote?\n\nIf you are a registered voter, you can vote. Missouri law provides multiple identification options. For more information, view acceptable IDs.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n2. Where do I vote?\n\nIf you are registered to vote, you may be able to find your polling place at our Voter Information Lookup.\n\nYou can only vote at your assigned polling place or, if there is a problem at your assigned polling place, you may be eligible to vote at the central polling place. Verifying your assigned polling place with your local election authority prior to Election Day will help to eliminate potential complications.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n3. When does my polling place open?\n\nPolling places open at 6:00 a.m. and remain open until 7:00 p.m. Those individuals arriving after the polling place has closed will not be allowed to vote. However, those individuals in line at 7:00 p.m. will be allowed to vote.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n4. Where can I see a sample ballot?\n\nYou may be able to view your sample ballot at our Voter Information Lookup.\n\nSample ballots can also be viewed at the polling place or at the office of your local election authority. Sample ballots are also required to be printed twice prior to each election in newspapers of general circulation. Some election jurisdictions may also mail sample ballots to all registered voters in that jurisdiction.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n5. What will be on the ballot on Election Day?\n\nYou may view statewide ballot measures online.\n\nYou may view federal/state candidates online.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n6. I need help when I vote. What are my options?\n\nCurbside Voting\n\nIf you have limited mobility you may be able to vote \"curbside\" or outside the polling place. You should go to your polling place and ask someone to go in and ask poll workers to bring a ballot out to you. The poll workers should bring you a ballot within a reasonable period of time.\n\nAccessible Voting Systems\n\nEvery polling place must have an accessible voting system for individuals with disabilities including audiovisual accessibility. Accessible systems include an audio ballot to make selections or the ability to enlarge text so that you can read the on-screen ballot with ease. You can view approved voting systems.\n\nPermanent Absentee Voting\n\nIf you have a permanent physical disability you may request to be placed on a designated list so that your local election authority can automatically mail an absentee ballot application directly to you prior to each election. You will need to make this request directly your local election authority who will send you further information.\n\nPersonal Assistance\n\nIf you cannot read or write, are blind or have another physical disability and cannot vote your ballot, you may choose to bring in a person to help you vote. Your assistant does not have to be over the age of 18 or have to be a registered voter. Additionally, a bipartisan team of poll workers can assist you upon request.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n7. How can I find out election results?\n\nYou can view current election night tabular results and archived election night results."
