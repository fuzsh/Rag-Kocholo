        "text": "A. If a voter does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID, and cannot reasonably obtain one, the voter may still cast a regular ballot by presenting a supporting form of ID and executing a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, noting the voter’s reasonable impediment to obtaining an acceptable form of photo identification, stating that the information contained in the declaration is true, that the voter is the same individual personally appearing at the polling place to sign the declaration, and that the voter faces a reasonable impediment to procuring an acceptable form of photo identification. If a voter has continued access to their acceptable form of photo ID, but, for example, forgets to bring their acceptable form of photo ID to the polling place and/or left it, for example, at home or in their car, the voter still possesses the acceptable photo ID and must use it to vote.\n\nHere is a list of supporting forms of ID:\n\ncopy or original of a government document that shows the voter’s name and an address, including the voter’s voter registration certificate;\n\ncopy of or original current utility bill;\n\ncopy of or original bank statement;\n\ncopy of or original government check;\n\ncopy of or original paycheck; or\n\ncopy of or original of (a) a certified domestic (from a U.S. state or territory) birth certificate or (b) a document confirming birth admissible in a court of law which establishes the voter’s identity (which may include a foreign birth document).\n\nVoters with a disability may apply with the county voter registrar for a permanent exemption to presenting an acceptable photo identification or following the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure in the county. The application must contain written documentation from either the U.S. Social Security Administration evidencing the applicant’s disability, or from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs evidencing a disability rating of at least 50 percent. The applicant must also state that he/she does not have a form of identification prescribed by Section 63.0101 of the Texas Election Code. Those who obtain a disability exemption will be allowed to vote upon display of their voter registration certificate reflecting the exemption, and will not need to execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. Please contact your county voter registrar for more details.\n\nVoters who have a consistent religious objection to being photographed or who do not present an acceptable form of photo identification listed above or follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure because of certain natural disasters as declared by the President of the United States or the Texas Governor, may vote a provisional ballot, appear at the voter registrar’s office within six (6) calendar days after election day, and sign an affidavit swearing to the religious objection or natural disaster, in order for the voter’s ballot to be counted. Please contact your county voter registrar for more details.\n\nIf a voter (a) does not possess one of the seven acceptable forms of photo identification, and a voter can reasonably obtain one of these forms of identification or (b) possesses, but did not bring to the polling place, one of the seven forms of acceptable photo identification listed above, or (c) does not possess one of the seven forms of acceptable photo identification, could otherwise not obtain one due to a reasonable impediment, but did not bring a supporting form of identification to the polling place, the voter may cast a provisional ballot at the polls. However, in order to have the provisional ballot counted, the voter will be required to visit the voter registrar’s office within six calendar days of the date of the election to either present one of the acceptable forms of photo ID OR submit one of the temporary affidavits (e.g., religious objection or natural disaster) in the presence of the county voter registrar OR submit the required paperwork and sign the required statement to qualify for a permanent disability exemption in the presence of the county voter registrar, in order for the provisional ballot to count.\n\nAlternatively, a voter who possesses an acceptable form of photo ID but does not have it at the polling place, or a voter who does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID, and is reasonably able to obtain one, may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with an acceptable form of photo ID to vote a regular ballot at that time. In addition, a voter who does not possess, would otherwise not be able to reasonably obtain an acceptable form of photo ID, but did not bring a supporting form of ID to the polling place, may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with said supporting form of ID to fill out the Reasonable Impediment Declaration and, if they otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot at that time.\n\nA. A. While you do not need to bring your voter registration certificate with you to vote, we highly recommend that you have it with you at the polling place. In some situations, having your voter registration certificate will allow you to vote a regular ballot instead of a provisional ballot. For example, if you do not possess one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo identification, and you cannot reasonably obtain one, you can use your valid voter registration certificate as a form of supporting identification when you execute your Reasonable Impediment Declaration, and vote a regular ballot. As another example, if your name does not appear on the official list of registered voters in the precinct, you may be able to cast a regular ballot by presenting your valid voter registration certificate along with an acceptable form of photo identification. In addition, for example, if you do not possess one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of identification, and you cannot reasonably obtain one, and your name is not on the official list of registered voters in the precinct, you may be able to cast a regular ballot by presenting your valid voter registration certificate and executing a Reasonable Impediment Declaration.\n\nPlease note that you may contact your county voter registrar’s office to obtain a replacement registration certificate.\n\nA. When a voter arrives at a polling location, the voter will be asked to present one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID (listed below). If a voter does not possess an acceptable form of photo identification and cannot reasonably obtain one, the voter may present a supporting form of ID and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, noting the voter’s reasonable impediment to obtaining an acceptable form of photo identification, stating that the information contained in the declaration is true, that the voter is the same individual personally appearing at the polling place to sign the declaration, and that the voter faces a reasonable impediment to procuring an acceptable form of photo identification. If a voter has continued access to their acceptable form of photo ID, but, for example, forgets to bring their acceptable form of approved photo ID to the polling place and/or left it, for example, at home or in their car, the voter still possesses the acceptable photo ID and must use it to vote.\n\nHere is a list of the acceptable forms of photo ID:\n\nTexas Driver License issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)\n\nTexas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS\n\nTexas Personal Identification Card issued by DPS\n\nTexas Handgun License issued by DPS\n\nUnited States Military Identification Card containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Citizenship Certificate containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Passport (book or card)\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Citizenship Certificate, which does not expire, for voters aged 18-69, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired no more than four years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place. For voters aged 70 or older, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired for any length of time if the identification is otherwise valid.\n\nHere is a list of the supporting forms of ID that can be presented if the voter does not possess an acceptable form of photo identification, and cannot reasonably obtain one:\n\ncopy or original of a government document that shows the voter’s name and an address, including the voter’s voter registration certificate;\n\ncopy of or original current utility bill;\n\ncopy of or original bank statement;\n\ncopy of or original government check;\n\ncopy of or original paycheck; or\n\ncopy of or original of (a) a certified domestic (from a U.S. state or territory) birth certificate or (b) a document confirming birth admissible in a court of law which establishes the voter’s identity (which may include a foreign birth document)."
