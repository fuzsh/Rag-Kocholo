        "text": "Welcome to the Secretary of State's California Redistricting information page.\n\nRedistricting FAQs\n\nWhat is redistricting? In order to get an updated count of the country's population, the U.S. Constitution requires a federal census every ten years. California uses that census data to redraw the Congressional, State Senate, State Assembly, and State Board of Equalization districts based on population changes.\n\nWho redraws district lines? The independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission (CCRC) uses the new census data to redraw the Congressional, State Senate, State Assembly, and State Board of Equalization district boundaries. CCRC certified final district maps and delivered them to the Secretary of State on December 27th, 2021. For more information on CCRC activities, see: wedrawthelinesca.org.\n\nThe boundaries for local districts, such as county supervisorial or city council districts, are drawn by those governing bodies and not by the CCRC. Information about the local process can be found here: https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/helpful-resources/redistricting.\n\nWhat is the Secretary of State's role after receiving the new maps? The Secretary of State provided the new CCRC maps to the California State Legislature and to California's 58 counties who are redrawing precincts within the new district boundaries and assigning voters to the updated precincts.\n\nWhat does redistricting mean to voters? There is some possibility that the districts for your Congressional, State Assembly, State Senate, and Board of Equalization will change, which means that your representatives in these elected offices may change after the next general election. More immediately, however, voters will be voting for candidates running for office using the new district boundaries as part of California's June 7, 2022, Primary Election.\n\nWhen do the new district lines take effect? Once the new elected officials take office after the November 2022 General Election. Until then, the existing district boundaries apply and constituents are represented by the elected officials occupying those offices.\n\nImportant Dates:"
