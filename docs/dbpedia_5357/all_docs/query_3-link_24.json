        "text": "A new element of the ACT's planning system is the introduction of district strategies.\n\nThere are nine districts across Canberra. Each strategy captures the special character of its corresponding district.\n\nThese documents will help guide how Canberra will change and grow towards 2038 and beyond to 2050. This growth will be in a way that keeps the territory sustainable, competitive and liveable.\n\nCanberra's population is growing quickly. Without strategic planning, the things that make Canberra a great place to live will diminish.\n\nThe district strategies look at how we manage growth in a way that is sustainable. This way, Canberrans can continue to have access to services, transport, employment, health, education and nature.\n\nNo more than 30% of growth will be in new suburbs, often referred to as greenfield land. The district strategies outline how we will keep the remaining 70% (or above) within the existing suburbs through increased density.\n\nChange will happen gradually, carefully and in consultation with community and local industry.\n\nThe district strategies show areas that could be suitable for change. More comprehensive investigations will be needed over time for each of these areas.\n\nDistrict Strategies\n\nDownload and read the new District Strategies:\n\nBelconnen [67.5 MB]\n\nEast Canberra [35.1 MB]\n\nGungahlin [65.0 MB]\n\nInner North and City [40.9 MB]\n\nInner South [44.4 MB]\n\nMolonglo Valley [29.9 MB]\n\nTuggeranong [43.6 MB]\n\nWeston Creek [4.8 MB]\n\nWoden [63.4 MB]\n\nThe district strategies are supported by 4 additional volumes:\n\nVolume 1: Metropolitan Context and Big Drivers [36.8 MB]\n\nVolume 3: Indicative Implementation Plan [13.1 MB]\n\nVolume 4 Background Material [98.1 MB]\n\nVolume 5: Glossary of Terms [326.1 KB]\n\nHigher resolutions maps from the district strategies are available on request.

They included and addressed what community and stakeholder groups told us across a number of years through consultations and workshops.\n\nThe District Strategies are 'living documents'. They can be updated over time to reflect new ideas, projects, strategies or policies adopted by the government. They will also be updated to include future Census data, population and employment projections.\n\nThe District Strategies are intended to evolve over time with the changing nature of the city. Therefore, the Planning Act 2023 allows the District Strategies to be reviewed and amended.\n\nReview of District Strategies\n\nEvery five years the Chief Planning Executive of the Territory Planning Authority must consider whether a district strategy still reflects the long-term planning policy and goals for the ACT. If not, a district strategy may be reviewed. If the Chief Planning Executive decides to undertake a review of a district strategy, this decision will be publicly notified.\n\nAmendment to a District Strategy\n\nIn addition to the review process, the Territory Planning Authority and other specified government agencies may amend part or all of a district strategy if and when required.\n\nThe amendment process involves preparing a planning and response report and carrying out public consultation.\n\nAn amendment to a district strategy is approved by the Minister if:\n\nsatisfied the amendment is consistent with the ACT Planning Strategy and\n\nthere has been sufficient public consultation undertaken.\n\nThe process to amend a district strategy is shown in the following figure.\n\nAt this stage there have been no amendments made to the District Strategies. Amendments to the District Strategies will be published here as they occur.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nRelated content"
