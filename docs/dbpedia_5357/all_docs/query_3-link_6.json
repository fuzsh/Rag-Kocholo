path for state redistricting plans&comma; depending on legislative&comma; gubernatorial&comma; Legislative Redistricting Board &lpar;LRB&rpar;&comma; and judicial action&period; The history of the redistricting process during the 1980s&comma; 1990s&comma; 2000s&comma; and 2010s illustrates some of the different courses decennial redistricting can take&period; In general&comma; the procedural and legal requirements dictate that the basic process takes the course that is described below&period;\n\nWhile the order of the steps remains the same as indicated&comma; the dates discussed are those required under federal and state laws&period; The COVID-19 pandemic led to a delay in the release of 2020 census data&comma; and the data were not available before the end of the regular session&period; As a result&comma; the LRB has no authority for redistricting in 2021&comma; and legislative action relating to all district types will take place in a special session&period; 2021 changes include&colon;\n\napportionment data for congressional districts was released on April 26&comma;

the Texas Constitution requires that the LRB&comma; a five&hyphen;member body of state officials including the lieutenant governor and the speaker of the house&comma; meet and adopt its own plan&period; The LRB has jurisdiction only in the months immediately following that regular session&period;\n\nIf congressional or SBOE districts are not enacted during the regular session&comma; the governor may call a special session to consider the matter&period; If the governor does not call a special session or the special session fails to enact a plan&comma; then a state or federal district court likely will issue a court&hyphen;ordered plan in time for the next election&period; Similarly&comma; if the legislature and the LRB fail to adopt a state senate or state house plan&comma; including at a special session called after the LRB's jurisdiction has ended&comma; a court will likely issue a plan to fill the void&period;\n\nA suit challenging an adopted redistricting plan may be brought at any time under the federal or state constitution or under federal law&period; Before 2013&comma; Texas and certain other states were required to obtain federal preclearance of any redistricting plans before they could be implemented&period; In 2013&comma; the applicable provision of the federal Voting Rights Act bringing those states under preclearance was held invalid by the U&period;S&period;

Congressional and State Board of Education &lpar;SBOE&rpar; district bills may be introduced in either or both chambers&semi; senate and house redistricting bills traditionally originate only in their respective chambers&period; Following final adoption by both chambers&comma; each redistricting bill is presented to the governor for approval&period; The governor may sign the bill into law&comma; allow it to take effect without a signature&comma; or veto it&period; If the house or senate redistricting bill fails to pass or is vetoed and the veto is not overridden by the legislature during the first regular session after the census data is released&comma;
