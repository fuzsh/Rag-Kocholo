        "text": "An appellation of origin generally designates the geographic area in which the fruit or other agricultural product was grown. Using an appellation of origin on your label also indicates that the wine meets certain production requirements. If certain information about a wine is included on the label, an appellation of origin is required.\n\nAn American viticultural area (AVA) is a type of appellation specific to grape wine. It is a defined grape-growing region having a name, distinguishing features, and a delineated boundary as established in 27 CFR part 9. An AVA may be used as an appellation only on grape wine. For more information about AVAs, please visit American Viticultural Area (AVA) and TTB P 5120.4, American Viticultural Area Manual for Petitioners.\n\nImported wine labeled with a foreign appellation of origin must conform to the requirements of the foreign laws and regulations governing the composition, method of production, and designation of wines available for consumption within the country of origin.\n\nThe appellation of origin on this example label is Hudson River Region, which is an AVA.\n\nWhen is an appellation of origin required?\n\nAn appellation of origin is not required on all wine labels. However, the label must include an appellation of origin if the wine is labeled with:\n\nA vintage date;\n\nA varietal designation;\n\nA type designation of varietal significance;\n\nA semi-generic designation;\n\nAn “estate bottled” claim; or\n\nA product name qualified with the word “brand” under the requirements of 27 CFR 4.39(j).\n\nGenerally, any one of the types of appellations (a country, state, etc.) may be used when an appellation is required. However, in some cases, only a particular type of appellation may be used. For example “estate bottled” wine must be labeled with a viticultural area. The use of certain appellations of origin may also satisfy the requirements of 27 CFR 4.39(i) with respect to the use of “grandfathered” brand names of viticultural significance.\n\nWhere should the appellation of origin be placed on the product?\n\nWhen an appellation of origin is required to appear on the label, it must appear on the Brand Label, which is defined as the label where the brand name appears and also includes the class and/or type of the wine.\n\nWhat are the formatting requirements?\n\nWhen required, the appellation must appear in direct conjunction with, and in lettering substantially as conspicuous as, the class/type designation.\n\nType size:\n\nFor containers of 187 ml or less:\n\nThe appellation of origin must be at least 1 mm in size and substantially as conspicuous as the class/type designation\n\nFor containers of over 187 ml:\n\nThe appellation of origin must be at least 2 mm in size and substantially as conspicuous as the class/type designation\n\nLegibility:\n\nMust be readily legible under ordinary conditions;\n\nMust appear on a contrasting background; and\n\nMust appear separate and apart from, or be substantially more conspicuous than, descriptive or explanatory information.\n\nWhat does “Estate bottled” mean and what are the requirements for its use?\n\n“Estate bottled” means that 100 percent of the wine came from grapes grown on land owned or controlled by the winery, and both the winery and the vineyard must be located within the boundaries of the labeled viticultural area. The winery must crush and ferment the grapes, and finish, age, process, and bottle the wine in a continuous process on its premises (the wine at no time having left the premises of the bottling winery).\n\nWine labeled as “estate bottled” must meet the requirements for using a viticultural area as the appellation of origin and be labeled with that viticultural area.\n\nWhat are the requirements for use of appellations on wine labels?\n\nThe charts below set forth the minimum percentage requirements for different appellations of origin. Other requirements for use of an appellation of origin are also set forth in the regulations.\n\nDomestic Wines\n\nAPPELLATIONREQUIREMENTS FOR USE…The United States or American1) Not less than 75 percent of the wine must be derived from fruit or agricultural products (as applicable) grown in the United States;

AND\n\n3) The wine conforms to the laws and regulations governing the composition, method of manufacture, and designation of wines in all of the States listed in the appellation.\n\nA county\n\nThe appellation must be\n\nidentified with the word “county” in the same size of type as, and in letters as conspicuous as, the name of the county.\n\n1) Not less than 75 percent of the wine must be derived from fruit or agricultural products (as applicable) grown in the named county; AND\n\n2) The wine must be fully finished (except for cellar treatment pursuant to §4.22(c), and blending that does not result in an alteration of class or type under §4.22(b)) in the State in which the named county is located; AND\n\n3) The wine must conform to the laws and regulations of the named appellation area (including the law of the State in which the county is located) governing the composition, method of manufacture, and designation of wines made in such county.\n\nMulticounty appellation\n\nComprising two or no more than three counties in the same State.\n\n1) All of the fruit or agricultural products (as applicable) were grown in the counties indicated; AND\n\n2) The percentage of the wine derived from fruit or agricultural products (as applicable) grown in each county is shown on the label with a tolerance of plus or minus two percent.An approved American\n\nviticultural area (AVA)1) Not less than 85 percent of the wine must be derived from grapes grown in the named viticultural area; AND\n\n2) The wine must be fully finished (except for cellar treatment pursuant to §4.22(c), and blending that does not result in an alteration of class or type under §4.22(b)) in the State (or one of the States) in which the named viticultural area is located.\n\nForeign/Imported Wines\n\nAPPELLATIONREQUIREMENTS FOR USE…A foreign country1) Not less than 75 percent of the wine must be derived from fruit or agricultural products (as applicable) grown in the named country AND\n\n2) The wine must conform to the laws and regulations of the named country governing the composition, method of production, and designation of wines available for consumption within that country.A foreign state, province, territory, or similar political subdivision of a country equivalent to a State or county1) Not less than 75 percent of the wine must be derived from fruit or agricultural products (as applicable) grown in the named foreign equivalent of a State AND\n\n2) The wine must conform to the laws and regulations of the country in which the wine was produced governing the composition, method of production, and designation of wines available for consumption within that country.\n\nA foreign equivalent of a multistate appellation\n\nComprising two or no more than three states, provinces, territories, or similar political subdivisions of a foreign country equivalent to a state which are all contiguous\n\n1) All of the fruit or agricultural products (as applicable) were grown in the states, provinces, territories, or similar political subdivisions of a country equivalent to a state indicated, and the percentage of the wine derived from fruit or other agricultural products grown in each state, province, territory, or political subdivision equivalent to a state is shown on the label with a tolerance of plus or minus 2 percent;

If you have any questions about foreign appellations of origin you may also contact TTB's International Affairs Division through the online contact form or 202-453-2260. Other helpful resources include:\n\nEuropean Community Names of Origin for Wine (from U.S./EC Trade in Wine Agreement); and\n\nWorld Wine Trade Group Agreement on Requirements for Wine Labelling.\n\nExamples of appellation on labels:\n\nDomestic Wine - “American” as the appellation\n\nThis wine is designated as “American Merlot.” “American” represents the appellation of origin (27 CFR 4.25(b)) and “Merlot” represents the varietal designation (27 CFR 4.23(b)). This designation means that at least 75 percent of the wine is derived from Merlot grapes grown in the United States. Since a varietal designation (Merlot) is used on this label, an appellation of origin (American) is required (27 CFR 4.23(a)).\n\nDomestic Wine - “County” as an appellation\n\nBecause this wine is vintage dated, an appellation of origin must be shown on the brand label (27 CFR 4.27(a)). In this case, a county (ZZZ County) serves as the appellation of origin.\n\nImported Wine - “Approved foreign viticultural area\" as an appellation"
