        "text": "Social districts are areas where people can walk with open, to-go containers of alcoholic beverages in a contiguous area. A social district may include both indoor and outdoor areas of businesses within the defined district during the days and hours established for the social district.\n\nThis page will be updated with additional resources and information as social districts are approved by City Council.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is a social district?\n\nSocial districts are contiguous areas in which people can walk with open, to-go containers of alcoholic beverages.\n\nBeverages must be purchased from a bar, restaurant or other establishment permitted by the North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and consumed within the boundaries and hours of the social district. Containers are labeled with the social district's logo to identify where the drink was purchased and is allowed.\n\nA business located within the social district can decide whether to participate in the activities of the district. Indoor and outdoor areas of a business may be included in the district.\n\nWhat does the city's social district ordinance do?\n\nThe ordinance:\n\nAllows for the creation of social districts in Charlotte. Each district must be approved by the Charlotte City Council.\n\nAdopts requirements provided by the state.\n\nDirects city staff to develop an application for creating a social district.\n\nAllows public comment on proposed districts on a case-by-case basis.\n\nRequires the City Council to approve each district's cup design and material.\n\nThe ordinance does not:\n\nCreate new social districts.\n\nImpose additional standards beyond those established by the state.\n\nRecommend single-use plastic cups.\n\nImmediately open an application process upon the ordinance's adoption by the council.\n\nAddress outstanding concerns in neighborhoods with existing ABC-permitted businesses.\n\nWho approves a social district?\n\nAny district must first be approved by the Charlotte City Council and named and designated in city code. The ABC Commission has final approval.\n\nNote, the council's approval of the ordinance on Aug. 22, 2022, simply allowed the city to consider community proposals for creating new districts.\n\nWhere can a social district be established and what are the requirements?\n\nIn general, an area with multiple ABC-permit-holding businesses may become a social district. To be approved, each new district must:\n\nEstablish boundaries, and days and hours of operation, and signage with this information.\n\nDevelop a management and maintenance plan.\n\nHave labeled containers (no glass, maximum 16 ounces) for ABC-permitted establishments in the district.\n\nHave signage for establishments within the district that do not sell alcohol, but allow consumption on their premises during social district hours.\n\nFor detailed information on the requirements, please reference the Social Districts Standards and Provisions(PDF, 1MB).\n\nHow can I apply to establish a social district?\n\nThe first step is to submit a pre-application through the embedded form below! This will allow City staff to assess your request and setup a time to meet with you to discuss your proposal. The entire application process is detailed in the Social Districts Standards and Provisions(PDF, 1MB).\n\nWho do I contact for more information?\n\nFor more information, please email socialdistricts@charlottenc.gov.\n\nApproved Social Districts"
