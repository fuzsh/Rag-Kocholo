Take the Vermont State Senate for example.\n\nThese labels are in the published block assignment file that we used to create this map, so we recognized that and used the labels. But in DRA 2020 itself, you can also change the district labels to whatever you want. Simply click on the gear icon (upper right) and then on the Map Settings expando and you’ll see the list of districts with their labels, colors, and target populations. You can edit the labels directly and then click Apply.\n\nUsing this same panel, you can swap district colors and pick completely different colors, too. To swap colors between districts, use the Up and Down arrows for each district.\n\nIn the image to the left you can see that I pushed the district BEN down two spots (by clicking the Down arrow next to BEN twice). When I click Apply, BEN will be yellow, CAL will be purple and CGI will be red.\n\nNow, if you want to pick a completely different color for a district, you can click on the district’s color swatch and the Color Picker will appear. Click the color you want. And then remember to click Apply, to apply your changes."
