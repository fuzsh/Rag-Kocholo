        "text": "To combat climate change, the Dutch government wants to reduce the Netherlands’ greenhouse gas emissions by 49% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and a 95% reduction by 2050. These goals are laid down in the Climate Act on May 28, 2019. The Climate Plan, the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) and the National Climate Agreement contain the policy and measures to achieve these climate goals.\n\nThe Climate Act and the National Climate Agreement set out the Netherlands’ climate goals\n\nThe Climate Act should give individuals and companies in the Netherlands more certainty about the climate goals. Under the Climate Act, the government is required to draw up a Climate Plan setting out measures to ensure that the targets stipulated in the act are achieved. The National Climate Agreement contains agreements with the sectors on what they will do to help achieve these climate goals.\n\nNational Climate Agreement\n\nThe National Climate Agreement, which was concluded at June 2019, contains agreements with the sectors on what they will do to help achieve the climate goals. The participating sectors are: electricity, industry, built environment, traffic and transport, and agriculture.\n\nThe agreement is based on the principle that reducing carbon emissions must be feasible and affordable for everyone. The government therefore seeks a cost-efficient transition that limits the financial impact on households as much as possible and implements measures to fairly distribute the financial burden between citizens and businesses.\n\nThe annual additional costs for the Netherlands associated with the Climate Agreement are less than 0.5% of GDP in 2030. The Dutch society should be able to afford this transition.\n\nAnother key element of the deal is that the Netherlands makes optimal use of available time until 2050. Measures will be introduced step by step to ensure nothing needs to be rushed. Moreover, the government will opt for the most cost-effective and future-proof approach.\n\nClimate Plan and National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP)\n\nThe Climate Agreement is an essential part of the Climate Plan, and of the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) that Member States of the EU are required to submit to the European Commission. The Dutch government has submitted the Climate Plan and the NECP to the House by the end of 2019.\n\nJudgment in the climate case brought by Urgenda against the State of the Netherlands"
