        "text": "Voting Rights Act. The federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 was designed to combat tactics denying minorities the right to an effective vote, including redistricting techniques like those above. As federal law, the Voting Rights Act overrides inconsistent state laws, just like the constitutional equal population rule overrides other state laws.From 1965-2013, the Voting Rights Act had an especially powerful provision targeting the jurisdictions with the worst history of discrimination. In these areas, the Voting Rights Act required every change in election rules to be run by the Department of Justice or a federal court before they took effect, stopping discrimination before it had the chance to work. In 2006, Congress last revisited the part of the statute designating which jurisdictions should be covered. But in 2013, the Supreme Court decided in Shelby County v. Holder that this 2006 renewal was not sufficiently tied to current conditions; their decision striking down the coerage provision essentially left no jurisdictions covered. In 2019, the House of Representatives passed a new coverage provision, but it did not proceed through the Senate.After Shelby County, the most powerful remaining provision of the Voting Rights Act is Section 2 of the Act, which blocks district lines that deny minority voters an equal opportunity “to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.” It applies whether the denial is intentional, or an unintended end result. Courts essentially test whether the way that districts are drawn takes decisive political power away from a cohesive minority bloc otherwise at risk for discrimination.There are three threshold conditions for a court finding that districts need to be redrawn because section 2 has been violated. (These are often called Gingles conditions, after the Supreme court’s Thornburg v. Gingles case.)\n\nThe first asks whether it is possible to draw a district so that a majority of voters belong to a geographically “compact” racial, ethnic, or language minority community. Compactness has never been precisely defined in this context, but generally refers to populations that are not particularly “far-flung,” and where the boundaries are fairly regular, without extensive tendrils. This first Gingles condition basically tests whether a sufficiently large minority population is geographically distributed so that they could control a reasonable district.\n\nThe second Gingles condition tests whether the minority population usually votes as a bloc, for the same type of candidate. This is a nuanced test: not whether the community usually votes for Democrats or Republicans (or others), but whether they would, given a fair mix of candidates, vote for the same type of Democrats or Republicans (or others).\n\nThe third Gingles condition tests the potential competition: whether the rest of the population in the area usually votes as a bloc for different candidates than those preferred by the minority community. If so, this would mean that the minority’s preferred candidate would almost always lose — if the minority community’s voting power were not specifically protected. Together, the second and third conditions are known generally as “racially polarized” voting."
