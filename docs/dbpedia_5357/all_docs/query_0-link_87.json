        "text": "Welcome to the Rosendale-Brandon School District Brand Guidelines. This document contains information about how our brand should be used in print and digital materials ensuring it remains consistent. Using our brand correctly is extremely important to us, so we ask that the guide is always referred and adhered to.\n\nRBSD Brand Guidelines_v1.0 2024\n\nColors\n\nSpartan Green and Spartan Gold. See page 11 of Brand Guidelines for exact color values.\n\nLogos\n\nSee pages 4-10 of Brand Guidelines. Access available logo files here: Logo Package.\n\nAnyone with questions regarding the use of district or school logos should contact webeway@rbsd.k12.wi.us.\n\nEPS -This file format is scalable to any size without loss of clarity. Use this file format whenever possible, especially on large scale pieces such as posters and banners. You will need to use Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw to open an EPS.\n\nPDF– This file is useful for documents such as magazine articles, product brochures, or flyers in which you want to preserve the original graphic appearance online. To view and use the files, you need the free Acrobat Reader, which you can easily download.\n\nPSD – This file is a layered image file used in Adobe PhotoShop. PSD, which stands for Photoshop Document, is the default format that Photoshop uses for saving data. A PSD file allows the user to work with the images’ individual layers even after the file has been saved. To open layer you need to use Adobe Photoshop.\n\nJPG -This file format is based on pixels so scaling files to use at larger sizes can result in loss of clarity.\n\nAI– This file is best used when Adobe Illustrator is available."
