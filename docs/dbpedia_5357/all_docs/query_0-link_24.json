Now I am trying to include text over the map but I am running into issues.\n\nI enabled labels for the area layers but the text is too small and I haven't seen a way to edit the font size for the labels.\n\nAnother route I took was having the map as a master item and use Vizlib KPI Designer to overlay text layers. The issue from this is that I think the map resizes based on screen resolution and thus has the text displayed in the wrong location that I need it to be.\n\nQuestions:\n\nis it possible to edit the area layer labels or edit the labels using CSS with Multi KPI?\n\nIs it possible to have the map remain in its location when changing between monitors so that I don't have to keep moving the text layers to the proper location?\n\nThanks"
