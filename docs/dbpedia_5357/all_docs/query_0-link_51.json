        "text": "Chelsea Piers Fitness, a sub brand of Chelsea Piers, has opened its latest branch within One Madison Avenue, a commercial office tower in Manhattan’s Flatiron district.\n\nUnveiled on the first day of August 2024, the new Chelsea Piers Fitness Flatiron spans 60,000 square feet across four floors. In addition to providing premium fitness equipment and wellness-related amenities, this elite Flatiron facility was designed to motivate communal engagement among members beyond scheduled classes and workouts.\n\nSam Bernstein, Chelsea Piers’ chief operating officer, pointed to the venue’s surroundings within Flatiron, including Madison Square Park, as what made it a great locality.\n\n“I think this location was really attractive to us because of its proximity to residential and office communities,” said Bernstein. “We spent a lot of time thinking about what we could build with SL Green Realty Corp. (which owns One Madison Avenue), and it was as much a project of collaboration and partnership in getting us to a place where we could build something that is truly distinctive and unique.”\n\nChelsea Piers Fitness Flatiron marks the brand’s fifth location, with other New York City spots in Chelsea, Downtown Brooklyn and Prospect Heights, plus one in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nDesigned in partnership with Dan Fink Studio, an interior design and architectural firm, the Chelsea Piers Fitness Flatiron evokes inspiration from Chelsea Piers’ founding location along the Hudson River on the West side of Manhattan. Its design also draws upon iconic examples of Beaux-Arts architecture in New York City such as the New York Public Library and Grand Central Terminal.\n\nAmid Terrazzo flooring, the Chelsea Piers Fitness Flatiron sports some nods to Chelsea Piers’ flagship location with red trusses and a grand staircase tying into Chelsea Piers’ Pier 60. Custom leaded stained-glass windows reflect the bluish and greenish hues of the Hudson.\n\nThe layout of the Chelsea Piers Fitness Flatiron includes a massive members lounge and co-working space to foster a communal gathering spot. This 6,000-square-foot lounge is furnished with many library-style tables and privacy booths and a dedicated quiet area. The Kids Clubhouse provides childcare services for youngsters ages 3 months and up.\n\n“When you think about our brand, the most important thing we think about is how to bring people together,” said Bernstein. “Members can come in and work with each other throughout the day, and then we program the space with different member events throughout the month.”\n\nCollective wellness at the Chelsea Piers Fitness Flatiron is also linked to a Co-Ed Contrast Therapy Suite containing an infrared sauna among other amenities.\n\nSix studio spaces host more than 120 classes per week in cycling, yoga, barre, strength training, running, HIIT and both Pilates Mat and Reformer. Among them, an Infrared Studio is where heated classes will take place. A Himalayan-Salt Studio will also host classes.\n\nA strength floor consists of a 4,000-square-foot multi-functional turf, complete with boxing bags, Olympic platforms and complimentary fitness assessments.\n\nA separate cardio dedicated floor is stacked with a second functional turf, Peloton bikes and a fleet of Woodway equipment. It also holds Life Fitness’ Symbio treadmills and is said to be the only gym in New York with this equipment.\n\nAccording to Ariel Calderon, vice president of architecture + design at Chelsea Piers Fitness, the Himalayan-Salt Studio is based on the wellness trend of halotherapy—or salt therapy—and contains Himalayan Salt bricks. “It also will have all the benefits that wellness followers are trying to achieve,” said Calderon, citing respiratory health and skin conditions. Further with wellness, a Co-Ed Contrast Therapy Suite is equipped with a 10-person infrared sauna.\n\nA curated collection of commissioned artwork rounds out the location, with pieces by area New York artists drawing upon the Flatiron neighborhood.\n\nChelsea Piers Fitness Flatiron is located in One Madison Avenue, at 308 Park Ave S in Manhattan."
