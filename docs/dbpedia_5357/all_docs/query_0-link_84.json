Using consistent fonts will help people recognize that content is from the district.\n\nMain Font: Lato\n\nLato is a sleek sans serif typeface that seems “transparent” when used in body text but displays some original traits when used in larger sizes. It uses classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. The font family has many weights (thicknesses), so your designs can still feel varied while staying in the one font family.\n\nLato is one of the available fonts in Google Docs, and if you want to add it to your computer for Microsoft Word or other programs, you can use the button below to download it for free.\n\nDownload Lato from Google Fonts for free\n\nDecorative Font: Nothing You Could Do\n\nNothing You Could Do is a handwriting font; it is human, it is imperfect, and it is natural. Real humans don’t write perfectly neatly, and this font creates that feeling of authenticity.\n\nDownload Nothing You Could Do from Google Fonts for Free\n\nThe point of using a decorative font (also known as a display font) is to grab attention with a really unique look. Our decorative font offers a customized look to our brand, however you should use it sparingly. Use it for headers or short phrases (on a t-shirt, for example). Do not use decorative fonts in body text as it becomes difficult to read.\n\nNeed Help Installing a Font?\n\nMicrosoft Word has a good guide on how to install fonts for both Apple and Windows computers.\n\nDistrict School-Year Theme: Better Every Day\n\nThe theme for the 2024-2025 school year is Better Every Day in Every Way. Note that we are using three words and not the two-word Better Everyday, which has a slightly different meaning. It is available to download in blue and white. Do not use a similar font for other elements in your designs.\n\nOn social media, use #BetterEveryDay whenever you are showcasing examples of the district thriving and succeeding. Note that it is written all together with capital letters for each of the words.\n\nDownload the Better Every Day logos\n\nMust be logged into\n\nDistrict Google Account\n\nEmail Signatures\n\nWhen we communicate with parents, community partners, co-workers and other stakeholders through email, it is important for us to establish a professional tone in our communication. The essential contact details at the end of your message provides recipients with the valuable information needed to get in touch with you as well as details on the overall structure of our school district.\n\nAs we all know, email threats are getting more complex. Hackers are using advance tactics to target users and bypass email security. By implementing a standard email signature, we add another layer of security and brand protection by providing assurance to the recipient that you are a legitimate source. All staff are required to have their first and last name appear at the top of their email signature.\n\nSignatures should be text-based and not an image. While the image signatures usually include the required information, they are not accessible and people who use screen readers are not able to access the content.\n\nSignature Format\n\nName\n\nJob Title\n\nSchool or District Address\n\nPhone Number(s)\n\nWebsite URL\n\nEmail Address\n\nSignature Example\n\nEdwin Birch\n\nExecutive Director of Communications and Marketing\n\nKCKPS\n\n2010 N 59th Street\n\nKansas City, Kansas\n\nO: 913-279-2242\n\nC: 913-304-2981\n\nwww.kckschools.org\n\nEdwin.Birch@kckps.org\n\nYou also have the option of adding pronouns in your email signature if you want people to know how to address you in future email communications as well as quotes and images such as the district logo.\n\nBusiness Cards\n\nThe Communications Department has designed a business card that will help you share your information while promoting our brand. Costs for these cards come from your department or school budget, so make sure you have approval before submitting a request.\n\nBe deliberate with the information you provide. A business card should not be a resume or CV. Adding too much information causes important information on the card to be lost. The user of the card expects to find your email or phone number at a quick glance, not search through a list of credentials, titles and office locations. Keeping this in mind, there are two info lines available for you to add relevant information. Your title must be listed first but then you have limited room to add a degree, pronouns, or your department or program.\n\nTo request business cards, email the Print Shop with the information you would like included on the card.\n\nGraphic Elements\n\nWe have created a number of graphic elements you can use when you are designing flyers, social posts, and other graphics. You are not required to use these elements but using these will help you stay in the colors of our brand.\n\nBackgrounds/Patterns/Textures\n\nHere is a sample of the backgrounds available for download.\n\nDownload Backgrounds\n\n(must be logged into\n\nDistrict Google Account)\n\nCallouts\n\nCallouts can be used to highlight key pieces of information. Here are a few of the available callouts with some examples of how they can be used.\n\nDownload Callouts\n\n(Must be logged into\n\nDistrict Google Account)"
