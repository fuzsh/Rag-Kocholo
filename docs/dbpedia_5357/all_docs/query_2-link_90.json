The paid sick leave law was one of several changes to worker rights mandated by Initiative 1433, approved by Washington voters in 2016.\n\nHow much paid sick leave can I earn?\n\nYou must earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours you work. Employers may provide more leave if they choose.\n\nYou began earning paid sick leave on your first day of work on or after Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nIf you do not use all of the paid sick leave you’ve earned by the end of the accrual year, your employer must carry over balances of 40 hours or less to the next year.\n\nAm I paid the same for a sick leave hour as I am for a regular work hour?\n\nYes. Your employer must pay your earned paid sick leave hours at your normal hourly compensation.\n\nWhen may I use my earned paid sick leave?\n\nYou may use this leave:\n\nFor a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition or if you need a medical diagnosis or preventative medical care.\n\nIf a family member (see below) needs care for a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition, or needs a medical diagnosis or preventative medical care.\n\nIf your workplace or your child’s school or place of care has been closed for any health-related reason by order of a public official.\n\nIf you are absent from work for reasons that qualify for leave under the state’s Domestic Violence Leave Act (DVLA).\n\nHow soon may I begin using sick leave?\n\nYou may begin using earned paid sick leave 90 calendar days after your first day of work with your employer. If you separate from your employer and are rehired within 12 months, any days you worked before leaving your job will count toward this 90-day period.\n\nWhat family members may I use paid sick leave to care for?\n\nFamily members include your:\n\nChild - This may include a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, or child you are legally responsible for.\n\nParent - This may include your biological, adoptive, or foster parent, your stepparent, or someone who was your legal guardian or their spouse or registered domestic partner – or a person who was legally responsible for you when you were a minor.\n\nSpouse.\n\nRegistered domestic partner.\n\nGrandparent.\n\nGrandchild.\n\nSibling.\n\nIs my employer required to notify me of my right to paid sick leave?\n\nYes. All Washington employers must notify their employees of this right in writing (paper or electronic).\n\nYour employer must give you an initial, one-time notice explaining:\n\nThat you are legally entitled to paid sick leave.\n\nHow much paid sick leave you will earn.\n\nWhen you may use paid sick leave.\n\nThat they are prohibited from retaliating against you for using paid sick leave for any reason allowed by this law, or for exercising other rights within the Minimum Wage Act.\n\nSee an example of a notice. (En Español).\n\nAt least once a month, your employer must give you a statement (paper or electronic) that explains:\n\nHow much paid sick leave you earned since your last notice.\n\nHow much paid sick leave you used since your last notice.\n\nHow much unused paid sick leave is available to you.\n\n(Your employer may use regular payroll statements to notify you.)\n\nWhat if taking sick leave causes trouble for me at work?\n\nIf you use your paid sick leave for any reason allowed by this law, your employer is prohibited from disciplining you for this absence.\n\nIt’s also illegal for your employer to:\n\nNot pay you the current minimum wage.\n\nNot pay overtime owed to you.\n\nRetaliate or take any negative action against you for filing a complaint with L&I about paid sick leave, minimum wage or overtime – or for exercising any other right under the Minimum Wage Act.\n\nIf you have a complaint or suspicion about your employer not providing you with paid sick leave or violating your other rights under the Minimum Wage Act, you can report it to L&I.
