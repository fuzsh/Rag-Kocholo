How can I restore its display?\n\nANSWER\n\nIf the Living Area label has disappeared or was deleted, it can be regenerated by accessing the General Plan Defaults or by performing a Plan Check.\n\nTo display the Living Area label\n\nSelect Edit> Default Settings from the menu.\n\nIn the Default Settings dialog, select Plan from the list, then click Edit.\n\nIn the General Plan Defaults dialog that displays, place a check in the box beside Show Living Area Label.\n\nClick OK and Done to confirm the changes and close the dialogs.\n\nIf the Living Area label still does not display after enabling the setting above, please try the following:\n\nOpen one of your rooms up to specification and verify that either the Include in Total Living Area Calculation option or Use Default (Included) option is selected on the General panel. If all rooms on a floor level are set to be excluded in the total living area calculation, the Living Area label will not display.\n\nSelect Tools> Checks> Plan Check from the menu. In the Plan Check dialog, click the Done button. When the dialog closes, check to see if the Living Area label displays.\n\nNext, ensure that the \"Room Labels\" layer is displayed in the Layer Display Options dialog. This is the default layer for the Living Area label. You will also want to make sure that the Text Style assigned to this layer has a Character Height value large enough to be visible in the floor plan.\n\nIf the Living Area label still doesn't appear, click on an exterior wall within a floor plan view, and use one of the resize edit handles at either end of the wall to detach it from one of the other exterior walls that it's connected to. By opening the enclosed room area, the living area calculation will be forced to update. Navigate to Build> Floor> Rebuild Walls/Floors/Ceilings . Reconnect the walls to restore the enclosed room area, then navigate to Build> Floor> Rebuild Walls/Floors/Ceilings once again.\n\nYou can use one of the Text tools to place a text object, then insert the Living Area (%living.area%) macro.\n\nIf you continue to have trouble with populating the Living Area label, please provide a copy of the .plan file to our Technical Support department using the Technical Support Center."
