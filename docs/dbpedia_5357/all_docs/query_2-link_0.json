        "text": "We know what counties and municipalities are. But what are special districts?\n\nSpecial districts are independent government units created for a limited, specific purpose and, every year, new districts are created and existing ones dissolve.\n\nThe latest in-depth, encyclopedic count of special districts and all types of local governments in the United States is now available.\n\nReleased earlier this year, the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 Census of Governments Organization component provides statistics on governments in the United States as of June 2017 and shows changes since the last count in 2012.\n\nTables show counts by government type, state, population-size groups, function and school systems.\n\nLocal governments are classified into five types: county, municipal, township, special districts and school districts.\n\nCounty, municipal and township governments are general-purpose governments. The official count for those types of governments has not changed significantly since 2012.\n\nThen there are special districts.\n\nThey typically have a shorter lifespan and higher turnover than general purpose governments, but the difference in their counts was also relatively slim between 2012 and 2017: The 2017 Census of Governments added more than 1,500 special districts and removed roughly 1,260 that are no longer operating.\n\nSo why are states creating special districts these days?\n\nIn some cases, states create them to provide services to newly- developed geographic areas.\n\nIn other cases, the special purpose activity or services already exist, but residents expect a higher level of quality.\n\nFor example, a state may have fire protection services. However, the established governmental structure may not legally allow the fire district to raise enough funds to maintain the desired level of quality services.\n\nThat’s when a state may choose to create a special district. Most special districts can levy additional property or sales taxes, and may borrow money to buy or build facilities by issuing bonds.\n\nSome districts are only active for a limited time, usually as long as it takes to pay back a debt.\n\nBetween the 2012 and 2017 census, multifunction districts grew the most.\n\nMultifunction districts can collect property taxes and issue tax-exempt bonds. Legislation authorizing multifunction districts was passed in most states across the nation in the 1980s.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Colorado, the 2017 Census of Governments added close to 270 metropolitan districts to the master list of local governments in the state.\n\nMetropolitan districts can provide a wide array of services, such as fire protection, street improvements, recreation, mosquito control and television relay services.\n\nThese districts can collect property taxes and issue public debt. That’s why it’s important to keep track of public funds controlled by these districts.\n\nMost of the metropolitan districts in Colorado are development districts created to provide funding for development projects.\n\nIn Texas, multifunction districts, called Municipal Utility Districts (MUDs), also showed growth. The 2017 Census of Governments added nearly 200 units to the master list of local governments in Texas.\n\nMUDs provide a variety of utility services in areas not included in a municipality. These districts can finance developing infrastructure and housing.\n\nMUDs can incur public debts in the form of bonds to finance infrastructure and/or housing, and may dissolve in 15 to 25 years after the debt is paid in full.\n\nAs in Colorado, developers who see public-private partnerships as business opportunities usually drive the creation of multifunction districts.\n\nFinancing capital improvement was the leading force behind special district growth in Florida.\n\nThe 2017 Census of Governments added about 130 new Community Development Districts (CDD). In Florida, CDDs may finance a variety of community development projects, such as new sewage facilities.\n\nThe 2017 Individual State Descriptions publication provides a comprehensive description of the governmental organization for the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nSome of these districts are similar to Community Improvement Associations (CIAs) in size and scale of operations. Both are a result of the housing boom from 2003 to 2008.\n\nThe major difference is that CDDs are considered public government units that enjoy some tax exemptions, although this comes with other regulations and required transparency in governing these districts.\n\nThe 2017 Census of Governments data also reflect the creation of more water supply districts in New Mexico. Over 150 Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Associations were included as special district governments since the last census. Other states, including California, Arkansas, Missouri and Washington, also added between 10 to 20 water supply districts."
