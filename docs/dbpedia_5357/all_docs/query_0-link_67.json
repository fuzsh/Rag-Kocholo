        "text": "Leer en español\n\nThere’s District 9 supervisor candidate Roberto Hernandez, who was born in the Mission in 1956 and never left. And then there’s Michael Lai, who moved to District 11 in February and is running for supervisor this November.\n\nDoes it matter for the election?\n\nPolitical analysts and campaign managers say probably not, unless you are running in a district where voters prize a long residency.\n\nJason McDaniel, associate professor of political science at San Francisco State University, said that residency is less important in a place like San Francisco, where “a lot of people in San Francisco just moved to San Francisco.”\n\nBruce Cain, professor of political science at Stanford University, agreed. “Because it’s California, people rarely are born and stay in the same place,” Cain said. “It matters not as much as you would find in the East Coast, where it’s more stable.”\n\nEspecially in downtown neighborhoods, where people move in and out more frequently than others, short residency may not be as big of a deal, Cain said. “You may have a chance after a few years, putting your signs up everywhere.”\n\nTo run for district supervisor in San Francisco, a candidate only needs to reside and register to vote in their district for at least 30 days before filing the declaration of candidacy, according to the Department of Elections.\n\nThe 11 supervisors now in office had lived in their districts anywhere from 23 years (Dean Preston) to a little over a year (Hillary Ronen) when they won their first election. While she was well-known in District 9 as Supervisor David Campos’ legislative aide, Ronen only moved to the Portola in 2015. She won her 2016 election with more than 57 percent of the vote.\n\nThis year’s batch of supervisor candidates in San Francisco have resided in their district for as long as 68 years and as short as three months. The median length of residency is 10 years.\n\nDistrict 3 candidate Sharon Lai, for example, moved to her district only a year ago, although she says she first moved to San Francisco in 2005. In District 5, all three challengers against the incumbent, Preston, have lived in the district for less than four years. The newest face on the block there is Bilal Mahmood, who moved to the district in May 2023 after living adjacent to it for two years.\n\nLai, the District 11 candidate, moved to the Excelsior in February of this year, the most recent of all. While admitting that not having been “born and raised in the district” was his main weakness, Lai, like Mahmood, emphasized his goal to deliver.\n\n“There are too many career politicians and insiders, but a lot of them are not able to deliver results,” Lai said in an earlier interview with Mission Local.\n\nBacked by more than $225,000 from groups like GrowSF and Families for a Vibrant SF, Lai won a seat on the Democratic County Central Committee, San Francisco’s local party chapter, in March, and will likely receive similar financial support in the November supervisors’ race.\n\nBoth current supervisor Ahsha Safaí and his long-time opponent, former supervisor John Avalos, are critical of Lai joining the race without doing much work in the district.\n\n“It’s insulting to neighbors and community members to run after you’ve only lived somewhere for a few months,” said Safaí.\n\nHow long has each supervisor candidate lived in their district?\n\nChart by Junyao Yang.\n\nRandy Knox, a District 11 supervisor candidate in 2008 and a 35-year resident in the district, said he wishes that residency history mattered, but thinks that voters’ lack of engagement nowadays makes it difficult.\n\n“I’d like to think it is [important,] but I don’t think it is. I don’t think people are that invested in local politics, as much as they used to be,” Knox said. “The races center around PACs and 501(c)(3)s. And people feel like, ‘What’s the point of voting? It’s gonna be decided anyway by money.’”\n\nThat money can help make up for years in the district, but only to an extent in a local election, said Cain, the Stanford professor.\n\n“Sometimes it works, but a lot of times it doesn’t,” Cain said. “When you get down to the local government level, you are not as dependent on TV ads, you have to just go to meetings with people.”\n\nThat is, knocking on doors, meeting people at community meetings, and “displaying a personality.”\n\nThat was the approach Jessica Ho took. Ho, the moderate standard-bearer in the District 4 supervisor race in 2018, moved to the city in March that same year and worked as the legislative aide to then-Supervisor Katy Tang.\n\nBut, despite receiving a decent amount of endorsements and campaign contributions, she lost the race to Gordon Mar — even though Mar was far more left-leaning than the district he represented. Mar had been living in the district since 2005.\n\nHer plan at the time, Ho said, was to “show the work” by going to community meetings, answering questions and showing up when people needed her to, which proved not to be enough: After ranked-choice voting was tabulated, Ho received 43 percent of the votes, while Mar won with 57 percent.\n\nIn retrospect, Ho says that her newness in District 4, and the city for that matter, was one of her major weaknesses. “I think all voters in San Francisco deserve to trust their supervisor,” Ho said. “I don’t think there’s a time limit to prove it, but it comes with experience and relationships and time.”\n\n“The duty is to be a public servant, to learn your constituents, to know their issues, just like your family members,’” Ho added.\n\nEdward Wright, the campaign manager for Gordon Mar in the 2018 race, said the importance of long-term residence differs from district to district. “The neighborhood that feels less represented feels, more strongly, a sense of protection. How can you authentically and genuinely represent a place, a community you’ve never spent time with?”\n\nMcDaniel added that a short residency history may only matter to voters who do not intend to support that candidate in the first place. It was “other signals of community” that matter more in a district election, he said, such as home ownership and racial identity.\n\n“It’s about how committed you are to the neighborhood,” Wright said. “You’ll be making decisions with long-term impact. People want to know you are a stakeholder yourself.”\n\nAt the end of the day, even if the voters might not care when a candidate moves in, not knowing the neighborhood just makes it harder to run, Wright added.\n\n“People want to have a voice in City Hall. Issues at top of mind for people in the Sunset are different from those top-of-mind in the Excelsior or in the Mission,” he said. “There are big-picture themes, like public safety and homelessness, but also neighborhood-specific stuff you gotta have a handle on.”"
