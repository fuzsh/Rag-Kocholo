        "text": "SBCCD Brand Identity Standards\n\nAs the San Bernardino Community College District nears its first 100 years serving Inland Southern California, we are embracing a new visual identity system that distinguishes SBCCD as the home of Crafton Hills College, San Bernardino Valley College, and Empire KVCR TV/FM.\n\nEach element has been designed to project SBCCD with sophistication and clarity.\n\nWhen followed correctly this identity system expresses a sense of organizational integrity and purpose, better positioning SBCCD as a community and educational leader in the region.\n\nSBCCD Logos\n\nPrimary SBCCD Seal\n\nThe primary identity for the San Bernardino Community College District is a clean and straightforward logo consisting of a wordmark and a symbol. The logo is made up of the historic San Bernardino arrowhead, encircled in a yellow band, with the name of the district to form a cohesive brand. The primary logo should not be used smaller than one inch. Download Primary Logo\n\nSecondary SBCCD Identity\n\nThe secondary identity for the San Bernardino Community College District is used when the primary logo is too complex at a size smaller than one inch to be legible.\n\nDownload Horizontal Logo\n\nDownload Stacked Logo\n\nVirtual Backgrounds\n\nProfessional, SBCCD-themed virtual backgrounds are available for download to use with Zoom and other video conferencing platforms. Click each image to download.\n\nPowerPoint Template\n\nUse this template to create professional presentations representing SBCCD, your department or your work. Widescreen (16x9). Download\n\nPrint & Digital Colors\n\nColors are an essential element for the San Bernardino Community College District identity. This palette provides a foundation for color consistency across diverse types of media.\n\nPANTONE 1235 C\n\nPANTONE 116 U\n\nCMYK: 0c 31m 96y 0k\n\nRGB: 252r 181g 32b\n\nHex: #FCB520\n\nPANTONE 126 C\n\nPANTONE 126 U\n\nCMYK: 35c 48m 100y 14k\n\nRGB: 156r 119g 44b\n\nHex: #9C772C\n\nPantone Colors\n\nAn acronym for Pantone Matching System®, this color system is also often referred to as “spot” colors. This color system is for print jobs when an exact color match of yellow is necessary.\n\nCMYK Colors for Printing\n\nCMYK (or “process”) refers to the 4 ink colors that are used to create every other color of the rainbow. Those colors are cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y) and black (K). This is the colors system used for print pieces, and both solid colors and photographs should be converted to CMYK color for printing.\n\nRGB colors for Web\n\nRGB (red, green, blue) refers to colors used on screen only (web, phone, video, etc.). Photos and solid colors should be in RGB when intended for on-screen viewing.\n\nHEX Colors for Web\n\nHex refers to the hexadecimal number assigned to solid colors for use on the web. Hex formulas will appear as #xxxxxx.\n\nTypography\n\nWritten communications are an essential tool in the San Bernardino Community College District identity. Consistent typography plays a significant role in achieving this goal.\n\nPrimary Typeface\n\nAs the typography on the logo is News Gothic BT Bold Condensed and News Gothic BT Roman, it is also used as the primary typeface throughout the branding program to create a consistent look and feel.\n\nSecondary Typeface"
