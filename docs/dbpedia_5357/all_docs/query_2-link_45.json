Driver's License or DMV ID\n\nIf you have moved, you must first update your residence address with DMV\n\nRegister by Mail, Email, Fax\n\nDownload a voter registration form, complete it, and return it to your county board of voter registration by mail, fax, or email.\n\nRegister in Person\n\nVisit your county board of voter registration and register in person. You can also register while receiving services at various agencies including the Department of Motor Vehicles. See below for a complete list of agencies providing voter registration under the National Voter Registration Act.\n\nNational Voter Registration Act Agencies\n\nCongress enacted the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (also known as the “NVRA” and the “Motor Voter Act”), to enhance voting opportunities for every American. The Act has made it easier for all Americans to register to vote and to maintain their registration. The Act requires states to offer voter registration opportunities at all offices that provide public assistance and all offices that provide state-funded programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.\n\nIn South Carolina, the following locations provide voter registration under the NVRA:\n\nArmed Forces Recruiting Stations\n\nCommission for the Blind\n\nDepartment of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services\n\nDepartment of Disabilities and Special Needs\n\nDepartment of Health and Environmental Control\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\nDepartment of Mental Health\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles\n\nDepartment of Social Services\n\nProtection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities\n\nVocational Rehabilitation Department\n\nVoter Registration FAQs\n\nDownload a one-page sheet for facts about voter registration in South Carolina.\n\nWho can register?\n\nIn order to vote, South Carolina law requires one must first register to vote at least 30 days prior to the election. To be eligible to register in South Carolina you MUST:\n\nbe a United States citizen\n\nbe at least eighteen years old on or before the next election\n\nbe a resident of South Carolina in the county and precinct in which you are registering\n\nnot be under a court order declaring you mentally incompetent\n\nnot be confined in any public prison resulting from a conviction of a crime\n\nhave never been convicted of a felony or offense against the election laws OR if previously convicted, have served the entire sentence, including probation or parole, or have received a pardon for the conviction.\n\nWhat address do I use?\n\nYou must register at the address where you reside. For guidance in determining what residence to claim for voter registration purposes, see S.C. Code of Laws Section 7-1-25.\n\nWhen can I register?\n\nThere is no length of residency requirement in South Carolina in order to register to vote. You can register at any time.\n\nYou must be registered at least 30 days prior to any election in order to vote in that election. Registration by mail applications must be postmarked at least 30 days prior to that particular election to be eligible. If the deadline falls on a Sunday or U.S. Postal Service holiday, the postmark deadline is extended to the next day that is not a Sunday or holiday.\n\nCitizens who are not yet 18-years-old but will turn 18 before the next ensuing General Election, and who otherwise qualify to vote, have the right to register beginning 120 days prior to the closing of the books of a preceding primary (see S.C. Code of Laws 7-5-180).\n\nDo I have to choose a party?\n\nNo. South Carolina does not have registration by party. In primaries, you can vote in only one party’s primary.\n\nID Required to Register\n\nIf registering to vote by mail or in person, provide a copy of one of the following items:\n\nAny current, valid Photo ID; or\n\nA utility bill, bank statement, paycheck or government document showing your name and address in your county.\n\nCheck My Voter Registration Information\n\nNote: When checking your voter registration information, you must provide your name, county and date of birth as it appears on your voter registration card in order to view your information.\n\nCheck My Voter Registration\n\nIf you have a S.C. Driver’s License or DMV ID card, you can update your address using the online voter registration application. If you haven’t updated your DMV address, you must do that first:\n\nUpdate your address with DMV\n\nUpdate your voter registration address\n\nIf your voter registration information has changed (name, address, etc.), and you still live within the same county, you may update your voter registration information using this form. If you have moved to a different county, you will need to re-register in your new county (see How to Register above).\n\nStudents\n\nCitizens who are not yet 18-years-old but will turn 18 before the next ensuing General Election, and who otherwise qualify to vote, have the right to register beginning 120 days prior to the closing of the books of a preceding primary (see S.C. Code of Laws 7-5-180).\n\nStudents may register to vote where they reside while attending college. This could be at an address in the college community (e.g., a dormitory) or at an address you intend to return to while not in the college community (e.g., family home). For guidance in determining what residence to claim for voter registration purposes, see S.C. Code of Laws Section 7-1-25.\n\nMany college students who live on campus receive their mail at a campus post office box. These students must register at the physical address of their dormitory. The student’s P.O. Box can be provided for mailing and contact purposes.\n\nVoter Registration Drives\n\nIf you are planning a voter registration drive at an institution of higher learning, please make sure you have the National Voter Registration Application for students who maintain their residency outside of South Carolina. For a list of addresses of Election Commissions throughout the country please see the Election Assistance Commission web site.\n\nConvicted Felons\n\nAny person who is convicted of a felony or an offense against the election laws is not qualified to register or to vote, unless the disqualification has been removed by service of the sentence, or unless sooner pardoned. Service of sentence includes completion of any prison/jail time, probation and parole.\n\nFederal and state courts provide the SEC with lists of persons convicted of felonies or crimes against the election laws. Those persons are removed from the state’s list of active, registered voters. The SEC notifies each voter whose name is removed. Voters have 20 days from the date the notice is mailed to appeal. Appeals must be made to the SEC.\n\nOnce a person who was convicted of a felony or offense against the election laws serves his sentence, he may register to vote. To register, the applicant must submit a new voter registration application to his county voter registration office. To participate in any particular election, the applicant must submit the application prior to the 30-day voter registration deadline for that election. In applying, the registrant is swearing under penalty of perjury that he is qualified to register, including having completed his entire sentence. County voter registration boards must be satisfied that the applicant has completed his sentence; and in some cases, may request a person who has lost his voting rights due to conviction to provide proof that he has completed his sentence."
