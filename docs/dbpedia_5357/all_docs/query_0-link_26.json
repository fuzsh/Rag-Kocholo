        "text": "As the largest school district in the region, the Davenport Community School District has an inherent responsibility to lead. A large part of that leadership is reflected in how the District presents itself to the general public, parents and students, and internal staff. Providing clarity of thought and vision, developing internal alignment among staff and leadership, and creating a tangible identity from the intangible attributes of the School District­ are how a successful brand is built. This starts from the inside out.\n\nThe Davenport Community School District is well-positioned to write the next chapter in its rich history with a new vision, one that more accurately reflects the core values, mission and makeup of its diverse student population. Creativity and innovation abound within the District, requiring a new identity that better communicates these attributes. With an intense focus on the future, a new brand narrative is necessary to re-establish the Davenport Community School District as the leader in providing educational excellence for our future—our children.\n\nVisit Live Site\n\nTAG created a whole new brand for Davenport Community School District, from a new logo and website to new letterhead and brochures. Their brand was developed to reflect the newly crafted vision of “growing excellence”. The colors and patterns within the logo were specifically chosen to be a part of the brand. The colors symbolize the schools within the district, with each school being categorized under a primary color. The shapes within the logo spell out Davenport, with each shape being a part of a variety of different letters."
