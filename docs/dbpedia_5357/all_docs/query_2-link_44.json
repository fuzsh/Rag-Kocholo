        "text": "What is the \"Clean Hands\" Mandate?\n\nIn the District of Columbia, taxpayers can request a \"Certificate of Clean Hands\" that demonstrates that they are in compliance with their District financial obligations. The District's Clean Hands mandate requires that individuals and businesses be denied city goods or services (i.e. licenses, permits, grants, contracts) if there is a debt owed to the District of Columbia of more than $100 or if they have not filed required District tax returns.\n\nIn order to receive a Certificate of Clean Hands, a taxpayer must:\n\nnot owe more than $100 in any fees, fines, taxes, or penalties to OTR unless the debt is included in a valid payment agreement and is compliant with the Department of Employment Services (DOES)\n\nbe fully registered for all required tax types\n\nhave submitted all required District tax returns\n\nHow do I obtain a Certificate of Clean Hands?\n\nYou can request a Certificate of Clean Hands online at MyTax.DC.gov. If you have a District tax obligation, a MyTax.DC.gov account is required and the Certificate of Clean Hands can be generated from within your MyTax.DC.gov account. If you do not have a District tax obligation, a manual request can be submitted without logging in, by using the link to \"Request a Certificate of Clean Hands\" without logging in to MyTax.DC.gov.\n\nPlease note: We have discontinued the issuance of hard copies or prints for Certificate of Clean Hands at our Walk-in Customer Service Center.\n\nDo I Need a Taxpayer Identification Number?\n\nIf you are not a resident of the District, and you do not have a Social Security Number (SSN), you will need an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). The IRS issues ITINs to individuals who are required to have a US taxpayer identification number but who do not have, and are not eligible to obtain, an SSN. If you are in need of an ITIN, please see link How do I apply for an ITIN? | Internal Revenue Service (irs.gov). If you are not eligible for an ITIN, you will need to use a registered agent.\n\nResources:\n\nRequest a new Certificate of Clean Hands, or check the status of an existing Certificate of Clean Hands here.\n\nView Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).\n\nObtain a Certificate of Clean Hands; itâ€™s as easy as 1-2-3!
