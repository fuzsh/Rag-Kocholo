        "text": "Logo and Branding Usage Guidelines\n\nNOTE: The business card template can be found here.\n\nAll marketing materials are a representation of the University and its brand. Your assistance in maintaining this brand identity is crucial, and we rely on you to assist in introducing our new brand to the public successfully. Creating customized versions of any UDC branded materials in whole or in part without the express written consent of the Office of Marketing and Communications is strictly prohibited. If you have an immediate need that these guidelines do not address, please email udc-communications@udc.edu. Please do NOT create your own versions of these items.\n\nThe Official UDC Logo\n\nThe University Logo can be downloaded here.\n\nDo NOT use any of the previous versions of the logo; they are now outdated.\n\nThe University Seal\n\nThe University Seal is reserved for the Office of the President usage only, under approval from the Office of Marketing and Communications and University Events and Protocol. The University Seal should not be used on any promotional or marketing materials without approval from the Office of Marketing and Communications and University Events and Protocol. If you have questions, please email udc-communications@udc.edu.\n\nCollege/School/Department Logos\n\nUDC has logos for University Colleges, Schools and selected departments. To request these logos, please email udc-communications@udc.edu.\n\nThe Firebird Mascot Logo\n\nThe Firebird Mascot Logo is intended for use in UDC Athletics materials. The logo can be used in conjunction with the university logo in branded material but should be used as a secondary graphic element rather than a stand-alone logo, unless directly associated with Athletics.\n\nSize and Scaling Requirements\n\nALL logos must ALWAYS be placed with a fixed proportion of height to width. Do NOT stretch them wider/horizontally or taller/vertically. Scale each logo proportionally ONLY, i.e., with height and width percentages of the original logo size being equal (e.g., 90% width and 90% height).\n\nMinimum requirement for open space around the official UDC logo: Depth of open space around the logo should be equal to or greater than the X-height, which is the height of the capitol D in District. A diagram will be provided soon showing the amount of white space around the logo.\n\nMinimum size of the official UDC logo: Ideally, 2.5˝ wide, but it depends on the situation/layout. 1˝ wide for promotional premiums (e.g., pens, sticky notes, small items). The logo should not span the whole width of the page, but it should stand out predominately over the other elements. Most importantly, ALWAYS ensure that all text in the logo is legible at actual size.\n\nOfficial Logo Colors\n\nThe following are the official color breakouts for printing on coated paper and for Web applications. Layouts should be predominantly based on these colors or white.\n\nPMS 7620\n\nCMYK: 0, 95, 94, 28\n\nR-183 G-49 B-44\n\nWeb/Hex#: B7312C\n\nPrimary color PMS 142\n\nCMYK: 0,25,76,0\n\nR-239 G-189 B-71\n\nWeb/Hex#: EFBD47\n\nSecondary color PMS 422C\n\nCMYK: 0.0.0.44\n\nR-162, G-164, B-163\n\nWeb/Hex#: A2A4A3\n\nSecondary color\n\nBrand Fonts\n\nPrinted marketing materials: Helvetica Neue or Sabon (in all of their variations—Roman, bold, italic, etc.). Trajan Pro is the new display font for headlines or decorative elements like quotes; it will replace the previous fonts: AUBauer and Schniedler Initials.\n\nWeb pages and on-screen presentations: Source Sans Pro (in all variations—Roman, bold, italic—EXCEPT condensed). This font may also be used for the body of letters and for internal communications.\n\nNOTE: Most marketing materials will be created and produced by external vendors, and it is their individual responsibility, by copyright law, to purchase these fonts.\n\nThe University name should NOT be written/spelled out additionally next to the logo (unless completely unavoidable and with approval of the UDC marketing department).\n\nGraphics and Photography Usage\n\nDo not put the logo in a box. The old “boxy” style of the logo is no longer acceptable. Also, the bars and stars are no longer part of the UDC brand identity and should not be used as graphic elements. The star may be used as a small bullet only (font: Zapf Dingbats, key H)."
