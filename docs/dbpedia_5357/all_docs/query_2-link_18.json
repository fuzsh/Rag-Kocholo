        "text": "The Places API is a service that accepts HTTP requests for location data through a variety of methods. It returns formatted location data and imagery about establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest.\n\nWhy use the Places API\n\nCreate location-aware features to make detailed location data easily available to your users. The data available through the Places API is built on one of the most accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive place models of the real world. Here are example use cases for applications:\n\nDisplay condo rentals within major metropolitan areas with results targeted specifically to cities.\n\nInclude place details in a pickup or delivery status update.\n\nDisplay a list of parks in an area along with user-submitted photos and reviews.\n\nProvide people planning trips with contact information, reviews, and price levels for establishments along the way.\n\nWhat can you do with the Places API\n\nYou can use the Places API to include the following features in your applications:\n\nProvide place search results from different types of users queries, such as text input, nearby locations, and ambiguous or categorical user queries.\n\nEnable autocomplete features for different search types, either specific text queries or categorical queries.\n\nRefine the type of details returned about a place, such as operating hours, a summary, user reviews, and a photo.\n\nAdd high-quality photos to locations served by your application.\n\nMany Google Maps Platform APIs support place IDs, where the place ID uniquely identifies a place in the Google Places database and on Google Maps. There are many ways to obtain a place ID, including from the Places API, but also from the Geocoding API, Routes API, and Address Validation API.\n\nOnce you have a place ID, you can use the Places API to request more details about a particular establishment or point of interest, such as its complete address, phone number, user rating, and reviews.\n\nChoose your version of Places API\n\nPlaces API supports two API versions: Places API are the existing APIs and Places API (New) are the next generation versions of the APIs.\n\nWith the release of Places API (New), your first task is to decide which set of APIs to use. This is true if you are a new customer or an existing customer already using the APIs. Use this guide to learn the key differences between the two APIs.\n\nHow the Places API works\n\nResources\n\nThe following table summarizes the resources available through the Places API.\n\nPlaces API Places API (New) Note Find Place Text Search (New) There is no new version of Find Place. Text Search (New) has replaced it. Nearby Search Nearby Search (New) All requests using the existing API that include a text query should use Text Search (New) because Nearby Search (New) does not support text input. Text Search Text Search (New) Place Details Place Details (New) Place Photo Place Photo (New) Place Autocomplete Autocomplete (New) Query Autocomplete Autocomplete (New) Capabilities added to Autocomplete (New)\n\nHow to use the Places API\n\nThe steps below cover a typical use case scenario for using the Places API service. As you build out your solution, you can use additional endpoints, such as Nearby Search and Place Photos."
