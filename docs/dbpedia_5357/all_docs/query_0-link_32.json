One of the lots is pretty large, oddly shaped and it is split onto 2 sheets. Is there a way to have more than 1 parcel label, that is also dynamic to the parcel, so I can have it labeled in different areas of the lot within the plat?\n\nI have had this issue in the past and just did a manual label but it is not dynamic. I even tried manual text with fields to try and grab the parcel area information but there doesn't seem to be a field option with parcels.\n\nI am currently using Civil 3D 2017 & 2018.\n\nThanks!"
