If you need more detailed or specific assistance after reviewing this information, we strongly recommend working with a professional consultant who is familiar with our local zoning rules and procedures. They can provide a more in-depth understanding of the code and advice tailored to your specific property.\n\nAccess King County Zoning Codes and other code information to learn more about your property such as setbacks, allowed and permitted uses, and more.\n\nZoning codes\n\nKing County code, Tile 21A Zoning\n\nSection 21A.08\n\nThis part of the code provides information about what types of structures and uses are permitted on a property based on its zoning designation. Here's an overview of some information you can find in this section of code:\n\nPermitted Uses: The code provides a detailed list of residential land uses (single-family homes, apartments, townhouses, mobile home parks, etc.) and whether they are permitted in different zoning areas.\n\nConditional and Special Uses: There are some uses that may be allowed under certain conditions or special circumstances. For example, an apartment or a townhouse might be allowed in a certain zone, but only if specific conditions are met.\n\nAccessory Uses: The code specifies what types of accessory uses (additional activities or structures that are secondary to the main use of the property, such as home offices or accessory dwelling units) are allowed.\n\nTemporary Lodging: Information about temporary lodging options like hotels, motels, or bed and breakfast establishments is also provided.\n\nDevelopment Conditions: The code outlines specific conditions that must be met for certain types of development. These could include restrictions on site disturbance, requirements for accessory dwelling units, limitations on mobile home parks in certain zones, and more.\n\nProhibitions: The code also specifies what is not allowed. For example, any accessory use not expressly permitted by this chapter or by the director is prohibited.\n\nAnd more...\n\nSection 21A.12\n\nThis part of the code provides detailed regulations on the density and dimensions of structures that can be built in different types of zones. Some of the topics covered in this section are:\n\nDensities and dimensions: This table provides detailed information on the allowed density and dimension standards for different types of residential and rural zones. The table includes information on things like base density, maximum density, minimum density, minimum lot area, minimum lot width, minimum street setback, minimum interior setback, base height, maximum height, and maximum impervious surface.\n\nInterpretation of tables: Which show how many homes can be built in an area, how big the buildings can be, and how much space needs to be left open.\n\nMeasurement Methods: This section likely provides detailed instructions on how to measure lot size, building height, setbacks, and other important dimensions.\n\nCalculations: Provides details on how to calculate the allowable dwelling units, lots, or floor area based on the site area used for base density and maximum density floor area calculations.\n\nSetbacks: Provides specific rules for setbacks for specific buildings or uses, from regional utility corridors, alleys, etc.\n\nHeight limits: Provides details on exceptions to height limits and specific height limits near major airports.\n\nNonresidential and residential zones: Provides rules for nonresidential land use in residential zones.\n\nJoint use driveway and easement width: Provides rules for driveways that are shared by multiple properties and the required width of easements.\n\nAnd more...\n\nBy understanding the regulations in this section of the code, a property owner can determine what they are allowed to build on their property, under what conditions, and what uses they can make of their property. If you are unsure, we recommend that hire a consultant to ensure correct interpretations of the code."
