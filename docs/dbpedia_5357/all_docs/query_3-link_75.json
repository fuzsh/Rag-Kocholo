        "text": "Artificial intelligence, the development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning and decision-making, has the potential to spur innovation and transform industry and government. As the science and technology of AI continues to develop, more products and services are coming onto the market. For example, companies are developing AI to help consumers run their homes and allow the elderly to stay in their homes longer. AI is used in health care technologies, self-driving cars, digital assistants and many other areas of daily life.\n\nConcerns about potential misuse or unintended consequences of AI, however, have prompted efforts to examine and develop standards. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, for example, is holding workshops and discussions with the public and private sectors to develop federal standards for the creation of reliable, robust and trustworthy AI systems.\n\nIn the 2023 legislative session, at least 25 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia introduced artificial intelligence bills, and 18 states and Puerto Rico adopted resolutions or enacted legislation. Examples of the enacted legislation and adopted resolutions include:\n\nConnecticut required the state Department of Administrative Services to conduct an inventory of all systems that employ artificial intelligence and are in use by any state agency and, beginning Feb. 1, 2024, perform ongoing assessments of systems that employ AI and are in use by state agencies to ensure that no such system shall result in unlawful discrimination or disparate impact. Further, the legislation requires the Office of Policy and Management to establish policies and procedures concerning the development, procurement, implementation, utilization and ongoing assessment of systems that employ AI and are in use by state agencies.\n\nLouisiana adopted a resolution requesting the Joint Committee on Technology and Cybersecurity to study the impact of artificial intelligence in operations, procurement and policy.\n\nMaryland established the Industry 4.0 Technology Grant Program to assist certain small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises with implementing new “industry 4.0” technology or related infrastructure. The definition of industry 4.0 includes AI.\n\nNorth Dakota enacted legislation defining a person as an individual, organization, government, political subdivision, or government agency or instrumentality, and specifying that the term does not include environmental elements, artificial intelligence, an animal or an inanimate object.\n\nTexas created an AI advisory council to study and monitor artificial intelligence systems developed, employed or procured by state agencies, with North Dakota, Puerto Rico and West Virginia also creating similar councils.\n\nState lawmakers also are considering AI’s benefits and challenges—a growing number of measures are being introduced to study the impact of AI or algorithms and the potential roles for policymakers.\n\nThis webpage covers key legislation related to AI issues generally. Legislation related solely to specific AI technologies, such as facial recognition or autonomous cars, is being tracked separately.\n\nArtificial Intelligence 2023 Legislation\n\nJan. 10, 2024\n\nState\n\nBill Number\n\nBill Title\n\nBill Status\n\nBill Summary\n\nCategory\n\nAlabama\n\nNone\n\nAlaska\n\nNone\n\nArizona\n\nH 2482\n\nAppropriations and Crime Victim Notification Fund\n\nEnacted\n\nProvides that the Law Enforcement Crime Victim Notification Fund is established consisting of legislative appropriations, enables the county or city, or both, or tribal law enforcement agency or university police department-based deployment of an automated crime victim notification system to a user base consisting of law enforcement agencies, appropriates funds.\n\nGovernment Use\n\nArizona\n\nS 1565\n\nBallot Processing and Electronic Adjudication and Limit\n\nVetoed\n\nRelates to ballot processing, relates to electronic adjudication, relates to limitation.\n\nElections\n\nArkansas\n\nH 1768\n\nRailroad Train Defectors Standard Requirements\n\nFailed - Adjourned\n\nCreates standard requirements concerning railroad train defect detectors.\n\nPrivate Sector Use\n\nCalifornia\n\nA 302\n\nDepartment of Technology: Automated Decision Systems\n\nEnacted\n\nRequires the Department of Technology, in coordination with other interagency bodies, to conduct, on or before specified date, a comprehensive inventory of all high-risk automated decision systems, as defined, that have been proposed for use, development, or procurement by, or are being used, developed, or procured by, state agencies.\n\nGovernment Use\n\nCalifornia\n\nA 331\n\nAutomated Decision Tools\n\nPending\n\nRelates to the State Fair Employment and Housing Act.
