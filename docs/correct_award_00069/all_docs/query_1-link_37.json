        "text": "The Author\n\nArthur William Bertrand Russell, philosopher, mathematician, libertarian socialist and social critic, was born at Trelleck (Wales) in 1872. After graduating from Cambridge in 1894, he studied economics at Berlin University and gathered data for his first book, German Social Democracy (1896). In 1897 he published his fellowship dissertation, An Essay on the Foundation of Geometry, followed by The Principles of Mathematics in 1903 (\"mathematics and logic are identical\"). In collaboration with his former tutor A. N. Whitehead he wrote his major academic work, Principia Mathematica (1910-13). During the next years he turned to philosophical problems and was involved in political campaigns. For opposing the First World War he was jailed and dismissed from Trinity College as a result of the conviction. After the war he visited the Soviet Union and China. In 1927 he started a school project at Beacon Hill which lasted for five years. Married four times, he was notorious for his many affairs. After World War II he became a leading figure in the antinuclear weapons movement and received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. He died at Plas Penrhyn near Penhydendreath (Wales) in 1970.\n\nThe Work\n\nGerman Social Democracy (1896)\n\nAn Essay on the Foundations of Geometry (1897)\n\nCritical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz (1900)\n\nPrinciples of Mathematics (1903)\n\nOn Denoting (1905)\n\nPrincipia Mathematica (1910-1916 (with A.
