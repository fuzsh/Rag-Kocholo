        "text": "Let’s take a look at Bertrand Russell and Michel Foucault to uncover a way to move beyond job descriptions and act on your strengths and interests.\n\nIt is a special kind of philosopher that attracts the interest of the general public. And it is almost always because the philosopher takes an interest in the general public, and not the other way around.\n\nIn order for a philosopher to become a household name, it is not that the community at-large will suddenly show an affection for epistemological questions regarding the nature of mental states, or the like. Instead, the philosopher will tend to engage in more than solely academically-focused philosophical questions.\n\nOne glaring example of this is British philosopher Bertrand Russell. Russell is generally known as one of the founders of analytic philosophy, the co-author of Principia Mathematica—a landmark work in mathematical logic—and was advisor to Ludwig Wittgenstein. Needless to say, his philosophical work is extremely technical.\n\nStill, Russell was a public figure for nearly the entire 97 years of his life, culminating in a Nobel Prize, one of only three philosophers to ever win the award. This is because Russell was not solely interested in his complex philosophical ideas. Although he was an academic, he was never at a loss for convincing words about politics and human rights. He expressed these ideals in open letters to U.S. presidents, speeches during protests and in pamphlets he scribed from jail cells—the true mark of a people’s philosopher.\n\nNytimesBertrand Russell Chides U.S. on Its Vietnam Aims (Published 1964)\n\nOne of Russell’s biggest non philosophical impacts was his work regarding the dangers of nuclear warfare. He published widely on the issue in books as well as The New York Times and was the chairman of The Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation. Without this body of work, it is arguable that the 1945 bombing of Japan would not have been the only example of atomic war but just the first.\n\nAnd then there is Michel Foucault, who also engaged a large international following.\n\nLike Russell, Foucault made his feelings on human rights explicit. Additionally, he was openly gay and, at 57, the first public figure in France to die of AIDS complications. This, and his extremely readable writing, are good reasons why so many consider him more than just an intellectual idol.\n\nUnlike Russell however, many of Foucault’s political ideas are intertwined with his philosophical writings. Maybe the most explicit example of this is his seminal work Discipline and Punish. In a slight oversimplification, the book essentially tells the story of the history of the prison system.\n\nThis includes the treatment of the prisoner, rehabilitation after incarceration, the actual logistics of running a prison, and everything in between. Well, you may be saying, surely this seems like the job of a historian, not a philosopher.\n\nBut Foucault is not merely presenting a chronological timeline of facts about prisons. Rather, he is taking this information and telling the human story.\n\nThe Human Story\n\nAs Foucault points out, punishment used to be a public spectacle. There would be hangings right in the town square! But, what about today? There is nothing more isolated and private than prisons.\n\nThe historian's job stops here; to document this change. But important questions remain, such as what caused this change and is it for the better?\n\nFoucault tells us that instead of a punishment of the body, like a hanging or a guillotine in the town square, prison today is interested in punishing the soul. Although this is not as physically harmful, its impact may be much greater.\n\nFor one thing, this isolationist treatment of those incarcerated more closely resemble animals than humans. But even after the time served, those in prison are very often seen as Other, thanks to governmental policy and pop culture displays of prisoners. What this does individually and to a family can be soul-crushing.\n\nThis is only one instance in Discipline and Punish where Foucault does the research of a historian to gather facts, but then pushes these facts to provide an explanation.\n\nFoucault’s Leadership\n\nOn paper, Foucault is a classically trained philosopher, earning multiple philosophy degrees from highly acclaimed schools, including the elite École Normale Supérieure (ENS). But he is so much more than a philosopher. He is also a historian, an author, anthropologist and activist.\n\nLooking at the multi-faceted careers of Russell and Foucault helps us understand the cons of a narrow job description and single-arrowed careers. Of course, their brain power, degrees and societal status helped enable their accomplishments.\n\nWe all don’t have such privileges. But the dynamic of reshaping our careers and exploring new ways to thrive professionally is the same.\n\nTo be a leader in today’s world, you cannot be bogged down by a job description. It is imperative to act on your strengths and interests even if you may not be explicitly asked to do more or different by your place of work.\n\nIt shows responsibility, ambition and vigor, and gets to the heart of what makes a great worker or leader: focus on your passions and act."
