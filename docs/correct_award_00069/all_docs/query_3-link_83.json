        "text": "To Dr. Ludwik Silberstein: „First & foremost let me thank you most warmely for ,solutio problematis marmalator’ - I was in town for the week-end & thouroughly enjoyd the ,solution’ - I do hope it does not mean that you have used up your month’s jam ration in obtaining it? I think you should certainly add the matter of angle-measurement that you send me. It is very agreeable getting the angle-sum of a triangle = a straight angle. It seems to me to complete your work in a most interesting way.“ In fine condition. Though perhaps best known for his work in philosophy, much of Russell’s early life was dedicated to mathematics - An Essay on the Foundation of Geometry (1897), The Princeiples of Mathematics (1903), and Principia Mathematica (1910-13) were among his early, important works on the subject..\n\nAn Herrn Silverstein dem er seine letzte Rede übermittelt: „[…] As for Mr. Kennedy's administration--we must wait to see what it does; so far, what we see is Laos and more Polaris missiles. The spread of nuclear weapons to new Powers immensely increases the danger of nuclear war and therefore the likelihood of disaster. Chemical and biological warfare are as much to be condemned as nuclear warfare. The only answer to all dangers is the outlawing of war. […]“ \". . . \"\n\nTo the British naturalist and ornithologist James Fisher (1912–1970) whom he gives a positive feedback on the 'Provisional' Plan and willingness to make adjustments.: „[…] I think your 'entirely provisional' plan is excellent, and I am quite prepared to have you cut out wahtever is necessary in order to reduce it to the requisite length. I am grateful to you for your information about coconuts and for your enlargement of my very meagre dendrological knowledge. I am quite willing to substitute ,sticks’ for ,coconuts’, though I regret the necessity as it maked a less vivid picture. […]“\n\nAn Gerald Götting, den Vorsitzenden der CDU in Ost-Berlin. Plas Penrhyn 27.I.1962, mit dem Dank für ein Buch über Ikonen. \"... Thank you very much indeed for sending me the book Ikonen. It is a beautiful book, and I have derived very great pleasure from the pictures that it contains ...\" - Im Ost-Berliner Union Verlag war 1961 in der Reihe Altrussische Kunstdenkmäler das Werk \"Ikonen\" von Konrad Onasch erschienen. Plas Penrhyn 24.I.1963. \"... I am very grateful to you for your kind words and for your good wishes to me.\n\nAll addressed to the Russian journalist and poet Igor Mikhailusenko (b. 1932) concerning Russia and the Cold War: \"[...] I believe that the two German States are equally dangerous. Western Germany is fanatically obsessed with the cold war and Eastern Germany is a cruel, vicious tyranny, capable of keeping its population within its borders only with barbed wire and machine guns. I think that the Government of the Soviet Union and the Government of the United States have a responsibility to come to an agreement which reflects the interests of peace and not the interests of either German State.\n\nTo his friend and colleague, the physical chemist Professor Mansel Morris Davies (1913-95) in Aberystwyth: \"[...] I am sorry that it is not likely I shall be able to accept your invitation, because I am, at the moment, so overwhelmed with commitments in the work against nuclear war that I have taken on, and in projects such that I will [corrected to: shall] be obliged to reject many invitations I should wish to accept. I shall keep your invitation in mind, and should it be possible for me to accept it I shall inform you [...]\" - An eminent historian and philosopher of science, Davies taught at Aberystwyth from 1947 to 1977. His obituary described him as \"a passionate crusader for social and political justice, a lifelong militant pacifist, a Pugwash participant, a committed humanist with strong leanings towards Buddhism, a prolific author and letter writer, a discriminating collector, a riveting anecdotalist, a man of omnivorous literary, musical and scientific tastes\". - Traces of folds and of scotch tape along edges of upper left corner. On Russell's stationery with printed Plas Penrhyn letterhead (watermarked \"Papyrus Regia\")."
