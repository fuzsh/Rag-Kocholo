        "text": "Bertrand Russell received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950 in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he championed humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.\n\nHe was one of the spiritual and financial founders of LSE, and his involvement in the early life of the School helped to define its ethos. From 1895 to 1896 he taught German social democracy, the theme of his first book. From 1937 to 1938 he lectured on the science of power. A mathematician, philosopher and public figure, his influence was felt around the globe."
