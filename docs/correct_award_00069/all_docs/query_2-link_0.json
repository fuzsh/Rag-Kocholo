        "text": "Earl (Bertrand Arthur William) Russell\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1950\n\nResidence at the time of the award: United Kingdom\n\nPrize motivation: “in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought”\n\nLanguage: English\n\nPrize share: 1/1\n\nWork\n\nBertrand Russell made his first pioneering contributions within the branch of philosophy that deals with logic and mathematics. His authorship came to encompass considerably larger areas, however. His writing is characterized by levity and humor and extended knowledge about science and philosophy to a wide circle of readers. His authorship also embraces social and moral issues, and his standpoints often were controversial. Russell was an advocate for reason and humanism and a dedicated defender of freedom of speech and freedom of thought."
