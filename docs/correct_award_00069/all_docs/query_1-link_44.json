        "text": "(1872–1970). During his almost 98 years, British philosopher and social reformer Bertrand Russell was a scholar in almost every field: philosophy, logic, mathematics, science, sociology, education, history, religion, and politics. He was a pacifist, an advocate of social justice, and a proponent of nuclear disarmament. Yet it was for literature that he won the Nobel Prize in 1950. He was the author of several dozen books, many of them written for a general audience.\n\nBertrand Arthur William Russell was born on May 18, 1872, at Trelleck in Monmouthshire, England. He was the second son of Viscount Amberley, a title to which he succeeded in 1931 after his brother Frank’s death. His parents died when he was quite young, so he was brought up by his paternal grandmother. He was educated privately in his early years before entering Trinity College, Cambridge. He took mathematics honors in 1893 and graduated in 1894. For two years Russell lectured in the United States before returning home to a lectureship at the London School of Economics.\n\nOne of Russell’s goals was to prove that mathematics could be derived from self-evident principles. His first attempt to do so was in The Principles of Mathematics, published in 1903. Ten years later the task was advanced with Principia Mathematica (1910–13), written with Alfred North Whitehead. Russell received a teaching appointment at Trinity College in 1910 but lost it in 1916 because of his pacifism. He was also jailed for six months in 1918. While in prison he wrote Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy (1919). Russell visited the Soviet Union in 1920 and afterward wrote a highly critical book, The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism (1920). During the next 12 years he published a number of other popular books, including What I Believe (1925), Why I Am Not a Christian (1927), and Marriage and Morals (1929). His philosophical speculations on the nature of knowledge were published as Human Knowledge, Its Scope and Limits (1948)."
