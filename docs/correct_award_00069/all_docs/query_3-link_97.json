        "text": "On this day in 1872 English philosopher and Nobel Prize winner Bertrand Russell was born.\n\nHe won the Nobel Prize for literature after publishing his Principia Mathematica and other works but is today equally admired for his fearless political campaigning for peace and nuclear disarmament. He was arrested many times at demonstrations and received a seven day jail sentence for breach of the peace at the age of eighty-nine.\n\nRussell received many honours including the OBE from King George VI who, mindful of his political activities said: “You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted”. Russell later claimed that he nearly replied: “That’s right, just like your brother” (who abandoned the throne for Mrs Simpson).\n\nI think he would have liked this poem by George William Russell (no relation), Brotherhood:\n\nTwilight, a blossom grey in shadowy valleys dwells:\n\nUnder the radiant dark the deep blue-tinted bells\n\nIn quietness re-image heaven within their blooms,\n\nSapphire and gold and mystery. What strange perfumes,\n\nOut of what deeps arising, all the flower-bells fling,\n\nUnknowing the enchanted odorous song they sing!\n\nOh, never was an eve so living yet: the wood\n\nStirs not but breathes enraptured quietude.\n\nHere in these shades the ancient knows itself, the soul,\n\nAnd out of slumber waking starts unto the goal.\n\nWhat bright companions nod and go along with it!\n\nOut of the teeming dark what dusky creatures flit,\n\nThat through the long leagues of the island night above\n\nCome by me, wandering, whispering, beseeching love;\n\nAs in the twilight children gather close and press\n\nNigh and more nigh with shadowy tenderness…"
