        "text": "\"To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.\"\n\n- Bertrand Russell\n\nBertrand Russell was an intellectual giant of the 20th century who bore witness to his generation's painful transition from Victorian optimism to postwar trauma. He always believed that ideas could change the world.\n\nHe was closely involved in many of the events that shaped world politics during the first two-thirds of the 20th century. Despite being a renowned philosopher, Russell is perhaps best known for his political activism and altercations with the British government. In academic circles, he is best known for his pioneering work in mathematics, philosophical logic and epistemology.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAbout Russell's world-changing ideas:\n\nOn mathematical logic\n\nRussell had great influence on modern mathematical logic. The American philosopher and logician Willard Quine said Russell's work represented the greatest influence on his own work. Russell's first mathematical book, An Essay On the Foundations Of Geometry, was published in 1897\n\nInterested in the definition of number, Russell studied the work of George Boole, Georg Cantor, and Augustus De Morgan. Russell defended logicism -- the view that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic -- and along with his former teacher, Alfred North Whitehead, wrote the monumental Principia Mathematica, an axiomatic system on which all of mathematics can be built\n\nOn language and philosophy\n\nRussell was not the first philosopher to suggest that language had an important bearing on how we understand the world; however, more than anyone before him, Russell made language, or more specifically, how we use language, a central part of philosophy\n\nRussell, along with Moore, shared the idea that clarity of expression is a virtue, a notion that has been a touchstone for philosophers ever since, particularly among those who deal with the philosophy of language\n\nRussell is generally recognised as one of the founders of analytic philosophy. At the beginning of the 20th century, alongside G E Moore, an English philosopher, Russell was largely responsible for the British \"revolt against Idealism\", a philosophy greatly influenced by Georg Hegel and his British apostle, F H Bradley\n\nHe was particularly appalled by the idealist doctrine of internal relations, which held that in order to know any particular thing, we must know all of its relations. Russell showed that this would make space, time, science and the concept of number unintelligible\n\nRussell's epistemology went through many phases. However, he mainly remained a philosophical realist, believing that our direct experiences have primacy in the acquisition of knowledge. While some of his views have lost favour, his influence remains strong in the distinction between two ways in which we can be familiar with objects, \"knowledge by acquaintance\" and \"knowledge by description\"\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate Russell's influence on modern philosophy. Born on May 18, 1872, the great philosopher made analysis the dominant approach to philosophy. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950 for his numerous writings.\n\nLet us read some facts about the philosopher and logician:\n\nBertrand Russell was arrested and jailed twice for political activism -- once in 1918, and again in 1961\n\nRussell's son Conrad was named after novelist Joseph Conrad\n\nHis grandfather, John Russell, twice served as Queen Victoria's Prime Minister\n\nRussell's parents died when he was very young, and he was raised by his grandmother, Lady Russell\n\nYoung Bertrand showed an early talent for logic when he argued with his grandmother that \"it was inconsistent to demand at one and the same time that everybody should be well housed, and yet that no new houses should be built because they were an eyesore.\"\n\nIn 1949 he was awarded the Order of Merit and in 1950, the Nobel Prize for Literature -- which marked, as he puts it, \"the apogee of my respectability\", and made him feel \"slightly uneasy\"\n\nRussell was also known for his work in mathematical logic and analytical philosophy.\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
