Bertrand Russell was a notable philosopher, historian, mathematician, and social critic who was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize for Literature.

In 1963 the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation was launched, in order to carry forward Russell's work for peace, human rights and social justice. Branches were established in New Zealand and Australia, and Foundation papers collected by Sir Walter Nash. The Walter Nash collection was later transferred to Archives New Zealand.

Nash was a key member of New Zealand's Labour Party from 1918 until his death in 1968. He served in many important roles ranging from national secretary of the Labour Party (1918-1932) to Minister of Finance (1935-1949) in the first Labour government, and was Prime Minister of New Zealand from 12 December 1957 to 12 December 1960.
