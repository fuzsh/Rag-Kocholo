Abstract

As with American and other well-documented global jazz iterations, the presence of jazz in Brazil may be seen in the context of a story that includes or even initiates from local, regional and national trends in popular and improvised music. This long and complex history seems to require a descriptive label that is more nuanced, and in fact, more based on an equivalency of contribution than the Americo-centric ‘Brazilian jazz’. Through a case study of Paulo Moura’s recordings of 1968–69, this article considers the transmission, appropriation, invention and circulation of musical style and language. Following the work of George E. Lewis and David Ake, the possibility of identifying and defining a particular Brazilian set of approaches to this process is contemplated.
