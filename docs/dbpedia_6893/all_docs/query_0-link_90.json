Entry WOTW-012.\n\nhttp://www.surfline.com/wave-of-the-w... for more entries.\n\nAbout the Event:\n\nThe O'Neill Wave of the Winter competition encapsulates the best rides captured south of the equator.\n\nSame format and packaging. Same rules and regulations. Same props and prize money for both surfers and filmers. Only this time, we're accepting rides logged anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere between now and September. So Pipeline's out. Jaws is out. Off-the-Wall's out. But Kandui, Cloudbreak, Skeleton Bay - anywhere south of zero degrees latitude, really - is fair game.\n\nGrand Prize: $25,000\n\nFilmer Prize: $5,000"
