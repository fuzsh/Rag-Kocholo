He is best known as a founding member of the seminal Brazilian metal band Sepultura, along with founding the highly influential metal band Sarcófago, whom were active from 1985 - 2000. Currently, Lamounier is active with the occult doom band The Evil.\n\nSarcófago, whose early works would be identified with the first wave of black metal, would be considered a highly influential band in sound and in visual aesthetic, as the band wore spiked armbands, bullet belts and corpse paint. While the band's sound would shift into other variations of metal, the band's sound would remain an influence to developing metal off-shoots until they would break up in 2000.\n\nBiography[]\n\nSepultura[]\n\nSepultura was formed in 1984 in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The band was founded by teen brothers Max and Igor Cavalera, the impoverished sons of Vânia, a model, and Graciliano, a well-to-do Italian diplomat whose fatal heart attack left his family in financial ruin. Graciliano's death deeply affected his sons, inspiring them to form a band after Max heard the album Black Sabbath Vol. 4 the very same day. They chose the band name Sepultura, the Portuguese word for \"grave\", when Max translated the lyrics of the Motörhead song \"Dancing on Your Grave\".\n\nThe brothers' early influences included Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, and metal and hard rock artists of the early 1980s, such as Van Halen, Iron Maiden, Motörhead, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, and V8.[1] They would travel to a record shop in São Paulo that mixed tapes of the latest records by American bands. Their listening habits changed dramatically after being introduced to Venom. As Igor Cavalera put it: \"I remember the first time I listened to Venom, it was on a friend's borrowed tape. It was similar to Motörhead, only a lot heavier. I remember someone saying: it's the devil's Motörhead! After we got acquainted with Venom, we stopped listening to Iron Maiden and all that lighter stuff.\"\n\nThe Cavalera brothers started listening to bands such as Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Kreator, Sodom, Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus, and Exciter. They also had influences on Brazilian metal from bands like Stress, Sagrado Inferno, and Dorsal Atlântica. By 1984, they had dropped out of school.[2] After several early membership changes, Sepultura established a stable lineup of Max on guitar, Igor on drums, bassist Paulo Jr and lead vocalist Lamounier. Sepultura performed live for the first time in December 1984, opening for Overdose. In an interview with CVLT Nation, while Igor Cavalera would be excited to perform live, he noted that the band's first concert was actually terrible.[3] Sepultura would only perform a handful of gigs with Lamounier on vocals.\n\nLamounier departed in March 1985 after disagreements with the band, and moved on to become the leader of the pioneering Brazilian black metal band Sarcófago. After his departure, Max took over as the lead vocalist and would remain in the role until 1996. Jairo Guedes was invited to join the band as lead guitarist. The band would release an EP entitled Bestial Devastation in 1985, with Lamounier having wrote the lyrics to \"Antichrist\". No known studio recordings exist with Lamounier on vocals.\n\nIn the years since his departure, Lamounier and Sarcófago would have a long-lasting feud with Sepultura.[4][5] Although former Sepultura drummer Igor Cavalera eventually dismissed the entire affair as \"child's play\", the music press fueled their bitter rivalry for many years. Their conflict partially contributed to Sarcofágo's fame as the perennial \"black sheep\" of Brazilian heavy metal.\n\nTensions started after Lamounier parted ways with Sepultura, which led to a temporarily awkward situation. In Minelli's assessment, \"everybody had forgotten it\" until two years later, when D.D. Crazy smashed a bottle over Andreas Kisser's head, who had been recently recruited as Sepultura's new lead guitarist. Kisser was being \"too much of a douchebag\". Sílvio \"Bibica\" Gomes, Sepultura roadie and co-author of the band's Toda a História biography, was one of the prime instigators of that fight.\n\nThe animosity between the two groups eventually reached another major Brazilian band, crossover thrash act Ratos de Porão. The band got involved in the affair after a 1987 Belo Horizonte gig, when a portion of the audience kept jeering at the band. One version of that story states that Lamounier and Ratos de Porão singer João Gordo were antagonizing each other during the show. Another one tells that when Gordo asked Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera who was \"gobbing\" (spitting) at his band, Max accused Sarcófago.[6]\n\nTensions flared up once again five years later when Sarcófago, instead of Ratos de Porão, were picked up to be the opening band of Dirty Rotten Imbeciles' first Brazilian shows. Ratos de Porão and friends from São Paulo thrash metal group Korzus invaded Sarcófago's backstage area; João Gordo then proceeded to sucker-punch Lamounier while he was lying drunk on the floor, and Gordo's friends attacked the rest with motorcycle chains. A massive brawl ensued, with a member of Dirty Rotten Imbeciles' road crew getting his arm broken.\n\nDuring an interview from The Worst era, Lamounier was asked to comment on Sepultura's well-publicized break-up, when Max Cavalera left the band in January 1997. Lamounier declared he was not surprised that things turned out the way they did as, in his words, \"with what I knew of them, I think it's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences to get what they want. So, a brother backstabbing the other, deceiving their mother, cheating a friend... For money, I'll bet they're capable of anything.\"\n\nAnnoyed by Lamounier meddling in \"private family business\", Max Cavalera's answer came through \"Bumbklaatt\", a song on Soulfly's debut album. Max explained that, in Jamaican patois, \"Bumbklatt\" means \"blood clot\" and it is also \"a big insult... It means motherfucker or a piece of shit in Jamaica\".[7]\n\nSarcófago[]\n\nSarcófago (Portuguese for 'sarcophagus') was formed in 1985 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Equally indebted to Finnish hardcore punk and early extreme metal groups such as Bathory, Celtic Frost, and Slayer, Sarcófago's goal was to create the most aggressive music ever.[8] Sarcófago's vinyl debut was on the Cogumelo Produções split album Warfare Noise I, originally released in 1986. Sarcófago contributed the three tracks \"Recrucify\", \"The Black Vomit\" and \"Satanas\". Their music and lyrics were considered shocking at the time, something which brought them a considerable amount of attention. The band's line-up at that point consisted of \"Butcher\" (guitars), \"Antichrist\" (Lamounier; vocals), \"Incubus\" (Geraldo Minelli; bass) and \"Leprous\" (Armando Sampaio; drums).\n\nWith new drummer in \"D.D. Crazy\", notable in the metal world for his extensive use of blast beats on this album, Sarcófago released I.N.R.I in July 1987. The band's attire on the album's cover in corpsepaint, leather jackets, and bullet belts, is considered the first definite statement of black metal's visual presentation and style. The music has been equally influential, a milestone in the development of the genre. Despite the record's now-legendary status, Lamounier was unsatisfied with the end results, voicing complaints over the quality of the recording sessions and the band being plagued by inner strife. After the release of I.N.R.I., Sarcófago briefly disbanded. Lamounier moved to Uberlândia to study economics at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU), while Butcher and his brother D.D. Crazy left the group. The latter would play drums on Sextrash's debut, 1990's Sexual Carnage.[9]\n\nI.N.R.I. would rank 22 on Decibel's Top 100 Black Metal Albums of All Time,[10] along with being inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2012.[11][12][13]\n\nRotting (1989–1990)\n\nThe band's follow-up release, Rotting, would be released in August 1989. When first came out it stirred a huge amount of controversy due to its cover art — a traditional grim reaper figure licking what appears to be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a crown of thorns over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.[14]\n\nRotting musically differs from the raw, hyper-speed black metal of I.N.R.I. Session drummer \"Joker\" brought a different set of influences to the band (such as crossover thrash); Wagner also quickly learned to play guitar, and contributed many of the album's guitar riffs. Rotting also marked their first change of aliases: the group's core duo renamed themselves \"Wagner Antichrist\" and \"Gerald Incubus\". Their visual department went through changes as well — they dropped the arm and leg spikes because they made playing live difficult.\n\nRotting was Sarcófago's first release to have international distribution, handled in Europe by British label Music for Nations, and by Maze/Kraze in America. Maze Records released a censored version of Rotting, blacking out the original cover and adding a sticker which read \"Featuring the Original Lead Singer of Sepultura\" without consulting the band. Infuriated by the label's actions, Sarcófago sued them.[15]\n\nThe Laws of Scourge would see release in August 1991, considered a \"revolution\" in the band's career, and it is also considered to be one of the first technical death metal records. A combination of better musicianship, improved production values, and more sophisticated songwriting landed them into technical death metal territory.[16] Sarcófago's new direction in music was partly influenced by new members Fábio \"Jhasko\" (guitar) and Lúcio Olliver (drums), and inspired by a newer crop of extreme metal bands such as Godflesh, Paradise Lost, Bolt Thrower, Deicide, and Morbid Angel.\n\nThe Laws of Scourge became Sarcófago's best selling record, and responsible for their most extensive touring schedule to this date. Their tour trek also included their first international dates: they visited South American countries such as Peru and Chile, and in Europe they played shows in Portugal and Spain. In Brazil, their most important gig was to open for crossover thrash pioneers D.R.I. (Dirty Rotten Imbeciles) in São Paulo.[17]\n\nReleased in March 1994, Hate is notable for its stripped-down, straightforward approach and the use of a drum machine, the latter sparking some controversy. Lamounier claimed to have no qualms about using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a drum machine. The song \"Satanic Terrorism\" is about the \"Inner Circle\" church burnings in Norway that occurred during the early 1990s. Sarcófago was briefly accused of supporting these acts, but Lamounier has insisted that this is untrue.[18]\n\nThe band cut their hair short, in protest of the masculine long hair style becoming popular due to the massive success of grunge in the early 1990s. Men sporting long hair has traditionally been associated with counterculture groups, and it is especially present in the metalhead subculture. Wagner declared: \"Every douchebag around is wearing long hair, Nirvana and Pearl Jam T-shirts, etc. We have nothing against these bands, but we have against jumping the bandwagon. It's not right when it becomes a trend, because massification dumbs people down.\"\n\nIn late 1996, Sarcófago released the Decade of Decay compilation which, amongst other things, featured demo versions of their early songs and rare backstage photographs. The band described the CD as a \"gift\" to their fans.\n\nIn December 1997, Sarcófago would release their fourth and final album, The Worst. This release sees the band slowing down in relation to the speed-oriented Hate, and having a better grasp of drum programming and slight elements of groove metal. Minelli and Lamounier saw this record as a \"summation\" of their career though fan reception of the release would not be positive. Finally, in 2000 the band would release the Crust EP. Intended to be a preview of an upcoming album, the core duo would part ways before the EP was release and Sarcófago would ultimately disband that same year.\n\nIn celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Warfare Noise split album, Cogumelo Records and Gerald Incubus organized a comeback show with Sarcófago in Belo Horizonte. Along with Minelli, the line-up for that event was Fábio Jhasko on guitars, Manu Joker and old-time friend Juarez \"Tibanha\" on vocals. The performance was recorded and intended for a DVD release. Lamounier opted not to join this \"Sarcófago Tribute\" band for the lack in desire to play professionally at the time.[19] In October 2007, Tributo en Sarcófago flew to Santiago, Chile to play in the Black Shadows Festival, alongside death metal pioneers Possessed.\n\nIn March 2009, Wagner supposedly announced that Sarcófago would reunite, and their tour itinerary would include appearances at the Wacken Open Air and Hole in the Sky festivals, as well as dates in London, New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo. He stated it would be the original I.N.R.I. line-up, but that this would be the only tour they would be doing and there would be no new material.[20] A couple of days later, Lamounier himself wrote to the music press exposing this news report as a hoax, explaining that the \"leaked\" tour dates would conflict with the academic year of the institution where he gives lectures.[21]\n\nOther Bands and Endeavors[]\n\nBetween tenures with Sarcófago, Lamounier would be briefly involved with the death metal Cirrhosis, founding the band in 1988. Cirrhosis was formed by Wagner, Rodrigo, and Ritchie, while Sarcófago was on a hiatus. The 'original' bassist was Homem Invisível (Invisible Man), who actually only existed in their drunken minds. Wagner soon left to revamp Sarcófago, and Cirrhosis decided to carry on without him (and Homem Invísivel as well, who had vanished by then). Lamounier would also participate in a hobby project known as Komando Kaos, which released one EP in 1989.\n\nWhen Sarcófago split in 2000, Lamounier would be largely out of the music industry entirely. He would embark on an entirely different career as an economist and is currently a professor of economic science and applied statistics at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.[22]\n\nThe Evil would be founded in 2012 by Lamounier though he would be playing solely guitar. This project, with all members assuming aliases and masked outfits, embracing a \"four horsemen of the apocalypse\" motif. Some years after the project formed the band would record a debut album in the Fall of 2016, releasing the eponymous debut known as The Evil on 9 June 2017. The band performed on occasion be it marquee shows or festivals such as Primavera do Rock,[23] Doom Over BH[24] and Maniacs Metal Meeting.[25] In 2020 the band would attain a new singer and announce a second album was in the works.\n\nOn 9 August 2013, Wagner joined Brazilian black metal band Mystifier at Matriz Casa Cultural (Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil) to sing the classic Sarcófago song \"Nightmare\".[26]\n\nInfluence[]\n\nSarcófago left a widespread influence on black metal circles worldwide, particularly among the Scandinavian portion of the \"second wave\" of the genre. \"It is sobering\", claimed Terrorizer magazine, \"to think of what wouldn't have happened had 'I.N.R.I.' not been released\". The band had also been notable in the devlopment of the off-shoot genre known as \"war metal\".[27] Notably, Rotting and The Laws of Scourge would be early examples of technical death metal.\n\nFenriz, drummer of Darkthrone, included a Sarcófago track (\"Satanic Lust\") on his curated compilation The Best of Old-School Black Metal, released by Peaceville Records.[28] Of Sarcófago's I.N.R.I., he said it was an \"album\" that \"you buy or die\". Euronymous, the deceased guitarist of Mayhem and erstwhile leader of the so-called \"Inner Circle\", traded correspondence with Lamounier in the early days of Norway's scene. In the Lords of Chaos book, Metalion (Slayer fanzine, ex-Head Not Found) stated that Euronymous was \"obsessed with them because wore lots of spikes and corpsepaint. He said he wanted every band to be like this […].\" Satyricon covered Sarcófago's \"I.N.R.I.\" on their Intermezzo II EP, also featured on the Tribute to Sarcófago album, released by Cogumelo Records in 2001.[29] Key Gorgoroth members Infernus and King were also influenced by Sarcófago.[30]\n\nNotable black metal groups from neighbouring Finland were also affected by Sarcófago's early output. Beherit founder Nuclear Holocausto said Sarcófago was one of \"the greatest influences\" for the band;[31] Mika Luttinen from Impaled Nazarene said that \"nothing tops Slayer's Reign in Blood or Sarcofago's I.N.R.I., you know\".[32] Their version of \"The Black Vomit\" was included in Tribute to Sarcófago.\n\nLamounier, however, has been critical of several of the bands influenced by Sarcófago, especially bands from the Norwegian black metal scene. He would be especially critical of the \"raw\" sound, wondering how one of the wealthiest countries in the world could have produced such a scene. Although he liked Immortal, Wagner dubbed Euronymous a \"nutcase\" and considered Burzum \"shit\". He also criticized black metal's purposely lo-fi recording aesthetic; Lamounier said that Burzum's guitar timbre \"sounded like it was recorded through a transistor radio\".\n\nBands[]\n\nSepultura - Lead Vocals (1984 - 1985)\n\nSarcófago - Guitar, Vocals (1985 - 1987, 1989 - 2000)\n\nCirrhosis - Guitar, Vocals (1988 - 1989)\n\nKomando Kaos - Guitar, Vocals (1988 - ?)\n\nThe Evil - Guitar (2012 - Present)\n\nDiscography[]\n\nWith Sarcófago (Studio Albums)[]\n\nI.N.R.I.
