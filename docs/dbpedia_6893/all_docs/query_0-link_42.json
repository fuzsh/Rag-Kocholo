Daranee Saeju, Assistant Governor, Payment System Policy and Financial Consumer Protection Group at the Bank of Thailand. A banking veteran on both the policy front and a practitioner on the implementation front. Dr. Saeju has worked extensively on monetary policy implementation, foreign exchange operations, and central bank acts and was even once seconded as an expert to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)! She's played a key role in Thailand's rise as a leader in Southeast Asia's rapidly growing fintech ecosystem. Including the development of the world's first linkage of faster payment systems through PromptPay & PayNow, and QR code payment linkages with 6 countries (the highest number of cross-border real-time payment linkages globally). She joins our powerhouse speaker roster, with 120 speakers already confirmed (we will have 200+ at the show) to take to the stage at Money20/20 Asia (23 - 25 April, 2024, Bangkok) including: 1) Speakers from 20 countries, 13 APAC countries 2) Over 30 of APAC's largest payment companies 3) A diverse range of over 25 banks 4) 12 unicorns and counting 5) 5 confirmed keynotes And you can shave $500 off your #Money2020Asia pass...

This interview shines a light on: ✅What makes Malta an attractive destination for fintech companies. ✅How the regulatory framework supports innovation in this industry. ✅FinanceMalta’s role in promoting and supporting fintechs. ✅Opportunities and challenges for fintechs wanting to operate in Malta. ✅How the Malta fintech sector will evolve in the next 5 to 10 years. Read more here: https://hubs.li/Q02JdfBB0 to find out how Malta is fast becoming a hotbed for innovation. #malta #financialservices #fintech #money2020\n\nAnd that’s a wrap at Money20/20 Asia! Only their second event in the region but the bar has been set v high and it will no doubt establish itself very quickly alongside 🇺🇸/🇪🇺 editions. 🙌🙌 As always, great to connect with old friends, make new ones and in this case meet a long lost family member! My key takeaways: 🚧🚧The many options for digital bank builders were on show! Banks can go independently with core platform providers (eg Thought Machine, Mambu 10X), use BaaS (eg audax, engine) or through strategic drag/drop (eg WeLab Bank in Indonesia). The likely outcome: lower cost/higher speed to market/greater innovation. Exciting times! 💵📲Embedded finance is making great progress in the region (APAC likely to be ~50% of global EMFI revenues next year). Regional Open banking (so far!) remains more of a vision than a reality although some success stories beginning to emerge (eg cross border QR payments). Lots of energy on show at M20/20 in this space, particularly in payments. 🧠The genAI hype train was relatively restrained. Widespread agreement that it will be a huge step forward in many areas. But almost everyone I spoke with acknowledged that running tools in prod is a challenge still to be conquered. Expect lots of live use cases next year.
