        "text": "Optimize collaboration across Zoom Workplace with next-gen Zoom Docs; transform content from Zoom Meetings into actionable documents with AI Companion\n\nZoom Docs’ AI-first customizable design easily adapts to team and project needs, including documents, wikis, and tables, providing a single place to manage work\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., Aug. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM) announced the rollout of Zoom Docs, its AI-first collaborative docs solution, starting today. Zoom Docs is powered by Zoom AI Companion, the company’s generative AI assistant available at no additional cost*, to help drive productivity and seamless collaboration throughout Zoom Workplace.\n\n“Zoom Docs is our first Zoom Workplace product with generative AI built in from the ground up; it effortlessly transforms information from Zoom Meetings into actionable documents and knowledge bases, so teams can stay focused on meaningful work,” said Smita Hashim, chief product officer at Zoom. “Zoom Docs is included at no additional cost with Zoom Workplace paid licenses, creating even more value for our customers. With AI Companion available every step of the way, Zoom Docs is purpose-built to empower people to ‘work happy’ and give them more time back in their day.”\n\nZoom Docs transforms team collaboration\n\nZoom Docs can help solve critical challenges facing modern workforces, including time wasted on repetitive tasks, information overload, and facilitation of cross-functional alignment. By utilizing Zoom AI Companion to convert meeting outcomes into actionable documents, Zoom Docs can jumpstart content creation and adapt to different individual and team needs to help boost workers’ productivity.\n\nZoom Docs’ AI-first capabilities help Zoom Workplace users make teamwork more collaborative and effective, optimize productivity by keeping information organized, and reduce silos by empowering teams to communicate and share information more fluidly. Potential use cases for Zoom Docs include:\n\nMeeting collaboration: Zoom Docs simplifies meeting collaboration with AI Companion by transforming meeting content into meaningful documents, centralizing meeting summaries with meeting docs, and facilitating co-editing on docs within meetings.\n\nBusiness documents: Whether creating content, business proposals, or reports, AI Companion for Zoom Docs makes content generation, revision, summarization, and translation easy for global teams.\n\nProject planning: Planning complex projects can be messy. Zoom Docs can help with time-saving templates for project briefs and tracking for a variety of use cases like product launches, marketing campaigns, and event management, consolidating project-related materials, and improving visibility across progress tracking, status updates, and timelines.\n\nInformation hub: Useful for knowledge-base creation, team onboarding, and goal tracking, users can build robust wikis for a single source of information.\n\nAdditional AI-first capabilities help teams do their best work\n\nWith the power of AI Companion, Zoom Docs simplifies work and brings information together for optimal results.\n\nTurn AI Companion meeting summaries into easily editable docs, freeing up time spent on note-taking and manually copying notes into a shared document with templates for one-on-ones, stand-up meetings, brainstorming, project updates, discussions, Q&As, customer success, user feedback, and more.\n\nGenerate content based on AI Companion meeting transcripts. Use custom or preset commands or queries with AI Companion to further create and revise content.\n\nRevise and summarize content such as articles, plans, and outlines, change tone and style, catch grammatical and spelling errors, and translate content into nine languages (with support for additional languages planned) for multilingual teams with AI Companion.\n\nMaximize meeting effectiveness to drive better outcomes\n\nMeetings are core to Zoom Workplace, and Zoom Docs builds on that experience by enhancing collaboration before, during, and after meetings, empowering users to stay more aligned and achieve better results.\n\nStart and schedule meetings from a Zoom Doc to connect with colleagues and quickly streamline workflows.\n\nCreate, share, and co-edit docs during meetings. Meeting attendees can follow along with the presenter, co-edit, and comment on the doc in real time without leaving the meeting window. Attendees on mobile devices can view in-meeting doc collaboration without signing in.\n\nCreate an editable and shareable doc that includes relevant meeting information from a meeting in a customizable format.\n\nStreamline permission sharing to reduce time spent granting access to docs with bulk permission settings for meeting attendees, and the ability to grant temporary access to meeting attendees to collaborate during the meeting. Users can also share Zoom Docs in Team Chat channels and with individuals in specific chats directly from Zoom Docs.\n\nShare docs across Zoom Workplace via Zoom Team Chat or Zoom Mail or invite colleagues to collaborate live in Zoom Meetings to streamline editing.\n\nGet work done in one place for better results\n\nAdapt docs to different individual and team needs to keep collaboration fluid and information organized.\n\nCustomize docs with content blocks for texts, tables, images, charts, and more to help increase efficiency and reduce information management across multiple apps. Add data tables for team collaboration and planning to track assignments and projects. Add checklists, images, videos, and callouts to make the doc more engaging, and utilize the multi-column layout for greater flexibility in organizing content.\n\nEmbed content from across Zoom Workplace and third parties like Zoom Whiteboard, Google Drive, Figma, X, and YouTube to make information centrally accessible.\n\nStay organized by starring frequently used docs or quickly filtering docs by author for quick access.\n\nOptimize team collaboration\n\nReduce silos and keep collaborators informed, connected, and aligned.\n\nKeep an eye on progress using tables, checklists, and trackers for activities, due dates, status, and assigned owners, with various views like Kanban boards, calendars, and galleries.\n\nOrganize team documents in dedicated wikis to provide central locations for shared information.\n\nGroup, filter, sort, and search data tables to easily visualize information and quickly locate the needed data.\n\nEdit concurrently with up to 100 users in a single Zoom Doc, and tag teammates in edits and comments.\n\nQuickly add, remove, and change permissions for internal teammates and external users to confidently share and collaborate on a doc’s contents.\n\nZoom Docs with AI Companion is included with all paid Zoom Workplace plans*. Basic (free) users can create up to 10 shared docs and unlimited personal docs without AI Companion but can upgrade to Zoom Workplace Pro, Business, or Enterprise plans for access to AI Companion capabilities across Zoom Workplace, including Docs. Account owners and admins may enable or disable AI Companion for Zoom Docs.\n\nZoom Docs is available beginning today for users of the Zoom Workplace app, version 6.1.6 or later, which can be downloaded from the Zoom website, and users can also access Zoom Docs from the Docs web homepage or the Zoom Web App.\n\n*Note: AI Companion is included at no additional cost with the paid services assigned to Zoom accounts.
