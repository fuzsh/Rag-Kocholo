        "text": "Who will finish in the Premier League's top four?\n\nOn the eve of the 2024-25 Premier League season, we asked 30 BBC TV and radio pundits to pick their top four, with explanations for their selections.\n\nManchester City and Arsenal were the only sides to be selected as our pundits' title winners, but seven other clubs were considered as potential top-four candidates.\n\nEx-England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley believes Liverpool and Manchester United will finish third and fourth respectively.\n\nShe said: \"Liverpool will need to tighten up defensively and be more clinical in front of goal. Moreover, we all know that changes can take time to embed and with Jurgen Klopp gone, Arne Slot's stylistic changes toward a more controlled approach could mean a lag in performance.\n\n\"Inconsistent last season and already plagued by injuries, United are rebuilding. They have made some quality signings over the summer so expect to see some improvements, particularly the additions of Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui to solidify their defence, but they will still drop points where they shouldn't.\"\n\nFormer England defender Anita Asante is backing Newcastle to finish in the top four, as they did in 2022-23.\n\n\"Eddie Howe's side showed lots of promise last season but the injury crisis they had throughout the campaign didn't help their European qualification ambitions,\" she said.\n\n\"They are sure to have a big rebound this season with Alexander Isak leading the front line. With a healthy squad and only the Premier League as a primary focus, they are definitely strong contenders to finish in the top four.\"\n\nFormer Everton midfielder Leon Osman agreed, adding: \"Isak is key but they've got no European football and cannot possibly have the bad luck on the injury front they did last season.\"\n\nAnd former England international Sue Smith is predicting that Tottenham will finish in the top four: \"Ange Postecoglou did brilliantly last year when everything looked like it was going to be difficult after they lost their best player and goalscorer, Harry Kane. But Ange came in and was a breath of fresh air, playing football that was great to watch.\n\n\"The injuries massively hindered them but you feel with another year under Ange they'll kick on. Dominic Solanke is a great signing that adds goals to the team. He had a brilliant season last year with 19 goals for Bournemouth and is a player high in confidence.\"\n\nWho did our pundits pick as their Premier League top four? Read more here\n\nOur reporter asked... you answered\n\nNizaar Kinsella, who will be covering Tottenham for BBC Sport this season, asked if Tottenham have a chance to win silverware this season.\n\nHere are some of your answers:\n\nPhil: Trophies tend to be won with solid defences and from what I've seen in pre-season (especially v Bayern Munich) we're conceding soft goals from set-pieces and the high line is still allowing opposing attackers space and time. Get these sorted out and we have a chance.\n\nJake: Postecoglou ideally wants to be pushing Spurs for top honours this season. While it's a great statement to make which will create a belief within the fanbase, the club's activity in the current transfer window seems to be more interested in building a side for the future rather than for the now.\n\nRichard: Tottenham have the fourth-best squad in the league. I still think they need some more depth in some positions to compete for a trophy, but I wouldnât be surprised if they reach a cup final.\n\nBenny: Ange can build on what he did last season. We can go on a run in the Europa League, maybe even win a domestic cup and finish in the Champions League places. That would be the best scenario.\n\nMonish: They have quality depth, especially in the attack. The academy has churned out a lot of exciting talents. If they manage to sign a good left-footed defender and a decent, physical number six, they have a great chance of winning silverware, especially the Europa League (given its new format).\n\nRichard: One trophy is irrelevant! We need to show progress in the development of a team that can become a serial winner of trophies. We need a top-four Premier League finish and at least the semi-finals of the Europa League. I would take that any day over winning the FA cup and finishing sixth or seventh in the Premier League.\n\n'A crossroads in Bissoumaâs career'\n\nNizaar Kinsella\n\nBBC Sport football news reporter\n\nFootball clubs often fail to dish out real punishments to their players over poor behaviour, but Ange Postecoglou and Tottenham have got tough with Yves Bissouma.\n\nThe midfielder has been given an internal one-match suspension for filming himself on social media taking laughing gas, which is illegal in the United Kingdom.\n\nBissouma is still training with the squad but has been told in no uncertain terms that he fell short of the clubâs professional standards and will be unavailable for the upcoming game away at Leicester on Monday night.\n\nInterestingly, this is the fourth suspension Bissouma has received under Postecoglou after two red cards and a ban for accumulating five yellow cards last season.\n\nIn his press conference, Postecoglou said: \"That's the club's sanction, irrespective of that sanction it's still allowing Biss to understand the poor decision he made and the ramifications of that. I will deal with that as we move along. In terms of the club sanction it is one game suspended.â\n\nThese comments also set a wider tone at the beginning of the season that standards, both on and off the pitch, must be met.\n\nPostecoglou said there is now pressure on Bissouma to behave perfectly and âregain trustâ from now on. He also has a big fight for his place after splitting minutes with Pape Sarr, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall in midfield during pre-season, with Rodrigo Bentancur having not been available until the last match after Copa America.\n\nThis is a crossroads in Bissoumaâs career and it will be on him to respond positively or he risks fading away.\n\nPhil McNulty's predictions - Tottenham\n\nIt's that time of the year again - the annual act of foolishness in which I try to predict the outcome of the 2024-25 season for all 20 Premier League clubs.\n\nTottenham Hotspur - sixth\n\nA really interesting season ahead for Spurs. Yes, last season was an improvement under Ange Postecoglou, especially after the departure of Harry Kane, but missing out on the top four after getting into such a strong position must be considered a missed opportunity.\n\nPostecoglou's brand of attacking football was a sharp contrast to the stodge of Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte, but it was too easily rumbled by opponents in the second half of the season.\n\nThe Australian showed no signs of bending, but surely there must be more pragmatism?\n\nInteresting transfer business, as well.\n\nDominic Solanke, who signed from Bournemouth in a deal that could be worth Â£65m, showed signs last season of maturing into the striker Chelsea and Liverpool thought he might be. Meanwhile, teenager Archie Gray looked an outstanding prospect at Leeds United.\n\nSon Heung-min will once again be the inspiration and there is enough quality elsewhere to suggest top six is very realistic.\n\nAnd watch out for 17-year-old Mikey Moore, a player those behind the scenes at Spurs discuss with barely disguised excitement.\n\nRead all of Phil's predictions here\n\nBreakout star? It's season predictions\n\nAli Speechly\n\nFan writer\n\nWhere will you finish in the league and why?\n\nMy heart says top four, but my head says fifth. I think we will perform better for longer overall this season, but I also think we have got an additional competition to contend with in the Europa League and so we might struggle with burnout due to a lack of strength in depth.\n\nWho is the best signing or has he not signed yet and who should it be?\n\nI am very excited by the prospect of our new signings - particularly Lucas Bergvall who, so far, has looked composed on the ball and purposeful in driving play up the pitch. I am interested to see how Ange Postecoglou develops and utilises our young homegrown talent too, especially Mikey Moore and Jamie Donley.\n\nWhat do you want from your manager this season?\n\nI can't wait to see what Postecoglou can do in his second season. I want to see him be more agile and adaptable with his tactics and substitutions. It is important for a coach to communicate a clear playing style to his team and I love the courage of our fast, attacking football when everything clicks. But there is also a bravery to be found in changing our approach if it is not working, by adapting to the game that is actually in front of us, rather than the game we wish it was.\n\nWho will be the breakout star in your squad?\n\nMikey Moore. With technical ability and a footballing brain beyond his years, there is a lot to get excited about with this young player. But he is young, so we will have to see when and how he is used. A potential game-changer, for sure.\n\nWhat is your one major concern?\n\nI am still not completely convinced we have enough strength in depth to cover significant injuries or suspensions. Having said that, I would like us to have fun in the Europa League and try to win it. To dare is to do, and all that. COYS!\n\nAli Speechly co-founded Women Of The Lane, external and can be found on X here, external\n\n'Great excitement' about Moore as teenager signs first pro deal\n\nNizaar Kinsella\n\nBBC Sport football news reporter\n\nThere is great excitement at Tottenham about teenager Mikey Moore, who signed his first professional deal on Monday.\n\nThe 17-year-old has not been a secret within academy circles for the past few years but has begun making a name for himself with cameo and pre-season appearances.\n\nMoore played a part in all six of Tottenham's pre-season matches and scored two goals, including making substitute appearances against Bayern Munich. He also set up a couple of goals either directly or indirectly during the tour of Asia.\n\nHe had already played twice for Spurs last season and became the youngest to play for the club last term.\n\nInternally, there is a lot of excitement about Moore's talents, which is highlighted by the unprecedented celebration on social media about his renewal.\n\nFour posts, including an emotional sit-down interview, highlight how pleased Spurs are with the renewal, while under pressure from rivals looking to hijack the deal.\n\nBut manager Ange Postecoglou has also not hidden his feelings at Moore's emergence, telling reporters last week: \"It's fair to say it's incredible that he's turning 17.\n\n\"We brought him into the first-team environment at the back end of last year. Every time he's played for the under-18s or under-21s, he's had an impact.\n\n\"For a very young guy, he adjusted really quickly [to the first team]. He's come back pre-season and done really well in the games and in training. It's great for this football club that he's come through our academy and is already showing great promise.\n\n\"But he's a young man. Our role is to have the best possible environment for him to be the best footballer he can be.\""
