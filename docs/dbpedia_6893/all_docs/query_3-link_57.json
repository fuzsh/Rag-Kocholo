        "text": "HELLOWEEN signs contract with Reigning Phoenix Music - new studio album announced\n\nHamburg (Germany), Los Angeles (California), February 2024 - Reigning Phoenix Music (RPM) announces the signing of legendary power metal institution HELLOWEEN for their upcoming studio album! Since their formation in 1984 and the spectacular reunion in 2017, HELLOWEEN is undoubtedly one of the world's outstanding representatives of the genre.\n\nRPM proudly comments on the signing: \"It is a true milestone for Reigning Phoenix Music to welcome HELLOWEEN to our family of artists. HELLOWEEN is not just a band, they epitomize the energy and passion of power metal. Their music has inspired generations, and we are proud to collaborate in order to reach new heights.\"\n\nHELLOWEEN themselves are equally enthusiastic about the new partnership: \"Sven Bogner and his team have convinced us with their ideas and enthusiasm. They live and love metal, and this is what connects us - we look forward to be working with them!\" explains Andi Deris from HELLOWEEN.\n\nThe combination of HELLOWEEN and Reigning Phoenix Music promises a powerful synergy between one of the world's most influential power metal bands and a label that is passionate about promoting up-and-coming talents as well as established artists. Fans can look forward to thrilling musical experiences and innovative projects.\n\nSpecifically, HELLOWEEN will start working on new material from the summer and are planning to release a new studio album in 2025.\n\nTHANK YOU TO ALL HELLOWEEN MANIACS WORLDWIDE!!!\n\nPics & photo collage: Franz Schepers\n\nThe world tour everyone longed-for since over two years took us to 26 countries on 3 continents. After several pandemic related postponements the UNITED FORCES TOUR finally ignited in England May 2022 and brought together more than 800.000 fans, catapulting you into an euphoric orbit for a year and a half!\n\n​\n\nSold out headline shows in Los Angeles, New York and Sao Paulo, legendary highlights like the show at the Prague O2-Arena, the Schleyerhalle in Stuttgart, or in front of 14.000 metalheads in Santiago de Chile and our first ever sold out concert at the iconic Budokan in Tokyo – the Holy Grail and the ultimate accolade for every rock band!\n\nWithout a doubt there were tears in our eyes at the bombastic Hell & Heaven Festival in Mexico City, which closed the tour.\n\nWaving the UNITED FORCES flag, we opened a new live chapter after more than 35 years of band history: all seven of us rocked the stages, side by side with colleagues like Kiss, Scorpions or Deep Purple and, for the second time we headlined the Wacken Open Air!\n\nWe want to send our thanks to all of you, our loyal fans in Europe, the United States, Canada, Central & South America and Asia. We are incredibly grateful that you kept your tickets even with all the ongoing postponements and, that you stayed true fans, waiting patiently to finally see us live.\n\nAs well, we would like to thank our friends in HAMMERFALL for accompanying us the majority of the dates and spicing up the tour with their pure Swedish metal, ensuring a sweaty, energetic and bombastic package.\n\nAndi: „What a ride! This world tour was something special for all of us – to get together with all our fans after the long waiting – a feeling we all missed so much! We enjoyed all the shows: our fans were superb and gave us only strikingly happy moments that led to an even stronger cohesion of the band! Personally, I can’t even imagine doing this without Michi and Kai anymore! And now we are looking very much forward to our next studio album with the crazy Pumpgang we´ve got!\n\nMarkus: \"Hi Helloween folks all over the globe: you were the ones who welcomed us with open arms and hearts all over the world and you turned our world tour into an unique, euphoric party! We love you all and we are very much looking forward to continue this party with you, our Helloween family in 2024 – right after we are done with the new record.\n\nSascha: \"Wow, what an incredible tour once again! I've met so many wonderful people, and the atmosphere during our concerts has been filled with love and energy. Each tour gives me a steady growing and fulfilling experience! Much love to all the fans out there, our hard working crew, dedicated management, and my talented bandmates!\"\n\nAfter 60 extremely emotional shows, we are now going directly into the songwriting process and follow up production for the successor of HELLOWEEN - it will be the second release of a new era, the new time calculation for us!\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"BEST TIME\": NEW SINGLE AND VIDEO OUT NOW!\n\nHELLOWEEN would like to celebrate again with their fans – with \"BEST TIME\", THE party song of their 2021 album \"HELLOWEEN\".\n\nThe sunny and straight hymn by Sascha Gerstner and Andi Deris revives the good times and shows with their drifty guitars and top form front men a song full of the joys. About the songwriting of \"BEST TIME\" Sascha Gerstner states: \"I had an '80’s Neo Noir-Vibe' in my head. The riff was originally a synth-riff, which we arranged later for guitars. The wording 'I will have the best time of my life' was pretty spontaneous because I had this strong feeling to leave the past behind and Seize the day! Andi instantly loved the idea as well as the refrain and together we created the track as it is now!\"\n\n\"BEST TIME\" comes with a terrific 80’s retro-artwork by cartoonist and HELLOWEEN fan Marcos Moura in a 2,000 pieces limited edition of a 12-inch vinyl, available in three colors as well as a bundle: vinyl single and t-shirt.\n\nBUY YOUR EXCLUSIVE „BEST TIME“ VINYL EDITION AND SHIRT NOW!\n\nBUY HERE\n\n​\n\nDear fans,\n\ndue to the sad and tragic event of this war, we are sorry to have to cancel our shows in Russia for 2023. We have amazing fans in Russia and Ukraine - music unites us all.\n\nOur thoughts are with all the innocent and good people, that have to take the unbelievable suffering from this insanity. We hope and pray for the wellbeing of all and a UNITED good time, with Ukrainian and Russian fans alike sometime soon, in a world that has finally come to peace and reason.\n\nLove to all!\n\n\"OUT FOR THE GLORY“\n\nMUSIC VIDEO RELEASED!\n\nNo reason to sit back: with the clip for “OUT FOR THE GLORY“ the next exciting coup is coming as the successful year is ending. \"I had an idea for a video where all band members are depicted as dinky, odd noble courtiers and ministers\" Michael Weikath explains. „All of us should be floating in the clouds, Deris as a nutty emperor…and after a while more and more details came up and at one point in time we wrote everything down and sent the video concept to the Australian animation team“. Aaron McLoughlin, Senior Lecturer at the University of Melbourne, who has already been involved in several projects with Atomic Fire Records CEO Florian Milz (e.g. for Children Of Bodom, Alestorm, Tankard) mentioned: „When I heard that HELLOWEEN is interested in a collaboration I was totally gobsmacked. The boys are my absolute heroes since I was a teenager and I was sure that my students would love to work on a song by this band.“\n\nAnd typically HELLOWEEN - the creativity was so outrageous that it was impossible to feature everything in one music video. „Seven and a half minutes might not sound like a lot but in animation terms it is a marathon. We had so much great stuff that the production of “OUT FOR THE GLORY“ was a real challenge. Weiki wanted the video to look as cute as possible and we immediately knew: A legendary band from the other side of the planet wants us to create a medieval epic full of cuteness? You bet!\" McLoughlin recollects.\n\nWith a bit over 10.000 frames the iconic animation short movie is not only extremely elaborate, but also wicked and spacy, will cause a commotion and hopefully also a lot of fun and enjoyment. As Michael Weikath wishes with a twinkle in his eye: „I now expect that everyone will enjoy this and think it is funny and also that they see the signification!\"\n\nThe animated music video “OUT FOR THE GLORY“ is celebrating its world premiere on December, 17th 2021 and was implemented by the students of Bachelor of Design (Animation & Interactive Media), RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia .\n\nNEW ALBUM \"HELLOWEEN\"\n\nENTERS CHARTS WORLDWIDE!\n\n🎃🚀 Our new album \"Helloween\" has now reached top positions worldwide, more than ten Top 10 entries with an incredible number #1 in Germany and Spain, as well as more #1 positions at the physical charts in Sweden, Finland and the rock charts in the United Kingdom!\n\nTHANK YOU, PUMPKINHEADS AROUND THE WORLD!\n\nTHE WAIT IS OVER!\n\nOur new album “HELLOWEEN“ is out now!\n\n“FEAR OF THE FALLEN“\n\nDIGITAL SINGLE & LYRIC VIDEO RELEASE\n\nHELLOWEEN are back! Their second single \"Fear Of The Fallen\" is a fast paced, melodic track done the way only lead singer Andi Deris can do it. Taken from the upcoming and self-titled new album \"Helloween\", released June 18th, 2021 and produced by Charlie Bauerfeind, the song features Deris along with his band mates Michael Kiske, Michael Weikath, Kai Hansen, Markus Grosskopf, Sascha Gerstner and Dani Löble in their prime.\n\nSKYFALL OUT NOW + VIDEO PREMIERE\n\nTHE SINGLE HAS LANDED! \"Skyfall\", the first track from Helloween’s upcoming and self-titled album is now available for streaming and in various CD and vinyl formats! Go check it out! We’re so excited to hear your reactions!\n\nWritten by Kai Hansen, \"Skyfall\" is a storming more-than-7-minute ride into the Helloween universe (and beyond!) The epic track describes an alien landing on earth and a dramatic chase while Michael Kiske, Andi Deris and Kai Hansen duel each other in a breathtaking manner and create a vocal broadband adventure. Produced by Martin Häusler, it is the most elaborate video clip in the history of the band."
