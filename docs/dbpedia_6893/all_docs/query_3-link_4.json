        "text": "Two virtuosos meet with sublime results on Dois Irmãos (“two brothers”). Veteran clarinetist Paulo Moura, once the principal clarinetist of the Brazilian Symphony, is best known as a composer, arranger, conductor, jazz saxophonist, and recording artist of international stature. The late Raphael Rabello, who began his recording career while in his mid-teens, was unanimously considered the best Brazilian guitarist of the last decade. The unusual instrumental blend on Dois Irmãos proves perfect for the duo’s renditions of choros, a classic, plaintively melodic Brazilian song form."
