        "text": "1- Tell us about your path after school, college and professional life – What prompted you to seek a project like “Queremos”?\n\nAfter school I went to university at PUC Rio, for Business Administration. Throughout the entire course I did internships in different areas such as Record Label, Trade, E commerce and Real Estate. Later on I did a Post-Graduation at FGV in Entertainment Executive Production.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007 I was executive producer at Biscoito Fino record label. There, I was able to work with the most important artists in Brazil and also began doing some tours with them. Maria Bethania, Chico Buarque, Mart’nália, João Donato, Paulo Moura, Casuarina, Simone are some examples.\n\nIn 2007 I decided to start my own company and became a freelancer working on musical direction, curation of events, content for TV shows (like Experimente), soundtracks and also creating new events such as Invasão Paraense, Invasão Baiana, Sai da Rede, etc.\n\nIn 2010 Queremos! was born and the project goes on until today. It started very informally as an idea between friends but quickly turned into a business.\n\n2- What are the challenges and expectations with this project?\n\nIt is very difficult to have a company in Brazil, it is extremely difficult to work with culture and entertainment in Brazil and besides that we have the currency variation. So I can say it is very very tough.\n\nBut we are very happy to have helped change the cultural aspect of the city and then expand it do other cities, building a platform and building a festival.\n\n3- Where and how can you say that your school life at TBS may have helped in your profession? What would say are the differential of your academic formation?\n\nI clearly see the formation of the school helping out in several aspects of the job. Communication, general knowledge, logical thinking, diplomacy, leadership…\n\nMost of my contacts are in English also.\n\n4- Is there a moment in your life at TBS that has been significant and that you can say that it qualified you to be who you are today?\n\nIt is hard to choose a single moment of my academic life. For me, it is more like the time I spent in school that helped me to become who I am and gave me the tools to carry on.\n\n5- Tell us about what you aim as human being, your goals and projects for the next 5 to 10 years?\n\nFor the next years I really hope we can make the world a better place and we can pass through this terrible wave we are seeing of conservative attitudes. Help to fight prejudice, racism, transform the city we live in and do that by culture would be a great way."
