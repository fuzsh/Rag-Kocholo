        "text": "The guy is Brazilian and his name is Gabriel Moura. He doesn't deny his blood. In his veins 'flows' an 'alchemy' of very Brazilian sounds Extroverted intelligence, a lot of sensitivity and rhythm. A very talented songwriter with a striking and singular voice.\n\nGabriel has had some of his songs recorded by Zeca Pagodinho, Ivete Sangalo, Seu Jorge, Ana Carolina, Paula Lima and Forrocacana. He was recently awarded the 2006 Orilaxe prize for Best Singer in 2005 by the Afroreggae Cultural Group. In the 1990s, Gabriel created a musical vocabulary all his own, which became known around the world through the samba-funk-jazz beat of Farofa Carioca, the band he started with his friend and musical partner Seu Jorge. Nephew of maestro Paulo Moura, with whom he played for 15 years, the duo produced and created, together, the musical arrangements for the CD \"Brasis\".\""
