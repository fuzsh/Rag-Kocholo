        "text": "Ever since Love Is Blind premiered on Netflix, viewers have loved watching people try to find The One sight unseen all over the world.\n\nLove Is Blind debuted in February 2020. The series focused on 30 men and women who were in windowless rooms, called pods, that allowed them to talk to potential partners and form connections without knowing what the other person looked like.\n\nWhile being guided by Nick and Vanessa Lachey through the speed dating, contestants pair off and prepare to get engaged less than two weeks later. While most connections don’t end in a success story, fans have been entertained by the ups and downs that came with the reality TV series.\n\nThe overwhelming interest turned into Netflix expanding the franchise with a handful of international versions. Keep scrolling for full a guide to the Love Is Blind franchise:\n\n‘Love Is Blind’\n\nWith six seasons under the show’s belt, there’s nothing quite like an OG. Season 1 introduced Us to Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed-Hamilton, who are still going strong after exchanging “I love you” after their third date and are now married.\n\nThe not-so-happy-ever-afters included Abhishek “Shake” Chatterjee on season 2 fumbling his chance at Deepti Vempati and Andrew Liu being accused of seemingly using eye drops to fake cry during season 3.\n\n‘Love Is Blind: Brazil’\n\nThe Brazil version, which is hosted by Camila Queiroz and Klebber Toledo, has released four seasons so far. Some of the shocking highlights include Paulo Simi Lopes ditching his then-fiancée, Amanda Souza, because he couldn’t handle “having such a strong woman” by his side.\n\nSo far, Nanda Terra and Mack Alves from season 1 are still together. The third season resulted in couples Ágata Moura and Renan Justino and Maria Carolina Caporusso and Menandro Rosa finding The One.\n\n‘Love Is Blind: Japan’\n\nNot every version can blow up and Love Is Blind: Japan is the perfect example of that. After premiering in 2022, the show was renewed for a second season but was ultimately canceled before any more episodes could be filmed.\n\nDespite its short-lived time on Netflix, this version ended up with two success stories since Ryotaro Yamauchi and Motomi are still married with a child — as are Wataru Mizote and Midori.\n\n‘Love Is Blind: Sweden’\n\nHosted by Jessica Almenäs, Love Is Blind: Sweden shows what happens when the reality show has fun with the concept with moments like Karolina Aless trying to tempt Lucas Gustavsson with sexy lingerie. Even though that pair didn’t last, Amanda Jonegard and Sergio Rincon are still together and welcomed a child. Krisse-ly Kuldkepp and Rasmus Hedenstedt also found long-lasting love on the show.\n\n‘Love Is Blind: Mexico’\n\nThe dating experience continues in Mexico with the first season set to release in August 2024. Omar Chaparro and Lucy Chaparro are hosting as excited viewers prepare for poetic declarations, hard conversations about drinking and parenthood — and one engaged person who wonders “What if…?” after meeting another connection from the pods.\n\n‘Love Is Blind: U.K.’\n\nHosted by Matt and Emma Willis, who have been married since 2008, Love Is Blind: U.K. features people from places such as Dublin, London and Edinburgh that are looking for love. The series premiere is set for August 2024 on Netflix.\n\n‘Love Is Blind: Germany’\n\nFollowing the success of Too Hot To Handle: Germany, Netflix announced it was in production on an adaptation of Love Is Blind with German singles.\n\n‘Love Is Blind: Argentina’\n\nIn January 2024, Netflix announced in a teaser clip that Argentina is one of the next locations for a Love Is Blind experience but no more details have been shared so far.\n\n‘Love Is Blind: Habibi’\n\nHosted by Saudi Arabian actors Khaled Saquer and Elham Ali, season 1 of Love Is Blind: Habibi is coming to Netflix very soon."
