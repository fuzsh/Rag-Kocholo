        "text": "As with American and other well-documented global jazz iterations, the presence of jazz in Brazil may be seen in the context of a story that includes or even initiates from local, regional and national trends in popular and improvised music. This long and complex history seems to require a descriptive label that is more nuanced, and in fact, more based on an equivalency of contribution than the Americo-centric 'Brazilian jazz'. Through a case study of Paulo Moura's recordings of 1968-69, this article considers the transmission, appropriation, invention and circulation of musical style and language. Following the work of George E. Lewis and David Ake, the possibility of identifying and defining a particular Brazilian set of approaches to this process is contemplated.\n\nResearch on Brazilian music, whether by Brazilian or foreign scholars, has been dominated by the combined mystiques of tri-racial ethnicity and progressive nationalization. While at “the center” ethnography has been primarily drawn upon as a means of illustrating particular theoretical perspectives, in Brazil it is the theoretical models that are fitted to the ethnography. The predictability of the places at which Brazilian musicologists have looked in their quest for musical otherness, however, is rendered evident by the presence of a Japanese scholar's contribution.\n\nSince the first Portuguese conquests in 1500 (Monteiro, 1), the music of Brazil’s tribal peoples has been adapted to foreign tastes in a number of ways. Accustomed to a learned written tradition developed in the Church, colonizers were disgusted with music of the Natives. Accounts of the culture shock include harshly pejorative, animalizing descriptions of native South American tribes and their lifestyle. In more recent times, musicians from outside these tribal cultures have assimilated slightly more honest, egalitarian research of Brazil’s pre-colonial musical traditions. Innovative treatments of native melodies are not uncommon, but no adaptation does a complete enough job of portraying the material clearly. In fact, I propose that the only effective way to teach the world about pre-colonial music from Brazil would be that an individual (or group) offer knowledge from within his or her own indigenous community. Having researched the multicultural development of Brazilian music, as well as the modern state of tribal life, I suggest the following solution: an effort must be made by indigenous peoples to reach out through a universally comprehensible interface with the intention of conveying the music as it is made in an authentic context. In this essay, I expand on instances of contact between tribal and modern civilizations. My hope is that the reader will arrive at an understanding of not only indigenous music as it is employed by non-indigenous musicians, but also the complex social dynamic at work.\n\nThesis submitted to The National University of Ireland in accordance with the regulations for the Degree of Master in Sociology. The aim of this research is to look at the social and cultural aspects that have been influential in the creation of two important music movements in the twentieth-century: jazz and samba and their major role in modern culture. The starting point concentrates on the major influence of port cities over the music movements that are historically approached, seeing these type of cities as the most important nuclei of popular western music, observing them as fertile ground for a thoughtful sociological analysis that attempts to elucidate new forms of cultural relations such as multiculturalism and hybridism, which is believed to have been profoundly motivated by the Diaspora movement. Arguably, port cities have been considered the first cosmopolitan urban places in modern society. For the purpose of this thesis, the following three main cities in the history of music have been selected to be analysed: New Orleans (USA), New York (USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and their respective music movements, paying a great attention to their major cultural and historical events, looking at their establishment, population make-up, defining characteristics and similarities, which make them particularly unique. This thesis can also be seem as a philosophical attempt to understand the sea as a vast possibility for an intense influx of information, which is reflected in popular modern music as an artistic outcome of its potentiality."
