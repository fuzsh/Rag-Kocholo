        "text": "GuitarCoop – Duo Siqueira Lima\n\nFormed by Uruguayan Cecilia Siqueira and by Brazilian Fernando de Lima, the Duo Siqueira Lima is one of the most prestigious guitar duos nowadays. With a work linking the classical to Brazilian instrumental they are recognized by their technical virtuosity, interpretation, perfect ensemble and their daring and original arrangements for two guitars.\n\nOn their recent U.S. tour, the duo was celebrated by the public and critics for their success in winning the “Brazilian International Press Awards USA 2014”. On this tour they were at the New York Guitar Festival – New York City, “Allegro Guitar Series” – Dallas, Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and at the famous theatre New World Center in Miami. The New York Times described their performance as “finely detailed as a Fabergé egg”. Throughout Europe the duo has performed at prominent theatres and festivals as: Festival Internacional de Guitare de Paris (France), Kongresowa Palace (Warsaw, Poland), International Musical Festival (Kaluga, Russia), International Jazz Festival (Saint Petersburg, Russia), Brest International Musical Festival (Belarus), Festival de Guitare de Lausanne (Switzerland), Festival Guitares du Monde (Perpignan, France), National Concert Hall and Festival of World Cultures (Dublin, Ireland), Palazzina Liberty (Milano, Italy), Tchaikovsky Hall (Gomel, Belarus), Sarajevo International Guitar Festival (Sarajevo, Bosnia) and Ësterhaze Castle (Fertod, Hungary).\n\nThe first meeting between Fernando and Cecilia was marked by a historic event in their careers, which occurred in the international guitar competition which was held in the year 2001 in Caxias do Sul (Brazil). Among all participants, who came from various countries, they shared the first place. This fact was of utter importance for the formation of the Siqueira Lima Duo and for their early international career. Their latest recording album “Um a Um” (2010), was released in Europe and the United States by the acclaimed Belgian “GHA Records” label. Their second CD “Lado a Lado – Side by Side” (2006), revealed the intimacy of the Duo with Brazilian music and opened the doors to a broader musical universe, in addition to the classic music. Currently, they are requested in both chamber music series on popular music or Jazz festivals.\n\nThe Siqueira Lima Duo is very often invited to perform with symphonic orchestras, such as the São Paulo Metropolitan Orchestra and the Chamber Orchestra of the University of São Paulo. They also teach Workshops and Master Classes on various music festivals and institutions around the world, as at the Conservatoire Royal de Liège (Belgium), XIV Wiosenne Koncerty Gitarowe (Szczecin, Poland), University of Florida (Gainesville, Florida, USA), SMU Meadows School of Arts (Fort Worth, Texas, USA), Festival de Música do Pará (Belém, Brazil) Conservatório Dramático e Musical de Tatuí (São Paulo, Brazil), Conservatorio y Escuela de Música de Irún (Spain) among others. Duo Siqueira Lima, together with the great Brazilian clarinettist and conductor Paulo Moura, undertook an important project covering the works of Radamés Gnattali and Astor Piazzolla which culminated in a concert in Sao Paulo sponsored by SESC received by the public and critics both with great acclaim\n\nHernandez y Aguado – 1973\n\n17.990 € 13.990 €\n\nIncludes 19% VAT\n\nplus shipping\n\nAdditional costs (e.g. for customs or taxes) may occur when shipping to non-EU countries.
