I disagree with the other comments posted here. I saw Love Nest on Wheels many years ago and thought it was hilarious. I come from a poor working class family and don't usually like to see the likes of us being patronised. May be I need updating on its political correctness. Does anyone know where I can buy a DVD or VHS? I've been searching for ages. I think Buster Keaton has been much neglected and most people think of him as a silent movie star so when I saw this talkie I remembered it with great affection. The man was a genius. I'm just trying to get to 10 lines here as I need to see the film again before I can make further comments!
