        "text": "If there’s one thing we know at Nerdist, it’s that people love Hot Wheels. People love to play with Hot Wheels. They love to set up elaborate tracks for the tiny cars. And they even love when Hot Wheels collaborates with their favorite franchises. But now, we’ve reached the next frontier for Hot Wheels. A Hot Wheels movie is in the works from J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot. And not only are Hot Wheels cars getting their own movie, but this movie will be live-action.\n\nDeadline shared the news that Mattel Films and Warner Bros. Pictures are creating this Hot Wheels film. And according to the publication, the feature will be “a high-throttle actioner, which will showcase some of the world’s hottest and sleekest cars, monster trucks, and motorcycles.” Sounds interesting. Although we feel confident we already have a franchise that showcases cars. Something about going fast and acting furious. But who knows what the Hot Wheels movie will look like in comparison to Fast & Furious.\n\nMattel Films Executive Producer Robbie Brenner shares more about the film. Brenner notes, “As the global leader in car culture, Hot Wheels has been igniting the challenger spirit in auto enthusiasts for generations… Fans of all ages are now in for the ride of their lives with the incredible talent of J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot joining us alongside Warner Bros. Pictures to transform Hot Wheels’ legendary IP into a thrilling story for the big screen.” Most recently, Deadline announced that Dalton Leeb and Nicholas Jacobson-Larson had come aboard the Hot Wheels movie as writers."
