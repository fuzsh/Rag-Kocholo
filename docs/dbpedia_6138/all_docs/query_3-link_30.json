        "text": "Before introducing her characters, Kapadia carries forward her documentarian sensibilities in her introduction of a monsoon-soaked Mumbai, with shots of crowded streets and energetic movement scored by brief anecdotes in voiceover. Disembodied voices, of poor workers from all over the country, set the scene for All We Imagine As Light by recounting either their Mumbai upbringings—in the local language, Marathi—or their migration from various villages—spoken in other dialects—as they wrestle with whether or not India's financial mecca can truly be their home.\n\nSuddenly, Kapadia's protagonist appears—in slow motion, on a local train—as though she had been part of the story all along. Prabha (Kani Kusruti), a nurse from the southern state of Kerala, dons a blue sari as her professional uniform, and a look of resigned contentment as her personal one. However, her frayed hair and weary eyes tell a different story. Something is a amiss—we later learn that her husband has been living abroad for several years—a scenario exacerbated by the elusive behavior of her young roommate, fellow Keralite nurse Anu (Divya Prabha), who she learns has been sneaking around with a Muslim boy (both Prabha and Anu are Hindu).\n\nPrabha's instinct to protect Anu from gossip (and from the implied consequences of her interfaith romance) collide with her own subdued despondency over having been abandoned; she cannot bring herself to be happy for, or even accept, Anu. Her husband hasn't called her in a year, and the sudden arrival of a present from him, in the form of a brand-new rice cooker, introduces questions of her worth as a woman in society. In contrast, a migrant doctor who admires her—and speaks to her in her mother-tongue, Malayalam, since he struggles to learn the more widely-spoken Hindi—writes her poems and cooks her sweets, romantic gestures right out of a storybook. However, her position as a married woman complicates her own affections.\n\nAnu, meanwhile, is stuck between worlds as well. She's a soft but feisty character, whose subtle mischievous streak—accompanied by fluttering, jazzy piano notes—is considered unbecoming by her peers. Her lively spark is also endangered by the logistical complications of her blossoming romance with Shiaz (Hridhu Haroon), between her looming arranged marriage, the question of what to tell their respective families, or how to even find a place for physical touch, in a city where unmarried young adults live with roommates or families, and public spaces (and even hotels) are hostile toward intimacy. The moments they do manage to spend together, involving razor-sharp banter and the innocent giggles of sexual experimentation, feel like stolen delights.\n\nOnce Mumbai is well-established as the claustrophobic, multi-faceted backdrop for this story, All We Imagine As Light takes a surprising tonal detour half way through its two-hour runtime. Prabha and Anu help middle-aged hospital cook Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam) move back to her coastal village, after she's forced out of her city apartment by a ruthless real estate company—a common facet of the city's widening class chasm. During the rest of the movie, the three women spend fun and deeply reflective moments by sprawling rural beaches, or in forest thickets and nearby ancient caves, as the dynamics between them bubble to the surface, revealing an uneasy portrait of friendship and found family. All the while, their stories influence each other in ways the movie refuses to put into words, allowing them to echo until Kapadia reveals a masterful sleight of hand. Just when it seems her stories might have grown too disparate, she weaves together, in the movie’s final act, each aspect of her movie's thematic and political purview with tender precision, resulting in a quiet crescendo buoyed by reconciliation.\n\nWhile the film seems simple at the outset, Kapadia's presentation is practically reformist—for a country whose mainstream depictions of women can still be lacking—in the way it boldly threads the needle between the psychology and physicality of each character, as well as the spaces around them. She captures Prabha and Anu in both public and private moments, and makes the subtle differences between these modes a key part of her drama. This contrast illuminates both who they are and who they purport to be, a distinction defined not by dishonesty, but insecurity. The two women may be Kapadia's protagonists, but they're far from the \"heroines\" of Indian studio cinema. They have tempers, and short fuses. They're occasionally rude to one another, for reasons they might hide, or not even fully grasp themselves. Most importantly: even in the movie's more subdued scenes, their wheels are always turning, with thoughts and desires. But as much as the film is about this emotional psychology, it's an act of physical acceptance too, with casual depictions of breasts and body hair, and a shame-free frankness surrounding bodily function (urination, menstruation, even placentas) in ways seldom seen in Indian cinema. Accompanied by Dhritiman Das's twinkling score, which feels like music turned to starlight, the camera makes these women's lives, and their physical beings, feel radiant, and complete."
