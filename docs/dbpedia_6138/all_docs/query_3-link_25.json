        "text": "59 Book-To-Film Differences In \"The Wheel Of Time\"\n\nThere's no doubt that Amazon's incredible adaptation of The Wheel of Time is different to the series it is based on by Robert Jordan. But just how different are we talking?\n\nThe Wheel of Time is a high fantasy series that explores the dualism of light and dark and the pursuit of the Dragon — the person fated to both save and destroy the world. Robert Jordan’s 15-book series (including a prequel) has attracted millions of fantasy fans throughout the years, but naturally, in a television adaptation rumored to span eight seasons, some changes are necessary. And based on ratings and viewing numbers for the wildly successful first season, a bit of change can be a good thing.\n\nWarning! The list below contains spoilers for Season 1 of Prime Video’s The Wheel of Time as well as Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series, especially the first book, The Eye of the World.\n\n1. The book's prologue from The Eye of the World with Lews Therin and Ishamael has been left out of the show.\n\n2. The show starts with Red Ajah sisters hunting down a male channeller, something we never overtly witness in the books.\n\n3. In the books, Rand is the main point-of-view character. In the show, it shifts to Moiraine.\n\n4. In the books, Aes Sedai's shawls show their Ajah. In the show, they are clad top-to-toe in their colors, and their rings show their Ajahs as well.\n\n5. The show depicts a cliff-jumping initiation ritual to the Women's Circle, which is not included in the book.\n\n6. In the show, Rand doesn't encounter a Myrddraal on the way into town, as he does in the book.\n\n7. In the book, Moiraine hides her status as an Aes Sedai in the Two Rivers, whereas in the show, she indicates her station with pride.\n\n8. In the show, Perrin is married and kills his wife accidentally. In the book, he's single.\n\n9. The show has given Mat a much darker background than his wholesome childhood in the books.\n\n10. In the books, Rand and Egwene are \"promised\" to each other, but in the show, their relationship is much more serious.\n\n11. In the books, Nynaeve is definitely from the Two Rivers, but the show has her as an outlander.\n\n12. The show has expanded Bel Tine to be more than a simple spring ceremony, as it was in the book. Now, it offers a glimpse into the lore of The Wheel of Time.\n\n13. In the show, there is no talking Trolloc who tries to convince Rand to surrender, as there is the book.\n\n14. In the book, we don't get to see Moiraine and Lan defend the Two Rivers like we do in the show.\n\n15. In the book, Nynaeve doesn't get captured by a Trolloc like she does in the show.\n\n16. Moiraine gets hurt in the show, whereas she is unscathed in the book.\n\n17. In the books, the Whitecloaks were annoying zealots. In the show, they are depicted as much, much deadlier.\n\n18. Master Hightower doesn't die in the book, whereas he dies a violent death in the show.\n\n19. Rat dreams from the book are changed to bat dreams in the show.\n\n20. In the first book, only Egwene and Perrin meet the Whitecloaks. In the show, the whole gang gets the...pleasure.\n\n21. The show has made it much harder to figure out who the Dragon Reborn is. The book makes it pretty obvious.\n\n22. Elyas, Perrin's mentor, has been left out of the show (for now).\n\n23. In Shadar Logoth, we don't meet Mordeth, the Trollocs stay outside, and Mashadar looks different than in the book.\n\n24. Breen’s Spring in the show replaces the book's journey through Baerlon, Whitebridge, and Four Kings.\n\n25. There are (technically) no Aielmen, dead or otherwise, in the first book, whereas we see a corpse of one in the show.\n\n26. Thom Merrilin is a total fox in the show, compared to his cute old grandfather vibes from the books.\n\n27. Dana the darkfriend is an original character for the show.\n\n28. Logain is important in the books, but he is given a bigger role much earlier in the show.\n\n29. Ghealdan doesn't side with Logain in the books, whereas the show depicts the king as one of the Dragonsworn.\n\n30. In the book, Karene has been dead some 20 years when The Eye of the World takes place. In the show, she's alive and well, and then...not so alive or well.\n\n31. The Grinwells suffer a grislier fate in the show compared to the book.\n\n32. The show is open about Green Ajah's sexual openness compared to the books using innuendo.\n\n33. Logain's army showing up to rescue him was an original scene for the show.\n\n34. Nynaeve doesn't explode with power in The Eye of the World the way she does in the show.\n\n35. In the show, we travel to Tar Valon instead of Caemlyn as we do in the book.\n\n36. Rand hides from Moiraine in the show, but actively looks for her in the book.\n\n37. The show has Liandrin as a political manipulator, whereas in the books she doesn't appear until the start of book two (and when she does, politics aren't her game).\n\n38. Perrin and Egwene escape the Whitecloaks on their own in the show, without Moiraine, Lan, and Nynaeve's help (like they do in the book).\n\n39. Siuan's childhood scene was an original for the show.\n\n40. In the books, Logain's trial happens offscreen. In the show, we witness every minute of it.\n\n41. Moiraine (seems to) heal Mat fully in the show, whereas in the books it takes a team of Aes Sedai to separate him from the dagger.\n\n42. Moiraine and Siuan are in a relationship in the show, rather than the innuendo of \"pillow-friends\" in the books.\n\n43. Moiraine is not exiled like she is in the show, and she never returns to the White Tower in the books.\n\n44. The Waygates look less like the stone doors from the books and more like stone gates in the show.\n\n45. In the book, Mat goes into the Ways and remains with the group unlike the show where he stays behind.\n\n46. Machin Shin has been changed to invade the darkest parts of your mind in the show. In the books, it just wants to slurp your bone marrow.\n\n47. The show has Nynaeve save everyone (again) with another explosive display of the One Power, instead of the group conveniently leaving the Ways in the nick of time as they do in the book.\n\n48. Lady Amalisa has trained at the White Tower in the show, whereas in the book she's just an Aes Sedai groupie.\n\n49. In the show, we meet Min in Fal Dara instead of Baerlon, as we do in the book.\n\n50. Min's viewing of the Amyrlin Seat being Moiraine's downfall in the show is new. In the books, she has a lot of viewings, but the Amyrlin wrecking Moiraine ain't one of them.\n\n51. There is no love triangle between Rand, Egwene, and Perrin in the books. In the show, Perrin has been burning a candle for Egwene all along.\n\n52. Lan and Nynaeve have much more chemistry (and get much more physical early on) in the show when compared to the books.\n\n53. In the show, Moiraine and Rand head for the Eye of the World alone, instead of the whole group heading there, as they do in the book.\n\n54. The show changes the original (and confusing) book ending by leaving out the Green Man, cannon-fodder Forsaken, and a pool of saidin.\n\n55. The Horn of Valere has been hidden under Agelmar's throne in the show, rather than at the Eye of the World as it is in the book.\n\n56. In the show, Nynaeve, Egwene, and Amalisa's channeling circle kills the Trolloc army at Tarwin's Gap instead of Rand, who takes care of it in the book.\n\n57. Agelmar and Amalisa are killed off early in the show, whereas they survive in the books.\n\n58. Loial is stabbed by the ruby dagger in the show, while he is far from harm in the book.\n\n59. In the show, we see Moiraine's stilling/shielding and Rand's self-imposed exile. In the book, the core characters leave the Eye of the World intact.\n\nSo there you have it: all the ways that the show changed from the books — a remarkably short list, actually, when considering just how much content got packed into Season 1. While the fandom is torn between changes we loved and changes we loathed, it’s clear that this is a different turning of The Wheel of Time…and that the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. Who knows what the next seasons have in store for us? All we know is that it can’t air soon enough… And now the Longing begins while we wait for Season 2.\n\nShare This Article"
