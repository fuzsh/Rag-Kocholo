Many of these models produce that frisson of nostalgia for old TV shows like Scooby Doo, Batman or Knight Rider.\n\nI have bought a few models which for me are full of childhood nostalgia: Scooby Doo’s Mystery Machine, I used to love watching that cartoon, Herbie from The Love Bug (1968), one of the first films I ever saw at the cinema and a great influence on my interest in cars and strangely Star Trek’s USS Enterprise, which seems an unusual choice for a Hot Wheels having no wheels and being far from the rough 1:64 scale of the rest of the range."
