        "text": "The universe likes to remind me sometimes that it’s in control. I never doubt it, but I do get to feeling in heady moments that I might have a greater volition than I do. I have put off writing this story because I hate real endings, especially when they regard friendships.\n\nIt’s a fine idea, so very pretty to think of, those open endings in non-Hollywood films. Take Neil Jordan’s The Crying Game, for instance. At the end, will Fergus realize that he’s in love with Dil and be able to love Dil like “a man loves a woman” once he’s released from prison? As Fergus is a former IRA man now in an English prison, maybe that’s a moot point. Anyway, it’s fun to speculate and not know what, or where, the future lies.\n\nFor me, yesterday I saw New York Times music critic Lindsay Zoladz’ new “Amplifier” playlist of songs, and one of these was Neil Young’s “The Losing End (When You’re On).” It’s the song that begins side two of Young’s second album, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, perhaps my favorite of his albums.\n\nZoladz’s theme yesterday was of songs that call out great guitar cues, so in the middle of “Losing End,” someone — Zoladz speculates late Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten — “cartoonishly high voice screeches, ‘All right, Wilson, pick it!’”"
