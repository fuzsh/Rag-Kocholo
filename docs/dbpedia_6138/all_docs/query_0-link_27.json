        "text": "“Coco,” a Disney animated film, tells the story of Miguel, a young Mexican boy, who dreams of becoming a musician. However, Miguel’s family does not support Miguel’s dream since Miguel’s great-great grandmother fell in love with a musician, who left her with a child. On El Día De Los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebration, an important tradition for Miguel’s family, Miguel gets transported to the world of the dead. In his journey through the world of the dead, Miguel discovers the importance of family and his love for music.\n\nWith a touch of traditional Mariachi and Ranchera music, the original music in “Coco” is excellent. Though traditional Mariachi and Ranchera songs are mostly in Spanish, the songs in “Coco” are effective in finding the right balance between English and Spanish while maintaining the feeling of traditional Mexican music. The performance for the song “Un Poco Loco” is one of the most memorable moments in the film. The songs are not forced into the movie. Instead, the songs flow very well with the story. As the title of the song “Remember Me” implies, you will leave the theater remembering the good songs.\n\nThe original screenplay of the film is noteworthy. The portrayal of Mexican culture is by far one of the best portrayals in modern film. The film does a fantastic job in demonstrating family dynamic in Mexican families. The way Disney used the Day of the Dead celebration to forward the story was genius. I would not be surprised if the film is nominated for Original Screenplay at the 90th Academy Awards.\n\nOverall, “Coco” is a memorable film. The theme of the film- the importance of family- is well executed. The film is heart-warming and enjoyable for all ages. The ending is beautiful and emotional; I even heard some of the audience in the theater sniffling as the movie ended. I give the film five stars out of five stars. I recommend showing up to the film 30 minutes after the official, theater movie time. Before the beginning of “Coco,” there is a short film based on the film “Frozen,” and the short film is atrocious. Unlike “Coco,” “Olaf’s Frozen Adventure” has forced songs, average characters, and predictable plotline."
