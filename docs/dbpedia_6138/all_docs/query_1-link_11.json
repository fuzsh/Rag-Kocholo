        "text": "FIVE MINUTES WITH INTI CARBONI\n\nATFF:\n\nHello, not long now till this summer’s Adventure Travel Film Festival. We are so excited to be sharing so many fantastic films this year. Lets start with a quick summary of yours, what’s it about?\n\nInti:\n\nIt’s a skateboarding journey through the Rationalist architecture of the Cinecittà film studios in Rome, and some of the permanent movie sets it holds\n\nATFF:\n\nHow did the film come about? Was it something that you’ve always been interested in?\n\nInti:\n\nMy old friends at Murder Skateboarding approached me to write and direct a skateboarding video for their company. We exchange ideas and when they came to Rome I took them on a insider tour of the Cinecittà studios. Most skateboarding videos have a architectural view to it, and that was definitely a very interesting terrain. We approached the studios management with a throughly planned project and they gave us their blessing.\n\nI was a skateboarder in the late eighties and always kept with me that skater eye that sees architectural patterns as structures to ollie over or grind. Crossing that with my love for film history made it the perfect project.\n\nATFF:\n\nThis years films have spanned oceans mountains, glaciers… a huge range of environments. What challenges did you face in making yours?\n\nInti:\n\nI tried to use a cinematic language that could portray both the architecture and the skateboarding energy. The biggest challenge was to find a balance with those two languages. And for the skaters, to work with the very rough industrial terrain of the studios.\n\nATFF:\n\nIs there anything that you would like audiences to take away from your film?\n\nInti:\n\nThe beauty of Cinecittà is this magical world nestled between the block of flats of the outskirts of Rome and the roman ruins in the nearby parks. I hope I was able to show the audience all of that.\n\nATFF:\n\nWe have lots of people come to the festival who aspire to future film makers. Do you have any advice?\n\nInti:\n\nTo work in films at any level you need the following: careful planning, capacity of adapting to change and use problems to you advantage, strong legs and a pair of very comfortable shoes.\n\nATFF:\n\nAre you coming to this years festival? How can audiences find out more and connect with you?\n\nInti:\n\nI may be working during the festival, so I don’t know yet. You can see my work at: vimeo.com/inticarboni\n\nATFF:\n\nThanks, we can’t wait to share the films this year!"
