        "text": "From the \"I Know It's Hard to Believe But I Swear to God It's True\" Department:\n\nColumbia Pictures announced today that the studio has gained exclusive rights to develop and produce a feature film based on the popular Hot Wheels line of toys. The live-action film will be directed by McG, best known for the Charlie's Angels franchise.\n\nLet's all just let that sink in for a moment. A big budget Hot Wheels live-action film directed by the man responsible for the Charlie's Angels franchise and the FOX series Fastlane. High concept, thy name is now Hot Wheels.\n\n\"We all grew up with Hot Wheels – it's one of the great, clean renowned brands of our generation,\" McG said in a press release issued by the studio. \"We've been given the opportunity to bring to life a world inspired by color, adventure and velocity. We want to create a timeless story that will work for everyone – a charismatic young hero, great stakes and jeopardy, and a fantastic love story.\" There is no proof to the rumor that the director then laughed hysterically at what he'd just said.\n\nThe director went on to describe the currently unwritten film as having \"all the warmth and humanity of your favorite James Dean movie with the state-of-the-art visual effects and the hottest collection of automobiles ever brought to the screen.\" Or maybe just a lot of cars that go really fast around loop de loops. I personally can't wait to see that bubble topped spaceship looking thing on screen. Mine always kept falling off the track.\n\nThis opens up a whole new avenue of franchise opportunities for the U.S. film industry. After having successfully strip mined even the worst of the literary, stage, television and comics mediums, the relatively untapped toy-to-film market could be the next big thing at your local cineplex. Forget the animated treatments that toys like G.I. Joe got in the '80s – we're looking at A-list directors working with real actors and big budgets. It's only a matter of time before we see the super hero film Stretch Armstrong: The Movie or the war film, Axis & Allies. Snakes & Ladders could become a fantasy / horror franchise while a rival studio is sure to pick up the rights to Matchbox (a film that will look like Hot Wheels but will only cost about half as much to produce).\n\nWhy the sudden interest in toy-themed films? One possibility is the ability to take an established name, in this case, Hot Wheels and create a story out of whole cloth. Unlike most other licensing fodder for big budget theatrical films, the audience has no preconceived notion about how the characters in the film should look or act. Compare that to the scrutiny that films like Spider-Man or the upcoming Hulk and Daredevil are going through and you can see why avoiding a nit-picky fan base would look attractive to a film maker. As long as the cars look good and are made available in blister packs at the Toys R Us, the fan base will be happy. The plot and characters can be created as needed without the constant complaints from fans and the press that \"this character wouldn't do that\" or \"you designed this costume all wrong.\"\n\nSuddenly, this isn't looking like such a bad idea after all. I wonder if the film rights to the Slinky have been snapped up yet?"
