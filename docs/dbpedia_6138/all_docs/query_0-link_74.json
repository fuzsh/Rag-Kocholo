        "text": "Metonymy definition\n\nMetonymy is a type of figurative language or a figure of speech, that refers to a thing by the name of something associated with it. The word that replaces the original thing is called a metonym.\n\nMetonymy examples\n\nIn this section, we’ll look at examples of metonymy. As metonymy can be quite a difficult concept to grasp, we will offer some brief explanations along the way.\n\nMetonyms for people and objects\n\nOne of the most famous examples is “the crown” as a metonym for the monarch (a king or queen – for the sake of this example we’ll say there’s a queen in charge). If somebody was to say, “I swore allegiance to the Crown”, this doesn’t literally mean that they pledged their loyalty to a piece of fancy headwear – really they are saying, “I swore allegiance to the Queen”. A crown is something closely associated with a queen, which is why you can replace the word “queen” with “crown” and we still understand what it means.\n\nHave you ever heard anybody refer to businesspeople as “suits”? An example of this could be, “I’m going for a meeting with the suits from head office”. In this sentence, “suits” is a metonym for businesspeople.\n\nEver seen an action movie where somebody mentions “a hired gun”? They’re most likely referring to a person associated with a gun: an assassin.\n\nSome metonyms are so common that we barely even notice them. For example, if I asked you, “What’s your favourite dish?” I wouldn’t expect you to reply, “bone china” or “porcelain”! Most people would understand the question as, “What’s your favourite meal?” – therefore, “dish” is a metonym for meal.\n\nAnother subtle example of metonymy is if I asked, “Have you heard the new Billie Eilish?” What I really mean is, “Have you heard the new Billie Eilish song?” It’s common to refer to an artist’s work by their name; another example of this would be, “I’ve got a Picasso hanging up in my living room”.\n\nThere are a lot of slang terms for “money”, but one of the most common (and one that works as a metonym) is “bread” (or sometimes “dough”); for example, “I need a job so I can start making some bread”, or, “I need a job so I can start making some dough”. Bread (which is made from dough) is something closely associated with money, as we all know that having money means that you can eat!\n\nMetonyms aren’t limited to just nouns; they can also be verbs or any other type of word, as long as there is a close association. For example, if I said, “My ride is parked outside”, “ride” would be a metonym for car. This works even though “ride” is a verb because there is a close association – you “ride” in a car.\n\nMetonyms for abstract concepts\n\nYou can also use metonymy to refer to abstract concepts, ideas and emotions. For example, “from the cradle to the grave” is a common expression meaning “from birth until death”; in this phrase, “the cradle” is a metonym for birth, and “the grave” is a metonym for death. Similarly, there are parts of the world known as “cradles of civilization”; this phrase refers to the fact that early cultures developed in these places; they are birthplaces of civilization.\n\n“Heart” can be used as a metonym for several things. The most obvious meaning is love, as in, “I gave you my heart”; we understand this as meaning, “I gave you my love”. Also, if you “put your heart” into something, it can mean that you have put passion, energy, or effort into it. “Heart” works as a metonym in both contexts.\n\nExamples of metonymy: a recap\n\nMetonymMeaningExample phraseCrownMonarch (king/queen)I swore allegiance to the Crown.SuitBusinesspersonI’m going for a meeting with the suits from head office.GunAssassinIn his new movie, Keanu Reeves plays the part of a hired gun.DishMealWhat’s your favourite dish?Billie EilishBillie Eilish songHave you heard the new Billie Eilish?PicassoPicasso paintingI’ve got a Picasso hanging up in my living room.Bread/doughMoneyI need a job so I can start making some bread/dough.RideCarMy ride is parked outside.CradleBirth/birthplaceFrom the cradle to the grave / This region is a cradle of civilization.GraveDeathFrom the cradle to the grave.HeartLoveI gave you my heart.HeartPassion/energy/effortI put my heart into my work.\n\nMetonymy vs synecdoche – what’s the difference?\n\nBefore we start, an important side note:\n\nSome people class synecdoche as a type of metonymy, while others class it as a separate thing altogether. Not even the experts can fully agree on this though! For the sake of clarity, we have stuck to the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) definition, categorising synecdoche as separate from metonymy. We would recommend asking your tutor for their opinion on this. Regardless, this section will help you understand what distinguishes synecdoche.\n\nSynecdoche is similar to metonymy, but there are some key differences. This may seem complex at first, but bear with us and by the end of this section you will be able to tell them apart.\n\nSynecdoche is also a type of figurative language, but it is different from metonymy in that it either:\n\nRefers to a thing by the name of something that is part of it, OR\n\nRefers to a thing by the name of something that it is part of.\n\nIn other words, it is a part that refers to the whole, or a whole that refers to the part.\n\nExamples of synecdoche as a part that refers to the whole:\n\nCheck out my new wheels.\n\n“Wheels” = car (wheels are PART of a car).\n\nI bought myself some new threads.\n\n“Threads” = clothes (threads are a PART of clothes).\n\nI’ve got mouths to feed.\n\n“Mouths” = people (mouths are a PART of people).\n\nExamples of synecdoche as a whole that refers to the part:\n\nGermany won the world cup.\n\n“Germany” = The Germany football team (Germany is a WHOLE that includes the football team).\n\nI was pulled over by the police.\n\n“The police” = police officers (the police is a WHOLE that includes those specific police officers).\n\nWashington is negotiating new trade agreements.\n\n“Washington” = the US government (Washington is a WHOLE that includes the US government).\n\nSo how is synecdoche different to metonymy? Both refer to a thing by the name of something else, right? Yes, but there is a subtle difference: metonymy refers to a thing by the name of something associated with it. Synecdoche refers to a thing by the name of something that is part of it, OR something that it is part of. Think of metonymy as using symbols to represent a thing, whereas synecdoche either zooms in to a part of it or zooms out to show what it is part of.\n\nYou might be thinking, “Isn’t a crown part of a monarch?” or “Isn’t a suit part of a businessperson?” Well, sort of, but as they are not physically attached to the person in question (they are costumes or adornments) they are still classed as metonyms.\n\nIf you ever find yourself confused as to whether something is a metonym or a synecdoche, ask yourself:\n\nIs it a part of the thing, or something that is physically attached? If so it is a synecdoche.\n\nIs it something bigger (such as a country, city, building or authority) that contains the thing? If so it is a synecdoche.\n\nIs it a symbol (such as an object or item of clothing) that represents the thing? If so it is a metonym.\n\nIs it a verb (such as an action or occurrence), or something else associated with the thing? If so it is a metonym.\n\nMetonymy vs metaphor – what’s the difference?\n\nMetaphor, another type of figurative language, is also easily confused with metonymy. Here’s a simple way to differentiate the two:\n\nMetonymy is about association; it refers to one thing as another thing to show that there is a link between them.\n\nMetaphor is about comparison; it refers to one thing as another thing to make us see the similarities between them.\n\nLet’s go back to the example of a car; we will use the same sentence from earlier on and then modify it so that it is a metaphor.\n\nMy ride is parked outside.\n\n“Ride” is an association with a car; you “ride” in a car. Therefore, this is an example of metonymy.\n\nMy tin can is parked outside.\n\nA tin can is not something commonly associated with a car. In this sentence, the speaker is drawing a comparison between their car and a tin can; both are objects made of metal, and the speaker seems to be telling us that their car is cheap and flimsy, like a tin can. This imaginative comparison is an example of metaphor.\n\nMetonymy, synecdoche or metaphor?\n\nIf you’re still struggling to determine whether something is metonymy, synecdoche or metaphor, don’t worry, we’re here to help! Follow the flowchart below to find your answer:\n\nFocus on the word, or part of the phrase, that refers to a thing by the name of something else.\n\nE.g., “I have a meeting with the suits”; “I wonder how England will do in the World Cup”; “You are my sunshine”.\n\nNow, let’s begin…\n\nMetonymy - Key takeaways\n\nMetonymy is a type of figurative language, or a figure of speech, that refers to a thing by the name of something associated with it. The word that replaces the original thing is called a metonym.\n\nA metonym works because it is the name of something closely associated with the thing it is replacing. For example, “dish” is closely associated with “meal”, so it works as a metonym for meal in the sentence, “What’s your favourite dish?”\n\nMetonymy is different from synecdoche; a metonym is something associated with the thing it refers to, whereas a synecdoche is either something that is part of the thing or that the thing is part of. For example, wheels are part of a car, and so “wheels” works as a synecdoche for car in the sentence, “Check out my new wheels”.\n\nMetonymy is also different from metaphor; metonymy is about association, whereas metaphor is about comparison. For example, if you describe a car as a “tin can”, it is a metaphor, as tin cans are not typically associated with cars, but with a bit of imagination, you can see some similarities."
