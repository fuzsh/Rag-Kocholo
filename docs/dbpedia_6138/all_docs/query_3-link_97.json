        "text": "James Bond’s legacy of famous cars and far-out gadgets can be traced back from one vehicle: the 1964 Aston Martin DB5 that 007 drove in Goldfinger and Thunderball. Without any Bond spy modifications, the Aston Martin DB5 is a work of art. But it’s the special effects that have made this car quite possibly the most beloved movie car of all time.\n\nDive Deeper: The Action-Packed History of the World's Most Famous Spy Car\n\nThe long list of cool tricks included ram bumper, machine guns, ejector seat, smoke screen, oil-slick sprayer, and more. Looking back on the Aston from today’s perspective, the most interesting feature may be the map screen in Bond’s car, which foreshadowed today’s navigation systems.\n\nSo just how influential and significant is the original Bond car? One of the few Astons used in those movies sold last year for a whopping $4.6 million.\n\nIt’s become so popular that Aston Martin is sending the iconic vehicle back to the production line. The manufacturer announced earlier this year that they will release 25 limited edition vehicles for about $3.5 million a piece.\n\nOne more Bond car, because it’s a classic.\n\nBy the 1970s, the voluptuous shapes of sports cars from the 1950s and 1960s gave way to distinctive and futuristic wedge designs. Pointy cars like the Lancia Stratos and Lamborghini Countach changed the automotive landscape. But neither one of them were ever driven by James Bond.\n\nIn The Spy Who Loved Me, the secret agent drove the white Series I Lotus Esprit hard. Yet, the moment that sticks in everyone’s mind is when the car transforms into a submarine after Bond jumps the car into the water. The Lotus sprouts stabilizer fins and props, and later, it drives up onto the beach as it morphs back into a car—with beachgoers staring slack-jawed.\n\nMore Cool Toys: 23 of James Bond's Most Memorable Gadgets\n\nThe Lotus swerved back into the headlines last year when a couple found the car in an unclaimed storage unit they had purchased for $1. They then sold it to Elon Musk for a cool mil’.\n\nWhen Smokey and the Bandit director Hal Needham chose a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am to star in his movie alongside Burt Reynolds and Sally Field, he couldn’t have predicted the impact that car would have on America.\n\nThe Trans Am actually looked more or less the same for more than a half decade before the film debuted. But that didn’t matter. When audiences saw that Trans Am slide around corners, leap over broken bridges, and evade Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) for hundreds of miles, they wanted a black and gold T/A in their garage.\n\nRead This: The Best Pontiacs in Film, Music and TV\n\nAfter the movie hit theaters, sales leapt by about 30,000 cars from 1977 to 1978 and by another 24,000 for 1979. Americans went nuts for the Starlight Black Special Edition paint job, the T-Top roof, and the fact that the car was quicker and better-handling than the Corvette of the same generation. It was probably a combination of all three—plus a heaping dollop of Burt’s star appeal—that made the Trans Am a legend.\n\nA few years before Star Wars, George Lucas shot American Graffiti, a reflection of his memories of the car culture in California in the 1960s. Besides a cast that included future megastars such as Ron Howard, Harrison Ford, and Richard Dreyfus, the movie had some great hot rods. But only one has become the most recognized Deuce Coupe in the world.\n\nDive Deeper: How I Finally Built My Dream Car, a 1934 Ford Coupe\n\nThe brash Canary yellow ’32 Ford highboy is powered by a Chevy 327 V-8, and sits a little tall in the rear for some seriously cool rake. The climatic drag race on Paradise Road pits Paul Le Mat (John Milner) in the ’32 Ford against an equally tough-looking ’55 Chevy driven by Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford). The ’32 Ford smokes the Chevy off the line, and halfway down the road the Chevy flies off the road, flips, and blows. It’s an amazing special-effects scene, but in reality, the same ’55 Chevys in this movie would appear (painted flat gray) in another car movie classic, Two Lane Blacktop.\n\nVisually, John DeLorean’s DMC-12 was a stainless-steel stunner designed by the legendary Giorgetto Giugiaro. Under the hood, though, the DeLorean wasn’t quite the supercar that flashy bodywork promised, carrying a pokey 130-hp 2.9-liter V-6. No matter.\n\nIts futuristic looks, combined with a bit of movie magic, gave the DeLorean legendary status, and because it was a time machine in the film, the real-life specs didn’t really matter, with one exception: Reportedly, the prop staff replaced that sluggish V-6 with a V-8 from the Porsche 928, which went a long way toward helping Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) hit 88 mph, fire up the Flux Capacitor, and shoot back to 1955.\n\nDespite its movie celebrity, the DeLorean flopped on the market in the 1980s. But the car’s unique, retro-futurist design has earned it a cult following today. There’s even a new DeLorean Motor Company restoring and improving the cars.\n\nAny vehicle driven, ridden, or even stood next to by Steve McQueen was instantly made cooler. But the Highland Green 1968 Ford Mustang GT 390 didn’t need much help. The movie’s chase scenes on the streets of San Francisco, tailing a 1968 Dodge Charger, are some of the best ever recorded on film. And the stripped-down look of the movie Mustangs made them subtly meaner-looking than regular production ’Stangs. The original magnesium American Racing Torque Thrust wheels give McQueen’s car its aggressive stance.\n\nYou know a car has transcended its cult movie status and become an icon when a car company makes a limited edition version twice, as Ford has with the Bullitt Mustang.\n\nThe 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T—especially the Hemi model—was one of the most impressive pony cars to come out of the muscle boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s. And its reputation was cemented with the film Vanishing Point (though the R/Ts in the film were 440-powered).\n\nThe plot is simple: Kowalski (Barry Newman) bets that he can drive from Denver to San Francisco in less than 15 hours (which would require an average speed of over 80 mph). As you can imagine, there are plenty of great stunts, which were put together by the same team that worked on Bullitt. Kowalski dusts off a Jaguar XKE, launches the Challenger over a gully, and does all kinds of other crazy driving.\n\nHowever, there’s one glaring error: In the final crash that destroys the car, the filmmakers used a ’67 Camaro rather than a Challenger.\n\nWhen it comes to cars, Australians are historically just as power-hungry as Americans. So in the 1960s and 1970s, the Australian arms of American car companies created some fairly brutal muscle machines—cars we never saw in the States. One of them was the Ford Falcon.\n\nIn its third generation, the Falcon XB GT got its power from a 351-cid V-8. But for the movie Mad Max, the filmmakers transformed the already cool Falcon into the “Pursuit Special” or “Interceptor.” The crew plastered a new nose on the front end, emblazoned the body with huge flares, and tucked seriously fat tires underneath them.\n\nThe centerpiece was under the hood—or, more precisely, sticking out of it. In the movie, the switch-activated supercharger boosts the power of the interceptor any time Max needed to skedaddle. But, alas, it was only a movie and that supercharger was a fake.\n\nLike Bond cars, Batmobiles, in all their permutations, have transcended generations and remain cool. But the tough, militaristic Batmobile Tumbler that has appeared in Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins and The Dark Knight is the most visually and technically significant Batmobile since the George Barris-designed 1960s version. A beefy 350-cid Chevy V-8 powers the tank-like Tumbler to 60 mph in around five seconds, even with 37-inch off-road tires, according to the filmmakers. The front tires are mounted to an independent front suspension with around 30 inches of suspension travel. And the body is said to be made of more then 65 carbon-fiber panels.\n\nWhat makes the Tumbler cooler than most movie props these days is, simply, that it’s a real thing, not a computer-animated fantasy. We certainly dig that.\n\nThe classic 1968-70 Dodge Charger is a TV and movie superstar. The most famous of all was the ’69 Charger “General Lee” from the The Dukes of Hazzard TV show. Another Charger starred in the 1970s cult hit Dirty Mary Crazy Larry. But in 2000, the venerable Charger took to the screen again, this time built as a menacing black street-racing machine for Vin Diesel. With a wicked stance, giant rear tires, and a humongous engine and supercharger sticking out of the hood, the Charger was insanely cool.\n\nIt was the climactic action scene of the movie that made this car so memorable. As Vin Diesel’s character lines up against Paul Walker’s character, who’s driving a Supra, he floors the throttle and the Charger does a sick wheelstand and burnout at the same time. Movie magic for sure, but still fun to watch. Later in that same race, the two cars jump a set of train tracks just as a locomotive passes, and a heartbeat later, Diesel flips the Charger in a spectacular finish to the chase scene.\n\nGetting déjà vu? The Dodge Charger and the car-heavy Furious saga make the list again, and for good reason. For the seventh film, moviemakers reimagined Dom Toretto’s (Vin Diesel) black Charger into something even wilder than his original wheel-standing car. Dennis McCarthy, the vehicle’s builder, is an avid off-road race fan, and this particular Charger is basically a full Baja race truck in disguise. The suspension is a long-travel, high-clearance design that allows for massive off-road tires on bead-locked rims. To cover the larger wheels, the fenders have been expertly flared. They make the beast look incredibly imposing and capable.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable scene in the movie involves Toretto launching the Charger from the back of a transport plane at 30,000 feet and skydiving to the ground. The Charger floats down to the road below and suspension soaks up the landing after the chute detaches. Yes, it’s all very far-fetched. But there’s a shred of believability here, simply because that Charger is so well set up.\n\nKeanu Reeves’s most memorable on-screen vehicle just may be a Los Angeles city bus. But his coolest is the Mustang in the movie he made 20 years later, John Wick. The Mustang in question is identified in the movie as possibly being a “Boss 429,” but that’s not the case. A real Boss ’9 is rare and highly collectable—one sold at auction back in 2015 for $550,000. It’s likely the film crew used a ’69 Mustang Mach 1 with either a 390 V-8 or a 428. Both are plenty potent for on-screen antics and look absolutely badass.\n\nThe cool thing about this movie is that it’s clear this is a real car doing the driving without any CG. It’s also reported that Reeves did most of the stunt driving himself after going through a performance driving school. And one of the best scenes is watching him fishtail the Mustang around a wet airport parking lot, sliding it closer and closer to a row of dump trucks. The Mustang reappears in John Wick Chapter 2.\n\nAfter a three-decade wait, few Mad Max fans expected Fury Road to be packed with so many wild and innovative vehicles, but one could argue it had more interesting cars and trucks than any Mad Max installment before it. Perhaps the wildest of them all is the Gigahorse.\n\nNeed to Know: How to Recover a Stuck Vehicle by Yourself\n\nThis beast looks like it should exist entirely in CG. But no, this is a real thing. Double ’59 Cadillac bodies ride atop a massive truck chassis powered by twin Chevy big block V-8s that have both been supercharged. All that power turns massive tractor tires that give the monster a stance of a funny car dragster from the 1970s—on stilts.\n\nThough the Gigahorse doesn’t really do too much in terms of typical movie car stunts, it’s captivating to simply watch the thing just driving straight through the desert. The most memorable scene with the ’horse is in the long final chase of the movie, as the convoy enters a tight canyon. Spoiler: Max (Tom Hardy), Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), and their crew finally kill Immortan Joe, the bad guy driving the Gigahorse.\n\nThe Bluesmobile may not be the Batmobile, but this decommissioned Mount Prospect, Illinois, police cruiser is just as recognizable as Jake and Elwood Blues’ outfits. Born from Saturday Night Live veterans Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, the sketch resulted in two movies. The Dodge Monaco version was only used in first film; the sequel saw a 1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria as the Bluesmobile’s latest incarnation.\n\nThe film utilized 13 different cars as the Bluesmobile, all of which were former California Highway Department patrol cars made up to look like Mount Prospect patrol cars. Some of the cars were modified for speed, others for jumps or high-performance maneuvers, depending on the scene. More than 60 old police cars were purchased and used for the film’s many chase scenes—the volume resulting in a 24-hour body shop on set to perform repairs as needed. A world record 103 cars were wrecked during filming.\n\nCars, Demystified: The Most Important Facts (And Myths) About Your Car Battery\n\nLegendary custom car designer, fabricator, stuntman, and stunt coordinator—and creator of the Monkeemobile—Dean Jeffries worked on the first movie, saying in Motor Trend, “I worked on The Blues Brothers—we must’ve smashed a couple hundred cars on that one.”\n\nThe number of wrecks for Blues Brothers 2000? 104. No better person to surpass you than yourself.\n\nHow could we leave a horror movie centered around a 1958 Plymouth Fury off the list? Stephen King was so popular at the time and had enough clout that the film went into production before the book was even published. Anywhere between 23 and 28 cars were used in the film (sources vary), and not all of them were Furys. Columbia Pictures placed ads across the country looking to buy Belvederes and Savoys, too. The majority of the cars were used on screen and the rest were used for spare parts.\n\nThe illusion of Christine’s ability to regenerate herself was created using hydraulic pumps located inside the car that were attached to the sides of a plastic-paneled body double. The pumps then sucked in the sides to create a damaged version of the car, and then the film was reversed. Some tricky special effects for 1983.\n\nAnother deceiving trick? The sound we hear from Christine’s engine isn’t actually a Plymouth Fury. Filmmakers used a recording of a 1970 Mustang 428 Super Cobra Jet engine.\n\nHold onto your butts: We're now entering Jurassic Park, circa 1993. Though the cars appear to be Jeeps, they’re really Ford Explorers, and a solid portion of the movie takes place in and around them. While these Touring Vehicles didn’t see much off-roading, they’re an integral part of the Jurassic Park experience—before the dinos got loose and the characters realized they were stuck on Isla Nublar, that is.\n\nCustomized by Hollywood pro George Barris, many fans have been inspired to replicate the car, taking years to painstakingly re-create the ’90s icons. The cars were modified to give the illusion of automation by hiding the driver in the trunk, where they watched a small TV that was fed outside images via two cameras. S\n\nix cars were used in the film, charged at, stomped on, flipped over, and buffeted by prehistoric predators. Some were completely destroyed and at the end of filming three dumpsters had been filled with parts.\n\nAh, the Mirthmobile: the perfect get-around for a flame-throwing, headbanging, licorice-loving guy or gal. While Wayne's World resurrected the Pacer (and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody,”), it’s widely considered to be one of the ugliest cars ever made. Intending to break ground in the compact-car category at the time, its main selling point was its unusual width—it was as wide as a midsize car.\n\nWhoa: The 13 Most Dangerous Car Interiors in History\n\nIt’s typical for movies to have multiple versions of the same car, but it’s believed that only one Pacer was used for the cast’s trips to Stan Mikita’s Donuts. This Pacer has the larger 4.2-liter I-6 motor mated to a three-speed auto transmission. The hatchback was modified for the film inside and out, including a hole in the roof allowing for the installation of the red-rope licorice dispenser.\n\nThe Ectomobile, or ECTO-1 and ECTO-1A, is just as famous as the men riding inside it, maybe more so. Made from a 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor, it’s an end-loader ambulance/hearse combination with a 6.3-liter V-8, good for 320 horsepower. The original idea for the cruiser was more sinister, painted black with purple and white strobe lights to give it a glow. It would have been more than a pedestrian car, though, it would have had supernatural powers, mainly interdimensional travel and the ability to dematerialize. Once it was pointed out how often the car would be shot at night, the idea was nixed.\n\nWhoa: Welcome to the Smash Lab: Where Cars Die So You Can Live\n\nTwo of the cars were initially purchased, but the final converted version was primarily used during filming. We first see the Miller-Meteor in black and without modifications, the secondary vehicle, Dan Aykroyd prescribing “some suspension work and shocks, brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear end, new rings, mufflers, and a little wiring” before it can go out on calls. In New York City, sightings of the ECTO-1 during promotions after the film’s release caused car accidents.\n\nAfter this, the second vehicle was converted into a fully equipped Ectomobile, garnering the name ECTO-1A. After being mistreated and left to the elements on a Sony backlot, both cars were refurbished. ECTO-1 was fixed up and used as a promotional tool for the video-game release in 2009, and ECTO-1A was resurrected after a group of dedicated fans started a petition to purchase the car from Sony, ultimately restoring it themselves.\n\nIt’s not the ’80s without a proper movie montage, and what better fodder than restoring a vintage Camaro with John Cusack? Better Off Dead is an underrated classic, a coming-of-age story for Lane Meyer, who just wants to get the girl and kick some jock booty. An impulse purchase—because it looked “tasty”—and an eyesore on his family’s front lawn, he gets around to restoring the 1967 Chevy Camaro SS will the help from a French foreign exchange student.\n\nLove blooms, as well as his street cred, with this classic muscle car. The car still make appearances at shows across the U.S. after a zealous fan tracked down the screen-used model used in the film.\n\nGrab yourself a White Russian and enjoy this 1973 Gran Torino. It may look like a beater, but it was an underrated star of The Big Lebowski, and an extension of The Dude’s being. Originally, his ride was supposed to be a Chrysler LeBaron, but it wasn’t large enough to accommodate Mr. Walter Sobchak himself, John Goodman. A switch was made to the Torino, which was a redesign of the ’72 model with a longer, over-exaggerated front nose.\n\nThere were two Gran Torinos used in the filming: One was destroyed in the movie, while the other made a splash on a season 8 episode of The X-Files ... where it was also destroyed."
