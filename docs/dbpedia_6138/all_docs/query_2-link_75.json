        "text": "There’s no epic split, but there is an epic snog—or as close as two large trucks can get to it, anyway—in a new, charmingly ludicrous Volvo Trucks film from Forsman & Bodenfors.\n\nThe 1:30 spot, titled “A Love Story,” features two Volvo FH trucks with “I-Save,” a suite of features that allow the vehicles to achieve great gas mileage as well as great performance—benefits that are often seen as either/or.\n\nThe two trucks represent those polar opposites, “Efficiency” and “Fun,” and they immediately attract in the the most schmaltzy way imaginable, to the strains of “Nothing’s Gonna Change My Love for You” by George Benson.\n\n“We always use creativity to solve business problems. The challenge this time was to highlight multiple product features while also showing that fun and efficiency can indeed be combined,” says Karolina Groop, creative at Forsman & Bodenfors. “What is the best way to showcase efficient hill climbing and improved aerodynamics if not by having two lovesick trucks cresting a ridiculously steep hill and taking off into the clouds?”\n\nThe film was shot in Croatia. Volvo drivers Johan Brorsson and Mikael Rosell, both of whom worked on the famed Live Test Series, were involved in a live-action shoot, while VFX artists did the rest.\n\n“A lot was done in-camera, but some things were, believe it or not, added in post production,” says Groop. “And just like with human love, there’s a blurry line between reality and fantasy. What’s real and what’s not?”\n\nLars Jansson, creative at Forsman & Bodenfors, jokes that managing the actors was the hardest part of the shoot. “Attraction is not something you can force and since it was the first time the trucks met, we didn’t know if they would hit it off or if there would just be awkward silence,” he says. “Luckily, it was love at first sight, and as far as we know they are still a thing.”\n\nCREDITS\n\nCreative Agency: Forsman & Bodenfors\n\nAccount Director: Cilla Pegelow\n\nAccount Executive: Britta Nilsson\n\nArt Director: Lars Jansson\n\nCopywriter: Karolina Groop\n\nDesigner: Jerry Wass\n\nStrategic Planner: Daniel Sjöstrand\n\nAgency Producer, Film: Lena Sellman\n\nDigital Strategist: Peter Gaudiano\n\nAccount executive film and stills adaptations: Sofie Ahlström\n\nFilm adaptations: F&B Studios\n\nStills retouch: F&B Daily\n\nProduction company: Business Club Royale\n\nDirector: Daniel Warwick\n\nDoP: Jan David Gunther\n\nProducer: Jakob Rühle\n\nExecutive Producer: Christian Kuosmanen & Anders Gernandt\n\nPost production & VFX: bEpic Berlin\n\nMusic: George Benson – “Nothing’s Gonna Change My Love for You”\n\nClient team AB Volvo:\n\nMarketing Communications Manager – Agneta Malmcrona\n\nManager, Marketing Communications – Maria Holst"
