        "text": "What's left to say about Adolf Hitler? Three years ago, when I was producing and directing this six-episode documentary series, Hitler: The Lost Tapes of the Third Reich, which premieres at 9 p.m., Monday, April 10, on Nat Geo, that was always the first question. I asked the same thing when I took the job. Despite years of work on the subject of the Third Reich as a print and broadcast journalist, despite living and working in Berlin in the 1990's, fifty years after the end of World War II, despite being a German major in college and speaking fluent German, I had never focused on Hitler. He seemed like more of a fetish and a dead end than a subject for historical inquiry. The truth surprised me. Turns out there's a lot left to say, especially if the audience is American and under forty. Younger generations don't get a detailed history of the Third Reich, by and large, and even the serious historical research about Hitler has come to look sketchy. Generations of scholars tended to discover their own version of the dictator, depending on whether they specialized in art history or child psychology, and the result has been a gallery of Hitlers painted in various colors to reflect his distance from or proximity to the horrors of the Holocaust. Was he an evil wizard, a crime boss, a political mastermind? A kid who got bit on the penis by a goat and never recovered from it? The answers often reflect the sub-cultures that produced the questions and leave Hitler himself in the murk So how does this new documentary try to correct the record? The eyewitnesses tell the story, and even their distortions speak volumes. Most are dead now, of course, but in Hitler: The Lost Tapes of the Third Reich, the voices return. This documentary is built around audio cassette recordings of interviews conducted by the American historian John Toland in the early 1970's. Many close associates, including early financial supporters, founding Nazi Party members, Third Reich big shots, military generals and others were still alive in that era and wanted to tell their stories in such a way that they could salvage their own reputations and legacy by promoting the human side of Hitler. Toland caught lightning in a bottle. In 2019, Left/Right producer Steve Yaccino gained access to Toland's tapes, stored for years at the Library of Congress, Toland's daughter Tamiko gave permission for their use, and CNN green-lit an exclusive and arguably definitive documentary history. Nat Geo is airing it. Long story. Thanks to Molly Raskin, Ann Tyler Moses, Axel Gerdau, Steven Yaccino, Michelene Starnadori, Matthew Frank, Savannah Holte, Ian Kelsey, Timothy Moran, Amy Rockefeller, Gregory Littauer, Greg Greenwald, Lyle Gamm, Katie Hinman, Claire Sinofsky, Philipp Friesenbichler, Victoria Toth, Becky Goldberg, Marlon Singleton, Craig J. Snider, Rishika Advani and so many others who gave us the support we needed to deliver this epic in the heart of the heart of the pandemic.\n\nThis morning, CNN announced its 2023 documentary slate, and I'm extremely proud that our new documentary series \"Giuliani: What Happened To America's Mayor\" will premiere on January 8 with two 1-hour episodes back to back. The second two episodes will air on the following Sunday, January 15. I was privileged as showrunner in a chaotic moment to work with an outstanding team of producers, directors, editors and journalists at CNN and Left/Right. From the beginning, we had to embrace two difficult realities. One, Giuliani would likely never talk to us, no matter how many times and ways we asked, via text, voicemail and through intermediaries. Two, we were not the first out of the gate. We were aware of at least two other productions that began ahead of us and thus seemed likely to air before us, and a third jumped into the fray while we were in production. One of these three turned out to be a musical, and we were not budgeted for a single musical number. We were right about the first concern. Giuliani never responded to a single request. On the other hand, dozens of friends and associates, reporters who covered him and politicians who opposed him, sat down with our team and gave compelling eyewitness accounts. Ken Frydman, Liz Gruber, Charlie Perkins, Frank Luntz and Rick Wilson spoke about their work for Rudy on the campaign trail. Dan Barry, Jennifer Preston, Tish Durkin, Susan Glasser, Michael Tomasky and Dominic Carter remembered what it was like to cover him. Rep. Al Sharpton, Rep. Hakim Jeffries, Arnie Segarra and Mark Green recalled their political skirmishes with the man. Former Police Commissioner William Bratton and former FDNY Fire Commissioner Thomas Van Essen had vivid memories of their time by his side. As for the second concern, getting beaten to the punch, when it premieres this documentary will be the first major filmed account of the full life and career of Mr. Giuliani to reach the public at large. That's pure dumb luck, but it feels good. Finally,my Left/Right team was fortunate to work for and with a brilliant and dedicated group of CNN executives, including Lauren Hollingsworth, Nomi Leidner, Katie Hinman, Greg Greenwald, Lyle Gamm and ultimately Amy Entelis. These folks have had a tumultuous 2022, but they never let it show as they helped guide us through the challenging maze of this biography, and I share their pride and excitement in delivering the result to the world. https://lnkd.in/ecGfQXwF\n\nAfter more than a decade at Left/Right, one of the great New York production houses, I am starting a new chapter as a freelance show-runner, director, creator and writer in documentary. Several projects are brewing out there, and I'll have more to say about them down the line, but I want to focus for a moment on the past twelve years. I booked my first freelance gig at Left/Right in September 2010 on the heels of the Great Recession. Two years later, I joined the staff, and how lucky I was. Anyone who cares about documentary knows that we have been living in an extraordinary moment for this art form. Before I joined the company, I would often hear from older colleagues that I had missed the golden ages of their respective mediums, whether in newspapers, newsweeklies, literary publishing or broadcast news. Not this time. It was my good fortune to join Left/Right as the golden age of documentary began, and I couldn't have asked for better partners. Over the last three years alone, as show-runner and director, I have been able to work with amazing collaborators on rich, complex, compelling documentary series for CNN and Epix. The former work won't air till next year. The latter, Slow Burn and Fiasco, can be found now on Epix. I produced and directed episodes for the New York Times Weekly on FX/Hulu and created shows and pilots for the History Channel and the Cooking Channel, just to give some sense of the range of creative partners that Left/Right afforded me. Thanks to Ken Druckerman, Banks Tarver, Kevin Vargas, Anneka Jones, Jeremy Gould, Greg Littauer, Michelene Starnadori, Matthew Frank and everyone else at this wonderful shop for giving me those opportunities and for building a unique creative community to support them. For those who don't know much about the company's track record, I highly recommend a quick look at their slate below. It's beyond impressive. I leave with immense gratitude, a bit of melancholy and a gut feeling that future collaborations may yet lie ahead."
