        "text": "It has been more than 18 months since my 4-part doc series about former new York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani aired on CNN, so I was surprised and thrilled earlier this summer when it was nominated for two Emmy Awards. Winners will be announced a month from now. Over the year that I worked on it as show runner with a team of extraordinary producer-journalists at New York-based Left/Right, Giuliani made constant headlines, which meant we were faced with multiple possible endings for this epic, but we settled on January 6, 2021, the day of the insurrection that he had helped to legally orchestrate on behalf of former President Donald J. Trump, as our necessary stopping point. The story itself never ended. Two years later, in January 2023, when the documentary aired on CNN, the man once dubbed \"America's Mayor\" by Oprah Winfrey, was still generating headlines, including facing a disciplinary hearing In Washington D.C. over his participation in the events of January 6. Later that year, he would be indicted in Georgia for his role in trying to overturn election results, and by its end, he declared bankruptcy. Earlier this summer, incredibly. he was disbarred from practicing law in the state of New York, where he made his name as a mob-busting U.S. attorney. No matter how many times I read these stories, I haven't been able to banish the memory of what this man once represented to his native city, to the country and ultimately to the world after 9/11. He was never perfect. it was common even during his heyday to hear about his many flaws as a leader. Yet the triumphs and virtues were real. This is the story we elected to tell in the doc series, the power and the glory followed by the chaos and collapse, which is framed by the question almost everyone asked when I told them about my gig. \"What happened to him?\" As the most astonishing American election cycle of modern times continues, the question has lost none of its potency, maybe because it is inseparable from the larger question of what has happened to the country. Giuliani bears primary responsibility for his setbacks, but their context is the upheaval in a political system that coasted for too long on a set of assumptions about the safety and stability of its process. In the end, the satisfying answer to the question about Giuliani may only be written by historians, decades hence, as they try to put together the puzzle of our era. What happened to him will be an adjunct to the question, \"How did we get here?\" In the meantime, of course, there is always the proverbial first draft of history, which is what we attempted with CNN's Giuliani: What Happened To America's Mayor? Thanks to Emmy voters for nominating us for Outstanding Politics and Government Documentary.\n\nWhat's left to say about Adolf Hitler? Three years ago, when I was producing and directing this six-episode documentary series, Hitler: The Lost Tapes of the Third Reich, which premieres at 9 p.m., Monday, April 10, on Nat Geo, that was always the first question. I asked the same thing when I took the job. Despite years of work on the subject of the Third Reich as a print and broadcast journalist, despite living and working in Berlin in the 1990's, fifty years after the end of World War II, despite being a German major in college and speaking fluent German, I had never focused on Hitler. He seemed like more of a fetish and a dead end than a subject for historical inquiry. The truth surprised me. Turns out there's a lot left to say, especially if the audience is American and under forty. Younger generations don't get a detailed history of the Third Reich, by and large, and even the serious historical research about Hitler has come to look sketchy. Generations of scholars tended to discover their own version of the dictator, depending on whether they specialized in art history or child psychology, and the result has been a gallery of Hitlers painted in various colors to reflect his distance from or proximity to the horrors of the Holocaust. Was he an evil wizard, a crime boss, a political mastermind? A kid who got bit on the penis by a goat and never recovered from it? The answers often reflect the sub-cultures that produced the questions and leave Hitler himself in the murk So how does this new documentary try to correct the record? The eyewitnesses tell the story, and even their distortions speak volumes. Most are dead now, of course, but in Hitler: The Lost Tapes of the Third Reich, the voices return. This documentary is built around audio cassette recordings of interviews conducted by the American historian John Toland in the early 1970's. Many close associates, including early financial supporters, founding Nazi Party members, Third Reich big shots, military generals and others were still alive in that era and wanted to tell their stories in such a way that they could salvage their own reputations and legacy by promoting the human side of Hitler. Toland caught lightning in a bottle. In 2019, Left/Right producer Steve Yaccino gained access to Toland's tapes, stored for years at the Library of Congress, Toland's daughter Tamiko gave permission for their use, and CNN green-lit an exclusive and arguably definitive documentary history. Nat Geo is airing it. Long story. Thanks to Molly Raskin, Ann Tyler Moses, Axel Gerdau, Steven Yaccino, Michelene Starnadori, Matthew Frank, Savannah Holte, Ian Kelsey, Timothy Moran, Amy Rockefeller, Gregory Littauer, Greg Greenwald, Lyle Gamm, Katie Hinman, Claire Sinofsky, Philipp Friesenbichler, Victoria Toth, Becky Goldberg, Marlon Singleton, Craig J. Snider, Rishika Advani and so many others who gave us the support we needed to deliver this epic in the heart of the heart of the pandemic.\n\nThis morning, CNN announced its 2023 documentary slate, and I'm extremely proud that our new documentary series \"Giuliani: What Happened To America's Mayor\" will premiere on January 8 with two 1-hour episodes back to back. The second two episodes will air on the following Sunday, January 15. I was privileged as showrunner in a chaotic moment to work with an outstanding team of producers, directors, editors and journalists at CNN and Left/Right. From the beginning, we had to embrace two difficult realities. One, Giuliani would likely never talk to us, no matter how many times and ways we asked, via text, voicemail and through intermediaries. Two, we were not the first out of the gate. We were aware of at least two other productions that began ahead of us and thus seemed likely to air before us, and a third jumped into the fray while we were in production. One of these three turned out to be a musical, and we were not budgeted for a single musical number. We were right about the first concern. Giuliani never responded to a single request. On the other hand, dozens of friends and associates, reporters who covered him and politicians who opposed him, sat down with our team and gave compelling eyewitness accounts. Ken Frydman, Liz Gruber, Charlie Perkins, Frank Luntz and Rick Wilson spoke about their work for Rudy on the campaign trail. Dan Barry, Jennifer Preston, Tish Durkin, Susan Glasser, Michael Tomasky and Dominic Carter remembered what it was like to cover him. Rep. Al Sharpton, Rep. Hakim Jeffries, Arnie Segarra and Mark Green recalled their political skirmishes with the man. Former Police Commissioner William Bratton and former FDNY Fire Commissioner Thomas Van Essen had vivid memories of their time by his side. As for the second concern, getting beaten to the punch, when it premieres this documentary will be the first major filmed account of the full life and career of Mr. Giuliani to reach the public at large. That's pure dumb luck, but it feels good. Finally,my Left/Right team was fortunate to work for and with a brilliant and dedicated group of CNN executives, including Lauren Hollingsworth, Nomi Leidner, Katie Hinman, Greg Greenwald, Lyle Gamm and ultimately Amy Entelis. These folks have had a tumultuous 2022, but they never let it show as they helped guide us through the challenging maze of this biography, and I share their pride and excitement in delivering the result to the world. https://lnkd.in/ecGfQXwF"
