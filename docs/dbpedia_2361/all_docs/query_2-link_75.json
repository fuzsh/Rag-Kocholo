        "text": "Raag & Norton is hosting a monthly traditional blues jam at the Ocean Alehouse in San Francisco. The venue has an amazing new large stage, a great sound system, tons of space, and excellent food and drink. The house band lineup is Hans Raag, guitar and vocals; Justin Norton, diatonic and chromatic harmonica and vocals; Michael Toth, bass and Sean Donoghue, drums. Here is how the jam will run: -The house band plays from 6 to 6:30 p.m. or thereabouts. We then open the jam up for a few hours and then close with special guests when we have them. Since April is our first date, the house band will open and close the show. -Jam lineups will have three songs each (more depending on turnout). Solos should be limited to two choruses per improviser. No 15-minute endless jams. -This is a traditional blues jam. NO loud rock or trying to play material you wrote with your band. Dynamics and volume are paramount. Classic blues grooves and arrangements only. If you don't want to do this, it's not the right jam for you. -This jam will be open to newbies as well as seasoned pros. To ensure success, newer performers will be paired with experienced hands. -Since it is tremendously kind of the venue to host a jam at a time when live music is an afterthought, we are asking everyone who attends to have at least two drinks (and preferably dinner) and to tip the house band. The venue is supporting us, and we need to support them. If we don't, we lose a potentially great place for all of us. We look forward to playing music with all of you.\n\nSECOND full-day festival on SATURDAY, April 13, with some of the region's best blues, wine, and BBQ. We have solo and duo blues performances to open and will close the day with two sets with a full band. The schedule is as follows: 2-2:45 p.m. Mike Billo (solo old-time blues and roots music) 3-3:45 p.m. Raag & Norton: duo guitar and harmonica blues FULL BAND: 4:30-7 p.m. Anna Troy with Up Jumped The Devil (TWO SETS) This all-day event is FREE, although tips for the artists are encouraged. Please come out and spend the day with us, drink some great wine, and have some of the area's best BBQ.\n\nPlease join us for a special DOUBLE HEADLINE edition of the East Bay Blues Showcase featuring singer/songwriter and harmonica virtuoso Michael Rubin and Anna Troy supported by Up Jumped The Devil. MICHAEL RUBIN is a dangerously hilarious singer-songwriter from Austin, Texas. Steeped in the double entendre tradition of blues players Sonny Boy Williamson and Mose Allison, Rubin is unafraid to get stupid and deep, often in the same line. And he can play! Charlie Musselwhite says, \"Michael Rubin sure knows his way around a harmonica. I ain't lyin'!\" RJ Mischo says of his skills, \"Total Mastery.\" Rubin is the unusual harp player who focuses on both diatonic and chromatic.\n\nANNA TROY has been wowing audiences from Oakland to Pacifica with her blazing guitar work and soulful vocals; think Amy Winehouse meets Bonnie Raitt. She spent many years as a gigging musician in Southern California, releasing two self-produced albums and opening for international acts like The Yardbirds, Johnny Winter, and America. As a teenager, she was signed to Elektra Records as part of sister pop duo The Troys. Anna is backed by a band including JUSTIN NORTON (diatonic and chromatic harmonica and vocals) and HANS RAAG (guitar). Reservations are now available via iramarlowe@gmail.com. Admission starts at a $20 sliding scale donation. BYOB as always!\n\nWe are closing out a banner year of the East Bay Blues Showcase with TWO SETS of ANNA TROY & Up Jumped The Devil.
