        "text": "It began many years ago. I met her on the last night of an out-of-town gig. We connected right away, but then I had to fly home.\n\nI couldn’t get her out of my mind; she filled up every corner of my being. So I sat down at the piano and it all came pouring out in a torrent: the love, the leaving, the longing.\n\nIt was in the day when you couldn’t release just one song.\n\nBut all that has changed\n\nNow, thanks to the digital age, the song that demanded to be written can finally be heard.\n\nAvailable to download at Bandcamp.\n\nScott Walker recorded his album at McLear Place in Toronto on December 19th and 20th, 1984.\n\nIn preparing this CD, Scott enlisted the aid of some highly respected artists:\n\n● The arrangements were written by Jerry Toth, a veteran composer/arranger and member of the Boss Brass; and by Berthold Carriere, the Music Director of the Stratford Festival of Canada. They were based on outlines created by Bert and Scott.\n\n● The engineering chores were handled by Phil Sheridan, a veteran producer/engineer, who won the coveted Grammy Award for producing the Boss Brass album All in Good Time.\n\n● A 19-piece Big Band, augmented by a 21-piece string section, has provided a sound unrivaled in Canada. Soloists include some internationally-known Canadian musicians, including Moe Koffman, Peter Appleyard, Ed Bickert and Guido Basso.\n\nBut the proof is in the listening. Click the samples below to hear the results.\n\nThe entire album, plus the individual tracks, are available for download at Bandcamp."
