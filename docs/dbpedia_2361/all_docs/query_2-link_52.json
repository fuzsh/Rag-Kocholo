        "text": "Coordinating with Erin and The Element was so easy. Went over details, got to know us a bit, and threw in little touches from those conversations to make our night even more special. We had a handful of questions come up and Erin was always ready with a quick response for us. Even letting us borrow a mic stand for our ceremony that the venue didn’t have. Erin was so helpful and personal and really set the tone for us.\n\nFor our cocktail hour we asked for a jazz trio set from some of the band and they hit the vibe right on the head. We were taking some photos still and I was worried I’d miss it, but their tunes filled the whole grounds so I could smile and tap my toes without messing up any photos.\n\nFor first dances we found a song we loved for the father daughter dance but nothing stood out for our song nor the mother son song. We sent them a song for each occasion asking if it was something they could pick up and they delivered for both. Not only nailing the songs, but also helping to trim out some of the more depressing lyrics from our mother son song so it hit the points we wanted without killing the mood.\n\nFrom there, the band took it away and there wasn’t a toe in the building that wasn’t at least tapping. Prior to the day we shared their set list with some close friends and family and everyone commented how broad yet deep their playlist went. And day of they tied it all together so well. Every generation in attendance had something to sing and dance to, and EVERYTHING sounded so good.\n\nDJs are nice, but everyone I’ve talked to since the big day is buzzing about the band.\n\nWe hired DJ Cadence for our May wedding and she met every expectation of ours and then some! We knew from our initial call with her that she would be a good fit for us, as her music preferences matched ours well. From that initial call all the way through our wedding day DJ Cadence was professional, communicative, flexible with our needs, and overall fun to work with. She made it very easy on us when it came time to selecting music – she talked through various options with us and also “filled in the blanks” for us when we needed her to. We ended up providing her with a playlist of about 20 songs, and she then curated the most beautiful arrangement for our entire day. It was seamless! Even with a small wedding of about 50, DJ Cadence kept people on the dance floor all night and our guests raved about how great she did. Finally, it was so evident that DJ Cadence truly loves what she does and we so enjoyed her happy presence on our wedding day. Thank you, DJ Cadence! We are so grateful for you and your talents!\n\nWe can’t say enough about our DJ, Eric Smith! He was an absolute rockstar at our wedding, and his contributions were a key element in making our special day truly unforgettable.\n\nFrom the moment the dance floor opened, Eric had everyone on their feet and kept the party going strong all night. His music selection was nothing short of amazing. He seemed to have an uncanny ability to read the crowd and play the perfect songs at just the right moments. The energy in the room was electric, and it was all thanks to Eric’s fantastic music choices and mixing skills.\n\nWhat truly sets Eric apart, though, is his attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile. As the bride, I was juggling so many things throughout the day, and Eric was not just a DJ but a calming presence who helped me with the timeline. He made sure that everything flowed smoothly, from our ceremony to our grand entrance to our first dance and all the way to the last song of the night. His support allowed me to fully enjoy every moment without stress.\n\nIn summary, Eric Smith is not just a wedding DJ; he’s a wedding magician. He has the incredible ability to keep the party alive, set the perfect atmosphere, and support the bride and groom in ways that go beyond his DJ duties. Our wedding was a dream come true, and we have Eric to thank for that. If you’re looking for a DJ who will turn your special day into an unforgettable celebration, look no further than Eric Smith. He’s a true professional and a genuinely great person to work with. We can’t recommend him and CLE Music Group highly enough!\n\nYou don’t need to read this entire review. If you are considering hiring a band for your wedding, hire The Element.\n\nWe had the opportunity to see a handful of different bands to decide which one to go with. While all of them were musically talented, there is not another band in Cleveland that can match the level of fun that The Element provides. They not only played our first dance and parents’ dances to perfection. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say the three hours of music and dancing at the end of the reception were the most fun 3 hours my wife and I have had in our lives.\n\nThe lead singer, Erin, was also the music coordinator we worked with. In addition to being professional, she is the friendliest, most upbeat person we worked with in the entire wedding planning process. We met in person for the first time right before the reception, and it felt like seeing a friend. We knew from working with her and seeing the band in person they would be fantastic, but they were better than anything we could have imagined. Having Erin and Tony both as singers gives them the ability to do both male and female vocals seamlessly.\n\nIf you are going to have a band at your wedding, let me make the decision for you. Your band is The Element.\n\nCMG – Erin in the office was phenomenal to work with! She was available to answer any and all of our questions in a timely manner. She made selecting and finalizing our music and lighting needs for our big day seamless and easy.\n\nNate – Nate was a PHENOMENAL performer! He set the scene for our summer evening outdoor ceremony at the Botanical Garden with his beautiful guitar playing. He also sang/played guitar during our cocktail hour where he had raving reviews from all our guests. He was very professional and easy to work with in the planning process. He helped us select songs for processional/recessional and the cocktail hour and performed the beautiful. He arrived early to set up and run the mic for our officiant as well as his own set up. Nate is a very talented performer and provided the perfect backdrop to our celebration!\n\nJul – DJ Jul was great to work with through the planning process and made us comfortable going into the ceremony. His intake form was easy to fill out and helped us structure our evening and song selections. His setup allowed our guests to text in song requests which was an awesome feature. He did a great job reading the vibe of the party and tailoring the playlist to what our guests were interested in dancing to. We had a slight issue with the mic during the Father of the Bride speech but he was able to make adjustments and fixed the issue for the following two speeches. Overall, he did an awesome job!\n\nThe Sonata Strings played for our daughter’s wedding ceremony and they were wonderful. She chose contemporary music (Make You Feel My Love and Can’t Help Falling in Love) and both instrumentals sounded great. Easy to walk down the aisle to and also very recognizable. Plus very emotional, of course. They played as people arrived, during the processional and recessional – everything was beautiful.\n\nThe Orchestra played for our reception and the band was outstanding. Every song had people on the dance floor and the energy was super high. Especially fun is the surprise (for the guests) when the horn players come out onto the dance floor amid the guests. Someone started a long conga line and it was a riot. Our wedding was a Jewish one and so the traditional circle dance, the Hora, is really important. The Orchestra nailed it and our dancing went on for a long and celebratory time. They knew exactly how to get everyone moving and dancing, and were great about anticipating the bride and groom (and scary but true, the parents) being lifted in chairs while everyone circled around. When they took breaks they had great music ready to go so there was never a quiet moment on the floor (except for slower songs requested by the bride and groom). Our guests commented all night about the “great band” and especially our out-of -town guests were thrilled to learn it was a local band. I would recommend The Orchestra without any reservation!\n\nI strongly believe that music is what really makes a wedding (or any party for that matter) and The Element delivered in every way possible. The dance floor was packed all night and our guests raved about how incredible the music was. Many commented that it was the best wedding they had ever been to and the band was a huge contributing factor. The vocals were incredible, the horns were a great added touch, and the setlist was AWESOME! Erin Rossi, who coordinated with us, was incredible to work with. She’s a great communicator, took time to listen and understand our goals, and build a set list that matched our vibe perfectly. On top of that, she was an awesome emcee that set the tone of the night from the first moment she spoke. We also used Cleveland Music Group for ceremony audio and a photo booth, both of which were handled flawlessly. If you want a vendor that is a wedding expert and will give you peace of mind, and a band that will blow your guests away with a diverse set list and sheer talent, look no further than CMG, Erin Rossi and The Element.\n\nWhen my husband and I were planning our wedding, we wanted our guests to have the best night of their lives where everyone could let loose on the dance floor. That’s exactly what we got from DJ Eric Smith. He instantly got the vibe we were looking for – unexpected bops, disco funk, a little early 2000s alternative, and even “a little bit alexis” from Schitt’s Creek. We appreciated that he mixed the songs, so we were able to pack in a lot of hits and keep the guests interested. My husband and I forgot to eat our own wedding cake because we were having so much fun dancing.\n\nThe best highlight of the night was when Eric teamed up with the photographer, told everyone to gather in a circle, and put on their phone flashlights. We had no idea what was happening. Then, he started playing “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now,” and everyone went wild. We absolutely loved it, and so did our guests.\n\nWe heard from multiple people – guests young and old – that this was the most fun that they had in well over two years. Thank you to Eric for the night of our lives!\n\nBecause we live in California and were planning a Cleveland wedding during the pandemic, nailing down the perfect entertainment for our event was a challenge. We are both super passionate about music, having attended thousands of live shows together over the years, and the music was something we knew we needed to get right for our guests. I mean, having a wedding at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame – spectacular entertainment was expected.\n\nAfter the Rock Hall crew recommended we check out CMG artists and DJs, we immediately gravitated towards DJ Cadence. Once we had the chance to connect with Michelle, we knew she was absolutely the perfect person to curate the music for our event. Not only was working with her extraordinarily easy, getting to know her throughout the process was a pleasure as well. With only two Spotify playlists, a few phone calls and text messages, she was able to put together the perfect instrumental dinner playlist and orchestrate one of the most epic post-dinner dance parties ever. She had every single guest up and dancing, NO ONE LEFT EARLY and, even with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame museum open for browsing, she had everyone on the dance floor getting after it. She read the vibe of the crowd and kept serving up exactly what they were looking for without taking a single request. People were even dancing up and down the escalators on their way to the bathrooms – we have some hilarious videos that we’ll treasure forever.\n\nSeveral guests have already asked for her contact details to book her for their own events and we cannot wait to work with her again in the future. Extremely talented, amazing energy, very professional – cannot recommend DJ Cadence highly enough.\n\nDJ Eric was fantastic and delivered exactly what we wanted for the music. He handled our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception music and we loved all of it. We had a final talk with him a couple of weeks before the wedding about specific songs and the atmosphere we wanted during each portion of the evening. He listened, found the exact versions of songs we wanted, and gave his professional advice. For example, we were not going to do our first dance until later in the evening, but he recommended moving it to the beginning after we were announced and that was the right move! It helped us to have a big moment when everyone was attentive and felt more special. Eric has a laid back style and focuses on the music, he’s not an over-the-top MC. He did special requests and had a good sense for the flow of the music from song to song. Our dance floor was always packed! We had so much fun and so did our guests, several commented on the music specifically! Eric is a great DJ and we highly recommend him!\n\nWe had an exceptional experience with both Eric & Nate and highly recommend both of them!!!\n\nThroughout our planning process DJ Eric Smith was organized, communicative, professional, and easy to talk to. At our reception, he did an amazing job of keeping our dancefloor going late into the night (no one wanted to leave)!!! He also seamlessly managed our reception timeline and didn’t miss anything. We really appreciated that he could manage the crowd, help direct people at important moments, but also wasn’t over-powering or too aggressive with his presence.\n\nEric (maybe Nate too?) set up sound for our outdoor ceremony & reception (everyone said they could hear us, even the people in the back)!! He was even ready & able to help us figure out a last minute iPad zoom streaming setup for our officiant (which fortunately we didn’t end up needing).\n\nNate was also phenomenal as our ceremony musician. He was so easygoing, sweet, reliable and easy to get in touch with. And he is incredibly talented!! He was able to play every single song we wanted, including several that weren’t on his list. His singing & guitar playing impressed all of our guests, and were the absolutely perfect vibe for our ceremony in the woods. Thank you for everything!\n\nDJ Scott Jones played our wedding and quarterbacked the whole day for us. Scott held our hands throughout the planning process and helped us tackle many of the finer details of our wedding day. He helped with everything from coordinating between all of our musicians, laying out our run of show, helping out with our room layout and just general tips and tricks for wedding planning. He also made himself available to chat about any of our concerns, music related or otherwise, almost any day of the week when he wasn’t playing another event. I can say with full confidence we could not have pulled off our wedding day without Scott.\n\nWe had Nate Jones on guitar for our rehearsal dinner and he played an incredible, wide range of music throughout the night and helped us set up sound for speeches. He was amazingly easy to work with and made sure to be fully set up at our venue in a tight timeline with no disruption to our event.\n\nAt our wedding, Ginni Dickson provided the most beautiful music on the harp for our ceremony and Dave Kasper played sax throughout the night, with Ginni during the ceremony and with Scott during the reception. Guests were wowed by this unique combination!\n\nLastly, we booked DJ London Bridges for our after party. He went above and beyond in keeping our party alive and having our guests jumping up and down into the early morning hours!\n\nOverall, I would give CLE an 11/10! Thank you Scott & team for making our weekend so incredibly special.\n\nDue to COVID19, we had many changing plans and shifting around of vendors. Scott Jones was wonderful to work with, and he quickly helped my husband and I get connected with a new DJ after we cut the size of our wedding from 250 to 50 people. Scott connected us with Chris Wallace through the “Best Choice DJ” package.\n\nChris set up a time for us to connect over the phone, and answered all my questions. He had an easy form to fill out that listed our must plays/do not plays, order of events, first dance songs, special songs, etc. Chris was great to work with, and directed me to his Spotify account where I was able to listen to examples of cocktail hour/dinner music, and I was able to get a better understanding of what we would like for our wedding.\n\nHe did a phenomenal job with our wedding, all the formal events and keeping the dance floor rocking (even with such a small group!) We had a wonderful night, and can’t thank Chris/CLE Music Group enough! Thank you a million for helping to make our day so special!\n\nThe Element from start to finish were EVERYTHING we wanted in a wedding band and more. Lead singer Erin and Cleveland Music Group was easy to work with, quick to respond, and made us feel so special from first contact. We were provided with multiple opportunities to see them live before making our decision and Erin even came over when we came to see them just to welcome and congratulate us. The band was also incredibly accommodating giving us a say in what was played and having no ego whatsoever about me (the bride) wanting to perform a few songs with them. As for the talent, it doesn’t get better than The Element. I come from a family of musicians and we are critical and particular- The Element did not disappoint. Erin’s voice is liquid gold and every musician is perfection. The band created the entire amazing vibe for our reception and people never left the dance floor. All of our guests were floored by this band, many saying “best wedding band I’ve ever seen!” I could not agree more. If you’re debating DJ or Band, trust me, hire a band, and make sure it’s The Element! It will be worth it!!\n\nSonata Strings:\n\nThe Sonata Strings did a beautiful job performing at our wedding ceremony. They were very easy to work with and listened to my ideas and gave me suggestions for song selections. My guests were very moved by the music.\n\nThe Orchestra\n\nThe Orchestra had our guests on the dance floor all night long. I work in the music industry so having a great band was key. I was very nervous about choosing one but The Orchestra exceeded my expectations and I would absolutely hire them again!! Dwayne was terrific to work with and answered all of my questions, gave me suggestions for certain songs, and happily took my direction on must have/don’t play songs and helped me plan out our grand entrance and first dance. I really liked how he checked in with me throughout the night before key moments were going to take place so I could ensure our photographer and family were present and ready.\n\nThe band was energetic and fun and wow, the horn section was terrific! The horn section even came down onto the dance floor at one point which our guests are still talking about. I couldn’t have been happier and all of my friends are still talking about how much fun they had dancing. They were OUTSTANDING!!!!!\n\nI can’t express enough how great of a job DJ Evan Foltz did at our wedding this past Saturday. He made the event flow smoothly, communicated with me during the event discreetly, and was patient and gave us extra time when we needed it.\n\nThe music was perfect the whole night, and it was hard for us to find a moment to sit down because we didn’t want to stop dancing. Evan took our suggestions for both the cocktail hour and reception and made a spectacularly tailored playlist. We also loved that he was dancing and getting into the music behind the booth – it really shows just how passionate he is about his work. He was having a good time and made sure everyone else did too.\n\nMost of all, we had heard from many people that our venue, Cleveland City Hall, had poor acoustics because it is a large, open space. However, we didn’t have any trouble hearing anything throughout the entire night. From the ceremony, to the toasts, to the music at the reception, everything sounded great from start to finish.\n\nI don’t have words for how thankful we are for The Element and the Cleveland Music Group. The band made our entire wedding night. I really wanted a wedding with a lot of dancing and we got that, thanks to Erin and The Element. The dance floor was full all night! Every member of the band is so talented and amazing. Choosing The Element was our second best decision (besides getting married 😊). All night long guests were mentioning how great the band was and asking us who they were. Erin is also a great emcee, keeping everyone engaged and helping us immensely in scheduling and coordinating our speeches and introduction. On top of their amazing performance the night of – Erin was an absolute pleasure to work with during the planning process. She was extremely responsive, friendly and competent in all of our communications. We researched and went to performances by other bands during the planning process, but we both knew from the beginning that we wanted The Element. Can’t recommend them more!\n\nAlso, the Sonata String Trio did an unbelievable job during our ceremony and cocktail hour. Their music is absolutely beautiful and they were easy and friendly to work with!\n\nWhen we were planning our wedding we wanted to go with a DJ that was clearly reliable. We found CLE music group at a bridal convention in Cleveland and were impressed with all the positive reviews. Those reviews all proved to be trustworthy. We were immediately impressed with CLE Music Group’s attention to detail, timely communication and willingness to work with us. We met with a few of their DJs and the second we met with Daniel Cormier (DJ DC) we immediately knew he was the guy. He was a professional from the beginning all the way through the reception and was more than willing to meet with us directly over multiple occasions to discuss details for the reception.\n\nBoth my wife and I, as well as every guest at the reception I spoke to was amazed with the quality of our DJ and a number of our friends getting married over the next two years asked for DC DC’s information as well as CLE Music Group’s to look into booking him for their own wedding. Truly not one complaint. I am of the belief that you really should have a DJ you can trust to play solid music and get people dancing without any sort of worry or micromanaging. We gave him song requests given to us in our RSVPS (we had a spot for them to add what they would get up and dance to) and he incorporated many of those songs into the night, as well as leaving out those songs my wife and I knew should be forbidden (chicken dance). He never seemed like he was doing too much or doing too little and even got a number of family members to dance from my side… which is no small feat. We are a hang by the open bar kind of family! I am pleased, impressed, and highly recommend CLE Music Group and DJ DC to anyone considering him for their wedding.\n\nI don’t think there are enough words to describe exactly how much we loved We Are The Radio! Finding a great band was probably the most important item on my checklist and We Are The Radio was even better than I could have imagined. This band is simply amazing! The dance floor was PACKED the entire night! Over a month after our wedding, we’re still getting comments from friends and family about how much fun they had and how incredible We Are The Radio was. The playlist was absolutely perfect. They read the crowd so well and knew exactly what to play to keep everyone dancing all night long. Brandon is a fantastic MC and everyone is so insanely talented. The music was phenomenal! They took the few requests I had, regardless of how silly they were, which really customized the night. I couldn’t have asked for a better time! If I ever need a band for ANYTHING, I know exactly where to look. We Are The Radio has a groupie for life! Thank you all for making our wedding such a blast and absolutely unforgettable!\n\nDJ Eric Smith is amazing!! He is so professional, organized, and just really fun to work with. He took the time to make sure he knew exactly what my husband and I wanted at our wedding reception. He did a great job keeping things on schedule with the toasts, dances, etc. and worked really well with our photographer. We had a couple of last-minute changes, which he handled for us no problem. We got so many compliments on the music and the dance floor – our family and friends had an absolute BLAST which was so important to us! Everyone was dancing – from our 8 year old cousins to our 80 year old grandparents! Eric did a phenomenal job with the music selection, and every single song he chose we loved. On top of that he played all the songs we asked for (including some that we thought might be hard to find), and also played our guests’ requests, which was something we really wanted! My brother recently got engaged, and he and his fiance immediately booked Eric after seeing him in action at our wedding reception. We would highly recommend DJ Eric Smith and the Cleveland Music Group!\n\nI set out to find a DJ that was a blend of being professional and FUN at the same time! I had a large guest count of people who were resistant to dance and people who were looking forward to dancing all night! DJ London Bridges was the perfect fit for this! He was upbeat and friendly when working with the wedding party and making announcements to guests. The moment dancing started, the floor was packed and it remained full all night long. We even ended up extending the length of our night! He mainly used a blend of 90s and now, which was exactly what my friends and I wanted to dance to and I got complements about the DJ during the night and after! He also added a blend of some older songs that created the opportunity for older generation to join the dance floor, but he kept everything moving and fast paced, so it still never slowed down the night. London Bridges is talented and fun!\n\nWhile planning, London Bridges was available for questions via phone, accepted my playlist ideas via email, and even met with me in person close to the wedding day to finalize plans. I had a lot of ideas about interactive things I wanted to do with the bridal party and even a prank, and London Bridges was totally on board with the things I wanted to try! One thing I planned was having a group of friends sing our favorite Karaoke song and in videos that came out after, London Bridges is singing along in the background with us! That right there shows you how fun he is and appears to love what he does! Lastly, London Bridges always spoke positively and upbeat about the day while we were planning. This lead me to feel like I wasn’t annoying (haha) which was my fear when I had so many questions and details to plan! Go with CLE Music Group!!\n\nThe number one thing that can make or break a wedding is the deejay. When it came to entertainment, there are only two companies in NE Ohio that I recommend, so we started with CMG. The entire staff at CMG is amazing- Scott Jones is the best in the biz and each professional that works for him reflects the same values and professionalism. Office staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nWe planned our wedding in under 8 months, so the deejays I was familiar with were booked already. We chose our deejay off recommendation and his video- DJ Dan Cormier. We love Dan! He set up a meeting to chat about our details form and go over some of our questions. We were one of those couples who annoyingly created their own play list, but he was so awesome about it. He had a lot of ideas on how to incorporate some of our choices into the day and made sure he helped create exactly the wedding we wanted. He asked me to leave a voice mail 2 weeks prior with the pronunciation of our wedding party names which I thought was awesome.\n\nHere’s an example of why this was a perfect choice for us:\n\nDan knew that we wanted a packed dance floor all night. We also wanted to do a sparkler send off, but was afraid we’d lose guests too early, so we decided to invite just the wedding party and parents for the send off. Hubby and I were waiting in the hallway to go outside and I hear the Macarena playing inside. Immediately I went ‘What the hell? For SURE the Macarena wasn’t on our music list!’ It only took a second for me to realize what he was doing- DJ DC knows that the Macarena (or any other line dance) will keep people on the dance floor PLUS he avoided playing one of ‘our’ songs because he knew we’d miss it. Obviously, this is quick thinking and why you get what you pay for- a true professional!\n\nOur dance floor was packed until they kicked us out. SO much that the dance floor was actually bouncing. DJ DC kept our party rockin and accommodated any changes we threw at him. Somehow, he managed to squeeze in most of the songs from our playlist. It was the perfect night and we couldn’t thank Dan enough for providing us with great entertainment.\n\nThat being said- I know we picked out entire playlist. But there is a HUGE difference between ‘just pay for Spotify and let it play on a laptop’ and an experienced deejay emceeing your evening. Trust your wedding to someone who knows what they’re doing.\n\nWe and our guests LOVED The Element! We had several guests comment both during and after the reception about how great the band was and wanting to know how we’d found them. Before dinner was even served, my mom approached me to tell me how much she loved the band – and they were only in their dinner music set!\n\nErin Rossi was amazing to work with – before we’d even booked them, we expressed interest in seeing them play live, and Erin reached out by email to encourage us to see them at an upcoming show at Brothers Lounge. We did, and loved them right away. Erin was friendly and engaging and chatted with us during one of their breaks. Not only that, there were at least two other couples there who had had The Element at their wedding and came out to see them play again.\n\nThen as the wedding date approached, we met with Erin and immediately knew our reception was in great hands. She was detail-oriented, asked a lot of great questions, and really tried to get a sense of just what kind of party we wanted to have for our wedding reception.\n\nAnd then she and the band delivered! Neither my husband and I, nor many of our guests, had much of a voice the next morning, because we’d been singing along all night to the band. You know you have a great band when the dance floor stays full, even during the breaks, when the ipod sets are playing – and our dance floor never emptied! Erin gets the crowd engaged – stepping onto the dance floor herself to encourage everyone’s involvement…she even pulled our two nephews onto the stage so they could show off their dance moves!\n\nThe Element far exceeded all of our expectations, and we highly recommend them!\n\nWe were amazed by DJ Brent. He was friendly, professional, and just an all around nice guy. But let’s get down to the music. I gave Brent very little direction in our meeting before the wedding of what exactly to play or not play; this is what he does for a living and he knows what works, I trusted him. We got compliments all night on our DJ, people kept coming up to us and telling us, as we were dancing, how amazing our DJ was. Not only did Brent play songs that everyone loved, but the order in which he played the songs was perfect! The whole night flowed well, and we are still having people tell us 3 weeks later how amazing the DJ was and how much fun they had. My wish for the reception was I wanted people on the dance floor the entire night, and DJ Brent definitely made it happen! I will recommend Cleveland Music Group and DJ Brent to anyone I know getting married. Hands down, best choice we could have made!\n\nThe groom wrote the following and I agree with all he said:\n\n“There is really only one word to describe these guys, amazing! We would 100% hire them again (and again and again). Do yourself a favor and hire them. Let me add the caveat that we do not know the band personally so this isn’t a review from someone’s family member. We learned about them when looking at bands online. Here are some specifics. The Cleveland Keys Trio:\n\n*Showed up several hours early to get set up to make sure there weren’t issues (helpful on stressful wedding days).\n\n*Were friendly, courteous, etc. the whole time.\n\n*Got a whole group of older guests (70+) onto the dance floor (no easy feat).\n\n*Took open requests for songs–this is pretty amazing as how many bands can play anything.\n\n*Allowed several drunken guests to attempt to sing (and helped them along with the vocals).\n\n*Gladly let a guest play guitar with them (the guest was good at guitar but still most bands would be annoyed having a guest join in).\n\nWe requested a song they didn’t know and they learned it on their break and played it after — it sounded great. We didn’t hear anything but positive comments from guests. What more can you ask for. On a scale of 1 to 10 these guys were an 11. Hire them.”\n\nDJ Eric Smith was great from the beginning. We had a consultation with him before our wedding to ensure we had the music we wanted but also so we were all on the same page for the flow of the big day. Eric helped us stay on time throughout the entirety of the event and when we wanted to change a few things at the last minute he was more than accommodating. We appreciated that Eric understood our style and sense of music, which was shown throughout our event. He helped keep everyone on the dance floor and even helped us cater to our Italian and Puerto Rican relatives who wanted more traditional music. Eric also did a FANTASTIC job keeping up the energy moving from cocktail hour to the reception by way of the introductions of our bridal party. He made everyone laugh AND feel special! Lastly, Eric was able to find our ceremony music and perfectly blended each song together to help make our ceremony flow nicely. We are so happy with his performance and would recommend him to anyone looking for a DJ for any type of event. Thanks, Eric!\n\nWeddings are a lot of work. From choosing flowers to linens, cake to food, dress to suit and DJ to Photographer, it is a lot of work and can be very frustrating trying to find the perfect fit…we found that fit with DJ Scott Jones.\n\nBefore meeting with Scott I sent out many emails to not only him but also a handful of others. Scott always immediately answered my emails and all of my questions. I asked so many questions that I was worried he may be getting annoyed but I never got that feeling based on how quickly and professionally he answered all of them. Once our interviews began we met with four different companies, Cleveland Music Group being the last.\n\nThe first three we met with we were just not very happy with and it seemed like they wanted to make our wedding something we did not want it to be. When we met with Scott he was super laid back and listened to us. He never interrupted, he never pushed his own agenda, he was truly there to make us feel comfortable, and comfortable we felt. We knew Scott was the guy for us. One thing I’ll never forget is when he told us that the music speaks for itself. What he meant by that was it is not hard to go up and play music and keep people entertained. What he stood proud of was his ability as an MC. I have been to plenty of weddings where the formalities seemed to drag on, or after cocktail hour trying to get guests sat back down can seem like an impossible feat. But not for Scott. He had total room control, and was able to get our guests’ attention and get them where they needed to be. He did everything we asked and then some. The night was perfect…except when my bride realized we did not have the garter. Scott was able to adapt. We moved things around and the sequence of events actually worked out better and I’m not so sure they would have without his help.\n\nI would recommend Scott to anyone and I told him that after the reception. My wife and I were lucky enough to have found such wonderful people to help us with our wedding. I was able to ask Scott questions that had absolutely nothing to do with the music and he answered them with expert knowledge. I used him as my wedding planner in some aspects.\n\nWhat my wife and I realized was Scott was the professional and we were rookies. We let him do his job without any interference and it was amazing. To all of the future Mr. and Mrs. out there, choose Cleveland Music Group and if he is available choose Scott. If he is not available, I’m sure everyone else would be just as good due to the fact that Scott is the president of the company and I’m sure he hires only the best. To all of the “bridezillas” out there, choose this company and rest assured that your “Zilla” can be aimed somewhere else because they will not disappoint you. Thank you again to everyone at the Cleveland Music Group and Scott for making our day so perfect.\n\nThere aren’t enough superlatives to describe how amazing The Avenue band is, and it’s hard to give them due praise without sounding cliche or corny. But if you like to dance and want your guests on the dance floor all night long having an amazing time, you HAVE to hire this band! Every time I see people who attended, the first thing they tell me is how much fun they had at our wedding and how amazing the band was. We had a wide range of guests, as most weddings do, and those that love to dance talked about how awesome it was that the dance floor was full the entire night, and those that don’t usually dance told me how great it was to let loose and that they haven’t danced that much or that much in a while. I’ve been to (and in) a lot of weddings, and while most entertainment is good to great…this band is simply exceptional. I was so impressed, and yes, I know I’m biased, but still…\n\nWe had 300+ attendees, and once the dancing started, no one went back to their seats (this was told to me by a number of people, including some of the wait staff from the evening who were shocked at how much people were dancing and how good a time everyone was having). They were so good that when I got back to work after our honeymoon, I was told we hired this band for our spring fundraiser simply because of how awesome they were at our wedding!\n\nYou simply can’t go wrong hiring this band. It’s one decision you will never regret.\n\nThis band is large, so rightfully so it’s a bit on the pricey side, and I was hesitant at first because it was more than we had planned to spend. It was worth EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY. No joke. If you love music and want it to be a focal point for your wedding, I cannot suggest this band enough.\n\nFurthermore, Tiffany (the band leader) is as nice and professional as they come. Always responsive and reliable, she took great care to ensure the night went exactly how we envisioned, all the names were pronounced correctly during introductions (and we had some tough ones), everything was timely and seemingly effortless…she adhered to every small detail and made sure we considered things we would never have thought of in the first place.\n\nWe Are The Radio was absolutely amazing. We knew while looking for bands that we would be paying about double what a DJ would cost and we were a little nervous about cost. They were definitely worth it and we would do the exact same thing over again. Everyone thought the band was great! We received many compliments – guests were saying it was one of the best weddings they have ever been to, and I know We Are The Radio had a lot to do with that. Brandon does a great job interacting with the guests and keeping everyone entertained. He made the experience very personal – which is something you don’t get from DJs. One of my bridesmaids who is getting married next year tried to book them but they are, unfortunately, already booked for her date! I cannot praise them enough. It was truly an unforgettable day. They rocked it!\n\nBooking them was also a breeze. Tony was very responsive to my emails – no matter how many questions I had. He went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.\n\nMy husband and I were lucky enough to have The Bearded DJ, Eric Smith, DJ our amazing wedding. He was such a pleasure to work with, and to be honest, one of our favorite vendors! Eric really listened to us when meeting before the wedding and was able to match the music to our wants, as well as the crowd wants on the day of! We were especially impressed when Eric ended the night with a song that my husband and I had briefly talked about that meant a lot to us! The dance floor was always completely full (people were actually dancing next to the dance floor because there was not enough room!) and Eric did a great job interacting with the crowd! We received so many compliments on how great Eric and the music was, with some friends saying it was the best “party” they had ever been to. I would highly recommend him and look forward to seeing him at our friends wedding in a few weeks! Thank you Eric! You helped me our day perfect!\n\nWe booked The Avenue from CLE Music Group for our wedding. Other than getting married, this was perhaps the best decision we made. Everyone from the owner, Scott and all the staff is top notch and very responsive. This was not the case when I looked into other choices for other bands. We felt honored to have what we think is the best and most polished band in Cleveland for our wedding. The play a great set list and know how to keep the floor packed. Their sound engineering is so dialed in, you feel like you’re at house of blues. This doesn’t even begin to mention the talent of the singers and instrumentalists; they are all amazing and true professionals.\n\nI almost majored in music, so music is very important to me and I’m very discerning and picky. I looked at all the options and it was down to the Avenue and another similarly sized band that was slightly less expensive. That other group sounded good at their showcase, but when I researched and spoke to a few of them, I realized they are not really a group. It’s merely an agent of sorts that books these independent musicians for shows. Music is about rapport and anticipation, it frightened me to think our wedding band could have been thrown together with musicians that played together a handful of times or maybe never. With the Avenue (and the entire CLE group) you know what you are getting and can rest easy.\n\nAdditionally, as I researched, I found out that there were all sort of upgrades that made the less expensive group slightly more expensive. For example, if you want good sound quality, you need to upgrade your sound package to better speakers. To me this added a lot of additional stress and things to keep track of that add to the list of things you worry about when planning your wedding. Do your research and you only have one option, the Avenue. There are so many things you need to do for your wedding, this was one thing where we were able to fully remove this stress from the planning knowing the band would deliver and did they. We had the unfortunate event of a guest having a stroke at the reception (they are ok). But the Avenue was so professional and when they came on were able to turn the mood around and ensure everyone had fun for the rest of the evening. Everyone was raving about how fantastic the band was and they’ve never heard anything like it at a wedding. Thank you so much guys, you made our reception!\n\nFirst I would like to say what a joy it was to work with Cleveland Music Group. From the first phone call to the last it was a wonderful process. I worked with Tony Howard and he helped me choose the band based on my budget. He would always call me back or have a staff member call me back whenever I had a question. The payment process was easy and the contracts were easy to read and detailed. There was nothing hidden.\n\nNow to the band. I cannot tell you enough about Sunrise Jones. My daughter communicated with the band more than I did on song selection and reception details that day. She always had positive things to say about the e-mail conversations over the year. At the wedding reception I must have had 100 guests say to me the band was amazing. The dance floor was packed all night. No one wanted the wedding to end at midnight. Our sales contact at Bon Appetit (the caterer at the venue) called me a couple days later and asked where I got the band. She said she hears a lot of bands and Sunrise Jones was going on her list of bands to recommend. She said not only was the music excellent but they were very professional and nice. I know it will be a wedding to remember because of this band! Thank You Sunrise Jones!\n\nWe could not recommend CMG and We Are the Radio with more enthusiasm. We had originally booked with another entertainment company, but after we pointed out to them that they had double booked us, we were back to the drawing board to find a band for our wedding. Within 24 hours of us catching the mistake, we were all set with CMG. They took our needs and wants under close consideration and we were fatefully matched with WATR. We could not have had a better night – from our first dance, which WATR specially arranged just for us, to the party they kept going all night, it was the best night of our lives in huge part to them. All the songs we requested were played, and people came up to us all night with rave reviews. There were more people left on the dance floor at the end of the night than I’ve ever seen at the end of any wedding. Our goal was to throw the most fun dance party every thrown, and the goal was not only achieved, but exceeded. We could not thank you enough!\n\nDJ Smoov was hands down one of the best additions to our wedding day! When we first set out in search for a DJ, we wanted someone who would let the music do the work – DJ Smoov delivered on that promise, and then some! He was concise on the mic and masterful on the table. We never in a million years would have expected guests of all age ranges to come up to us during our wedding and comment on how great our DJ was, but that is exactly what happened. He listened to the style of music we wanted to play, then used his expertise to set the tone for the night.\n\nFor an unbiased perspective, our wedding videographer is from Dayton and travels all around the world doing weddings, he made a point to come up to us during the wedding and tell us how hard DJ Smoov was working up there mixing live – And how he had never seen a wedding DJ mix the way Smoov was non-stop all night long. He loved him! That’s saying something! Oh – And he made a SWEET video after the wedding and posted it on social media. Just another reason why Smoov is the best! Thanks again for everything you did to make our night amazing!\n\nThese guys don’t need any additional positive reviews, as I’m pretty sure they are already booked every weekend through 2019. Yes, they are that freaking good. However, I feel compelled to tell our experience with Tricky Dick & The Cover Ups. Not only do these guys completely rock it out on the stage, but they are as classy and professional as they are rockers. From the very first communication with these guys, I was nothing short of impressed with the responsiveness and guidance they provided me and my wife throughout the wedding planning process. I mean, these guys have a range that is completely unheard of. Not every day do you get to see a band that can play Boogie Shoes all the way to Shut Up and Dance. I had people high-fiving me at my wedding saying they have never had so much fun dancing and singing along at a reception. To take it a step further, Tony Howard is an absolute phenomenal MC and basically ran our entire wedding post ceremony. Oh and by the way, we were married in a vineyard and had no idea how to get sound for our officiant. At the last minute Tony figured it out for us and the ceremony went on without a hitch. Overall, these guys are just awesome and the music was fantastic. If you want your wedding to be remembered forever, you should probably hire these guys. Thank you guys again for making our wedding day so special.\n\nOur reception party is still being talked about as “THE best party of the year,” all in credit to the talent of DJ Brent from Cleveland Music Group. From day one the professionalism DJ Brent took with helping bring life to our vision to his expertise in choosing the perfect array of songs to keep our dance floor packed all night long, he did an amazing job start to finish. We had guests on the dance floor who haven’t danced in YEARS!!! The bars closed down and at the end of the night there were still 100 people plus left on the dance floor calling for encores! We are beyond grateful for DJ Brent and the once in a lifetime reception he provided for us and for the joy he brought to our guests. Seeing a packed dance floor and the smiles on our families and friends faces was the best wedding gift we could have ever received. Many of our guests are already asking for DJ Brent’s contact information to book him for their upcoming events and we never hesitate to forward a positive recommendation on. Thank you DJ Brent for giving us the best party we’ve ever been to!!\n\nThis company was by far one of the most PROFESSIONAL to work with of all the vendors we hired for our special day. From beginning to end, we truly felt like we were in good hands not only picking Cleveland Music Group, but specifically DJ DC (aka Dan Cormier). We were VERY picky about the DJ for our event. We had been to weddings where, let’s just say you realize how important the DJ is at the end of the day.\n\nSince we were planning our wedding from across the country, it was a challenge to find the right fit for us. We just didn’t have the time or luxury of interviewing countless DJs before our wedding day. We really appreciated that Cleveland Music Group is hip with the times—showcasing each DJ they have to offer with personalized individual webpages, complete with a highlight video for each DJ to give you an idea of their personality, style, and approach. EXTREMELY helpful. Did not find this sort of info on other DJ sites.\n\nAs soon as we met Dan in person, we were sold. His outstanding voice, laid back personality, and can-do attitude instantly put us at ease. He understood our needs without much explanation at all. He was the first DJ we met with, and we booked him immediately! The day of our wedding was amazing. He accommodated all of our requests—much more work on his end—and was easily able to adapt to any last minute changes during the course of the evening. He kept us up to speed on where the night was headed—knew exactly what to anticipate when—and adjusted things accordingly. He clearly knew what he was doing and always kept things professional. We got sooo many compliments from friends and family how great the music was. The dance floor was packed all night long. Can’t imagine our reception without DJ DC! Thank you!!\n\nChoosing a DJ was one of the most daunting tasks for us as we were planning our wedding. We are the first of our friends and family in the Cleveland area to plan a wedding, so we did not have any recommendations to start with. We knew that a DJ could make or break a wedding, so choosing the “right one” was very important to us. From the beginning of working with Scott, we knew that he would help make our wedding day go smoothly and put all of our worries to rest. He was not only very kind and very easy to talk to, but he acted as a mini wedding planner as he helped us plan out the flow of our reception. He took a lot of time to meet with us and chat about what we wanted to night to be like, and even worked with us to choose the perfect uplight color.\n\nWe had a last minute change to speeches + a few song choices, and Scott responded instantly, reassuring that everything would work out perfectly. Scott Jones literally was the perfect addition to our wedding reception. Before the event even started, he helped adjust the uplighting in the ceremony space, even though it was another vendor who set it up. He made the space look absolutely breathtaking, without even having to ask! this is a true testament of how much Scott cares about his clients and their happiness on their wedding day. I can’t thank him enough for doing this! As for the actual reception, he helped make it flow effortlessly, and helped us move along with ease. He helped guide us on what we should be doing next (i.e. after we ate, he told us to start going around to tables, and then told us when it was time to sit back down for toasts, etc.). He choose songs that pleased ALL people at the reception that got everyone up and dancing. We couldn’t believe some of the moves that our older guests were showing off!!\n\nMany of our guests who attended the wedding commented on how great Scott was. My dad (who is a hard man to please!), commented on how awesome Scott was and how if people were not having a good time – that is was their own fault as Scott set the tone for an incredible night. Scott is the type of person that makes you want to have another wedding all over again just so that you can have the chance to work with him and experience him in action. A huge thank you to Scott and the rest of the Cleveland Music Group for helping make our wedding absolutely perfect. We hope to work with you again in the future, and will certainly be telling all of our friends about you!!!\n\nI was very happy with the work that Jose did for us as our wedding DJ. He put a lot of effort into making all of our guests feel welcome and included – both the Spanish speakers and English speakers. His announcements were done in English and Spanish, and he played music that both sides of the family loved. He did a great job of feeling the ‘vibe’ of the party, keeping everyone dancing the whole evening. He was very kind and professional, and I didn’t have to worry about a thing- he ran the reception wonderfully based on what we discussed at our pre-event meeting. He was also very flexible! I emailed him all sorts of changes in the final days before the wedding and he was very patient and accommodating. Many guests commented to me about how great our DJ was, and my photographer (who has seen thousands of weddings) even mentioned that he was very impressed with the work that Mr. Cedeno did at the reception. I am so very pleased with ‘DJ Big Daddy,’ and I would definitely recommend him to friends! Thank you so much for making this part of my wedding so easy and successful!"
