        "meta_description": "Although there is a large body of scholarly literature on musical copyright, very little of this work explores in a sustained and direct way the role of copyright in regulating musical memory. This paper conceptualizes sound recording as a mnemonic technology and analyzes the manner in which copyright law attempts to manage the impact of this technology on legal concepts of musical memory and authorial subjectivity. The paper analyzes the case law on “cryptomnesia” or unconscious plagiarism in the United States and Canada wherein defendants claimed not to have access to the original work and therefore could not have copied it. These contested similarities highlight the dispersion of memory and creativity across a heterogeneous network that includes composers, musicians, and producers but also institutions and machines, and leads to the present difficulty of recentering the authorial subject in legal discourses and practices. In this way, late twentieth century legal disputes over unconscious plagiarism anticipate contemporary anxieties about the entanglement of creative and consumer subjectivities with digital techniques in recent litigation campaigns against mash-up remixing, peer-to-peer file sharing, and other popular practices of online music reproduction. Then as now, copyright acts as a site for disciplining and normalising certain modes of listening to and remembering sound recordings which in turn help smooth over tensions in the field of capitalist music (re)production.",

        "text": "1Introduced into musical copyright discourse in the early twentieth century, the notion of cryptomnesia or unconscious plagiarism highlights a key tension in copyright law. On the one hand, copyright acts as a recognizing authority for claims to authorship and originality, thus providing economic incentives to authors whose work is “original,” which in turn encourages cultural innovation. On the other hand, copyright facilitates ownership and control of cultural works by institutions rather than by authors, since its minimal notion of “originality” and extended period of protection encourage the production and exploitation of increasingly similar works. This tension reaches a breaking point in cases where two individuals claim sole authorship of what jurists and musicological experts deem to be the “same” work. These contested similarities highlight the dispersion of perceptual, signifying, mnemonic, and creative processes across an expansive and heterogeneous network that includes not only composers, musicians, and producers, but also institutions and machines, thus leading to the present difficulty of recentering the authorial subject in legal discourses and practices.\n\nMusical memory and the construction of the author\n\n5It would be difficult to conceptualize authors as the owners of discourse without construing memory as a type of cognitive “container technology,” enabling the subject to store and possess objects apprehended through experience before expressing them in “works of authorship.” In this particular figuration, memory contains musical experiences along with other experiences of the social world. However, as I will demonstrate in my analysis of the case law on musical plagiarism, copyright also presumes that memory organizes these experiences and facilitates the monitoring of their sources during the creative process. In this sense, the normalisation of individual and organisational dispositions towards musical discourse as property in copyright depends on the responsibilisation of authors for monitoring and policing divisions between their practices of listening, remembering, and making. According to copyright law, “normal” musical memory maintains sharp boundaries between self / other, experience / expression, and recollection / composition, which prevent the misrecognition of musical experiences as one’s own inventions.\n\n7To explain unintentional or unremembered plagiarism, courts often present the plagiarist’s memory as indiscriminate in its accumulation of traces and autonomous in the manner in which it re-presents those traces to consciousness; memory contains permanent records of all experiences and operates independently of the subject’s conscious mind. The figuration of the plagiarist’s memory helps to resolve authorial disputes by attributing the production of strikingly similar works to the composers’ memory, the leaky boundaries of which allow recollections of the works of others to seep into the creative process. But the introduction of unconscious recollection and unwitting plagiarism can also draw attention to a set of conceptual tensions and displacements. First, memory as a container for experiences is displaced by the unsettling notion of “being possessed” by an overly-active unconscious memory that intervenes in musical composition (and presumably other thought processes as well). Second, the demand for originality, which is an evidentiary requirement for a successful copyright infringement lawsuit, in some cases generates anxiety that all works that resembles one’s own work are strikingly similar and are therefore illegitimate copies.\n\nWhether he unconsciously copied the figure, he cannot say, and does not try to. Everything registers somewhere in our memories, and no one can tell what may evoke it. On the whole, my belief is that, in composing the accompaniment to the refrain of “Kalua,” Mr. Kern must have followed, probably unconsciously, what he had certainly often heard only a short time before. I cannot really see how else to account for a similarity, which amounts to identity. So to hold I need not reject his testimony that he was unaware of such a borrowing.\n\n9Since the court found that Kern was exposed to the plaintiff’s work, the “identical” elements in their compositions could not be coincidental, or the results of what jurists now call “independent creation.” Judge Hand offered a version of the accumulative subject who possesses, but is also in some sense possessed by, a memory that contains a register of everything, including those experiences which the subject cannot recall.\n\n10References to this figuration of memory as a kind of incessant recording system that sends memories of musical experience to consciousness in the guise of original musical expressions have become increasingly common in legal commentary and in contemporary legal decisions. I will discuss the problems that this figuration of memory poses for the agency of the creative subject in my analysis of the case law on unconscious musical plagiarism. But first I will address key questions about the relationship between figurations of memory and the regulation of copying which emerge even in apparently intentional or conscious instances of musical plagiarism: how do the institutional practices of copyright law and musicological expertise affect the manner in which “private” memory is translated into “public” forms of testimony, recollection and interpretation? And if memory is potentially disruptive of copyright law, how do jurists and courts “domesticate” memory or make it less threatening to copyright’s regulatory framework and to its key conceptual personage—the author-as-owner?\n\nMusical memory and material evidence of plagiarism\n\nTo succeed in such an action a plaintiff must show the following: (1) that he has a copyright in the musical work, (2) that it is an original work, and (3) that the defendant unfairly copied it, that is, he had access to the plaintiff's work before composing his own, and that a substantial part of both works is very similar.\n\n13René Grignon successfully sued Jean-Alain Roussel for infringing upon his copyright in “Chanson numéro 7,” which Grignon initially claimed he composed in August 1987 and later distributed, in Judge Denault’s words, “to certain librettists and people in the artistic world in Montréal, hoping that a song would be eventually made from it” (§ 2). A song was eventually made from musical score with lyrics written by Luc Plamondon, but the composition was attributed to someone else. “Tous les Juke-Box,” sung by Martine St-Clair, was released in March 1988 and the cover indicated that Jean-Alain Roussel was its composer. Given that Grignon was successful in his action against Roussel, it is worth noting that at each of the three steps—proving ownership, originality, and misappropriation—Grignon’s private memory and the discourses and technologies of representation through which private memory is publicly communicated begin to drift apart.\n\n14To prove ownership of the work, authors must demonstrate that the expression was communicated in “fixed form;” these material traces then become important for proving that the defendant had or likely had access to the work. To this end, Grignon opened a sealed envelop in court, which he had mailed to himself in February 1987. The envelope contained a cassette recording of a song along with a letter bearing Grignon’s signature asserting that he had written the song, entitled “Luc,” in November 1986. In Judge Denault’s words, Grignon was “clearly surprised by the unexpected title given to his work and its date of composition” (§ 12). This gap between memory and material evidence was quickly smoothed over by Grignon’s explanation that he had originally intended the song for Céline Dion but after sending the song to Dion’s producer, who never replied, Grignon changed the song’s title to “Luc” since he had a new singer for the song in mind, Luc Plamondon, who confirmed that he had received a cassette copy from Grignon. Since Grignon had mentioned all of these copies and persons to whom he had sent them in his prior testimony, the court did not doubt the validity of his explanation.\n\n15In an attempt to undermine the originality of “Chanson Numéro 7 / Luc”, counsel for Roussel called upon expert witnesses who compared it with fourteen other songs to show that Grignon’s composition was “not new.” However, Judge Denault criticized counsel for the defendant for neglecting the question of whether or not Grignon had access to, or remembered hearing, any of these apparently similar compositions: “It is important to note that apart from ‘Born to run,’ no effort was made to have René Grignon identify any of these melodies or to determine whether he knew of them or had already heard them” (§ 19). Although the court dismissed these demonstrations of similarity, it is characteristic of such cases that the composer’s work, when subjected to this kind of scrutiny, reveals the manner in which recollection and composition are much more closely intertwined than copyright’s ideal of independent creation would suggest.\n\n16In their assessments of the degree of similarity between Grignon’s and Roussel’s songs, the expert witnesses provided just the sort of analysis that Judge Denault seemed to be seeking. Judge Denault was most impressed by Jacques Faubert, a musicologist who concluded his “painstaking analysis” with an “overall assessment of 24.5 out of 29, or 84.5%, representing the degree of similarity between the two refrains which he had analysed” (§ 36-7). Nevertheless, following Harold Fox’s rule, set out in The Canadian Law of Copyright and Industrial Designs in 1967, that similarities be determined “by the ear as well as by the eye,” Judge Denault asserted that “in the final analysis, it is for the judge—so much the better if he has a musical ear and knowledge—to decide whether according to his own assessment, experience and judgment an impression of similarity is created by the disputed musical works” (§ 37). Although Judge Denault claimed that “tests of hearing” are “subjective,” he was confident that he would be able to discern “objective” aural similarities through repeated auditions of the sound recordings during the court proceedings. Judge Denault’s remarks about “tests of hearing” are surprising, since they suggest that copyright law in Canada may occasionally privilege listening over looking to reconstruct the “objective” sequence of events that resulted in “striking similarities”:\n\nWriting imposes natural limits on the reproduction of what is perceived on hearing a musical work; it is not possible to accurately reproduce by words the impression made on the ear by hearing alternately the first measures of the refrain of these two works: it is striking. In the case at bar, I have no hesitation in concluding that in melodic, harmonic and rhythmic terms, the first eight measures of “Chanson Numéro 7” and “Tous les juke-box” have such a striking resemblance that one can only be a copy of the other, with minor differences resulting from arrangements or substitution chords. I also consider that this resemblance applies to a significant part of the work, not in quantitative but in qualitative terms, in that it concerns the first measures of the refrain which are the “hook” that the ear retains for the purpose of identifying a piece. (§ 39)\n\n17Although Roussel claimed that he wrote “Tous les juke-box” independently, Judge Denault found that the similarities were so striking that they could only be the result of either a very unusual coincidence or plagiarism. Since Grignon was able to show that Roussel had the opportunity to hear “Chanson numéro 7 / Luc,” Roussel and his witnesses’ “vague” testimonies were supplanted by material traces of striking similarity between the two songs which the court interpreted as the cause-and-effect relationship of plagiarism.\n\n18From Dillingham to Grignon, courts shift between different sets of criteria in their assessments of misappropriation or plagiarism. In the former case, the composer’s interest in maintaining his reputation cast doubt on the plaintiff’s accusation of deliberate plagiarism. In Grignon, the audience’s memory and the marketing and mnemonic functions of hooks were considered to be key factors in determining whether one composer had copied another. Each court uses different characteristics of the composer, the audience, or the work to reinstate the bounded subject in the context of multiple and fluid connections between the self and the social world of music production.\n\n19The concept of plagiarism, even in an apparently straightforward (or “flagrant”) case like that of Grignon, is based on certain normative presumptions about communication. As Ron Scollon argues,\n\n21Scollon insightfully points out that charges of plagiarism often reproduce a particular view of the subject of communication as the owner of his or her discourse. However, this type of possessive subjectivity is also based on a figuration of human memory as fallible. Juxtaposed with the court’s “objective” reconstructions of a person’s actions and the trajectories of recordings in the social world, memories articulated in court can be made to seem unreliable, distorted or selective. In plagiarism cases, humanly embodied memory is often characterized as vulnerable to the plagiarist’s ambition and to his or her misplaced sense of entitlement. Indeed, as I argue in the next section, the desire to be an author-owner in accordance with evidentiary requirements of copyright law may encourage composers to perceive similarities between strands of musical discourse as “striking” similarities (that is, as unlawful copies).\n\nBetween plagiarism and authorship\n\n24Copyright law’s demand for originality generates an excessive desire to be recognized as the point of origin of the work. The legal system manages this excess in some cases by exposing the person’s memory as contaminated or distorted by ambition, and by correcting distorted memories according to the “objective” reality disclosed by recordings and other material traces of action. Caught in an untenable position between authorship and plagiarism, the composer may attempt to make material traces conform to his or her memory. Gondos is perhaps the best example of this process at work in Canadian case law.\n\n27As the court tried to establish the facts of the case, Gondos’ memory seemed to be increasingly inconsistent with the sequence of events as reconstructed by expert witnesses and technologies of representation. Gondos was not able to convince the court that a photocopy of the “Variations” score represented his work. Whereas Gondos claimed he gave this photocopy to one of his students “years ago, 1965 or so, I don’t know,” expert witnesses pointed out that the “signs of reproduction,” including track marks on the paper as well as the size of the paper, matched Xerox machines available in 1974-5, but not in 1965 (Gondos, § 8 and 13). Gondos also claimed that he made his recording of “Variations” in August 1974, before he heard “The Homecoming” in a version of the Salada commercial that featured a church. This version of the commercial, however, was not aired after July of that year. Gondos’ memory of his own actions did not seem to correspond to the circulation of recordings and other media he had submitted as evidence, that is, the photocopy given to his piano student, the audio recording of “Variations” that was missing the variation from which Hardy and Toth had allegedly copied, the dates that particular Salada commercials were broadcasted on television, Gondos’ submission to BMI of an array of works in 1965 which also omitted “Variations”, and the musicological opinion that his four page folio of “Variations” contained “the work of another person” (Gondos, § 23).\n\n28Counsel for the two defendants asked the judge to dismiss the case due to these inconsistencies. As Judge Carruthers wrote in his decision: “In their final analyses of why all claims and contentions of the plaintiff in this action should be rejected, counsel for all the defendants submit that little, if any, credibility be attached to the evidence of the plaintiff as it bears on the issues raised in this action” (§ 28). Judge Carruthers agreed, pointing to Gondos himself as the “worst offender” among all the witnesses “who were caught up in the promotion of the plaintiff’s case to such an extent that they lost much of any objectivity they might otherwise have about the matters in issue” (§ 29). The decision portrays Gondos and his supporters as blinded by their desire to help Gondos prove that his work had been plagiarized. At the same time, however, it is clear that something motivated Gondos and his supporters which, in my view, cannot be reduced to monetary gain. The similarities between Gondos’, Hardy’s, and Toth’s works were perhaps “striking” to Gondos and his supporters, who had heard Gondos’ work first, and it did not seem possible to them that this resemblance was coincidental. Counsel for Gondos later attempted to convince the court that there was a causal relationship between the works resulting from unconscious plagiarism on the part of Hardy and Toth. After hearing several experts on this matter, and after referring to several cases where the possibility of unconscious plagiarism had been raised, Judge Carruthers maintained that the similarities were coincidental and did not stem from the same source.\n\n29As I argue in the next section, assumptions about memory are more visible or legible in cases of cryptomnesia than in “flagrant” cases of plagiarism. Cryptomnesia highlights the problem of maintaining a sharp division between mind and matter through copyright’s idea / expression dichotomy. More importantly, the figure of the author as a victim of cryptomnesia highlights the manner in which copyright confronts the notion that artistic production frequently involves “copying from memory” and that, rather than consisting of impressions or ideas arranged, recalled and narrated in a manner that is unique to the individual, memory may be rather more machine-like in its indiscriminate accumulation and transmission of “registered” experiences. Thus, the case law on cryptomnesia is a particularly useful domain in which copyright’s domestication of potentially disruptive interrelationships between memory, technology, and consciousness can be explored.\n\nFigurations of memory in the discourse of cryptomnesia\n\n30Given its role in managing innovation, creative labour, and the disruptive potential of technologies of reproduction, many scholars have correctly suggested that copyright is an ideological apparatus that primarily serves the interests of large copyright owners. Yet, cases of unconscious plagiarism or cryptomnesia are highly suggestive of the manner in which copyright law may also act as a quasi-therapeutic regime of memory by acknowledging the loss of integrity or personality that arguably follows from the misrecognition of memory as invention. The court plays the role of a recognizing authority by acknowledging that in cases of inadvertent plagiarism both the defendant and plaintiff have lost something integral to the self, or will lose something that is integral to the self (albeit, through misrecognition) as a result of the decision.\n\nWhat happened? I conclude that the composer, in seeking musical materials to clothe his thoughts, was working with various possibilities. As he tried this possibility and that, there came to the surface of his mind a particular combination that pleased him as being one he felt would be appealing to a prospective listener; in other words, that this combination of sounds would work. Why? Because his subconscious knew it already had worked in a song his conscious mind did not remember. Having arrived at this pleasing combination of sounds, the recording was made, the lead sheet prepared for copyright and the song became an enormous success. Did Harrison deliberately use the music of He’s So Fine? I do not believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, it is clear that My Sweet Lord is the very same song as He’s So Fine with different words, and Harrison had access to He’s So Fine. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.\n\n32Lawyers for musicians facing charges of plagiarism frequently refer judges to Harrisongs, and in particular to Judge Owen’s admission that cryptomnesia was not only possible but that it was the most plausible explanation for striking similarity in that case. Judge Owen’s decision has forced judges in Canada and the US to at least form an opinion about the notion of cryptomnesia and has spawned a substantial body of literature in legal studies and psychology about cryptomnesia and its implications for copyright.\n\n34While there are conflicting views regarding the time that may elapse between “access” and the unconscious “reproduction of old memory,” jurists seem to increasingly agree with the general principle outlined by Judge Hand in 1924, that “everything registers somewhere in our memories, and no one can tell what may evoke it.” Moreover, the case law suggests that this figuration of memory as a container for everything that has been experienced leads to uncertainty about the independence of the compositional process: no one can tell when an object of memory will be evoked in the creative process.\n\n36Canadian courts have been more reluctant to introduce this figuration of unconscious memory as actively disguising traces of “pleasing combinations of sounds” as inventions, although this concept of memory is cited, as was the case in Gondos, when either the plaintiff or the defendant refers the judge to cases like Harrisongs. When the defendant or the plaintiff in a case of musical copyright infringement admits that he or she may have plagiarized the plaintiff’s work, but has done so unconsciously, the court is confronted with the possibility that memories may be misrecognized as one’s own creations. However, American and Canadian courts stop short of admitting that the blurry relations between self / other, memory / invention, and embodied versus representational memory may be a part of the “normal” process of musical production.\n\n38In seeking a more nuanced assessment of similarity, copying, damages, and remedies, legal scholars suggest that copyright infringement cases should be informed by an examination, in as much detail as possible, of the contexts of production. The implication is that the court should pay closer attention to changes in context in order to determine whether two works are in fact the same rather than inferring causal relations between original and the alleged copy from note-by-note comparison. As Aaron Keyt argues,\n\n39In order to determine whether there has been a change in context and thus in the meaning of a work, Keyt suggests that courts should modify their historiographic practices and carry out an analysis of the works with an ear toward both musical and contextual considerations.\n\nConclusion: Copyright in a bind\n\n41While copyright is often associated with the regulation of reproduction as a means to encourage creativity, the confrontation of courts with claims of cryptomnesia in the context of infringement lawsuits highlights the manner in which copyright also imposes a disciplinary framework on listening and memory. While judges may occasionally empathize with defendants who misrecognize non-conscious recollection of musical experience as creative expression, and while courts may recognize that the technologies and practices of musical production and consumption are often entwined in the contemporary milieu of creative labour, in the end, creativity is separated from the broad spectrum of possible modes of engaging with sound and what might be called an attributional or “source monitoring” mode of perceptual, signifying, representational, and reproductive processes is normalised. Moreover, the implication of the legal discourse of cryptomnesia, which is constructed as an aberration rather than as a normal part of creativity, is that the creative subject becomes responsibilised or made responsible for managing the legal and financial risks stemming from his or her entanglement in a nexus of print, electronic and digital technologies that allow sounds to be split from their sources.\n\n43Although unconscious plagiarism is not yet an acceptable defense for infringement, there is an underlying therapeutic role that the court assumes in recognizing the loss of one’s self or expression thereof, usually in the discourse of economic losses and damages. Notwithstanding the fact that copyright is in an important sense an economic regime, not all doctrines, principles, rules, and tests in copyright law can be reduced to the goal of efficiency and other utilitarian justifications for copyright protection. Through a modified version of Jung’s concept of cryptomnesia, Canadian and American courts uphold the values of uniqueness and originality while simultaneously reinforcing a system of music production characterized by standardization, and protect the abstract personage of the author while simultaneously parceling out his / her / its rights to various entities. The unruliness of memory and, in particular, its disregard for propriety boundaries, can potentially undermine the sharp division between ideas and expressions. But copyright law continues to govern musical memory not only by constraining the manner in which people access the musical past, but also by requiring human memory to be as precise, fixed, and “objective” as representational technologies and expert reconstructions of musical events.\n\n44The emergence of cryptomnesia in copyright courts might also be understood as articulation of anxiety about the mediatization of music and the attendant shifts in embodied experience, habits of perception and remembering, and systems of signification and representation. In a similar way as more recent developments such as mash-up culture give rise to debates about the locus of creativity in an era of software that can “listen” and “play” for or with human users, cases of cryptomnesia foreground the problems of defining a creative role that is “properly” human in the late twentieth century music-making milieu characterized by industrial logics of managing risk in music production and increasingly automated tools for creating music. The integrity of human memory and creativity are put into question when the court’s attention is drawn to the growing intimacy of humans and machines in the production, reproduction, perception and recollection of sound and music. Cryptomnesia highlights the problem of disembedding authorial subjects from radio, photocopiers, phonographs, and other media that exploit the aural overlaps between machinic and human memory. Cryptomnesia helps “explain away” substantial similarity but also amplifies the tension between the court’s role in discursively reinforcing a model of human creativity based on notions of aesthetic originality while also underwriting the industrial production of interchangeable musical works. The tension between copyright’s role as a recognizing institution for authorial subjectivity and its facilitating role in the production of, for example, jingles for television commercials is particularly legible in cases of cryptomnesia, but that same tension can be found in the discourse around computer or algorithmic creativity, where the same tools that are used by large copyright owners (and universities) to automate the process of identifying plagiarized works can in turn be used to create new literary texts, visual works and musical compositions. The cautious and selective manner in which jurists mobilize the notion of cryptomnesia in musical copyright disputes points to the manner in which cryptomnesia has the potential to exacerbate rather than smooth over tensions in copyright law stemming from the dispersion of listening, remembering, and creating across networks of disseminated composers, musicians, institutions, and machines."
