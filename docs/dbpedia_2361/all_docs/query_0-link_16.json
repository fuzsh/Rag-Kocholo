At the height of its popularity, the daily show was reported to have generated one million fan letters a week. Clark relinquished his “Bandstand” hosting duties in 1989 to 26-year-old David Hirsch, but the program died within months. Still, its 37-year run is a record for a television variety show.\n\nIn 1968, “The Temptations” performed for the first time following the departure of baritone singer David Ruffin.
