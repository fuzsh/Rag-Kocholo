Online - Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business - UTC/GMT +1, +2, Central European Time (C.E.T)

I use various media apps, written as well as audio/visual material which allow me to explore up-to-date topics, aimed at specific student interests groups, e.g. oil, legal professionals, I.T. etc. These can be adapted to suit learner level. In addition I use a teaching platform which covers the various language skills for all levels. Free introduction class available.

I alternate during a teaching session between devices (Mac and i-pad) enabling me to display different teaching tools/ apps better suited to one or the other device. This allows for a more immersive learning experience. Classroom results have been positive and the feedback as well. Prior teaching material has also been scanned into my HD, and covers industry specific topics -Banking & Finance, Real Estate, Oil, Legal, Tech & Auto etc. - as well as skills - presentations, conferencing, intercultural etc. I also teach toward specific exams - BEC currently.

I have found the experience very productive, in fact much more than I initially thought it would be as it offers a lot of scope and satisfaction, plus is time flexible.
