The video should be fun, unique and show what OpenStreetMap means to you.\n\n2. Explain why we should choose you to be at State of the Map 2011!\n\n3. Normal necessities and niceties:\n\nNo vulgar language\n\nNo nudity\n\nNo animal cruelty\n\n4. Video must have CC, CC-BY or CC-BY-SA licensing\n\n5.

They may have started communicating among themselves, and made plans and scoped out the process for their local district. But, the community is nowhere near critical mass, and they need the inspiration and support to take OSM to the next level.\n\nNominations should be sent to scholarship@stateofthemap.org. For each nomination, include the mappers name, OSM user name, email address, location, and a paragraph or two on why they’d be great to have at SOTM. Self nominations are accepted.\n\nThe nomination period is open until June 25th and the number of scholarships rewarded will be based on the success of fund-raising. You can also be part of the “Sponsor-a-Mapper“ program, to help fund deserving mappers to attend State of the Map."
