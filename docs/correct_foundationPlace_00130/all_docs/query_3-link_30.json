Logos INRIX has two logos for use by its customers and partners. The INRIX corporate logo and the INRIX TRAFFIC logo are principal visual elements of the INRIX brand. The appropriate usage of these distinct logos is described below. Logo Graphic INRIX Corporate Logo INRIX TRAFFIC Logo Proper Usage For use by INRIX customers and partners selectively on industry <strong>com</strong>munications regarding their <strong>com</strong>pany partnership with INRIX. Mobile App Usage Logo Configuration Minimum Logo Size Logo Placement The INRIX corporate logo is made up of type overlaying a blue background gradient with four white lines. Minimum size is 1 inch across for printed materials and 72 pixels wide for digital use. May not be less prominent than the most prominent third-party logo/trademark appearing in the same area. For use by INRIX customers and partners in the application user interface and <strong>com</strong>munications referencing customer products and services using INRIX Traffic solutions. For display on the mobile application startup screen The INRIX TRAFFIC logo is always represented as a blue rectangle en<strong>com</strong>passing INRIX with TRAFFIC below in reverse white text. Minimum size is 72 pixels wide for digital use and 1 inch across for printed materials. May not be less prominent than the most prominent third-party logo/trademark appearing in the same area. The INRIX corporate logo and INRIX TRAFFIC logo have been carefully designed to reflect the brand personality of INRIX and must appear as shown in all customer and partner materials, including but not limited to mobile applications, Web, advertising materials, collateral/sales materials, packaging, promotional materials and public relations assets. The logos must stand alone, may not be <strong>com</strong>bined with any other graphic elements, and must appear in their original form with sufficient clear space surrounding them. They may not be less prominent than the most prominent third-party logo/trademark appearing in the same area."
