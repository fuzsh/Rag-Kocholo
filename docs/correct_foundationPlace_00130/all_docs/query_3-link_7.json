        "text": "UPDATED!! Navigon’s newest version of its GPS app for the iPhone now adds a direct connection to Facebook and Twitter from within the app.\n\nNavigon’s turn-by-turn app lets users broadcast their current location and expected time of arrival to Twitter and Facebook without an interruption in navigating. Users also get a panoramic 3D overview of the landscape ahead integrated into the navigation maps and users see 3D views of terrain.\n\nThe app, called MobileNavigator, shows users up to three choices of possible routes and gives the estimated time of arrival for each route. Navigon claims its iPhone app is the only GPS app that includes Google Local Search and seamless in-app iPod controls as well as the new Twitter and Facebook in-app links.\n\nMobileNavigator has a recently lowered price of $69.99 until Feb. 15. It is currently ranked as the fifth most popular paid GPS app on the Apple App Store. TomTom’s turn-by-turn app at $59.99 is ranked in the number eight slot.\n\nNavigon is also now allowing developers to launch its turn-by-turn app from within other apps. It just made available an AppInteract open app interface for iPhone application developers. This allows an app such as a restaurant guide to include directions to the restaurants via Navigon’s MobileNavigator, for example.\n\nSource: Navigon"
