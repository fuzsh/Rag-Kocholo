        "text": "At AXSOL, we jointly develop power systems for various fields of application – from stationary battery storage systems like our Energy Container Solutions to mobile battery storage systems for professional use of the “ARVEY” product line. For “ARVEY”, we were already awarded the Federal Prize for Outstanding Innovative Performance in 2016. We also received an award from Aerospace & Defense Review in 2021 and are now among the top 10 defense tech solution providers in Europe. In 2023, we were also recognized as a Top 10 Battery Storage Solutions Provider in Europe by Energy Tech Review for Energy Container Solutions.\n\nWe are a dynamic, highly motivated team of all ages, convinced that we can make the world a little better. As necessary with any dynamic company, we all pitch in together wherever we need to and apply our strengths where they have the most impact. Together, we reflect, discuss, design, produce and place our products internationally from our location in Würzburg – with a lot of heart and soul and the claim to develop really good solutions.\n\nThe energy supply of the future must not only be economical, but also sustainable, flexible, modular, and at the same time reliable and durable. Only through well thought-out overall concepts and systems will we be able to improve energy systems worldwide.\n\nOur founder Jürgen Zinecker studied business administration and surveying engineering and has founded and accompanied several successful companies in the past.\n\nHe is convinced that the availability of sustainable and affordable energy is the basis for economic growth and progress.\n\nFor him battery storage is the key technology on the way to energy transition and decarbonization.\n\nWith AXSOL’s battery storage solutions he pursues a holistic approach and wants to make self-generated energy accessible to everyone, always and everywhere, from generation and storage to intelligent consumption."
