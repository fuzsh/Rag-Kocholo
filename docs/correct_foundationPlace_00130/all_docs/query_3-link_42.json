However, all are rated 4-Stars or higher. Some may have only Apple or Android versions, most have both. Note that the text is taken from the designers' online descriptions, and is not endorsed by Greenbelt.\n\nMany Apps are free, but some Apps may require in-app purchases to make them fully functional.\n\nSome may require an internet connection (while you are deep in the woods), others may not.\n\nIf we’re missing an App that you would like to recommend to the Greenbelt community, please email Alexandra Letizia: alexandra@ecga.org.
