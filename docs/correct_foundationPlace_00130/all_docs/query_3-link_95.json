Traffic Requires Broad Input Sources • 500+ commercial, consumer and government sources • Nearly 100 million connected drivers, throughout the day • Tens of billions of useful data points per month\n\n18. Traffic Requires Context Incidents Road Closures The “Why” of Flow Constant Tracking Traffic Fusion Traffic Cameras Engine Thousands of Feeds Community 100,000+ Reporters/mo Traffic Flow Speeds & Congestion Events All Event >5,000\n\n19.
