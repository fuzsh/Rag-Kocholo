        "text": "If you know me, you know that at my core I LOVE helping people. It doesn't matter if it's one individual, a community, or organization. If it involves people \"count me in.\" I do this because I truly believe it's my purpose while here on earth (Along with sharing hugs üòÅ). Earlier this week, it was confirmed that I will be the recipient of the 2023 Presidential Award from Sisters Working It Out, a grassroots organization dedicated to eliminating breast cancer disparities. They execute on their mission daily, by working to support women across Chicagoland in facilitating access to early detection and treatment services. They don't stop there; they educate and empower women across the cancer care continuum from diagnosis to survivorship. They are the type of organization that makes you roll up your sleeves and get to work. When I learned of this honor, I was rather emotional. I was emotional because I will receive this award on my late husband's birthday. When I decided I wanted to return to non-profit work he was there to support me. He understood what I meant when I said I needed the work I do to have meaning, purpose. The only thing I desire is for the dedication, passion and love that I have for people to shine through. I want them to know that I'm not just present because my job requires it; I'm present because I know the power of collective strength and communities across the country have amazing strength and resilience that often goes unnoticed. I've been in this relay with communities for several years and \"I'm not tired yet.\" I look forward to continuing to partner with SWIO and other amazing organizations across Chicago and in other communities to dismantle barriers that hinder the opportunity for all to pursue optimal health (through their definition of optimal). My sleeves are rolled up, as a matter of fact, I have ripped the sleeves off and now rock a \"muscle shirt.\" Thank you SWIO for this honor and please know that it's not lost on me. If you are in the Chicagoland area, I invite you to join me for what I know will be an AWESOME night. As you can see from the flier below, I get to spend the evening with some true GEMS, who are making a difference. This will be a night I know I won't forget, and neither will you!!! P.S. Dr. Sheri Prentiss is the MC for the evening...... I'm so excited (yes, I am singing the Pointer Sisters)"
