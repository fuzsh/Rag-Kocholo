Vintage French WW2 banknote (5-Francs) issued by the Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AM) in 1944 for use during the Allied-occupation of France in the wake of the Battle of Normandy. Nicknamed the "flag ticket" franc (French: Billet drapeau), the reverse of the note shows the French flag with the words "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite". After the take-over of sovereignty by General Charles de Gaulle, it rapidly faded out of use in favour of the pre-war French franc.
