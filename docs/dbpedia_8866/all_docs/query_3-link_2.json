        "text": "Allied powers, coalition of countries that opposed the Axis powers (led by Germany, Italy, and Japan) during World War II. The principal members of the Allies were the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China (the “Big Four”), as well as France while it was unoccupied. The Allies also included every other signatory to the Declaration by United Nations (January 1, 1942): Australia, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, South Africa, and Yugoslavia. Later wartime signers were Mexico, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Iraq, Brazil, Bolivia, Iran, Colombia, Liberia, France, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Paraguay, Venezuela, Uruguay, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon.\n\nThe Allies began as an agreement between Poland, the United Kingdom, and France that the latter two would come to Poland’s aid if it were invaded by Germany. When Germany did attack on September 1, 1939, the United Kingdom and France fulfilled their promise, declaring war against Germany on September 3. The independent British dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa followed the United Kingdom’s lead, declaring war either that same day or a few days later.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nDenmark and Norway joined the Allies the next year when Germany invaded both countries on April 9, 1940. So too did the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) that May, once Germany repeated its World War I strategy of moving its forces through those countries to invade France. All these new partnerships were short-lived, however, as Germany swiftly conquered each country. The same sequence of events would play out again in southeastern Europe: Greece and Yugoslavia joined the Allies on October 28, 1940, and April 6, 1941, respectively, but were soon occupied. With France surrendering on June 22, 1940, the United Kingdom and its former colonies were effectively the only Allies in action for over a year, from mid-1940 to mid-1941.\n\nIt was on June 22, 1941, that the British received an unexpected gift: the German invasion of the Soviet Union. This attack resulted in an Anglo-Soviet treaty on July 12, 1941—and unlike the smaller nations that had been so quickly overrun by the German war machine, the Soviet Union was capable of not only surviving its initial ambush but also helping the Allied cause beyond its own borders (e.g., invading Iran to ensure that its oil could not be used to fuel Axis vehicles). With support from the American lend-lease program, the Soviet Union became a nightmare for the German military. Eventually, its forces would push the Germans all the way back to Berlin.\n\nOn December 7 (December 8 in Asia), 1941, Japan attacked American, British, and Dutch military bases in the Pacific, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. For reasons still debated today, Germany declared war on the United States as well, on December 11. Where once the United States had participated in the war only as a source of arms and other supplies for the Allies—serving as what Pres. Franklin. D. Roosevelt memorably called “an arsenal of democracy”—these aggressions brought it fully into the Allied fold.\n\nThe attacks were perhaps the Axis powers’ greatest mistake. As in World War I, U.S. production capacity dwarfed that of any other country with which it was allied or fought. By the end of the war, the U.S. would produce almost two-thirds of all the Allies’ military equipment. The U.S. also had the population to contribute a large number of troops, mobilizing over 16 million—more than any other Allied power save the Soviet Union. Where the U.S. went, much of the Western Hemisphere followed. Countries that immediately declared war on members of the Axis powers in the wake of Japan’s attack included Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, and Panama. Brazil joined on August 22, 1942, Mexico on May 22, 1942. Bolivia became an official member as well on April 7, 1943, but its government was overthrown in a coup shortly thereafter."
