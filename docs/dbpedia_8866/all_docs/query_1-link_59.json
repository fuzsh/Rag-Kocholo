Nicknamed the \"flag ticket\" franc (French: Billet drapeau), the reverse of the note shows the French flag with the words \"Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite\". After the take-over of sovereignty by General Charles de Gaulle, it rapidly faded out of use in favour of the pre-war French franc.\n\nThis image can't be licensed for personal use (e.g. personal prints).\n\nTaxes may apply to prices shown."
