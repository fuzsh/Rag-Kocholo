Applicants sum up their allegations contained in paragraphs 16\n\nto 32 of Chapter V of the Memorials, as follows:\n\n\"By a deliherate,systematic and consistent course of conduct, the\n\nMandatory lias discriminated against the 'Native' population of\n\nSoutli West Africain agriculture. In so doing, it has not only failed\n\nto proinote to the utmost the well-being of the 'Native' population\n\nengaged in agriculture, but in major respects it has reduced the\n\ndegree of their well-being. It has not only failed to promote to the\n\nutmost the social progress of the 'Native' population engaged in\n\nagriculture, but has reversed possibilities of social progress into a\n\nsteady regrcssion. it has not only failed to promote to the utmost the\n\ndevelopment of agriculture for the 'Native' population of therd-\n\ntory, but it has reversed that development into a process of de-\n\nterioration and increasing insecurity, more particularly:\n\n(i) The hfandatoryhas progressively reduced the proportion of farm\n\nland available for cultivatioii or pastoral use by the 'Native'\n\npopulation, while it has progressively iiicreased the proportion of\n\nsucli farm land available to 'Europeans'. This has been carried\n\nto tlie point where less thrz pet cent. of the population, being\n\n'White', enjoys the use of some 45 per cent. of the total land\n\narea;wliile over88 percent. of the population, being 'Native'\n\nor 'Coloured'. is confined t27 pet cent. Much of the remaining\n\nland area isdesert.\n\n(ii) The hlandatory has denied the possibilities of individual owner-\n\nship of land to the 'Native' population, and has confined these\n\nrights to the 'White' population.\n\n(iii) The Mandntory lias limited tlie role of the 'Native' population in\n\nagriculture to (a) subsistence farming within 'Native' reserves\n\nand (b) employment as common laborers or domestics on 'Euro-\n\npean' commercialfarms. In consequence, the 'Native' population\n\nhas enjoyed almost insignificant participation in the expanding\n\npossibilities of commercial agriculture in the Territory.\n\n(iv) The Mandatory has offered little hope to the 'Native' popu-\n\nlation, and little promise or possibility of future development.\n\n(v) Even in connection with emereencv relief made available in\n\ntiincof rlrought. tlic .\\lniidator~~~~t~u!edov~:ni.liettie lar-\n\ngcr part of rclicf fiinds for the asiiît:rnceof rhesmnll'Eiiropean' COUNTER-MEMORIALOF SOUTH AFRICA 3\n\nproportionof ttit.~~opulation,\\r.liiltherelief fund$u~edtoIiely tla\n\nlarge 'Kative' po-ii-.ition Iiave bcrn coiifinc<lto a comparative\n\npittance 1.\"\n\nFor convenience, Respondent will deal separately with agricultural\n\nconditions in the areas outside the Police Zone,and those inside. CHAPTER II\n\nAGRICULTUREIN THE AREAS OUTSIDETHE POLICEZONE\n\nI. On tlie assumption of tlie Mandate, the traditional tribal economies\n\nin the northern areas were virtuallv iinaffected bv contact witli the\n\nmodern excliange economy. In common with subsistence economies\n\nthroughout tlie continent of Africa, specialization (escept within the\n\nfamily) was to al1intents and purposes unknown, and each kraal was a\n\nself-sufficient economic unit, producing enougli for al1 the requirements\n\nofitsinhabitants. Contacts which had existed with tlieeschange economy\n\nIiad been of limited extent and duration, such as the employment of\n\nOvnmbo migrant labourers in the Tsumeb mines and the Luderitzbucht\n\ndiamond fields ', and had consequently not affected the traditional tribal\n\ninstitutions to any appreciable degree.\n\n2. At the inception of tlie Mandate, Respondent's policy in regard to\n\neconomic, and, in particular, agricultural, activity in the areas outside\n\ntlie Police Zone could conc~~vablo have taken the form of o~enine UD\n\ntlicsc ;iit.:ito the 1orrt.s of tlie modern exchange cconomy.

COUNTER-MEMORIAL OF SOUTH AFRlCA 5\n\na riculture, the only method by which Respondent could, in the absence\n\nofany desire on the part of the local tribes to change their tribal svstem,\n\nhave-rapidly introdüced the exchange system inti the northern-areas,\n\nwould have been by a process of settlement of European farmers, either\n\nby purchasing the necessary land from the tribes concerned, or dis-\n\npossessing them in some other way. Whereas this course would no doubt\n\nhave led to an improvement in the quantity and quality of agricultural\n\nproduction in the area, it would at the same time have caused an erosion\n\nof the traditional political and social systems of its inhabitants. The only\n\nbenefit to the Native peopleswould have been the availability of employ-\n\nment. And. if no restriction were placed on the acquisition of land or the\n\nreduced to a landless people, entirely dependent for a living on wage-\n\nearning, with a resultant destruction of their customary social, political\n\nand religious institutions and restraints. To a considerable extent this\n\nwas the position in the Police Zone at the inception of the Mandate, and\n\nthe undesirable consequences thereof were obvious.\n\nprevious paragraph, it was, in Respondent's opinion, from every pointthe\n\nof view. desirable to maintain the traditional tribal institutions in the\n\nareas where they were still functioning, and to promote further develop\n\nment on that basis. Although this policy necessarily entailed that econo-\n\nmicdevelopment (inthesenseof an increasedtotalagriculturalproduction)\n\nwould be slow ',it was considered that such an approach would be most\n\nconducive to the happiness and security of the population. As landless\n\nlabourers, the inhabitants ofthe northern areas might conceivably have\n\neamed total annual wages which were higher than the value of their\n\nagricultural production as subsistencefarmers.There can be no question.\n\nhowever. that the ado~tion of a ~olicv resultine in such a situation\n\nwoiild have been to thcir moral ancisociil <letriin<nr.And opportunitics\n\nfor wage-earning \\rfcrccreatcd for the iriliabitanti of the nurthcrn ;~r<as\n\nas a result of the vigorous expansion of the exchange economy in the\n\nPolice Zone.\n\n4. Reference had been made 2 to the attitude ofthe Permanent Man-\n\ndates Commission that tribal institutions should, where possible, be\n\npreserved. Further examples of this attitude will he given below '. It is\n\nsubmitted that Respondent's policy of preserving the traditional insti-\n\ntutionsofthe inhabitants of the northern areas, of which possession of\n\nland by the various tribes formed an essential element, was a wise one.\n\nand it was recognized as such by the Permanent Mandates Commission.\n\nThe merits of the general systern of administration in the northern\n\nareas were also considered in 1946by Lord Hailey. He said (in so far as\n\nhis evaluation is relevant to the economic and socialsituation) :\n\n\"That the present s~stem is acceptable to the people there can be\n\nno question. They have not failed to give open expression of the!r\n\ncontentment with it,and there can be no reason to doubt that thi5 1s\n\nthe spontaneous ex ression of a genuine feeling. If questioned. they\n\nattribute their satislction tothefact that they areruledby theirown\n\n1 Vide Book IV. Chap. IV.paras. 32-34,\n\nIbid.. Chap. IV, par40.\n\nVide BookVI. Chap.

A policy designed to protect the inhabitants of the northem areas\n\nin their possessionof their lands, could only be beneficialto them.\n\nAs far as land resources are concemed, the areas beyond the Police\n\nZone (and,in particular, Ovamboland, the Okavango territory and the\n\nEastern Caprivi) are situated in the most favoured part of the Territory.\n\nIt will be recalled that the most favoured climatic region, from the point\n\nof view of dry-land cropping. stock faming and timber exploitation.\n\nas well as potential for irrigation, falls entirely within parts of Ovambo-\n\nland and the Okavango territory, and covers the whole of the Eastern\n\nCaprivi =.The rest of Ovamboland (wiih the exception of a portion to the\n\nextreme westl and the Okavaneo territorv fall within an area which is\n\nalso a fa\\,ourible oiie ascompn;ed with the rest of tliz l'erritory lie\n\nniain concentrations of population are found in the former rtgion. the\n\narea borderinr: on tlie Police Zoiie beinr-uninhabited. exceot . .sibl\\, ,t ~ ~\n\ntimes by isolaied groups of Bushmen.\n\n6. Respondent's policy in regard to the agricultural development of\n\nthe northern areas has been to euide the ~ooulation in the direction of ~ ~ ~\n\ngreatcr producti\\.ity by meaiis of%firadun1adjPtarion of their traditional\n\neconomic aiid social institutions. rather tlian by means of revolution;irv\n\nchanges. Attention has bpen given in various Gays to the improvemeit\n\nin the quality of livestock. At first well-bred bulls were donated to the\n\nfunds. This scheme did not Drove a success. and selective breedine wasl\n\n~ ~\n\ntherefore sul,stituted. The l&ter scheine lias produced betrer resultîY\n\nto increnje vields. Suitable <:rotvarieties are tcsted. and selected seedsare\n\nmade available to the inhabicants. At Runtu a démonstration plot pro-\n\nduced a \"muhango\" (millet) variety which yielded considerably more\n\nstration plotsparëibeing developed in order to supply suffiCientseed, as the\n\nimproved variety is proving popular with the Native farmers.\n\n7. The prevalence of lung-sickness (bovine pleuro-pneumonia) has in\n\nthe past militated against tlie export of livestock from the northern\n\ntemtories. Measures have been taken by the agricultural division of the\n\nSouth West African Administration in collaboration with the South\n\nAfrican Department of Technical Services (Veterinary Services) to\n\ncombat this. as well as other animal diseases in these areas. Thus, for\n\nexample, al1the cattle in the Kaokoveld have been inoculated annually\n\nagainst lung-sickness since 1955 and in Ovamboland since 1957 '.Other\n\nsporadic outbreaks of diseases, such as anthrax and quarter evil, have\n\n' Lord Hailey, A Suruey of Noiiuc Aflaivsin Soulh Wcrf Alricn(1946) [unpub-\n\nlished]. p. rig.\n\nVideBookIV.

In 1956 the\n\nSouth African veterinaw division successfullv combated an outbreak of\n\nfoot-and-mouth disease fn the Eastern capri&. Foot-and-mouth disease\n\nbroke out in 1958 in Ovamboland: al1animals were inoculated, and the\n\nsoread of the cfiseasewas checked. In the same vear trv~anosomiasis aiid\n\nanthrax caused cattle deathsin the Caprivi, and:veter<iary serviceswere\n\nprovided with good results. In 1960 and 1961, foot-and-mouth disease\n\nagain broke out in the Territory, and veterinary treatment was again\n\nprovided.\n\nFor the purposes of combating stock diçeases in three of the northetn\n\nareas (viz.,Ovamboland, the Okavango territory and the Kaokovelb),\n\nBantu assistant stock inspectors have been appointed with the intention\n\nof training them so that they will eventually be able to take over full\n\nresponsibility for this work. In the meantime they are under the supûr-\n\nvision of a European stock inspector and veterinary officer.\n\n8. The opening-up in the northern areas of water, and the provision\n\nof storage facilities, have a1s0received the attention of the autborities.\n\nUp to 1959 a total of 257 watering points (dams, boreholes, wells, etc.)\n\nwere constructed, and during the years 1955 to 1960, 62 boreholes were\n\nsunk and ten dams built at a total cost of overR600,ooo (~300,ooo).\n\nspent on the followingprojects to increase water supplies in the northern\n\nareas:\n\nOkavango the administrative headquarters forat\n\nRuntu . . . . . . . .-. . . . .

A second canal known as the Itaka canal is also under\n\nconstruction.\n\nWatering points have, where possible, been sited so as to enable the\n\npopulation in the said areas to be more evenly distributed.\n\n9.

It appears that Ovamboland has always (or, at any rate, as far\n\nback aspopulation figuresare available) been the most densely populated\n\narea in the Territory, and, in view of its climatic superiority and the\n\nsettled nature of its people. this is hardly surprising.\n\nIn 1876 Palgrave estimated its population at 98,000 ',whereas in the\n\nmuch larger areas. referred to by him as Damaraland and Great Nama-\n\nqualand (which together constitute roughly the present Police Zone).\n\nthere were,according to him, only 137,850non-White people 2.\n\nVideBook IV, Chap.

At the end of the German regime, only a\n\nfew Native communities were permitted by the authorities to occupy\n\nspecific areas of land ?. It will be recalled that in 1913 approximately\n\n80percent. of the total non-White adult male population in the Police\n\nZone were employed as wage-earners 3. During the period of military\n\noccupation, temporary reserves were created for some Natives '.\n\nz. On assumption of the Mandate, Respondent decided to extend the\n\nreserve svstem. In contrast to the settlement scheme for Euro~eans,\n\nthe reasons for which were economic (i.e..to develop the agric6ltural\n\nresources of the area in order to increase and stabilize income, exporis.\n\nand revenue), the reserve policy was to a large extent based on social\n\nconsiderations. It was deemed necessary to restore, as far as was possible,\n\nthe tribal life and social organizations of the shattered tribes as a pre-\n\nrequisite to the establishment of a settled and contented Native popu-\n\nlation. It was not expected that Native agriculture would, at anyrate for\n\nyears to corne,play any signifiant role in the exchange economy of the\n\narea. It was, indeed, the a&preciation.of this factor which was one of the\n\nreasons for stimulating hite immigration. On the other hand, the\n\norganizations of the tribes, and could form the bais for the futuree social\n\ndevelopment of Native agriculture.\n\n3. The basic considerations of Respondent's reserve policy will be\n\ndealt with in more detail below 5. At this stage, two points require\n\nemphasis, viz.,\n\n(a) The restoration of tribal life could proceed only on the traditional\n\nbasis of common ntilization of land since the concept of individual\n\ntitle to land was repugnant to the very basis of tribal society in\n\nSouth WestAfrica. In addition, such concept was not understood hy\n\nthe Native population, who consequently did not appreciate the\n\nnecessity for capital improvements or the danger of overgrazing.\n\nTheir traditional attitudes towards stock placed importance on\n\nquantity rather than quality. Individual tenure of land would\n\ntherefore not onlyhave frustrated the wholesocial object of creating\n\nreserves, but would have resulted in wastefnl use of land '.\n\n(b) A reserve could only serve its purpose if the inhabitants thereof\n\n' Vide Book IV, Chap.

The policy of European land settlement soon paid handsome divi-\n\ndends for the benefit of al1the inhabitants of South West Africa.\n\nThe Territory shared in the world's short-lived prosperity between\n\n1925 and 1929, and also suffered with the rest of the world during the\n\nearly thirties in the severest and longest depression ever experienced.\n\nSouth West Africa prolonged its phase of prosperity tn some extent,\n\nhowever, by its high level of intemal capital formation when the first\n\nsigns of the great depression were already evident in other countries.\n\nSubsequently, however. it experienced a more severe and protracted\n\ndepression than wasthecase inmost other countries, due toits exceptional\n\nvulnerability to changes in world trade conditions; the fact that South\n\nAfrica went off the gold standard a year after Great Britain did, thereby\n\ntuming the temis of trade heavily against South West Africa during\n\n1931-1932;the occurrence of a very severe drought in the Police Zone,\n\nwhich lasted until the end of 1933; and the limited nature of the steps\n\nwhich could be taken to counter the effects of the depression. Thus the\n\ntotal income of South West Africa dropped from R14 (l7 ) illion in\n\n1929 to R4.z (Lz.1)million in 1933. Le., a decline of 70 per cent. ' This\n\nfigure is to be compared with a contraction of less than 40 per cent. in\n\nthe national income of the United States of America between the years\n\n1929 and 1932 (the latter being the worst year for the American eco-\n\nconditions,nthecorrespondingcontraction whicwas onlyxzorper cent.. thanks to\n\nthe stabilizing influence of gold mining.

The severity and protraction of the depression could large!y be\n\nascribed to conditions in the mining industry which was practically\n\nclosed dom. In spite of great difficulties,livestock farrning proved to he\n\ncompensatory to the complete failure of mining during the first half of\n\nthe 1930s. The severe drought conditions which lasted until the end of\n\n1933, the outbreak of foot-and mouth disease during 1934-1935,and the\n\npoor prices in the South African livestock market during the first half of\n\nthe 1930%contrihuted to the depressed conditions in SouthWest Africa.\n\nbut despite it all, the level of income originating in agriculture recovered\n\nby 1934-1935toits high level of Rj.1 (&1.55)million in 1929.\n\n7. While the contribution of mining to the total income of South\n\nWest,Africa had been reduced to ni1in 1933and 1934, agriculture stifl\n\ncontnbuted 18 percent. of the total income of the Territory in the worst\n\ncontributor to the income of the Territory during the latter part of the\n\n'Hailey, AAfricnn Suw(1957)p..1268.

This rise in the importance of tlie contributioii of sgriculture to\n\nthe total iiome~ticproduct of the Territor).. was due partly to the slow\n\nrecovery in minin6 but also to a signifiant improGemënt in annual\n\nagricultural production, which included the rapid growth of the karakul\n\nindustry during the latter half of the 1930s.Thus the value of the income\n\noriginating in agricultural production increased from Ro.7 (L0.35)\n\nmillion in 1933to R7 (L3.5)million by 1939,being more than double the\n\nhighest figure reached previously. viz.. in 1928.

The table on page 13indicates how\n\nkarakul slieep came to replace otlier breeds of small stock and, thereby,\n\nadded aiiotlier stabilizing force to livestock farming in the Territory.\n\nIt sliould, however. be appreciated that karakul farming requires the\n\nvigilant andcontinuousapplication of highly scientificbreedingmethods,\n\nestablislied on any large scale. This largely explains why, during the\n\n1930s karakul farming was developed and almost exclusively under-\n\ntaken by Europeans.\n\ng.

CHAPTER IV\n\nRESPONDENT'SREPLY TO APPLICANTS' ALLEGATIONS\n\n(MEMORIALS)\n\nParagraph 16of Chapter V '\n\nI. It isadmitted that the bulkof the Native population ofthe Territory\n\nis to be found in the northern areas outside the Police Zone. According\n\nto the 1960 census figures, the total Native population numbered 438,575\n\n(including 4,528 foreign migrant workers. mostly from Angola) of whom\n\n257,85l5 ived in the northern sector, amounting therefore to approxi-\n\nmately 63percent. ofthe total.Thereasons forthegreaterdensityof popu-\n\nlation inthe northem areasare to befouiid inmore favourable climaticcon-\n\nditions, and in social, economic and historical circumstances, including.\n\nin particular. the fact that the inhabitants of these areas have always\n\nbeen agriculturists, and not pastoral nomads like the Native inhabitants\n\nof the Police Zone, and that they were largely spared the exterminating\n\nwars of the past.\n\n2. It is admitted that the inhabitants of the northern territories are\n\nfar removed from the principal areas of modem economic development\n\nand activity. This was the position when Respondent assumed the\n\nMandate, and this situation could have been altered in one of two ways.\n\nviz., either by encouraging or forcing the peopleto leave their lands and\n\nflock to the Police Zone, or, altematively, by a process of rapid develop-\n\nment of the northern temtories with the aid of European initiative and\n\ncapital. The latter altemative has beeu considered above, where it was\n\nflowed from such a course would, in Respondent's opinion, have out-\n\nweiahed bv far anv coniectural material benefit which miaht have\n\naccrued tothe inha6itants2. -\n\nThe former alternative would have been even more impractical. Even\n\non economic grounds. i.e., apart from social factors, there can be no\n\nreason for encouraging the inhabitants of the northern areas to leave\n\ntheir lands in order to attempt to practise their traditional subsistence\n\nagriculture in less favoured regions (where agriculture, as distinct from\n\npastoralism. is by and large impossible) for the purpose of selling agri-\n\ncultural prcducts in the unlikely event of there being any surplus over\n\nand above their own requirements.\n\n3. It is to be noted that the complaint levelled by Applicants against\n\nRespondent in respect of the northern areas (being, in effect,that\n\n\"modem economic development and activity\" should have been stimu-\n\nlated in the area) amonnts to the exact converse of their complaint\n\nrelatine to the Police Zone. Such deveio~ment and activitv would neces-\n\nsarily have required exploitation by Êuropeans of ttir'onl!. a\\,;iil;ible\n\nnstural rvsources of these arens (i.e ,the agricultural potential,. with a\n\nresultarit lossof land hv the Sativei. On the other hnnd. \\i,itrespect to\n\nthe Police Zone, whe;e the Natives are near \"the principal aÎeas of\n\n' 1,p. rrz.\n\nVida Chap.II. paras.2-5.rupro. COUNTER-MEMORIALOF SOUTH AFRICA 9\n\nmodem economic development and activity\", Applicants apparently\n\ncomplain that the claims of the Natives to the land in the Police Zone\n\nwere not met ',a course which, if followed, would have prevented the\n\nmaintenance or creation of such \"areas of development and activity\".\n\n4. The nature of the agricultural activities in the northem areas has\n\nbeen described 2.The subsistence type of agriculture isnot, as Applicants\n\nwould seem to suggest, forced on the population by the inaccessibility\n\nof markets or by a \"deliberate, systematic and consistent course of\n\nconduct\" bv which Resnondent bas \"discriminated a~ainst the 'Native'\n\npopulation'of South West Africa in agriculture\"'. Qn the contrary, it\n\nrepresents an aspect of the traditional lives of these peo-le,-which they\n\nleid out of prefërence, not necessity.\n\n5. Furthermore, it is incorrect to suggest, as Applicants appear to do.\n\nthat the inhabitants of the northern territories merely \"survive\",orthat\n\ntheir agricultural activities only \"keep [them] alive under normal con-\n\nditions\". The favourable living conditions in the northem areas are\n\nreflected in the increases in population referred to above '. In addition,\n\nthere has been a steady rise in the general standard of living in these\n\nareas, due in part to increased agncultural production,and in part to\n\nwages eamed by Ovambo workers in the PoliceZone. In thelatter regard.\n\nit is true that the inhabitants of the northem areas take part in the\n\nmodem monetaty economy mainly b serving as labourers in the mines,\n\nindustries and on farms within the golice Zone. Labour is the normal\n\n\\r.ay in which underde\\feloped ~>eoplesenter tlic money economy: The\n\nlabour corning lrom the northern territories is regulated in association\n\nwitti ttie Native tribal authonties in those arcs. in order to r>re\\,entthe\n\nsociai disruption of their tribes 5.\n\nParagraph 17 of ChapterV\n\n6. The land in Native reserves was never, as aUeged by Applicants,\n\n\"the property of the Administration of South West Africa\".

The réserves consequently at ali\n\ntimes vested in Kespondent. and not in the Administration of South\n\nWest Africa, which. in any event, is not a !egalpersona\n\nSave for the aforesaid, paragraph 17 1s admitted. The nature and\n\nfunctions of the South African Native T~st, and the reasons for vesting\n\nthe South West Africanreserves in suchTrust, are dealt with fully below9.\n\nV~dcChap.

The Rehoboth\n\nGebietis largely owned by the Rehoboth Burghersin individual title,\n\nand Native labour isemployed on farms in the area. In addition, there are\n\nat least 14fams in the Territory whicb are owned by Coloured persons.\n\nFurthemore commercial faming is practised to some extent in the\n\nrncar\\.'=<2.\n\nThe \\vork dorie by Yati\\,es employed on farms varies fromcompletely\n\nunskilled work to r~lati\\~elyresponsible and skilled work. suçh as that of\n\nfarm forernen. liecruitmeiit of labour isdealt with elsewhere '.\n\nSave as aforestated, paragraph 18is admitted\n\nParagraphs 19 and 28 ofChapter V '\n\n8. The basic situation in the Territory on the assumption of the\n\nMandate, and the consequences flowingtherefrom, have been dealt with\n\nabove? It wiU be recalled that on assumption of the Mandate, the\n\nPolice Zone was largely underpopulated. and its development required\n\nan increase in the immieration of Euro~ean farmers. In addition. it was\n\niiecessary for the rîgenërntion of the social and political institiitions of\n\nthe scattercd remnants of tlie Native tribes that their membcrs \\r.ishin~\n\nto practise agriculture should be concentrated in units in which tbë\n\ntraditional order could, as far as possible,be restored.\n\nIt follows from the aforegoing that Respondent could not reasonably\n\nhave pursued a policy permitting individual Natives, or small groups of\n\nNatives, to live on, or to roam over large tracts of potentially useful\n\nland. As a result of the events of the past, many of these individuals or\n\nerouDs were deoendent for their livelihood on the hunt or on robberv\n\nand it need hardiy be stated that they, livingin the main on the fringesof,\n\nor outside. the lau~,constituted a real threat to peace and securitv. In the\n\ninterests ofthe Territorv. it was therefore neceGarv to settle them. either\n\nin reserves where tbey Couldpractise and develoitheir traditional agri-\n\ncultural systems in the Company of their own kith and kin and under\n\ncontrol of Res~ondent and the renascent Native authorities. or else on\n\nf:irms or in to\\;.ns wherî the!. could earn their living. ;icquireknou,ledgt\n\nof modern fnrming. commercial and industrial methods and depasture\n\nsuch stock as the? possessed on the farms of their employers, the town\n\nc- - ~ ~es or near~~-~~~e.ves. ~~\n\n~onseqtkntly it would. in Respondent's \\.iew. have been detrimental\n\nto the interests of the Temtorv if the authorities ivere to have desistcd\n\nfrom allocating pieces of land as farms. or proclaiming them as reserves,\n\n1. pp. riz-1x3.\n\n* Vidr sec.

IV, of thir Counter-Memonal COUNTER-MEMOR OA LOUTH AFRICA 25\n\nmerely because individual Natives or small groups of Natives were\n\nmaking use thereof in the manner aforestated.\n\ng., In the result, Respondent did not so desist, and consequently any\n\nNatives found in areas allotted as farms, or proclaimed as reserves,\n\neither had to faIl in with the new status of such areas. or to leave them.\n\nThis consequence flowedinevitably from such allotment or proclamation.\n\nThe terms of thestandard lease referred to by Applicants 'merely served\n\nto explain the rights of the lesseein this respect.\n\nIn reserves, the specific choiceofany Natives living on the land prior\n\n~~ its rocl la mat ion.was either to he assimilated in the reserve com-\n\nmunitiés,accepting their authority, or to depart. On farms, such Natives\n\ncould neaotiate acceptable agreements with the farmers, or seek more\n\nconeeniai emolovment elsewhere. or move to the reserves. In addition.\n\ntheFewas no iegd bar to prevent them acquiring land for themselves.\n\nIO. In Respondent's submission, the whole emphasis of Applicants'\n\ncomolaint is misdaced. There can be no obiection to arantin~ a riaht to\n\na fahier to ~ia\\fe'~crsonsrcniovçd froni Iiisinnd il thii are iiot I,r<)ared\n\nto work for him. llic only possil)leobjection relates tu thc kict that land\n\n\\vas granted to famiers <lespitethe preseiice th~reon of 'lati\\,cs. \\Vhen\n\nregard is Iiad to the i:onsiderations set out in the pre\\.ious paragrapfis, it\n\n\\riIl bc apparent that suc11objection possc.sscsno \\ral~<liiy.\n\nParagraph 20 of Chapter V '\n\nII. The facts stated in this paragraph are admitted. The reasons for\n\norganizing reserves on the basis of common use of land. have been\n\nmentioned above' with reference to a more detailed exposition in\n\nRespondent's reply to Applicants' complaints regarding \"Rights of\n\nResidence\" 5.\n\nParagraph 21 of Chapter V\n\n12. Before dealing with the detailed allegations in this paragraph, it\n\nis necessary to point out that it forms part of a section under the heading\n\n\"Well-being, Social Progress and Development in Agricrrllure\" 6.(Italics\n\nadded.) Rights of ownerçhip in respect of non-agricultural land are\n\ntherefore not at oresent relevant '.\n\nI)cvcrtheless, ihe whole emphasis of Applicants' complaint contained\n\nin this paragraph is placed on restrictions or1the owning of land in urban\n\nareas Thus they commence bv quoting part of a staternent (presumably\n\n'1,p. 116.\n\nRegarding wages, conditions of employment, the provision of an area for\n\ncultivation or depasturing ofstock, etc.\n\n1.p. r13. -\n\n' Yidc Chap.

ILI.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to state that ag\"cultura1 activities are not normaily\n\ncarried on inside urban areas.26 SOUTH WEST AFRICA\n\nwith the intention of attempting to refute it) in which Respondent\n\nrendered it quite clear that Natives were entitled to acquire and occupy\n\nland outside urban areas. However, in their next subparagraph they\n\nrefer again to provisions relating to rights in respect of land \"within an\n\nurbanafea ora rural township\" '. (Italics added.)\n\n13. Finally, in an attempt to prove that Natives are not entitled to\n\nown agricultural land in the Territory. Applicants refer to a statement by\n\nRespondent that \"the Natives generally have not yet reached the stage of\n\ndevelopment where they would benefit from individual land ownership,\n\nparticularly of farms\" 2.\n\nWhereas Respondent believes this statement to be true, it hardly\n\nserves as evidence that Natives are by law precluded from acquiring\n\nagricultural land. In its context ',this passage served asan explanation\n\nwhy assistance under the landsettlement lawshad not been requested by,\n\nor granted to, Natives. In addition, it affords an explanation why no\n\nsteps have been taken to subdivide the reserves into separate allotments.\n\nBy no process of reasoning. however, can this statement. in conjunction\n\nwith provisions regarding ownership of land in urban areas, give rise to\n\nthe inference \"that no individual 'Natives' own land or can own land\n\nanywhere within the Territory of South West Africa\" '.\n\nParagraph zz of Chapter V '\n\n14. The Union of South Africa never \"declared ali unallocated land\n\nwithin the Territory to be govemment land as alleged by Applicants.\n\nOn assumption of the Mandate, al1land which had previously vested in\n\nthe German authorities, passed to Respondent 5. Provision was made\n\nfor the manner of dealing with such land in two proclamations, viz.. the\n\nLand Settlement Proclamation, 1920 6.and the Crown Land Disposal\n\nProclamation, 1920 '.The Land Settlement Proclamation, which is the\n\nrelevant provision for present purposes, defined \"Crown Land\" as follows:\n\n\". . al1iinalienated land \\vithiil the said Trrrirory h~we\\~cracquircd.\n\nwliich was Iately the property of thc Gcrman Government. and such\n\nfurther land as mav be acauired bv Go\\,emmcnt under the provisions\n\nofthe Land SettleGent AE ~s aménded\n\nThe definition of Crown land in the Crown Land Disposai Proclama-\n\ntion is, up to the words \"of the German Government\", identical to the\n\none quoted above, but in the last part there are some verbal differences\n\nwhich do not, however, materially affect the meaning 9.\n\nSec. 7Of the Natives (Urhan Areas) proclamation. 1951. referreto in1. p.113.\n\n21..Di Ih-\n\n' Ibid., p. \"4.-rr6.\n\n' Vide para. 6.au+vn and Book VIII. sec.C.

Applicants' allegations regarding authonty over government land\n\nare also eitherwrone or misleadine. Le~islative Dowersover the Territow\n\nwere initiaily exercysed by the Govemor-~en&al of South Africa witii\n\npowers of delegation '. In 1925a South West African Legislative Assem-\n\nbly was created by Act No. 42of 1925 2.This Assembly was given certain\n\nlimited legislative powers. However, any enactment (cailedan Ordinance)\n\npassed by the Assembly required the assent of Respondent's represen-\n\ntative, the Administrator. acting subject to Respondent's instmctions.\n\nThe Administrator war also entitled to reserve anv draft Ordinance \"for\n\ntlie signification of thëple&ure of tlie ~overnor-~kneral\" 3(i.e..

In addition. the (;o\\,ernor-General retained his own\n\nmwers of leeislatine for the Territorv un a11subiccts. an exercise of ivhich\n\nbas expressïy stat& to ovemde a&thing to the c&ntrary contained in\n\nany Ordinance '.\n\n16. Not only were these limitations placed on the legislative powersof\n\nthe Assembly, but it was also at no stage, prior to 1949,given authorlty\n\nin respect of the allotment of Crown land. Section 27 of the 1925 Act\n\nprovided that legislative competence regarding \"the allotment, sale,\n\nlease or disposal of Government lands in the Temtory\" could in certain\n\ncircumstances be granted to the Assembl by2'.e Governor-Generai. In\n\nfact this was not done. and only in 1949 did the Assembl obtain such\n\ncompetence but even then still subject to the possibility ofdisallowance\n\nby the Administrator or the Governor-General, and to the overriding\n\nlegislative competence of the SouthAfncan Parliament.\n\nNot only was the power of legislation in regard to the allocation\n\nof rown land refained by the Governor-General (or his representative,\n\nthe Administratorl until lado. but he (or his officers) retained control\n\nover the actual l~rocesses~(dfiotment. ln tems of the'1~20Land Settle-\n\nment l'roclamation. the allocation of Crown land \\va tliz function of the\n\nSouth African Minister of Lands. and this Liuictioii \\vas csercised on the\n\nadvice of the Land Board. a sta&tory body appointed by the,Governor-\n\nGeneral (Le., the South African Government) '.

It is admitted, however, that land was\n\npurchased from companies which had large holdings, for subdivision\n\nand distribution among European farmen.\n\nVide Book III. Chaps.

As noted abovï, alter the end of the Second World War. further\n\nland was allotted. It is admitted that the Police Zone boundary was\n\nextcnded in 1953, 1954and 1956. It is incorrect to assume. as Applicants\n\napparently do, that the whole of the area beyond the Police Zone has\n\nbeen rcservecl for occupatioii by Natives, or that the whole of it is so\n\noccilpied. 111fact, thcre lias always been a substantial uninhabited area\n\nadjoining the Zone. As lias been noted. the Police Zone resulted from an\n\nhistoric administrative division ofthe Territorv * continued bv Res~on-\n\ndent, and it constitutes the area in which théPolice normal$ ope;ate.\n\nThe rcasons for extendina the boundaries of the Zone are therefore to be\n\nsourrlit in administrativëconsiderations. In some cases this arose from\n\ntlie\"necessity 01providing police protection for new farmsallotted in the\n\npreviously uninhabited areas in the northern part of the Territory. There\n\nkere, however, othcr reasons, siich as to bÏing newly declared Native\n\nareas within the limits of the Zoiie, and thus to enable the Police, inter\n\nalin. to inspect sheep tlierein for scab.\n\n24. The total area of the Territory is 823,145 sq. km. (ercluding the\n\nPort and Settlement of Walvis Bay) J.As at May 1961,land reserved for\n\nor belonging to non-Whites amounted to 219,559sq. km. and land owned\n\nby or leased to Europeans amounted to 389,650sq. km. ' ln fact, therefore.\n\nas at 1961,European farmland represented more that 45per cent. of the\n\nTerritory whereas reservcs amounted to approximately 27 per cent.\n\nIt is admitted that a large part of the area such as the Namib desert,\n\nfalline outside the reserves and the ar~a~ farmed bv Euro~4ans. i~'u~- .\n\nsuitable for agricu~tiie.\n\nApplicants state that \"some of these lands [i.e., European farms]\n\nbordercd uDon the northern 'Native' areas outside the Police Zone\" '.\n\nIn fact this'staternent is incorrect, since there is an uninhabited strip of\n\nland of varying width running along the whole length between the\n\nnorthern Native areas andthe I'oliceZone. 13ritin any event, Respondent\n\ndoes not appreciate why Applicants should object to the mere fact of\n\nEwopean farms bordering on the northern Native areas.\n\n25. The occupation of such a large proportion of the Temtory's land\n\nby European farmers, arises from historical and economic circumstances.\n\nThe position of the northern areas has been considered above '.In those\n\nareas the concentration ofa relatively large number of people in relatively\n\nsmall areas arises from su erior possibilities for agriculture. as well as\n\nfrom historical and sociaf circurnstances. In respect of those areas.\n\nApplicants' mmplaint is apparently not that too little land ha been\n\nleft for the Native inhabitants-indeed. no encroachment on the tribal\n\nareas in the north is, or can be, alleged-but rather that Respondent\n\nfailed to create \"areas of modern economic development and activity\"\n\n' 1. p. 1x5.\n\nVide Book IV, Chap.

The necessity for\n\npreventing thealienationofland byNativesisdealtwithin moredetail\n\nelsewhere j,II is notable that outside the reserves in the Police Zone,\n\nno Native has ever purchaçed land. despite the absence of any legal\n\nimpediment in that regard. Consequently, if Res ndent wished\n\nto ensure that a greater percentage of land area s ould Liein the\n\npossession of the Natives. it would have been necessary to create\n\nmore or larger reserves.\n\n(à) The economic development of the Temtory required the encour-\n\nagement of European farming. Proper administration of the\n\nTemtorv. not to mention its develo~ment. would have been im-\n\npossible'ior Respondent in the absefice of progressive commercial\n\nfarmers. The Natives were not in a position to supp-. .uch men.\n\n27. The objectives of Res ondent's policieswere therefore of a conflic-\n\ntin- nature. On the one han$ it was deemed necessarv to provide inalien-\n\nable rritir\\trs for the Satives. where they woiilclhe ;otecicd [rom \\Vhite\n\ncompetition and from inducements to seIl their fand.

It was Respondent's duty to strike a balance between\n\nthese conflictine considerations. and. bearine in mind that Natives are\n\neiititled to purciiasc agriçulrural landin any part of the l>oliceZoric.it is\n\nsubmittcd that the pro\\,isions that have been made. are not iinre:~a>iiablc.\n\nIii addition. it mu31he em~hasizedthat the Dresentextent of the reservas\n\nneed not rehain unaltered' In the past, \\vhe~Îthe need ;,rose forniore Ian(l\n\nfor Satives. the reserves wereeuteridcclor newones crrat~.d.often by the\n\npurchase or expropriation of European-held farms '.\n\nParagraph 26 of ChapterV '\n\n28. Save as indicated below,this paragraph correctly reflects the main\n\nconditions relating to allotment of land. There have, however, been\n\nvariations in the past. So, for instance, when allotment of land was\n\nresumed in 1935. Respondent pursued-\n\n'1, p.llZ.\n\nVide Book IV. Chap. IV, paras.29-zq.and Book VI. Chap.

The relevant requirement is\n\nthat in cases of allotments since 1947, grants are made only to \"British\n\nsubject~\"~. The expression \"British subject\" means \"a South African\n\ncitizen, a citizen of a Commonwealth country or a citizen of the Republic\n\nof Irelaod'\".\n\nThe term \"South African citizen\" includes persons born in South West\n\nAfrica since 1926 '.\n\nIt is to be noted further that the necessity of being a \"British subject\"\n\nobtains only at thestage when the full purchase price has been paid, and\n\nthe allottee desires to obtain a grant of the holding. Normally 30 years\n\nor more would, at this stage. have elapsed since the initial allotment\n\nof a lease in respect of the holdin , so that any allottee would have had\n\nample time to become naturalizef In fact, special provision is made for\n\nallotments to overseas applicants5.\n\nIt is admitted, however, that most allotments were made to South\n\nAfrican citizens.\n\nAs was stated in 1935 by a Commission of enquiry:\n\n\"The Union Nationals did not come into'the Territory devoid of\n\nmeans or farming experience. We have been informed by the\n\nSecretary for South West Africa that between r92o and 1925 the\n\naverage amount brought by each settler was£754 and between 1926\n\nand 1g3i. :£1,287.
