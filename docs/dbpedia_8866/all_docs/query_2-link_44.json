        "text": "The Weimar Constitution\n\nThe Weimar Republic adopted a new constitution , different to that of the previous monarchy . Under the new republic, all adults over the age of twenty could vote.\n\nInstead of a monarch, there was a president elected every seven years. The president’s power was limited by the Reichstag . However, in the state of an emergency, Article 48 of the new constitution gave the president ultimate authority to rule by decree.\n\nThere were two parliamentary houses in the Republic, the Reichstag and the Reichsrat . The chancellor was the leader of the Reichstag. The chancellor held similar position to the British Prime Minister, and was appointed by the President. Typically, the chancellor would be the leader of the largest party, although this was not always the case.\n\nThe Weimar Republic was a federal system. It was split into eighteen different states called Länder, each of which had their own local government. The Länder could send representatives from their local government to the Reichsrat.\n\nDespite these changes, there were also many aspects of the government that continued as before. To maintain stability in government, many of the old civil servants and military leaders stayed in similar positions of power, and therefore still had enormous influence.\n\nHyperinflation and the invasion of the Ruhr\n\nThroughout the war, the value of the German currency, the Reichsmark, fell considerably. In 1914, one British pound was equal to twenty German marks. In 1919, one British pound was equal to 250 marks. To try and meet the requirements of government spending and alleviate the post-war situation, the government had little choice but to print more money. This in fact made the inflationary situation worse and again reduced the value of the Reichsmark.\n\nMeanwhile, in the midst of this economic crisis, Germany continued to attempt to pay the reparations as dictated by the Treaty of Versailles. The reparations had to be paid in gold marks, which maintained its value, whilst the German currency declined. This made it more and more expensive to pay.\n\nIn 1922, Germany requested permission to suspend their payments whilst their economy recovered. This was refused by the Allies. By 1923, Germany reached breaking point as inflation started to run out of control. They were unable to continue paying reparations.\n\nOn the 9 January 1923, in response to the lack of payment of reparations, France and Belgium invaded the Ruhr. The Ruhr was a region of Germany which contained resources such as factories. The French and Belgians intended to use these resources to make up for the unpaid reparations.\n\nGerman factory workers refused to co-operate with the occupying French and Belgian armies. With the German governments support, the workers went on strike. The French sent in their own workers, and arrested the leaders of the German strikers and the German police. This led to violence on both sides.\n\nWith the French and Belgian occupation of the Ruhr, goods in Germany became even more difficult to obtain, and therefore very expensive. To fix this problem and pay the striking Ruhr workers, the government again printed more money. This led to hyperinflation.\n\nBy the autumn of 1923 a loaf of bread cost 200,000,000,000 marks. Workers paid by the hour found their wages were worthless, because prices had risen since they began their shifts. The situation was critical.\n\nPolitical instability in the Weimar Republic\n\nThe new Proportional Representation system of voting in the Weimar Republic caused political instability.\n\nWhilst the new system intended to reduce political conflicts, it in fact resulted in many different parties gaining a small amount of seats in the Reichstag. This meant that no one party had overall an overall majority, and parties joined together to rule in coalitions.\n\nIn these coalitions, each party had different aims which often led to disagreements on policy. These disagreements made it difficult for the Reichstag to govern. In the early 1920s there were many changes of government, which made managing Germany’s political and economic problems very difficult.\n\nIn addition to this difficulty, the unpopular reparations payments, which Germany were forced to pay through the Treaty of Versailles , put a huge amount of economic pressure on the government.\n\nThese tough economic and political circumstances made people susceptible to extreme political views. In order to keep control and peace in the early 1920s, Friedrich Ebert relied heavily on the traditionally right-wing army and Freikorps .\n\nStresemann and the Dawes Plan\n\nIt was at this moment of crisis that Gustav Stresemann was elected as chancellor in September 1923. Stresemann was a politician of the DVP, the German People’s Party. In 1923 he formed a coalition of the DVP , SPD , DDP and Centre Party and became chancellor.\n\nTo try and tackle the crisis gripping Germany, Stresemann followed a policy of ‘fulfillment’ whereby he aimed to improve international relations by attempting to fulfil the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. These improved relationships would then in turn help him to secure a reasonable revision to the treaty.\n\nFollowing this policy, Stresemann made the unpopular decision to start repaying the reparations and order the striking workers of the Ruhr to return to work.\n\nStresemann also appointed Hjalmar Schacht , a banker, to tackle the issue of hyperinflation. In November 1923, Schacht introduced a new German currency, the Rentenmark, based on land values and foreign loans. One Rentenmark was worth 10,000,000,000,000 of the old currency.\n\nIn April 1924, Stresemann’s policy of fulfillment paid off. An American economist named Charles Dawes was recruited to help to set a new, realistic, target for Germany’s reparations payments. This was called the Dawes Plan.\n\nUnder this plan, the reparations were reduced to 50 million marks a year for the next five years, and then 125 million marks a year following that. The plan also recommended that the German National Bank was reorganised, and that Germany receive an international loan. This loan was for 800 million gold marks, financed primarily by America.\n\nThese measures eased the economic pressure on Germany, and relations with other countries began to improve and then stabilise.\n\nThis economic improvement, as well as improvements in foreign relations, led to the years between 1924 and 1929 becoming known as the ‘Golden Years’.\n\nThe Golden Years\n\nThe years 1924 to 1929 became known as the ‘Golden Years’, as foreign relations improved and the economy prospered.\n\nStresemann worked to improve Germany’s international relations. In the Locarno Pact of 1925, France, Belgium and Germany agreed to respect each other’s borders. In 1926, Germany was accepted into the League of Nations.\n\nThe Dawes Plan, alongside a sudden injection of foreign loans, helped the German economy to stabilise and prosper. This situation allowed the German government to invest in new public facilities, such as hospitals and schools. Those in work saw real improvements in working conditions as wages increased and working hours decreased.\n\nCulture in Germany also flourished, as previously established thoughts and beliefs were thrown aside for new ideas. The German art school Bauhaus is a key example of this, promoting experimental modernist art and architecture.\n\nHowever, not all of Germany’s problems had been fixed.\n\nUnemployment was still very high with two million people unemployed in 1926. 1.3 million were still unemployed in 1928.\n\nThe farming industry was also slow to recover from the wartime pressures, and agricultural and rural wages were much lower than those in big towns and cities.\n\nFurthermore, the sudden injection of foreign loans had left Germany dependent on income that they could not control.\n\nDespite this, Germany had made significant steps on the road to recovery between 1924-29. Unfortunately, this would come to an abrupt end with the Wall Street Crash of 1929.\n\nADVANCED CONTENT\n\nThe Young Plan\n\nThe Dawes Plan for reparations payments ended in 1928. A new, final, plan was created to cover the rest of the debt. This was called the Young Plan, named after its creator Owen D. Young.\n\nThe new plan had two key features. It gave an end date for the reparations payments, and it gave Germany a set amount to pay each year.\n\nThe end date of the payments was set for 1988, 59 years away in 1929 when the plan was being formulated. The average annual payment would be two billion marks.\n\nThe Young Plan aimed to continue the stablisation of the German economy, whilst still fulfilling the reparations payments from the First World War.\n\nThe plan faced some extreme opposition in the press and the Reichstag. This opposition was primarily from right-wing nationalists in the NSDAP, DNVP, and Pan German League. They claimed the plan represented acceptance for the war, and therefore made German liable to having to pay reparations. The nationalists wanted an end to the payments and the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nDespite this opposition, with little other way forward, the Reichstag passed the plan and it was formally adopted in 1930.\n\nADVANCED CONTENT\n\nWeimar Culture\n\nAcross 1920s Europe, cultural tradition was challenged and social values were relaxed.\n\nBerlin became a hub of avant-garde experimentation. Whilst not as experimental, the villages, towns and other cities across Germany also underwent a new phase of culture.\n\nWhen the Weimar Republic had been created, the government had declared that censorship would not take place. Whilst, somewhat inevitably, censorship did still take place, the borders of what was allowed to be published were relaxed and there was a great deal more freedom.\n\nDespite the economic pressures of the early 1920s, public funding at a local level was widely invested in culture and the arts.\n\nThe music hall and the theatre became less popular as the cinema exploded onto the screen. By the end of the 1920s more than 5000 cinemas operated in Germany, and in 1928, approximately 353 million cinema tickets were sold, in comparison to approximately twelve million theatre tickets in 1926-27.\n\nMusic also became more experimental, with the controversial rise of Jazz music and clubs.\n\nWhilst welcomed by many, the new age of Weimar culture also had critics. The cultural experimentation was seen as a dramatic break with the tradition of Germany, influenced by Western culture. This feeling resonated with many conservatives outside of Berlin, who found the new experimental culture alienating .\n\nSome groups, on the far right of the political spectrum, felt so alienated from this new culture that they called for a ‘Third Reich’ that would reassert the traditional gender structure, art and music of Germany.\n\nThe Wall Street Crash and the Depression\n\nThe Wall Street Crash was a stock market crash that took place from the 24 October to 29 October 1929. Following the optimism of the 1920s, people were keen to invest in stocks and shares, where they believed they could make a fortune.\n\nThis burst of investment pushed companies stock market value higher than their real value .\n\nOn the 3 September 1929 stock prices reached an all-time high.\n\nHowever, shortly after this, prices started to drop. This led to mass panic selling. By October 1929, the value of the market halved.\n\nAs the world economies were linked through international business, the Wall Street Crash resulted in an international depression . As a result of this international depression, and the need for money at home, the USA called in their international loans.\n\nGermany was reliant on international loans and investment. They had used these, as explored above, to rebuild their economy after the war and hyperinflation crisis, and invest in new schools, businesses and hospitals. As the USA removed this investment, Germany fell into another economic crisis."
