The group is a fluid network organized into a number of regional battalions, including the Ziyad al-Jarrah Battalions based in Lebanon. The AAB has claimed responsibility for several rocket attacks in northern Israel and has also repeatedly articulated its intent to carry out attacks against Western targets in the Middle East. Since the start of protests in Syria, the AAB's communiqués have supported regime overthrow. AAB relies primarily on rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and suicide bombings. In 2014, the AAB claimed joint responsibility with Jabhat al-Nusra for rocket attacks in Hermel, Lebanon. The AAB also claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings near the Iranian cultural centre in Beirut, Lebanon, in February, 2014. AAB continued to operate with limited government control within Lebanon, primarily inside Lebanon’s 12 Palestinian refugee camps.

Founded by Abu Nidal in 1974, the goal of the ANO was to destroy the State of Israel, viewing armed struggle as the only method to liberate the people of Palestine. ANO was responsible for the November 1985 hijacking of an Egypt Air flight, which resulted in the death of at least 58 people, including a Canadian woman and her infant son. ANO was also responsible for the July 1988 explosion of two bombs near a cruise ship in Aegina, Greece killing 9, and the 1994 assassination of a Jordanian embassy diplomat in Beirut.\n\nAbu Sayyaf Group (ASG)\n\nAlso known as\n\nAl Harakat Al Islamiyya (AHAI), Al Harakat-ul Al Islamiyya, Al-Harakatul-Islamia, Al Harakat Al Aslamiya, Abou Sayaf Armed Band (ASAB), Abu Sayaff Group, Abu Sayyef Group and Mujahideen Commando Freedom Fighters (MCFF)\n\nDescription\n\nFounded in the early 1990s, the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) is a militant Islamist group with links to Al Qaida and Jemaah Islamiyyah. Ostensibly, the group's goal is the establishment of an Islamic state governed by Sharia Law in the south Philippines. In practice, however, the ASG primarily uses terrorism for profit: kidnap-for-ransom, guerrilla warfare, mass-casualty bombings, and beheadings are particularly favoured tactics. In 2016, two Canadian nationals were beheaded after being kidnapped this group. On May 23, 2017, members of ASG's Islamic State (IS)-aligned Basilan faction, in alliance with other IS-aligned militants, launched a siege on Marawi City, Philippines, that lasted five months. At least 45 civilians were killed during the siege, and 1,780 hostages were rescued. ASG continues to engage in terrorism activities and guerilla warfare, clashing with and targeting the Philippines Armed Forces, as well as targeting Christian and western individuals, in addition to kidnapping local or foreign targets who appear financially able to pay ransoms. In 2021, ASG reportedly destroyed a bridge in the Basilan province with an improvised explosive device.\n\nAl-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade (AAMB)\n\nAlso known as\n\nAAMB, Al-Aqsa Intifada Martyrs' Group, Al-Aqsa Brigades, Martyrs of al-Aqsa group, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Battalion and Armed Militias of the Al-Aqsa Martyr Battalions\n\nDescription\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade (AAMB) emerged at the outset of the 2000 Palestinian al-Aqsa intifada. AAMB’s ideological roots are in their allegiance to the Fatah, a left-wing political and military organization founded with the aim of wrestling Palestine away from Israeli control through low-intensity guerilla tactics. While AAMB is loyal to the Fatah, it is not under its direct control. Due to AAMB’s decentralized structure their funding is relatively ambiguous, though it’s believed that funding is mostly delivered from Iran through Hezbollah facilitators. Iran is thought to exploit AAMB’s lack of resources and decentralized leadership structure to ‘guide’ the organization in support to various AAMB cell’s anti-Israeli agenda. AAMB attacks Israeli military targets and Israeli settlers, aiming to expel Israeli presence from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and to establish an independent and sovereign Palestinian state there. On January 28, 2023, AAMB carried out a small-arms attack that killed seven Israeli civilians in East Jerusalem. On October 7, 2023 after Hamas launched an attack against Israel that claimed hundreds of lives, dozens of clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinian armed groups including AAMB, resulted in at least 12 reported fatalities.\n\nAl-Ashtar Brigades (AAB)\n\nAlso known as\n\nSaraya al-Ashtar, Al Ashtar Brigades, The Ashtar Brigades, Saraya Waad Allah, Wa’ad Allah Brigades, Islamic Allah Brigades, Imam al-Mahdi Brigades, al-Haydariyah Brigades\n\nDescription\n\nAl-Ashtar Brigades (AAB) is a Shia militant group supported by Iran which aims to overthrow Bahrain’s Sunni monarchy. AAB was established in 2013 and has incited violence towards the Bahraini leadership. AAB has claimed responsibility for several bombings targeting security forces, including the February 14, 2014, attack on a minibus carrying police officers, which wounded several; and the March 3, 2014, improvised explosive device attack which killed 3 policemen and injured several others. AAB also claimed responsibility for the killing of an off-duty police officer near Bahrain’s capital city, Manama, on January 29, 2017. In 2019, AAB vowed to target American and British interests in Bahrain.\n\nAl-Murabitoun\n\nAlso known as\n\nMourabitounes, Al-Mourabitoun, Al-Morabitoune, Al-Mourabitoune and Les Almoravides\n\nDescription\n\nAl-Murabitoun, based in West Africa, is a terrorist organization established through a merger between the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa and al'Muwaqi'un Bil-Dima in August 2013. Al-Murabitoun's goal is to spread jihad across North Africa. The group was formed to strengthen efforts against French military forces and interests in the region. Al-Murabitoun has carried out terrorist activity, such as the February 8, 2014 kidnapping of five Malian aid workers near Gao, Mali. In 2015, Al-Murabitoun reaffirmed its continued adherence to the jihadist ideology of Al Qaida (AQ). It has also conducted joint operations with Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast.

The MBD has carried out suicide bombing attacks and assaulted civilian facilities. For instance, the MBD claimed responsibility for the January 16, 2013 attack on the Tigantourine gas facility near the town of In Amenas in eastern Algeria. MBD militants, using assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank mines, took dozens of foreign and Algerian workers hostage that resulted in the deaths of at least 48 hostages. In August 2013, MBD merged with Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA) to form Al-Murabitoun.\n\nAl Qaida\n\nAlso known as\n\nAl Jihad (AJ), Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), Vanguards of Conquest (VOC), The Islamic Army, Islamic Salvation Foundation, The Base, Group for the Preservation of the Holy Sites, Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Holy Places, World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, Usama Bin Ladin Network, Usama Bin Ladin Organization and Qa'idat al-Jihad\n\nDescription\n\nFounded in 1988 by Usama bin Laden, Al Qaida serves as the strategic hub and driver for the global Islamist terrorist movement.

Al Qaida activities include, but are not limited to, suicide attacks, simultaneous bombings, kidnappings, and hijackings. Al Qaida has forged ties and strategic control over other like-minded Islamist terrorist groups and provides encouragement and inspiration to other affiliated and aligned groups around the world. The Al Qaida network has been directly or indirectly associated with the 1998 bombings of two United States embassies, as well as the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. It was directly involved in the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks of September 11, 2001 and in a foiled plot to bomb the New York subway system in 2009. In April 2017 Al Qaida organized a suicide bombing inside a metro train in St. Petersburg, Russia, killing at least 10 civilians, and injuring 40 more.

Its primary objectives are to cleanse the Arabian Peninsula of foreign influence – particularly Western military personnel and civilian contractors – and to establish a single Islamic caliphate in place of the existing regimes in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. AQAP's most prominent attacks have been suicide bombings; however, the group has also engaged in guerilla-style raids on military and security targets. It is also responsible for the failed December 25, 2009, attempt to detonate an explosive abroad a Northwest Airlines flight as the plane prepared to land in Detroit, and the 2015 attack on the office of the magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, France. In February 2020, AQAP released a video claiming responsibility for a December 2019 attack where a Royal Saudi Air Force trainee opened fire in a classroom at the US Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, killing at least three US sailors and injuring eight others. In February 2022, AQAP militants kidnapped five UN workers that were released in August 2023 after a ransom was paid to AQAP.\n\nAl Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS)\n\nAlso known as\n\nQaedat al-Jihad in the Indian Subcontinent and Jamaat Qaidat al Jihad fi Shibh al Qarrah al Hindiyah (Organization of the Base of Jihad in the Indian Subcontinent)\n\nDescription\n\nIn a video released on September 3, 2014, Al Qaida (AQ) leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the creation of a new AQ affiliated group, AQIS.

In October 2019, there were reports that six AQIS militants had arrived in Karachi from Afghanistan with plans to reactivate their sleeper cell to carry out terrorist attacks. AQIS continued to propagate for violent jihad against Indian interests worldwide and against Indian government and military personnel. On October 2023, AQIS published a statement that praised the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, urging jihadists to kill citizens of Israel’s Western allies.\n\nAl Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)\n\nAlso known as\n\nTanzim Qaedat bi-Bilad al-Maghrab al-Islami, Tanzim al-Qa´ida fi bilad al-Maghreb al-Islamiya, The Organization of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, Al-Qa´ida Organisation in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Al-Qa´ida in the Islamic Maghreb, Al-Qa´ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, al-Qaïda dans les pays du Maghreb islamique, Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC), Groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat\n\nDescription\n\nAQIM is a militant Sunni Islamist extremist group which originated as the Groupe Islamique Armeé (Armed Islamic Group or GIA), an armed Islamist resistance movement to the secular Algerian government. In 1998, a splinter of the GIA declared its independence from the original group, believing the GIA's brutal tactics were hurting the Islamist cause. The Groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat (Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC), as the new group named itself, gained support from the Algerian population by vowing to continue fighting the government while avoiding the indiscriminate killing of civilians. The GSPC officially merged with Al Qaida in September 2006, subsequently changing its name to AQIM, and announcing the name change in January 2007. Since its merger with Al Qaida, AQIM has also adopted a global jihad ideology, employing conventional terrorist tactics including guerilla-style ambushes and the use of improvised explosive devices against military personnel and truck bombs against government targets, in Algeria and West African countries. In 2016, 29 people were killed, including six Canadians, in an AQIM attack on a hotel in Burkina Faso. In March 2017, AQIM's Mali-based affiliate, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), was formed. On March 2, 2018, a coordinated attack by JNIM on the army headquarters and the French Embassy in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital, killed at least eight people and wounding more than 80 others.

Its tactics include small arms attacks, the use of improvised explosive devices, suicide bombings, and kidnappings. Boko Haram conducted a suicide bomb attack against the United Nations compound in Abuja, Nigeria in August 2011, killing 23 people. In April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped a Canadian nun and two Italian priests in Cameroon. A few days later, in Nigeria, the group kidnapped 276 schoolgirls. In 2015, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and Boko Haram renamed itself the \"Islamic States West Africa Province\". However, the Islamic State appointed Abu Musab al-Barnawi as leader of Islamic States West Africa Province, resulting in the formation of two rival factions; one loyal to Shekau operating under the Boko Haram banner, and the other (Islamic States West Africa Province) led by Barnawi. During the first nine months of 2016, Boko Haram was responsible for nearly 400 deaths in Nigeria, and approximately 850 deaths in 2017. In many of its attacks Boko Haram used children, particularly young girls, as suicide bombers. Boko Haram also repeatedly targets farmers, loggers, and herders, accusing them of passing information about the group to soldiers and the militia fighting them. In November 2020, armed assailants on motorcycles took 50 farmers from a village in northeastern Nigeria, into a building where they slit their throats. Later, additional bodies were found nearby, bringing the total number of deceased to 76. In addition, the militants abducted about a dozen women from the village.

The Caucasus Emirate has carried out terrorist activities in Russia and the North Caucasus republics that range from ambushes with small arms, targeted assassinations using snipers, improvised explosive devices, and suicide bombings. Since November 2014, many of the network's leaders have switched their allegiance to the Islamic State. On February 22, 2017, a Caucasus Emirate spokesman called for militants in Chechnya to target Russian infrastructure and military facilities. In April 2020, Russian authorities arrested three suspected members of Caucasus Emirate who had plotted an attack at a retail shopping facility in the Khanty-Mansiysk City of Lyantor in Siberia. According to a Russian news agency, the suspects were in possession of an improvised explosive device, weapons and ammunition. The Caucasus Emirate’s operational presence in North Caucasus has been in steady decline since the mid-2010s. This decline has been attributed to the Russian security services’ counterterrorism efforts, which included many senior Caucasus Emirate leaders being captured and killed.\n\nCombat 18 (C18)\n\nAlso known as\n\nN/A\n\nDescription\n\nBlood & Honour (B&H) is an international neo-Nazi network whose ideology is derived from the National Socialist doctrine of Nazi Germany.

While FARC had some urban presence, it was always an overwhelmingly rural guerrilla organisation. Originally, FARC was guided by its goal of overthrowing the current government in Colombia and replacing it with a leftist, anti-American regime that would force all United States interests out of Colombia and Latin America. FARC activities include bombings, hijackings, assassinations, and the kidnapping of Colombian officials and Westerners. In September 2016, FARC entered into a demobilization process with the Colombian government and signed a Peace Accord which formally brought an end to 52 years of armed conflict. Under the deal certain FARC commanders disarmed, demobilized, and participated in reintegration efforts and key leaders have become political actors within Colombia’s Congress. The Colombian Government has recognized that demobilized FARC members who adhere to the commitments under the 2016 Peace Accord would no longer be labelled as terrorists. In January 2021, the FARC political party changed its name to Comunes and accordingly, Comunes is not captured by this listing. While the vast majority of FARC combatants have demobilized and participate in the peace process, it is important to recognize that certain groups refused to disarm and claim to be the true continuation of FARC. For example, in August 2019, a FARC commander, Iván Márquez, called on his followers to re-take up arms, announcing a “new phase of the armed struggle” and asserting that the guerrilla group carries the same: FARC-EP (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People's Army). On June 25, 2021, a helicopter approaching the city of Cucuta with Colombian President Ivan Duque and other officials aboard was hit by bullets. A still-mobilized FARC commander took responsibility for the attack.\n\nGulbuddin Hekmatyar\n\nAlso known as\n\nGulabudin Hekmatyar, Gulbuddin Khekmatiyar, Gulbuddin Hekmatiar, Gulbuddin Hekmartyar, Gulbudin Hekmetyar, Golboddin Hikmetyar and Gulbuddin Hekmetyar\n\nDescription\n\nGulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the group Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin (HIG), promotes an extreme Islamist anti-Western ideology with the objective of overthrowing the Afghan administration and creating an Islamic state.

The Haqqani Network was the first group to adopt the use of suicide bombers for attacks in Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network uses large vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, suicide vests, and swarming attacks, which captured headlines and created doubts about the ability of Afghan forces to protect its civilians without NATO support. The Haqqani Network specializes in coordinated attacks, favours a military-centric approach, via armed struggle, committing high-profile assassination attempts, suicide attacks, and waging a war of insurgency against the West.\n\nHarakat al-Sabireen (HaS)\n\nAlso known as\n\nAl-Sabirin Movement for Supporting Palestine, Al-Sabireen Movement for Supporting Palestine, Al-Sabirin, Al-Sabireen, a-Sabrin organization, Al-Sabireen for the Victory of Palestine, HISN, HOSN, The Sabireen Movement, HESN, Movement of Those Who Endure With Patience, Movement of the Patient Ones\n\nDescription\n\nHarakat al-Sabireen (HaS) is an Iranian-backed Shia group which has operated in the Gaza Strip since 2014.
