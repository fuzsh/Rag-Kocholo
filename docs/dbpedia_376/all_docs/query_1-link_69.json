        "text": "27 June 1908: Creation of the Ritz Development Company under the stewardship of Cesar Ritz (1850-1918) - the name was franchised. The idea is to create a luxury hotel in Madrid (see also \"Legendary Stories\").\n\n14 May 1910: Building work finishes - at a cost of 5.628.53O,08 pesetas.\n\n2 October 1910: Alfonso XIII, along with the royal family, certain ministers and the Liberal Mayor of Madrid, José Francos Rodrígues, inaugurates the Hotel Ritz in Madrid.\n\n1926: The Belgian Georges Marquet buys the hotel and sits on the board of directors. The Marquet dynasty will own The Ritz for over 50 years.\n\n1926: A young Salvador Dali stops at the hotel to get a haircut and enjoy a cocktail.\n\n1936-39: During the Spanish Civil War, the hotel is converted into a military hospital.\n\n1947: Death of Georges Marquet. His son Georges Marquet II takes the reins.\n\n1978: Ex-Mayor of Barcelona Enrique Maso take charge. By this time the hotel has fallen into some degree of neglect in the hands of Georges Marquet's grandson, Georges Marquet III, who is not interested in stewarding a hospitality empire.\n\n1981: Trusthouse Forte buys the Hotel Ritz. The English company has some 900 establishments around the world, including 18 exclusive hotels of the calibre of The Ritz.\n\n1982: John M. Macedo, a native of Gibraltar, becomes general manager. He starts a 2,000 million peseta renovation programme to restore the hotel to its former glory.\n\n1991: Alfonso Jordán becomes general manager. 1990: The Ritz is the most expensive hotel in Europe.\n\n1996: The Forte group sells off some of its hotels, including The Ritz. Pablo Kessler is now in control. 2003; 26th April: In a 50/50 joint venture with Omega Capital, a major Spanish investment company, Oriental Express Hotels acquires The Ritz. It is OEH’s second hotel in Spain, following the acquisition of La Residencia, Mallorca in 2002. April: The hotel becomes an Orient Express property and Swiss Anton Küng becomes general manager.\n\n2015, 22 May: Mandarin Oriental takes over the management of the hotel, the Saudi Arabian business group Olayan takes over all Ritz shares. Christian Tavelli is the new general manager.\n\nOn 23 June 1908, Ena bore Alfonso a second child, the Infante Jaime, who was born in the royal palace of Granja de San Ildefonso in Segovia. Around that time, Alfonso called on Luis de Cuadra y Raul, the Marquis of Guadalmina, and suggested that he found a company to construct the hotel Madrid needed. The Marquis of Guadalmina had – as his king – made the acquaintance of the establishments of a certain César Ritz, both in London and in Paris. They were aware of a sort of ‘franchise project’ called Ritz-Carlton in New York, and of course he knew the Carlton Hotel, which had opened in Pairs some years earlier.\n\nThe hotelier, César Ritz, was contacted in Paris. It was his good name, his experience and his golden touch the Spanish hotel developers were seeking. And so the Compania de Desarollo Ritz (Ritz Development Company) was offcially registered before the notary don Antonio Turón y Bosca on 27 June 1908. The first board of directors were Excmo. Sr. Marqués de Guadalmina (chairman), his directors Sr. Marqués de Ivanrey, Excmo. Sr. Conde de Albiz, Sr. Barón Günzburg, Excmo. Sr. D. Estanislao de Urquijo, Mr. H.V. Higgins, Sr. D. Luis de Errazu y Rubio, Sr. D. Eusebio Güell y López and Mr. W. Harris, as secretary we find in the registry Sr. D. Mariano de Cuadra y Raoul, his assistant was Sr. D. José Asensio y Caro. The first meeting of the board took place two days later, on 29 June 2008.\n\nHence, 2008 is often spotted as the opening date of the Ritz. In fact, it was the year when its mother company was conceived. The company had a capitalisation of 2.5 million pesetas, obtained by a share issue to the value of 2.7 million. The share certificates issued were each composed of twenty coupons costing 35 céntimos each, printed in three different colours by the Casa Raoul Péant. The aim of the new venture was to stated in the second article of the founding act: ‘The principal objective of the Company is the construction and exploitation of a first class Hotel in Madrid, similar in importance to the Ritz Hotel in London and the Carlton and Ritz in Paris.’ The dice had been rolled.\n\nThe formal opening took place on the evening of Sunday, 2 October 1910.\n\nThe inauguration gala was one of those occasions whose memory gets passed on from generation to generation. The evening was presided over by the Spanish royal family. King Alfonso XIII, his queen, Ena, and the royal princesses and princes and the queen mother were greeted by Prime Minister Canalejas and four cabinet members, who stood next to the main door, which led out to Plaza de la Lealtad. Also present were the Civil Governor, Sr. Méndez Alanís and the Marquess de Comillas and the respective wives. The board members of the Compañia de Deasrollo Ritz, the enterprise behind the new hotel, proudly presented their hotel to the dazzled crowd, their president, the Marquis of Guadalmina, personally led the dignitaries of the night around. In the background, the Cíngaros Orchestra was playing, conducted by Señor Boldi. It was magical.\n\nJust as Alfonso XIII had desired, the Ritz was truly a hotel fit for a king. The hotel boasted a ballroom, a dining room and a smoking room, as well as a host of salons and suites. The most innovative feature was the winter garden on the bottom floor, with palms and other plants, covered by a magnificent glass ceiling. The real beauty of the Ritz was in the details. For instance, there were some 15,000 pieces of Goldsmith’s of England silver cutlery and 20,000 pieces of crockery in Limoges porcelain, a French region by that name (today, the hotel still serves on fine china sporting Limoge design). Robinson S Cleaver of Ireland had produced the table linen, Enrique Loewe, official supplier to the Spanish crown, had taken care of any leather. Two kilometres of carpets from the Real Fábrica de Tapices, the royal manufacturer, ran through the hotel’s rooms, salons and corridors. There were four or five bathrooms per floor, in addition to the sinks in the rooms. Each floor had a telephone cabin, just next to the elevators. In winter the hotel would be comfortable and warm, with steam heating systems in the bedrooms and warm air flowing through the lower floor. In summer, a system of irrigating the glass roof of the winter garden would keep temperatures fresh."
