        "text": "What You are Looking for is in the Library by Michiko Aoyama\n\nI love books about books that have cats on the cover, and this is no exception. This book is so charming and lovely. The library is nestled in the Hatori community house. It’s where the librarian helps those in need of books and maybe a little guidance. Enter 5 people of various ages who find their lives lacking. They know the life they are living isn’t the one they want, but they can't figure out how to change it. That changes after they talk with the librarian. I highly recommend reading this if you loved \"Before the Coffee gets Cold.\"\n\n—Michelle, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Making of Yolanda la Bruja by Lorraine Avila\n\nThis enchanting contemporary YA is about Yolanda, an Afro Latina experiencing her bruja initiation through visions while struggling to prove a new student with white supremacist ideology will endanger her community. Loved the themes of self-care, community care, restorative justice, and disability pride!\n\n—Cynthia, Information & Reader Services\n\nBookshops & Bonedust by Travis Baldree\n\nBaldree does it again in this prequel to his award winning and very beloved cozy fantasy Legends and Lattes. This low stakes high fantasy will be a welcome visit from an old friend for those who are already fans and a perfect introduction to new friends for those just joining the fun. It's warm, sweet, and something often in short supply in fantasy literature, kind. Quick read and a good choice for fans of the lighthearted comradery seen in the latest Dungeons and Dragons movie.\n\n—Aaron, Information & Reader Services\n\nProphet by Sin Blanché and Helen Macdonald\n\nIt’s Barbenheimer meets mutual pining. It’s X-Files fanfiction with the serial numbers shaved off. It’s Shakespearean interpersonal drama using the abandoned set of Movie America. Prophet is a story about British civilian and walking disaster Sunil Rao, who can tell truth from lies the minute they’re told; and Adam Rubenstein, the career US Air Force monolith who hasn’t met an emotion he can’t repress. Adam’s assigned to protect Rao again as they uncover the mysterious substance Prophet, which causes victims to magically generate childhood objects and go into comas as soon as they touch them. If they don’t find out who’s making it and how it’s spreading, the whole world might fall victim to its own nostalgia. Add to this that Rao and Adam have feelings for each other that they both think the other denies, and you have the twisting, aching longing permeating every page of this book as the clock ticks down towards apocalypse. It’s slow-burn romance with a sci-fi wrapper and it works better than it should. I’d even recommend the audiobook version, even though the British narrator’s American accent is the human equivalent of the “you tried” star.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nHow to Love Your Daughter by Hila Blum\n\nPsychological suspense builds as a seemingly devoted mother tries to determine why her adult daughter has lied to her about virtually every aspect of her life, even what country she lives in. Though the mother allows her daughter to think her lies have gone undetected, she is relentless in re-tracing her steps as a parent, desperate to see how her relationship with her only child went awry. There is a sense that all relationships carry both an element of uncertainty and the possibility of making profound mistakes.\n\n—Cynthia, Youth Services\n\nThe Serpent and the Wings of Night by Carissa Broadbent\n\nI’ll be honest: I HATE that I like this book so much. It’s supposedly TikTok famous, which means I thought I would hate it immediately. Instead I was so sucked in I didn’t put the book down for hours. It’s a political dark romance focusing on Oraya, the adopted human daughter of a vampire king in a continent of competing vampire kingdoms and competing clans within them. The book opens with her murdering a vampire! Not even a plot-important vampire, either! It’s just one of her nightly kills to protect the small human population and which keeps her emotions in check. And the action continues non-stop from there. Oraya jumps at the chance to compete in a winner-gets-to-live tournament where the champion also gets a favor from the death goddess. She’s the only human competing, but there’s one vampire competitor from a rival clan who’s kind, unlike any vamp she’s ever met before. When he offers a temporary alliance, she agrees just to survive. Instead she starts to open up to this stranger, putting their hearts in both emotional and physical danger. It’s twisty and political, well-rounded and complex, with no easy answer or clear hero. It’s got no right to be as good as it is.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nStars in Your Eyes by Kacen Callendar\n\nGorgeous romance by acclaimed children’s author Callendar in their first book aimed at adults. Mattie is an actor with a golden retriever image who’s been cast in a romcom opposite Logan, the prototypical Hollywood bad boy. It’s less than a week into filming before Logan jeopardizes the movie by getting into another fight. The producers think having Mattie and Logan fake a relationship might save their romcom. They soon find the other’s not quite as they’ve been portrayed in the media, and it soon becomes more than just a fake relationship. But they can’t save each other—they need to save themselves. I loved this because it’s struck the balance of a “how to do healthy relationships” story while also containing gut-clenching twists and turns that don’t come at the expense of the building narrative. Little asides from other sources, including tweets and the best bad fanfiction I’ve ever read, set it apart and get you to really feel the pressure the leads are under. Sweet and honest and hits like a punch to the ribs.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Haunting of Alejandra by V. Castro\n\nLiving in a world that demands children from those able to birth a child without providing adequate support is a horror. This book describes how community care exists through the living and the power and resilience of our ancestors. Read if you enjoy extreme imagery, heart pounding drama, modern ghost stories, cathartic release, and a celebration of women.\n\n—Cynthia, Information & Reader Services\n\nBirnam Wood by Eleanor Cattan\n\nI was captivated by this tense, richly drawn eco-thriller. Cattan's long-awaited follow-up to her Booker-Prize winning The Luminaries is populated by fully realized (and deeply flawed) characters, monkey-wrenching politics, unchecked Randian greed, misguided idealism, and (naturally) the rare, orange-fronted parakeet. Birnam Wood's explosive denouement will leave you gasping, and doubles as a grim warning against climbing into bed with the despicably wealthy and a (related) call to action to avert climate catastrophe.\n\n—Katharine, Membership Services\n\nThe Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty\n\nA legendary retired pirate queen is pulled back in for one final job (through guile and guilt) and needs to lean on every bit of her years of experience to get it done. An amazing cast of characters and a breezy writing style make this a great read.\n\n—William, Membership Services\n\nTomb Sweeping by Alexandra Chang\n\nSlightly unsettling, slice-of-life stories, mostly neutral but complex, mostly from the point of view of women of Chinese descent. Some take place in China, others in Philly or the Bay Area. There's a great short one with two women coworkers having a strained conversation about their cats, and a third coworker's cat, but they're really just talking about each other. \"Ruth's cat is a snobby b*tch.\"\n\n—Kelly, Youth Services\n\nOrgan Meats by K-Ming Chang\n\nWomen are dogs, dogs are women, people grow up on the underside of islands, and your bones can transform into mushrooms if you wander away from your body for too long. It’s another surrealist masterwork by Chang, who doesn’t shy away from the gross and weird while also holding insights on the sacred, the familial, and the romantic. There’s a tiny plot here, but the most focus is on how the world feels like dream in progress. If you like poetry, feel like Toni Morrison is too literal, or just want a quick vibes-based journey through two generations of dog-women, give this a shot.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nPlay the Fool by Lina Chern\n\nKatie True, black sheep of her solidly middle-class family has exactly one notable talent: reading Tarot cards. Unfortunately for her (and her family's expectations) she hasn't figured out a way to live off of that, instead lurching from low-paying job to job to try, and fail, to make ends meet. Then she accidentally does a card reading for a man who just killed someone (or did he?) and finds herself unable to walk away from the murder investigation, no matter how many times she nearly gets arrested. A fun, fast-paced debut by a Lake County author, this is a great pick for fans of the TV show Psych.\n\n—Rebecca, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Guest by Emma Cline\n\nA twentysomething woman is dating an older, wealthy man who lives in the Hamptons. Lacking the education, income, and social training that is a given in this circle, her outsider status allows her to make incisive class observations even as she tries mightily to convince people that she shares their background. The reader walks a tightrope with her as she makes blunders that can have serious consequences, always living in fear of being found out and worse. This fast, riveting book is like a beach read with substance.\n\n—Cynthia, Youth Services\n\nScorched Grace by Margaret Douaihy\n\nA chain-smoking lesbian nun solves crimes in a New Orleans neo-noir. I could end my review right there—and for some people, that’s enough—but what really draws me to this book isn’t the mystery, but the voice. Sister Holiday (the gay nun in question) talks like a stew of a sailor, a priest, and every noir detective poured into the shape of a person. I would read a book about her eating cereal. She’s observant, tough, smart, and relentless, which means she constantly butts heads with the gorgeous detective assigned to investigate the mysterious fires around the church and the parish school. Perfect for noir lovers, mystery fans, or anyone interested in hearing the most distinct voice I’ve seen in a while.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nRipe by Sarah Rose Etter\n\nTrapped in a corporate hellscape, Cassie deals with the horrifying day-to-day of toxic tech company hustle culture. From her fancy office in San Francisco, where rapid-fire productivity and is valued above all else, she can see abject poverty and hopelessness on the streets. She is accompanied everywhere she goes by a black hole which grows and shrinks depending on what she experiences. This book is extremely well-done and thought-provoking, and if you're looking for something to ruin your day, look no further!\n\n—Kelly, Youth Services\n\n10 Things That Never Happened by Alexis Hall\n\nA sunshine and a grump fall in love, but the grump is just overly protective of his heart and the sunshine is fun because he’s got nothing left to lose. Sam comes all the way to London to talk to boss Jonathan only to find out he’s fired. So when Sam falls into a furniture display, he thinks it’s no harm to faking amnesia along with his real mild concussion. He didn’t count on Jonathan feeling guilty and taking him in while he recovers, or on Jonathan starting to show a human side under his all-business façade. Now Sam’s got fuzzy feelings and a big secret, and it all comes to a head at the big company Christmas party. This one actually avoids the easy tropes and instead examines the romance slowly and naturally. Sweet and interesting and full of delightfully deranged optimistic nihilism.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nReproduction by Louisa Hall\n\nThis novel about the absolute strangeness of making new human life begins with the (pregnant) narrator attempting to write a novel about Mary Shelley, while “parts of her story detached themselves from the page and clung to my life.” Covering pregnancy, loss, infertility, and childbirth, the story moves quickly, and the combination of weirdness and ordinariness is wonderful. I loved this book as much as Weather by Jenny Offill.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nHow to Sell a Haunted House by Grady Hendrix\n\nHendrix strikes again. Taxidermized squirrels, possessed clown puppets, repressed childhood trauma, and the numbing banal horror of how loss can mess with estranged family members left behind when a parent passes. If you are looking for a fun creepy and darkly humorous read, you can't go wrong with this one.\n\n—Aaron, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe God of Endings by Jacqueline Holland\n\nIn 1830s New York, Anna is a child in a rural community beset by tuberculosis. After she falls ill, she is rescued by her grandfather, who makes her immortal like him. But her grandfather is a vampire, and Anna will spend the rest of the novel struggling with the consequences of his gift. While we see her life play out in flashbacks throughout the book, the other part of the novel focuses on Anna's present life in 1984, where she lives in Upstate New York as Collette LeSange and runs an elite fine arts preschool for upper class children. Her well-ordered life is turned upside down with the arrival in her school of Leo Hardiman, a gifted child from a troubled family, who will change everything for her. This novel is best described as a vampire story for people who don't like vampire stories. The word \"vampire\" is never actually mentioned, and the only signs that Anna is a vampire at all are that she survives on blood, is immortal, and is self-healing. The book's true concern is what it means to live, who gets to live and what it means to exist in this world. This is a very emotional read.\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nMimi's Tales of Terror by Junji Ito, Hirokatsu Kihara and Ichiro Nakayama\n\nIf you like horror, you're in for a treat. These nine incredibly creepy stories are from a book of Japanese urban legends, and horror manga master Junji Ito has brought them to life with his signature grotesque imagery. All the stories center on a girl named Mimi, who keeps running into all sorts of terrifying situations and can't seem to catch a break.\n\n—Kelly, Youth Services\n\nDon’t Fear the Reaper by Stephen Graham Jones (Indian Lake Trilogy #2)\n\nA sequel to 2021 pick “My Heart is a Chainsaw”. When our narrator Jade returns to the town of Proofrock 4 years after the first book, she finds people still healing from that book’s bloodshed. Many of them turned to Jade’s love of slasher movies to recover, which might let her fit in for the first time—except a convicted serial killer is set loose on the town as soon as she arrives. Her encyclopedic knowledge of horror let her escape mostly-whole from the last book, so surely a horror-savvy town can defeat a killer more easily. But that assumes everyone’s on the side of survival. Stephen Graham Jones is a legend among mortals. He weaves a story about the messiness of healing, the scars of love, and being a superfan among superfans, all while letting the blood drip down the page. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to feel like their grief and healing are being seen while the body count keeps rising.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nMaeve Fly by C.J. Leede\n\nMaeve Fly is a force to be reckoned with. This book made my brain just want to stay in this LA where it is perpetually Halloween, creepy dolls pop up everywhere, and all the decorations are made from real bones.\n\n—Louise, Youth Services\n\nTerrace Story by Hilary Leichter\n\nReading Terrace Story is a little like looking through a kaleidoscope: One set of components is always present, but from one chapter to the next they shift and rearrange to create dizzying new patterns. The result is a playful novel of tremendous depth that will turn your brain into exciting and unexpected new shapes. A surreal romp for fans of Donald Barthelme or Roald Dahl's stories for adults.\n\n—Katharine, Membership Services\n\nExtended Stay by Juan Martinez\n\nCerebral, visceral horror by a local author! This is the first novel by Martinez, but it’s a hell of an opener. Alvaro survived a roadside execution that claimed almost all of his family, so he leaves Colombia for the US with his surviving sister Carmen. They’re barely scraping by in Las Vegas, where he works at the Hotel Alicia and she goes to school. His manager starts to give him more and more responsibility at the Alicia and a heftier paycheck. But the hotel isn’t remotely what it seems, and there are things under the Alicia that are getting hungrier for something that Alvaro can’t yet provide.\n\nWhat I love about this book is not only that it’s a well-executed horror, but that it messes with your mind as a reader, too. Sometimes you’ll be in the middle of a dream-logic scenario only to drop you into the PTSD Alvaro feels about seeing his family die. Or you’ll be in a naturalistic scene and suddenly someone starts to walk out of the wall. The narrator addresses the reader and implies that they’ve changed the story for you. It’s magnificently unsettling, mind-bending, spine-chilling horror done masterfully.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nPast Lying by Val McDermid\n\nThe seventh book in McDermid's Karen Pirie series opens in Edinburgh in April 2020, during the heart of the Covid-19 lockdowns. Karen and her team of cold case investigators are stuck at home when a source at the National Library contacts them about a possible lead on a murder case found in the recently archived papers of a deceased crime novelist. Once the team gets ahold of the relevant manuscript, it's game on. This is a riveting read, made even more impressive by the fact that I hadn't read any of the previous six books in the series (the barrier to entry is very low). McDermid utilizes the lockdown setting perfectly, showing both how difficult it is to investigate a crime during a pandemic while avoiding any sensationalizing of that difficult time. Finally, by focusing the mystery on two rival crime writers, McDermid allows herself to poke a little fun at her industry—and the result is a very good time for the reader.\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nI Am Homeless if This Is Not My Home by Lorrie Moore\n\nThis book starts weird, normals up a bit, and then gets downright surreal. It’s about grief and death and one of the main characters in a major section is a talking corpse. But it’s great because Lorrie Moore is writing it and never does the story get out of control. Going along for the ride is very rewarding.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nThe Vulnerables by Sigrid Nunez\n\nSigrid Nunez is quickly becoming an automatic read for me. I have loved her 2 previous books and this did not disappoint! Set during the early days of New York’s covid lockdowns the female narrator finds herself with two unlikely roommates, a troubled college student and a parrot named Eureka. Between musings of history and humanity, the two human roommates slowly learn to get along and even perform small acts of kindness to get them through the bad days. Though it takes place during hard times, the story is very hopeful and uplifting. Beautifully written as I expect from Nunez. 😊\n\n—Michelle, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Rachel Incident by Caroline O'Donoghue\n\nRachel meets James at their bookstore job, and they become immediate best friends. Inseparable, the two decide to rent an apartment together while Rachel finishes her degree. It's 2009, and the financial crash isn't the only thing upending Rachel's life. While she makes the slow realization that finding work in an economic crisis is a job in itself, she's also falling for her professor, Dr. Fred Byrne. But married Fred is falling for someone else, and Rachel finds herself stuck in the middle of his illicit affair while trying to find love, and work, of her own. This book is perfect for fans of Sally Rooney.\n\n—Marissa, Youth Services\n\nHoneybees and Distant Thunder by Riku Onda\n\nBy far the best book I read all year, this is the story of four competitors in the Yoshigae Piano Competition in Japan. Aya Eiden is a child prodigy who is attempting a comeback years later, Masaru Carlos Levi Anatole is a brilliant Japanese Peruvian Juilliard student who knew Aya when they were children, Jin Kazama is an untested 16-year-old prodigy who doesn't own a piano, and Akashi Takashima, the oldest competitor, is trying to make his musical dreams come true before it's too late. Immersive, suspenseful, and brilliant, the novel takes you inside the competition from these perspectives, as well as that of the judges, stage manager, various audience members, a few other competitors and a composer. Onda has a background in classical music, and it shows in her vivid descriptions of the pieces performed and her clear affection for her subject. She almost dares you to finish the book without a new appreciation for music and all it is capable of (and yes, there is a Spotify playlist of all the pieces mentioned in the book).\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nThe September House by Carissa Orlando\n\nDarkly humorous, yet creepy and terrifying, The September House is expertly plotted and frighteningly addictive. This book has everything readers seek from a gothic horror novel. A creepy house, ghosts, demons, a priest, killer birds, and oh so much blood…\n\nBut just in September.\n\nMargaret and Hal buy their dream house, a 19th century Victorian with a turret and wrap around porch. Every September, objects move around the house and mutilated strangers appear. The walls weep blood and constant screams can be heard. Everything returns to normal for the rest of the year. Margaret is used to being the caretaker. After all, she learned how to survive an abusive marriage. Then the couple encounter Master Vale, the demon-like man in the basement and Hal disappears. A month after his disappearance, Margaret’s daughter Katherine comes to the house to find her father. But did she have to visit in September?\n\nOrlando explores themes of abuse and survival in this stellar debut. Hitchcockian and deeply disturbing, The September House is one of the best debut gothic novels of the year.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nNight Wherever We Go by Tracey Rose Peyton\n\nSet on a small Texas plantation in 1852, this novel captures the experiences, inner thoughts, and valiant efforts of 6 enslaved women staging a covert rebellion against their captors. What I loved about this book was the compelling narrative structure and detailed research that gave me insight into each character’s motivation. While devastating to read, I was illuminated to an aspect of history that still informs and affects reproductive justice and the lives of Black women.\n\n—Cynthia, Information & Reader Services\n\nA Light Most Hateful by Haley Piper\n\nA sudden lightning storm turns everyone in the mountain town of Chapel Hill into shuffling mannequins reciting other people’s memories. Everyone, that is, except Olivia, who decides to save her best friend Sunflower from the storm. Haley Piper is a genius of horror. She takes a seed of a normal human emotion—loneliness, unrequited love, being sick of everyone in town—and spins it into something monstrous. It’s a gory, twisted, beautiful cosmic horror made for anyone who’s enjoyed Steven King.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe End of Drum-Time by Hanna Pylväinen\n\nHere is my tip for getting through the Illinois winters: find a good story about somewhere even colder, and you’ll feel better. And here is such a book! In 1851, Lutherans are attempting to convert the Sámi to Christianity, while the Sámi are also being squeezed culturally and economically, as the nations surrounding them enact border regulations that interfere with the movement of their reindeer herds across their traditional lands. A pair of star-crossed lovers emerge from the two groups, but because every character is living through upheaval, everyone has an interesting story.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nWe Could Be So Good by Cat Sebastian\n\nSebastian latest queer historical romance novel is a delight from start to finish, about two newspaper reporters in 1950's Manhattan. Working class, workaholic Nick is busy trying to unravel a dangerous story about police corruption, so the last thing he needs is to be babysitting bumbling, newbie reporter Andy, who just so happens to be the newspaper owner's only son. It's a shame then, that the two quickly become friends, and then something more. But how do two men from such different walks of life find their happy ever after? Sebastian excels at gently poking at traditional romance novel tropes while still providing satisfying happy endings. Highly recommended for fans of Alexis Hall.\n\n—Rebecca, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Only One Left by Riley Sager\n\nThe Only One Left is Riley Sager’s BEST thriller to date! This twisty Gothic mystery will leave even savvy thriller readers gasping until the very last page. In 1983, Kit McDeere lost her job as a home-health aide when one of her patients died under suspicious circumstances. Kit is given one last opportunity of employment, a job that will require her to care for Lenora Hope, the longtime suspect in the murder of her whole family. She accepts the job working at Hope’s End, a decaying mansion on a cliff, but soon suspects things are not as they appear. Secrets, lies, and deception run amuck in Hope’s End. Who actually killed the Hope family? Will Kit find the answers before the decrepit mansion collapses?\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nUnorthodox Love by Heidi Shertok\n\nJewish romance with an Orthodox Jewish woman protagonist! Penina is considered an impossible marriage prospect because of her infertility, so she’s resigned herself to being a spinster aunt forever. It’s made even worse with the arrival of handsome Sam, the new owner of the jewelry store she works at, who is untouchable both literally and figuratively. That doesn’t make their professional relationship or attraction any easier, especially once Penina gets an offer from a nice gay Orthodox man for a one-year fake marriage in exchange for enough money to keep her sister from losing her house. If you’ve ever enjoyed an Amish romance, a Jane Austen story, or another love story where touching is absolutely forbidden, you’ll love the first in (I hope!) a new wave of Orthodox romance.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nMother-Daughter Murder Night by Nina Simon\n\nSimply a delightful cozy mystery. Perfect for fans of Osman's Thursday Murder Club series. Instantly likeable nuanced characters, witty and fun. If you've ever watched a program like The Gilmore Girls and thought to yourself \"what this show needs is a murder mystery for this family to solve, this is your book.\n\n—Aaron, Information & Reader Services\n\nBeyond That, The Sea by Laura Spence-Ash\n\nThis novel tells the story of a young girl whose parents send her from London during WWII to live with a family in America. Over time, she becomes part of the American family. When the war is over, she returns to London where she must now navigate life without the American family she was so much a part of. The story spans decades as we see how each character’s life unfolds in this beautifully written book. I’ve recommended it to everyone!\n\n—Beth, Administration\n\nEveryone in My Family Has Killed Someone by Benjamin Stevenson\n\nPerfect for fans of metafiction and Agatha Christie’s locked room mysteries, Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone can best be described as Clue meets Knives Out. Writer Ernest Cunningham attends his family reunion at a ski chalet. By the end of the trip, people will die. But as you know, everyone in Ernest’s family has killed someone, so it’s his job to figure out who killed whom and why. This cleverly plotted mystery is expertly executed. Ernest is an intrusive narrator with a witty sense of humor who attempts to spoil the mystery, but it is all good fun!\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nCamp Damascus by Chuck Tingle\n\nAlready an internet sensation (if you know, you know) Chuck Tingle debuts his first traditionally published novel with a queer, coming of age horror novel that defies all expectation. You might expect the demons to be the scary part of the book, but it's the actions of people, many of whom claim to act from love, that provide the most thought-provoking scares. Rose, the queer autistic protagonist starts out as a card-carrying member of the Kingdom of Pines, an Evangelical Christian sect best known for their terrifying success rate with conversion therapy. However, frightening encounters with unexplainable beings, and moments of intense body horror prompt Rose to start asking questions no one will answer, and eventually forces her to find her own truth. It's Rose's journey to accepting and loving her authentic self that elevates this book to something special. Truly, the only book I've read that I'd describe as 'heartwarming horror.'\n\n—Rebecca, Information & Reader Services\n\nA gay conversion camp boasts a 100% success rate, but what really happens to make this successful will flay your nerves. Tingle has mastered lurking horror that also manages to make you feel like you’ve slipped into a warm embrace. He’s best known for being an internet “inside joke”, but Tingle is ruthlessly sincere, utterly disorienting, and throws curveballs that’ll have the most experienced horror fans wondering what happens next. While it doesn’t skimp on body horror, the tenderness Tingle handles his protagonists with makes this a can’t-miss.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nMy Husband by Maud Ventura\n\nThis short novel is a tour de force in the domestic suspense genre. Winner of France’s First Novel Prize in 2021, My Husband is perfectly plotted perfection. Over the course of one week, a nameless female Parisian wife and mother psychoanalyzes her 15-year marriage to her husband. Love is her hobby of choice, as she is a desperate romantic. Or is she just neurotic, paranoid, and jealous?\n\nWhat happens when you love too intensely? Is she enough for her husband? After all, he compared her to a vulgar clementine.\n\n…and he sleeps with the shutters closed.\n\n…and he ordered the lasagna.\n\nAs relayed by her husband, the adjectives that best describe her are very beautiful, cold, in love, and observant.\n\nHow well does he really “see” her? This darkly humorous novel of obsession is psychological fiction at its best. You won't guess the phenomenal twist!\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nMy Murder by Katie Williams\n\nA futuristic sci-fi murder mystery with a killer twist! Louise, Lacy, Fern, Jasmine, and Angela are all members of the Luminols, a group of clones whose past selves were murdered by serial killer, Edward Early. The plot centers around Louise, the final murder victim before Early was caught and jailed. A new mother to nine-month-old Nova and Silas’ wife, she and the other clones are determined to find out why Early killed them.\n\nIn this Virtual Reality obsessed society, a video game is soon created about the serial killer and his murder victims. Louise and the other clones play along, hoping to uncover clues about their murders. Louise also works at The Room, a business created to mimic a banned video game room that players didn’t want to leave. Here, she wears different skins to hug and comfort patrons who pay for her service. Eventually, the clones’ investigation takes a surprising turn, and Louise must learn the painful truth about her murder. My Murder’s completely unique and original plot, engaging characters, and darkly humorous tone are captivating. I highly recommend listening to this one!\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nAndrone by Dwain Worrell\n\nPaxton is an android drone pilot whose days consist of looking through an endless desert and whose nights are spent sleepless while picking up desk duty shifts. He only rejoined the army because he wanted to make money for his girlfriend and their upcoming baby. He’d also like to know who the military is fighting, since that’s classified to the highest levels of the government. While slowly rising through the ranks, he starts to notice movement in the far-off desert where his androne stands watch. It’s a group of people unlike any he’s seen before. Where is his androne, who is he fighting, and can he really make a difference? What I really love about this is it’s military scifi that shows how boring and brain-numbing being a soldier can be, which tends to fall to the wayside in most military fiction. Though there are some interesting robot fights, the meat of the story is really in the ways Paxton gathers information about the war, the enemy, and the mission around his base while fighting through the world’s worst brain fog. It adds realism to the stakes and means every day is a potential catastrophe. Exciting and cinematic and softhearted. I recommend it to anyone who likes mecha, who’s lost sleep over a bad job, or who’s interested in a complex layered mystery.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nMy Stupid Intentions by Bernardo Zannoni, translated by Alex Andriesse\n\nArchy is a hedonistic beech marten who, upon developing the ability to read and write, discovers the troubling concepts of God and death. The rest of his life is spent struggling with this knowledge and futilely wishing to return to his carefree, animal nature. This remarkably accomplished debut by Italian wunderkind Bernardo Zannoni reads as though Wind in the Willows was written by Albert Camus. Terrific.\n\n—Katharine, Membership Services\n\nMeredith, Alone by Claire Alexander\n\nMeredith Maggs has not left her home in 1,214 days but she is not bored or lonely. Her days are filled with work, reading, complex jigsaw puzzles and baking. She gets visits from her best friend Sadie and her two children and of course the grocery delivery man. She has her online support group, her therapist, and her rescue cat Fred. But she is also haunted by memories of her dysfunctional childhood, her estrangement from her beloved older sister and a traumatic event that triggered her anxiety and depression and keeps her from stepping outside.\n\nHer life starts to change when two new friends enter her life, and an unexpected reconnection starts her on the slow journey to healing. Heartbreaking and hopeful, Meredith, Alone is a gem of a book that I devoured in two days.\n\n—Michelle, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Littlest Library by Poppy Alexander\n\nJess Metcalf decides to make some changes in her life, after she loses her job. She buys a cottage, which includes a disused telephone box, that inspires her to share her love of reading with her new neighbors.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nQueen of the Tiles by Hanna Alkaf\n\nThis book is about a murder mystery that happens at an international Scrabble tournament. There is a lot of fun word play and the characters really explain their Scrabble strategies. This was a really great book about friendship and how it is helpful to have friends with many talents as they can be a big help in solving a murder.\n\n—Maureen, Information & Reader Services\n\nLegends and Lattes by Travis Baldree\n\nThis is a low-stakes feel good big-hearted story set in a High Fantasy world, a \"Cozy Fantasy\" if you will. Weary of getting into fights and battling monsters, an orc chooses to pursue a better life by opening a coffee shop. The challenges of moving beyond her past and the obstacles she and her friends must overcome to achieve their goals will keep readers engaged and invested in the journey. Who do you want to be and what will you do to get there?\n\n—Aaron, Information & Reader Services\n\nAtomic Anna by Rachel Barenbaum\n\nIn 1986, nuclear scientist Anna Berkova is asleep in her bed at Chernobyl when the reactor melts down. At that exact moment, she is pulled through time to 1992 where she finds her estranged daughter, Molly, dying from a gunshot wound to the chest. Before she dies, Molly begs Anna to fix the disaster, save her granddaughter, Raisa, and save their family's future. A mix of science fiction, historical fiction, bildungsroman, and family drama, Atomic Anna is a powerful, moving story of three women who are trying to save themselves and their world and maybe make better choices along the way.\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nMarple: Twelve New Stories by various authors\n\nA delightful collection of new mysteries featuring the shrewdly observant Miss Marple.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nThe Art of Prophecy by Wesley Chu\n\nA young boy is prophesied to one day defeat the Eternal Khan, an immortal god-king, and save his kingdom. So far, this is standard fantasy novel fare. Except, what happens when said Eternal Khan is killed instead by a random group of soldiers on patrol while he is blind drunk? This terrific novel explores what happens to a chosen one when he's no longer of use to his country. Full of great characters, including an older, one-armed woman who happens to be the greatest grandmaster of magical martial arts alive, a psychotic shadow assassin who delights in her kills, and the chosen one himself, who as a confused, suddenly rudderless teenager is quite relatable, this novel is just pure fun.\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nThe Violence by Delilah S. Dawson\n\nThis is an empathetic, passionate love letter to people trying to break out of abusive systems with a fantastic creeping horror story and ticking-clock survival narrative layered on top of it. The Violence is a disease that causes random acts fatal violence in its sufferers, who have no idea what they have done when the outburst stops. The invisibility and deadliness of the virus cause the whole nation to lock down. But this isn't your normal pandemic fiction: it uses its premise to examine the invisible parts of society, how people manipulate systems for their own desires, and the communities people can create when everything else fails them. The story starts off with the main character figuring out how to use this virus to escape her abusive husband, but things get better—and worse—from there. If you mixed The Only Good Indians in a blender with COVID, Till Death (2021) and the WWE, you'd get a good feel for this book.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nMurder By the Book: Mysteries for Bibliophiles edited by Martin Edwards\n\nHere's another excellent mystery anthology by Mr. Edwards. Classic authors such as Ngaio Marsh, Edmund Crispin, Michael Innes, Gladys Mitchell, Nicholas Blake and others offer several entertaining stories.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nLook Closer by David Ellis\n\nDavid Ellis is a terrific local Chicago author. Nothing is what it seems in this book about greed, revenge, and dangerous obsessions. Who is conning who? Look closer, as it may be you! There are twists and turns around every corner that will shock and surprise even the savvy thriller reader!\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nLove and Saffron: A Novel of Friendship, Food, and Love by Kim Fay\n\nI loved this short and bittersweet book about two women who develop a friendship through corresponding via letters during the 1960s.The book tells the story of Joan and Immy -- one is a young woman starting her career and her adult life, the other is an older woman. an established magazine columnist who's been married for many years. Through their correspondence and ensuing friendship, their worlds are expanded and enhanced. The subtitle of the book, “a novel of Friendship, Food, and Love”, says it all!\n\n—Beth, Administration\n\nDaisy Darker by Alice Feeney\n\nYou are cordially invited to the Darker family reunion! A palm reader once told Nana that she wouldn’t live past 80 years old. Convinced this is her last birthday, she invites her estranged family members to Sea Glass to celebrate. The Darker family are a miserable, selfish bunch, who only care about themselves and how much money they have. Everyone has their own reason for attending the party. When one family member is found murdered every hour, the rest must solve the puzzle before they wind up dead. In a family filled with devastating secrets, no one will go unpunished. It is a fantastic gothic tale and murder mystery filled with domestic drama and suspense. Alice Feeney has done it again! You do not want to be tardy to this party.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nJust Like Home by Sarah Gailey\n\nSarah Gailey’s Just Like Home is a disturbing Gothic Horror thriller. This book makes the reader squirmy and uncomfortable, yet it intrigues until the very end with its clever and thought-provoking themes. Can love and hate exist together? What makes a person good? Can hope and desperation be a liability? Are all men evil? Vera Crowder is about to find out, as she is coming home for two reasons: To clear out the house her dad built and to watch her mother die. It has been 12 years since Vera left Marion, New York. She couldn’t escape fast enough after a true crime book is published about her family with information she unknowingly provided. What happened inside the Crowder house all those years ago? Vera must discover the house’s secrets to find a way to move on with her life.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nA Career in Books: A Novel about Friends, Money, and the Occasional Duck Bun by Kate Gavino\n\nThis graphic novel reads like a memoir, in that it feels very personal and doesn’t follow a strongly-formed plot. The story follows three Asian-American friends/roommates as they navigate various book-related jobs in New York. Maybe it does have extra appeal for bookish people, but I’m recommending it because I felt happy every time I picked it up. I liked these characters, and I really liked reading about them.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nThe Woman in the Library by Sulari Gentill\n\nA great mystery who done it. The story is set in Boston when 4 random individuals are brought together by a scream they hear in the Boston Public Library. Excellent twist and turns along with great stories within stories. It keeps you guessing to the end.\n\n—Stephanie, Information & Reader Services\n\nHawk Mountain by Conner Habib\n\nThis is a psychological thriller that keeps you unsettled from the first page and doesn't let go until long after the book ends. What happens to someone who's every attempt at emotion has been met with violence or neglect, and then another person tries to worm their way into their life and expose their vulnerabilities? Bad, bad things. Todd's at the beach with his son when his high school tormentor, Jack, shows up and asks Todd if he would mind grabbing some food since it's been so long—and maybe giving him a place to stay while he's down on his luck. What happens from there is an odd mix of tender and bleak, emotional and repressed, and entirely unpredictable. If you want something brutal, complex, and twisty, give this a shot.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nA Lady for a Duke by Alexis Hall\n\nHall is one of the best romance writers out there, and his newest books are no exception. This is a slow-burn friends-to-lovers romance about two damaged people finding a safe place to heal within each other. Viola is new to presenting herself publicly as the woman she's always been, and has little idea of the things she should be doing as a lady, accidentally creating scandal for those she's around; Gracewood is an alcoholic Waterloo veteran plagued with flashbacks of the friend he thought he lost. They slowly reveal their scars over the course of the book and realize they can finally find someone who accepts them wholly. It's sweet, sincere, charming, well-researched, and fresh.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nA Caribbean Heiress in Paris by Adriana Herrera\n\nThis is both meticulously-researched historical fiction and a great romance. Historical romances can be incredibly predictable, but this is a refreshing look at what the genre could be. Two distillery owners meet at the Paris 1889 Exposition and realize they will both soon lose their businesses—unless they find themselves married. Naturally, they agree to marry each other to keep themselves afloat, and their relationship deepens from there. Despite the common premise, this is a rare romance book that has under-explored history, emotionally honest characters, and real threats to both their work and their happiness. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical fiction as well as regular romance readers.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Servies\n\nMotherthing by Ainslie Hogarth\n\nAinslie Hogarth explores the human desire to be loved and mothered in this dark highly original domestic horror novel. In Abby’s search for unconditional love, she must figure out what it means to be a good woman. An opal ring, a 1930’s cookbook, creepy mystics, and loving couches all provide guidance in Abby’s ambitious endeavor. She will do absolutely ANYTHING to prevent being abandoned again.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nOne’s Company by Ashley Huston\n\nIn the aftermath of severe trauma, a young woman, Bonnie, takes refuge in the TV show \"Three’s Company\"--eventually recreating the world of the show so that she can live inside it. This book has no easy answers to trauma recovery, if recovering is even what Bonnie is doing, but it is fascinating, even entertaining, and an amazingly good book, especially for a debut novel—one of the best books I read this year.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nThe Weight of Blood by Tiffany D. Jackson\n\nI love Stephen King's Carrie. This book is Carrie but with race relations thrown in. The story centers around Maddy, a biracial outcast at her school in Georgia, which is going to host its first ever racially integrated prom. I thought this book was nothing short of phenomenal. It is SO well written, the characters are SO developed and believable, the plot is SO interesting, and there's a HUGE heart at the center of this story that I think is lacking in Carrie.\n\n—Kelly, Youth Services\n\nThe World We Make by N.K. Jemisin\n\nA very satisfying conclusion to the author’s \"Great Cities\" duology which began with The City We Became. The four time Hugo Award winning author is frequently described as, arguably, one of the most important voices in contemporary speculative fiction with good cause. Her talents as a wordsmith and storyteller are on full display in her latest. The World We Make is both an entertaining story that celebrates the power of compassion and community and powerful commentary about many of the modern day evils we face today.\n\n—Aaron, Information & Reader Services\n\nTrespasses by Louise Kennedy\n\nIn her debut novel, Kennedy tells the story of a doomed love affair in a town on the outskirts of Belfast. Her concise, almost terse style is peppered with Irish slang, and she vividly evokes the day-to-day atmosphere in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. A neighbor who appears to be doing calisthenics--dropping to the ground each morning before leaving for work—is in fact checking the underside of his car for bombs. The young Catholic parochial schoolteacher and the Protestant barrister twice her age know that their affair can’t end well, but the way it does end is surprising and unsettling.\n\n—Karen, Information & Reader Services\n\nA Botanist's Guide to Parties & Poisons by Kate Khavari\n\nThe new research assistant, Saffron Everleigh, finds it difficult to be taken seriously at the University College London. She becomes embroiled in a murder that takes place during a dinner party, and involves her mentor Dr. Maxwell.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nWhat Moves the Dead by T. Kingfisher\n\nKingfisher's fast-paced novella is a fleshed out (pun very much intended) retelling of The Fall of the House of Usher. You don't need to go into it with any knowledge of the original Poe short story, just an appreciation for spooky houses, queer characters, environmental horror stories, and ideally a strong stomach. Fans of Silvia Moreno-Garcia's Mexican Gothic will find much to enjoy.\n\n—Rebecca, Information & Reader Services\n\nWoman, Eating by Claire Kohda\n\nLydia is a young mixed-race vampire who is living away from her mother for the first time in a windowless art studio in London. She contemplates her place in the world as a vampire, which her mother has taught her is a shameful existence, and reckons with the fact that she must subsist on blood rather than the human food she longs to try.\n\n—Kelly, Youth Services\n\nAn Unthinkable Thing by Nicole Lundrigan\n\nAn Unthinkable Thing is a heart wrenching and disturbing character driven domestic suspense novel. Lundrigan explores themes of infidelity, social class, and motherhood while depicting the post WWII era. In the summer of 1958, 11-year-old Tommie Ware is happy living with his aunt Celia in Lower Washbourne. His world is turned upside down after his birthday when Aunt Celia is found brutally murdered. Tommy must move in with his mother in Upper Washbourne, where she works as a live-in housekeeper for the wealthy Henneberry family. Why did Tommie’s mother give up custody? What secrets are the Henneberrys hiding? When the Henneberrys are murdered at the end of the summer, could Tommie have pulled the trigger?\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nThe Last Party by Clare Mackintosh\n\nAfter finishing this mystery, I was happy to see that it was the first volume of a new detective series by British policewoman-turned-author Clare Mackintosh. Two young detectives (Ffion Morgan from Wales and Leo Brady from England) appear to be strangers when they meet to collaborate on a murder case, but the clever opening chapter reveals the circumstances of their very first encounter. As the book goes on, we see that nearly everyone in the small Welsh town of Cym Coed has a motive for the murder and secrets to protect, including the detectives themselves.\n\n—Karen, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches by Sangu Mandanna\n\nThis fantasy romance puts an excellent twist on classic governess stories. Orphaned as a child, Mika is a witch who is compelled to keep her identity under wraps. As a result, she doesn't have close ties with anyone, except for the fans of her social media account, where she \"pretends\" to be a witch. Out of the blue, Mika is contacted by a mysterious agent with a job offer: to become a tutor to three young witches. Mika accepts the job and is thrown into the chaos of Nowhere House, as she attempts to keep her charges under control and win over the house's non-witch caretakers, including the handsome Jamie. Filled with heart and humor, this is a great book for a cozy night in.\n\n—Hannah, Youth Services\n\nOphelia After All by Racquel Marie\n\nThis teen book was a fun read. Ophelia has always been boy crazy. So much so, that her friends and family tease her about her never-ending list of crushes. When she meets Talia Sanches, she begins to question her identity in more ways than one. Marie writes an amazing character in Ophelia, but the real winner here is the group of friends you will grow to love.\n\n—Marissa, Youth Services\n\nThe Killing Code by Ellie Marney\n\nFour young women who are involved with the code breaking unit in Washington during World War II, try to discover the killer who's targeting other women in the government sector.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nWrong Place, Wrong Time by Gillian McAllister\n\nWhat would you do to save the ones you love? While waiting for her son Todd to return home from a night out, Jen Brotherhood witnesses him murder a man in the street. After he is arrested and taken to the police station that night, Jen goes to sleep and wakes up the next morning, which is the day before the murder. From then on, every night she goes to sleep, she wakes up further in the past. She is caught in a time loop and must figure out why her son committed the murder in order to prevent it from happening. Following the clues all the way to the beginning, Jen hopes to figure out the puzzle and change her son’s future. This engaging Groundhog’s Day premise will have you questioning the choices you make and their unintended consequences and will appeal to those who enjoy twisty sci-fi thrillers.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nThe Hero of this Book by Elizabeth McCracken\n\nThe narrator of this book claims she doesn’t know what autofiction is, and I’m not sure I truly do, either. But I think this is it—that is, a blending of autobiography and fiction. At any rate, it’s a touching account of the narrator (or author’s) relationship with her mother, who has passed on.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nDeath and the Conjuror by Tom Mead\n\nFans of the classic locked room mystery should be well pleased with this debut novel, first in a new series by Mysterious press. What I liked most about this title was that it was exactly what it said on the proverbial tin.\n\nA magician-turned-sleuth in 1930’s pre-war London solves three impossible crimes. When celebrity psychiatrist Anselm Rees is found dead in his locked study, with no apparent clues no witnesses, and no way the killer could have escaped unseen Scotland Yard stumped by the high profile case, calls upon retired stage magician turned sleuth Joseph Spector. Clearly the ideal choice to figure out how the seemingly impossible is possible. For who would be better to see through a murderer’s deceptions than someone practiced at the art or illusion and misdirection.\n\nIt's just such a pitch perfect homage to the golden age of mystery fiction. I appreciated the footnotes the author included in the book’s big \"someone in this room is a murderer\" reveal so that the reader could go back to see the breadcrumbs Mead laid out that they themselves may have missed in the fair play mystery. I look forward to seeing what comes next in this new book series and getting to learn more about Spector.\n\n—Aaron, Information & Reader Services\n\nNona the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir (Locked Tomb #3)\n\nThis is a series about forgiveness, love, grief, climate change, empire, arrogance, duty—and, most importantly, skeletons with swords in space. Muir is an expert in crafting books that feel completely different from each other while keeping the whole series a cohesive whole: the first book, Gideon the Ninth, is a romp narrated by a sarcastic-yet-naive jock; the second, Harrow the Ninth, is a psychological puzzle narrated by a deeply traumatized nerd. This book is something entirely different. Nona is a sweet, innocent girl who just wants a nice birthday party with her school friends, while the people who take care of her try to shield her from their ongoing life-or-death negotiations that may rely upon her for the fate of all humanity. The glimpses we get of the big-picture mystery are incredibly tantalizing, the humor that goes over Nona's head is meant to resonate deeply with the reader, and it helps answer some questions raised by the series while leaving plenty for the last installment. If you want to try the series, I highly recommend reading or listening to the books in order.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nHow High We Go In The Dark by Sequioa Nagamatsu\n\nThis dystopian science fiction novel was a slow burn but it's worth sticking with. It's a series of interwoven stories set, for the most part, in the time following a mysterious plague born from an ancient virus. Survivors are left to pick up the pieces and create a new world while grieving so many loved ones. They all do so in various ways, some of them seemingly strange and the result is a collection that takes the reader to different places within the human psyche and within the universe. One bereaved husband and father, for instance, becomes a surrogate father to a pig that has learned human speech. Another woman and her granddaughter journey into space, seeking a place to outrun ghosts and find a new home other than Earth.\n\n—Louise, Youth Services\n\nOur Missing Hearts by Celeste Ng\n\nCeleste Ng really blew me away with this thought provoking and heartbreaking dystopia. But don’t be put off by the dystopian label. Her writing is as brilliant as ever and with characters you will fall in love with. I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by the extremely talented Lucy Lu. Her brilliant narration brought the story to life, and I highly recommend listening to it.\n\n—Michelle, Information & Reader Services\n\nSet in a dystopian future far too close to our present, this book is a celebration of fighting back against an unfair and imposing government - and bonus points for celebrating librarians as humanitarians and activists.\n\n—Louise, Youth Services\n\nThe Mountain in the Sea by Ray Nayler\n\nIn the near-future, marine biologist Ha Nguyen is invited by the mysterious, powerful DIANIMA Corporation to an isolated Vietnamese archipelago to study a newly discovered society of intelligent octopuses. Along with Evrim, the world's first android, and Altantsetseg, a secretive, expert drone operator, she attempts to understand and communicate with the octopuses and discover what, if anything, they really want. Two additional subplots involve Rustem, a genius hacker hired by an anonymous woman to hack into an unspecified system, and Eiko, a young man kidnapped into slavery aboard an autonomous fishing vessel. What makes this novel work so well is that Nayler takes the interior life and nature of every character, both human and non-human, incredibly seriously. From what an octopus's language might realistically look like to whether an autonomous ship is capable of evil to the morality of drone warfare, everything is deeply considered and thought-provoking. This intellectually stimulating, sometimes moving and sometimes frightening book is well worth a read.\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nWe Spread by Iain Reid\n\nIain Reid explores the nature of loneliness and the effect it has on a person’s psyche in his third novel, We Spread. Perfect for book club discussions, this psychological horror/suspense is filled with atmosphere, tension, and unease. Its disturbing and thought-provoking take on life and death begs the question, Is living forever the best solution? Reid explores the themes of art, getting older, the relationships we form, and losing control over our lives. Through rules, order, structure, and neatness Penny pursues life at all costs. This book will leave readers scared, anxious, unsettled, and pondering deep philosophical questions.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nThe Maid by Nita Prose\n\nMolly is neurodivergent, meaning in this case, in part, that she doesn’t pick up on social ques that may be commonplace and easily understood by most. She’s always had her grandmother to help her navigate the complexities of interacting with others. Now, with her grandmother gone, she must use the many lessons she was taught to manage her life as a maid in an upscale luxury hotel. Her unique world view complicates things for her when she finds a dead body when cleaning one of the hotel rooms, getting pulled into the resulting murder investigation. The maid is a short, cute, and simple cozy mystery. The protagonist, Molly, is delightful and the reader is sure to root for her happiness.\n\n—Aaron, Information & Reader Services\n\nLavender House by Lev AC Rosen\n\nIf you want a murder mystery, where is the murder and mystery are not the main focus of the book, then check out this book. This book features a detective who gets let go from his job as a police officer after he is found at a raid at a gay bar. This book is a great examination of how queer people have always had to build their own communities and how to navigate a world that is rampant with homophobia.\n\n—Maureen, Information & Reader Services\n\nA Taste of Gold and Iron by Alexandra Rowland\n\nWhen you think of the word “lush,” this book should come to mind. A prince and his bodyguard find grudging respect, then love, in this slow-burn tale set in a fantasy kingdom where royals can read metal with their skin. There’s a counterfeit coin-maker out in the city, threatening to bring the whole economy down. The anxious second-in-line Prince Kadou must investigate or the kingdom will lose its status and most of its trade partners. By his side is the gruff Evemer, who thinks that Kadou is aloof and superior instead of nervous and awkward. The painfully gradual thawing of their feelings, the slow entry into this fantastical world, and the way every plot thread comes back set this above most fantasy romance by a mile.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nSteeped to Death by Gretchen Rue\n\nPhoebe Winchester has inherited her aunt Eudora's mansion, bookshop/tea store, and more than a few mysteries to figure out.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nThe Oleander Sword by Tasha Suri (Burning Kingdoms #2)\n\nI’m a sucker for sword-wielding star-crossed lovers, and this book is no exception. The first book of the Burning Kingdoms saw Malini regain her strength after months of being fed poison by her brother, and Priya came into her own as a devotee of the yaksa. This book opens with them on different sides of an impending war. Malini is gathering an army to wrench the throne away from her brother, and Priya is trying to rebuild the devastated Ahiranya as one of only two elders of the yaksa religion. But now every sinister thread that started in The Jasmine Throne is twisted hard in this second book, complicating Priya and Malini’s love and devotion to both each other and their causes. It’s morally grey, ethically complicated, and utterly heart-wrenching. Highly recommended for anyone who loves fantasy, action, religious themes, or just longing expressed through letters.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nKings of B'More by R. Eric Thomas\n\nA witty and heartfelt ode to friendship between two queer, black teenagers in Baltimore. Harrison's best friend Linus has just dropped a bombshell: he's moving to South Carolina at the end of the week. Inspired by Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Harrison plans the perfect send off: a Ferris Day, to highlight the best of Baltimore and the boys' friendship. The two trek across town to cram museum visits, a Pride parade, a rooftop party, and more in one day, all while trying to keep their helicopter parents off their trail. As characters, Harrison and Linus are beautifully drawn. Thomas perfectly captures the electric thrill of their adventure, the impending dread of their separation, and most of all, the power of their friendship.\n\n—Hannah, Youth Services\n\nOlav Audunssøn. III Crossroads by Sigrid Undset and Tiina Nunnally\n\nThe Highland Park Press, April 18, 1929 describes Nobel Prize winning Sigrud Undsets tetralogy Olav Audunsson, published as one English volume entitled \"The Axe,\" as \"probably the most sought-after fiction\" at the Library. New English translations, in four volumes, update linguistically this mesmeric historical Norwegian fiction series to the modern reader. Undset's narrative depiction of medieval Norway are sublime.\n\n—Nancy, Information & Reader Services\n\nA Flicker in the Dark by Stacey Willingham\n\nIn this debut thriller, Baton Rouge psychologist Chloe Davis is happily engaged and ready to marry the love of her life while trying to forget her troubled past. Her father is the infamous Breaux Bridge serial killer and has been imprisoned for the past twenty years. When the murders of two teenagers appear to be the work of a copycat, Chloe begins to doubt her memory and suspect that the killer is trying to get her attention. Who is murdering young girls? Expertly plotted and masterfully executed, readers will be left guessing until the very end.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin\n\nThe premise of this book didn't appeal to me at first; two childhood friends reconnect and create a video game. This book was so much more than that. Zevin explores life, death, and all the tomorrows in between. Come for the 90's gaming nostalgia but stay for the rollercoaster of emotions Sadie and Sam take you on.\n\n—Marissa, Youth Services\n\nThe Reading List by Sara Nisha Adams\n\nOne list, with eight book recommendations on it, is discovered by different characters. Their interactions with each other help them to connect in meaningful ways, and invite the reader to join is as well. I loved the ending.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nWe Know You Remember by Tove Alsterdal\n\nTove Alsterdal is a find for fans of Scandinavian crime novels. We Know You Remember, her U.S. debut and second novel to be translated into English, introduces a conscientious female detective who, against the advice of colleagues, reopens 23-year-old cold case files to help prove the innocence of a young man who was wrongly convicted of a past crime and is now under suspicion in the recent death of his father. Set in a small town in rural northeast Sweden, this fast-paced and suspenseful novel is part psychological study, part police procedural.\n\n—Karen, Information & Reader Services\n\nDarling by K. Ancrum\n\nA satisfying twist of Peter Pan in a contemporary Chicago setting, where fantasy meets reality with noir-like consequences.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nLight from Uncommon Stars by Ryka Aoki\n\nA donut shop owner has a meet-cute with a violin instructor, and they slowly develop feelings for each other. The only complicating factors are that the donut shop owner is an alien outrunning a plague of nihilism, and the violin instructor sold her soul to a devil and needs to deliver just one more violin prodigy to him to escape. Meanwhile, a teen girl runs away from home, survives homelessness, and only finds joy in her violin playing in a park—which gets the attention of the instructor. The tension between all these characters, their hopes to do better, and their struggles to find meaning and hope in a time of hopelessness power the story. It's an incredibly kind and utterly original book that everyone should read.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nBlack Buck by Mateo Askaripour\n\nThis is a hilarious satire on startup culture, the commodification of Blackness, and the way people of color have to fight to blend in and get ahead in an industry that doesn't care about them. Great if you liked the movie Sorry to Bother You.\n\n—Julia, Information & Reader Services\n\nDarren \"Buck\" Vender gets caught up in the insanity of the Somwun start-up company while trying to improve his prospects. He imparts his wisdom of all that he learned while trying to survive, and shows the consequences of his decisions while blazing the path through a new frontier.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nWho is Maud Dixon? by Alexandra Andrews\n\nFlorence Darrow has high hopes of becoming a well-known novelist. Working as a low-level assistant at a New York publishing house, she is thrilled when she receives an offer to work for her favorite author. She jumps at the chance to upgrade her status and live the life her mother always envisioned for her. However, the one caveat is that she must not reveal her boss’s identity. Can she keep the secret? This is a perfectly paced thriller by newcomer, Alexandra Andrews! You will not want to put this book down, as there are surprising twists and turns around every corner.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nThis Poison Heart by Kalynn Bayron\n\nBriseis has an uncanny ability to nurture plant life. When she inherits a mysterious estate full of unusual surprises, she discovers her ancient and powerful lineage. I love the descriptions of the various plants and the way they react to her presence, as well as the way she reacts to them.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nMilk Fed by Melissa Broder\n\nI don't even know how to describe this one. It's about being a lesbian, it's about having mother issues, it's about having body issues, it's about finding comfort through someone else. It's a tough read and a little bit twisted, which I like, but I think Broder depicts body issues and how it permeates one's everyday life in a way that's both funny and powerful.\n\n—Julia, Information & Reader Services\n\nRachel carries the weight of her emotionally abusive mother and a resultant eating disorder. Then her therapist persuades her to put her maternal relationship on hold and, in the meantime, she meets Miriam, who carries the weight of her religious family and her literally large body, but does so quite happily. Rachel finds herself letting go, hanging on, exploring a new territory of emotional connections. Broder’s novels are offbeat and smart.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nYolk by Mary H. K. Choi\n\nJayne and June are two estranged sisters living in New York City. June is wealthy with a fancy finance job, and Jayne is barely scraping by with fashion school, bad anxiety, and an eating disorder she isn't dealing with. The sisters are brought together, suddenly living with each other, when June is diagnosed with uterine cancer. Jayne and June are two of my favorite characters I've read about in a while; they feel so lived-in, and I adore their relationship and their crazy sister dialog.\n\n—Kelly, Youth Services\n\nA Master of Djinn by P. Djeli Clark\n\nCairo, 1912. Agent Fatma, who works for the Ministry of Alchemy, Enchantments, and Supernatural Entities, tries to find out how the members of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Al-Jahiz died so mysteriously and why. She encounters djinn, thieves, angels, and a new partner. It was an exceedingly satisfying investigation from beginning to end.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nThe Intimacy Experiment by Rosie Danan\n\nA Jewish inspirational romance! A young rabbi with a flagging congregation and a sex-positive startup owner work together on a daring Modern Intimacy workshop series—it'll attract young people to his shul and clean up her start-up's image. But things start to go wrong when their series goes viral and they can't fight their attraction to each other.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave\n\nI've read other books by Laura Dave and really liked Eight Hundred Grapes. I wasn't sure that this one would appeal to me, though, as mysteries aren't my usual genre. I'm glad that I decided to read it, and since then, I've been recommending it to everyone! The Last Thing He Told Me is a page turner! Hannah, a new wife is trying to figure out why her husband disappeared and left her and his daughter. Together, the two embark on a journey to discover what happened. The plot will keep you reading into the night. It's a great book to curl up with during a snowy weekend or while on vacation.\n\n—Beth, Administration\n\nParadise, Nevada by Dario Diofebi\n\nThe novel begins with a bomb going off in a Las Vegas resort and casino. It then flashes back six months to tell the story of four very different characters whose lives will eventually converge that night. There's Ray, the high stakes professional poker player; Mary Ann, the depressed cocktail waitress; Tom, an Italian tourist who overstays his visa to stay a gambler in America; and Lindsay, a journalist who'd rather have a literary career. The author really is an Italian who played professional high stakes poker, and that authenticity shows. Additionally, the writing is lively, the characters read as fleshed out people you really care about, and the story is genuinely suspenseful. Highly recommended!\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nFor Your Own Good by Samantha Downing\n\nTeddy Crutcher is teacher of the year at the exclusive private school Belmont Academy. His only goal is to help his students fulfill their potential greatness at any cost. When other teachers and colleagues get in his way, he decides that he must teach them a lesson. Does that make him a murderer or savior? For Your Own Good is an unputdownable, unpredictable, twisty thriller. It is so completely original, quirky, and creepy. Prepare to fall in love with the characters, even though you should hate them. The short chapters further the plot with every turn of the page and the cat and mouse game is so completely addicting!\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nMrs. March by Virginia Feito\n\nMrs. March is a self-proclaimed observer who is caught up in appearances. She even married her husband because everyone said he was the most attractive man on campus. But, who is George March? How well does she really know her husband? When Mrs. March visits her favorite shop for her usual loaf of olive bread, the shopkeeper insinuates that the main character in her husband’s new best-selling book is based on her. Mrs. March is horrified! How can that be? George’s book is about a prostitute, right? Why would he humiliate her like that? Or did he? You see, she hasn’t read the book. Mrs. March snoops around in George’s office for clues about herself in his book and comes across an article he saved about a woman who was recently murdered. She soon becomes increasingly convinced that she doesn’t really know her husband. Could he be capable of murder? Virginia Feito’s Hitchcockian, character driven, suspenseful, dark psychological thriller will keep you guessing until the very last page. Mrs. March is an expertly flawed complex character. This is one of those books that makes you think, What did I just read? What just happened? What is real? What is imagined?\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nInfinitum: An Afrofuturist Tale by Tim Fielder\n\nThis brilliant graphic novel presents a vibrant narrative in powerful images that left me stunned in admiration.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nEveryone Knows Your Mother Is a Witch by Rivka Galchen\n\nBased on a real-life accused witch whose son is a still a household name four hundred years later (hint: his first name is Johannes), this story was a lot of fun because its portrayal of small-town life really rang true to me, an originally small-town reader. Rivka Galchen is one of my favorite writers.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nExcuse Me While I Ugly Cry by Joya Goffney\n\nQuinn's journal, full of lists about very private thoughts, is misplaced. It's found by another student at her school who starts posting it online. As Quinn tries to find out who her blackmailer is, she hooks up with some new friends who help her discover her true self. It's full of surprises, and lots of love.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nThe Witch's Heart by Genevieve Gornichec\n\nOne of many books re-imagining mythology through the points of view of female characters, this book looks at the story of Angrboda and following her perspective through Ragnarok. Great read if you're a fan of Madeline Miller or Norse mythology.\n\n—Julia, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Forest of Vanishing Stars by Kristin Harmel\n\nA gripping World War II story about a young woman who helps others evade the Nazis by surviving in the forest. The book opens with an old woman stealing a young child from her German parents in the middle of the night. I found the beginning of the book weak, but the book gets better! The woman and the child live in the forest where the young child grows up learning how to survive in the wilderness. When she's older and now on her own as the old woman has died, she comes across groups hiding from the Nazis and uses her skills and knowledge of the forest to help them survive. It's a good story!\n\n—Beth, Administration\n\nWhen You Look Like Us by Pamela N. Harris\n\nJay Murphy can't stop blaming himself about his sister Nicole's disappearance. As he frantically tries to find her, his life tips from one crisis to another. Luckily, he has several people to help him through all those challenges, and he discovers an alternative path he can choose in life.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nA Thousand Ships by Natalie Haynes\n\nThe men of the Trojan War have always been called heroes, but what about the women? In this story all women: Trojan and Greek, Goddess and Mortal, get their stories told, no matter how short they are. I hope this trend of telling the women of the Iliad's stories continue because I find them the most interesting. Also great on audiobook!\n\n—Michelle, Information & Reader Services\n\nBacchanal by Veronica Henry\n\nEliza Meeks joins a mysterious and sinister carnival that travels across the South during the Depression. When her own supernatural heritage is revealed, she discovers her powers and follows her destiny to its gripping finale.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nThe Good Sister by Sally Hepworth\n\nTwo sisters. Two versions of the truth.\n\nRose and Fern are fraternal twin sisters, each with their own personality. Rose is responsible, while Fern is quirky. They have always looked out for one another, especially from their overbearing mother. When Rose is unable to get pregnant, Fern decides to become her surrogate in order to give her the baby that she desires. However, Fern soon realizes that Rose may not be looking out for Fern’s best interests. Rose is hiding secrets that could change everything. The Good Sister is an absolutely unputdownable fast-paced thriller with many cleverly crafted twists. Prepare to fall in love with all the characters. Hepworth masterfully deals with issues of abuse, sensory disorders, and sibling rivalry.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nThe Removed by Brandon Hobson\n\nA Cherokee family consisting of aging parents—one with Alzheimer’s—and two adult children plans a memorial bonfire in honor of the third child, who died by a police shooting. While the two remaining children make their own journeys, the parents take in a foster child who begins to seem preternatural. Heartfelt and strange, this book kept me thinking even after I finished it.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nThe Moon, the Stars, and Madame Burova by Ruth Hogan\n\nIf you haven't read anything by Hogan, you're in for a treat. Hogan writes once again of quirky British characters who come together as family in this heartening novel.\n\n—Laurie, Information & Reader Services\n\nKlara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nThis book got plenty of attention and may need no introduction. Ishiguro isn’t strictly a science fiction writer, but he goes where his interests take him. Here, Klara is an Artificial Friend who allows Ishiguro to explore what emotional needs humans are hoping to fill with AI, and what emotional needs AI may have. Another great book from a great writer.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nThe Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois by Honorée Fanonne Jeffers\n\nA real family saga—the kind with a family tree at the front—this book covers several generations, but focuses on Ailey Pearl Garfield, born in 1973. Ailey lives in the city but spends her summers with her mother’s family in Chicasetta, Georgia, where they have lived for generations, beginning when some members were kidnapped in Africa. As Ailey grows up, continues her education, and begins to find her way in the world, the past echoes around her, through older relatives still living and some long dead. As she eventually discovers history work at the university level, the book rolls in an academic mystery just as a bonus. This is a long book, but I’m hoping for additional ones about some of the characters whose stories don’t get told here, like sister Coco and cousin Veronica.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nAfter the Rain by John Jennings, David Brame, Nnedi Okorafor\n\nThis was my first introduction to Nnedi Okorafor's extraordinary writing. I was inspired to read the collection, Kabu-Kabu, that this story came from. Jennings does an excellent job of catching her rare imagination.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nRise to the Sun by Leah Johnson\n\nA beautiful sad sweet story about two young women, Olivia and Toni, who collide at a music festival. I was touched by their personal stories, and felt uplifted by the ending.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nMy Heart is a Chainsaw by Stephen Graham Jones (Indian Lake Trilogy #1)\n\nPart horror, part mystery, part coming-of-age, part revenge, quarts of blood, and a whole lot of school essays about slasher films—it doesn't sound like it should work, but it absolutely does. Jade is a slasher devotee, and believes she sees the signs of a classic slasher film in the making around her small town of Proofrock. Now she just has to figure out how to get people to take it seriously while also protecting the perfect new Final Girl that she's sure the killer will target. What happens when it turns out that she's right, and that no one else can help?\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Secret Keeper of Jaipur by Alka Joshi (Jaipur Trilogy, #2)\n\nFor those who love stories about beautiful India, I recommend the \"Jaipur Trilogy Series\" by Alka Joshi. In The Henna Artist, Lakshi, a seventeen-year-old courageous woman escapes from an abusive marriage and moves to Jaipur, the pink city, to become the best henna artist in town and confidante of the wealthy women. However, gossip and the sudden surprise of an unknown sister threaten her dreams of becoming an independent woman. In The Secret Keeper of Jaipur, Lakshmi now moves to the foothills of the Himalayan mountains and marries Dr. Kumar. Her protégé, Malik, is now back in Jaipur working on the construction of a movie theater that tragically collapses. Corruption is the main cause and Lakshmi reveals the secrets of Jaipur, so justice prevails during this scandal. I cannot wait to read The Perfumist of Paris which will be released in 2023!\n\n—Cary, Administration\n\nOn the Origin of Species and Other Stories by Bo-Young Kim\n\nIf you like science fiction and you're not reading Bo-Young Kim, something has gone horribly wrong with your life. But don't worry this is reversible if you hurry. Bo-Young Kim is like Ted Chiang for people who liked the non-science parts of Liu Cixin, except less sexist. Her stories are thoughtful and fascinating and moving, and my favorite was about robots trying to invent biology by trying to prove that organic matter counts as life. It's a horribly stereotypical statement, but her stories really do ask what it means to be human, and I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Ted Chiang.\n\n—Julia, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe War for Gloria by Atticus Lish\n\nTeenaged Corey Goltz lives with his mom, Gloria, in the working-class outskirts of Boston. They aren't rich, but they get by. Gloria once had big dreams, but they got derailed in college when she met Corey's father, Leonard, and got pregnant. Leonard, an MIT security guard and self-proclaimed physics genius with questionable morals, eventually disappears from their lives, but he reappears when Gloria receives a diagnosis of ALS when Corey is fifteen. This return is not good news. This is a brutal, raw and devastating book. Reading about Corey and Gloria's struggles to survive through unbearable circumstances left me in tears. Additionally, the author's mother was diagnosed with ALS when he was a teenager, and the authenticity shows. Lish holds nothing back, and the book is all the better for it.\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nReprieve by James Han Mattson\n\nA literary fiction glimpsed between the moments of a courtroom drama. The book opens with court documents showing that something terrible has happened inside a full-contact haunted house that offers a prize to those who can finish without saying the safe word \"reprieve\". Finding out whodunnit, what they did, and why takes a backseat to fully exploring the characters that went into the house, their obsessions, and their connections with each other.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nHow Beautiful We Were by Imbolo Mbue\n\nThis page-turner pits a small African village against a big American company that is polluting their land. When children get sick and start dying, and the men who set out to plead their case disappear, the villagers resort to kidnapping. And that’s just the beginning of the attempts to save the village, which stretch out over years. Some of the children grow up in the struggle. This book deals with problems of environmental degradation that happen the world over, but its language was a pleasure to read.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nAcross the Green Grass Fields by Seanan McGuire (Wayward Children #6)\n\nIt's the latest book in her Wayward Children series, but each one generally acts as a solid standalone. I'm a big fan of this series, which is a love letter to every book featuring a child being whisked away on a fantastical adventure. If you loved books like Alice in Wonderland or The Wizard of Oz or any such books, I definitely recommend the series as a whole.\n\n—Julia, Information & Reader Services\n\nIn by Will McPhail\n\n*Lady Gaga meme* Brilliant, phenomenal, fantastic, genius. McPhail is a stupidly talented cartoonist, his book is funny as hell and heartwarming, the use of color and lineart is phenomenal, I bought a copy of my own like days after I read this. It's about connecting with people, about overcoming the rituals that dictate everyday life and forging a real relationship with people, it's about opening up in turn, read this book or else.\n\n—Julia, Information & Reader Services\n\nWhen the Reckoning Comes by LaTanya McQueen\n\nIt's horror set at a modern-day plantation wedding, where the main character Mira is one of two black people invited—you know where this is going, right? Actually, you might not. McQueen keeps you on your toes the whole way through, leaning into standard horror tropes one minute and dodging them the next. It perfectly blends the horrors of the supernatural and the horrors of humanity. And at under 250 pages, it's short enough to keep you completely invested the whole way through.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nMargaret and the Mystery of the Missing Body by Megan Milks\n\nIf you've ever had a difficult relationship with your body, this is a book for you. It's several things at once, and all of them are weird. At first, it's a satire of middle-grade book series with can-do heroines that never age, with this club having a regular client who's a disembodied brain. But what happens if you're a regular person and you do age, and it changes your body, your friends, and your relationships in ways that you hate? If you're Margaret, you develop an eating disorder. The second part is an insiders' view of an eating disorder recovery clinic, haunted by ghosts mental and real, which lets you out once you go on a carnival-ride tour of a body. The third part tears away the fantastic and turns into a fictionalized memoir of Milks, using Margaret as a mouthpiece. This is a fantastic example of using unreality to make something more powerful and honest than the strictly real—because of the fun and whimsy of the first two sections, the third section hits particularly hard. Anyone who's struggled with their physical self will find something that resonates with them in this book.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Night Singer by Johanna Mo\n\nA police detective returns to her hometown in this novel set on the Swedish island of Öland. Hanna Duncker returns to Öland to join their police force, though she's not exactly eagerly welcomed back, as her father was found guilty of brutally murdering an old woman when she was a teenager. After a local teenage boy is found dead, Hanna and her very chatty new partner have to solve the case. What I loved about this book was its focus on the humanity of all the characters, from victim to police to perpetrator. There are no monsters in this book—just deeply flawed people. The real standout for me, though, was Mo's decision to show us the teenage victim's entire last day over the course of the book. By the time I reached the end, I was in tears. A deeply satisfying psychological mystery.\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nThis Thing Between Us by Gus Moreno\n\nA man who just lost his wife mourns her passing while also trying to figure out what caused it. His smart speaker talks to people who aren't there and orders mysterious packages. He hears scratches through the walls and feels himself sleepwalk. Some sinister presence is haunting him, but the lines of reality start to bend as he investigates what it might be.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Cost of Knowing by Brittney Morris\n\nAlex Rufus is cursed with visions of the future. When he sees a fatal ending for his brother Isaiah, he questions the choices he made in a previous tragedy, and tries to make better ones this time. The powerful ending was unforgettable.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nSummerwater by Sarah Moss\n\nFor holiday, several families are staying in cabins on a loch where there’s no cell service and it’s raining a lot, even for Scotland. Very subtly, we start to feel that something isn’t quite right. This book is a good one for those who like books that are unsettling but not outright scary. It’s a short novel told in a stream-of-consciousness style, but every chapter is told from a different character’s point of view. The book didn’t end like I thought it would—and that was probably the point!\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nHot Stew by Fiona Mozley\n\nGentrification is stalking London’s Soho neighborhood, as a wealthy building owner attempts to evict the residents, and the residents fight back. This book is like a group portrait of a close-knit neighborhood. If you like books with a large cast of characters, like Deacon King Kong or The Great Believers, check this one out.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nSuburban Dicks by Fabian Nicieza\n\nA new mystery author! Suburban New Jersey mom Andie Stern stumbles into a gas station murder scene when one of her kids has to pee—which she proceeds to do, all over the place. Well, good thing that before mom life, Andie was a top profiler. And good thing that she can team up with down-on-his-luck reporter (and former classmate) Kenneth Lee. The diverse cast of characters makes this mystery a lot of fun, as does Andie’s inner seething, which is worthy of any hardboiled detective who doesn’t have to usher five kids safely through life while also catching killers.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nThe Sanatorium by Sarah Pearse\n\nA great debut novel, it is both a spooky and tense thriller. What do you get when you have estranged siblings meeting at a remote hotel which once was a sanatorium, run by siblings who have different vested interest? You get a cat and mouse game of who is telling the truth, what are they hiding, who will survive.\n\n—Stephanie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Lost Apothecary by Sarah Penner\n\nThe Lost Apothecary takes the reader between the past and the present as two very different women grapple with their identity after being betrayed by the men they love. What secrets does the old apothecary vile hold, is it linked to murder? Will an aspiring historian be able to piece together the past while finding a new future for herself?\n\n—Stephanie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Five Wounds: A Novel by Kirstin Valdez Quade\n\nA matriarch oversees the lives of her troubled, adult children and grandchildren in their tiny New Mexico town. Of particular concern is her son, Amadeo, who struggles with employment, addiction, his teenage daughter, and relationships. Life is just hard for him. When he receives the high honor of portraying Jesus in the town's Good Friday procession, he sees this as his chance to redeem himself in the eyes of others and himself. Though I inwardly groaned at some of his dubious choices, I loved this family. I was sorry to leave them.\n\n—Cynthia, Youth Services\n\nBeautiful World, Where Are You by Sally Rooney\n\nA great follow up to Normal People, Rooney's next entry is another millennial-centric slice of life. Following novelist Alice and her best friend Eileen through a series of meetings and emails, we watch the two grow in relationships and come to terms with an ever-tumultuous world. This is especially poignant as a (somewhat) post Covid-19 novel.\n\n—Marissa, Youth Services\n\nAny Way the Wind Blows by Rainbow Rowell (Simon Snow trilogy, book 3)\n\nI love this series on audiobook. This emotional conclusion was rocky and challenging, but absolutely worth the read. Beautiful characters with layers of emotion and experience. Includes some potentially triggering scenes.\n\n—Heidi, Administration\n\nThe Kitchen Front by Jennifer Ryan\n\nThis delightful book features four British women during World War II who compete in a cooking contest. They can only use ingredients from the rationing guidelines set up by the government. Reading about their triumphs, and mishaps, was a treat. I love that the author included their recipes.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nMeet Me in Another Life by Catriona Silvey\n\nTwo strangers keep meeting each other over separate lifetimes in the same city. Once they realize their connection, they set out to find the reason behind it. Along the way, they find out what happens when you know someone completely in all their contexts—you start to not know where one person ends and the other begins.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nLight Perpetual by Francis Spufford\n\nThe day I heard that this novel had been nominated for the Booker Prize, I felt lucky to find it on the New Fiction shelf and checked it out. The book was inspired by a plaque the author saw in London as he walked to work. The plaque commemorated the 168 people who died in the 1944 bombing of a South London Woolworths store. Fifteen of the victims were children who “lost their chance to experience the rest of the twentieth century,” Spufford writes. After a brief description of the bombing, Spufford imagines how the lives of five of these children might’ve turned out if they’d lived, visiting them at 15-year intervals till 2009.\n\n—Karen, Information & Reader Services\n\nMister Impossible by Maggie Stiefvater (Dreamer Trilogy, book 2)\n\nI can’t even talk about this book, it was so good! I can say I didn’t like the audiobook. The narrator was fantastic with the Raven Cycle, but his English accent for Hennessy, Jordan, et al., is distracting. I can’t wait for the 3rd book!\n\n—Heidi, Administration\n\nDial A for Aunties by Jesse Q. Sutanto\n\nA romantic farce featuring meddling family, a romantic encounter from the past, and one woman trying desperately to do her job and hide a dead body. I thought the book was delightful, and I especially loved the maternal relationships explored between the protagonist and her many aunts.\n\n—Julia, Information & Reader Services\n\nLady Joker. Volume 1 by Kaoru Takamura\n\nThis slowly unfolding crime novel was hard to put down, and I'm eagerly anticipating volume 2 so I can find out what happens! First the characters are set up—the men who form a criminal crime ring at a racetrack, and the beer company executive who becomes their kidnapping victim—then the crime is executed, and by the end the screws are starting to tighten as the kidnappers pull the threads to extract their payment, while police and journalists circle for clues. This book is great for fans of the shows \"The Wire\" and \"Luck.\"\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nThere's No Such Thing as an Easy Job by Kikuko Tsumura\n\nThis novel tells the story of a young, unnamed woman in Japan who, after suffering from career burnout, works a series of unusual jobs in search of something altogether different and more meaningful. These jobs, which include observing an author suspected of criminal activity for hours at a time via a hidden camera feed and writing an advice column which appears on rice cracker wrappers, are monotonous and bizarre and yet somehow riveting to read about. Ultimately, this is a book about how we live and how we spend our lives, and I found it incredibly moving.\n\n—Michelle, Technical Services\n\nThe Last House on Needless Street by Catriona Ward\n\nA serial killer lives inside the last house on Needless Street. Or does he? What secrets lie buried in the forest? This is a very dark and uncomfortable read told by multiple unreliable narrators (one is even a cat!) It will mess with your sense of time and place and have you questioning everything you think you know and understand. Things are not always as they seem. Meet Ted.\n\n—Jayme, Administration\n\nHarlem Shuffle by Colson Whitehead\n\nColson Whitehead switches gears (again) and gives us a crime thriller / sociogram of civil rights-era Harlem. Think Langston Hughes meets Frank Miller.\n\n—Chad, Administration\n\nSeven Days in June by Tia Williams\n\nIf you ever wondered what the perfect intersection of literary fiction and romance is, it's this book. Two deeply troubled teens met 15 years ago, spend an unforgettable week together, and leave with the path of their lives forever changed. In the present day, they meet up again as fellow authors and start to discover that their feelings for each other are complicated, but haven't lost any passion at all.\n\n—Katie, Information & Reader Services\n\nCovet by Tracy Wolff (Crave, book 3)\n\nThe Crave series is a moody, fun, dark high-school vampire/dragon/werewolf boarding school romantic series, reminiscent of Twilight with some overt references to that series. Book 4 comes out in February and Book 5 in May!\n\n—Heidi, Administration\n\nNightbitch by Rachel Yoder\n\nThe unnamed mother has given up her art career to be a stay-at-home mom to her toddler son, and she is less than thrilled about it. While her husband is away at work all week every week, the mother starts experiencing confusing feelings of rage and developing canine impulses. She believes she is turning into a dog. This novel is a fascinating, brutal, and vital commentary on modern motherhood.\n\n—Kelly, Youth Services\n\nPraying with Jane Eyre: Reflections on Reading as a Sacred Practice by Vanessa Zoltan\n\nZoltan is an atheist hospital chaplain who digs deep into secular texts in the same way that a religious person would with sacred texts. This book is part a guide and part a memoir, as she describes how her reading processes help her support others and process her own inherited trauma as the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors. Reading on another level.\n\n—Catherine, Technical Services\n\nThe Icepick Surgeon by Sam Kean\n\nAn interesting look at what steps some will take in the name of science. It covers the gambit of dastardly experiments on the living and dead, the chapters cover many different times in history. What was Cleopatra up to? Thomas Edison may have been a genius, but still was not a nice guy. Why the Tuskegee project proceeded for years. Some of the deeds are cringe worthy but worth the read.\n\n—Stephanie, Information & Reader Services\n\nThe Barbizon: The Hotel that Set Women Free by Paulina Bren\n\nThis gives a great account of why the Barbizon was so important to the foundation of many famous individuals.

Through anecdotes and descriptions McGhee articulates the material losses to generations of those descended from American Slaves. Data and stories again recount the relationship of these losses to economic blight across ethnic lines in the working class. The metaphor of the \"drained-pool\" supports her research. White resistance to integrated pools resulted and violence and closure across the country, including the once enormous Fairground Park Pool in Missouri. The author ties \"drained-pool\" politics to healthcare and other exclusion policies convincingly. Thought-provoking and tragic.\n\n—Nancy, Archivist\n\nYou'll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey by Amber Ruffin & Lacey Lamar\n\nEyebrow raising, jaw dropping, uncomfortably humorous book about the clueless remarks white people have made to Amber's sister Lacey.\n\n—Lisa, Membership Services\n\nAll "
