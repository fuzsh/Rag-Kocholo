        "text": "Procopio’s commitment to the startup community runs deep. For some entrepreneurs we’re there from the beginning with our LaunchPad incubator. Since 2012, a select group of carefully chosen entrepreneurs have begun the formation, protection of core technology, early funding and growth of their companies in our LaunchPad incubator.\n\nThe incubator is housed in Procopio’s Del Mar Heights office, the heart of San Diego’s high-technology community. Incubator participants work side by side with attorneys who understand their industries and the path to success for emerging growth companies.\n\nLaunchPad participants receive tailored corporate and intellectual property legal services, at no cost, in order to successfully position their companies for outside funding. They do so while benefiting from complimentary office space and back-office business support including conference rooms and other amenities.\n\nParticipating entrepreneurs also benefit from education on key topics—including valuation, funding, intellectual property strategy, employment issues, and pursuing a strong exit—along with access to successful entrepreneurs and investors and experts in finance, marketing and other critical areas for emerging-growth companies. Our attorneys provide ongoing legal support and assist with corporate structuring, patent protection, investor pitches, branding, and growth strategy.\n\nAccess to our Advisory Board - LaunchPad participants also enjoy access and collaboration opportunities with our LaunchPad Advisory Board, which includes experienced entrepreneurs, investors and business advisors. Participants also gain access to experts in finance, accounting, insurance, marketing and other critical areas for emerging-growth companies.\n\nThe LaunchPad incubator program runs for nine months, with participants progressing through the formative stages of business development and leaving the incubator positioned for further growth and success.\n\nThe admission process for LaunchPad is competitive. If you are unsure about your company's eligibility or have questions please contact Procopio’s Chief Marketing and Business Development Officer, Kevin J. Wilson at 619.515.3234 or kevin.wilson@procopio.com.\n\nIf you feel your startup is right for the program use the button below to apply .\n\nCompanies participating in the LaunchPad program agree to engage Procopio for legal support, allocate enterprise equity (or equivalent) of 1.5% to Procopio, and upon taking up residence, provide proof of premises liability insurance."
