        "text": "Jamie Means, MSPH is the founder and senior consultant of JMM Consulting Agency, a healthcare consulting and recruiting agency located in Nashville, TN. Ms. Means has 5+ years of experience working with companies and organizations to help them build their workforce and reshape their internal activities regarding equity-focused practices. She is currently working on her doctorate in business administration degree at Trevecca Nazarene University; Ms. Means uses her background in chemistry, public health, and business to educate health professionals on how to transform healthcare through an equity lens. Through this company, she hopes to improve physician shortages in rural and underserved communities in hopes that they may one-day advance closer toward achieving better health outcomes.\n\nCan you tell our readers about your background?\n\nI was born and raised in Spartanburg, South Carolina in a single-parent household with my mother. I always had an interest in the healthcare field but was not sure of what I wanted to do until my senior year in college when I started my business. I have always had an entrepreneurial spirit and have always wanted to improve the health outcomes of disadvantaged individuals."
