        "text": "VIDEO: There's Something Fishy About Penn State LB Kobe King's Weight Loss\n\nRED BANK, N.J. -- Marquet Dorsey is already known in recruiting circles, and the class of 2025 cornerback from Ramsey (N.J.) Don Bosco is now ready to showcase his talent as a starter.\n\nThe 6-foot, 175-pound Dorsey's early offer list includes Penn State, where he camped in late July after being offered in May, as well as Boston College, Duke, Florida, Maryland, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Stanford, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\n\"I put a lot of weight on in the offseason,\" Dorsey said. \"They love physical DBs, so with my length and stuff like that, physicality makes it so much better for me. I stepped into a bigger role. Last year I was on the roster but I was behind seniors and had growing up to do, but now I have to fill those shoes.\""
