        "text": "2024 March Madness: Seth Davis, Clark Kellogg, Jay Wright break down the NCAA tournament bracket\n\nThe 2024 NCAA DI men's basketball tournament bracket was released Sunday night, marking the arrival of March Madness. Before you fill out your bracket, get to know the teams selected. Here's one thing you should know about each of the 68 teams.\n\nEast Region\n\nUConn\n\nIs it possible Dan Hurley’s team got better after winning a national championship last season? The Huskies are elite at everything, and they have arguably the best starting five in the nation. This UConn squad seems like the most likely repeat candidate we’ve had in a while.\n\nIowa State\n\nIowa State dismantled Houston in the Big 12 championship to fly into the NCAA tournament on the 2-seed line. T.J. Otzelberger’s Cyclones are a nightmare for any team. They force a turnover on more than 25 percent of their opponent’s possessions and are top-3 in the nation in scoring defense. Freshman Milan Momcilovic is a budding superstar that provides a lengthy offensive weapon that can shoot the Cyclones back into games if needed.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois may prove to be one of the toughest outs in the tournament, as it is built for a deep run into April. Terrence Shannon Jr. and Marcus Domask are two of the best individual scorers in college basketball, and they combine to form arguably the best backcourt in America.\n\nAuburn\n\nBruce Pearl’s Tigers play a high-energy, physical brand of basketball that has formed one of the nation’s best defenses. Auburn finished eighth in the nation in scoring margin, on average out-scoring its opponents by 15 points per game. Led by Johni Broome, this might be the best iteration of Auburn we’ve seen since the 2019 Final Four run.\n\nSan Diego St.\n\nIt’s the same old same old for Brian Dutcher’s Aztecs. Their defensive dominance took them to the national championship game a year ago, and Jaedon Ledee is a bonafide superstar. It could be another fun March for San Diego State.\n\nBYU\n\nThe Cougars shoot more than 32 3-pointers a game, and have a top-20 offense, scoring more than 82 points per game. Mark Pope's squad is one of the tallest and most experienced teams in the nation. If they shoot the ball well, BYU can beat anyone on any night.\n\nWashington State\n\nNot many people would have predicted Washington State to finish the season inside the top-25. But, Myles Rice and the Cougars won 10 of their last 12 Pac-12 regular-season games to enter the tournament flying. Head coach Kyle Smith brought in the country’s tallest roster, and it brings the Cougars their first tournament appearance since 2008.\n\nFlorida Atlantic\n\nAfter making it to the Final Four a season ago, the Owls needed some help from the committee to sneak into the field on Selection Sunday. But make no mistake, Dusty May’s squad is just as dangerous as they were a season ago. Florida Atlantic is an excellent offensive team with stars at guard, forward and center.\n\nNorthwestern\n\nNorthwestern sneaks into the field for just the third time in program history behind Boo Buie, the Wildcats’ all-time leading scorer. Buie has continued to excel after the loss of Ty Berry earlier in the season. The Wildcats are ball-dominant. They play at a slow tempo and turn the ball over at one of the lowest rates in the nation. But Buie’s explosive scoring ability can keep the ‘Cats in a high-scoring game.\n\nDrake\n\nThe Bulldogs cruise into the tournament after an impressive performance over Indiana State in the MVC championship game. Drake is one of the smallest teams in the nation, ranking 306th in average height. Despite this, the Bulldogs are one of the best defensive rebounding teams in the country.\n\nDuquesne\n\nFour wins in the A-10 tournament send Keith Dambrot and the Dukes to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1977. Duquesne is one of the deepest teams in the tournament, with 13 players playing at least 10 percent of the team’s minutes. They are long too, and use their length to play exceptional defense.\n\nUAB\n\nUAB has built one of the better mid-major offenses, despite a relative lack of ability to shoot the three ball. But the Blazers are a great free throw shooting team that gets nearly 25 percent of its points at the charity stripe. UAB cruised through the AAC tournament, winning all three games by double figures. They could be a classic \"peaking at the right time\" team.\n\nYale\n\nMatt Knowling’s buzzer beater in the Ivy League championship clinched the Bulldogs’ second tournament appearance in the last three years. Danny Wolf drives the bus for Yale. He’s one of the best defensive rebounders in the nation, while also shooting better than 35 percent from three as a seven-footer.\n\nMorehead State\n\nThe Eagles clinched the first of 32 autobids with an OVC win over No. 1 Little Rock. NAIA transfer Riley Minix averaged 24 points and eight rebounds in the conference tournament to take Morehead State to its first tournament since 2021. Morehead State poses a nightmare matchup for some teams, as they play at one of the slowest paces in the nation, while finishing in the top-10 nationally in field goal defense.\n\nSouth Dakota State\n\nZeke Mayo and Charlie Easley may not leave the court over the length of the Jackrabbits' tournament run. Eric Henderson’s starters play a lot, but they enter the tournament on fire as winners of eight in a row. Expect some threes when watching South Dakota State. They shoot better than 36 percent from three, but defensively, they allow the most threes of any team in the nation.\n\nStetson\n\nJalen Blackmon is legit. He scored 43 in the ASUN title game to send the Hatters to their first NCAA tournament in program history. Blackmon is top-15 in the nation in points per game. His explosive scoring ability will make Stetson a threat in the first round and beyond.\n\nNCAA tournament bracket revealed | East Region\n\nSouth Region\n\nHouston\n\nKelvin Sampson’s Cougars have been one of, if not the top program in college basketball since the pandemic-shortened season. But this year’s version may be the best we’ve seen. The emergence of Jamal Shead alongside Baylor transfer LJ Cryer gives Houston significant scoring depth to go with the top-rated defense in the nation.\n\nMarquette\n\nMarquette was banged without likely All-American point guard Tyler Kolek for the last three regular season games and the Big East tournament. But when the Golden Eagles are healthy, they are one of the most exciting teams in the country. Kolek and junior Kam Jones are one of the best combos in college basketball. Their individual abilities to take over games can take Marquette to its first Final Four in more than 20 years.\n\nKentucky\n\nThe crown for the best shooting team in America belongs to John Calipari’s Wildcats. Kentucky has three players shooting better than 44 percent from three, including Reed Sheppard who leads the nation in shooting better than 52 percent from deep. If you want to beat Kentucky, you’ll have to score with them.\n\nDuke\n\nThe Blue Devils are one of the most efficient offenses in the nation. Despite playing at a tempo well-below average, Duke has scored 70+ points all but three times this season. Jon Scheyer’s game travels, and it'll add some intrigue to an already exciting region.\n\nWisconsin\n\nThese aren’t your traditional Wisconsin Badgers. Greg Gard’s group is one of the most efficient offenses in the nation. St. John’s transfer AJ Storr has scored in double-figures in 29-straight games, including three 30-point games in his last five, to lead a balanced scoring attack that goes 11 players deep.\n\nTexas Tech\n\nAfter starting 14-2, the Red Raiders hit a few snags in Big 12 play, but enter the tournament with impressive wins over Baylor, Kansas and others. Grant McCasland’s transfer-heavy roster has developed into a solid shooting team. But the availability of top three-point shooter, Darrion Williams, and forward Warren Washington will be the main storylines for Texas Tech heading into their matchup against NC State.\n\nFlorida\n\nTodd Golden’s supersized Gators enter the tournament red-hot after a run to the SEC championship game. Florida led the nation in rebounds per game this season, and grabbed nearly 40 percent of their offensive rebounds, one of the highest rates in the country. Behind guard Walter Clayton and the giant front court, Florida poses a handful of different challenges for any opponent.\n\nNebraska\n\nWelcome back to the dance, Nebraska. Fred Hoiberg’s squad picked up its first winning season since 2019 and made the Big Ten semifinal for the first time in program history. This team is not particularly big, but they can shoot. Every significant contributor is better than 30 percent from deep on the season, including Keisei Tominaga, who figures to be a fan favorite as long as Nebraska is in the tournament.\n\nTexas A&M\n\nThere might not be a harder working team than Buzz Williams’ Aggies. They lead the nation in offensive rebounding, grabbing 42 percent of their misses. While the numbers aren’t great offensively for A&M, their experienced backcourt of Wade Taylor IV and Tyrese Radford both have explosive scoring ability. Taylor scored 30+ in each of the Aggies’ semifinal and final games of the SEC tournament.\n\nColorado/Boise State\n\nThe Buffs are sneakily one of the most talented teams in this tournament. They are also older, with freshman Cody Williams, who’s projected as a top-10 NBA draft pick, as the only significant freshman or sophomore contributor. KJ Simpson is the engine that makes Colorado go. At 6-2, the junior is an explosive scorer, an elite passer and a sharpshooter who hit better than 45 percent of his threes this season.\n\nThe Broncos play a classically physical brand of Mountain West basketball. Excellent seasons from Tyson Degenhart and Max Rice send Boise State back to the tournament for the third-straight season. Boise State is huge, with no regular contributor standing shorter than 6-3.\n\nNC State\n\nThe legend of DJ Burns kicked into full effect over five days in D.C. NC State’s superstar big man carried the Wolfpack to five wins in five days to become the highest seed to win the prestigious tournament. They are one of the oldest teams in the nation, fueled by excellent guard play and Burns, a crafty and dominant interior force.\n\nJames Madison\n\nWhen the Dukes get hot, they get really hot. They enter the tournament on a 13-game win streak, good for longest in the nation. But this isn’t even their longest win streak of the season. James Madison started 14-0 including an opening night win at Michigan State before taking their first loss in early January.\n\nVermont\n\nMake it three straight tournaments for John Becker’s Catamounts. The American East champions have lost just once since December, fueled by their top-10 defense that holds opponents to 63 points per game. Vermont forces its opponents to play at one of the slowest tempos in the nation, and by playing elite defense and not turning the ball over, playing the Catamounts can be frustrating.\n\nOakland\n\nJack Gohlke figures to be one of the trendy names of the tournament as the Oakland junior has shot 300+ three pointers compared to just eight twos all season. But the real star of the team is Horizon League player of the year Trey Townsend who poured in 38 points and 11 rebounds in the conference championship game.\n\nWestern Kentucky\n\nThe Conference USA champions play at the fastest pace in the nation. They are one of the deepest teams in the nation, and use their depth and speed to wear down opponents. Despite the speed, the Hilltoppers don’t shoot many threes. Only 25 percent of their points come from deep, significantly lower than the national average of more than 30 percent.\n\nLongwood\n\nThe Lancers started the year 2-8 in Big South play, but had an impressive run over the conference’s No. 4, No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in consecutive days. Longwood is a clock-eating machine, playing at a slow tempo and dominating the glass. They rank fourth in the nation in rebound margin, and pick-up nearly 14 offensive boards per game.\n\nNCAA tournament bracket revealed | South Region\n\nMidwest Region\n\nPurdue\n\nZach Edey is far and away the nation’s best player, but even without him Matt Painter’s Boilermakers have one of the nation’s best rosters. The three-headed backcourt monster of Braden Smith, Lance Jones and Fletcher Loyer provide necessary scoring and shooting off of Edey’s dominant interior presence. Purdue cruised through one of the nation’s hardest schedules and their experience and scoring depth will make them a near impossible out.\n\nTennessee\n\nThe Dalton Knecht show is ready for its next big stage. This Tennessee team, like all Rick Barnes-coached squads, is a physically and defensively dominant team. But the emergence of Knecht, a transfer from Northern Colorado, gives Tennessee a legitimate scoring threat at all three levels.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas has rarely been healthy this season. But when they are, the preseason No. 1 team is still a great squad. They have five legit offensive threats while also being one of the nation’s better defensive teams. If anyone can manufacture a March run it’s Bill Self and Kansas.\n\nCreighton\n\nGreg McDermott’s Blue Jays are the definition of “built for March.” Creighton is one of the nation’s most experienced and biggest teams, and they have three stars in Trey Alexander, Ryan Kalkbrenner and Baylor Scheierman. The Jays make a higher percentage of 2-point field goals than almost any team in the country, yet more than 40% of their shots come from outside the arc.\n\nGonzaga\n\nMake it 23-straight NCAA tournaments for Mark Few and the Zags, though this Selection Sunday was not as comfortable as it usually is for the Bulldogs. There aren’t many, if any, more talented offensive teams than Gonzaga. Ryan Nembhard is a master point guard who has barely left the court over his three seasons in Spokane.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOut of nowhere, Lamont Paris’ Gamecocks put together one of the more memorable seasons in program history. Meechie Johnson is one of the nation’s best true point guards and him, alongside BJ Mack, have South Carolina staring at a deep March Madness run just a season after finishing 11-21.\n\nTexas\n\nMarch Madness folk hero Max Abmas has been outstanding in his first year at Texas after four seasons at Oral Roberts. He’s just one of the many uber-talented starters that Rodney Terry rolls out. The experienced Longhorns are built for a March run, and the potential match-up with former head coach Rick Barnes could be one of the most anticipated of the opening weekend.\n\nUtah St.\n\nNot enough praise can be placed on the shoulders of Danny Sprinkle and the Aggies. In his first season as Utah State’s head coach, Sprinkle didn’t return a single point from last year’s team, and still managed to lead the Aggies to the first outright Mountain West title in program history. Great Osbor is an undersized big man. But at 6’8\" he has a unique ability to score against much taller defenders, and is also a phenomenal rebounder.\n\nTCU\n\nUtah State better be ready to run in their matchup against TCU. The Horned Frogs score more fast break points per game than any team in the country, with more than 18 per game. Jamie Dixon’s Frogs are experienced, and that shows with a roster averaging 3.39 years of DI experience good for third oldest in the nation.\n\nColorado St./Virginia\n\nIsaiah Stevens helps lead one of America’s best passing teams to the NCAA tournament for the second time in three years. Stevens finished third in the nation with 237 assists, while also posting an assist-to-turnover ratio of better than three.\n\nThis Virginia team is classic Tony Bennett basketball. The Hoos have a top-10 defense, practically never turn the ball over and play at the slowest tempo in the nation. Essentially, they are a nightmare to play against for a fast-paced offense. Point guard Reece Beekman leads the nation in assist rate, and his on-court leadership will be paramount to another deep run for Virginia.\n\nOregon\n\nDana Altman’s Ducks won three games in three days at the PAC-12 tournament, including a win over conference top-seed Arizona. Fifth-year senior Jermaine Cousinard and N’Faly Dante are two experienced stars leading a relatively inexperienced Oregon team. Freshman point guard Jackson Shelstad has quickly developed into an impressive young player. He rarely leaves the floor, and could be a name to monitor if Oregon makes a March run.\n\nMcNeese\n\nWill Wade’s Cowboys have lost once since November. They led the nation in scoring margin, and finished with a top-five scoring defense. The Cowboys’ defense ranks alongside the likes of Houston and Iowa State in nearly every major defense category, to push McNeese to its first NCAA tournament since 2002\n\nSamford\n\nGet ready for Bucky ball. The press-happy Bulldogs score a lot. They have five guys averaging more than 9.5 points per game, led by first-team SOCON big man Achor Achor. Samford’s unique style will not be a fun task for Kansas or anyone else they play going forward.\n\nAkron\n\n​​​​​The experienced Akron Zips won the MAC for the second time in three years. Senior Enrique Freeman led the nation with 30 double-doubles despite standing just 6’7\". While the Zips occasionally struggle to score, they are in the top-10 in three point defense, with opponents hitting less than 30% of their attempts.\n\nSt. Peter's\n\nWelcome back, St. Peter’s. Two years after one of the most improbable runs in March Madness history, the Peacocks return to the dance with a new team, a new coach, but the same slow-paced style that brought them to the Elite 8 two seasons ago. Opponents averaged just over 63 points per game against the Peacocks, and their defensive style is a proven winner in March.\n\nGrambling/Montana St.\n\nThe Tigers will make the first NCAA tournament appearance in program history after winning both the regular season and SWAC tournament titles. Grambling is a battle tested squad after playing one of the most difficult non-conference schedules in the nation. Kintavious Dozier will be the key to success. He has explosive scoring ability, best shown by his 34-point outing against Washington State in December.\n\nThe Big Sky champion Bobcats enter March Madness with an even 17-17 record, but won their conference championship against Montana to clinch their spot in the field of 68. Watch for forward Brandon Walker. He only plays about 50% of each game. But, when he’s on the court, he’s there to score. Walker shoots about 35% of his team’s shots, the eighth-highest rate in the nation.\n\nNCAA tournament bracket revealed | Midwest Region\n\nWest Region\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nIt feels like 2017 for Hubert Davis’ Tar Heels team. For the first time since winning a national title in that 2017 season, the Heels have the ACC player of the year and finished as ACC regular season champions. This is the last ride for ACC MVP RJ Davis and Armando Bacot, and they seem poised for a run to the last Monday night.\n\nArizona\n\nCaleb Love became a Final Four legend with his clutch shot to send North Carolina to the title game. Two years later, Love is now the Pac-12 player of the year at Arizona, where he leads an elite team back to the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats are top-5 in the nation in both scoring offense and scoring margin. They shoot fast and physically dominate the glass.\n\nBaylor\n\nBaylor strays a bit from the common Big 12 mold of dominant defensive teams. But despite occasional struggles on the defensive end, the Bears have found prolonged offensive success by mostly relying on the three-pointer. Baylor is top-5 in the nation in three point percentage, and they have three significant contributors shooting at better than a 40% rate, not including their top two players Ja’Kobe Walter and RayJ Dennis.\n\nAlabama\n\nIf you like offense, watch Alabama. The Tide led the nation by averaging more than 90 points per game in the regular season. Alabama averages a possession length of just over 14 seconds, the third shortest in the nation. If they are making shots, Nate Oats’ team is a legitimate threat to make it to Phoenix.\n\nSt. Mary's\n\nAugustus Marciulionus and Aidan Mahaney are one of the best backcourts in this tournament. Both are long, good shooters and excellent passers. This is one of, if not the best, versions of St. Mary’s basketball we’ve seen under Randy Bennett.\n\nClemson\n\nPJ Hall and Joe Girard are an elite scoring duo that will take Clemson as far as they can go. Girard, a fifth-year transfer from Syracuse, is a high-volume, high-percentage shooter who shot 43% from deep this season. Hall is a force on the inside, who dominates both sides of the floor. Clemson’s shooting ability, along with its size and experience make the Tigers a dangerous team if they start making shots.\n\nDayton\n\nLearn the name DaRon Holmes. He is a monster that plays a similar style to former Dayton star Obi Toppin. The growth of the pieces around Holmes will make Dayton a tough out, as the Flyers have developed into one of the better offensive teams in the field. Watch Kobe Brea. The 6’6\" wing shot 49% from three this season, giving the Flyers a consistent outside scorer to go along with the beast that is Holmes.\n\nMississippi St.\n\nChris Jans’ experienced Bulldogs clinched a tournament bid for the second time in 15 seasons. Josh Hubbard is an awesome point guard that figures to try and shoot Mississippi State to the second weekend for the first time this century. Hubbard and Tolu Smith, who stands more than a foot taller than Hubbuard, combine for one of the nation’s best 1-2 punches.\n\nMichigan St.\n\nIt still feels like it hasn’t quite clicked for Tom Izzo’s Spartans this year. But that might make them scarier than usual. Michigan State is an excellent defensive team that held opponents to less than 66 points per game. Tyson Walker, AJ Hoggard and Malik Hall are all capable scorers at all three levels that could help separate the Spartans in a low-scoring game.\n\nNevada\n\nSteve Alford’s Wolfpack gets to the line at a higher rate than anyone else in this year’s tournament. Kenan Blackshear is an offensive weapon, standing 6’6\" and primarily playing point guard for Nevada this year. Despite the size, he’s a phenomenal passer who creates opportunities for Jarod Lucas, Nevada’s primary scorer, to get involved.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRichard Pitinos’s group is one of the most interesting, and most fun teams in this year’s tournament. They fly up-and-down the court behind arguably the country’s best backcourt trio of Jaelen House, Jamal Mashburn and Donovan Dent. The Lobos don’t shoot particularly well, but their hard-nosed guards get to the paint with ease.\n\nGrand Canyon\n\nGet ready to learn the name Tyon Grant-Foster. The superstar wing on Grand Canyon rarely steps off the floor. He’s an elite three-level scorer that gets to the free throw line at one of the highest rates of any player in America. That trend is consistent across Bryce Drew’s team, as the Antelopes get to the line at a top-5 rate.\n\nCharleston\n\nThe Cougars aren’t necessarily elite at anything, but they are good at everything. Charleston enters the tournament on the nation’s second-longest win streak, fueled by their up-tempo, three-point reliant offense. Charleston gets nearly 40% of its points off the three, the second-highest rate of any team in the tournament.\n\nColgate\n\nColgate has become a March regular, now making its fifth-consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. They aren’t as three-point heavy as they have been the last three seasons, but are still one of the better shooting teams in the field, making better than 35% of their threes. Braeden Smith has developed into an excellent point guard in his sophomore season, becoming one of the country’s best passers and an elite on-ball defender.\n\nLong Beach St.\n\nThe Beach are one of the best stories of this tournament. They fired head coach Dan Monson last week, but allowed him to stick around and coach his squad through the conference tournament. What happened next? Three wins in three days to bring LBSU its first tournament appearance in more than a decade. Marcus Tshonis is awesome; his explosive scoring ability could single-handedly lead a run for LBSU.\n\nHoward/Wagner\n\nThe Bison won three games in three days to clinch the MEAC’s auto-bid. Bryce Harris and eighth-year senior Seth Towns are a very solid duo who combined to average more than 30 points per game. Howard is a high-level shooting team that finished the season shooting 37.5% from deep as a team.\n\nWagner isn’t exactly an offensive powerhouse, but their uniquely slow style of play brought the Seahawks to the NCAA tournament. The craziest part of this improbable run? Wagner has just seven healthy players, and hasn’t been able to hold a practice since December.\n\nNCAA tournament bracket revealed | West Region"
