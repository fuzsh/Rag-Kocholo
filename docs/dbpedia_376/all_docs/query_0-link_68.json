I was born 15 years after the end of the war and I just didn't pay attention to his stories (I am saddened by this). My father passed away in 1989. His name was Roger F. Klug and served in the 11th Armored Division. I have some pins he had collected and three of them had notated the following information: 41st Arm'd Regt.; 41st Tank Bn 9/43-8/45; 778 Tank Bn 9/43-8/45. The last pin has the works \"Hurl the Thunderbolt\" on it. I remember my father attending reunions and receiving a newsletter/publication called The Thunderbolt. If there is anyone who remembers my Dad, I'd love to hear from you. He was from Long Island, NY (East Quogue) and loved the big bands and cars. I imagine those were big topics of discussion for him. He later became a police officer in my hometown of Southampton, NY and acheived the rank of Lieutenant. I miss him very much.

He arrived in England on Oct. 10, 1944. He was a PFC. I am his youngest son. Dad passed away after a long illness on April 5, 1997. He spoke very little about details of his service. He told us that he went to Camp Hood in Texas and he was also stationed in California, I think Lom Poc. His fondest memory which he spoke about was the smell of Hershy Penn. as he was on his way back home. Dads' feet were frozen and this is where he never really talked about his experiences much. Apparently, he was not in Belgium for more than a couple of days before he was shipped back to England for treatment. If anyone remembers him or if you have any pictures of him during his service, I would love to hear from you.\n\nSign Time: December 23 2003 at 10:13:52\n\nVisitor's Name: Deborah Bernstein\n\nEmail: pr4travel@aol.com\n\nHomepage URL: http://\n\nYou are from: Ohio\n\nComments: I'm very sad to report the death of my father, Aaron Bernstein. The bugler has finally called. As Veteran's Day approaches, I wanted to share a poem he wrote for Battery Adjust back in 1945. I'm sorry the spacing doesn't work in this format, but the words and the sentiment certainly do. Best wishes to all of you -- and a final salute and farewell from my dad..... TAPS No more your comrades strident screams Shall mar your peaceful rest; Your battles oer, your strife is done, Sleep deep in Mothers breast. Farewell! Dear friend, farewell, The fevers past. Though gone from us, you know perhaps The buglers playing Taps. Farewell, dear friend, your time has come, Tomorrow then, my turn perhaps To cause the bugles mellow notes Ring though the dusk with measured bars of Taps. How still upon the sunsets breast The mellow, bell-like notes are pressed. Though cannon roar, still all is quiet, As if twere silent. Holy night. The silver tones of Taps Still linger while the twilight falls The saddest of the buglers calls. The notes say, Go to sleep and rest. Farewell, dear friend, farewell. Just one more look before I go. Just one more tear to fall, Just one salute to you and then, God bless your soul, Amen.

I was doing a yahoo search on my last name and came across this site. I would like to say thank you very much to whom ever has put this information on the internet. I only knew that the 2 of them died in WWII, but didn't know too much about them and what they did. So many men and women have served and I am so very thankful to them and to all of you associated with my uncles. The twins still have 2 living siblings living in ND. Rose is the eldest of the family and Albert, I believe was the youngest. They live together on a small farm in rural ND. I am going to get this to them if they don't have something like it all ready.

What made it more special was being there with my grandfather to share in his history. Grandpop served in B Company of the 21st AIB. His experience in the war brought with it good and bad times. The good memories are those of the special bonds he developed with his fellow comrades. They trained, ate, slept, played, and fought together. They were like family and to this day, grandpop thinks about them- especially his comrades who were killed so far away on the far away battlefields of Belgium. I enjoyed the bond my grandfather and I shared that week and will cherish it for the rest of my life.\n\nIn memory of that special event in Buffalo, I want to share a photo I took during the Sing-Along. Included are the men of Company B, of the 21st AIB. May the memory of their sacrifices and contributions live on forever. From left to right: my grandmother (sitting), Gloria Hocker; Ralph Storm, Frank Hartzell, Roger Marquet (Belgian visitor who is well known throughout the ranks of the 11th for shepherding returning veterans around the battlefields they fought on nearly 60 years ago. Roger is an honorary member of the association for what he has done for the 11th Armored veterans over the years. His work is attributed to his sincere appreciation for the soldiers who liberated his country from the Nazis. He has also adopted a few graves of American soldiers buried in Henri Chapel American Cemetary in Belgium), John Fague; my grandfather, Charles Hocker; and the Captain of B Company, Elmore Fabrick. To all a special thanks for what you did. You will always be remembered. All the Best Robert A.

The reason for my interest is that your division, namely its 41st Cavalry Squadron, Troop D, had on May 5, 1945, liberated my mother and myself, then prisoners in concentration camp Mauthausen, Austria. I was born in a slave labor concentration camp Freiberg in Germany, one of the satellite camps of Flossenburg. The next day after I was born the prisoners, all women, were loaded into the train cattle cars and started a 17 day death \"march\" to find an available killing place. On the East were the Russians and the US was advancing from the West. Finally the transport arrived in Mauthausen on April 29, 1945. The gassing stopped that morning. Out of the more than 2000 women only 120 survived and my mother and myself were among them. When the liberation of the Mauthausen happened I was a barely three week old baby, As my dear mother loved to say it to me the tanks had white stars on them and she was absolutely amazed how young all the soldiers were. She remembered the song \"roll out the barrels...\" being played. Due to the malnutrition my body was covered with huge faruncles filled with infection which had to be removed surgically. The surgeons who operated on me did not believe I shall survive if I will not get the proper treatment and begged my mother to return with them to the US. (Yes I do have the scars). She refused to follow their advice reasoning that she must return home, to Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, to wait for her husband, my father. My mother and father were taken to Auschwitz in September 1944. My mother was two months pregnant with me. My father had never returned. I am living in the US now. Needless to say I have been looking and trying to get into contact with the liberators, but must have not chosen the right venue. My request may be totally unreasonable, but perhaps you can help me. I would like very much to find out the names of the surgeons or a surgeon and how to contact any person helping the prisoners following the liberation of Mauthausen. I would like to express my deep gratitude to all liberators of the concentration camp Mauthausen. Thank you in advance for your kind assistance in this matter. Sincerely, Hana Berger Moran, Ph.D.\n\nSign Time: July 02 2003 at 11:28:45\n\nVisitor's Name: Larry David Lawrence\n\nEmail: ldlawre@swbell.net\n\nHomepage URL: http://\n\nYou are from: Houston, Texas\n\nComments: I'm sad to inform those who served in the 11th Armored Division that my father, Elijah David Lawrence, passed away on June 9th. He was a mess sergeant in B Co., 21 AIB, and served from 1942 to 1946. He originally came from Otway, North Carolina. While in training at Camp Barkley (Abilene, Texas), he met Gladys Buske. Immediately after the war, he moved to Abilene, married Gladys, and became a brick mason. He lived in Abilene the remainder of his life, had two sons, and was an active member of Highland Church of Christ. Gladys died in 1976, and he missed her greatly. He remained a brick mason until he retired, and worked on many of the buildings in the central part of Texas. He loved going back home to coastal North Carolina, and we buried him there in the family cemetery, within sight of the house where he was born and the creek where he fished and boated. He was well-loved both in Abilene and North Carolina. He was always proud of his service in the 11th Armored. He often showed us photographs from those days, and told us what he (and you) experienced. He had a great time at the meeting in Omaha several years ago. When he visited us in Houston, he always enjoyed looking at the 11th Armored Association website on our computer. I want to thank you for the friendship you showed my father during the war and after. I also want to thank you for your service to our nation and let you know that your courage and sacrifice will not be forgotten. God bless you.\n\nSign Time: June 26 2003 at 17:36:41\n\nVisitor's Name: Peter King son of Kenneth King\n\nEmail: i777avatari@wmconnect.com\n\nHomepage URL: http://\n\nYou are from: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 73101\n\nComments: Hi members of the the 11th Armored and especially anyone in company C still alive of the 21st infantry batallion.

My son is in the 9th grade and wants to do a report on the 11th Armored and their role in WWII. I don't know, however, where my father 'was' in this division. His name was Vito DonGiovanni. He died in 1975 and didn't talk about the war much. Just that he drove lots of different trucks, he always liked the k-ration trucks but not the ammunition loads they carried. He said they named their trucks after ladies with the first name 'T'. I think that is how I got my name, he was devoted to St. Therese of the Little Flower. Anyway, if any one can tell me how I can find out more specifically what he actually 'did' for the 11th Armored, I'd appreciate it. I know he did say he was in the Battle of the Bulge, Normandy, and served in Gen. Patton's third Army.

Dear Veterans of the 11th Armored Division; I am writing you on behalf of a feature length documentary being produced by our production company for the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans and the SHOAH Foundation, regarding the Liberation of the Mauthausen Concentration Camp System. As a military historian, my role as Chief Historical Consultant is to coordinate the various aspects of research, documentation and production to ensure the accuracy of what goes up on the big screen and make sure the story is told and told right! Much has been written and recorded of the experiences of those who were interned in the Death Camps, but very little has focused on those who actually did the Liberating. Our goal is to tell the story of both sets of heroes  those outside and inside the walls  and to make sure story of the men of the 11th Armored Division is included in the Documentary. Therefore, we are contacting as many Liberators and their families as possible and asking for their assistance with this documentary. We have already conducted the interviews of five camp survivors during the 2002 Liberation Memorial at the camp in Mauthausen and are now contacting the men who fought their way across Europe and actually conducted the Liberation. The history of the 11th Armored Division is well known, and the accomplishments of the Division in its fight across Europe are part of the legend of the US Army in World War II. I am also familiar with your role in the Liberation of the camps of Mauthausen and your subsequent care of those Camp Inmates whom you liberated. However, we are looking for the story in your own words. We are asking for any who would like to share their experience to please contact our office by phone or e-mail with your contact information and to request a copy of our Information Form, so that we can contact you right away. Upon receipt of the form, I will review them and forward to the Producer and Director who will identify those who would best fit the vision of the documentary. I will then begin contacting you by phone to discuss the project and to ask some preliminary questions. Should you then wish to participate and assist us with the documentary, we would then coordinate a time and place when we could meet with you and conduct an on camera interview to be included as part of the documentary. All interviews and information will also become part of the permanent archives of the D-Day Museum, so that generations to come will learn of the service and sacrifice of the Thunderbolts in World War II. Additionally, we are also asking Liberators who have any artifacts or items relating to their service and/or the Liberation to consider loaning them to us for photography and filming and possible inclusion in the documentary. All items will be returned promptly after filming. Please feel free to contact me anytime at my office, toll-free, at 866-422-8853, or by e-mail at pj.mooney@verizon.net should you have any questions about the Information Form or wish to discuss the documentary.

He was with another British soldier and an RAF guy and a tall man in a striped concentration suit, it was taken in front of a jeep with a hosepipe running alongside of it. Also thanks for giving him food and putting him and a few others on a train to Brussels and from there via Dakota to Bushy airfield in England. My Dad (Jim Kingston)had been a pow in Poland during 1940-45, and had been on the long march for three months wth hardly any food when your boys finally got there and fed him and some mates.

My current project, tentatively entitled, \"Rhino Tanks and Sticky Bombs: Yankee Ingenuity in the Second World War,\" examines field expedients developed by U.S. servicemen during the Second World War. In this project, I argue that the \"Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without\" mentality present in the United States prior to 1941, coupled with the preponderance of mechanical items that future soldiers and sailors had access to both prior to and during the war, made U.S. soldiers uniquely suited to find technical solutions to problems they encountered during the course of their wartime experiences. I contend believe that these non-regulation solutions, employed by U.S. soldiers engaged in all theaters of operation, were essential to the ultimate Allied victory. Currently, I am compiling information on as many of these field expedient solutions as possible. If you know of, or participated in the development of such items during the Second World War, I would love to hear your story.

I have no recollection of my uncle but I do have cards and letters written to my mother over 50 years ago that lend some insight into this young soldier. He attempted to enlist on two occasions but was rejected because of poor eyesight and general poor health but was subsequently drafted and was allowed to remain in service. I am grateful for my uncle and men such as he for providing me, my children, and my grandchild the freedom to pursue life and enjoy it abundantly. He is buried at Ft. Harrison, Virginia among Union and Confederate war dead, casualties of the Battle for Richmond. It is an isolated, country location. Peaceful but lonely and sad. No attendent, but the grounds are well tended. I have little hope that anyone in the organization would remember my uncle, but if there is someone I would be grateful for any comments.

He was a great influence in my life, and one of the main reasons why I chose to make the US Army a career. When I was a child, and as recently as last week when I last talked to him, he would talk to me about his WW2 experiences and his Army career in the 11th Armored Division during the Battle of the Bulge and the Central European Campaign; and his later experiences in the Army up to his retirement in 1964. This has helped me in my career as a soldier and for this I am deeply indebted to him. I would love to hear from veterans who knew him so I could have further coorespondence. Thank you. -John E.

First of all, I want to express my appreciation for the 11th Armored Division. The more I read about the company's history, the more I am thankful for every sacrifice the men in that company made. I am also writing because I am currently working on a fiction novel concerning the liberation of the Gusen/Mauthausen camps of May 1945. As an avid reader myself, I know that fiction has power to share important history with many people that might never pick up a history text. In my novel, the main character is a member of the 11th Armored Division. While I have done extensive research on the Internet, my hope is to actually interview members of the division myself. My desire is to have the experiences in the novel be as true to life as possible, thus honoring the men who served. If you know someone that was a part of this liberation and can offer any help in this matter please feel contact me. I would appreciate any help on this matter. Sincerely, Tricia Goyer Tricia Goyer 710 Stone Street Kalispell, MT 59901 (406) 756-0799\n\nSign Time: June 13 2001 at 13:23:16\n\nVisitor's Name: Ralph Holzwarth\n\nEmail: ralphie@acmenet.net\n\nHomepage URL: http://\n\nYou are from: Niverville NY\n\nComments: It's great to have such a website. I was in A Battery, 492nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion and would like to hear from anyone from this unit. I was also in the ASTP at the University of Oregon, studying the Portuguese language and would like to hear from U. of O. people. In 1943 I played fullback for the Ducks (or Webfoots as we were called in those days) and I can remember a huge guy with a Swedish name who used to open big holes in the line for me to run through. Also remember Mrs. Turnipseed who ran the kitchen and used to make us big lunches to take out when we climbed Skinners Butte with our girlfriends. (Whatever happened to them?) My roommates at Oregon were Fecarro, Fenstemaker and Geary. Sgt. Ed Geary (55th Inf., I believe,) died a couple years ago but was best man at my wedding in Paris, France in 1949. I revisited Bastogne and surrounding villages a few years ago and looked for my former foxholes but nature had erased almost all the destruction of the war. In the company of my matronly female Belgian taxi driver, we checked out the German cemetery and both had a good cry, looking at the graves. What a foolish thing war is.\n\nSign Time: March 29 2001 at 18:39:35\n\nVisitor's Name: Toni DeGain\n\nEmail: step2tx@mediaone.net\n\nHomepage URL: http://\n\nYou are from: Michigan\n\nComments: I would like to say thank you for such a wonderful website. My friend Vicki was looking for some kind of information for her mother. Her mother's stepfather was killed during WW2. She was only 12 at the time and still has not had closure on his death. Not only was I able to find his buriel site, but was able to find out how he died. This was all thanks to your wonderful website. Vicki is going to give her mom the booklet I downloaded about the cemetery and the information of the battles he was in and how he died. His name was Clifford K. Mock. He was in the 41st Tank Battalion, 11th Armored Division as a Tech 4, Radio Operator. According to other information I gathered he was awarded the Purple Heart. Thank you for helping to bring closure for her loss. And Thank you all for the sacrifices you made. Sincerely, Toni DeGain\n\nSign Time: March 14 2001 at 21:18:19\n\nVisitor's Name: Roger Marquet\n\nHomepage URL: http://www.users.skynet.be/bulgecriba\n\nYou are from: Belgium\n\nComments: It is amazing to read in the 11th website that some veterans officers said that the Division jumped off on December 29, 1944 ! Accordingly to all the After Action Report of all the units being part of or attached to the 11th, accordingly to the testimonies of ALL my numerous veterans friends from all the different units (some of them took notice of that day in their daybook or else), accordingly to the official history of the 11th, accordingly to all the historian writers like Hugh COLE or CharlesMcDonald, the 11th Armored jumped off on December 30, 1944. It is a fact that the 63rd A.I.B patrolled in Belgium before December 30, but it cannot be looked as a true jumping off. Even the 63rd had his real jumping off day on December 30, 1944 when attacking Remagne. I already had a polemic correspondence with D.A.Howard about that but we were not able to solve the problem. Please, Thunderbolts, tell us your own testimony. Thank you. Roger Marquet Belgian Honorary Lifetime Member\n\nSign Time: January 15 2001 at 09:59:30"
