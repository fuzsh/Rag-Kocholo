        "text": "Hey everyone! I’ve mostly started sharing my favorite memos and transcripts over at A Letter a Day, but as it’s more of a tasting menu, I’m reticent to post multiple memos or transcripts from the same person. That said, I’m thinking about booting this website back up as a place to share interesting things from people I’ve already featured on A Letter a Day.\n\nThis post is a transcript (and the slides) of Bill Gurley’s September 2023 talk “2,851 Miles.” I’ve already featured Bill in Letter #14, so I thought I’d share this here.\n\nOn Sept 12, 2023, Benchmark’s Bill Gurley gave a presentation at the All-In Summit titled “2,851 Miles” where he discussed the past, present, and future of regulatory capture in Silicon Valley.\n\nHe received a standing ovation and his presentation was dubbed “an instant classic.”\n\nFormer PayPal COO David Sacks immediately called it “the best talk in the history of All-In” and said “we need to get it out there immediately so it can start going viral. And I think it will go very viral.”\n\nFirst Round’s Chris Fralic thought it was “So good. A Perfect TEDTalk” and “it’s gold.”\n\nShopify Founder and CEO Tobi Lutke commented that everyone should “definitely watch [Bill’s] incredible talk… once it comes out.”\n\nOne audience member liked it so much he yelled at Bill to run for President as the applause settled down.\n\nI found the talk full of interesting anecdotes and wanted to be able to refer back to it easily, so I transcribed the talk and screengrabbed the slides. Sharing it below and also on Twitter (if you prefer threads).\n\nTranscript\n\nI’m Bill Gurley. I got to Silicon Valley in about 1997. And was fortunate enough to become a venture capitalist in 98. And the entire first year of my career, I had zero interest in interacting with any form of government. It didn’t seem necessary for what I was trying to do. I was working with founders and software and technology. I didn’t see what it would bring me.\n\nUntil one day where I ran into an issue, which I’ll tell you about later, that required me to understand what was going on in Washington. So I checked in with a few advisors, they introduced me to this lawyer in DC. Turns out, DC lawyers do a lot of things that aren’t lawyering. And he listened to what I had [to say], he said, I’ll call you back. He calls me back. He says, Bill, I got exactly what you need. I found a congressman on the committee that matters to what you’re talking about. And I can set up a meeting. I go Great, I’ll fly out. He goes, No, no, no, don’t fly out. He’s coming to you. He’s coming to me? That’s pretty nice. He goes, Do you have a conference room? I said, I’m a venture capitalist. We have lots of conference rooms. So he said, I need you to get some people together. And here’s the catch. They need to bring $5,000 each.\n\nHung up the phone. Started thinking, All right, I got six people. we got board member, CEO, $5000, $30,000. He calls me back next week — How’s it going? Great. I got six people, $5000 ready to go. He goes, Most of these meetings have 10 to 12 people. I said Shit. Like, now I’m inviting people that don’t even have anything to do with this thing and like having to help them out.\n\nI’m up $60k. I hang up. He calls me back a week later. He goes, Bill, how’s it going? I go, Ah, shit. I got 12 people, everybody’s got a check, we’re ready to go. I’m losing interest at this point. He goes, Do they have spouses? I’m like, What kind of question is this, do they have spouses? He goes Yeah, let’s let’s have their spouses right $5,000 each. I go, Our conference room’s not big enough for the spouses! He goes, they don’t have to come.\n\nThis is a true story by the way, true story. And it would go on to happen two more times in my life and then I stopped meeting with congressmen.\n\nThe reason that I needed to engage relates to this company. My fourth VC investment was in a company called Tropos Networks. We had an industrial grade mesh Wi-Fi, you could mount it on a telephone pole and bathe the city in Wi-Fi, broadband. It was awesome. We were so excited about it, we were changing the world. It was disruptive. Google got excited about it. Earthlink got excited about it. But the customer I loved the most that got excited about it where mayors. There were hundreds of mayors all over the country that wanted to provide free Wi-Fi service across their downtown area. It would help with public safety, economic development, and of course, digital divide. So, we were so thrilled, I was so pumped, I was sure we had a winner here.\n\nAnd then one day, these two people got excited, which turned out not to be a good thing. This is Mayor Street of Philadelphia and his CIO, Diana Neff. They got just as excited as I did. They were idealistic. They were optimistic. Maybe they were quixotic. Maybe I was too.\n\nBecause the next thing that happened is what caused me to get that meeting. You can’t read this, but it says Lobbyists Try to Kill Philly Wireless Plan. And in the article, it says Philly’s plan to offer an inexpensive wireless Internet service, the most ambitious yet, collided with commercial interests. Collided with commercial interests. There were no voters or citizens up in arms about this. Commercial interest.\n\nHow many of you–I know this is a younger crowd–how many of you are old enough to remember Schoolhouse Rock? Awesome. So like you, I learned about how Congress works by ABC Saturday morning television. And they told us–there’s a phrase in this–I looked up the script. It said some folks back home wanted a law, so they called their local congressman. Implying that the people that have the need are the citizens and the people that write the law, the congressmen.\n\nImagine how surprised I was when I read this: Philadelphia was embarking on the research phase of the project when Verizon successfully pushed a bill through the state legislature. Verizon is writing legislation? How does that work? Now it turns out, this wasn’t even our biggest problem.\n\nBecause another company is headquartered in Philadelphia named Comcast. They had put a bill on Governor Rendell’s desk. Proposal drafted by lobbyists for the telecommunications companies. This isn’t what I learned on Schoolhouse Rock.\n\nThe governor whose bill that was on the desk of is Ed Rendell. He’s on the right. Before he was governor, he was mayor of Philadelphia. The gentleman in the middle is named Michael Nutter. He would go on to replace Street and was a longtime council member. But the guy on the left was the real nemesis. This is David Cohen, Chief Lobbyist for Comcast.\n\nNow David Cohen is to corporate lobbying what Bob Marley is to reggae. He’s like, there’s just, there’s no second. The New York Times did a profile of him called Comcast’s Real Repairman, in which they say he is the most important executive in the whole company. And I fundamentally believe that. It also said he’s probably one of the most savvy corporate political operatives in the history of US business. The article on the right from The Enquirer calls him Philadelphia’s Most Powerful Unelected Official. I don’t even know how you can put those words together. So here we are. Here we are in our little conference room with our spousal-enhanced checkbooks. And this is like a second grader challenging Michael Jordan to a game of one on one for money. Like, we were pissing in the ocean. We had no chance. No chance.\n\nNow, guess who offers citywide Wi Fi? That one’s easy.\n\nAT&T would join this fight; within two years, they would outlaw municipal broadband in over 22 states. They’d just write it into the book. And just took the power of these local decision-makers away from them. All in the interest of the commercial interest, not the citizen.\n\nI want to talk about another piece of telecom legislation. My partnership back in those days invested in telecom equipment, and so we were very interested in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This was heralded as the most important telecommunications reform in 62 years.\n\nNow, this one’s simple. I’m just going to use the headlines from Wikipedia.\n\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 had two goals: to “promote competition,” and to “encourage the rapid development of new technologies.”\n\nLet’s see how things went. In 1996, the top four had 48% market share. Four or five years later, after this heralded legislation, they’re up to 85%. That didn’t work.\n\nLet’s check in on the second one. Were they promoting innovation? This is a chart of VC dollars into telecom equipment. This used to be 15% of what VCs did. Within 10 years it had gone below 1%, and a year later, the NVCA stop tracking it. Now if you want to talk to one of the expert VCs in telecommunications equipment, it’ll be easy to do because they’re retired. This market’s gone. There is no more innovation in telecom equipment.\n\nSo what happens here? How can you possibly have a super important bill signed by, and implemented by, one of the most heralded presidents in our generation, that doesn’t just fail, failing would be things stay the same, and you don’t accomplish the goal. This did the did even worse. It created the opposite thing of what it was supposed to go do.\n\nLet me introduce you to George Stigler. He’s the 1982 Nobel Prize winner in economics and the father of regulatory capture. This is his most famous quote: “As a rule, regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit.” I like to say, “Regulation is the friend of the incumbent.” Quick audience interaction moment. That’s the one thing I want you to take away. So on the count of three, scream “regulation is the friend of the incumbent.” 1, 2, 3. [Audience shouts.] Yes! Amen! All right.\n\nSo, this is the only slide I have with bullets, because this is going to be a two minute Regulatory Capture 101. All from George Stigler’s notes. The first thing he says, “In regulatory capture, a special interest is prioritized over the general interests of the public,” — sound familiar from my other stories? — “leading to a net loss for society,” a net loss for society. That’s important. The two mechanisms they usually use is the second bullet, limited market entry and price protection, or even price increases, which I’ll show you more of. And then the mechanisms of influence are money, made worse by Citizens United, exposure, just time around people, and then three, revolving doors. This is super important, and I’ll show you one great example of that. That’s people moving in and out… When they interviewed Christie on the pod the other day, they were talking about this in the military.\n\nAll right, this is a piece of Morgan Stanley research from 1999. Someone took the time to go study five pieces of major US legislation that had happened over the years, and how the incumbent stocks did after the legislation. And let’s just steal a few sentences from this: “conclude that landmark regulatory action has a tendency to improve returns for the largest players in the targeted industry. Long term investors should consider capitalizing on any temporary weakness caused by market reaction to regulation. Many attempts to increase competition or improve customer experience have failed.” This is reinforcing what Stigler taught us.\n\nHere’s a very simple quick one. Number of new banks in the US. 2009, nothing.\n\nDodd Frank. Like, that’s what happens.\n\nAll right, two really good stories. You might not even believe them, because they’re so outlandish. Does everyone know who Epic is? It’s hard to know, because they’re not public. It’s a very large private company in Wisconsin that is the largest player in EHR software, medical records. And this is their CEO, Judith Faulkner. Now, in, get the year right, 2009, Obama put her on his Health IT Council. She was the only corporate representative. Should not surprise you that she’s a major donor to Obama.\n\nNow, Obama passed the American Recovery Act, that was his big piece of stimulus, kind of like Biden’s inflation act that happened recently, and tucked underneath that, easy to hide in this big bill, is an act that was, the acronym’s HITECH, it’s this health information technology thing. And then they created an agency called ONC that oversaw it. Now, this is the part you’re not gonna believe. They came up with a brilliant idea. I have to assume she helped encourage this. Doctors would receive $44,000 each if they bought software. $38 billion. This is true, you can look it up. I’m not making it up. $44,000, give it to a doctor, implement some software. For many of you who run companies, that’d be pretty cool, right? The government passed a law, so they buy your software, they get money. It’d make it a lot easier.\n\nNow, you may be thinking, Are doctors needy? But here’s the catch. You remember, this happened because of the mortgage meltdown. Doctors own multiple homes, so they have multiple mortgages, so they probably needed the assistance. Now, there’s two more things about this act that are also unbelievable. First, there’s a flaw. If someone said you’re gonna pay people to buy software, most people would be like, Well, you’re gonna have a problem. They’re gonna buy it and they’re not going to use it, right? Well, they thought of that. So guess what? The second phase, doctors got paid 17,000 more dollars to prove they were using it. It was called Meaningful Use. Plastered all over the website of all the EHR vendors at the time. It gets even better! So the the ONC decided the threshold of features you would need for your software to comply with this mandate. And I’m assuming they kind of took Epic’s feature set and plowed it into this spreadsheet. But they got the Department of Justice to enforce people that didn’t have the feature set that were getting the payments.\n\nAnd you had three record fines. 155mn, 57mn, 145mn, against the lesser competitors of Epic. Unreal.\n\nIf you’ve studied the innovator’s dilemma, the way startups disrupt is they come in with lower feature products, but a feature that really matters to the customer in a simpler product, and they move up.\n\nThey put a brick wall there, so you couldn’t come up. It’s just amazing.\n\nObama, in an interview with Ezra Klein, said this was the most disappointing part of Obamacare. I mean, I think if any of us were in the room when they scratched this thing out, I could have told him it would have failed. I mean, paying people to do stuff is just… it’s not going to work.\n\nNow you may ask, am I am I unhappy with Judith? I’m disgusted with it.\n\nBut, but, if I were a judge in the Olympic regulatory capture competition, I’m giving her a 10! This is fantastic. Fantastic!\n\nAll right, one more: revolving doors. This is one more.\n\nSo, many of you know what this is. This is a COVID Rapid antigen test. Now, this is based on a very simple piece of technology — hopefully David will confirm this when it comes back up — called a lateral flow assay.\n\nNow, this technology was developed 80 years ago in 1943, and it’s a complete commodity. The packaging almost doesn’t matter. You could probably use the strip without it. Now, before I tell you what happened in the US, let me tell you what happened in Europe.\n\nGermany leaned heavily into rapid tests. They got their scientists together, and they evaluated 122 different vendors, and validated 96 of them.\n\nHere they are on the right, 96 different vendors that they okayed.\n\nAnd as a result, in the German market, you could buy five tests for €3.75 or €0.75/test. UK leaned in as well. They got them in such numbers and so cheap they distributed them to people’s homes.\n\nSo what was going on in the US? Around that time, The New York Times did an article like, Here’s what’s going on with antigen tests. First of all, they fought them forever. And I think that may be capture as well, because the hospitals were making a ton of money on PCR tests. I think they they made as much money as they did on vaccines. But that’s another story. Here, it says all the manufacturers are ramping up production, but right now that they’re hard to find. And then it lists which tests are available, and they only list three vendors: Abbott, Ellume, and Quidel. Three vendors.\n\nNow, you can play along on your phone. If you want to, go on LinkedIn. This guy’s name is Timothy Stenzel. Now, he works for the FDA. And he runs a group that oversees which antigen test gets approved. I know this because he would write scathing letters to the ones he rejected that you can also look up online.\n\nNow, guess what? You’re not going to be surprised. Five years at Quidel. Four years at Abbott.\n\nIt gets worse. President Biden decided finally to lean into antigen tests and authorize $2 billion to go purchase tests. He should have gone to Germany and bought them out of the stores, but instead… but instead, he bought them from these guys. Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever used this test. All that packaging is complete and utter bullshit and unnecessary. That popsicle stick thing, like everyone else uses the lateral flow assay plastic thing that you can buy super cheap. This was over engineered.\n\nAnd then, and then I got really pissed. Because The Wall Street Journal wrote an article that was a victory lap for Abbott’s antigen test execution and how well they did in the market. And I’ve never met Brianna or Peter, but I hope they get to watch this because the first thing that should have done in the article is put a big picture of Timothy Stenzel, because that’s why this thing worked. And they write the eye-catching card on a lollipop stick as if though it was so cute, everyone bought it. Like, if you tried to sell that thing in Germany, how many would sell? Zero. Like, at $12 a test.\n\nYesterday, I — just for kicks, kinda, I went online. This is Walgreens and CVS antigen test. Their seven tests are all exactly $23.99. What is that? That’s not a marketplace. That’s not open competition. I also went on Boots, the famous UK — the tests are about $1.50, $1.60, per. Today! So you have a 6x differential in these tests today. And by the way, I’m not even talking about the fact that our citizenry may have been much enhanced by having rapid tests at a much lower price if they were treated as the commodity they were. Of course, they weren’t.\n\nNow, Washington’s got its eyes on Silicon Valley. And it’s from both sides. We got Lindsey Graham, we got Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThere’s an article here that says Marjorie Greene agrees with AOC — breaking up big tech. And you say why? Why are they so interested in tech?\n\nThis is a poll of voters — voters don’t care. Voters are more worried about the industries where there’s a lot of regulatory capture. But they want to come after tech. I think I know why. I think they want them in the system, like the military, like finance, like telecom. They want them in the system because there’s money. Now, if Elizabeth Warren attacks big tech, you think they might go fund the competitor.\n\nAnd you probably can’t read this, but this is OpenSecrets. Spend time on OpenSecrets. Four of the top 10 contributors to Elizabeth Warren are Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon. You attack them, they have to come to you.\n\nSome of our peers in Silicon Valley seem to want them to come too! I think they’ve read Stigler. Circle: please regulate us!\n\nBrian’s on later, so this is risky: The more regulation — I think he’s right, by the way — the more regulation, the better for Coinbase. That’s exactly what Stigler would say.\n\nMark Zuckerberg needs, wants, and must have regulation. I get it, Mark!\n\nAnd Sam’s just getting started. He wants regulation too!\n\nNow, here’s a really scary thing in this AI space. The incumbents that are running to meet with all the government are spreading something that I don’t think is accurate or fair. They’re spreading a negative open source message. And I think it’s precisely because they know it’s their biggest threat. And I think what Meta’s done with Llama II is actually super interesting.\n\nAll right, I’m gonna wrap up with three things. Three takeaways. First, I’m not convinced we’re very good at regulation. All four of the stories I told you were failures. Like, they were a net loss for society, as Stigler says. This is a picture of Patrick Moynihan, who was one of the best senators I think we’ve ever had. He kept a picture of a pin behind his desk as a reminder. He felt like Congress should have to have something similar to the Hippocratic Oath that doctors have: First, do no harm. And the reason he has that point of view is he feels personally responsible for the homeless situation in America. He signed an act with JFK in 1963 that shut down the mental health institutions. It had a second piece that was supposed to prop something up. This happens with policy, second part didn’t happen, emptied out the mental health. And when everyone talks about the homeless problem, they should read this interview with him because they don’t go back and talk about this issue, but it’s very relevant. So I don’t think we’re very good at it. That’s the first thing.\n\nSecond, I think regulatory capture gives capitalism a bad name. A couple people yesterday said, Oh, we got to fix capitalism. I think where capitalism is broken is where the capture’s the highest, right, like I just showed you some examples. You’ve seen these charts of price across time. And the highly competitive products coming out of Silicon Valley are dropping like crazy. It’s healthcare and education and those kinds of things where you have price increases.\n\nLastly, one of my favorite authors is Matt Ridley. And these two books really cover the span of human time. And he talks about how three things: technology, commerce, and the sharing of ideas, leads to prosperity for people, leads to increases in standard of living. And my big fear is that regulation is the opposite of this. It’s a blocker to innovation. So if you care about prosperity, and you kill innovation, you’re going to kill prosperity, from my point of view.\n\nSo, in closing, the reason I picked this title is Silicon Valley’s 2,851 miles away from Washington. And as these people put their eyes towards this, I would state the following: The reason Silicon Valley has been so successful is because it’s so fucking far away from Washington DC. Thank you.\n\nThen, David Sacks, Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya, and David Friedberg join Bill on stage for a discussion and Q&A.

When that leader leaves, the company falls apart (ie Henry Singleton at Teledyne). However, LVMH may actually buck that trend – Alexandre Arnault has a special ability to marry modernity and heritage (time) and east and west (geography) like no one I’ve seen before him. I, for one, am quite excited to see how LVMH continues to evolve going forward.\n\nThis is a talk Alexandre gave at Goldman Sachs back in 2020, when he was still CEO of Rimowa. In this talk, he touches upon his journey with Rimowa, his management style, philosophy on technology and heritage brands, the synergies that come with the conglomerate structure, his favorite CEO, and how he thinks about partnerships.\n\n*Any transcription mistakes should be attributed to me.\n\nHost: Welcome to Talks at GS. I’m Josh Murray, managing director in the investment banking division. And we’re pleased to have with us today Alexandre Arnault, the CEO of Rimowa. Alexandre took over Rimowa in 2017 when LVMH, his family’s business, bought a majority stake in the company. Over that time, as we’ll spend a little bit today talking about an emphasis on the digital strategy, retail stores over the wholesale channel, and then partnerships, which if any of you guys follow him on Instagram, you’ll be very familiar with. So thanks for joining.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Thanks for having me.\n\nHost: Let’s start the beginning. You obviously grew up in Paris, I think folks know who your father is, your mother’s a professional pianist. What advice as you were growing up did they give you? Let’s start pre-Rimowa as you were getting into business, going through school.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: I think more than advices it was bit more about education and values, learning about the values of work, values of family, trust, things like that. Also very present parents throughout my life, they were here. My mom was working from home on her piano so it was quite easy. And my dad was very present also, meals, dinners, breakfast, and stuff. It was a great time with them. More than advice, really more about education, excellence at school, and things like that.\n\nHost: And you went to school in Paris. What did you study?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Engineering, Computer Science.\n\nHost: Got it. Okay. That’s an interesting transition from…\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah, France also has a way where engineering schools are supposed to be the best. So when you don’t really know what you want to do, you go there because it was what opens the most doors.\n\nHost: Got it. And then you went to KKR and McKinsey, you didn’t go to Goldman Sachs?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: I did not, no.\n\nHost: I’m offended by that.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: I tried. I applied. I didn’t get it.\n\nHost: I find that hard to believe.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: But they didn’t call me back.\n\nHost: So what did you take away from those experiences? You ultimately came back and joined LVMH. What led you to that decision, as opposed to sort of staying in the sort of finance, consulting worlds?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah, I did those two experiences in New York, which were great, because I was basically a junior guy at those companies, treated like every other junior people, which is good to start any career, because you really understand what is really work like at those levels. And I was interested in consulting and private equity just to have access to different kinds of businesses than the ones I had seen my whole life. I remember, I was working at McKinsey with a team working on financial services in a bank in Wilmington, Delaware, topics I had no idea of. And KKR was also super interesting. To learn how to become a real shareholder, make investments, buy companies, sell them, things like that, it was with with a really structured mindset, whereas at LVMH, sometimes the mindset is not that structured [unintelligble] acquisitions or things like that.\n\nHost: So then why what led you to sort of come back closer to home and join the business,\n\nAlexandre Arnault: I guess, personal passion A, which is something that I’ve grown up with my whole life. I always like to say I started working when I was born, because going to stores and seeing brands being built out since my younger age was a real chance. And then just wanting also to build something there of my own and work in this industry, for sure.\n\nHost: So you decided to come back to LVMH. What was it about Rimowa? It’s obviously not a brand that was already in the portfolio. What was it about that? How did that conversation go?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: I think it’s a good set of coincidences, to be honest. I was actually, when I came for my internship at McKinsey, I needed a big suitcase and I bought a Rimowa suitcase back then in Paris at [unintelligible], one of our stores. And why did I buy it? Because obviously I like the quality, I like the design, I thought it was a super cool product, useful. And little by little, when I started also continuing to see all the stores from the group, I would see stores from Rimowa pop over in LA and Tokyo. I would see a set of really relevant people carrying the suitcases and I always thought they were the best quality ones. We were making some, mostly at Louis Vuitton, our hero brand. They were great, but it was like 3,000, $4,000 pieces of luggage that also you can’t really show up everywhere when you’re 18 or 19 years old. So originally what I did…\n\nHost: He might disagree.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Oh, he disagreed, believe me. I was a bit of a rebel. And little by little, I tried to basically get in touch with the owner. I found out it was a German company, family-owned since 120 years. And I reached out with two ideas in mind, because coming from a family business, he had a son. In my mind, he was going to give the company to his son and perpetrate what his grandgrandfather had founded. So I thought A) we could either try to make a minority investment and help him grow or B) make a partnership with one of our brands so that our suitcases become better. Took about two years of courtship where I kind of showed him what we were doing in the group, in our factories, in our wineries, and so on. He was also showing me what they were doing there. And one day he he calls me up in his office in Cologne, I had absolutely nothing to tell him because I had really spent two years really getting to know him. And he said, You know, look, I have one son, he doesn’t want to take over the business. Are you interested in buying the company? So he took out a big book like this from his briefcase that was handwritten with all the accounts. A real family business in Germany. And you know, I said, Look, we have to look into it, and everything. And then he said, I have one condition if you make the deal, is that you become CEO. So I, I had no…\n\nHost: It was not already your intention?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: No, no, it was not my intention. So then I came back to Paris, we made the case, and it made sense. So the group approved.\n\nHost: And how was the discussion with LVMH, your dad, whoever the person was?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah. So I didn’t want to have it with my dad, to be quite, I guess partial, also. And I had discussions with the key people there. So CFO, Managing Director, and it was a growing business that I thought we had a lot of leverage to…\n\nHost: Quality, obviously…\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah, quality fit, it had all the criterias of one of our brands. It was also kind of uniquely positioned. The price was good at the right time, as well. So it was it was quite a no brainer when we came to this. No bankers were involved in the transactions.\n\nHost: That’s okay.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Sorry.\n\nHost: You can’t win them all. So you took over a CEO. How did you, and I guess you were co-CEO initially, and became CEO, how did you introduce new ideas while honoring what had already been in place? Was that a challenge? How did you sort of go with that?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah, it was, honestly, it was a bit of a challenge in the beginning because the whole team had been handpicked by the former CEO. They were all working together for 20, 30, 40 years, they knew each other perfectly well, they were used to a certain way of working. And obviously, when I arrived with different ideas, it was a bit of a challenge for some of them. But little by little, you know, when you make the first collaboration people tell you you’re crazy, and then they see stores getting hijacked and people camping in front of the stores, maybe the second one will work as well. And it’s sort of those little wins that that were quite good for the company itself. Same with the stores. Because originally, people didn’t think that opening those standalone retail stores, when you look at the highest, the most expensive Avenues in the world, was necessarily a good idea. But you know, little by little we did it, we started getting away from from the non-qualitative wholesale that we had a lot of in the US, mom and pop shops around the street corners, to open our own stores to tell our own story, have our own relationship with clients. And it’s been very successful. Again, open one, two, you have to push it forward. And then when they work, it’s easier.\n\nHost: Yeah, I guess the obvious question is, So, young guy, French, taking over a German business that has been run by family for a long time. Was that, Was there any resentment there, was that culturally difficult to deal with?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: So I think, it was obviously, in the beginning, the first day where we acquired the company, people were very scared, they thought that they were going to lose their jobs or we were going to… nobody really understands from the outside what LVMH is, so they thought, I heard a million things. I heard, Are you going to close the business and rename it Louis Vuitton to build Vuitton suitcases? Are you going to fire everyone and hire a new team? None of which we did. The most fun thing, which was actually quite interesting, and gave me a lot of goodwill was the first day, when it came out in the press, I went to Germany and I asked for the whole company to come into the this big hall, like 400 or 500 people to introduce myself, introduce the group, tell them who we were and everything and I started my speech and after two, three minutes, I was seeing the faces of people really starting to almost cry. So I said, What am I saying wrong? I thought I had scripted something and then some came up on the stage and told me nobody speaks English. So I said, okay, thank God, I had learned German for 12 years at school. So I switched immediately and I spoke German. And immediately people are like, Oh, my God, wow, thank God, you speak German. And that was actually quite good to give me goodwill within the company.\n\nHost: So you’ve now been in that role for three years?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah.\n\nHost: What have you learned about yourself, management style, sort of over those three years?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: So many things. Because obviously, I’d never managed a company before. I had seen them at board level, and investing level, and all these things, but never in the core business. I think, two or three things that are very important, One is that I guess you could never go fast enough. And at the beginning, it’s always very difficult to make decisions. Hire people, fire people. The faster you go, the faster the company is able to grow again. And then I think, also being present on the, I guess you say on the field or on the grounds, was also something that’s extremely important that I also learned from my father. He visits stores every weekend since he has the group and goes to the US, Asia, like, every month, basically. And you need to spend time with the teams to understand what they need, what the customers need, also. And, yeah, I think also what was important was building a core team of people, some of which are here today, who understand the vision, understand where we want to go, what we want to build, from scratch. And having people really trust you, trust themselves, and understand the bigger picture.\n\nHost: And you talked about growth of the business. Is there a balance to be had there in terms of hypergrowth in terms of expansion and overexposure? How do you think about that? Because obviously, history is littered with a number of companies who tried to grow too quickly and outgrew themselves. And that didn’t…\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah, so if you look at it from the outside and numbers wise, the company was, the numbers are public, when we bought it, it was 440 million euros in sales. And this is, 2019 was the first year that we’re going to close at a higher number than this. The first year, we did a lot of noise, a lot of store openings, a lot of collaborations. But we had such an important wholesale presence that getting rid of that and closing down those accounts was making us lose a lot of revenue. So in terms of actual growth, we didn’t grow super fast. But retail grew extremely fast, for sure. I think the category is so big, we sell almost a million suitcases a year. There’s potential to sell several million. If you look at the population in the US, look at the size of Tumi, the size of other companies here, the population in Asia, China, there’s I think 70 million people every year who go from low class to middle class in China, which is people that basically get some disposable income. So 1% of that is already a quite big number to target, and I don’t think we’re at the stage where we can be scared of hypergrowth so far.\n\nHost: So switching gears a little bit. As a millennial, and somebody who’s very much into tech, how have you tried to marry technology with this long-standing brand?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah. So there’s a few things. There’s technology to communicate and tell the story. There’s technology within the product. First within the product, I’m not a big believer in adding tech to some sort of products like these because the suitcase is something you’re super, it’s quite an expensive product, it retails for 800 to $1,000 in the US, and you’re supposed to keep it for 10 years, basically, it’s super resistant. There’s no piece of technology that can stay relevant for 10 years in a suitcase and you’re always gonna have to update it, to change it or something. So even if you put you know a battery charger or things like that, I don’t really see the value created in this. We’ve tried to pull away from technology embedded in the product, invest everything into the technicity of the products, of the materials, the wheels, the handles, the lightness, all the things that make it a great engineering product. Then when it comes to communication, we’ve really tried to, on that side, get ahead of what’s happening in…\n\nHost: You’ve moved all digital?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah, we have zero print advertising since since we took over the company. Everything digital, experimenting with new platforms as soon as they come out, the latest one being Tiktok. We’re, I think, the first first brand to partner with them. And some initiatives with Snap. All these things who I think allow us to reach new customers and tell our story in a better way and also get more data. Because one thing that I’ve always been frustrated about being, like you say a millennial, is that I don’t really spend a lot of time reading magazines yet I see how much our brands spend in Vogue, GQ, Alister. I always questioned myself on the efficiency of this, and the end of the day, everybody questions the efficiency because you don’t really know.\n\nHost: And is that a philosophy that’s being brought more broadly to the LVMH family?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: No. Because for brand building purposes, I think it’s, well, general belief is that it’s quite important to still be present in those mediums. There’s definitely a rebalancing of the share between digital and print. But I think print stays quite important for us and for the brands.\n\nHost: One of the things that a lot of people in this room, particularly on the banking side, over the last handful of years, one of the things we’ve seen is very large conglomerates breaking themselves up. LVMH has obviously gone the other way. What benefits do you feel like you derive from being part of the larger parent?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: So the way the group is structured, we have 70 houses, basically, and I was telling you this before we came, it’s basically like a private equity fund, on an evergreen model, where all the brands are very independent with their own management companies, own teams centrally in the regions and everything. But we never sell the businesses, hence the evergreen model. There’s some very light synergies at the central level. Why light? Because we think that if you bring too many synergies, you lose creativity. For example, if Rimowa was going to start supplying other brands with luggage, then the other brands would have to have the constraints that we have and it wouldn’t be creative. Same with fashion and everything else. Evident synergies are media-buying, obviously. When you buy media for 70 brands, you get better deals than if you buy brand by brand. Real estate, when you go and open up in a mall and you have 70, or I guess 25 from the fashion and leather goods side come and sign leases, you get better rents. People, 140,000 people who all want to evolve and change positions and be promoted and everything. In one company, it’s not possible. In a group, it’s quite good. Yeah, I guess those are the three main main synergies we have, and no synergies when it comes to creativity or anything else.\n\nHost: Okay. One word I don’t think you’ve used, which I know you don’t like using, is luxury.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: I don’t use it.\n\nHost: Can you explain why you don’t use it?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yea, for sure. In our financial communication, we call ourselves the world leader in luxury goods. I don’t like to use it because I think it’s too linked to price. And I don’t think our industry has anything to do with price. When you think luxury, you think stores where you’re going to have things you can’t afford and you’re going to be scared to go inside and everything. And to me, when you buy a Vuitton bag for $4,000, it’s a lot of money, it’s a luxury product. When you buy a bottle of Moet champagne for $40, it’s a luxury product. A lot of people can afford this. Or Dior mascara for 25. Why? Because all those products, whether it’s the $40 bottle of champagne, the $1,000 Rimowa suitcase, or the million dollar Tiffany necklace, or whatever, are made with the same level of craftsmanship, of quality, of all the things that make those products desirable. And I don’t think price should really come into the equation.\n\nHost: What are you most excited about? That’s in the future for Rimowa.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: I think product expansion. One thing that’s very frustrating to me and to most people in the teams is that the suitcase is present with the customer only at the dreadful part of traveling. I don’t know a lot of people who enjoy spending time in an airport. When you’re at your destination or at home, the suitcases in your hotel room or in your closet. So the interactions between the brand and the customers are in a bad moment of the travel. And so we’ve been trying to develop products to be present with the customers more on a day to day basis. The first one is, you know, iPhone covers that we have here that we just, we launched [crosstalk]… we’ve sold 10s of 1000s of them and it was it was a big success and now we’ve launched small clutches as well with Dior recently that have been going super well. And little by little, you’ll see us come out with new products in the travel sphere that are both true to our brand and yet true to our promise of functional desirability. And they have to stay A) desirable and B) extremely functional also.\n\nHost: And how do you, what is the, you talked a little bit about the cycles? How do you decide that it’s going to work? Like how do you test that product from sort of an idea to actually creating it to market?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: You make that, you take risks. You can’t really test it the way you could test, like, you’re going to launch a red suitcase, let’s put the red suitcase in a few stores and see if it works, and then produce big ones because it’s such a new product and the brand is such not known for these that our teams know the customers and the brand inside out. And we really talk with them, the sales teams in the market and everyone, and from there, we make a decision of pushing it or not pushing it. The small clutch was a great example. We were doing it with Dior, and we had, really people telling us that you should only produce 500 of them, or you should produce 30,000 of them. The answer is closer to 30,000 than to the 500. In the end of the day, it was a risk that we took. We produced them all, we put them in the stores. And they worked [unintelligible] because we had the feeling and the [unintelligible] that it was it was going to resonate well with clients.\n\nHost: So you’ve talked a couple times about the partnerships that you’ve pursued. Initially it was Off-white and Supreme. How did those come about? What was the strategy behind that? If you can talk a little bit about that.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Yeah, yeah, sure. So there’s there’s no strategy. It’s really…\n\nHost: Brands that you like?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: No, I think it’s a few things. One, it’s A) authenticity. So we never want to do something just to, we don’t want to partner with Supreme to target millennials, or we don’t want to do this to target older women, or whatever. We really want to do things that are authentic. So in everything we’ve done, we’ve partnered with brands who have real legitimacy in their own fields. If you look at, Fendi was the first luxury brand we partnered with which is renowned for travel goods. Also, Supreme, Off-white, Aesop, the cosmetics, Bang and Olufsen, the headphones. Now Dior. I’m forgetting a ton of them, obviously, but I think authenticity was key. And then excitement of the idea. We didn’t want to just make a suitcase with a brand because the brand was cool. We wanted to have a broader project around it and have something that was A) true to us and true to them. So I always like to say that I view the suitcases like a canvas, because they’re silver with a shape that’s very recognizable with the grooves, but anyone could express themselves on them. Brand, celebrities, artists, whatever, and it would still be A) a Rimowa suitcase and then B) reinterpreted by someone else.\n\nHost: Over the next 5, 10 years, how do you see your business evolving as technology changes? Obviously, there’s been a seismic shift in retail generally. We’ve seen in the US malls closing, brick and mortar going away, things moving online. How does that all impact you guys and what do you see going forward?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: So I think for us at Rimowa, and at the group, retail is very important for a few reasons. The main one being the experience. I think when you spend that much money on a product, you want to go and see it. You want to go and see it, touch and feel it. People like spending time in stores. Here in New York for two days, it’s a lot of, it’s very fun and instructive and creative and things to just walk through the streets and see stores see who’s doing what instead of just being behind the screen. Yet, especially at Rimowa, you don’t want to leave the store with two bags with things the sizes of washing machines. So it’s quite good to go and see the suitcase and then buy it online. So we really try to focus on the one experience between shopping online and shopping in the retail environment. We haven’t been too hurt by the retail apocalypse and those things in the US either. I think our brands are still doing well, physically. I think that’s more because of the industry we’re in. Because yes, as you say, the retail has been quite problematic and it’s even tough.\n\nHost: Why don’t we do a lightning round of questions? Favorite brand in the LVMH portfolio outside of Rimowa?\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Favorite brand or favorite product?\n\nHost: Either. Both.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Okay, favorite brand, Dior. Favorite product, Chateau d’Yquem sweet wine.\n\nHost: Good choice. All right. CEO you most admire other than your dad.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: David Solomon.\n\nHost: Haha. I don’t think he’s here. Sorry to disappoint you.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: No, I say, I think one of my dear friends, Evan Spiegel. My age. We have [crosstalk] a lot of the same problematics and spend…\n\nHost: Last one. In 10 years, I hope to have blank. You can fill it in however you want.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: The most successful travel company.\n\nHost: All right, that’s a good one. Well, thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nAlexandre Arnault: Thanks for having me.\n\nHost: Thanks you all for coming.\n\nIf you enjoyed this, and want to learn more about Alexandre, check out my this transcript I made of his talk at the Oxford Union.

In the first episode, he interviewed Doordash cofounder and CEO Tony Xu. For this second episode, he’s interviewed Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz. You can listen to the entire conversation on Sirius XM. But if you prefer reading, I’ve transcribed the conversation below.\n\nKeith Rabois is a general partner at Founders Fund, a San Francisco based venture capital firm with an unparalleled track record as an entrepreneur, investor, and executive, Keith has been instrumental in some of the most ubiquitous social and commerce platforms like Doordash, Lyft, Airbnb and YouTube. Now, he’s here to share conversations with some of today’s most accomplished CEOs and innovators in the technology advancing our future. Welcome to Series A with Keith Rabois on Sirius XM Business Radio.\n\nKeith Rabois: Welcome to series A with Keith Rabois on Sirius XM Business Radio Channel 132, where I interview once a month, the best CEOs all across technology and bring their stories, their company’s stories and their histories to you. Today I’m here with my friend Julia Hartz, CEO of the ticketing platform Eventbrite. Julia, welcome to Sirius XM Radio.\n\nJulia Hartz: Thank you, Keith. I’m excited to be here.\n\nKeith Rabois: Cool, Julia. So you want to tell us what is Eventbrite? And what do people use Eventbrite for?\n\nJulia Hartz: Sure. So Eventbrite is the world’s largest self-service, online, event ticketing platform. And we’re focused on enabling anyone to be a successful event creator by helping them publish, promote, and sell out their events online. And with that, we help them find audience and connect the right people to the right live gatherings. And our entire mission is fueled by human connection and the importance of creating indelible memories in real life through live events.\n\nKeith Rabois: And how many people in a typical year use Eventbrite to host or create an event?\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah, so about a million active event creators use Eventbrite to publish over 5 million events, gathering hundreds of millions of people at those events. The events can be free, paid, online, in person. And I would think about Eventbrite as a cross between Shopify for small merchants, we are to small and medium event creators, and Etsy in terms of homemade, we power unique and local events. So these are the events that typically fill your calendar. It’s the Tuesday night book reading and the Sunday morning yoga workshop. We’re really building the mosaic of the experiences that really color your life, and again, create those unforgettable memories that are with you for a lifetime.\n\nKeith Rabois: And when did you start Eventbrite?\n\nJulia Hartz: We started Eventbrite back in 2006.\n\nKeith Rabois: Wow.\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah, we’re 15 years old.\n\nKeith Rabois: It’s amazing. And what was —\n\nJulia Hartz: Learner’s permit. We can almost drive.\n\nKeith Rabois: What was the original vision behind the company? How did you know it was a good idea and that the world needed this?\n\nJulia Hartz: Well, I think that we came to it from several different angles. So the founding team was Kevin Hartz, who at the time was my fiancee, and is now my husband and partner in crime. And you and Kevin go way back. The second founder was Renaud Visage, an engineer who also was a passionate, and is a passionate photographer. And then myself, I came from television, so I was working at MTV on a show called Jackass. And then at FX Networks on shows like Rescue Me, Nip/Tuck, and The Shield.\n\nSo Kevin’s early career really focused on microtransactional platforms. So he was lucky enough to be a seed investor in what became PayPal. And that really inspired him to think about how moving small amounts of money efficiently and cheaply around the world could open up industries, could democratize industries like international money remittance, which was what he focused on with Xoom, X-O-O-M, our children love to tease him about that now. And so he was working on that when I met him. And we, you know, I had really seen the way in which experiences shape audiences, there was nothing quite like being in real life and experiencing something together, whether it was a screening, or it was a documentary that we were working on about fandoms where we went to all these crazy conventions around the world. And we discovered that there was just this unbelievable energy around these communities gathering.\n\nAnd then Renaud was really interested in how entrepreneurs could turn their passions into profit, and start to teach people their skills, which is something we saw come true on the platform through the first crisis, which was the great recession. So in 2008 2009. So we all came from different angles. And we all started thinking about what would the entry point be to the idea of democratizing the event ticketing industry.\n\nAt the time, there was really nothing that you could use if you wanted to sell tickets online. You could, you know, you could certainly put a PayPal button on your website, you need to have a website. You could, you know, sign up for some really antiquated old software and pay a bunch of money and be locked into a contract. But our core customer doesn’t want to do that, or can’t do that. So the majority of our customers came from offline, which is a beautiful thing, because that’s full enablement of technology, making it easier and faster, and more reliable to do something online.\n\nSo we did not know it would be a great success. Well, I should take that back. Kevin always thinks that things are going to be a great success, which makes him an excellent entrepreneur. He’s missing that chip that says this might not work out in his brain. And so, you know, we just put one foot in front of the other. But I think that the thing is, is like, everything starts small. We were in a windowless phone closet in a warehouse in Potrero Hill, you’d been there many times, Keith. And we had sawhorses and plywood as desks. I sound like an old timer. But it was important because we bootstrapped the company. We truly bootstrapped the company. We spent less than a quarter of a million dollars in the first two years.\n\nKeith Rabois: What led you to change from bootstrapping the company to raise outside capital from VCs or angel investors?\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah, the reason why we bootstraped the company was really more of an academic choice. It was Kevin had, you know, raised a lot of money with Xoom, because they had to, they had to have a certain amount of money on the balance sheet in order to get the regulatory compliance they needed to move money online post 9/11. I mean, the reason why is Xoom was a success, it went on to go public and then get acquired by PayPal, is because that was insane, right after 9/11 to try to do that. And yet it took a ton of capital. So he had to take on a lot of capital really early.\n\nAnd so we decided to do it the other way with Eventbrite. And what that afforded us to do with be very flexible, and also take our time, to some extent. We got to know our customers. First, our core creator was the tech bloggers who were hosting meetups in Silicon Valley. The best early customers to have, because they are very vocal about what they hated about the product. And then we started to see organic adoption happen. So, East Coast speed dating, you know, European tours. We were global from the get go, because we were built on the original PayPal API. And it was just completely taking off in the early years in a way that we had hoped, but you know, didn’t know if it would actually happen.\n\nSo the point at which we raised money was exactly when we knew that the only way for us to get to the next level was to hire a team. And prior to that, we’d just been super scrappy. It was just the three of us. We had some contractors. We funded the company ourselves, but also raised a small Angel round with people like Michael Birch, and I’m pretty sure you were in those very, very early days, Keith, so thank you. We begged, borrowed, and stole. And then, I don’t think we stole, and then we reached that point where we felt felt like, wow, this idea is going to become a business, and then the business is going to become a company.\n\nThat was 2008. A really bad time to decide to go fundraise. So we actually, we pitched 27 firms on Sand Hill Road, and we received 27 Nos. And, you know, ever the optimist, Kevin left our 2009 annual plan with every VC. And they’re sort of like, yeah, okay, the sky is falling, good luck with this whole, you know, ticketing thing. And what happened was, people became their own entrepreneurs. Because they’d lost their jobs, they turned to live experiences, they turned to either gathering to learn a new skill or to teach a new skill or to create a new road for themselves, a new path to prosperity.\n\nAnd 2009 was a banner year for us. Much of our growth is to this day organic, but that was just when the flywheel started to turn faster. So we went back to Sand Hill Road at the end of 2009, to show everybody our results, and it was sort of this huge novel idea that we actually would have made and exceeded this plan that we had left them with. And so that fundraising went a lot faster. And we were able to raise a small round with Sequoia Capital, which was our first choice firm. It was our sort of priority zero.\n\nKeith Rabois: So effectively, the first financial crisis, the first crisis that you sort of encountered as a company became actually a propellant, a wave that you could ride and turn Eventbrite into the modern, you know, sort of visions. You’re able to embrace adversity the first time.\n\nJulia Hartz: Well, yes. And what an interesting, you know, sort of, I don’t know, it’s like this, these two bookends in terms of opportunity born out of crisis, which we’ll get to. But I think, yeah, I think that what it proved to us was that Eventbrite was resilient. It had self-healing properties and it was a company that could survive in the worst of times. You think about that as like an organism. And like, you know, Darwin theory. It’s like, you want to find those things that can that can actually be in the harshest climates, and survive. So that’s fundamental to who we are as a business. And it’s also a thesis that I think Kevin has, and I believe you do, too, in terms of investing.\n\nKeith Rabois: Yeah, no, absolutely. Kevin certainly applies that filter as do I to entrepreneurs. When entrepreneurs pitch Kevin, he’s looking for that resilience, that tenacity, the grit that’s going to survive in any environment and thrive, actually, in environments that other people would be terrified about. Kevin’s also, as you pointed out, extremely optimistic. When did you get persuaded that this was really going to work?\n\nJulia Hartz: I’ve always been a really good counterbalance to Kevin and you know, it is unique to be a husband and wife team, scaling a company, although there’s, at last count, over a million companies in the US that are founded by a husband and wife team. In tech, it’s a little less rare. And even back then it was really rare.\n\nIt’s actually something that we had to expectation manage when we went out and pitched VCs. And you know, the way we were so different, but we have some striking similar similarities. And one of them is we like to go right at the awkward subject. So we would walk into these meetings and just say, you know, we’re married, because at this point, we’ve got married, and we’d had our first kid. Look, we’re married, here’s how we deal, here’s how we operate, here are our rules, we had like three rules. And here’s what we’re gonna do if things go sideways, or someone needs to exit the business. And that seemed to really sort of satiate that doubt or the questions that people had. But it has been an incredibly rewarding journey, because we are two parts of a compliment.\n\nAnd, you know, I think while Kevin is an eternal optimist, and really just like, is fueled by this insane conviction and optimism, I’m more of a realist, and sort of look for things that are broken and fix them. And so, you know, I sort of think about myself as an operator to his entrepreneur, and optimizing is really one of my core strengths. And then also building culture.\n\nAnd that was something that I think, given the fact that we were working together, and we were both active in the business, when we started to scale the business from 30 people to 100 people in a year, which felt, you know, like a team to accompany, I got to really dig in, and be the architect of the culture. And I think that made all the difference in the world. Not necessarily because it was me, but because it was me.\n\nKeith Rabois: Knowing both you quite well, I agree. It was clearly because of you. Can you share what three rules were? Given, you know, as you pointed out, there’s a million people running businesses all across the United States that are basically husband and wife or family members. What are those rules and what principles might they borrow from your sort of history?\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah, so the first one was divide and conquer. Never work on the same thing at the same time. And if you have, if you’re listening, and you have a partner in life, you understand exactly what I’m saying. Because, you know, imagine trying to control the mouse on a Google spreadsheet together. It’s just a disaster. And we’ve broken that rule very few times. And it’s been a disaster. And you know, Michael Birch actually, Michael and Xochi Burch founded several businesses together, one of them Bebo, that was acquired by AOL, you know, like scaled and became this really successful early social media platform. And that was their role. We were in a pub one night and in there like just never work on the same thing at the same time. So we took that to the bank, and we really focused on making sure that we could adhere to that. And the benefit of that is not only conflict, I mean, you don’t really want to avoid conflict, but like conflict management, you’re not setting yourself up to have constant sort of turf wars. But the big benefit is that you can get from point A to point Z 10x faster if you’re in your lane.\n\nThe second rule was pretty funny, which is that if we did run into conflict, we never wanted that to become tension in the office. There is absolutely nothing worse than a couple that is romantically involved having a fight at the office. I mean, I just, I can’t honestly think of a worse social dynamic. And it’s just weird, right? So what we would do is, if we did get into a conflict, we would turn out the lights, this was just one way when it was just the two of us. But we were surrounded by all these other founder teams. So it was pretty funny, like this founder commune. We would turn off the lights in our in our little conference room office and we’d lay on the floor and hold hands. And just the act of doing that, and having to break it up was like enough to get us past any conflict. You know, Kevin and I don’t really harbor a lot. So by the time we were on the floor, we’d be laughing about whatever happened. And, and that really worked well.\n\nAnd then the third thing is probably is pretty simple. But we had to really quickly or like, because we got married, and we had a baby pretty quick, you know, it was like 18 months from starting Eventbrite, getting married, having kids. So we had to, like, maybe this sounds obvious, but we had to make it very clear to one another that our relationship mattered more than the company. That like, that sounds super simple. But times, especially when the scaling was happening, and there were a lot of questions about what the future of the company was going to be like, that came in handy. So in the beginning, it felt like Well, duh. But you really have to, the way that that rule benefited us is that we put so much care and intention into being great founders and operators together, because we both didn’t want to lose the magic of working together. And we certainly didn’t want to lose our relationship over it.\n\nSo, um, so those were the three rules. The exit plan was we never agreed on an exit plan. In one meeting, we’d say I’d leave and the other meeting we’d say he left. And we never ever agreed on it. It was like Oh no, I’ll leave. Oh, no, I” leave. You know, it’s like, that was a little bit…\n\nKeith Rabois: I wonder if you’d A/B tested that and see which one got more termsheets?\n\nJulia Hartz: Exactly. And even back then, that was a different time.\n\nKeith Rabois: Oh, my God. Yeah. Like No, that was incredibly controversial or rare to see. Now there’s many more examples of success. In fact, you know, you’re like the role model for people that want to do this and have aspirations. With the benefits of 15 years of history, any new rules you’d advise people like, or edits Tto those rules?\n\nJulia Hartz: Um, that’s a good question. Well, I think that every founder team is like relationship, right? With the obvious differences. But I would say now, 15 years later, it is as important for you to approach that relationship as you would if you had a lot on the line, like you know, your marriage. Because I think the more that you can invest in that relationship early on, the better and faster you’ll be able to scale the culture of trust. You can’t actually establish trust if the founders aren’t shoulder to shoulder and absolutely, like would, you know, practically die for one another. That’s my opinion. Because I’ve seen it now happen a lot, where you’ll find a really great founder, and then all of a sudden you find out like, they have some sort of cantankerous relationship with their other founder. And that’s a big red flag for me, because I think that you’re spending so much energy on that, that you’re not thinking about how to scale your business or scale your company. And if you’re on shaky ground, there’s no way a culture will be able to thrive, that has any element of trust, or competence in it.\n\nKeith Rabois: Great. Let’s talk about the second big crisis that Eventbrite confronted, which was probably March of 2020. Like almost everybody else in the planet, all of a sudden, the world was turned upside down by COVID. I assume a reasonable fraction of events on Eventbrite, were in the real world. And those started, either very quickly, or very slowly disappearing. So walk me through like your thinking internally in March of 2020. And then what did you do after you realized that the world was changing very quickly?\n\nJulia Hartz: Well, I think that for any company that faces a crucible moment like this, it’s one that you just absolutely will never forget. And and I’ve taken time to write it down just to make sure I don’t forget all the details, but it’s it’s incredibly vivid, like it was just yesterday. It starts in February. So Kevin and I had traveled down to Argentina with our girls to meet the team down there. We have about 150 brilliant engineers in Mendoza, and we went down to introduce the girls to that team and you know, really steep them in that culture. And we were on our way back. And we both noticed that there were a number of people on the plane with masks on. And, you know, things were starting to, to heat up from the media perspective on what was happening in Wuhan. We came back and two things happened. We had our board meeting, and then we had an earnings call. And at the board meeting, we have an unbelievable board, but two people had business in China, and they were just completely panicked. And I will never forget, this is my worst moment. When I said, Let’s not make this whole board meeting about Coronavirus.\n\nKeith Rabois: Hopefully, they forgot. They forgot. They’ve forgotten. Don’t worry.\n\nJulia Hartz: And I just, I’m calling it out. So for anybody listening, who has had a moment like that, you too can survive a moment like that. Um, and so the whole board meeting ended up being about Coronavirus. And, you know, we came out of that with like a todo, a pretty big todo, which was create, codify the disaster plan, if Coronavirus came to the United States, and really started to impact the business. Because at that point, we saw nothing in the business.\n\nThe second thing that happened was the earnings call, and you know, there’s another large ticketing company that is public that has nothing to do with our business. But typically people tend to like look at the two and try to get reference. And they mentioned nothing, or I think they said something like this will not impact our business. And, you know, I just felt like the right thing to do would say, would actually tell the truth, which is if this is truly the 100 year pandemic, this will impact our business. And we really got a lot of trouble for that, like people didn’t like that, our stock was down, we’d already had a really rough first year being public. So I mean, this is not, you know, this was not like my first rodeo of a not great earnings call. So it immediately stoked this sense of uncertainty in the company. And I, you know, I knew what I was doing. It’s not like I thought, oh, nobody will notice. And we started working on the plan, and the ink was barely dry.\n\nAnd I woke up one morning in early March and our CFO texted me and said, It’s here. And I just had chills as I opened my laptop to look at Tableau. And COVID came in like a wrecking ball. But with no naked Miley Cyrus on it. It was not here to play, it was here to kill our business. And it was not messing around. And it was not like a little bit of a blip. It was like a big blip. And for a company that is so well measured and consistent, it was just a complete anomaly.\n\nAnd it was just the beginning of this really crazy downward slope. So we didn’t have any time to wonder if COVID was going to impact our business. It was very clear that it was going to. And what happened was the demand side almost all dried up within two weeks, as news headlines turned from, you know, Bernie versus Biden to Oh, my God, there are these cases in Washington, and you know, everything related to what then was starting to be referred to as COVID-19. And in two weeks, in late March, we went from, you know, roughly $30 million monthly run rate to negative $7 million. We were processing more refunds than revenue.\n\nKeith Rabois: Oh, my God.\n\nJulia Hartz: It’s just, the impact was so severe that it just, I mean, it at least took the guessing out of it. I can put it that way, you know. And I think that the way that it felt to me and to Kevin was that our firstborn was in the ICU. And we were going to do everything in our power to save the company. So I remember coming home on the Friday that we all decided to start working from home, which was like, March 13. And our entire office had been turned into the gnarliest War Room, and I have pictures. Um, Kevin took all of these gaming monitors, these like, I don’t know what is, like a five foot gaming monitor that’s like curved and created almost a 360 War Room with these monitors, and he had all the stats and everything up, whiteboards, the whole thing. And I realized in that moment, he had dropped everything. And like, there was no question that we were going to work together with the team and the board to save the company. And that was like, that was like a warm, fuzzy feeling. And then from there, it was just ice water on my head for like three months.\n\nKeith Rabois: Yeah, so after you set up the War Room, you have all the data, but data is not that useful, because it’s just all bad news. It’s more bad news. You told Kevin, I could have told Kevin to skip the monitors like, it’s bad.\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah. Totally. It set the mood.\n\nKeith Rabois: Yeah. So, after that the realities sort of sunk in pretty quickly that this was potentially catastrophic for your company, let alone you know, individuals. How did you go about like, coming up with a plan, developing a contingency, deciding what to do, actually?\n\nJulia Hartz: Well, so we came up with a plan in the first 24 hours, and it was really, we reached out to everyone. I mean, I can’t believe how many people helped us in those early days. But the feedback we got from all of our mentors, advisors, you know, people we didn’t even know was, you have to raise money.\n\nYou know, there’s that famous story about Southwest and 9/11. And Herb Kelleher was like, in the in the background, he wasn’t running the company, he was like, the chairman. And he wrote on his his famous, you know, yellow line paper, GET CASH. And that’s what we needed to do.\n\nAnd so it became this very quickly this, you know, war strategy of shore up the business. There was a whole host of activities that we did around that, which was, you know, things like we had an advanced payout program that was about to release the next payout to a bunch of people who weren’t going to be hosting those events. We needed to stop that, we needed to educate our customers about what was happening and get them, basically, you’re turning a huge, huge engine in reverse.\n\nSo imagine, like it was the Titanic, you know. It’s like, okay, that’s not very exciting. And it’s scary, and it doesn’t work very well, sometimes. So we’re trying to like, not run it into the glacier. And then the second thing was that we needed, and we needed to restructure the company. Like there was no way we were going to make it through a global pandemic for however long and be able to raise money if we didn’t immediately restructure the company.\n\nAnd the heart there for me… So there’s the head, of like, you know, we can’t continue with this cost basis if we’re not making revenue. The heart was, if we’re going to do this, let’s do this fast. Because who knows what’s around the corner. I wanted to get the people that we were inevitably going to be telling that they didn’t have a job at Eventbrite, I wanted to get them a job somewhere else. So we announced our layoff on April 8, which I think was one of the earliest layoffs, significantly off, not like a 10%. It was 45%.\n\nAnd we announced it on April 8, and there are no words to describe how horrible that feels. But what I am proud of is that we did it with such heart and intention. You know, we had our entire alumni from years and years populating this hub of jobs that were available at the companies that they were now working at. We had over 100 companies in 24 hours. We have an entire TA team, our talent acquisition team, actually flipped their job and become recruiters for the people who are leaving Eventbrite. We would let everybody keep their laptops. It’s like, we just we did it our way. And that’s not something I want to be good at. But I’m so proud of what it really showed people about who we are.\n\nAnd then we needed to raise money. So it was stop the bleeding, restructure the company, which by the way, we needed to restructure it against a strategy that we could execute on. And the way that was I got everybody in a room, a virtual room, and I said to my executive team, I said, With the wisdom that we have now about this business, what would we do if we could do it all over again? And we started just, we had this like respite from the crisis management. We like started to dream, we started to draw, we started to talk about what we do best. What is Eventbrite and what do we do best? And then we came up with what that would be. And then my closing line was, We’re going to do it all over again. This is going to be Day One. Like Eventbrite, is no longer Eventbrite. It does not exist the way it was. So we’re gonna start over. And so, go build your team against that strategy. And that’s what we used as the basis of the restructuring.\n\nAnd then we had to go raise money. And getting out before our earnings call to people who had no idea what was going to be happening at that point. You know, the markets were in an downward spiral, like nobody knew what the benefit was going to be. And we were the company that I mean, you would be insane to finance. And so, that was super interesting.\n\nKeith Rabois: So how’d you find investors that loved in insanity?\n\nJulia Hartz: We found people, good people, through our, mostly our board, who knew who we were and knew what we could do, and understood that we would do the right thing. And it was all personal. Like there was, and that’s how Kevin and I have always operated, which is find the right people. And so we ended up with several options. And we chose the right partner, we chose Francisco Partners, and DJ and his team there. And you know, it was a great deal for them. But it also was really important for us, because what I didn’t want to do, you know, it’s like, we’re cutting off limbs to save the kid. We’re like injecting the kid with like, you know, an infusion. I didn’t want to go ahead and do something that six months later, I would have regretted or would have turned the course of the business.\n\nWe just needed somebody to be in that moment with us and be that financial backstop. So from beginning to end, it was, you know, early March COVID happens, April 8, we announced our layoff, May 11, we do our earnings call and announce the financing, June 12, we turn right around and do a public market convert, which is a major benefit of being a public company. And we start to refinance, we raise a bit more, and we start to refinance that initial tranche. And then in March of this year, we did a public market convert that completely changed the economics of what we’ve raised, and I can’t tell you how beneficial that is to the company now. Because we’re leaner, we’re much leaner on all accounts. And stronger. And faster.\n\nKeith Rabois: So let’s talk about the positive version. So you reinvented the company, you have the clarifying vision. What were the elements of like, what could Eventbrite be if you’re starting all over again?\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah, so Eventbrite, the job that Eventbrite does best for event producers is we give them a self service platform that they can really use as their operating system. And we’re the front door to the event. And we help them do two things really, really well: Save time, which is money, when you’re a sole proprietor, you have a small team. And reach a larger audience. And during COVID, in the background to all of this, our customers, our creators pivoted toward online events, so much so that in 2020, we had 5 million active events, same numbers as 2019. And, you know, online events went from like 5%, to at one point 80% of the events on Eventbrite. And it doesn’t matter if you’re hosting an online event, an in person event, a hybrid event, Eventbrite is that operating system that not only allows you to have a web presence, but also allows you to build audience and to convert that audience into event goers that are going to be part of your community. And what I learned was, we have such an awesome opportunity to be that Trusted Choice for those event creators who are hosting frequent events.\n\nSo our core customer is someone who’s hosting at least one event a month. And that is a business that they’re running. And Eventbrite understands that core customer so well, so much so that we can go out and help them match to the right audiences to extend their community.\n\nBut something happened that I didn’t expect at all, which is that these unique and local events, which is really the hallmark of the Eventbrite supply actually started to build these huge global audiences online. So we had things like Daybreaker, which is this awesome, early morning rave that used to just happen once a month in these, you know, unique locations around New York, Miami and LA. And they immediately pivoted to an online Saturday dance party that was sort of like Yeezy Sunday service. It was like two hours of just like, crazy themed party dance. And, you know, kids are showing up online and Zoom. And it’s this whole thing. They went from, you know, a successful business that was unique and local to a global brand that now has tens of thousands of people every week coming from 115 countries. So this whole new avenue of growth opened up for our customers. And that really gave us the fuel and momentum to understand, Okay, where does our product play a role in making their jobs easier?\n\nKeith Rabois: Do you think that people revert back to real world events at the same scale? Are you going to be back at 80%? Or do you think there’s been a permanent shift in how people interact with each other?\n\nJulia Hartz: It’s already happened for us right now that we will revert. So we’ve seen that happen over the last two months as countries like the US and the UK start to communicate more about reopening. We also saw in Australia, even despite the volatility of being open and then in [inaudible] shut downs that people wanted to get out, they wanted to be together. Absolutely. But also, the frequency increased and [inaudible] it’s so much in Australia that you saw things like beer tasting festivals that would happen maybe once a month, were starting to happen every week and sell out. And so, um, so it’s started to become more of an ingrained habit to get out, you know, there’s just this pent up demand. I think online gathering absolutely is going to continue to soar. Um, I think, you know, I don’t know where we’ll end up sort of, ultimately, where that shift will sort of settle out. But we see a rise in in person events that’s just unprecedented. That we’ve never seen on the platform.\n\nKeith Rabois: What about on the professional side? How do you think people are going to perform their jobs or tasks? You mentioned that you do your war rooms by zoom? What do you think the future of working together looks like?\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah, it was all online, except for Kevin and I, who were perpetually lying on the floor with the lights out. So, it’s interesting. I have two board seats that I hold that were really, really fortuitous during this time. One is Four Seasons Hotels, and the other is UC[inaudible]. And so these data points have come in from these board meetings, you know, that were just like, either confirming or horrifying. And having that kind of knowledge, that well rounded knowledge, has helped a lot. I think that business travel, and this is not an unpopular idea, but I think business travel for the next five years is just totally different. I think people just don’t, as much as they know that they don’t need to commute, they also don’t need to fly somewhere for a meeting. However, I would say that conference-wise, never underestimate the power of FOMO. I think that we’re going to start to see that these conferences are going to come back in a major way, these gatherings, I mean, I know Keith, you’ve been starting to host gatherings in Miami. And, you know, I’m almost certain people are traveling to be there. So I think it’s about the community, I think it’s about how people connect to one another. And I really am skeptical about the ability to successfully execute a great live experience in a hybrid way. So meaning in a synchronous hybrid fashion.\n\nI think our customers will have hybrid businesses, because I’ll tell you, they’re not going to give up that online business that they’ve grown now. And they need to Eventbrite more than ever to continue engaging those audiences. But they’re also going to bring back their in person events. They’re not going to try to do the both of them at the same time for different audiences. I think that we are, I don’t know, at least a decade away from telepresence enabling that in any meaningful way. And so, I think for now, you’re going to see these synchronous experiences. And I think that there’s been on the work front, there’s been a big disruption. I think that people feel a very big, kind of liberating feeling of freedom and choice.\n\nHowever, I wonder what happens when people started to gather in offices and share ideas together and collaborate and how that’s gonna feel if you’re opting out to be virtual versus opting in to be there in person. I just think there’s just a huge growth curve in front of us. I think there’s way more unanswered questions to tackle.\n\nKeith Rabois: Yeah, I agree with that. I think it’s like the professional version of FOMO. So if your colleagues are gathering in the office, and they’re gossiping, and they’re brainstorming, and there’s a lot of spontaneity, and that changes the plan, people who are not able to participate are going to feel like they’re missing out professionally. And they’re going to feel therefore the need to, you know, be in an office with other people. Do you think there’s a solution that’s different than where we started, where companies have a different way of operating to take advantage of, you know, the liberty, the freedom, the diversity of choices of where people want to live, but can have the constructive dialogues in person?\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah, I think it just takes us organizing ourselves in a different way. So I always believe that any system can be broken down and rebuilt better over time as we learn more and more. And I think there are a lot of systems in our corporate world that don’t work and or don’t make any sense. I think having everybody in the office five days a week was just a really easy way, it was a shortcut to having a dynamic environment. And I think we can achieve a dynamic environment, but I believe it has to be highly organized.\n\nNow, I’m a highly organized person. Like if I could put my family members in Container Store bins, I would, and label them. But alas, I can’t. And so it’s probably, you know, the operator and the optimizer in me, I mean, it’s probably it’s probably not a shocker, but I think that, what we’re trying to do at Eventbrite is, we’re delineating paths. So we understand that there’s agency and choice in this new world of working. And we honor that. However, I think it’s important for people to be really intentional about what path they are going to be on.\n\nSo we have this three tiered system or the three paths, not tiers, it’s pathways, you can be a remote. So we’re BriteLinks, go with me on this one, Keith, you’re gonna like vomit into your microphone, we’re BriteLinks, we have FlexLinks. So those are people who are going to be in the office two to three days a week, but they don’t have a dedicated desk, and they do have to reserve their spot because it’s going to be scarce, the space. We have HubLinks, which is someone who is going to be at an office, which we call a hub, three to five days a week and have a dedicated desk. And then we have RemoteLinks, who will not be anywhere near a hub or come into a hub very often, except for you know, special events or, you know, retreats or whatnot.\n\nAnd we’re gonna give everybody a 30 day grace period. And then, and then you need to make a commitment for 12 months. And so there’s, I think that’s okay. Again, here, I’m on the like, first chapter of this, I’m like, I think this is a brilliant idea. But I think I like the design, because I think it gives autonomy and choice. But it also has a commitment level that’s important for you to understand the social contracts and the ways in which we offer perks and the way we optimize the working environment for our team.\n\nAnd I also think that the learning and development and training has to become far more thoughtful and proactive. And so that’s an opportunity for us at Eventbrite that we’re investing heavily in. To really ensure that we don’t lose people who are early on in their career, you know, that they don’t kind of drift between the virtual space, and that we can help them grow and accelerate and have the best work that they’ve ever done happen at Eventbrite.\n\nKeith Rabois: Yeah, I agree that one of the two biggest disadvantages of either a hybrid or remote culture is the ability to learn by osmosis. People typically progress in their craft by learning through peers. And it’s much more difficult when you have to orchestrate that. And you have to be much more intentional and more programmatic. I’m interested to see what kind education you can create, because I don’t think any company has really solved this problem before. And I think a lot of companies will default to therefore trying to hire more experienced people, which is not necessarily the right answer. But if you’re going to sort of hire inexperienced people and groom them, we’re going to do an alternative to osmosis.\n\nJulia Hartz: Right. And I mean, you are, this is my Keith commercial break. Kevin said you were the smartest person, you were one of the smartest people at Stanford. I would say that since I’ve known you, which has been about as long as I’ve known Kevin, you’ve always taught me something either, you know, intrinsically or extrinsically. Like how to run an incredibly elaborate and multi day wedding and have everyone arrive on time and prepared in the right dress. You are my spirit guide when it comes to really managing people and teaching them. And I wonder how you’ll change that. Right?\n\nYou’ve now expanded to a different location, and you’re teaching people remotely and through, you know, podcasts like this. There might be something there for you to develop in terms of what does it look like in this next era, to really teach and inspire? And you know, and I think that’ll be really exciting, because it’ll accelerate some different ways of learning and models of teaching that I think we didn’t really appreciate before that.\n\nKeith Rabois: Yeah, I think that’s a really interesting challenge. And I would like to embrace it, not the wedding planning part. I definitely, definitely do not need – No, I don’t need a new career. I’m already juggling enough jobs. But however, I think the challenge at the core of the root challenge is some of the best learnings come without structure. And as you by intent create programming, the learnings that are best achieved through unstructured environments tend to get crowded out. And so it’s how do you preserve the types of learnings that really thrive in without structure and figure out a way to replicate that. And that’s the intellectual challenge.\n\nJulia Hartz: Yeah, that’s right. That will be very interesting to see how that plays out. And I think we can both agree that some of the greatest lessons we’ve learned has been on the job, so to speak. And what I learned coming out of this last crisis is help is everywhere if you ask for it. And you know that probably should have been something I learned decades ago, but I really saw it in action. And so it changes the way I operate as a person in our tech community, because I know how much it meant to me when somebody just jumped on a Zoom or picked up a phone call. And so I’m much, much more unstructured about how I help people now, because of just the accessibility. It’s like, that could be the difference between someone deciding to quit, or stay in it. And certainly, I know, one of our dear close friends Roelof. He is absolutely, you know, one of the most important people in this Eventbrite story, and you often kind of stays behind the scenes, but he was our first VC and the first, you know, person besides us on the board, and he’s the person I call and I’ve only done this twice, when I didn’t know if we should keep going. And both times it was like a 30 second conversation. And it made all the difference in the world. There’s just that complete little injection of confidence that I needed. So I think that’s, I don’t want to see that be lost in this era.\n\nKeith Rabois: Yeah. Hopefully we can all work together to preserve that. That’s Roelof Botha at Sequoia Capital who used to be a colleague of mine at PayPal back when we were all young.\n\nJulia Hartz: All little young whippersnappers.\n\nKeith Rabois: Yeah, young whippersnappers. Somewhat naive. With that, I’d love to thank Julia Hartz for taking the time to join us on Sirius XM Radio Business Channel 132. Thanks for all of your time, advice, wisdom.\n\nJulia Hartz: Thanks so much Keith. It was great to see you.\n\nKeith Rabois: Pleasure to be with you.\n\nFounders Fund Partner Keith Rabois recently launched a new podcast on Sirius XM – Series A with Keith Rabois. For the first episode, he interviewed Doordash cofounder and CEO Tony Xu. You can listen to the entire conversation on Sirius XM. But if you prefer reading, I’ve transcribed the conversation below.\n\nKeith Rabois is a general partner at Founders Fund, a San Francisco based venture capital firm with an unparalleled track record as an entrepreneur, investor and executive. Keith has been instrumental in some of the most ubiquitous social and commerce platforms like Doordash, Lyft, Airbnb, and YouTube. Now he’s here to share conversations with some of today’s most accomplished CEOs and innovators in the technology advancing our future. Welcome to Series A with Keith Rabois on Sirius XM Business Radio.\n\nKeith Rabois: I’m delighted to record the first episode of Series A with Keith Rabois, where we interview the best entrepreneurs in the planet. And we’re going to start with one of the most phenomenal entrepreneurs I’ve ever worked with, Tony Xu of Doordash, cofounder and CEO of doordash. So Tony started Doordash, I believe in 2013, when he was working on a project while he was in business school at Stanford. Tony, what led you to the idea of starting a delivery service in Palo Alto of all places?\n\nTony Xu: Well, the truth is, we didn’t start with really with the idea of food delivery. We started, my co founders and I, with the idea to help every brick and mortar business. And really, the fascination about these local businesses, for me, came at a very young age when I was five years old. My family immigrated here from China, to Illinois. My dad was getting his graduate degree and my mom, as a way to put food on the table, worked three jobs a day for about 12 years. Now all of those jobs happened to be inside local businesses. One of which was a local Chinese restaurant that I moonlighted at times as a dishwasher. So I think at a very young age, I had a massive appreciation for all of these store owners. And in adulthood, my co founders and I realized that for every amazing technology company, it’s actually these physical businesses that produce the vast majority of jobs and GDP in every city globally. And that’s been true consistently through the decades. And we were looking for ideas in helping this customer segment. And so we really started with a passion for a customer group more so than necessarily a problem that we were trying to solve. And speaking with hundreds of these businessowners, we basically learned that they struggled with everything from customer acquisition to customer service. If you think about it, more and more orders are happening outside of their four walls, they’re happening online. And so something as simple as customer service, which used to happen by just a waitstaff helping take care of it at the table now needs to be solved outside of their restaurants or outside of their stores. And so these businesses struggle with a lot of different things in order to compete effectively in e commerce. We decided to pick one of those things to start. We chose delivery. And when we looked at every category of delivery, we really had two ideas. One was, we wanted to serve every store in the neighborhood. So we might as well start with the largest category of stores, which was restaurants. And second, we thought if our idea is to build a logistics network that could serve all of them, while something like order density is going to really matter. And so we made a bet that restaurants would give the highest frequency of activity. And that turned out to be true. It took us a few years to figure that out and kind of collect that data. But those are the reasons why we launched with delivery, but it really started with the passion for these local business owners.\n\nKeith Rabois: So why do you think Doordash has been so successful? There’s other people providing food delivery back then directly and indirectly. There’s other people providing today. But my understanding is over 20 million Americans use Doordash. Why have so many Americans voted with their feet to choose Doordash?\n\nTony Xu: Well, I think it starts with offering the best combination of the selection of restaurants, we bring the quality of the delivery experience of the timeliness, the speed, the accuracy, and the affordability of the service. And I think getting all of those things, right, is what’s important. And it’s really hard to get all of those things right. I think sometimes it’s really easy to focus on one of those things. But candidly, for customers, if we offer all of the restaurants, but they’re too expensive, or if we offered all of the restaurants and we never show up on time, none of those things are good enough to fit this equation that customers demand when it comes to convenience. And so I think by figuring that out, and offering a better combination, that’s why we were able to build a better product. And I think you can see that with our industry leading retention and why more people vote with their wallets and spend more of their stomachs with us than with anyone else.\n\nKeith Rabois: And you had to confront some pretty substantial, large, well established companies along the way. Any lessons in competing with very large incumbents that other entrepreneurs can take with them?\n\nTony Xu: Yeah, we certainly, I think historically, have never been the most resourced company. For the first five and a half, almost six years of our eight year history, we were operating on a fraction of the budgets of some of our peers. In fact, up until 2018, so about three years ago, we didn’t even have a marketing team. Because we couldn’t afford one, I think a few lessons. I think one is, you have to start by building a better product and trying to differentiate through that basis versus any other basis. And building a better product starts with an intense obsession over that customer experience, more so than it does what others are doing. The second thing I would say is you have to compete on your own vector or your own basis where you don’t want to play someone else’s game, especially if you can’t do it better. So it would be probably a foolish decision if you wanted to compete spending capital if you don’t have the greatest war chest, for example. And one of the things we did was we also looked at geographies that were less penetrated or maybe overlooked by others. And this really goes back to I think, the question you asked at the onset of our conversation, where we started in a place where there was no delivery. And I think this was one of the misunderstandings in the industry where I"
