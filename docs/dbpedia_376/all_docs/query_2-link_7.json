        "text": "Precisely to the point re. the question: \"Why do many transformations not succeed?\" As long as we consider employees as followers, they will not truly take ownership for the organization but do what they are being told to do. In todays global economic system most companies are driven by company-external shareholder and are most employees are not at all invested in the company. Why take real ownership for the organization then? Just look at how the same people behave at home or in their spare time, taking ownership of course. #changemanagement #transformation #ownership"
