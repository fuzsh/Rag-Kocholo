        "text": "When journalist Jaime Lowe (Mental, Digging for Dirt) opened the Los Angeles Times in February 2016, she read a story that shook her. Sandwiched between the other horrors of the day was an article about a woman, Shawna Jones, who died while fighting a wildfire outside L.A. She had been part of a crew of incarcerated women who were on the frontlines of firefighting in the state of California. Lowe, a reporter who frequently contributes to The New York Times Magazine, among other publications, felt compelled to dig further into Shawna’s story.\n\nWhat she found is now a new book called Breathing Fire: Female Inmate Firefighters on the Front Lines of California’s Wildfires. The book details Lowe’s experiences at what are called conservation camps, where the incarcerated firefighters live and from which they protect the wealthy and fire-prone state of California for less than $1 an hour. It also provides important context about the state’s prejudiced foundations, incarcerated labor, and the individual lives of the people Lowe interacted with in the camps.\n\nLowe spoke to Shondaland over the phone about journalism and gaining access to the camps, the myth of California as a progressive beacon, health care for firefighters in the crises of climate change and Covid-19, and the language around rehabilitation for incarcerated people.\n\nSARAH NEILSON: How did reading the story of Shawna Jones’ death lead to developing the long-form journalism project of this book? What was that process like, and what drove your curiosity and desire to dive into that reporting?\n\nJAIME LOWE: I grew up reading the L.A. Times every day, and I knew reporters who were friends of the family. I really admired the L.A. Times. It was accessible. I read this story and was really struck that this [inmate firefighting] program existed and that I knew the trails that these women had cleared — I knew where the camp was. I grew up knowing that area. I didn’t grow up near there; Malibu is a far cry from where I grew up. But I couldn’t believe I didn’t have any inkling into the existence of the fire camp. I was shocked and a little ashamed — I should know more about California history, but it’s not something that was ever really talked about. And the other part that struck me was that there was so little that was written about Shawna as a person. Her actual character, who she was — she just was sort of identified by her crime. I understand the news cycle, and so I don’t want to say it was just a huge oversight, but then there was never any follow-up. This woman died a prisoner fighting a fire, and there wasn’t any more information about who she was.\n\nThe first test for me about whether or not I want to pursue a story is “Am I curious about it? Do I need to know more?” And I felt like I did. So, I then looked a lot more into the program, and I wrote a pitch to my editor at the [New York Times] magazine. They basically said, “If you can get into the camp, and you can get her family to agree to be interviewed, we’ll give you the assignment.” Those are not small things. I reached out to Diana, Shawna’s mom, in as many ways as I could. She seemed like she was open to an interview. We talked on the phone. She seemed nervous about it, but she also seemed like she really wanted Shawna’s story to be told too. The second half of the buy-in came from CDCR [California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]. I thought they would be very reluctant to let me go to the camp, but they were super-transparent. They let me go to all three female camps and to the training. It was a hard story to write because I wanted to write about Shawna, but I also wanted to include the presence and history of the camps. It’s hard to do in a short space, which is why the book ended up coming after the article. I felt like there was more to be said and more of other women’s stories to be told.\n\nRelying on prison labor to do some of the hardest work to save this incredibly rich state, it is unconscionable. It’s time to evolve; it’s time to change.\n\nSN: It blows my mind that you got that access from CDCR. It sounds like it wasn’t that hard.\n\nJL: You know, I agree. I was surprised. I was also very persistent. I think that they will generally let journalists in, but they will have a lot of bureaucratic hurdles to make it hard. So you have to request access a dozen times rather than once. You have to just keep calling and keep double-checking and keep confirming. When they’re describing rehabilitation in the name of their program, in the name of incarceration, I think they really see the conservation camps as a really good example of rehabilitation. I’m not sure I 100-percent agree with that, but I do feel, having interviewed a lot of people who went through them, a lot of people do point to them as something that was life-changing in a positive way.\n\nSN: There’s a lot of positive or positivity-coded language around the fire camps from both the institutional side and the people who are incarcerated who work there. What are your thoughts around the ways that the people you interviewed talked about the conservation camps, as they’re called?\n\nJL: I went into reporting this story with a gut reaction that was like, “This is slave labor. This is crazy that they get paid so little, and they’re doing such hard work and sometimes fatal work.” Most if not almost all the women I talked to can point to really good aspects of the camp. My feeling walking away from it was that it’s a program that could absolutely be phenomenal rehabilitation. It could be a phenomenal already structured program similar to California Conservation Corps. But you have to overcome these really basic hurdles, which is that these women and men need to be paid the same as civilian crews, and they can’t be prisoners. You can’t be expected to save a state in peril and then go back to a state prison and be watched over by correctional officers, have the potential to have added length to your stay because you haven’t woken up in time or you didn’t have a clean-enough cubby or tight-enough corners on your bed. CDCR should not be involved in this program is my takeaway.\n\nSN: You write that since the 1940s, in any given year, up to 30 percent of all wildland firefighters in California are incarcerated. You also write about how so much of California’s infrastructure was built by inmate labor. Did any of your historical research surprise you, and did it influence or change your relationship to your home state?\n\nJL: It absolutely surprised me. There are academics and scholars who have done far better research than I did, and I really relied on them. Kelly Lytle Hernandez is one that I can think of off the top of my head. California gets this kind of progressive sheen. I think it’s thought of as this land of plenty, and it obviously is not. There obviously has always been segregation, racism, and poverty embedded in L.A. I think that I didn’t realize just how deep it was in California in general. There were monuments to Confederates in the Hollywood Cemetery, which is just a few blocks from my dad’s house. I was shocked they had those monuments there up until just a few years ago. There were several L.A. mayors who were deeply entrenched in the KKK. It’s not any different than America. I have in the past romanticized the state as this idealistic, liberal bastion, and I think that it has a lot of reckoning to do. I don’t think that we’re anywhere near what needs to happen in terms of acknowledging some of the state’s brutal history.\n\nSN: Can you talk about what you learned around the logistics of fires, firefighting, and climate change while you researched the book, and the process of deciding how much of that to include?\n\nJL: I always wanted the book to be centered on the women and their experience. I wanted to know what they knew about fighting fires, how they learned about fighting fires, what they were told about the different kinds of fires they were seeing, what they had experienced. I was lucky because one of the women [Marquet Jones] that I profiled, who I initially had met at [the Malibu camp], she ended up being released, and she is a full-on federal wildland firefighter in her fourth season now. That allowed me to learn about fire through her experience too. Also, Marquet was going to get her associate’s degree in fire, so I could go to class with her and learn about fire that way. I of course interviewed a ton of people who specialize in fire. But for the most part, I really only wanted to include what their whole experience was, how they had to take on this crisis, how they felt, and what it was like to be immersed in that. So that was how I decided what to cover. I always saw this as a people-first book; I wanted their experience specifically to dominate whatever narrative was told.\n\n\"In terms of recognizing the realities of California and climate change, we need to come up with a better way of creating a workforce that is equitable and fair.\"\n\nSN: Can you talk about the part of the book that touches on the horrors of the CDCR health-care system?\n\nJL: I don’t believe that mental and physical health are two separate things. But I do think that the firefighting community at large has a very complicated relationship to getting proper physical-health treatment and proper mental-health treatment. Especially as fires are getting more intense and their hours are more demanding, the air quality is really horrible. ... It was relevant to me that there was this huge bureaucracy that had failed so many times — according to the Supreme Court, their health care was cruel and unusual punishment — in charge of people who were fighting fires, who require really good health care. It seemed really relevant to me to show how poorly managed ... “poorly managed” is a euphemistic way of describing CDCR’s health care. It is abysmal, dysfunctional, and horrifying. And I think that because the time period that I covered included the pandemic, that was relevant too. So many of the women who were released ended up with minimum-wage jobs, or a lot less, who had spent these years protecting the state, and there was no health care. There was not even a thought like, “How do we take care of these people who have put in so much time and work into protecting California?”\n\nSN: What is your hope for this book in terms of who it will reach and what people can learn and take away from it?\n\nJL: My hope is always that a ton of people read it, engage with it, and want the system to change. Usually when we hear about appalling prison systems, it’s like Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi — CDCR is one of the worst. And it’s huge; it’s a monster. I think that it’s just an example of the larger problem, which is that mass incarceration is an absolute failure, and that as a society we have to address the fact that it doesn’t work, it’s expensive, and it is hurting people. It’s an absolute trauma. It hurts the people in prison; it hurts the families related to the people in prison. And there is a better way. That’s not to say that I have the exact answers, but we know that this isn’t working, and we know that this is terrifying. In terms of recognizing the realities of California and climate change, we need to come up with a better way of creating a workforce that is equitable and fair. Relying on prison labor to do some of the hardest work to save this incredibly rich state, it is unconscionable. It’s time to evolve; it’s time to change. It’s time to recognize individuals and look at situations that they’re in. ... Incarceration is not justice.\n\nSarah Neilson is a freelance writer. They can be found on Twitter @sarahmariewrote."
