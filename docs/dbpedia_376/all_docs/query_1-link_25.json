        "text": "1. Background\n\nUnraveling the mechanisms that govern the abundance and distribution of predators and prey is fundamental to understanding the functioning of marine ecosystems. The dynamic nature of the ocean, and the physical–biological coupling that results, is thought to influence the occurrence of marine species [1]. Such biophysical interactions give rise to heterogeneously distributed resources, or patchiness across multiple and often hierarchical scales [2–4]. Patchiness influences the ability for primary producers (e.g. phytoplankton) to flourish, which in turn affects prey availability at higher trophic levels, from secondary consumers to top predators [5]. To build a mechanistic understanding of patchiness and how animals interact with their environment, interdisciplinary approaches should integrate information on physical processes and community structure at relevant spatiotemporal scales [1,6].\n\nPatchily distributed prey impacts predator foraging efficiency by increasing the time and energy required to locate and consume prey [7]. Higher patch densities result in a greater number of available prey items within a given area, increasing the opportunities for predators to feed and meet their energetic demands. For example, locally dense areas of fish prey within a prey patch can be more strongly correlated with predator (i.e. seabird and pinniped) foraging behaviour than total available biomass of the patch [8]. This finding probably extends to krill predators in seasonally productive upwelling ecosystems like the California Current System (CCS), especially bulk filter feeding whales that rely on dense patches to increase foraging efficiency [9]. While blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) primarily rely on krill as their main food source, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the CCS can switch between feeding on krill and schools of fish [10–13]. For blue whales, finding high density prey patches is particularly important to optimize foraging efficiency and fitness, given the constraints of their large body size [14]. Krill density may also influence the feeding preferences of generalist predators like humpback whales, potentially triggering a switch to fish as a food source at lower krill densities [12,13].\n\nThe CCS is characterized by the wind-driven upwelling of cold, dense, nutrient-rich waters from below the mixed-layer to the euphotic zone [15] providing the foundation of the CCS food web by promoting the growth of phytoplankton and subsequently krill (order Euphausiacea) [16,17]. Coastal upwelling in the CCS varies seasonally, with peak upwelling occurring during the spring and summer months as a result of predominantly alongshore, equatorward winds [18,19]. Within the upwelling season, pulsed wind events lead to smaller-scale upwelling–relaxation cycles that contribute to the overall variability of circulation in the CCS [20,21]. Circulation patterns interact with the irregular coastline as well as underwater topographic features to create a complex, dynamic environment at fine to broad scales [22].\n\nKrill plays a pivotal role in connecting physical processes, primary production and higher trophic-level species as a key component of the CCS food web [23,24]. While krill distributions are not completely dictated by currents, having swimming speeds of approximately 5–10 cm s−1, they are influenced by physical forcing through the movements of water masses [25,26] and aggregative processes [21]. Additionally, krill aggregates into ephemeral swarms as a means of predator avoidance that are exploited by gulping predators like baleen whales [9,17,21]. The use of hydroacoustics surveys allows for fine-scale measurement of the horizontal and vertical distribution of krill over broad spatial areas [27,28]. Multi-year studies of krill in the CCS have used hydroacoustics to model persistent krill hotspots, which tend to occur downstream of upwelling centers [29,30] and along continental shelf-breaks or submarine canyon systems [29,31]. However, given environmental variability (seasonal and annual), and the time lag between primary production and secondary consumer (e.g. krill) growth, there is variability in the phenology and patchiness of krill in the CCS [24,32]. A regional study in the Central CCS found that most krill aggregations are short-lived (e.g. 2–10 days, 18 to 800 km2) and that large, persistent krill aggregations (greater than 20 days, 800–1000 km2) are rare [32]. These daily and sub-daily cycles of patch density have been linked to environmental fluctuations, including aggregative surface current features, and can be associated in space and time with aggregations of krill predators [21,33]. The short lifespan and fine-scale heterogeneity of these important prey patches underscore the importance of submesoscale (less than 100 km) biophysical relationships as mechanistic drivers of marine hotspot formation [34].\n\nThere is growing evidence that submesoscale physical processes play a critical role in the structuring of pelagic ecosystems, especially in the context of predator–prey interactions [35–37]. Recent research has delved into the relationships between pelagic predator habitat selection and surface current features (e.g. fronts and eddies), for pinnipeds [38], sharks [39,40], turtles [41], seabirds [37,42] and cetaceans [43–45]. These surface current features reflect processes that affect productivity through the transport of nutrient-rich water [46] and aggregation of organisms operating at low (10−2) and intermediate (102–103) Reynolds numbers through physical forcing [37]. The movement of water masses such as upwelling jets, eddies, and fronts, can affect the transport of phytoplankton and can contribute to the formation of krill hotspots [47–49]. However, a more complete understanding of these mechanisms is limited by our ability to contemporaneously measure ocean features and the distribution of krill patches at comparable scales [17,50].\n\nHere we integrate physical and biological measurements from in-situ ship-based surveys with remotely sensed habitat features to investigate the drivers of krill density and distribution in the CCS. We use hourly high-frequency (HF) radar surface current measurements to calculate a time-dependent Lagrangian modelled proxy that reflects coherent aggregative ocean transport features at submesoscales [51,52]. Blue whales in the CCS have been shown to increase feeding rates at aggregative surface current features [45], suggesting that these features may correspond to increased krill density, but the mechanism by which these features would influence krill distributions has not been explained. We hypothesize that the surface current features identified as important to krill predators will have (1) both a surface and subsurface oceanographic expression, and (2) either increased krill abundance or density. Identifying these features in the ocean both climatologically and contemporaneously will help inform how best to monitor, predict and conserve predator hotspots in the future.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur findings provide valuable insights into the intricate relationship among oceanographic processes and trophic interactions, including quantifying the role of ocean features on prey distribution and predator occurrence. This study integrated environmental remote-sensing, fisheries acoustics, and visual sightings to describe patterns of predator and prey distribution at scales that are often difficult to measure. The Lagrangian analytical techniques used here may identify transport features that are not apparent using Eulerian analysis methods [75,76] and are particularly useful for studying phenomena such as eddies, fronts and jets, where fluid particles experience complex, time-dependent advection patterns. Our research found that submesoscale processes, which lie between the fine and mesoscales explored in previous studies [17,21,77,78], serve an important aggregative function to the predator-prey scape. These investigations on submesoscale features address a knowledge gap within a continuum of hierarchically nested processes that influence resource distribution, predator–prey interactions, and ultimately the structuring of marine ecosystems.\n\nThis study investigated the impact of 4 different integration durations of the FTLE as a proxy for the scale and magnitude of underlying oceanographic processes. By comparing the relationships among multiple interconnected factors and FTLE values obtained for various integration durations, we determined the optimal integration duration that effectively captures trophodynamic features in this region. Our results indicate that the time-scale of processes impacting the near-surface (0–10 m) seawater density, krill density, and cetacean sighting probability is primarily between 2 and 10 days. These results align with the scale of upwelling/relaxation events (1–2 weeks) in the region [21,79,80], as well as the persistence of the majority of krill aggregations (2–10 days) from a regional study in the CCE [32]. Due to the overlap in the calculation of FTLE between the nested integration durations, we may expect some similarity in the resulting relationships, especially among integration durations with higher degrees of overlap (e.g. 24–48, 48–120 and 120–240 h). The patterns we observed however, varied within and between the variables in our analysis, further suggesting that these integration windows are an important tool for teasing apart the scale of processes influencing the ecology of this region. While FTLE is derived from HF Radar data that measures the movements of surface waters to depths of 0.5 to 1.5 m [81,82], our study shows that the depth of influence of aggregative surface current features extends beyond the skin of the ocean to depths of at least 10 m. This finding underscores the utility of Lagrangian metrics in identifying ecological links between surface dynamics and biologically important responses.\n\nAlthough upwelling was not directly measured in this study, the observed shoaling of isopycnals likely indicates the presence of vertical transport corresponding to recently upwelled waters [65,83]. Previous research on krill predator movements in relation to upwelling dynamics found a similar relationship with seawater density in the presence of an upwelling plume in Monterey Bay [84] and a recent study conducted in the same region found agreement between sea-surface temperature fronts and LCS during summer months [65]. Zooplankton in the CCS has been shown to be distributed on the denser side of fronts [48]. Our results similarly showed that areas of elevated FTLE corresponded to increased seawater density and higher krill density ( and ).\n\nThe distribution of prey is driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. While many species of krill are found in the CCS, there are two numerically dominant species, Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera [29,85]. E. pacifica is more abundant particularly offshore (greater than 200 m) but smaller in size than the coastal T. spinifera [86]. As a result of the nocturnal period of their diel vertical migration, E. pacifica and T. spinifera spend roughly 30–50% of their life at or near the surface [87,88] and are subject to horizontal transport driven by surface currents. The distribution of these species, even those found at depth during the day, would thus in part be directly influenced by surface transport pathways (e.g. LCS) that serve to aggregate parcels of water and the organisms within them [89]. Additionally, we would expect krill to be well adapted to take advantage of the aggregative dynamics of a coastal upwelling system to co-locate with their passive, drifting phytoplankton prey [5]. While our study did not distinguish between krill species, the habitat preference, life history and behaviour of each krill species may impact the influence of ocean dynamics and physical forcing, which in turn may influence the scales of patchiness for each species [90]. Further analyses on the species-specific drivers of aggregation may allow a finer-scale understanding of the submesoscale activity of these two important prey species.\n\nAt fine scales, krill patches can be homogeneous in terms of size and age-class [91], and adjacent swarms are often made up of cohorts of different—though also homogeneous—size and age-classes [92]. These observations may be reflective of the concept of fluid dynamical niches [93] shown in phytoplankton, in which organismal cohorts remain together over time in parcels of water. These cohorts are formed, for example, by ontogenetic differences in both behaviour and swimming ability, while swarms are believed to be maintained by social interaction [5]. Similar to our findings here, Benoit-Bird et al. [21] showed a correlation between increased upwelling activity (i.e. alongshore winds) and increased density within patches of both forage fish and krill, but did not find a relationship to the overall abundance. Additionally, recent work on larval dispersion and aggregative surface current features showed that not all features contained larvae [94]. This aligns with our findings here that not all FTLE features have krill. There is a time lag between primary production following upwelling events and secondary consumer (krill) growth [24], and advective processes lead to krill patches that can be spatially and temporally disassociated from their origin. We did not track the entire trajectory of FTLE features in our study, though future work should investigate the origins of water masses that contain krill or krill prey (e.g. phytoplankton/zooplankton) to determine the conditions that lead to the presence of krill within aggregative features [77,95].\n\nOverall, higher density krill patches represent a more valuable resource for bulk filter-feeding krill predators such as blue and humpback whales. Blue whales have been hypothesized to target the most dense prey patches and most dense regions within a prey patch to optimize their foraging efficiency [33,59]. The link between aggregative surface current features and blue whale feeding performance has been established using a 48 h FTLE integration window [45], which aligns with our results, though we found the strongest relationship at longer integration durations. In contrast, resource partitioning or the ability for humpback whales to prey-switch from krill to fish could help explain the differences observed between the two species in our study. While blue whales are krill obligate foragers, humpback whales are generalists with a mixed diet that depends on relative abundances of fish and krill [96]. Previous research in the region found that blue whales co-located with krill hotspots while the co-occurrence of humpbacks varied [55]. In our study, the relationship between humpback whale sightings and shorter integration windows (24 and 48 h) may correspond to their ability to prey-switch and to target schooling fish, which are a major prey item of humpback whales, with patches more ephemeral than those of krill.\n\nOur data span multiple seasons, years and oceanographic regimes (e.g. Pacific Decadal Oscillation) indicating that FTLE may be a robust metric for identifying dynamic, ephemeral habitat features in the California Current System. The survey effort here occurred between the months of May and September, which coincides with the phenology of krill–predator presence in the region and represents a critical time-period for exploring predator–prey relationships. However, the timing does not fully represent the full range of conditions in the region. For example, the relationships observed here may not hold during strong wind events typically observed during the winter and spring months [30,65,97]. Additionally, while all integration windows aimed to minimize the influence of tides by spanning multiple tidal cycles, the outlet of the San Francisco Bay likely plays a role in the movement of water parcels in our study region. While not investigated here, these effects vary seasonally and are likely to be most pronounced near the bay entrance, and may have a stronger influence on shorter integration durations in our study [98]. Further research in other upwelling regions across a broader range of spatial and temporal scales could help assess whether these results are applicable to other regions of the CCS.\n\nThe Central CA region of the CCS that is the focus of this study is an important management area that includes Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) and the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS), as well as a Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) for shipping activities transiting into and out of San Francisco Bay. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of prey species is crucial for implementing effective management strategies for marine predators, such as the establishment of marine protected areas [99,100] or the implementation of vessel traffic controls to reduce whale ship strikes [101]. Furthermore, understanding the relationship between coastal upwelling and krill aggregations enables us to portend the potential impacts of environmental change on these critical ecosystems [102]. Changes in upwelling patterns due to atmospheric shifts could disrupt the availability of forage species (e.g. krill), potentially shifting the distribution of their predators to areas of higher human risk. Anthropogenic impacts on our oceans are increasing [103], with entanglements [104] and ship strikes [55] becoming significant sources of mortality for humpback and blue whales in the California Current. Therefore, uncovering the complex interactions between the physical environment, krill dynamics and whale ecology can aid in their effective management and conservation."
