Since this is an important determinant for quality of life, we assessed this in a large international adult CHD cohort.\n\nMethods\n\nData from 4028 adults with CHD (53% women) from 15 different countries were collected by a uniform survey in the cross‐sectional APPROACH International Study. Predictors for employment and work limitations were studied using general linear mixed models.\n\nResults\n\nMedian age was 32 years (IQR 25‐42) and 94% of patients had at least a high school degree. Overall employment rate was 69%, but varied substantially among countries. Higher education (OR 1.99‐3.69) and having a partner (OR 1.72) were associated with more employment; female sex (OR 0.66, worse NYHA functional class (OR 0.67‐0.13), and a history of congestive heart failure (OR 0.74) were associated with less employment. Limitations at work were reported in 34% and were associated with female sex (OR 1.36), increasing age (OR 1.03 per year), more severe CHD (OR 1.31‐2.10), and a history of congestive heart failure (OR 1.57) or mental disorders (OR 2.26). Only a university degree was associated with fewer limitations at work (OR 0.62).\n\nConclusions\n\nThere are genuine differences in the impact of CHD on employment status in different countries. Although the majority of adult CHD patients are employed, limitations at work are common. Education appears to be the main predictor for successful employment and should therefore be encouraged in patients with CHD.\n\nKeywords: adult, congenital heart defects, disability, education, employment, work ability\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nWith survival rates to adulthood over 90%, most children with congenital heart disease (CHD) go to school and subsequently obtain employment.1, 2 Employment and work ability contribute to well‐being and are nowadays crucial in daily life for most adults with CHD.3 Employment has been reported as one of the most important aspects of quality of life (QOL) and, inversely, lack of employment with lower QOL.4, 5 Aspects influencing work such as concentration and fatigue, are important patient‐reported outcomes that receive increasing attention. However, in contrast to previous guidelines,6 education and employment are no longer mentioned in the latest European guidelines for the management of grown‐up CHD.7\n\nHigher rates of unemployment, disease‐related work absences, and limitations at work have been reported in adults with CHD compared to the general population in The Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 In contrast, studies from Finland, Sweden, and Malta, have reported employment rates similar or even above those of the general population.14, 15, 16 Research in other chronic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease) has consistently shown that employment and work ability are negatively influenced by these conditions. Patients with other chronic diseases are less often employed, work fewer hours when they work and report limitations at work.17 These findings were associated with older age, female sex, perceived health complaints, and limitations in daily physical activities caused by the disease.18 It remains unknown whether these contributing factors for work disability are applicable to adults with CHD.\n\nThe conflicting findings on employment and limitations at work and contributing factors in adults with CHD, suggest that they might be influenced by other factors than solely the CHD itself. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore employment, work ability, and the presence of limitations at work in a large international adult CHD cohort in a uniform way, to investigate differences between countries and to identify predictors for employment and work limitations.\n\n2. METHODS\n\n2.1. Study design and setting\n\nData were collected from April 2013 to March 2015 in the “Assessment of Patterns of Patient‐Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart disease—International Study” (APPROACH‐IS). APPROACH‐IS is an international cross‐sectional multicenter study conducted in partnership with the International Society for Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ISACHD). The rationale and methodology of this study have been previously described.19 In summary, inclusion criteria were age 18 years or above, known CHD with continuing follow‐up and the ability to complete self‐report questionnaires. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the coordinating center (University Hospitals Leuven/KU Leuven, Belgium) and local institutional review boards when required. All participating patients provided written informed consent. Data from 5 different continents were collected in 15 participating countries: Belgium, France, Italy, Malta, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and The Netherlands (Europe); Canada and the United States (North America); India, Japan, and Taiwan (Asia); Argentina (South America); and Australia.\n\n2.2. Variables and measurements\n\nA uniform survey developed by the research team consisting of questions on demographic, medical and QOL items was sent to either a random or consecutively approached selection of patients at each participating center. The first question of the Work Ability Index, inquiring about current work ability compared to lifetime best, was used to assess work ability. This question is considered a valid and reliable predictor of work disability and is frequently used to measure work ability.20, 21 Patients were asked to rate their current work ability on a scale from 0 (not being able to work at all) to 10 (equivalent of lifetime best work ability). A Work Ability Score (WAS) of 8 or higher was considered good to excellent, a score of 6 or 7 was considered moderate, and any score of 5 or below was considered poor. Limitations at work were collected through several questions on experiencing limitations at work attributed to the CHD, eg, having symptoms at work, having to slow down due to the symptoms, or having to work part‐time because of the disease. Country‐specific data on employment and unemployment were drawn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) and used as reference data.22, 23\n\n2.3. Definitions\n\nCHD was diagnosed according to the European Paediatric Cardiac Code Short List coding scheme.24 To categorize complexity of CHD, a prespecified hierarchical scheme was used, classifying type of CHD as either mild, moderate, or severe.25 Employment status was classified by the patient as either full‐ or part‐time, unemployed (including job seeking), disabled/government financial assistance, homemaker, student, retired, or other. From all patients that had chosen “other,” additional free text was individually verified. For all analyses regarding work ability, only patients with working experiences were analyzed. Therefore, since most of the participating countries have a retirement age of 65 years and older, patients were censored from that age and homemakers, early retired participants, and students were all excluded from work ability analyses. Unemployed or disabled patients who considered themselves entirely unable to work were also excluded from all analyses on working experiences. Limitations at work were considered when “yes” was answered on one or more questions regarding work limitations. Only employed patients were included for the analyses on work limitations.\n\n2.4. Statistical methods\n\nCategorical data were presented as numbers and percentages and continuous data as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) since they were not normally distributed. Clinical characteristics were compared using chi‐square statistics for dichotomous and categorical variables and Mann‐Whitney U tests for continuous variables. The differences in parameters for employment and work limitations were first tested by univariate analyses. The association of patient‐specific characteristics of employment and work limitations was estimated with the use of general linear mixed models. By this multilevel structure, patients were nested within countries, to account for as much influence from cultural differences as possible. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression. The level of statistical significance was set at P ≤ .05 and all reported P values were two‐tailed. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software for Windows (version 23; IBM, Armonk, New York).\n\n3. RESULTS\n\nA total of 4028 adults with CHD were enrolled in APPROACH‐IS. Characteristics of the study population are described in Table . Median age was 32 years (IQR 25‐42). Slightly more women than men (53% vs 47%, P = .002) were included and CHD distribution was more severe in men. The majority of patients originated from Europe or North America, had at least a high school degree, were married or living with a partner, had no children and had NYHA functional class I symptoms. Fifty‐one percent of all patients had a college or university degree.\n\nTable 1\n\nVariableRespondentsAPPROACH‐IS (N = 4028) P valueMen (N = 1897 (47))Women (N = 2115 (53))Total (N = 4012a)Age, y (IQR)401331 (24‐43)32 (25‐41)32 (25‐42) .649Origin, N (%)b 4028Europe869 (46)866 (41)1 735 (43) .003North America560 (29)700 (33)1 260 (32) .016Asia330 (17)377 (18)707 (18) .761South America68 (4)110 (5)178 (4) .018Australia70 (4)62 (3)132 (3) .177Marital status4008Never married911 (48)839 (40)1750 (44)<.001Married/living with partner901 (48)1134 (54)2035 (51)<.001Divorced/widowed73 (4)129 (6)202 (5) .001Having children4004696 (37)881 (42)1577 (40) .002Educational level3989Less than high school109 (6)114 (5)223 (6) .623High school834 (44)873 (42)1707 (43) .086College degree390 (21)455 (22)845 (21) .459University degree542 (29)657 (31)1199 (30) .085CHD severity4028Mild420 (22)618 (29)1038 (26)<.001Moderate924 (49)1021 (48)1945 (49) .783Severe553 (29)476 (23)1029 (25)<.001NYHA I and II39271665 (90)1778 (88)3443 (89)<.001NYHA III and IV186 (10)251 (12)437 (11) .037ComorbidityCongestive heart failure3959193 (10)240 (12)435 (11) .471Cognitive impairment399829 (2)19 (1)48 (1) .066History of mental disorder4012149 (8)265 (13)418 (10)<.001Employment status3993Employed1381 (74)1364 (65)2745 (69)<.001Full‐time1151 (83)893 (65)2044 (74)<.001Part‐time230 (17)471 (35)701 (26)<.001Homemaker or retired79 (4)255 (12)334 (8)<.001Unemployedc 192 (10)201 (10)393 (10) .511Disabled127 (7)173 (8)300 (8) .074Student or other101 (5)105 (5)206 (5) .606Good WAS (≥8)d 32271248 (78)1247 (77)2495 (77) .596Poor WAS (≤5)135 (8)148 (9)283 (9) .467Any work limitationse 2745441 (32)499 (37)940 (34) .010\n\nData on employment status were missing from 35 (<1%) participants. In addition, 135 (3%) patients 65 years or older, 334 (8%) homemaker or retired, 157 (4%) students, and 180 (5%) unemployed or disabled patients who considered themselves entirely unable to work, were excluded. Exclusion criteria were partly overlapping. Factors influencing employment status and work ability were assessed on the remaining 3283 (82%) patients.\n\n3.1. Employment status\n\nAs shown in Table , 69% of all patients were employed, varying from 43% in India to 80% in Belgium. Employment status per country is depicted in Figures and (see Tables S1, S2, and S3, and, Table , for exact numbers). Women were generally less often employed than men (65% vs 74%, P < .001), varying from 23% in India to 77% in Belgium. Disability rates increased by age and CHD severity (from 4% in mild to 11% in severe CHD, P < .001). Additional data on employment status, WAS and work limitations according to CHD complexity can be found online in Table . As shown in Figure , employment rates were lower than expected in 8 of 12 countries, particularly in India and Switzerland, and higher than expected in the remaining 4 countries. There was notable variation between countries, ranging from an employment rate of 18% above the general population in Belgium to 18% below the general population in India. Overall, unemployment (including job seeking) was observed in 10% of patients, equally in men and women. In all countries except for Belgium and The Netherlands, unemployment rates were higher in CHD patients than in the general population (Table ).\n\nThe proportion of patients working part‐time varied between countries from 8% in India to 51% in Australia. Women were more likely to work part‐time than men (35% vs 17%, P < .001, Table ). Overall, part‐time employment did not differ according to CHD severity (Table ), but patterns in part‐time workers varied strongly between countries. For example, in Australia, part‐time workers were mostly patients with more severe CHD, whereas in The Netherlands, mainly women worked part‐time.\n\nFactors associated with less employment in multivariate logistic regression analyses by generalized linear models were female sex, worse NYHA functional class, and a history of congestive heart failure (but not CHD severity) (Table ). Higher education (ORs ranging from 1.99, 95% CI 1.37‐2.90 for only high school to 3.69, 95% CI 2.65‐5.14, for university degree) and having a partner (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.48‐1.99) were positively associated with being employed.\n\n3.2. Work ability\n\nMost employed patients (77%) found themselves well capable of working, expressed in a WAS of 8 or higher. This varied from 57% in Taiwan to 94% in Malta (data per country shown online in Table ). In total, only 283 patients (9%) with working experiences scored a WAS of 5 or below (ranging from 0% in Malta to 19% in India). Among all employed patients, 5% considered themselves not at all capable of working, varying from 0% in Argentina, Malta, and The Netherlands to 11% of employed patients in India and Taiwan.\n\n3.3. Work limitations\n\nAmong currently employed patients, 34% experienced some degree of limitations (varying from 16% in Malta to 50% in India and Taiwan, Table ). Figure reflects the employment situation including limitations per country. Patients that experienced working limitations were slightly older (35 ± 11 vs 34 ± 11 years, P < .001) and more likely to be female: limitations were reported by 37% of working women vs 32% of working men (P = .010). Part‐time workers reported more limitations than patients who worked full‐time (43% vs 31% limitations among full‐time workers, P < .001). Table shows that female sex (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17‐1.58), increasing age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02‐1.04; for each increasing year of age, 3% more limitations were seen), more severe CHD (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.09‐1.58 for moderate to 2.10, 95% CI 1.68‐2.62 severe CHD), history of congestive heart failure (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19‐2.08), and mental illness (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.67‐3.06) were all associated with limitations at work. Only 4% of patients with work limitations had none of these associated factors. A university degree was the only factor associated with fewer limitations (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41‐0.93). Patients with more severe CHD reported more work limitations (presented in Table , together with the reported symptoms). The impact of severe CHD (compared to nonsevere CHD) on work limitations varied greatly by country, but was strongly predictive in Japan, India, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, and the United States (ORs ranging from 1.9 to 5.2, see Table ).\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nIn the present study, employment was studied in a large international cohort using a uniform methodology. The majority of CHD patients were employed, despite experiencing severe limitations. The most significant factors positively associated with employment were education and male gender.\n\nTo date, there are only a few prior studies investigating employment in adults with CHD and—despite increasing focus on patient‐reported outcomes—they are mostly limited to the assessment of employment status. Previous studies indicated that adults with CHD from Western Europe and the United States were less likely to be employed than healthy controls, particularly in cyanotic but even in mild CHD.8, 9, 10, 12, 26 However, two Scandinavian studies reported employment levels higher than observed in the general population.14, 15 In our study, employment rates were lower than in the general population in most countries, but there was substantial variation between countries. Since the same questionnaires and reference data were used for all participating countries, we assume that there are indeed genuine differences in the impact of CHD on employment status in different continents and countries.\n\nAlthough the majority of patients were employed and self‐reported as well capable of working, one third experienced limitations at work. More work limitations and a poor self‐declared work ability were observed in economically disadvantaged countries. This may be explained by insufficient social security with less financial support for disabled patients. For example in India, a considerable number of employed patients still considered themselves not capable of working and 50% reported limitations. However, even in a wealthy country like Australia, patients with cardiovascular disease have been reported to be at risk of living in poverty when unemployed due to their condition.27\n\n4.1. Predictors for employment and limitations at work\n\nFactors associated with employment in adults with CHD were in great part similar to factors associated with employment in the general population and in other chronic diseases.17 Higher educational levels and male gender were associated with more employment. Our previous qualitative study on barriers and limitations at work showed that less physical work was beneficial for our patients.11 Higher education generally leads to jobs with less physical work, more internal and external recovery possibilities, and, often, better job conditions. However, patients with CHD are at increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.28 On the whole, patients with CHD attain lower educational levels than the general population.10, 29, 30, 31, 32 Since this study demonstrates a positive effect on employment and limitations at work from higher education, efforts should be undertaken to maximize academic attainment in this population. In a scientific statement, Marino et al. called for vocational planning early in adolescence to maximize appropriate educational options.28 Previous studies have indicated that patients with CHD lack advice on education and career.8, 11 Although they were less likely to consider offered advice helpful than healthy controls, the chance to return to work in patients on sick leave can be influenced by the treating physician.33 Since most patients with CHD are in lifelong cardiac care, the potential impact of advice from health care providers should not be taken lightly.\n\nAs in the general population, female gender was found to be a risk factor for less employment.23 This factor might therefore be more of a cultural reflection of specific gender roles or social stereotyping than a specific risk factor for patients with CHD. However, in prior studies comparing adult CHD patients to the general population, the effect of CHD on employment was larger for men, meaning that employment patterns in male CHD patients differed more from the patterns in the male general population than female patterns did.9, 10, 34 It would be interesting, but beyond the scope of this study, to compare male and female working patterns per country.\n\nWhat could promote successful employment in CHD patients besides good education? Besides early developmental interventions and governmental disability support, hypothetically, working part‐time could be seen as a way to stay employed despite limitations. In our study, patients working part‐time reported more limitations than those working full‐time. However, in countries where a large proportion of patients worked part‐time, disability, or unemployment rates were not specifically lower than countries with fewer part‐time workers. Working part‐time requires flexibility from the employer to accommodate part‐time employment and requires alternative sources for the patient for the remaining income. The lack of the latter may explain that for some patients in certain countries, working part‐time was not an option.\n\n4.2. Strengths and limitations\n\nThe relatively large sample size is a major strength of this study. However, the number of participants (as well as countries per continent) varied between countries, which did not allow for detailed analyses on a national or continental level. Furthermore, the most important limitation, is the lack of reference data on employment on a national level. Therefore, the influence of socioeconomic and cultural factors is unknown. The study was based on uniform questionnaires assessing patient‐reported outcomes. In hindsight, definitions—favorably country‐specific—could have been made more explicit, since some descriptions such as “disability” may have different meanings or regulations between countries. Similarly, the Work Ability Score consists of a “ladder” scale system and the way in which patients interpret this scale and are likely to choose extreme values, could be influenced by country or culture. Furthermore, data on work limitations were only studied in employed patients. This selected sample is likely healthier than the larger CHD population (known as the “healthy worker effect”), thereby limiting generalizability of our findings.35 However, we prioritized internal validity by including only employed patients. Any bias from a “healthy worker effect” is likely in the direction of underestimation of work‐related limitations.\n\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nA history of CHD has consequences beyond the medical field. Although most adults with CHD are employed, CHD continues to have a negative impact on employment. Further, in this global study with uniform questionnaires, employment status and difficulties varied widely between countries. Differences could only be partly explained by economic status. Education is the main predictor for successful employment with higher education appearing to even protect against limitations at work. Since the Work Ability Score (WAS) has proven to be a useful tool to predict future disability in other chronic diseases, a longitudinal follow‐up study is required to determine whether it can also predict disability in CHD patients. In the meantime, a poor WAS in an employed patient should be considered a poor prognostic sign that needs to be addressed and may indicate consultation of an occupational physician or therapist. In general, our results support advocating for patients with CHD to reach their full educational potential.\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nClinicalTrials.gov: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02150603\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02150603\"}}NCT02150603.\n\nSupporting information\n\nTABLE S1 Employment status, work ability and work limitations per country, N=3993\n\nTABLE S2 Employment status, WAS and work limitations per CHD severity\n\nTABLE S3 Impact of severe CHD as risk factor for work limitations (N=941 among N=2756 employed participants), adjusted for age and sex\n\nNotes\n\nSluman MA, Apers S, Sluiter JK, et al.
