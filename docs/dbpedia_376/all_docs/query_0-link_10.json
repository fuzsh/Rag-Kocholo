Most of the names of residents became Hispanicized. The French are the second largest European immigrant group after Spaniards.\n\nThis list is based on multiple sources.\n\nIn response to viewers’ demand, I am progressively adding notes under the names.

He studied botany at the academy in Geneva. He came to Mexico in 1826 to make botanical collections. He then joined, as botanist, the Mexican Boundary Commission, which left Mexico City on November 10, 1827. Berlandier made botanical collections around Laredo, Texas, in February 1828 and around San Antonio, Gonzales, and San Felipe in March, April, and May 1828. He settled at Matamoros, where he married and became a physician. He made further botanical and animal collecting trips in Mexico and Texas. During the Mexican War, he was in charge of the hospitals in Matamoros and served as an interpreter. He drowned in the San Fernando River near Matamoros in 1851.\n\nBerrogaray, Juan Miguel\n\nBetluger, Jacques\n\nBinolas, Pedro Mata\n\nBiourge, Timoteo\n\nBiurra, Juan, Basque\n\nBlanc, Juan Bautista\n\nBlancpain, Joseph (?–1756)\n\nJoseph Blancpain was a French trader of Natchitoches, Louisiana, whose activities in Texas heightened bad feeling between France and Spain in the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1754 Blancpain, Elias George, Antonio de la Fara (Antonio Dessars), and two black men from Louisiana were caught by Lt. Marcos Ruiz trading among the Orcoquiza Indians in Spanish territory. The Frenchmen’s stock of goods was confiscated and divided among their captors; their huts were given to Chief Calzones Colorados; and they were taken to Mexico City and imprisoned. Blancpain testified that he lived on a plantation near New Orleans and that he had been licensed by Jean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, governor of Louisiana, to trade for horses among the Attacapa Indians. A list of his goods showed him to be furnishing the Indians with firearms, and his diary caused the Spanish to believe him to be an agent for the French government. On February 6, 1756, Blancpain died in prison in Mexico City.\n\nBlasio, Juan\n\nBochat d’Oritz, Angel\n\nBocony, Joseph\n\nBodet, Pedro\n\nBodro, Réi\n\nBoinet, Juan Bautista\n\nBoise, Vicente\n\nBolbado, Juan\n\nBolio, Pedro\n\nBonet, Juan\n\nBonet, José\n\nBonnechèe, Lambert\n\nBordelet, Pierre\n\nBos, Francisco,\n\nBos, Jacques\n\nBosie, Francisco\n\nBosquet, Pedro\n\nBouchard de Bercourt, Luis\n\nBouchet, Jean\n\nBoulet, Lorenzo\n\nBoulet, Pierre\n\nBouquet, André.\n\nBourdaiseau (Gabriel de)\n\nBousquet, Jean\n\nBoutoux, Domingo\n\nBoyer, André\n\nBoyer, Jean-Baptiste\n\nBrachet, Jean Baptiste\n\nBrau, Dominique\n\nBréon, Eustache\n\nBréon, Pierre\n\nBronis, Lorenzo\n\nBroos, Joseph\n\nBrouard (Brother Arsène)\n\nChristian Brother was a prominent botanist. When in the early 1900s the French government banned the church from teaching in schools, he was sent to Mexico where he spent eight years, to continue teaching science, French, and mathematics in the Brothers’ schools. There he assembled a collection of 12,000 lichens, mosses, ferns, and flowering plants. Early in the Mexican revolution, the Christian Brothers were forced to leave the country, and Arsène traveled to the United States via Cuba (where he discovered several new species of lichens) and taught for a few years in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Louisiana. He finally went to New Mexico in 1926, in search better health, and remained there the rest of his life.\n\nBrugada, Juan Bautista\n\nBruillard, Carlos\n\nBrullard, Didier\n\nBrun, Bartolome\n\nBruniot, Françis\n\nBuente, Jean Baptiste\n\nBourcq, Pierre\n\nBuet, Pedro\n\nBule, Juan\n\nBullet, Pierre\n\nBurdales, Pedro\n\nBurguet, Pedro\n\nBurquichan, Juan\n\nBusarely, Antonio\n\nBustamante, Miguel\n\nCalas, Juan José\n\nCama, Pedro\n\nLafargue\n\nCaire, Adolphe Arthur\n\nCambier, Juan\n\nCampos, Juan Isidore\n\nCanel de Charnassé Nicolas Urbain Charles\n\nCanet, Pedro\n\nCanitrout, Jacques\n\nCapuran, José\n\nCaranon, Pedro\n\nCarallon, Juan\n\nCarlon, Pedro\n\nGalvez\n\nCarricaburu, dit Castillo, Pedro\n\nCartier\n\nCasanova, Pedro\n\nCasanova, Juan Bautista\n\nCasasola, Fernando\n\nCassagne, Marc\n\nCassini, Alexandre\n\nCasteran, Pedro\n\nCasteigt, Dominique\n\nCastilla, Joseph\n\nCastillon, Benito\n\nCavalier, Diego\n\nCavaly, Francisco\n\nCayrol, Joseph\n\nCervantes, Pedro\n\nChabot, Pierre\n\nChaconi, Juan\n\nChaffau, ou Choffard, Luis\n\nChambon, Ludovic\n\nChampavier, Antonio\n\nChanin, Mariano\n\nChassagnite, Antonio\n\nChausi, Pedro\n\nChavez, André\n\nChenard, Joseph\n\nCherevola, Antonio\n\nChier de la Miller\n\nChirriz, Juan\n\nChoquet de Isla, Diego\n\nChotard, Michel\n\nCis, Guillaume\n\nClavel, Pedro\n\nClouthier\n\nClovet, Alejandro\n\nCoeur, Francisco\n\nChappe d’Hauteroche\n\nCharlantier, Diego\n\nCobos, Féix\n\nColet, Bautista\n\nComberg, Juan Francisco\n\nCompère, Joseph\n\nCondrat, Juan\n\nCondrillie, Louis\n\nConstan, Christian\n\nCoquillet, Pierre\n\nCordero, Pedro\n\nCordier, Juan\n\nCordier, Joseph\n\nCorreche, Antonio\n\nCorroy\n\nCampêhe\n\nCortablau\n\nCosta, Joseph\n\nCosta, Francisco\n\nCouessin, Louis\n\nCourbiere, André Benito\n\nDescendants have researched extensively.

Born in Gascony, France, in 1823, he immigrated to the United States in 1848, landing first at New Orleans and then moving to San Antonio, where he founded the first ice plant in Texas. He was part of a group of Texas merchants of El Paso and San Antonio, who supplied the military posts and settlements in West Texas and New Mexico. The firm Sweet & LaCoste worked with many of the prominent businessmen of the times. In the spring of 1862, the Santa Rita mine was shipping copper via Mexico to the mouth of the Rio Grande, where La Coste had become a broker of Confederate cotton and other goods bound for Britain. Being a Confederate sympathizer, he was protected by the Confederates during their retreat in 1862. He moved to Matamoros (a Mexican port city across the Texas border) around 1863 to serve Emperor Ferdinand Maximilian of Mexico, an adventure we recounted in a previous chapter. LaCoste’s activities in Mexico are beyond the scope of our story, but it is likely that he mingled with the French officers who had taken their quarters at the “Hotel de Richelieu” after their landing on October 9th, 1864. During the remainder of the war, LaCoste lived in Matamoros and shipped Confederate cotton via Mexican ports. He ended his days as a revered pioneer San Antonio businessman, dying in 1887. LaCoste, a city in Medina County, Texas, was named in his honor in 1898.

He arrived in Veracruz in 1831, and was based after 1836 in Mexico City. He was married to Adele Marquet, and their son, José Yves Limantour, was Secretary of Finance of Mexico from 1893-1911.

He became a Mexican financier who served as Secretary of the Finance of Mexico from 1893 until the fall of the Porphyrio Díaz regime in 1911. Limantour established the gold standard in Mexico, suspending free coinage of silver and mandating only government coins be used. He secured the national debt in 1899 with a consortium of foreign banks, and at the time of the outbreak of the Revolution, Mexico was on strong financial basis. Before the Mexican Revolution he was widely seen, along General Bernardo Reyes, as one of the stronger candidates to succeed President Díaz.\n\nLinard, Simon\n\nLiti, Miguel\n\nLiver, Jaime\n\nLoando, Luis\n\nLobillas, Antonio\n\nLobola, Luis\n\nLomé, Francisco\n\nLonguemare, Charles\n\nLongueville, Pedro\n\nMargentier, Juan\n\nMagnany, Francisco\n\nMagne, Antonin\n\nMaillet, Manuel\n\nMallet (Mallet brothers)\n\nMalpilla, Juan\n\nMalvert, Juan\n\nMancion, Pedro\n\nMani, Juan Bautista\n\nManrique, Marie Thérèse\n\nMarie, Louis\n\nMarin, Nicolas\n\nMarint, Juan\n\nMarion, Claude\n\nMarqueza, José\n\nMarron, Juan\n\nMarsellac, Pablo\n\nMartely, Salvador\n\nMartin, André alias Dupan\n\nMartin Diego\n\nMartin, Pedro\n\nMartinez, Salazar y Pacheco (Pedro Lambeyre Permartin)\n\nMasson, Juan\n\nMasy, Nicolas\n\nMathey, Antonio\n\nMauleon, Fernando\n\nMauleon (son of Fernnado)\n\nMaureta de la Barreda, Santiago\n\nMaurice, Luis\n\nMaurras\n\nMaxen, Juan\n\nMaya, Francisco\n\nMayni, Juan Bautista\n\nMayno, Santiago\n\nMaza, Juan Bautista\n\nMazas, Pedro\n\nMazas, Basilio\n\nMazure, Dr. Philippe Auguste\n\nMele, Juan\n\nMenar, Juan\n\nMengein, Juan Pedro\n\nMenonville, Thierry\n\nMestre, Andres\n\nMexana, Armando\n\nMézières, Athanase de\n\nMichamps, José\n\nMichaud, Julio\n\nMignon, Pedro\n\nMiquete, José\n\nMiramon, Bernardo\n\nMiramon, Pedro\n\nMolar, José\n\nMolinaus, Rafaël\n\nMontes, Martin\n\nMorasen, Carlos\n\nMorel, Etienne/Esteban, medical doctor, persecuted in 1795, committed suicide, see Bancroft, vol.

His father René Paul was a French Colonel under Napoléon, wounded while serving on the French flagship at Trafalgar. René Paul immigrated to Philadelphia, and then moved to St. Louis, where he married Eulalie Chouteau, daughter of Auguste Chouteau and Marie-Thérèse Cerré. Gabriel-René was their first child, out of nine (three died in childhood). A West Point graduate, he was a career officer in the United States Army. He had fought in the Seminole Wars in Florida, in the Mexican War, where he was wounded at Cerro Gordo but still led the party that captured the Mexican flag flying over Chapultepec. He also served on the Texas-Mexico border and in Utah. At age 48, Gabriel-René was posted at Fort Union in New Mexico in 1861 and 1862, during the Confederate invasion. There, he was appointed commander at the request of his men, as they saw in him a man “of considerable influence and energy.” He then became acting inspector general of the volunteers charged with superintending the instruction and discipline of the recruits. At Fort Union in January 1862, he reorganized the militia, drilling the men day and night. He squelched a soldiers’ mutiny (they had not been paid), put the men in the company at hard labor until night, discharged company commanders, demoted non-commissioned officers and assigned all enlisted men to other companies. The next month, still at Fort Union, he was in command of the 4th New Mexico Mounted Infantry and the Eastern District. After the Battle of Glorieta in March, he replaced General Slough (on April 9, 1862) as commander of Federal forces at Fort Union. He moved south, participated in the Battle of Albuquerque (April), was promoted Brigadier General, and replaced Colonel Kit Carson at Fort Craig before returning to Fort Union. He left New Mexico in December, 1862, going east to command New York and New Jersey regiments. On the first day at the Battle of Gettysburg, a rifle bullet entered his right temple and passed through his left eye, totally blinding him and impairing his senses of smell and hearing. Disabled, he held honorary positions and died 23 years later in Washington, D.C. He rests in the Arlington cemetery. He had six children, three daughters and a son from his first marriage (in 1835, with Mary Ann Whistler, daughter of Colonel William Whistler), and two daughters from his second marriage (in 1858, with Louise Rodgers).
