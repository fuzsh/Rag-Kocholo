        "meta_description": "Abstract. All organisms are ultimately dependent on a large diversity of consumptive\nand non-consumptive interactions established with other organisms, forming\nan intricate web of interdependencies. In 1992, when 1700 concerned\nscientists issued the first âWorld Scientists' Warning to Humanityâ, our\nunderstanding of such interaction networks was still in its infancy. By\nsimultaneously considering the species (nodes) and the links that glue them\ntogether into functional communities, the study of modern food webs â or\nmore generally ecological networks â has brought us closer to a predictive\ncommunity ecology. Scientists have now observed, manipulated, and modelled\nthe assembly and the collapse of food webs under various global change\nstressors and identified common patterns. Most stressors, such as increasing\ntemperature, biological invasions, biodiversity loss, habitat fragmentation,\nover-exploitation, have been shown to simplify food webs by\nconcentrating energy flow along fewer pathways, threatening long-term\ncommunity persistence. More worryingly, it has been shown that communities\ncan abruptly change from highly diverse to simplified stable states with\nlittle or no warning. Altogether, evidence shows that apart from the\nchallenge of tackling climate change and hampering the extinction of\nthreatened species, we need urgent action to tackle large-scale biological\nchange and specifically to protect food webs, as we are under the risk of pushing\nentire ecosystems outside their safe zones. At the same time, we need to\ngain a better understanding of the global-scale synergies and trade-offs\nbetween climate change and biological change. Here we highlight the most\npressing challenges for the conservation of natural food webs and recent\nadvances that might help us addressing such challenges.",
