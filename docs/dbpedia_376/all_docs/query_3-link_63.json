In all that time I can’t recall a single significant glitch – they’ve always completed work quickly and well, and with notable courtesy. I’d recommend Ashdown Technologies to a friend, without hesitation.\n\nMike CharterisGeneral ManagerStannah Stairlifts Inc.\n\nWe have been working with Ashdown for over 27 years. They developed our web site, host it and provide all technical assistance we have required throughout this period. We have found them very responsive and knowledgeable in regards to all areas of web design, development while providing excellent follow up support. They are considered an integral part of our team.\n\nBill BoucherPresidentBerkshire Electronics, Inc\n\nI’ve been working with Ashdown Technologies Inc. (and the company which evolved to become Ashdown) since 1995, which means more than 29 years. I think that says it all. One thing that makes them stand out and above any other hosting company is their customer support. Due to my profession, I’ve come to know some of the most customer-support oriented companies (and some which left a lot to be desired, in this field). Ashdown tops them all, they have the best customer support in this business.\n\nJohn C.OwnerM1911.ORG\n\nMilford Water Company has been using the services of Ashdown Technologies for approximately 22 years and over that time their service and support has been wonderful. Most recently they undertook a complete re-design of our company web page which had become outdated and not very user friendly. Ashdown with its vast technical knowledge and experience in web design proved to be invaluable throughout the entire process. Milford Water Company has recommend Colin and his team to other affiliated companies and has heard nothing but positive feedback and would strongly recommend them to anyone.\n\nDavid L. CondreyGeneral ManagerMilford Water Company\n\nAt Zeppotech (formerly ehomewatch) we design, build, and test internet-connected product concepts for home monitoring and residential community security. Over 23 years, we have worked with Ashdown and its predecessors for email and web hosting to support ‘real’ and ‘prototype’ projects. To us, the value of Ashdown is simple — security, knowledge, and PERSONAL support. When we call, we call a person, BY NAME, who we know we can trust because he has been there for the duration, and because we know he will personally follow through.\n\nWayne LilleyOwnerZeppotech (formerly ehomewatch, Nemo Software)\n\nThe team at Ashdown did everything we asked for, and guided us through the entire process.We use Ashdown for email, they built our website, they host the site, and they are always there to answer our many questions, and fast to fix our mishaps.Sales team is up to date on all forms of internet traffic, as well as techniques to enhance your presence in the digital arena.We have used Ashdown since 2010 and will continue to benefit from their vast technological knowledge base for the foreseeable future.Great company, competitive pricing, AWESOME SERVICE!\n\nJohn WhitePresidentPro Tech Pest Control\n\nI’ve been with Ashdown for many years with several sites. They are always very responsive, ready with solutions and provides a stable site.\n\nLarry RaffCopley Raff Inc.\n\nI have been in the tech business since 1981 and in 2000 was very fortunate to learn about Lightband Technologies – soon to become Ashdown Technologies. Our business required web hosting with database functions for customer interactions along with a robust and reliable email service. Over these many years we have dealt with many tech companies along with their customer support staff. Don Olson of Ashdown Technology is the VERY BEST technical and support person we ever had and is an important part of our success and growth because of his reliable presence and expertise, I couldn’t image running our business without knowing Don was available when technical issues arose. Don Olson is the very best at what he does and we are very fortunate to have him keep his eye on our business at MassCamps.com through his technical world.Ashdown Technologies is a rock solid, reliable and dependable company with a host of services to help your company succeed in our technical world. Rich Stearman created a custom online database for us that has worked flawlessly for many years and the process of working with Rich converting our ideas and needs into this database went smoothly and efficiently at a very fair price. We will always be thankful to Rich for his excellent work.If your company relies on web technology for your business success, I highly recommend contacting Ashdown Technologies – get your business running efficiently on the Ashdown Technologies track.\n\nMike PolakoffPresidentMassCamps.com\n\nAshdown Technologies has provided outstanding services for my company. They created a professional website for us (which they also host) and registered domain names so that prospective clients can easily find our company on the web. Ashdown keeps track of when the domain names will expire and asks me if I’d like to renew them so I never have to think about doing it. As a small business owner it is nice to have a company like Ashdown Tech in my corner. There are so many things to remember to do as an owner and it’s nice to know that all my web based needs are covered with one company and they are on top of it. Even though they created a powerful interactive website for us, they kept it simple so that I can easily manage the aspects of it that need my attention. I do not hesitate to recommend Ashdown Technologies….a small company with big capabilities and great service.\n\nJohn S.PresidentAces High Services, Inc.\n\nThanks for all of your hard work in converting the website!\n\nJamieISPE Boston\n\nI am a very small business: I operate a one-person PR agency for clients. Many of my contacts are outside of the US. I cannot afford to be offline—and cannot rely solely on myself to keep my business online. For more than a decade I have relied on Ashdown Technologies to assure that I am always connected. When I call, any problems (and there have not been many) are resolved quickly and painlessly. I could save money by working with a larger provider, but I cannot afford to depend on anyone else.\n\nIrv PressPrincipalPress+\n\nOur organization has been with Ashdown for many years. Ashdown is great to work with. Ashdown created our original website and then migrated it to WordPress. They continue to support us and help maintain it. I really appreciate Ashdown’s timely and complete responses to any questions or help that we may need.\n\nKathyAdministrationFDSOA\n\nAfter brutal experiences with two high profile internet providers I got lucky and found Ashdown Technologies. I have been with them for 12 years with 2 small businesses and they have made my on-line presence a joy. When ever I had a problem they were there to help me immediately and resolve the issue. Even helping me beyond the scope of what they needed to do at times. I can’t say enough about these people.\n\nDot M.OwnerD & M Analysis\n\nWorking with Richard Stearman and Ashdown Technologies has been a real joy. It took me years to find someone who not only understood the technology but could communicate it simply to me and my clients.I have complete confidence in Richard’s advice and counsel – and patience. He is always willing to the take the time to walk me through my options. And the company itself has been consistently responsive to my technology needs.If you are searching for a technology or website partner, Ashdown should be on your short list. Heck, forget the list. Just call them.\n\nBob McCarthyOwnerMcCarthy & King Marketing\n\nThe Ashdown staff is always a pleasure to work with. They are extremely responsive to requests and take the time to translate techno-speak into English.

It is a pleasure to work with them. We have never had a problem with our website being hacked or down. Website updates are done promptly and efficiently. We are ranked high on search engines. The staff are very prompt in responding to emails and they offer good suggestions on updates for our site in order to keep it fresh and current. The price for their service is also reasonable. I would highly recommend Ashdown Technologies.\n\nCatherine PisacaneExecutive DirectorProject Smile\n\nWe’ve used Colin and his company (Ashdown Technologies) for over 21 years to provide website hosting, and to manage all our email and server needs. Anyone who lasts over 10 years in the IT field must be doing something right! Ideal for the small-to-mid size business. Friendly, quick, knowledgeable, good value.\n\nMartin StevensonBusiness Development ManagerStannah Stairlifts Inc.\n\nBack in 2006, at the recommendation of an attorney friend of mine, I used Ashdown Technologies to build and host a website for my private investigative business. Since then they have built a second website and also host my e-mail service. Ashdown has become my de-facto outsourced IT Department. Richard, Colin and the whole team at Ashdown have been extremely responsive to any issue, problem or question that has arisen over that time. I have found their work to be prompt, professional and practical – not to mention cost effective – which is important for a small business like mine. I heartily recommend Ashdown to any business as I believe their professionalism, customer service, quality of work and bang for the buck is second to none.\n\nChris MarquetCEOMarquet International, Ltd.\n\nCentral Massachusetts Agency on Aging has work with Ashdown Technologies for more than two decades. Their expertise has far outpaced any other provider we have seen. But more importantly, they have worked with us in support of our Agency’s mission to help older adults.

I have recommended them to a number of my members…\n\nDave D.DirectorNECMA\n\nI have enjoyed a long and extremely fruitful relationship with Ashdown Tech, dating back to the early 2000s when their Network Operations Center, under the name of Lightband, hosted the ProSoundWeb.com websites where I was webmaster. I co-locate my servers with Ashdown, and they provide superb tech support for my clients, including Telefunken Elektroakustik, Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce, Town Crier, and dozens more. They go above and beyond the call of duty with regard to server maintenance, email support, and any number of technical issues. Ashdown and Standing Stone Designs have often collaborated on site development projects, with Ashdown providing outstanding programming and development on projects ranging from the AfterFiftyLiving.com social network to database and forum integration for ProSoundWeb.com and a number of sites using WordPress as CMS (Content Management System).
