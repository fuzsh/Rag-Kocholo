        "text": "Successful change comes in a series of small steps. You figure out where you want to be, take action, and reflect on whether you have moved forward or backward. The most hellish, toxic organisations I have ever encountered are ones where a “hero” believes they know what is best for everyone, and implements their vision of the future from the top down. I have seen firsthand hand how a person can proclaim success because their change initiative went exactly “to plan”, while over half the workforce quits and the company culture and financial performance was destroyed. Success is not being correct. Success is not enforcing compliance. Success is creating better outcomes for the people around you. This takes openness, humility and creativity.\n\nI posted earlier about the problem of dopamine seeking and social reinforcement, and wanted to add an analogy; Sometimes, being the person in an organization that's pushing to change deeply held patterns of behaviour can feel crazy. It's like being in an organization where everyone is smoking crack. They're all still basically getting their work done, but they smoke crack all the time. And if you were to say to them \"You shouldn't smoke crack, it's bad for you, and it's making you less effective at your work\", they might get angry at you. \"But we love crack. It makes us happy. We're still getting our work done, and we can do it while smoking crack\" Can you imagine being the only non-crack smoker trying to tell a room full of people that they should stop smoking crack? It turns out, they'd all probably agree that you're stupid. But is their majority agreement evidence that you should start smoking crack too? This might sound like an utterly stupid analogy. And it kind of is. But it is stretching a very comparable reality, to absurdity. The dopamine releases that people get in social systems when they behave according to social norms is something they will work very hard to protect. Breaking that addiction is very difficult.\n\nHumans are basically just dopamine seeking machines. Any time we perform an activity that releases dopamine, we tend to do it more. If we find something that creates more dopamine, we'll choose that thing in favour of 'better' choices. This obviously has powerful implications when it comes to things like exercise, diet, and various forms of addiction, but something I rarely hear discussed is how this impacts social structures and behaviour. Generally speaking, if you do something that leads to you being praised by others, you'll do it more. When you 'go along' with the people around you, reinforcing their own behaviours, you all give each other dopamine hits, and so start reinforcing behaviour even if it's objectively not in your best interest. This is how the majority of toxic work environments tend to emerge. No one wants to feel victimized, undervalued or manipulated, but when the behaviours that lead to these outcomes are the social norm, people are constantly getting a dopamine hit for making choices that reinforce them. Making changes to your life, and certainly to your system, requires a very strong-will. You need to be able to put yourself into a dopamine deficit in the short term in order to achieve a better long-term state, and honestly, I don't know that 90 percent of people will ever do this. This means that any major change seems to always come down to a small group of people who take on a disproportionate level of pain for the benefit of everyone. And often, these people are seen in a very negative light as they are not just costing themselves dopamine, but are undermining the social reinforcement and therefore dopamine release of others. So the next time you look at people who are 'troublemakers' and wonder why they can't just go along with the thing that makes you happy, ask if it's possible that they might be making the sacrifice you are unwilling to make in order to make things better in the long term.\n\nIf you only measure one thing in your business, it should be how long it takes you to deliver value. We could simply call this 'cycle time', but the problem is that many businesses are full of useless cycles. Building things that don't matter for people who don't care. And it's really easy to make yourself look good by optimizing wasteful systems. So the real question is; how long does it take from when you set a true business goal, with an associated dollar value, to actually capitalizing on it? Don't make the mistake of cramming more activity into the same timeframe and calling it productivity. Speed to outcome often requires *less* activity."
