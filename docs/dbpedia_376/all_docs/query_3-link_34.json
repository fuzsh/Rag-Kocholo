        "text": "September 27, 2023: San Diego’s renowned LaunchPad incubator is open for applications from startup entrepreneurs for its 2024 class. A program of Procopio Business Advisors, LLC (PBA) since 2012, this highly competitive program hosts emerging growth companies in Procopio’s Del Mar Heights offices, located in the heart of San Diego’s high-technology community. The companies’ entrepreneurs work side by side with Procopio attorneys as they begin the formation, protection of core technology, early funding and growth of their startups.\n\n“San Diego’s innovation economy is driven by startups in a wide range of industries, from software-as-a-service to renewable energy,” said Procopio Corporate Law Partner Mike Kinkelaar. “We love playing a role at the start of a creative entrepreneur’s journey, providing guidance and assistance as we focus on ensuring their growth and success.”\n\nLaunchPad participants receive a selection of complimentary corporate and intellectual property legal services along with office space and back-office business support. The nine-month program also includes educational opportunities on key topics including valuation, funding, intellectual property strategy, employment issues, and pursuing a strong exit. Procopio attorneys provide ongoing legal support and assist with corporate structuring, patent protection, investor pitches, branding, and growth strategy.\n\nParticipants come from a wide range of industries, including software and Internet-based technology, high-tech hardware, life sciences and med tech, health care and digital health care, clean tech and renewable energy, telecommunications, and more.\n\n“Our experience with LaunchPad exceeded our expectations,” said 2023 participant Rebecca Hoffman, Co-Founder of PERCEEV. “Plenty of incubators and accelerators focus on the ‘fun’ stuff like product development and pitch strategy. LaunchPad helps founders establish the foundation required for a successful startup to fundraise and scale. Not only does Procopio provide a team of top tier attorneys, but their connections in our community run very deep. They provided many excellent educational sessions in addition to networking events and great personal introductions. We are proud to have Procopio on our team!”\n\nProcopio attorneys participating in the program include Kinkelaar and other Corporate Law Partners such as Paul Johnson and Dennis Doucette, as well as Intellectual Property Partners Noel Gillespie and Pattric Rawlins. They work in tandem with Procopio Business Advisors Senior Consultant Ken Weixel and Chief Marketing and Business Development Officer Kevin Wilson.\n\n“The Procopio LaunchPad program was an educational, supportive, and vital aspect of Kaptain growing,” said 2023 participant Kirk Magnuson, Founder and CEO of Kaptain Outside App. “We were able to learn from people who had decades of experience, ensure our company was legally ready to fundraise, and brainstorm on strategy and execution. It was an extremely valuable experience.”\n\nA key strength of the LaunchPad is its Advisory Board comprising successful entrepreneurs and investors and experts in finance, marketing and other critical areas for emerging-growth companies. Members include life sciences serial entrepreneur and CONNECT Entrepreneur Hall of Fame inductee Magda Marquet; serial medtech entrepreneur, venture investor, board member and advisor Brian Kelleher; longtime San Diego growth strategist Susan Kuruvilla; healthcare executive and board advisor Sal DiGiuseppi; serial entrepreneur and Ryanis LLC CEO/CTO Sasha Banjac; and accomplished technologist and digital innovator Manuel Jaime.\n\n“Being an incubatee in Procopio’s LaunchPad was invaluable for our sports tech startup,” said 2023 participants Rogério “Roger” Carlson and Tawnia Gillespie, co-founders of ActvFan. “Not only did Procopio provide excellent legal support and services, but also their stellar reputation and extensive network provided access to outstanding professionals, some of whom are now part of our Advisory Board.”"
