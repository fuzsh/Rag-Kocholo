        "text": "Be in Nature — It doesn’t matter if this is a walk in the woods, a stroll on the beach, visiting a local nature center, or simply tending to a house plant. Be around nature. It’s scientifically proven to uplift us.\n\nAs a part of my series about “Connecting With Yourself To Live With Better Relationships” I had the pleasure to interview Jaime Komer. She is an Olympic Silver Medalist, 2-time World Champion, Certified Health Coach, and Founder of Happy Vibes. www.wearhappyvibes.com. She created Happy Vibes as a way to raise our collective energy and wellbeing. By wearing a Happy Vibes bracelet, you are increasing your positive thinking and elevating the positive energy around you. Jaime applied these empowering Happy Vibes practices while training for the Olympics in Water Polo, in her 11+ years in the health and fitness field, and now as a mother and entrepreneur. Her passion for wellbeing and zest for life is contagious, just like positivity energy."
