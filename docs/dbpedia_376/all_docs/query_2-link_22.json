Initially trained in mathematics and finance, his observations of the natural world led him to explore chaos theory, while mathematics took him to the limits of our perception of the universe, and the financial markets provided the ultimate theatre of random flux and risk. For the past decade, he has explored contemporary dance through courses and workshops in a variety of Paris venues (Micadanses, Ménagerie de Verre, Maison des pratiques artistiques amateurs…). He remains today an associate director of a firm of financial advisors and believes that if ‘sociology is a combat sport,’* contemporary dance is in the front line.\n\n* Title of a film by Pierre Carles.\n\nPhilip Berlin, Jean Capeille, Tristan Ihne\n\nI Might Steal Your Clothes\n\nFrance-Sweden\n\nIn I might steal your clothes, audience and dancers all face the same way, in a single, unbroken line of perspective.\n\nChoreography Philip Berlin\n\nIdea & Concept Philip Berlin, Jean Capeille & Tristan Ihne\n\nPerformers Jean Capeille, Marc Galvez, Tristan Ihne, Vivien Ingrams, Lucile Moulin, Sakiko Oishi, Marion Rastouil & Elisa Ribes\n\nThree artists – all dancers with CCN-Ballet de Lorraine – have come together to create this new piece.

Born in Paris in 1989, Jean Capeille studied contemporary dance at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse in Paris (contemporary dance stream). In addition to performing, he is a contributor to Versus, a new review dedicated to the world of dance. Born in Geneva in 1986, Tristan Ihne trained in classical dance at the Geneva Dance Center. He performed works from the classical repertory with the Ballet de Bordeaux, before joining the Ballet de Lorraine in 2007.\n\nCarolina Castañeda, Marie De Testa\n\nLa Danse des étoiles, Éloge du mouvement\n\nBelgium-France-Mexico\n\nLa Danse des étoiles… uses incandescent gesture to recreate the star-map of the night sky above the theatre, inside the auditorium.\n\nConception Carolina Castañeda & Marie de Testa\n\nParticipants Pablo Arellano, Betty Bayen, Carolina Castañeda, Raphaël Ceriez, Marion Clément, Taïeb Elie, Marcos Garcia, Stéphanie Garcia, Julien Goeffier, César Gourdon, Elsa Grzeszczak, Montserrat Guzmán, Laure Haulet, Paloma Hidalgo, Manon Jovenon, Thomas Junca, Carole Labouze, Christelle Lazareno, Zineb Loh, Flavia Lombardo, Helena Milbach, Fanny Moal, Marine Moal, Adrian Moreau, Marcela Moreau, Mario Nuñez, Catherine Radosa, Garance Rivoal, Triana Rodriguez, Lucía Serrano, Marie de Testa, Ellen Wolf (distribution en cours)\n\nCarolina Castañeda and Marie de Testa were both born in 1987, both with dual nationality.

She was part of the team representing Mexico at the Rotterdam architecture biennale, and also works as an actor, collaborating with Mexican director Arturo Jimenez and performing in New York at the West 45th Street Theater and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Jennifer Lauro Mariani entered the Beaux-Arts in Lyon in 2005, after early theatrical training with the Ecole du Spectacle in Sèvres.
