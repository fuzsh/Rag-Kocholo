        "text": "Know Everything There Is To Know About Your Products — It sounds simple, but you’d be surprised how many CEOs don’t really understand their own products. To be an effective CEO, you need to be familiar with what you, your company and your sales teams are selling. This will help you negotiate better deals, make more strategic acquisitions, and plan better for the future.\n\nAs part of my series about the five things a business should do to create a Wow! customer experience, I had the pleasure of interviewing James Hartling. James is the Chief Architect for Cognizant Softvision, a division of Cognizant Digital Business. He is responsible for Client Technical Architecture and joined Softvision through the acquisition of his company Double Prime in 2015. His primary responsibility is working with customers of Cognizant Softvision at the interface of their strategy and technology. James has an extensive background in various fields of science and engineering, holding a B.S. in Physics from SUNY Stony Brook and a Masters in Physical Chemistry from Yale."
