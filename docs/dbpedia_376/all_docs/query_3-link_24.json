        "text": "Today, unfortunately, I was one of the many that was let go from Tesla. If anyone in the IT industry has recommendations for positions open in the Buffalo area. I would appreciate it. I updated my profile with my recent Tesla experience. I was proud to work for such an amazing and innovative company and anyone who worked with me knew me as the \"Tesla Fanboy\". I fell in love with the products including the Tesla Energy side of the business. But ultimately, I fell in love with my team. Never had I worked for a company where the camaraderie and team work was the pinnacle of our teams success. We all meshed together and everyone was open to new ideas or processes and the jokes were in abundance. Managing multiple Tesla Center projects was no easy task but Tesla made it manageable and provided any resource we needed to make our work seamless and streamlined. Being able to travel and meeting many people from the Tesla Centers was one of the best parts of the job and creating those relationships. This allowed the local sites to become aware of IT and allowed me to educate them on practices they may have forgotten and also allowed me to educate them on principle if there is an issue we should take care if it right away. Thank you to Tesla for giving me the opportunity to show what I can do and for pushing me to beyond what I thought my limits were. Also thank you for giving me the best 3.5 years of my professional career! UPDATE: I want to add that there is no love loss for Tesla as a company. I still think that Tesla is an amazing company and I still believe in their vision. I have learned the true value of teamwork and brotherhood. Tesla isn't just an Energy and Car Company. It's a culture. Elon has a vision and truly believes in what Teslas mission is and I still stand behind that. Yes, its unfortunate that my position was eliminated, but many other companies have went through the same process. Keep on transitioning the world to sustainable energy, Tesla. I still believe in you.\n\nFor the last 7 days I've been living with the Tesla Model Y. I've done a small video to give those looking to go electric, a friendly introduction to the car. You won't find me giving out stats, measurements or boring car-man facts. You can find all that on the website or the 1 million YouTube reviews. What I have got is experience with living and driving this car. I know how it *feels* and I know how it fits into my life. For me that's more important than the litre capacity of the boot or the width of the car. I've had a lot of great questions about this car so a few key points: üöó 331 miles of range (this is the long range version) ‚ö° Access to 1400+ superchargers in the UK and 50,000 worldwide üìà Can add up to 150 miles in 15 minutes üîã 250kw maximum charging capacity (basically you can charge like REALLY quickly) üì≤ Phone integration (the app is great) üîä Brilliant audio system (tested that out belting out show tunes down the M6) üê∂ Dog mode (great for dogs or siblings you don't particularly like...) üëì All glass roof #livingmybestlife üì∫ 15\" touchscreen (easy to use and nice to look at) ‚úÖ Towing capacity of around 1500kg A huge shoutout to the team at Tesla, particularly Kirsty S. who organised this press car for me. A great experience and I can't wait to own one... one day üòå With sub ¬£15k Model 3s hitting the UK market, it may be sooner than I think üí≠ https://lnkd.in/ezQyYA9s What do you want a review of next?

There's something deeply soothing about hitting the open road, letting your favorite tunes fill the car, and allowing your thoughts to drift. It‚Äôs a unique opportunity to disconnect from daily stresses and focus on the simple pleasures of the journey itself. Choosing a scenic route can enhance this experience, offering beautiful views that further contribute to a sense of tranquility and reflection. When you decide to ignore the usual traffic and noise, choosing instead to enjoy the drive, you create a personal sanctuary on wheels. This mindful approach to driving can turn a routine activity into a therapeutic escape, helping you feel refreshed and rejuvenated. Whether you use the time to ponder life's questions or simply to unwind, a peaceful solo drive can be a wonderful way to clear your mind and gain a new perspective. So, next time you need a mental reset, get behind the wheel and let the road guide you to some much-needed answers and calm.\n\nLife & Cars ! Growing up, I found myself drawn to two distinct passions: understanding people and delving into the intricate world of cars. These seemingly unrelated interests have woven together to shape my unique perspective on life. From a young age, I discovered a fascination with human behavior. Observing people, deciphering their motivations, and understanding their emotions became a personal quest. Through countless interactions and experiences, I learned to read between the lines, picking up on subtle cues and nuances that often go unnoticed. Each encounter became a lesson, teaching me empathy, patience, and the art of effective communication. In parallel, my love affair with cars began. Whether tinkering under the hood with my father or admiring sleek designs at auto shows, I was captivated by the engineering marvels on four wheels. From classic muscle cars to cutting-edge hybrids, each vehicle had its own story to tell. I immersed myself in the world of automotive technology, soaking up knowledge about engines, aerodynamics, and driving dynamics. As I navigated through life, these dual passions continued to shape my journey. In my professional endeavors, my understanding of human behavior proved invaluable, whether it was negotiating deals, leading teams, or building relationships. I learned to anticipate needs, tailor my approach, and navigate complex social dynamics with ease. Simultaneously, my expertise in cars opened doors to exciting opportunities. From advising friends on vehicle purchases to participating in racing events, I found joy in sharing my knowledge and passion with others. Whether behind the wheel or discussing the latest automotive trends, I felt at home in the world of automobiles. Through it all, I've come to realize that life is a beautiful tapestry woven from diverse experiences and interests. Each encounter, whether with people or cars, has enriched my understanding of the world and shaped the person I am today. And as I continue on this journey, I remain grateful for the lessons learned from both the highways of life and the open road.\n\n2015! What a year. It‚Äôs the year I joined Tesla when electric vehicles were just an idea. I thought I‚Äôd share three common questions I got when I was joining. Q: What/who is Tesla? (Remember, back in 2015, Tesla was at an infant stage.) A: They make electric cars... I think. (Got to admit, I wasn‚Äôt too convinced.) Q: What are you going to do there? A: Work as an engineer. (Ended up being only 5% of my job.) Q: So you are moving across the world for an \"IDEA\" of a company, which was not even in a proven sector? A: I guess, yes. We all have to take some risks and make sacrifices, just have to go with my instincts on this. Every day working there was a new challenge and experience. Tesla pushed me beyond my comfort zone. It was certainly worth the risk because the people I worked with, and what I learned and achieved, are simply phenomenal. It‚Äôs a decade of experience condensed into four years. It was a career-defining moment for me, and I suppose all of us have those junctions in our lives.
