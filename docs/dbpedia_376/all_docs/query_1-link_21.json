Juveniles over age 18 may not be charged with status offenses.\n\nEach charge/offense is reviewed by the Marquette County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. If a petition is authorized, it is submitted to the Juvenile Court for processing. Once received by the Juvenile Court, an intake is completed and reviewed by the Director of Juvenile Court to determine whether the petition should be handled formally or informally.\n\nAbuse/neglect allegations are investigated by the Childrenâ€™s Protective Services Division of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). A prosecutor reviews all petitions before they are filed with the court, and acts as legal counsel for DHHS once the case comes to court. Caseworker services for abuse/neglect cases are provided by DHHS employees."
