Not only are financial coaching services a key to employee success, but Francis’ services stand out in providing excellent money and retirement coaching. I greatly appreciate being a part of a team that positively impacts the financial wellness of thousands of people across the country.\n\nLife:\n\nMy recipe for some joy and relaxation includes listening to live music, preferably my favorite band, O.A.R.; smoking Texas style barbecue with experimental rub recipes in my offset smoker; and/or playing pickup basketball games (old man basketball), made all the better when my two adult boys are on the court.\n\nMoney:\n\nTo help bridge the knowledge gap of financial services, I encourage employers to incorporate supportive and structured financial learning opportunities into their benefits packages.\n\nSue Salmon\n\nPrincipal | Director of Operations\n\nEducation: B.S.

Whether it is guiding a new hire through the onboarding process or researching questions for our clients, I find my work at Francis very gratifying.\n\nLife:\n\nI am all about family time. On a Saturday, you can find me watching one of my grandchildren playing youth football or basketball. When it is not about the grandkids, I am with friends playing pickleball, walking my doodle, Cooper, or gardening.\n\nMoney:\n\nPay yourself first!

Besides being able to fulfill my innate desire to nerd out on investments, I also find it gratifying to help clients accomplish their goals and to operate smoothly despite hazardous conflicts of interest found in the financial industry.\n\nLife:\n\nMy life revolves around my three young children, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. When I am not chaperoning trips to the park or pounding an ice cream cone, I am living my best life on the lake, cheering on Marquette basketball or relaxing with my wife (and/or red wine).\n\nMoney:\n\nYour success won’t be determined by how you invest or the number of times you meet with an advisor; rather, it depends on how much you can afford to stash away.\n\nKevin Skow\n\nVice President Retirement Plan Consulting | Regional Director\n\nCertifications/Designations: Series 65, Certified Pension Consultant (CPC), Qualified Pension Administrator (QPA), Qualified 401(k) Administrator (QKA)\n\nEducation: B.A. Communications, Marquette University\n\nKevin co-leads Francis’ Minnesota division in the Twin Cities and brings over 25 years of retirement plan recordkeeping\n\nMore >\n\nX\n\nKevin co-leads Francis’ Minnesota division in the Twin Cities and brings over 25 years of retirement plan recordkeeping and consulting experience to his role.

I serve on the board of directors of Friends of FANA Minnesota, an all-volunteer group that provides support for the FANA orphanage and a local resource for families who have adopted children from Colombia. When I am not serving the community, I can be found skiing, golfing, running and waiting for March Madness to come around again.\n\nMoney:\n\nTransparency is key. And if it cannot be disclosed clearly, walk away. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about fees and how the people you seek to help you are compensated for their advice and guidance.\n\nDave Mandel\n\nVice President Investment Consulting | Regional Director\n\nCertifications/Designations: Series 65; ERISA Fiduciary\n\nEducation: B.S.

You can catch me hiking, camping, fishing and kayaking. Nature is my favorite way to unwind, especially if it means getting to spend quality time with family.\n\nMoney:\n\nIt’s never too early to start saving.

I believe diversity is our strength, and that there is far more that connects us than divides us. Money can be a struggle for all, but being attentive to everyone’s unique needs and goals to create a plan that brings them financial peace is what I enjoy most about my role.\n\nLife:\n\nManaging a dual career household with two young daughters, I find that taking one day at a time helps me focus on the imperfect art of balancing it all. Traveling, spending time in nature and playing guitar are all activities I enjoy, but nothing keeps me more grounded than quality time with my husband and kids.\n\nMoney:\n\nKeeping up with the Joneses could be keeping you from meeting your money goals.

My parents taught me the importance of saving money, even though they did not have the knowledge or skills to invest in or build their own financial plan. I am passionate about helping others improve their financial circumstances today and for generations to come by advising them on their money goals.\n\nLife:\n\nMy life revolves around my two young children and my partner. Whether it is bike riding on the Great Sauk Trail, enjoying live music overlooking the Wisconsin River or picnicking and cooling off at the splash pad, we love everything that our home of Sauk City has to offer, especially during the summer. When we are not at home, we love exploring new cities and state and national parks.\n\nMoney:\n\nHave a safety net cash stash; a three-to-six-month emergency fund will give you peace of mind, help reduce financial stress and prepare you for life’s curveballs. Invest as early in life as you can, keep it simple and automate monthly contributions.\n\nMacy Fallico\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nCertifications/Designations: Series 65, ERISA Fiduciary\n\nEducation: B.S.
