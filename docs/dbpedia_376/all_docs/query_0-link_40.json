        "text": "A unit—$100 million—just isn’t what it used to be. This year it took a minimum of $120 million to earn a spot on the Texas 100. Fierce competition bumped 21 of last year’s rich-listers off this year’s list—and 21 even wealthier Texans have taken their place.\n\nSeventeen of the newcomers are from Dallas, Fort Worth, or Houston. A year of digging led us to Dallas’ Robert Brittingham, Sr., who built a fortune in ceramic tile before selling out last year. The richest man no one had ever heard of, Brittingham proved to be the toughest to research. We could sooner get Defense Department secrets than details of Brittingham’s past. Also among the underground rich debuting this year are Houston heiresses Marjorie Gray and Gay Alspaugh Roane, whose money came from an Oklahoma oilman.\n\nFloyd Cailloux, now retired in Kerrville, had a good year. His net worth—mostly Keystone International stock—rocketed to over $130 million, up more than 100 percent from last summer. An engineer, Cailloux made his money designing industrial conveying systems, automated machines that easily move and measure large amounts of dry material. Meanwhile, Louisa Sarofim, a beneficiary of big-money divorce, joins the Texas 100. Louisa, an already wealthy member of Houston’s Brown family, settled for an estimated $250 million from Houston money manager Fayez Sarofim. He seems to have taken it all in stride. “Things change,” says Sarofim.\n\nIn assigning values, conservatism was our guide. “We were especially cautious with real estate, whether in Dallas or Boston or Atlanta. Where debt was unknown, we assumed it was 90 percent of a property’s value. Values were checked with local brokers and analysts who know the market. We valued private companies by comparing them with similar publicly traded companies. Oil and gas assets were figured on the basis of reserve estimates. In almost all cases, we were helped by industry insiders who shared their expertise.\n\nIn attributing wealth to a certain person, our basic criterion was whether that person controls it. In some cases, like John Norris and Lennox International, that meant a controlling family member got credit for the wealth of his family. In other cases—mostly older members of the Texas 100 who have begun planning their estates—it meant crediting wealth to the creator of the fortune. Without such a provision, Trammell Crow probably wouldn’t be on the Texas 100—his children would. That wouldn’t make sense.\n\nResearch breakthroughs helped immensely in refining our estimates. Bryan’s Don Adam, a much wilier businessman than we knew last year, moves from $100 million to $160 million. Dallas developer Mack Pogue, meanwhile, falls from $200 million to $140 million; we were able to get a clearer picture of Pogue’s equity this year. For many of the Texas 100, we discovered previously unknown assets. Because of new evidence, we were less conservative in valuing some companies, and in other cases, we lowered the values. As always, fickle market values changed many estimates. Of the 79 returning Texas 100 members, 40 rank higher on the list. Another 10 are lower. And as for the other 29 returnees, we found no evidence to change their estimates at all.\n\nSo we present this year’s Texas 100. Fittingly, H. Ross Perot again sits at the top of the heap. Perot is sixty years old, male, white, a native Texan, and self-made—a veritable poster child for the Texas 100. The new entries represent a whopping 21 percent turnover from last year, a huge change given the elite nature of the group. Continued research will undoubtedly reveal still more of Texas’ hidden rich. That, along with a recovering economy that will forge new fortunes and bolster existing ones, should continue to reshape the face of the Texas 100 in the coming years.\n\nHenry Ross Perot\n\n60, Dallas\n\nData Processing Systems\n\n$3 Billion\n\nWhy Him, Not Me One of the first to see the opportunity in selling data processing services, Perot founded Electronic Data Systems in 1962 with $1,000. In 1984 he sold out to General Motors for $2.5 billion. “People say it’s hard work, but a lot of people work this hard and don’t earn anything.”\n\nLife and Times Born in Texarkana; as a boy sold newspapers, broke horses for $1 apiece. Spent four years in Navy after attending U.S. Naval Academy. Worked as IBM computer salesman; quit to form EDS. Launched Perot Systems, an EDS competitor, in 1988. “It’s wonderful to be able to start all over again at my age with a blank sheet of paper and no old technology.”\n\nMinor Details Donated sixteen horses and saddles to New York City mounted police. Collects Norman Rockwell paintings, Frederic Remington sculpture. As General Motors director, rated dealerships’ services after visiting showrooms incognito. “An irritant. That’s what I am.”\n\nHarold Clark Simmons\n\n59, Dallas\n\nFinancier\n\n$1.7 Billion Up $100 million from 1989. His Keystone Consolidated stock has risen in value.\n\nWhy Him, Not Me Simmons started with one drugstore in 1960. He built a chain, sold out to Eckerd in 1973 for $50 million, and used the money and his financial acumen to propel himself into big-time investing.\n\nLife and Times Born in Alba; parents were schoolteachers. At 16, family moved to Austin and first home with indoor plumbing. As University of Texas student, lived with parents, who paid him an allowance. Got master’s in economics; lettered in basketball. “I never thought about money. I was too busy with basketball and dating.” Did stints with U.S. Civil Service, FDIC. Became bank junior loan officer at 25. “My bosses and I disagreed on who was smarter, so I left.”\n\nMinor Details Flies own jet; often leaves office early for tennis game. Arthritis sufferer; gave $41 million to UT’s Southwestern Medical Center. “It’s funny how the richer you get, the more popular you become.”\n\nPerry Richardson Bass\n\n75, Fort Worth\n\nInvestments\n\nSid Richardson Bass\n\n48, Fort Worth\n\nInvestments\n\nEdward Perry Bass\n\n44, Fort Worth\n\nInvestments\n\nRobert Muse Bass\n\n42, Fort Worth\n\nInvestments\n\nLee Marshall Bass\n\n34, Fort Worth\n\nInvestments\n\n$5.8 Billion Up $800 million from 1989. Disney stock has risen, and their estimate includes additional assets.\n\nWhy Them, Not Me They’re Basses, okay? Most heirs either do their own deals or hire a financial gunslinger to handle investments for them. The Basses are wildly successful both ways. For example, in 1984 they invested $400 million in Disney; now their Disney stock is worth $3.3 billion.\n\nLife and Times Father Perry Bass is from Wichita Falls; his sons were born and raised in Fort Worth. Perry was wildcatter Sid Richardson’s nephew; Richardson died in 1959 and left all five about $12 million total. Perry parlayed their inheritance into $50 million by 1969, when he retired to go sailing. All four brothers went to Yale; Bob and Sid earned MBA’s at Stanford, Lee at Wharton. Ed left Yale’s architecture graduate school for New Mexico to find himself and to sell Indian art. Now he is revitalizing parts of downtown Fort Worth. Sid’s hire, deal wizard Richard Rainwater (another Texas 100 member), helped manage the Bass fortune into billions.\n\nMinor Details Perry was once a Texas Parks and Wildlife chairman; captained Ted Turner’s American Eagle to World Open Racing Championship in 1972. Sid built Fort Worth’s mammoth City Center office towers; had wallet lightened by $200 million-plus courtesy divorce from Anne, then married an Iranian socialite. Bob is forging connections in Washington, D.C. Ed built Caravan of Dreams, a Fort Worth arts complex; has Australian ranch.\n\nMargaret Hunt Hill\n\n74, Dallas\n\nInheritance (Oil and Gas)\n\nHaroldson Lafayette Hunt III\n\n72, Dallas\n\nInheritance (Oil and Gas)\n\nCaroline Rose Hunt\n\n67, Dallas\n\nInheritance (Oil and Gas)\n\n$2.2 Billion\n\nWhy Them, Not Me H. L. Hunt would never have believed it, but the Hunt sisters have managed their money better than the Hunt brothers. Caroline’s forte has been luxury hotels operated by others; Margaret has stuck to the tried and true—oil and gas exploration.\n\nLife and Times All three are Arkansas-born offspring of Hunt and his first wife; were raised partly in Tyler. Caroline and Margaret went to Mary Baldwin College in Virginia. Caroline also went to UT. Margaret learned oil business at father’s side in 1930’s. Haroldson III “Hassie” inherited Dad’s magical knack for finding oil and discovered several oil deposits before mental problems surfaced in 1940’s. H.L. had him lobotomized, then institutionalized.\n\nMinor Details Margaret manages Hassie’s interests; built ritzy Garden of the Gods Club near Colorado Springs. Widowed. Shotgun-toting Hassie was her bodyguard during a kidnap threat in 1930’s. Caroline, twice divorced, is an antique buff; published The Compleat Pumpkin Eater cookbook. Bought Los Angeles’ Hotel Bel-Air in 1983 for $23 million and sold it for $110 million last year; still owns the Mansion in Dallas. All avoid publicity except “when it helps the business,” Caroline says.\n\nRobert Henry Dedman\n\n64, Dallas\n\nPrivate Clubs\n\n$830 Million Up $130 million from 1989. Dedman’s ClubCorp International was valued too conservatively last year.\n\nWhy Him, Not Me Dedman whipped the lackadaisical private-club industry—including country, city, and athletic clubs—into his own shrewdly run business empire. The 250 clubs of ClubCorp generate sales of $750 million a year.\n\nLife and Times Arkansas native; family was “too poor to paint and too proud to whitewash.” Got three degrees from UT, then studied law at Southern Methodist University. Moonlighted during law practice by opening Dallas’ Brookhaven Country Club in 1957. “I’ve always had two things going at once.”\n\nMinor Details Philosophy, poetry buff; favors Kipling, Longfellow: “It’s the distilled wisdom of the ages.” Will bequeath 45 percent of company to SMU. Says of his wealth, “I’m embarrassed by it.”\n\nJerry J. Moore\n\n62, Houston\n\nShopping Centers\n\n$770 Million Up $70 million from 1989. The bust has given Moore the perfect opportunity to expand.\n\nWhy Him, Not Me Moore works harder than you do. Rising at four—“that gives an advantage over the guys still asleep”—he labors eighteen hours a day, buying up centers, revamping them, getting just the right mix of tenants. Moore owns 180 shopping centers, 103 in Houston.\n\nLife and Times Born in Houston to poor Polish-Jewish immigrants. First job at age 12 was sweeping jewelry store. High school dropout; earned equivalency diploma in 1987. At 19 began successful fifteen-year career selling vacuum cleaners door to door; in 1950’s used savings to build houses, later strip shopping centers.\n\nMinor Details Began collecting cars at 15 with 1929 Model A Ford bought for $20; owns seven hundred cars. His blue-collar looks have caused him to be mistaken for gardener, baggage handler, golf caddy: At his Columbia Lakes resort, “A sweet little old lady asked me to get her a golf cart. I did, she gave me $5, and I took it.” In bed by ten each night; asleep “between ten-thirty and eleven, during Ted Koppel.”\n\nRoy Michael Huffington\n\n72, Houston\n\nOil and Gas\n\n$600 Million Up $150 million from 1989. Huffco’s sale this year put a true value on the company.\n\nWhy Him, Not Me On a tip, Huffington went wildcatting in the Indonesian jungle in the late sixties and turned up a huge gas pool. A partner with the Indonesian government for more than twenty years, he sold his company, Huffco, this year for some $800 million.\n\nLife and Times Tomball native; has a Harvard Ph.D. in geology. Worked as field geologist for several majors; left Humble Oil to wildcat in 1956. “It’s not work. It’s a lot of fun.”\n\nMinor Details Good buddies with George Bush; ambassador-designate to Austria. Spent spring taking crash courses in diplomacy and German through State Department. His blocks of downtown Houston real estate were part of Huffco sale. Sold out because his two children had no interest in running the company: “This is the sad part of knowing you can’t live forever.”\n\nGeorge Phydias Mitchell\n\n71, Houston\n\nOil and Gas\n\n$590 Million Up $65 million from 1989. Mitchell Energy and Development stock has risen.\n\nWhy Him, Not Me Following his instincts and a tip from a bookie, wildcatter Mitchell drilled in North Texas and in 1952 hit the huge Boonsville gas field. “I admonish my people to keep an eye out for outside deals. It’s worth the trouble.”\n\nLife and Times Galveston-born; Greek father was once a goatherd. Bused tables and sold stationery to pay way through Texas A&M. Petroleum engineering degree led to job as Amoco geologist; did World War II stint with Army Corps of Engineers. In 1946 formed Mitchell Energy and Development with brother Johnny (now retired).

Subscribes to a Boston newspaper to keep up with his beloved Red Sox.\n\nFred Trammell Crow\n\n76, Dallas\n\nReal Estate\n\n$500 Million\n\nWhy Him, Not Me Crow started building warehouses in the late 1940’s—and built and built and built. He is now the world’s largest real estate developer: “I don’t know anything that could be better than to be a builder.”\n\nLife and Times Grew up poor in Dallas, one of eight children; father was bookkeeper. “We all had to get with it to eat.” Worked his way through SMU night school as bank teller.

Grocery\n\n$480 Million Up $180 million from 1989. H.E.B. was valued too conservatively on last year’s Texas 100.\n\nWhy Him, Not Me In 1971 Butt had an MBA and a small family grocery chain to work with. H.E.B. is now ten times the size it was when he took over, and it’s the biggest chain in Texas.\n\nLife and Times Raised in Corpus Christi; bagged, stocked, and checked groceries from age 8 on.

New estimate includes additional assets.\n\nWhy Him, Not Me Jamail’s masterful lawyering skills and self-described ego so big that “this planet won’t hold it” earn out-of-this-world fees, including about $300 million from the famous Texaco-Pennzoil case.\n\nLife and Times Houston-born; father ran grocery store.

Joe Junior served on Dallas City Council (1979–83). Six Haggars work at company: “Don’t make it out like I did all this.”\n\nMichael Saul Dell\n\n25, Austin\n\nDell Computer Corporation\n\n$140 Million Up $40 million from 1989. Volatile Dell Computer stock is now on the upswing.\n\nWhy Him, Not Me Defying industry tradition, Dell started selling computers out of his college dorm room in 1983 and soon pioneered the mail-order market for computers; he could sell computers for lower prices than retailers could. “Always question the conventional wisdom.”\n\nLife and Times Born in Houston; father is an orthodontist, mother a stockbroker.

Thanks to their 1975 divorce, her estimated $15 million settlement included half of Clements’ interest in oil-giant Sedco. That stake grew to be worth more than $100 million when Schlumberger bought Sedco in 1984.\n\nLife and Times Born in Terrell. Was Phi Beta Phi and English major at UT, where she met Clements (who ultimately graduated from SMU). Married for 35 years; he filed for divorce, they split their property down the middle.

They sell disinfectants, cleansers, and the like directly to institutional buyers. A mundane way to make a living? Nonsense, says Irvin. “We love it.“\n\nLife and Times Father Milton Senior capitalized on the post–World War I desire for better sanitation and founded National Disinfectant Company in 1919. Brothers worked at the company as schoolboys. Irvin studied finance at UT, then at SMU; Lester (law) and Milton (business) went to UT. For most of our life our business has been our hobby,“ says Irvin.\n\nMinor Details Father’s death by heart attack in 1946 jolted brothers into reality; they’ve been co-managers of NCH ever since. Irvin chaired Dallas Museum of Art. Lester, whose son has dyslexia, co-founded Dallas’ Winston School for learning-disabled children. Milton—“an old shoe,” says a friend—funds Dallas’ Special Care School for mentally impaired children. All jog, play tennis. Says Irvin: Let’s not get into any discussions about who’s the best.\n\nTycoons in Training\n\nHomegrown Texas companies are scattered throughout the Texas 100. Whataburger, Mary Kay Cosmetics—all are Texas institutions worth hundreds of millions of dollars each. They’re part of the landscape. But so is the Schlotzsky’s on the corner, the Blue Bell vanilla ice cream in the freezer, or the Kwik-Kopy store that makes copies for you. With luck, someday the owners of these companies may wind up among Texas’ elite rich. Who are the tycoons in training behind these smaller but no less familiar Texas-bred companies?\n\nIn Brenham, the only thing better than BLUE BELL CREAMERIES’ premium ice cream may be the company’s marketing campaign. Its factory is an ice-cream lover’s mecca (complete with free tours and a gift shop); its commercials drip with wholesomeness. Skillfully crafting a folksy aw-shucks image of the “little creamery in Brenham”—which is actually a mammoth automated plant—Blue Bell has sales of more than $150 million (almost all of it in Texas) and a customer loyalty that most food companies would kill for. For brothers Ed and Howard Kruse (the second generation of Kruses to run privately held Blue Bell) and the other 350 or so shareholders, the homespun company is worth big-time money—at least $140 million.\n\nIn Fort Worth, MRS. BAIRD’S BAKERIES sells the image of family goodness instead of small-town wholesomeness. But it works just the same: The privately held company has sales of some $150 million through its twelve bakeries scattered around Texas. Started in 1908 by Ninnie Baird, a widow who supported her eight children by baking bread, Mrs. Baird’s Bakeries is a corporate rarity. It is still family owned and operated: Eighteen Bairds work there. Mrs. Baird’s is worth around $50 million to the family.\n\nLongview’s Don Dissman and his wife, Delores, founded SCHLOTZSKY’s almost twenty years ago in Austin to be near their daughter, who was then a UT student. Delores’ sourdough-bread sandwich turned out to be a hit. The pair franchised their original Schlotzsky’s into more than one hundred sandwich shops before selling out to Austin developers John Wooley and Gary Bradley in 1981. Wooley, along with Bradley, got rich in Austin’s real estate boom of the late seventies and early eighties by developing the Rob Roy subdivision. He split with Bradley in 1984, taking Schlotzsky’s with him. Wooley has pushed Schlotzsky’s to 250 stores in 27 states. Its worth: some $15 to $20 million.\n\nBack in the fifties, Emmett McCoy ran his father’s Galveston roofing business and sold a few building supplies on the side. Then he had a revelation. “I woke up and realized I was getting 80 percent of my problems and 20 percent of my profit from the contracting business,” recalls McCoy. “So we dropped it the next day.” Thus MCCOY’S—now a five-state, 93-store building-supply chain with 1989 sales of nearly $250 million—was born. Run by McCoy and two sons, the chain is worth at least $80 million. McCoy moved the company from Galveston to San Marcos in 1972. Why? “If you want to know the truth,” he says, “it just seemed like a nice place to live.”\n\nFor the longest time, failure was the business partner of Houston KWIK-KOPY owner Frederick C. “Bud” Hadfield. Hadfield’s Rhode Island high school expelled him for fighting. He raised hogs and peddled eggs and sold newspapers—none of which succeeded. Taking a friend’s advice, Hadfield, by then a gruff merchant marine, turned to Dale Carnegie for help. With a Carnegie course in human relations under his belt in 1967, Hadfield set about franchising his small Houston printing shop into what is today the second-largest printing chain in the world. Kwik-Kopy boasts systemwide sales of $375 million through one thousand stores; Cypress, Texas, headquarters that resemble the Alamo; and a collegelike boot camp that trains franchisees. The copy-shop empire, owned by Hadfield and a host of employees and investors (including astronaut and Kwik-Kopy pitchman Alan Shepard), is worth some $20 million. “The main thing is not to be afraid to fail,” says Hadfield. “Failure gives a true appreciation of success.”\n\nGone but Not Forgotten\n\nOnce in a while a Texas 100 member will ask how to get off the list. Easy, we answer: Give your money away. Few choose that option. All told, 21 of last year’s Texas 100 didn’t make the cut this year.\n\nHouston’s Robert Parker debuted last year at $110 million. His case illustrates why true asset value can be so elusive. Depending on your point of view, Parker’s Guardian Savings and Loan could be worth anywhere from $70 million to upwards of $130 million. Parker argued for a low value: “If you want an S&L in Texas right now, all you have to do is raise your hand.” In the end, Guardian’s value was just too fuzzy to keep its owner among the Texas 100.\n\nWe removed Dallas real estate icon John Stemmons because his fortune is so splintered among his family and, at the age of 81, he is too far removed from active control of it. New information also caused us to drop Dallas heiress Mary Anne Cree. Her family fortune is shared not only with her own offspring but also with three generations of step-relatives.\n\nWe also dropped divorcée Anne Bass, King Ranch heir Helen Groves, broadcaster Joe Allbritton, and Hunt descendants Swanee Hunt and Helen Hunt Hendrix, not because of any downturn in fortunes. Though all five have substantial ties to Texas, none live in the state anymore.\n\nDeath took three members of last year’s Texas 100. Vivian Smith and Dickie Williamson succumbed to cancer. Dallas’ pioneering developer, Will Caruth, died by his own hand last May.\n\nFierce competition for a spot among the Texas 100 bumped ten members off the list. Their visible assets weren’t enough to keep pace with the minimum, which rose from $100 million to $120 million. They were Fort Worth horseman and glass mogul R. D. Hubbard, Humble Oil heir and George Bush pal Will Farish, King Ranch heirs Ida Clement and Katherine Yarborough, North Texas ranchers Bucky Wharton and Electra Biggs, silver expert Bunker Hunt, and newspaper heirs Ed Harte, Houston Harte, and Andrew Shelton.\n\nWeep not for the class of 1990 Texas 100 dropouts, though. Their combined worth still tops $3.4 billion.\n\nWhen Money Talked, We Listened\n\nWhen we sent a ten-question survey to the members of last year’s Texas 100 and a few of this year’s additions, we had no idea who would respond. Mary Kay Ash answered at length—on pink paper. H. L. Hunt’s daughter Swanee Hunt commended us for trying to deepen society’s understanding of the very wealthy, “rather than simply letting stereotypes prevail.” She wrote, “I appreciate that.”\n\nThe ten questions concerned everything from the nature and use of wealth to what advice the Texas 100 have for would-be moguls. In all, we got 23 responses. Predictably, none of the five Basses answered. Neither did H. Ross Perot or Harold Simmons, Texas’ two richest men. Normally press-averse Chris Bancroft, who owns a piece of Dow Jones and Company (a minority owner of Texas Monthly), admonished us not to “rake muck” by chronicling Texas wealth—and closed his letter by urging us to “kick the competition’s ass.”\n\nTwo questions dealt with the effects of great wealth. First, is it a burden? Many answered that the burden lies in deciding how best to give away money, or as the late Will Caruth put it, “to use it for the betterment of mankind.” Swanee Hunt, who runs a charity for the homeless, said that although she once saw her wealth as a “curse,” she now uses it as leverage to accomplish charitable goals. “It means my phone calls are returned the first time,” she wrote. Arthur Temple, Jr., heir to a timber fortune, gave the question a personal spin. His circumstances “made it difficult to feel the exhilaration of accomplishment,” he wrote. “If I had fallen on my face, everyone would have said, ‘Isn’t it awful how that young fellow failed to accomplish anything with all of his advantages?’ When I succeeded, many felt that anybody could have done so under the circumstances.”\n\nSecond, we asked a question they’ve all had to ask themselves: Should children get large inheritances? Many noted that parental influence, not money, is crucial. Mary Kay Ash took a different tack: “In watching my grandchildren I would say that it is better for them not to have all the niceties of life so available with no effort.” Heiress, rancher, and professional sculptress Electra Biggs chimed in, “It never hurts to have to earn money on one’s own. The first check I received for sculpture was the most important of all.”\n\nWe asked the Texas 100 what regrets they had. Oilman Duke Rudman regretted not fighting anti-Semitism more vigorously during World War II. Trammell Crow noted that “could I go back and do so, I would work harder and study more.” Temple wished he had finished college and wondered “if I could have done a great deal more had I understood that the knowledge of the ages was presented to me at the University of Texas.” Will Caruth had the most poignant answer. The Dallas legend scribbled in his shaky hand, “Better physical health.” Two months after writing that, the 78-year-old Caruth, wheelchair-bound and suffering from emphysema and other ills, shot and killed himself.\n\nWhen we asked Texas’ superrich whether wealthy people as a group did enough to help the underprivileged, some took the hard line. “There is work for everyone who will work,” wrote Midland oilman Carlton Beal. “Too many freeloaders are running America into an economic morass.” Crew-cut conservative Bum Bright and others blamed government. “Our unrestrained welfare programs encourage people to be non-productive and, therefore, hungry and helpless,” Bright wrote. Others expressed hopelessness.\n\nActivist Swanee Hunt wrote, “Wealthy people . . . could probably make the biggest difference . . . through their political influence. . . . More hand-outs to ‘the poor’ aren’t the answer.” She added that societal changes are needed. Temple took a jab at the nouveau riche. “A great many wealthy yuppies,” he offered, “have not been taught what my parents taught me; i.e., ‘To Whom much is given, of them much is required.’ ” San Antonio car dealer Red McCombs wrote that the “minuscule efforts of many are unconscionable.”\n\nWe also asked what other profession they would have liked to pursue. Grocery mogul Charles Butt considered law and the foreign service in college. Developer Harold Farb, who used to sing onstage at his now-defunct Houston club, would have been an entertainer. “Teach history in a University,” responded lawyer Joe Jamail. B. K. Johnson once thought of going into politics. Mary Kay Ash and oilmen Roy Huffington and Tex Moncrief would have pursued medical careers.\n\nIn a lighter vein, we asked the Texas 100 to name a favorite entertainer. “John Wayne . . . my hero,” wrote Carlton Beal. Amateur funnyman Duke Rudman picked comedian Shecky Greene. Bum Bright and Roy Huffington named Bob Hope (or Lawrence Welk, Bright added). Liberace, answered Ash. Trammell Crow said he would like to see opera stars Maria Callas or Joan Sutherland: “For those minutes I would be transported to the beyond.” Chris Bancroft chose pop stars K. D. Lang and Lyle Lovett, explaining, “Both personify the best qualities of being human and accepting that.”\n\nThe Texas 100 seemed stunned by another question: If you were not allowed to work for a year, how would you spend the time? The group found the idea of not working nearly inconceivable. “In a box, six feet under the ground,” answered Austin computer mogul Bill Hayden. Rudman allowed that he would “go crazy” and feel “hopeless, useless, and inferior.” Bum Bright obviously considered the fate a prison sentence: “I would work in my workshop, fish, and plan how to achieve when my year was up.”\n\nAnd finally, What advice do the Texas 100 have for tycoon wannabees? Bill Hayden: “Burn your books and rely on instinct and common sense.” Charles Butt: “Focus on who you are as a person and what you offer those you propose to lead and motivate.” Will Caruth: “Don’t sit around wondering what to do with your life. Start something.” Bum Bright: “Do not be afraid to fail and if you do fail —try again and again and again.”\n\nFinally, Trammell Crow wrote, Rockne-like, “In the quiet of your solitude, close your eyes, bow your head, grit your teeth, clutch your fists, ache in your heart, vow and dedicate yourself to achieve, to achieve.”\n\nOn Deck\n\nA new member of this year’s Texas 100, Harold Farb was truly irritated to be in last year’s “Close, But No Cigar” section: He termed his listing among the 1989 runners-up negative. It’s heartening to know that some of that old Texas pride in being rich survived the bust. Here are six up-and-coming rich Texans:\n\nSYBIL HARRINGTON, AMARILLO. When oilman Don Harrington died in 1974, half of his estate went to a foundation and half went to his wife, Sybil. Best known as Texas’ queen of philanthropy, Sybil Harrington is believed to have her own fortune—outside the foundation—of at least $110 million.\n\nMICHAEL PRENTISS, DALLAS. A 46-year-old budding real estate mogul, Prentiss and his corporate partners own a passel of commercial properties around the country. His slice of Prentiss Properties’ equity could be $100 million.\n\nCLAYTON W. WILLIAMS, MIDLAND. Oilman, rancher, and possible governor-to-be, “Claytie” is out from under a $500 million debt load. He claims a net worth of about $100 million.\n\nMICHAEL D. MCKINNON, CORPUS CHRISTI. Back in 1975 Texas Monthly named the baby-faced McKinnon, then a senator from Corpus Christi, to its biennial list of the worst Texas legislators. McKinnon, now a 50-year-old broadcasting mogul, is having the last laugh. Net of debt, his four television stations, including KIII-TV in Corpus Christi, today are worth at least $80 million.\n\nB.J. PEVEHOUSE, MIDLAND. Billy Joe took his geology degree from Texas Tech in 1948 and plowed into the oil business. His piece of the firm he founded, Adobe Resources, combined with other energy assets total at least $80 million."
