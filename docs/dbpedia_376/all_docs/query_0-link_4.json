        "text": "HISTORY:\n\nThe most important square of Madrid and Spain, owes its name to the sun that was placed to adorn the entrance of the square, looking towards the east, in direction to the sunrise.\n\nImportant buildings were given prestige to this square since its inception, as were the Church of Buen Suceso, and San Felipe el Real, in the XVII century.\n\nIt was in 1520, and with the arrival of the revolution of the comuneros, who demanded to the king Carlos I of improvements to the situation of famine and discomfort of the society, when this square emerged as we know it. Since then, Puerta del Sol is a reference point for protests and demonstrations. In may 15, 2011, took place the manifestation of «Democracia Real Ya», in which citizens demanded a change in the political, social and economic themes in Spain.\n\nWhat is now known as the Town Hall building was originally La Casa de Correos, built by the french architect Jaime Marquet between 1766 and 1768.\n\nMilestones very representative of this popular square are the representation of the king Carlos III, the famous nameplate representing the kilometer zero of Spain, from which are born the six main roads in the country. Also, the poster of the wines of «Tio Pepe»-in the building of the old hotel Paris- or the sculpture of «El Oso y el Madroño».\n\nFrom its origin in the XV century, this square has been a reference point for people from Madrid, spanish or foreign."
