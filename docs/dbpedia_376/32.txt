The construction of the Royal Post Office of Puerta del Sol was the original idea of ​​Fernando VI, but at his death this project (commissioned by Ventura Rodríguez) was paralyzed and will not be resumed until Carlos III accedes to the throne.

Marquet will be chosen by the new king. More in line with his taste, he designed a classic French-style building, with a rectangular floor plan around two patios and three heights, with a horizontal facade built in red brick and stone.

The famous Puerta del Sol clock will be installed on the pediment in 1866, thanks to which and after the demolition of the Buen Suceso church and its bell tower, the people of Madrid were able to know the time again.

Already in the 1998th century the building began to have new uses, especially military and administrative (Ministry of the Interior, General Security Directorate during the Franco dictatorship). Since XNUMX it has been the seat of government for the Community.

It is the oldest preserved building of the Puerta del Sol, the nucleus of the social, political and commercial life of Madrid at the time and whose evolution we can follow thanks mainly to photography.

Although the Post Office is his most emblematic work, he also intervened in the real sites and especially in Aranjuez, where he was the Senior Architect.

Participate in two of the most characteristic elements of the site: the design of the radial layout of the streets and the gallery of the Casa de Oficios y Caballeros, next to the access to the palace.

It also builds the carriages and stables of the palace next to the Plaza de Abastos, and the palace of Isabel de Farnesio, today a cultural center.
