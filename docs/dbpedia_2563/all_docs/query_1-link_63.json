        "text": "I have just downloaded Audacity 3.2.0. I am running Windows 11.\n\nThe icon with the scissors, which did the same thing as ‘Delete’ from the keyboard, has now vanished.\n\nWhy has it been removed? It was a useful button to have and I cannot see what possessed anyone to think that removing it would be helpful.\n\nHi Scott; Please tell the devs that I consider myself to be not a novice, started programming back in 1967, although admittedly not using Windows then. Taught Windows professionally right through the 1990s. People say I am a keyboard junkie, but that’s not true. I believe in using the best tool (mouse or keyboard) for the job at hand, and not spending half my life switching between the two.\n\nJust this year I had reason to use the toolbar buttons cut/copy/paste in a variety of applications, the keyboard on this laptop crumbling through over-use. First a Shift key died, then a Ctrl key. Loss of keys forces one to the mouse until a keyboard can be shipped to the tip of the Bonavista Peninsula.\n\nFrom time memorial (1989) the mantra in all well-built Windows applications has been “Anything you can do with the keyboard you can do with the mouse, and anything you can do with the mouse you can do with the keyboard”. Windows is meant to be versatile and to suit all users.\n\nCheers, Chris\n\nHi Steve; I go along with all of these points, especially the right-click context menu. The “theory of life” tells us that the sequence is GoTo, Select, Action; clearly visible in the sense of someone copy-and-pasting. It follows that the mouse, having just Selected data must be at or near that selected data, and that a right-click involves no further movement of the relatively slow wrist/arm mechanism.\n\nThe Audacity Forum has - in the past month or so - begun popping up a menu about Cookies (“Got it! Indeed, Got It a month ago …”) which has aggravated me because I now have to scroll-down in order to access the Preview and Submit buttons.\n\nCheers, Chris\n\nGood news …\n\nyou may see these buttons coming back in a brand new toolbar which will be hidden by default but easily made visible through the View>Toolbars menu.\n\nI manged to persuade Martin Keary (aka Tantacrul) from Muse that this was an important requirement for some folk - so he reopened the Enhancement Request for this that I posted\n\nRestore the Cut, Copy and Paste buttons as a new (hidden by default) toolbar #3693\n\nhttps://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/3693\n\nThis is unlikely to be in any of the upcoming 3.2.x maintenance releases, but could well be on the cards for 3.3\n\nPeter\n\nWithout wishing to start a new thread when the title of the one I originally created does the same trick, how do I get the cutting function to work the way it did before the latest update?\n\nWhen I cut something from a recording, or restart a recording, I don’t want to create a new audio file which I must then manually drag back to the piece before it. How do I make the latest version work the way it used to, so cutting a short piece out still leaves me with one single audio recording?\n\nBy the way, why did you mess with it in the first place?"
