        "text": "PORTLAND Ore. (KPTV) - It’s the first of August, and also the first of several days in the 80s and 90s in the Portland region.\n\nFor some, like Todd Jarnagin and his 8-year-old son Thomas, this meant a trip to Peninsula Outdoor Pool in North Portland.\n\nThomas said he loved cooling off in the pool and was learning all sorts of moves in his swimming lessons.\n\n“I sit in the shade and let him come over and sit on me, and I stay nice and cool that way,” his dad Todd chuckled.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nIt was the first time down the slide and playing pool basketball for others as well, like Margot Hackman and her 7-year-old daughter.\n\n“I’m off with my daughter over the summer because I’m a teacher, so just trying to figure out how to keep us entertained and not going crazy,” Hackman said. “She gets a lot of enjoyment out of it and it wears her out, she’ll sleep better tonight.”\n\nMeanwhile, at the nearby Columbia Edgewater Country Club, competitors in the LPGA Classic were making a different kind of splash underneath hats, umbrellas, and layers of sunscreen.\n\nAmelia Lewis traveled all the way from Jacksonville, Florida for her 14th year in the tournament, and she knows a thing or two about swinging in the heat.\n\n“The trees are beautiful out here, the scenery is amazing. Normally the weather is great, it’s a little hot today,” she said. “I have a sun umbrella that I carry so I’m always in shade, and drink a ton of water.”\n\nWard Takamaya traveled all the way from Hawaii, enduring the weather to watch his daughter play.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n“My daughter has a pretty good game, and we really love watching her,” he said. “I got a floppy hat, that really helps, but especially out on the course it’s going from tree to tree, trying to find all the shade, trying to stay hydrated.”\n\nWith the heat sticking around for the four-day event, and throughout the week, places like the pool and splash pads will likely stay packed.\n\n“It’s essential for cooling off, I’m imagining a lot of people here don’t have AC,” Hackman said. “It’s essential to lower your body temperature,”\n\nPortland Parks and Rec tells us that while pools are excellent places to cool off, not everyone can swim and they do have capacity limits.\n\nThey recommend visiting splash pads or fountains in your local parks, which are open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. through Labor Day weekend.\n\nYou can see the locations below:\n\nColonel Summers Park - SE 17th Avenue and Taylor Street\n\nColumbia Park and Annex - N Lombard Street and Woolsey Avenue\n\nDawson Park - N Stanton Street and Williams Avenue\n\nEarl Boyles Park - east of SE 107th Avenue and Francis Street\n\nElizabeth Caruthers Park - 3508 SW Moody Avenue\n\nErrol Heights Park - SE 45th Avenue and Tenino Drive\n\nEssex Park - SE 79th Avenue and Center Street\n\nFarragut Park - N Kerby Avenue and Farragut Street\n\nFernhill Park - NE 37th Avenue and Ainsworth Street\n\nGateway Discovery Park - 10520 NE Halsey Street\n\nIrving Park - NE 7th Avenue and Fremont Street\n\nKenton Park - 8417 N Brandon Avenue\n\nKhunamokwst Park - 5200 NE Alberta Street\n\nNorthgate Park - N Geneva Avenue and Fessenden Street\n\nPeninsula Park - 700 N Rosa Parks Way\n\nPier Park - N Lombard Street and Bruce Avenue\n\nRaymond Park - SE 118th Avenue and Raymond Street\n\nSpring Garden Park - 3332 SW Spring Garden Street\n\nWoodlawn Park - NE 13th Avenue and Dekum Street"
