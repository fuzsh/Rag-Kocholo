        "meta_description": "Slow down and take your next right turn just after the traffic light into the rest stop.  That's just after the intersection at Cunningham street. \r\n\r\nPull into a parking space for a few minutes as I want to tell you about the Hotel Del Monte built in 1880. \r\n\r\nThe story of the del monte will take about 4 and a half minutes.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge chapter in the Monterey story as it was the beginning of the Monterey area as a tourist destination. Unfortunately, the Del Monte is now in the secure U.S. Naval Post graduate school, so you can't go in and see it.  But, if you stop for a minute at this rest stop you can get a glimpse of several of the buildings from here. You can recognize the main hotel buildings by their slanted peak roofs, they stand out from the other buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Hotel Del Monte was built by Southern Pacific railroad magnate, Charles Crocker with the idea of making it the greatest resort in the world. It was state of the art, with phones in every room and indoor plumbing. Unheard of at that time. It was 126 acres of heated swimming pools, botanical gardens and even a large racetrack that began with horses, but, quickly became a car race track. That racetrack is now the Monterey Pines Golf Course, just a few blocks south of here, to your right. \r\n\r\nThe Hotel Del Monte was the playground of the rich and famous. When it opened, some 3,000 requests for reservations were turned down in the first six weeks. Famous actors, kings and queens from around the world and U.S. Presidents from Rutherford B. Hayes to Theodore Roosevelt stayed at the del Monte. \r\n\r\nCrocker soon added another 7,000 acres when he took on the Del Monte Forest and conceived of the 17 Mile drive into Pebble Beach, which, in those days, started right here. President Roosevelt took the drive on horseback. But, most took the 6-8 horse buggies. The del Monte had 50 buggies on site!  And, in those days, by the way, it was the 18 mile drive with a turn around at the Lone Cypress, which was the halfway point. It was there the guests laid out a picnic before the drive back to the hotel. Today, that Lone Cypress is the famous logo of the Pebble Beach Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, the Southern Pacific brought a train to Monterey, specifically for residents of the Hotel Del Monte. The train was first called the Daisy, then later, the Del Monte Express and came right by where you are sitting right now as it made its way to the Monterey station a few blocks from here.\r\n\r\nBy way, the Del Monte food brand you may buy today started here when a bay area food company put the Del Monte hotel label on gourmet coffee which they supplied to the hotel. And Cannery Row, which we’ll visit in a few minutes, is where it is today because of the sardine fishermen letting their fish wastes drift into the heated salt water pools of the hotel. Crocker made them move their sardine food processing further up the coast away from the hotel so that’s why Cannery Row is where it is today. \r\n\r\nIn Word War II the army, then the navy took over the Hotel Del Monte and turned it into barracks. Finally, by an act of Congress, the navy moved its entire Post Graduate School from Annapolis to the grounds of the Del Monte and constructed other buildings. It is now one of the finest military schools in the world. The Navy Post Graduate School you are looking at has included many famous military and government leaders and includes over 30 students who became U.S. astronauts including people like Eugene Cernan, the 11th person to walk on the moon, and Edgar Mitchell, the pilot of Apollo 14, who with Alan Shepherd, spent a record 33 hours on the surface of the moon.\r\n\r\nWe are restricted from going in to the Naval Post Graduate School, but if you want to get out of your car and walk to your right you will see glimpses of the Hotel Del Monte, and the Naval school.\r\n\r\nWe’ll get another look at the hotel when we visit the lower Presidio. By the way, the stories of the del Monte are many and fascinating. If you want to know more, there is a huge historical collection in the California Room of the Monterey Public library which we will pass by later in this tour. \r\n\r\nNow, when you are ready to proceed, just turn back out on to Del Monte Boulevard and turn right. We have more great things to see ahead.",
