        "text": "Our order was delayed by the COVID19 factory closure, but Bill and Joe kept updated on it. Your delivery team was on-time and professional for both haul-away and installation, and Oscar even returned the same afternoon to install an adapter for our electrical connection. We love our new Hotsprings SX, and your level of customer service is extremely rare these days. Great job!\n\n—The Huffs in Oak Hills\n\n\"Spas by the Bay has our highest recommendation. My wife and I recently moved to the Monterey area and we wanted a quality spa for our new home. Excellent product, excellent and knowledgeable people to work with. If you are looking for a quality spa, go with Spas by the Bay.\"\n\n—John O. in Pebble Beach\n\n\"I just set up my 13 foot Endless Pool Swim Spa. I am absolutely thrilled with the product! Spas by The Bay did an incredible job, from my first visit to familiarize myself with their products to the delivery and installation of my spa. Even after the pool was in place and my electrician had finished adding the necessary equipment, Spas by The Bay continued to offer outstanding service. I definitely recommend using Spas by The Bay if you are considering a new spa. Thanks Guys!!\"\n\n—Debbie H. in Carmel Valley\n\n\"I am really happy with the service I have received from Spas by the Bay. I don't write a lot of reviews, but they just came out to fix something that I screwed up on and didn't charge me. YAY!! (When's the last time that happened??) I would highly recommend Spas by the Bay. The Salt Water System is really nice, too! The Jetsetter is a great smaller tub that is big enough for 3 people but doesn't use too much electricity or water. I love it! It is awesome!!\"\n\n—Karen T. in Moss Landing\n\n\"I purchased my HotSprings spa from Spas By the Bay in November 2014, and the owner, Bill Sullivan, was the one who helped me in the showroom. I wanted to let others know that this company provides very good customer service. Whenever there were problems with my spa, and there have been several minor/moderate issues, they have come to fix it quickly and professionally. And so far, all repairs have been under warranty. Knowing now what's involved in owning and maintaining a spa, I'm glad that I didn't take the \"cheap\" route and buy a Costco spa or hot tub. I'm sure that I'll save money in the long run.\"\n\n—Mike M. in Monterey\n\nI bought my hot tub 3 years ago from Spas by the Bay after several months of comparing products and pricing. Not only did Bill Sullivan sell me a great tub at fair price, but whenever I've had technical questions or needed any troubleshooting he's always been very helpful and prompt . He's a great guy to work with.\n\n—Pete J. in Carmel"
