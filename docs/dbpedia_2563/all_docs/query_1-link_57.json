        "text": "B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times. By B.DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.\n\nThe Eastern Shore is a land for all seasons. But none quite compares with early fall, that wonderfully ambivalent time of fullness and decline, when the sea trout are still biting, doves are beginning to fly, a few fat tomatoes still cling to the vine, and the night air, although still alive with the chirp of crickets, provides excuse enough for the season's first wood fire. And this is the bargain season, the two-for-one time.\n\nAlthough it is classified geographically as a peninsula, caught between the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay and made up of parts of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, in most respects the Eastern Shore is an island, a place unto itself.\n\nThe lay of the land, the language of the people, their food, their homes, their pursuits -these things tend to have a certain distinctiveness not found on the more homogenized mainland lying to the west across the broad marshes and waters of the Chesapeake.\n\nAs a result, Eastern Shoremen, whether they live on the banks of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal at the peninsula's northern terminus, or 200 miles down Route 13 at Cape Charles, the southern terminus, tend to have the proud mien and independent mentality of islanders, something residents of the Maryland section make clear with their bumper stickers that proclaim: ''I Don't Give a Damn for the Whole State of Maryland, I'm from the Eastern Shore.''\n\nThis independent streak sometimes rubs mainlanders the wrong way, and more than one has suggested that perhaps the Delmarva Peninsula should be cut loose from the rest of the United States and set adrift in the Atlantic, a suggestion that Eastern Shoremen greet with ambivalence rather than outright outrage. In fact, Shoremen in the Maryland Legislature periodically demand, not entirely with tongue in cheek, that the Shore be given special status, even statehood.\n\nIf all this suggests something of a Deep South mentality on the Shore, such a conclusion is not far from the mark. The Virginia part of the peninsula qualifies without question as southern, the Old Dominion having sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War. But the Maryland and Delaware sections also are notably southern in many respects, from the plantation graciousness of their waterfront estates to the widespread use of ''you-all'' in conversation and the good old boys hanging around the crossroads store or service station.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
