        "text": "Georgia O’Keeffe (American, 1887–1986), Chama River, 1957–63, gelatin silver print, Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, Santa Fe, 2006.6.1313\n\n14 3/4 × 11 3/4 × 1 3/8 in. (37.5 × 29.8 × 3.5 cm)\n\nVerbal Description\n\nHello, my name is Eric Le Roy, the museum’s associate director of docent learning. I will be reading the verbal description of Chama River in Georgia O’Keeffe, Photographer.\n\nThe photograph, Chama River, was created between 1957 and 1963. It is a gelatin silver print. It was taken by Georgia O’Keeffe, an American artist who lived from 1887 to 1986. It is in the collection of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. The acquisition number is 2006.6.1313\n\nTitled Chama River, this black-and-white portrait-oriented photograph measures 14 and three-quarter inches by 11 and three-quarter inches. Moving from the foreground to the background, the viewer first encounters a rocky cliff covered with sparse grass overlooking the vast expanse of the river that encompasses the entirety of the midground of the photo. The river appears to split, with one arm moving out of view in the left foreground and the other extending into the background, curving sharply to the left three-quarters down from the top of the photo. This division creates a peninsula-like shape on the left side of the picture. In the background, foliage-covered mesas of varying heights complete the scene. A slice of gray sky extends across the top of the image.\n\nLabel Text\n\nHello, my name is Eric Le Roy, the museum’s associate director of docent learning. I will be reading the label for Chama River in Georgia O’Keeffe, Photographer.\n\nThe photograph, Chama River, was created between 1957 and 1963. It is a gelatin silver print. It was taken by Georgia O’Keeffe, an American artist who lived from 1887 to 1986. It is in the collection of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. The acquisition number is 2006.6.1313\n\nLocated between O’Keeffe’s Abiquiú home and Ghost Ranch, this south-facing elevation overlooks the Chama River as it makes a tight bend. O’Keeffe photographed the view in a variety of seasons, capturing the changing depth of the rushing water, the density of foliage, and the deepness of shadows throughout the year."
