        "text": "JL AUDIO®\n\nThe best on-water sound experience imaginable awaits you. All Nautique models include the JL Audio MM100s head unit that delivers crisp and clear sound to the JL Audio speakers on board, all of which are powered by JL Audio amplifiers. Each element of our comprehensive JL Audio stereo system has been designed to perform seamlessly with one another to produce the best experience possible. With a great standard package for each boat, there are also upgraded options depending on the boat model that can include JL Audio subwoofers, tower speakers, additional zone control and our exclusive JL WaveFront™ and WakeSub™ technology!\n\n5-YEAR, 1K HOUR WARRANTY\n\nThere’s a higher level of comfort when you purchase a new Nautique thanks to our 5-Year Transferable Warranty*. Over the course of our 95-year history we have built a reputation on creating trust and loyalty with our owners by always having their back. We want you to have the best ownership experience possible, that’s why we go through great lengths to make certain you are enjoying your Nautique precisely the way it was designed!\n\n*Nautique warrants to the original owner or user, that each new 2020 Nautique boat, as originally manufactured by Nautique, shall under normal authorized use be free of defect in material and workmanship for a period of five (5) years or 1,000 hours from the date of delivery (whichever comes first). This warranty applies to factory-installed components including boat parts, options or other components not manufactured by Nautique Boat Company and is transferable one-time only to the second owner.\n\nTHOUGHTFUL DESIGN\n\nOur team of designers are fanatics about providing you with the best possible on-water experience. When you step aboard a Nautique, decisions have been made at every turn so that the ergonomics, aesthetics and functionality of each component are working in your favor. All this, so that fun-filled days on the water for your friends and family are easily within reach.\n\nTHE SUM OF HIGH-QUALITY PARTS\n\nWhen sourcing the components that go into each Nautique, we take pride in the search. We locate and incorporate only the most durable, high-quality and luxurious materials available so that your Nautique will withstand the elements and provide years of enjoyment. Every model that rolls off our factory floor includes our dedication to quality so your family can enjoy it well into the future!\n\nINTEGRATED STRINGER SYSTEM"
