        "text": "Since day one I wanted to label my MFC, but unfortunately I could never wrap my head around how I would layout my presets, IA-switches and scenes. Therefore I always thought it was rather stupid to buy a pre-made label set, as I wasn't sure whether I'd use all of them. The labelmakers on this forum provide excellent quality and design for a more than honest price, but I'm more of a DIY kind of guy (see my homemade pedalboard, patchbay,...)\n\nI'd like to share with you the process of making my own labels. At the moment I'm still designing in photoshop and waiting for some supplies. So the labels are far from finished, so this thread will be updated regularly.\n\nList of materials used/ordered\n\n- Matte Photopaper\n\n- Magnetic paper with self-adhesive side for attaching the labels\n\n- Lamination machine\n\n- Scissors\n\n- Inkjet Printer\n\n- Hobby Knife\n\n- Ridiculous amounts of patience... time will tell whether I have it\n\nSTEP 1: Designing the labels\n\nFirst of all I need to admit that I'm absolutely not good in Photoshop, so my designs may not be that fancy as the labels you can buy. The designs aren't final and need further tweaking, so all suggestions are more than welcome.\n\nHere's a picture of some labels I designed and printed out on regular paper. The picture may not be that clear, but I didn't upload a picture from photoshop as I used the layout of existing pedals... And I won't share them without permission!\n\nAs you can see I made three labels based on the Eventide pedals (Timefactor, Pitchfactor and Space). I also tried to make a Strymon Timeline like label for another delay. The compressor is based on the yellow Diamond Compressor (I added the diamond). The Chorus is based on the H20 and the auto-wah has a modified picture of a Crybaby. The Phaser, Flanger and Tubescreamer I have build from scratch in Photoshop, but I think it's clear on what pedals they are based. The Preset 1 label has a 6505 and a Bogner Cab on it, as this is my go-to setup in the Axe-Fx.\n\nOnce the labels are finished, I will post high quality pictures of the labels!\n\nHi Objector. Being a DYIer myself......I have already been down this road and others. I found that the magnetic field of the printer paper magnetic sheets was not strong enough to cling well to my MFC. When I would carry my MFC to a gig half of the labels would fall off in the carry bag and they were easy to knock out of position with my clumsy toe tappin'. Not trying to rain on your parade, but wanted to point out the caveats I found for you to consider (if you haven't already), before you go all in with your chips. I found the 3/32\" thick magnet sheet/strip material was the minimum thickness to stay put well.\n\nHi Objector. Being a DYIer myself......I have already been down this road and others.

The Magnetic paper I have is 0,85mm thick, so I hope it will be strong enough. It feels like it could, but only time will tell once the sheet has been cut to size. The fact that they go around the footswitch and and have an inlet at for the LED, may make it a little less prone to change position.\n\nTime will tell!"
