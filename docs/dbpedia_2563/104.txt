Taking a road trip through the Upper Peninsula will be a treasured memory with remarkable places to see, things to do and adventures to enjoy with your family, friends or on your own.

As you map your route, cross the magnificent Mackinac Bridge at least once. Take a ferry to Mackinac Island and immerse in centuries of history. Watch giant freighters ease by within inches of you. Stare into the bubbling, ethereal depths of Kitch-iti-kipi. Be enthralled by the stories of iron and copper miners, loggers and sailors. Kayak miles of waterways and hike to astounding overlooks. Hurtle down white-knuckle mountain bike trails. Be spellbound by the sun rising and setting and the Northern Lights dancing into the night. Plan your road trip now.
