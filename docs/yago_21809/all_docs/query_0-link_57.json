        "text": "This research, “An Analytical Study of the Views on Meritorious and Demeritorious Deeds of Theravada Buddhism in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia” consisted of the following three objectives: (1) to study the views of meritorious and demeritorious deeds in Therav a da Buddhism, (2) to study the views of meritorious and demeritorious deeds of the Buddhist community in Kampong Cham province, (3) to analyze these views in the context of the Buddhist community at Kampong Cham province and as manifested through different ceremonies. This work was based on two phases: a documentary research and fieldwork. The documentary research aimed to study the views of Theravada Buddhist aspects pertaining to merits and demerits. The fieldwork phase aimed to study the concepts of Khmer people in Kampong Cham province by interviewing the target group and the findings presented with descriptive analysis. The result of the study clearly indicated that the Buddhist views on merits (punna) and demerits (pa...\n\nCambodia Buddhism in a dark age: Cambodian monks under Pol Pot By IAN HARRIS Honolulu: University of Hawai&#39;i Press, 2013. Pp. 242. Plates, Notes, Abbreviations and Glossary, Bibliography, Index. Ian Harris passed away in late December of 2014, just as I finished this review. His passing is a loss to Buddhist Studies, and especially to Cambodian Buddhist Studies. Harris&#39;s early training was in Buddhist studies; his research into the political aspects of Buddhism led him to realise the dearth of scholarly attention paid to Cambodian Buddhism, and specifically to the impact of the Khmer Rouge revolution on Cambodian Buddhist monks and institutions. This book focuses on that problematic. This book is an important contribution as a resource, collection, and chapter-by-chapter analysis of how Buddhist monks in Cambodia fared under Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) and their successor socialist regime, the People&#39;s Republic of Kampuchea. The highlights are the painstaking work of collection and narration, rather than a single sustained argument. Undoubtedly this is in part a result of the way in which the book relies on a vertiginous archive of documents of various sorts, from various perspectives, in addition to Harris&#39;s own interviews. To the extent that Harris makes an argument throughout the book, it is that &#39;some elements of Buddhist belief and practice were subsumed into the Khmer Rouge worldview&#39; (p. 139). The finest contributions in the book are those in which Harris sorts through a monumental amount of material to construct several narratives of how Buddhism and Buddhist monks fared before and after Democratic Kampuchea. Although much of this material has been available in other sources, it has been scattered, episodic, and largely in specialist documents, many of which are hard to obtain. As Harris notes in his final chapter, he hopes in part to aid the process of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal (Extraordinary Chambers of the Courts of Cambodia) through this effort. Harris&#39;s treatment is excellent, and these chapters will help readers understand the complex and diverse ways in which Cambodian Buddhist monks interacted with --and sometimes were--Cambodian communists. Chapter 3, where the book-length argument is first presented, is less successful. As noted earlier, Harris argues that there was a subsumption of Buddhist beliefs and practices into the Khmer Rouge worldview, but it is unclear what this subsumption means, or what Buddhism Harris refers to. If he means that the previously hegemonic worldview, ritual practices, and moral discourse influenced Khmer communism and its discourse, he makes a good case: certainly the Khmer Rouge leadership employed (a distinctly Buddhist discursive tactic of) redefining words with moral values so that true morality was re-coded to mean the new moral and practical norms of Democratic Kampuchea. …\n\nThe thesis, “An Analytical Study of the Concepts of Peace and Harmony in the Teachings of Samdech Preah Mahāghosananda in Cambodian Society, had three main objectives: (1) to study the life and works of Samdech Preah Mahāghosananda for peace and non-violence in Cambodia, (2) to study Samdech Mahāghosananda’s concepts of peace and harmony in Cambodia, (3) To analyze the concept of peace and harmony of Samdech Preah Mahaghosananda and its influence in Cambodian society. This research was based on two methods: documentary research and fieldwork. The documentary research aimed to study the life and work of Samdech Preah Mahāghosananda and his teachings on non-violence (ahiósa) by his Dhammayietra or the pilgrimage for peace and reconsolidation for the nation and the world, while fieldwork aimed to study the concepts of his prominent disciples and his genuine supporters by interviewing a few key informants. The findings were presented with the descriptive analysis. The result of the findings clearly indicated that Samdech Preah Mahā Ghosananda was the great Buddhist monk in Cambodia who devoted his whole life to seek peace and harmony for the Cambodian people and the world by absolutely adhering to the Ahiósa Dhamma or non-violence principle. It was clearly found that Cambodia and its people both monks and lay people obtain peace and happiness by following the method of Samdech Ghosananda. It was said that where was Ghosananda, there was no war, no violence, there was presented only cool peaceful mind and authentic well-being only because Samdech Ghosananda was the great political leader of ahimsa as Mahatma Gandhi. The best technique to find peace and harmony of Samdech was Dhammayietra, preaching the simple message of non-violence with its benefits, sharing loving-kindness and compassion, keeping noble silence to be in peace with oneself and be generous to others. Finally, the researcher would conclude from the findings that Samdech Preah Mahāghosananda was the accurate peaceful monk and the peacemaker for Cambodian people and the world. All of his disciples believed in him very faithfully and still regard him as a small Buddha or a spiritual angel in their hearts forever."
