        "text": "On August 3, 2022 local time, Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni met with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Phnom Penh.\n\nSihamoni asked Wang Yi to convey Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk's and his own cordial greetings and âmiss youâ sentiment to President Xi Jinping and his wife. Sihamoni thanked the Chinese government and people for providing precious long-term assistance for Cambodiaâs national development, and thanked the Chinese side for the staunch support for its effort to bring the pandemic under control. He expressed the confidence that under the strong leadership of President Xi Jinping, China will make new and greater achievements going forward.\n\nSihamoni said the special relationship between Cambodia and China was forged and nurtured by the elder generations of leaders, and has now reached the highest level in history. Thanks to the effort of President Xi Jinping and Cambodian leaders, the two sides are actively building a Cambodia-China community with a shared future, and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation within the framework of the Belt of Road Initiative, delivering tangible benefits to the people of the two countries. Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk and I have always had friendly feelings towards China, seeing China as the second home and the most sincere friend, and believing that no force can undermine the Cambodia-China friendship. The Cambodian side fully agrees with and supports the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative put forward by President Xi Jinping. Sihamoni emphasized that Cambodia will continue to support the one-China principle and firmly stand with the Chinese side.\n\nWang Yi conveyed President Xi Jinping's cordial greetings to King Norodom Sihamoni and Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk. He noted that for more than half a century, China and Cambodia have respected and trusted each other, treated each other as equals, and pursued win-win cooperation, setting a good example of state-to-state relations. The friendship between the two countries remains as unbreakable as ever, not only bringing real benefits to the two peoples and becoming each otherâs most valuable asset, but also making China and Cambodia's contributions to international and regional peace and stability. Facts have proven that China is a country that champions sovereign equality, a friend in need, and a partner for common development. The Chinese side stands ready to work with the Cambodian side to carry forward the traditional friendship, and further progress the building of a community with a shared future with strategic significance,so as to inject greater vigor and vitality into the China-Cambodia friendship in the new era.\n\nWang Yi expressed appreciation forâ Cambodiaâs firmly commitment to the one-China principle, and emphasized that any words and deeds violating the one-China principle are a challenge to the international consensus and a damage to peace in the region and across the Taiwan Strait, and should be condemned by the international community.\n\nWang Yi said the Chinese side thinks highly of King Father Norodom Sihanouk's historical contributions to the forging and nurturing of China-Cambodia friendship, and will work with the Cambodian side to hold a series of commemorative events for the 100th anniversary of King Father Norodom Sihanouk's birthday this year, and carry forward the traditional friendship between the two countries. China will continue to provide support and assistance within its capacity for Cambodia's economic and social development in light of Cambodia's needs."
