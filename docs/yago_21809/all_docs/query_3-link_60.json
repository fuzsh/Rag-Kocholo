        "text": "For more than sixty years, Cambodia has been personified by Norodom Sihanouk. Throughout his life he has played roles as King, Prime Minister, Prince, Head of State for Life, Exile, and Prisoner. This documentary chronicles his remarkable life story, which is inextricably linked with the modern history of Cambodia. Using archival footage and contemporary interviews with Sihanouk's former colleagues and political opponents, eyewitnesses, journalists and historians tells the story of this controversial political leader whose country became the \"killing fields\" for one of the greatest human tragedies of the 20th century."
