My experiences in life have shaped me this way: I have survived two wars and severe repressive violence. Born in Cambodia, I left the country soon after the Vietnamese invasion in late 1978 and found myself in different refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border and inside Thailand. I left the last camp for Canada, my home base ever since. I recognize the difﬁculty of writing on the politics of peace and democracy promotion. In spite of certain shortcomings, my previous studies on intervention have strong empirical support. I published a book in 1997 (Conﬂict Neutralization in the Cambodia War: From Battleﬁeld to Ballot-box) contending that peace will not come unless we deal with security issues head on. Political compromise through negotiation has the best potential to build peace and promote democracy. Another book (Foreign Intervention and Regime Change in Cambodia: Towards Democracy?), published in 2000, warns of the dangers of hegemonic power politics in weak states. This book further reveals the limits of democracy assistance. Cambodia serves as the main case study, and I explain the rationale behind this case selection in Chapter 3. The country has now achieved basic negative peace. The donor community and the Cambodian Government deserve credit for this commendable achievement. Now they must do more to help develop the economy, even though economic growth alone will not help consolidate democracy in post-war societies such as Cambodia. I still humbly disagree with both certain academic ‘prophets’ of doom, who insist that international donors have done Cambodia more harm than good or accomplished nothing, and those who advocate violence as a means to build democracy. I remain somewhat optimistic about the future of democracy in Cambodia, having learned that democracy in some East-Asian countries now experiences some consolidation. Still, I do not accept any contention that democratic regime consolidation has become an easy, linear process that stays irreversible forever. I have disagreed with the well-known conventional wisdom put so eloquently by US Vice President Dick Cheney: ‘We don’t negotiate with evil; we defeat it.’ US President George W. Bush’s famous ultimatum to\n\nviii\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements ix\n\nthe nations of the world – ‘Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists’ – further reveals an utter lack of certain realist wisdom, which often advocates diplomacy and accommodation. As a political scientist, I seek ﬁrst and foremost to advance a theory that helps explain political developments and make predictions, rather than implore or ‘prosecute’ anyone. So let me state where I stand on theoretical ground: A paciﬁst at heart (shaped by my Christian faith), I have developed a perspective based on insights from the literature in Comparative Politics and International Relations (most notably Kantianism, constructivism, and realism). All this sounds somewhat contradictory, but I seek to strike an eclectic balance by taking into account what I see as institutional and structural challenges to democratic regime consolidation. Based on the Cambodia case and other case studies, I propose a distinct theoretical perspective called ‘complex realist institutionalism’, which I believe can help us capture well the great difﬁculties of democracy building in post-war societies. One last word of caution regarding the target audience: This book uses Cambodia as the main case study and may thus prove useful to those interested in its recent political development and the role of international democracy assistance to this country. Those who have little interest in Cambodia may also ﬁnd the book of interest because of its attempt to advance ‘complex realist institutionalism’. Let me now express a word of gratitude to those who lent me a helping hand over the years – although I left out many names for security reasons. First and foremost, I would like to convey my debt of gratitude to the Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael in The Hague (The Netherlands), which funded an initial research project assessing the impact of international assistance on democratic institution building in Cambodia, upon which I developed this study. Both Luc van de Goor and Jeroen de Zeeuw earned my respect for their steadfast support for this project. Other scholars made critical but extremely helpful comments, and I would like to thank them. They include the anonymous reviewers, Professor Peter Leuprecht of the Montreal Institute of International Studies (also Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN for human rights in Cambodia from 2000 to 2005), Dr Thomas Carothers of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Professor William Case of City University of Hong Kong, Professor William B. Frolic of York University, Simon Springer of the University of British Columbia, and several others who wished to remain unidentiﬁed. Both William Wood\n\nx Preface and Acknowledgements\n\nand Shawn Finn also offered very useful editorial comments on the ﬁnal draft of the book manuscript. I also would like to thank the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace (CICP) based in Phnom Penh and ﬁve of its young researchers for providing me with helpful assistance during the ﬁrst few months of an early project. My special thanks also go to Sok Hach, Executive Director of the Economic Institute of Cambodia and several members of his research team, particularly Tuy Chakriya, for having offered me ofﬁce space and moral support during my ﬁeldwork in Cambodia. Moreover, I wish to thank Sophia University for having granted me a recent sabbatical leave that allowed me to complete the book, and I pay tribute to my colleagues, particularly those in the Faculty of Liberal Arts, for their friendship and encouragement. Last but not least, I owe my wife Chola and two wonderful daughters – Sophia and Josephine – the biggest debt of gratitude: because of their love for me and the love I have for them, I always ﬁnd enough strength to carry on my work. I alone take full responsibility for any sins of omission and commission.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe end of the Cold War in the early 1990s gave rise to peacebuilding activities in war-torn societies in various regions of the world. The number of interstate conﬂicts then continued to decline noticeably, but that of intrastate ones rose and posed a growing threat to international, national, and human security.1 Academic literature in this ﬁeld of study became a growth industry in the 1990s, even though the concept of peacebuilding had emerged long before this period. In 1966, the functionalist theorist David Mitrany used the term ‘peacebuilding’, which seems to imply that peace prevails when ‘our common society’ conquers ‘poverty’, ‘disease’, and ‘ignorance’.2 Ten years later, the leading paciﬁst Johan Galtung, known for his concept of positive peace, employed the same term (distinct from peacemaking and peacekeeping) as a strategy to abolish structural violence.3 It took the United Nations 16 more years to popularize the concept, when the then – UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali adopted it in 1992.4 Peacebuilding seems to hold the greatest potential, largely because other approaches to security can only offer ‘band-aid’ solutions to deep root-causes of conﬂict. Throughout the 1990s, humanitarian intervention held great promise when states, particularly the United States and its NATO allies, showed their willingness to save people in strange places. The logic of international solidarity emerged. But the 2000s saw no effective humanitarian interventions; when undertaken, they proved either ineffective 5 or controversial. 6 Economic sanctions (including smart ones), which increased in number in the 1990s,7 have their limits,8 and have often proved counter-productive when put in the context of human security. Civilians suffered more from sanctions than their leaders. Peacekeeping does not always succeed. Even when it works, peacekeeping offers no lasting solutions to the problem of war. 1\n\n2 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nBy saying that peacebuilding holds the greatest potential, I do not suggest that this approach has thus far produced only success stories. Critics of peacebuilding have much to say about the limits of neoliberal/Kantian internationalism, most notably in the area of intervention.9 Still, if successful, peacebuilding can best promote human, national, and international security. The question remains: At what point does peace become consolidated or sustainable and how can we achieve this objective? Some scholars believe peace gets consolidated when warring actors within a given society develop, as Elizabeth Cousens puts it, ‘the capacity to manage conﬂict without violence’.10 Her view rests on this premise: preventing renewed hostilities or successful conﬂict management requires ‘effective mechanisms [social, political, and legal] by which a polity can resolve its rival claims, grievances, and competition over common resources’.11 The ‘elements of positive peace that hold the most promise for peacebuilding – effective public institutions, meaningful political inclusion, norms of fairness and access, legal protection for groups and individuals, and so on – are precisely those that create mechanisms for addressing grievances and resolving conﬂict.’12 But for her, mechanisms for conﬂict management in post-war societies need not always take a liberal democratic form. The academic literature shows no lack of criticism leveled against liberal democracy and the failure of efforts to promote it in war-torn societies. While some scholars view this type of effort as futile (having no effect on dictatorial systems), others see it as dangerous. Former Prime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong once sternly warned that Western-style democracy ‘could bring the country down’.13 The external imposition of liberal democracy on war-torn societies, others argue, can exacerbate existing violent conﬂicts or bring about further social and political disorder.14 But democracy from the liberal tradition underpins this study, which does not regard it as impeccable. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s well-known point made in 1947 still rings true today: ‘No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.’ Still far from perfect, liberal democracy proves itself a much better system of government than non-democratic ones; it helps promote human freedom and interests.15 Empirical studies further show that, while semi-democracy may provide some stability16 and that the autocratic models of economic\n\nIntroduction 3\n\ndevelopment may bring temporary successes, democracy does not necessarily impede economic development and may provide better conditions for sustainable economic development than dictatorship can.17 As Amartya Sen has pointed out: ‘no substantial famine has ever occurred in any country with a democratic form of government and a relatively free press.’18 According to a study based on 138 countries over the period 1950–1990, ‘democracies showed markedly lower infant mortality rates than dictatorships’ and outperformed the latter ‘at every level of per-capita GNP’.19 Democratization helps overcome security problems. Democracy building, for instance, can help combat the threat of transnational terrorism. As Jennifer Windsor puts it, ‘Democratic institutions can help address underlying conditions that fuel extremism’.20 Finally and arguably, democracies show less inclination than dictatorships toward waging war against each other.21 One of Bruce Russett’s basic points deserves consideration here: ‘the initial creation of democratic institutions may contribute to the explosion of ethnic conﬂicts, by providing the means of free expression, including expression of hatred and feelings of oppression.’ This point, however, ‘does not mean…that the solution lies in less democracy. Rather, it likely lies in devising institutions, and nurturing norms and practices, of democratic government with respect for minority rights’.22 We thus need to ask the hard question of how to build democratic institutions without exacerbating ongoing violent conﬂicts. Proponents of democracy still ask how new democracies in former war-torn countries can successfully build institutions that ‘foster free and open competition without descending into factionalism’ and that make leaders ‘more willing to accept meaningful constraints on their authority’. In other words, they still seek to understand ‘how to build the speciﬁc institutions that reduce the risk of violent instability in countries where democracy is being established’.23 A more recent study, by a panel of independent scholars who analyzed the fate of democracies and dictatorships around the world between 1955 and 2002, empirically validates the relationship between democratic consolidation and institution building. Their ﬁndings show that ‘political institutions and the patterns of political behavior that evolve around them determine a country’s resistance to instability’. The study conﬁrms that ‘countries with the most vulnerable institutions face relative odds of near-term political crises that are higher by roughly eight to two dozen times.’24 But how to build and maintain institutions successfully remains a daunting task. Institutionalists tend to ignore structural factors. In the\n\n4 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nmid-1990s, Karen Remmer once reminded us that, ‘comparativists have all but abandoned efforts to generalize about macrosocial prerequisites for political democracy in favor of more contingent understandings emphasizing the strategic choices of political actors.’25 Structural challenges to institution building matter signiﬁcantly. New institutions in post-war societies remain pathetically weak or often collapse. Just because peacebuilders have the best intentions when building institutions does not mean that these institutions automatically become strong over time. We must pay close attention to the question of whether structural factors can constrain or impede institution building efforts or give rise to success or failure.26 This book acknowledges that institutionalists put their hearts in the right place when engaging in designing institutions, but the question remains: How do we make them work as intended? We may need to paraphrase the point made by both March and Olsen that ‘political democracy depends not only on economic and social conditions but also on the design of political institutions.’27 In other words, democracy depends not only on the designing of institutions, but also on various structural conditions. This book thus seeks to shed more light on structural challenges to democratic institution building, working through the interplay between institutional structure and structural challenges. Cambodia provides a useful laboratory for reﬁning existing theoretical propositions regarding democratization. Writing in 1998, both Mark Gasiorowski and Timothy Power argue that, ‘The empirical literature on consolidation that has appeared so far consists of mainly singlecountry case studies and comparative analyses focusing on Latin America and Southern Europe’ and that the literature has ‘its limited geographical scope.’28 Valerie Bunce makes a similar argument: ‘Our understanding of recent democratization – of such issues as the origins and consolidation of new democracies – has been heavily inﬂuenced by the experiences of Latin America and Southern Europe.’29 Countries in Southeast Asia deserve more academic attention, not because it remains the most unique region in the world as some scholars think, but because of its diverse political experiences. Moreover, few countries in the world have become more aiddependent than Cambodia. The post-war country provides an excellent example for peacebuilders: between 1992 and 2006, the international donor community spent at least US$6 billion on the country. International assistance alone accounted for 50 per cent of its annual\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nnational budget. Yet democracy has remained unconsolidated and may even recede towards ‘electoral dictatorship’. The question remains: Why could international assistance not help consolidate democracy in this country? This book seeks to answer that question in a systematic fashion. It contains ﬁve major parts with 15 chapters seeking to explain why international donors may succeed in helping put war-torn societies on the path of democratic transition and peace, but often fail to consolidate the democratic gains they make. Part I of the book develops an analytical framework. Critical of rational-choice institutionalism, this book advances a theoretical perspective called ‘complex realist institutionalism’ (CRI) to explain the limits of international democracy assistance to post-war societies. Sympathetic to, but not uncritical of, historical and normative institutionalisms, this book reveals the structural constraints and impediments that interfere with the process of democratic regime consolidation. This study uses Cambodia as the main case study for a number of reasons, as we shall see in Chapter 3. Part II only describes how Cambodia’s electoral procedural rules, the liberal norms of accountability and non-violence, and the principle of liberty still came under threat. Part III then explains why the new democratic regime in Cambodia remained largely unconsolidated, by demonstrating that the state, political, and civil society institutions did not grow strong enough to establish an effective system of checks and balances. The key institutions remained extremely weak. Part IV further shows how structural challenges (both non-material and material) constrained and impeded the country’s institutional development. Part V seeks to make sense of why international democracy assistance proved unable to remove the structural challenges to democratic regime consolidation in the country. The ﬁnal conclusion draws lessons from the Cambodian and other case studies to advance CRI.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPart I The Analytical Framework\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Democratic Regime Consolidation and International Democracy Assistance\n\nThis chapter deﬁnes two key analytical concepts: democratic regime consolidation and international democracy assistance. It distinguishes liberal democracy from the various forms of democracy and dictatorship and points out that democratic consolidation (as part of the process of democratization) remains quite distinct from democratic transition. This study deﬁnes democratic consolidation as the process of moving further away from democratic transition and toward a mature democratic regime in which elite members of the major state, political, and civil society institutions effectively or fully comply with the electoral procedural rules, liberal principles and norms of the political game. Democratic transition as a political process does not automatically lead to democratic consolidation and may fall back toward dictatorship. This chapter deﬁnes international democracy assistance as a type of assistance provided by bilateral and multi-lateral actors for the promotion of democracy.\n\nDemocracy vs. dictatorship Democracy and dictatorship stand at opposite ends of political development. Dictatorship represents the hardest end. It has its origins in ancient Italian cities (including Rome), where rulers – viewed as autocrats or near-despots – governed as magistrates enjoying absolute power during periods of emergency. By and large, the concept of dictatorship refers to absolute rule unrestrained by law. Dictators have tight control over state institutions, such as the military, the legislature, and the judiciary. They eliminate active opposition and justify their absolute rule with certain ideological rationalizations. No competitive multi-party elections take place. Dictators rule for indeﬁnite periods of 9\n\n10 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\ntime, possibly for life. Changes of government come about only when dictators die or get thrown out by revolution, coup d’état, war, and so on. Civil society does not exist. Dictators control the mass media. In modern times, dictators include people who led totalitarian regimes, such as Adolf Hitler of Germany, Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union, Benito Mussolini of Italy, and Mao Zedong of China. Throughout history dictatorship has manifested itself in various degrees and forms: monarchical, military, civilian, socialist, and electoral. There exist several examples of monarchical dictatorship, such the rule of King Louis XIV of France, who regarded himself as one with the state (‘L’état, c’est moi’). Civilian dictatorships have existed throughout history, especially when effectively backed by armed forces, as in the case of Nazi Germany. Military dictatorships include the one in Japan prior to the end of World War II and the military junta in present-day Burma (Myanmar). A military junta consists of ofﬁcers of equal political rank and drawn from the various military services. Socialist dictatorships include those based on MarxismLeninism. Founder of modern communism, Karl Marx developed the concept of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’. The working class would take control of all productive forces with the aim of putting an end to the class struggle against capitalists. The Communist Party allows no alternative parties to compete in elections and controls society. We can add the concept of ‘electoral dictatorship’ to the list. This type of dictatorship moves closer to civilian dictatorship, because it allows the existence of an electoral system, albeit one effectively controlled by one hegemonic party. Electoral competition does not exist in any meaningful way, since the hegemonic party dictates what goes on in the political arena. Civil society hardly exists; if and when it does, none of its actors shows any willingness or capacity to constrain the incumbent hegemon. Electoral dictatorship remains distinct from ‘electoral democracy’ often referred to by some scholars as ‘electoral authoritarianism’ or ‘competitive authoritarianism’, characterized by the domination of ruling parties in electoral competition.1 For its part, democracy has many adjectives. In the mid-1950s, around 200 deﬁnitions of democracy existed.2 Liberal democracy may continue evolving into something else, such as participatory or even socialist democracy. Socialist democracy as a post-capitalist, pro-communist system of government may sound ideal, but to study it requires only philosophical speculation and normative commitment based on a certain contempt for liberal democracy.3 We need to use an operationalizable concept.\n\nDemocratic Regime Consolidation and International Democracy Assistance 11\n\nThis book deﬁnes democracy in liberal terms. It goes beyond Huntington’s procedural deﬁnition, which asserts that, ‘a twentiethcentury political system [is considered] democratic to the extent that its most powerful collective decision makers are selected through fair, honest, and periodic elections in which candidates freely compete for votes and in which virtually all the adult population is eligible to vote.’4 For others, democracy contains the following elements: ‘competition, participation, and civil and political liberties’.5 Liberal democracy does not rest upon a political system but rather on a regime encompassing these features. Renske Doorenspleet captures the meaning when stating the following: ‘A liberal democracy is a regime in which there is meaningful and extensive competition, sufﬁciently inclusive suffrage in national elections, and a high level of civil and political liberties.’6 Another scholar similarly characterizes liberal democracy as ‘a political system marked not only by free and fair elections, but also by the rule of law, a separation of powers, and the protection of basic liberties of speech, assembly, religion, and property.’7 This study deﬁnes a democratic regime as one whose elites comply with the electoral procedural rules and liberal principles and norms. Electoral Procedural Rules: Collective decision-making procedures in liberal democracies consist of the political process that allows citizens to pursue their interests by electing representatives. Modern democracies would not function effectively without elected representatives, who do much of the real policy work. This has much to do with the idea that modern democracy also means governability.8 Procedures exist to govern the electoral process. Before elections, procedures include voter and party registration systems, issuing voter identiﬁcation cards, as well as registering and qualifying political parties. During election days, there exist certain procedures concerning the presence of voters at the polling stations, ballot boxes, and the casting, counting, and delivering of ballots. After the election, election administrations can verify the ﬁnal count, go through other mechanisms (generally known as electoral tribunals) to settle electoral disputes among political parties by way of investigation and adjudication, and certify election outcomes. One basic procedural rule has it that multi-party elections must take place on a regular basis (repeatability), generally stipulated by democratic constitutions. Government leaders in democratic states do not seek to maintain their power by postponing elections as often as they wish or by canceling them at will. This electoral rule distinguishes liberal democracy from dictatorship, as noted earlier.\n\n12 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nAnother electoral procedural rule has to do with the idea of transparency. Before, during, and after elections, transparency subjects government ofﬁcials to openness with the aim of preventing them from acting to serve their personal interests in secrecy. Citizens have access to information about what they do, such as the public policy decisions they make, the national and local budgets they pass, the taxes they collect, and the laws they adopt. Citizens do not elect their representatives in secrecy and their representatives do not make decisions in ways unknown to the electorate at large. The other three electoral procedural rules include freeness, fairness, and representation. Freeness simply means citizens enjoy voting rights based on political equality, which excludes economic equality as generally recognized in the socialist doctrine. The liberal conception of democracy means that market forces remain seen as beneﬁcial, rather than detrimental, to democratic existence or survival. Efforts promoting economic equality have always received skeptical treatment by liberals, who regard them as impossible to achieve and even detrimental to the principle of liberty. Political equality thus simply means the equal right to get involved in the political process. Norberto Bobbio regards democracy only as ‘a regime in which all adult citizens have political rights, one in which there is universal suffrage’.9 The rule of fairness rejects discrimination against certain parties, especially opposition ones, and defends the need to establish and maintain a level playing ﬁeld. Democratic states also adhere to the electoral rule of representation. Citizens engage in the process of selecting their representatives, who can act on their behalf and in their interests. Democratically elected governments represent voters’ interests by demonstrating their responsiveness to the needs of their constituencies. The Principle of Liberty: Liberty remains the most fundamental liberal principle.10 According to Zakaria, ‘Liberty in the modern world is ﬁrst and foremost the freedom of the individual from arbitrary authority, which has meant, for most of history, from the brute power of the state. It implies certain basic human rights: freedom of expression, of association, and of worship, and rights of due process.’11 Individual citizens enjoy legal protection from the state’s arbitrary and legitimate exercise of power. According to Bobbio, ‘the doctrine of the juridical limits of the power of the State’ remains fundamental in liberalism.12 Moreover, citizens enjoy economic liberties, governed by the right to private property. Other freedoms allow them to choose the religion they want to practice, the places in which they want to reside, the career they want to pursue, and the persons they wish to marry.\n\nDemocratic Regime Consolidation and International Democracy Assistance 13\n\nLiberal Norms: The most basic liberal norms in democratic societies include accountability and non-violence. The norm of democratic accountability comes under challenge when elected ofﬁcials do not hold themselves accountable for their policy decisions and actions or do not hold unelected ofﬁcials to account. A democratic regime exists, for instance, if the legislature at least has the power to call members of the executive branch to answer critical questions related to policy matters and take appropriate action against them if found acting against the law. Non-violence remains the second most basic norm in modern democracies. Democracy does not mean that social groups (especially political parties) must not compete for power, but only that they reject violence as the appropriate standard of political and social behavior. While competitive, social groups or parties maintain cooperation. The rule of law underpinning the democratic norm of non-violence prevails when signiﬁcant social groups under a particular democratic regime behave under constitutional and legal constraints.13 The liberal norm persists only when they refrain from putting out statements inciting social violence or engaging in violent activities against the democratically elected government. State and non-state actors may still seek to remove the elected government from ofﬁce, but must do so peacefully, namely by not resorting to such means as violent coups or armed struggles. Socialist revolutionary forces sometimes use violence as their instrument to capture power undemocratically, with the intent to establish dictatorships. Larry Graham observes that, ‘a consolidated democratic regime cannot be achieved without commitment from the military that it will not intervene in politics regardless of electoral outcomes and that it will ignore appeals to the military for assistance on their behalf.’14\n\nDemocratic regime vs. power consolidation Transitology and consolidology in democracy studies remain distinct in the process of democratization. Transitology has its own intellectual patron, Niccolo Machiavelli, the ﬁrst to become concerned with the uncertainty of transition from princely to republican regimes. However, consolidology has no such patron. Contemporary scholars interested in the question of democratization used to study democratic transition, but have in recent decades become interested in the question of democratic stability and quality.15 Democratic transition as part of the process of democratization has several features that do not necessarily or automatically transform\n\n14 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\npost-war societies into consolidated democracies. Elites in societies transiting toward democracy comply with a limited number of electoral procedural rules, norms, and principles. Viewed this way, democratic transition does not start with only a ‘founding election’,16 since the early stage of democratization appears far more complex than this. First and foremost, democratic transition begins with the departure from dictatorship. It may begin with a liberal democratic agreement based on a set of electoral procedural rules, principles, and norms to establish a democratic regime. Second, power-contending elites must then hold the ﬁrst round of relatively transparent, free, fair, and representative elections. Elections need not become truly transparent, free, fair, and representative right away, largely because compliance with these electoral rules remains matters of degree.17 In other words, a democratic transition should begin with the new political process aimed at replacing a nondemocratic or dictatorial government with a democratically elected one. Third, the electoral process must proceed with a peaceful transfer of power. The ruling party may win the ﬁrst round of elections, but losing parties must accept the election outcome without engaging in any illegitimate acts, such as violent protests and demonstrations or armed revolts. If an opposition party wins, the ruling party must nonviolently concede and transfer its power to the winner. This does not rule out the possibility of power-sharing in parliamentary systems, where coalition politics remains legitimate. As we shall discuss next, consolidology must go beyond all this. One of the problems with democratic consolidation has to do with the fact that the concept seems to mean different things to different scholars. They tend to deﬁne the concept as they see ﬁt. Some regard the concept as ‘slippery’ and lacking appropriate operational measures, forcing them to develop individual concepts for their work.18 Others urge their colleagues to free themselves from ‘illusions about consolidation’.19 This study focuses on the process of democratization, emphasizing the process of democratic regime consolidation,20 rather than democracy, as the ﬁnal outcome of progression. It does not engage in research defending the argument for teleology, generally understood as an automatic or linear progression toward the ultimate endpoint of an ideal type of democracy, namely, ‘consolidation is not and should not be conceived as a linear process, moving inexorably towards successful completion. Empirical reality has amply demonstrated in recent years that protractedness, stagnation, temporary reversal, and, quite often, deconsolidation are equally, if not more likely outcomes.’21 The process\n\nDemocratic Regime Consolidation and International Democracy Assistance 15\n\nof transformation or change – both democratic transition and consolidation – remains essentially subject to progresses and setbacks or reversals to electoral dictatorship22 or ‘transitions’ followed by either ‘rapid deaths’ through classical military coups or ‘slow deaths’,23 or ‘democratic erosion’ over a period of time (as opposed to overthrow).24 Democratic development may break down and may subsequently become reconsolidated. In short, the process of democratization can swing between democratic transition, consolidation, deconsolidation, and reconsolidation. Overall, however, we should treat democratic consolidation as open, transformative, and boundless. As Schedler puts it, ‘no democracy will ever be “fully consolidated”’.25 The literature on democratic consolidation has now become a growth industry and the concept has multiple meanings. Schedler identiﬁes ﬁve of them: two negative ones (avoiding democratic breakdown and avoiding democratic erosion), a neutral one (institutionalizing democracy), and two positive ones (completing democracy and deepening democracy). Democracy gets consolidated if it can avoid a breakdown or ‘rapid death’ caused by violence, such as a coup, or if it can avoid a ‘slow death’, meaning backsliding or regression toward autocracy or dictatorship. For scholars who deﬁne democratic consolidation in positive terms, the concept either means the process of completing (reaching the goal of completing a pending transition toward democracy) or deepening (progressing toward advanced democracy). Between the two groups of deﬁnitions, there stands a neutral one: the institutionalization of democracy. From a sociological perspective, a democracy gets consolidated when actors begin to perceive the democratic game as part of the normal or natural practice. The democratic game becomes habitual or internalized. From the subsystem perspective, democracy gets consolidated when various institutions, such as branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial bodies), political parties, and party systems, emerge and grow strong. This study deﬁnes democratic regime consolidation as a political process of institutional transformation, in which signiﬁcant elite members increasingly comply with electoral procedural rules and liberal principles and norms. It does not follow in the footsteps of those scholars who forcefully insist democratic consolidation becomes evident when all individuals or most individual citizens adhere to democratic behavioral norms or accept democracy as the ‘only game in town’.26 It seems too unrealistic to ﬁnd most individuals behaving in accordance with such norms. More realistically, a democratic regime becomes consolidated when it ‘meets all the procedural criteria of\n\n16 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\ndemocracy and also in which all politically signiﬁcant groups accept established political institutions and adhere to democratic rules of the game’.27 Nancy Bermeo contends that ordinary people do not overthrow democracy (they almost always choose democracy over dictatorship), but elites do. Elites include those in civilian and military leadership positions or small coalitions.28 This study focuses on signiﬁcant elites within the state and political and civil societies. State institutions include both democratic and nondemocratic ones. Democratic state institutions include the executive branch of government and the legislature, whose members come to power through elections. Non-democratic state institutions may include the judiciary, the bureaucracy, and the security and military apparatus, whose members do not come to power by electoral means. Political society institutions include the election administration commonly evident in democratic states, political parties registered to compete in elections, and their alliances. Civil society institutions include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the media sector, and other voluntary associations established by citizens to serve their own personal and social ends. Economic society institutions remain market-based; they include major companies and ﬁrms or corporations. The literature in democracy studies shows a trend toward this academic consensus.29 From an ontological perspective, signiﬁcant elites matter a great deal in regards to the exercise of political power (democratic or otherwise). In capitalist democracies, elected representatives function as members of the political elite, but not all individual representatives play an equally signiﬁcant role. At the state level, leaders of the three branches of government matter. Within political society, party leaders and election administration ofﬁcials also matter. Within civil society, signiﬁcant elites include those actively engaged in institutional activities to monitor elections, human rights issues, and constitutional as well as legal issues. A democratic regime remains or becomes consolidated when none of the signiﬁcant elite members (especially those of the executive branch) succeeds in monopolizing power by either institutionalizing personal power or deinstitutionalizing democratic power. Institutionalizing personal power takes place when elite members expand repressive institutions, such as the security and military apparatus, to weaken other state and non-state institutions capable of checking their despotic and infrastructural power (the power to decide and to implement decisions).30 In short, this study prefers to focus on the concept of democratic regime consolidation.\n\nDemocratic Regime Consolidation and International Democracy Assistance 17\n\nInternational democracy assistance This study focuses on the impact of international democracy assistance on post-war societies.31 Carothers regards his pioneering book as ‘a response to the lack of systematic study of democracy assistance. Ten years after 1989 – the starting point for much recent democracy work – it is a natural time for taking stock. I attempt in this book to draw together the essential elements of and questions about democracy aid to help deﬁne this emergent ﬁeld as a ﬁeld.’32 This type of assistance means ‘aid speciﬁcally designed to foster a democratic opening in a non-democratic country or to further a democratic transition in a country that has experienced a democratic opening’.33 Evidently the 1990s witnessed a rapid growth of democracy assistance. Both Krishna Kumar and Jeroen de Zeeuw further remark that, ‘International donors believe – with considerable justiﬁcation – that democracy offers the best change to promote peace and heal the wounds of war in post-conﬂict societies.’34 International democracy assistance means assistance by actors – bilateral and multi-lateral – with a policy to promote democracy in other countries. External actors include states, international organizations (such as the United Nations and the European Union), and NGOs. States have now emerged as ‘democracy promoters’. The United States provides only one example. The United States has a long history of foreign policy toward democracy promotion rooted in Wilsonian liberalism after World War I. More recently, Washington began a campaign of human rights under the Carter administration, actively sought to promote democracy over communism under the Reagan administration, and spent from $100 million in 1990 to $700 million in 2000 on programs that helped establish and strengthen such democratic institutions and processes.35 The end of the Cold War further allowed Washington to seize the opportunity to develop a robust and distinctively American liberal grand strategy to promote free trade, human rights and democracy around the world.36 The United States intensiﬁed the global campaign of democracy and human rights under the Clinton administration. During the election campaign in 1992, then-Governor Bill Clinton repeatedly attacked George Bush’s policy toward China and Haiti. President Bush and his Secretary of State, James Baker III, started to treat democracy promotion as an indisputably important element of the United States’ foreign policy. This policy orientation coincided with the global revolution or resurgence of democracy, especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n18 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nAllison and Beshel similarly view this time as a point of departure in US foreign policy toward other regions in the world: ‘the democratic revolutions of 1989, coupled with the retreat of authoritarian regimes in Latin America and parts of Asia and Africa, have prompted a resurgence of interest throughout the U.S. government and society at large in promoting democracy.’37 The main US state agents of democracy promotion included the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and other governmental and quasi-governmental organizations such as the US Information Agency, the Departments of State and Defense, the Department of Justice, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the Asia Foundation, and the Eurasia Foundation. In the 1990s, Washington spent more than $500 million per year on democracy promotion around the world. The United States, however, did not emerge as the only actor in democracy promotion. Others in the Western world have also provided assistance to promote democracy in post-war or developing countries. Thomas Carothers, for instance, observes that, ‘Almost every major donor has developed democracy-related programmes, with some becoming very actively involved, such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, … Denmark, Norway, and Spain.’38 Michel Feher points out that American and Western European leaders ‘proudly associated the end of the Cold War with the advent of an increasingly cohesive international community’ committed to ‘fostering democracy and preventing human rights violations’.39 Among international organizations, 40 the UN, its international agencies, and programmes have stood at the forefront of global policy efforts to promote democracy worldwide . In 1992, the UN established an Electoral Assistance Unit under its Department of Political Affairs. In 1994, the Unit, renamed the Electoral Assistance Division, got transferred to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations. According to Christopher Joyner, ‘the UN Secretariat has assumed the impressive role of international agent for democratization’.41 Other UN bodies engaged in democracy promotion include the General Assembly, the Security Council, the United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP),42 the UN Commission on Human Rights (now the UN Council on Human Rights), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).43 Regional organizations have also become actively involved in democracy promotion. They include the European Union (EU),44 the Organization of African States (OAS), the InterParliamentary Union (IPU), and the Commonwealth Secretariat.\n\nDemocratic Regime Consolidation and International Democracy Assistance 19\n\nNational and international NGOs have also acted as another set of democracy promoters. Political foundations in the United State, Canada, Germany,45 and others, for instance, have been active in providing democracy assistance. In the United States, NGOs involved in democracy promotion include the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI), the International Republican Institute (IRI), the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, the AFL-CIO’s Solidarity Center, and the Carter Center. Some consulting private ﬁrms also have an agenda of democracy promotion; they include US-based Chemonics International, Creative Associates International, and Management Systems International. Other international NGOs include Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. There exist various types of assistance for democracy promotion: military intervention (to restore democracy), institution building, education, economic development, and political pressure. Based on the above deﬁnition of a democratic regime, democracy assistance should not simply mean assistance for elections. As we shall see in Chapter 2, democratic consolidation depends on the high-level institutionalization of democratic power within the state and political and civil society, and the process of institutionalization further depends upon other structural factors. We may need to deﬁne democracy assistance broadly to include any assistance that covers institutional and structural factors conducive to democratic consolidation. During the course of democracy promotion, donors ‘typically direct such aid at one or more institutions or political processes from what has become a relatively set list: elections, political parties, constitutions, judiciaries, police, legislatures, local government, militaries, non-governmental civic advocacy groups, civic education organizations, trade unions, media organizations.’ 46 Electoral assistance includes organization and conduct of elections, election supervision, veriﬁcation, coordination and support of international observers, support for national election observers, and observation.47 Democracy assistance also covers the drafting of liberal constitutions and other legislation, various forms of training, including civic and voter education, and election organization. Civic education promotes awareness of democratic culture through respect for political rights and civil liberties. Another form of assistance includes economic assistance to help develop economies by ensuring economic development and building a private sector integrated into the global market economy.48 After all, scholars regard liberal democracy in capitalist terms (based on market forces). Political assistance includes\n\n20 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\npolitical pressure placed on elites engaged in the political process of power competition through elections.\n\nConclusion This study deﬁnes democratic regime consolidation as a post-transition process whereby signiﬁcant institutional elites within democracies (most notably those of the executive branch of government) behave in a way that increasingly conforms to the electoral procedural rules and liberal principles and norms. We should not simply talk about the prevention of democratic breakdowns and survival as generally understood,49 or the presence of institutional stability or durability as such,50 but about growing degrees of elite compliance with the established ‘liberal democratic game’. This study mainly seeks to assess the impact of international democracy assistance, which remains a controversial subject. Some remain optimistic about the impact of such assistance. Pessimists argue that such assistance has no effect or even harmful effects, because it serves reasons other than democracy. In fact, it seems more appropriate to talk about the limits of international democracy assistance.\n\n2 Institutional Structure and Structural Challenges\n\nA certain international consensus has now emerged on liberal democracy, but the literature reveals deep disagreement on how to promote this form of government.1 This chapter advances the proposition based on complex realist institutionalism (CRI): international democracy assistance can help consolidate democracy if donors can successfully build an effective system of institutional checks and balances between or among state, political, and civil society institutions; however, non-material and material structures often stand in the way. Structural factors pose a critical challenge to neo-institutionalism, which tends to assume that institutions signiﬁcantly structure political relationships. We still live in a ‘real world’ where institutional design does not automatically transform dictatorship. Because of institutional weaknesses – partly constrained by certain cultural, ideological, and historical legacies – elites tend to pursue their own interests. Their socioeconomic and political positions also impede prospects for democratic regime consolidation.\n\nState institution building Complex realist institutionalism as a proposed theory sees the merit of state institution building. State institutionalists urge donors to build and strengthen state institutions; otherwise, democracy will not become consolidated. None of the theorists of democracy argues that the executive branch of government should become irrelevant, but insist that the chief executive must not exercise power arbitrarily, extend power over greater reaches of society, or maintain power indeﬁnitely. Reform of the executive branch in post-war societies remains necessary. State institutionalists have sought to design institutional constraints on the executive branch. Some of them focus on the need to promote 21\n\n22 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nconstitutional liberalism. They argue that elections alone do not help consolidate democracy, and have even proved destructive to democratic principles and norms. When elected, anti-democratic forces can topple rather than consolidate the system through which they came to power. Adolf Hitler of Germany, for instance, rose to power through free elections. Liberty must come ﬁrst, and democracy must follow or co-exist with it. Liberal constitutions must thus protect ﬁrst and foremost the liberal democratic principle of liberty, which can exist without free and fair elections.2 Liberty also depends on social order and self-control,3 reinforced by the liberal rule of law. The rule of law underpins constitutional liberalism and stands at the center of modern democratic politics. It offers guarantees that secure liberty – a bundle of freedoms – for the individual, emphasizing ‘checks on the power of government, equality under the law, impartial courts and tribunals, the separation of church and state’.4 Ultimately, the rule of law protects and promotes individual rights, the core of liberal democracy. Some even see the rule of law as a panacea for the political and economic ills that afﬂict dictatorships and hence as advancing democratic and economic development.5 Carothers notes that ‘Western observers say that enhancing the rule of law will allow states to move beyond the ﬁrst stage of political and economic reform to consolidate both democracy and market economics’.6 Crafting democratic systems also includes the necessity of bureaucratic, military, and security reform. If the military remains powerful, democratic consolidation will not succeed.7 Military supremacy leads to democracy’s ‘rapid death’: the military reasserts its power and can kill democracy.8 Military reform involves professional training, developing a military legal code based on soldiers’ rights, education in basic human rights guarantees, and nurturing military loyalty to a lawful constitution.9 The security apparatus must not serve as a political instrument for any social group or political party and must carry the primary task of maintaining law and order. The legislature remains fundamental. Some state their speciﬁc preference for presidentialism,10 while others favor parliamentarism. Proponents of presidentialism see the merits of this democratic system because of their attraction to the idea of stability and continuity. For proponents of parliamentarian systems, presidentialism seems less likely than parliamentarism to lead to democratic consolidation,11 largely because presidentialism remains more rigid, more centralized yet more stalemated, and less adequately representative than parliamentarism. In presidential systems, the winner takes all (allowing little\n\nInstitutional Structure and Structural Challenges\n\n23\n\nroom for political consensus or inter-party coalition building while encouraging stalemate because of the clear separation of powers), stays in ofﬁce for a ﬁxed term (preventing political actors from making necessary changes to ensure effectiveness and accommodation) and tends to undermine political rights and institutional checks. In transitions from post-totalitarian, post-communist, or post-authoritarian systems, presidentialism tends to reduce ‘the degrees of freedom for an emerging civil and political society to make a midcourse correction, because heads of government have been elected for ﬁxed terms’.12 When the power of presidents grows strong, the party system tends to become more fragmented. Political parties – because of their reliance on presidents – tend to display a lack of clearly deﬁned programs and exist as mere labels for politicians to compete for public ofﬁce. Moreover, civil society tends to stay weak. Proponents of democratic parliamentarism contend that parliamentary systems help consolidate democracy. Some treat parliaments as the ‘central site’ in enhancing political legitimacy for new democratic regimes and thus as contributing to the process of democratic consolidation. Political elites operating within parliaments may initially try to weaken or eliminate one another, but subsequently tend to develop positions shaped by perceptions of mutual interests and allow their conﬂicts to become increasingly regulated by known rules and techniques.13 Others see parliaments as producing positive effects on other institutions, such as political and civil society institutions.14 Because formal powers remain highly concentrated and because political stalemate tends to persist in presidential systems, other political parties and social groups do not become strong. Local elites also get prevented from consolidating their control over organizational-administrative resources. On the contrary, parliamentary systems ‘tend to increase the degree of freedom that facilitate the momentous tasks of economic and social restructuring facing new democracies as they simultaneously attempt to consolidate their democratic institutions’.15 Because they can form coalition governments, political parties from different ideological orientations can both integrate themselves into the political arena and engage in the politics of accommodation that can resolve disputes – thus mitigating propensities toward violence or avoiding military coups – and provide stability through continuity. Ulrike Liebert further notes that ‘parliament may motivate certain extreme groups to moderate too radical claims’.16 State institutionalists would agree with Alfred Stepan that democracies need to draft bodies within legislatures to ensure that they can\n\n24 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\ndevelop effective checks on executive power. Bodies such as permanent standing committees with professional staffs and specialists in matters such as military strategy, budgeting, or intelligence also help empower ‘legislatures to carry their military and intelligence oversight functions in a routine democratic and legislative fashion’.17 These committees and other special commissions of inquiry can invite cabinet and military ofﬁcials to appear before them and answer questions regarding controversial policy issues. Still for other state institutionalists, judicial reform within post-war societies must also receive top priority.18 An independent judiciary must enjoy the power to do its job without political interference. Courts, judges, and lawyers must become professional enough to carry out their tasks and must grow powerful enough to resist political pressure and executive manipulation. Judicial elites in particular must demonstrate their effective ability to play a central role in establishing and maintaining the rule of law (capable of holding executive elites accountable for their actions and keep them from ignoring, dissolving, or altering other institutions, such as courts). In short, state institutionalists argue in favor of building an effective system of institutional checks and balances among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government capable of building and strengthening democratic regimes. But why have efforts to institutionalize rule-of-law reform in postwar societies proved so difﬁcult? Thomas Carothers raises a legitimate point: ‘Rule-of-law reform will succeed only if it gets at the fundamental problem of leaders who refuse to be ruled by the law’.19 However, he notes only one such structural problem: ‘Respect for the law will not easily take root in systems rife with corruption and cynicism, since entrenched elites cede their traditional impunity and vested interests only under great pressure.’20 He warns that democracy assistance to enable ‘government obedience to law is the hardest, slowest kind of assistance’ and ‘will not bring rapid or decisive results’. Donors must thus intervene to help break ‘down entrenched political interests, transforming values, and generating enlightened, consistent leadership’.21\n\nPolitical and civil society institution building Because of its faith in the effective system of institutional checks and balances, CRI further proposes that such a system may also depend on institutional development within political and civil society capable of checking the state’s executive power.\n\nInstitutional Structure and Structural Challenges\n\n25\n\nScholars emphasize the need for building political and civil society institutions. Alfred Stepan distinguishes political from civil society. Political society institutions include political parties, political leadership, and intra-party alliances. He deﬁnes political society as an ‘arena in which the polity speciﬁcally arranges itself for political contestation to gain control over public power and the state apparatus’.22 For Stepan, democracy consolidates only if political society becomes relatively autonomous. He does not reject the role of the state or its bureaucracy or civil society, but adds that political society must also exist if we hope to consolidate democracy. In his words, ‘Democratic consolidation requires that citizens develop an appreciation for the core institutions of a democratic political society.’23 As part of political society, political parties remain central to democratic consolidation. Some scholars associate a large number of political parties with consolidated parliamentary and semi-presidential democracies. But they see no association between consolidated presidential democracies and ‘the type of multi-party coalitional behavior that facilitates democratic rule in contexts of numerous socioeconomic, ideological, and ethnic cleavages and of numerous parties in legislatures’.24 In his view, ‘Democratic consolidation requires political parties, one of whose primary tasks is precisely to aggregate and represent differences between democrats.’25 Pro-electoral democracy scholars have further argued that electoral democratic systems matter.26 Electoral laws also remain central, of course.27 J. Samuel Valenzuela, for instance, gives attention to the need for removing formal authoritarian legacies by creating electoral laws that abolish ‘tutelary powers’, ‘reserved domains’, and ‘major discriminations’.28 In her article ‘Why Elections Matter’, Elizabeth Spiro Clark similarly notes that, ‘A commitment to the electoral process, driven by popular will, was the strongest factor sustaining the transition’29 or deterring backsliding. Donors thus need to build and strengthen multi-party political systems,30 so that democracy can enjoy a chance to become consolidated. Political parties also have a special place in democratic consolidation. Highly fragmented party systems, especially in presidential democracies, tend to hinder democratic consolidation.31 Political parties must prove capable of competing for public ofﬁce by accepting a new government formed by the winner. They may form political alliances and their members may stay active in the process of negotiation or bargaining, but their political objectives do not undermine the democratic system; they become part of it. They do not engage in such acts as violent protests or armed rebellions.32\n\n26 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nElection administrations have also become important to the process of democratization. They undertake multiple tasks – before, during, and after election days.33 When independent and impartial, they prove able to organize elections whose results provide legitimacy in the eyes of all parties involved in the electoral process. Election administrations must develop and grow strong institutionally to the extent that they do not only advance the interests of any particular political party, especially the dominant one. Still others take a more bottom-up approach to democratic regime consolidation, stressing the importance of civil society. Civil society actors or institutions include those ‘self-organizing and relatively autonomous groups, movements, and individuals’ that ‘attempt to articulate values, to create associations and solidarities, and to advance their interests’.34 Alexis de Tocqueville long ago noted the importance of civil society. Civil society institutionalists have carried this tradition, often pitting civil society against the state. Some of them regard civil society as a set of actors not only capable of leading struggles against dictatorships, but also of helping to consolidate democracy. To become a contributor to the process of democratic consolidation, civil society must not only include organizations of a non-political nature,35 but also seek to shape and inﬂuence the political regime. Civil society actors can do a number of things to promote or consolidate democracy. They can help design constitutions that promote or consolidate democracy. If constitutional design rests in the hands of foreign and national elites, some argue, new political institutions would likely serve their own interests rather than the interests of the electorate.36 Civil society actors can also help defend liberty. For instance, the Catholic Church was the ﬁrst major institution in history that served as a countervailing force willing to challenge state power. In other words, ‘By doing this [the Church] cracked the ediﬁce of state power, and in nooks and crannies individual liberty began to grow.’37 Civil society thus needs special attention. A growing consensus among scholars on the long-term process of democratic consolidation has become evident.38 Some observers no longer accept the view that traditional values rooted in religions, such as Islam and Confucianism, stand in the way of democratic development.39 Various organizations that represent a variety of social interests have formed social movements that have given rise to political opposition to the state. Other studies on the role of emergent civil societies in ASEAN also seek to determine a positive relationship between civil society and democratization. Johan Saravanamuttu adopted the notion\n\nInstitutional Structure and Structural Challenges\n\n27\n\nthat civil society constitutes a ‘third’ sector operating in between the public and the private sector.40 Some evidence he provides to prove this point includes what the CSOs in the Philippines have achieved: namely, ‘were it not for a strong civil society in the Philippines in the mid-1980s the transition from dictatorship to democracy would not have been possible.’41 Garry Rodan further contends that ‘the greatest potential of civil society to act as a force for liberal political change derives from its potential to institutionalize the rights of organized citizens to inﬂuence the decision-making process.’ He adds that, ‘Independent organizations which have a potential mass membership and links with other elements of society can play a critical role in fostering a liberal civil society.’42 Other scholars regard civil society as helping to consolidate democracy. Stepan, for instance, wrote: ‘A robust civil society, with the capacity to generate political alternatives and to monitor government and state, can help start transitions, but help resist reversals, help push transitions to their completion, and help consolidate and deepen democracy’.43 Larry Diamond makes a similar argument – ’Civil society can, and typically must, play a central role in building and consolidating democracy’ – and hypothesizes that, ‘the more effectively it balances the tensions in its relations with the state…the more likely democracy will be able to emerge and endure.’44 Some scholars see the need to combine political and civil society actors in their joint efforts to both undermine dictatorships and consolidate the democratic gains they have made. The two types of actors need each other. Civil society actors can help inform, pressure, and periodically renew political society actors. Together they ‘must somehow achieve a workable agreement on the myriad ways in which democratic power will be drafted and exercised’,45 as well as consolidated. In sum, CRI contends that the system of institutional checks and balances in modern liberal democracies becomes complex in that it comprises state, political, and civil society institutions existing to constrain the abuse or arbitrary use of executive power. But such institutions do not grow automatically into maturity. While they can affect the levels of compliance with the democratic decision-making procedures, rules, principles, and norms of the political game, we need to pose another question: If institutions can affect behavior,46 what makes them strong enough to affect behavior or what weakens and prevents them from affecting behavior? Peters raises a legitimate point: ‘institutions are the variable that explains most of political life, and they are also the factors that require explanation.’47 Carothers further contends that\n\n28 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\n‘external [rule-of-law] aid cannot substitute for the internal will to reform’.48 We can understand such lack of will only in the broader structural context. CRI thus takes into account other structural challenges.\n\nStructural constraints and impediments to democratic institution building Non-material structures (acknowledged by normative and historical institutionalisms) help explain why rational institutional design does not lead to institutional development in a linear fashion. These ‘soft’ and unobservable but ‘real’ structural constraints – cultural, ideological, and historical – shed light on how fast societies can build new institutions. Cultural and historical legacies create ‘path dependence’ and pose as a real constraint on democracy building. Zbigniew Brzezinski proclaims the ‘primacy of history and culture’.49 A country with no history or tradition of democratic institutions takes much longer to build them. Colonialism appears to have left varying institutional legacies. The British Empire tended to help build modern institutions in its colonies, whereas the French Empire did not appear to make this effort. The French, in fact, tended to make ‘attempts at assimilation’ and their former colonies evidently ‘have not been noted for their democratic achievements’.50 Culturalists emphasize the real structural constraint of culture.51 Max Weber’s work became known for his identiﬁcation of ‘Protestant ethic’ as the key variable explaining both capitalism and self-government. More recently, Huntington contends that some traditions such as Islam and Confucianism remain anti-democratic, as the concept of illiberalism suggests.52 Cultural perspectives reject Francis Fukuyama’s claim about an ‘end of history’ with the ﬁnal triumph of liberal democracy over all other cultural and ideological rivals. In other words, they do not view liberal democracy as universally accepted, but treat it as culturally peculiar to the Western world. Some use such terms as ‘soft authoritarianism’53 and ‘neo-authoritarianism’.54 Zakaria’s analysis of the next wave points to ‘the rise of illiberal democracy’.55 Others characterize similarly democracy in East Asia as ‘Asian-style’ or simply ‘illiberal’.56 Asian-style democracy remains illiberal because of patron-client communitarianism, personalism, hierarchical authority, dominant political parties, and the strong state.57 Civil society institutions do not exist or remain too weak or uncritical.58 For culturalists, the Western metaphor ‘iron-cage as prison’ contradicts the Asian cultural mindset, which sees the ‘iron-cage’ as security.\n\nInstitutional Structure and Structural Challenges\n\n29\n\nAsians do not demand personal or individual freedom or autonomy. Other values and ideals – the pursuit of glory, honor, power for oneself, nationalism, militarism and valor in warfare, ﬁlial piety, the harmony of heaven and earth, to name a few – matter more.59 Some scholars even refer to ‘dependency culture’ (characterized by legalistic, rationalistic, but apolitical bureaucracy and Confucian deference) in Asia.60 Asian political systems rest on the concept of ‘substantive moral consensus that denies or suppresses moral pluralism and social diversity’.61 In Asia, ‘the European Enlightenment…made no headway other than amongst intellectuals who had absorbed it by reading European texts or studying under political scientists such as the later Professor Laski.’62 Other Western scholars, such as Michael Frolic, thus see the need to bring culture back.63 Research on post-communist transitions further focuses on a set of explanatory variables that affect the ability of political leaders to consolidate democracy. Ideology matters, because it can resist electoral procedural rules and liberal principles and norms. Socialist legacies remain signiﬁcant in that transitory regimes still reject capitalist development in a resolute fashion.64 Other scholars agree that ideological legacies (with radical values) make it impossible for former socialist regimes to move toward democracy.65 China, for instance, does not wish to experience the collapse of its regime in the same manner that occurred in Eastern Europe. Most Chinese elites have strong totalitarian backgrounds.66 Communists destroyed civil society or left it too weak to pose any challenge to them.67 Post-communist experience in Eastern Europe suggests that democratic consolidation moves forward only if and when the democratic opposition successfully takes a radical step to sever its political ties with defenders of the old socialist order.68 Normative and historical institutionalisms can thus explain institutional persistence over time,69 but cannot explain change or transformation. Normative institutionalism can explain why new institutions do not always shape individuals’ preferences or development paths,70 and have difﬁculty explaining why they remain structurally weak. ‘Complex realist institutionalism’, proposed in this study, further subsumes these institutionalisms by treating them as part of real but unobservable structures that constrain and impede the institutional process of democratic consolidation.71 While non-material structures constrain change, they do not forever impede it. Philippe Schmitter remains ‘deeply convinced that the attainment of a civic culture is much more likely to come as a product of democracy than a prerequisite for it’.72 Some scholars also recognize\n\n30 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nthe weight of socialist legacies, but seek to overcome them over time following the end of socialist rule. New democratic regimes in Central East Europe, formerly socialist states, had become consolidated by the mid-1990s. State elites can also become autonomous and manipulative of cultural and ideological factors73 and work to legitimize their dictatorial rule through economic performance and control74 when they become successful in monopolizing power over the socioeconomic, political, security, and military establishments. We, therefore, should not treat culture, ideology, and history as non-material factors that permanently determine the behavior of signiﬁcant elite members. Their actions may come under non-material constraints, but elites also can change them in their pursuit of self-interest by treating non-material factors in instrumental terms. CRI, therefore, regards ‘rational-choice’ institutionalism as capable of explaining why self-interested members of socioeconomic and political elites seek to solve collective action problems and can explain why institutions may persist, become strong, or even collapse. Institutions remain weak, become weaker, or ‘“can be undone” when they no longer provide constraints on individuals’ behavior’.75 Rational-choice institutionalists also view economic development as beneﬁcial to the process of democratic consolidation. Adam Przeworski and others, for instance, assert that ‘transitions to democracy are random with regard to the level of development’.76 They thus agree with Martin Lipset on the liberal conviction that modern liberal democracies that enjoy an annual per-capita income of more than US$6000 ‘are impregnable and can be expected to live forever’.77 But it remains unclear why power contenders cooperate and thus collectively help consolidate democracy. Fareed Zakaria further asserts that liberal democracy experienced in the West and other regions advances on the back of capitalism. In his view, the capitalist system, not wealth per se, helps consolidate democracy. He observes the following: ‘If the struggles between church and state, lords and kings, and Catholics and Protestants cracked open the door for individual liberty, capitalism blew the walls down.’78 Growing economic resources offer more political resources: the bourgeoisie’s and middle class’s growing ability to inﬂuence public policy, elect leaders, run for public ofﬁce, and uphold the rule of law. But does capitalism in post-war societies automatically empower middle classes that make useful contributions to democratic institution building, as modernization theorists assert? Evidently capitalism does not always empower the majority of people in developing countries,\n\nInstitutional Structure and Structural Challenges\n\n31\n\nbut has often impoverished them. Economic growth tends to beneﬁt certain economic and political elites, whose self-interest impedes democratic regime consolidation. The state, for instance, remains too weak to collect adequate taxes from the rich to boost its national revenue and to strengthen its institutional capacity (especially regarding wealth distribution). The reality of material impediments to the institutional process of democratic regime consolidation rests on whether signiﬁcant elite members believe that they can pursue their interests without having to face any structural challenges. Their self-interest helps explain why they pursue the strategy of economic growth by doing little to reduce their socioeconomic advantages. Economic elites tend to seek to change or maintain any institutions that help them retain and extend their economic power,79 and this helps explain the lack of democratic regime consolidation. The capitalist process of economic liberalization in post-war societies thus tends to create and exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities.80 If economic growth enriches only elites and their supporters, it deprives the rest of material beneﬁts. According to Vanhanen, ‘democracy takes place under conditions in which power resources have become so widely distributed that no group is any longer able to suppress its competitors or to maintain its hegemony.’81 Mancur Olson further notes that democratic emergence takes place when a ‘dispersion of resources…make[s] it impossible for anyone leader or group to overpower others.’82 Socioeconomic factors thus should help draw our analytical attention closer to ‘Marxist realism’.83 Poverty and socioeconomic inequality further tend to harm institution building within political and civil society institutions. Dominant political parties with the most resources generally seek to achieve hegemonic status by depriving other parties of available resources. Without adequate material resources, other political parties cannot successfully strengthen their power bases by enlarging their constituencies. Poor citizens may not become active opposition party members and even put material burden on those seeking their votes. When under severe ﬁnancial constraints, even supposedly neutral election administrations may bow to pressure from ruling party elites. Civil society also cannot grow strong, either, if the majority of citizens remain too poor to become politically active and to provide adequate material support for daily organizational and political activities. Poverty may even encourage the executive use of repressive violence to prevent or stop violent demonstrations, armed rebellions and conﬂict.84\n\n32 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nScholars also infer causal relationships between democratization and political power.85 Huntington warns against hard-liners’ domination over moderates within the opposition.86 Przeworski pays attention to the relative strength of reformers within authoritarian regimes.87 Swaminathan contends that ‘power parity among an authoritarian government and a dissatisﬁed opposition sets the stage for transition to democracy…an opposition that is gaining strength relative to the government will be prepared to challenge the existing status quo at the stage of power parity.’88 Democracy can easily come under threat if state elites dominate civil society.89\n\nConclusion This study argues in favor of CRI: democratic regime consolidation proceeds with an effective system of institutional checks and balances among signiﬁcant members of elites within the state, political and civil society; however, when trapped in institutionally weak states, state elites tend to pursue ‘relative’ gains selﬁshly without self-restraint. The rational-choice optimism that competing elites can cooperate effectively on their own for either mutual gain overlooks the structural fact that they tend to struggle for relative economic gain and political supremacy and thus actively seek to tighten control over the economic, political and security arenas by way of co-opting those willing to jump on their bandwagon and eliminating those resistant to their domination. They operate more or less like states under international anarchy and adopt the preemptive strategy of alliance building and power consolidation at the expense of all challengers.90\n\n3 Research Methodology: Cambodia as Case Study\n\nThis chapter addresses the question of analytical methods essential to this type of research. It makes the argument that case studies can provide useful in-depth analysis, which helps us answer some of the complex problems related to democratization. This chapter formulates a proposition and a set of hypotheses for empirical testing and discusses sources of data used for the book’s single country-case study, Cambodia. This study, however, does not follow strictly the requirement of quantitative data and statistic techniques, as scientiﬁc positivists do. As of 2006, post-communist and post-war Cambodia (with a history of monarchical and socialist rule) had not yet become industrialized and still lacked reliable numerical data. Analysis of democratic politics in post-war societies must rely on both quantitative and qualitative data from all available sources.\n\nCambodia as the main single-country case study Single-country case studies on democratic consolidation have received criticism for their methodological shortcomings and for their failures to explain structural factors. Critics of this method see the need to engage in broader, interregional or cross-national analyses based on structural factors, such as socioeconomic conditions.1 While they have weaknesses, single-country cases have their own analytical strengths. This study primarily focuses on democracy building from institutionalist and structuralist perspectives. This book also seeks to test a speciﬁc proposition based on insights generated from the literature, as discussed in Chapter 2. In other words, it engages in theoretical debates, forms its own propositions, and seeks to test their hypotheses. Country cases help us assess the structural perspectives, 33\n\n34 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nparticularly cultural, ideological, and historical ones, as these variables tend to defy quantiﬁcation. A Southeast Asian country, Cambodia remains an excellent case for the study of democratic consolidation in post-war societies within the developing world. In 1970, a bloodless but successful coup against Prince Norodom Sihanouk erupted, ushering in a bloody civil war exacerbated by military intervention from North and South Vietnam and the United States. The war ended with the unsurprising victory of a revolutionary force, which turned the country at war and under extensive US bombings into unprecedented ‘killing ﬁelds’ claiming somewhere between one and one and a half millions during the period that ended in early 1979. The Vietnamese military invasion in late 1978 led to the violent overthrow of the ruthless Khmer Rouge regime, but kept the country at war throughout the 1980s and until 1998. Early in the 1990s, the country entered the global fold of post-Cold War states making a triple transition (comparatively late in the ‘third wave’ of democracy):2 from war to peace, from dictatorship to democracy, and from command economy to free market. On 23 October 1991, 18 foreign governments and four major armed factions in Cambodia – the State of Cambodia (SOC), the Khmer Rouge (ofﬁcially known as Democratic Kampuchea or DK), the Khmer People’s National Liberation Front (KPNLF), and the royalists known as FUNCINPEC – formally signed the Paris Peace Agreements, a democratic agreement that sought to turn the battleﬁeld into a ballot-box.3 The process of democratic transition thus began in October 1991, when the Cambodian and 18 other external state actors signed the democratic agreement to end the decade-long war and to lay to the foundation for liberal democracy. In May 1993, Cambodia held its ﬁrst multi-party election since the early 1970s, followed later in that year by the establishment of a constituent assembly, a coalition government, and the adoption of a liberal constitution, all of which marked the period of democratic transition. Meanwhile, Cambodia received large amounts of international assistance, and the time has now come for more study of its impact on democratic politics in this country. The UN, at the invitation of the Cambodian signatories of the agreement signed in Paris, intervened in the country to prepare and organize a free and fair national election, which took place in May 1993. Cambodia subsequently emerged as one of the most aid-dependent countries in the world.4 Donors also showed varying degrees of interest in promoting democracy in this country.5 Moreover, the total volume of international assistance over\n\nResearch Methodology: Cambodia as Case Study 35\n\nthe past decade remained substantial. By 2006, the total disbursement of all assistance may have amounted to $6 billion. One word of caution, though: no one knew exactly how much donors disbursed the annual assistance they pledged. Peter Leuprecht, for instance, warned that, ‘When I acted as SP [UN Special Representative to Cambodia], I discovered that disbursement is a very serious issue. The budget is one thing, the reality is often quite different’.6 This study thus raises the question of ‘measurement’: how long should one expect a political regime to take in becoming consolidated? The historical picture of Western democracy, as noted by Schmitter, proves more complex than some proponents of democratization have realized. For instance, democracy in Britain took centuries (not decades) to achieve consolidation, going through various stages, such as nation building, the establishment of civil control over the military establishment, the decline of arbitrary power, the increased protection of private property, the creation of an entrepreneurial bourgeoisie, and the introduction of civic culture.7 This study chose a more limited timeframe. For some scholars, political regimes can become sufﬁciently consolidated within a relatively short period of time (between three and seven years).8 Some contend the regimes in East-Central Europe consolidated their democracy in ﬁve years. This marks an ambitious timeframe, especially for post-war societies under long-time authoritarian rule. For societies racked by war and destruction, a period between 12 and 15 years may seem more reasonable: it allows us more time to see if the process of consolidation proceeds. Other scholars thus think that democracy becomes consolidated when it has endured for 12 years.9 This study focuses on a 13-year period (from 1993 to the end of 2006). A period longer than this may help, but if a democratic regime emerges and lasts for 13 years, we can assess whether it becomes more consolidated, or less.\n\nA proposition and hypotheses Although this study relies exclusively on a single country case (Cambodia), it seeks to formulate and test a proposition and a set of hypotheses. It does not strictly follow in the footsteps of scientiﬁc positivism/behavioralism associated with techniques of statistical analysis based on quantitative data.10 CRI, however, takes the advice given by Gerardo Munck, who notes that confusion and obscurity exist in academic attempts to explain the relationships between key concepts and variables.11 Moreover, he correctly contends that ‘the procedures for\n\n36 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\nmeasuring concepts have not been explicitly addressed or consistently applied. If theory building is to proceed in an orderly manner, it is imperative that scholars address a number of problems regarding the conceptualization and measurement of their dependent variables.’12 This book shows two important relationships between variables: between democratic regime consolidation and institutionalization (or between democratic deconsolidation and deinstitutionalization), as well as between institutionalization (and deinstitutionalization) and structural factors (as discussed in Chapter 2). Democratic consolidation and deconsolidation as processes serve as the key dependent variables, because their value depends on the value of other variables, mainly independent and intervening. Confusion prevails in democracy studies regarding dependent variables. Some carelessly treat the attitude and behavior of elites and masses as the dependent variables, but others treat them as the independent variables. This book contends that attitude and behavior constrain democratic consolidation. We measure democratic consolidation by assessing degrees of compliance with the democratic regime’s electoral procedural rules and liberal principles and norms. Democracy consolidates when elites increasingly comply with these elements. Democracy deconsolidates when elites become less compliant with or increasingly violate them. We can thus make the following hypothesis: the greater the degree of compliance with democratic elements (described earlier and below), the more consolidated a democratic regime becomes; the lower the degree of compliance, the less consolidated democracy becomes or the more dictatorial rule consolidates. The basic electoral procedural rules include the holding of elections on a regular and transparent basis and the other three electoral rules of freeness, fairness, and representation. Freeness means all citizens – regardless of sex, race, language, income, land holdings, education, or religious beliefs – enjoy the rights to have a chance to inﬂuence public policy, to vote and to run for public ofﬁce, without facing any harassments, such as political intimidation and violence before or after election days, that prevent citizens from freely exercising their political rights. Ultimately, no party can maintain the absolute certainty that it will always and deﬁnitely win. Ex ante uncertainty means that the incumbent party can lose in free and fair elections. Elections become fair only when no systematic discrimination prevails upon the electoral process. All parties have enough time to prepare for electoral competition. Short durations of election campaigns and cumbersome election-related complaint processes only\n\nResearch Methodology: Cambodia as Case Study 37\n\nserve the political interests of the ruling party. Other factors working against the rule of fairness include the uneven distribution of favors, such as vote-buying, restricted access to the mass media (especially when the state denies opposition parties the right to possess newspapers, radio and or even television stations), and other corrupt practices working in favor of the ruling party (such as the use of state resources and manpower, especially security and bureaucratic personnel). The electoral rule of fairness further means that losing parties must not reject, or seek to reverse, election outcomes as they like. Ex post irreversibility means that whoever wins elections gets to form the next government. The winning party must not use its power to make it impossible for challengers to compete in future elections or to have another chance to win. Electoral outcomes thus do not last indeﬁnitely. Losers in one election do not forever forfeit their right to compete in future elections.13 Indicators of representation include the following. This rule comes under challenge if and when elected ofﬁcials pursue their personal interests, especially in the form of corruption. Corruption, for instance, violates the idea of representation because it enriches ‘[a] narrow class of government ofﬁcials and their business cronies…at the expense of the bulk of the population’.14 Philippe Schmitter and Terry Lynn Karl note that, ‘Democracy is in jeopardy if military ofﬁcers, entrenched civil servants, or state managers retain the capacity to act independently of elected civilians or even veto decisions made by the people’s representatives.’15 Elected representatives must not subject themselves to the veto of non-elected ofﬁcials. Compliance with the liberal principle of liberty further reﬂects a growing respect for freedom of speech, freedom of association or assembly, freedom of religious belief, and other freedoms of choice. Citizens enjoy greater freedom to choose the places in which they want to live, the career they want to pursue, and the persons they wish to marry. Economic liberties, governed by the right to private property, include those that give people the right to private property and to open businesses without any undue state interference. We can hypothesize that the greater the number of civil and economic liberties, the greater the level of democratic regime consolidation. A democratic regime also becomes highly consolidated when and if all identiﬁable signiﬁcant elites become more and more compliant with the norms of accountability and non-violence. They must show a growing degree of willingness and ability to uphold the rule of law by setting up mechanisms to hold themselves accountable for their\n\n38 International Democracy Assistance for Peacebuilding\n\npolicies and actions, whether in the form of corruption or human rights violation. The norm of non-violence experiences a higher degree of compliance when politically motivated killings and injuries, especially during election times, decline, when the number of military coups also decreases, and when the number and intensity of armed or violent struggles for power drop. The norm of non-violence takes deep root when elites do not threaten to use violence against real or potential opponents. Institutionalization (and deinstitutionalization) serves as both the independent and dependent variables. As the independent variable, institutionalization inﬂuences the value of our dependent variable (democratic consolidation). As the dependent variable, institutionalization also depends on structural factors (see Chapter 2). Complex realist institutionalism deﬁnes the concept of institutions as organizations in traditional terms. If the concept means anything (including habits or cultural norms) it ‘risks becoming too diluted’ and ‘if it means everything, then it means nothing’.16 Institutionalization means the process of institutional development. Some scholars view this process as one becoming stable or sustainable.17 Both Mainwaring and Scully deﬁne institutionalization as ‘a process by which a prac"
