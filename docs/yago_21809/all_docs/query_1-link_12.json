        "text": "Conspiracy In History . . . as seen by: \"I consider this insurrection as the first formidable fruit of the Democratic Societies . . . instituted by artful and designing members [of Congress].... I see, under a display of popular and fascinating guises, the most diabolical attempts to destroy . . . the government.\" George Washington The so-called Democratic Clubs \"are so perfectly affiliated to the Parisian Jacobins that their origin from a common parent cannot possibly be mistaken.\" John Quincy Adams \"There is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\" Woodrow Wilson \"This [Federal Reserve] act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth .... When the President signs this act the invisible government by the money powers, proven to exist by the Money Trust investigation, will be legalized.\" Charles A. Lindbergh Sr. \"If the isolationists had known the full extent of the secret alliance between the United States and Britain, their demands for the President's impeachment would have rumbled like thunder through the land.\" F.D.R. biographer Robert Sherwood \"If you like conspiracy theories about secret plots to take over the world, you are going to love the administration of Jimmy Carter.\" Washington Post \"David Rockefeller is the most conspicuous representative today of the ruling class .... But what some critics see as a vast international conspiracy, he considers a circumstance of life, and just another day's work.\" Bill Moyers on public television\n\nThe lust for power is not as widely understood as is the desire for fame and fortune. Perhaps some who have obtained great notoriety feel they are entitled to rule, or that control of others is the only sensation remaining in a jaded existence. Whatever the case, those afflicted with this consuming passion are responsible for most of the wars, slavery, and human misery throughout the history of the world. The subjects of this book are those who have adopted a more sophisticated approach to power than outright conquest. They employ all the techniques of intrigue, subversion, and conspiracy to manipulate authority from behind the scenes, and share the goal of a \"New World Order\" or a global superstate to consolidate control of humanity. It is not just some mysterious \"they\" but specific and often well-known individuals and organizations described in these pages. Mr. Hoar has, from solid historical sources, provided an intriguing and scholarly examination of these conspirators — beginning with the French Revolution and continuing through the American Revolution, the Civil War, Reconstruction, robber barons and banking conspirators, the two World Wars ... and bringing the reader right up to the contemporary machinations of the Trilateralists. It makes fascinating reading; but, more than that, this book represents the one thing those who operate in the dark fear most — exposure to the light.\n\nA native of Massachusetts, William Patrick Hoar was graduated from Bowdoin College in 1967, served as a Drill Sergeant in the United States Army, and has traveled from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, from behind the Iron Curtain to the Orient. Mr. Hoar is a Contributing Editor to American Opinion, the international Conservative monthly journal of political affairs in which more than one hundred of his articles have appeared.

Men have deliberate goals for which they strive individually and collectively, the results of which — regardless of the success of their missions — become history. Private ambitions and public posturings are seldom the same, so it is healthy to be wary of the ostentatiously altruistic. It was not without reason that Henry David Thoreau prepared to flee whenever he heard that someone was on the way to do him good. That man is flawed, fallible, and roguish is no surprise to any outside the nursery, and it should not be shocking that the collective record seems worse than the sum of the parts. The historian Edward Gibbon had a professional understanding of the game, complaining that history is often \"little more than the register of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind.\" Such a registration by name, date, and place has frequently been all that the \"accidentalists\" want to discuss, ignoring the questions of why the world is run the way that it is, how, and by whom. Culpability is assigned by the winners, for the men who run things know what they are doing and do it anyway. Feathering one's own nest is applied in the making of history, economics, politics, sociology, psychology, and morality. It is also applied in writing about them. As Adam Smith observed two centuries ago in The Wealth Of Nations: \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their self-interest.\" So it is with history and the historians. The currents beneath the surface are usually the strongest and determine direction, while the casual observer sees but the reflections on top. With this in mind, we set out in the writing of these chapters to see and make\n\nx\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nclear to our readers what had been made murky by years of fashionable obfuscation. Have men conspired throughout the ages? Have they cheated and pillaged, inflated and warred, and then labored to have the best light shone upon their motives? Such questions answer themselves, but apparently must be repeatedly asked. For, as Edmund Burke expressed it: \"People will not look forward to posterity who never look backward to their ancestors.\" Or inward to themselves. Some will say that the evidence here or there in this survey is only circumstantial, or that some case is not sufficiently made because the perpetrators didn't plead guilty. To suggest that conspiracy might have been involved would be too, well, too revisionist. But the long arm of coincidence can only stretch so far. Propaganda is expected to fool most of the people some of the time, so one can only ask the honest reader to be at least equally skeptical of Establishment interpretation. Circumstantial? Take all the proof presented here, collate it with experience, and remember with Thoreau that \"some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk.\" Of course, this book does have a point of view; there is a leitmotiv. Human nature being what it is, few will enjoy being reminded of the vast evil at large in the world. During the French Revolution, for instance, the conspirator Mirabeau seriously declared that liberty \"should have for her bed mattresses of corpses.\" Accordingly, at one time, the French revolutionists had plans to kill half the population — just as was done by their Twentieth Century successors in Cambodia! The framers of the American Constitution, on the other hand, saw the terrible potential for collective evil and labored to avoid what George Washington called the \"leveling principles.\" The runaway \"turbulence and follies of democracy,\" in Edmund Randolph's phrase, must be resisted. That is why Randolph urged the Constitutional Convention to \"check . . . and to restrain, if possible, the fury of Democracy.\" Gouverneur Morris, our Minister to France during its bloody gyrations in the name of equality, actually called the unrestrained masses of people a \"reptile.\" Jefferson realized: \"In questions of power ... let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.\" As the historians Charles and Mary Beard put it in 1939, \"when the Constitution was framed no respectable person called himself a democrat.\" Which is why they created the Republic for which we stand. It is that Republic which conspirators have been laboring to wreck and submerge into a New World Order, or an all-powerful United Nations, or some way station of regional government. It would be, we are told when we dare to demand an answer, for our own benefit. Despots just love to\n\nAuthor's Preface\n\nxi\n\ndo good, the means to that end notwithstanding. Take John Dewey, the demigod of the \"Liberal\" Education Establishment. In 1916, in Ethics, Dewey maintained that whether the use of force \"is justifiable or not. . . is in substance, a question of efficiency (including economy) of means in the accomplishing of ends . . . . The criterion of value lies in the relative efficiency and economy of the expenditure of force as a means to an end.\" Bowing to bare efficiency is still obsequity. Consider the founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, Roger Baldwin, who in 1935 admitted: \"Communism is the goal.\" By age 96, in 1981, he had evolved this notion to a contention that \"world order, a one-world order, is necessary to human survival.\" One is also reminded of John Adams's writings to Thomas Jefferson: Rousseau and other revolutionary philosophers, said Adams, \"preached to the French nation liberty, until they made them the most mechanical slaves; equality till they destroyed all equity; humanity till they became weasels and African panthers; and fraternity till they cut one another's throats like Roman gladiators.\" How much better were the results of following the truly revolutionary precepts of Adam Smith. He did not appeal to the benevolence of bakers and butchers, you will recall. \"We address ourselves,\" Smith said, \"not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our necessities, but of their advantages.\" The consequence was the freed marketplace and the Industrial Revolution that lifted millions in the West from squalor. Time and again, however, statists and worshippers of big government reemerge, much like the Lernaean Hydra with multiple heads replacing each that is beaten back. Jose Ortega y Gasset rightly saw the greatest danger threatening civilization as \"State intervention\" which is \"the absorption of all spontaneous social action by the State,\" and which can lead only to the people being \"converted into fuel to feed the mere machine which is the State.\" As he predicted in 1930 in The Revolt Of The Masses: \"The result of this tendency will be fatal. Spontaneous social action will be broken up over and over again by State intervention; no new seed will be able to fructify. Society will have to live for the State, man for the governmental machine.\" Government is at root simple force and/or the threat of using it. Too much government has sapped us, just as Alexis de Tocqueville anticipated: \"The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nxii\n\npeople, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.\" There are those who are enervated by the fear of stigma, of not being seen as an orthodox interpreter of history, of being accused of seeing incipient totalitarians plotting under the beds. In the name of modernism, however, it is they who surrender skepticism. They will look at our long list of national and international \"errors\" and deny even the possibility that the fix is in. From the top, Establishment historians will contend that none of this happened because men connived to make it happen. The less such popinjays of the hour know about what they scoff at as the \"conspiracy theory\" — as if there were one set by dogma — the more they disavow its validity. If everyone on your side of the street says, for instance, that the Emperor has such a fine set of clothes, and how nice it is that he has recorded its details with the People's Academy of Haphazard History, you may think it odd to note in the face of official history to the contrary that the Emperor is naked as a jaybird. There really is none so blind as the man who will not see. Moreover, as Machiavelli pointed out: \"One who deceives will always find those who allow themselves to be deceived.\" *** A word on style: Most material in this book appeared over a decade, from 1975 to 1984, in a different format in American Opinion magazine. The emphasis has been on making the information flow in a popular and readable fashion rather than to litter the landscape with legions of op. cits. and other paraphernalia of merely academic tomes. By incorporating cited works into the body of this history we have sought to minimize the page-turning to minute type. A bibliography of volumes referred to in the text is included at the back. Finally, let me add my gratitude to my parents, John P. Hoar and Helen R. Hoar; my friend and Editor, Scott Stanley Jr.; and, my wife, Louisa Miller Hoar. W.P.H. Arlington, Massachusetts August 1984\n\nIntroduction\n\nTHOSE CONSPIRATORS who would by degrees reduce the sovereignty of the United States of America to raise in its stead a New World Order are the subjects of this intriguing yet scholarly work by William P. Hoar. Writing of such machinations, of the movers and shakers conspiring behind the scenes, the author indicates that, because of exposure by Conservatives, members of the Trilateral Commission (as one example) now comprise \"anything but a conspiracy of silence; it is in fact a relatively open collusion of the powerful, and brazen enough to own up to at least some of its aims. These admissions against interest need examining.\" Indeed. Consider how these people manipulate government. One name that springs to mind is that of international banker James P. Warburg. His father had been the chief architect of the Federal Reserve System. He was himself an early New Dealer; at age thirty-five, he was president of the International Acceptance Bank, with its interlocks to the Morgans, Rockefellers, and the funding of the Bolshevik Revolution; and, by 1932, he was director of the Bank of Manhattan. Warburg was in charge of American propaganda during World War II; supported universal disarmament after the war as well as the United World Federalists; and, was not only a member of the Council on Foreign Relations but also was a trustee of the Institute for Policy Studies, an important and influential Marxist think-tank in Washington, D.C. In short, here was a man who knew how policy was made. He admitted in his 1966 book The United States In The Postwar World that: There is a group of \" . . . bankers, industrialists, businessmen, lawyers and educators who are now and then consulted informally by the White House. Some two hundred of these prominent citizens, in various parts of the country, most of whom are on first-name terms with each other and communicate with each other by telephone, might appropriately be called\n\nxiv\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\n'The Establishment.' They are closely connected to the nation's major corporate interests and, perhaps more important, to its major universities; they are on the boards of the major foundations.\" Another witness to the sort of conspiracy with which Mr. Hoar's book is concerned was the late Georgetown professor Carroll Quigley, who acknowledged in his voluminous 1966 history Tragedy And Hope: \"There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. 1 have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies .... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown .... *** \"... the American branch of this organization (sometimes called the 'Eastern Establishment') has played a very significant role in the history of the United States in the last generation.\" Professor Quigley noted that before World War I there were \"organized semisecret groups, known as Round Table Groups, in the chief British dependencies and the United States. These still function in eight countries.\" After 1914, fronts were organized in target nations. One, \"called the Royal Institute of International Affairs, has as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group. In New York it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a front for J.P. Morgan and Company in association with the very small American Round Table Group . . . .\" These are not paranoid imaginings rising like vapors from the fever swamps, but admissions of participant members of the reigning foreign-policy elite, who are proud of what they have been doing. In Architects Of Conspiracy: An Intriguing History, William Hoar is not letting fanciful bugbears run amok either. His message is too important to need exaggeration, and this compilation speaks for itself. Chapters I and II go to the roots of things by comparing and contrasting the French, American, and Industrial Revolutions. Whereas Thomas Paine claimed \"the cause of the French people is that of . . . the whole world,\" George Washington denounced Jacobins in America for trying to \"destroy the government.\" Our first President warned against \"self-created societies\" which \"sow seeds of jealousy and distrust.\" If they\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nwere not exposed, said Washington, \"adieu to all government in this country, except mob and club government.\" Economic freedom was the message carried by Adam Smith, who called the regulations of mercantilism the \"impertinent badges of slavery.\" Little else, contended Smith, \"is required to carry a state to the highest degrees of affluence ... but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice.\" The Industrial Revolution was itself made possible by repeal of the income tax. Counterpoints are the growth of a free America and the destruction sought and wrought by those who would, through anarchy, bring down all. Under James Polk, for example, American territory increased by 1.2 million square miles; Andrew Jackson, a believer in Manifest Destiny (Chapter III), thwarted the central bank and paid off the National Debt. On the other hand, anarchists here and abroad (Chapter VI) were already being used by conspirators to try to create a vacuum in which carefully organized revolutionary forces might seize political control. Hatred and plunder at government behest are central to Chapters IV and V. During the so-called Reconstruction of the American South, the radical Republicans looted the defeated states and organized a black voting bloc, while denying white former Confederates the right to vote or hold office and taxing them further into poverty. The celebrated Robber Barons wanted subsidies; sought restrictive government-backed monopolies; and, bought legislators, the judiciary, and regulators — using government to expand their power. The manipulations of Andrew Carnegie, a prototypical insider, whose legacy of conspiracy remains with us today, are outlined in Chapter VII. Carnegie funds, for example, were used to propagandize for the United Nations (his political heirs having failed to get us into the League of Nations), with the U.N.'s founding Secretary General, Soviet agent Alger Hiss, subsequently becoming a president of the Carnegie Endowment. The watershed year of 1913 is examined in Chapter VIII, when the federal income tax was authorized and implemented; when the American states were weakened and \"democracy\" enhanced by the direct election of Senators; and, when insiders of international finance pushed through the Federal Reserve Act that allowed inflation and depression at the will of its masters. World War I, the Versailles Treaty, and the League of Nations are subjects of Chapters IX and X. We learn how Colonel E.M. House, Woodrow Wilson's \"alter ego,\" began work on what he called \"A World Constitution\" in 1915; but how, despite the best efforts of conspirators, the U.S. Senate refused ratification of American participation in the League of Nations with which House and his co-conspirators hoped to initiate their scheme.\n\nxvi\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nMen who made a difference for freedom are featured in Chapters XI and XII. There we see Henry Ford cutting the ground from under Marxist propaganda by paying the highest industrial wage in America, inaugurating the eight-hour day, and sharing profits with the workers — leading to greater efficiency and more profits. \"This is neither charity nor wages,\" said Ford, \"but. . . efficiency engineering.\" We also learn how the Lindberghs, father and son, fought the power brokers. The senior Lindbergh, for example, opposed those who would control our money through the Federal Reserve Act; aviator hero Charles Jr., like his father, strove fiercely against efforts to drag us into world war. In Chapters XIII and XIV, Mr. Hoar shreds many of the myths spread about facism, national socialism, and populism. He quotes a top Italian fascist as claiming that the \"maximum of liberty coincides with the maximum of state force\"; he quotes Hitler as saying in 1941 that \"basically National Socialism and Marxism are the same.\" As for the Populists, Hoar explains: \"While they were swinging battering rams at the front door, their programs were slipped in the back door by the major parties. By asking for more federal government they simply played into the hands of the would-be monopolists.\" We discover in Chapters XV and XVI that it was Herbert Hoover who first tried to spend us out of penury and the Great Depression. For example, government spending rose forty-two percent in 1931 alone. While there had been a vast credit expansion through the Twenties, the brakes had been suddenly applied by the Fed which depressed the money stock by more than one-third between 1929 and 1933. As a result, under Hoover, the Gross National Product fell by almost a half. A world in economic depression was about to become a world aflame. Hitler so admired Stalin that he made him a partner in ' 'a new distribution of the world.\" This included their mutual smashing of Poland after the pact of the dictators, as described in Chapters XVII and XVIII, and the starting of World War II. The Kremlin congratulated Hitler on his Blitzkrieg even as Soviet agents preached \"pacifism\" in the West. As for Poland, F.D.R. covered up the Red massacre of captured Polish officers, and (as the Communists gained control) Churchill declared he would not \"wreck the peace of Europe because of a quarrel between Poles.\" Franklin Roosevelt, who said in 1932 that he regarded \"reduction in Federal spending as one of the most important issues of this campaign,\" is the centerpiece of Chapters XIX and XX. When they failed to ignite an \"incident\" to bring the U.S. into the European war, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed on provoking Japan. The question was how to maneuver Tokyo \"into firing the first shot.\" Churchill (Chapter XXI) was an old hand at intrigue who had initiated the terror bombing of cities four months\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nbefore the first air strike on London. Like F.D.R. at Pearl Harbor, he subsequently had advance knowledge of a retaliatory raid on Coventry but, hoping to rally his people by the outrage, refused to warn the population. Truman became a belated member of the \"Big Three,\" and it was he who arranged the postwar \"peace\" with Stalin. Ignoring intelligence reports, the President paid a huge price for \"Uncle Joe's\" one-week war against Japan — one of many points touched in Chapter XXII. Though the Japanese were suing for peace, Truman ordered that atom bombs be dropped on them. During the Korean War (Chapter XXIII), he fired General MacArthur — after the brilliant Inchon landing and destruction of the North Korean Army. Granting sanctuary to the Communist Chinese and recalling MacArthur prevented victory. As shown in a survey of much more serious Presidential offenses in Chapter XXIV, we learn that Watergate was far from the crime of the century. And the destruction of Indochina, with the concomitant attempts to suppress the results of our betrayal (as seen from the vantage point of the Seventies in Chapter XXV) is a brutal example of what has happened over and over again. Ask the Afghans. This is typical Communism in practice, as bestial as the Reign of Terror in the days of the French Revolution. Nevertheless, there are still those who press for America to \"negotiate\" with the Communist gangsters in the Kremlin, despite the shameful record of past summits, which Mr. Hoar summarizes in Chapter XXVI. Who exerts the push for dealing with the Communists? None other than the same self-perpetuating Establishment that has been in charge of our disastrous foreign policy for decades. It was riding high before and during the Carter Administration (Chapter XXVII) when a spokesman for a World Order \"project,\" funded by the Carnegie Endowment and the Rockefeller Foundation, claimed there \"is no longer a question of whether or not there will be world government by the year 2000.\" Of necessity, according to a prominent member of the influential Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, the \" 'house of world order' will have to be built from the bottom up rather than the top down. ...an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.\" That Trilateral Commission, once criticized by Ronald Reagan, now apparently has his support. These are supposedly the \"best brains in the world,\" yet (as described in Chapter XXVIII) they want the U.S. to disarm and avoid missile defenses; to increase funding to the backward nations; and, to become partners with the Communist regimes we continue to strengthen. The head of the Commission is David Rockefeller, the\n\nxviii\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nlongtime chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank which has a branch in Moscow. Rockefeller says, however, that he is not the \"cabalist-in-chief\" of a conspiracy in \"cahoots with the Kremlin.\" Of course, remarks an apologist for the Rockefellers, the C.F.R., and the Trilater-alists, \"what some critics see as a vast international conspiracy,\" Rockefeller considers \"just another day's work.\" To buy that nonsense would be to accept the notion that men do not will the obvious consequences of their actions and to embrace a mockery and a delusion. What we are seeing today is the most obvious push that the advocates of the New World Order dare to muster. But we believe we can take heart in the Roman historian's maxim: \"Treachery, though at first very cautious, in the end betrays itself.\" And, as William Pitt put it: \"You may ravage, you cannot conquer. It is impossible. You cannot conquer the Americans.\" The reason, of course, is that once aware of the nature and treachery of their would-be conquerors, Americans fight fiercely for their liberties. This up-todate compendium of the sinister deeds of those who conspire to rule the world promises to make a huge contribution to that needed awareness. Which is why, as Chairman of The John Birch Society, I am very happy to introduce this important work by William P. Hoar. A. CLIFFORD BARKER Newport News, Virginia\n\nChapter I American Republic And French Revolution\n\nIT WAS the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the epoch of constitutional government in the United States, it was the epoch of revolution in France. And the French Revolution not only split America's Founding Fathers, but left its mark on revolutionary strategies for centuries. As Russian anarchist Prince Kropotkin wrote in 1908: \"What we learn today from the study of the Great Revolution is that it was the source and origin of all the present communist, anarchist, and socialist conceptions.\" To many, what was happening in France at first seemed benign if not beneficent. \"A great revolution had commenced in that country,\" wrote John Marshall, later Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, \"the first stage of which was completed by limiting the powers of the monarch, and by the establishment of a popular assembly. In no other part of the globe was this revolution hailed with more joy than in America. The influence it would have on the affairs of the world was not then distinctly foreseen; and the philanthropist, without becoming a political partisan, rejoiced in the event. On this subject, therefore, but one sentiment existed.\" (The Life Of John Marshall, Volume II, Albert J. Beveridge, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1916) But the fact is that a number of Americans were skeptical of the French Revolution from its beginning. Among these was the always perceptive John Adams. Biographer Page Smith reports that Adams \"from the first moment viewed it with misgivings . . . . At the same time he could not forbear to point out 'that the form of government they have adopted' could be 'nothing more than a transient experiment. An obstinate adherence to it would involve France 'in great and lasting calamities.' A single assembly would be dominated by demagogues and the result would be repeated upheavals and disorder — a succession of bloody contentions.\" (John Adams, Volume II, Garden City, Doubleday, 1962)\n\n2\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nAdams proved no mean prophet. While the French Revolution is presented in the government schools as a peasants' revolt against bloody tyranny, this was so only in the fiction of such brilliant polemicists as Charles Dickens, for it resulted from nothing short of a conspiracy against the very best of French civilization. After all, as Professor Douglas Johnson has noted, the Eighteenth Century \"had not been a bad one for France as a whole. The population had risen from about twenty to twenty-six millions; no great plagues or other catastrophes had occurred; no wars had been fought on French soil; industry had thrived; the general rise of prices from about 1730 to the eve of the Revolution was a sign of the prosperity of the producing classes; overseas trade multiplied. The Bourbon monarchy was the first monarch of Europe, and no signs of disloyalty to it could be detected in France.\" (The French Revolution, New York, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1970) Even Thomas Jefferson, who had been led to believe otherwise by radical Frenchmen, told Lafayette in 1787: \"I have been pleased to find among the people a less degree of physical misery than I had expected. They are generally well clothed, and have plenty of food, not animal indeed, but vegetable, which is as wholesome.\" Unfortunately, the good times were not to continue. By 1789, the year in which the Revolution is normally said to have begun, shortages of food were being consciously created by one of the prime conspirators, the Duc d'Orleans. There can be no doubt, confirmed historian Nesta Webster in The French Revolution, \"that the famine of 1789 was deliberately engineered by the agents of the duke, and that by this means the people were driven to the pitch of desperation necessary to produce the Revolution.\" And the Orleanistes were joined in such intrigues by agents of the Barvarian-bred Illuminati who operated out of the Club Breton and were later known as the Jacobins. Ruffians and street toughs were hired and moved about Paris like pawns on a board; the Bastille, with but seven prisoners, was beseiged to make a show; and, the gory Revolution was begun. Soon one of the Jacobins devised a scheme which produced \"the Great Fear\" when a phony story was spread simultaneously throughout France that a foreign invasion was imminent. The panic that resulted provided the conspirators with the disruption and chaos they desired to persuade King Louis XVI to accept one radical political concession after another. On the scene as our Minister in Paris was Gouverneur Morris, the conservative statesman who had been the architect of much of the U.S. Constitution. Morris wrote from France in July of 1789 that \"this country is at present as near to anarchy as society can approach without dissolution... The authority of the King and the nobility is completely subdued, but\n\nAmerican Republic And French Revolution\n\n3\n\nyet I tremble for the constitution.'' (The Diary And Letters Of Gouverneur Morris, Volume I, New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1888) The French merchants controlling the market had soon turned the contrived food shortages into large profits by raising the prices, observed historians Will and Ariel Durant, and \"barges carrying food to the towns were attacked and pillaged en route; disorder and insecurity disrupted transportation. Paris was running riot with criminals. The countryside was so subject to marauding robbers that in several provinces the peasants armed themselves in their 'Great Fear' of these lawless hordes; in six months 400,000 guns were acquired by the alarmed citizens. When the Great Fear subsided, the peasants decided to use their weapons against tax collectors, monopolists and feudal lords.\" (The Age Of Napoleon, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1975) It was less than three months after the inauguration of George Washington that the Bastille was stormed. But even at this early date, and with worldwide favorable propaganda for the Revolution, it is instructive to see the diplomatic reaction of our first President when he was sent by Lafayette the \"main key\" of the \"fortress of despotism.\" It was \"a tribute which I owe as a son to my adoptive father, as an aide-de-camp to my general, and as a missionary of liberty to its patriarch,\" declared Lafayette. President Washington did hang the key to the Bastille \"in the Presidential Mansion, but added, so as not to prejudice the foreign policy of the United States, an engraved portrait of Louis XVI.\" (Washington: The Indispensable Man, James T. Flexner, Boston, Little, Brown, 1969) Indeed, there were a number of Americans, wrote the senior Henry Cabot Lodge, who were never deceived by the French Revolution, \"even by their hopes. Hamilton, who 'divined Europe,' as Talleyrand said, and Gouverneur Morris, studying the situation on the spot with keen and practical observation, soon apprehended the truth, while others more or less quickly followed in their wake. But Washington, whom no one ever credited with divination, and who never crossed the Atlantic, saw the realities of the thing sooner, and looked more deeply into the future than anybody else.\" (George Washington, Volume II, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1898) Nevertheless, President Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison were named citizens of the new French Republic, being among only eighteen foreigners so honored. Also in this group was Prussian baron Anacharsis Clootz, an Illuminist conspirator who was later guillotined when the Revolution began to devour its own. (James Madison: Father Of The Constitution, 1787-1800, Irving Brant, Indianapolis, Bobbs-Merrill, 1950) Another favorite of the French, revolutionist or otherwise, was Benjamin Franklin — probably the most famous and popular American in\n\n4\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nEurope, who was ever ready to engage in intrigue. Leading conspirators of the Revolution consulted with the Doctor: men such as Mirabeau (dubbed a scoundrel by Gouverneur Morris), the fanatical Marat and the bloody-handed Robespierre, who supposedly \"wanted information on the lightning rod.\" (The Private Franklin, Claude-Anne Lopez and Eugenia W. Herbert, New York, Norton, 1975) Franklin had in fact hailed the 1787 Assembly of the Notables, and contended that having served an apprenticeship to Liberty in the United States the French were now prepared to take the message to all Europe. But, reports Franklin's biographer James Parton, by 1789 the good Doctor \"began to tremble for his old friends, and for France. The chief actors in the fearful scene, Lafayette, Mirabeau, Necker, Brissot, the King, the Queen, de Vergennes, and others, he had been in the habit of meeting for nine years, entertaining and entertained; and for many of them he cherished the warmest regard. The news of the dissensions in the States-general, of the famine, of the fall of the Bastille, the march on Versailles, the lamppost executions, the confinement of the King and Queen in their palace, filled him with anxiety . . . . Franklin feared for his friends more than he hoped for France.\" (Life And Times Of Benjamin Franklin, Volume II, Boston, Ticknor and Fields, 1867) Whatever the case, Ben Franklin died in 1790 before the worst of the terror had begun. Still, there was already terror enough. Gouverneur Morris, our first Minister to France under the Constitution, wrote to his business associate Robert Morris (no relation) concerning the owner of a French quarry who brought legal action because so many corpses had been dumped there that the bodies \"choked it up so that he could not get men to work at it.\" These victims were, said Morris, \"the best people,\" slaughtered \"without form of trial and the bodies thrown like dead dogs into the first hole that offered.\" Morris wrote in his diary: \"At dinner I sit next to M. de Lafayette who tells me I injure the cause, for that my sentiments are continually quoted against the good party. I seize this opportunity to tell him that I am opposed to the democracy from regard to liberty.\" This was of course no Revolution of liberation, but one of oppression. Thus a Nazi idealogue like Goebbels could later declare with pleasure that he \"paid homage to the French Revolution for all the possibilities of life and development which it had brought to the people. In this sense, if you like, I am a democrat.\" In fact Hitler called the Nazi revolt \"the exact counterpart of the French Revolution.\" (Leftism, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, New Rochelle, Arlington House, 1974) Despite its horrors, the French Revolution enjoyed considerable support from influential Americans. Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, and the Anglo-American Thomas Paine, to cite a few,\n\nAmerican Republic And French Revolution\n\n5\n\nwere all enthusiastic about it. In this matter, as in so many others, Secretary of State Jefferson found himself at odds with Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. Whereas Jefferson hoped in 1791 that \"so beautiful a revolution\" would sweep the world, Hamilton assuredly did not. (See To Covet Honor, Holmes Alexander, Boston, Western Islands, 1977.) In France, said Hamilton of our former Minister to Paris, Jefferson had seen \"government only on the side of its abuses. He drank freely of the French philosophy, in religion, in science, in politics. He came from France in the moment of fermentation, which he had a share in exciting, and in the passions and feelings of which he shared both from temperament and situation.\" Jefferson became a near fanatic in his revolutionary zeal. He claimed to believe that \"most Frenchmen were Jacobins. Their excesses, if one called them such, reflected that national will.\" (George Washington & The French Revolution, Louis Martin Sears, Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 1960) Which certainly would have astonished the French revolutionaries. Even Danton said in September of 1792 that \"the Republicans are an infinitesimal minority ... the rest of France is attached to the monarchy.\" Actually it was the liberality of King Louis in his regard for the French people that led to his downfall; each reform to which he acceded, each change, was followed by new demands — and when violence broke out the King hesitated to send troops against his own people. Jefferson, meanwhile, was willing to overlook the drumhead execution of the innocent best of France because \"time and truth will rescue & embalm their memories, while their posterity will be enjoying that very liberty for which they would never have hesitated to offer up their lives. The liberty of the whole earth was depending on the issue of the contest. ...\" Rather than see the French Revolution fail, wrote State Secretary Jefferson in 1793, \"I would have seen half the earth desolated. Were there but an Adam & Eve left in every country, & left free, it would be better than it now is.\" To the Virginian, \"the form our own government was to take depended ... on the events of France.\" (John Adams) It is hard to imagine a more outrageous declaration. Even before the Massacres of September and the Reign of Terror, here is how the supposed liberty of France was acquired, and the monarchy deposed. Nesta Webster draws this compilation from historians of the time: \" '... a wretched undercook, who had not time to escape, was seized by these tigers, thrust into a copper, and in this state exposed to the heat of the furnace. Then falling on the provisions every one seizes what he can lay hands upon. One carries off chickens on a spit; another a turbot; that one a carp from the Rhine as large as himself . . . monsters with human\n\n6\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nfaces collected in hundreds under the porch of the Escalier du Midi, and danced amidst torrents of blood and wine. A murderer played the violin beside the corpses, and thieves, with their pockets full of gold, hanged other thieves on the banisters.' Still worse horrors took place that cannot be written, nameless indecencies, hideous debaucheries, ghastly mutilations of the dead, and again, as after the siege of the Bastille, cannibal orgies. Before great fires, hastily kindled in the apartment, 'cutlets of Swiss [Guards]' were grilled and eaten; the actor Grammont — one of the earliest hirelings of the Duc d'Orleans, and the last man to insult the Queen on her way to the scaffold — in a fit of revolutionary frenzy drank down a glass of blood.\" The instigators of this mob, trained in the Jacobin Clubs, were nowhere to be seen. The revolutionary leaders, you see, were in hiding until the danger had passed. They were indeed the same Jacobins who professed belief in the natural goodness of man, and declared their desire to install a puritanical regime without vices. (See The Jacobins, Clarence Crane Brinton, New York, Russell & Russell, 1961.) Certainly Thomas Jefferson knew what was being done in the name of liberty. He had personally seen the first brands of the fire of revolution, and had written as follows to John Jay in 1789: \"The city [Paris] is as yet not entirely quieted. Every now and then summary execution is done on individuals by individuals, and nobody is in condition to ask for what, and by whom .... The details from the country are as distressing as I had apprehended they would be . . . . Abundance of chateaux are certainly burnt and burning, and not a few lives sacrificed. The worst is probably over in this city, but I do not know whether it is so in the country.\" (Jefferson; The Scene Of Europe, 1784-1789, Marie Kimball, New York, Coward-McCann, 1950) Jefferson proved a poor oracle, for the terror in the cities was just beginning. Perhaps if he had lived through the experience of being a military commander like Hamilton or Washington he would have had less to say about being willing to see \"half the earth desolated\" by burnings and massacres to feed the Revolution. In England a great friend of the American Revolution named Edmund Burke had meanwhile published his scathing Reflections On The Revolution In France, which ran through ten editions in its first year. An attempt to refute Burke was made by the revolutionary Thomas Paine in Rights Of Man, an appeal to revolution in England that received the endorsement of Jefferson; got Paine indicted for treason in England; and, helped make him an honorary citizen of Revolutionary France. In Paris and named a member of the French Convention in 1792, Paine voted against the death of Louis XVI. Always intriguing, he was imprisoned\n\nAmerican Republic And French Revolution\n\n7\n\nfor a year (1793-1794) by the Revolutionary Government and released only at the request of U.S. Minister to France James Madison. It was widely believed that Paine's incendiary writings made possible the murder of Louis. A baronet informed George Washington of Paine that true,\"he voted against it, but his principles were too deeply rooted in the minds of the People; that Idea of Equality stimulated the Dregs of the People to all the Massacres; I hope in God, he will never revisit America, for he might distract your now happy Government.\" {George Washington & The French Revolution) In 1802, Jefferson did invite Paine to return to the United States. But by then reports of the massacres of the French Revolution had resulted in his being discredited and Paine died seven years later an ostracized and obscure man. Tom Paine's involvement in conspiracies had made him many enemies, among whom was Gouverneur Morris. Paine had written to Jefferson to oppose Morris's appointment to France. Indeed he was not alone among radicals opposing Morris, whose nomination passed the Senate by a vote of sixteen to eleven. Though both were influential in America's War for Independence, Tom Paine and Gouverneur Morris were poles apart. \" 'Cocksure,' was the way Morris described him,\" reports Yvon Bizardel. \"Paine was eaten up with vanity and undoubtedly suffering the effects of too much whiskey. In his journal Morris wrote of their conversation: 'I tell him that the disordered state of things in France works against all schemes of Reformation, both here and elsewhere. He declares that the riots and outrages in France are nothing at all. It is not worthwhile to contest such declarations, I tell him therefore that as I am sure he does not believe what he says, I shall not dispute it.' \" (The First Expatriates, translated by June Wilson and Cornelia Higginson, New York, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975) Likewise, Gouverneur Morris did not gladly suffer Thomas Jefferson, saying he was once with the fiery Virginian for an hour, \"which was at least fifty minutes too much.\" Morris called him a theorist who \"is desirous of annihilating distinctions of order. How far such views may be right respecting mankind in general is, I think, extremely problematical, but with respect to this nation [France], I am sure it is wrong and cannot eventuate well.\" (Gouverneur Morris: Witness Of Two Revolutions, Daniel Walther, New York, Funk & Wagnalls, 1934) As Morris saw developments in 1792: \"France is on the high road to despotism. They have made the common mistake that to enjoy liberty it is necessary only to abolish authority.\" In fact, Morris predicted in a letter to Washington in 1793 that the result would be a consulship of probably three men, from which would come a single dictator. Which is exactly how Napoleon came to power.\n\n8\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nIn the meantime, France was suffering military difficulties and had declared war on Britain. Now the Revolutionary Government in Paris seemed even more important in America and the debate about what was happening raged among our Founding Fathers. France's example, worried the thoughtful John Adams, could \"produce anarchy among us.\" Men like Danton, Robespierre, and Marat are furies, he wrote his wife. \"Dragons' teeth have been sown in France and come up as monsters.\" The U.S., the Vice President contended, has its own \"Robespierres and Marats whose wills are good to do mischief but the flesh is weak. They cannot yet persuade the people to follow them.\" A point of contention was a 1778 treaty with France which committed us to be a fighting ally and to defend the French West Indies. But this was a European war, and so young a country as our own could hardly be helped by being drawn into further war with Great Britain. Alexander Hamilton argued that we should stand aside and leave the matter to a test of arms among the principals. \"This effort is not prudent, is not commendable,\" he said. All patriots \"will scorn to stand on any but purely American ground.\" (To Covet Honor) While Jefferson claimed to dislike the idea of war he nonetheless called our neutrality \"pusillanimous.\" The country was in a frenzy of seriously mistaken enthusiasm over what had happened in France. \"The papers were full of news of a celebration at Boston in honor of the masters of the Terror. A tax of three dollars a head was imposed to pay for a great 'Civic Feast' in honor of the French comrades, and the Boston Federalists were afraid not to pay it for fear of being denounced as aristocrats. The democratical distemper was worse than the smallpox, and Adams was pleased at the news that John Quincy had dared to decry this infatuation within the sacred walls of Faneuil Hall.\" (John Adams) From Charleston to Boston, cannons were fired to salute French victories. \"One observer noted that in America more gunpowder was fired in celebrating French triumphs than the French ever spent in achieving them.\" In a Philadelphia waxworks, the most popular exhibit was the execution of Louis XVI. Families \"saw the knife fall and the King's lips turn from red to blue. Children were admitted at half price.\" John Adams called all of this \"sound and fury,\" but to Thomas Jefferson \"it was music.\" (John Jay, Frank Monaghan, New York, Bobbs-Merrill, 1935) Radical propaganda aligned the French cause in the popular mind with that of American liberty. \"Americans decried titles and all that smacked of monarchy. Men and women addressed each other as 'Citizen' and by such contrived female variants as 'Citess.' They raised liberty poles and wore the tricolored cockade everywhere; they sang French songs; and they\n\nAmerican Republic And French Revolution\n\n9\n\ndrank toasts to French principles.\" (Entangling Alliance, Alexander DeConde, Durham, Duke University Press, 1958) It was at this time that George Washington issued the Proclamation of Neutrality — though at Jefferson's suggestion the word neutrality was left out in the hopes that Great Britain might make some diplomatic concessions to be absolutely assured of American neutrality.\" (A Diplomatic History Of The United States, Samuel Flagg Bemis, New York, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1965) Britain made no further concession, but the proclamation was soon taken on both sides of the ocean as declaring us neutral. As for the 1778 alliance, Washington here accepted Jefferson's advice and chose to postpone consideration of all treaties made with the pre-revolutionary Government. (Hamilton had wanted them declared inapplicable, and they were eventually dissolved under President John Adams.) For the French a neutral United States might prove more helpful than if we had confirmed the military treaties since our country did not have the naval strength to keep open our ports in the face of war with Britain. The new French Minister, Citizen Edmond Genet, had plans to use this country as a base from which to organize raids on the commerce and colonies of Britain and Spain, to fit out ships for attacks against the British fleet, and also to enlist Americans aboard French ships. Secret instructions from Revolutionary France directed Genet to propagandize among the Americans, says Professor Alexander DeConde, \"to influence them so they would favor France in her struggle. Assured of the favorable disposition of Jefferson and Madison, he had orders to tamper with American domestic politics for whatever advantage might accrue to France.\" (Entangling Alliance) Fortunately the U.S. Government moved quickly to prohibit the fitting out of French privateers or recruitment of American crews. President Washington ignored Secretary of State Jefferson, who was of course favorable to Revolutionary France, and gave the job of enforcing the neutrality to Treasury Secretary Hamilton's customs officers. Jefferson offered to resign. Genet, who had been received with wild approval in several large U.S. cities, was busy inland as well as at sea. \"Hatching or abetting various plots, he had planned to launch hostile military expeditions from American soil with American troops against Spanish and English possessions in North America.\" (Entangling Alliance) And the French Revolution became even more entangled in our affairs with the rise here of French-hatched communes — or Democratic Clubs, as Citizen Genet called them. Despite America's neutrality policy, these revolutionary anti-Federalist societies were pro-French and antiBritish, and their incendiary\n\n10\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\npropaganda was soon pandemic. They appeared, in Genet's words, \"as if by magic from one end of the continent to the other.\" These revolutionary cells were organized to make serious trouble, and their influence was subversive to say the least. At a gathering in Philadelphia, for example, guests toasted Citizen Genet but refused to extend the same courtesy to President Washington. Here was an association, said Noah Webster, \"which must be crushed in its infancy or it would certainly crush the government.\" In the words of John Quincy Adams, these so-called Democratic Clubs \"are so perfectly affiliated to the Parisian Jacobins that their origin from a common parent cannot possibly be mistaken.\" (Entangling Alliance) Soon even the patient George Washington became convinced that these \"self-created societies\" were meant to \"sow seeds of jealousy and distrust among the people.\" (To Covet Honor) And this was certainly happening. Mobs in city streets threatened the Federalists who stood with Hamilton. Washington later recalled: \"I early gave it as my opinion to the confidential characters around me that if these societies were not counteracted (not by prosecutions, the ready way to make them grow stronger), or did not fall into disesteem\" about their real purposes instituted \"by their father Genet, . . . they would shake the government to its foundations.\" (Washington: The Indispensable Man) Later Washington would speak more directly about the spread of the \"doctrine of the Illuminati, and the principles of Jacobinism,\" as a result of the Democratic Societies established in our country by Revolutionary France. President Washington believed the revolutionary Democratic Clubs were responsible for the so-called Whiskey Rebellion. Whatever the case, it was certainly the spirit of the French Revolution that sustained it. Albert Beveridge comments that \"when the troops sent out to put down the insurrection reached Harrisburg, they found the French flag flying over the courthouse.\" President Washington said: \"I consider this insurrection as the first formidable fruit of the Democratic Societies . . . instituted by artful and designing members [of Congress] .... I see, under a display of popular and fascinating guises, the most diabolical attempts to destroy . . . the government.\" He further declared: \"That they have been the fomenters of the western disturbance admits of no doubt.\" If \"the daring and factious spirit\" is not crushed, \"adieu to all government in this country, except mob and club government.\" (The Life Of John Marshall) The Presidential denunciations devastated the neo-Jacobin clubs. By 17951796 \"most of them had apparently disappeared. Weakened from within and assailed from without, they did not survive Washington's second term.\" (Entangling Alliance) At least they had gone underground.\n\nAmerican Republic And French Revolution\n\n11\n\nAs for Citizen Genet, he became reckless and alienated former friends in Jefferson's Republican party. His progress in this country had been \"marked by founding Jacobin clubs corresponding roughly to the Communist cells of our own time.\" (The Oxford History Of The American People, Samuel Eliot Morison, New York, Oxford University Press, 1965) Genet \"appealed to the people over the head of their government to support him. This was next to encouraging revolution. It had been done with success by French republican diplomatists in the smaller states of Europe, but it did not succeed in the United States.\" (A Diplomatic History Of The United States) Even Thomas Jefferson now called him a madman. Washington requested Genet's recall, and it was eventually accepted in return for the recall from Paris of the conservative Gouverneur Morris. But the President charitably allowed the French conspirator, who correctly feared the guillotine, to live out his life in our country — a nation whose orderly traditions he had labored to subvert. The subversion spun off by the conspirators behind the French Revolution did not disappear at once, nor was it forgotten overnight. New England clergymen continued to insist from their pulpits \"that the French Revolution was a vast conspiracy directed by the Illuminati of Bavaria against all government, religion and morality.\" And John Jay and others agreed that \"the Jacobins are still more numerous, more desperate, and more active in this country than is generally supposed.\" (John Jay) Indeed, the Jacobin clubs in our country proved \"so divisive that popular feeling forced the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts. The acts were, of course, eventually repealed; but by that time they had succeeded in dispersing the subversive influence of the American Jacobins.\" (Seventeen Eighty Nine, American Opinion Preview Series, 1968) Popular resentment of Revolutionary France was further aroused with the attempted bribe of the U.S. Government by Talleyrand's agents — the socalled XYZ Affair, made public in 1798. And \"an undeclared naval war between the countries did take place, 1799-1800.\" (The Rebirth Of Liberty, Clarence B. Carson, New Rochelle, Arlington House, 1973) France's conduct, said Patrick Henry in 1799, \"has made it the interest of the great family of mankind to wish the downfall of her present government.\" For she destroys, said Henry, \"the great pillars of all government and of social life, — I mean virtue, morality, and religion. This is the armor, my friend, and this alone, that renders us invincible.\" Shortly thereafter, of course, there was a coup in France with Bonaparte becoming First Consul. The 1778 treaties with France were completely abandoned as Europe continued its bloody marches in the\n\n12\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nNapoleonic wars. The young and independent Republic of the United States had survived subversion by a European conspiracy and now had breathing space in which to recuperate. The disease, however, had not been conquered and would appear again.\n\nChapter II Industrial Revolution: Freeing The Market\n\nMERCANTILISM was the economic system that dominated Western Europe from around 1500 to the time of the Industrial Revolution. It was a system of state control and national economic rivalry, which sought to accumulate precious bullion for the state through a politically planned economy involving taxation of imports, promotion of favored exports, and exploitation of colonies. Regulation was the byword of the day. Like contemporary Marxism, mercantilism held \"that there is an irreconcilable conflict of interests among men and groups of men. The gain of one is invariably the damage of others; no man profits but by the loss of others .... It was the essence of the teachings of Mercantilism. ...\" (Theory And History, Ludwig von Mises, New Rochelle, Arlington House, 1969) Colonies such as those Great Britain had in America were viewed as economic markets whose purpose was to serve Mother England. Such colonies, observed Edward P. Cheyney, \"were controlled by the English government largely for their commercial and other forms of economic value. The production of goods needed in England but not produced there, such as sugar, tobacco, tar, and lumber, was encouraged. But the manufacture of such goods as could be exported from England was prohibited. The purchase of slaves in Africa and their exportation to the West Indies was encouraged, partly because they were paid for in Africa by English manufactured goods, partly because their use in the colonies made the supply of sugar and some other products plentiful and cheap.\" (An Introduction To The Industrial And Social History Of England, New York, Macmillan, 1929) Under the Navigation Acts, for example, certain English merchants were assured of a monopoly of trade with the colonies in America, the East Indies, and Africa. Movement of cargoes to and from the colonies could only be legally done on English ships built in the motherland and\n\n14\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\ncrewed by British seamen. Indeed, our own War for Independence was in large part a reaction to the government controls imposed by British mercantilism. London's economic prohibitions and regulations, said America's friend Edmund Burke in the House of Commons, resulted in \"the system of a monopoly. No trade was let loose from that constraint, but merely to enable the colonists to dispose of what in the course of your trade you could not take; or to enable them to dispose of such articles as we forced upon them, and for which, without some degree of liberty, they could not pay.\" Doubtless the most famous critic of the mercantilist system was Adam Smith, professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow University and author of The Theory Of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The Wealth Of Nations (1776). Smith urged a Free Market approach to political economy, observing in 1755, for instance: \"Little else is required to carry a state to the highest degree of affluence from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things. All governments which thwart the natural course are unnatural, and, to support themselves, are obliged to be oppressive and tyrannical.\" (The Roots Of Capitalism, John Chamberlain, Indianapolis, Liberty Press, 1976) The regulations of mercantilism, said Professor Smith, were \"impertinent badges of slavery\" imposed \"by the groundless jealousy of the merchants and manufacturers of the mother country.\" You see, it was not that Smith loved businessmen but that he knew the destructive consequences of legally assured monoply. As he remarked in an oft-quoted passage: \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\" But Smith's point was and is, reflects Benjamin Rogge, that \"in the absence of government backing, such conspiracies do not survive.\" (Can Capitalism Survive?, Indianapolis, Liberty Press, 1979) The argument made by Adam Smith applies today even as it did two hundred years ago: In the absence of government interference the freedom of all to follow self-interest will enrich the individual as it rewards the public. In the words of the great Scots economist: \"The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition, the principle from which public and national, as well as private opulence is originally derived, is frequently powerful enough to maintain the natural progress of things toward improvement, in spite of the extravagance of government, and of the greatest errors of administration.'' (The Wealth Of Nations, edited by Edwin Cannan, New York, Modern Library, 1937)\n\nIndustrial Revolution: Freeing The Market\n\n15\n\nIt will doubtless surprise many to learn that the meddlesome bureaucrats of today are mirror images of those under which Adam Smith suffered. Regulation under mercantilism was overwhelming. And the penalties, as Smith described them, were enough to set a bureaucrat at the Federal Trade Commission longing for the good old days. For instance, wrote Smith, \"the exporter of sheep, lambs or rams, was for the first offense to forfeit all his goods forever, to suffer a year's imprisonment, and then have his left hand cut off in a market town upon a market day, to be there nailed up; and for the second offense to be adjudged a felon, and to suffer death accordingly. To prevent the breed of sheep from being propagated in foreign countries, seems to have been the object of this law.\" Poor Ralph Nader; like Miniver Cheevy, born too late. How he would have loved mercantilism! Consider the typical regulation of the trading of English wool, as described in The Wealth Of Nations: \"In order to prevent exportation, the whole inland commerce of wool is laid under very burdensome and oppressive restrictions. It cannot be packed in any box, barrel, cask, case, chest, or other package, but only in packs of leather or pack-cloth, on which must be marked on the outside the words wool or yarn, in large letters not less than three inches long, on pain of forfeiting the same and the package, and three shillings for every pound weight, to be paid by the owner or packer. It cannot be loaden on any horse or cart, or carried by land within five miles of the coast, but between sun-rising and sunsetting, on pain of forfeiting the same, the horses and carriages. The hundred next adjoining to the sea coast, out of or through which the wool is carried or exported, forfeits twenty pounds, if the wool is under the value of ten pounds; and if of greater value, then treble that value, together with treble costs, to be sued for within the year. . . . These regulations take place through the whole kingdom. \"But in the particular counties of Kent and Sussex the restrictions are still more troublesome. Every owner of wool within ten miles of the seacoast must give an account in writing, three days after shearing, to the next officer of the customs, of the number of his fleeces, and of the places where they are lodged. And before he removes any part of them he must give the like notice of the number and weight of the fleeces, and of the person to whom they are sold, and of the place to which is intended they should be carried.\" All of this, so similar to what our modern bureaucrats demand, was of course fearfully inefficient. In its place Smith proposed what became known as the laissez-faire theory. The idea was to restrict government to protecting the nation from foreign invasion: administering justice in connection with personal injury, contract disputes, and violence; and,\n\n16\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\n\"certain public works and certain public institutions.\" Many of Smith's more temperate successors, notes Edward Cheyney, \"would have cut off the last duty altogether. \"(An Introduction To The Industrial And Social History Of England) But it was Adam Smith's popular volume, a contemporary correctly predicted, that \"would persuade the present generation and govern the next.\" (Rousseau And Revolution, Will and Ariel Durant, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1967) As even so \"Liberal\" an economist as Robert L. Heilbroner admits, \"Smith was the first to understand the full philosophy of action which such conception demanded, the first to formulate the entire scheme in a wide and systematic fashion. He was the man who made England, and then the whole Western World, understand just how the market kept society together and the first to build an edifice of social order on the understanding he achieved.\" (The Worldly Philosophers, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1953) Not that Adam Smith lived to see England transformed from economic dictatorship into a practitioner of economic liberty. When he died, in 1790, the consequences of his ideas were only beginning to flower. What is important to note here is that the basis for restraining the state in favor of the Free Market had first to be laid in a great educational campaign fostered by Adam Smith's important book. As Smith had noted in The Wealth Of Nations, mercantilism considered production to be the key to industry and commerce, virtually ignoring the role of the free play of the market in determining what ought to be produced and how. The producers had therefore contrived to control the system with the power of government. It would take widespread public understanding of the inefficiencies of this before politicians would appear on the scene — such as the precocious William Pitt II, Chancellor of the Exchequer at age twenty-three and Prime Minister the next year — who would attempt to implement the theory of limited government. As John Chamberlain explains, Pitt the Younger took Smith's philosophy \"as his guiding light of policy. If the shadows of the French Revolution and the long Napoleonic struggles had not intervened, the full Smith doctrine might have become English government policy long before 1835 or 1848.\" The times were surely suited for change as Great Britain suffered horribly under the heel of economic regulation. Ludwig von Mises described the situation in his monumental Human Action (Third Edition, Chicago, Regnery, 1963): \"The truth is that economic conditions were highly unsatisfactory on the eve of the Industrial Revolution. The traditional social system was not elastic enough to provide for the needs of a rapidly increasing population.\n\nIndustrial Revolution: Freeing The Market\n\n17\n\nNeither farming nor the guilds had any use for the additional hands. Business was imbued with the inherited spirit of privilege and exclusive monopoly; its institutional foundations were licenses and the grant of a patent of monopoly; its philosophy was restriction and the prohibition of competition both domestic and foreign. The number of people for whom there was no room left in the rigid system of paternalism and government tutelage of business grew rapidly. They were virtually outcasts. The apathetic majority of these wretched people lived from the crumbs that fell from the tables of the established castes. In the harvest season they earned a trifle by occasional help on farms; for the rest they depended on private charity and communal poor relief. Thousands of the most vigorous youths of these strata were pressed into the service of the Royal Army and Navy; many of them were killed or maimed in action; many more perished ingloriously from the hardships of the barbarous discipline, from tropical diseases, or from syphilis. Other thousands, the boldest and most ruthless of their class, infested the country as vagabonds, beggars, tramps, robbers, and prostitutes. The authorities did not know of any means to cope with these individuals other than the poorhouse and the workhouse. The support the government gave to the popular resentment against the introduction of new inventions and labor-saving devices made things seem quite hopeless.\" Yet with the first efforts to deregulate came fear and violence. Among the opponents of labor-saving devices were the so-called Luddites, who demanded the continued \"protection\" of the government from industrial advances that they viewed as threatening their jobs. Parliament had ended the regulation of the wool industry and thus made possible the first ventures that would lead to the Industrial Revolution. Throughout 1811 and 1812 mobs rioted in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Nottingham, breaking up machinery such as wool frames. \"They issued letters signed by 'King Lud,' or 'Ned Lud,' and so gave the movement of machine-breaking its name. In nearly a year, from March 1811 to February 1812, they broke over a thousand frames . . . . Sympathy with them was general.\" (Modern Britain, Pauline Gregg, New York, Pegasus, 1965) Eventually, remembering the French Revolution, the government broke the Luddite movement and continued to deregulate. In 1813, report J.L. and Barbara Hammond in The Rise Of Modern Industry (New York, Harcourt, Brace, 1926), Parliament repealed \"the Acts authorizing magistrates to fix wages; in 1814 the apprenticeship sections of the Statute of Artificers; in 1815 the Act establishing the Assize of Bread in London. The repeal, in each case, registered a decision taken and applied much earlier.... industry, like agriculture, escaped sooner in England than on\n\n18\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nthe Continent from the restraints that the institutions and the temper of the Middle Ages had placed upon it.\" The factories developed in an atmosphere of dramatic political change accompanied by prejudice, vestigial regulations, and fear over the loss of vested interests. Mises recounts in Human Action: \"That the factories could thrive in spite of all these hindrances was due to two reasons. First there were the teachings of the new social philosophy expounded by the economists. They demolished the prestige of Mercantilism, paternalism, and restrictionism. They exploded the superstitious belief that labor-saving devices and processes cause unemployment and reduce all people to poverty and decay. The laissez-faire economists were the pioneers of the unprecedented technological achievements of the last two hundred years. \"Then there was another factor that weakened the opposition to innovations. The factories freed the authorities and the ruling landed aristocracy from an embarrassing problem that had grown too large for them. They provided sustenance for the masses of paupers. They emptied the poorhouses, workhouses, and the prisons. They converted starving beggars into selfsupporting breadwinners. \"The factory owners did not have the power to compel anybody to take a factory job. They could only hire people who were ready to work for the wages offered to them. Low as these wage rates were, they were nonetheless much more than these paupers could earn in any other field open to them.\" The resultant growth and prosperity were extraordinary. The consumption of raw cotton, for example, increased from eight thousand tons in 1760 to one hundred thousand tons in 1830; coal production over roughly the same period nearly quadrupled; and, the iron output was four times as great in 1835 as in 1800. The key to all of this growth was the political philosophy of Prime Minister William Pitt II, a disciple of Adam Smith. (See The Younger Pitt, John Ehrman, New York, Dutton, 1969.) As Winston S. Churchill put it, Pitt \"was the first English statesman to believe in Free Trade, and for a while his Tory followers accepted it. The antiquated and involved system of customs barriers was now for the first time systematically revised. There were sixty-eight different kinds of customs duties, and some articles were subject to many separate and cumulative imposts. A pound of nutmegs paid, or ought to have paid, nine different duties. In 1784 and 1785 Pitt was able to bring a degree of order into this chaos, and the first visible effect of his wide-ranging revision of tariffs was a considerable drop in smuggling.\" (History Of The EnglishSpeaking People, New York, Dodd, Mead, 1957)\n\nIndustrial Revolution: Freeing The Market\n\n19\n\nBut Pitt was soon faced with a general war, and to finance it he imposed a variety of new taxes. \"He first put a tax on racehorses, carriage-horses, hackney carriages, personal servants, shopkeepers, windows, hair-powder, dogs, watches and clocks, and various other articles,\" records S E. Ayling. \"Later, under the demands of war, he both trebled his original taxes on many of these items, and also underlined the element in them of taxing luxuries; a man with ten servants would pay more than ten times the tax of a man having one only, and so forth. Some of these taxes were failures, others open to criticism; the window tax has been blamed for encouraging the bricking-up of windows and exclusion of light .... the national lottery begun in 1784 (it lasted forty years) was attacked by some on moral grounds. But, in any case, the great expenses of war with France eventually forced altogether more radical thoughts on taxation; and Pitt in 1799 . . . imposed a tax on income itself, again using the principle of a higher rate of tax on the rich....\" (The Georgian Century, London, Harrap, 1966) All of this had not only slowed the move toward an unregulated economy, it had in consequence frustrated the Industrial Revolution. But, after twenty-two years of war the income tax, supposedly a war measure only, was scheduled for abolition. The trouble is, as we know, that government has a tendency to expand, not contract, and it is always reluctant to surrender its revenues. That is, unless the public demands otherwise. This time, because of the growing influence of the advocates of the Free Market, it did so. And the great tax rebel of the time was a champion of the middle class named Henry Brougham, a lawyer and journalist with the Edinburgh Review, who helped to found London University. According to former Wall Street Journal editor Jude Wann-iski: \"What made the Industrial Revolution and the Pax Britannica possible was the audacity of the British Parliament in 1815. Spurred by middle-class agitators such as Henry Brougham, the legislature rejected the stern warnings of the fiscal experts and in one swoop eliminated Pitt's income tax, which had been producing £14.6 million or a fifth of all revenues and tariffs and domestic taxes that had been producing £4 million more. Had the British left their tax rates high in an attempt to quickly pay down their debts, the sixtyyear bull market that followed would not have been possible .... As the economy surged in the following decades, expand-ing revenues were used both to pay down the debt and reduce other tax rates.\" (The Way The World Works, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1978) England went to work with determination. Furthermore, in 1816, she returned to the gold standard; three years later, bullion and coins were\n\n20\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nallowed to pass in and out of the country with impunity. Mercantilism was on its way to the graveyard. As Will and Ariel Durant observe: \"Inspired by Adam Smith . . . English industry was geared to private enterprise, spurred by the profit motive, and largely free from government regulation. It obtained capital from its own unspent earnings, from prosperous merchants, from landlords gathering agricultural revenues and urban rents, and from bankers who knew how to make money by hugging it, and who lent money at lower rates of interest than their French compeers. So individuals and associations provided funds for entrepreneurs who proposed to unite the products of farm and field with the service of machines and the labor of men, women, and children on a larger scale and to greater gains than England had ever known. The providers of capital kept watch on its use, and gave its name to the economic system that was about to transform the Western world.\" (The Age Of Napoleon, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1975) Capitalism in a free market responded by providing products not mainly to the rich, as under mercantilism, but for the great masses. Workers became more affluent consumers and, because of business expansions and economies of scale, could afford the results of their mechanically enhanced production. Ludwig von Mises elaborates: \"The laissez-faire ideology and its offshoot, the 'Industrial Revolution,' blasted the ideological and institutional barriers to progress and welfare. They demolished the social order in which a constantly increasing number of people were doomed to abject need and destitution. The processing trades of earlier ages had almost exclusively catered to the wants of the well-to-do. Their expansion was limited by the amount of luxuries the wealthier strata of the population could afford. Those not engaged in the production of primary commodities could earn a living only as far as the upper classes were disposed to utilize their skill and services. But now a different principle came into operation. The factory system inaugurated a new mode of marketing as well as of production. Its characteristic feature was that the manufactures were not designed for the consumption of a few well-to-do only, but for the consumption of those who had hitherto played but a negligible role as consumers. Cheap things for the many, was the objective of the factory system.\" (Human Action) Not that government regulation of the economy which had been the norm for centuries was easily set aside. In 1820, for example, the Edinburgh Review was still complaining of: \"Taxes upon every article which enters into the mouth, or covers the back, or is placed under the foot .... taxes upon warmth, light, and locomotion .... taxes on the raw material — taxes on every fresh value that is added to it by the industry of man .... The schoolboy whips his taxed top — the beardless\n\nIndustrial Revolution: Freeing The Market\n\n21\n\nyouth manages his taxed horse, with a taxed bridle on a taxed road: and the dying Englishman pouring his medicine, which has paid seven per cent., into a spoon that has paid fifteen per cent. — flings himself back upon his chintz bed which has paid twenty-two per cent. — makes his will on an eight pound stamp, and expires in the arms of an apothecary who has paid a license of £100 for the privilege of putting him to death. His whole property is then immediately taxed from two to ten percent. Besides the probate, large fees are demanded for burying him in the chancel; his virtues are handed down to posterity on taxed marble; and he is then gathered to his fathers, — to be taxed no more.\" But one by one such taxes were repealed or reduced as the middle class began to exert its growing power. For example, the \"wine excise was abolished in 1825, the tea excise in 1833, the beer tax in 1830, the tobacco excise in 1840. The transit duties on coal were reduced, the law prohibiting the emigration of artisans was repealed in 1824; the export of machinery was permitted under licence.\" (Modern Britain) A potato blight in 1845 and 1846 led to the abolition of the Corn Laws (grain in general), which had heavily taxed foodstuffs imported from a foreign country. Because of the failure of the potato crop, reports Jude Wanniski, \"the starving Irish could not be fed from the inadequate British granaries. The Corn Laws simply had to be ended to permit entry of grains from the United States. Even so, a half million Irish died of starvation in 1846-47.'' Prime Minister Robert Peel, a Tory, not only dealt with the Corn Laws but also \"abolished the excise duties on livestock, meat, and potatoes; he reduced those on sugar, cheese, and butter. Gladstone's budgets of 1853 and 1860 completed the work and Britain was virtually a Free Trade country.\" (Modern Britain) Gone, too, were the relics of the guilds, legal monopolies, emigration bans, and the whole slate of mercantilist regulations. And what were the consequences of this introduction of laissez faire, of leaving each individual free to act in the market? It made Britain the economic colossus of the world, gave her supremacy on the seas for some one hundred fifty years, and provided a rich Empire upon which the sun never set. As Professor George Woodcock has written: '. . . from imperial defeat in 1783, Britain rose to become the most dominant naval power the world has known, and to assemble an Empire that in size and population dwarfed any of its predecessors or contemporaries. With its fleet and its Empire, Britain — whose army was negligible by the standards of continental Europe — became a major power and, for most of the nineteenth century, the world's exemplar and leader, whose achievements other nations emulated and whose aura of strength and\n\n22\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nself-confidence was so intimidating that its real power was rarely even tested.'' (Who Killed The British Empire?, New York, Quadrangle, 1974) Great Britain thrived under economic freedom not only in Empire and prestige, but in other spheres as well. As K.B. Smellie observes in Great Britain Since 1688 (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 1962): \"Between 1816 and 1875 Britain was to become the world's workshop, the world's banker, and the world's trader .... By 1860 she was supplying half the world's output of coal and manufactured goods. In 1830 world production of coal was about 30 million tons, of which Britain produced four-fifths; in 1870 it was about 220 million tons, of which Britain produced half .... In 1870 the external trade of the United Kingdom was greater than that of France, Germany, and Italy combined and three times that of the United States. The output of pig iron had risen from 700,000 tons a year in 1830 to about 3,800,000 in 1869-71, and to over 6,500,000 in 1871-73. While many industries were dependent on the coal fields, the main growth had been in cotton. Cotton was the one industry into which mechanization had cut deep by 1820. Textile operatives were more than 10 percent of the working population in 1841 .... \"Between 1815 and 1851 occurred the most rapid development of domestic resources in the whole of British economic history.\" There seemed no stopping Great Britain, which was soon the leading creditor in the world. Historian K.B. Smellie recounts: \"It was this vigorous, competitive, hideous and yet dazzling community which was the great exporter of the capital which made it possible to open up the vast but hitherto untapped resources lying in the hinterlands of new continents. All the underdeveloped parts of the world were calling for investments. Nearly a quarter of the £2.4 billion which was added to the capital of the United Kingdom between 1865 and 1875 was placed abroad, while a sixth went into houses and a tenth into railways at home .... It has been argued that the effort and the expense which went into the development of the colonial empire were at the cost of improvements which might have been made at home. This is to ignore the indirect gains which came from bringing new areas with new products into a worldwide system of multilateral trade. The small volume of direct trade with many new colonies often contained an element which played a vital part in some more complex interchange.\" All of this was great and splendid. But it did not suit the purposes of collectivist conspirators who saw government as the ultimate monopoly. They made their counterattack at about the time of the release of the Communist Manifesto, in the mid-Nineteenth Century, by arranging for Great Britain to readopt the income tax. As the country entered the\n\nIndustrial Revolution: Freeing The Market\n\n23\n\nTwentieth Century, that tax was gradually made more progressive, even as conspirator Karl Marx had urged. And, as the influence of the Fabian Socialists waxed before and after World War I, economic freedoms waned. There developed a movement for a return to \"protectionist\" tariffs and a \"planned\" economy. And as these found political favor in the aftermath of war, Britain moved away from laissez faire and . . . ceased to be Great. There is of course a lesson in all of this for the United States. It is that we can free the market and return to greatness as Britain once did under the influence of Adam Smith and his successors, or we can continue with the neomercantilism of regulation, paternalism, taxation, and decay. Only fools fail to learn from history.\n\nChapter III Manifest Destiny\n\nIT WAS IN 1845 that a New York editor spoke for the nation by coining the phrase Manifest Destiny. According to editor John L. O'Sullivan, it was \"our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\" Expansion of the United States was looked at, variously, as reaching our natural frontiers at the Pacific and Rio Grande, conveying the benefits of republican government to those anxious to embrace them, and just plain pioneering. \"Many felt that it was the right, the duty, and the opportunity of Americans,\" reported historian Glyndon G. Van Deusen, \"to expand the area of freedom and to enrich it, whether by the development of domestic resources, by continental conquest, or by the extension of American influence and American ideals to more distant quarters of the globe. Expansionism in this period pushed the American nation to the Pacific and to the Rio Grande, and sent clipper ships into the seven seas. It fostered dreams of great trade development in the Orient. 'Our population,' wrote William Henry Seward in 1846, 'is destined to roll its resistless waves to the icy barriers of the north, and to encounter Oriental civilization on the shores of the Pacific' \" (The Jacksonion Era, 18281848, New York, Harper & Row, 1959) Yes, young America was feeling her oats and sowing them as well. In the forty years following our Second War for Independence in 1812, the size of the country doubled — adding Florida at the expense of Spain, Texas through its fight for independence, the Oregon Country from Britain, and the Mexican Cession and Gadsden Purchase as a result of the Mexican War. \"It took American people one hundred and seventy-five years to build up and achieve independence for thirteen colonies with about three million inhabitants,\" observe Charles and Mary Beard. \"In less than one-third that span of years seven new states were established in\n\nManifest Destiny\n\n25\n\nthe region immediately westward and occupied by a population larger than that of the whole United States when the census of 1790 was taken. In less than half that number of years five additional states were formed in the Louisiana Territory, still further west, Texas was brought into the Union, a vast area to the southwest wrested from Mexico, and California admitted to statehood.\" (The Beards' New Basic History Of The United States, Garden City, Doubleday, 1960) There was something special about the character of the early American, armed with liberty and a will to succeed, that even a foreigner could sense. Alexis de Tocqueville, a French aristocrat, visited us and wrote of our countrymen during the Jacksonian era in Democracy In America: \"In the United States, the greatest undertakings and speculations are executed without difficulty, because the poorest as well as the most opulent members of the commonwealth are ready to combine their efforts for these purposes. The consequence is, that a stranger is constantly amazed by the immense public works executed by a nation which contains, so to speak, no rich men. The Americans arrived but as yesterday on the territory which they inhabit, and they have already changed the whole order of nature for their own advantage. They have joined the Hudson to the Mississippi, and made the Atlantic Ocean communicate with the Gulf of Mexico, across a continent of more than five hundred leagues in extent which separates the two seas.\" Even earlier than de Tocqueville's visit to this country, President James Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams spelled out the now famous doctrine that proclaimed there would be no future European colonies in the Americas; nor transfer to other European powers of possessions already held; and, that the United States would in turn stay out of European wars just as the U.S. expected Europeans to stay out of conflicts in this Hemisphere. President Monroe and Secretary Adams proposed this policy, but it would have to be left to others — especially James Polk — to enforce it. In Monroe's second Inaugural, says Pulitzer Prize historian George Dangerfield, the President \"recalled the passing of the War of 1812, the building of coast fortifications from the St. Croix to the Sabine in a spirit of 'peace and goodwill,' the ratification of the Florida Treaty, the 'peculiar felicity' of the United States in being altogether unconnected with the causes of war which seemed to menace Europe. He noted that he had been able to repeal the internal taxes, and he expressed his belief that 'the present depression in prices' would be temporary; while, as a proof of the 'extraordinary prosperity' of the nation, he offered the payment of nearly $67,000,000 of the public debt. He declared that no serious conflict had arisen between national and state governments, and\n\n26\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\nannounced that 'there is every reason to believe that our system will soon attain the highest degree of perfection of which human institutions are capable.' \" (The Era Of Good Feelings, New York, Harcourt, Brace, 1952) So, at times, it seemed. The Erie Canal, for example, was built without federal help. But the success of this project only motivated those who would have a central government finance similar internal improvements. \"The American republic had come into existence,\" noted George Dan-gerfield, \"by overthrowing a tyrant who ruled from afar: was it now to put itself into the hands of another tyrant, ruling only a little less remotely on the borders of Virginia and Maryland? Was it not always true that political power in remote hands was almost certain to be abused? Before the dismayed eyes of those who remembered and cherished the warnings of Thomas Jefferson, and before the eyes of Jefferson himself at Monticello, there spread a vision of a mass of internal-improvement legislation, entangled in local schemes, confused by jealousies, and saturated with greed and with corruption.\" There is nothing new under the sun. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams was in fact an expansionist not only for the United States but also for American government. It is of course well known that during the Monroe Administration he pressed the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819 through which Spain \"ceded East Florida to the United States, gave recognition to an American seizure of West Florida, and transferred Spanish claims to the Pacific Northwest north of the line of 42° to the United States.\" (Manifest Destiny And Mission In American History, Frederick Merk, New York, Knopf, 1963) Less well known is the fact that later, as President, John Quincy Adams asked Congress in his first annual message for what were then considered vast national powers — including scientific expeditions, an astronomical observatory, a national university, various internal improvements, and creation of a Department of the Interior. These measures, complained Thomas Jefferson, \"will be to them [the Federalists] a next blessing to the monarchy of their first aim, and perhaps the surest stepping stone to it.\" Adams had affronted representative government by demanding that the Establishment of the day not be ' 'palsied by the will of our constituents . . . .\" Such sentiments, aired in public, led many to believe that the Adams family was a nest of monarchists. And all of this prepared the climate for the 1828 election of war hero Andrew Jackson. Old Hickory's policy was simply summarized by him: \"The Federal Constitution must be obeyed, state rights preserved, our national debt must be paid, direct taxes and loans avoided, and the Federal Union preserved. These are the objects I have in view, and regardless of all consequences, will carry into effect.\"\n\nManifest Destiny\n\n27\n\nGrowth and change in the nation before Jackson became President were profound, and they continued dramatically during his term in office. \"While General Jackson was President,\" reports Bray Hammond, \"the federal union came to include twice as many states as it had begun with and held territory that recently had belonged to Spain and France. It was shortly to add regions in the South and West taken from Mexico and regions in the Northwest that Great Britain claimed. Its expansion seemed irresistible.\" (Banks And Politics In America, London, Oxford University Press, 1957) Indeed, migration, growth, and expansion were watchwords of the era. John Quincy Adams had spoken of \"our natural dominion in North America.\" But all did not swoon over the frontier. We learn in The Growth Of The American Republic: \"Major [Stephen] Long's expedition of 1819 reported the Great Plains 'almost wholly unfit for cultivation,' and laid down on the map of that region, which now supports a thriving population of several millions, the legend 'Great American Desert.' \" (Samuel Eliot Morison and Henry Steele Commager, New York, Oxford University Press, 1937) Daniel Webster opposed even a postal route from Missouri to the Oregon territory, saying: \"What do we want with this vast, worthless area? This region of savages and wild beasts, of deserts, or those endless mountain ranges, impenetrable, and covered to the very base with eternal snow? What can we ever hope to do with the western coast, a coast of three thousand miles, rock-bound, cheerless, uninviting, and not a harbor on it?\" But the people thought otherwise. Europeans were moving to America even as Americans were focusing their attention on the West. The invaluable de Tocqueville reported of his visit here: \"It is the Americans themselves who daily quit the spots which gave them birth, to acquire extensive domains in a remote region. Thus the European leaves his cottage for the transatlantic shores, and the American, who is born on that very coast, plunges in his turn into the wilds of central America. This double emigration is incessant; it begins in the middle of Europe, it crosses the Atlantic Ocean, and it advances over the solitudes of the New World. Millions of men are marching at once towards the same horizon; their language, their religion, their manners differ; their object is the same. Fortune has been promised them somewhere in the West, and to the West they go to find it. No event can be compared with this continuous removal of the human race, except perhaps those eruptions which caused the fall of the Roman Empire. Then, as well as now, crowds of men were impelled in the same direction, to meet and struggle on the same spot; but the designs of Providence were not the same. Then every newcomer brought with him\n\n28\n\nArchitects Of Conspiracy\n\ndestruction and death; now everyone brings the elements of prosperity and life.\" There was life indeed. In 1790 the population of the United States was estimated at four million; by 1848, we Americans numbered an impressive twenty-two million. Virtually in the middle of that expansion Andrew Jackson commented: \"[F]rom the earliest ages of history to the present day there never have been thirteen millions of people associated in one political body who enjoyed so much freedom and happiness as the people of these United States. You have no longer any cause to fear danger from abroad .... It is from within, among yourselves — from cupidity, from corruption, from disappointed ambition and inordinate thirst for power — that factions will be formed and liberty endange"
