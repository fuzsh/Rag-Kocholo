        "text": "The late King Norodom Sihanouk was a powerful Cambodian figure for almost six decades after obtaining independence from France in 1953.\n\nអានអត្ថបទ​នេះជាភាសាខ្មែរ\n\nNorodom Sihanouk 1941 Born on October 31, 1922, King Norodom Sihanouk was the grandson of King Sisowath Monivong, who reigned from 1927-1941. King Sihanouk was 18 years old when he succeeded King Monivong and Cambodia was still a French colony. Although France anointed Sihanouk for the position, in part because Paris thought he would be politically tractable, Sihanouk successfully achieved Cambodia’s independence from France in 1953, and the country became the Kingdom of Cambodia. In 1955, he founded his own political party, the Sangkum Reastr Niyum, or the “People’s Socialist Community.” That same year, King Sihanouk abdicated in favor of his father, Suramarit, and became the prime minister. After his father died in 1960, Sihanouk became the head of state.\n\nPrince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian Chief of State shown during the week he and his country celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Independence of Cambodia in November 1968. It was also the week of the Prince's 47th birthday. (Horst Faas | AP)\n\nU.S.-backed Gen. Lon Nol led a coup in March 1970, overthrowing Sihanouk while he was in Moscow. Sihanouk took refuge in Beijing until 1975, when Khmer Rouge guerrillas leading a resistance movement against Lon Nol’s Khmer Republic captured Phnom Penh on April 17 and took over the country. Sihanouk initially supported the Khmer Rouge regime and was installed as head of state by the communists, but resigned in 1976 as his relationship with them declined rapidly. He spent the rest of the regime as a de facto prisoner of the Khmer Rouge, who wreaked havoc on the country, killing or starving to death an estimated 1.7 million people from 1975 to 1979.\n\nSihanouk continued to play a key role in Cambodian politics after Vietnam invaded Cambodia and overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979. He played a leading role in negotiating the Paris Peace Accords in 1991. Although the 1993 constitution prohibits the royal family from direct involvement in political affairs, Sihanouk remained influential and was an enduring symbol of Cambodia until his death on October 15, 2012.\n\nResearched and written by Chenda Hong and Ten Soksreinith | VOA News\n\nInternational community calls Cambodia's vote a “setback to democracy”\n\nThe United States says it will take further action against the government of Cambodia following a landslide victory for the ruling party.

Cambodian people aged 18 and above are eligible to vote for any political parties they like. The party that wins the majority of votes then nominates its members to the National Assembly. Today, there are 123 National Assembly seats, 24 provinces and the capital Phnom Penh. The majority party in the National Assembly forms the national government, provincial governments, select the prime minister and various ministers.\n\nAll nominations must be approved by the king. Since 1998, the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) has won each national election.\n\nCommune Elections\n\nAs Cambodia stabilized and focused on institution building, it launched commune elections in 2002. Communes are the most local of administrative bodies, overseeing all the villages and their residents in a given area.\n\nCommune elections are held every five years, and the political party that wins the majority selects the commune chief in that commune.\n\nCommune chiefs work closely with the district governors addressing local issues such as sewage, roads, crimes, clean water, and electricity. The ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) has occupied most of the commune seats nationwide since 2002.\n\nMicrofinance\n\nOver the past two decades, at least two million Cambodian households in every one of Cambodia’s 22 provinces has obtained very small loans from microfinance institutions (MFIs) that provide cash to farmers, fishermen and others who need money to sustain their livelihood.\n\nWithout access to the MFIs, these Cambodians would have no access to credit.\n\nMicroloans are not unique to Cambodia. Muhammad Yunus started the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, loaning very small amounts of money to very poor women who needed to buy materials to produce the goods that they made and sold. He charged very low interest rates and the borrowers repaid in full at record rates. For example, in 2016 the microfinancing institution Opportunity International reported repayment rates of approximately 98.9 percent.\n\nYunus and the bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for developing microfinance and “their efforts to create economic and social development from below.” The International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is part of the World Bank Group, estimated that, as of 2014, more than 130 million people have directly benefited from microfinance-related operations.\n\nIn Cambodia, many of the MFIs are for-profit—although most Cambodians believe MFIs are government-run—and many borrowers are finding it punishing to pay back, for example, a $1,000 loan with a 3.5 percent monthly interest rate. It is particularly difficult for farmers whose profits are dictated by world commodity prices.\n\nAt the end of 2016, Cambodians collectively owed $3.1 billion to MFIs, according to a World Bank report, and 88 percent of borrowers live in impoverished rural areas. A 2017 “special circular” report prepared for the Cambodian Microfinance Association by the Mimosa Project – which studies microfinance over-indebtedness in developing countries – found “that the size of the loans granted by MFIs in the decade from 2004 to 2014 had grown at a rate four times the rate of the growth of incomes of the debtors receiving loans, a phenomenon it described as dangerous and unique to Cambodia,” the Phnom Penh Post reported.\n\nSome small relief arrived in April 2017, when the government capped the allowable annual interest rate at 18 percent. But that locked-out those borrowing the smallest amounts, because MFIs found small loans ate up profits with administrative costs.\n\nCambodian People’s Party (CPP)\n\nOriginally established as the Marxist-Leninist Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party on June 28, 1951, the reformist Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) has ruled Cambodia since the Khmer Rouge regime fell in January 1979. The CPP entered the first elections sponsored by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in 1993, but lost to FUNCINPEC, the royalist party. With King Norodom Sihanouk’s intervention, FUNCINPEC and the CPP agreed to form a coalition government in 1993, and Hun Sen became the co-prime minister. Hun Sen became the president of the CPP in June 2015.\n\nSources\n\n“CPP today marks 59 years since founding,” The Cambodian Daily\n\n“Political Parties and Politicians in Cambodia”\n\nCambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP)\n\nThe Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was founded on July 17, 2012 when Kem Sokha’s Human Rights Party (HRP) and Sam Rainsy’s Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) merged. Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister who founded an opposition party in 1995, was president and Kem Sokha, long a voice for political rights, as well as social and economic development, at village level, was the vice president.\n\nThe CNRP entered its first elections in 2013, and won 55 seats of the 123 places in the National Assembly.\n\nOn February 11, 2017, Sam Rainsy, the self-exiled president of the CNRP, resigned from his post in an attempt to save the party from dissolution after Hun Sen threatened to change the law to enable the government to dissolve parties whose officials had committed criminal offenses. Sam Rainsy had been convicted in absentia\n\nIn March 2017, Kem Sokha succeeded Sam Rainsy as the CNRP president. On September 3, 2017, Kem Sokha was arrested at his home in Phnom Penh for alleged treason, accused by the government of conspiring with the United States to bring down the Cambodian government.\n\nOn November 16, 2017, Cambodia’s Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the CNRP. Some opposition members joined the CPP, while many fled the country or were forced out of politics.\n\nSources\n\n“Political Parties and Politicians in Cambodia”\n\nFUNCINPEC\n\nNational United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC) was founded in 1981 by Prince Norodom Sihanouk as a movement against the Vietnam-backed People’s Republic of Kampuchea government. In 1991, Prince Norodom Sihanouk handed over the movement to Prince Norodom Ranariddh. FUNCINPEC, an acronym from the party’s name in French, the language of Cambodia’s European colonizers from 1863 to 1953, became a political party in 1992.\n\nFUNCINPEC participated in the national election sponsored by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in 1993. The party won the election, but Prime Minister Hun Sen refused to step down. With King Norodom Sihanouk’s intervention, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen agreed to form a coalition government, becoming co-prime ministers until 1997 when their personal animus erupted into July 1997 street fighting between armed forces loyal to Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh. Hun Sen’s forces won and the prince went into exile.\n\nSources\n\n“Political Parties and Politicians in Cambodia”\n\nHuman Rights Party (HRP)\n\nHuman Rights Party (HRP) was founded on July 22, 2007 by Kem Sokha. The party entered its first Cambodian national elections in 2008, and won three seats out of 123 in the National Assembly.\n\nSources\n\n“Political Parties and Politicians in Cambodia”\n\nSam Rainsy Party (SRP)\n\nSam Rainsy Party (SRP) was originally founded in 1995 as the Khmer Nation Party by Sam Rainsy. The SRP won 15 seats in the National Assembly in Cambodia’s 1998 national elections. In the 2003 elections, the SRP won 22% of the votes, becoming the second-most popular party in the country after Hun Sen’s CPP.\n\nSources\n\n“Political Parties and Politicians in Cambodia”\n\nKhmer Rouge\n\nThe Khmer Rouge also known as the Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party took control of Cambodia on April 17, 1975. Under Pol Pot, they adopted a radical Maoist and Marxist-Leninist ideologies and wanted to transform Cambodia into a self-sufficient agrarian, classless society. The regime targeted professionals, intellectuals including teachers, Buddhist monks, anyone suspected of having ties to the former Cambodian government or foreign governments, and ethnic minorities. The regime forced people to move out of the cities to rural provinces where forced labor, malnutrition, disease, and mass executions killed approximately 1.7 million people or a quarter of the country’s population by the time the Vietnamese invasion toppled the Khmer Rouge on January 7, 1979.\n\nSources\n\n“The Cambodian Genocide”"
