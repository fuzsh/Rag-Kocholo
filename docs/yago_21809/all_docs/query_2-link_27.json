It is by no means evident that the country has asked for small notes or will evea use the machinery he is about to devise for that purpose after it has been set up. Nor is his only object to accumulate in the Bank of England a larger amount of gold. That will be the upshot of the £l-note scheme if it is operative, but it is only one of the ends sought. Beyond these results, which belong wholly to the working out of one portion of his plan, Mr. Goschen has a much broader purpose or motive for his suggestions. He disclosed that purpose more at length in his Leeds address when he stated the object he had in view was the comprehensive one of strengthening the monetary system of Great Britain. To correctly appreciate, then, what is the system the Government has in contemplation, one must make the Leeds address and its proposals the ba?i3 of a considerThat Ljeds maeting, it ation of the present proposal. will be remembered, occurred shortly after the Baring crisis, when the joint-stock bank reserves were proved to be so insufficient, and when the Bank of England found it necessary to fortify its bullion holdings by borrowing 4^ millions sterling of the Bank of France and the Imperial Bank of Russia. These circumstances, indicating that too small reserves wis the .sign of danger on that occasion, have encouraged a conclusion which many have adopted, that the exjjectation now is On the conto cure that defect by the i;l-note devic?. trary, Mr. Goschen at the opening of his aJdross in Merchant Taylor's Hill sets out very clearly that he it is accomplish.

Does not England's stock of gold look prosperity, such a result mnst be regarded as in the much much much smaller than smaller than it it once did, and is it not relatively highest degree satisfactory, and of coarse reflects credit was when its neighbors held so on those in control of the properties. It also indicates than they now do, and when a disturbance of was not so often in large part a mere sentiment ? In fact, has not the trade of Great Britain frequently, and sometimes for a considerable period, been kept in a half feverish state just because of gold withdrawals when nothing in the condition of its trade justified the least anxiety? What would have happened a year ago had not that 4^ millions sterling been borrowed by the Bank of England from the Bank of France and from Eussia ? Yet that gold could hardly be said to have done more for the moment than to satisfy a sentiment. It did not come to stay. It was even known at the time to be a mere loan which must be repaid soon and in kind. And yet it certainly had a large share in producing the quieter feeling which at once prevailed and the recovery which followed. The important fact is that all the Bank of Eugland needs in any crisis is time to be able to recover itself. Its position is such with reference to other countries that in an emergency it can so far control the world's exchanges as to speedily replenish its reserves. And yet hitherto its holdings of gold have been so small as to permit of far too little time for deliberate action, and less credit the strong position held by the properties, and the great diversification of their traffic, under which a loss overcome by gains in other directions As the roads form parts of important trunk lines between the Great Lakes andthe Atlantic seaboard, they had of course the advantage of an exceptionally heavy grain movement in the more recent months. On the other hand, daring the first six months the grain movement was very light and much below that of the first six months of 1890. This appears very clearly from an examination of the official statistics.

ItlH 1885-6 1886-7 SOUTHERN RAILWAY The Census Office has G lOWTH. recently issued its fourth bulletin on railway statistics, and a sti.dy of it reveals some interesting and noteworthy fr. tures.

The figi; l'S cover the same period as the preceding bulletins, namely the year 1889, and hence do not cone ilown to a very recent date but as the summaries for tl-e different geograjAical sections are apparently based on carefully-collected and very comprehensive data, tliey are quite useful for purposes of comparison, and they certainly serve to bring out strikingly the marked differences in condition under which railroad operations are conducted in the various sections.

J actually appears that the average per ton p^f mile was lower in the four Southern States than in the It Middle States, and only slightly above the average of the Jfiddle Western States. In both the latter two sections the conditions are such as to enforce low rates. The traffic in coal, ore, and other bulky and low-class freights, which will not bear high transportation charges, is very large in those sections, and at the same time the through freight between the West and the seaboard, which likewise has to be carried at low average rates, forms a quite considerable item in the traffic of the lines.

Let me state them as briefly as possible. I propose to movement one mile in the same interval rose from 104 authorize the Bank of England to issue £1 notes on the condimillions to 339 millions. In the one instance the ratio tion that the additional issue which would ensue should be of growth is 261 per cent and in the other 226 per cent. issued in the proportion of £4 on gold against £1 on securities. This is decidedly heavier than the increase in the other An issue based on this proportion would be grafted on to the two sections. In the Middle States the number of present system as follows The Bank of England is at present authorized to issue passengers increased only 131 per cent, and passengers £16,450,000 on securities. Beyond that all notes must be one mile 99 per cent, while in the Middle Western represented by gold.

I would disturb nothing up to beyond authorizing the issue of £1 notes under precisely the same conditions as those under which notes of higher denominations are issued at present. But beyond this limit of £38,000,000 I would authorize the issue of notes under the conditions which I have sketched, namely, £4 on gold to £1 on securities. The proposal may be stated in another and perhaps a simpler way by describing the authority as commencing when the stock of gold in the issue department of the Bank of England provisions of the this point Middle Western 3-090 cents and for the New England States 1*920 cents, that of the four Southern States was not so very much higher, being 3*307 cents. stands at £21,550,000. If an additional sum of £35,000,000 were issued in the proGreat though the increase in traffic on the Southern addition to the roads has been, they are still relatively far behind the portion of £4 on gold to £1 on securities, the stock of gold would be £20,000,000, bringing the total to roads in the other sections.

So as regards passengers. In 1880 it took one man to every 22,770 passengers one mile, in 1889 only one to 30,726 passengers one mile.

The following shows the imports of cereal produce into the November are undoubtedly Onited Kingdom during the first fourteen weeks of the season compared with previous seasons: they do, with the month last IMPOSTS. year iu which the Baring crisis occurred. The value of the exports of British and Irish produce and manufactures is only slightly over 183^ millions sterling, a decrease, compared •with November of last year, of about 2}4 millions sterling, or nearly 10% per cent. For the eleven months of the year there is a decrease of about 14?^ millions sterling, or over 6 per cent. The decrease is very general. It is largest in iron and steel it is considerable also in coal, in cotton yarn and in tin plates; but cotton piece goods have been fairly well maintained. On the other hand, the value of the imports has enormously increased. For the month it is not far short of 44 millions sterling, being an increase compared with November last year of nearly 6% millions sterling, or over 18 per cent. For the eleven months there is an increase of nearly eleven millions sterling, or not far short of 3 per cent. Of the increase of nearly 6^ millions sterling in November in the value of the imports, not far short of 3;^ millions sterling are attributable to cereals. There remains a handsome increase in raw materials, which is an encouraging sign for the future. The wheat market continues quiet. Holders are not disposed to press sales at present quotations, and on the other hand buyers are unwilling to give higher prices.
