        "text": "CAMBODIAN WAR: 1970 -1975\n\nA First and Last\n\nReunion of a Unique Band of Brothers & Sisters\n\nFor those who covered the Cambodian War between 1970 and 1975, the memories have always been particularly painful. Forty years ago this month, they witnessed first-hand the overnight plunge of a peaceful Cambodia into the abyss as the country was dragged into the Vietnam War. Then over the next five years, the horrors multiplied as war engulfed the entire country. A total of 36 foreign and Cambodian journalists were killed or disappeared, more than in the war in neighboring Vietnam. When the war ended with the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge on April 17, 1975, Cambodia's nightmare continued — and many of those who covered the war could not bear to look back at the entire tragedy. At least 30 Cambodian journalists were executed after the Khmer Rouge take-over, including one country’s few female reporters.\n\nNow, for the first time since that horrible war, a handful of war correspondents are returning to Phnom Penh for a reunion from 20 to 23 April. The event is organized by Chhang Song, the last Information Minister in the Lon Nol government who now divides his time between Cambodia and the US and acts as a senior adviser to both the government and public-at-large. As a military spokesman at the beginning of the war, then-Captain Chhang Song worked closely with these foreign correspondents, listened to their complaints and treated them as members of his own family.\n\n“The sudden presence of a large number of foreign journalists in Cambodia in the early 1970’s was an important historical development in Cambodia’s fight for survival,” Chhang Song explains. “I knew them as friends. Many were killed or disappeared. For the past 40 years, I have never forgotten those days and have dreamed constantly of bringing them back. Now, it is finally happening.”\n\nAssisting Chhang Song in his quest is former Associated Press (AP) correspondent US-born Carl Robinson who covered the Cambodian War from neighboring Saigon, today's Ho Chi Minh City, and now lives in Brisbane, Australia. While several reunions have been held over the past 15 years in Saigon, this is the first one in Phnom Penh. And, considering their age, this reunion will most likely also be the last one.\n\n\"Covering the war was so painful that many, even now, are unable to look back on that period,\" explains Robinson, who has only re-visited Cambodia in the past couple years. \"It's even harder to look at what happened afterwards. For their own peace of mind, this return is an important event in their lives. I'm sure there will be quite a few tears. But I'm sure joy too as they witness Cambodia's amazing resilience and recovery.\"\n\nDuring the Cambodia War, Le Royal — then renamed Le Phnom by the republican regime — was the unofficial headquarters of the foreign press corps which numbered less than 50 at any one time. Many had offices in the hotel as well as accommodation. The pool-side restaurant was a favorite gathering place after another hard day covering the war, a danger-fraught exercise that saw many venturing down less-than-secure roads by vehicle. For the reunion, the now totally refurbished hotel is acting as the official host of the reunion with several functions planned.\n\nSeveral activities are planned over the three-day reunion including a personally guided tour of Cambodia's National Museum and the Royal Palace, both closed during the war, plus informal gatherings and exhibitions in the downtown quarter. On one day, the former correspondents will re-enact a morning military briefing under a banyan tree not far from Le Royal where then-Captain Chhang Song had his office. Then, as during the war, they will head off on a \"road run\" out of the city to check out the situation first-hand. On this occasion, however, they'll travel down Route 3 to Wat Po where nine of their colleagues were ambushed and killed by the Khmer Rouge on 31 May 1970 — the most in a single day — and hold a Remembrance and Lunch at the local Buddhist temple. In the evening, a memorial to their dead and missing colleagues will be unveiled at Le Royal. The commemorative reunion has the support of the Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith, the Club of Cambodian Journalists (CCJ), the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia and the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam).\n\nDuring their reunion, the former correspondents will also visit the Killing Fields as they catch up first-hand with what happened after 1975 and then are brought up to today's more peaceful times. They are hoping to meet with local tourism and business people as well as local journalists. About a dozen of the 40 surviving correspondents from the Cambodia War are expected to attend the reunion, including two women correspondents, Sylvana Foa and Elizabeth Becker.\n\nAGENDA FOR PHNOM PENH REUNION: 20 to 23 April 2010\n\nDay 1, Tuesday 20/4: Arrival of participants in Phnom Penh and check into Le Royal Hotel. 1700: Welcome drinks and then informal dinner in city restaurant.\n\nDay 2, Wednesday 21/4: 0900, Guided tour of Cambodia's National Museum by ex-Reuters Correspondent and now Archeologist at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies Peter Sharrock and his local counterparts.

The list below is not definitive and more information is needed on the circumstances of death. Most of these Cambodians had worked on the front lines of the fighting as freelancers for the international press — and were targeted by the Khmer Rouge for this work — while also working for their local papers. As they vanished after the Khmer Rouge takeover when hostilities ended in April 1975, they are treated here as a separate category.\n\nChhor Vuthi AP\n\nHong Ho UPI\n\nSun Heang freelance/AP\n\nTea Kim Heang (Moonface) freelance/AP photographer\n\nSaing Hel freelance\n\nMean Leang AP/freelance\n\nPut Sophan CBS\n\nSou Vichit Gamma photographer\n\nSok Ngoun Reuters\n\nIth Chhun freelance\n\nChea Ho UPI\n\nLanh Daunh Rar AP\n\nLek\n\nLeng\n\nLy Eng Domneung Peel Prik (Morning News)\n\nLyng Nhan AP\n\nTy Many\n\nVantha AP\n\nUng Kim Seng aka Cheav\n\nYun Huor Nihon Dempa News *\n\nKeo Yun freelance TV cameraman *\n\nSoeung Phoeuk Thor editor of Meat-to Phum, or Newspaper Editor *\n\nOu Nget photographer with Minister of Information *\n\nHak Kheng freelance cameraman *\n\nBuoy Sreng editor of Sangket, or Observer, newspaper *\n\nSuon Chheng Horn *\n\nChey Chum *\n\nI Ith *\n\nMen Manil *\n\nLy Khuon *\n\n----\n\n*Arrested, held, tortured and executed at Tuol Sleng between 1976 and 1978.\n\n** Flynn and Stone are believed to have been executed by KR captors (per Tim Page).\n\n***Yeng Samleng, a CBS driver, is only non-news person on list.\n\n+Duynisveld, traveling w/ VC unit, was seeking Stone and Flynn.\n\n++Filloux and Manivanh, his female interpreter, left Vientiane and crossed into northern Cambodia hoping to meet and interview Khmer Rouge officials.
