        "text": "Music festival posters -- densely packed with dozens of band names -- are often referred to as âHipster Vision Tests.â Generally, big name acts appear in heavy type at the top, and lesser known groups are in smaller type at the bottom.\n\nA person's musical knowledge can be inferred by how far down the poster he or she can confidently recognize artists. Someone who can go no further than Fleet Foxes on the fifth line of say, Coachella 2018, likely suffers from musical nearsightedness, whereas someone who recognizes Cherry Glazerr on line 20 of the same poster has near-perfect vision.\n\nBy gathering the information from the posters into a single, structured data set, CNS was able to explore how the musical festival lineups have changed and examine how the popularity of certain artists has evolved over time. Our analysis found that many once-unknown artists earned prominent spots only after releasing a breakout album, like The Black Keys.\n\nThe Akron, Ohio-based duo released their debut effort The Big Come Up in 2002âtwo years before their dead-last Bonnaroo slotâbut didnât reach Billboard popularity until Brothersâ âTighten Upâ peaked at #87 in January 2011, and El Caminoâs âLonely Boyâ reached #64 that December. Later that year, they were Bonnaroo headliners.\n\nOur analysis also uncovered a rarefied class of performers who have only played the festivals as headliners, instead of rising through the ranks. We also found many bands who play the festivals in non-prominent positions for years, without ever rising to a headlining spot. And we identified the bands who showed up over and over again. Leading the way were The Black Keys, with 15 total appearances in the data we analyzed -- Lollapalooza (1991-2018), Coachella(1999-2018), Bonnaroo(2002-2018) and Firefly (2012-2018).\n\nWe built a data set by creating an ordered list of artists for each festival in each year, working from top left to bottom right on the festival posters. Each festival had a different total number of artists. To account for the fact that each festival in each year had a different total number of artists, we adjusted the ranking to an âArtist Position Scoreâ on a one to 100 scale. Like golf scores, lower is better.\n\nHereâs what else we found:\n\nMany Appearances"
