F10502 South Vietnamese Army Ranger in action in Cho Lon area (Visnews production number 4828-68), 8 May 1968.\n\nSouth Vietnamese Army Rangers have been combing Saigon's Chinese sector of Cho Lon trying to flush out die-hard Viet Cong. On Wednesday fighting was continuing in parts of Cho Lon, but it was less fierce than during the previous three days when the Viet Cong offensive on the capital began. About 300 Viet Cong were thought to be holding out in the Cho Lon area, where they had hoisted a new red, blue and yellow Viet Cong flag only 4 miles (6 km) from the Presidential Palace. Gunships blasted the burning shanty town as columns of smoke rose high into the air, but failed to bring down the flag. Meanwhile, tonight (10 May) the Viet Cong appeared to be pulling out from Saigon as peace contacts between the United States and North Vietnam opened in Paris. But it is thought the withdrawal could be a feint, and documents released by the American mission are said to indicate that the fighting could continue for another five days. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 9 sec.

The three day operation, involving troops from the 9th Infantry Division, took place from last Saturday (4 January) to Monday (6 January). The Americans were looking for Viet Cong in the area, 55 miles (89 km) southwest of Saigon, in the Mekong Delta. In the wet swamps and the high grass where Operation Eagle Flight was being held, the troops found conditions very difficult. Men were stuck in mud and some had to be assisted by others who were on more solid ground. Loaded with equipment and their weapons, the troops had a hard time making progress. On Monday afternoon, after the completion of Operation Eagle Flight, US Infantrymen attacked a Viet Cong company of about 700 men entrenched in bunkers near Cao Lanh, in Kien Phong Province. In the 18 hour battle, 74 miles (118 km) west of Saigon, 54 Viet Cong and 3 Americans were reported killed. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 20 sec.

Related item: S03301 F10505 United States and South Vietnamese Forces push deeper into Cambodia (Visnews production number 4151-70), 3-4 May 1970.\n\nUnited States and South Vietnamese forces pushing through Cambodia are said to have wiped out a large number of Communist troops who have long used the 'Parrot's Beak' and 'Fish Hook' areas of the country as sanctuaries. Since the dawn invasion to wipe out Communist bases started last Friday, the number of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops reported to have been killed numbers more than one thousand. The vast firepower the invading forces have brought with them cannot be matched by the Communist troops. The brunt of the invasion is being led by tanks, but United States Air Force jets have also been landing support with strafing and dive bombing runs on suspected enemy positions. On Monday (May 4) heavy artillery bombarded suspected guerrilla positions in the Fish Hook area while tanks moved into rubber plantations to lend support. Massive hauls of arms, food and other equipment have been captured by the American and South Vietnamese forces. Among the equipment seized were a lot of bicycles said to have been used by the guerrillas. Tanks rode over the bicycles to destroy them to prevent them from being used should they be found by the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 44 sec. Related item: S03301 F10506 Fierce fighting for the town of Srang (Visnews production number 8307-70), 1 September 1970.\n\nCambodian government troops are making a major effort to recapture the town of Srang, 30 miles (45 km) south west of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. The government forces were driven out of Srang last Sunday (30 August). On Tuesday (1 September), they fought their way back to within half a mile of the town. In Tuesday's fighting, the government troops stationed themselves in the rice paddies, with a leafy thicket screening them from the entrenched Communist forces in the town. The Cambodian air force swept into action to bombard the town, and the ground troops made use of the diversion to inch their way forward through the water. The Cambodian forces had the advantage in numbers, but the defenders were more experienced and had the greater firepower. As a result they were able to force the government troops back, and inflict a number of casualties. The Cambodian forces withdrew, dragging their wounded away with them over the rough and waterlogged ground. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 15 sec. Related item: S03301 F10507 The battle for Saang [Khum Srang] (Visnews production number 1162-71), 27 January 1971.\n\nMore than one hundred guerrillas were killed by Cambodian troops on Wednesday (January 27) in the battle for Saang [Khum Srang] 18 miles (30 km) south of the capital, Phnom Penh. Four Cambodian soldiers were injured. This is the fourth time that the town, which lies on a direct Viet Cong infiltration route between Vietnam and Cambodia, has been a battleground in the 10 month old fighting in Cambodia. In this latest battle, about 500 guerrillas surrounded Saang during the night, but Cambodian troops hit back and removed the immediate threat to the town. This action gave a boost to the morale of the Cambodian soldiers, said the news agency report. The Cambodians have been involved in a string of successful battles against the Viet Cong since the guerrillas blasted Phnom Penh airport recently. They have opened the Highway Four road link between the capital and the deep-water port of Kompong Som, and pushed the guerrillas further back from Phnom Penh. The Cambodian High Command claim the guerrillas still in the area have been dispersed into small groups incapable of launching and attack in strength. 16mm; silent; colour; 2 min 10 sec. Related item: S03301 F10508 Cambodian Forces counter attack around Saang [Khum Srang] on the vital Viet Cong route to Vietnam (Visnews production number 1223-71), 29 January 1971.\n\nThe Cambodian town of Saang [Khum Srang] epitomises the current war in that country. The small collection of villages lies astride Route 21, used by the Viet Cong as a route to and from Vietnam. Saang lies 18 miles (30 km) southeast of Phnom Penh. Early on the morning of January 27 (Wednesday) an estimated 500 Viet Cong attacked. They were repulsed but fell back to control Route 21 for several miles on the Phnom Penh side. Later in the day the Cambodians counter attacked and after several hours fighting regained control of the road. But then the Viet Cong changed their tactics. They were being heavily pressed in many areas, including along Highway 4 and around Saang, so they fought a diversionary action by attacking the capital. Cambodian troops were rushed back from Saang to protect Phnom Penh and the Viet Cong moved in again on the 28th. The next day Government forces attacked and the bitterest fighting of the whole campaign followed. The Cambodians claimed 100 Viet Cong killed and only four of their men wounded. The area was once again in Cambodian hands, but with the past in mind…for how long. 16mm; silent; colour; 2 min 13 sec.

Saang is a key point on the vital Route 21 to Phnom Penh - the Communist troops have been in complete control to the South for several months and the capture of Route 21 would mean an invasion corridor straight into Phnom Penh. The 127th Infantry Battalion of the Cambodian Army had been fighting along the same stretch of road for the last three days in an attempt to reach Saang to relieve the garrison there. It was at this point, with the enemy firing from both the wooded area on the West and from across the Bassac (pronounced Bar - sac) River on the East, that Visnews cameraman Neil Davis reached the embattled troops. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 23 sec.

No details have been given of Marine casualties in the fighting, but newsmen saw many injured soldiers being carried back to the shelter of nearby dunes for evacuation by helicopter. The Marines' drive into Quang Tri Province came as President Thieu told a nationwide radio audience that South Vietnam would recapture all the territory lost to the Communists. He said the North Vietnamese had failed to defeat the South Vietnamese and he said the Communist units were now bogged down. Visnews 8756/72: Continuous heavy fighting is raging in Quang Tri City in the northernmost province of South Vietnam as South Vietnamese Airborne troops attempt to wrest the city from the control of deeply entrenched North Vietnamese. The battle for the city is part of a counter offensive to reoccupy Quang Tri Province. It is reported that South Vietnamese forces were brought up from the Central Highlands near Kontum City especially for the final ballet for Quang Tri City, which promises to be long and bloody. South Vietnamese Airborne Troops made their first advance into the city proper on Sunday (16 July) supported by M48 tanks and South Vietnamese jets. US aircraft have been ordered by President Thieu not to bomb within the city, but these bombers are maintaining continuous heavy pounding of suspected North Vietnamese positions on the outskirts of the city. By Sunday afternoon South Vietnamese troops had advanced to within 100 metres of a heavy North Vietnamese concentration in an old US compound. The South Vietnamese paratroopers intend to hold their ground, and they told Visnews that they would continue to advance into the Citadel part of the city, now within their reach. Intelligence reports say that at least four North Vietnamese battalions are entrenched in the Citadel with orders to fight to the last man. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 57 sec.

Both sides are using tanks in the city. The air cover over Quang Tri is being flown exclusively by the South Vietnamese to avoid the possibility of US pilots accidentally killing civilians. Strikes outside the city, however, are being flown by US pilots to prevent North Vietnamese attempts to cut Highway One leading into the city. US advisors to the South Vietnamese are calling Quang Tri City the 'meatgrinder' because of the ferocity of the fighting.

The Rangers were on patrol, looking for North Vietnam regulars who have been moving south over the Khmer frontier via the Mekong Delta, when they walked right into the trap. The ambush was most unexpected, as Fifth Division soldiers had supposedly swept the area shortly beforehand. It was effective also, and the Rangers found themselves unable to retreat, being pinned in from all sides by intensive North Vietnamese gunfire. Only one way of escape was possible, and that was an air strike to disperse and destroy the opposition. And this proved a tough assignment for the South Vietnamese Skyraider pilots, who had to drop their bombs with unfailing accuracy to avoid hitting their own troops. The strikes were successful, and gave the Rangers time to retreat in fairly orderly fashion. According to government reports, the casualties amongst the Rangers were mercifully light - only one dead and eight wounded. That Tuesday night the war got even closer to Saigon as giant B-52 bombers pounded suspected North Vietnamese troop concentrations northwest and southwest of the capital, sending massive shock waves through the city. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 28 sec.

The carriers were called for after the Rangers were forced to withdraw from an area near Lai Khe, 25 miles (40 km) north of the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon. The carriers began their advance before dawn - and it was in the darkness that the vehicles became bogged down. As other armoured personnel carriers tried to free the trapped vehicles, North Vietnamese mortar shells exploded near by. However, none of the carriers was hit. The Rangers' commander called in air strikes which pounded the suspected Communist mortar positions. Later, the South Vietnamese troops resumed their advance but made only slow progress. Latest reports from the area say sporadic Communist shelling of both Lai Khe and Ben Cat, suggesting a renewal of North Vietnamese interest in the Mekong Delta region. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 28 sec.

The election is designed to complete Marshal Lon Nol's programme to restore a measure of democratic activity under the constitution that he personally drew up and introduced last April. Security in the capital was strict, but Phnom Penh is still cut off from all major provincial towns, except for Kompong Cham in the northeast and the small port of Kompong Som in the west. South of the city, government troops have been trying to reopen Highway Two and relieve at least two besieged Khmer outposts. After having been repulsed by communist forces three times in five days, government troops of the 1st Infantry Brigade finally managed to reopen a portion of Highway Two, only to have it cut off behind them.

On some respects it appears to be a 'rice' war and according to some reports, just about all of the vast rice growing area south of Phnom Penh is in Communist hands. One village which is being fought for is Tram Khnar (pronounced Trum K-nah), about 28 miles south of the capital. Visnews South-East Asia correspondent Neil Davis was slightly wounded by a rocket while covering the fighting. A Khmer journalist with him was wounded and later listed as missing, presumed dead.

It's eased off considerably, but both the North and South Vietnamese Governments have reported serious violations of the ceasefire over the past few days. However, the fighting was expected to go through a 'damping down' when the 27 men of the International team to help supervise the ceasefire arrived in Hue on Monday (5 February). The commission says it hopes that its very presence in fighting areas should deter fighting. But around Trang Bang on Highway Four on Friday (2 February), big battles continued. One raged on the first day of the Vietnamese New Year (Tet) when South Vietnamese troops assaulted a small hamlet in Trang Bang…a hamlet which had been occupied only a day earlier by the Viet Cong. The troops and four civilians entered the hamlet under fire, but in a matter of minutes, they were encircled by North Vietnamese troops. The South Vietnamese men took cover from the North Vietnamese attack until their own jet bombers and helicopter gunships came to their rescue. On the other side of Saigon, the hunt for any evidence of fighting continues. On Friday, South Vietnamese troops found the Viet Cong flag flying near some tall trees near Ding Tuong Province, about 48 miles south of Saigon. They made their way to the jungle village, tore down the flag and flew the South Vietnamese flag in its place. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 51 sec.

The cameraman, Neil Davis, said the villagers scattered when the helicopter banked over the hamlet and started firing. Viet Cong soldiers escorting Davis, pushed him behind a building to keep him out of the line of fire which continued for half an hour. Davis located the hamlet in the Mekong Delta region just 60 miles southwest of Saigon. He was escorted by an old Vietnamese farmer he met on the main highway to the Viet Cong hamlet, via a sampan ride through the Delta's vast canal system. All along the river bank, Davis saw Viet Cong flags flying from houses and huts. He said none of the soldiers he saw wore the legendary Viet Cong black pyjamas. Most wore tattered black trousers and blue shirts. They looked like the hard working sons of farmers. Some had captured United States M-16 rifles. But most carried Russian or Chinese-made AK-47 rifles. During his 24 hour stay with the Viet Cong, Davis drank tea, shared a meal, chatted about the mysterious West, ran for cover with them during the attack and listened to artillery bombardment of another hamlet in the middle of the night. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 36 sec.

On Saturday (31 March) a command post on Highway two near the town of Chambak (pronounced Chum-buk) fell with more than 50 killed and many missing and wounded. On Monday the Communists launched a full scale attack on the town itself and quickly encircled it. After about 6 hours, the defenders were forced to leave the town and began to fight their way out. Some, accompanied by their dependents, made it. But all were battle weary and despondent…a rare thing for these men. The troops were members of the 37th Infantry Brigade and in a long uninterrupted spell of fighting they've taken heavy casualties.

There was heavy fighting between government troops and Communist led forces on at least three fronts, and terrorist activity in the capital Phnom Penh. At the same time, fighting flared up again in South Vietnam. One of the biggest battles was on Highway 5, known as the 'rice road', which links Phnom Penh with the important rice-producing province of Battambang. Heavy fighting began on Sunday (October 28) after sporadic attacks by Communist forces. They crossed the Tonla Sap River from the east bank and occupied a two and a half mile stretch of the Highway. After three days the Khmer government troops, supported by armoured cars, claimed to have killed and wounded about 30 Communists. The bulk of the fighting was about 15 miles (24 km) north of Phnom Penh. On Sunday (October 28), the Khmer forces tried a determined push to re-open the Highway, but the Communist led fighters were well entrenched and waiting. They met the government attack with a barrage of mortars and rockets, to hold up the Khmer advance and give their own troops time to escape by sampan on the Tonla Sap River. In the restricted area of fighting, casualties were inevitable, and heavy. Soldiers, women and children were killed and wounded. On the same day, six people were killed and at least 16 injured when a hand grenade exploded at a crowded market in the centre of Phnom Penh. Earlier in the week a hand grenade was thrown into a small Chinese restaurant in the capital, and observers believe the terrorism is timed to coincide with the step-up in military activity. 16mm; silent; colour; 2 min 42 sec.

He still wears his religious robes as he leads his men into battle along Highway Four, in the Khmer Republic's fight to free that strategic highway from communist control. May Um became a soldier in 1970 when the communists entered his village near Kompong Speu and killed several of his fellow monks. At 51, he is a lieutenant, commanding the 120 men of Territorial Company 1023. The troops, equipped only with rifles, are hard pressed to hold their own against the better armed Communist forces. Although it should have ended a long time ago, the monsoon season lasted an extraordinarily long time this year, and the paddy fields are still badly waterlogged. May Um's company has been hard pressed to hold its position in the watery fields when under attack by communist mortars. Fighting has been going on around the company for a week, but May Um hopes to consolidate his position near the highway now that he has added a mortar to the company's inventory. Lieutenant May Um knows his men well - they were all brought up around the village where May was a monk for 30 years. 16mm; silent; colour; 1 min 55 sec.

Military sources said government troops backed by artillery and armoured cars were continuing their sweep against communist forces. By Thursday, every major highway in the Khmer Republic was cut by the communists amid heavy fighting. On Friday night (23 November), communist forces shelled three provincial centres around Phnom Penh. Military sources said at least ten people had been killed and 25 wounded by shelling in the provincial capital of Takeo, 40 miles (60 km) south of Phnom Penh, in 5 days. On Thursday, the town of Mohasaing on Highway 4 fell to communist forces. Troops and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) of the Khmer's most successful unit, the 28th Infantry Brigade, were rushed in to stop the communist advance. More than forty APCs and two battalions of infantry were thrown into the battle. At first there was little resistance from the communists, but after several hours the Khmer forces were halted by heavy mortar and rocket fire, which inflicted serious casualties. The monsoon season in the region has already lasted a month longer than usual. In the ten days before the Mohasaing battle, three towns were lost by the government to the communists. Observers in Phnom Penh say Highway 4 is vital to the defence of the capital, because it is the route for essential supplies coming into the country through the port of Kompong Som. 16mm; silent; colour; 2 min 11 sec.

Advancing through rice paddies still muddy from the recent monsoon rains, the APCs formed a solid frontline for the government troops. Contact was made with the Khmer Rouge. But while the government troops advanced, the communists launched a heavy mortar attack on the provincial capital of Kompong Speu, only 5 miles away. For the past week the fighting along this section of Highway 4, leading to the deep-water port of Kampong Cham, has developed into the largest battle zone since the beginning of the year.

The victory was a morale booster for the government forces and relieved some of the intense communist pressure on Phnom Penh. The Khmer forces had been fighting the insurgents in the area for well over a month with little success. A week ago the battle hardened 80th Infantry Brigade, the successful defenders of Kampong Cham last year, were moved into the front line. However, their initial attack last Wednesday (13 February) was brought to a rapid halt when the Khmer Rougr used poisonous gas.

Visit to a hospital where there were more US soldiers there being treated for drug overdoses than wounded. He was not allowed to visit the Australians as the area between Saigon and Vung Tau was not secure. Awareness that this was a war without frontiers. As he was not able to go out into the war zone he did stories on refugees and orphanages in Saigon. The suffering of the civilians as a by product of war has a greater impact than battle scenes. The black humour of war correspondents. How some Vietnamese did profit from the war. Example of the taxi drivers who would take journalists to the war.

Told to walk in the tank tracks as a way to avoid mines and booby traps. How the Marines forced Vietnamese villagers to walk in front of the tanks as they advanced. The villagers knew where the mines would be because the Viet Cong would alert them so they waste the VC mines. The Marines spotted what they thought was a NVA soldier so the tanks and artillery fired into the village. Bowden's shock as a young boy with a war bufflalo was caught in the fire. The Marines actions at variance with policy of winning the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese. The American troops did not see the Vietnamese as people. Incidents such as this indicated how the My Lai massacre could happen. Bowden explains that to report the war you could not afford to be emotionally involved. Bradbury comments that that technology could not win the war and the media coverage could not change the minds of the people as well. Bowden attributes this to the sameness of the television coverage. Difficultly in getting actual combat footage. The unreality of television cut people of emotionally from what they were viewing. Neil Davis as one cameraman who did go to the front line. Describes Neil Davis as compassionate and one of the most sensitive people he ever met. Davis's instinctive rapport with the Asian people. Davis as the only Western cameraman to go out contiually with the South Vietnamese troops. Bradbury asks if Davis will end up dying on a battlefield. Bowden replies that Davis is very experienced and has been in combat more often than any soldier. He knows when to take risks or not. Though his intution can sometimes let him down pointing out that he was badly wounded by a mortar bomb. 16mm; sound; colour; 10 min 36 sec. Related item: S03265; transcript.
