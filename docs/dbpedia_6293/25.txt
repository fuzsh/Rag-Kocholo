Italy was the defending champion and the favorite. The 10 teams advanced five from round one to the quarter-finals, with France setting an Olympic record of 5:11.4 in the first round. In the quarters, Italy had a walkover in the third heat. France and Belgium won the first two heats and Poland was advanced to the semis as the fastest loser. Both semi-finals saw controversy. In the first Italy and Belgium started, with Italy winning in 5:12.8, Belgium about 100 metres back at the finish. But one of the Belgian riders had a flat tire, so since it was on the first lap the jury allowed the race to be re-run, and Italy still won easily. The second semi saw France against Poland, but the French team crashed on the first circuit. The race was allowed to be re-started, but one of the French riders had been injured in the crash, and Poland won easily. The Dutch team lodged an unsuccessful protest against Poland racing in the semis, claiming that the draw had not been fair, as they had posted a faster time in the first round than Poland, although they had been defeated by Belgium. The final between Italy and Poland was close for six laps, but Italy pulled away on the last two laps to win the gold medal by over a 100 metre margin. Belgium won the bronze medal in the race against France, which had two riders sustain flat tires, causing them to be lapped.
