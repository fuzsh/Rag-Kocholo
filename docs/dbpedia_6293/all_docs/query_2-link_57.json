Check out this quick recap from my time at the National Scholastic Press Association's annual conference for The Foundation for Systemic Change! #dayinthelife #JTPR\n\nWith a degree in Journalism: Sports & Media, you'll learn the skills to share the most interesting stories from the sports field. âš¾ Discover more about this multidisciplinary program: bit.ly/4eIVfp3\n\nWith the help of our #OaklandCounty Career and Education navigators and #Oakland80 resources, we can help students like Niani return to school on any day, not just #HigherEducationDay! Read her story below to learn how we helped Niani head back to post-secondary education. ðŸ‘‡\n\n\"Year by year more people are saying more over more channels on more topics to a bigger total audience\". Irving Fang in his book A History of Mass Communication provides a deep description of Six Information Revolutions and summarises that \"During all six information revolutions, in some region active with the ferment for change, at least one new means of producing communication messages was combined with at least one new means of distributing those messages to a wide audience\". I recommend this book to students of Journalism and Mass Communication. #History #MassCommunication #Information #Revolution #IrvingFang Routledge Taylor & Francis Group School of Liberal Studies UPES"
