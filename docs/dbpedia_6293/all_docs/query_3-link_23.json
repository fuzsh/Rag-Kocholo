This new rule imposes a 4% additional tax on taxable incomes over $1 million (as indexed for inflation). It is important to note that capital gains and irregular income, such as the sale of a home or business, count as income for purposes of determining the tax. The tax will apply to all taxable income received by residents of Massachusetts, or on any income generated in Massachusetts by those who live outside the Commonwealth. High income earners, or those who expect to temporarily have high incomes, may be able to reduce their tax liability with careful planning. Planning Opportunities Trusts. It may be possible to change the residence of a Massachusetts trust to a state with lower or no income tax, like New Hampshire or Florida. Converting grantor trusts to nongrantor trusts, particularly when situated outside of Massachusetts, or using Incomplete grantor trusts (\"INGs\") can also be advantageous. Accelerating Income. The new tax is imposed on taxable incomes received on or after January 1, 2023; closing sales in 2022 will avoid the tax. Change Residency. If income is generated from sources outside of Massachusetts, moving to a state with low income tax environments could result in significant savings. File Separately. The $1 million threshold is not increased for married couples filing jointly, but each member of a married couple filing separately has his or her own $1 million threshold. Defer Income. It may be possible to structure certain sales such that the income is spread out over several years, possibly avoiding imposition of the tax.\n\nfull story\n\nTarlow Breed Hart & Rodgers has been named among the Best Law Firms in America by U.S. News-Best Lawyers® for 2023.

We'll discuss insurance coverage and business losses that can be covered if your firm or company was closed by government order and how losses being covered depends on the language of your insurance policy. We'll also cover civil authority and dependent property coverages, net profit or loss before taxes that would have been earned plus continuing expenses including payroll and extra expenses, whether business interruption insurance applies to your client's business, what steps do you need to take and much more.

This follows the practice of the Bruins team members, who let their facial hair run wild until they are eliminated from contention or win another championship. Participation in the hirsute hijinks requires a $25 contribution – about the amount of savings expected to be accrued from not using shaving supplies for the duration of the playoffs. The funds collected will be donated to charity. We may not be ready to lace up our skates and take to the ice, we are having some fun while cheering on the team. Maybe we can bring a little luck to the boys in black and gold as they seek another Cup. Go Bruins!
