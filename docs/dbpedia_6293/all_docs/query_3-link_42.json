        "text": "For me, Doing LESS is TOUGH. But do you want to know what makes it easier? HIRING AMAZING TEAMMATES. As we transition more responsibilities to our Support Advisors, Nolan Rux and Haley Fuhrmann, we’re getting tasks off my and others' plates so we can lean further into our areas of expertise. I’m not just throwing tasks off to anybody. These two have shown that they’re passionate, thoughtful, ask the right questions, and get the job done right. So, while I’m aspiring to “do less,” it’s opening up my brainpower to focus on big-picture ideas and growth while knowing the whole team is here helping our clients. Learning to do LESS, so I can accomplish MORE for you. *See thrivent.com/social for important information.\n\nUnpopular opinion… you can have it all… most of the time 💜 Entering week three of Techstars Atlanta Powered by Cox Enterprises I feel rested, prepared, and ready for Monday. Here’s why: 1. Rest: I truly took time to unwind on Friday evening and Saturday morning. 2. Joy: I did something that brought me joy, completely unrelated to LiQUiD . I believe in balancing hard work, rest, and adventure. (☑️ off a bucket list item: I took a solo cooking class with Cozymeal, Inc. !) 3. Preparation: I prepared for the week ahead. This included meal prepping, setting goals, clearing my emails, and getting grounded. Finding this balance has been key to feeling ready and energized. 💜\n\nWe're hiring! Move Frogward with JFrog! https://join.jfrog.com/ Have you met your future coworker, Alan Kao, Program Manager at JFrog? Q: How would you describe what you do to your parents? A: Hmmm, I say, “I work with other companies to integrate, promote, and sell our software together. I create marketing strategies and campaigns that help us reach more customers and grow our business!” Q: How does what you do take us Frogward? A: JFrog’s technology integrations take our company Frogward by broadening our capabilities as the universal software supply chain platform and enables us to be too integrated to fail. Q: If a Frog wasn’t our mascot, which other animal would be it? A: I would say a lion. We are pretty fierce and there’s a familial aspect to our culture. We all are close to each other and are tight-knit, like a pride of lions! Q: What’s your favorite JFrog memory? A: Our July 4th party in 2022! Our CEO sat in a dunk tank and I was able to dunk him and won a JFrog-stitched red, white, and blue beach towel! Q: If the JFrog sites were put into a time capsule and discovered by aliens in the year 3215, what would they say? A: They would say, “Why is everything so green? These people love frogs too much!” Q: Why would you encourage someone to work for JFrog? A: Everyone is really friendly here, you can ask a lot of questions and learn a lot. Although we are a public company, we still have somewhat of a startup environment where you can wear a lot of hats and be involved in building new processes and strategies. I don’t feel siloed in my role and also see that my work has a direct impact on the business.\n\nAfter 4 years at 6sense, I’m moving on to a new adventure. The same day that I interviewed in the SF office in March 2020, that office shut down for the pandemic. With the world in a tailspin, it felt like a risky (unwise?) gamble to make that change, from an awesome and secure prior job. But with sky-high confidence in 6sense’s company, product, leadership, and the teammates I met… it was worth it to take the plunge, and (WOW) it totally paid off! The company grew tenfold, and our product innovated by leaps and bounds (recent evidence: https://lnkd.in/gPVZb2ja). I earned 3 consecutive Prez Club trips, won Manager of the Year 2022 in my first year as a leader, and saw 2 of my reps promoted. Full circle now, I can’t imagine a way for it to go better. An amazing ride, highlighted by immense growth for myself, my team, and the company at large. To my stellar AEs (Lilly Juliano, Aubrey Wells, Binetou Fall, Charlie Demuth, Nicholas Coco, Lauren Jones, Jackson Fullmer, Robert Mast, David Andrews, Adriana Rodriguez) - Working with each of you has been the most fulfilling opportunity and challenge of my career to date. The energy, ambition, and growth mindset you bring to the table made me want to show up better every day. I can’t say it better than this quote I’ll steal: “There go the people. I must follow them, for I am their leader.” I doubt I’ve ever learned more in such a short time. For that, I owe gratitude to such a huge roster of friends and colleagues, I can’t even fathom a list. But to keep it short, thanks Kyle Hollingsworth for pushing me so hard to grow and excel, right out the gate. Thanks Michael (Mac) Conn, Gabe Teperow, and Mark Ebert for the leadership opportunity, with a team I felt blessed every day to lead and learn with. Thanks everybody at 6sense - I know y’all will continue to do great things! I’ll post a separate update about… the Future.\n\n#thankyou For all the lovely messages last week checking in to wish me luck on my first day, seeing how the first week went & generally just being the usual wonderful lot that you always are.. Awfully poor form on my part, amidst the hurly-burly of onboarding (which was super slick by the way!), training & all that exciting stuff, I inadvertently turned my back on LinkedIn! 🔙 So, without further ado *drum roll* I'm at Capital on Tap. No shameless sales plug 🔌 in this post as this is more of a 'thank you' but hey if you're curious you know what to do (click it!) Still in my ever beloved Shoreditch, about three minutes from my previous office to be fair, I never seem to stray far from these streets. The candidate experience was on point ➡️ from that very first call through to last week's knowledge dump, I am now chomping at the bit to crack on this week.. Superb opportunity, cracking bunch of people, top notch product AND the snacks, you should see the snacks! #newchapter #newjob #newboy #fintech #tech #techsales #shoreditch #businessdevelopment #bdm #salescareer #mynetwork #network #cheers\n\nYou know what’s hot? Knowledge, ambition and dedication! Our new joiners Natalie Lazarev, Merve Guelenay and Florian Wejda tick off each of these boxes. We couldn’t be happier that they're joining our tribe. 💙 🌟 What makes this hiring cycle a little extra special: With Natalie and Merve, we have two female powerhouses to level up our engineering team. Here’s what they had to say about their new role 🏆: 🗯️ \"As a woman in this field, it’s refreshing to join a team where diversity is appreciated as a catalyst for creativity and progress. It’s not just about the code—it’s about the collective effort to build an innovative financial product.\" (Natalie) 🗯️ \"I've had my computer science and coding education only recently. At Banxware I feel encouraged to take the next step in my new career, learn, contribute and grow. Since the first day, everybody has been welcoming, collaborative and are eager to share their knowledge.\" (Merve) Last but not least, s/o to our new strategic business expansion manager Florian who brought along his dog Kobe. Days at the office just got that much better. Here’s to all four new joiners: Let’s make this ride together a wild one! 🚀💥 #bxwfam #newhires #teamappreciation\n\n46 tech companies have laid off people in 2024 🤯 Here’s how you can help turn lemons into lemonade 👇 For context: 🍋 Here are the lemons 🍋 ➡️ Apple: shut down a 121 person team working on AI…after avoiding layoffs in 2023. ➡️ Google: cut 1,000 employees across Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit. ➡️ Amazon: cut its Audible, Twitch, MGM Studios, and Prime Video teams. ➡️ Discord cut ~17% of its staff. One place where we need all the talent we can get is climate. 🍹How can we make lemonade🍹 1️⃣ I’m giving away 5 exceptional talent scholarships to anyone who was recently laid off. Personally sponsoring our talent-into-climate program for mid-career professionals looking for impact and purpose. Our project-based hiring approach replaces the frustrating process of endless resume sending and countless interview rounds. While giving climate tech companies an easy way to understand if a person can execute. Leading Investors, cutting edge climate tech companies and global recruiters are supporting and backing our program 🔥 2️⃣ How you can help: Share this post with your network 💪 Know somebody who is looking for impact, for purpose and who wants to make a difference in this world?

In case you’re wondering ❓Why trust my advice❓ Maybe this helps (slightly blushing as I write this 😳) → I taught 100s of students at the best universities (Harvard, etc.) → Personally helped 1,000s of people transition careers. → Built a 6-figure, 7-figure, and a 8-figure business. → Advising 10+ early-stage impact companies.\n\nBit of a late post - A few weeks ago, I completed a Business Development Fellowship with Earlywork 🚀 In the span of 3 weeks, I was taught the foundational skills in tech sales, such as prospecting, cold calling, LinkedIn and so much more. My 3 biggest takeaways from the program were: 1. Resilience is your best friend, helping you bounce back stronger when things get tough💪 2. The importance of building genuine connections; it's all about having real conversations and finding common ground🤝 3. Be curious and always ask questions, because that's how you uncover hidden gems that lead to success🤔 With the help of Earlywork, I will soon be starting a new role as a Business Software Consultant at BrightHR! Super excited to get started 🌞 If you're eyeing a career switch and itching to dive into the tech scene, Earlywork is where it's at - I highly recommend!"
