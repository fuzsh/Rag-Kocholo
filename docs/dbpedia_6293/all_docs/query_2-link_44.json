Today the committee receives testimony from Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy, and General David Petraeus, Commander, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan. We thank you both for your years of service to the Nation and the sacrifice made by both you and your families. We also cannot express enough our gratitude and admiration for the men and women in uniform deployed in Afghanistan and elsewhere. They are doing a phenomenal job. Their morale is high. Our troops are truly awe-inspiring. Please pass along our heartfelt thanks to them. It has now been a little over a year since President Obama's speech at West Point announcing his strategy for Afghanistan. That strategy included two key elements: a surge of 30,000 U.S. troops to help reverse the Taliban's momentum and seize the initiative; and the setting of a date 18 months from then, or July 2011, for when U.S. troops would begin to come home. The setting of that July date also laid down a marker for when the Government of Afghanistan would assume more and more responsibility for that country's security. During his visit to Afghanistan last week, Secretary Gates determined that ``we will be well-positioned for transitioning increasing security responsibility to Afghanistan and beginning to draw down some U.S. forces in July of this year''. President Karzai is expected to announce next week the first phase of provinces and districts throughout Afghanistan that will transition lead for providing security to the Afghan people. We've heard two messages in recent months relative to the July 2011 date when U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan will begin to be reduced. Message number 1: Secretary Gates before this committee recently said that the July date was needed as a way of telling the Afghan leadership ``to take ownership of the war'' and as a way to ``grab the attention of the Afghan leadership and bring a sense of urgency to them.'' Message number 2: Secretary Gates, speaking at the NATO Defence Ministers meeting last week, said, ``There is too much talk about leaving and not enough talk about getting the job done right.'' Now, some may dismiss those messages as inconsistent, or say that Secretary Gates is speaking to two different audiences, but I disagree. Secretary Gates well knows that with modern global, instantaneous communications the world is the audience for every utterance. The unifying thread in the two messages is that both are needed for success of the mission. Success requires Afghan buy-in, Afghans taking the lead and Afghan ownership of the mission, all of which in turn depend upon their confidence in our continuing support. Both messages, and the thread that unifies them, are part and parcel, I believe, of General Petraeus' counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy which is so instrumental in turning the tide in Afghanistan. The success of the mission depends on Afghan security forces holding the ground which they are helping to clear of Taliban, and that, to use General Mattis's words before this committee recently, is what ``undercuts the enemy's narrative when they say that we're there to occupy Afghanistan.'' The growth in the size and capability of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and control of territory by those forces is robbing the Taliban of their propaganda target and bringing us closer to the success of the mission. That's why I have pushed so hard to grow the size of the Afghan security forces and to keep metrics on how many Afghan units are partnered with us and being mentored by us, and how often Afghan units are in the lead in joint operations. That's why a number of us are pushing so hard, including with the President himself, for approval of the pending proposal of up to 70,000 additional Afghan troops and police. The NATO training command in Afghanistan has done an extraordinary job not only building the numbers of the ANSF, but improving their quality as well, focusing on marksmanship, training, leadership and literacy. This success in recruiting and training Afghan troops reflects the desire of the Afghan people to provide for their own security. That success is why Taliban suicide bombers attack recruiting centers. The young men signing up represent the Taliban's worst nightmare. During our visit to Afghanistan in January Senator Jack Reed, Senator Jon Tester, and I saw how the Afghan people have growing confidence in the ability of Afghan and coalition forces to provide security in former Taliban strongholds in Helmand and Kandahar Provinces. The Afghan people are returning to villages and communities and starting to rebuild their lives. Joint operations are increasingly Afghan-led in their planning and execution. As the Afghan people see their own forces providing ongoing protection after the Taliban are cleared out, Afghan confidence in the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) grows. In the Arghandab district, the number of tips from locals increased significantly, enabling Afghanistan and coalition forces to find and clear a much greater percentage of improvised explosive devices (IED). The increasing support of the Afghan people across Helmand and Kandahar has also allowed partnered coalition special operations forces and Afghan commandos to target large numbers of insurgent leaders in the last few months, with the vast majority of them being captured without a shot being fired. The growing support of the Afghan people for their security forces will make the transition to an Afghan security lead more achievable in the short-term and sustainable over time. Certainly, challenges lie ahead. General Petraeus has said there will be a Taliban spring offensive, and Secretary Gates has warned that this spring's fighting season will be ``the acid test,'' in his words, as the Taliban tries to take back the terrain it has lost and engages in a campaign of assassination and intimidation. Afghan leaders need to bring a sense of urgency to improving governance, delivering services, and fighting corruption and other practices that prey upon the Afghan people if they're to earn the support of the people for the Afghan Government, and additional steps must be taken to end the safe havens that insurgents use in Pakistan which impact on Afghanistan's security. Finally, General Petraeus briefed NATO defense ministers at the meeting in Brussels last week, and I hope that he will address the outcomes from that meeting, including whether any further commitments by our NATO partners were forthcoming to address the continuing shortfall in trainers of Afghan troops. Also of interest would be the status of any discussions on a longer-term relationship between the United States, NATO, and Afghanistan beyond 2014. Again, our thanks to our witnesses for their work on behalf of our Nation, and for their devotion to the men and women who defend us. Senator McCain. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN McCAIN Senator McCain. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to welcome our distinguished witnesses and thank them for their service to our Nation. I want to say a special note of thanks to General Petraeus. The truest test of a commander is whether he is worthy of the sacrifice made by those he leads, whether the young men and women whom we call upon day-in and day-out to risk their lives for us feel that their commander offers the same degree of devotion as they do. We are fortunate that General Petraeus is such a commander. It is Congress' highest priority to be just as worthy of the sacrifices made by the men and women of our Armed Forces and to provide them with everything they need to succeed in their mission of defending our Nation. So, let me take this opportunity again to say that we urgently need to pass a full year appropriations bill on defense for the remainder of fiscal year 2011, as the Secretary of Defense has repeatedly called for. It is irresponsible to continue funding our fellow Americans fighting two wars through piecemeal continuing resolutions that do not meet their full needs. Perhaps the greatest need of all right now is winning the war in Afghanistan, which is the subject of this hearing. The cost of our commitment to this conflict remains substantial, especially the precious lives we have lost. According to one new poll reported on in today's Washington Post, a majority of Americans no longer support the war. The next several months will therefore be decisive as winter turns to spring, and the traditional fighting season begins in Afghanistan. NATO forces will surely face a renewed Taliban offensive this spring to retake the territory and momentum they have lost on the battlefield, and those losses have been considerable. U.S., NATO, and Afghan Special Forces have dealt a crushing blow to the mid-level leadership of the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies. Afghan and coalition surge forces are recapturing the momentum in key terrain areas such as Kandahar and Helmand. Afghan security forces are growing in quantity and improving in quality even faster than planned, and the Afghan local police (ALP) initiative is empowering communities across the country to provide their own security from the bottom up, while Kabul does so from the top down. The cumulative effect of these security operations is that we are turning around the war in Afghanistan. But, as General Petraeus says and will emphasize, this progress remains fragile and reversible, and the sustainability of our gains will be tested during the fighting season ahead. We should all be very clear about the fact that violence will go up in the months ahead, and we will surely encounter setbacks in some places. As a result, we need to be exceedingly cautious about withdrawal of the U.S. forces this July, as the President has called for. Now, we should be mindful that perhaps the wisest course of action in July may be to reinvest troops from more secured to less secured parts of Afghanistan, where additional forces could have a decisive impact. In short, we should not rush to failure, and we should cultivate strategic patience. This patience will be all the more essential as we wrestle with two other key challenges, which our military operations are necessary but not sufficient to meet. The first is governance and corruption. American taxpayers want to know that the vast resources they are committing to this war effort are not being wasted, stolen, or misused by Afghan officials, but we must not allow this legitimate and critical demand to feed a sense of fatalism about our objectives. Some are alarmed that the Afghan Government is at times a weak partner, but that's the norm in any counterinsurgency. After all, if our local partners provided good governance already, there would not be an insurgency in the first place. The goal of any counterinsurgency is to create the conditions that enable our local partners to provide better, more effective, and more just governance for their people. That does not mean that we are trying to make Afghanistan like us, but rather more like Afghanistan used to be prior to the past three decades of civil war, when the country enjoyed half a century of relative peace and rising standards of living. A second key challenge stems from Pakistan--the growing instability of the country, the insurgent safe havens that remain there, the ties to terrorists that still exist among elements of Pakistan's military and intelligence services, and the seeming deterioration of our relationship amid the continued detention of U.S. Embassy official Raymond Davis. But here, too, a measure of patience is needed. We have sought every means to compel Pakistan to reorient its strategic calculus short of cutting off U.S. assistance, which we did before to no positive effect. To be sure, Pakistan deserves praise for some steps it has taken to fight al Qaeda and Taliban groups on the Pakistani side of the border. But what we must increasingly recognize is that perhaps the most effective way to end Pakistan's support for terrorist groups that target our partners and our personnel in the region is to succeed in Afghanistan. Ultimately, it is only when an Afghan Government and security force is capable of neutralizing the terrorist groups backed by some in Pakistan that those Pakistani leaders could come to see that a strategy of hedging their bets in this conflict will only leave them less secure and more isolated. We have made a great deal of progress in Afghanistan since the last hearing of this committee on the subject just over half a year ago. Whereas the momentum was then still with the insurgency, our forces have now blunted it in many places and reversed it in key areas of the fight. It is now possible to envision a process of transition to Afghan responsibility for security based on conditions on the ground, with 2014 being a reachable target date. But for that transition to be truly irreversible, and for it to lead to an enduring strategic partnership between the United States and Afghanistan, our country, and especially this Congress, must remain committed to this fight and those Americans waging it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Levin. Thank you very much, Senator McCain. Secretary Flournoy. STATEMENT OF HON. MICHELE A. FLOURNOY, UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY Ms. Flournoy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Senator McCain, and distinguished members of the committee. Thank you very much for inviting us here today to update you on our efforts in Afghanistan. Nearly 10 years ago, al Qaeda operatives carried out terrorist attacks that killed thousands of Americans and citizens from other countries. As we all know, these attacks emanated from a safe haven in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. In response to the September 11th attacks, the United States, supported by vital international partners, entered Afghanistan by force in order to remove the Taliban regime and to prevent further attacks by al Qaeda and its associates. Our mission was just, it was fully supported by the international community, and initially, it was quite successful. In the years that followed, however, we lost focus on Afghanistan. While our attention was turned away, al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated extremist groups reconstituted their safe havens along the borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan. As a result of this inattention, we risked the return of a Taliban-led Afghanistan that would likely once again provide a safe haven for terrorists who could plan and execute attacks against the United States. When President Obama took office, he immediately undertook a thorough review of our strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and reaffirmed our core goal, to disrupt, dismantle, and eventually defeat al Qaeda, and to prevent its return to Afghanistan. In the course of that review we found that the situation in Afghanistan was even worse than we thought and that the Taliban had seized the momentum on the ground. In response, over the course of 2009 and 2010 the President committed tens of thousands of additional U.S. forces to reverse that momentum. Last December we conducted a follow-on review of the strategy's implementation. In the course of that review we reaffirmed our core goal and the strategy's key elements, a military campaign to degrade the Taliban-led insurgency, a civilian campaign to build Afghan capacity to secure and govern the country, and an increased diplomatic effort designed to bring a favorable and endurable outcome to the conflict. Over the last year we have made significant progress. With the troop surge, the U.S. and our ISAF partners now have over 150,000 troops in Afghanistan putting relentless pressure on the insurgents and securing more and more of the Afghan population. That surge has been matched by a surge in the numbers, quality and capability of the ANSF. During the past year, the ANSF have increased by more than 70,000 and we have been able to improve their quality substantially by developing Afghan non-commissioned officers and trainers, expanding the training curriculum, adding literacy programs, increasing retention rates, and partnering Afghan units with ISAF forces in the field. As General Petraeus will describe in detail, U.S. and ISAF forces fighting side-by-side with increasingly capable Afghan units throughout the country have wrested the initiative from the insurgents, even in the strongholds of central Helmand and Kandahar Provinces, and we've turned up the pressure on al Qaeda and its affiliates in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan, significantly degrading, though not yet defeating, their ability to plan and conduct operations. One contributor to this positive momentum is the ALP initiative, a village-focused security program that has already significantly disrupted insurgent activity, denied insurgent influence in key areas, and generated serious concern among the Taliban leadership. At the same time, we've ramped up our civilian efforts to improve Afghan governance and development. Today, thanks to the civilian surge, there are more than 1,000 civilian experts from nine different U.S. agencies helping to build Afghan governance and economic capacity, work that is absolutely vital to the ultimate success of our overall mission in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the significant gains we've made in the last year are still reversible. There is tough fighting ahead, and major challenges remain. Most notably, we must continue our efforts with Pakistan to eliminate terrorist and insurgent safe havens. We seek to build an effective partnership that advances both U.S. and Pakistani interests, including the denial of safe havens to all violent extremist organizations. To do so, we must demonstrate to our Pakistani partners that we will remain a strong supporter of their security and prosperity, both now and in the years to come, even as we ask them to do even more to defeat terrorism. In addition, we must work with the Afghan Government to tackle corruption, especially predatory corruption that erodes public trust and fuels the insurgency, and we must help create the conditions necessary to enable a political settlement among the Afghan people. This includes reconciling those insurgents who are willing to renounce al Qaeda, forsake violence, and adhere to the Afghan constitution. This July we will begin a responsible conditions-based drawdown of our surge forces in Afghanistan. We will also begin the process of transitioning provinces to Afghan lead for security, and by the end of 2014, we expect that Afghans will be in the lead for security nation-wide. This transition is a process, not an event. The process will unfold village by village, district by district, province by province. The determination of when the transition will occur and where it will occur is going to be based on bottom-up assessments of local conditions. This process is beginning now and, in fact, we do expect President Karzai to announce the first round of districts and provinces for transition on March 21st. As this transition process gets underway, and as ANSF capabilities continue to develop, we and our ISAF partners will thin out our forces as conditions allow, and gradually shift to more and more of a mentoring role with the ANSF. Some of the ISAF forces that are moved out of a given area will be reinvested in other geographic areas or in the training effort, in order to further advance the transition process. The objective here is to ensure that the transition is irreversible. We have no intention of declaring premature transitions, only to have to come back and finish the job later. We would much rather stick to a gradual approach, making sure that an area is truly ready for transition before thinning out the ISAF forces there. This is the surest path to lasting success. But let me be clear. The transition that will take place between now and December 2014 in no way signals our abandonment of Afghanistan. President Obama and President Karzai have agreed that the United States and Afghanistan will have an enduring strategic partnership beyond 2014, and we are currently working with the details of that partnership. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the very real costs of this war. Many of you have expressed concern about these costs, and especially in light of our battlefield casualties and our fiscal pressures here at home. But the Afghan-Pakistan borderlands have served as a crucible for the most catastrophic terrorist actions of the past decade. The outcome we seek is the defeat of al Qaeda and the denial of the region as a sanctuary for terrorists. This objective is the reason why our brave men and women in service have sacrificed so very much, and we are determined to bring this war to a successful conclusion, for the sake of our own security, but also for the sake of the security of the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the region who have suffered so much and who have so much to gain from a secure and lasting peace. Members of this committee, I want to thank you for providing us with this opportunity today. I also look forward to your continued and invaluable support for the policies and programs that are critical to our success in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Flournoy follows:] Prepared Statement by Hon. Michele A. Flournoy Mr. Chairman, ranking member, and distinguished members of the committee: thank you for inviting us here to update you on our efforts in Afghanistan. Ten years ago, al Qaeda operatives organized a deadly attack from a safe-haven in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that killed thousands of Americans and citizens of other countries. In response, the United States, supported by valued international partners, entered Afghanistan by force in order to remove the Taliban regime and to prevent further attacks by al Qaeda and other extremist groups operating in the region. Our mission was just, fully supported by the international community, and initially successful. In the years that followed, however, we lost focus on Afghanistan. The war in Iraq drained resources from Afghanistan and, while our attention was turned away, al Qaeda, the Taliban and associated extremist groups reconstituted their safe-havens straddling the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan from which they have launched attacks and sustained a resilient insurgency. At the time, we did not appreciate their resiliency, their determination to regain what they had lost, and their continuing capacity to grievously harm the United States and our allies. The return of the Taliban in Afghanistan put at risk all that we had accomplished during the first years of the war and reminded people throughout the region of previous episodes when the U.S. misunderstood the region's challenges and underestimated the commitment required to achieve our objectives. As I discussed with this committee last year, through our inattention, we risked the return of a Taliban-led Afghanistan that would likely provide a safe-haven for terrorists who could again plan and execute attacks against the United States and our allies. President Obama, immediately upon taking office, led a thorough review of our strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan and reaffirmed our core goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda, to deny it safe haven in the region, and to prevent it from again threatening the United States and our allies. In the course of that review, we found that the situation was worse than we had thought and that the Taliban had seized the momentum in Afghanistan. In response, the President committed tens of thousands of additional U.S. forces to degrade the Taliban insurgency, thereby providing time and space to build sufficient Afghan capacity. Similarly, our North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Allies and other partner nations surged additional forces of their own. Perhaps most importantly, we began an intensified effort to increase the size, skills, and effectiveness of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). In December 2009, the President directed the deployment of an additional 30,000 surge forces to Afghanistan to increase security, reverse the Taliban's momentum and set the conditions for a transition to Afghan security lead. He also directed that we would begin a reduction of those surge forces in July 2011, saying, ``We will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground.'' Last December, we conducted a follow-on review of our strategy's implementation in which we reaffirmed our core goal and the strategy's key elements: a military campaign to degrade al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists and Taliban insurgents; a civilian campaign to build Afghan governmental capacity; and an increased diplomatic effort designed to bring a favorable and durable outcome to the armed conflict and provide a more secure future for the United States, our allies and partners, and the region. The review found that our strategy was on track, that our forces and civilians were making real progress on the ground, and that we were making great strides in growing an ANSF capable of ultimately providing security in Afghanistan. The review also validated the Lisbon Summit Declaration that called for Afghan forces to assume full responsibility for security across the whole of Afghanistan by the end of 2014, and confirmed that we will be ready to begin a responsible drawdown of our surge forces in July 2011. The review also identified several important challenges we must address. We must continue our efforts with Pakistan to eliminate the safe havens from which al Qaeda senior leaders continue to operate and from which insurgents are able to launch attacks against Afghanistan, Pakistan, and our own forces. We must work with the Afghan Government to tackle corruption, particularly predatory corruption that affects individual Afghan citizens in their daily lives and fuels the insurgency, as well as high level corruption that can undermine the trust of the Afghan people in their own government. In addition, we must work to reduce intra-regional sources of tension that affect Afghanistan's stability, spur economic development, and create the conditions necessary to enable a political settlement among Afghans and reconcile those insurgents who are willing to renounce al Qaeda, forsake violence, and adhere to the Afghan constitution. Since the review, we have continued to make progress. Our strategy is working. With the surge, the United States and our International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) partners have over 140,000 forces in Afghanistan placing relentless pressure on the insurgents and regaining more and more critical territory. That surge has been matched by a surge in the numbers, quality and capability of the ANSF. During the past year, the ANSF have increased by more than 70,000 personnel, and we have been able to improve quality by developing noncommissioned officers and Afghan trainers, expanding the training curriculum, adding literacy programs, and increasing retention rates. As General Petraeus will describe in detail, U.S., NATO, and other ISAF forces, partnered and fighting side-by-side with increasingly capable ANSF units throughout Afghanistan, have wrested the initiative from the insurgents and have successfully cleared the Taliban from much of the country, including strongholds in and around Kandahar and Helmand Provinces. We have turned up the pressure on al Qaeda and their affiliated groups in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan and have significantly degraded their ability to plan and conduct operations throughout the theater. Complementing our joint military operations are important, bottom- up security initiatives, led by our special forces, that provide basic assistance to Afghan communities that desire to resist Taliban influence and connect with their district and provincial government. The Afghan Local Police (ALP) program is a temporary, village-focused security program that aims to deny Taliban territory and freedom of movement in selected areas that have a limited ANSF presence. Today we have 26 validated ALP sites with a total strength of approximately 4,000 Afghans. ALP programs have already significantly disrupted insurgent activity, denied insurgent influence in key areas, and generated serious concern among the Taliban leadership. These programs complement counterinsurgency operations, ANSF development, and civilian development programs to enhance stability. Along with our military successes, we have also ramped up our civilian efforts to improve Afghan governance and increase economic opportunity for the Afghan people. Today, thanks to the ``civilian surge,'' there are more than 1,100 civilian experts from 9 U.S. departments and agencies working with the Afghan Government and civil society in an effort to increase capacity and improve services delivered at the district, province and national level--with more and more of the effort directed at the local level. This is no small task in one of the poorest nations in the world with a vast and varied geography and a population of some 30 million people who have been traumatized by over 30 years of nearly continuous war. Reintegration is now a viable alternative for those insurgents willing to break their ties to al Qaeda, renounce violence, and agree to abide by the Afghan Constitution. I want to thank Congress for recognizing this strategic requirement and providing us important authorities and funding to support reintegration. Likewise, in London last year, the international community pledged financial support for the Afghan Government's comprehensive program designed to draw insurgents off the battlefield and help communities reintegrate them back into Afghan society. This past winter, we observed many favorable examples of both formal and informal reintegration. Formal reintegration is carried out through the three phases of the Afghan Peace and Reconciliation Process: outreach, demobilization, and community recovery. To date, nearly 20 provinces have created reintegration councils, and several hundred militants have left the battlefield through this process. Informal reintegration, which is more common, but less easily measured, refers to those insurgents who simply stop fighting and become productive members of their community. While reintegration reduces the manpower available to the insurgency, reconciliation focuses on the development of a political solution that ends armed opposition to the Afghan Government by major insurgent groups. This past June, President Karzai convened the Afghan Consultative Peace Jirga that established a framework for national reconciliation. He also formed the High Peace Council that includes representation from each of Afghanistan's major ethnic and political stakeholders, including women. The High Peace Council has had substantive discussions with representatives from a variety of insurgent groups and recently met with key leaders in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey to help build consensus towards a political resolution of the conflict. The United States strongly supports these Afghan-led efforts, though we recognize that this will not be a quick or easy process. We have always recognized that we cannot succeed in Afghanistan through military operations alone. We welcome and encourage peaceful political participation by those Taliban leaders who are willing to reject al Qaeda, foreswear violence, and accept the Afghan Constitution in order to reconcile with their fellow Afghans. As Secretary Clinton recently said, ``Taliban militants will have to decide that they are better off working within the Afghan political system rather than fighting a losing struggle alongside al Qaeda . . . '' As we consider a political process in Afghanistan, we must understand the broad regional dynamics at play. Afghanistan is a proud and sovereign nation that fears and resents meddling or interference in its affairs by its neighbors. Nevertheless, Iran and Pakistan still hold the potential to support or spoil progress in Afghanistan. India and the Central Asian States also seek to have their deep concerns about the security and stability of the region addressed. We will endeavor to work together with these nations to support our core goal in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the long-term stability of the region. Let me turn now to some of the key milestones and challenges that lie ahead. Transition--or Inteqal in Dari--is a process by which the ANSF will progressively take lead responsibility for the security of Afghan provinces and municipalities from ISAF. Transition is built upon the following principles: Transition is a process, not an event and will be based upon an assessment of conditions on the ground. Transition is a bottom-up process that will be informed by local assessments. Transition is a process by which ISAF will ``thin out'' and progressively shift, as conditions allow, from a partnering role, to a mentoring role. Headquarters elements will be retained, even as combat elements thin out to facilitate and enable ANSF operations. As ISAF thins out, some of the ``transition dividend'' will likely be reinvested in other geographic or functional areas such as training. The transition process goes beyond terrain and also applies to key Afghan governmental institutions. We must ensure that get transition right the first time, so this process is irreversible. The Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB) met in February to determine which areas were ready for transition. This assessment was based on the readiness of the ANSF to take the lead for security responsibilities and the readiness of local government structures to provide necessary services to the people. The results of the JANIB were reviewed at last week's NATO Defense Ministerial meeting and we expect President Karzai to announce his decision on the first tranche of municipalities and provinces for transition on March 21. We should expect the implementation of the transition process to reflect the diverse circumstances and varied requirements of districts and provinces across Afghanistan. That said, our objective in each case is for transition to be an irreversible process that will unfold during the months and years ahead city by city, district by district, and province by province, as the security situation improves and Afghan capacity grows. During the transition, Coalition forces will ``thin out'' and move from a position of being in the lead for security to one where Afghan forces are in the lead with an ISAF partner: first in tactical overwatch, then in strategic overwatch. In addition to transition in the field, we are also building capacity in the Ministries of Defense and Interior to enable the transition of key functions at the national level. Even by the end of 2014 when Afghans will have the lead for security nationwide, I anticipate that some U.S. forces will remain in Afghanistan in order to train and assist the ANSF and conduct combined counterterrorism operations. As the President directed, the surge forces that we deployed to Afghanistan last year will conduct a responsible, conditions-based force reduction beginning in July 2011. I know that General Petraeus will expand upon this issue, but let me just say that it is too early to put a number on the size of the initial withdrawal. The pace and scope of this withdrawal will be based upon conditions on the ground. At the same time, as the transition process continues, and as ISAF forces thin out in a given district or province, we anticipate that some forces will be reinvested in other geographic areas or missions, such as training the ANSF. The transition that will take place between now and December 2014 in no way signals our abandonment of Afghanistan. Our nation has made that mistake before, and we are determined not to repeat it. President Obama and President Karzai have agreed that the United States and Afghanistan will have an enduring strategic partnership beyond 2014, and we are currently working with the Afghans on the details of that partnership. Afghans must stand in the lead, but they will not stand alone. This strategic partnership, along with the enduring partnership declaration NATO signed with President Karzai at the Lisbon Summit, sends an important message to the government and people of Afghanistan, to our friends and allies, to al Qaeda and the Taliban, and to others in the region: we remain committed to Afghanistan. As we responsibly reduce our combat forces, and as Afghan forces take the lead, we will continue to work with the Afghan people to assist them in the development of their key institutions. Although the scope of our commitment will evolve, our core goal will remain unchanged. Meanwhile, logistical support also remains a challenge in Afghanistan. We are working, along with the Department of State, to secure the additional approvals that we need from countries participating in the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) that will allow us to further reduce the load we place on Pakistan's infrastructure and provide additional routes for our personnel and cargo transiting into Afghanistan. We have already secured necessary approvals from Russia and we are negotiating with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to conclude further agreements and arrangements regarding NDN routes that they control. We likewise appreciate the cooperation we have had with Kyrgyzstan's democratically elected government to support our use of the Transit Center at Manas and have recently concluded an agreement with Kyrgyzstan that will permit us to contract with a new state-owned enterprise to help meet our fuel needs. Together, these efforts demonstrate the broader and shared interest in regional cooperation to bring an end to extremism and to support a stable and secure Afghanistan. Pakistan, too, is inextricably linked to a successful outcome in the region, in both the near and long term. Pakistan has a pivotal role to play in our efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates; to help bring about a durable political solution in Afghanistan; and to promote and sustain long-term regional stability. A lasting political solution in Afghanistan will require Pakistan to be part of the process. However, Pakistan will have to respect Afghan sovereignty and work with Afghanistan to improve regional stability. Additionally, Pakistan must take decisive steps to ensure that the Afghan Taliban cannot continue to conduct the insurgency from Pakistani territory. Continued pressure from the Pakistani side is essential to help push the Taliban toward reconciliation. Pursuing a strategic partnership with Pakistan based on a foundation of mutual interest, mutual respect, and mutual trust guides our civilian-military efforts. Over the long term, this partnership could lead to enduring linkages between our two peoples; stronger trade and investment ties; greater regional and internal stability; and a secure Pakistan whose regionally-integrated economy is growing and benefiting all of its people and its neighbors. There is no question that there are significant hurdles to overcome to realize this vision. The history of U.S.-Pakistan relations is fraught with disappointments, leading many in both countries to see our relationship as driven by transitory interests. In Pakistan, this is manifested in the expectation that we may abandon the region once again as soon as we have achieved our immediate objectives in Afghanistan. Our efforts to date have yielded progress in changing this mindset. However, overcoming years of mistrust will take patience, as well as sustained effort and resources. Our approach with Pakistan is to build an effective partnership that advances both U.S. and Pakistani interests, while also demonstrating to our Pakistani partners that we will remain a strong supporter of their security and prosperity over the long-term. Central to our efforts is aligning U.S. and Pakistani interests with respect to denying safe haven to all violent extremist organizations. Pakistan's people have suffered greatly at the hands of extremists, with approximately 20,000-30,000 civilian casualties resulting from attacks on mosques, schools--particularly girls' schools--and even a World Food Program food distribution site. Pakistan's military has incurred nearly 3,000 personnel killed in action and over 8,000 wounded as a result of extremist attacks and kinetic operations against militants. In addition to the human toll, the financial burden of nearly a decade of conflict inside of and adjacent to Pakistan has been significant, both in opportunity costs of economic growth and in sustaining more than 140,000 troops in combat along on their border with Afghanistan. Still, Pakistan has continued the fight. Pakistan's will to confront extremist organizations, particularly those that it does not view as a direct threat to the Pakistani state, remains a key challenge. However, its deficiencies in capacity are even more daunting. Pakistan faces a determined, complex, and resilient set of insurgent enemies. Pakistan's military has historically focused on a major conventional land war with India and they still view India as their existential threat. The capabilities needed for a counterinsurgency campaign are different and require appropriate training and equipment. We are helping Pakistan to build this much needed capacity through train and equip programs funded by the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund (PCF) and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capabilities Fund (PCCF), for which Congress has provided significant support. However, enhancing Pakistan's counterinsurgency capabilities to the level needed for successful operations to clear areas then ``hold'' and ``build'' in them will require our sustained civilian and military assistance. Before addressing some of Pakistan's key deficiencies, it is important to remark on the progress Pakistan's military has achieved to date. First, Pakistani operations since 2009 in Swat, South Waziristan, and a number of other agencies and areas in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (formerly known as the Northwest Frontier Province), are unprecedented. Second, Pakistan's movement of six divisions, or one-third of their Army, from the Indian border to the border with Afghanistan demonstrates their recognition of the significant threat emanating from certain extremist groups. Third, Pakistan's military leadership has increased cross-border coordination with ISAF and Afghan security forces. Part of this increased coordination resulted from a tragic accident that occurred last September when ISAF forces accidentally killed three Pakistani border soldiers who were mistaken for insurgents. This incident not only led to enhanced procedures being put in place to avoid future such tragedies, but also a greater measure of operational coordination designed to ensure that kinetic operations on one side of the border do not allow insurgents to escape with impunity to the other. Such coordination would have been impossible just 2 years ago. However, despite this progress, Pakistan's military forces have not yet established effective control over important areas where extremists and insurgents operate. In many cases where the military has undertaken operations to clear insurgents and hold territory, Pakistan's inadequate civilian and military capacities for the ``build'' phase have prevented ultimate transfer of those areas to civilian control. This deficiency forces the Pakistan military to leave large numbers of forces in cleared areas to ``hold'' them for indefinite periods of time rather than redeploying them to undertake new operations. In several cases, such as Mohmand Agency, military forces have been required to repeat clearing operations as insurgents have reinfiltrated. Addressing these issues will not only require sustained military and security assistance, but the financial assistance provided through the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, also known as Kerry-Lugar-Berman. The efforts the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are undertaking through the Strategic Dialogue to reach all segments of Pakistan's population with civilian capacity training and new infrastructure are essential elements for Pakistan's ability to ``hold'' and ``build'' areas to make them resistant to militant return. In many ways, we are still in the early stages of seeing our renewed civilian-military partnership with Pakistan gain traction. Our team in the Office of the Defense Representative--Pakistan has been able to build and nurture partnerships with Pakistan's security forces on every level, including during the historic flooding and subsequent recovery efforts in the summer of 2010. These relationships have been critical to working through challenges that might once have broken the relationship, such as the late September 2010 incident on the Pakistani border post. Instead, the ability to continue communicating through crises has led to greater coordination that advances our mutual interest in a stable and secure Pakistan. We have also made significant progress by supporting Pakistan's efforts to define their near and long-term requirements as they restructure their forces to take on this counterinsurgency fight. Through the Exchanges in Defense Planning (EDP) process, we worked with the Pakistani military leadership to develop a shared 5-year vision for training and procurement. That shared vision formed the basis for the administration's fiscal year 2012 request for $350 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF), $5 million in International Military Education and Training (IMET), and $1.1 billion in PCCF for the first year of the Multi-Year Security Assistance Commitment for Pakistan that Secretary Clinton announced in October 2010. That commitment includes $2.029 billion of FMF and IMET over 5 years, with PCCF levels set annually according to conditions on the ground. ``Train-advise-and-equip'' programs with Pakistan's military and paramilitary forces are central to pursuing our near-term objectives of eliminating terrorist sanctuaries and disrupting and defeating the al Qaeda network. Through congressional support for programs like the PCF and PCCF, we are increasing Pakistan's capacity to take on militant networks. This effort will take time, and we are working to reform our security assistance system to make it more responsive to the wartime train-and-equip needs of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other partners. Let me conclude my remarks on Pakistan with a comment concerning the detention of U.S. diplomat Raymond Davis. The U.S. Government remains extremely concerned about the continued detention of Mr. Davis and views this as a violation of Pakistan's international commitments under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The State Department remains actively engaged in a dialogue with the Government of Pakistan about releasing Mr. Davis as quickly as possible. It is critical, however, that we work to resolve this issue, so that it does not derail the important progress we have made in the last 2 years in building a stronger and deeper relationship between our countries. Finally, I would like to turn to the human and financial costs of this war. Many of you have expressed concern with these costs, especially in light of our battlefield casualties and our fiscal pressures here at home. You face these costs each time you sign a letter to a constituent who has lost a loved one and each time you vote on war funding. This concern has been expressed by our ISAF allies and partners as well. But, let me be absolutely clear. As the President said, the threat to our national security and the security of our friends and allies that emanates from the borderland of Afghanistan and Pakistan is not hypothetical. There is simply no other place in the world that contains such a concentration of al Qaeda senior leaders and operational commanders. Al Qaeda and the other terrorist organizations that operate in this region have a proven ability to infiltrate across borders to conduct attacks. These dangerous groups have established safe-havens inside of a nuclear-armed state and they are allied with the Taliban, a movement that seeks to overthrow the Government of Afghanistan and contributes to the destabilization of Pakistan. To allow these hostile organizations to flourish in this region is to put the security of the United States and our friends and allies at grave risk. In conclusion, I want to reiterate the basic principle that is at the heart of our efforts in Afghanistan. The outcome we seek is the defeat of al Qaeda and the denial of the region as a sanctuary for al Qaeda and its affiliates. This objective is the reason why our brave servicemen and servicewomen have sacrificed so much. It is why we have invested so much treasure. This remote region has served as a crucible for the most catastrophic terrorist actions of the past decade. As we learned at great cost after abandoning the region in 1989, staying engaged over the long term is critical to achieving lasting peace and stability in this region and to securing our national interests. We are determined to bring this war to a successful conclusion, for the sake of our own security, but also for the security of the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan who have suffered so much, and who have so much to gain from a secure, lasting peace. Members of the committee, I want to thank you for providing the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to your continued and invaluable support for the policies and programs that are critical to our success in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Chairman Levin. Thank you very much, Secretary Flournoy. General Petraeus. STATEMENT OF GEN DAVID H. PETRAEUS, USA, COMMANDER, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE, AND COMMANDER, U.S. FORCES AFGHANISTAN General Petraeus. Mr. Chairman and Senator McCain, it's a privilege to be here today with Under Secretary Flournoy to report on the situation in Afghanistan. Before I proceed, however, I'd like to offer my sincere condolences to the people of Japan as they work to recover from one of the worst natural disasters in their history. For many years now, Japan has been a stalwart partner in Afghanistan, and an important contributor to the mission there. Now our thoughts and our prayers are with our long-term allies and all those in Japan affected by the earthquake and the tsunami. Chairman Levin. If I could just interrupt you for a minute, in expressing those sentiments you're speaking for every member of this committee and, I believe, every American. Thank you for doing that. General Petraeus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a bottom line upfront, it is ISAF's assessment that the momentum achieved by the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2005 has been arrested in much of the country, and reversed in a number of important areas. However, while the security progress achieved over the past year is significant, it is also fragile and reversible. Moreover, it is clear that much difficult work lies ahead with our Afghan partners to solidify and expand our gains in the face of the expected Taliban spring offensive. Nonetheless, the hard-fought achievements in 2010 and early 2011 have enabled the Joint Afghan-NATO Transition Board to recommend initiation this spring of transition to Afghan lead in several provinces. The achievements of the past year are also very important as I prepare to provide options and a recommendation to President Obama for commencement of the drawdown of the U.S. surge forces in July. Of note, as well, the progress achieved has put us on the right azimuth to accomplish the objective agreed upon at last November's Lisbon Summit, that of Afghan forces in the lead throughout the country by the end of 2014. The achievements of 2010 and early 2011 have been enabled by a determined effort to get the inputs right in Afghanistan. With the strong support of the United States and the 47 other troop-contributing countries, ISAF has focused enormous attention and resources over the past 2 years on building the organizations needed to conduct a comprehensive, civil-military counterinsurgency campaign, on staffing those organizations properly, on developing--in close coordination with our Afghan partners--the requisite concepts and plans, and, above all, on deploying the additional forces, civilians, and funding needed. Indeed, more than 87,000 additional NATO-ISAF troopers and 1,000 additional civilians have been added to the effort in Afghanistan since the beginning of 2009, and Afghanistan's security forces have grown by over 122,000 in that time, as well. Getting the inputs right has enabled our forces, together with Afghan forces, to conduct the comprehensive campaign necessary to achieve our goals in Afghanistan. Our core objective is, of course, ensuring that Afghanistan does not once again become a sanctuary for al Qaeda. Achieving that objective requires that we help Afghanistan develop sufficient capabilities to secure and govern itself, and that effort requires the execution of the comprehensive civil-military effort on which we are now embarked. Over the past year, in particular, ISAF elements, together with our Afghan and international partners, have increased all the activities of our comprehensive campaign substantially. We have, for example, stepped up the tempo of precise intelligence-driven operations to capture or kill insurgent leaders. In a typical 90-day period, in fact, precision operations by U.S. special mission units and their Afghan partners alone kill or capture some 360 targeted insurgent leaders. Moreover, intelligence-driven operations are now coordinated with senior officers of the relevant Afghan ministries, and virtually all include highly trained Afghan soldiers or police, with some Afghan elements now in the lead on these operations. We have also expanded considerably joint ISAF-Afghan operations to clear the Taliban from important, long-held safe havens, and then to hold and build in them. ISAF and Afghan troopers have, for example, cleared such critical areas as the districts west of Kandahar City that were the birthplace of the Taliban movement, as well as important districts of Helmand Province, areas that expand the Kabul security bubble, and select locations in the north where the Taliban expanded its presence in recent years. One result of such operations has been a four-fold increase in recent months in the number of weapons and explosive caches turned in and found. Another has been the gradual development of local governance and economic revival in the growing security bubbles. In fact, Marjah, the one-time hub of the Taliban and the illegal narcotics industry in central Helmand Province, held an election for a community council on March 1 during which 75 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. As a result of improvements in the security situation there, the markets, which once sold weapons, explosives, and illegal narcotics, now feature over 1,500 shops selling food, clothes, and household goods. We have positioned more forces, as well, to interdict the flow of fighters and explosives from insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan, and we will do further work with our Afghan partners to establish as much of a defense in depth as is possible to disrupt infiltration of Taliban and Haqqani Network members. Meanwhile, we are coordinating more closely than ever with the Pakistani army to conduct ISAF operations that will provide the ``anvil'' on the Afghan side of the Durand Line, against which Pakistani Taliban elements can be driven by Pakistani operations in the border areas. With your support, we have also devoted substantial additional resources to the development of the ANSF. This effort is, of course, another very important component of our comprehensive approach. Indeed, it is arguably the most critical element in our effort to help Afghanistan develop the capability to secure itself. We have seen significant progress in this arena over the past year, though we have had to contend with innumerable challenges, and our Afghan partners are the first to note that the quality of some elements is still uneven. The train and equip mission is, in fact, a huge undertaking, and there is nothing easy about it. However, the past year alone has seen ANSF grow by over one third, adding some 70,000 soldiers and police. Notably, those forces have grown in quality, not just in quantity. Investments in leader development, literacy, marksmanship, and institutions have yielded significant dividends. In fact, in the hard fighting west of Kandahar in late 2010, Afghan forces comprised some 60 percent of the overall force, and they fought with skill and courage. President Karzai's ALP initiative has also been an important addition to the overall campaign. It is, in essence, a community watch with AK-47s, under the local District Chief of Police, with members nominated by a representative Shura Council, vetted by the Afghan intelligence service, and trained by and partnered with Afghan Police and U.S. Special Forces elements. This initiative does more than just allow the arming of local forces and the conduct of limited defensive missions. Through the way each unit is established, this program mobilizes communities in self-defense against those who would undermine security in their areas. For that reason, the growth of these elements is of particular concern to the Taliban, whose ability to intimidate the population is limited considerably by it. There are currently 70 districts identified for ALP elements, with each district's authorization averaging some 300 ALP members. Twenty-seven of the district ALP elements have been validated for full operations, while the other 43 are in various stages of being established. This program has emerged as so important that I have put a conventional U.S. infantry battalion under the operational control of our Special Operations Command (SOCOM) in Afghanistan to augment our Special Forces and increase our ability to support the program's expansion. We have increased, as well, our efforts to enable the Afghan Government's work and that of international community civilians to improve governance, economic development, and the provision of basic services. These are essential elements of the effort to shift delivery of basic services from Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) and international organizations to Afghan governmental elements, thereby addressing President Karzai's understandable concerns about parallel institutions. We have provided assistance for new Afghan Government-led initiatives in reintegration, supporting the recently established Afghan High Peace Council and Provincial Peace and Reintegration Councils. Indeed, we recognize that we and our Afghan partners cannot just kill or capture our way out of the insurgency in Afghanistan. Afghan-led reintegration of reconcilable insurgents must also be an important element of the strategy--and it now is. In fact, some 700 former Taliban have now officially reintegrated with Afghan authorities just in recent months, and some 2,000 more are in various stages of the reintegration process. All of these efforts are part of our comprehensive approach, and we have worked hard to coordinate ISAF activities with the international organizations and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan, as well as with our Afghan partners. We have also sought to ensure that we minimize loss of innocent civilian life in the course of our operations, even as we also ensure protection of our forces and our Afghan partners. Of note, a recently released United Nations (U.N.) study observed that civilian casualties due to ISAF and Afghan force operations decreased by just over 20 percent in 2010, even as our total forces increased by over 100,000 and significant offensive operations were launched. Our progress in this area notwithstanding, however, in view of several tragic incidents in recent weeks, I ordered a review of our Tactical Directive on the use of force by all levels of our chain of command and with the air crews of our attack helicopters. I have reemphasized instructions on reducing damage to infrastructure and property to an absolute minimum. Counterinsurgents cannot succeed if they harm the people they are striving to protect. As I noted at the outset, the Joint NATO-Afghan Inteqal, or Transition, Board has recommended to President Karzai and NATO leaders commencement of transition in select provinces in the next few months. President Karzai will announce these locations in a speech on March 22. In keeping with the principles adopted by the North Atlantic Council to guide transition, the shifting of responsibility from ISAF to Afghan forces will be conducted at a pace determined by conditions on the ground, with assessments provided from the bottom up so that those at operational command level in Afghanistan can plan the resulting battlefield geometry adjustments with our Afghan partners. According to the NATO principles, transition will see our forces thinning out, not just handing off, with reinvestment of some of the forces freed up by transition in contiguous areas, or in training missions where more work is needed. Similar processes are also taking place as we commence transition of certain training and institutional functions from ISAF trainers to their Afghan counterparts. As we embark on the process of transition, we should keep in mind the imperative of ensuring that the transition actions we take will be irreversible. As the ambassadors of several ISAF countries emphasized at one recent NATO meeting, we'll get one shot at transition, and we need to get it right. As a number of ISAF national leaders have noted in recent months, especially since the Lisbon Summit, we need to focus not just on the year ahead, but increasingly on the goal agreed at Lisbon of having Afghan forces in the lead throughout Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Indeed, we need to ensure that we take a sufficiently long view, to ensure that our actions in the months ahead enable long-term achievement in the years ahead. We have refined our campaign plan to do just that--and we are also now beginning to look beyond 2014, as Under Secretary Flournoy noted, as the United States and Afghanistan--and NATO and Afghanistan--discuss possible strategic partnerships. All of this is enormously reassuring to our Afghan partners, and of considerable concern to the Taliban. With respect to the Taliban, appreciation that there will be an enduring commitment of some form by the international community to Afghanistan is important to the insurgents' recognition that reconciliation, rather than continued fighting, should be their goal. Before concluding, there are four additional issues I would like to highlight to the committee. First, I am concerned that levels of funding for our State Department and USAID partners will not sufficiently enable them to build on the hard-fought security achievements of our men and women in uniform. Inadequate resourcing of our civilian partners could, in fact, jeopardize accomplishment of the overall mission. I offer that assessment, noting that we have just completed a joint civil- military campaign plan between U.S. Forces Afghanistan and the U.S. Embassy Kabul which emphasizes the critical integration of civilian and military efforts in an endeavor such as that in Afghanistan. Second, I want to express my deep appreciation for your support of vital additional capabilities for our troopers. The funding you have provided has, for example, enabled the rapid deployment of a substantial increase in the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets supporting our forces. To take one example, we have increased the number of various types of persistent surveillance systems--essentially blimps and towers with optics--from 114 this past August to 184 at the present, with plans for continued increases throughout this year. Your support has also enabled the rapid procurement and deployment of the all-terrain vehicle version of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles, with 6,700 fielded since I took command some 8\\1/2\\ months ago. Your support has continued to provide our commanders with another critical element of our strategy, the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) funding that has once again proven absolutely invaluable as a way of capitalizing rapidly on hard- won gains on the ground. Indeed, CERP funding, the establishment of the Afghan Infrastructure Fund, and the specific authorization for the reintegration program have been instrumental in enabling key components of our overall effort. Third, I should at this point also highlight the critical work of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. These institutions are the largest donors to Afghanistan after the United States, and they have been critical to the success of important projects, such as the Ring Road and the Uzbek-Afghan railroad. We need these critical enabling institutions, and further U.S. support for them will ensure that they are able to continue to contribute as significantly as they have in the past. Fourth, I also want to thank you for the substantial funding for the development of the ANSF. The continued growth of Afghan forces in quantity, quality, and capability is, needless to say, essential to the process of transition of security tasks from ISAF forces to Afghan forces. The resources you have provided for this component of our effort have been the critical enabler of it. In closing, the past 8 months have seen important, but hard-fought, progress in Afghanistan. Key insurgent safe havens have been taken away from the Taliban. Numerous insurgent leaders have been killed or captured. Hundreds of reconcilable mid-level leaders and fighters have been reintegrated into Afghan society. Meanwhile, Afghan forces have grown in number and capability. Local security solutions have been instituted. Security improvements in key areas like Kabul, Kandahar, and Helmand Provinces have, in turn, enabled progress in the areas of governance and development. None of this has been easy. The progress achieved has entailed hard fighting and considerable sacrifice. There have been tough losses along the way. There have been setbacks as well as successes. Indeed, the experience has been akin to that of a roller coaster ride. The trajectory has generally been upward since last summer, but there certainly have been significant bumps and difficult reverses at various points. Nonetheless, although the insurgents are already striving to regain lost momentum and lost safe havens as we enter the spring fighting season, we believe that we will be able to build on the momentum achieved in 2010, though that clearly will entail additional tough fighting. As many of you have noted in the past, our objectives in Afghanistan and in the region are of vital importance, and we must do all that we can to achieve those objectives. Those of us on the ground believe that the strategy on which we are now embarked provides the best approach for doing just that, noting, as dialogue with President Karzai has reminded us at various junctures, that we must constantly refine our activities in response to changes in the circumstances on the ground. Needless to say, we will continue to make such adjustments in close consultation with our Afghan and international counterparts as the situation evolves. Finally, I want to thank each of you for your continued support for our country's men and women in Afghanistan and their families. As I have noted to you before, nothing means more to them than knowing that what they're doing is important, and knowing that their sacrifices are appreciated by their leaders and their fellow citizens back home. Each of you has sought to convey that sense to them, and we are grateful to you for doing so. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of General Petraeus follows:] Prepared Statement by GEN David H. Petraeus, USA Mr. Chairman, Senator McCain, it's a privilege to be here today with Under Secretary Flournoy to report on the situation in Afghanistan. However, before I proceed, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the people of Japan as they recover from one of the worst natural disasters in their history. For many years now, Japan has been a stalwart partner in Afghanistan and has made many vital contributions to the mission. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the earthquake and the tsunami. bottom line upfront As a bottom line upfront, it is the International Security Assistance Force's (ISAF) assessment that the momentum achieved by the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2005 has been arrested in much of the country and reversed in a number of important areas. However, while the security progress achieved over the past year is significant, it is also fragile and reversible. Moreover, it is clear that much difficult work lies ahead with our Afghan partners to solidify and expand our gains in the face of the expected Taliban spring offensive. Nonetheless, the hard-fought achievements in 2010 and early 2011 have enabled the Joint Afghan-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Transition Board to recommend initiation this spring of transition to Afghan lead in several provinces. The achievements of the past year are also very important as I prepare to provide options and a recommendation to President Obama for commencement of the drawdown of the U.S. surge forces in July. Of note, as well, the progress achieved has put us on the right azimuth to accomplish the objective agreed upon at last November's Lisbon Summit, that of Afghan forces in the lead throughout the country by the end of 2014. getting the inputs right The achievements of 2010 and early 2011 have been enabled by a determined effort to get the inputs right in Afghanistan. With the strong support of the United States and the 47 other troop-contributing countries, ISAF has focused enormous attention and resources over the past 2 years on building the organizations needed to conduct a comprehensive, civil-military counterinsurgency campaign, on staffing those organizations properly, on developing--in close coordination with our Afghan partners--the requisite concepts and plans, and, above all, on deploying the additional forces, civilians, and funding needed. Indeed, more than 87,000 additional ISAF troopers and 1,000 additional civilians have been added to the effort in Afghanistan since the beginning of 2009. Afghanistan's Security Forces have grown by over 122,000 in that time, as well. the comprehensive approach Getting the inputs right has enabled our forces, together with Afghan forces, to conduct the comprehensive campaign necessary to achieve our goals in Afghanistan. Our core objective is, of course, ensuring that Afghanistan does not once again become a sanctuary for al Qaeda. Achieving that objective requires that we help Afghanistan develop sufficient capabilities to secure and govern itself. That effort requires the execution of the comprehensive civil-military effort on which we are now embarked. Over the past year, in particular, ISAF elements, together with our Afghan and international partners, have increased all the activities of our comprehensive campaign substantially. We have, for example, stepped up the tempo of precise, intelligence-driven operations to capture or kill insurgent leaders. In a typical 90-day period, in fact, precision operations by U.S. special mission units and their Afghan partners alone kill or capture some 360 targeted insurgent leaders. Moreover, intelligence-driven operations are now coordinated with senior officers of the relevant Afghan ministries and virtually all include highly- trained Afghan soldiers or police, with some Afghan elements now in the lead on these operations. With your support, we have also expanded considerably joint ISAF- Afghan operations to clear the Taliban from important, long-held safe havens and then to hold and build in them. ISAF and Afghan troopers have, for example, cleared such critical areas as the districts west of Kandahar City that were the birthplace of the Taliban movement, as well as important districts of Helmand Province, areas that expand the Kabul security bubble, and select locations in the north where the Taliban expanded its presence in recent years. One result of such operations has been a four-fold increase in recent months in the number of weapons and explosives caches turned in and found. Another has been the gradual development of local governance and economic revival in the growing security bubbles. In fact, Marjah, the one-time hub of the Taliban and the illegal narcotics industry in central Helmand Province, held an election for a community council on March 1 during which 75 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. As a result of improvements in the security situation there, the markets, which once sold weapons, explosives, and illegal narcotics, now feature over 1,500 shops selling food, clothes, and household goods. We have positioned more forces, as well, to interdict the flow of fighters and explosives from insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan. We will do further work with our Afghan partners to establish as much of a defense in depth as is possible to disrupt infiltration of Taliban and Haqqani Network members. Meanwhile, we are coordinating closely with the Pakistani Army to conduct ISAF operations that will provide the ``anvil'' on the Afghan side of the Durand Line against which Pakistani Taliban elements can be driven by Pakistani operations in the border areas. afghan national security force development With your support, we have also devoted substantial additional resources to the development of Afghanistan's security forces. This effort is, of course, another important component of our comprehensive approach; indeed, it is arguably the most critical element in our effort to help Afghanistan develop the capability to secure itself. We have seen significant progress in this arena over the past year, though we have had to contend with innumerable challenges and our Afghan partners are the first to note that the quality of some elements is still uneven. The train and equip mission is, in fact, a huge undertaking, and there is nothing easy about it; however, the past year alone has seen Afghan forces grow by over one-third, adding some 70,000 soldiers and police. Those forces have grown in quality, not just in quantity. Investments in leader development, literacy, and institutions have yielded significant dividends. In fact, in the hard fighting west of Kandahar in late 2010, Afghan forces comprised some 60 percent of the overall force, and they fought with skill and courage. the afghan local police initiative President Karzai's Afghan Local Police (ALP) initiative has also been an important addition to the overall campaign. It is, in essence, a community watch with AK-47s, under the local District Chief of Police, with members nominated by a representative Shura Council, vetted by the Afghan intel service, and trained by and partnered with Afghan Police and U.S. Special Forces elements. The initiative does more than just allow the arming of local forces and the conduct of limited defensive missions; through the way each unit is established, this program mobilizes communities in self-defense against those who would undermine security in their areas. For that reason, the growth of these elements is of particular concern to the Taliban, whose ability to intimidate the population is limited considerably by it. There are currently 70 districts identified for ALP elements, with each district's authorization averaging 300 ALP members. Twenty-seven of the district ALP elements have been validated for full operations, while the other 43 are in various stages of being established. This program has emerged as so important that I have put a conventional U.S. infantry battalion under the operational control of our Special Operations Command in Afghanistan to increase our ability to support the program's expansion. We have increased as well our efforts to enable the Afghan Government's work and that of international community civilians to improve governance, economic development, and the provision of basic services. They are essential elements of the effort to shift delivery of basic services from PRTs and international organizations to Afghan Government elements, thereby addressing President Karzai's understandable concerns about ``parallel institutions.'' We have provided assistance for new Afghan Government-led initiatives in reintegration, supporting the recently established Afghan High Peace Council and Provincial Peace and Reintegration Councils. Indeed, we recognize that we and our Afghan partners cannot just kill or capture our way out of the insurgency in Afghanistan; Afghan-led reintegration of reconcilable insurgents must also be an important element of the strategy--and it now is. In fact, some 700 former Taliban have now officially reintegrated with Afghan authorities and some 2,000 more are in various stages of the reintegration process. All of these efforts are part of our comprehensive approach. We have worked hard to coordinate ISAF activities with the international organizations and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan, as well as with our Afghan partners. We have also sought to ensure that we minimize loss of innocent civilian life in the course of our operations, even as we also ensure protection of our forces and our Afghan partners. Of note, a recently released United Nations study observed that civilian casualties due to ISAF and Afghan force operations decreased by just over 20 percent in 2010, even as our total forces increased by over 100,000 and significant offensive operations were launched. Our progress in this area notwithstanding, however, in view of several tragic incidents in recent weeks, I ordered a review of our Tactical Directive on the use of force by all levels of our chain of command and with the air crews of our attack helicopters. I have also issued instructions on reducing damage to infrastructure and property to an absolute minimum. Counterinsurgents cannot succeed if they harm the people they are striving to protect. transition As I noted at the outset, the Joint NATO-Afghan Transition Board has recommended to President Karzai and NATO leaders commencement of transition in select provinces in the next few months. President Karzai will announce these locations in his Nowruz speech on March 21st. In keeping with the principles adopted by the North Atlantic Council to guide transition, the shifting of responsibility from ISAF to Afghan forces will be conducted at a pace determined by conditions on the ground with assessments provided from the bottom up so that those at operational command level in Afghanistan can plan the resulting ``battlefield geometry'' adjustments with our Afghan partners. According to the NATO principles, transition will see our forces thinning out, not just handing off, with reinvestment of some of the forces freed up by transition in contiguous areas or in training missions where more work is needed. Similar processes are also taking place as we commence transition of certain training and institutional functions from ISAF trainers to their Afghan counterparts. As we embark on the process of transition, we should keep in mind the imperative of ensuring that the transition actions we take will be irreversible. As the ambassadors of several ISAF countries emphasized at one recent NATO meeting, we'll get one shot at transition, and we need to get it right. 2014 As a number of ISAF national leaders have noted in recent months, we need to focus not just on the year ahead, but increasingly on the goal agreed at Lisbon of having Afghan forces in the lead throughout Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Indeed, we need to ensure that we take a sufficiently long view to ensure that our actions in the months ahead enable long-term achievement in the years ahead. We have refined our campaign plan to do just that--and we are also now beginning to look beyond 2014, as well, as the United States and Afghanistan--and NATO and Afghanistan--discuss possible strategic partnerships. All of this is enormously reassuring to our Afghan partners--and of considerable concern to the Taliban. With respect to the Taliban, appreciation that there will be an enduring commitment of some form by the international community to Afghanistan is important to the insurgents' recognition that reconciliation, rather than continued fighting, should be their goal. additional issues Before concluding, there are four additional issues I would like to highlight. First, I am concerned that levels of funding for our State Department and USAID partners will not sufficiently enable them to build on the hard-fought security achievements of our men and women in uniform. Inadequate resourcing of our civilian partners could, in fact, jeopardize accomplishment of the overall mission. I offer that assessment, noting that we have just completed a joint civil-military campaign plan between U.S. Forces Afghanistan and the U.S. Embassy which emphasizes the critical integration of civilian and military efforts in an endeavor such as that in Afghanistan. Second, I want to express my deep appreciation for your support of vital additional capabilities for our troopers. The funding you have provided has, for example, enabled the rapid deployment of a substantial increase in the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets supporting our forces. To take one example, we have increased the number of various types of persistent surveillance systems--essentially blimps and towers with optics--from 114 this past August to 184 at the present, with plans for continued increases throughout this year. Your support has also enabled the rapid procurement and deployment of the all terrain vehicle version of the mine resistant ambush protected family of vehicles, with 6,700 fielded since I took command. Your support has continued to provide our commanders with another critical element of our strategy, the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) funding that has once again proven absolutely invaluable as a way of capitalizing rapidly on hard-won gains on the ground. Indeed, CERP funding, the establishment of the Afghan Infrastructure Fund, and the specific authorization for the reintegration program have been instrumental in enabling key components of our overall effort. Third, I should at this point also highlight the critical work of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. These institutions are the largest donors to Afghanistan after the United States, and they have been critical to the success of such projects as the Ring Road and the Uzbek-Afghan railroad. We need these critical enabling institutions, and further U.S. support for them will ensure that they are able to continue to contribute as significantly as they have in the past. Fourth, I also want to thank you for the substantial funding for the development of the Afghan National Security Forces. The continued growth of Afghan forces in quantity, quality, and capability is, needless to say, essential to the process of transition of security tasks from ISAF forces to Afghan forces. The resources you have provided for this component of our effort have been the critical enabler of it. conclusion In closing, the past 8 months have seen important, but hard-fought, progress in Afghanistan.

As I have noted to you before, nothing means more to them than knowing that what they're doing is important and knowing that their sacrifices are appreciated by their leaders and their fellow citizens back home. Each of you has sought to convey that sense to them, and we are grateful to you for doing so. Thank you very much. Chairman Levin. Thank you very much, General. Thank you both for your testimony. [Audience disturbance interrupts proceeding.] Please leave if you're going to make any comments in public like that. Just please leave. General, let me start by asking you about the July 2011 date, which you've made reference to in your statement as a date about which you're going to recommend to President Obama the commencement of the drawdown of some of our forces. Have you decided on the level of the reductions that you're going to be recommending yet? General Petraeus. I have not, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Levin. Do you continue to support the beginning of reductions of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in July? General Petraeus. I do, Mr. Chairman, and I will provide options to the chain of command and the President to do that. Chairman Levin. Why do you support the beginning of reductions this July? General Petraeus. If I could come back, perhaps, to your opening statement, Mr. Chairman, I think it is logical to talk both about getting the job done, as Secretary Gates did with his NATO counterparts, and to begin transition and responsible, to use President Obama's term, reductions in forces at a pace determined by conditions on the ground. As my good friend and shipmate, General Jim Mattis, noted, it undercuts the narrative of the Taliban that we will be there forever, that we will maintain a presence. It does, indeed, as I have told this committee before, send that message of urgency that President Obama sought to transmit on the 1st of December at West Point, 2009, when he also transmitted a message of enormous additional commitment in the form of 30,000 additional U.S. forces, more funding for Afghan forces, and additional civilians. Chairman Levin. Thank you. Now, relative to the pending request to increase the size of ANSF by up to an additional 70,000 personnel, I believe that you have made that request, is that correct? General Petraeus. I have, Mr. Chairman. My understanding is that the Secretary of Defense has forwarded that. This was made in consultation, needless to say, with the Ministers of Interior and Defense in Afghanistan, who also gained President Karzai's support for it. Keeping in mind that it recommends a floor of 352,000, and then, if there are certain reforms carried through, which are all very much in train by our ministry counterparts in Afghanistan in terms of additional commitment to leader development, recruiting, retention, and attrition issues, that the growth would be to 378,000 total. Chairman Levin. That floor of 352,000 is approximately 45,000 more than the goal for October 2011, as I understand it. General Petraeus. That's correct, Mr. Chairman. The Afghan forces are on track, it appears, to reach that goal probably even early, as was the case this past year. Chairman Levin. Secretary Flournoy, are you recommending that increase? Ms. Flournoy. The Secretary has forwarded the increase over to the White House for the President's consideration. We do expect a decision on that soon. Chairman Levin. Are you able to say that you support it, or the Secretary supports it? Ms. Flournoy. Yes, I think the secretary does support the range that General Petraeus suggested, between 352,000 and 378,000. Chairman Levin. You both have made reference to Pakistan and the safe havens which exist there, with the Pakistan Government basically looking the other way in two key areas, and that's North Waziristan and down in Quetta, where they know where those people are who are crossing the border and terrorizing Afghan citizens, attacking us"
