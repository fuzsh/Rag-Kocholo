According to TikTok, advertisers working with agencies honored with this title, which excel in close collaboration between media and creative teams, benefit from streamlined operational efficiency.\n\nSalestube earned the badge partly due to the One Social collaboration model developed a few years ago. Within Group One, this model integrates Salestube’s paid social area with social content managed by Labcon, an agency within the marketing and technology group responsible for creating creative content for brands on social media platforms.\n\nGroup One was the first to join the Ad Net Zero Poland program\n\nThe General Assembly of SAR adopted a resolution for its members to implement the global Ad Net Zero program, which is the advertising industry’s response to the climate crisis. Group One was the first in Poland to join the initiative by signing the agreement for companies and agencies supporting Ad Net Zero Poland.\n\nThe Ad Net Zero program includes educational activities, knowledge sharing, and tools aimed at measuring and reducing the carbon footprint of advertising through a five-point action plan: reducing emissions from the agency’s own operations, reducing emissions in advertising production (TV), reducing emissions in media planning and buying, reducing emissions in events and competitions, and harnessing the power of advertising to promote sustainable choices and behaviors.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the resolution by the SAR assembly to implement the global Ad Net Zero program, the Polish independent marketing and technology group Group One joined the initiative. This commitment entails setting a science-based emission reduction target within 12 months of signing the agreement, measuring progress towards that goal, and reporting on progress to the Marketing Communication Association SAR annually. Group One will also implement the five-point Ad Net Zero action plan in relevant areas of its operations and support it for the following 12 months, as well as share the plan with employees to ensure clear and shared understanding of the actions. This agreement will apply to all SAR members who endorse the adopted resolution.\n\nAll agencies that join the Ad Net Zero program will receive assistance in developing a path to reduce emissions, access to knowledge, research and measurement tools, participation in Ad Net Zero events and Showcase Sessions, and up-to-date information on environmental legislation and regulations.\n\nInternational Success of GONG and Game Changer at MIXX Awards Europe 2024\n\nDuring the MIXX Awards Europe gala, awards were presented for the best digital marketing campaigns in Europe, combining creative ideas with effective solutions.

It’s time to make a place for them in the world of advertising!\n\nThe media and advertising industry often presents an idealized view of the world in which people with disabilities are ignored. They continue to struggle not only with a lack of access to information, products, culture, entertainment, and services but also with a lack of representation in the mainstream. However, this is about to change! The UNMUTE Agency was created, in part, to help individuals with disabilities discover and showcase their talents. In less than a month since its launch, the agency conducted its first casting, giving representatives of these communities the opportunity to break into the advertising industry as actors, models, or extras. Talent recruitment for the agency is still ongoing and is also open to photographers, cinematographers, directors, designers, and other creative industry professionals.\n\nThe representation of people with disabilities in the media is disproportionate to their representation in society. It’s time for changes, and this is brought to life through a joint business venture between the Polish Association of the Deaf and the marketing-technological group Group One — the UNMUTE agency. Its goal and scope of activity are effective combatting of all forms of exclusion by engaging individuals with disabilities in cooperation with companies and brands, particularly in the field of advertising.\n\nIn the first month of the agency’s existence, in October, the UNMUTE Talents casting and a photoshoot were carried out, which allowed the first talents to join the base of actors and models with disabilities. The UNMUTE team aims to engage them in cooperation with companies and brands, especially in advertising. This is the first initiative of its kind in the marketing communications market that combines business and NGOs. It aims to increase the visibility of people with disabilities in the media, including promotional materials, video commercials, and advertising creations of commercial entities.

In 2022, the company’s net carbon emissions amounted to 91,768 tons of CO2e. The report was prepared with the assistance of Footprint Intelligence and was independently verified by KPMG.\n\nTransparent and open approach to measuring and reporting CO2e emissions is a cornerstone of the sustainable development strategy of the marketing and technology group, Group One. For the second time, Group One has published data on its carbon footprint in the “Group One Carbon Footprint Report 2022.” This report will guide the setting of decarbonization targets for the coming years, aligning with the latest climate science and recommended by the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nGroup One’s carbon footprint for 2022 was calculated across all three scopes: scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3. Scope 1 includes emissions directly generated by the company, scope 2 covers emissions from purchased energy used by the company, and scope 3 encompasses other emissions in the company’s value chain. The company’s net emissions, accounting for all scopes, amounted to 91,768 tons of CO2e. Group One continues to be the only company in the marketing communication industry that quantifies and reports its carbon footprint comprehensively.\n\nPurchasing and consuming media represent the largest source of emissions across the entire industry.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions within organizations can be divided into three scopes. Scope 1 includes gases directly produced from fuel combustion in stationary and mobile sources controlled by the company, including the company’s fleet, leased vehicles used by employees, gas heating, and oil heating. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from energy purchased from external sources to Group One, including thermal, cooling, electrical, and technological steam energy. Scope 3 encompasses various activities such as media purchases for client campaigns and their viewership, clicks, and views, professional services, investment goods, leases, business travel, employee commuting, remote work, and waste generation. Scope 3 represents the largest source of emissions for the company, accounting for 99.75% of Group One’s total carbon footprint generated last year – 91,541 tons of CO2e.\n\nTo fully account for Scope 3 emissions, the marketing and technology group – Group One for the first time applied an innovative method to calculate emissions from the “consumption” of advertisements in offline and online media. For digital ads, the number of views and time spent by users on Google and Meta platforms (specific to country and device) was calculated to determine the carbon footprint generated. The same mechanism was applied to offline media, where the audience for TV ads and the time viewers spent watching Group One’s commercials on television were measured. These calculations were performed according to the GHG Protocol methodology, with the support of Footprint Intelligence, a company specializing in carbon footprint management solutions for enterprises. Additionally, KPMG was engaged as an independent verifier for the first time to ensure the robust verification of the methodology, data, and confirmation of the carbon footprint result included in the report.\n\nThe Polish Association of the Deaf and Group One Launch UNMUTE Agency\n\nThe Polish Association of the Deaf and the marketing-technology group, Group One, are launching a joint venture business with the aim of assisting companies, brands, and communities of people with disabilities in effectively combating all forms of exclusion.

Among the winners, who received the “Marketing Oscars” in the 6 categories of the survey, were: InPost, Winiary, Castorama, Lidl (Bio Organic), JBL and Samsung.\n\nBest Brands is the first fully independent ranking whose unique methodology is based on two main indicators: Share of Soul – the brand’s relationship and connection with the consumer, and Share of Wallet – which relates to the brand’s actual market data. Using the methodology in the research, based on the ranking, makes visible how brands perform in the market on many levels, as well as depicting the individual preferences and experiences of consumers when interacting with brands. The consumers in the Best Brands ranking are its ‘jury’. In the 2nd edition of the survey in Poland, 7,500 respondents answered questions that covered as many as 50 product categories and around 400 brands.\n\nAt GfK, we track the shopping choices of Poles and, on this based, we highlight key consumer trends.

All of these trends are reflected in the Best Brands 2023 competition categories. We have rewarded strong brands that offer consumers innovative solutions and care for sustainable development – says Barbara Lewicka, Senior Director GfK in Poland – The last several months have not spared Polish consumers in financial terms. GfK’s main consumer mood indicator is still in double-digit minus. This means that buyers are looking to the future with great caution and do not expect the economic situation to improve. Under such circumstances, finding the golden mean and responding to current consumer needs is quite a challenge. The brands ranked in the Best Brands ranking have managed this challenge perfectly. – adds.\n\nLaureates of the 2nd edition of Best Brands Poland\n\nIn this year’s Best Brands Poland ranking, the winners who received the “Marketing Oscars” were selected in 6 categories: Best Overall Brand, Best Polish Brand, Best Omnichannel Brand, Best Sustainable Brand, Best Life Changing Technology Brand and Best Brand For Tough Times. The categories included in the ranking are unique to every edition and represent, with the most objective manner, the trends that currently exist on the market and in the interests of consumers in Poland.\n\nThe Best Overall Brand is a unique award, because it is given for overall performance. In this category, the award is given to brands with a strong market position, which at the same time are able to build a lasting relationship with consumers, care about their positive experience, enjoy loyalty and recognition among buyers. This year’s award is unique in even more important aspects, as in the 2nd edition of Best Brands Poland, two Best Brand Overall titles were awarded. “Marketing Oscars” in this category were received by brands that achieved almost identical results in the survey, although they operate in such different business environments on a daily basis. The winners of the Best Overall Brand category were JBL and Samsung.

The biggest risk they have faced and continue to stand for, is not a single bad decision, but not making any at all. Being courageous, flexible, understanding consumer moods, following the voice of customers and trends.

The initiator of the report and The Best Brands Awards in our country is the largest independent marketing and technology group in Poland, Group One.\n\nThe brands nominated for the Best Brands Awards 2023 are, similarly to last year, selected on the basis of a unique survey methodology carried out by GfK Polonia.

The second is the “Share of Soul” indicator, and it shows which companies have won customers’ hearts, recognition and trust.\n\n“The survey, which we accomplished in Poland, included 50 product categories, about 400 brands and 7,500 respondents, who were required to rate two product categories in online interviews. To evaluate the brand, we used elements of GfK’s new Brand Architect solution, the main idea is that a brand must sell itself. Therefore, the strength of the brand was measured, among other things, by an indicator highly correlated with price. The competition, like a year ago, was extremely even, which testifies to the very high level and competitiveness of our market. In the race for the favor of the consumer, the smaller and smaller details are decisive, and companies that want to be one step ahead of others must at all time keep up to date with the latest trends and the needs of buyers.” – Underlines Barbara Lewicka, Senior Director at GfK.\n\n60 brands are up for Best Brands Poland 2023 title\n\nThe 60 brands nominated for Best Brand, were selected in 6 categories.

This year we couldn’t miss the opportunity to ask consumers about the impact of the past few months influence their lives and shopping habits, as well as which brands they think have responded to it best. At the same time, we adhered to the principle that we would not inflating the number of categories, we had to give up something. We replaced the category that speaks directly about “customer-centricity” with two new ones, which we believe better reflect the spirit of the times, and are a testimony to putting the customer at the center of their focus.” says Marek Żolędziowski, CEO of Group One.\n\nThe winning brands of the six categories of the Best Brands Poland 2023 ranking, will be awarded the “Oscars of Marketing,” during the final Gala of the Best Brands Awards 2023, which will take place on May 18, 2023 at The Ujazdowski Castle\n\nThe initiator and organizer of the second Best Brands ranking in Poland is Group One – the largest independent marketing and technology group in Poland.

W każdej z sześciu kategorii zostało wyłonione TOP 10 firm, które powalczą o tytuł Best Overall Brand, Best Polish Brand, Best Omnichannel Brand, Best Sustainability Brand, Best Life Changing Technology Brand oraz Best Brand For Tough Times. Zwycięzców poznamy podczas uroczystej finałowej Gali Best Brands Awards 2023, która odbędzie się 18 maja w Zamku Ujazdowskim.\n\nBest Brands to niezależna, międzynarodowa nagroda w obszarze marketingu, przyznawana na podstawie kompleksowego badania przeprowadzonego przez GfK, globalnego lidera w dziedzinie analityki danych. Ranking, zainicjowany został 20 lat temu w Monachium przez Serviceplan Group. Po ubiegłorocznym sukcesie pierwszej polskiej edycji “Oskary Marketingu” zostaną przyznane w Polsce po raz drugi. Celem rankingu jest uhonorowania najsilniejszych marek na rodzimym rynku oraz tych, którzy stoją za ich sukcesem. Inicjatorem raportu i nagrody Best Brands w naszym kraju jest największa niezależna grupa marketingowo-technologiczna w Polsce, Group One.\n\nDo nagród Best Brands Awards 2023 nominowane są marki, które analogicznie jak w roku ubiegłym, zostały wyłonione na podstawie unikalnej metodologii badania zrealizowanego przez GfK Polonia. Mierzy ona siłę marki, wykorzystując dwa kluczowe wskaźniki. Pierwszy, “Share of Wallet”, określa on faktyczny sukces rynkowy, jaki odniosły marki na rynku polskim. Drugim jest wskaźnik „Share of Soul” i pokazuje on, które z firm zyskały serca klientów, ich uznanie i zaufanie.\n\nBadanie, które zrealizowaliśmy w Polsce, obejmowało aż 50 kategorii produktowych, około 400 marek oraz 7,5 tys. respondentów, którzy w wywiadach online mieli za zadanie ocenić dwie kategorie produktowe. Do oceny marki wykorzystaliśmy elementy nowego rozwiązania GfK – Brand Architect, którego główną ideą jest założenie, że marka musi się sprzedawać. Dlatego siła marki mierzona była m.in. o wskaźnik wysoko skorelowany z ceną. Rywalizacja, podobnie jak przed rokiem, była niezwykle wyrównana, co świadczy o bardzo wysokim poziomie i konkurencyjności naszego rynku. W wyścigu o względy konsumenta decydują coraz mniejsze detale, a firmy, które chcą być o krok przed innymi, muszą przez cały czas być na bieżąco z najnowszymi trendami i potrzebami nabywców” — podkreśla Barbara Lewicka, Senior Director w GfK.\n\n60 marek pretenduje do tytułu Best Brands Poland 2023\n\n60 nominowanych do tytułu Best Brand marek, wyłonionych zostało w 6 kategoriach. Co ważne kategorie te różnią się względem ubiegłorocznego rankingu. Wśród tegorocznych znalazły się cztery znane z pierwszej edycji Best Brands Poland: Best Overall Brand (główna nagroda, a jednocześnie stały element wszystkich edycji we wszystkich krajach), Best Polish Brand, Best Omnichannel Brand, Best Sustainable Brand oraz dwie nowe: Best Life Changing Technology Brand i Best Brand For Tough Times.\n\nAmbicją konkursu Best Brands jest m.in. to, żeby każda edycja jak"
