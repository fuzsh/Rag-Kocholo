        "text": "Chapter Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate a largely ignored topic: the early legitimist movements in Austria and the obstacles to their cause. Legitimists, unlike monarchists (who merely wished for a crowned head of state), specifically wished for a return of the Habsburg-Lorraine hereditary dynasty – thus Karl until his demise in 1922, and thereafter his eldest son Otto, born in 1912. Though some legitimists desired this outcome for the sake of stability, continuity or legality, or out of loyalty to the former Imperial and Royal House, many believed that the Habsburgs were invested with a religious (that is to say, Catholic) mission and thus ruled by the grace of God. Additionally, the modalities of a reinstatement of the dynasty varied between support for a restoration within the boundaries of the new Austria or within the borders of the former empire (or of a similar Danubian realm), thus voiding the post-war peace treaties and the sovereignty of the successor states. As unrealistic as its aims now appear, and despite its aforementioned limitations, the legitimist movement remained a thorn in the side of the fragile First Republic and a constant worry for its neighbours. Moreover, the legitimists’ early persistence and uninterrupted survival enabled them eventually to achieve small victories (though predictably not their main goal) and to play a not inconsiderable role after the collapse of the parliamentary republic. For these reasons, the first Austrian legitimists and the reasons for their failures (and survival) warrant greater academic investigation. For reasons of space, this piece will concentrate only on Austria and on the early years of the republic, and will focus chiefly on the domestic situation without, however, ignoring the closely intertwined international context. Book Abstract: This book presents a multi-layered analysis of the situation in Central Europe after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The new geopolitics emerging from the Versailles order, and at the same time ongoing fights for borders, considerable war damage, social and economic problems and replacement of administrative staff as well as leaders, all contributed to the fact that unlike Western Europe, Central Europe faced challenges and dilemmas on an unprecedented scale. The editors of this book have invited authors from over a dozen academic institutions to answer the question of to what extent the solutions applied in the Habsburg Monarchy were still practiced in the newly created nation states, and to what extent these new political organisms went their own ways. It offers a closer look at Central Europe with its multiple problems typical of that region after 1918 (organizing the post-imperial space, a new political discourse and attempts to create new national memories, the role of national minorities, solving social problems, and verbal and physical violence expressed in public space). Particular chapters concern post-1918 Central Europe on the local, state and international levels, providing a comprehensive view of this sub-region between 1918 and 1923. Table of Contents: 1.

Stefan Surzycki’s Activities for Polish Agriculture in the Revived Polish State Andrzej Synowiec\n\nThe scope of this paper is to analyze the development of nationalism in the Habsburg Empire – a topic that this paper believes has been ignored or been biased towards the Habsburgs. This is achieved by first analyzing the concept of ‘the nation,’ after which this paper will look into the roots of nationhood which, this paper argues, is flawed by the Western-Centered view on Modernity and Universalism, the conclusion being that neither are universal, modernity thus giving the impression of universalism but, at least during the nineteenth century, there were more worlds, such as the ideologically French led Western Europe, in comparison with the ‘universalistic’ Mitteleuropa (or Central Europe). Because the scope of this paper is to analyze nationalism specifically in the Habsburg Empire, this paper will also look into what exactly the Austrian Empire was, arguing that it differed from the regular understanding of an Empire that has, during the nineteenth century, become synonymous with colonialism and oppression. The last part of this paper will evaluate the emergence of ‘nationalism’ during the 1848 revolutions, arguing that it was more a matter of class rights than a matter of nationalism, the ideology being just a justification for more ‘aristocratic’ privileges. Thus, the reason why Central Europe, after the Treaty of Versailles, was divided between nation-states wasn’t because nationalism necessarily triumphed, rather the Treaty was a manifestation of Western Universalism being imposed upon Central Europe which ultimately led to the region suffering from a ‘crisis of identity’ that could potentially explain the instability of Central Europe."
