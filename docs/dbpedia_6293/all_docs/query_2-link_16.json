        "text": "The Polish Olympic Committee was represented by its president, Radosław Piesiewicz.\n\n“The Polish Olympic Committee has found a great sponsor, which is Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa. This is a sponsor that aims to promote and educate the youngest. We already have the first events organized for young adepts of sports who live in orphanages. It's a great joy for us that these kids will be able to come to the Polish Olympic Committee, train and educate themselves. We want these children to spend their time actively. Obviously, Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa will also support Polish sports associations and the Polish Olympic Committee. This cooperation will take place on many levels. It has a unique dimension for us as it is aimed at the youngest, those who have the hardest possible start, namely children from orphanages. We will do everything to make these kids feel very comfortable here, to make them feel like in their own dream home. I hope that our cooperation will be an example for others to give a chance to the youngest ones,\" said Radosław Piesiewicz, president of the Polish Olympic Committee.\n\nThe sponsorship agreement will focus on cooperation in the area of PKOl’s Olympic education and support of Polish sports associations.\n\n“For almost 30 years we have been supporting Polish sports, financing them and cheering on our athletes. JSW is a sponsor of Polish volleyball, with which we achieve the greatest successes. We are proud to join the Olympic family and, as a sponsor, we will also support our Olympic athletes in their quest to perform at their best and provide excitement for all of us. We are also pleased that, thanks to our cooperation with the PKOl, we can further promote Olympic values among children and young people. Competition in the spirit of fair play, the pursuit of excellence and the ideas of mutual respect and friendship are values that are particularly important in our industry. By supporting Polish athletes, we build national pride and encourage young people to practice sports and a healthy lifestyle,\" said Artur Wojtków, Vice-President of the JSW SA Management Board for Labor and Social Policy.\n\nAs part of its educational activities, the Polish Olympic Committee organizes meetings at its headquarters, among others: for children from orphanages, youths from sports schools, especially from the region of JSW S.A.'s operations. Young people visiting Warsaw have the opportunity to visit the headquarters of the Polish Olympic Committee - the home of Polish sports, meet Polish Olympians, Olympic medalists, but most importantly gain knowledge about the Olympic values and ideas that have guided the Polish Olympic Movement in its over 100-year history. The first visits to the headquarters of the Polish Olympic Committee are already behind us. Subsequent meetings with Olympians will be held, among others, in Jastrzębie-Zdrój.\n\n“I am proud that we have become an official sponsor of the Polish Olympic Committee. For Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa this is an honor and a great responsibility,\" said Tomasz Cudny, President of the JSW SA Management Board. “Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa has always been dedicated to the idea of sports. For years we have been a strategic sponsor of leading Polish teams, including volleyball and hockey. Thanks to our cooperation with the PKOl, we are becoming an important patron for Polish sports. I believe that through this initiative, we will jointly build a strong foundation for young talents and contribute to the development of sports in our country,\" added President Tomasz Cudny.\n\nAccording to the new policy of the PKOl and President Radosław Piesiewicz, who is the originator of the support of Polish sports associations by companies cooperating with PKOl, five more Polish sports associations will be the beneficiaries of the agreement: Polish Field Hockey Association, Polish Archery Association, Polish Surfing Association, Polish Modern Pentathlon Association and Polish Cycling Association. In addition, under the agreement, JSW SA will support the activities of the Polish Basketball League.\n\nPursuant to the agreement, Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa SA is granted the right to use the titles: \"Sponsor of the Polish Olympic Committee\" and \"Sponsor of Poland’s Olympic National Team.\"\n\nThere two important sports events before the Polish Olympic Committee. As early as 19 January next year, the IV Winter Youth Olympic Games Gangwon 2024 will begin in South Korea, and next summer the world's most important quadrennial sports event - the XXXIII Olympic Games Paris 2024 - will take place.\n\nThe Paris Games will be special for the Polish Olympic Committee in many ways. It is in the French capital that we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Polish Olympic Team's performances in the Olympic Games. For the first time Poland, as a country, in the summer edition of the Olympic Games, the most important sporting event in the world, competed during the VIII Olympic Games precisely in Paris (1924) and won the first Olympic medals there!\n\n2024 will also be a special year for all Polish Olympians - both summer and winter. 100 years ago, in 1924, Poland as a country made its Olympic debut twice. First at the First Olympic Winter Games Chamonix 1924, and then at the Games of the VIII Olympiad Paris 1924. For this reason, among others, but most importantly for the 100th anniversary of the first Olympic medal for Poland, under the Resolution of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland of 28 July 2023, 2024 was declared the Year of Polish Olympians. The first Olympic medal (silver) for our country was won by the track cycling team composed of: Józef Lange, Jan Łazarski, Tomasz Stankiewicz and Franciszek Szymczyk. The Poles lost only to Italy in the 4,000-meter pursuit race.\n\nThe IV Winter Youth Olympic Games Gangwon 2024 will be held from 19 January to 01 February. The Games of the XXXIII Olympiad Paris 2024, in turn, will be held from 26 July to 11 August."
