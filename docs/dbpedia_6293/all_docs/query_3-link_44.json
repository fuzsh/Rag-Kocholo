On the journey, they encountered animals new to them, bison, grizzly bears, antelope, jackrabbits and their favorite, prairie dogs. They also found feared animals such as rattlesnakes and mosquitoes. The emigrants often anthropomorphized the animals, turning the creatures into representations of the family they had left behind or attached to the animals’ human desires for their futures. They knew the animals provided food for the journey, but they also saw hope for the future of the United States in the wild animals.

The word “taboo” is Polynesian and means ‘sacred’ or ‘forbidden’; it has a quasi-magical or religious overtone. The term was introduced in the anthropological literature in the second half of the 19th century. In the field of food and nutrition, food taboos are not necessarily connected with magical-religious practices, and some nutritionists prefer to speak of “food avoidance.” Come learn about why we don’t eat what we don’t eat.\n\nPresenter: John Horgan\n\nWed, June 7, 10-11:15am\n\nDelivery type: In-person with Livestream Location: Hefter & Zoom\n\n$10, Program No. SUM:306\n\nKabuki Theatre: Past and Present\n\nKabuki theater is bound by long history and traditions.

This class will offer detailed information to help us decide. Gold, silver, and available lands brought people to the American West. The movement included thousands of women who were wives and mothers, but it also brought women west to seek their own fortunes who were hoping to escape the restrictions of the Cult of True Womanhood. Because of their rarity, women were able to participate in activities and professions that only men could do “back in the East.” Women tried to maintain their status as “ladies,” while at the same time trying to become independent from the constraints put on them by late nineteenth-century society. Women in the American West opened the doors for those who followed them in business, politics, and society.\n\nPresenter: Diana Ahmad\n\nTue, June 13, 10-11:15am\n\nDelivery type: In-person with Livestream Location: Hefter & Zoom\n\n$10, Program No. SUM:314\n\nGenerating Additional Income from Investments\n\nGenerating income from Bonds, Bond Funds, CDs and Income Funds, has been extremely challenging for years.

What is a greater wonder is that almost 40 percent of our food supply is wasted; a significant jump from the first time the figure was measured, which stood at 28 percent in 1974. That’s a problem that much of the rest of the world would like to have, a perfect storm of overabundance, too many choices, overbuying, and crafty store designers. Come learn about the history and geography of supermarkets.\n\nPresenter: Dr. John Horgan\n\nWed, June 14, 10-11:15am\n\nDelivery type: In-person with Livestream Location: Hefter & Zoom\n\n$10, Program No. SUM:318\n\nThe Dickey Chapelle Story\n\nMilwaukee PBS produced an hour-long documentary on Georgette Louise Meyer who grew up in Shorewood, Wisconsin.

Hope is crucial in a time when insurmountable challenges present themselves. The generative, creative aspects of hope motivate individuals to persevere in the face of inherent obstacles. Hope and Creativity explores the relationship between the two, the kinds and characteristics of hope, and the faces and voices of hope.
