        "text": "The iconography of the Holocaust in Slovak literature between the late 1940s and mid-1950s was also created by texts that are almost forgotten today. The article discusses prosaic works by two Slovak writers. Some of these works belong to the early period of the Holocaust reception and some of them originated later. Literary history paid little or no attention especially to older works. One of the writers discussed in the article, Hela Volanská, disappeared from the literary life after 1970. The article discusses her works O živých a mŕtvych (On Those Who Are Alive and Dead, 1948) and Ako na cudzej svadbe (As at Somebody Else's Wedding, 1987/2009). The other writer discussed in this article, Ľudo Zúbek, is an established name of Slovak literature, but is known mostly as an author of historical and biographical fiction, including a novel Jar Adely Ostrolúckej (Adela Ostrolúcka's Spring, 1957), which is today incorrectly considered literature for young female readers. Other Zúbek's works reached very little attention and acknowledgement. The article discusses his prosaic works Rozbitá dúha (Broken Rainbow, 1956) and Vltava (without date). Keywords: iconography of the Holocaust; the 20 th century Slovak literature; Volanská Hela; Zúbek Ľudo Taking into consideration a common state of Czechs and Slovaks, the theme of the Holocaust (Shoah) in Slovak literature went through several phases similar to those in Czech literature. A Czech literary historian Jiří Holý distinguishes several stages. The first one (1945–1949) is marked by immediate reactions of direct witnesses who survived the Holocaust. These reactions had a documentary character, and were based on survi-vors' own experience. Memoirs, diaries and letters were common genres. A change of the political regime in 1948 meant suppressing the theme of\n\nEarly 2011 saw the publication in Poland of three noteworthy studies exploring Polish behaviour toward the Jews during World War II and the various forms of Polish participation in the Holocaust. These publications clearly advance the state of research, although they do not completely exhaust the topic, or even come close to that. They interrogate the image of the Holocaust as a largely German undertaking that has had a strong presence both in German and Polish research down to the present. The existence of this image is bound up with the historiographic circumstance that now as before, German Holocaust research is more closely connected with the German regime of occupation or the German Einsatzgruppen and execution units and less with the population under occupation, and in this way concentrates on the perspective of the German perpetrators. There is a concomitant tendency to neglect the perspective of the non-German perpetrators (and in part also that of the victims). By contrast, Polish Holocaust research has until recently viewed the Poles solely as victims of the National Socialist regime of occupation, and seen the murder of the Jews as an exclusively German matter. All three publications are written contra these continuing tendencies in thought and inquiry.\n\nThe article discusses several Slovak plays with the theme of the Holocaust; namely Ticho (Silence) by Juraj Váh, Holokaust (Holocaust) by Viliam Klimáček, and Rabínka (The Woman Rabbi) by Anna Grusková. It also briefly refers to Návrat do života (Return to Life) and Antigona a tí druhí (Antigone and Those Others) by Peter Karvaš, both mediating traumas from concentration camps. Two plays (Ticho and Návrat do života) were written and staged immediately after the Second World War. Karvaš’s Antigona is a rare occurrence of the theme in Slovak drama during the Communism (in the early 1960s), whereas Klimáček’s and Grusková’s plays are recent, both staged in 2012. The article focuses on several aspects of these five plays: on dramatic characters representing “victims”, “witnesses” and “culprits” (Panas, quoted in Gawliński 2007: 19); on references about and/or representation of the Holocaust in dramatic texts; and on the type of the conflict(s) in the plays. It also mentions specific app...\n\nBohemia and Moravia, today part of the Czech Republic, was the first territory with a majority of non-German speakers occupied by Hitler’s Third Reich on the eve of the World War II. Tens of thousands of Jewish inhabitants in the so called Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia soon felt the tragic consequences of Nazi racial politics. Not all Czechs, however, remained passive bystanders during the genocide. After the destruction of Czechoslovakia in 1938-39, Slovakia became a formally independent but fully subordinate satellite of Germany. Despite the fact it was not occupied until 1944, Slovakia paid Germany to deport its own Jewish citizens to extermination camps. About 270,000 out of the 360,000 Czech and Slovak casualties of World War II were victims of the Holocaust. Despite these statistics, the Holocaust vanished almost entirely from post-war Czechoslovak, and later Czech and Slovak, historical cultures. The communist dictatorship carried the main responsibility for this disappearance, yet the situation has not changed much since the fall of the communist regime. The main questions of this study are how and why the Holocaust was excluded from the Czech and Slovak history."
