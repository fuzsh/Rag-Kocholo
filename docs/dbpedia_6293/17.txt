Diaries

Christoph Sauser (2009 - present) Index

Last summer, Christoph Sauser fulfilled a long-time dream when he became the mountain bike cross country World Champion. The 33-year-old Swiss rider of Team Specialized Factory Racing is racing in the rainbow stripes as he works toward a goal of defending his championship title in Canberra, Australia.

Going into the 2009 season, Sauser counted 14 UCI World Cup wins, and he has twice been the World Cup overall champion - in 2004 & 2005. He can go fast over long distances, too. Sauser won the mountain bike marathon World Championships in 2007 and finished as the runner-up in 2008.

Follow Sauser's travels around the globe as he races the World Cup cross country circuit and some marathon and stage races throughout 2009.

Gunn-Rita Dahle diary (2005- present): Index

Norwegian cross-country mountain bike racer Gunn-Rita Dahle Flesj� made an impressive comeback last year after sitting out much of the previous season due to illness. In 2008, she won the Madrid, Spain, round of the UCI World Cup and the UCI Marathon World Championships and finished 12th in the World Cup final standings.

Dahle Flesj� will take on a new challenge in 2009 when she gives birth to her first child, expected in late March. With the support of her husband Kenneth Flesj� and her family, she aims to return to competition within a few months after becoming a mother.

Don't count her out for the late season World Cups and World Championships races. She was World Champion in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006, plus Olympic champion in 2004. In 2003 to 2006, she dominated the sport, winning the World Cup overall.

Mary McConneloug & Mike Broderick diary (2006 - present): Index

MTB "super-couple", US National cross country champion Mary McConneloug and Mike Broderick live together, train together, travel together and race together. They also share this diary on Cyclingnews.

Follow their adventures as they race the World Cup cross country circuit throughout 2009. Enjoy the unique, professional racing style of these two accomplished racers and world travelers.

Team TORQ diary (2008 - present) Index

The UCI-registered Australian TORQ/VIS mountain bike team team, features some of Australia's top racers and future stars, including VIS scholarship recipients Tory Thomas, Robbie Hucker, and Cal Britton, Olympian Dan McConnell, and James Maebus, Katherine O'Shea, Joanna Wall, Luke Fetch, Steele von Hoff and Paul Weymouth.

TORQ racers are targeting the Australian MTB National Series, National Championships and Oceania Continental Championships. The team's top priority is racing Olympic distance cross country events, but it is also mixing things up with some short track, marathon and endurance events - and maybe even some road races. Some members will head abroad for the World Cups  an important part of Australian national team selection process for the 2009 World Championships to be held in Canberra, Australia. They take turns sharing their experience in this diary.

The Geoff Kabush diary (2004 - present): Index

A born and bred Canadian, Geoff Kabush, is known for racing his bike fast and having fun. He races mountain bikes, cyclo-cross, sometimes road and is flying the Team Maxxis-Rocky Mountain banner in 2009. After playing every sport in high school, Kabush decided to take racing seriously after attending his first Mountain Bike World Championship as a junior in 1995. Attending the University of Victoria and studying engineering he slowly moved through the ranks until a breakthrough in 2000 saw him representing Canada at the Sydney Olympics. After consistently being on the podium for several years, it wasn't until 2004 and a switch to Team Maxxis that the wins started piling up.

Eddie & Namrita O'Dea diary (2008): Index

Eddie and Namrita O'Dea are two married racers balancing the demands of professional racing and training for and even the promoting of endurance races. The Vassago Cycles-sponsored duo will travel the US national circuit of 24 hour solo events in 2008 while dropping in on assorted 100 milers and 12 hour races in between.

Keith Bontrager diary (2005 - 2008): Index

Keith Bontrager is best known as the bike and component design guru behind his eponymous road and mountain bike components, but behind the scenes the man universally known as KB is an enthusiastic and well-respected endurance mountain bike racer. KB has taken part in over 50 24-hour races in the last few years and helped promote some, too, and in his diary takes us inside the mental, physical and technical challenges of long-distance mountain bike racing.
