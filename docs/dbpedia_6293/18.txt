Thirty-one riders started with most of the races were conducted with three cyclists at a time. Twelve first round races and six repêchages advanced 18 riders to six quarter-finals. The winners of the six quarters and three repêchages produced nine cyclists who rode in three semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals advanced to the final, where three riders race for the medals. All the rounds were conducted as a single race. The 1923 World Champion was France’s Jean Cugnot.He was favored along with Maurice Peeters (NED), who had won the Grand Prix de Paris in 1920 and was the defending champion, and American William Fenn. However, neither rider made the semis, both losing in the quarter-final repêchages. The third favorite was France’s Lucien Michard, winner of the Grand Prix de Paris in 1922 and 1924. The three semis were won by Frenchmen Michard and Jean Cugnot, and Jaap Meijer (NED), who contested the final. In the final, Cugnot led out the race, with Michard on his wheel. In the final sprint, both Michard and Meijer passed Cugnot, who finished third, with Michard edging out Meijer for the gold medal. Michard would become the best amateur sprinter of the 1920s, winning the World Championships from 1927-30, and placing second in 1931-33.
