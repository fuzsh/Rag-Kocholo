Oliver Gao hg55@cornell.edu\n\nSystems Engineering, Cornell University\n\nAbstract\n\nUrban transit bus idling is a contributor to ecological stress, economic inefficiency, and medically hazardous health outcomes due to emissions. The global accumulation of this frequent pattern of undesirable driving behavior is enormous. In order to measure its scale, we propose GRD-TRT-BUF-4I (“Ground Truth Buffer for Idling”) an extensible, realtime detection system that records the geolocation and idling duration of urban transit bus fleets internationally. Using live vehicle locations from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Realtime, the system detects approximately 200,000 idling events per day from over 50 cities across North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. This realtime data was created to dynamically serve operational decision-making and fleet management to reduce the frequency and duration of idling events as they occur, as well as to capture its accumulative effects. Civil and Transportation Engineers, Urban Planners, Epidemiologists, Policymakers, and other stakeholders might find this useful for emissions modeling, traffic management, route planning, and other urban sustainability efforts at a variety of geographic and temporal scales.\n\n1 Background & Summary\n\nUrban transit buses provide essential transportation services in cities around the world. In Brazil, they are the most common mode of transportation [1]. In India, they are the third most preferred mode of transportation, where the size of their national fleet increased by nearly 30% between 2009 and 2019, from nearly 118,00 vehicles to more than 152,000 [2, 3]. China also increased the size of its national fleet over roughly the same period, totaling nearly 600,000 vehicles in 2021 [4]. In the United States, nearly half of all passenger trips on public transportation were facilitated by urban transit buses, amounting to approximately 6.2 billion trips in 2022, most of which were powered by diesel fuel [5, 6].\n\nData from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) reported that in 2020, more than 96% of all commuter buses in the United States were diesel-powered [6]. All other fuel types such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), biodiesel, gasoline, propane, hydrogen, hybrid, and battery-electric accounted for less than 4% of all fielded vehicles when combined [6]. Even throughout Europe, where aggressive measures have been taken to transition away from diesel-powered vehicles, the most common type of newly fielded urban transit bus in 2021 was indeed diesel-powered [7]. Although many implications emerge in this regard, engine idling is a concern worldwide.\n\nIdling is when a vehicle’s engine is in operation, but is geographically stationary [8]. While individual idling events may seem insignificant, the total accumulation of these ephemeral, but repeated events is material. For instance, in 2022 the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that urban transit buses in the United States idled for roughly 40% of their typical 9-hour operational period based on data from 16 vehicles over 19,440 hours (2.22 years) of cumulative driving time [9]. An earlier study from 2010 reported similar findings throughout the United Kingdom, where idling rates were between 30% and 44% [10]. A smaller scale, but more detailed example in South Korea found similar idling rates near 43% [11].\n\nEcological stress, economic inefficiency, and medically hazardous health outcomes - among others - all simultaneously emerge from this frequent and repeated pattern of undesirable driving behavior [12, 13, 14]. A single idling urban transit bus can consume 0.5 gal (1.9 L) of diesel fuel per hour, emitting approximately 11.1 lbs (5 kg) of CO2subscriptCO2\\text{CO}_{2}CO start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT equivalent GHG, 2.7 g of VOC, 2.7 g of THC, 37.4 g of CO, 61.1 g of NOxsubscriptNO𝑥\\text{NO}_{x}NO start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, 1.2 g of PM10subscriptPM10\\text{PM}_{10}PM start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 10 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and 1.1 g of PM2.5subscriptPM2.5\\text{PM}_{2.5}PM start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2.5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [15, 16]. These pollutants pose serious health risks including asthma, cardiovascular disease, liver and kidney damage [17, 18, 19]. Furthermore, noise from urban transit bus idling is a reported burden loud enough to potentially cause permanent hearing loss at SEL and Lm⁢a⁢xsubscript𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥L_{max}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_a italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT A-weighted decibel levels of 111 dBA and 75 dBA, respectively [13, 14].\n\nWhile the negative impacts of urban transit bus idling are numerous and evident, the magnitude of the problem has begun to emerge as a category of its own concern [20, 21]. Existing studies tend to focus on historical information from selected localities that are limited to a municipal, regional, or national fleet [12, 22, 23]. Few if any comprehensively measure the interfleet phenomena in realtime on an international scale. Well-established developments like the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Realtime have enabled transit agencies to share realtime data on service disruptions, vehicle locations, and arrival times using a standard schema since 2011 [24, 25]. Growing international adoption of GTFS Realtime now affords the possibility to integrate these data sources using a common ingestion method [21], as exhibited here.\n\nThis geolocated realtime data is the first record of urban transit bus idling measured on a global scale. It immediately describes the worldwide phenomena when and where it occurs, giving transit agencies around the world the collective ability to actively intercept idling events, rather than merely measure the problem, only to analyze its negative impact after the fact. This shift would mark a significant advancement in the approach to reducing urban transit bus fleet idling worldwide by moving from reactive policies based on historical trends to preemptive measures based on proactive reduction strategies. The extensibility of this effort also allows easy integration of new GTFS Realtime sources as they become available. Those that fit within this scope are described in the following section Data Sources.\n\n2 Methods\n\n2.1 Data Sources\n\nLive vehicle locations from on-network urban transit bus fleets from over 50 cities were collected using GTFS Realtime. Although there are hundreds of GTFS Realtime sources, those that were selected, satisfied a combination of immediate availability, geographic variety, sufficient fleet size, daily operational length, and active support of each endpoint. Note that transit agencies may not elect to adopt GTFS Realtime for reasons regarding development cost, technical expertise and maintenance, usage of existing systems, lack of political support or priority [26, 27].\n\nTo ensure authenticity and reproducibility, data from GTFS Realtime was collected from publicly accessible Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints provided by the transit agencies directly, rather than relying on private third-party aggregation. All data sources were consumed as Protocol Buffers, sometimes referred to as “protobufs” [28, 29]. An example of the deserialized protobuf schema is exhibited in Figure 2 and Figure 3.\n\nEach data source was categorized according to its geographic region, where each region contained between 1 to 6 sources depending on the availability and stability of the REST API. Table 2 through Table 12 exhibit each data source and its corresponding region. Some regions were nested within national categories belonging to the same continent. In other cases, few enough data sources were available that the continent directly represented the region, such as Oceania and Asia.\n\nNote that in Table 1, the Greater designation in the Country column indicates the corresponding region contains more than one country. Similarly, the italicized names in the City column in Table 2 through Table 12 include neighboring cities from the broader metropolitan area. For example, Minneapolis includes neighboring St. Paul, San Francisco includes neighboring Oakland, etc. Other cities may also include locations beyond their proper municipal geographic boundary. However, those that are stylized were specified as such because of their immediate availability.\n\n2.2 Buffering Procedure\n\nEach geographic region (US East •, US West •, etc.) previously mentioned in Data Sources, represents an asynchronous feed, FeedisubscriptFeed𝑖\\text{Feed}_{i}Feed start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, exhibited in Figure 4. It is constructed from its corresponding GTFS Realtime sources. As FeedisubscriptFeed𝑖\\text{Feed}_{i}Feed start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT enters the buffer, it is stored in memory as disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT according to indices d0,d1,d2,subscript𝑑0subscript𝑑1subscript𝑑2d_{0},d_{1},d_{2},italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ,…,dh+1,d_{h+1}, italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT at time t,t+1,t+2,𝑡𝑡1𝑡2t,t+1,t+2,italic_t , italic_t + 1 , italic_t + 2 ,…,t+h+1,t+h+1, italic_t + italic_h + 1, respectively.\n\nAfter the buffer is populated to length T𝑇Titalic_T, the buffering procedure is fully initialized. As new FeedisubscriptFeed𝑖\\text{Feed}_{i}Feed start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT enters the buffer at time t𝑡titalic_t once initialized, Feedi+h+2subscriptFeed𝑖ℎ2\\text{Feed}_{i+h+2}Feed start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i + italic_h + 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is omitted beyond buffer length T𝑇Titalic_T. This step is repeated theoretically to ∞\\infty∞ or practically until the procedure is stopped.\n\nAfter initializing the buffer, as well as when FeedisubscriptFeed𝑖\\text{Feed}_{i}Feed start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT enters it, the index d0subscript𝑑0d_{0}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is treated as set A𝐴Aitalic_A, index dhsubscript𝑑ℎd_{h}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT treated as set B𝐵Bitalic_B, and index dh+1subscript𝑑ℎ1d_{h+1}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT treated as set C𝐶Citalic_C. In other words, sets A,B,C𝐴𝐵𝐶A,B,Citalic_A , italic_B , italic_C are equivalent to buffer indices d0,dh,dh+1subscript𝑑0subscript𝑑ℎsubscript𝑑ℎ1d_{0},d_{h},d_{h+1}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, respectively. The subsetting procedure is fully initialized with sets A,B,C𝐴𝐵𝐶A,B,Citalic_A , italic_B , italic_C.\n\nn⁢(A∩B)𝑛𝐴𝐵n(A\\cap B)italic_n ( italic_A ∩ italic_B ) is then computed, such that Ansuperscript𝐴𝑛A^{n}italic_A start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and Bnsuperscript𝐵𝑛B^{n}italic_B start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT are of length n𝑛nitalic_n. 𝒜𝒜\\mathcal{A}caligraphic_A and ℬℬ\\mathcal{B}caligraphic_B are also of length n𝑛nitalic_n and are further subsets of A𝐴Aitalic_A and B𝐵Bitalic_B, only containing elements x𝑥xitalic_x and y𝑦yitalic_y, respectively, subset from attributes j𝑗jitalic_j. Similarly, elements z𝑧zitalic_z in 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}caligraphic_C are subset from the same attributes j𝑗jitalic_j. ℋisubscriptℋ𝑖\\mathcal{H}_{i}caligraphic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is then computed from 𝒜∩ℬ𝒜ℬ\\mathcal{A}\\cap\\mathcal{B}caligraphic_A ∩ caligraphic_B. Finally, 𝒴=ℋ∩𝒞𝒴ℋ𝒞\\mathcal{Y}=\\mathcal{H}\\cap\\mathcal{C}caligraphic_Y = caligraphic_H ∩ caligraphic_C.

However, it is not appended, as it is the final subset of length 𝒴ksuperscript𝒴𝑘\\mathcal{Y}^{k}caligraphic_Y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. As the final output, 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}caligraphic_Y resolves this series of expressions describing the subsetting procedure. The following section Computational Procedure describes its parameters and how it’s computed.\n\n2.4 Computational Procedure\n\nCombining Buffering Procedure and Subsetting Procedure, Algorithm 1 GRD-TRT-BUF-4I (“Ground Truth Buffer for Idling\") casts them into step-by-step instructions for computing realtime idling events. There are three parameters:\n\n1.\n\nr𝑟ritalic_r: the rate at which GTFS Realtime server requests are made (seconds). It is a positive integer. r𝑟ritalic_r has a default value of 30 seconds and should not exceed the rate limit of any GTFS Realtime server. It is recommended that r𝑟ritalic_r not take values less than the frequency of vehicle location updates, which are typically updated every 30 seconds.\n\n2.\n\nhℎhitalic_h: the number of time-steps t𝑡titalic_t after an idling event is measured (interval). It is a positive integer. hℎhitalic_h has a default value of 1. In the case that the default value of r𝑟ritalic_r remains unchanged, any number of seconds beyond 60 seconds is recorded as an idling event. Alternatively, specifying hℎhitalic_h as 2 would consider an idling event any number of seconds beyond 90 seconds, all else equal.\n\n3.\n\nm𝑚mitalic_m: a constant used to bound the length of appended subset ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}caligraphic_H (iterations). It is a positive integer. m𝑚mitalic_m has an arbitrary default value of 10. It is the maximum allowable iterations that elements z∈ℋ𝑧ℋz\\in\\mathcal{H}italic_z ∈ caligraphic_H are stored before being omitted when also not found in set 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}caligraphic_C. In other words, the elements z𝑧zitalic_z are removed from the appended set ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}caligraphic_H after m𝑚mitalic_m number of iterations they are not within ℋ∩Cℋ𝐶\\mathcal{H}\\cap Ccaligraphic_H ∩ italic_C.\n\nAfter r𝑟ritalic_r, hℎhitalic_h, and m𝑚mitalic_m are specified, an infinite loop is conducted outside the process in which Buffering Procedure and Subsetting Procedure are both initialized and computed. Additional instructions in GRD-TRT-BUF-4I from steps 10 to 22 correspond to the subset ℋℋ\\mathcal{H}caligraphic_H.\n\nFinally, 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}caligraphic_Y is computed as the primary output and is immediately returned and stored on disk. The following section System Architecture & Design broadly outlines a collection of components and their relationships in this regard.\n\n2.5 System Architecture & Design\n\n2.5.1 System Architecture\n\nThe system contains the basic functions of Algorithm 1 GRD-TRT-BUF-4I. It is modeled through the Integration Definition for Process Modeling (IDEF0), exhibited in Figure 5. Each component takes an input (left pointer), yields an output (right pointer), and requires a mechanism (bottom pointer). Those that process intermediate results also take control parameters (top pointer).\n\nFirst, the Serve component inputs “Fleet” - the telemetry data collected from the live location of vehicles in the network of urban transit bus fleets. It outputs “FeedisubscriptFeed𝑖\\text{Feed}_{i}Feed start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT”, the GTFS Realtime feeds, and requires the open internet or “Web” as a mechanism. Note that this process is modeled for architectural context, where no explicit controls are required.\n\nThe Extract component inputs the GTFS Realtime sources, FeedisubscriptFeed𝑖\\text{Feed}_{i}Feed start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and outputs the extracted data disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, requiring an API key(s) or “Key” as a mechanism to authorize REST API endpoint(s) access where required. The request rate is controlled by r𝑟ritalic_r, as previously described in Computational Procedure. The purpose of this component is to asynchronously extract GTFS Realtime data.\n\nThe Buffer component inputs extracted data disubscript𝑑𝑖d_{i}italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and outputs sets A𝐴Aitalic_A, B𝐵Bitalic_B, C𝐶Citalic_C taken from buffer indicies d0,dh,subscript𝑑0subscript𝑑ℎd_{0},d_{h},italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ,…,dh+1,d_{h+1}, italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_h + 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, respectively. It uses RAM or “Memory” as a mechanism to store the contents and is controlled by hℎhitalic_h, as previously described in Computational Procedure. The purpose of this component is to roll the extracted data into and out of memory.\n\nThe Subset component inputs sets A𝐴Aitalic_A, B𝐵Bitalic_B, C𝐶Citalic_C and outputs the realtime idling events 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}caligraphic_Y. It uses a series of set operations or “Operators” as a mechanism, and is controlled by m𝑚mitalic_m, as previously described in Computational Procedure. The purpose of this component is to compute the primary logic of Algorithm 1 GRD-TRT-BUF-4I.\n\nFinally, the Store component inputs the realtime idling events 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}caligraphic_Y and outputs them as historical information “Data”. It uses a database or “Disk” as a mechanism. The purpose of this component is to capture the historical record of realtime idling events so that they can be queried in downstream analyses. No explicit controls are required.\n\n2.5.2 System Design\n\nThe system design implements a more detailed construction of the System Architecture. It casts the IDEF0 architecture into a common Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) microservice design pattern based on geographic region (US East •, US West •, etc.), exhibited in Figure 6. The system uses templated ETL pipelines per region, where each microservice corresponds to the ETL phase that it is nested within. Each microservice is then duplicated an arbitrary number of times, increasing redundancy to avoid single points of failure.\n\nFor each geographic region (Region 1, Region 2, ……...…, Region N𝑁Nitalic_N), the Extract phase asynchronously extracts data from the associated GTFS Realtime servers (Server 1, Server 2, ……...…, Server n𝑛nitalic_n), previously outlined in System Architecture. The Transform phase then computes GRD-TRT-BUF-4I from the extracted data, as previously mentioned in Computational Procedure. Finally, the Load phase uses the “Write” microservices to insert the realtime idling event data into the Events table within the “Store” microservice.\n\nModular decoupling of components into microservices allows users to directly access any phase of the ETL pipeline throughout any and all geographic regions. The design not only allows this, but strongly encourages it. To use the realtime idling event data, users access the “Subset” microservice directly, rather than through “Write” or “Store”. This is achieved through the Subset API’s and is explained later in Usage Notes.\n\nNote that while casting the IDEF0 architecture into an ETL microservice design, the “Buffer” components are integrated within the “Subset” microservices along with parameters r, h, and m as a practical design choice. The “Write” microservices are introduced to appropriately decouple their associated function per geographic region, whereas the alternative would require a tightly coupled design with either “Subset” or “Store”. In addition, the Agency table is persisted within “Store” and is explained in the following section Data Records.\n\n3 Data Records\n\nThere are three ways to use the data. The first is through the Realtime Responses. The second is through a historical record of realtime responses in the Relational Database. The third is through the Static Files queried from the Relational Database.\n\n3.1 Realtime Responses\n\nThe realtime responses are JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects generated by the Subset microservice. Connecting to any of the Subset API’s requires access to the region’s REST API endpoint via Websocket. This is explained later in Usage Notes.\n\nThe JSON response will typically contain an array of key-value pairs. In the rare case that no idling events are detected, an empty response is returned without error. A typical JSON response contains eight keys: iata_id, vehicle_id, route_id, trip_id, latitude, longitude, datetime, and duration.\n\nThe JSON keys are equivalent to the fields found in Events Table. Each field is described in Table 15 in the following section Relational Database. An example of a typical JSON response is exhibited in Figure 7. Recall that this is 𝒴𝒴\\mathcal{Y}caligraphic_Y from Subsetting Procedure.\n\n3.3 Static Files\n\nThere are three static files that can be downloaded in Comma Separated Value (.csv) format. Each file is a result from a table join between the Agency table and the Events table. Static files contain all fields found in both tables over a 24-hour collection period. The first file test-data-a.csv was collected from December 31, 2023 00:01:30 UTC to January 1, 2024 00:01:30 UTC. The second file test-data-b.csv was collected from January 4, 2024 01:30:30 UTC to January 5, 2024 01:30:30 UTC. The third file test-data-c.csv was collected from January 10, 2024 16:05:30 UTC to January 11, 2024 16:05:30 UTC. They can be downloaded at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25224224\n\nFigure 9 exhibits the query used to create the first static file from the relational database, previously mentioned in Relational Database. The subsequent files were created using this query corresponding to their respective datetime ranges. Table 17 provides a truncated example of the files. Again, they can be downloaded in .csv format. They are the same .csv files used for evaluating data quality in the following section Technical Validation.\n\n4 Technical Validation\n\nRealtime data quality was assessed using three separate 24-hour validation periods. As previously mentioned in Static Files, the first was conducted from December 31, 2023 00:01:30 UTC to January 1, 2024 00:01:30 UTC using test-data-a.csv. The second from January 4, 2024 01:30:30 UTC to January 5, 2024 01:30:30 UTC using test-data-b.csv. The third from January 10, 2024 16:05:30 UTC to January 11, 2024 16:05:30 UTC using test-data-c.csv.\n\nAll three validation periods were arbitrarily specified and enforced a 72-hour minimum resting period to proxy independence. A battery of 113 individual tests were conducted for each 24-hour validation period to ensure realtime data quality throughout six overlapping categories: Data Types, Duplication, Missingness, Geolocation Error, Temporal Contiguity, and Expected Duration. Each category and its corresponding tests are explained in greater detail below.\n\n4.1 Data Types\n\nAll data type test results were as expected for all validation periods. Exhibited in Table 18, test number 1 found the expected data object. Test numbers 2 to 7 found obvious string types - tests 8 to 10, also string types. Note that vehicle_id, route_id, and trip_id contained numerical values in some cases, but were found to be correctly encoded as string types. Geocoordinates from test numbers 12 and 13 were correctly encoded as float types. Test number 13 for datetime was correctly encoded as an integer type, as well as duration as an integer type in test number 14.\n\n4.2 Duplication\n\nOf the 192,237 observations in test-data-a.csv, 197,411 observations in test-data-b.csv, and 209,329 observations in test-data-c.csv, none of them contained duplicate observations, nor did they contain duplicate fields. Although Data Types previously implied that all validation periods contained the same unique fields, Table 19 exhibits this explicitly from the results of test number 15. In addition to all unique fields, test number 16 found all unique observations.\n\n4.3 Missingness\n\nTwo of thirteen fields contained missing values across all validation periods. In Table 20, test number 24 found that route_id averaged (unweighted) 7.66% missingness. Test number 25 found that trip_id averaged (unweighted) 1.38% missingness. Although both route_id and trip_id contained missing values, when tested together, no missing values were present. Test number 26 found that every observation contained either a route_id or trip_id or both.\n\n4.4 Geolocation Error\n\n4.4.1 General Error\n\nGeneral geolocation tests did not find any value errors across all validation periods. Table 21 and Table 22 exhibit the test results in the latitude and longitude fields, respectively. Tests 31 to 33 corresponding to latitude and tests 34 to 36 corresponding to longitude, did not find any zero values or those outside the projected bounds of the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). Recall tests 11 and 12 in Data Types, and 27 and 28 in Missingness, also did not contain value errors.\n\n4.4.2 Spatial Point Error\n\nIn addition to the value error tests previously mentioned in General Error, each idling event was tested to ensure the recorded geolocation was within a reasonable proximity to the shape of the corresponding route path. The shape of the route paths and their identifiers were collected from the GTFS static data corresponding to the GTFS Realtime source. The shape of the route paths were used as a geographic benchmark to validate the measured geolocation of a given idling event - anticipating the route_id or trip_id should be geographically near the shape of its corresponding route path. Recall test 26 from Missingness found that every observation contained either a route_id, trip_id, or both.\n\nThe notion of reasonable proximity was operationalized as a distance threshold specified with three primary considerations. First, the width of a typical urban arterial street was used as a tolerable margin of error between approximately 15 to 20 meters throughout varying degrees of urban density [81, 82, 83]. Second, Global Positioning System (GPS) location errors were estimated between 5 to 10 meters, especially in the context of urban environments where buildings, infrastructure, etc. can all obstruct reported vehicle locations [84, 85, 86]. Third, a preliminary test was drawn on a series of distance thresholds that combined the first two considerations and specified its midpoint to ensure that 25 meters was flexible enough to afford meaningful results, as exhibited in Figure 10.\n\n001010101020202020303030304040404050505050606060607070707080808080909090901001001001000010101010202020203030303040404040505050506060606070707070808080809090909010010010010025Distance Threshold

Any e𝑒eitalic_e greater than 0% indicates that there were idling events measured outside of it.\n\nTable 23 exhibits the global average spatial point errors for all validation periods. The reported averages are both weighted and unweighted. Weighted averages are weighted by the number of observations per city, whereas the unweighted averages assign equal weight to all cities within the context of how they are reported, globally or regionally. Table 24 to Table 34 exhibit the test results for individual cities and their regional unweighted and weighted averages.\n\nGlobally, test numbers 37 and 38 found the unweighted and weighted average error did not exceed 6.50% and 5.05%, respectively. That is to say, the global average spatial point accuracy of measured idling events was at least 93.50%. Regionally, test number 52 in Table 25 found that 11.06% was the highest unweighted average error. Test number 67 in Table 27 found that 12.29% was the highest weighted average error. In other words, the average spatial point accuracy of measured idling events for any given region was at least 87.71%.\n\nNote that in Table 31, Table 32, and Table 34, cities without results encountered preliminary test errors. In those cases, identity mappings could not be established between route_id or trip_id and the shape of the corresponding route path, either because of unmatched identifiers or the shape of the corresponding route path was unavailable. In successful preliminary tests, the city is indicated along with the GTFS static data source and the geolocation error.\n\n4.5 Temporal Contiguity\n\nContinuous validity and consistency was globally tested throughout all validation periods. Exhibited in Table 35, test numbers 105 and 106 did not find any invalid values in the datetime field. Test number 107 found the average (unweighted) proportion of time that no observations were measured for longer than 1 minute was 2.75%. Test number 108 found the average (unweighted) longest single interval that no observations were measured was 4 minutes, 24 seconds. Also, in test 109, the average (unweighted) elapsed time from the first observation to the last was 23 hours and 58 minutes within the context of a 24-hour maximum time horizon, exhibited in Figure 11.\n\n4.6 Expected Duration\n\nThe global average idling duration was as expected throughout all validation periods. Exhibited in Table 36, test numbers 110 and 111 did not find any invalid values in the duration field. Test number 112 found when the minimum idling duration was adjusted to a commonly used policy definition longer than 5 minutes [8], the proportion of idling time denominated by total operational time was 38.74%. This is broadly consistent and within the 30% to 44% range from existing studies, previously mentioned in Background & Summary. Figure 12 exhibits this comparison, as well as when the minimum idling tolerance was unadjusted according to the parameterized definition h=1ℎ1h=1italic_h = 1 minute.\n\nWhen the minimum idling duration in test number 113 was unadjusted according to h=1ℎ1h=1italic_h = 1 minute, the average (unweighted) proportion of idling increased to 56.96%. Although approximately 18% of the average proportion of idling increased as the minimum idling tolerance decreased from 5 minutes to 1 minute, it is concluded that the duration field is still reliable and valid, given its combined consistency with existing studies when adjusted to a common policy definition of idling. The material difference between tests 112 and 113 is likely not a measurement error, but rather a unique feature of this data that warrants further investigation in downstream analyses.\n\n5 Usage Notes\n\nIt is highly encouraged that this realtime data is indeed used in realtime applications and analyses, as well as with historical methods.
