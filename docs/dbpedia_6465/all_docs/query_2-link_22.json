        "text": "Silver\n\nSilver was the longest used livery in Adelaide. Beginning in 1952 when the Municipal Tramways Trust began using silver with a red stripe, and their logo in red. This was originally for trams, but as the MTT began to operate more buses (and fewer trams), more buses received silver.\n\nMany different types of bus received this livery, as all privately operated buses which were acquired by the government in 1974 were repainted. The last buses to receive this livery were the MAN SL200s, which entered service in 1983. This is 31 years after its first introduction.\n\nThe ones which were repainted from private operators, and the subsequent deliveries of silver buses, all had their roofs painted white, going down to just above the windscreen.\n\nCurrently, BPASA member-owned buses 1001, 1897, 1900 and 1917 are in this livery.\n\nBrown Bomber\n\nThe “Brown Bomber” livery was introduced with the Volvo B58 and B10M buses, which entered service from 1980. This livery was largely based on a Mercedes demonstrator bus from Europe. This livery made buses to the outer northern, outer southern, and hills buses stand out from the inner city silver buses of the time, with the Volvo buses painted in this livery only operating in those regions.\n\nDemonstrator buses #1391 and #7000 later both wore this livery aswell.\n\nCurrently, BPASA member-owned bus 1466 is in this livery."
