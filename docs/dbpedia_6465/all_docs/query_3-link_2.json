        "text": "A new book by Wakefield Press\n\nADELAIDE’S PUBLIC TRANSPORT – THE FIRST 180 YEARS\n\nTom Wilson, with co-authors John Radcliffe and the late Christopher Steele\n\nPublished with assistance from the History Trust of South Australia\n\nAn electronic book on a USB stick\n\nISBN 978 1 74305 885 5 $59.95\n\nThe beautiful city of Adelaide, capital of South Australia, with a population approaching 1.4 million spread\n\nover an area about 90 kilometres long and 50 kilometres wide, has a fascinating public transport history,\n\nwith many similarities to, but also many differences from, other cities of a similar size. Despite being well\n\nplanned in 1836 by surveyor Colonel William Light with many straight, wide roads, its good road network\n\nhas presented many challenges for public transport in that it is very easy to drive a car anywhere during\n\nall but the relatively short peak periods.\n\nHorse-drawn cabs and horse buses commenced quite early and continued until about 1920. The first\n\nrailway opened in 1856. The suburban rail system operated by the South Australian Railways (SAR) was\n\nlargely complete by 1915, with 4 main lines, with some branches and two short railways to Glenelg,\n\nradiating from the city.\n\nCommencing in 1878, Adelaide developed what became Australia’s largest horse tramway network, horse\n\npower being suitable because most of Adelaide is built on a flat plain. By 1907 there were 17 suburban\n\nhorse tram routes, plus 3 in outer suburban locations.\n\nFrom 1909, most of the horse tramways were electrified by the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT).\n\nThe first privately owned motor buses began to appear from 1904, and after the end of World War I, many ex-servicemen purchased truck chasses, built bus bodies on them with various levels of sophistication and proceeded to run them in opposition to the railways and tramways until the government bought them out in 1928. Some buses were later sold back to private operators.\n\nBy the early 1930s there were about 22 suburban electric tram routes plus 4 at Port Adelaide. In the late\n\n1920s the authorities could see that electric trains in the form of ‘interurban’ type tramways (these days\n\nknown as ‘light rail’) might be better serving the suburbs than would the steam trains, and as a result one\n\nrailway – that to Glenelg, was converted to light rail.\n\nThe MTT commenced operating a motor bus fleet in 1925, and in 1932 the MTT experimented with the\n\nfirst electric trolley bus in Australia. From 1937, it progressively developed Australia’s largest trolley bus\n\nnetwork with 7 routes by 1953, some replacing trams.\n\nBut from the early 1950s, the MTT deficit increased, due to increasing costs and loss of patronage\n\nto private motor cars and the impact of reduced maintenance during the war years. Reducing the\n\ndeficit became, for the MTT, an all-consuming aim, becoming more important than efforts to prevent\n\npatronage losses. The remaining electric tramways, with the exception of the ‘inter-urban’ light rail line\n\nto Glenelg, were replaced by diesel buses by 1958. The SAR was going through a similar transition, with\n\nthe replacement of steam and a small number of older railcar services by modern diesel railcars.\n\nIn the 1960s and ’70s the suburban rail system was expanded, at the same time as some country railways\n\nand some suburban ‘industrial’ lines were being discontinued.\n\nThe mid 1970s saw a second takeover of private buses by the government, followed by the formation of\n\nthe State Transport Authority (STA) which unified the public transport network.\n\nIn the late 1970s pressure was increasing to provide some kind of higher speed public transport into the\n\ndeveloping north-eastern suburbs which lacked a rail line. By 1979 a light rail line was proposed but a\n\nchange of government resulted in the development of the very successful Adelaide O-Bahn, opened in\n\nstages in 1986 and 1989. This was the first dedicated busway established in Australia, and for some years\n\nwas the longest and fastest guided busway in the world.\n\nRailway electrification was first proposed in 1904 but not implemented until 2014, as the new diesel\n\nrailcars selected in the 1950–1990 period had been relatively efficient. Adelaide gained the dubious\n\nhonour of being the last mainland Australian capital to electrify its railways, and at the time of writing\n\nhad only partially implemented that electrification.\n\nIn 1994 the STA was replaced by the Passenger Transport Board (PTB) to undertake the progressive\n\ncompetitive tendering of public transport operation. By 2000 all bus services were privately operated,\n\nand by 2020 the remaining tram services were also privately operated, with proposals for the private\n\noperation of the trains.\n\nIn 2006 the remaining tramline – the light rail line – was modernised, commencing the second generation\n\ntramway system, with some extensions in 2007, 2010 and 2018.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the Adelaide public transport system, Adelaide Metro, was operating about 1040\n\nbuses, 136 railcars, and 24 trams, a total of 1200 vehicles. In 2017–18, there were 62 million passenger\n\njourneys, or 75 million boardings, on the Adelaide Metro public transport network.\n\nWhat is included in the book:\n\nIn summary, the work is divided as follows:\n\nPart 1: General History – 60 chapters, approximately chronological.\n\nPart 2: Routes and Services, most treated in ‘corridors’, with 36 chapters commencing with the railways\n\nand Glenelg tram, followed by radial and associated tram and bus routes in a clockwise fashion around\n\nthe city, then Inner Cross Suburban routes, then Special Events services, and a timeline of service\n\nchanges. These chapters have maps which show the historical development of the routes in the chapter.\n\nPart 3: The Fleet and Depots – 5 chapters.\n\nPart 4: Miscellaneous matters, including fares and ticketing, statistics, administration, and museums and\n\nhistorical societies – 4 chapters.\n\nPart 5: Conclusion – Lessons learnt\n\nAppendices: Authors’ biographies; Glossary; References & Abbreviations"
