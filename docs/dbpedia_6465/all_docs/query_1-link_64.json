The document summarizes Adelaide's 12-kilometer O-Bahn Guided Busway which opened in 1986 and was completed in 1989. The busway links downtown Adelaide with northeastern suburbs using standard and articulated buses that enter a 6.2-meter wide concrete track allowing automatic guidance at speeds up to 100 km/h, cutting travel time in half. Ridership has steadily increased since 1986 to about 30,000 daily passengers, and construction costs were approximately $100 million Australian dollars.",
