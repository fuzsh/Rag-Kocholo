There subsequently arose the necessity of transporting narrow-gauge locomotives and rolling stock over the broad-gauge to and from the workshops in Adelaide. Plans were drawn up for an Engine Carriage Bogie Truck, and the vehicle, which was given the number 19, was created by the Adelaide Locomotive Works in 1884. Of traditional Well Wagon pattern it was unusual in that, instead of normal bogies, the driving wheels and portions of the frames from two of the original locomotives were used. It is possible that they came from Nos.2 and 3, however no records have been found to support or disprove this supposition.\n\nWhen classification letters were allocated to rolling stock in 1888, No.19 was classified WL. At some time during its career it also acquired the nickname The Crocodile, which eventually gained official recognition. It found considerable employment, the conversion to broad-gauge of the old Western System during the 1920s notwithstanding. In 1931 Islington Works manufactured a similar vehicle, this time equipped with conventional bogies, which became WL.8200, and 19 was renumbered 8202. However, with the conversion to broad-gauge of the South Eastern System in the 1950s and the standardisation of the Port Pirie to Broken Hill line in the late 1960s, both vehicles were used less and less. No.8202 was condemned on 2nd May 1977 and broken up, one bogie going to the Mile End Railway Museum and the other to SteamRanger.\n\nNo.8200 survived complete and was used to transport several locomotives to the Museum before being placed in the collection on 22nd December 1988.\n\nBack to top\n\nBogie Refrigerator Car RBP9003\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nEntered service: 7/10/1933\n\nEntered the museum: 31st March 2004\n\nLength (over coupling points): 38’ 10’’ (11.84m)\n\nLoad Weight: 33 tons (33,000kg)\n\nNumber in class: 44\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways/Australian National\n\nTare Weight: 19t 12c (19,609kg)\n\nWithdrawn: 20 May 1980\n\nRB-class bogie refrigerator car No. 9003 was built at South Australian Railways’ Islington Workshops in 1933. It was transferred to the Barmera - Adelaide milk traffic on 6 July 1937. Fitting of high speed bogies on 2 October 1967 resulted in it being reclassed RRP9003, and it was later reclassed RBP9003 on 19th November 1971 when passenger car bogies were fitted (wagons 9002 - 9028 were built as RB-class, 9029 - 9044 as RBP-class).\n\nWagons 9002 - 9004 were built with a single door each side, but were later rebuilt with two. Under South Australian Railways ownership, they were painted Aluminium and Royal Blue, and equipped with SME brake gear for use behind 250-class railcars.\n\nNo. 9003 became Australian National Railway property during the sale the South Australian Railways’ country operations to the Commonwealth. On 28 February 1980 it was reclassified ARPY 9003 and condemned on 20 May 1980.\n\nSteamRanger (Australian Railway Historical Society SA Division) obtained the vehicle on 12 November 1986 and it was transferred to the National Railway Museum on 31 March 2004.\n\nBack to top\n\nCattle Van Cf26\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways; Australian National Railways\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways; Australian National\n\nCondition: Good\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nEntered service: January 1954\n\nEntered the museum: 26th January 1983\n\nNumber in class: 100\n\nTare Weight: 7 tons 15 cwt (7762 kilograms)\n\nLoad Weight: 9 head\n\nLength (over coupling points): 20’ 10’’ (6.35m)\n\nLike the Sf-class, the Cf-class was a 4-wheel version of larger bogie vans built in 1929. As with sheep the need arose for vehicles in which smaller numbers of animals could be shipped, and the first Cf van was placed in service in October 1953. The 100 vans of this class were unusual in that all wooden components were produced by the Islington Workshops while the steel underframes were manufactured by the Perry Engineering Co., Mile End. All passed into Australian National ownership in March 1978.\n\nNo.26 was condemned on 23rd November 1982 and passed to the Mile End Railway Museum on 24th January 1983.

Originally classed A, they were reclassed DA during the 1920s.\n\nNo. 4346 was the second last of the series, in May 1923, by the Perry Engineering Co., Mile End. In 1964 it was sent to Gillman Yard for use as a tool van, replacing N.251, until written off.

A year or so later it was rebuilt as a G-class Open Wagon, and ran as such until 1940 when it was again rebuilt; this time to a VZ-class Covered Van. Some time thereafter the Z was dropped and it ran as V.260 until reclassified ABGY by Australian National about 1980.

Originally horses and drays carried the explosives in magazines overland from Broad Creek. However, the construction of a 2 foot (609mm) Tramway in January 1906 brought this to an end.\n\nThis vehicle is one of a number that were pulled by horses on the Tramway from Dry Creek to a jetty at Broad Creek. This jetty was used for the loading of ketches in the North Arm of the Port Adelaide River, east of Torrens Island.\n\nBack to top\n\nFlat Car FB8500\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Very good\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nEntered service: 1927\n\nEntered the museum: 28th June 1988\n\nLength (over coupling points): 46’ (14.02m)\n\nTare Weight: 16 tonne (16,000kg)\n\nThe FB-class flat cars were built in the 1920s under the direction of Commissioner Webb for carrying general freight.

When this occurred the 4-wheel version was given the same classification as the bogie wagon but with the suffix ‘f’ added. The DW-class was a bogie Louvred Van and the DWf its 4-wheel counterpart. Built to carry produce which needed ventilation but not refrigeration, 550 were built by the Islington Workshops between December 1944 and February 1955.\n\nNo. 4724 was one of the first batch of 50 and was placed in service in January 1945. Most of the class survived to be taken into Australian National ownership in 1978 but, thereafter, they were condemned in large numbers. 4724 placed in the Mile End Railway Museum on 24th July 1986.

Wagons 5017 and 5019 belong to this type and were built at the Islington Workshops in November 1912.\n\nKnown as the Y-class these wagons were the final development of this type of wagon on the 3’ 6’’ gauge. Built for the Northern System, later the Peterborough Division, they were finally isolated on the Gladstone - Wilmington line with the opening of the standard-gauge line between Port Pirie and Broken Hill in January 1970.\n\n5019 was placed in the Mile End Railway Museum on 24th July 1986, but 5017 came under Australian National ownership on 1st March 1978 and was not obtained by the museum until 1988.\n\nThey were sent to the museum on 5th June 1987 and 11th November 1988 respectively.\n\nBack to top\n\nOpen Wagon YY4913\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nNarrow Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nEntered service: 1915\n\nEntered the museum: 1988\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nWithdrawn: 1988\n\nA four-wheel steel open wagon used extensively on the South Australian Railways narrow-gauge system.\n\nThe museum has No. 4913 built by the South Australia Railways at the Islington Workshops in 1915.\n\nBack to top\n\nOpen Wagon YY4947\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nNarrow Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nEntered service: 1913\n\nEntered the museum: 1988\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nWithdrawn: 1988\n\nA four-wheel steel open wagon used extensively on the South Australian Railways narrow-gauge system.\n\nThe Museum has No .4947 built by Gray Brothers of Port Adelaide, South Australia in 1915.\n\nBack to top\n\nSheep Van Sf160\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways; Australian National Railways\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways; Australian National\n\nCondition: Good\n\nEntered service: December 1952\n\nEntered the museum: 24th January 1983\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nNumber in class: 180\n\nTare Weight: 9 tons 6 cwt (9304 kilograms)\n\nLoad Weight: 80 sheep\n\nLength (over coupling points): 20’ 10’’ (6.35m)\n\nThis class of van is a 4-wheel version of the S-class bogie sheep vans which had been introduced in 1930.

Today’s hoppers are large vehicles carrying up to 100 tons (100,000kg) but, in 1913, when the Z-class were introduced, 16 tons (16,000kg) was an average load. Ninety-three were built between 1913 and 1916 and were primarily used for the carriage of coal. In later years they were used as ballast wagons, and this is how 3236 finished its days working for the State Transport Authority. After being held in storage at the Penfield sidings for some time it was acquired by the Mile End Railway Museum on 30th April 1983, and eventually moved to the museum on 5th June 1987.\n\nBuilt by James Martin & Co. of Gawler in 1916, No. 3236 is the only representative of the large number of goods wagons built by this company to be placed in the museum.\n\nBack to top\n\nSteel Louvred Van V1990\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nNarrow Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nEntered service: October 1899\n\nEntered the museum: 23rd September 1988.\n\nLength (over coupling points): 19’ 10’’ (6.05m)\n\nLoad Weight: 6 tons (6000kg)\n\nNumber in class: 60\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nTare Weight: 6 tons 13 cwt (6660kg)\n\nWithdrawn: 10th October 1979\n\nAt a time when covered freight vans had wholly wooden bodies and passenger cars had wooden framed bodies (although almost invariably on the South Australian Railways with protective steel sheathing panels), the narrow ‘V’ class louvre cars were unusual in having steel bodies, including louvres and doors. Concurrently with the construction of the first narrow gauge ‘W’ vans, similar but larger ‘A’ vans (later classified ‘DA’) were constructed. Utilising the same principles of construction for bodies, louvres and doors, the broad gauge ‘A’ vans were big brothers to the narrow gauge ‘V’ vans and the initial vehicles of both classes were described as being for the ‘carriage of dead rabbits’.\n\nConstructed to five separate orders, nine vans were constructed at Islington Workshops during 1899 and 1900, to be followed by 11 and 10 in two orders from Islington between 1906 and 1908. J. Martin and Co. Gawler, built a further 15 in 1911 and the final 15 followed in 1923 from the Perry Engineering Co., Gawler, giving a total of 60 vans. The first nine vans were placed in service on the northern and south-east narrow gauge systems, while in June 1916 the first ‘W’ van was transferred to the Eyre Peninsula lines. In 1921, the 45 vans then in service were distributed - 36 to the northern lines, eight in the south-east and one on Eyre Peninsula. By 1946 a total of 41 were in service on the Peterborough Division. With the broadening of the south-east lines, the 10 vans there were transferred to Port Lincoln in November 1952. During 1953 four Peterborough vans were fitted with internal padding for explosives traffic and classified ‘EFN’, later being reclassified ‘MFN’ when used as ordinary covered vans.\n\nNo. 1990 was one of the first ordered and was placed in service in October 1899 on the northern lines, where it spent all its working life. With the standardisation of the Port Pirie to Broken Hill line in 1970 and the isolation of the Quorn and Wilmington lines, V1990 was located on the Wilmington line. An early alteration was in 1905 when axles of larger capacity were provided and the pay load increased from the low figure of 4 tons to 6 tons, this still being less than the tare weight.

The Y-class became the standard broad-gauge open wagon on the South Australian Railways in the years before the Webb rehabilitation, 1262 having been built by various builders between 1909 and 1923. In later years the class became much diminished by rebuilding to other types and conversion to narrow-gauge, and the remainder were largely displaced by the OF-class introduced in the early 1950s.\n\nNo.3582 was built by Gray Bros. of Port Adelaide in 1913.

Many of the 1920s built ON wagons were rebuilt and strengthened in the mid-1950s. The ONs were used to convey lead/zinc ore concentrate from the mines at Broken Hill to Port Pirie. This traffic was progressively converted into larger, more modern wagons, using the standard gauge railway, culminating in ON929 being placed out of use in January 1970.\n\nIt is an example (the only one) of a typical wagon used to convey ore via narrow gauge between Broken Hill and Port Pirie for more than 50 years. It would have been hauled by many of the locomotives on display at the museum, of the Silverton Tramway Co Ltd.\n\nBack to top\n\nWater Tank Wagon 5506\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nNarrow Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nEntered service: July 1914\n\nEntered the museum: 1.9.1977\n\nLength (over coupling points): 17’ 9’’ (5.41 metres)\n\nOwnership: History Trust of South Australia\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nWithdrawn: 13th April 1977\n\nDrought is not an uncommon occurrence in South Australia and, in times past, it often became necessary for the Railways to transport water to badly affected areas. This required the building and maintaining of a large fleet of water tank cars to be held for such emergencies - Peterborough alone was once home for 120 such vehicles, which ranged in capacity from 1,200 to 3,000 gallons. However, exceptional circumstances sometimes required additional tanks and Temporary Travelling Tanks were sometimes fitted to the underframes of existing wagons. No. 5506 is in this category having been built as a Y-class open wagon, by J. S. Bagshaw & Co., in July 1914. The 2,000 gallon tank was fitted in March 1923.\n\nOriginally used on the Peterborough Division, No.5506 was sent to the South-East in January 1945, returning to Peterborough in January 1958. With the building of the standard-gauge line it was isolated on the Gladstone-Wilmington branch, where it remained until condemned on 13th April 1977.

Its low stock number can be attributed to the programme of ‘Wagon Renewal’ (newly constructed wagons taking the numbers of recently scrapped older vehicles) which was then a common practice.\n\nAt some time during its career it was sent to Gillman Yard, Port Adelaide for use as a tool van, thus surviving the remainder of the class. On its replacement with DA-class van No.4346 in 1964 it was offered to the Mile End Railway Museum and, along with P-class 2-4-0T locomotive No.117, became the first exhibit placed on site on 18th June 1964.

This practice ceased only in 1960s when the motor car provided a more convenient mode of transport in sparsely populated areas.\n\nThe 7550-class brake vans were the final development of this type of vehicle on the narrow-gauge Peterborough Division, four being built at the Islington Workshops in 1938. Besides the guard, comfortable accommodation was provided for nine passengers and the cars were regularly attached to goods trains to Broken Hill, Terowie, Quorn, Wilmington and Port Pirie.\n\nNo. 7553 was last used on the Wilmington line. Acquired by Australian National in March 1978 it saw little subsequent service and was laid aside. It was obtained by the Museum on 9th December 1987 and placed at the museum on 10th May 1988.\n\nBack to top\n\nBrake Van 4074\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nEntered service: 29.5.1919\n\nEntered the museum: 1.4.1995\n\nOwnership: History Trust of South Australia\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\n4074 was built in 1919 by the South Australian Railways as a composite brake van with accommodation for 20 second class passengers. It was one of 62 similar brake vans that were used at the rear of goods trains.\n\nPassenger compartments are located either end of the vehicle, with two bench seats in each compartment. Entry into each compartment is by an outward opening side-loading door, with no access to the goods area located between the passenger compartments. Luggage racks are provided above each seat.\n\nThe goods area is divided evenly by a central guard’s compartment fitted with an observation lookout.

The first brake van (8300) entered service in February 1947 and the last (8394) entered service December 1971.\n\nThe first order of 14 brake vans was built in 1947, being all steel with wooden doors. Two goods compartments are located either side of the central guard’s compartment, fitted with seat, desk, toilet and observation viewing ports. To one side of the guard’s compartment is a small passenger compartment.\n\nIn 1961 the South Australian Railways commenced building the remainder of the class numbered 8314 to 8394. The design was modified slightly, producing a narrower vehicle that could run in Victoria. The brake vans lack end communication doors, preventing their use on passenger trains. Brake vans 8364 to 8374 and 8393 to 8394 were built for standard gauge, with the rest being issued on broad gauge.\n\nBrake Van AVAP396 was built as number ‘8394’ but was recoded ‘AVAY396’ in 1983 to meet the new Australian wide classification of freight vehicles. It was later recoded ‘AVAP’ despite no modifications being made.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s it was allocated to the CME at Port Pirie until being written off on 19 November 1994.\n\nBack to top\n\nCafeteria Car C1\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways; Australian National Railways\n\nCondition: Good (not operational)\n\nEntered service: 1947\n\nEntered the museum: 28/6/1988\n\nNumber in class: 1\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nWithdrawn: 1984\n\nBuilt by the South Australian Railways at the Islington Works in 1947, the broad gauge Cafeteria Car was the first of a new generation of passenger vehicles introduced to the State. It spent most of its life on the ‘East West Express’ between Adelaide and Port Pirie enabling the elimination of the traditional refreshment stops. After a few years on hire to the Victorian Railways, it was withdrawn in 1984 and stored until purchased by the museum in very poor condition. A major refurbishment, costing many thousands of dollars, restored it to its authentic 1940s decor.\n\nBack to top\n\nCar 3\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nNarrow Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nEntered service: December 1877\n\nEntered the museum: 25.9.1969\n\nLength (over coupling points): 28’ 9’’ (8.763m)\n\nNumber in class: 8\n\nOwnership: History Trust of South Australia\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nSeating capacity: 32\n\nWithdrawn: 1966\n\nOf particular historic interest is the tiny four-wheeled carriage Number 3, which was built in December 1877, as the first of a series of four-wheel carriages for the then new narrow-gauge lines in the north of the State. Built at the Adelaide Locomotive Shops, Number 3 is only 28’ 9’’ (8.763m) long with axle centres a mere 11’ 6’’ (3.51m) apart. It only weighed 5 tons 15 cwt (5762kg) but was rated to carry 32 second class passengers on hard longitudinal seats. Other cars in the series that followed were numbered 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13.\n\nNumber 3 was issued new to the Port Pirie section of the narrow gauge line, and spent all its working life on the northern sections. After conversion to a departmental van, it was to be stationed for a long period at Quorn, and also used on the Great Northern line to Oodnadatta.\n\nThe bogie coaches came fairly soon afterwards, and short vehicles like this one were relegated to a secondary place on the main line. Thus it is not surprising to learn that by 1892 it was no longer purely a passenger car, but had also been provided with accommodation for Enginemen. By 1895 the records show that Number 3 had been equipped with sleeping accommodation but it is not known whether this was an additional modification, or whether it was part of the original change that allowed the carriage to take off-duty Enginemen.\n\nIn September 1911 the carriage was finally taken off the passenger list, leaving only four still in passenger service. However, the type was to live on for a while, for one of these remaining four was still to be in service well into the 1920s, as were a number of short brake vans for passenger trains. This was not to be the end of Number 3´s active life, though, as it was then converted for use as an employees’ sleeping van, and was reissued as Number 4884 in the goods rolling stock series. In this role it was to continue to see service until 1966, when at the grand old age of 89, it was finally withdrawn from all service.\n\nThis exhibit is the oldest in the Museum, and qualifies as the oldest carriage preserved in South Australia. The car has been beautifully restored by Museum Volunteers to its original layout.\n\nBack to top\n\nCentenary Baggage No. 376\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nEntered service: 29.8.1913\n\nEntered the museum: 19.10.1978\n\nLength (over coupling points): 55’ 5’’ (16.89 metres)\n\nNumber in class: 4\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nSeating capacity: 43 2nd class passengers\n\nWithdrawn: 29th May 1978\n\nContract CME. N8/1911 of the South Australian Railways covered the construction of 15 suburban passenger cars for use on the South Terrace line to Glenelg.\n\nNumbered 364 to 378 inclusive, the cars comprised five 1st class saloon cars, five 2nd class saloon cars, one 1st class baggage car and four 2nd class baggage cars, of which 376 was one. The underframes and bogies were constructed at Islington Workshops, and the bodies by A. Pengelley & Company, the 15 cars being placed in service between November 1912 and September 1913.\n\nThese 15 cars were a repeat order of 10 similar cars (No. 260 to 269 inclusive, placed in service in 1908 and 1909 on the Glenelg line), which it was stated were to be uniform in appearance with passenger cars taken over from the Glenelg Railway Company. The company cars were shorter in length but had the familiar clerestory roof, end loading steps to suit the ground level platforms and centre buffer couplers. The South Australian Railways cars had these features and incorporated hinged flaps over the end steps to suit high level platforms. No. 376 entered service on 29 August 1913.\n\nThe structure gauge of the Glenelg line permitted passenger cars of greater width than the remainder of the System and No.376 and the other cars had a body width of 10’ 6’’ (3.2 metres), with a maximum width over extremities of 10’ 10’’ (3.3 metres).\n\nThe Glenelg line cars were the basis for the numerous end and centre-loading suburban cars of which 130 (including baggage cars) were constructed. Of generally similar appearance to the Glenelg cars, the end and centre-loading cars were longer because of the centre vestibule, and their narrower body width, 10’ 0’’ (3.04 metres) gave them greater route availability. However, none of them were constructed originally with ground loading steps, and the standard screw couplings and buffers were fitted.\n\nAs issued, No.376 had seating for 56 second class passengers and in common with the other Glenelg cars was altered in 1927 when a lavatory was fitted for country working and standard screw couplings and buffers provided. Seating capacity was reduced to 52. Further alterations took place to No.376 in December 1935, when in a programme to improve the Glenelg cars for country running, high backed seats with baggage racks, automatic couplers and steel step down end steps were provided. The green and cream colour scheme for these cars followed the 1936 Centenary Train. The alterations reduced the seating capacity of No.376 to 43 2nd class passengers, while during 1952 the seating was advised as 19 first class passengers and 24 second class passengers, reverting to all second class again in May 1967.\n\nWhile saloon Glenelg cars ran to all points where locomotive-hauled passenger trains worked on broad gauge (both suburban and country), the baggage cars such as No.376 generally worked suburban and nearer country tracks (e.g. Victor Harbor and Angaston). However, for a number of years in their later life, Glenelg baggage cars were used in a regular Adelaide-Loxton service, while No.376 was one of the last Glenelg cars in service on Murray Bridge-Tailem Bend local trains until damaged by fire during September 1977, being condemned on 29th May 1978.\n\nBack to top\n\nCommissioner's Car - Murray\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways/Australian National Railways/State Transport Authority\n\nCondition: Good\n\nBuilt by: S.A.R.

The frame work is Tasmanian Blackwood and the internal panels are sliced Queensland Walnut. The car rides on two six-wheeled bogies imported from the U.S.A and weighs 52 tons. Sleeping accommodation is provided for 10 persons.\n\nWhen introduced, the actual cost had risen to $19,954. This additional cost was incurred by providing a fairly high grade of equipment, fitting up and finish to make ‘Murray’ suitable for use by HRH the Duke of Gloucester on his visit to Australia in 1934. Murray was also included in the Royal train for HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, when he travelled from Murray Bridge to Adelaide in March 1974. A passenger brake van (No. 391) was also fitted with a generator to provide auxiliary power for Murray In the last days of steam, engine 621 was the Commissioner’s Engine and used to haul Murray.\n\nThe car is fitted with a speed indicator. In 1972, Murray was altered to operate on standard-gauge for inspection trips between Peterborough, Port Pirie and Broken Hill. When the Murray car is attached to any train, the observation end must be trailing whenever practicable. When the observation end is not trailing, the curtains must be drawn round such end and secured.\n\nIt was retained by the South Australian State Transport Authority when the South Australian Railways were sold to the Commonwealth Government, and store in the Adelaide Rail Yards north car sheds. In 1987 it was transferred to Australian National, entering Islington on 10.9.1987 to be upgraded. This did not happen and it was transferred to Port Augusta in 1991 for storage. Following an application by the History Trust of South Australia, in 1997, it was transferred to Islington for conversion to broad-gauge in preparation for returning to South Australian Government control.\n\nOn 11.06.97 it was delivered to the Museum.\n\nBack to top\n\nDining Car DA52\n\nCommonwealth Railways\n\nStandard Gauge\n\nClass operators: Commonwealth Railways\n\nCondition: Good (after restoration)\n\nProvenance: Commonwealth Railways\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nBuilt by: C.R.

It featured the best menu and full silver service as the train carried its passengers between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie. To meet this high standard, the Workshops at Port Augusta constructed dining car DA52, which entered service on 21st July 1930.\n\nBy all Australian standards of the time, it was an impressive vehicle. It measured 76 foot 7 inch (23.42 m) in length, 10 foot 6 inch (3.19 m) in width and was 14 foot 6 inch (4.41 m) high. The Commonwealth Railways were at that time constructing the largest wooden passenger carriages in Australia. Its exterior was painted in a livery of chocolate and cream with a mustard roof.\n\nThe interior featured ornate timber panelling made from Queensland Black Bean and expensive fittings. Monogrammed china, polished silver and flower arrangements adorned each of the 12 twelve tables that seated a total of 48 passengers.\n\nTo make dining more comfortable in the hot desert summers, the carriage was fitted with full Carrier refrigerated air-conditioning in 1939.\n\nIn 1954 it was fully overhauled, fitted for head end power, and painted in maroon. At that time modern lighting and equipment replaced the original fittings. With the advent of more modern rolling stock in the 1960s and 1970s, the car was relegated to less important use, eventually being allocated for departmental use on the standard gauge accident train in 1981, until being placed in storage in 1987.\n\nIn 1995 it was donated by Australian National to the Railway Museum, arriving on broad gauge bogies on 20th December 1995.\n\nDuring 2001 it was fully restored and painted in Commonwealth Railways livery.\n\nBack to top\n\nDogbox 294\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nEntered service: 21/12/1910\n\nEntered the museum: 7/11/1966\n\nLength (over coupling points): 47’ 2’’ (14.38 metres)\n\nOwnership: History Trust of South Australia\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nSeating capacity: 50\n\nWithdrawn: 1966\n\nFor many years the typical broad-gauge carriages of the South Australian Railways were modelled on the compartment-type British carriage, with side doors to every compartment. These cars, which were very similar to cars that also ran in New South Wales and other states, were originally designed for the suburban services. However, in 1898 a variation was provided when the first lavatory-equipped car on the South Australian Railways was built.\n\nThese lavatory-equipped cars were popularly known as dogbox carriages, and consisted of a series of compartments with a pair of toilets between each pair of compartments. The earliest examples had prominent roof water tanks, but later carriages had the tanks built into the coaches themselves. These cars always had six compartments, but the width of the compartment varied according to the class. Consequently, the first class coaches were longer than the composites or the second class coaches.\n\nAbout 100 dogboxes were built between 1898 and 1922, and even until the end of the 1950s they were to be seen on country trains. Apart from the fact that most of the cars underwent class changes during their lives, there were only three major alterations to the type. In the 1940s most carriages had their screw couplings replaced by the then standard auto-coupling, and about the same time a number lost their gas lights in favour of electricity (although some retained gas lights for the whole of their lives.)\n\nThe second major change occurred during the Second World War when a number of the older cars had their lavatories removed and the seats rearranged to make them suitable for suburban service. At the same time certain cars had baggage compartments provided in the centre. The third and most drastic change occurred between 1950 and 1953 when 23 cars were rebuilt for country service as centre-aisle cars with ‘improved’ seating and with one end vestibule. Known as the 900 class, these cars were unpopular because of their narrow aisles and perpendicular seats.\n\n294 was issued to traffic as a second class carriage, but was altered to a composite in December 1920, and then back to second class in 1929. It was fitted with gas lighting in 1936 and auto-couplers in 1940. In 1956 the car was taken out of passenger service and sent to Tailem Bend for further service as a crew car on the Accident Train.\n\nAs a second class car, 294 seated 54 passengers, but during its brief spell as a composite the number was reduced to 50 (14 first class and 36 second class.)\n\nBack to top\n\nFirst Class Sleeping Car AR33\n\nCommonwealth Railways\n\nStandard Gauge\n\nClass operators: Commonwealth Railways\n\nCondition: Good (after basic restoration)\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: Commonwealth Railways\n\nBuilt by: CR Port Augusta Workshops\n\nEntered service: 28th April 1920\n\nEntered the museum: 29th November 1995\n\nAR33 was built in 1920 by the Commonwealth Railways for use on its standard gauge 4’ 8½\" (1435mm) Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie service.

After being on the last narrow gauge Ghan in 1980, it was converted back to standard gauge and allocated to the breakdown train at Alice Springs.\n\nBy 1990 it had become surplus to requirements and was placed in storage at Port Pirie, where unfortunately it was heavily vandalised. In 1995 it was offered to the Museum, being delivered by road on 29th November 1995.\n\nDuring 2001 it was fully restored and painted in Commonwealth Railways livery.\n\nBack to top\n\nLounge Car AFA93\n\nCommonwealth Railways\n\nStandard Gauge\n\nClass operators: Commonwealth Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nProvenance: Commonwealth Railways\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nBuilt by: Wegmann, Kassell, Germany\n\nNumber in class: 3\n\nEntered service: 15th November 1952\n\nWithdrawn: November 1980\n\nEntered the museum: 23rd January 1996\n\nLength (over coupling points): 75’ 2’’ (22.9 metres)\n\nThe introduction of two luxury train sets on the Commonwealth Railways in 1952 resulted in a marked increase in passenger travel on the Trans-Australian Railway (4 foot 8½ inch gauge - 1435mm). Each fully air-conditioned set was constructed by Messrs. Wegmann and Company, of Kassel in West Germany, and consisted of a round-end first-class sleeper-observation car, two first class sleeping cars, lounge car, dining car, second-class sleeper-lounge car, two second class sleeping cars and a combination brake and power van.\n\nThe gathering place for first class passengers was the lounge car. AFA93 is divided into three sections - smoking room, music room and ladies reading room. The panelling throughout was cut from the matched roots of elm trees, and scenes of various castles in the area in which the carriage was constructed are inlaid in various woods on the walls. The seats were upholstered in moquette, except for the smoking saloon which featured red leather. Externally the carriages had maroon sides banded with silver below the window line, a white roof and a black skirt below floor level. The letters C.R. on either side of an Australian coat of arms were attached to every carriage.\n\nIn 1964 AFA93 was transferred to narrow gauge (3 foot 6 inch gauge - 1067mm) for use on the Ghan until services ceased in 1980. Australian National then stored the carriage until it was donated to the Railway Museum in late 1995, arriving on site at the museum on 23rd February 1996.\n\nDuring 2001 it was fully restored and painted in Commonwealth Railways livery.\n\nBack to top\n\nPullman Dining Car - Adelaide\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways; State Transport Authority\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nOwnership: History Trust of South Australia\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nNumber in class: 1\n\nEntered service: 19th May 1928\n\nWithdrawn: 6th September 1988.\n\nEntered the museum: 6th September 1988\n\nLength (over coupling points): 82’ 4’’ (25.1 metres)\n\nTare Weight: 76 tons (76,000 kilograms)\n\nGeorge Pullman must be one the best known names in railway history, for it was he who developed the sleeping car and dining car to a point where they became the epitome of luxury travel. His Pullman Palace Car Company, founded in Chicago in 1867, provided luxury cars for American railroads and the rest of the world.\n\nHis first sleeping car, the Pioneer, was built for the Chicago & Alton Railroad in 1864 and its immediate success led to the setting up of the company.\n\nHis first dining car, the President, was built in 1867 for the Great Western Railway of Canada. Known as the Hotel Car, it was a sleeping car equipped with a kitchen and pantry, and portable tables which were set up for meals. The first complete dining car, the Delmonico was built for the Chicago & Alton Railroad in 1868.\n\nDining Car ‘Adelaide’ was ordered from the Pullman Company, along with the sleeping cars ‘Mt Lofty’ and ‘Macedon’ in 1926, for use on the Melbourne Express, and is a typical example of North American carriage building practices of the time. At 75 tons (75,000kg) it was found to be too heavy. Its inclusion in the train consist (then limited to 11 E-cars over the Mt Lofty Ranges) excluded the use of two standard cars and therefore proved uneconomical. It nevertheless saw service from time to time, and became a favourite on enthusiasts’ trains in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWhen Australian National took over South Australia’s country services in 1978, ‘Adelaide’ remained under the ownership of the State Transport Authority who leased it to the museum. It was placed in the museum on the 6th September 1988.\n\nBack to top\n\nSecond Class Car No. 144\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nNarrow Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nClass Builders: Adelaide Locomotive Workshops, S.A.R.

Although the narrow-gauge passenger cars ran in country areas for journeys occupying many hours duration, amenities provided were few. The original standard layout of these cars was access from each end of the cars with a solid partition dividing the car into two unequal areas. The larger compartments had another internal partition with a door to provide a smaller compartment in the centre of the car for ladies. For composite cars, the smaller area was the first class area.\n\nAmenities in the form of water and lavatories were provided in narrow gauge cars from 1885 (and ultimately almost all of the Short Toms were fitted), but construction continued for some time of cars without these features.\n\nNo. 144 was originally scheduled to be built as a second class car to the standard layout without lavatories and with the solid internal partition and central ladies compartment. A direction in February 1894 stated it was to be second class ‘opened throughout from end to end’, - i.e. it was built as it was known with no internal partitions and longitudinal seats.\n\nConstructed at Islington Workshops and issued on 18th December 1894 to the Western System of the narrow-gauge lines, No. 144 was built to replace No.10 passenger car when the latter was converted to an ambulance van and forwarded to Palmerston (Darwin) in 1890 in a programme providing ambulance vans on broad and narrow gauges.\n\nSpending all of its life on the northern narrow-gauge lines, No.144 had few alterations but was fitted with electric lights in July 1909 and air brakes at Quorn in August 1911. In the 1950s No.144 was used as a trailer for school children behind the Model 75 rail car between Booleroo Centre and Wilmington and as the car was detached and attached at Booleroo Centre every school day, a handbrake was fitted to it during 1958 while an internal partition was also provided.\n\nCondemned on the 19th March 1971 after the standardisation of the Port Pirie to Broken Hill line, No.144 was purchased by the South Australian Division of the Australian Railways Historical Society and made available for use on the Pichi Richi Railway. It was transferred to the Mile End Museum in 1982.\n\nThe car was extensively refurbished by the museum in early 1988, before spending several months on loan to Pichi Richi Railway at Quorn.\n\nBack to top\n\nSecond Class Sitting Car BE42\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nProvenance: V & SAR\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nBuilt by: S.A.R Islington Workshops\n\nEntered service: 29th October 1923\n\nCondemned: 16th October 1974\n\nEntered the museum: 16th April 1975\n\nLength (over coupling points): 73’ 8’’ (22.45m)\n\nBogie centres: 53’ 10’’ (16.4 metres)\n\nHeight: 13’ 8’’ (4.17 metres)\n\nWidth: 9’ 6’’ (2.9 metres)\n\nSeating capacity: 72\n\nIn the early 1900s a rolling stock programme was agreed upon between the Victorian and South Australian Railways to provide more modern and considerably larger passenger cars for use on the express trains between Adelaide and Melbourne, to replace the original jointly owned cars placed in service between 1886 and 1890.\n\nBetween 1906 and 1923 a total of 44 vehicles of matching design were constructed at both Newport and Islington Workshops. The complement comprised 14 first class sleeping cars, 10 first class sitting cars, 10 second class sitting cars, 6 brake vans, 2 mail sorting vans and 2 mail baggage vans. After the initial construction between 1906 and 1908 of 4 sleeping cars, 6 each first and second class sitting cars, 4 brake vans and the mail sorting and baggage vans, the 1907/1908 South Australian Railways Report stated, ‘The new express train, as a whole, so far as accommodation is concerned, forms one of the best in the Commonwealth, and is probably equal to any other train in the world’.\n\nSleeping cars and first class sitting cars were constructed at Newport Workshops, Victoria, as well as the mail sorting and baggage vans, while the second class sitting cars and brake vans were constructed at Islington Workshops, South Australia (except that the first two jointly owned brake vans were constructed at Newport and exchanged with two constructed at Islington, these latter two became Victorian vehicles).\n\nWhilst the sleeping cars were not numbered or classified, but named after rivers in Victoria and South Australia, the first and second class sitting cars and the brake vans were classified and numbered with similar vehicles which the Victorian Railways built for internal use in Victoria. The mail van classifications also followed the Victorian Railways’ principles. During 1910, the Victorian classification system was simplified and these latter classifications were carried by joint stock vehicles until they were condemned. The original and later classifications were:\n\nFirst class sitting cars – ‘AVE’ then ‘AE’\n\nSecond class sitting cars – ‘BVE’ then ‘BE’\n\nBrake vans – ‘DVE’ then ‘CE’\n\nMail baggage vans – ‘EEB’ then ‘D’\n\nMail sorting vans – ‘EES’ then ‘DS’ (later ‘D’ when mail sorting en route ceased)\n\nAlterations to the passenger carrying cars were few during their life, although the cars built between 1906 and 1908 originally had gas lighting while all cars and vans had underframe alterations for the fitting of automatic couplers in the mid-1930s. Also, for the 1936 Centenary of South Australia, the joint stock vehicles were painted green and yellow with black horizontal lining, this colour scheme being maintained until construction of the air-conditioned cars in 1949. The title ‘The Overland’ in chrome plate letters was affixed to the letter board on each side of the passenger carrying cars when the green colour scheme was introduced.\n\nBE42 is one of the later second class cars and was issued to traffic from Islington Workshops on 29th October 1923. It is one of two jointly owned passenger carrying cars which had steel protection panels affixed over the original tongue and groove timber exterior sheathing (the ‘Onkaparinga’ was the other car and the ‘CE´s’ and ‘D’ vans had partial sheathing).\n\nBack to top\n\nSleeping Car 112 - Baroota\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nNarrow Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nOwnership: History Trust of South Australia\n\nBuilt by: S.A.R.

Thus, it is not surprising that some of them were 70 years old when the main line to Broken Hill was finally converted in 1970 from narrow to standard gauge, causing the wholesale condemnation of large numbers of narrow gauge carriages.\n\nMost of these carriages followed the same body pattern - short, mansard type roofs over balcony style bodies. After the first few years when four wheelers were built, almost all had standard four wheel bogies. However, in 1888 it was proposed to build a series of six vehicles with six-wheeled bogies. The first three, 109, 110 and 111 were built as sleeping cars and issued to traffic in 1889 and 1890, but it was to be ten years before the other three saw the light of day. The next to be built was 112 in 1900, and this was completed as a sleeping car, while the last two cars, 113 and 114, were built as sitting up cars.\n\n112 varied from the earlier sleeping cars in the arrangement of the sleeping berths. In the earlier cars a longitudinal seat formed the lower berth, but in 112 two seats facing one another pulled down to form a lower berth in Pullman style. Eighteen first class passengers were carried in sleeping berths.\n\nOn 29th July 1907, Number 112, emerged from Islington in the guise of an observation car fitted with Stone´s electric light. She now carried either 14 sleeping or 18 day passengers, the end compartment having had its fixed seats removed and a table and four movable chairs fitted in their place. Also, the toilet, which had been in this compartment, was relocated in the adjoining compartment.\n\nIn 1913 a speed indicator clock and fan were fitted in this small saloon, and it is believed that the car was thereafter used as a Departmental car for the most part. On 6th June 1917, Number 112 was officially named Baroota.\n\nFor the remainder of its life Baroota was to retain its layout as an observation car, but having been replaced on the main line by the three new sleeping cars, Alberga, Nilpena and Coonatto, it was to see service in later years only as a standby sleeper or on special trains.\n\nThese twelve-wheel vehicles were to be the only such carriages to be built for use on the narrow gauge lines of South Australia, and spent all their lives on the Peterborough to Broken Hill main line.\n\nBack to top\n\nSleeping Car Allambi\n\nVictorian and South Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: Victorian and South Australian Railways/VLine/Victorian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nEntered service: 9.12.1949\n\nEntered the museum: 28.11.2008\n\nNumber in class: 10\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nSeating capacity: 20\n\nProvenance: V & SAR, VR, VLine\n\nBuilt by: South Australian Railways, Islington, SA\n\nWithdrawn: 1998\n\nOne of ten roomette Joint Stock sleeping cars used on The Overland service between Adelaide and Melbourne. This type of rolling stock was built progressively from 1949 to replace the wooden carriages. Each of the carriages was fully designed and constructed by the South Australian Railways. Exteriors were finished in maroon, with a fluted stainless steel panel on each side of the cars running above and below the window level. The roof and bogies were painted black.\n\nThis particular vehicle is one of a batch of four sleeping cars sold to the Victorian Railways in 1972, for use on ‘The Vinelander’ service between Melbourne and Mildura, after new more modern sleeping cars were constructed and given the same names. When ‘The Vinelander’ service ceased operation on the 12th September 1993, all four sleeping carriages where placed in long term storage.\n\nEarly in 2008, the museum became aware that the carriage might be surplus to future railway requirements. Contact was made with VicTrack who gave the museum a favourable response about making it available for the museum’s collection. VicTrack recommended to the Victorian Minister of Transport that the carriages be made available to the NRM for display. The State of Victoria donated the car, with the museum paying for its transportation from Melbourne to Adelaide. It arrived at the museum by road on 28th November 2008.\n\nMuch of the significance of each of the cars lies in its preservation in near original condition as a rare example of operating, design and construction practices no longer practiced in house by current rail passenger operators. There have been no major alterations to the appearance of the cars other than routine maintenance that has involved mechanical repairs, soft furnishing upgrades and repainting.\n\nBack to top\n\nSleeping Car Onkaparinga\n\nVictorian and South Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways/Victorian and South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways/Victorian & South Australian Railways\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nBuilt by: Victorian Railways Newport Workshop, Victoria\n\nNumber in class: 14\n\nEntered service: 16th June 1911\n\nCondemned: 19th October 1972\n\nEntered the museum: 6th June 1988\n\nLength (over coupling points): 75’ (22.86 metres)\n\nFourteen sleeping cars were built between 1906 and 1923 at the Victorian Railways Newport Workshops for use on the nightly express between Adelaide and Melbourne.\n\nThe first four cars were named Lodden, Glenelg, Finniss and Torrens, after rivers in the states of Victoria and South Australia. In 1911 Onkaparinga and Barwon were built, followed by Baderloo, Dargo, Pekina and Tambo in 1919. The last four cars, named Angas, Coliban, Acheron and Inman entered service in 1923.\n\nInternal layout comprised nine compartments, each with two fold up lateral sleeping berths, a folding wash basin and cloth hanging cupboards. A small smoking saloon at one end of the car was known as the Gentlemen’s lounge, and had four loose, leather covered, cane arm chairs and a fixed seat for three. Two compartments at the opposite end of the coach were reserved for ladies.\n\nFinished in style, the carved panelling, pressed metal ceiling, frosted glass and lamp pendants were all ornately decorated. A stylised waratah pattern was repeated throughout the design. Externally a row of bevelled mirrors, with an engraved star burst pattern, was placed above each window. The paint work was a red brown with elaborate outlining.\n\nBy 1936, the train had been named The Overland, so it was decided to paint the carriages dark green with a chrome ‘The Overland’ fitted above the centre windows. From 1943 repainting in standard Victorian Railways red began. Construction of modern steel rolling stock began in 1949 and resulted in the eventual withdrawal of the wooden carriages from The Overland. Onkaparinga was condemned in 1969 and sold with bogies, but missing most internal metal fittings to Marbury School, Aldgate. In 1988 it was donated to the Railway Museum.\n\nBack to top\n\nSteel Car No. 606\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways; Australian National Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nOwnership: History Trust of South Australia\n\nBuilt by: S.A.R Islington Workshops\n\nClass: 600\n\nNumber in class: 8\n\nNumber series: 600 - 607\n\nEntered service: 12th October 1937\n\nWithdrawn: 13th October 1981\n\nEntered the museum: 11th January 2001\n\nLength (over coupling points): 71’ 9’’ (21.87m)\n\nSeating capacity: 64\n\nDuring the 1930s, the South Australian Railways began an extensive program of upgrading passenger accommodation. Part of this program involved the construction of ‘all steel’ first and second class passenger carriages. The first of these new carriages entered service in 1936, painted in the new South Australian Railways colours of green and gold and classified as 500 and 600 class ‘main line corridor passenger cars’. Built completely at the Islington Workshops, each car measured 21.87m (71’ 9’’.) long and 2.89m (9’ 6’’) wide, with a height of 4.025m (13’ 2’’) above the rail.\n\nThe 4 first class cars were numbered 500-503 and had seating accommodation for 42 passengers in 7 compartments. The 8 second class cars were numbered 600-608 and accommodated 64 passengers in 8 compartments. Toilets and vestibules were located at each end, with all compartments leading off a full length side corridor. The interior of each car was fitted out with polished timber panelling and chrome fittings. First class compartments were also fitted with mirrors and arm rests between each seat. Each compartment had a single external window and twin wooden sliding doors fitted with large etched glass panels. All windows were originally designed to drop down into the body of the car, but later, due to maintenance problems, these were replaced by half drop windows.\n\nCar 606 was withdrawn from service in 1981 and sold to SteamRanger. It eventually became surplus to requirements and was sold to the museum in late 2000, arriving on site on 11.1.2001.

Bagshaw and Sons and entered service on 16th June 1919. It was altered little during its life, except for auto-couplers and through gangways being fitted in 1936.\n\nIt was allocated to SteamRanger in 1978.

A regular service to Moonta began in September 1955 and a month later a Bluebird replaced the regular engine-hauled train to Mount Gambier.\n\nAs additional cars were constructed, their sphere of operation was extended to Port Pirie in 1958, and Terowie and Gladstone in 1959. They also operated to Tailem Bend and Victor Harbor. Unfortunately they were not able to arrest the slow decline in country passenger numbers. Services to Morgan were the first to cease in 1965, followed by Moonta in 1969, Tailem Bend in 1981, Gladstone in 1982 and Victor Harbor in 1984.\n\nAfter the regular Mount Gambier and Broken Hill services were withdrawn on 31st December 1990 the only remaining operation was an intermittent special to Broken Hill which ceased on the 31st.\n\nBack to top\n\nBrill Railcar No. 8\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nDiesel\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nBuilt by: Brill Car Co, USA\n\nNumber in class: 12\n\nModel: 55 class\n\nEntered service: 9th June 1924\n\nWithdrawn: 1968\n\nEntered the museum: 22nd October 1968\n\nLength (over coupling points): 43’ 5’’ (13.23 metres)\n\nSeating capacity: 43\n\nTare Weight: Petrol: 12 tons 17 cwt (12,863 kilograms) - Diesel: 14 tons 9 cwt (14,457 kilograms)\n\nEarly in his career with the South Australian Railways, Commissioner Webb decreed that small country passenger trains should be replaced by passenger motors. The idea was not new; there had been the Caldwell Vale railcar that operated between Goolwa and Victor Harbor and a small railcar at Port Lincoln but the scale of the replacement was new.\n\nMr Webb did not just order one railcar as had been done before, but he initially ordered a fleet of 12 from the Indiana firm of Service Motors. These petrol railcars came direct from the maker’s order book in which they were listed as ‘Model 55’, the name by which they have been known ever since - to distinguish them from the later Model 75 (see Railcar 41). The earlier railcars were not forgotten in the numbering sequence, and the first of these cars was given the road number 4, the remainder of the class going to 15.\n\nThe first car to be delivered was painted in a special colour scheme of royal blue and lemon yellow. Others came in the more general colour scheme of lined chocolate. The maiden trip was to Willunga, during which run the car was stopped on the steep grade between Hallett Cove and Reynella, and then restarted to demonstrate to the notable passengers the efficiency of the railcar.\n\nDuring the 1930s the original 68 horsepower petrol engines were all removed and replaced by Gardiner 102 horsepower diesel engines, except for No. 7, which was given a Deutz 110 horsepower air-cooled diesel engine.\n\nThe cars were all built for the broad-gauge, but for a time Cars 4 and 10 were active on the narrow-gauge lines in the South East. During this period they were re-numbered 112 and 111 respectively. Generally, the class saw service on most broad-gauge branches, but were not popular because of their very rough riding. They were later relegated to suburban service, and their last years of service were spent providing the shuttle between Glanville and Semaphore, with occasional trips to the city.\n\nFor this service they invariably operated in pairs, using the small automatic couplers with which they had been fitted in 1934. Previously, they had been equipped with small tramway-type link and pin couplers.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the introduction of these small railcars paved the way for an immense change in the style of railway branch line operations in South Australia, and may even be said to have been the only way that some lines were able to be kept open for as long as they were. Their introduction marked the end of the country branch steam passenger train, and the beginning of a line of railcars that was to culminate in the luxurious air-conditioned Bluebird some 30 years later.\n\nBack to top\n\nBrill Railcar No. 41\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nDiesel\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nBuilt by: S.A.R.

Ultimately, the number series of the cars ranged from 30 to 59 on the broad gauge, with two number 44’s having been built, with the first being sold to the Victorian Railways; and 100 to 106 and 487 on the narrow gauge. A series of trailer cars was also built, being numbered in the 200 series on the broad gauge and in the 300 series on the narrow-gauge.\n\nThese rail cars and trailers were used mainly as intended on the branch lines, but were occasionally used on some main line services such as those to Port Pirie, and also on some off-peak suburban services. Regrettably, these cars were renowned for their rough riding qualities.\n\nAs built, these railcars seated 61, had petrol engines and a series of small windows similar to those of the 55-class. By the end of their lives, most had seen many changes. Six, including 41, were greatly changed in 1940 by the introduction of high-back semi-compartment type seating, which reduced the number of passengers to 34, and the replacement of the small windows by large main line type windows. These cars were promptly nicknamed the \"Milk Bar Cars\" because of the high-back seating.\n\nAll the railcars lost their petrol engines after 1957. Most received Gardiner 198 horsepower diesel engines in their stead, but 41 was one of three to be fitted with Cummins diesel engines. At the same time these railcars were fitted with remote control equipment to allow multiple unit operation.\n\nDuring the 1960s the cars were clearly near the end of their economic lives, and there were some plans made to replace them. However, instead of this happening, there were large-scale closures of country branch lines. This resulted in a need for fewer railcars and the more modern Bluebird air-conditioned cars were able to cope on their own. The last model 75 working was on the 13th October 1971, when 46 and Trailer 216 returned to Adelaide from Victor Harbor.\n\nThe preservation of 41 is thanks to the generosity of Mr. Graham Bettany who, in January 1973, gave the railcar into the care of the Museum. He had earlier purchased it from the South Australian Railways.\n\nBack to top\n\nBudd Railcar CB1\n\nAustralian National Railways\n\nStandard Gauge\n\nClass operators: Commonwealth Railways/Australian National Railways\n\nCondition: Very good\n\nProvenance: Commonwealth Railways & Australian National\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nBuilt by: The Budd Co., Philadelphia, Penn, USA\n\nNumber in class: 3\n\nModel: RDC-1\n\nEntered service: 6th March 1951\n\nWithdrawn: 31st December 1990\n\nEntered the museum: 7th August 1996\n\nLength (over coupling points): 85’ (25.908 metres)\n\nTotal Weight: 49.25 tons (50,038 kilograms)\n\nEngine type: GM 110 x 2 - 2 stroke\n\nCylinders: 6\n\nBore & stroke: 5\" x 5.6\" (127mm x 142mm)\n\nHorsepower: 275hp x 2 (205 kW x 2)\n\nWheel Arrangement: 1A-A1\n\nGear Ratio: 2.08:1\n\nTractive Effort (starting): 8,000 lbs (35.5 kW)\n\nTractive Effort (continuous): 2,000 lbs at 85 mph (8.9 kW)\n\nFuel capacity: 210 gallons (950 litres)\n\nMaximum Speed: 85 mph (136.7 km/h)\n\nAs part of its post war rehabilitation programme the Commonwealth Railways upgraded its short haul passenger services by introducing railcars on the runs between Port Pirie, Port Augusta, and Tarcoola. A contract for the delivery of three air-conditioned railcars was let to the Budd Company, Philadelphia, U.S.A. in October 1950. The railcars arrived in March 1951. They were the standard Budd RDC-1 design, and featured stainless steel bodies and air-conditioning. There were two compartments, with seating for 49 in one and 41 in the other. After entering service buffet facilities were fitted and seating improvements made, reducing the capacity to 70 passengers.\n\nRegular passenger services were introduced from May 1951 when the cars operated between Port Pirie Junction and Pimba. In 1952 the service was extended from Pimba along the military stores siding to the Woomera township. From July 1952 the cars made regular runs to Tarcoola, however this journey involved long stretches of unfenced track and damage was often caused through running down stock and kangaroos. The Budd car service to Tarcoola was discontinued on 25th January 1961, although the service was retained between Port Augusta and Woomera.\n\nCompletion of the new standard gauge line to Marree made it possible for Budd cars to work over that line, at first to Brachina, and ultimately to Marree.\n\nFollowing the opening of the Port Augusta to Whyalla line, Budd rail cars were also introduced on that service.\n\nAlterations in passenger traffic resulted in the cars being removed from service in 1976 and placed in storage until refurbished in 1985 for a new service between Adelaide and Whyalla. The Iron Triangle Limited ran its first regular trip on 21st April 1986. The Iron Triangle Limited was withdrawn from service on 31st December 1990.\n\nRailcar CB1 was donated to the museum by Australian National in 1996.\n\nBack to top\n\nJumbo Railcar Power Car 2006\n\nDepartment of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: State Transport Authority/TransAdelaide/Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nModel: 2000 Class\n\nBuilt by: Comeng\n\nNumber in class: 12\n\nNumber series: 2001 to 2012\n\nHeight: 4.27m\n\nLength (over coupling points): 25.5m\n\nWidth: 3.18m\n\nEngine type: 2x turbocharged Cummins six cylinder underfloor diesel engines\n\nHorsepower: 390 kW (520 horsepower) per engine\n\nTotal Weight: 68 tonnes (67 long tons; 75 short tons)\n\nEntered service: 17th November 1980\n\nMaximum Speed: 140 km/h (87 mph) (conservative) but limited to 90 km/h (56 mph) in service\n\nProvenance: DPTI\n\nSeating capacity: 64\n\nWithdrawn: August 2015\n\nCondemned: August 2015\n\nEntered the museum: 10th July 2016\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nThe 2000 - 2100 class are diesel hydraulic railcars and trailer cars that were built for the then State Transport Authority (STA) by Comeng, for use on the Adelaide metropolitan rail network. The 2000- 2100 class railcars were the first modern suburban railcars in South Australia, and the second in Australia to feature air conditioning, semi-automatic side doors and a PA address system. They were also the last diesel hydraulic type railcars built for a railway operating in South Australia.\n\nThe stainless steel body shell of the 2000 - 2100 class railcars was based on the American Budd SPV-2000, Metroliner and Amfleet car designs. The body shells were built by Comeng, in Granville New South Wales, and were railed to their Adelaide plant at Dry Creek for fitting out internally, except for prototype cars 2001 and 2101 which were completed in New South Wales.\n\nThe first power car (2001) entered service on the 22nd February 1980 and the last power car (2012) entered service on the 18th August 1981.\n\nThe class was dubbed ‘Supertrains’ by the media and the general public, but most railway staff and railway enthusiasts were quick to give them their more iconic nickname ‘Jumbos’. The 2000 - 2100 class railcars earnt this nickname due to their unique raised driving cab, which was very similar in principle to a Boeing 747 Jumbo aircraft.\n\nThe 12 2000 class power cars were originally built with two V12 MAN turbocharged diesel engines. These original diesel engines proved to be poor performers and were replaced by two Cummins turbocharged six cylinder diesel engines. The railcars were usually operated a two-car set (power car-trailer car) or three-car set (trailer car-power car-trailer car) configurations.\n\nIn the mid to late 2000s two 2000 class power cars (2003 and 2006) were refurbished internally and mechanically. From 2010 onwards a large percentage of the 2000 class power cars received the new Adelaide Metro Livery. In February 2014 the 2000 and 2100 railcars were no longer permitted to operate on the Belair and Seaford lines due to electrification of that part of the system. They were formally retired in August 2015. Two power cars and two trailers were preserved, with the remainder of the fleet being scrapped in June 2016.\n\n2000 class power car 2006 entered service on the 17th November 1980 and was withdrawn from service in 2015. During 2007 power car 2006 was refurbished inside and out, and was one of two power cars to be so treated. In June 2016 the Department for Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (DPTI) kindly donated cars 2006 and 2112 to the Museum.\n\nBack to top\n\nJumbo Railcar Trailer Car 2112\n\nDepartment of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: State Transport Authority/TransAdelaide/Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nModel: 2100 Class\n\nBuilt by: Comeng\n\nNumber in class: 18\n\nNumber series: 2101 to 2118\n\nHeight: 4.27m\n\nLength (over coupling points): 25.5m\n\nWidth: 3.18m\n\nTotal Weight: 42 tonnes (39 to 41 long tons; 44 to 46 short tons) empty\n\nEntered service: 17th November 1980\n\nMaximum Speed: 140 km/h (87 mph) (conservative) but limited to 90 km/h (56 mph) in service\n\nProvenance: DPTI\n\nSeating capacity: Passenger seating capacity: 98 (90 in 2112)\n\nWithdrawn: August 2015\n\nCondemned: August 2015\n\nEntered the museum: 10th July 2016\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nThe 2000 - 2100 class are diesel hydraulic railcars and trailers that were built for the then State Transport Authority (STA) by Comeng, for use on the Adelaide metropolitan rail network.
