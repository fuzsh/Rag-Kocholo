        "text": "A favourite theme of this blog is the lost opportunities – the Australian Railways that never were. This has taken several guises – the 1920s US Railroads we never had, despite the best efforts of William Webb and Harold Clapp. The 1950s Operation Phoenix we never really got. The rail tourism market Victoria should have explored. Even the High Speed Rail we should have now.\n\nThe biggie is the 1970s – as seen in these counterfactual explorations of Victorian Railways and the NSW Government Railways. This blog has also recently looked at the government of Neville Wran to explore in some detail the State Rail Authority we never got – and this commenced in the 1970s.\n\nRemarkably Dunstan was premier for almost the exact decade, 1970 to 1979, only to collapse on the floor of parliament in ill-health and have to resign on television from his hospital bed. His short-term successor as Premier called the election and lost it, showing what a dominant figure Dunstan had been over SA Labor and over the political landscape generally.\n\nThe 1970s hitting Adelaide hard\n\nIn South Australia the decade saw an interesting variant of what was beginning to emerge federally with Gough Whitlam. A transformational Labor government, one that is more remembered for its approach to culture, society and the arts, but today will be examined for its approach to rail transport.\n\nDon Dunstan was part Gough Whitlam and part John Cain. The former a visionary who brought social reform to the national agenda; the latter a social reformer, who achieved reform but without a singular vision. Both though, are remembered by rail fans mostly for not really delivering the goods on rail transport, though they showed early promise (see this post on John Cain).\n\nAnd as it was with Cain and Whitlam, sadly it can be said with Dunstan – a lost opportunity for rail.\n\nReaders are encouraged to read other sources on Dunstan as this blog post will not go into the ins and outs of SA politics or non-rail related stuff, except to mention how his presence, shaping SA arts and culture, has undoubtedly provided Adelaide in particular and SA in general with an interesting outlook on life, including resolving the economic issues that inevitably shape urban planning and rail.\n\nOne of not many men who aged better looking than when young\n\nBefore Dunstan\n\nIt is a fair comment to say the Adelaide in particular and SA in general as sometimes attracted comment and even scorn from other states, and some of it not entirely undeserved.\n\nMore than other states, Adelaide was set up to be the administrative capital of a state that would never have much more of an economy than agriculture, and in recent decades, mining.\n\nAustralia’s sedate state capital\n\nPost WWII the Federal Government recognised this and with long term conservative Premier Tom Playford set about industrialising Adelaide and the Upper Spencer Gulf.\n\nThere, at Port Augusta, following the playbook of the Victorians 30 years earlier, large power stations were built and power transmitted to Adelaide, from coal at the Leigh Creek deposit, on the railway from Port Augusta to Marree which replaced the Pichi Richi railway (now a tourist venture).\n\nSo one can imagine a highly stratified society in Adelaide – an old-world establishment getting rich off agriculture and mining; and a working class mostly in Adelaide’s northern suburbs. A similar split of course in rural areas – between miners and industrial workers in the Spencer Gulf and farmers elsewhere.\n\nDunstan scaring the horses with his very non-Adelaide attire including on public transport. The Advertiser\n\nThe emergence of the lawyer Donald Dunstan on the scene would be a profound challenge. A leader with patrician interests and demeanour leading a Labor Government – who would need to lift the living standards of a base whose core characteristics he didn’t share, while combating the resistance of a strong conservative (in every sense of the word) opposition, whose language he spoke.\n\nThe South Australian Railways\n\nA joy for enthusiasts, dozens of small industrial passenger rail services in addition to the main lines.\n\nBy 1970 the impact of William Webb was long gone – the system had reverted largely to type as an Australian rail system. In cropping and pastoral country the branchline network was extensive, while the arid zone had a few lines (mostly but not exclusively Commonwealth Railways).\n\nIn this respect the SAR had failed to follow the prescription of this blog – particularly this post on Dr Beeching and all that – and continuously look for productivity improvements of at least an order of magnitude each decade.\n\nNew lines had been built, to complete the Transcontinental east line and to commence a north south one. A line was under construction to Whyalla in the Spencer Gulf for steel trains (the city was already a major steelworks and had a small narrow gauge network for hauling iron on the narrow gauge). The future for the agricultural lines, however, looked bleak.\n\nPichi Richi railway\n\nAdelaide had quite an extensive passenger rail network. It had just lost the countrified branch to Willunga, which passed through some emerging suburbs in Adelaide’s south in 1968. This line, though, had not really served commuters, and was truncated at Hallett Cove, though a goods line to Port Stanvac would soon be activated for southern suburban passengers.\n\nMany lines ran limited industrial services – to Tonsley (the Chrysler plant), to Finsbury, to GMH Elizabeth, to Penfield (Defence industries), along the Port Adelaide-Dry Creek connector, to Port Dock, to Hendon, to Northfield and no doubt others. Other small lines, not necessarily industrial, ran to Semaphore (along the street) and Grange.\n\nThe main system encompassed Gawler, Outer Harbour, Hallett Cove, and Bridgewater (on the main line to Melbourne) though many trains only ran to Belair.\n\nThe railway had purchased a large number of ‘Red Hen’ self-propelled railcars for the suburbs, though some locomotive hauled trains had still been running.\n\nThe system from a map of 1977.\n\nCountry passengers had the delightful Bluebird air-conditioned self-propelled cars running a very extensive network into the agricultural zone, while the Spencer Gulf was served by a connecting train, using similar cars to the Melbourne Overland, that was loco-hauled.\n\nEarly Years – MATS and Whitlam\n\nIn the time of his predecessor, Steele Hall, the South Australian Government had come up with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study or MATS.\n\nReally a freeway plan (as readers will recall with Wilbur Smith in Brisbane and many other such plans of the time), nonetheless the plan proposed it proposed converting the rail system into an electrified middle distance system, possibly something like BART or what Perth’s system became, but with an underground city centre section, then using part of the Glenelg tramway (which would otherwise be closed) and then joining the Hallett Cove/future Noarlunga/Seaford line.\n\nNeedless to say it was not built as outlined, in fact relatively little of it was (most of these plans lingered on in other Australian cities but their projects rolled out over decades rather than years).\n\nDunstan became Premier in 1970 and MATS was not proceeded with. If, as is characterised about him, he was the walking image of the cosmopolitan, international cogniscento, it would be no surprise that he, and the better educated or better off Adelaidians, wanted nothing to do with a plan for massive freeways everywhere. In that respect he was the man of the moment.\n\nBy The Q915 (talk) – self-made, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16083718\n\nThat said, while MATS looks like one of those freeway-plan-in-disguise things, one wonders how much better off Adelaide might have been had a modern rapid transit system along BART lines had eventuated. That might have been one of the many shots-in-the-arm that South Australia really needed.\n\nDiversion Time: Whitlam and the New Cities\n\nWhitlam had initiated a National Urban Growth Centres program to decentralise away from the major capitals, and early thinking, which Dunstan had done even before Whitlam, was to consider the South Australian town of Monarto to be built near Murray Bridge.\n\nThis was interesting from today’s point of view as it presupposed:\n\nthat Adelaide was somehow ‘full’ – which it may have appeared from an Adelaide point of view, but for those readers in much larger cities might appear odd;\n\nthat a city only 50kms away from Adelaide would address this;\n\nand from the rail advocate’s point of view…that it would be poorly served by rail (but not by the South Eastern Freeway then under construction);\n\nEven responding to Dunstan’s own sentiments, it is hard for the rational person, versed in enough knowledge of urban planning and transport to respond, to believe that Adelaide was full or would get full in the foreseeable future.\n\nFrom a rail point of view, Adelaide was not even contiguous with the previous satellite town of Elizabeth, let alone Gawler on the edge of the Barossa Valley.\n\nMonarto did become a new city, but the inhabitants weren’t human\n\nPerhaps trains to Gawler might have been regarded, in Sydney parlance, as ‘interurban’ not that the distinction would really matter, as there was plenty of capacity with longer, more frequent trains and ultimately electric.\n\nEither way, Adelaide had plenty of room to expand within its existing corridors by anyone’s standard.\n\nA rail advocate might have suggested a new town, if one was to be built, in a location far enough from Adelaide to be worth doing, and where a fast rail link to Adelaide could be inexpensively built. South Australia suffers the disadvantage that the nicest land is in the hills, where transport is difficult, and the flat areas are generally dry and dull.\n\nBesides Monarto, Whitlam had in mind cities in the Bathurst-Blayney-Orange area (to be called “Vittoria”), building up the existing Albury-Wodonga, as well as north of Perth, Monarto and the area south of Campbelltown.\n\nAnd let’s not forget that Canberra, as a modern creation, was also part of this vision.\n\nAs much as this blog has argued that Adelaide had no real need of supplementation by a new city nearby, this was probably true for all the cities bar Sydney.\n\nSo what drove Whitlam in this respect? Whitlam like Dunstan was a Social Democrat in a Labor Party (there is a big distinction between Social Democracy and Laborism).\n\nOne suspects new cities would be the template on which to enact new social and economic policies, as well as to improve the quality of life of the vast middle class.\n\nWhitlam would also have seen the existing cities as captive to their state governments and the business lobbies of their dominant industries.\n\nCanberra had been relatively free of much of this, with the public sector the dominant employer, and most of the population middle class and not working in industries. The land was all owned by the Federal Government which gave Whitlam the possibility of a ‘playpen’ to test out his Social-Democratic vision and the new cities would extend that to the states.\n\nWhitlam’s fantasy new city, Vittoria, in between Bathurst and Orange. 1975\n\nIt is unlikely the states, even Dunstan, were playing fair in the new cities project, even ignoring the chaos of the Whitlam Government. Most were just wanting Federal assistance to develop growth corridors they were going to develop anyway, like Campbelltown or Joondalup. Remote sites like Bathurst or even Albury-Wodonga (which probably had the best prospects) were just not supported by states.\n\nThe other major issue is that Whitlam’s social democratic vision would have had public sector employers as the major drivers. Between the likes of PMG/Telecom (later Telstra), Defence industries, Commonwealth quangos like CSIRO and so on, he might have pulled it off during his time. However, by the time of Hawke and Keating, much of the economy had been privatised, and without federal financial subsidies nobody would be moving.\n\nHawke and Keating privatised businesses like Qantas, making the state sector considerably smaller and taking away the Whitlam fantasy of state directed control of the economy.\n\nDemographers and some urban planners might also have asked the question – what would such a project have going for it that it could counteract the Australian, and worldwide, drift from the country to cities. People, despite the hazards of moving, relocate to where they believe they have the best chances, and unfortunately that has been the big cities. Untangling that would be a far larger task than simply building new, but potentially empty cities.\n\nThis vision though, has never really died.\n\nPerth already, through its planning commission, had the ability to steer urban development to its north and south, and the concentrated landholdings of Wanneroo meant that the Whitlamesque vision of subdivided land, fast railways, freeway and local schools and shops has largely come true.\n\nPlanned new cities like Canberra were to Whitlam’s taste and vision\n\nAlbury Wodonga has pressed on trying to be a city of nearly 100,000 rather than its constituent parts though, as this blog has been critical of, it sometimes falls short. For example, wanting a new station at Wodonga but not all trains stopping there (ie, NSW trains) or having two intermodal facilities at Logic/Barnawatha and Ettamogah.\n\nIt is sad, in some ways, that Whitlam (and Dunstan) never got to building new cities that might have provided that template for a new way of life, Whitlam because his government was ended, but in Dunstan’s case because even he could see it just wasn’t needed.\n\nAustralian National and the State Transport Authority\n\nReally the only legacy of Whitlam’s time was the creation of Australian National Railways (later AN) from the combination of the Commonwealth Railways, South Australian Railways (outside Adelaide) and the Tasmanian Railways.\n\nBy the time the ink on the paper was dry, Whitlam was gone, but the aim had been to consolidate all non-metropolitan railways in Australia into one. The other states would not swallow it. Despite the complaints about deficits and the failure to stop the drift to road transport, the other states had seen the political leverage given by rail, even if it was just passenger transport.\n\nThe SAR by then really was a hollowed out shell. Some of that had to do with the decades of poor decision making since Webb, but some of it was due, at the most basic level, to the indifferent growth prospects for SA.\n\nThe agricultural market was mature, and some of the lines were carrying uneconomically low loads over short distances. While South Australia had good mining loads to carry by rail, including the loadings from Leigh Creek, Broken Hill, around Whyalla and elsewhere, some of these were either Commonwealth Railways or private ventures.\n\nThe network taken over by Australian National. Practically all of it has now closed besides the main lines to Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Darwin.\n\nIt is hard to think about anything remarkable about the technology employed in SA by 1975. They had not yet embarked on some of the game changing improvements that were to be employed by AN, and some of which had stemmed from Commonwealth Railways.\n\nMost of these took place after Dunstan, but they included:\n\nconcrete sleepering\n\nlong passing loops\n\nremote control and non-labour-intensive safeworking\n\nbig heavy locos\n\nmore traffic on flatcars, including trailers on flatcars, and experiments with road-railer trailers\n\ndouble stacked containers\n\nOf course for the workforce, it meant massive job losses, and vast numbers of branchlines being closed (though again, many of these occurred after Dunstan’s term).\n\nWith job losses in other heavy industry due to rapid industrial change; lower tariffs under Whitlam and frequent recessions, the number of working class people without jobs, the Labor base, would begin to undermine Dunstan’s vision. Possibly more so in SA than anywhere, as there was not a lot else happening. Not like in Sydney and Melbourne, which had significant money to be made in local finance and property development.\n\nGMH Elizabeth in the 1970s\n\nOne thing that did get off the ground was standardisation of the connection to the interstate network – started in Dunstan’s time – and the line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. Whitlam had not wanted to make these massive cash injections without a commitment to AN.\n\nIn Adelaide the State Transport Authority had been set up to integrate trains, tram and buses. This was possibly the first recognition that trains were no longer a preeminent mode of urban transport, and that integrating them was not just good for the passenger, but administrative reality for a small operation.\n\nWith MATS dead and buried, people had been expecting to see some sort of replacement for the last of the wooden cars that we being sandwiched between Red Hens or loco-hauled.\n\nVery late in Dunstan’s term, the government ordered what became the 2000 class, and had they arrived sooner they would have been the first of the new generation of suburban passenger car.\n\nPhoto:Daniel Nankivell\n\nThe car that arrived had a body indirectly from the great railcar builder Budd, but not one inspired by the RDC of the 1950s or the loco-hauled cars of the same era. Instead, this car drew inspiration from the Penn Central Metroliner (electric multiple unit), and after that the Amtrak Amfleet (loco-hauled) stock. This distinctive look was a rounded body side with relatively small windows.\n\nThe other distinctive feature that marked these cars – the elevated pod for the driver to drive from – gave the cars their nickname ‘Jumbo’.\n\nThese cars were notorious for their fuel consumption and lack of power on hills – which saw them taken off Belair services after a while. However they marked a new standard of Australian comfort for suburban journeys, following just on the heels of the QR EMU and in just before the Vicrail Comeng.\n\nNot enough were ordered to see the end of the Red Hens – that had to wait until a few generations of 3000 cars that followed in the 1980s.\n\nNoarlunga\n\nSince the loss of the Willunga line and the likely loss of industrial services (with deindustrialisation) there was one bright spot on the heavy rail network and that was the extension, in stages, of the Hallett Cove line to Noarlunga Centre (the suburb) via the Noarlunga line. It is important to distinguish this line and station because the Noarlunga name covers a wide area and the Willunga line had a station so named.\n\nWhile this suburb was actually some distance from Adelaide, it was also a seaside suburb and that influenced the popularity of this corridor.\n\nIt was the first new construction in many decades and comprised:\n\na short extension from Hallett Cove to Hallett Cove beach – for passengers\n\nThe extension to the Port Stanvac Oil Refinery – for freight\n\nThen onwards to Christie Downs (1975) and Noarlunga (1978)\n\nChris Carpenter photo – Port Stanvac oil train on new line from Hallett Cove\n\nThe line, like others foreshadowed in MATS, was to have been electrified, but at least by the end of Dunstan’s term the new Noarlunga railway and air-conditioned 2000 class cars marked a turning point – that it wasn’t all going to be abandoned and ripped up, and the move towards freeways had, for a time, been arrested.\n\n1970s investement, new line and new modern trains\n\nGlenelg to Modbury Light Rail\n\nWhat could have been the piece de resistance of the Dunstan era would have been his proposed Light Rail from the existing Glenelg Tramway, through the city and out along the Torrens Valley (really a creek) to Modbury in the north east of Adelaide.\n\nReaders should remember this is well before the wave of light rail systems that swept the world. Europe had not lost its enthusiasm for trams but in North America, the great waves of streetcars and interurbans was by now all but a memory, though the first mermerings of interest from cities like Sacramento and San Diego were starting to manifest.\n\nThe Glenelg to City line was, in some respects, the closest Australia came to the US Interurban, complete with the US Style H cars that were noticeably larger than Australian tram cars and the operation had the hallmarks of US Interurban.\n\nAdelaide above, Los Angeles below. Glenelg had a very American Interurban style of operation\n\nDunstan would, in this plan, bring the Glenelg line into the 1970s and build a new line to Modbury. Note the difference from MATS – which would have closed part of the Glenelg line, converted some to heavy rail, and had a separate heavy rail line to Modbury. In this blog’s estimation that would have been overkill and the Dunstan plan was more realistic for Adelaide.\n\nBut it was not to be. While there would have been a general indifference to the future of Glenelg, the Modbury line was a political explosive when it came to animating the Liberal opposition including the transport spokesman. Feigned concern for the river valley ecology, and the usual NIMBYism regarding the trams on the city streets (but somehow buses are OK) meant Dunstan would have needed to stay in office to see it past this opposition.\n\nWhen Dunstan left office in an untimely fashion. and his successor lost the election, it was over.\n\nThis was the revenge of gentile Adelaide on Dunstan – the Adelaide of no-change, no-development, nothing modern. It had killed MATS and its freeways but would also kill rail projects. The feigned concern for the river valley was not enough to stop its successor, the O-Bahn, from being built also with ugly tracks, though that is something for future posts.\n\nThe re-development of Light Rail did ultimately come to Adelaide, but long after Dunstan.\n\nComment on the Dunstan Period\n\nSocial progressives and liberals found the Dunstan period, as with Whitlam, an exciting time where much of the old Adelaide and South Australia could be thrown off.\n\nFor rail fans though, it was probably better described as the chrysalis, the point where the caterpillar of many years could turn into either a butterfly or moth, and we don’t yet know which.\n\nDunstan’s period also marks not just the lost opportunity of his own time, but also how Adelaide and South Australia have struggled for relevance.\n\nPlayford, for good or ill, may have envisaged an industrialised Adelaide and South Australia to get it off total dependence on agriculture and mining but the results were mixed. The industries planted there were never in a position to survive without state support, either through subsidies or tariffs.\n\nDunstan’s vision was already a more sedate, artistic but modern view, the Athens of the South, to complement Colonel Light’s original vision for Adelaide.\n\nDon Dunstan and Adelaide in the 1970s.\n\nHis vision for Glenelg to Modbury rail, had it gone ahead and then been extended to the rest of the system, might have also produced a Portland, Oregon, even before it was a thing. However he started to articulate this vision far too late in his government, despite the need to react to MATS and produce a workable alternative.\n\nThough the 1970s chaos did tend to chasten the politicians of the 1980s and later (some of whom were advisers in that period) so the grandiosity of 1970s visions tended to be tempered, it is not as if the SA ALP ever really forgot some of this. Echos of Dunstan are visible in Adelaide today, even in transport.\n\nALP successors like Mike Rann may have had a recognisable echo of the Dunstan years, without the flamboyance of Dunstan.\n\nIt is not clear to this blog whether just about the entire SAR was to be shut down, ultimately, because that was inevitable or because of the decisions of Dunstan’s successors. There is no evidence he saw the world this way – but transferring to AN may have just been a vehicle for getting others to take responsibility for it.\n\nAdelaide today has a partly electrified, partly diesel heavy rail system, some light rail, but definitely an unfinished project, started under Don Dunstan.\n\nVision yet to be realised – maybe soon\n\nIt may have been better if Adelaide had received a BART, clear, shiny, 1970s new trains on new lines. It is, in some ways, the direction Perth ultimately went and that was a success. BART lines including a city underground really would have been that wakeup call that the city never ever seemed to get.\n\nBut Perth had other engines for economic growth, including a vastly larger mining revenue. Adelaide may have been better off with the sedate, Adelaide, Dunstan, Light Rail. This blog will post at some point a plan for Adelaide Light and Heavy Rail.\n\nTramway Museum photo"
