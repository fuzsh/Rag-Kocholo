P.F. Conlon, Minister for Transport, Minister for Infrastructure, Minister for Energy.\n\nDepartmental Advisers:\n\nMr J. Hallion, Chief Executive, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMr R. Hook, Deputy Chief Executive, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMr B. Stobbe, Chief Executive, TransAdelaide, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMr M. Palm, Manager, Budget & Investment Strategy, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMr J. Tepohe, Chief Financial Officer, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMr R. Richards, Director, Sustainable Transport Policy, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMs H. Haselgrove, Acting Executive Director, Public Transport, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMr S. Matters, Executive Manager, Corporate Services, TransAdelaide, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nThe CHAIR: The estimates committees are a relatively informal procedure and, as such, there is no need to stand to ask or answer questions. The committee will determine an approximate time for consideration of proposed payments to facilitate the changeover of departmental advisers. I ask the minister and the lead speaker for the opposition whether an agreement has been reached on the timetable for today's proceedings.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes.\n\nThe CHAIR: I have a copy of that. Changes to committee membership will be notified as they occur. Members should ensure that the chair is provided with a completed request to discharge form. If the minister undertakes to supply information at a later date, it must be submitted to the committee secretary by no later than Friday 17 July 2009. This year, the Hansard supplement containing all estimate committee responses will be published on 2 October 2009.\n\nI propose to allow both the minister and the lead speaker for the opposition to make an opening statement. I will allow up to 10 minutes each. There will be a flexible approach to giving the call for asking questions based on approximately three questions per member. Supplementary questions will be the exception rather than the rule. A member who is not part of the committee may, at the discretion of the chair, ask a question. All questions must be based on lines of expenditure in the budget papers and must be identified or referenced, and they must be addressed to the minister. The minister may seek assistance from officers, but all questions must be directed through me to the minister.\n\nIf members are unable to complete any questions during the proceedings, they may submit them as questions on notice for inclusion in the assembly Notice Paper. I remind members that there is no formal facility for the tabling of documents before the committee. However, documents can be supplied to the chair for distribution to the committee. The incorporation of material in Hansard is permitted on the same basis as applies in the house; that is, it is purely statistical and limited to one page in length.\n\nI also advise that, for the purposes of the committee, television filming will be allowed from both the northern and southern galleries. I declare the proposed payments open for examination and refer members to Portfolio Statement, Volume 1, Part 6. I now call on the minister to make an opening statement, if he so wishes. Do you wish to make an opening statement?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I don't think so.\n\nThe CHAIR: Dr McFetridge, do you wish to make an opening statement? I will allow up to 10 minutes.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I just want to make more of an announcement rather than a statement: that Harry McFetridge was born yesterday morning and I wish him safe travel through this journey of life.\n\nThe CHAIR: I will now transfer the rights to the usual opening batsman, and that is the lead speaker for the opposition. Proceed with your questions, Dr McFetridge.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.31, sub-program 4.2, Passenger Services. Can the minister provide me with a breakdown of the $22.6 million increase in expenditure between the 2008-09 and 2009-10 budgets for free public transport during off-peak periods for seniors; increased bus contract obligations; additional bus and tram services; increased funding to TransAdelaide; and other various public transport related initiatives that contribute to the increased expenditure?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I suspect I will not be able to give you that information on the spot. The free public transport to seniors is, from memory, about $10 million a year. Honestly, I think we will probably have to take that on notice. I do not think anyone here could break it up. The free public transport figure is an estimate, because it has never been done before. We estimate that it will cost about $10 million a year. I think it will be money extremely well spent, and it has been extremely well received. I know that Tony Piccolo was a great champion for this idea. In fact, I think it is safe to say that it was Tony's idea to give free public transport to seniors; he was a very strong advocate. We estimate that aspect of it to be $10 million per year, but it will come down to just how popular it is. I suspect that it will be very popular. The rest of it we will take on notice; I think that is the best that we can do.\n\nMr VENNING: Can I ask a supplementary question relating to that?\n\nThe CHAIR: If it is a supplementary question.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes; if you get a seniors card—we are happy to accept that you do not work more than two days a week.\n\nMr VENNING: Is the free off-peak public transport available to country travellers? I know that the government subsidises some country services.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: It is available to everyone in South Australia who has a seniors card. I think you qualified for that about 30 years ago, Ivan. It applies to every South Australian. In fact, as I understand it, anyone coming from interstate is eligible for a seniors card.\n\nMr VENNING: In the country regions themselves?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: You do not get it where there is no public transport. In regard to the earlier question about the breakdown of the increased funding, $700,000 per annum of that is for increased inspection and maintenance on the TransAdelaide system; $620,000 per annum is for increased security and graffiti removal—and I can tell you that it is a very important initiative—and $2 million in 2009-10 for operational support for public transport rail services; and $300,000 for an extension of peri-urban services.\n\nMr VENNING: I have a supplementary question. The government subsidises some of the country services provided by private operators. Are seniors using those services able to avail themselves of this privilege, because you do subsidise the services, anyway?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No. I think I am correct in saying that we do not actually subsidise regional services. What we do is pay for the concession holders using that service. We are limited, but it is too difficult to apply this to those regional services. To make the point, I would say that, whenever one of your constituents comes down from Gawler to Adelaide, they are entitled to a service. Every South Australian who holds a seniors card is entitled to a service in the metropolitan area, but it is simply too difficult to arrange it with the many various providers in the regional areas.\n\nMr VENNING: Is there any chance—\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! Does the minister want to respond further?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I have just been told that Ivan will be on the frontbench soon, which I think is marvellous; I am looking forward to it.\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! There have been three questions from the opposition.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I understand the member for Schubert's enthusiasm; he is doing the best for his constituents. I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.29. How much has been budgeted in total for 2008-09 and 2009-10 as part of the operating expenditure for bus substitute services for the Belair, Gawler and Noarlunga line rail upgrades?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I will have to get that information for you later.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, pages 6.69 and 6.70, in relation to the Bombardier maintenance contract. What will be the financial impact on the Bombardier maintenance contract if the new trains are of a type not currently worked on by Bombardier? Likewise, what will be the effect on the maintenance contracts when the new Alstom trams arrive?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: It will have no effect at all on the Bombardier maintenance of trams contract.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: In relation to the trains, is it too early to know as yet?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: In terms of the trains, we have not yet made a purchase decision. I think we will be buying about 50 new trains in 2013-14. So, I will not be able to give any detail until we make a decision about what will be purchased. In short, the current purchases have no effect at all on the current Bombardier contract. As I understand it, that contract was written by a much better minister than me. Madam chair did that years ago, and it is a very good contract. Really, I think we should pause to reflect and congratulate the chair on what a good job she did.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Will the government be entering into another contract with Alstom, then, to maintain the Alstom trams?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: The bulk of tram maintenance is done in-house. We have government employees who do that. Something we tend to like, which the Liberals tend not to like, is having government employees. As I understand it, the bulk of that maintenance is done in-house. Of course, the new trams will be under warranty. The trams are slightly second-hand (I think one of them has done about two-weeks' service), but they come with a new tram warranty. If any work were to be required pursuant to the warranty, we would expect the manufacturer to take responsibility for that. However, ordinary maintenance is predominantly done by government employees.\n\nI point out that one of the arrangements we will be entering into, as a result of the new trams, is an arrangement with Yarra Trams in Victoria. We are very happy to have a very large company like that involved with us here in South Australia. We think it is a net addition to our capacity to run the system. However, most maintenance is done in-house.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Will the training of the drivers for the new trams have much of a financial impact?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: The cost of the training for the drivers is included in the overall cost of the purchase of the trams, which is something I do not think the media fully understand yet.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.59, relating to fuel diesel supply. How many days' strategic fuel supply does the government have for trains and bus operations?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Well done Duncan, that is one I don't think we have in the briefing papers. I am told five to seven days.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Is that biodiesel or fuel diesel?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No, I think we run buses on about 10 per cent and we are trying to get higher and are running trials, but it is diesel—diesel, I think.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: As a supplementary, I have correspondence from the federal environment minister, Peter Garrett, who is questioning the availability of E85 fuels in South Australia and you may need to take that up with him, particularly with our encouraging the motor vehicle industry to produce E85 capable cars. I refer to Budget Paper 3, page 2.15: have speed limits been reduced on the O-Bahn and, if so, why and does this apply to all buses on the O-Bahn, and what will be the effect, if any, on time-tabling?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I am certain the short answer is no, that there have been no speed restrictions on the O-Bahn. I did not follow the rest of the question.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I understand undulations are developing in the O-Bahn and that it has been affecting the automatic air suspension on some of the buses and they have had to slow down for safety reasons. Is the minister aware of that and has there been an effect on time-tabling?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I do not know why you say that you are aware of undulations, as we are not aware of undulations and we run the system. It is terribly important that we do not make up stuff.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I am not making this up, minister. I was as alarmed as you are, minister.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: You have form.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I don't think so. I promise you that I don't make up things.\n\nThe CHAIR: The minister has the call.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: As a result of having one of the only two O-Bahn systems in the world, it is hard to get buses made for it. We had some issues with turntables—they were quite public. We managed to write a contract with Scania to get buses with turntables that are not an issue. So often I listen to the member for Morphett and he has some latest story: undulations, speed restrictions—it is just not true. Why do you do this? Why are you so persistent?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: That is a brave statement, minister.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Mate, I am not brave dealing with you. I have heard some of the greatest rubbish in the world come out of your mouth in parliament. I remember you attacking public servants for doing their job and you named them in parliament—I remember that, and they remember it too. I remember you talking about legionnaire's disease out of the airconditioning on trams. You described a dangerous black powder that was forming on top of the tram. That dangerous black powder was called carbon, and most human beings are made of it. It is fairly common stuff. Forgive me, I will take the risk and put your undulations and speed restriction in the category of another Duncan McFetridge invention.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: You do that at your own peril, minister.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I can hardly sleep at night wondering what you are going to do to me.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I am pleased you stay awake at night because of me. I shudder to think what the thoughts are. We will move on, minister, if you don't mind, as I have a question on complaints about ticketing. I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.3. It didn't take long, did it: 28 minutes past nine.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Let us get this on the record, mate: you have a track record as long as your arm for inventing things. There are not undulations or speed restrictions on the O-Bahn. Aren't you ever slightly embarrassed about the bloody nonsense, pardon the language? Tony Piccolo is here today and I know you once said to him, after the last time you made up a story and got embarrassed with it, 'Don't worry, I only have to get one right.' That is the approach: don't worry about all the ones I get wrong—I only have to get one right! I hope you enjoy opposition because that is a luxury you can only enjoy in opposition. When you are in government you have to get everything right. They were your own words: I only have to get one right! If you have some pride in what you do you should get it all right and be truthful, honest and not invent things.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.30: complaints about ticketing. How many complaints in 2007-08 were there in the areas of punctuality, service changes, quality in staff, and fares and ticketing?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: How many complaints were made to whom?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: To the Office of Public Transport—to your department, minister. To your department, to officers of your department, minister—just tell me.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Just tell you how many complaints have been made to officers of my department: oddly enough, I don't know. My office is in the Roma Mitchell building. I walk past people every day who have caught trains; most of them are quite complimentary and some of them might have complained. Do I put that in the list? Just tell me so that I understand what you are asking for.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I think that your officers have some information there.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: If you want the formal complaints—do you want the commendations as well?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I am asking about complaints at the moment.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: In 2007-08, in terms of complaints, the number is 7,105, which was down on the year before. In terms of fares and ticketing, I think you asked about, the number is 196, which is significantly down on the year before. We had a number of suggestions for service changes, and the number of commendations is 664, up from 532 the year before. Let us be honest about this: you mob were in government for nine years and did not spend a dollar on the public transport system. The place was suffering from a massive under-investment.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I wonder why.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: You wonder why? You were not able to be the government because you had problems. They had serious problems so they were not able to be the government; they just kind of hung around for nine years and did not do anything. The truth is that there was massive—\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: You did. You privatised electricity, at a much lesser price than—\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: You supported it.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No, we never did. We never, ever supported it. I would have to say that, if you could read, you could go back through the records and find that we never supported the privatisation of electricity. I do point out that Kennett in Victoria at least got a much better price than you bumbling fools did. And I do remember the Auditor-General's Report on the sale of the—\n\nMr Goldsworthy interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: It was all our fault; we held it up. I remember the Auditor-General's Report on the employment of the American-spiv consultants at $100 million to sell ETSA. I remember the glory days of your government, but let us come to the point. Even before you there was a massive under-investment—\n\nMr Venning interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Ivan, come on; you are going to be on the front bench soon. Apparently you and Mitch are new best friends; is that true? There was a massive under-investment in public—\n\nMr Venning interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Look, if you interrupt, I will just take longer. I do like the member for Schubert; he is a nice fellow. People say that I hate all the Libs. No, I like him and Gunnie. It gets a bit thin after that. The truth is that there was a massive under-investment in public transport and, in particular, in the rail system. This government has stepped up to the mark with $2 billion of our money. I am very proud of the fact that, through our relationship with it, the federal government is actually kicking in $646 million. There is so much money around—\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: It is $2.6 billion you are spending now?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: If you allow me to finish, it is $2 billion from us and $646 million from the commonwealth. It is a difficult sum, but I reckon that it would probably add up to $2.64 billion. I come back to the point: it is the first and biggest investment in public transport the state has seen, and it is the first time since federation that the commonwealth government has been convinced to invest in public transport. This is a subject, I can tell the member for Morphett, I am happy to talk about all day, because the commitment and performance of this government, in terms of investment in public transport, as opposed to what we used to get from you, is transformational, I think is the best word.\n\nWe have recognised, as a government, despite difficult times, that there is a paradigm change in Australia about the way in which people will get around in the future. The car will not be king anymore. I am a great supporter of renewable energy; and, if I could spend some time talking about it, this state has been remarkably successful in renewable energy—without doubt the most successful in Australia, but—\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Mate, I do not think anyone in the Liberal opposition should go off on relevance. I do not think that relevance is an issue you guys should raise. Let me tell you this, and I will come back to public transport: the reason I raised renewable energy is that, as proud as we are, the greenest thing you can do is invest in public transport, and we are investing in public transport in a way that no government in South Australia ever has before, and I am very proud of that.\n\nMr Venning interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Ivan, you ride a bike? I do encourage cycling. I do know that Ivan is a keen cyclist. In lycra he does look like a character from Little Britain, but we will leave that alone. If you want to ask questions about public transport we will do it all day, because this is the government that has invested in public transport like no government before. We have made the single largest investment in the history of the state in public transport. I am very proud of the people who work for us in the Department for Transport, Jim Hallion and Rod Hook.\n\nI want to emphasise the work we have done to secure a massive injection of federal funds for the first time since federation. So that we understand, for the first time since federation the federal government is putting money into public transport and we did better out of it than any other state, and I am proud of that. If you want to talk about public transport, I am here for the rest of the day.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer the minister to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.69 and train breakdowns. When will the reports be released on the Adelaide rail yard derailment and the Noarlunga train breakdown, and will these reports be released in full?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Which reports do you refer to?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: The investigation reports into why they broke down and how the incidents were handled.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Are you talking about the rail safety reports?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: The rail safety reports, any reports. You said that there would be investigations into these incidents, and we are looking for any reports that are available on them.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: From memory, we talked about the Adelaide derailment. Isn't it marvellous? Here we are in estimates in 2009, and the best you can do is go back over a year to dredge up some bad news from then. You are special, aren't you? I do not know whether you have short-term memory problems, Duncan, but you actually asked this question. We went through this at some length in parliament.\n\nThe answer was (and I love this one) that the cause of that derailment in Adelaide was what they call a fishplate. It was one put in during the term of the Liberal government; so it got lost in the system that was put in place by the former Liberal government. The cause of that derailment in Adelaide was the systems put in place by the former Liberal government and the former minister for transport.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No; you do not understand it. You actually did ask this question about releasing the report, and I was giving the answer. Can I tell you that I make no decision personally about the release of reports. That is a decision made, I think in this case, by the Rail Safety Regulator. As I told you in parliament I cannot remember how long ago, the recommendation of the Rail Safety Regulator was that the full report should not be released because otherwise (from memory, this was the argument put to me) they will not get the candour and honesty from interviewing people if those people know that their comments will be made public.\n\nLet me tell you this, Duncan. In some bizarre future world, you may be a minister, and I hope that, when you are, having know you personally for some time, you take the advice of people smarter than you—because that is what I do. I am quite ready to acknowledge that I have a number of people—\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No, mate. I do not know when you think you were put in charge, but you were not, okay? Duncan, my understanding is that you are going to be out and that Ivan is going to be in as soon as the new person takes over.\n\nMr Venning interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Ivan, come on! Mate, you look younger, you look better and you look brighter.\n\nMr Venning interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! We have a point of order.\n\nMr VENNING: There are too many sideshows.\n\nThe CHAIR: If members continue to interject, they cannot call foul when the minister responds to their interjections. If they do not want the minister to respond to interjections, do not make the interjection. Minister, have you completed your answer?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I do apologise. I go on at length because I am so fearful of the next question from the member for Morphett. Please roll out another one for me.\n\nThe CHAIR: And the next question is, member for Morphett?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.69. What disaster recovery plan does TransAdelaide have for breakdowns and accidents, and how often are these practised with the emergency services?\n\nMr STOBBE: In relation to the question, we just completed another exercise only a few weeks ago that included all the emergency services. It involved a tram incident, and we undertook it at the Glengowrie depot. As I said, it involved all the emergency services and, by all accounts, the whole project went well, and there were some learnings. We undertake it on an annual basis.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Can I say that I think Mr Stobbe is doing an outstanding job running TransAdelaide.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Yes; I think that Mr Stobbe is a breath of fresh air. I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.69: security. What agency will be providing the extra security on public transport systems and at what cost? When will these extra security be commenced?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: It will be the same people who do it at present. When will it commence? I would hope on 1 July because we do this quite unique thing of budgeting: we budget for financial years. In short, the new security people will be the same as the old security people; there will just be more of them, and they will be working longer hours. Of course, we have brought ahead by an hour the presence of the security people on trains, and we have increased their number.\n\nThey will be employed under the same conditions as when you were last in government, but the difference is that there will be 60 per cent more of them and they will work longer hours, We think it is a terrific initiative, and I thank you for allowing me to point it out. I point out that, as a result of our increase in police numbers, there are also many more Transit Police than there used to be.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Part of the question was: what is the cost of the extra security?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: It is $1.5 million over four years.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.69: the redeployment waiting room. How many TransAdelaide staff are in the redeployment waiting room? What are their classifications, and what is the total amount of their salaries and other charges?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: What is the redeployment waiting room? As far as I can ascertain, we do not have a redeployment waiting room, so can you get your questions somewhere closer to the facts? What are you talking about?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Are there unallocated staff, who are still on salaries, sitting around in offices doing menial tasks?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Menial tasks? To be honest, I do not know. We do not have any in TransAdelaide.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: That is good news. In Budget Paper 4, page 6.18 concerning rail services City West, will normal rail services be disrupted during the relocation phase of the rail yards at City West and, if so, for how long?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: How many of the Adelaide based employees will be moved onto the new Dry Creek depot, and what car parking provision has been made for those employees who will remain in the city?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: When we relocate the rail yards you want to know what car parking facilities—\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Will be left here.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Oddly enough, we did not anticipate that question. I acknowledge it is a biggie, but we will just have to get back to you. Seriously; this is the Parliament of South Australia. You are asking me what car parking provisions are made for the relocation of the rail yard. Can we lift our game?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: You do not think it is important where the employees park, how you plan it and so on? I would have thought it was a pretty simple question.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes, it is a simple question; I think 'simple' is a wonderful description of that question. I would assume that the car parking will be adequate. We encourage people to use public transport, and over the next few years we will be spending record levels on investment in public transport. One of those projects will be the relocation of the rail yards. When we relocate the rail yards there will be adequate parking for the purposes.\n\nWe are talking about being the government of South Australia that has invested in public transport in a massive way. We are buying new rolling stock, we are resleepering, and we are electrifying. The member for Morphett will have to forgive me if I have not turned my mind to the number of car parks in the new rail yards. They will be adequate. The Department for Transport in South Australia is transformed from the tired, underfunded people you used to employ way back then. That is a fact. We are proud of what we are doing. I will get back to you on the car parking, but I will tell you this: I might even get one marked out for you out there in the new rail yards—a permanent position for the opposition spokesperson for transport.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: It is a sad, sad day.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Let's lift the game, eh?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.18, concerning rail yard bus relocation. Where will the government be relocating the buses that are now parked down by the rail yards?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: One of the great things about buses is that you can drive them around to somewhere else.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Round and round the city.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Apparently, we have a contractor called Transitplus, and it will decide where to park its buses.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: So, we do not know?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No, I do not, and I am kind of happy that I do not. I have to say that, if I spent my time worrying about where a contractor parks his buses, I would think there was something wrong with me. I am not making a judgment about you; you may take seriously the issue of where a contractor parks their buses. I happen to think we have bigger issues.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 1.69, involving a similar issue of dead running time. What will be the cost of dead running railcars to the new Dry Creek rail facility?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: We do not expect things to change at all significantly, but we will have to get the actual detail of that. It has been pointed out to me that electrification and resleepering mean they will be in the depots for less time. One of the things we will do as a result of our record investment is resleeper the lines and electrify them, and the trains will run faster, so they will spend less time dead, as you call it. They do not have to be refuelled, because they run on electricity. So, as a result of the investment of this government, the entire system will work much better than it has in the past.\n\nI do not have the numbers on dead running to there, but I am reliably advised by the people next to me that there is no significant detriment in going to Dry Creek rather than Adelaide. One of the few things that we agree on in politics in South Australia is that there is a better use for that land that I see out of my window every day than a rail yard. It is a marvellous site. We believe it should be the site for a world class hospital; the opposition agrees that it could be better used, but its latest idea is for a sports stadium; that is what you guys are still on about. Mark, are you guys still committed to building a stadium on the rail yards?\n\nMr GOLDSWORTHY: A very important piece of infrastructure.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: There you go: a very important piece of infrastructure. The one thing we do agree on is that there are better uses for that piece of land than a rail marshalling yard. We do not agree on what the better use is; we think a hospital is marvellous, and I look forward to using that hospital one day (but not too soon). You think it should be a sports stadium, but there is no doubt that the one thing we agree on is that there are better uses for that land than putting trains on it.\n\nMr VENNING: As the minister is aware, at the moment the ERD Committee is inquiring into a reference on public transport generally across the state, and yesterday it specifically looked at the Barossa problems. If it cannot supply trains, is it feasible for the department to supply buses that link in with the scheduled Gawler to Adelaide services so that at least a few times a day it can run linking services into the Barossa under the metro ticket system?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I thank the member for Schubert. I put on the record that he is a genuine fellow who genuinely represents his area, and he plagues us about public transport out there.\n\nIs it feasible? It is a difficult word because if you were to be entirely economic, you would not run public transport at all. I think the taxpayer subsidises three out of four dollars in the public transport system. About 75 per cent of the system is paid for by the taxpayer and about 25 per cent is paid for by the user. So, no public transport system is feasible. You make a judgment when you provide services as to the demand for those services and the cost. I believe that the northern suburbs out towards Gawler, where they have a very good local member—\n\nThe Hon. L. Stevens interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Sorry, and the other members on the Gawler line. There is no doubt that it is the growth area at present. The massive investment in road infrastructure through there, the presence of the interstate rail, and the fact that we were able to deepen Outer Harbor to 14.2 metres all means that the northern suburbs have infrastructure and jobs.\n\nI think, at present, the numbers for public transport out there do not quite stack up, but it is the growth area of South Australia. If I were to predict the future, I think there would be much less in the south and much more in the north and, in those circumstances, those numbers that I talked about before become far more 'doable'. We do not have plans at present to increase public transport services there, but I think it is inevitable that there will be increased services in the north because it is the growth part of South Australia.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.31 regarding taxi revenue. Has the minister discussed with taxi owners the impact of additional taxi plates on owners' revenue streams and market value of the taxi plates?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Have I discussed with taxi owners? I have discussed it with the radio control people. There are a lot of taxi plate owners, so I could not say that I have discussed it with everyone. But yes, we have certainly discussed it with the representatives of industry. Some of them have different views than others; in fact, I can guarantee that some of them believed it was a good idea to put out more plates and some of them believed it was a bad idea. But yes, we have certainly discussed it.\n\nWe have probably talked to the taxi industry more than any government has before. We have the Premier's Taxi Council. I am happy to say that I consider Ron Barton to be a mate of mine—he is a good bloke. I talk to Wally Sievers; I talk to all of them. Yes, we have discussed it with them. At the end of the day, we made the decision and we made it on the basis of the interests of South Australians.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.31. Where is the current boundary for the metropolitan taxi zone? Does this include Mount Barker? Is the zone going to be increased?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: What are the current boundaries for the metropolitan taxis?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: For the metropolitan taxis, yes. Are you going to increase it and does it include Mount Barker at the moment?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No, it does not. If you catch a taxi from the city to Mount Barker, of course, we regulate that taxi service. We will get to the metro boundary, but it is metro. No, Mount Barker is not within the metro boundary.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.69. What overseas travel has been undertaken by TransAdelaide staff during 2007-08 and 2008-09? Who went and what for?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I will get you the details, but I can tell you that one of our blokes has been travelling to Spain a lot recently. We have bought some trams from the Spanish local government in Madrid, and they would forgive me for saying this but they have processes that would choke us to death. We have had a lot of people in Spain. Randall Barry is there at the moment because you cannot do a contract apparently unless you have signed it in Spain, and he has my delegated authority to go there and sign it. I spoke to my wife about my going to Madrid instead of delegating it to Randall, but she was not impressed with the idea. That is what you do.\n\nI can assure the member for Morphett that South Australia is changing; it is not the place it used to be. It is bigger and better, with the brightest economic future of any state in Australia, and Australia is the place to be in the world, and I think that is a fantastic thing. What it does mean is that we are in the world, we are an exporting state and our people travel. Most recently they have travelled a lot by trams. I am proud of that. As a result of that, we will have a capacity that is 50 per cent larger in trams than the previous government. We are quite proud of that. We have had to go to Spain a lot for it. I will find out the rest of it.\n\nI am advised that we have sent technical people to Madrid to check the trams to make sure that we were buying the right thing. No-one else from TransAdelaide has travelled in the past year other than for the tram purchase in Spain. Being the nice bloke I am, I can tell you in a broader sense that, in public transport and in transport in general, we have some people who are members of international committees and they travel for that. In fact, I am such a good bloke I will get you those details even though you did not ask for them.\n\nThe TransAdelaide people travelled this year entirely associated with the tram purchase from Madrid.\n\nIf you want transport in general, I am advised that 13 international flights will be taken by DTEI employees at a total cost of $50,000 for the 2008-09 year. Not bad really. Those health people travel more than that, don't they?\n\nMr VENNING: I refer to page 6.29, the same line. In relation to the wine train, I understand that you and your department are involved in continual negotiations with the current owner of the wine train, Mr John Geber. Is there anything to report? Are we making progress?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I can honestly say that I have not had anything across my desk on the wine train for as long as I have been the Minister for Transport. Apparently, we are waiting for him to get back to us. He has a responsibility to get some accreditation. I can tell you—\n\nMr VENNING: I have a supplementary question. I understand your department has had several reports. I know the Hon. Dennis Hood has tried to get some information from you under FOI.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: It is actually not true, and I am glad you have given me this opportunity because it is very annoying. It is a low level annoyance this notion that we refuse to give some reports on an FOI. There are no reports. I make the point right at the start; that is, we as ministers do not influence the FOI decisions: they are made by the departments. There are no reports. As I understand it, there is a series of internal documents where the people in the department have conversed with each other about—and often I think quite tangentially—the train.\n\nThere is no report to give anyone. There is nothing in the nature of a report. I have been the Minister for Transport since about 2005 (or something like that) and I have never had anything come to me about Barossa rail proposing that we do anything. This sort of fanciful stuff that some sort of secret study has not been released or acted on is not true. There are some documents that are not reports. They are internal documents which refer to the Barossa. They were not released. They are five to seven years old, I am told, and they are inconsequential.\n\nThe difficult politics of it is that we are not doing Barossa services. I am very clear about that: we are not. No-one in the department has ever suggested we should and we are not. We are not winning any points with people in the Barossa by saying that, but the simple fact is that, on our understanding, it would not wash its face. Public transport, as we talked about earlier, does not wash its face.\n\nMr VENNING: Should I ask the Minister for Tourism that question and not you?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: The point you have raised is that, yes, it is probably a more important issue from the consideration of tourism than it is for public transport. Unfortunately, our obligation is to run public transport the best and most economic way we can. I come back to this point: when we run public transport, it is subsidised. It is about 75 per cent subsidised by the taxpayer. We do not have magic money; we only have taxpayers' money. We have to make decisions about the best way to spend that money on behalf of taxpayers.\n\nThe Barossa service has not been a matter of great discussion within the department because it certainly is not a priority. If you look around our services in South Australia and around the country, there has been a huge increase in demand for public transport and you put those taxpayer dollars in the best place you can. My advice is that is not the best place.\n\nMr VENNING: I hear the answer. I continue on the same line. I think we all know that no passenger transport service pays in the state, and I do not expect the Barossa one would either, but that is the criteria being used. My last question on this line is—\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Mate, you own about 35 cars; what would you do with public transport? How many cars do you own, Ivan?\n\nMr VENNING: That is hypothetical; it is an irrelevant question. The minister would know that most Barossa people drive to Gawler, park their cars and use the Gawler service to commute to Adelaide, which is a good service. We continually have a security problem in the Gawler car parks. I understand the department does control these car parks. What can be done, because cars are continually being stolen and vandalised? Cars are left there all day, with some of them often remaining there into the evening when it is dark, and the vandalism is extremely high.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I will get Bob Stobbe to talk about this in a minute. What I will say is that we as a government are quite proud of our influence on crime statistics, particularly motor vehicle crime. When we came to government, we used to lead the nation by a long way in motor vehicle crime and we have improved that. Mike Rann is unashamedly tough on the people who interfere with your wellbeing and property.\n\nI was very encouraged to see that one of our Supreme Court judges has been positive about the new bikie laws that have been made, and I think it is a tremendous step forward. I am sure that Mike is in the other place and is more than happy to talk about this himself. What I will say is that things are better now than they were seven years ago in terms of motor vehicle crime and crime in general. One of the reasons is—and I used to be a police minister—that we dramatically increased the number of police officers when we came to government, and that is something I am proud of.\n\nMr VENNING: What about a car park attendant?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I have not finished yet, Ivan. I love listening to me. Do you? I really enjoy it. Bob might want to say something about it, but what I will say is that, in terms of rail security, there is more now. I think in terms of security people, 60 per cent more than there were, and they work longer hours than they used to. We have stepped up to the mark there. There is no doubt that you could do more if you had unlimited resources, but we have stepped up to the mark. We do 60 per cent more—it is actually more than 60 per cent more, because it is 60 per cent in numbers and, in terms of hours, they actually work an hour longer as well. Bob, do you want to add anything?\n\nMr STOBBE: Yes.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I know that Tony Piccolo is a very active local member, so I have to tell you that, if we were going to do anything, we would do it for Tony, because he never lets up on you. He is the hardest working local member I have ever seen. He never lets up on you. He is in our office about three times a week. He is always buying my staff chocolates. I know what it is all about, mate. It is about him getting his way.\n\nMr STOBBE: If I could add just a few points: in relation to the Gawler car park, we have actually received some additional funding to enhance the CCTV coverage. You may also be aware that there is a proposal to expand that car park as well to provide additional car parking spaces. That is still under review, but it is likely to proceed.\n\nIn addition, we work very closely with SAPOL in terms of identifying the hot spots. We encourage both our employees and the general public to let us know where there are issues. We respond very quickly to known hot spots, and SAPOL is involved—both uniformed and undercover operations—and it has been very successful. You can see the success rate of SAPOL. We work very closely with SAPOL, and we are very happy with that arrangement.\n\nMr HANNA: I refer to the same budget paper volume. In sub-program 4.2, passenger services, I am pleased to note the reference to additional bus and tram services. Of course, I am particularly concerned about the electorate of Mitchell. A particular point of reference is the development of the Hallett Cove shops, which is going to mean an increased demand for people to get from Trott Park, Sheidow Park and maybe Old Reynella—across the suburbs, in a sense, usually against the flow of public transport routes—to the Hallett Cove shops. Also, in Seaview Downs and Seacombe Heights, increasingly the population is older, and they have to walk across or up the hills—more than 500 metres usually—to get to a bus stop. Is there anything there which will assist the people in the electorate of Mitchell?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Off the top of my head, I cannot tell you. What I will say—and you would know—is that, in the area that you are talking about, we actually put $3 million into a road that we ordinarily would not fund, because we recognised the unusual circumstances. What is the connector road called?\n\nMr HANNA: Patpa Road.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Patpa; that's right. I would like to think that they named it after me, but apparently not. It means something else. I am advised, and as you have identified, we have actually bought new buses—not just replacement buses, but extra buses—and we have funded extra kilometres, which is the key point. I am told that there are five p.m. peak service increases and one a.m. peak service increase (Mitcham to city and city to Mitcham), so there are extra services for Mitcham out of those extra funds.\n\nMr HANNA: I am the member for Mitchell, not Mitcham.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Why are you saying it like that? I know you are the member for Mitchell because we swap suburbs every time there is a redistribution. I know all about that. We will get you the details. We always go out of our way to help you, Kris.\n\nMr PICCOLO: I am trying to find the reference. It was a supplementary question asked by the member for Schubert in relation to car parking.\n\nAn honourable member: It's 6.39.\n\nMr PICCOLO: Thank you; 6.39. Can the minister elaborate on the new security arrangements proposed for not only the Gawler station but also for Gawler Central station, and could he perhaps provide some background as to why the car parking has been increased?\n\nMr VENNING: Can we buy lock-up spaces? Can you provide lock-up spaces?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I will come back to it. I want to put on the record that Tony Piccolo, the former mayor of Gawler, is the greatest champion for his area that I have ever dealt with. When I said that he is in my office three days a week, I am probably understating it. He has been an enormous champion for services out there. I know that, as a result of his work, he has had a number of meetings with Bob Stobbe about these issues. Bob, would you like to put something on the record? Before Bob starts, in short, as a result of the work done by Tony Piccolo, there are 60 extra car parks out there. In terms of security—I think we talked about this a little earlier—I will hand over to Bob.\n\nMr STOBBE: We have seen a significant increase in patronage, not just at Gawler, and we would like to see a continuation of that, obviously, as we expand our rolling stock and also our network. We often hear from MPs or the public about requirements at various stations. Gawler is one that we are looking at, but there are a number of other stations and park-and-rides that we are also considering expanding because of the increase in patronage. Gawler is just one of them.\n\nAs was mentioned by the minister, we are increasing the car parking there by around 60 car parks and, no doubt, that will quickly fill as well. So, we will have to look at other opportunities as well, as we continue to see this increase in patronage. I think I have previously discussed the security there.\n\nMr PICCOLO: Gawler Central as well?\n\nMr STOBBE: The same arrangements are in place at Gawler Central in terms of improvements to CCTV. I should have said previously that there have been significant upgrades and improvement in the lighting for the platforms and car parks, which will enhance security. We will continue to look at other opportunities to enhance the security as we go forward.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Minister, my question is based on an allegation that has been put to me. I hope the minister can discredit the allegation because it is a significant issue, and I hope it is not true. I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.31—Taxi accreditation. Can the minister assure the committee that no taxi drivers in South Australia are using illegally obtained accreditation?\n\nRecently, on a trip to the airport, a fellow who claimed to be a taxi owner told me that two Department for Transport employees had been suspended because they had been issuing false taxi driver accreditation, and he quoted the figure of 47. I have not been able to verify this alarming allegation. If the minister is able to publicly discredit the allegation, that would be wonderful for the taxi drivers.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Can I guarantee that people will not act unlawfully? No, I cannot; I would be a mug if I did. The truth of the matter is that we have laws in place and, if people choose to break the law, they are criminals. I cannot guarantee you that every person in South Australia will obey the laws we make. However, what I can say is that, if you have some substantial allegation about this sort of behaviour, I urge you to deliver it to us, and we will act upon it. We cannot act upon things we are not told about. If you seriously have information, I ask you to deliver it to us so that we can act upon it.\n\nI have no doubt that, as in every other walk of life, the majority of people in the taxi industry are lawful, hardworking people. However, I have no doubt that the industry, like any other, will occasionally attract people who choose to be less than lawful, and that is regrettable, but it is not unique to the taxi industry. I will say, though, that South Australia has always had the best taxi industry in Australia. It is not perfect, but it is an industry that has so often offered an opportunity to migrants to Australia to find their way, to work hard and to build a future, and that is something of which we can be proud and they can be proud.\n\nAre there people in the taxi industry who are prepared to act unlawfully? Yes. Are there people in the banking industry or any industry on earth who are prepared to act unlawfully? Yes, there are. If the member for Morphett has some substantial information, he should give it to us and it will be acted upon because, as a government, we do not like people who act unlawfully. Even more importantly, the vast majority of people in the taxi industry are hardworking, decent people who are working for their families, and we would prefer that they are not tainted with allegations. I say to the member: if you have any information, bring it to us and it will be acted upon.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I put on the record that I hold the taxi drivers of South Australia in high regard. They do a difficult job, often under very difficult circumstances. I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.8—Ministerial office resources. Minister, there have been some issues about the use of Cabcharge vouchers by TransAdelaide employees. I know that most of these Cabcharge vouchers have been used for exceptionally good reasons, but the issue has been raised with me about TransAdelaide employees being given Cabcharge vouchers to travel home from TransAdelaide social functions.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I just hope you have some reason for putting that on the record. I hope it is not another one of your inventions, because it reflects very poorly on people. You are talking about human beings. I remember you came into the other chamber and launched what I think was one of most outrageous attacks on a public servant, and you named him—and I think he will remember it for the rest of his life—and it was absolutely wrong. You accused him in cowards castle of acting inappropriately, bordering on corruptly, and it was wrong. You have never, to my knowledge, apologised to the chamber or to him for it.\n\nWe will look at your allegation, but I really hope there is some basis to it. You can come into this place and hop into me as much as you like, because I can take it. However, public servants who are doing their job—and if, God forbid, you are ever the government, they will do the job for you—should not be used as a political football. I know and Tony Piccolo knows, because he is out there, that your attack on that public servant was disgraceful, and I have never seen a trace of embarrassment or apology from you for it. So, yes, we will look at your allegation, but I do hope that one day you will take seriously the fact that you have been given high office and access to privilege and you should use it with some degree of responsibility and, I dare say, honesty.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: That completes the questioning. I appreciate the fact that the government has not asked any questions, other than those asked by Mr Piccolo. We are happy to now move on to Transport Planning Services.\n\nThe CHAIR: We will now proceed to Transport Planning Services.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Heather Haselgrove is now leaving the chamber, but she is also leaving TransAdelaide as she has taken up a job running public transport in Hobart. I wish her the very best and thank her for all the work she has done for us.\n\nDepartmental Advisers:\n\nMr Andrew Milazzo, Executive Director, Transport Services Division.\n\nMs Trudi Meakins, Executive Director, Policy and Planning Division.\n\nMr Phil Allan, Executive Director, Safety and Regulation.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.17: DTEI's structure. Has the Department for Transport an Energy been restructured to remove the Department for Transport into an entirely different structure and, if so, when will this happen?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I did not understand the question: is the Department for Transport being restructured into something else?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Yes.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No. There are planned changes around TransAdelaide. I am bemused as it is a government department. There is no doubt we have a savings target and no doubt that it is likely to lead to a reduction in jobs in the future, but that is something in the environment of the global financial crisis for which we cannot apologise, but as to the structure of the department itself, it is a government department.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: You said something about TransAdelaide.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: To be completely frank—and I have said it before—the structure of TransAdelaide was set up by the previous Liberal Government as a precursor to privatisation. They created a body corporate that could be hived off and sold. As a result of the good judgment of the people of South Australia, we came to government and that did not happen, but we inherited a corporate structure for TransAdelaide that I do not think is entirely appropriate for an ongoing government agency. Let us make no mistake: this is a government agency. It is a government agency that does service for South Australians—it is not a business. If it were a business it would go broke because, as I said earlier, public transport (particularly trains) is subsidised $3 for every $1 by the taxpayer, so you have to recognise that it will not be privatised and will never be privatised under this government.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: But it has been restructured, has it?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes, we are looking at TransAdelaide because we believe the thing you put in place when last in government as a precursor to the privatisation was wrong. Unfortunately in the modern world we are all captives of accountants and how you account for the expenditure of moneys is bizarrely important in government. I assure you that, if it were not for what the accountants tell us, personally I would have moved from a corporate structure for TransAdelaide a long time ago. I believe that TransAdelaide is a part of the Department for Transport and provides services to the public and should be simply a government agency. How we get there is another matter. We are all under the control of accountants but, make no mistake, the only structure in the Department for Transport that should and will change is the structure for TransAdelaide.\n\nOne of the bizarre and weird things the previous Liberal Government did with TransAdelaide was set up within government this corporation that contracts with us, with the Public Transport Division (PTD), and it is bizarre. I do not know what was going through the heads of the previous Liberal government where you have an agency in government that contracts with another agency in government and then argues about the contract—it is bizarre. Why you did that is beyond me; it is wrong and we will change it.\n\nUnfortunately, we are all under the control of accountants and have to do it so that it does not affect the bottom line. I find it quite weird that a dollar spent one way in government, if you change the name of the corporate structure, is different from a dollar spent elsewhere as it is all taxpayers' money, but that is the truth of the matter. I find it weird. The only change in the structure of the department is TransAdelaide, as should be the case, because it was a bizarre mad model that the previous government created as a precursor to privatisation. It is outdated, because we will never privatise it.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.23. Does the state government have a comprehensive transport plan? When you were commenting on the O-Bahn on ABC Radio and referring to a comprehensive transport plan of the public transport system, the Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House (Hon. David Ridgway) FOI'd a copy of the comprehensive transport plan as follows:\n\nI request access to a copy of the comprehensive transport plan referred to by the Minister for Transport on ABC891 on 13 May.\n\nIn response to that there is a one-page document, which appears to have come straight out of 'Adelaide—new connections' in last year's budget papers. I have had a look at the Victorian document, which is 154 pages. Does the state government have a comprehensive transport plan, as you said on radio?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I say to the member for Morphett that we have something better than a comprehensive transport plan. We have got the most comprehensive set of investments in public transport that the state has ever seen.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: That is different from an integrated plan.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: You may value your 170 pages from Victoria; I value the $2 billion we have got out of the state Treasury to invest in public transport.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: But without a plan, a comprehensive plan.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I could go on about this for a while.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Let us hear about this comprehensive plan.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I can assure the member for Morphett of a number of things, one is that we are far more serious than he is. We are putting taxpayers' money—\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Well, show us your comprehensive plan, Patrick.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: You have arced up; it is good to see that there is a little life left in you. It is really good to see because you have looked so much like a bloke walking the plank for the past few months. I understand that, as soon as the change is made, Ivan is going up and you are going down. Ivan, welcome. Look at Ivan; he looks happy enough. Look at that smile. He knows the future. I turn to plans. We came to government and we established the South Australian Strategic Plan.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: You said you had a comprehensive plan of public transport.\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! The minister has the call.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes, we have the most comprehensive plan for transport South Australia has ever seen, and we have investment to back it up. It is not a report for the consumption of people like you. It is—\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: What we are going through is the highlight of Duncan's time at estimates here, where he has woken out of his slumber and he yells a few interjections.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! The minister has the call.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Can I say this to the member for Morphett about South Australia's planning for transport, the member for Morphett should look at what happened in the recent federal budget and the Infrastructure Australia funding. What happened was that, for the first time in history, since federation, the federal government put money into public transport. Per capita it put more into South Australia than anywhere else. Why were we able to do that?\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Will you just stop talking and listen for a moment.\n\nThe CHAIR: Order!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: His complaint is that the Senate committee did not come here. Let me tell you what we got out of Infrastructure Australia—about $1.2 billion. Do you know what New South Wales got? Do you know? It got $90 million. We got $1.2 billion. I am sorry but I would rather have the money than the Senate committee, mate. Call me old-fashioned, but I would rather have the money.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No plan. I look forward to the day when he is the minister because we will not have any money but we will have a great plan. The truth is that the quality of the work done by our officials in South Australia was the reason we got $646 million—the first time since federation—into public transport into South Australia. Why? Because of the quality of the work that they did. Why did New South Wales get only $90 million out of the whole fund and we got $640 million for public transport? Why? Because of the quality of the planning work that our people did. It is about the quality of the work: it is not about selling some cheap document to you—\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: You sent it to us, Patrick.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: When you are finished I will go on, because I am very proud of what our people have done. The fact that South Australia has the biggest per capita funding for public transport—I stress, for the first time since federation—was as a result of the quality of the work that was put up to Infrastructure Australia: the quality of the planning for the entire network. I do not know where you have been, but I can tell you this: we have put out a plan that involves the resleepering and electrification of the entire system. It involves buying something like 70 new items of rolling stock. It involves tram extensions, which one day you support and the next day you oppose, according to which way the wind is blowing.\n\nIt involves tram extensions to West Lakes and to Semaphore: a coast to coast tram. It is the most comprehensive plan for the future of public transport the state has ever seen. But it is better than that, it is an investment commitment. We had a global financial crisis interrupt us and we managed not only to preserve all of that public transport planning and investment but we increased it with the support of the commonwealth. This is a big success story. This is a success story for the state. This will be around for decades once we are all out of this place. It is a success story. The fact that you do not like the way it is presented to you is something that I will just have to live with.\n\nWhen I am retired and I look around South Australia and I see the result of the great work of these people I work with—and I am very proud of the people in the Department of Transport—I will not be thinking about the fact that you did not get your plan, Duncan. Goodness me, let's get serious. We are talking about $2.6 billion going into public transport. We are talking about doing it in the best planned way that has ever happened in this state. We are talking about the fact that, in the next few days—I do not know whether I am supposed to say this because it is the Hon. Paul Holloway's responsibility—there will be a 30-year plan for Adelaide. That 30-year plan for Adelaide will include 70 per cent of development in the future around our rail corridors, with our urban growth boundary preserved and infill around public transport corridors. It will be about excellence and sustainability. It is the best thing we could have done for South Australia.\n\nThere is a paradigm shift. We cannot spread north and south any more, and the car cannot be king any more. Quality public transport is the future. We have $2.6 billion to underpin that future. It is without doubt the most significant investment in our future that we are making, and I am just going to have to live with myself because I have not given you the plan you want.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.23. What planning has been completed on the tramlines to Port Adelaide, Semaphore, West Lakes and Grange? When does the government propose that those extensions will be completed?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I remember that you asked me why there was no money for these extensions in the budget. They are beyond the out years. From memory, 2015 is the completion of works. You asked this question (although I am not sure why), but can I assure you that they are locked in. When we went to the commonwealth to get its contribution, we did so on the basis of what we were doing. That is why they are locked in—because we could not have got $600 million out of the commonwealth if we had not shown it our earnestness about what we were going to do. So, they are locked in, and they are going to happen. They are not in the out years, as I explained to you in parliament, but they are going to happen.\n\nI grew up in Port Adelaide and, when I was a child, they took the railway line out of the middle of Semaphore Road, and we are going to put it back in. It is something we are very proud of, and it is going to happen. It is just outside the forward estimates, which go for four years, but I can guarantee that the funding is locked in because we have gone to the commonwealth and told it what we are doing, and it is contributing on that basis. I suspect that it will not contribute if we do not do our part of the bargain, so it will happen.\n\nI point out that the commencement of funding is in 2013-14, with completion in 2015. You have to understand that we have to buy rolling stock, which has a long lead time. I have seen some of your frankly silly comments about the trams from Madrid. I do hope you are going to ask something about the purchase price of the trams from Madrid because you seem very keen to get out there and mislead people in the media. I do hope you have the courage to ask a question about them at some point. Are you going to ask about the purchase price of the trams?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: We will wait.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I will try to stay awake. What you said in the paper was absolutely silly but, then again, I am used to that.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.23. Which areas along the current network have been developed for TODs, and why has the government approved developments, such as Buckland Park, which are not consistent with TOD policy?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Here is the deal. I will do this slowly. Our investment means that 70 per cent of development will be within the urban growth boundary, and that means that 30 per cent will not. The northern suburbs are the growth suburbs. The investment by this government in the Northern Expressway, the deepening of Outer Harbor, the future investment in what will be called the 'northern connector' and the movement of freight rail means that the northern suburbs are on the most important freight corridor in South Australia by a mile. It means that people want to do business and create jobs up there, which they are doing in bucket loads. That is why it is likely that you will see new suburbs in the north.\n\nSouth Australia is a success story, and the northern suburbs are a huge part of that; therefore, in my view, Buckland Park (it is a private development and private investment) makes sense. It is putting people where the jobs are, where the freight is and where the future is. I do not apologise for that. I do not apologise for that at all. I will tell you something about Buckland Park. It used to be a bit of land out in the west that was bought by a bloke called Lang Walker.\n\nLang Walker is an Australian who, every time he starts a business, he tends to make a billion dollars out of it and then sells it. He is a very astute businessman. I have had a conversation with him because he believes that the future is not New South Wales; it is South Australia. He says that this is the place to be. Kerry Stokes says that this is the place to be. Why are they at Buckland Park? Because South Australia has the brightest future of any state in the commonwealth, and we are the best country on earth, too. So, why is Buckland Park going ahead? Because we are succeeding.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No; we have not. We have not done any planning; we are just going to sit and let it happen. Are you serious? For God's sake, are you serious? Of course we have done planning.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order, member for Morphett!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Can I tell you something: not only are we planning but we are investing and we are building the future.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: South Australia is the place to be. Take some pride in your state, mate.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I just point out that what the member for Morphett is complaining, whingeing and whining about is the success of South Australia.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Show us your plan.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Show us your plan! Let me show you success. Independent economic advisers say that this is the place to be. Kerry Stokes says this is the place to be. Lang Walker says this is the next place he is going to make a billion dollars.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I tell you this, mate: my plan for the state is for South Australia to be the most successful state in the commonwealth, and I have bad news for you—it is working.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! I warn the member for Morphett. The minister has the call. The member for Morphett will have an opportunity to speak once the minister has finished.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: My plan for South Australia is for South Australia to be the best place to live in Australia and to be the most successful place. I have bad news for you: we are on track. Independent advisers tell us we are on track. Access Economics—you know: that left wing group—says South Australia is the best place in Australia, and Australia is the best modern economy in the world. That is my plan for South Australia. Forgive me for its being a humble plan; I want South Australia to be the best place to live in Australia. I was born in Belfast; I migrated to this country. Every morning when I wake up I am in front, because I am in South Australia. I want it to be the best place in the world; that is our plan. You know what? Bad news for you, member for Morphett: it is actually working.\n\nMr GOLDSWORTHY: Despite you!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Despite me. I have to point out to these blokes—\n\nThe CHAIR: Order!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: There should be an offence in the South Australia statute books of impersonating an opposition. These blokes are pathetic. They want to get on the front foot and get angry; they are pathetic.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: The only reason the Leader of the Opposition has not been replaced is that no-one wants the bloody job. No-one wants it, because you are embarrassed. You are an embarrassment. You should be arrested for impersonating an opposition.\n\nMembers interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! Does the member for Morphett have a question?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.15. What is the current status of the National Transport Plan policy framework?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I am going. Come on, mate; do some work! The National Transport Plan is ongoing. I will put this on the record: the current Minister for Transport is the best Minister for Transport the country has ever seen. Anthony Albanese has dragged people into national reform. Put this on the record: I am a huge supporter of greater uniformity in national laws. I think it is an embarrassment to our nation that, if you go to Europe there are different countries there which 50 or 60 years ago were at war with each other but which have greater uniformity of regulation than we have.\n\nUnfortunately, we seem to be incredibly slow. I put on the record that Anthony Albanese recognises this and is trying to do more about it than any federal minister I have seen. Anyone who has ever been to an Australian Transport Ministers' Council would know that it is like Groundhog Day; the same things are on the agenda that were on the agenda a decade ago, because in this nation we are slow to move to regulatory reform. It is happening faster than it ever did, and that is because we have the best federal transport minister I have ever seen, and he is committed to it.\n\nLet us be plain about this: while you are doing transport reform, glaciers whizz by; that is how long it takes. It is like Groundhog Day, I am telling you. I am happy to say that Anthony Albanese is a mate of mine; he is doing a terrific job, and he has recognised that we have to get our heads out of the sand and that we have to get greater uniformity in Australia. It is a very hard thing to do.\n\nI think it is bad, and it reflects on everyone and our system of government in the past, but I think it is unconscionable that there is greater uniformity in Europe than there is in one country in terms of licensing and regulation. In short, what is happening is ongoing, and it should happen faster. I support wholeheartedly Anthony Albanese's moves to create greater uniformity and regulation of transport in Australia. I point out that Jim Hallion is chair of the Australian Maritime Group, for very good reasons: he sank his boat in the Sydney to Hobart, so they thought they would put him in charge of boat safety.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: What long-term planning has been completed on the north-south axis, given that the federal government has now provided funding for this planning?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: It is kind of like, 'Please tell us what you have done well since you came to government.' When we came to government, the north-south corridor was not on the agenda. We put it on the agenda with funding and, as you well know, the Gallipoli underpass will be completed in about three months. Close after Gepps Cross, I think it is the worst bottleneck in South Australian transport. We did that. It was our money that put it on the agenda and, as a result of that, we got $70 million out of the commonwealth for planning alone and a commitment of $500 million.\n\nI point out that when we came to government it was not on the agenda. We put it on the agenda, and we have achieved $70 million for planning and $500 million for capital works. Sorry; it is $500 million in total: $430 million plus $70 million. So far, in the planning stage I think we have spent about $12 million of that commonwealth contribution—around that. That will be complete. It is the most difficult challenge for road transport in South Australia. Geography has us pinned between the Hills and the sea. Are you not interested, mate?\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I am listening, mate. I was wondering what happened to the MATS plan. Do you still use it? Wouldn't that have been nice?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: The MATS plan? Can I ask the member for Morphett that, if he is going to ask me questions, he bring them somewhere within the past 30 years? That would be helpful to me. Whatever happened in the dim past, we are the first government to put this South Road on the agenda. We have put our money where our mouth is and we are building works. As a result of the commonwealth contribution we will build new works. As a result of the $70 million for planning, we have changed the order of what we were going to do when we were doing it on our own and will build two overpasses in the north in the growth area of South Australia we talked about before; the place that moves the most freight: McCormack Road, Grand Junction Road and the Wingfield rail line.\n\nAs a result of our putting it on the agenda we will be spending our money and $500 million of commonwealth's money in improving probably the most difficult road for South Australians moving and moving freight. I am proud of that. I am happy to talk about it at great length, but it is ongoing and, as a result of our work, we have a funding partner in the commonwealth. We are quite proud of that.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: On the same budget reference, what has been a result of the federal government's promise to complete a study into the rail bypass around the Adelaide Hills?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Can you ask me questions about what I am responsible for? The federal government, in regard to your earlier plan, commented that our bids in Infrastructure Australia were funded because they believed they were part of a comprehensive plan. I just thought I would share that with you. That is a comprehensive transport plan.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes. But what you need to understand is that it is not about going out there and selling a document, mate: it is about building a future for our children. It is not about selling a bloody document. Okay? What was your other question? I don't want to waste a moment of this because I strongly suspect this is the last time I will ever get the opportunity to get asked questions by you. We have been told what is happening, and I probably should extend time today because it is the last opportunity I will get to be asked questions by you.\n\nCan I point out that this is budget estimates for the state government? You are asking questions about a commonwealth study. If you like, I can get Anthony Albanese down here later and you can ask him questions. If you reckon I am mean, wait until you see him.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: On the same budget reference, what has been the result of the urban congestion studies? How is the Adelaide metropolitan area faring compared to other cities of similar population size? What is the government doing to reduce congestion?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Mate, do you think about these questions before you ask them? We have put $2.5 billion into public transport because it is the future—to be exact, $2.64 billion into getting people out of cars and onto public transport, into getting the best planned city in Australia. What are we doing about congestion? We as a government have put South Road on the agenda and secured $500 million of funding from the commonwealth as a result of that. We are putting $2.5 billion into public transport, into our rail corridors. What is that about? It is about a better way of living; it is about getting people out of cars and onto high quality public transport.\n\nHonestly, I am embarrassed by you. If you want to talk about this, we can talk about it all day. Can I compare what we have done as a government? Madam Chair, you used to be a minister for transport and started a lot of this and, whenever I drive through the Bakewell underpass, I am reminded that the Hon. Trish White was the minister who did it. I am grateful for it. This government has done so much more. In your nine years do you know what you did to improve congestion, for investment? Nothing. You sold ETSA—nine years, and they sold ETSA.\n\nThey say, 'The State Bank didn't let us do anything.' I have to tell you that we are the government of the same place as you were, and what a difference it is—nine years. Remind me what their big investment was in public transport in that time. That's right; I remember it—a one-way Southern Expressway. That was it. The only other project you ever did was entirely funded by Laurie Brereton up in the Hills. Laurie Brereton signed the cheque for it. So, mate, if you want to talk about congestion and what we do, just do me the credit of taking us seriously and stop asking dumb questions.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: It is just the answers I shake my head over. I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.22. Does the minister agree with his coordinator-general that trams should be allowed to run down Rundle Mall?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Yes? Interesting answer.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: And can I tell you why he raised that issue? One of the private sector developers who went overseas with us is angry with Rod Hook because he believes that Rod pinched his idea. We went to some cities in Germany—and it has changed the thinking of those developers, and I have to say it is changing the thinking of the department. We have always focused on rail corridors and separating those corridors from people. What we saw in some of the best cities I have seen in the world is that the trams run on a level surface and they mix with people, bikes and cars.\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Sorry, I forgot—you thought of all this before. Of course! Can I remind you about your travel report? You spoke glowingly of Bombardier trams until we bought them, and then you said they were wrong. You supported the tram extension to North Terrace until we decided to do it, and then you opposed it. You are on the record. I think, Ivan, you and the member for Morphett moved the motion in the house calling for the extension to North Terrace until we decided to do it, and then you opposed it.\n\nI remember your story—the two stories you sold in 24 hours—about the tram accident. Do you remember that? How you were late for a meeting with the Premier—shall we go through that again? The two different stories in 24 hours? Can I tell you that the member for Morphett is a stranger to the truth. Do you want to go back? One day—\n\nMr Goldsworthy interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No, so you know who represents you on the front bench.\n\nThe CHAIR: Has the minister finished his answer?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: In short—\n\nAn honourable member interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Ranting and raving—let me say this, just so it is on the record: the member for Morphett moved a motion in the Parliament of South Australia calling for an extension of the tram to North Terrace and, then when we announced that we were doing it, he opposed it.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: No; I opposed some of the reasons for it, Patrick. I opposed the way you did it. You did it on the cheap. It was cheap and nasty. I just hope you are going to do the next bit properly, Patrick. Let's hope you do it properly, not cheap and nasty. Why don't you use booted rail, Patrick? Why don't you do it properly?\n\nThe CHAIR: You can both have a go, but one at a time.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Can someone tell me what is wrong with the tram extension, because it has been marvellously successful? It has been hugely successful. You opposed it—\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: You changed your view as it was convenient. I come back to the point—\n\nDr McFetridge interjecting:\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: It is your nickel, mate.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: You're not a genius when it comes to this, Patrick.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: The member for Morphett is right, I am not a genius, but I am smarter than him because I supported the tram extension from day one, supported it every step of the way. It was also commenced under the former minister for transport. I supported it. The member for Morphett supported it until we did it and then he opposed it. Then we went to St Kilda. Apparently, on the day we went to St Kilda for the history of trams, he always supported the tram extension. The truth is that the member for Morphett cannot keep a story straight for 24 hours. I am enjoying this because it is my last opportunity with the member for Morphett because I have heard the stories and he has, too. I regret to say that it is ta-ta for the member for Morphett from the front bench. Welcome, Ivan, looking forward to it, but I am enjoying this. I say to the member for Morphett: it is these little golden moments we share together that make the job worthwhile.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.22. Minister, what sites did you personally visit in the USA on your recent trip to investigate transport oriented developments?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I will get you the itinerary.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Did you actually visit the sites in the USA?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: You did?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes, is that—\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Did you visit the Oregon ironworks in Portland and see them building trams there—seven trams?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No, I did not. I do not know what the member for Morphett is driving at, but, on occasions, my itinerary was not the same as those other people, for a very good reason. I had been to Portland before, and so had Rod Hook. On one of the occasions that the people in Portland were going to look at something, Rod and I were meeting with the people who run public transport there, because, having been there before, we thought that was a better use of our time. If your question is: did my itinerary absolutely match those of the other people—no, for the very good reason that we had been to Portland before. If you have some criticism to make of that trip, please make it, but be clear about it and do not invent things again, Duncan.\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! Before I call on the member for Morphett, I remind him that he must identify the line in the budget papers to which his question refers.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Thank you for your advice, Madam Chair. I refer to Budget Paper 4, Volume 1, page 6.22. Minister, what is the plan for the Tonsley rail line?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: You would know that—courtesy also, I think, of the federal government putting in some money—we are doing a planning study of the Tonsley line and possible extensions to around the Flinders Medical Centre at Sturt Road, as well as looking at the future of Sturt Road and South Road. There is an ongoing study. I can say that our studies are backed up by money and I am sure something good will come out of it, but let us just wait for that to conclude.\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: I refer to Budget Paper 5, page 18, public transport ticketing. Minister, who are the bidders for the new public transport ticketing system; how many are there; and do they have a track record in Australia and/or even the Southern Hemisphere?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Can I tell you about bidding? I do not know and I do not think I should. I do not think ministers should award contracts. You guys used to muck around with that stuff when you were in government. I remember the Auditor-General's Report into the water contract. Do you remember that? The camera ran out of video tape; the bid came in late. We operate tenders in this government with the highest possible probity, and so I do not know who the bidders are. I may have been told but it—\n\nDr McFETRIDGE: Do you know how many?\n\nThe CHAIR: Order!\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I do not who they are but I know how many. The department can tell you that 13 organisations have so far responded. The evaluation of proposals will occur between June and August 2009. It will not be done by me, and nor should it be. It will be dealt with using the highest possible standards of public accountability because we are dealing with taxpayers' money. I contrast that with the water deal, ETSA, the Hindmarsh Stadium—blasts from the past. We deal with these matters with the highest possible probity. I do not know who they are. I can guarantee the member for Morphett that I personally will have absolutely no role in selecting the bidder. I will probably sign it when it goes to cabinet and that is about it because it will be done independently of me, and that is as it should be.\n\nMr VENNING: I refer to the same line, page 6.21, planning. In relation to the government's intention for the northern growth boundary, which is to the north and north-east of Gawler, has the department made any long-term plans concerning extending the electrification of the Adelaide to Gawler line to this new development area?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: We have laid out an investment program for the next decade. We have no doubt that where you are talking about is a growth area and we have no doubt that, when we finish our investment program, there may well be new priorities out there, but I think what we have laid out is very clear. It is a 10-year program of investment in rail. It does not include extensions there at present. I believe in the future of this state and I have no doubt that we will do more in the northern suburbs in the future, but I also have no doubt that I will be safely retired by then.\n\nMr GOLDSWORTHY: I refer to page 6.22. In view of the fact that you say that the state is doing very well and that yours is the best government in the history of the state for transport infrastructure—\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I didn't say that, but it sounds all right. I will live with that.\n\nMr GOLDSWORTHY: Well, I think you did say that, minister. Perhaps we can look at the Hansard. Given your comments that yours has been the best government—\n\nThe Hon. P.F. Conlon interjecting:\n\nThe CHAIR: Order! Minister, the member for Kavel has the call.\n\nMr GOLDSWORTHY: It is not our take, minister, it is your take: that yours has been the best government for transport infrastructure. What planning is being done to construct a second park-and-ride facility in the Mount Barker district given the fact that the current facility is at capacity? The second part of my question is: when will the government commit to funding to assist with the construction of the second freeway interchange at Mount Barker?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: We will not be committing to funding for the second. We have done a lot of work with the council, but it is not our road and it is not our priority. We have done everything we can to help, including trying to secure federal funding, but it is not our road. The truth is that South Australia is a big place with a lot of roads, and it is not our priority, but we have helped every step of the way. In terms of the park-and-ride, in my view, Mount Barker is a great success story. They have got everything right, except their local member.\n\nMr GOLDSWORTHY: They don't agree with you.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: They will in the future, don't worry. You leave the colonel there and we will get you. It is in a growth area. We do not have plans at the moment. I can say that the investment that went into it has been a great success. I think it is much better than—\n\nMr GOLDSWORTHY: It's full.\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: Yes. It is full because it is good. The trams are full because they are good. People like to catch them and people like to use the service. For the benefit of the member for Kavel, I can tell you that public transport facilities being full is what you want. That is why we build them. The measure of success in public transport are the people who use it—and people use the facility. When will we do something in the future? Well, that is something that we will look at.\n\nThere is no doubt that we consider Mount Barker to be one of the growth areas. The two obvious big growth areas are north of Mount Barker. For the benefit of the member for Mitchell, my own personal view is that we have probably gone pretty much as far south as we are going to. The north is where the action is in the future. We have to put people where the jobs are—that is a very good idea; you just cannot keep spreading yourself out like margarine over the plains—but there is no doubt that Mount Barker is one of the growth areas and the investment will follow.\n\nHowever, make no mistake, the system of contracting bus providers that your government put in place means that those investment decisions are not as simple as they would have been were it an entirely government structure, as it used to be. I am saying that we are not going back to an entirely government structure, but it is a different structure. It is a structure that you put in place, and it makes those investment decisions not just ours; they are investment decisions that are made in conjunction with service providers. In fact, I believe that Transitplus put a substantial amount of its money into the park-and-ride, which is a good thing—and good luck to it—but that is a different environment. The decisions are not all ours.\n\nMr HANNA: I refer to sub-program 2.1, Operating and Maintaining Roads. I note that there is nothing there about the Oaklands crossing, that is, the intersection of Diagonal and Morphett Roads and the Noarlunga railway line. Given the completion of the aquatic centre and the GP Plus community health centre, which is due next year, and the consequent increase in traffic, surely the Oaklands crossing grade separation will be bumped up further in the list of priorities?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: I certainly hope so. Can I tell you as the local member that one of the great frustrations of being the Minister for Transport is that you cannot just ask for what you want; you have to listen to their list of priorities, and that is the case. I would make myself enormously popular if I were to direct them to invest there instead of their other priorities, but I do not.\n\nHaving been around there for a long time yourself, you would know, as a great example, that the people on Morphett Road have been looking for lights at Cliff Street for years. I think every local member has written a letter about it. I remember that, when I got the job as Minister for Transport, I thought, 'Finally I get my lights.' I went and saw them and said, 'So, what about my lights down there?' I think it was Mark Elford who said to me, 'Well, we could do it, but we've got a list of priorities, and that's about 100 on the list. If you want us to move it up to number one, we could do that.' I said, 'Okay, I get the picture. I better not do that because it would look like I was taking advantage for my local electorate.'\n\nI would love you to be right, and that the guys in the department, as a result of those works, move it up the priority list. I have no doubt that there will be a grade separation at some point, as we have discussed in the past. There is some money in there for works in the meantime, as you would be aware. I think there is $1.7 million in 2011-12 and $10.85 million in 2012-13 to do some works around Prunus Street. It is an extraordinarily difficult intersection. I think from a traffic point of view, it is probably not as bad as it is from the point of view of the people using it. It is not a simple structure. I have no doubt that, at some time in the future, there will be a grade separation. I hope you are right—that the aquatic centre will move it up the list of priorities—because then I will be able to ask them to do it, but can I assure the member for Mitchell that I have not interfered with the department's list of priorities. I think that is for the best.\n\nThe CHAIR: The time for this session has now expired.\n\nMembership:\n\nHon. I.F. Evans substituted for Mr Venning.\n\nMr Williams substituted for Dr McFetridge.\n\nMrs Geraghty substituted for Mr Piccolo.\n\nDepartmental Advisers:\n\nMr Vince Duffy, Director, Markets and Sustainability, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMr Sean Kelly, Executive Director, Energy Division, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nMr Rob Faunt, Director, Energy Regulation, Energy Division, Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nThe ACTING CHAIR (Mr Rau): I now call on the Minister for Energy. I refer the committee to the Portfolio Statement, Volume 1, Part 6. Does the minister want to make a statement in relation to this area?\n\nThe Hon. P.F. CONLON: No; thank you.\n\nThe ACTING CHAIR: We are presently set down from now for a very long time. If the member does not take up all of that time, no-one will be outraged. It is a matter for you. Does the member for MacKillop want to make a statement and then begin his cross-examination of the minister?\n\nMr WILLIAMS: With regard to the time, having had the pleasure of conducting the examination of this minister on these budget lines for a number of years, I long ago came to the conclusion that two hours is more than sufficient for the examination of this portion of the budget. In fact, I sent an emissary to the minister several weeks ago suggesting that we cut the time in half and that some of that time be devoted to some of the minister's other passions, such as transport and infrastructure. However, the minister, to his credit, said that energy is so important, particularly now that the state does not own energy assets, that we should devote extensive time to the examination of what we no longer do. However, I will move on.\n\nI have managed to find some things about which I am sure the minister will be able to enlighten the committee, and we will all be better off for it. Minister, in the first instance, I refer to Budget Paper 3"
