        "text": "Peak travel is before 9am and after 3:01pm Monday-Friday, and all day Saturday.\n\nOff-peak is between 9:01am and 3pm Monday-Friday, and all day Sunday and public holidays.\n\nAdelaide Metro has a range of tickets and fares, the below information can help you decide which one is right for you:\n\nmetroCARD:\n\nA metroCARD is a rechargeable plastic card that you can use to travel on buses, trains and trams. We offer three different types of metroCARDs:\n\nRegular: For all users of public transport.\n\nConcession: For those travelling with proof of eligibility including full time tertiary and university students, and other government issued concession cardholders.\n\nStudent: For primary and secondary students.\n\nDay passes:\n\n14/28 day pass: This pass gives you unlimited travel on buses, trains and trams for 14 or 28 days. These can be loaded to all types of metroCARDs. These may be more economical if you use public transport several times per week.\n\nDaytrip pass: This pass gives you unlimited travel on all buses, trains and trams for a full day. You can load this pass to a metroCARD or you can purchase it through the Adelaide Metro Buy & Go app. This pass may be more economical if you will be using public transport multiple times in one day.\n\n3-day Visitor pass: This pass gives you unlimited travel on all buses, trains and trams for 3 days. You can load this pass to a metroCARD or you can purchase it through the Adelaide Metro Buy & Go app. This pass may be more economical if you will be using public transport multiple times over 3 consecutive days.\n\nTap and Pay:\n\nAdelaide Metro Tap and Pay allows you to pay with your Visa or Mastercard (credit/debit card or enabled smart phone or device) on buses, trams and only for trains departing from the Adelaide Railway Station. Tap your Visa or Mastercard to validate your fare. This may be a good option if you do not have concessions or a metroCARD, and do not use public transport regularly.\n\nBuy & Go app:\n\nThe Buy & Go app allows you to purchase tickets at any time. Buy & Go fares are the same as metroCARD fares. You can buy Regular, Concession and Student Singletrip, Dytrips and 3-day Visitor passes to be used on buses, trams and only for trains departing from the Adelaide Railway Station. The Buy & Go app is a good option if you are not a regular public transport user and don’t have a metroCARD.\n\nThese passes are loaded to a metroCARD and give you unlimited bus, train and tram travel for either 14 or 28 days in a row. This means they are good for people who use public transport most days of the week, as they work out cheaper than normal metroCARD fares.\n\nYou can add a pass to a metroCARD\n\nthrough your online metroCARD account (if you’ve registered the card with us)\n\nat the InfoCentre in the Adelaide Railway Station\n\nat metroCARD retailers or vending machines across Adelaide\n\nusing a vending machine on-board trains and trams\n\nby calling the InfoLine on 1300 311 108.\n\nWhen you add a pass to a metroCARD, it will start its countdown of days the next time the card is validated. You can’t pause a 14-day or 28-day pass – it will expire after its allocated time, no matter how many times or what days of the week you validate it.\n\nNo. Adelaide Metro buses are cashless and you cannot purchase tickets on board.\n\nTo pay for your fare with cash, you can buy a metroCARD in person, then either recharge it for access to best-value fares or load it with a Singletrip ticket.\n\nAlternatively, you can buy tickets on the Adelaide Metro Buy & Go app or Tap and Pay with your Visa or Mastercard (or smart device).\n\nWe can only track, cancel or replace registered metroCARDs.\n\nContact us to cancel your registered metroCARD as soon as you notice it is missing. If you have auto recharge setup on a metroCARD, cancel that, too. Either:\n\ncall our InfoLine on 1300 311 108\n\nvisit us at the InfoCentre Adelaide Railway Centre.\n\nIf your registered metroCARD is lost, stolen or damaged, we can transfer any remaining balance to a different metroCARD you own, or you can buy a new metroCARD and we will transfer it to that. When you buy a new card, you may also need to pay a bit extra to top up your balance to the nearest $5.\n\nPaper MetroTickets cannot be registered or replaced if they are lost or stolen."
