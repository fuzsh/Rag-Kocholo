        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nColorectal adenocarcinoma represents one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies throughout the world [1]. This cancer commonly develops within adenomatous polyps following the adenoma–carcinoma sequence. Consequently, early in carcinogenesis, cancer may be restricted to being within a polyp—thus termed a malignant polyp. Malignant polyps are defined as any macroscopically complete endoluminal resection of an adenoma that contains a focus of adenocarcinoma, which invades through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa [2, 3, 4]. Furthermore, malignant cells must be seen to be invading into the submucosa (excluding intramucosal carcinoma), and those cancers invading beyond the submucosa (i.e., T2 or higher) are no longer considered malignant polyps [2, 4].\n\nThe management of malignant polyps poses a dilemma. Historically management was for all patients to undergo a colorectal resection ensuring complete excision of all draining nodes as well as the polypectomy site [4]. However, few patients had residual disease in the bowel wall or lymphovascular metastasis. It was, and is therefore, of interest to determine which patients were at risk of residual disease. A number of pathological factors have been described which increase the risk of either residual disease or metastatic disease to draining lymph nodes [5]. These have been summarized in various guidelines, including those of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) [5].\n\nThe ACPGBI guidelines grade the risk of residual disease (either residual disease in the bowel wall or lymphatic disease) from very low to very high, in five categories. The factors which influence this grade are the status of the polypectomy resection margin, the depth of invasion assessed by either Haggitt or Kikuchi levels, the presence of poor tumour differentiation, mucinous differentiation in the tumour, the presence of tumour budding and any lymphovascular invasion [5]. The ACPGBI guidelines calculate the grade of risk by summing the presence of the above criteria, based on the individual risk contributed to the presence of residual or lymphatic disease (Table S1). In Grades 0 and 1 (very low or low) the guidelines recommend routine follow‐up. In Grades 3 and 4 (high and very high risk), the guidelines recommend to err towards surgery or recommend surgery [5].\n\nWhilst guidelines are important for assisting clinicians to make a recommendation for surgery, individual patient preferences and systemic risk factors need to be considered in treatment decisions. Thus, when confronted with the diagnosis of a malignant polyp, clinicians and patients must balance the risks of surgery against the likelihood of residual disease or metastatic spread.\n\nIt is of interest to know how patients with a malignant polyp are being managed. In Queensland, Australia, reporting of all malignancies to the Queensland Cancer Registry is mandated by law. These data are managed by the Cancer Alliance Queensland, which links the data from the Queensland Cancer Registry with over 60 other population level sources including hospital admissions, treatment, public and private pathology and mortality data into the Queensland Oncology Repository (QOR). By accessing this combined repository, a complete population‐wide analysis of malignant polyps can be performed.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis study assessed the contemporary management of malignant polyps and specifically how management decisions varied based on risk as assessed by the ACPGBI guidelines. This study is one of the few population‐wide analyses of the management of malignant polyps [4, 11, 12, 13, 14], with only four known previous population‐wide analyses being completed since 1985 [4]. It also represents one of the largest cohorts of malignant polyps reported [11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], with the majority of other investigations on the management of malignant polyps having less than 1000 malignant polyps investigated [4]. There have only been two larger cohort studies [14, 16] published since 1985, and neither of these represented population‐wide analyses of malignant polyps [4].\n\nTo date no other malignant polyp database has been interrogated to assess compliance with the ACPGBI guidelines [4]. It was noted that there was a large proportion of patients in either the low risk or very low risk of residual disease groups (32.28%) who proceeded to resection, despite the recommendations of the ACPGBI guidelines for observational follow‐up. Likewise, there was also a large proportion (35.86%) of patients with high or very high risk of residual disease who did not have a resection.\n\nThe mean age at diagnosis was a significant predictor of those with low and very low risk disease proceeding to a resection, despite guidelines suggesting otherwise. This suggests that some clinicians may have recommended that young patients, for whom surgery was not indicated in the guidelines, proceed to surgery simply due to their age and their anticipated life span.\n\nThere was a significant association between management strategy and location of the malignant polyp in both the low risk and the high risk groups. It is generally accepted that left sided and rectal resections pose a greater surgical risk to patients including being associated with increased risk of anastomotic leaks, stoma, sexual dysfunction and conversion from a laparoscopic to an open procedure [26]. Furthermore the long‐term sequelae of rectal resection include long‐term functional changes such as incontinence, impotence and low anterior resection syndrome [27]. These risks may be the reason that clinicians appear to be more likely to recommend observation in patients with left sided or rectal disease, even in high risk disease. Right sided colorectal resection is typically considered a less technically demanding procedure [28], and it could be considered that surgeons may be more inclined to offer resection for right sided disease when the clinical indications are not as compelling.\n\nFurthermore, left colonic and rectal disease can be more easily surveilled with flexible sigmoidoscopy compared to colonoscopy for right sided malignant polyps, avoiding the increased risk from the procedure and also the requirement for mechanical bowel preparation [29]. These considerations may have contributed to clinicians appearing more likely to recommend observation in patients with left sided or rectal disease, even in high risk disease.\n\nColorectal resection is a major procedure, with significant short‐ and long‐term risks [27]. Surgical morbidity and mortality are correlated with patient's comorbidities and thus the ability to tolerate major physiological stresses such as colorectal surgery [10]. The ASA score is a surrogate measure of the number and severity of patient comorbidities and can assist in estimating perioperative risk [10]. This study demonstrated that, in low risk polyps, the ASA score made no significant difference to management choice. This is logical in that clinicians are not likely to simply offer a resection to a patient with a malignant polyp because they are surgically low risk from a morbidity or mortality perspective. In the high risk polyp group, ASA differed significantly between the management strategies, however, only in the univariable analysis. ASA score was not significant in any of the multivariable analyses. Likewise, when analysing the raw count of the documented comorbidities, in the multivariable analysis there were no significant differences between the treatment groups. This is unexpected: it was hypothesized that, in the high risk polypectomy group, medically comorbid patients would be less likely to be offered surgery as the risk of surgery would have been higher than the risk of residual or metastatic disease in some patients. An explanation may be that hospital coding did not completely document relevant comorbidities for these patients. Evidence of incomplete capture of comorbidities using hospital admission and discharge coding data has been documented by other authors throughout the world [30, 31].\n\nThe location of the health facility where the colonoscopy was performed was of interest, whether it be in a metropolitan location or a regional/rural location. The definition of metropolitan area encompassed all but one of the tertiary referral hospitals and all of the quaternary hospitals within the state. Those with high risk disease and who had their colonoscopy performed in a regional/rural setting were significantly less likely to proceed to resection relative to those who had it performed in a metropolitan setting. However, this was only on univariable assessment; on multivariable modelling, location of the colonoscopy was no longer significant (P = 0.35; Table ). This may reflect those living regionally, outside of a metropolitan area, having other variables that are the predictor of proceeding to resection rather than the location of where the colonoscopy was performed. However, it may also be the reflection of smaller numbers available to multivariable analysis due to missing pathology details. It may be that a study with higher statistical power or a study with fewer missing pathology details may find the location of colonoscopy a significant predictor of management strategy, with those in a regional/rural setting being less likely to proceed to resection. Regardless, there may be additional reasons why management strategy differs depending on patient location. These may include those living regionally having poorer access to health services, health services not being available close to patients' residence and patients not wishing to travel long distances for health services away from personal support networks. Additionally, if services were available close to home, there are likely to be fewer subspecialist colorectal surgeons in that area, which may mean less understanding, by those clinicians, of the ACPGBI or other similar guidelines. It is likely that improvements to clinician education, especially where access to subspecialty surgical services is limited, would improve patient care.\n\nA limitation of this study is the number of missing pathology details documented. It was noted that budding and a Haggitt/Kikuchi level were the most underreported pathological features. Accurate assessment of the risk of residual or lymphatic metastatic disease is vital for clinicians to advise appropriate management strategies. This hampered the accurate assessment of the ACPGBI risk scoring, and probably resulted in the under‐calling of the risk of the malignant potential of polyps with a large number of missing pathology details. It is noted that clinicians would have equally been unable to accurately assess these malignant polyps' risk of residual or metastatic disease, given that these pathology reports are the same reports delivered to clinicians. Additionally, the large number of missing pathology details influenced the ability to perform highly powered multivariable logistic regression modelling. This may have affected the overall power and ability to detect significant differences. It was demonstrated that the average number of missing pathological features decreased through the study period. A thorough assessment of missing pathological factors warrants a comprehensive quality assurance review, to identify whether there are any trends which could explain underreporting of histopathological features. The authors are now progressing with this review, with the results to be reported in the literature.\n\nThe comorbidity count used along with ASA scores are crude measures of patient perioperative surgical risk. It is likely, however, that more nuanced measures of comorbidities would potentially provide a better appreciation of those who were offered surgery compared to those who had polypectomy and surveillance alone. Whilst the list of comorbidities collated in the QOR were aligned with the Charlson Comorbidity Index, they were not recorded in the QOR in a format which facilitated calculation of a Charlson Comorbidity Index. Lastly, whilst piecemeal excision of a malignant polyp is considered an indication for colorectal resection, this was not available to be assessed from the histopathological reporting. Without access to the original colonoscopy procedural reports, this detail could not be assessed.\n\nIndividual patient and surgeon discussions are the cornerstone of patient‐centred clinical practice and these nuanced discussions are not accessible. Whilst guidelines provide clinical understanding of risks to individual patients, patient autonomy in the management of malignant polyps cannot be understated. Clinicians may consider a malignant polyp to be high risk, but this may not be the case from the patient's perspective. Furthermore, balancing this risk against the potentially long‐term sequelae of colorectal resection, especially left sided and rectal resection, may mean patients with high risk disease do not consider a resection to be in their best interests, even when they are young with few comorbidities. Unfortunately, this level of detail is not available in current population‐wide analyses on the management of malignant polyps."
