        "text": "To keep you safe while using public transport, our employees:\n\nWill not physically remove or try to remove a person from an Adelaide Metro train, station, depot or other work location even if they are causing trouble or may be a danger to other passengers.\n\nWill not request or remove a child or youth from an Adelaide Metro train, station, depot or other work location at any time.\n\nWill ensure that the removal of a child or youth (aged 14 years or under) can only be undertaken by a South Australian Police Officer.\n\nWill consider whether a person has an intellectual disability or impaired capacity prior to action being taken.\n\nRemember, if you see behaviour that is suspicious or harmful to your safety, or anyone else’s, please report it to one of our employees, the driver, station/gate attendant or passenger services attendant, the SA Police or online through our “See it? Report it!” reporting system or the Crime Stoppers website.\n\nIf you are feeling unsafe on-board public transport, try to move to a different seat or closer to the driver. If that is not possible, press the stop button and once the vehicle has stopped moving, approach the driver and tell them what is happening.\n\nIf you’re on a train or tram, use the passenger emergency intercom located in every carriage. Once the driver stops, they’ll answer the intercom, check the CCTV to see where you are and talk to you.\n\nDon’t forget, drivers are not security guards or police. As well as keeping themselves safe on-board, they need to stay in their seat close to the emergency button and their communications radio. Drivers will contact their control centre to arrange help from police, ambulance or security services, if needed.\n\nAll Adelaide Metro bus, train and trams have onboard video surveillance. More than 1,300 cameras are across the network, including bus interchanges and train stations. We continue to install and upgrade surveillance systems for better coverage and to help police with investigations.\n\nWe work closely with SA Police to maintain a safe and security environment. Plain-clothed and uniformed police officers regularly move through the public transport network. Police can travel for free on public transport and can intervene at any time.\n\nContracted security services and guards also work across the public transport network. Their services include:\n\nroving security guards,\n\nmobile security patrols at night,\n\nnight guard patrols on trains,\n\nnight guard patrols on trams on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays,\n\ndog patrols,\n\nmonitoring video surveillance.\n\n24-hour emergency phones are available at stations. Using these phones alerts security staff to monitor the cameras in the area around the phone."
