        "text": "The National Rail Safety Regular has accredited Keolis Downer as an operator of heavy rail services, ahead of the handover of Adelaide Metro train services to the private operator on January 31.\n\nThe accreditation paves the way for operations to begin on schedule, said Sandra Wilson-Ryke, Keolis Downer’s HSQE director.\n\n“The accreditation process has proceeded according to an agreed schedule, in close consultation with ONRSR. We are very pleased about the way we have collaborated with the safety regulator throughout this process.”\n\nAs the first heavy rail operating contract for the joint venture, Keolis Downer is required to be accredited by the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR). Keolis operates heavy rail networks in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and the United States.\n\nWilson-Ryke, who was responsible for safety, quality and environment at Keolis Downer’s light rail operations on the Gold Coast, said that the company would be applying its knowledge and history to the Adelaide network.\n\n“We have safety accreditation in place in all our operations and a strong safety culture at all levels of the organisation. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the safety regulator and operate the rail service in Adelaide at the highest standards.”\n\nWilson-Ryke, who grew up in Adelaide, said that she was looking forward to driving safety culture in her home city.\n\n“I grew up in Adelaide and I am delighted to be leading safety for the delivery of the Adelaide Metro rail services. This contract has given me the opportunity to come back home, bringing with me a breadth of experience and knowledge that will enable us to develop a strong safety culture, and deliver better services for the benefit of local communities."
