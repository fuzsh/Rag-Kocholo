        "text": "The Belair to Bridgewater Train line is a former passenger train line that terminated in 1987. Although it shut down for public access, the train line is still operational for commercial reasons\n\nIt shut down when the more direct South Eastern Freeway opened in the 1960s, dramatically decreased Bridgewater business, as more people had access to cars and the car journey was much quicker and shorter. In 1985, the State Transport Authority sought to have the service withdrawn, attributed to high cost of operation and low passenger numbers. All stations beyond Belair were closed and all suburban trains now terminate at Belair.\n\nIt has now been 28 years since this railway line was shut down to the public. Now I'm sure that I am not the only Hills dweller, who finds it extremely hard to find my way around Adelaide with very few buses running, at a high cost that takes hours to get from one destination to the other. For those who have cars, it is made easier-- but even so, for families with one car, it is impossible for both parents to get to their designated location without a car.\n\nNow, I myself have been struggling with the issue for some time that I have no access to a car, unless someone can drive me – or I have to walk to bus stops and catch them for approximately 2 hours to get to another location in the foot hills. I am sure that I not the only one who suffers with a similar issue, or even more constraints.\n\nMy solution is that the Public Train line from Belair to Bridgewater reopens. At the moment there is one bus line that runs from Crafers to Blackwood. Even so, it online runs in the early morning and late afternoon. It does not travel via other hills suburbs, making it a greater distance for some. By reopening the train line, I believe that it will help promote the following\n\n- Employment opportunities for new train drivers, maintenance, security and workers at each of the stops\n\n- Tourism Revenue; for those who are not familiar to Adelaide, and also don't have a hire car, a train is a perfect and easy accessible way to travel into the hills and experience the magic in many iconic hills locations such as Mt Lofty, Stirling, Hahndorf and many more.\n\n- Create an easy access for local citizens of both those who live in the foot hills and the hills. To travel to and from, whether it be work, friends, family, shopping etc it would become an easy and fast way to travel in comparison to having to catch 2-3 buses over a course of 2 hours costing a lot less for the travellers, especially the regular ones. Also for those elderly citizens whom can no longer drive, a train is a great way for travelling safely.\n\n- It makes sense that there are already multiple train lines running throughout Adelaide, that there should be another one connecting the city with the hills.\n\nSo please, help me and all the citizens of Adelaide and those visiting, to make transport in the city and hills more accessible and affordable by signing this petition and capturing the attention of the City and Hills Council to re-open the Belair to Bridgewater Train line!!"
