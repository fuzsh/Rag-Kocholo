        "text": "1. Background\n\nApproximately 1.35 millions per year are killed in road crashes throughout the globe, and 54% of those deaths occur among vulnerable road-users including walkers, cyclists and motorcycle riders (Moran et al., 2019; World Health, 2018). With 4.26 deaths per 100,000 people in 2020, Australia was ranked 20th out of the 38 OECD countries in terms of its death rate due to road crashes (BITRE, 2022).\n\nMany countries instituted lockdown rules as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, with the goal of reducing the number of people who had to travel long distances for job, school, shopping, entertainment, and health-related purposes (Wegman and Katrakazas, 2021). While the COVID-19 closure has lowered average traffic flow, producing traffic congestion, it has also led to an increase in speeding, which will definitely increase the severity of crashes as well as the number of deaths and severe injuries. Consequently, a significant decline in the number of deadly crashes is less expected (Barnes et al., 2022). There are indications of diverse changes in the drop of crash-causing drivers, with a smaller decline among male and non-white drivers aged 25 to 64 in Louisiana (Barnes et al., 2022).\n\nThe number of people travelling throughout the globe declined. Mobility was cut by as much as 60 percent in certain very crowded areas (Huang and Zuniga-Garcia, 2022). Congestion in major European cities including Paris, Milan, Manchester, and Madrid dropped by an average of 80% during the quarantine era, in comparison with the previous year (Chand et al., 2021). Increases in the percentage of commutes made without the use of a motor vehicle are particularly noteworthy. Since there is less traffic on the roads, there have been fewer deaths and injuries (Soltani and Askari, 2014).\n\nAn empirical investigation reveals that the lockdown restrictions have dramatically decreased crashes, deaths, and injuries in Turkey, with fatality or injury down 35%, fatality down 72%, whilst injuries declined 19% (Oguzoglu, 2020). Compared to the preceding five years, the number of crashes in Qatar during the COVID-19 period was much smaller. However, the rates of fatal and serious injuries increased significantly (Alhajyaseen et al., 2022). According to (Katrakazas et al., 2020), the lockdown after the COVID-19 has altered driving behaviour in Greece and Saudi Arabia. Despite the shorter distances travelled, the average driving speed boosted by 11 percent, and a bigger proportion of trips were made while using a mobile phone while driving.\n\nAfter the lockdown was implemented in Connecticut (Doucette et al., 2021), performed a time series study and observed a 2.29-fold increase in the single-vehicle crash frequency. According to the authors, the rate of fatal single-vehicle crashes rose dramatically by 4.10 times. Due to the decreased traffic levels, the authors hypothesised that risky driving behaviours, such as speeding, would be more prevalent during COVID-19. In 2020 research conducted in the United States for the state of Alabama, speeding, driving while fatigued, and failure to wear a seatbelt were shown to be the leading causes of serious injury crashes in rural regions. The influence of these characteristics on crash outcomes did not vary from year to year. This indicates that the lockdown regulations did not affect how people drove (Adanu et al., 2022).\n\nAn Australian research revealed that the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown from March to August 2020 did not decrease road fatalities proportionately. During the travel limitations from March to August, road fatalities in Australia only dropped by 8%, despite a reduction of up to 30% in road usage (Catchpole and Naznin, 2020). According to (Christey et al., 2020), the lockdown policy in New Zealand has decreased the frequency and severity of traffic crashes significantly. A similar result was obtained after the lockdown regulations were implemented in Spain, although the evidence indicated that this reduction was more effective for vulnerable road-users. After the adoption of shutdown regulations in the Czech Republic, vulnerable road-users including pedestrians and cyclists had a greater crash rate compared to motorists (European Transport Safety Council, 2020). In Northern Ireland, UK, crashes involving pedestrians and motorcyclists were less severe than crashes involving car passengers (Yasin et al., 2021).\n\nAs previously mentioned, the frequency of crashes caused by speeding rose following the COVID-19 lockdown. In many instances, it is believed that drivers were more aggressive and less attentive to their driving behaviour, leading to more severe crashes (Shaik and Ahmed, 2022). In addition, the proportion of trips to work and school has decreased significantly, notwithstanding a shift from public transportation to private car use among people who go to these places (Shaik and Ahmed, 2022). According to (Zhang et al., 2021), the proportion of regular journeys to work continued to have a considerable influence on the incidence of car crashes over the COVID-19 era. When compared to previous years, however, the frequency of deaths and injuries caused by cyclists has more than doubled (Li and Zhao, 2022). The COVID-19 lockdown has lowered the rate of crashes, but it has also been linked to a rise in the severity of crashes, in particular those involving rapid acceleration or sudden stops (Chand et al., 2021).\n\nShorter distances between the start and end points and less total walking throughout the route are two ways in which population and activity density may cut down on walking time. There is a substantial correlation between walkability and factors including land use diversity, job and transit access, and junction density (Azmoodeh et al., 2021). Policies that promote congestion, mixing land uses, and public transportation may indirectly raise the risk of crashes for those who rely disproportionately on walking as a mode of mobility (Lee et al., 2020).\n\nIt is unclear whether or not the pattern of land use activities is related to the frequency of crashes (Saha et al., 2020). The presence of commercial strip operations along major arterials and mixed-use projects is correlated with an increase in the frequency of crashes, especially those affecting pedestrians. However, the severity of crashes might be mitigated by lowering traffic speeds resulting from the presence of mixed land use (Lee et al., 2020). When compared to previous years, however, the frequency of deaths and injuries caused by cyclists has more than doubled (Li and Zhao, 2022). The COVID-19 lockdown has lowered the rate of crashes, but it has also been linked to a rise in the severity of crashes, in particular those involving rapid acceleration or sudden stops (Chand et al., 2021).\n\nBuilt environment factors including residential density; street network connectivity; and land use mix have been considered as major determinants of human mobility behaviour (Christian et al., 2011; Javadpoor et al., 2023; Soltani et al., 2022). Pedestrian crashes may rise with the proportion of businesses to housing units, the density of roadways per built-up area, and the number of crosswalks (Soltani and Askari, 2017). Intersections have the potential to slow down traffic by blocking off alternative routes, but they also have the ability to raise speeds if the conditions are right. Car and pedestrian crashes and traffic crashes are more likely when regional arteries and other types of roads are present, when there are more lanes and routes for vehicles, and when there is a greater number and density of intersections of various types, a shorter sidewalk, and fewer or fewer public transportation stations (Soltani and Askari, 2014; Qiao et al., 2020).\n\nAdditionally, demographic variables like age, car ownership, family size, and household income are linked to crash rates since they influence both where individuals start their journeys and where they end them (Munawar et al., 2021).\n\nSeveral studies, for instance, have looked at the socioeconomic and racial disparities that exist among those involved in crashes. Pedestrians in low-income communities are more expected to be damaged in crashes due to the absence of safe infrastructure. Suburban neighbourhoods are sometimes deemed undesirable for walkers, despite the fact that wealthy regions may have well-organized roadways, traffic signals, and pedestrian facilities (Apardian & Smirnov, 2020; Qiao et al., 2020). People who live in affluent areas are often thought to be more cautious and drive safer cars. Because they can't afford a car, residents of low-income areas are more vulnerable against car crashes because they have no choice but to walk (Apardian & Smirnov, 2020).\n\nIn addition, a strong positive association between population density and fatal crashes is expected (Gálvez-Pérez et al., 2022). Further, statistics show that households with more members have a lower likelihood of overall, perhaps because elderly individuals are often accompanied by younger relatives (Soltani et al., 2018). Since young generation are more motivated to take risks when driving, the share of the population aged 18 and under is positively correlated with deadly crashes (Huang et al., 2010). However, there are contrasting findings in other situations, such as when neighbourhoods with larger numbers of elderly persons have more traffic crashes overall (Aguero-Valverde and Jovanis, 2006).\n\nIn conclusion, the existing literature on COVID-19 and crash has primarily focused on the patterns of crash occurrence as well as the impacts of lockdown policies on the crash frequency or severity, while the role that urban structure attributes play in moderating the crashes has received less attention. In addition, the role of these physical characteristics and other possible determinants of crashes, such as driver personal characteristics and attitudes, road system quality, and other environmental contributing elements over the era has been explored seldom. For instance, the land mix as an urban structural characteristic would play a distinct function before and after COVID-19, since the variety and quality of activities happening before COVID-19 had altered.\n\nConsequently, the aim of this paper is to comprehend the geographical and temporal differences in the two sets of urban structure and demographic parameters linked with crash frequency throughout two time periods in the Adelaide metropolitan area. Consequently, the following two research questions are posed:\n\na)\n\nWhat are the variations in geographical and temporal patterns of crashes in the study region before and after COVID-19?\n\nb)\n\nWhat possible impact do urban structure elements play in reducing crash incidence with the implementation of COVID-19 regulations?\n\nIn order to address these questions, we have gathered and analysed a broad array of geographical, demographic, and crash data for metropolitan Adelaide from 2019 to 2021 using modern statistical and geospatial methodologies. In this study, the response variable is the difference in crash frequency between before and after COVID-19.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Differences in crash characteristics, before and after the COVID-19\n\ncompares the percentage of crash-involving parameters for two pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic periods in Adelaide, Australia. In general, total crashes have shown a 6.7% reduction (Nbefore = 12,801, Nafter = 11,933) in the same period (Chi-square = 0.157, sig. <0.05), which proves that there is no significant difference in the proportions of crashes. The values imply that the COVID-19 travel restriction rules around the city have not significantly decreased the total number of crashes ( - a). Similarly, according to ( - b) the zonal distribution of crashes has remained partially unchanged (Chi-square = 0.053).\n\nThe distribution of crashes on weekdays, though, shows some noticeable results. -c shows except for Wednesday all working days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) have shown a reduction in the percentage of crashes. That is mainly because of the vast job closures that applied with the onset of the pandemic, and also most employers turn to remote working. On the other hand, weekends show a controversial trend, as the percentages of crashes have increased for Sunday and Monday. Since people who have been mostly stayed almost all days of the week working at home had a chance to spend some leisure time outside the city to stay away from the crowds, as the main source of disease transmission; therefore it leads to more conflicts and crashes subsequently (Chi-squaredays = 0.028).\n\nMoreover, the share of crashes over months exhibits two different trends ( - d). First, by reminding that the COVID-19 restrictions were implemented in late March 2020, the first three next months (April, May, and June) have shown a significant drop in the percentage of crashes that is primarily because of the application of lockdown rules, similar to the pattern for working weekdays. On the contrary, the following months show a general increase that finally intensifies in March 2021. This general increase has simultaneously happened with dispelling fear of COVID-19 and the need to be out of home, even under some restrictions like physical distancing rules (Chi-squaremonths≈ 0.00) (Chand et al., 2021).\n\nThe findings for the crash severity factor (Chi-squareseverity = 0.31) indicate that the severity of crashes has been reduced after the pandemic, such that though property damage only (PDO) crashes have been raised, more severe types of collisions (mild injury (MI), Serious injury (SI), and Fatal) have been all decreased. These results imply that COVID-19 may have affected risky driving habits, as it has brought more cautiousness to peoples’ everyday life ( - e).\n\nAdditionally, while the results for impaired driving under the influence of drugs (Chi-squaredrug = 0.318) are not significant, driving while intoxicated by alcohol (Chi-squarealcohol≈ 0.00) is perceptible; such that ( - f) indicates that the proportion of crashes in the latter group has been meaningfully increased.\n\nFinally, the last results for light condition (Chi-squarelight = 0.072), traffic controls (Chi-squarecontrols = 0.431), area speed limit (Chi-squarespeed = 0.385), and gender (Chi-squaregender = 0.431) have not shown significant change after the pandemic outbreak in Adelaide.\n\n3.2. Modeling the effects of pandemic on crash frequency\n\nIn this section, via developing a GLM model, we intend to statistically examine how socio-demographic and urban structural factors would affect the number of crashes in 3016 census blocks of Adelaide city before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe outcomes of the proposed GLM model are detailed in . The table shows the GLM coefficient (β) along with its significance for 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 levels. Generally, the result of the Omnibus Test for the model (Mdif = 845.033***) indicates that the current GLM model outperforms the null model, and shows improvement over the baseline model. Moreover, the overall goodness-of-fit report (AICMdif = 18844.431, and BICMdif = 18916.571) reveals the model properly fits the data.\n\nTable 2\n\nParameterMdifββ/Std.(Intercept)5.982***10.194Socio-demographicsCBD_income−0.150***−10.949Average household size−3.668***−19.0355 years resident−0.019***−4.318Born overseas0.006***3.529Working Age0.021***11.667Urban StructureDistance to PT0.368***5.618Distance to major roads−0.175***10.174Land use mix2.195***3.483Count intersections0.013***8.125Distance to CBD−0.596***8.477Omnibus Test845.033***AIC18844.431BIC18916.571df3005N3016\n\n“Landuse Mix (lum)” shows a significant positive effect on the frequency of crashes, which indicates, considering all the other predictor variables are constant, higher land use mixedness leads to a greater number of crashes occurring in the blocks. That is because traffic-generating activities in mixeduse zones cause more pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, and due to age-related physiological decline in the decision-making process, the frequency of crashes will increase in these areas (Su et al., 2021; Soltani and Askari, 2014, Sze et al., 2019). Also, mixed land use areas, as physically and functionally integrated parts of CBDs, cause cognitive or visual distraction and make people especially older adults more likely to make mistakes in complex situations where conflicts are high. In addition, the number of conflicts exacerbates due to the parking management around these areas, such that on-street parkings will increase high-risk vehicle interactions due to the distraction in the traffic flow. This is also correlated with the effect of the “Distance to CBD (dst_cbd)'' parameter on crash counts. In the block with a lower distance to CBDs (βMdif = −0.596***), where the traffic congestion is compelled by the population working in the CBDs, and the shortage of off-street parking facilities, a higher number of crashes occurred due to a higher vehicle interaction in these areas. Moreover, the results of “CBD_Income (cbd_incm)” (βMdif = −0.15***) reveal that blocks with more well-off groups located in the suburbs benefit from a lower crash count. Besides living far from the CBD, these groups have probably used more delivery services due to their higher income; therefore, a slight increase in β coefficient after the pandemic could also be evidence of this claim (Gálvez-Pérez et al., 2022).\n\n“Average Household Size (hh_sz)” is the most effective regressor, which provides a significant negative correlation with crash counts (βMdif = −3.668***), therefore the results indicate that for a higher average number of people living in a household, crashes are less likely to occur. There was an increased likelihood of nonspecific injuries in large households. Insurance and alcohol use are correlated with household size. The risk of various injuries is proportional to the size of the household. The interplay between Passing Rules and household size reveals that the associated weight of violating the rules of passing another vehicle tends to decrease as the number of persons in a household grows (Machado-León et al., 2016). Furthermore, people married or living with a partner are much more likely to observe driving safety rules due to family commitement.\n\nCrash frequencies are also influenced by “Distance to major roads (dst_mrds)” as the second noticeable urban structure variable, whereas getting closer to secondary arterial roads in Adelaide will result in a higher number of crashes (βMdif = −0.175***). Since the pandemic lockdown and remote working have encouraged people to stay at home, the effect of this variable has been reduced (≈7%). Similarly, the significant positive correlation of crash counts with the “Count Intersection (cnt_intrsc)” variable is due to the increase in crash units’ (vehicle, bike, pedestrian) interactions, which affect the probability of crashes occurring. Lower crash rates were seen at intersections located along roadways with slower average speeds than at higher speeds; at crossroads situated along two-way roads, under elevated highways, and in close proximity, crash rates were reported to be higher (Xie et al., 2013). (LaScala et al., 2000) observed that in locations with a larger number of cross-streets per kilometre of roads, pedestrian crash casualties were higher. Higher density of road crossings or major roadways were correlated with higher traffic crashes (Mitra and Buliung, 2014). The count of crash attributable to driving error was greater at crossings with traffic control than at intersections without traffic control, but the frequency of crashes attributable to pedestrian error was simply greater at signalised intersections. The data indicate that more pedestrian crashes occur in metropolitan areas when motorists disregard traffic signals and signs while pedestrians obey them (Lee and Abdel-Aty, 2005).\n\nAnother significant transport-related predictor of the models is “Distance to PT (dst_pt)” which shows that the number of crashes reduces in the locality of public transport stations (βMdif = 0.36***). This relationship is rooted in both safety considerations and the travel behaviour of people. Because public transport stations are usually located in spots with a lower area speed limit, or a specific area around the stations is controlled by traffic calming strategies to reduce traffic flow and the risk of crash.\n\nOther socio-demographic variables are also significant, “5year_Resident (res_rcrd)” and “Born Overseas Population (bp_ovrsz).” Census blocks with more residents with five years of residency record are less likely to experience crashes, according to the “5year_Resident (res_rcrd)” results (βMdif = −0.019***). In other words, the experience of at least five years of living in a neighbourhood will increase environmental knowledge about the high-risk spots where traffic crashes have historically been concentrated, and it helps people to decrease PRT, so they can predict the potential conflicts in certain areas and avoid crashes by making proper decisions. However, the situation is not the same for “Born Overseas Population (bp_ovrsz)'' (βMdif = 0.006***), since the overseas-born people, who have adopted with regulations and driving culture of their native country, are more likely to show risky behaviour and cause a higher number of crashes.\n\n3.3. Kernel Density\n\nThe Kernel density estimation computes the density of features in their immediate surroundings (Koloushani et al., 2021). The crash density map generated by the Kernel model depicts the change in geographical position and the frequency of people's crash hotspots in the metropolitan area. In certain ways, the density of crashes is higher in the central area for both periods. In terms of crash density, Adelaide's central area remained the dominant area in both the pre- and post-COVID-19 eras, with higher crash frequencies appeard closer together ( ).\n\n3.4. GWGLM analysis\n\nIn contrast to the GLM model, which has an exclusive estimation for each variable, the variable estimates for a GWGLM model differ throughout space and may provide unexpected results. Each variable has an apparent pattern of spatial variation. For most variables, the effect of the variable is stronger in three main spots: the central area (CBD), the area near major job hubs, and the area near recration activities. The coefficients for certain variables (Average household size, Distance to major roads, Born overseas, Working age) were compatible with the GLM model, whereas others were not. So in the GWGLM model they are used for analysis.\n\nFor two periods: before and after COVID-19 and their difference that is more important in this article the variables including Born overseas, CBD_income, and working-age variable almost exhibit positive sign for every local estimate. For both periods, the variables of Average household size, Distance to PT, and Distance to major roads always exhibit negative signs for the whole of local estimates. Furthermore, the signs of the following coefficients: Distance to CBD, Count intersection and Land Use mix were not always consistent. These variables were shown to have both positive and negative associations.\n\nThe proportion of people of working age has a positive association with the crash difference between after and before COVID-19 in the central and near major job hubs. The average household size has a negative relationship with crash frequency in all sections, and it is greater in the north-west and south. Born-overseas has a positive link with crash frequency difference and western and northern parts of Adelaide have a stronger sign than others.\n\nDistance to public transit shows a negative link with crash frequency difference in the centre region, but a modest correlation in the remainder of the metropolitan area. It is more prevalent in far southern suburbs (for example, Onkaparinga, Aldinga, and Willunga). Distance to major roadways is both negative and positive for urban areas. It is positive in the CBD and southern part of Adelaide and even in Salisbury, but in other parts, it is negative. It is particularly abundant along the A1, A3, and M2 highways. The greater the degree of land use variety in a block, the greater the count of crashes. It implies that locations in the south-central, east-central, and west-central had more crashes than other areas prior to COVID-19. After the COVID-19 period, the trend remained consistent, except for the southern area. The number of intersections in blocks shows both positive and negative relationships with crash risk, with focus on eastern and central parts of Adelaide with the strongest positive sign. The association between the distance to CBD and crash frequency difference for the central area such as CBD and near Marion and Blackwood are positive linkage and the southern, northern and eastern parts are negative, CBD-Income variable had a positive correlation, with greater coefficients in the central, northern and western areas.\n\nThe sign's contradiction is described as “the difficulty with counterintuitive signs” (Pirdavani et al., 2014). One probable cause of this problem is the occurrence of multicollinearity among particular variables in some places. Some factors may be locally related in some areas, but no global multicollinearity among the explanatory variables are discovered. Prior to COVID-19, GWGLM analysis had the strongest explanatory power, and it was greater in the north-western, western and southern areas of Adelaide (0.75 < Local R2 < 0.94). However, this power was reduced in the north-eastern and eastern areas of Adelaide (0.28 < Local R2 < 0.75). Based on this finding, the highest negative changes in crash frequency due to COVID-19 lockdown occurred in business and industry clusters primarily located in the north (e.g. Elizabeth and Salisbury), north-west (Port Adelaide), and south-west (Lonsdale), as well as the Adelaide airport adjacent area, and educational-technical sites including Bedford Park and Tonesly (Flinders University), and Maswon Lakes UniSA's Campus and Technology Park. In contrast, the largest positive changes in crash frequency occurred in peripheral green areas and recreational places such as Stirling, Hahndorf, and Aldgate in the east, Vista in the north-east, and certain beaches like Christies Beach and Semaphore in the west.\n\nA summary of the signs of variables and the significance of their impact on crash frequency is provided in .\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis research was aimed to determine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on the percentage, severity, time, and location of occurred crashes by investigating statistical and spatial crash data. One statistical and one geographical methodologies were employed, and the effect of several socio-demographic and urban structure-related elements were systematically studied. The insights learned from this research may be used as evidence for discussions on the impact of regulating restrictions on Australian road safety in order to make cities safer places to live and work, and as a guide for designing better transport networks elsewhere.\n\nThe interaction between the road environment, driver behaviour and personal profile, road traffic volume and congestion will explain the differences in crash incidence and severity across geographic regions. This article evaluated the difference in crash frequency before and after COVID-19, and showed that lockdown orders resulted in a slight decrease (about 7%) in crash frequency. However, this decrease does not necessarily resolve issues about traffic safety in the Greater Adelaide Metropolitan Area. While the geographical hotspots migrated from work and school locations to recreational and outer suburban regions, the lockdown timing also switched from weekdays to weekends and from winter to summer.\n\nThis study also found that the reduction in crashes can be observed in monthly and daily time spans. The results showed that April, May, and June, the first three months of the pandemic onset, have experienced a lower proportion of count crashes compared to the similar before-pandemic period. A similar pattern can also be seen over the weekdays, such that the frequency of crashes on working days of the week (except for Wednesday) has declined. Moreover, in line with the traffic volume that has resulted in fewer crashes, the severity of crashes has also decreased as drivers have shown more cautious behaviour after the pandemic.\n\nIn addition, the results of GLM reveal the significant role of “Average Household Size” (β = −3.668), “landuse mix'' (β = 2.195), “distance to CBD” (β = −0.596), “distance to public transit” (β = 0.368), and “distance to major roads” (β = −0.175). Therefore, more pedestrian-vehicle conflicts in mixed landuse areas, closer to CBDs, and distant from public transit stations as areas controlled by traffic-calming strategies have led to an increase in crash frequency among people in Adelaide.\n\nThe GWGLM results showed that the highest negative changes in crash frequency due to the COVID-19 lockdown occurred in business and industry clusters. In contrast, the biggest positive changes in crash frequency occurred in peripheral green areas and recreational places such as Stirling, Hahndorf, and Aldgate in the east, Vista in the north-east, and certain beaches like Christies Beach and Semaphore in the west. Each variable has an apparent pattern of spatial variation. For most variables, the effect of the variable is stronger in three main spots: the central area (CBD), the area near major job hubs, and the area near tourist activities. The coefficients for certain variables (Average household size, Distance to major roads, Born overseas, Working age) were compatible with the GLM model, whereas others were not. So in the GWGLM model they are used for analysis.\n\nSince the crash frequency and severity vary significantly on the time of day and the location in which they occur, understanding how these factors interact should be a top policy objective. When thinking about how different components of a city infrastructure affect crash rates, it is important to take into account how different neighbourhoods were developed (Lee et al., 2020). For instance, in the central area of metropolitan Adelaide, where a variety of land uses coexist, the geographical distribution of activities and land uses raises the likelihood of an increase in the frequency of crashes since more people are making more trips.\n\nOne management policy for future cyberspace employment in Australia might learn from the pandemic's success in lowering the number of crashes owing to a decline in physical disputes and a rise in the willingness to teleworking (Beck and Hensher, 2021). This would need educating the society on how to use technology effectively and expanding their access to online retail, entertainment, healthcare, and job opportunities in order to reduce the need for them to commute.\n\nThis study's findings also provide light on the impact of shifting driving behaviour on safety during disruptive catastrophes such as COVID-19. The COVID-19 crisis in Australia led to a rise in unemployment and distant work (Churchill, 2021), hence reducing the crash rate from job-related traffic. Specifically, one result of this research is that encouraging work/education from home may be a suitable strategy for minimising traffic crashes, particularly in the area of industrial and work clusters.\n\nCOVID-19 in Australia demonstrates that encouraging non-motorized forms of transportation and implementing push rules on personal car use would have a substantial influence on road safety. In Australia, however, the present infrastructure for non-motorized transport is often insufficient to accommodate the substantial rise in demand. It is also recommended to promote public transport infrastructure, while the COVID-19 experience reminds us of the need to provide hygiene services, since passenger hygiene and crowd control are currently the two most important transportation priorities throughout Australia (Soltani et al., 2021). Maintaining an interest in active mobility and guaranteeing the safety of all users will need continuing investments in safe infrastructure and an increase in public transport patronage.\n\nThere are caveats to this paper's conclusions, which further research is encouraged to address. There was a lack of access to crash victims' personal, behavioural, and psychological data, which has been demonstrated to be crucial in understanding why people crash their cars (Islam and Mannering, 2006). Numerous drivers have the demographic trait of being in generally good physical condition (Cicchino and McCartt, 2015).\n\nFuture study might include more sophisticated modelling approaches for the purposes of projecting future crash patterns in metropolitan Adelaide and evaluating the efficacy of current measures. To build improved models of prediction and evaluation utilising cutting-edge technology (Chakraborty et al., 2019) such as artificial neural networks and machine learning, more thorough panel crash data is necessary. Using qualitative data collecting procedures such as document content review, non-participant observation, and semi-structured interview via focus groups are advised to capture the viewpoints of stakeholders, service providers, and local community (Selveindran et al., 2021) regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on road safety."
