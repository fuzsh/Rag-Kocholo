The major­i­ty of the trail is bitu­men with a few short sec­tions of hard packed grav­el. In places the edge of the bitu­men path has bro­ken away and there are occa­sion­al rip­ples in the sur­face due to tree roots under the sur­face. Between the lake and the car park area the trail has a short sec­tion of bro­ken bitu­men with a small lip that may require assis­tance. The trail is best to be com­plet­ed in a clock­wise direction.\n\nLori­keet Loop Walk (3km)\n\nIt is rec­om­mend­ed to start the walk from Old Gov­ern­ment House and should be done in an anti-clock­wise direc­tion. The trail is a mix of hard packed grav­el sur­face and bitu­men. Some assis­tance may be required on the climb back to Old Gov­ern­ment House from the adven­ture playground.\n\nDogs on a lead are also welcome.\n\nPic­nic areas\n\nEnjoy an open-air lunch at the acces­si­ble pic­nic ground at Play­ford Lake and at the far end of the Pines Pic­nic Area 1.\n\nTen­nis courts\n\nTen­nis courts 1, 2, 32 and 33 are acces­si­ble.

There is no fee to use these. There are also free bar­be­cues and pic­nic tables next to the Adven­ture Play­ground, at Play­ford Lake along­side the very pop­u­lar Wood Duck Walk and between Wil­lows and the Kar­ka Pavilion.\n\nHire­able facilities\n\nTen­nis courts, ovals, and pavil­ions (pop­u­lar for school sport­ing events, excur­sions, wed­dings and cor­po­rate events) are avail­able for hire online. The gas bar­be­cues and for­mal pic­nic areas around the park can also be hired online.\n\nHire­able facil­i­ties can be booked up to 12 months in advance.

Gov­er­nor Gawler lat­er set this land aside as a gov­ern­ment farm in 1840 upon which sick hors­es and bul­locks could be agist­ed. A few years lat­er the gov­ern­ment gained legal title to the farm and pro­ceed­ed to grow hay and take care of stock belong­ing to the sur­vey and police departments.\n\nBetween 1849 and 1852, the Com­mis­sion­er of Police took charge of the farm and used it for hors­es employed in the Gold Escort and oth­er police services.\n\nIn the ear­ly 1880s, an attempt to sub­di­vide the land was reject­ed and a bill was passed stat­ing the farm could not be sold. While the farm could not be sold, there were no restric­tions on what the land could be used for, so, in 1886, 202 hectares were hand­ed over to the Woods and For­est Depart­ment as a for­est reserve.\n\nDed­i­cat­ed in 1891, Belair became the first nation­al park to be estab­lished in South Aus­tralia and the sec­ond nation­al park in Aus­tralia. In 1892, the first board of com­mis­sion­ers was appointed.\n\nBy the 1920s, after pres­sure from groups such as the Native Fau­na and Flo­ra Pro­tec­tion Com­mit­tee, poli­cies changed in regards to the con­ser­va­tion of native plants and ani­mals in the park. As a result, the last large scale plant­i­ng of non-Aus­tralian species in the park occurred in 1922 — 700 Japan­ese cher­ries were plant­ed on six hectares of land in Sparkes Gul­ly — and in 1923 it was decid­ed all future plant­i­ngs were to be native to the state.\n\nBy 1929, the now well-estab­lished Belair Nation­al Park had devel­oped 42 ten­nis courts, sev­er­al pavil­ions and ovals and a well-devel­oped road net­work. This was to accom­mo­date the increas­ing num­ber of vis­i­tors and play an impor­tant social func­tion dur­ing and after the years of the Great Depres­sion. The park’s facil­i­ties were also used for mil­i­tary camps dur­ing the Sec­ond World War.\n\nIn 1934, trees were cleared to make way for a nine hole golf course which was built as a means to raise rev­enue for the park. This course was lat­er extend­ed to an 18 hole golf course in 1941.\n\nIn 1972, the Nation­al Parks Com­mis­sion was ter­mi­nat­ed and con­trol of the park was passed to the Nation­al Parks and Wildlife Ser­vice. Belair Recre­ation Park was gazetted in 1972 and was re-ded­i­cat­ed to Belair Nation­al Park in 1991.\n\nWalks in the parks range from easy walks to more chal­leng­ing hikes. While you’re bush­walk­ing in the park, you’ll be reward­ed with mag­nif­i­cent views of native wood­lands, lakes and sea­son­al waterfalls.\n\nBush­walk­ing is a fan­tas­tic way to con­nect with nature, keep fit and spend time with fam­i­ly and friends. South Aus­trali­a’s nation­al parks fea­ture a range of trails that let you expe­ri­ence a diver­si­ty of landscapes.\n\nWalk­ing trails in our parks are grad­ed accord­ing to the Aus­tralian Walk­ing Track Grad­ing Sys­tem which is a nation­al stan­dard to help you work out if a walk will suit your lev­el of fit­ness and experience.\n\nGrade 2 — No bush­walk­ing expe­ri­ence required\n\nWood Duck Walk (30 mins return, 1km)\n\nNav­i­gate this trail using Google Street View\n\nThis pleas­ant walk around Play­ford Lake is pop­u­lar with young chil­dren, peo­ple with lim­it­ed mobil­i­ty and those who want to expe­ri­ence the park’s wildlife.\n\nThe trail starts at Play­ford Lake.\n\nLori­keet Loop Walk (1 hr 25 mins return, 3.5km)\n\nNav­i­gate this trail using Google Street View\n\nWind your way past Old Gov­ern­ment House and the State Flo­ra Nurs­ery, then stop for a rest at the play­ground – an ide­al spot for fam­i­ly groups.
