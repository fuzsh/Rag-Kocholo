        "text": "There was 24 signal boxes on the Metropolitan System, servicing a wide variety of Destinations. The man in the signal box at junction had to know the destination of those trains. This was done with a destination board on the front of each by day, or lights by night.\n\nThe 830 class loco has worked on all gauges, narrow, standard & broad. Here we see the leader of the class, 830 just after it enter service on 18/12/59, being used on the suburban run. It's December 1959, and a brand new diesel loco, 830, pulls away from Hove with 5 end loading cars, forming a service from Hallett Cove to Adelaide. Technical Details Photo by BRAIN CASTLE\n\nThere were 10 Locos in the class built, 800 to 809. They were built by English Electric at Rockea in Queensland & then railed to Adelaide. They were issued to South Australian Railways between 30th May 1956 & 31st Augusta 1957 & become the fourth diesel loco to be introduced onto the system. With the high axle loading of those units, they spent most of their time shunting & goods transfer work between Mile End, Dry Creek & Gillman Yards. They did have a brief period on surburban loco hauled trains, following complaints from passengers about the use of 930 Class. They were soon replaced as more Red Hen Rail Cars become available. They did also work on the Terowie line in the early days. In 1969 during a diesel shortage they also worked in multiple units to Wallaroo, releasing 930's for other work. Technical Details Photo by Ron Coney\n\nA \"Red Hen set\", 300 & 400 Class rail car at Halletts Cove Beach station on an \"up\" trip to Noarlunga Centre. Those Rail Cars where the backbone of suburban train services. The first entered service on 6/10/1955 & to June 1975 had done 1,303,645 miles . By the 1960's had pretty well replaced steam trains & loco hauled consists. They are now obsolete, being replaced with 3000 & 3100 Class rail cars. Technical Details Photo by Chris Carpenter\n\nThe 2000 Class Rail Cars started in late 1970's on the lines around Adelaide. Because of the driving cab above they got nicknamed \"the jumbo's\". Here we see a six car set heading for Noarlunga Centre. More Info on the 2000 Class - Photo by Chris Carpenter\n\nA order was placed in May 1985 for a new rail car. The first 3000 & 3100 Class arrived in Adelaide later in 1985. Those have now replaced all the Red Hen rail cars. Those rail cars were a break with SAR tradition of the hydraulic to electric transmission. Here we see 3004 departing Brighton station for the return trip to Adelaide. With the extention of the line to Noarlunga Centre, Brighton become a terminus station Monday to Friday. Noarlunga Centre trains run express to Brighton & then all station to Noarlunga Centre.
