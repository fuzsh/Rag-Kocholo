TransAdelaide Bombardier Flexity Classic.

In 2006 Adelaide Metro began to replace the H Class cars operated on the Glenelg Tramway, by TransAdelaide with a fleet of eleven Bombardier Flexity Classic trams. The first of the new Flexitys was delivered to the Glengowrie depot in November 2005 and entered public service on 9th of Janurary 2006.

Delivery continued in small batches through 2006, with new trams operating on the Glenelg line side-by-side with the H-class in the interim.

The Flexitys are painted in a standard Adelaide Metro colour scheme of white, with yellow, blue and red ends, very similar to Adelaideâ€™s metropolitan bus fleet and heavy rail, although many now run corporate advertising top-to-bottom on the sides and only have the 'safety yellow' ends. They have a low floor layout throughout, except over the bogies, and are accessible to kids pushers and wheelchairs through each of the three sets of doors.
