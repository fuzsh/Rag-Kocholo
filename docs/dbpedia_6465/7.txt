In 2006, TransAdelaide now Public Transport Services (PTS) as part of DTEI began to replace the H Type cars operating on their Glenelg tramway with a fleet of eleven Flexity Classic trams. The first of the new Flexitys was delivered to the Glengowrie depot in November 2005 and entered public service on 9 January 2006. Delivery continued in small batches through 2006, with new trams operating the Glenelg line side-by-side with the H Type in the interim.
