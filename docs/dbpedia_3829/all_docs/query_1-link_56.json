        "text": "Love that guitar. I built an Esquire based on it, using the same sort of finish (copper napthenate wood preservative under clear coat). No relic job or exact look-alike; I just wanted to cop the finish.\n\nI love The Quo. My band covers four of their songs (\"Big Fat Mama,\" \"Oh Baby,\" \"Paper Plane,\" and \"Do You Live in Fire\").\n\nThey peaked at Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon, IMO. Spare Parts and that one are must haves. I don't listen past Hello, and I find that one and Piledriver to be spotty over all, but great when they are great.\n\nThey were very much like the Bee Gees in their early days, right down to the voices being similar. Spare Parts was such a complete and total Bee Gees rip that it could be easily mistaken for actual early Bee Gees, if you didn't know everything the Bee Gees had put out (but kind of knew how they sounded in their early days).\n\nMa Kelly's... was them moving from being Bee Gees copycats to being blues-rock and early heavy metal copycats. The Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac and Black Sabbath influences are huge on this album. It's an amazingly great album (with the exception of the horrible Fleetwood Mac cover near the end).\n\nUntil they established their own signature sound, they were extremely derivative, and changed their sound often â€“ not an original bone in their bodies, really. Until they were about 4 or 5 albums in, they just sort of followed whatever the rock trend was at the time. Yet I don't care, because they derived some great songs from their influences, however obvious those influences were.\n\nAs for the question the one guy asked, about what U.S. band they'd be comparable to, I can't really think of an answer. Maybe something like Tom Petty: very well known, tons of radio play, but not considered top of the heap like The Stones or something like that. But they were HUGE in Europe (unfortunately, mostly for their IMO crappy period).\n\nSomething from Spare Parts for your enjoyment:"
