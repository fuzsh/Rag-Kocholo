The 1989 version is the best version and it will simply never be topped. I dont get why they don't still play it that way.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nIt's an educated guess based on memory but I think they added the harmonica during the Pictures tour in 2008. I like it, personally.\n\nNo version is a patch on the languid original for me, although the '89 version is up there as the next best thing. That 1970 version is almost unique; maybe shades of Fleetwood Mac or Canned Heat but definitely the quintessential Quo of the day. The '89 rendition has a power and drive which, strangely, seems to suit it.\n\nOne of Quo's best ever songs.

And this new version is still bl00dy good\n\nI'll probably get shot for saying this, but it's not even the power or the drive of it - it just in general seems darker, heavier and has more groove to it than any other version IMO\n\nEdit: You are correct on the harmonica being added when it returned in 2008.\n\nPost by roquer on\n\nI can't remember exactly right now how it sounded with harmonica, but from what I remember, doesn't sound bad for me.\n\n(I don't want to hearing nothing new until the gig in Madrid. At least something would be a surprise...If I can say that)\n\nPost by curiousgirl on\n\nFor me the best bit of that latest version is the jam at the end and I thought Andy's harmonica was fine. I'd go as far as to say I loved it.\n\nBut this is heavy, for me."
