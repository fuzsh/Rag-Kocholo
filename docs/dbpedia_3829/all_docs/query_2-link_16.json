        "text": "Well,\n\nI finally broke down and bought my first techno-pop 80's CD (Albeit 20 years after it was released!) - couldn't resist - it was free when I bought 3 other used CD's at my local Strawberries. Turns out this is the original '85? release and is the German Mercury \"Atomic\" !!! I knew \"Shout\" and \"EWTRTW\" from the radio back then. But all in all this ain't a bad listen as a whole LP & even more than as \"an artifact of it's time\" - and on this hissy Atomic ('flat\" transfer?) CD - some amount of warmth actually comes thru (even to a tech-no phobe), Hell, making these guys even sound human!!!\n\nHey hey Mal\n\nI appeciate the advice, but Rome wasn't built in a day - look here it took me 20 years to get this one! This one actually has a bit of good ol Northern blue-eyed soul!\n\nI love this record. \"Head Over Heels\" was another heavily-played track. I never did get a CD, probably because the LP sounds great. A nice Sterling cut. I'd imagine the 12\" singles are great.\n\nIMHO, there was a lot of great stuff from the 80s like this. Simple Minds, New Order, Simply Red...that kinda stuff. I always liked that period. YMMV.\n\nThe 12\"'s for \"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\" and \"Shout\" are wonderful!! Both the US and UK cuts. I recommend the US 12\" for \"Shout\" both for the excellent remix(UK version features a different mix, the US version has both) and mastering. Cut at 45 RPM.\n\nYep, I'm not surprised at all. Practically all 12\" 45RPM singles are sweet. I'd think something like \"Shout\" would be perfect for showing what 12\" 45's can do.\n\nI'm in the process of scavenging for Go-Gos 12\" 45's.\n\nI absolutely love this album. I Believe and Listen are beautiful ballads. The hits speak for themselves and the 12's are great. I was lucky enough to score the rare US promo of Shout featuring the 8-minute US Remix, the Dub and an Acappela mix found nowhere else. Another great 12 is Mothers Talk (Beat Of The Drum) featuring interesting samples including the old video game, Gallaga. Get The Hurting and Seeds Of Love and enjoy the best of TFF.\n\nBob.\n\nThis and the Hurting were for many years my favorite 80s release. The MOFI is the way to go for SftBG and the original pressing for the Hurting. I am not a fan of the remasters. Also, I second the love for Simple Minds...if you ever see the sacds or dvd-audios I would check them out.\n\nI think this was covered in some other thread, but is there a quick way to get all the 12\" singles? I think there was some new japanese release that had some (all?) of them. The MOFI has two extended tracks that are pretty cool. I think some cheesy dvd I have has a remix video too.\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of TFF back in the 80's, I was more of a New Order/Depeche Mode fan. I really do appreciate them more the last 10 years or so. One of the better 80's bands."
