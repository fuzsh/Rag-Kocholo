        "text": "Artist: Tears for Fears\n\nAlbum: Songs from the Big Chair\n\nYear: 1985\n\nGrade: A+\n\nIn Brief: The realization that Songs from the Big Chair was my favorite album of the entire 1980s honestly took me by surprise. It may only have eight songs, but each of them are distinctive, and each one seems to contain multitudes of information and emotion within itself. Tears for Fears hit the sweet spot here, coming up with synthetic pop music that was groundbreaking for its time and now seen as some of the most emblematic of its era, but pushing the boundaries of the genre in every way they could think of, to make sure each track made a powerful statement. Come for the nostalgia, stay for the jaw-dropping musical versatility and the soul-cleansing therapy session.\n\nMy seven-year old came up to me a few weeks ago and asked, “Daddy, have you heard of Tears for Fears?” All I could do was stare at her for a few seconds, dumfounded, and finally respond, “Have I heard of tears for Fears?! How have you heard of Tears for Fears?” Turns out it was something she’d heard a reference to on some kids’ show she was watching where characters frequently made reference to the music of the 70s and 80s for some reason, probably because the writers wanted to throw in a little parental bonus. As much as I’ve made it my mission to expose my daughter to a variety of music from across the decades, and I’m sure I played Tears for Fears with her in earshot quite a bit during my 80s binge last year, I don’t generally mention the names of the bands I’m listening to unless she asks (and usually she’s more interested in what a song is called or whether she heard a snippet of the lyrics properly). So having her hear about Tears for Fears on her own, and think, “Hey, I bet Daddy knows about them!” was a proud papa moment. I then indulged her in a crash course of some of their finest songs via YouTube, including a handful of music videos I’d never seen before. This might be music that came out when I was a kid, but Tears for Fears was a band that, despite knowing a few of their songs for ages, I mostly got acquainted with just last year. So it felt like a new experience that we were both sharing at the same time.\n\nI’ve chosen tears for Fears’ sophomore release Songs from the Big Chair as my “nostalgia review” for the year 1985, because duh, there’s no way I wasn’t gonna pick it. With all due respect to Kate Bush‘s fiercely imaginative The Hounds of Love, New Order‘s dark synthpop opus Low-Life, The Dream Academy‘s blissfully engaging self-titled debut, and a rare experimental pop turn from The Cure on The Head on the Door, it was really no contest this time around. While this one was a delightful and mind-boggling listen from the get-go, I don’t think I realized how much I truly appreciated it until the eleventh our when I was sorting out the upper tier of my “Raddest Albums of the 80s” list, giving everything one last listen to see if it was truly inevitable that I would give the #1 slot to a longtime favorite, U2‘s The Joshua Tree. To say that I was startled when I realized I was vibing with Big Chair on a whole other level would be an understatement. It just suddenly hit me that I loved every song on the album, and what a rare feat that was for any band – technically it might be easier when an album only has eight songs, but usually there’ll be a weak point or two that will lead me to gripe about the lack of content and why they couldn’t have thrown a few more songs in there. Big Chair is that special unicorn of an album where not only does each song stand out as essential, they’re also equally immersive whether you listen to one of them individually or take the album in as a whole. Usually it’s one or the other – a band can stack up a set of catchy pop songs and/or formidable rockers, or they can try to sequence everything together in a way that suggests a deeper meaning, and have some of the connecting narrative tissue come off as lesser material because of it. Some of the most memorable and beloved pop songs of the 80s are here – tracks like “Shout” and “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” and “Head Over Heels” that rightfully belong on any primer of the best material from that decade, that a lot of the developed world seems to know through cultural osmosis, and that have even been sampled and recontextualized in hop-hop and R&B songs over the past few decades, safely distancing Tears for Fears from the “dorky and hopelessly dated thing we loved in the 80s” category and putting them in the “bands with a surprising amount of ongoing relevance” category. A lot of blood, sweat and tears must have gone into this album to get all eight of this songs just right, and to make the decision to quit at exactly the right moment instead of overloading it with one too many fancy things. I imagine if I’d been around at the time, I’d have had a hard time conceiving how they were going to follow up their already astounding debut The Hurting in such a short amount of time. Scores of different things could have gone wrong here, and surprisingly none of them did.\n\nNow, it’s tempting to give Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith the lion’s share of the credit for this album – they are, after all, the two core members of the band, and the only faces pictured on the cover. But Tears for Fears actually functioned as a four-piece for their first couple albums, with keyboardist Ian Stanley co-writing several songs in additional to being a crucial element of their piano and synth-heavy sound, and drummer Manny Elias laying down some irresistible grooves on several tracks while also being an important part of the creative process for one track in particular. The band would never again work in this configuration, with Elias leaving shortly after the lengthy tour for this album in 1986, and Stanley leaving the year after that (though he’d still be credited for his contributions to their next album, The Seeds of Love). Orzabal, rather infamously, continued Tears for Fears more or less as a solo project for a couple albums after he and Smith had a falling out in 1991, with the duo finally reconciling (thank God) in the early 2000s. They’ve continued to make excellent music (albeit sparingly) as a duo, but there’s something extremely special about Big Chair that I think it’s safe to say is never going to be reproduced. At times it feels like this record is trying to carry the entire weight of human pain, ego, and ambition on its shoulders, as if the catharsis of simply calling out these things for what they are could somehow make the burden a little lighter.\n\nINDIVIDUAL TRACKS:\n\n1. Shout\n\nThe record leads off with one of Tears for Fears’ most massive, world-dominating singles, and a part of me wants to say “Duh, of course it does!” But actually, Roland Orzabal and I have something in common in that when we first heard this song, we both imagined it being a much deeper album cut, not an opener. What we don’t have in common, of course, is that he wrote the thing and I didn’t, so he was first hearing it in his head, piecing together the cold machinery of its incessant drum loop and its mantra-like chorus encouraging the listener to go on and shout out all of the fears that were haunting them, but not really getting beyond the most repetitive aspects until he brought it to Ian Stanley and album producer Chris Hughes, who rightfully realized they had a potential hit on their hands. It’s funny how my memories of hearing “Shout” on the radio over the years (as well as hearing it covered, interpolated, and remixed six ways from Sunday – thanks but no thanks, Disturbed!) differ from my experience with the album version now. At first I wondered why I remembered it being bigger and heavier than it did – for the first few minutes of the song, as impassioned as Orzabal’s dark melodies and his primal fears about the world possibly not surviving to see the end of the Cold War are, all of the programmed elements almost seem to be weighing it down, and the production values seem even more dated than most of the unabashedly mid-80s art pop on this record. But “Shout” is sneaky. “Shout” takes its time to unfold. And you don’t really notice the drum loops and fills getting thicker and heavier until the full force of the song is right up on top of you. I feel like they might have learned a lesson from Phil Collins‘ “In the Air Tonight”, in terms of how to bring live drums into a minimalistic, mostly programmed track and have the two work together to formidable effect – though this may not have as big of a “Wow!” moment when it really kicks in, instead being more like a river that seems relatively calm on the surface but an undertow that will suck you in and show no mercy. I wouldn’t necessarily call any of Tears for Fears’ music “industrial”, but it’s clear from a handful of their songs, and especially this one, why they were an early influence on the genre. You know what else I didn’t realize about “Shout” until hearing it on the album? That it’s six and a half freaking minutes long. That’s pushing its luck, especially for a radio single (which I’m assuming got edited down considerably), but these guys knew how to make every second worth your time – there are some generous instrumental breaks here for the synths, a bit of organ, and an electric guitar to all do their thing. I’m still floored at how intimidatingly cool the whole thing is when it all comes together.\n\nGrade: A+\n\n2. The Working Hour\n\nOn my first listen to Songs from the Big Chair, I was so satisfied with finally having heard “Shout” in its fully glory, and I was pumped to get to the next big hit from the album at track three, that I couldn’t wait to find out how they kept up the momentum in between those two larger-than-life songs. And then this track came along, fading in with its introspective saxophone solo and its lighter-than-air synths, and I thought… “What the hell? This sounds awfully smooth-jazzy. Have I been punked? Is this actually a Kenny G. track?” Alright, I’m mostly kidding here – the saxophone is an instrument that I tend to really like, even though it can be a lazy aural shortcut for “this song is gonna be sexy and sophisticated” when it falls into the wrong hands (which is probably why we spent quite a bit of time in the 90s and 2000s thinking that the sax was uncool before it eventually got a bit of a reassessment). But it’s definitely a weird pause in the action before Manny Elias’s distinctive drum pattern kicks in, followed by a winding piano melody from Ian Stanley that will repeat enough times to get firmly etched into your brain. With both of them being so important to the backbone of this song, one could argue that this is one of the best examples of Tears for Fears functioning as a full band and not just a duo. Curt Smith may be relegated to only bass and backing vocals here, but it was his working relationship with Orzabal that inspired the song’s lyrics, what with the two of them being so suddenly thrust into the spotlight and basically being told by their label, “OK good, now go make more like that, and hurry up!” While he was vague enough to not bite the hand that was feeding him, it’s pretty clear that the words “This is the working hour/We are paid by those who learn from our mistakes” represent the frustration of an artist expected to consistently deliver commercially consumable material. One might consider it unwise for such a young band still on the rise to already be complaining about the drudgery of making records, but I think Orzabal was wise to keep the lyrics fairly minimal and let the band do most of the talking. Heck, we’re two minutes into the song before he even begins to sing, and I’m pretty sure the sax, drums, and keyboard are all circling around each other in an extended instrumental break for a good few minutes near the end, too. It gets intense even when the vocalists have stepped out of the way. And it’s such an engrossing piece of music that, once again, I’m shocked to realize six and a half minutes have gone by when it’s over. You see why I’m not complaining about this record having only eight tracks? There’s no need to when this is the level of quality and immersion we’re dealing with.\n\nGrade: A\n\n3. Everybody Wants to Rule the World\n\nSo here, it is, the big daddy of ’em all, the one Tears for Fears song that it seems like “everybody” knows. That’s saying something when you’ve an act like “Shout” to follow. A rather baffling pattern I’m noticing as I read up on the history of Tears for Fears is that Roland and Curt seem to have second-guessed themselves a lot when it came to some of the material that would go on to be their most popular. This one didn’t get written until the album was near completion and they decided they needed another single to really tie a bow on it, then they ended up balking at the shuffle beat and the simple, smooth two-chord progression on the keyboard that they had come up with, figuring it was too simplistic and the cheery sound of it would stand at odds with the rest of the album. (Never mind that the guitar work in this song, from the unbelievably cool arpeggio that kicks it off to the two very distinctive solos that show up further in, manages to sound both economical and sophisticated at the same time. C’mon, guys, give yourselves more credit!) It certainly stands out – but in a good way. Like just about any Tears for Fears song where they paint with brighter musical colors, it’s intentionally deceptive, since while you could read “Rule the World” as a love song, it’s actually got some rather dark implications. We’re talking like, end of the world dark. This shouldn’t be that big of a surprise, as the idea that huge egos are vying for control of the world is kind of right there in the title, but the song is really about an everyday fellow trying to figure out how to carry on with his life in the light of that momentous power struggle – how much longer does he have to enjoy the simple things like freedom and pleasure that he’s taken for granted all his life, before the world he knows either falls prey to some sort of dictatorship hellscape, or worse, nuclear obliteration? I don’t think I was really in a place to understand what the bridge was talking about when it mentioned “There’s a place where the light can’t find us/Holding hands while the walls come crashing down.” Like, holy crap, was he imagining life in an underground bunker when he wrote this? Perhaps it was fate that led me to come back around to this one in 2022 when Russia was rattling its sabers again and that image made way more sense than I wanted it to. But then, I think there are a lot of ways you could interpret individual lines from this song – some parts of it feel empowering and even downright euphoric, and it’s a hell of a fun song to sing along to – even if I always get mixed up as to which version of the chorus comes when, and also that chorus kind of sneaks up on me every time because of how effortlessly the verses and bridge slide back into it, and… damn, this is just a master class in inventive song structure, now that I think about it. There’s a reason why Tears for Fears has gone back to the “anthemic shuffle beat-driven song” well a few times, most recently on The Tipping Point‘s title track and “End of Night”. They just sound amazing in this mode. I can’t fathom why they ever thought they wouldn’t. (Side note: What the hell is with those gas station dancers in the music video? There are some mysteries that humankind was never meant to solve…)\n\nGrade: A+\n\n4. Mothers Talk\n\nSpeaking of Tears for Fears singles that the band doesn’t like, this was Big Chair‘s first single, and Orzabal is not a fan. I don’t want to become a broken record on the topic of thinking he’s selling himself short, because even at their most commercial and trend-chasing (which they clearly were here with all the crazy sampling and a beat that almost sounds more like it belongs on a Wham! record), there’s a lot more going on beneath the surface. Admittedly, yes, this song is confusingly written and not one of Orzabal’s more well thought-out lyrics, I think he was trying to draw an analogy between mothers warning their kids that if they keep making goofy faces, they’ll stay that way, and the threat of drastic political change wiping the smile off of all our privileged faces in the free Western world… but I don’t know that the connection gets made all that well. It’s mostly wordplay for the sake of phonetic trickery (putting the word “weekend” next to the line “we can work it out” and so forth). But listen to how fast and furious the band is here. The guitars rattle around like they’re trying to break out of a cage, Curt Smith’s bass is burbling all over the place, and the frenetic drum programming seems to never let up. Augmented though it may be by a number of artificial sounds, this wasn’t just a case of a producer pasting together samples at the expense of an interesting performance by an actual band. I’d put this one on a slightly lower tier than most of the band’s classic hits, I guess, but I still adore it. Interestingly, while this was the first taste of Big Chair for Tears for Fears fans in the UK, it was actually the last single released from the record here in America, where we apparently got a remixed version. (I can’t say that I have any memory whatsoever of hearing it in any form outside of the album, for whatever that’s worth.)\n\nGrade: A-\n\n5. I Believe\n\nThe second half of this record kicks off – or more accurately, nudges off – with a slow, jazzy number that I wouldn’t have guessed was a Tears for Fears track if I’d heard it “in the wild”. I mean, sure, Orzabal’s vocals are as distinctive as they always are, but like… where’s all the reverb and the synths and stuff? This was recorded in the 80s? Are you sure? Clearly they were already tired of being pigeonholed as a synthpop act by this point, electing to strip away the synthetic elements entirely from this song, with Orzabal coaxing an uneasy yet soulful progression out of the grand piano as he smoothly croons along, the drums mostly restricted to light cymbal tapping, and honestly not a whole lot else going on instrumentally save for the occasional mournful whimper of the saxophone, which is far more restrained here than it was on “The Working Hour”. I suppose it’s still got some of that mid-80s gloss to it, production-wise (and I’m guessing that got even further stripped back when a live recording of this song was released as a single), but to my ears it sounds like the polar opposite of the classic Tears for Fears sound. (Though strangely enough, I could see it being a reasonably good fit for the aforementioned debut by The Dream Academy – just replace the sax with a French horn.) This one had to grow on me for sure – but honestly, it’s quite beautiful, and it’s got just the right mixture of tension and release, as Orzabal goes into a series of verses about all the different things he believes, most of which seem to be related to the ability of humans to find the will to live and thrive, and the ability to do genuine good, deep down within themselves instead of needing to appeal to a higher power. Some of it is more abstract, maybe even non-sequitur at times (I’m not sure what’s with the “Casino Spanish eyes” bit), and it wouldn’t surprise me if he improvised a few of these lyrics on the spot. This was the track that had to work the hardest to earn its “A” grade from me, but now I really appreciate how big of a curveball it throws midway to the album and how it keeps the mood tense as it leads into the album’s emotional climax.\n\nGrade: A-\n\n6. Broken\n\nWhen the drums kicked in and the band got going with another fast-paced and unbelievably cool bass line, followed by glorious guitar solo, I figured this two and a half minute track was just going to be an instrumental segue. Then it hit me – wait, why do I recognize the keyboard melody that pops up early on? Well, that’s because I knew it from another Tears for Fears song, of course, and that song just so happens to be up next. Not that anyone would have known that their first time through the album – they’d have just wondered why Orzabal only drops in at the end two give us two very brief but impassioned verses and what sounds like a bridge section that trails off as all the instrumentation drops out, segueing perfectly into the next track.\n\nGrade: A\n\n7. Head Over Heels / Broken (Reprise)\n\nThe moment when that melody I recognized pays off, as the tempo suddenly downshifts and the piano kicks off one of Tears for Fears’ most iconic ballads in grand fashion, just makes me want to pump my fist and scream “HELL YES!!!” It’s one of the best segues on any album that I’ve ever heard. And it leads into what on the surface might seem like a more lighthearted ballad about falling hopelessly in love with somebody. It certainly has a melody that makes me swoon, accentuated at all the right moments with little bits of 80s flair – a drum fill here, a sampled horn or string instrument there. And because it’s Tears for Fears, of course there’s a darker side. The second verse – which has a lot going on due to different parts from Curt and Roland overlapping, at one point startles me with the line “It’s hard to be a man when there’s a gun in your hand”, which starts to make me wonder if I’ve got things all wrong and there’s some sort of abusive power dynamic in this relationship that I had previously assumed was just innocuous puppy love. This is one of those songs that I know I’d heard in passing on the radio many times without ever identifying who it was, because the melody had such a strong emotional pull on me – I really should have been more proactive about googling it, but then I don’t think I ever stopped to think much about the lyrics until Japanese Breakfast covered it in 2019 with nothing but vocals and a keyboard, demonstrating in the process how well this song translated even when it was completely divorced from its maximalist 80s trappings. What’s fascinating to me is that while this is a more well-known song than “Broken” and it had a life of its own as a single, “Broken” actually preceded it as a B-side to “Pale Shelter” (another of my TFF favorites from their first album), and this song – which actually gives Curt Smith’s only co-writing credit on the entire album – developed out of live performances where it wound up being sandwiched in between segments of “Broken”. They kept that sequencing intact here, with a live reprise of “Broken” coming back in to close things out on a high note, right as the final note of “Head Over Heels” fades out. This may be slightly annoying for people who just wanted to listen to the single in isolation (it was remixed for radio for presumably that exact reason), but personally, I can’t imagine ever hearing the two songs apart from each other now that I know they were meant to be presented this way.\n\nGrade: A+\n\n8. Listen\n\nI have a slight nitpick with the crowd noise leftover from the “Broken” reprise bleeding over into the final track – the cross-fade is done elegantly, but if you were to queue up just this track, it’d be a bit of a jarring way to start off what is otherwise one of the most peaceful and ethereal and downright otherworldly pieces of music in existence. This is another one that I assumed was going to be an instrumental at first, due to how much of it is spent repeating its simple yet achingly gorgeous synthesizer motif – to my ears it sounds sort of like an old video game system trying to emulate the sound of an exotic flute, maybe as the soundtrack to a climactic level from one of those Zelda or Final Fantasy games where you’ve crossed over into some sort of astral plane and are now exploring an ancient temple that time forgot. There are lyrics here, however sparingly – but word to the wise, do not trust Genius on this one, because beyond two very brief verses sung in English (which are somewhat faint in the overall mix, making them easy to miss altogether), most of it, including the operatic background vocals and an African-style chant that repeats throughout the latter half of the song, appears to be total gibberish. It’s the absolute best kind of vocal gibberish, though – imagine if Cocteau Twins and the aforementioned Kate Bush had a baby, and then that baby somehow had its own baby with a Super NES game soundtrack, and then that baby had a baby with Bon Iver, and… OK, this analogy is getting ridiculous, but I hope you can see where I’m going with this. It’s utterly beguiling, but it’s a heavenly way to spend the last seven minutes of the record. Since the few comprehensible lyrics that we get refer to “Mother Russia” and a “Pilgrim father” having departed, I imagine that both Russia and America have collapsed and left their children behind, and those children have somehow formed a new society and are rebuilding the world, reciting a hopeful mantra for their own future in a language our ears cannot understand, because it does not exist yet. Long story short, it’s an eerie yet compelling vision of peace in a future incomprehensibly far away.\n\nGrade: A\n\nWHAT’S IT WORTH TO ME?\n\nShout $2\n\nThe Working Hour $1.75\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World $2\n\nMothers Talk $1.50\n\nI Believe $1.50\n\nBroken $1.75\n\nHead Over Heels / Broken (Reprise) $2\n\nListen $1.75\n\nTOTAL: $14.25\n\nBAND MEMBERS:\n\nRoland Orzabal: Lead and backing vocals, keyboards, piano, guitars, synth bass, drum programming\n\nCurt Smith: Lead and backing vocals, bass, synth bass (left in 1991, returned in 2000)\n\nIan Stanley: Keyboards, drum programming, arrangements (left in 1987)\n\nManny Elias: Drums (left in 1986)\n\nLISTEN FOR YOURSELF:"
