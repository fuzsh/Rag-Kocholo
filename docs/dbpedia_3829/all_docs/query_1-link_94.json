        "text": "M&S Food has rewritten the Status Quo hit Rockin’ All Over the World, jazzing up the lyrics to highlight its latest raft of in-store savings.\n\nThe advert has launched across the upmarket supermarket’s social media channels and will be supplemented by shorter versions across other video-focused channels such as TikTok.\n\nThe film features Status Quo playing the rejigged version of the song on M&S branded guitars, as well as cost-savvy social media influencers including Kat Saves and Budgeting Mum, and M&S floor staff.\n\nFeaturing specially rewritten lyrics to the soft rock classic, Status Quo singer Francis Rossi sings: “Oh here we are at M&S and here we go. Remarkable value means that prices are low, here we go, saving all over the store.”\n\n“The prices are low but the quality’s woah, here we go, saving all over the store”\n\nSubscribe to Marketing Beat for free\n\nSign up here to get the latest marketing news sent straight to your inbox each morning\n\nM&S marketing director Sharry Cramond explained that the concept was the idea of store colleague Jack Norbury who works in M&S Devizes store.\n\n“A colleague in one of our stores (Jack Norbury from Devizes regularly got millions of views on his store social account for M&S Food value, and he suggested to our CEO through our “Straight to Stuart programme that we should have a value song. And our CEO Stuart Machin said yes,” she wrote.\n\n“So here we have Jack featuring in our first ever value song for Marks and Spencer Food, alongside the legends that are Status Quo.”\n\nThe advert comes amid a range of other price-focused adverts and marketing drives from UK supermarkets.\n\nSainsbury’s most recent ad featured Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud uttering the words: “Remarkable, we’ve come under budget,” playing on the fact that his elaborate housing projects regularly go over budget."
