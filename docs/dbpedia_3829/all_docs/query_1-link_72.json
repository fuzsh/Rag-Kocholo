        "text": "&nbsp\n\n\"ROCKIN' ALL OVER THE YEARS\" - Status Quo in the year 1982\n\nconcerts, publications, charts, miscellaneous\n\nThe year 1982 - at the beginning of the new year there were rumours about Status Quo what drummer will come after John Coghlan had left the band and what if they found nobody. In January the band announced that they found a new drummer, Pete Kircher. Soon the recordings of the new studio-album continued. And when the news came up of a new UK tour in April and May, the Quo fans were entusiastic as ever. In April the new album \"1+9+8+2\" was released and it became a major hit album with another No.1 in UK. Most notable the show at the N.E.C. in Birmingham at the 14th of May. It was a charity show for \"Princes Trust\" and it was the first rock concert ever that a member (Prince Charles) of the royal family attended. A single was released from this show \"Caroline\" and in 1983 a video of this show is released. The reputation of the band is such high, that the 3-LP-compilation \"From the makers of\" peaked at No.3 of the UK charts.\n\nAll known concerts of the year 1982: ...more\n\nPictures:german cover of the single 'Jealousy' and Ticket Birmingham N.E.C., the 'Princes Trust' show.
