        "text": "When Roy and I lived in Yancey, I would often take my girls for walks around Yancey Proper. Down the block, to the left, past the churches and fire station and down to the Post Office to check the mail. Sometimes we’d go across the street to the Yancey Store and get a push pop. There was a house around the corner from us that I had seen before, a green tile house with arched entryways, that had stood empty for as long as I’d been visiting or living there. On this day, though, I noticed a chair sitting on the front porch, right by the door, like it had been used every day. I took a photo of this scene, and wasn’t quite sure why. But I thought there was a song in that photo somehow.\n\nA few months later, my friends Jason Eady and Adam Hood shared a show with me in Luckenbach. After the show, we went to Fredericksburg to write and I showed them this photo. We sat down that day and wrote this song about the person who sat in that chair. Today, this house still stands. The weeds are a bit taller and thicker, but the chair hasn’t moved."
