        "text": "Children for generations have enjoyed their parents, or grandparents, saying or singing nursery rhymes to them. The comforting rhythm of the verses means that even at a very early age, babies recognise familiar nursery rhymes.\n\nThey start by anticipating what is going to come, be it a word, sound or action, and later they grasp the words and love joining in, over and over again! It’s the very repetition that they enjoy.\n\nSome of the most traditional nursery rhymes have meanings which are irrelevant and pretty meaningless in this modern day and age, but still the rhymes live on from generation to generation. Some are clearly educational, teaching little ones to count and increase their vocabulary along the way.\n\nA few, like London Bridge Is Falling Down, have various versions (possibly depending on where you live) and yours may differ from the one your partner heard as a toddler…\n\nThe benefits of teaching your kids nursery rhymes\n\nThere are a lot of benefits of teaching your child or baby nursery rhymes from a young age; one being their cognitive development. The repetition found in the rhymes are good for your little one's brain and teaches them how language works while also building on their memory capabilities. In addition, nursery rhymes also help to develop inferencing skills - both when encountering new words and in reading comprehension later in life.\n\nBaby nursery rhymes are also really important to your little one's speech development. They can help young children develop auditory skills such as being able to tell the difference between sounds and develop the ear for the music of words. Rhymes like the ones listed below also help children to articulate words, practise pitch and volume, and enunciate early by saying them over and over again.\n\nOur list of nursery rhymes\n\nJust in case you’re a little rusty on some of the classics, here is Emma’s Diary’s selection of some of the best known traditional nursery rhymes… get ready to sing along!\n\nLondon Bridge is Falling Down (Short Version)\n\nLondon Bridge is falling down,\n\nFalling down, falling down.\n\nLondon Bridge is falling down,\n\nMy fair lady.\n\nBuild it up with wood and clay,\n\nWood and clay, wood and clay,\n\nBuild it up with wood and clay,\n\nMy fair lady.\n\nWood and clay will wash away,\n\nWash away, wash away,\n\nWood and clay will wash away,\n\nMy fair lady.\n\nBuild it up with iron and steel,\n\nIron and steel, iron and steel,\n\nBuild it up with iron and steel,\n\nMy fair lady.\n\nIron and steel will bend and bow,\n\nBend and bow, bend and bow,\n\nIron and steel will bend and bow,\n\nMy fair lady.\n\nBuild it up with silver and gold,\n\nSilver and gold, silver and gold,\n\nBuild it up with silver and gold,\n\nMy fair lady.\n\nThe best Mr Tumble Nursery Rhymes\n\nWho doesn’t love Mr Tumble?
