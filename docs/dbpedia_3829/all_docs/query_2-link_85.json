        "text": "He, he observes you from where he sits\n\nYou, it unnerves you, you lose your wits\n\nHe, he ignites you with eyes aflame\n\nYou, it excites you, you like the game\n\nAnd I, in my chair, though I hardly speak\n\nI notice each innuendo\n\nAnd I, in my chair, I′m stricken with fear\n\nAt seeing the end so near\n\nHe, out to win you, he woos with style\n\nYou, you continue to coyly smile\n\nHe, with his quarry on hunting ground\n\nYou, only sorry that I'm around\n\nAnd I, in my chair, though I hardly speak\n\nI see just how well he′s doing\n\nAnd I, in my chair, I'm trying to hide\n\nThe dread that I hold inside\n\nHe, his eyes flatter, your glances touch\n\nYou, now you chatter a bit too much\n\nHe, like a gypsy, he serenades\n\nYou, you grow tipsy, your laugh cascades\n\nAnd I, in my chair, though I hardly speak\n\nMy heart's on the verge of crying\n\nAnd I, in my chair, my heart understands\n\nLove is now changing hands\n\nNo, no, it′s nothing, a little headache only\n\nMaybe I had one too many?\n\nWell, we′d better go home now\n\nYes, this was a beautiful evening\n\nIndeed, a beautiful evening\n\nWriter(s): Charles Aznavour<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
