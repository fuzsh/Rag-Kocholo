I’ve been doing just that on the ‘Tunes & Chat’ tour but I was keen to show them some more love. Collectors and lovers of Quo have always treasured vinyl editions and so do I; this record sounds and looks fantastic – the 10” format feels really special. The songs have been recorded in an informal but affectionate way, with some of the studio chatter retained. It’s been interesting to pick out a handful of favourites from my history and get to know them again more than 50 years down the line.
