        "text": "Francine Honey Invites You To ‘Come Sit In My Chair’ For An Intimate Folk Journey\n\nOttawa-based Americana artist Francine Honey pays tribute to the charm of old-fashioned barbers while showing love to fathers everywhere in her heartwarming new single “Come Sit In My Chair” — available now!\n\nA personal anecdote on the profound connection found in getting your hair done, “Come Sit In My Chair” is a gentle reminder to appreciate the little moments in life.\n\nDrawing inspiration from her family’s local salon in the small town of Tweed, Ontario, Francine Honey shares the intimate story of her father, a beloved barber in the community. Claude’s Hair Salon was a gathering place where locals would sit in his chair, share their stories, and receive a rejuvenating haircuts that breathed new life into their spirits.\n\nProduced and recorded live-off-the-floor in Nashville, “Come Sit In My Chair” brings together an extraordinary ensemble of musicians. Grammy-nominated Neilson Hubbard expertly produced and mixed the track while lending his exceptional drumming skills. The stellar lineup includes renowned musicians Pat Buchanan and Juan Solorzano on guitars, Dean Marold on bass, and Barry Walsh on piano. Dylan Alldredge engineered the recording at Skinny Elephant Recording Studios, and Jim Demain meticulously handled the mastering at YES Master Studios.\n\nThis musical endeavour is inspired by the dedication, commitment, unwavering moral code, and work ethic exhibited by those in the hairdressing profession, like Honey’s father, Claude. Through his work, he became a confidant to many and helped shape the small town of Tweed, not uncommon with local barbers in many towns worldwide, furthering the song’s universal appeal.\n\nVibrant energy and family pride shine through with “Come Sit In My Chair,” particularly when Honey describes the enthusiastic work environment and beaming positivity radiating from Claude’s Hair Salon whenever a happy customer came into the salon.\n\n“The hair fell down,\n\nand He danced around the Chair as he crafted a style\n\nThe Swish of the scissors, the Buzz of the clippers,\n\n‘fore you knew it, a brand new profile.”\n\nAlong with the new single, a music video for “Come Sit In My Chair” was released on June 30th featuring Claude the Barber himself in Tweed, Ontario, where it all started. Scenes from Honey’s childhood are recreated, including a shot from when Honey was a little girl standing on a stool to cut Claude’s hair!\n\nWatch the video for “Come Sit In My Chair” below and learn more about Francine via our mini-interview.\n\nYou’ve been in this space before, and good to see you again! What’s been going on since your last single?\n\nI’m very happy to be back in the space too! It’s been a busy time since my last single, I’ve been working on my life story in song. I’ve been doing a lot of writing and recording. I thought this would be one album’s worth of songs that has grown into a double album and maybe a triple at this point! Instead of spending any more time trying to figure out how to release such a large project, I decided to start releasing singles at a rate of a song a month for now. I simply can’t wait for these songs to reach the world anymore. This song “Come Sit In My Chair” is the first one out of the gate! When I’m not revving up for my next single, I’m working on the one that’s to come after that! I’ve been shooting plenty of videos too for the singles and that’s been a tonne of fun as well. I love the visual representation of each song. Since I’m not a touring artist like many, I invest time and energy in each video.\n\nTell us about the process of writing and recording “Come Sit In My Chair?”\n\n“Come Sit In My Chair” was one of the first songs I wrote after picking up the guitar again in 2008. I started working on a self-produced project with songs written for and about my family. My Dad was celebrating 50 years as the Barber in my hometown of Tweed, Ontario. I wrote this song for his party and performed it live for him. I still remember how nervous I was (literally shaking in my boots) and his reaction is forever in my mind. A very special moment for both of us. The song’ has gone through many iterations over time, and as I was recording it with the band in Nashville that I knew it was finally complete! They all did such an amazing job breathing a brand new sound into a song that had started as a recording I had done on my home computer in my living room over a decade ago. Getting to tell my Dad’s story and the impact he’s had on his community was important, but it was also important to talk about the connection that everyone has with their barber or hair stylist throughout their life.\n\nThere is a photo of me when I was young pretending to cut my Dad’s hair. Since I am lucky enough to still have him around, we re-created that scene as well as the old-time feel of the barber shop in Tweed and shot a music video. I actually cut my Dad’s hair! It was a very special moment that I hope you will check out.\n\nCan you talk about your musical community and collaborators for the song?\n\nIn this case, I wrote the song on my own, however, each producer I’ve worked with has provided their input. In fact, Lang Bliss at Diff’rent Wirld Productions prompted me to write a new introduction to the song during one of our recording sessions. When Neilson Hubbard, who produced this version heard it, we wanted it to be heard so we cut it down to the necessary parts to impart the story highlighting the impact on the community. I have been very fortunate to have such a broad musical community. I collaborate with writers from my songwriting groups here in Canada, Nashville, Texas, and in the UK.\n\nWhat values do you think you got from your father that you recognize by writing the song?\n\nI think the biggest thing was my desire to create a community and help those within it. When I started doing music full-time it was with the intent to help and to heal people who listen to my music. To learn their stories and tell them in ways that could connect people together and let my listeners know that no matter what troubles they’re going through, we’re all in this together and their voice is always heard. When my father cut hair for decades, he always listened to their stories, helped them as much as he could, and used his time with them in his chair to let people know there was always that barber in town who’d be willing to listen and understand them. I remember him telling me that every time someone sat in his chair “it is their time with me”. If another customer would come into the shop, he’d wave, say hello, give them an estimated time for a wait, and then return his attention back to his customer. He also remembered everything he could about that person and wanted them to feel heard and that someone cared. That followed me through life when I worked for the government meeting with people to make their lives easier through the use of technology and to this day, when I sit down with someone to write a song with them or about them, or if I’m on stage performing or talking to someone afterward, I want them to know that I’m listening and that they matter. Caring for and honouring others, compassion, patience, respect, integrity, humility, kindness, loyalty, and charity are some of the values I witnessed in my father.\n\nWhat’s the one song by a Canadian you wished you wrote?\n\nLeonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”"
