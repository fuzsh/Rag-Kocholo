        "text": "Australian rock music: it's not got the best of reputations, has it? Quite right too, you might conclude, with more famous recent exports such as retro-fetishist goons Jet and Wolfmother.\n\nBut I still have a soft spot for You Am I, the awfully named trio-turned-quartet who've been Australian indie fixtures for almost two decades, despite barely troubling the attentions of fans, let alone charts, elsewhere.\n\nI first encountered them while living for a time in Sydney in the 90s, a time when the city's music scene was dominated by gormless \"tribute\" acts, who generally impersonated overseas bands too busy, or too defunct, to tour the country for real.\n\nLed by gangling music über-geek Tim Rogers, the band's reputation was initially based around frenetic and sweaty live shows, one of which caught the attention of visiting Sonic Youth guitarist Lee Ranaldo, who flew them to Minnesota to record their debut album.\n\nThe resulting LP was patchy, but included a couple of fantastic singles, of which Berlin Chair is the pick.\n\nI've still got no idea what the lyrics mean, if anything – the internet tells me the eponymous chair is a statue in Canberra, where Rogers once lived – but they're largely immaterial. Driven by a fuzzy, staccato guitar riff and thunderous drumming, this is a straightforward but wonderful slice of that genre where pop, indie and rock collide.\n\nBut You Am I's career trajectory, at least away from home, was a disappointment. They made a concerted effort to break the UK around the time of their hugely more polished third album, Hourly Daily, but to little effect. Back in London, I went to see them play a slightly depressing gig to a mainly Aussie-expat audience in the top room of a pub in Camden.\n\nThey also spent a fair bit of time supporting a series of long-forgotten acts on tour, an experience Rogers later chronicled in a wonderfully caustic solo song, Hi, We're the Support Band (\"Swing your arms for the boys from radio/ We're the support band – we ain't the ones you know\").\n\nSubsequently, to my ears, You Am I ossified into slightly same-y purveyors of retro-styled poppy rock, and I lost interest a bit. But I still love this one."
