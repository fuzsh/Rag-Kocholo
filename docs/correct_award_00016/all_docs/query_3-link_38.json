        "text": "The Nobel Prize winners of 2018 will be announced during the first week of October, starting with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday October 1.\n\nAs most of us are biased towards physics: The physics prize will be announced Tuesday October 2 @ 11.45 (Stockholm time - CEST) at the earliest.\n\nThe other announcement times are available on the official Nobel Prize homepage. All announcements are typically broadcast live on https://www.nobelprize.org/\n\nUnlike last year, where the discovery of gravitational waves was the clear frontrunner (and also won the prize), there is no clear frontrunner for the physics prize. Anybody who dares to take a stab at speculating who will be the happy receiver of a phone call from the Royal Academy of Sciences on October 2? (Even if it is in the middle of the night if that person is based in America ...)\n\nEdit: So let me start the speculation a bit. I think it is way past time to award the prize to a woman again. There are many women who have made important discoveries and it is unreasonable to ignore those accomplishments. I have long considered Lene Hau to be a frontrunner and she seems to appear on many science writers' wish lists as well.\n\nHere are a few who I think are deserving of the prize (focusing mostly on areas relevant to the biomedical sciences, which is my area of expertise):\n\nPhysiology and Medicine:\n\nCancer immunotherapy. James Allison for his contributions to checkpoint inhibitor therapy; and Steven Rosenberg and Zelig Eshhar for their contributions to CAR-T therapy. Cancer immunotherapy is one of the hottest areas in biomedical research, and it was largely started by the work of these three scientits in the 80s and 90s. The discoveries they made have been translated to the clinic and have led to FDA-approved anti-cancer therapies. (Of course, this may be one reason why the Nobel committee might wait a few years on awarding the prize to these individuals, as they might not want to be seen as endorsing commercial products).\n\nRegulatory T-cells. Alexander Rudensky, Shimon Sakaguchi and Ethan Shevach for the discovery of regulatory T-cells. Along the same lines, these scientists discovered and characterized a new population of immune cells, regulatory T-cells (Treg), which act as a self-check to keep the immune system from destroying the body. The work is incredibly important for understanding the immune system, autoimmune diseases, and cancer immunotherapy.\n\nHistone modifications. C. David Allis and Michael Grunstein for their work on elucidating the roles of histone proteins and their chemical modifications in the regulation of gene expression. This topic is an incredibly important, fundamental mechanism of gene regulation that has not yet been recognized by the committee (and is closest to my area of research). However, there are many people who have contributed to this field, so narrowing it down to three or fewer individuals may be difficult. These two, however, were just awarded the Lasker prize, so maybe the consensus is trending to these two as the ones most deserving or recognition for their work in the field.\n\nChemistry (again, mostly focusing on areas related to biology):\n\nCRISPR. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuel Charpentier for elucidating the mechanism of DNA recognition and cleavage by the CRISPR-Cas9 system. For these two the question is not if, but when. CRISPR gene editing is an incredibly useful tool in the biomedical sciences, and it will likely have huge implications for society as it enables scientists to very easily modify the genes of many species, including humans. Some may say the prize is too soon (the key papers came out in 2012 and 2013), but other slam dunk prizes have been awarded prizes on similar timescales (Yamanaka's work published in 2006 on induced pleuripotent stem cells led to him wining the prize in 2012). While the committee may have been hesitant to award credit while patent littigation was ongoing, there was a ruling on the patent dispute earlier this year, which may remove these concerns. Feng Zhang, who built off of Doudna and Charpentier's work to figure out how to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene editing, could also be recognized.\n\nOptogenetics. Karl Deisseroth, Peter Hegemann and Gero Miesenbock for the development of optogenetics. Optogenetics sounds like something from science fiction: designing genetically-encoded devices that allow scientists to precisely control cells by shining light on them. These scientists, however, made that fiction a reality by developing light-gated ion channels that allowed them to control the firing of neurons just by shining light on the neurons. Interestingly, Feng Zhang (mentioned above for his work on CRISPR) was Karl Deisseroth's graduate student so there may be a race between the two to see who gets a Nobel first.\n\nYgggdrasil said:\n\nChemistry (again, mostly focusing on areas related to biology):\n\nCRISPR.

Feng Zhang, who built off of Doudna and Charpentier's work to figure out how to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene editing, could also be recognized.\n\nJust out of curiosity as a layman in both chemistry and medicine: Is it 100% clear to you that the CRISPR prize should be in chemistry rather than physiology/medicine?\n\ndipole said:\n\nCan you give specific examples of women who should have won, but didn't because of some gender based bias in the selection process? Should the Nobel prizes be 50/50 men and women, and if there aren't enough women should we just artificially lower the bar for women in order to boost their nobel prize count?\n\nSorry, but this question shows profound ignorance of the history of the Nobel Prizes. There are many examples of women who arguably should have won a Nobel Prize, but did not. Of course, you can never prove that it was based on gender bias, but you asked for specific examples so let me just mention Lise Meitner who definitely should have shared the prize (in chemistry, but it might as well have been a physics prize) with Otto Hahn.\n\nNo, it should not be 50/50, but women in physics today are at least as prominent as men based on how big of a portion of the community they represent. To not have awarded a single prize to a woman for over 50 years is ridiculous.\n\nOrodruin said:\n\nJust out of curiosity as a layman in both chemistry and medicine: Is it 100% clear to you that the CRISPR prize should be in chemistry rather than physiology/medicine?\n\nDoudna and Charpentier's work was primarily biochemical, and similar work in molecular biology and biochemistry has been awarded the chemistry prize rather than the physiology or medicine prize. For example, in the last 10 years, we've seen Chemistry Prizes for the discovery and development of green fluorescent protein (2008), studies of the structure and function of the ribosome (2009), studies of G-protein-coupled receptors (2012), and mechanistic studies of DNA repair (2015). Doudna did her postdoctoral work with Tom Cech, building off his work on catalytic RNAs, for which he won the 1989 Chemistry Prize. Doudna and Charpentier's work focused on figuring out how an important biological molecule works, and traditionally that sort of work has been awarded the Chemistry prize.\n\nOn the medicine side, there have been awards for biochemical work (e.g. the 2009 prize to Blackburn, Greider and Szostak for their work on telomerase), but here, the work was very relevant to human biology and human disease. (Note: Szostak was Doudna's PhD advisor, though Doudna did not work on telomerase in Szostak's lab). Part of the CRISPR story that is interesting to people is its role as a bacterial antiviral defense mechanisms, which would not really fit into physiology and medicine. Furthermore, although there are ongoing clinical trials using CRISPR, no therapies based on CRISPR have led to any breakthroughs in the treatment of disease (of course, the same could be said for RNAi, the subject of the 2006 prize, given that the first FDA-approved therapy using RNAi was just approved this year).\n\ndipole said:\n\nCan you give specific examples of women who should have won, but didn't because of some gender based bias in the selection process? Should the Nobel prizes be 50/50 men and women, and if there aren't enough women should we just artificially lower the bar for women in order to boost their nobel prize count?\n\nIt is difficult to \"prove\" that these women were overlooked due to gender biased biases, because one needs clear proof of that. But in many of these cases, when we look at it now, they were head-scratchers on why they were overlooked while the colleagues that they were working with received the prize:\n\n1. Rosalind Franklin. She essentially did ALL of the x-ray diffraction work that established the helical structure of the DNA.\n\n2. Vera Rubin. Enough said.\n\n3. Jocelyn Bell Burnell. Even astronomers were criticizing the Nobel Committee for overlooking what was really HER discovery, and gave the prize to her supervisor instead.\n\n4. Chien-Shiung Wu. The \"First Lady of Physics\" managed to get her colleagues to win the Nobel Prize based on what she did.\n\n5. Mildred Dresselhaus. Considering all the accolades given to her while she was alive, I am still shock that she has not been awarded the prize. Many people attributed her to the concept of the possible existence of graphene well before it was discovered.\n\netc...\n\nZz.\n\nZeGato said:\n\nIf there were researchers that also deserved to receive the prize and didn't (Einstein for his work on relativity comes to mind), it doesn't make sense to give any meaning to it. It's actually very anti-scientific to have a few people judging what has merit and what doesn't to receive their grand prize. It's good for hype, sure, but it doesn't have any meaning in Science.\n\nBut there is a difference between \"science\" and the \"practice of science\". The latter is still a human endeavor!\n\nEverything about the practice of science requires someone, some group, or some institution to decide. A group of human beings decided if someone should be hired for a tenure-track position. Another had to decide on whether funding to be given to some research proposal. Then some steering committee will determine if a particular area should be given top priority, etc... etc. Every step in this human endeavor requires some people to judge and decide on something!\n\nAnd you are directly and indirectly benefiting from these decisions, whether you realize it or not.\n\nZz.\n\nYgggdrasil said:\n\nChemistry (again, mostly focusing on areas related to biology):\n\nCRISPR. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuel Charpentier for elucidating the mechanism of DNA recognition and cleavage by the CRISPR-Cas9 system. For these two the question is not if, but when. CRISPR gene editing is an incredibly useful tool in the biomedical sciences, and it will likely have huge implications for society as it enables scientists to very easily modify the genes of many species, including humans.

Feng Zhang, who built off of Doudna and Charpentier's work to figure out how to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene editing, could also be recognized.\n\nIf Doudna and Charpentier get the Nobel Prize, the third person should be Virginijus Šikšnys, whose group discovered it first.\n\nDoes TALENS (an earlier technology than CRISPR) deserve a prize?\n\nZapperZ said:\n\nIt is difficult to \"prove\" that these women were overlooked due to gender biased biases, because one needs clear proof of that. But in many of these cases, when we look at it now, they were head-scratchers on why they were overlooked while the colleagues that they were working with received the prize:\n\n1. Rosalind Franklin.

Considering all the accolades given to her while she was alive, I am still shock that she has not been awarded the prize. Many people attributed her to the concept of the possible existence of graphene well before it was discovered.\n\netc...\n\nZz.\n\nI think Franklin was technically not overlooked, as she had died. Would you include Lise Meitner among your etceteras?\n\nf95toli said:\n\nI think the question here is if the discovery was really \"physics\" as such; although I guess that could be said for the integrated circuit as well.\n\nDahlen's system was used in countless lighthouses around the world for close of half a century and made automatic lighthouses much more practical. Hence, giving him the price was probably very much in the spirit of what Nobel.had in mind.\n\nAlso, the sun valve is a very, very clever invention.\n\nThis is a good point. The discussion might benefit from the formulation of Alfred Nobel's will:\n\none part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics\n\nThe main question is probably what Nobel intended by an \"invention within the field of physics\". Just from the wording, one could ask the question whether a theoretical framework is an \"invention\" (e.g., would this include Noether's theorem?) or if invention is intended to be of a more practical nature. Given what I know of Alfred Nobel, I would tend to favour the latter interpretation, which is also what the Nobel Committee has historically done, but of course there is no way of actually asking him.\n\nVanadium 50 said:\n\nNils Gustaf Dalen, \"\"invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys\".\n\nI want to stand up for the small guy a little on this after a quick google, Dalen lost his sight in an accident during an experiment and could not attend the Nobel ceremony.\n\nCommitment for his cause if nothing else and a high price to pay. With the whole women thing, one has to remember women hardly had any rights at all until fairly recently so you would expect society to reflect that.\n\nWomen did not vote in the UK till 1918 by which time Marie Curie had already won two Nobel prizes which is a nod in the direction of science out running societal prejudice.\n\nIts also worth looking at the attitude to education/University in terms of when women were allowed to attend and study for a degree, hardly surprising not as women could get a look in.\n\nReading a little history Jocelyn Bell probably should have been in with a shout.\n\nOrodruin said:\n\nSorry, but this question shows profound ignorance of the history of the Nobel Prizes. There are many examples of women who arguably should have won a Nobel Prize, but did not. Of course, you can never prove that it was based on gender bias, but you asked for specific examples so let me just mention Lise Meitner who definitely should have shared the prize (in chemistry, but it might as well have been a physics prize) with Otto Hahn.\n\nNo, it should not be 50/50, but women in physics today are at least as prominent as men based on how big of a portion of the community they represent.

Considering all the accolades given to her while she was alive, I am still shock that she has not been awarded the prize. Many people attributed her to the concept of the possible existence of graphene well before it was discovered.\n\netc...\n\nZz.\n\noops you already pointed this out\n\nOrodruin said:\n\nYou need to check your history books. Einstein did win the Nobel prize. The reason was ”for his services to Theoretical Physics, in particular the photoelectric effect”. His services to theoretical physics certainly includes relativity, even if the committee did not want to put it in black on white.\n\nAlso, your line of argumentation is flawed. That there have been men who were overlooked in no way compensates for systematically overlooking women who many times did a larger part of the work. Bringing this up is whataboutism.\n\nI didn't bring up that fact to argue against any of that. You're the one bringing up the fact that women's work was overlooked in the past, and because of that \"it's about time the prize goes to a woman\", as if two wrongs make a right (wrong in the sense of weighing in the scientist's gender to make a decision)."
