        "text": "STOCKHOLM, Dec. 11  In the slanting northern sunlight of December, it is difficult to shake the impression that the answer to one of the most enduring mysteries of science and culture is waiting to be discovered here somewhere, casting its long shadow on the cobblestones and quays.\n\nThat mystery is not the nature of existence or the ultimate fates of humanity and the cosmos, although it does have at least something to do with why scientists and artists pursue those questions so doggedly. Rather, it is the seemingly immutable prestige, influence and high-voltage dazzle of the Nobel Prizes.\n\nFirst awarded in 1901, the Nobels have built up almost a century of tradition. King Carl Gustaf of Sweden handed out this year's prizes for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, economics and literature here on Sunday evening at a white-tie ceremony in the Stockholm Concert Hall. South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, received this year's Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on the same day.\n\nThe reason for the Nobels' staying power could be as simple as the one given by Jack S. Kilby, the taciturn engineer for Texas Instruments who received a share of the physics prize for having built the first integrated circuit in 1958 in Texas. \"They've done this 99 times,\" Mr. Kilby said gruffly at a splendid reception given last Thursday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which actually chooses the winners in physics, chemistry and economics. \"It should've boiled down to a system and it has. A very good one.\"\n\nTrue. But others have pointed out that the prizes were created by the will of the Swedish-born inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, in a time when scientific research had a radically different face than it does today  before giant collaborations like the human genome project and billion-dollar particle physics experiments, before the explosion of competing research groups in areas like biomedicine and microelectronics, before disciplines like the behavioral sciences and quantum computing even existed.\n\nHow can this seeming anachronism still command the world's attention, captivate the imagination of the most utilitarian scientists and technologists and cause vast shifts of research funding as officials scramble to follow the Nobel committees' lead? (At a news conference before the reception, Dr. Zhores I. Alferov, the Russian who also took a share of the physics prize and has the unmistakable air of an international star in the making, told everyone how bored he was by constant questions about the sagging fortunes of science in his country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He claimed that recently, \"the budget was increased 10 percent, mostly due to Nobel Prize.\")\n\nIrrationally romantic as it sounds, some of the answers do become clearer by walking the streets and corridors of this city, where closer inspection reveals the depth of the tradition the Nobels have engendered both in Sweden's academic system and in the society at large. The job of sifting and reporting on hundreds of Nobel nominations received each year is approached by scientists here as a solemn charge whose success or failure reflects on their home institutions and their country, and whose ultimate and entirely uncynical goal is to make the world a better place for humanity.\n\nBacking their judgments with the cultural horsepower generated by a century of tradition, the various committees, academies and universities involved are able  like almost no other institution  to speak with authority to nearly all strata of international society, from intellectuals and scientists to the ordinary citizens of South Korea who clustered around televisions and thrilled to the news that their president had won the Peace Prize.\n\nNobel officials are acutely aware of the criticism and controversy that some of their choices have generated, as well as the more common approbation. \"I think you approach this with great humility,\" said Erling Norrby, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. \"As you go along, you see the reaction of the world, and you say, 'Well, we had a good verdict this year.' \"\n\nProfessor Norrby, like other Nobel officials, peppers visitors with questions about controversial elements of the prizes, for example the custom of awarding the science Nobels to no more than three people in an era when decentralized collaborations are becoming the rule in some disciplines.\n\nOfficials also appear to be still sorting out the mixed reaction to this year's physics prize, which remains the bedrock of the Nobel institution and is always delivered first by the king. Eschewing the kind of fundamental research usually honored by the physics Nobels, the prize focused on mostly technological breakthroughs that made possible things like personal computers and the tiny solid-state lasers at the heart of compact disc players and bar code readers. The chemistry prize also focused on electronics advances.\n\nAnders Barany, the secretary of the five-person committee that recommends winners in physics to the full academy, pointed out that historical precedents could be found even for the highly applied nature of this year's award. In 1912, for example, Nils Dalén, a Swedish engineer, won for an invention that improved the regulation of lighting in lighthouses and buoys.\n\nProfessor Barany, in a wry but circumspect observation that may or may not have been a hint about this year's deliberations, said that much more fundamental advances had initially been considered. \"There was a meeting,\" he said, \"and the door was closed. And when the door was opened, it was Dalén.\"\n\nTo anchor its tradition even deeper, the academy is expanding its collection of historical records and scientific instruments related to the Nobel Prizes in a wing of its main building, said Karl Grandin, assistant director of the academy's Center for the History of Science. Flipping through a huge bound volume there, Dr. Grandin opened to the original, typed report that led to Albert Einstein's 1921 Nobel Prize. The academy considers the volumes \"their treasure,\" he said, and they become available to selected historians only 50 years after a prize is awarded.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation, which awards the prize money (a little under $1 million per prize this year), is also mulling the nature of creativity itself with a pair of identical exhibits on the Nobel Prizes. One exhibit will open in Stockholm next spring, while the other will travel the world.\n\nThe exhibit, which will combine Nobel artifacts, explanatory films, art and multimedia excursions into history, will explore a central question raised by the modern era of collaborative science: what is the relation between the milieu and the individual in stimulating creative work?\n\nExplorations into places that have exploded with creative work at various points of history will help illuminate the question, but Svante Lindqvist, the director of the museum that will contain the exhibit, cautions that the goal is not to settle matters definitively. \"We don't provide answers,\" Professor Lindqvist said. \"We want the visitor to come out confused at a higher level.\"\n\nThe exhibit could stoke the intense level of interest in the Nobels in Swedish society. The awards ceremony alone usually rates more than six hours of uninterrupted television coverage, said Thomas von Heijne, a correspondent for Swedish television.\n\nThomas Östros, who heads the Swedish ministry of education and science and who turned up at one of the week's gatherings, said that the Nobel Prizes are \"very tightly connected to Sweden's self-perception,\" adding, \"It's one of the strongest Swedish trademarks that exists.\"\n\nFor all the wider manifestations of their influence, the Nobel Prizes still retain their formidable stature chiefly because the committees have, for the most part, chosen a long succession of gloriously talented scientists, writers and peacemakers. Especially in the sciences, the continuity of the prizes is emphasized when the work of one laureate builds upon that of an earlier laureate, creating \"a sort of apostolic succession,\" said Michael Sohlman, executive director of the Nobel Foundation.\n\nBut just as with every other aspect of the Nobels, a deeper sense of that succession can be found in the byways of Stockholm. As flashbulbs went off during the news conference and the physics and chemistry winners wrapped themselves in the mantle of quantum mechanics, the once-revolutionary science that underlies all their discoveries, a small, almost elfin woman named Ruth Braunziger stood smiling on the edge of the melee of cameras and reporters."
