        "text": "Full Name: Nils Gustaf Dalén\n\nProfession: Industrialist and Inventor\n\nBiography: Gustaf Dalén was a Swedish industrialist and inventor, known for his contributions to lighthouse technology. He was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"his invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys.\"\n\nDalén initially managed his family's farm before pursuing a technical education. Encouraged by Gustaf de Laval, Dalén attended Chalmers University of Technology, earning a Master's degree and a Doctorate.\n\nIn 1906, Dalén joined the Gas Accumulator Company (later AGA) as chief engineer. By 1909, he became the managing director of AGA, transforming it into an innovative company in Sweden. Dalén's work primarily focused on acetylene, a hydrocarbon gas used in lighthouse illumination. He invented the AGA cooker and the Dalén light, which included the sun valve, allowing the light to operate only at night, significantly conserving fuel.\n\nDalén's inventions revolutionized lighthouse equipment with their reliability and efficiency. His \"Dalen Flasher\" reduced gas consumption by over 90%, and his sun valve-equipped lighthouses could function unattended for extended periods. AGA lighthouses were eventually installed in locations such as the Panama Canal.\n\nTragically, Dalén lost his sight in an acetylene explosion in 1912 while testing safety devices. Despite his blindness, he continued to lead AGA until his death. In recognition of his achievements, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1912.\n\nDalén married Elma Persson in 1901 and had four children. He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and had over 100 patents to his name, including the AGA cooker and the Dalén light.\n\nBorn: November 30, 1869\n\nBirthplace: Stenstorp, Sweden\n\nStar Sign: Sagittarius"
