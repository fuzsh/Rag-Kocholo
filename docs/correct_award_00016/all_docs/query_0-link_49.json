        "text": "Nils Gustaf DalÃ©n (November 30, 1869 - December 9, 1937) was a Swedish inventor and industrialist, the founder of AGA, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1912 for his work on automatic gas regulator controlled buoys.\n\nDalÃ©n was born in Stenstorp and earned his Master's degree and a Doctorate at the Chalmers University of Technology. DalÃ©ns most important and most well known invention is the sun valve which made the AGA lighthouse possible. DalÃ©n was blinded in a gas explosion accident earlier the same year as he was awarded the prize (1912). This has led to speculation that he was selected partly out of sympathy.\n\nDespite his blindness, DalÃ©n remained in control of AGA until 1937.\n\nThe award of the Nobel Prize to DalÃ©n has sometimes been viewed with controversy, but was actually closer to the general terms of Nobel's will than most awards in physics. DalÃ©n made developments in acetylene chemistry to get a very bright light, developed safe storage methods, and then engineered a special valve that was controlled by the sun, so that the resulting buoys would only operate at night, prolonging their life to about a year. To a rugged coastal area like Scandinavia, these mass-produced long-lived minimal maintenance buoys were a significant boon to safety and livelihood.\n\nLinks\n\nAbout Gustaf DalÃ©n"
