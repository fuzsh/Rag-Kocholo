        "text": "Pioneers of Science by Robert Weber, Adam Hilger, pp 310, Pounds sterling\n\n12.95\n\nOPEN this book, and you’ll find two-page biographies of the 130 Nobel\n\nlaureates in physics from the first, Wilhelm Konrad Rontgen in 1901, through\n\nto Karl Muller and Georg Bednorz, the prizewinners in 1987. My first reaction\n\nto Pioneers of Science was scepticism. By all rational standards, Albert\n\nEinstein, winner in 1921, should not be given the same amount of space as\n\nCharles-Edouard Guillaume, the winner the previous year. Moreover, what\n\ncan possibly be said about Einstein, Paul Dirac, Lev Landau or Richard Feynman\n\nthat has not been said in greater detail elsewhere? The answer is, nothing;\n\nand one should not look for anything new about such luminaries. The book’s\n\ninterest – and it is curiously interesting – comes from the relative unknowns.\n\nAs the author, Robert Weber, points out in the preface, the Nobel prize\n\nis awarded not for a lifetime’s contribution but for a particular achievement.\n\nThus we find in the list a number of individuals who are hardly household\n\nnames. Many of us will have difficulty recalling the scientific contributions\n\nmade by Guillaume (1920), Gabriel Lippmann (1908), or Nils Gustaf Dalen\n\n(1912). And yet, as the brief biographies make clear, these were outstanding\n\nindividuals. Even the least-known of the Nobel laureates was an exceptional\n\nperson.\n\nThe list also contains some surprising omissions, of scientists of the\n\nfirst magnitude, such as Sommerfeld, Edwin Hubble, Arthur Eddington, and\n\nJohn Wheeler, which suggest that the Nobel committee is far from infallible.\n\nOther absences, such as Henry Moseley, are explained by his early death.\n\nAs Weber points out in his introduction, the Nobel prize is awarded only\n\nto the living.\n\nPioneers of Science is a book to dip into, rather than to read through\n\nsteadily. But it has a strange fascination, and one dips into it again and\n\nagain.\n\n(For the curious: Lippmann won the prize for his method of colour photography;\n\nDalen, for the invention of automatic regulators used on beacons and light\n\nbuoys; Guillaume, for the discovery of low-expansion nickel alloys.)"
