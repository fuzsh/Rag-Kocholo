        "text": "Nils Gustaf Dal�n (November 30, 1869 - December 9, 1937) was a Swedish inventor and founder of AGA. Laureate for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1912. Dal�n was blinded in a gas explosion accident earlier the same year, and it was speculated in whether the award which was not uncontroversial among phycisists may have been influenced by this. Despite his blindness, Dal�n remained in control of AGA until 1937. Dal�n earned his Master's degree and a Doctorate at the Chalmers University of Technology."
