        "text": "Gustaf Dalén was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on lighthouse technology. This video clip shows his birth place, Stenstorp in Skaraborg, Sweden; the dairy where he worked in his student years; and his home “Skräddargården”, where an exhibition is on show. Highlights from the exhibition include a bicycle Gustaf Dalén constructed when he was 15 years old, and several photos, showing Gustaf Dalén among students, his wedding, and his Nobel Prize Diploma.\n\nStenstorp town is famed for its inventor. In September 1954 a film about Gustaf Dalén, “Seger i mörker” (“Victory in the Darkness”) had its premiere there."
