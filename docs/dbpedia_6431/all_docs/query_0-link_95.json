        "text": "The BMW 3 Series sedan has always been the cornerstone of the marque’s lineup. Crossover SUVs may take up a lot of market share these days, but how this sedan competes in the automotive landscape is still a solid way to read the Bavarian brand’s pulse. The 3 Series also happens to be BMW’s longest running badge, and after 49 or so years, the latest model, the 2024 BMW M340i xDrive, does its predecessors proud.\n\nThis sleek, muscular brute is quintessential German stealth, and part of a segment that’s always been categorically cool. A quick list of iconic models includes the B5-generation Audi S4, W211-generation Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG, and E39-generation BMW M5. This M340i xDrive would not be out of place on that honor roll.\n\nIn light of the current crop of models featuring the latest BMW M design—massive kidney grilles, massive wheels, and well, massive everything—the more restrained BMW era of yore feels like a long time ago. Its E39-generation M5 didn’t become an instant classic for its excessive design, but rather for packing excessive performance in something quite subdued and under the radar. Only a few exterior treatments gave away that it was packing a 4.9-liter V-8 with individual throttle bodies and an output of nearly 400 hp.\n\nRefreshingly, this LCI (Life Cycle Impulse—BMW’s word for “refreshed”) M340i follows a similar traditional formula: Just a trunk badge and some sporty side mirrors are the only real giveaways that it’s a proper high-performance machine. Anything else on its exterior could be confused for elements found on a well-optioned, lower-tier 330i. It’s an overall handsome package, presenting restrained styling with a determined face that leads back to an athletically proportioned four-door body. The latter is appointed with minor accents throughout to reveal a little more about the content of this vehicle’s character.\n\nPower comes from a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine—known as the B58 among BMW enthusiasts—that produces 382 hp and 369 ft lbs of torque, plus assistance from a 48-volt mild-hybrid system to help fill in the gaps. The mild-hybrid system also slightly improves fuel economy—it’s rated at 23 mpg city and 32 highway. With the output managed by an eight-speed ZF automatic gearbox and xDrive all-wheel drive system, the sedan reaches 60 mph from a stop in just over four seconds—not bad for a car weighing in at 3,988 pounds.\n\nUp against the 450+ hp found in the M2, M3, and M4, the output may not sound all that enticing, but between its whip-crack shifts and fast-revving turbo engine, the M340i is a riot to rev out pretty much everywhere, particularly when set to Sport mode and when there’s ample runway ahead. While the B58’s power band is generally linear for a forced induction engine, it still shovels a healthy helping of torque in the midrange once peak boost makes its way to the intake valves. Around town, you can even hear the B58 bleed off unused boost, which is usually unheard of for a turbo BMW from the factory, but this certainly ups its theatrics.\n\nBMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive setup is useful for inclement weather, but not all that applicable in sunny Los Angeles, where we spent a week with the model. Not only that, but you’d think it would impede BMW’s other proud tradition, building fast sedans that’ll slide around a corner with effortless precision. Thankfully, the car’s rear wheels receive most of the power, which is then split via a limited-slip M differential. Within three taps on the 14.9-inch infotainment screen, traction control can be turned off to enable some xDrive-aided bouts of oversteer. When it’s time to power out, simply straighten the wheel and stomp on the gas—the front wheels will pull you out impressively.\n\nBMW says this current 3 Series is 25 percent stiffer than the previous, and it certainly tracks as chassis communication is quite good for the M340i’s portlier stature. You get a good idea of what’s going on at all four of its corners, and it lends itself to good overall handling. Body control is very good on canyon roads, however, whether traction control is on or off, understeer rears its ugly head while accelerating through long off-camber sweepers. Anywhere else, it offers a very neutral handling experience.\n\nThis muscular model’s solid-feeling front-end makes for sharp turn-in, and the steering progressively builds up a decent amount of weight in the corners. Its brake pedal is a little touchy, though its 13.7-inch front and 13.6-inch rear rotors provide ample stopping power.\n\nFinally, the 2024 BMW M340i possesses incredibly good highway manners, and when it comes to overtaking, the engine and quick-shifting transmission make easy work of anything ahead. As a nice bonus, the car’s steering firms up a bit at highway speed, making it feel more planted and sure of itself. With firm-yet-supportive sport seats, great overall visibility, and ample head and leg room for most body types, it’s a machine that easily lends itself to extended road trips."
