        "text": "The year 1913 marks the period of the silent era of Indian cinema. It can be said that at this time a new era in the history of Indian cinema began with silent films. Then came sound films in the 1930s, and for the intervening 17 years, silent films in India imitated by the several foreign silent films. “Raja Harish Chandra” was the first Indian silent film, which was released in 1913, directed and produced by Dadasaheb Phalke . The full length Indian first silent feature film’s run time is around 50 minutes and it is based on completely that time historical society, where’s the declaration is peace mental narration of the various facts of the movie and which the director of the movie searched from the various society in Indian situation. Later on the movie has converted into the talking talkie and it received the huge popularities by the audience.\n\nAs the people’s interest towards cinema was created in the society of that time, the evolution of cinema took place gradually. People’s mentality towards watching movies is created, and gradually the history of cinema around the world is created with these things. Various books related to cinema are written with the experience of experienced people. A study of the history of cinema in India reveals that the subject of cinema was a subject of special curiosity to the masses. This movie was then called ‘Bioscope’. Different types of domestic and foreign films were shown in different theater halls in different parts of India. Curious viewers would go to see them just thinking, what is the movie thing? What is basically shown there? Much of the social civilization were built through the story of these movies and then the huge crowds thronged the cinema halls. Some ancient traditional cinema halls are – ‘Howrah Cinema Hall’, ‘Chitra Cinema Hall’ and ‘New Theatres’ built by B.N Sarkar . In Mumbai there were – ‘Royal theatre’, ‘ Imperial theater’, ‘Gulshan theater’ etc.\n\nAt this time, the ‘Hatimarka banner’ began to be used in Indian cinema mainly under the influence of Bombay production. This kind of ‘Elephant Trademark’ was a kind of ‘patent symbol’ in almost every movie of Bengali cinema pioneering B.N Sarkar. The massive publicity of ‘Ye Hatimarka Company’ made a huge impact on the public mind by the public demand. Later on, in 1928-29 Chitra Cinema Hall, Calcutta under the rule of B.N Sarkar’s film ‘Hatimarka Banner’, silent films were screened in Bengali and in New Theaters those films were screened in Hindi version. Moreover, during the promotion of these silent era, films of Hollywood comedian Charlie Chaplin were shown in all these theater halls in Kolkata. Charlie Chaplin’s films were so widely circulated in India that countless people gradually became his fans.\n\nOn the eve of silent film in India, there was the excitement of discovering movies based on foreign imitations. In 1894, the discovery of Lumiere Brothers centered on silent films and during this time, a number of moving pictures were created and shown in the theaters on big screen. The rise of cinema in India is said to be the arrival of the Lumiere Brothers and the subsequent display of films with pantomime scenes by different crews. The year 1913 is the emergence of silent film in India and the year 1920 is called the ‘Golden Age’ of silent film and that golden age of Indian cinema shifted from black and white to color and so the old theaters became dilapidated and the new trend of multiplexes emerged in the early 2000s when chains like Big Cinemas, Cinemax, Fame and Broadway were leading the talkies industry. Then the silent film came to an end in the early 1920s and it was during this period that the first feature length film ‘The Jazz Singer’ was directed by Alan Crosland and produced by Warner in 1927. The American musical film ‘ The Jazz Singer’ was the first feature-length movie with synchronized dialogue. Later on, the film recieved the huge popularities in India.\n\n​The content of the original idea of ​​the silent film written in the context of the society of that time can be found in several writings of the then writer and music composer Raichand Boral. On that time, the silent film era, various actors were chosen based on their extraordinary craft and acting ability. The rise of Bombay production in India and the rise of silent films are considered in the context of the same period. Basically, silent films were developed under the rule of Bombay production and with Bombay audience’s interest in cinema, the audience’s interest in watching B.N Sarkar’s ‘New Theaters’ movies also increased in West Bengal. Then at that time and along with Bengali films, Hindi films and Tamil and Telugu films spreaded widely. Then the early talking era in Indian Cinema, the crew of B.N Sarkar’s “New Theatrers” had mastered the mechanical side of the picture very well and as a result the combined presentation of picture and sound became very popular. Camera, sound and editing work increased in cinema with the advent of this era.\n\n​The first Indian silent film ” Kalidas” was revealed in 1931 in both the languages of Tamil and Telugu. The movie “Kalidas” was first released in “Kinema Theatre” of Madras and the movie got huge popularity of it’s best themes. Mainly the film was adapted from the biographical concept of famous poet Kalidas and starred PG Venkatesan, TP Rajalakshmi and LV Prasad. Here the movie stars and is directed by HM Reddy and produced by Ardeshir Irani under his banner Imperial Films. Soon after the publication of “Kalidas” in Madras, the silent era came to an end and the spoken era was ushered in by the Imperial Theatre and with the conduction of Ardeshir Irani, who was the best director in the sound movie ‘Alam Ara’ , was released in 1931 in Bombay’s Majestic Cinema in both the languages of Hindi and Urdu.\n\nNowadays the craze of movies is everywhere. The various types of media outreaching are largely responsible for the frenzy about this film. People may not think the same way about the questions that a hundred years old film history made people think about, but the people’s interest in the story of the movie is equally applicable today. Along with the change in social life, people’s mindset has changed. Fifty years ago, movies were made like social situations – judging unjust ideas. Therefore, in every chapter of Indian cinema of that era, there is a reflection of social life, injustice to women, yet slowly declaring women’s freedom, orthodox Hindu social system, poor – rural simple life, yet stylist urban culture. These are the currents of Indian civilization. Film director Mr. Satyajit Roy’s “Pather Panchali” is a wonderful surprise in the history of the Indian cinema. The movie was released in 1950, the black-and-white film focuses on the real life situation of a remote village in the post-independence era. The early images of the film are based on the patterns of some such social situations. Although the history of the evolution of cinema is somewhat socio-centric, the motion-nature of ancient cinema is very different from the civilization and culture of modern cinema. But what is the movie audience today? Rather than discussing these, what is the role of film in Indian civilization? this thing becomes more interesting to pick up these as a curriculum or to have new fun with the story of the movie.\n\nThe modernity of the current civilization and culture is the main guide of the new innovative power of the cinema genre. In today’s era, large shopping malls, advanced urban culture, development of education and culture, rural development, women’s freedom, earning money through jobs, elite cinema halls, schools, colleges, universities, etc. have changed the mentality of people. Now audiences choose the path of education even if they want to act. The bearer and carrier of these things are the wide spread of large advertising agencies and media. But the basis of all this is the ideological result of a hundred years old cinema.\n\n​ To be Continued\n\nP. Mukherjee.\n\n​"
