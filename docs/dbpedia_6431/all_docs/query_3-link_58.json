        "text": "A silent film refers to a video recording without any synchronized audible audio and sound to accentuate the motion pictures. As such, it is a unique approach to production that can leverage non verbal cues, dialogue lines, written directives of the plot, and title cards among other non verbal approaches to convey the plot of the film rather than the conventional use of sound. The era of the silent films, often referred to as the Silent Years of Cinema is the period between 1910 and 1927 when a large number of film productions were largely silent (Cook, 2016). While some underpinning reasons for the production of silent films was deliberate to accentuate the message, part of the reason for their production at the time of their popularity is also attributed to the technical challenges involved in incorporating synchronized dialogue prior to the mainstreaming of the audio amplifier tube. There has been extensive debate among cultural commentators as to the overall impact of the silent film era on culture, especially art and literature. Some argue that it has a notable indispensable impact that has remained an integral aspect of contemporary culture while others claim that this was merely an evolutionary era characterized by technical imperfections and subsequently overcome by technical advancements and therefore, holds no notable bearing on culture in a substantive way.\n\nNotably, the silent film era played a crucial impact on art in the sense that it contributed immensely to the growth and maturation of the art of motion pictures. A great deal of artistic innovation in motion pictures was developed in the peak of the silent movie era in the period between 1910 and the 1920s. The fact that the films had no sound synchronization implied that extensive and creative effort was put in to enhance and project the message of the film to the audience through alternative ways. The result was an explosion of artistic creativity and inventiveness than at any other time of the history of motion pictures. It is therefore understandable that the overriding impact of the silent film era had to play in the artistic impressions and expressions used in film since then. These include the use of non-verbal cues, facial and other forms of expression and the use of title cards and dialogue lines. These are aspects of film making that have transformed to the present day use of narrators, subtitles and translations in film production, all of which have their origins in the silent era.\n\nUnknown to many is another impact of the silent era on culture in the form of pioneering the contemporary cultural predispositions in the film industry. This is particularly true upon realization that it was during the silent film era that the various film movements began. These include German expressionism, French impressionism, the soviet montage and even the classical Hollywood movement (Woolf, 2000). All these are approaches to film making that lend their credence and rise to dominance during the silent era and some have had tremendous impact and influence on contemporary art and literature. In this respect, it is perfectly logical to conclude that the silent film era had far reaching impact on culture to the extent that nearly every single film genre in the twentieth and twenty first centuries have their artistic grounding and founding in this special era of film making.\n\nContrary to popular opinion that silent films only showed proficiency in terms of artistic creativity, there was also a great deal of technical and methodological pioneering during this era that has impacted the art of film making to date. The first in this respect was the three point lighting that has become the standard technique for use in the production of visual media where crucial lighting is of the subject of shot is done from three different angles and sources. This empowers the shooting shots in terms of manipulating contrast and shadows for optimal shot quality. The technical shooting strategies in the form of the close up shot, the long short and the panning technique also have their origin in the silent film era and have been integral to contemporary film production since then. In addition, the technique of continuity editing was also founded at this time where multiple different but related shots are intermixed to direct the attention of the audience to the continuity and progression of the film across time and location. The primacy of the silent era of film does not only impact culture in the form of art but also in literature. Since there was no sound to accompany motion pictures, most of the films in the silent era were primarily dramatization of popular books and novels whose flow and contexts were already known. As such, the silent film era was the primary era in which the idea of dramatization of literary art became mainstream and remains to date.\n\nAccording to some sentiment however, the silent era had very limited impact on culture in general. The reason for this argument is that this era was constrained by technical difficulties to incorporate sound into motion pictures. The infatuation with motion pictures is largely due to their uniqueness of having no soundtracks and nothing more. Indeed, as soon as better techniques of production came along, the silent era unceremoniously came to an end around 1929 with people opting for better production with sound. This can be assumed to mean that the silent era was merely a period of progressive transition which was characterized with limited production know how and technology and as such, does not hold much significance, just like the black and white visuals were replaced with colored visuals. This argument makes sense in terms of the fact that the silent era could merely have been the inception of film making and had no notable bearing on the eventuality of the film making industry (Berg & Wilson, 2016). Upon evaluation of both sides of the divide with respect to the significance of the silent era on culture, it is much easier to note the far reaching impact of this special age of video production in pioneering the film culture as known today. However, while recognizing the argument that this era was merely transitional, the impact of this era on culture is so fundamental that it cannot be ignored.\n\nReferences\n\nWoolf, V. (2000).
