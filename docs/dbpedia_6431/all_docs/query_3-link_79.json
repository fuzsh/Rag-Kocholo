        "text": "Timely, topical, and provocative:\n\nMaking Noise About Silent Film: Conversations About Cinema, Culture, and Social Change\n\nThe latest program series hosted by the Finger Lakes Film Trail, explores the impact of silent cinema on society and culture in the early twentieth century.\n\nThrough four key presentations, the series examines the power of cinema in defining mass culture, the impact of its emerging technologies in American industry and life, and its interrogation of social roles through depictions of the “New Woman” and the expanding opportunities in post-World War One society. Making Noise About Silent Film will entertain as well as educate. Moreover, by encouraging viewers to ponder their own values, it will promote an understanding of the ways that media have shaped and influenced Americans’ personal, political, and social attitudes. The ideas that the series generates will initiate further valuable discussion and stimulate “community conversations” about the significance of cinema as an agent of social and cultural change.\n\nLecture #1\n\nPresented Wednesday, February 23, 2022, 4:30 pm\n\nVia Zoom Hosted by The Rossell Hope Robbins Library at the University of Rochester\n\nAn examination of racial and racist stereotyping in mainstream silent films and the anti-typing of African-Americans in “race” films, primarily by race filmmakers (such as Oscar Micheaux, George and Noble Johnson, and Richard E. Norman), who strove to reverse those unfortunate stereotypes.\n\nPresenter: Barbara Tepa Lupack, film historian and former Academic Dean, SUNY\n\nRead Lupack’s “Representation of African Americans in Silent Film” Essay\n\nLecture #2\n\nPresented Wednesday, April 27, 2022, 7:00 pm\n\nIn person at The Carriage House Theater, Case Research Lab and Cayuga Museum, 203 Genesee Street (behind the Cayuga Museum), Auburn, NY 13021\n\nAlthough music was a natural accompaniment to silent films, few early movie studios thought talking pictures had a chance. Discover how two rags-to-riches moguls—William Fox of Fox Film Corporation working with Auburn physicist Ted Case, and Sam Warner of Warner Brothers Studio collaborating with Western Electric—brought the world a new way to experience motion pictures, one that profoundly transformed popular culture.\n\nPresenter: Jim Loperfido, film historian who has worked in the industry for over forty years.\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Case Research Laboratory and the Cayuga Museum of History and Art.\n\nWatch Loperfido’s “From Silents to Talking Pictures” Presentation\n\nLecture #3\n\nPresented Wednesday, May 4, 2022, 7:00 pm\n\nIn person at Tompkins Center for History and Culture, CAP Gallery, 110 N. Tioga Street, Ithaca, NY 14850\n\nA look at the way the \"New Woman\" in silent serial films used fashion to redefine her identity and transform the status of women in domestic, work, and social spaces.\n\nPresenter: Dr. Denise N. Green, Associate Professor and Director, Cornell Fashion and Textile Collection, College of Human Ecology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Wharton Studio Museum.\n\nRead Green’s “Fearless & Peerless: Fashions in Serial Queen Melodramas”\n\nLecture #4\n\nPresented Saturday, May 21, 2022, 1:00 pm\n\nIn person at the Dryden Theater, George Eastman Museum, 900 East Avenue, Rochester, NY 14607\n\nA look at the evolution of cinema from the crude nickelodeon to the movie “palaces” and the ways that the cinema boom changed the stratification of American society. As movies became the first mass market entertainment for Americans, they not only embraced lower and immigrant-class audiences but also courted women viewers, a development that helped to change perceptions of women and reshape their participation in family, business, and political life.\n\nPresenter: Ken Fox, Head of Library and Archives, George Eastman Museum\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the George Eastman Museum.\n\nRead Fox’s “From the Nickelodeon to the Movie Palace: The Phenomenon of Early Movie Exhibition.”\n\nDr. Barbara Tepa Lupack is former professor of English at St. John’s University and Wayne State College, academic dean at SUNY, and Fulbright Professor of American Literature in Poland and in France.
