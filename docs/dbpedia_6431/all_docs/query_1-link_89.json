        "text": "“Action!” “Cut!”\n\nThey’re the two most common words you might expect to hear on a film set. One gets the cameras rolling; the other stops them. The question then becomes what to do with all the footage.\n\nThe art of editing, of assembling various camera angles of various scenes for dramatic effect, has long been a crucial component of cinema, from D.W. Griffith’s crosscutting in “Birth of a Nation” to Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho” shower scene to Paul Greengrass’s white-knuckle “Bourne” action sequences.\n\nAt the same time, though, a counternarrative of cinematic tortoises has nestled alongside these itchy-splicing-finger hares. More and more directors are using long takes — scenes unspooling in real time, free of edits — as a sobering reminder of temporality, a virtuosic calling card, a self-issued challenge or all of the above. The trend may have reached its commercial apotheosis with the 2015 Academy Award winner, “Birdman,” which told the story of an action hero’s attempted Broadway comeback seemingly in real time. (Peak TV has also gotten involved, in a particularly daring 2017 “Mr. Robot” episode as well as extended action sequences in “True Detective” and “Daredevil.”)\n\nNow the director Sam Mendes has created a one-shot wonder with “1917,” set in the no-man’s land of the World War I trenches. His efforts — which, like many of the films discussed here, do cheat with more than one cut — are part of a tradition that goes back at least 70 years. Here is a timeline of pivotal films (and a few noteworthy scenes) that are all “Action!” and no “Cut!”\n\n1948\n\n‘Rope’\n\nAlfred Hitchcock filmed the psychological thriller “Rope” in a series of 10-minute takes, hiding most of the necessary cuts (film cameras at the time couldn’t shoot any longer) by panning past a character’s back or a piece of furniture. The film’s star, James Stewart, was less than impressed: “The really important thing being rehearsed here is the camera, not the actors!” he muttered during filming. Soon Max Ophüls (“Le Plaisir”) and Vincente Minnelli (“The Band Wagon”) would try similarly adventurous experiments, though never for an entire film.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
