        "text": "A silent movie is a movie made without sound. Silent movies were made from the late 1880s to the early 1930s. They used early cameras that could not record sound. Either the movie was being made before sound cameras were invented, or the movie makers could not afford the expensive new equipment.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was known as one of the best movie stars during \"The Silent Era\", as it's called today in movie history. Some silent stars also did well in sound movies. Popular silent movies include Nosferatu: A Symphony of Terror, A Trip to the Moon, The General, and Metropolis.\n\nImages for kids\n\nA still from the 1921 Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, one of the highest-grossing silent films\n\nCharlie Chaplin, widely acclaimed as one of the most iconic actors of the silent era, c. 1919\n\nThe Horse in Motion, animated from a plate by Eadweard Muybridge, made with an array of cameras set up along a racetrack\n\nRoundhay Garden Scene, which has a running time of just over two seconds, was filmed in 1888.

His unique ability to transform into the most physically grotesque characters earned him the universal name, “Man of a Thousand Faces”.\n\nCinématographe Lumière at the Institut Lumière, France.
