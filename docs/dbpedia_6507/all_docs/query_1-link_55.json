        "text": "Memories of Kalash Valley: It was not a long time ago when I was floating in dreamy and magical clouds and cool breeze of northern areas of Pakistan. I have visited so many areas. Some are stuck in my mind like a puzzle. The beauty of northern areas has no match, Kalash Valley is one of them. Some memories are long lasting especially the mornings and evenings spend in northern areas. It felt like chilling breeze was permeating in the bones.\n\n“My wish is to stay always like this, living quietly in a corner of nature.” – Claude Monet.\n\nLife in Kalash Valley:\n\nKalash or kalasha people have the most unique and extraordinary culture in the world. At least 5,000 Kalash people live across three small valleys in the Hindukush Mountains. it is situated near the city of Chitral In KPK province of Pakistan.\n\nCultural Values:\n\nTheir cultural beauty and customs are amazing. As these people are considered as descendent from Alexander the great and living in these valleys from thousands of year.\n\nkalash culture:\n\nThis society is totally different from the culture of Pakistan. Their one person’s roof is the corridor of another person. It felt like we are climbing on a tree house while visiting the staircases of this culture. Wooden window frames, front stairs made of massive stones and villages surrounded by glorious green mountains. For us, this is unusual as houses were closely connected as well as their hearts. They have something that our modern cities lack.\n\nFew lone adventurers like me travel to these valleys every year. Where very low places for accommodation are available like private houses or some shops and some rustic hotels in Bumburet. So settle in what is available there.\n\n“Preservation of one’s own culture does not require contempt or disrespect for other cultures.” – Cesar Chavez.\n\nLocation of the Kalash Valley:\n\nKalash Valley is one of its kind and one of the most beautiful valleys in Pakistan. It is located in District Chitral, province of KPK. Also Its culture is very unique and dated back thousands of years. The kalasha people living here are from Dardic Family of Indo-Iranian branch. Kalash language is called Kalasha. This whole valley is surrounded by Hindukush mountain range.\n\nThis valley is known for its prestigious cultural values and pleasant beauty of its atmosphere. Kalash valley weather is so pleasant that’s why thousands of people from all around the world visit this valley.\n\nCustoms of Kalash Valley:\n\nThese people have very distinct customs from other communities of Pakistan. So they are one of the hundreds of minorities in Pakistan. The Kalash people and Kalash culture have a strict code of customs and religious quirks. They are the mythical tribe described in Kipling’s “The Man Who Would Be King”.\n\nKalash people wish to restrict marriages outside these valleys because Kalash people’s religion is different. Cost is very high for fulfilling this requirement of culture. Because they have a low population rate so that’s why they have a little choice. So either they have to marry out or invites outsiders, Muslims to marry in.\n\nHouse customs:\n\nKalash men look after the goats in higher pastures and Kalash women take care of domestic chores in the lower valley. They divide their family homes into three zones. So if you visit it is suggested to you that you stay in common areas like kitchen, garden or in your room. The air of the valley is crisp and in summer tinged with the perfume of summer flowers and wild herbs.\n\nFestivals:\n\nIn most of the festivals, the sound of drums could be heard in the whole valley.
