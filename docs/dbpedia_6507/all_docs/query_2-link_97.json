        "text": "The Research & Innovation team at BITS Pilani is excited to share a new publication by Nitish Kumar Gupta, Jaspreet Singh , Subhendu Sarkar published in Nanotechnology (Institute of Physics)üéâ ùêìùê¢ùê≠le: A hybrid effective medium description for nanoporous gold films and thickness-mediated control of optical absorption Nanoporous gold films have emerged as an ideal substrate for rapid, quantitative detection of analytes with excellent specificity and high sensitivity. Our study investigates thickness-mediated compositional changes and their impact on scattering characteristics of thin nanoporous gold films fabricated through de-alloying process. Specifically, we observe thickness-induced morphological and structural changes across different fabricated samples from 25 to 100 nm in thickness. This results in substantial change in their optical scattering characteristics, which have been captured experimentally and explained by devising a hybrid theoretical model comprising Maxwell-Garnett & Bruggeman effective medium theories. ùêÉùêéùêà: https://lnkd.in/gEMKU-da Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani | Department of Mechanical Engineering BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus| BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus| Research & Innovation, BITS Pilani | Nitish Kumar Gupta | Sanket Goel | Surender Mohan | Vishwajeet Parihar | Arpita Sharma| Praloy Mondal | Apurva Vunnava | Dr. Radhika Vangala| Devi R Krishnan\n\nMy Journey into Electric Vehicle Design with Advanced Certification Hello, I‚Äôm Mebanshan Lyngdoh, native to Shillong, Meghalaya, and an Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate from Bharath University(BIHER), Chennai. As an automotive enthusiast eager to transition into the rapidly growing field of EVs, I did an Advance certification program in Electric Vehicle Design from iHUB DivyaSampark @ IIT Roorkee from Intellipaat The curriculum covered a wide spectrum of EV technologies, from foundational concepts to advanced topics. I was particularly impressed by the depth of coverage on battery management systems and charging infrastructure, which are crucial in the EV domain. The hands-on projects provided practical experience and deepened my understanding. One of the most engaging projects was \"Range Simulation,\" where I developed a simulation system to predict and analyze the range of an electric vehicle under various conditions. This involved creating a detailed model that considered battery capacity, vehicle weight, aerodynamics, terrain, and driving patterns. The project aimed to offer precise estimations of the EV's range, which is essential for optimizing battery performance and overall vehicle efficiency. Another significant project was the Battery Management System Design. This project focused on developing a sophisticated system to monitor and manage the performance, safety, and longevity of EV batteries. I designed algorithms for tracking individual cell voltages, controlling temperature, calculating state of charge, and ensuring balanced charging and discharging. The BMS is vital for enhancing battery life and preventing issues like overcharging and overheating. The practical experience gained through these projects, combined with theoretical insights from the course, has equipped me with the skills needed to excel in the EV industry. I now feel confident in my ability to tackle complex challenges and contribute to innovative solutions in the field of electric vehicles. I am enthusiastic about applying my skills in the EV sector and am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. The training and support provided throughout the program by Intellipaat has been helpful in preparing me for this dynamic and evolving industry. I look forward to leveraging this expertise to make a meaningful impact in the world of electric vehicles. #ElectricVehicles #EVDesign #Engineering #Automotive #SustainableTransport #Innovation #ElectricVehicle #EVIndustry #Intellipaat #IITRoorkee\n\nThe Transformative Power of Sensors and Semiconductor Device Fabrication: A New Opportunity at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in collaboration with TalentSprint.

It would have been great if they had called in industry professionals rather than the students itself teaching. While I would say the workshop did give an idea about PCBs and its design , I wouldn't say it was at the level expected nor did it give an in-depth understanding. üçÉ Green Oasis: Amidst the PCB intricacies, the vast green lush campus of IIT Madras served as an inspiring backdrop. Nature's beauty blending seamlessly with tech exploration. üåøüè∞ üöÄ Tech Fest Thrills: Despite the hiccups, Shaastra delivered an unforgettable tech fest experience.Everything from robo-wars to VR games, It was great. Eagerly awaiting the next few days of learning and fun! üåüüîó #Shaastra2024 #IITM #PCBDesignJourney #TechFestThrills #LearningAdventure\n\nInternational Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST) 2023 will host a tutorial session on 17th December 2023 which would include lecture series from prominent academicians from around the globe.
