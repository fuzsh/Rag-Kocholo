        "text": "The Qashqai people are the second-largest Turkish community in Iran. They are strong people who have fought against assimilation despite efforts made to incorporate them into established Iranian society. They do follow Muslim wedding traditions but have their own identity when it comes to dances and traditional clothing. They are continuously setting up camp, due to their constant migrations. They travel together with their animals from the Persian Gulf in the winter to the cooler northern mountains in the summer. The Qashqa’i confederacy began in the eighteenth century as an amalgamation of diverse tribal groups. Individuals of Turkic Central Asian and Caucasian origins – the first Qashqa’i khans – served as de facto state officials, mediating between the tribespeople and the state. This has been the primary function of Qashqa’i leaders into the twentieth century. During the 1960s and 1970s the Qashqa’i settled in villages, continued an impoverished nomadic existence, or undertook urban wage labor. Most Qashqa’i settled or planned to settle, aware that only land ownership and agriculture offered some security. They had difficulty finding affordable productive land, and increasingly the settlers depended on the wages of family members who worked in the city.\n\nMoving with their flocks from the shores of the Persian Gulf in winter to the cooler mountains around Esfahan in summer, the Qashqai people are a nomadic group from Iran of Turkic origin who, mostly, still lead a traditional life, not very different from the way their ancestors used to. Today, it’s believed that, still, around one million of the people living in Iran are full-time nomads, representing a 1.25% of the total population. This means that Iran has one of the biggest nomadic populations of any country, together with Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan or Mongolia. Moreover, Iran is so culturally and ethnically diverse that even its nomadic population is classified into different groups and tribes, the Qashqai people being, perhaps, the largest one. The Qashqai nomads, also known as Ghashghaei, are a nomadic tribe originally from Turkey, who keep moving across the Zagros Mountains, a mountain range located in western Iran, which kind of draws the border with Iraq. The Ghashghaei tribe’s main language is a Turkish dialect but, except for some of the oldest people, all of them can speak Persian fluently, which is the official language in the country.\n\nQashqai; a great tribe as their carpets\n\nThe Qashqaʾi form a historically important tribal confederacy that originated in the late eighteenth century. Until the 1960s, the majority of Qashqaʾi were nomadic pastoralists. In the 1990s, many Qashqaʾi continue to rely on nomadism (increasingly by motorized vehicles) for a livelihood. Many have settled in villages, some for part of the year, and agriculture plays an increasingly important economic role. Qashqaʾi territory is ecologically rich and diverse. Low-altitude winter pastures near the Persian Gulf and high-altitude summer pastures to the north and northeast are separated by hundreds of miles, and the migrations of spring and autumn each last from two to three months. The people follow Shiʿism and numbered approximately 600,000 in 1990. The Qashqaʾi have a strong sense of ethnic and national-minority identity, especially because of periodic repression of them by Iranian state rulers.\n\nLike most present-day tribal confederacies in Persia, the Il-e Qašqāʾi is a conglomeration of clans of different ethnic origins, Lori, Kurdish, Arab and Turkic. But most of the Qašqāʾi are of Turkic origin, and almost all of them speak a Western Ghuz Turkic dialect which they call Turki. The Qašqāʾi, in general, believe that their ancestors came to Persia from Turkestan in the vanguard of the armies of Hulāgu Khan or Timur Leng. However, it seems more probable that they arrived during the great tribal migrations of the 11th century. In all likelihood, they spent some time in Northwestern Persia before making their way to Fars. Until recently, there was a clan by the name of Moḡānlu among them, a name which is undoubtedly derived from that of the Moḡān steppe, north of Ardabil, in Persian Azerbaijan. The clan names of Āq Qoyunlu, Qarā Qoyunlu, Beygdeli and Musellu also suggest a past connection with Northwestern Persia. Moreover, the Qašqāʾi often refer to Ardabil as their former home.A close relationship appears to have existed at one time between the Qašqāʾi and the Ḵalaj, one branch of whom made its way to Azerbaijan and Anatolia, and another branch of whom settled down in the area known as Ḵalajestān in Central Persia, probably in Seljuqid times. Indeed, several authors, including Ḥasan Fasāʾi, have gone so far as to argue that the Qašqāʾi are but an offshoot of the Ḵalaj tribe.\n\nThe Farsimadan and Sish Boluki tribes of the Qashqai Tribal Confederacy have established and registered their Fund for the Sustainable Livelihood Council CBO with official authorities. The Qashqai Tribal Confederacy consists of 6 tribes. Members of the Faresimand and Six Boluki CBO’s have negotiated for the formation of a Tribe Council and, after setting multiple consultative meetings with the Council of the Elders and the White Beards of the six tribes of the Qashqai Tribal Confederacy, the Tribe’s Articles of Association has been developed and its board members elected. Currently efforts required to register this tribe are on the agenda of its board members.\n\nThe social structure of the Qashqai Tribal Confederacy is shown in the classification below:\n\nQashqai is a dialect of Azeri. Then I postulated that Northern and Southern Azeri, Turkmen, Qashqai, Salghur and a few others were all in a group that I have proposed that for now I call Oguz/Seljuq. This is an outgrowth of my theory of Weaving as non-verbal language. So when I applied the theory to Qashqai Kilims something became apparent that I never noticed when I was was focusing on Qashqai rugs. The Qashqai are closely akin to the Shahsavan. Furthermore the Qashqai must be from Azerbaijan and must have drawn members from many of the same Ethno-linguistic groups that the Shahsavan drew upon when they were formed. In the sixteenth century the predecessors of the Qashqai were in what is now the Azerbaijan/Iranian Azerbaijan area. They were related to the predecessors of the Shahsavan. In the Caucasus at that time Iran and Turkey were striving to dominate the region. Some of the tribes sided with Turkey or at least used Turkey to maintain their independence from the Persians. The Kazaks for instance were a group of Oguz/Seljuq tribes that left the authority of the horde. It is a hard concept to describe in English but they went Kazak meaning they went independent. Add to this mix religion. The Azeri were Shia and the Shahsavan were Sunni who sided with the Safavid monarchs who of course were Shia. Lost in this mix were the kinsmen of the Shahsavan who were Shia.\n\nThe Qashqa’i are tribally organized, Turkic-speaking, nomadic pastoralists and agriculturists who live in southwestern Iran. They possess a strong sense of ethnic identity and are one of Iran’s many national minorities. They are Shia Muslims, unlike most of Iran’s other minorities, who are either Sunni Muslims, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, or Baha’is. The Qashqa’i are located in the Zagros Mountains, in the province of Fārs. Their territory extends from the Persian Gulf-coast littoral in the east to the Shīrāz-Eşfahān highway in the west, and from the Persian Gulf-coast littoral in the south to the Bakhtiyari border south of the city of Eşfahān in the north. Shīrāz, the major urban center of southwestern Iran, is located in the middle of Qashqa’i territory. Qashqa’i nomads migrate between their low-elevation winter pastures near the Gulf and their high-elevation summer pastures to the north or northeast—a distance as great as 560 kilometers—and en route they pass by Shīrāz and through settled agricultural zones. Their winter pastures are hot and dry in late spring, summer, and early autumn, and their summer pastures have a deep snow cover all winter, both features necessitating seasonal occupation and migration.\n\nQashqai (pronounced [qaʃqaːʔiː]; also spelled Qeshqayı, Ghashghai, Ghashghay, Gashgai, Gashgay, Kashkai, Qashqay, Qashqa’i and Qashqai: قشقایی) are a conglomeration of clans of Turkic ethnic origins, mostly nomadic Iranian Azerbaijanis from Qashqay, Iran. They mainly live in the Iranian provinces of Fars, Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Bushehr and southern Isfahan, especially around the city of Shiraz and Firuzabad in Fars. After assimilation politics since Pahlavi, almost all of them are bilingual, speaking the Qashqai language – which is a member of the Turkic family of languages and which they call Turki – as well as (in formal use) the Persian language. Majority of Qashqai people were originally nomadic pastoralists and some remain so today. The traditional nomadic Qashqai travelled with their flocks each year from the summer highland pastures north of Shiraz roughly 480 km or 300 miles south to the winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the Persian Gulf, to the southwest of Shiraz. The majority, however, have now become partially or wholly sedentary. The trend towards settlement has been increasing markedly since the 1960s. The Qashqai are made up of a number of tribes and sub-tribes including the Amele, Derre-Shuri/Dere-Shorlu, Kashkyoli, ShishBaluki/Shishbeyli, Farsimadan/Eymur, Qaracha, Rahimli and Safi -Khanli.\n\nThe migration of the tribes in Iran is as old as the history. Iranians were the first group of the people who migrated and came to the plateau of Iran two thousand years B.C. These Iranian groups were the founder of Maad and Achaemenian dynasties. Part groups who founded Partian dynasty were emigrants and from Iranian groups too. Ebn-e-Khaldoon, the Islamic sociologist of the 8th century Hegira, classifies the society into two groups of citizens and Bedouins. He believes that migrants have been before citizenships that is a kind of adaptation with the environment. He believes the migration of human socials is older than citizenship. Tribe means the families consist of the people who are organized and are independent under the control of the Khaqan. Qashqai great tribe who are living in a vast area in Fars province, some parts of Boushehr, Kohkilouyeh-o-Boyerahmad, Chaharmahal-o-Bakhtiari and Isfahan provinces are hospitable and warm people that some are still immigrants and some others have become citizens. Qashqai tribe consists of five clans of Kashkouli, Darreh-Shouri, Shesh-Bloki, Farsi-Madan and Amleh. They are mostly Muslim and Shiite and they talk in Azari. Qashqai tent is the “Siah Chaador” (Black tent), which is woven with the goat’s wool. The man Qashqai clothing style is a long dress up to the knees. They use a shawl or a cartridge ring as the belt. Dogoosh hat is the special clothing of Qashqai men. They use Giveh as their shoes which are woven with hand. The Qashqai ladies clothes consist of Borak or Kolaqcheh (Small hat), Lachak (scarf), Albaqi (Head band), Koynak (dress), Koljeh (coat) and Tonban (Skirt). “Koynak” the Qashqai ladies dress covers the legs below the knees and has two slits up the both sides and the sleeves are up to the wrists. Tonban is a long and full pleated skirt which covers the feet completely. All the Qashqai ladies clothes are floral and colorful.\n\nThe Qashqai tribe consists of a combination of tribes with the roots of Turks, Kurds, Lurs, and Arabs, but most of them are Turks. The main center for the life of the Qashqai tribes is Fars province. Almost all of them speak a Western Oghuz Turkic dialect that they call Turki. But due to the size of the land and territory, they also reside in other regions. The most people of this tribe are mainly Shiite Muslims. The name Qashqai derived from the Turkish word for Qashqa meaning White forehead horse. The first famous Qashqai clan manager was Amir Ghazi Shahilo, whose life dates back to the sixteenth century. Today, his mausoleum in the village of Darwish is in the environs of Gandoman. It seems that he was a respectable man because people are still going to visit the tomb. However, it was only at the beginning of the eighteenth century that the Qashqais play a significant role in Fars history. At that time, the Qashqai leader was responsible for the name of John Mohammed Agha, who is most often known as Johnny Agha. They say that the children of this person played an important role in victory India by Nader Shah. Indeed, these children cause the king to be angry, and eventually one of them killed and the other blinded, and the Qashqai people are forced to move to the Ghazh valley, Kolat Naderi and Sarakhs in Khorasan.\n\nThere are different theories about the origins of Qashqai’s, none of which are certain, but the most probable one is that they migrated from different regions from the north and north west such as Turkmenistan, Caucasus, and Asia minor. This can be backed by the fact that many of the Qashqai’s today have light skin, blond hair, and green/blue eyes. There are also some similarities between their dialects and those of the Shahsavans of the East Azerbaijan. There are also some similarities between the motives of their kilims and needle works. Qahqahi’s have mixed with other Turkish and non-Turkish speaking groups such as Kurds and Lurs. There are also some elements of Turkmen, Caucasian, and Turkish rug weaving traditions and motives in Qashqai rugs and kilims. Qashqai tribe is consisted of six clans, such as Shesh Boluki, Large Kashkuli, Darreh Shoori, Amaleh, Farsi Madan, and small Kashkuli. Many of our weavers at www.rugidea.com are from the Kashkuli clan who are very knowledgeable and artist. Some groups of Qashqai’s were forced to move to Khorasan region in the north east of Iran neighboring with Afghanistan. This was based on a decree issued by Nader Shah (ruled 1736-1747). During these twenty years or so, the Qashqai’s were affected by the weaving tradition of the region in which they resided. Herati or mahi (fish) design found its way to Qashqai weaving and this was a side effect of this migration. Some other groups of Qashqai’s went to Kerman at a later date and they also took some of the designs and motives from Kerman rug weaving traditions with them to Fars region.\n\nNumbering just 400,000, the Qashqai are a strong and proud people who are fiercely resisting assimilation into mainstream Iranian society. Iran’s nomadic Qashqai, part of the Turkic peoples from Central Asia who settled in Iran during the 11th and 12th Centuries, have roamed the harsh deserts of southwest Iran for hundreds of years. Each year, they travel with their flocks of goats and sheep from summer highland pastures north of Shiraz to winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the Persian Gulf, roughly 480km to the south. Their way of life is a fine balance between man, animal and their environment. But this traditional way of life is fast disappearing. Numbering just 400,000, many attempts have been made to try to incorporate this minority group into mainstream Iranian society. But the Qashqai have always resisted, remaining a strong, proud and independent people. (Credit: Pascal Mannaerts)\n\nImages"
