Kalash people have a very unique culture, funeral rituals, clothing style, and language and believe in an ancient form of Hinduism. For this reason, Kalash Valleys are a great source of attraction for Pakistani as well as International tourists. There are three main Kalash valleys; Bumburet, Rumbur & Acholgah, and Biriu (Birir).\n\nKalash people are considered the smallest religious and ethnic minority of Pakistan as they follow a different religion and their culture is linked to their religious rituals.
