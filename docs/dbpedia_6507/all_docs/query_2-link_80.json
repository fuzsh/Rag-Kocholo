Don't miss this thought-provoking episode as we unravel the realities and experiences of the Kalash people.\n\n00:00 Highlights\n\n00:40 Intro\n\n01:55 The origins and history of Kalash and its people\n\n07:53 The genetic past of the Kalash people\n\n12:55 Festivals of Kalash Valley and their concepts\n\n17:12 Cultural background and realities of Kallash valley\n\n23:53 Gul on the current tourism situation of Kalash Valley\n\n29:55 Terrible treatment of Kallash people by tourists\n\n31:17 Gul narrates the terrible experiences of individuals attempting to convert her religion\n\n38:02 Causes of the decline in the Kalash population\n\n39:54 Gender roles in Kalash’s religion/culture\n\n44:01 Education system of Kalash Valley\n\n45:51 Gul’s experience in Hazara University Chitral\n\n47:14 Gul outlines preventative measures to preserve Kalashi culture\n\n49:16 Disappearing cultures of different states of Pakistan\n\n51:25 Outro\n\n@ghazi52 @Fatman17 @RescueRanger @LeGenD @Goenitz @Waz @Musings\n\nSome pendu of ours was sayin that these guys are left over army of Alexander the barbarian. So they did a genetic test on these tribals and turns out they are just another local tribe of us pendu……\n\nOur pseudoscientific liberals just make up shit as they go along and live in a make belief world of their own creation.\n\nThe Kalash are considered here as a tribe we should be supporting and protecting(as Greece),because of them being partly descendants of Alexander's soldiers and the Greco-Bactrian kingdoms.\n\nThere have been various \"expeditions\" by Greek professors,scientists and others to Kalash villages. The funny thing is that,after some time,the Slavs of FYROM found some other tribe,in Pakistan I think,and went there to start relations with them as \"Macedonians\"...lol\n\nThe Kalash are considered here as a tribe we should be supporting and protecting(as Greece),because of them being partly descendants of Alexander's soldiers and the Greco-Bactrian kingdoms.\n\nThere have been various \"expeditions\" by Greek professors,scientists and others to Kalash villages.

Pashto wahabbi was blabbering hes semitic lost Israeli tribal, so we tested him and he turned out to be central asian tribal small part mongol mostly Indian......lol.\n\nMany others got tested for various claims, and they all turned out to be local pendu.\n\nAll claims debunked bro.\n\nAaaaaaahahahahahaaaaa\n\nMany guys after getting humbled, disappeared due to the collapse of the narrative. Their worlds collapsed.\n\nWe tested their genes and no link to neither Greece nor Macedonia.

Their worlds collapsed.\n\nI've no doubt they are largely \"localized\" by now. It's like..2,100 years? How long since the Greco-Bactrian kingdoms collapsed?\n\nBy the way,it's not \"Macedonia\",those wankers are Slavs. Just call them FYROM.\n\nDid you watch the interview? If yes please explain any other reason why you think is my statement is wrong.\n\nI didn't, but did the interview say most Pakistani are literally wanting what you say? Like it's a nation wide effort\n\nI didn't, but did the interview say most Pakistani are literally wanting what you say? Like it's a nation wide effort\n\nI don’t think she has guts to say like that if want to live in Pakistan but it is is very obvious from her answers.\n\nSee following video and understand contribution of people who pretty much have been to erased from Pakistan history."
