The geological b a c k g r o u n d : The alignments of Iran's principal topographic features, represented by the Kuhha-yi Alburz and the Zagros Chain, are west to east and north-west to south-east, respectively. In broad context, the Alburz is a continuation of the European Alpine structures, while the Zagros chain has been linked through Cyprus with the Dinaric Alps (Fisher, 1956). The structure of the mountain rim of the country has been influenced strongly by tectonic movements which have not only caused considerable folding, giving rise to the mountain ridges, but have also resulted in overthrusting of the anticlines and complex step-faulting, particularly in the east and north-east. Lying between the two mountain systems of the north and south is the block of the central Iranian plateau, though even here large areas have been affected by the powerful movements which created the Alpine Himalayan erogenic systems. Structural characteristics have an appreciable influence on the extreme regionalism of Iran. The Caspian basin may be regarded as a down-faulted area in sharp contrast to the adjacent main Alburz range, itself discerned as a main northern range, a southern range or Anti-Alburz (Riviere, 1934) with an internal tertiary basin between the two. The Zagros exhibits two structurally characteristic regions including the area of large-scale over-thrusting, as exemplified in the zone between cAli Gudarz and Shahr-i Kurd, and the area of lower altitude, where elongated anticlines and synclines are arranged in sub-parallel lines as for example around Do Gunbadan The main period of earth movements has been established for the Alburz and the north-east region as belonging to the pre-Cretaceous era, when the permocarboniferous beds were widely affected. Further movement began in post-Eocene times and continued through to the end of the Miocene, while the close of the Cretaceous saw increased volcanic activity. The major period of folding is attributed to the Pliocene, especially the late Pliocene (Gansser, I 955)> The Zagros was influenced considerably by epeirogenic movements dated to Paleozoic and early Mesozoic times with orogenic disturbances beginning in the Upper Cretaceous (Lees and Richardson, 1940). Prolonged folding in the late Miocene and Pliocene saw the emergence of elongated anticlines and synclines compressed against the resistant Arabian Shield. 2. Location and f r o n t i e r s : Covering some 164 million hectares, Iran stretches from Bazargan (39° 2o'N-44°2o' E) in the north-west to Sarakhs (36° 30' Encyclopaedia of Islam, IV\n\nN-6i° 10' E) in the north-east and from Abadan (30° 20' N-48° 15' E) in the south-west to Gvatar (25° 05' N-6i° 30' E) in the extreme south-east. The land frontiers of Iran total approximately 4,400 kilometres much of which is aligned along natural features and the subject of established international agreements with the notable exception of the Shatt al-cArab boundary with c lrak. The 460kilometre border with Turkey runs south from the Rud-i Aras through the eastern foothills of the Biiyiik Agri Dagi and thence roughly along the watershed between the Reza'iyeh basin and the Van Golii basin. Of the goo-kilornetre frontier with c lrak, the northern section follows the watershed of the Zagros and then the low-lying foothills of Mesopotamia before cutting across on arbitrary alignments to the Shatt al-cArab upstream of the confluence with the Rud-i Karun. Iran's border with the U.S.S.R. in Adharbaydian is coincident with the Rud-i Aras over much of its length except for the eastern extremity, where from approximately 48° E it swings southwards through the Dasht-i Moghan to the foothills of the Kuh-i Talish, \\vhich it follows to the Rud-i Astara which forms the boundary to the Caspian Sea (Darya-yi Mazandaran). The Trans-Caspian border with the U.S.S.R. follows the line of the Rud-i Atrak upstream from the Caspian Sea to the confluence with the Rud-i Sumbar and then crosses the Kopet Dagh to arc round to the Hari Rud along the north facing slopes of the northern Alburz ridges including the Golul Dagh and the Kuh-i Hazar Masdjed. Although the Irano-Afghan border runs south along the Hari Rud over the first section of its 800 kilometres length, the rest of the boundary is more arbitrarily aligned, traversing the inland drainage sumps east of the Kayin-Birdjand highlands and the western rim of the Dasht-i Na Umid before cutting east through the Daryaceh Sistan to include much of the lowland around the Daryaceh Hamun-i Sabari before swinging south-west towards Zahidan. After following the watershed of the hill range east of Zahidan, the frontier with Pakistan is coincident with the Tahlab Rud south to the Hamun-i Mashgel. Thereafter the frontier trends more or less due south with an abutment eastwards to take in the valley of the Rud-i Mashgel as far as Kuhak, from whence it swings south-west, in parts along tributaries of the Nehang Rud, to the coast of the Gulf of Oman at the Khalidj-i Gvatar. 3. Physical g e o g r a p h y : The heartland of Iran is regarded by geographers as a plateau defined in the north by the Alburz system and to the south-west and south by the Zagros Mountains, though continuing eastwards into Afghanistan without firm i\n\n2\n\nIRAN\n\ndelineation. This vast triangular plateau is far from homogeneous and includes not only the extensive desert lands of the Dasht-i Kavir and Lut but also large, though discontinuous, areas of well watered and fertile soils lying between the enclosing mountains and the desert basins which are the centres of the introspective drainage systems. Whereas the great deserts contain few, if famous, settlements, many of the country's richest agricultural areas are located in the lands bordering the plateau, including among others the Dasht-i Kazvin, Dasht-i Varamin, the extended oases of Mashhad, Sabzavar, Nishabur, Simnan, Tehran, Kumm, Yazd and Kirman and the rich valleys of Arafc and Hamadan. The two principal mountain systems add further regional diversity. The Alburz Mountains dominate the topography of northern Iran even in their eastern extensions where many subsidiary ranges give rise to local micro-climates and permit specialised agricultural activities. No less important, the Zagros chain imposes its own regional influences throughout its length from Kurdistan to Balu£istan, with altitudes sufficient in the west and for a considerable distance south-east to give rise to reliable orographic rainfall capable of supporting forest cover and, in places, a rich agriculture. Outside the plateau and its surrounding rim lie limited but economically significant lowlands including the Caspian Plain, the Turkoman Sahiia, the inland sumps of the Hari Rud and Rud-i Hirmand and the great plain of Khuzistan. In view of the very considerable regional diversity of the country, detailed review of the main geographic areas is necessary. 3.1. The P l a t e a u : (a) The Central deserts: The central deserts of Iran fall naturally into two groupings separated by the mountain range running from the south-east of the highland belt of Khurasan from Dastgerdan to Ardestan, the northern section known as Dasht-i Kavir and the southern as Dasht-i Lut. Both areas are themselves slit into a series of sub-basins, separated by hill ridges, many rising to over 1,500 metres. Dasht-i Kavir is often presented as a series of ten basins (British Admiralty, 1944), the largest known as Kavir-i Buzurg, in which the main characteristics are clayey, salty soils and extremely brackish groundwater in parts giving rise to ooze flows (Fischer, 1968), namakzar and temporary salt lakes (Mostofi, 1970). Most settlements are located on higher ground about 1,000 metres in altitude and represent for the most part staging posts on the ancient caravan routes linking northern Khurasan and even the Caspian area via Simnan and Djandak (MacGregor, 1871) with Yazd and Isfahan. Agricultural life is primarily based on oasis cultivation in which the date palm, other fruits and grains and fodders play a major role. The supply of dyes for the carpet industry, formerly of some importance, is now in decline. Mining for lead and other non-ferrous metals retains an albeit smallscale industrial base in the Anarak-Na'in area. Dasht-i Lut forms an elongated basin set between the Kirman and the Kayin-Birdjand highlands and contains many complex geographical features, some only recently studied (Mostofi, 1970). The so-called high northern Lut .lies between the Dastgerdan-Yazd axis and the Dehuk-Nayband-Ravar col and is sometimes taken to include the highlands around Anarak. The southern Lut or Lut-i Zangi Ahmad is defined in the south by the line of the Bam-Zahidan road and traditionally and economically excludes Narmashir,\n\nthe Kirman Desert and Rigan, though physically this zone, extending up to the Kuh-i Taftan, is included within the Lut proper. Among the characteristic features of Dasht-i Lut is the extensive namakzar-i Shahdad occupying a long trough extending on a serpentine i7o-kilometre alignment from north-west to south-east, though formerly of greater extent (Gabriel, 1938). In the shallow centre of the Lut adjacent to the namakzar complex fluvial and later aeolian erosion has produced areas of spectacularly dissected country having much the appearance of ruined towns called Shahr-i Lut. In addition to a series of hill, valley and plain areas, of which six separate units have been recognised (Mostofi, 1970), the other dominating feature of the Lut is the dune mass of the east running from Dih Salm on a NNESSW axis almost to Kahurak on the Bam-Zahidan road and in parts exceeding 80 kilometres in width. Production from the region of Dasht-i Lut is small and poor communications discourage active export of most goods. Agricultural output from the oases tends to be subsistence orientated, though oranges from Shahdad and dates from Shahdad and Dih Salm do find their way to markets in Kirman and Birdjand. Mining has more than local importance with lead at Nayband, Kuh-i Garmab and Seh Cangi and copper at Kalca Zari and Kolleha (Bariand et al., 1965). (b) The plains of the Zagros Slopes: A series of fertile plains and basins surround the central deserts lying along the north-eastern edge of the Zagros Mountains. The most extensive areas are those surrounding Isfahan, Yazd and Kirman, though many other smaller centres exist with prosperous agricultural bases. Throughout the zone the principal means of water supply is the kanat [g.v.]f with river water retaining local importance especially in the Isfahan region. Drainage within the basins is largely internal and a number of salt-lake basins altitudinally and physically accordant with the Dasht-i Kavir (Fischer, 1968) stretch from Sirdjan via Gavkhuni to Isfahan. Outside the namakzar soils are generally deep and fertile, supporting a varied agriculture mainly irrigated but with a significant area of dryland grains and a rich associated livestock economy. Traditional craft industries are still important employers of labour in this region, with the hand-made carpets of Isfahan, Na'in, Kashan and Kirman accounting for a major portion of Iran's non-oil exports. One of the factors permitting the early growth of sophisticated urban centres in this area of Iran has been the existence of readily accessible and varied mineral deposits, particularly the lead-zinc occurrences associated with the Jurassic and Cretaceous limestones around Isfahan, Kashan and Yazd and orientated with the line of the Zagros overthrusting (Bariand, 1965). It is an interesting fact that many of the modern mine enterprises in the area represent new workings on ancient sites. Copper mining also has ancient origins in this area, the deposits to the south of Kirman at Kuh-i Bahr Asman and Tal-i Ma c dan near Rafsendjan both having been exploited at an early date. More recently, the Sar Cashma copper deposit has been proved and developed. Although iron deposits were not valued so highly or subject to such early exploitation as copper, iron workings dating from Archemenian times have been recorded in this area. Among the largest known ironfields in Iran is the magnetite iron bearing area around Bafk occurring along the contact lines of the grano-dioritic intrusions with the Upper Cretaceous sediments.\n\nIRAN (c) North-West Iran: North-west Iran including East and West Adharbaydjan, Kurdistan and Hamadan with its geological continuation through the regions of Malayer, Golpayegan, Shahreza and Balucistan is considered at the present time to be an integral part of central Iran. The area was intensely folded and faulted during the Alpine orogeny and intrusive processes, localised metamorphism and widespread volcanism are characteristic throughout the zone. Despite the underlying geological similarities, the north-west remains geographically distinct from the areas further east. Topographically, the area has been likened to a series of irregular tablelands (Fisher, 1968), where altitudes attain between 4,811 metres in the main peak of the Sapalan Dagh, 3,700 metres in Kuh-i Sahand and 3,306 metres in the Kuh-i Boz Ghush. Drainage of the north-west area is intricate in pattern. The Rud-i Aras drains the north-flowing tributaries running from the Kareh Dagh and the Biiyiik Agri Dagi as well as the Khuv and Ardabil basins. Much of the south-west of the area is drained by the tributaries of the Rud-i Zandjancay, which eventually joins the Kizil Uzon and the Saf id Rud system. Other radial drainage lines include those streams west of Mahabad which link in the Ab-i Zab, cross the clraki frontier, and link with the Zab al-Asfal. Introspective drainage in Western Adharbaydjan centres on the Daryaceh-i Reza'iyeh fed by the Zarineh Rud and Simineh Rud from the south and the Adji Cay from the east. Adharbaydjan is among the better watered areas of Iran and average annual rainfall at Tabriz is 285.6 millimetres, though the surrounding highlands receive heavier rainfall, much of it in the form of winter snows. Dryland grain cultivation is possible over large areas and deciduous fruits are universally important together with the vine and almond. Irrigated culture is found throughout the region, with the most productive areas located in the major river valleys around the towns of Ardabil, Khuy, Mahabad, Miyaneh, Reza'iyeh, Tabriz and Zandjan, where soils are rich and deep and where some shelter is available from harsh winds, frosts and prolonged snow cover. Adharbaydjan is extremely mineral rich in two main areas including the Ahar-Gulan-Marand area, where large and medium scale deposits of lead-zinc, copper, gold, arsenic and molybdenite exist and the southern Adharbaydjan region lying in the AngurnaTakab-Maragheh area, where large and medium-scale deposits of lead-zinc, copper, arsenic, gold, bismuth and other minerals have been located. Small-scale iron fields are worked at Afsharabad and Goldjuk, while lead-zinc and copper deposits are found between Zandjan and Firuzabad. The southern rim of the central Iranian plateau land running south-east from southern Adharbaydjan through Kurdistan and Hamadan to Shahreza is geologically similar to Adharbaydjan, as noted above, though here a larger element of Mesozoic and Tertiary metamorphism is apparent, especially in the Hamadan-Daran belt. The rim takes the form of a broken mountain system beginning in the west with the Kuh-i Cehel Casmeh (3,163 metres) and continuing in the Kuh-i Alvand (3,548 metres) and in Ashfaran Kuh (4,176 metres). South-west of Nadjafabad the ridge is less distinct. The areas as far east as Nadjafabad are agriculturally wellendowed with deep soils in the valleys and reliable rainfall (Hamadan 385.2 millimetres annual average). Both banat and river water irrigation supplies are utilised for sedentary agriculture, especially favoured\n\n3\n\ncentres for which are Malayer, Arak, Golpayigan, c Ali Gudarz and Nadjafabad. Livestock is generally important, with a strong transhumant tradition affecting mainly the Kurdistan area. Sizeable mineral deposits occur in the area of Mesozoic and Tertiary metamorphism and lead-zinc is found at Lakan, Husaynabad and Darreh Nokreh south-east of Arak and at Andjireh, Vidjin, Khaneh Sormeh and Shahkuh in the area west and south of Isfahan. (d) Balucistan: The mountains of Balu&stan, formerly regarded as continuations of the main Zagros system, are now recognised as a south-east limb of the central Iranian zone. To the north, the area is clearly defined by the Kuh-i Bazman which, reaching its greatest elevation at 3,489 metres, effectively separates the depression of Dasht-i Lut from the Djaz Moriyan Hamun. The mountains of Kuh-i Bazman are made up of extrusive material with a series of geologically youthful volcanic peaks dominating the range. A north-south syncline running from north of Iranshahr to the region of Nusratabad divides the Kuh-i Bazman from the Kuh-i Taftan, a geologically mixed region, with extrusive igneous and metamorphic rock in the area of Kuh-i Taftan volcanic peak, a complex zone of ophiolite-radiolarite rocks with ultrabasic masses located west of Taftan and a surrounding mass of Cambrian to Paleogene sedimentaries. Topography throughout the region is irregular and mainly above an altitude of 1,000 metres. In addition to the mountain ridges traversing the area, and noted above, two plateaux lie to the north and south of the Kuh-i Taftan centred on Zahidan and Khash, respectively, though the former is not endowed with sufficient soil or water resources to offer a base for a strong sedentary agriculture. The Khash plateau presents a strong contrast, with settled cultivation developed over large areas dependent upon adequate if not abundant subterranean water resources and rich and deep soils, where grains, fodder crops, vegetables and orchard fruits give generally reliable returns (Plan Organisation 1960). Although the Iranian Makran shows geological similarities with western Baluchistan, intense overthrusting along a roughly west-east alignment has given the northern Makran distinctive topography, extremely broken in places and difficult of access and agricultural utilisation. Separating the Djaz Moriyan Hamun from the Makran is the Kuh-i Bashagerd, the main west-east ridge of which rises to over 1,500 metres, where the ophiolite-radiolarite areas form a more resistant mass than the surrounding sedimentaries. Coastal Makran, beginning from Ra3s al-Shir in the west and continuing into Pakistan in the east, forms yet another distinctive zone of relatively regular anticlines and succeeding synclines aligned more or less parallel with the coastline. The area is pre-eminently one of sedimentaries, geologically forming a depression zone of which the larger part lies below the Gulf of Oman, though the regular folding of the anticline structures gives coastal Makran a character much different from other major depressions and internal basins in the country. Rapid and intensive erosion of the ridges near the coast by fast-running north-south streams has dissected the anticlines into small hill groups of low elevation except where the geologic outliers of the Cambrian-Paleogene series are exposed to stand out as resistant blocks occasionally attaining more than 1,000 metres in altitude. Despite the occurrence of monsoon rainfall in coastal districts and the existence of ancient kandt systems, agricultural deve-\n\n4\n\nIRAN\n\nlopment has been inhibited by the unreliability of rainfall, the poor condition of the kanats and, not least of all, by the low levels of technical knowledge of the predominantly Baltic population in both water utilisation and cultivation skills (Spooner, 1968). Lying between the mountain rims of Balucistan is the Diaz Moriyan depression, structurally an internal basin and now filled with recent alluvial deposits brought from the hills by numerous streams seasonally flowing to the centre of the basin where kavir and swamp lands cover a considerable area. Away from the Hamun itself, the plains of Bampur and Djiruft, and particularly the latter, offer scope for settled agriculture, though geographic isolation and preoccupation with livestock herding have been constraints on effective use of available land and water resources. Nonetheless, the Bampur-Iranshahr area produces grains, including rice, fodders and tree crops utilising kandt water supplies and temporary 'bands' or earth dams across the major drainage channels to trap water and silt for cultivation purposes. Djiruft has been developed in the very recent period as a major crop and livestock area under government auspices. Large deposits of chromite have been located in Balucistan and the adjacent areas between Baft and Djiruft, occurring in the area of ultrabasic rocks where magmatic segregation has taken place. The most important deposits are established at Shahriyar and Amir, north-east of Minab, though scattered sites as distant as Abdasht and Khash are known. (e) The East Persian Highlands: The East Persian highland system runs from the Kuh-i Surkh south of Mashhad and links up with the Kuh-i Taftan in northern Baludistan. Kuh-i Surkh is separated from the hill area to the south by the Great Kavir Fault, which arcs across from west to east fading out near c Alamdar. The Kuh-i Surkh attains an altitude of 3,020 metres north-west of Turbat-i Haydari, though much of its continuation east in the Kuh-i Bizak and Kuh-i Khvaf rises to over 2,000 metres. South of these highlands a large depression forms a west to east trough, through the foothills of the highlands between Kashmar and cAlamdar including the Turbat-i Haydari region which act as an intermediate zone, where areas of good soils and fair underground water resources permit cultivation of grains, vegetables and mixed tree crops. In years of above average rainfall, dayim, or dryland, cultivation is important and some villagers augment their irrigated lands by damming small streams. South of the foothills, soils are poor and namakzar formations characterise the basin bottom from Kavir-i Namak to the Afghan borders, where marshes are also found. Drainage from the Kuh-i Bizak, the northern KayinBirdjand highlands and the Dastgerdan flows to the namakzar formations. West-east faulting in the north Kayin-Birdjand highlands separates the Kuh-i Kalat from Kayinat proper by a high col. Gunabad village group and its related yayldk, Kakhk, form a relatively prosperous agricultural area on the foothills and northfacing slopes of the Kuh-i Kalat reliant on kandt water supply. Crustal instability is marked both here and in the areas as far south as Birdjand and many settlements suffer periodic earthquakes of which the last occurred in 1968 affecting Kakhk and Ferdaus particularly. The Kayin-Birdjand Mountains achieve their greatest height in the Kuh-i Ahangeran at 2,877 metres, while the north-west to south-east ridge east of\n\nBirdjand also runs for some 100 kilometres at altitudes above 2,000 metres. Drainage of the highlands is to the namakzar in the north and to the small western basins and the Dasht-i Lut in the west. Southwards the situation is moie complex and the line of the hill ranges and the major streams is strongly affected by faulting trending north-west to south-east in the south-east sector and north to south in the south-west sector, with drainage fed to the Daryaca-i Harnun-i Hirmand in the former and to the Dasht-i Lut in the latter case. Agriculture in the Kayinat and Birdjand is based on frandt, pump and earth dam systems with subterranean aquifers replenished by the irregular, though at times heavy, rainfall and snows on the mountain ridges. Some hill villages are famous for saffron and vegetable dye cultivation on small artficial terraces, and there is a considerable export of these products from the region to other parts of the country. The southern col reaching from the main mountain area around Khusf to Nusratabad is faulted to both west and east and carries little settlement or cultivation with the exception of the lower east-facing slopes around Neh which sustain minor pockets of cultivation where shelter from the i2O-day wind (bdd-i sad-u-bist ruz) is possible. Further west, oasis date palm culture is found on the fringes of Dasht-i Lut. (f) The Sistan Depression: Centring on Zabul is a large depression clearly marked in the east by northsouth faults and running east to the foothills of the Hindu Kush ranges. The principal features of the lowland within Iranian territory are the two permanent lakes of the Hamun-i Hirmand and Daryaca-i Hamun-i Sabari, which seasonally link with the Hamun-i Pusak in Afghanistan to form a single sweet water lake. The lake is fed by the Rud-i Hirmand, having its catchment in Afghanistan, while drainage is to the south via the Shalak Rud to Gud-i Zarra on the Afghanistan-Pakistan frontier. Despite the ample supplies of water available for irrigation, settled agriculture is poorly developed, not least of all as a result of structural problems affecting ownership and tenancy of land in the area (Lambton, 1953 and 1969). Distance from urban markets and poor roads have also inhibited development, though severe constraints on summer cropping are imposed by the bdd-i sad-u-bist ruz, which tends to have a scorching effect on crops. Main products of the area are grains and some vegetables and cotton. 3.ii. The B o r d e r i n g M o u n t a i n R a n g e s : (a) The Alburz: Comprising one of the world's greatest mountain systems, the Kuh-i Alburz has an average height estimated at 3,100 metres, the highest point being the volcanic cone of Kuh-i Damavand overlooking Tehran at an altitude of 5,654 metres. Although strongly related to Central Iran and affected by the faulting and thrusting of the Alpine orogeny, the Alburz Mountains were little involved in the phase of late Jurassic-early Cretaceous folding. Folding intensity decreases appreciably in the northern foothills of the range (Bariand, 1965). The range carries a heavy snow cover through the winter and the northern slopes attract heavy orographic rainfall throughout the year with the seasonal maximum varying with altitude. Abundant water maintains a dense and selfregenerating forest cover on the north slopes of the Alburz above the Caspian Plain, though extremely narrow valleys and absence of broad and wellwatered plains in the intermontane basins has limited agricultural life in the mountain areas to small valley defiles and terraces. Drainage patterns in the Alburz are aligned to the Caspian coast or to the central\n\nIRAN basins, with streams mainly falling in torrents down the deep slopes. A more intricate pattern exists in the case of the Safid Rud, where the north-south stream has captured the Kizil Uzon and the Shahrud which occupy an elevated trough in the central basin of the Alburz. Land communications across the Alburz are difficult and hazardous even at the present time. Except for the Kazvin-Mandiil-Rasht route using the Safid Rud gap, all other routes are subject to temporary closure in winter as a result of snowblockage, flooding and landslips. The Tehran-Amul crossing using the Rud-i Haraz valley is especially notorious in this respect. Although the Alburz tend to be of lower altitude in the east, there is a large element of geological continuity between the main Alburz and the eastern ranges of Kuh-i Hazar Masdjid and Kuh-i Binalud than specialists formerly believed, the basic folded sedimentaries of the Cambrian to Paleogene of the Alburz system giving an underlying unity (Bariand, 1965). As noted, however, intensity of folding declines in the northern foothills and has given rise to a more regular series of hill ranges and intervening troughs with topography rather different, therefore, from the main Alburz. The main lines of drainage run along the central valley lying between the northern ranges, including the Kuh-i Golul, Kuh-i Allah Akbar and Kuh-i Hazar Masdjid and the southern ridges of Kuh-i Ala Dagh and Kuh-i Binalud. From a watershed in the Kucan-Kalateh area, the region is drained westwards by the Rud-i Atrak and its tributaries towards the Turkoman Sahra, while the Kashaf Rud drains to the south-east joining the Hari Rud north of Garmab cAliya. Livestock herding is important in the hill areas of northern Khurasan, while the major areas of settled agriculture occur both in the lower Atrak region and the broad plain around Mashhad and in the extended oases of Nishabur and Sabzavar. The vast but poorly watered and isolated Djuvayn plain supports a number of formerly prosperous but now depressed villages reliant on kandt and spring water supply for agriculture and on livestock herding. The Alburz is poorly endowed with minerals compared to other areas of the country, though exploration is far from complete. In addition to lead-zinc deposits at Dona, Kalar Dasht, Sarbisheh, Rezaabad and Tuyeh, barite is found at Sira, while small deposits of iron ore have been located at Simnan. Oldestablished coal workings are still actively exploited by addit mining in the high Rud-i Haraz valley north of Polur. East of Damghan, the Alburz proper offers no mineral wealth. The sedimentaries of the central Iranian group and the internal Neogene basins between Miyandasht and Nishabur are better endowed, with copper deposits at Daman Djala, Buzurg and Coghondar Sar and turquoise found in the Nishabur district. (b) The Zagros: The Zagros Mountains bound the Iranian plateau on the south, running from the Iranoc lraki border at Kasr-i Shirin to the Tangeh-i Hurmuz. A clear boundary marks the break between the Zagros and the plateau on the continuous north-west to south-east line of the main Zagros thrust zone which runs in a roughly 50-70 kilometre belt. The belt may be regarded as the deep central trough of the Zagros basin of former times and exhibits areas of thinbedded red cherts containing radiolaria (Harrison, 1968) in the west around Kirmanshah and southern Kurdistan and in the east around Niriz. Considerable areas lie above 3,000 metres with Zard Kuh at some 4,540 metres and Kuh-i Kalar at some 4,300 metres.\n\n5\n\nThe main Zagros is distinguished from the zone of overthrusting and its associated imbricate zone (Oberlander, 1965) by a discontinuous major line of overthrusting running from slightly south of Kirmanshah in the north-west to Kuh-i Cashma north of Minab in the south-east and including a 2oo-kilometre wide zone taking in the whole of south-west and south Iran as far east as Ra's al-Shir with the sole exception of the Plain of Khuzistan. In the main Zagros, conformably laid Cambrian to late Tertiary sedimentary rocks have been folded during PlioPleistocene times into extended parallel folds now much eroded and dissected by deep gorges through which the major rivers flow to the Persian Gulf in a complex longitudinal/trans verse pattern. The major rivers, all of them perennial, include the Karkha, Karun, Hendidjan, Helleh, Mond and Mihran systems, though several small streams make a direct but seasonal route to the Persian Gulf. Although few minerals other than hydrocarbons have been found in the main Zagros, oil and gas fields abound, especially in the dome formations of the Asmari and Cretaceous limestones, which have been the basis for the development of the Iranian oil industry since the early twentieth century, first in the northern fields of Masdjid-i Sulayman and Lali and later in the more prolific structures such as Agha Djarl, Ahwaz, Gac Saran and Marun further to the south. Overlying the Asmari limestone in the oilfield zone are the lower Pars beds which contain plastic evaporite deposits acting as a seal for the oil-bearing structures (Harrison, 1968). Despite a relatively heavy and reliable rainfall in the area of the western Zagros (Khurramabad, 504.0 and vShiraz 384.6 milimetres) sedentary agriculture is not well developed except around Shiraz. most of the area falling under tribal group herding systems of land utilisation. Central government control in the area was tenuous until comparatively recent years since access was difficult and tribal control absolute outside the major towns. The main tribal groups occupying this vast area include Kurds, Lurs, Bakhtiyari, Kuhgilu, Boyer Ahmad and Kashkay, all of which are still concerned with transhumant herding, though growing government pressure on the tribes to settle through enforced security, the establishment of agricultural extension services and a road construction programme is having some effect towards increasing the area under sedentary cultivation. Protection of the extensive oak forests on the higher ridges and valleys of the Zagros is helping to conserve timber resources in tribal areas of the zone. The eastern Zagros is an area of poorer rainfall than the west but a prosperous sedentary agriculture is developing in the major river valleys and plains, particularly around Istahbanat, Fasa and Niriz, with grains, including millet, and sugar beet of importance. Livestock, often under a nomadic regime, remain the basis of the economy of the area, exploiting seasonal grasslands of the Garmsir and Sardsir. The long coastline of the Persian Gulf permits of widespread smuggling activity of luxury goods from the trade entrepots of the Gulf for the Iranian market. Fishing, on the other hand, is little developed and is of only local significance. Of the ports of the coast between Bandar Daylam and Bandar cAbbas, none has yet risen to national importance other than the oil terminals of Djazira-i Kharg, Bafcregan and Djazira-i Lavan. The agriculture of the coastal strip is extremely poor, limited to grazing and shifting cultivation with the exception of the oases around Bandar c Abbas and Minab.\n\n6\n\nIRAN\n\nS.iii. The I r a n i a n L o w l a n d s : (a) The Khuzistan Lowlands: The lowlands of Khuzistan have been described by Fisher (1968) as the largest single expanse of true lowland in Iranian territory and the area does present a sharp contrast to the rest of the country where mountains are rarely out of view. Structurally, the plain is regarded as part of the Arabian platform with a deep cover of Paleozoic-Mesozoic-Tertiary sedimentary rocks under more recent layers of alluvial material making up a continuation of the Mesopotamian region to the foothills of the Zagros (N.I.O.C., 1959). A high rate of deposition of alluvium still exists in the headwaters of the Persian Gulf dependent on the silt load brought down by the Tigris-Euphrates and Karun systems. De Morgan's (1905) classical theory on the infilling of the headwaters of the Persian Gulf and the gradual advance of the land surface there has been widely accepted though Lees and Falcon (1952) have offered an alternative hypothesis on the assumption that the lowlands represent a gradual downwarping of the land surface under the weight of accumulated sediments and that the coastline is therefore more or less in stable equilibrium. Topographically, the plain is virtually unbroken with a slow rise in altitude from the coast to the abrupt slopes of the Zagros foothills. Not until Andimeshk is reached, i3O-kilometres north of Ahvaz, do altitudes rise above 150 metres. The area is drained by the Rud-i Karkha in its north-west sector towards the Rud-i Karun, which is not reached before the Karkha peters out in salt and mud flats. The north and north-east is served by the Rud-i Karun and its tributaries, while the east is drained by the Rud-i Djarrahi system. Although much of the water is fed to the Persian Gulf through the Shatt al-cArab, a number of narrow creeks known as khur also distribute the river waters of both systems. The largest of these creeks, the Khur Musa, serves as a sea-way to the ports of Bandar Shahpur and Mah Shahr, the former rising to importance as a major Gulf port and the latter acting as a terminal for oil product exports from the Abadan refinery. Khurramshahr lies at the junction of the Rud-i Karun and Shatt al-cArab (the latter officially referred to as the Arvand Rud in Iran) and is the major commercial goods port for international trade. Abadan lies downstream from Khurramshahr and is the former oil products port for the Abadan refinery. The city retains its position as an oil processing centre but is no longer a port of any significance. Ahvaz, situated on the Rud-i Karun 125 kilometres from Abadan, is the provincial capital and an expanding centre of the oil industry from which most administration and servicing of the field areas is carried on. Until the early 19505, the agricultural state of the Khuzistan lowland was extremely poor, contrasting sharply with the former prosperity of Archaemenid and Sasanian times. Much of the plain was cultivated by tribal groups under shifting agriculture with only minor pockets of sedentary agriculture in the palm groves around Abadan and Khurramshahr and the gardens fed by the waters of the Karun around Ahvaz. Control of the Ab-i Diz following construction of the Muhammad Reza Shah dam above Dezful has permitted rapid growth of newly reclaimed agricultural areas on the plain of which Haft Tappeh sugar cane plantation is an important early example. In addition to the activities associated directly with oil production and export, a number of modern industries utilising natural gas have grown up in Abadan and Bandar Shahpur, while new industries\n\nprocessing heavy and bulky imported raw materials, particularly steel, have developed near Ahvaz. The region is favoured by the existence of excellent rail links which run through the Diz-Sehzar gap in the Zagros to Tehran and northern Iran. (b) The Caspian Lowlands and Turkoman Sahra: The Caspian Lowlands and the Turkoman Sahra reach from the Irano-Soviet frontier at Astara in a belt of radically varying width (from two to three kilometres to 50 kilometres) to the east of Gunbad-i Kabus. The lowlands are seen as the southern edge of the Asiatic foreland (Harrison, 1968) or as areas of young depressions (Bariand, 1965). Much of the Caspian lowland represents the area left by the recession of the Caspian Sea and the characteristic soil cover is nonsaline alluvial soils and, in the Bandar Pahlavi-Lahidjan region, peat and grey soils (Dewan, 1961). In the Gurgan-Gunbad-i Kabus area of the Caspian piedmont, soils are extremely fertile and include deep horizons of podzolic soils. Such fertility combines with heavy rainfall over much of the plains, with the Bandar Pahlavi-Lahidjan area receiving an annual average of no less than 1,800 millimetres, though precipitation amounts decline very steeply southwards and more gradually to the east, Babulsar receiving 819.7 millimetres and Gurgan 649.8 millimetres. Drainage is highly variable in type. Many short streams run down to the Caspian Sea between Astara and Rizvandeh and between Rudsar and Nur. The plain is also traversed by the braided distributaries of the Safid Rud, some water of which is diverted artificially by tunnel to the Fumenat district. Flooding of the Safid Rud delta was a usual occurrence until the construction of the Safid Rud (Shahbanu Farah) dam and its associated re-regulation works and present-day river levels are only fractionally below those of the plain itself, thereby permitting direct off-take of irrigation water for the inundation of rice-paddies which form the major item of land use in this zone. Further east, the rivers tend to be more incised, making irrigation more difficult, though rice remains the dominating crop of the lowlands proper as far east as Galugah. Although rice has become increasingly important in the modern period, often on land reclaimed from the sea, swamps and lower slopes of the Alburz, and tea plantations have taken over the undulating land above the Caspian plain, other crops have considerable national importance, including tobacco, citrus fruits (particularly in the Shahsavar-Calus region), and sunflower seeds. Mulberry trees are present in large numbers and a small-scale silk industry survives as a fractional legacy of the former traditional economic basis of the area. The Gurgan and Gunbad-i Kabus plains produce large quantities of cotton and grains on lands only recently reclaimed to arable use. Forestry activity on the higher slopes of the Alburz, where the Hyrcanian forest survives over a considerable acreage, is economically important, though the timber resource has been abused in the past by random cutting for construction and charcoal burning purposes. A flourishing fishing industry exists in the small Caspian ports and coastal villages and along the rivers of the region. The state-controlled caviar interest has had international significance for many years and is of continuing importance despite rigorous supervision of sturgeon fishing made necessary by fears of over-rapid depletion of the species. Local and Tehran markets are supplied with .fresh-water fish caught in the rivers, particularly the Safid Rud. Although the Caspian\n\nIRAN ports suffered eclipse following the end of World War II as a result of restrictions on trade with the U.S.S.R., the many problems posed by the silting up of the harbours and the recession of the coastline, the expansion of the Irano-Soviet trade since 1965 has led to the reinvigoration of trade and communications sectors in the area. Bandar Pahlavi handles both Irano-Soviet exchanges and an increasing volume of international transit trade. 4. S u m m a r y : Geology, soils and climate combine to give Iran an extremely varied face. Within the broad regions of the Plateau, the Mountain Chains and the Lowlands, very considerable contrasts in land, water and mineral resource endowment are to be found between localities even in close geographical proximity. Differing responses to these underlying variations in natural conditions and isolation of areas from the mainstream of the nation's life caused by strong physical barriers to movement between the regions have accentuated Iran's regional diversity.

MCLACHLAN) ii.—DEMOGRAPHY AND ETHNOGRAPHY The distribution of population in Iran, and the ways in which its peoples make their livings, are to a considerable extent a function of its geography (see above). A horseshoe-shaped arc of varying width containing habitable mountains and other arable and pastoral lands, encloses the nucleus of a desert. Because this arc points northwestward, where it\n\n7\n\nmerges into the highlands of 'Irak and Turkey, the bulk of the Iranian population is concentrated near its borders. Since Achaemenian times this habitation pattern has posed an administrative problem to the successive Iranian governments. Geography has thus also contributed to a diversity of peoples, a problem which the Achaemenians solved by creating the first empire, one in which minorities were allowed local autonomy in dress, religion, speech, and other aspects of culture within a single political framework. This diversity has continued until modern times. To the southwest, Iran touches Arab country, with many Arabs living on contiguous c lraki soil, as well as on Bahrayn Island (which Iran once claimed). To the northwest the crest of the Zagros splits the Kurdish people, and the northwestern corner of Iran, bordering on Turkey and Soviet Adharbaydjan, contains populations speaking Azari Turkish, while other Turks are found on Iranian territory east of the Caspian Sea as well as in the southern Zagros. To the east, Iran's borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan are overlapped by Persian-speaking Cahar Lang Mongols, Balu£is, and a few Brahuis. The population of Iran, most recently (1967-9) estimated at 26,284,000 persons, may be divided as follows (see Table I): 4,783,000 inhabitants of cities of over 50,000, or about 18% of the total; 1,110,000, or about 4%, living in smaller cities; and 18,660,000, or about 71%, living in more tfian 40,000 villages; plus about 1,742,000 \"others\", including tribal nomads and Gypsies. As Table II indicates, one sixth of the population of Iran is still tribally organized, whether nomadic or sedentary. In the tribes designated by (f) on Table II the count was made by families, households, or tents, rather than by individuals. Because most tribal \"families\" are extended households, the number of such units has been multiplied by ten in each case. Although most of these counts were made over twenty years ago, if the number of houses has increased and the number of persons per household has decreased, the tribal populations may not have changed much, especially as some of the tribal people have been lost to the cities.\n\nCities Tehran Tabriz Isfahan Mashhad Abadan Shiraz Hamadan\n\nTABLE I Population by types of settlement\n\nKirmanshah Ahvaz Rasht Arak Ardabil Dizful Kazvin Yazd Kumm\n\n2,317,116 387,803 339,909 312,186 302,189 229,761 114,610\n\n4,003,574\n\nsaid to be over 100,000 in 1964. ca. 330,000\n\nsaid to be between 50,000 and 100,000 in 1964. ca. 450,000 Total urban = ca. 4,783,357 = 18.2% of population\n\nIRAN\n\n8\n\nTowns Towns of 5,000—50,000, ca. 1,109,000 = 4-2% of population Villages*, numbering over 40,000 ca. 18,661,640 = 71.0% of population \"Others\"*\n\nca. 1,740,860 = 6.6% of population\n\nTotal ca. 26,284,000 = 100% * Includes tribal and non-tribal, sedentary and seasonally nomadic. ** Probably includes full nomadic.

Over two million more of the Shah's subjects are Sunnis, particularly the migratory Kurdish tribes of the northwest, the Turkomans, and the Balucis. Ismacilis and Baha'is still persist in Iran, and the Lur tribesmen were, and may secretly still be, c Ali Ilahis. In 1960 there were still some 60,000 Jews in Iran, engaged mostly in the professions and trade, whereas many of the Kurdish Jews of Sanandadj and Sakkiz had already migrated to Israel. Almost equally scattered were over 50,000 Armenians, although some had left Iran for Soviet Armenia. Armenian villages may still be seen in the northwest, and the entire suburb, or half-city of Djulf a- Isfahan is Armenian. Armenians and Georgians, both used to cold weather, occupy throughout the year villages in the summer pastures of the Kashghai. Like the Jews, the Armenians specialize in the professions, in trade, and also in truck-driving. A colony of Nestorian Christians who call themselves Assyrians and speak Syriac are concentrated in and about Reza'iyye. They number over 20,000. Many others have migrated to\n\nthe United States. Both the Armenians and the Assyrians have undergone strong American and British missionary influence. Except for the addition of a certain amount of modern industry, the cities of Iran are essentially commercial. In them handicrafts flourish and imported as well as local products are sold in modern shops and in covered bazaars. During the last thirty or forty years Tehran has replaced Tabriz as the largest city, and has drawn to itself persons from all over the nation, including gardeners from Zabol, Turkoman truckdrivers, an intellectual e\"lite educated mostly abroad, the absentee owners of thousands of villages, and a host of public servants. In summer those who can afford it move to the mountain slopes north of the city or to resorts on the Caspian shore. The usual Iranian village is an assemblage of mudbrick or pise\" dwellings roofed with poplar poles covered with earth. The poles are cut from the closely packed rows of quick-growing poplars that line nearly every canal and stream. In regions lacking such watercourses a row of circular mounds, like hollow molehills, stretches from the hills across the sloping plain to the village. These mounds mark the course of a deep, manmade, underground stream called a kandt [q.v. & see MA5]. Sheltered from evaporation, it is the product of highly skilled labour, Kandt-diggers are specialists from the Gurgan region who go wherever their services are needed. Apart from the aforementioned poplars and fruit trees, the typical landscape is almost bare of vegetation taller than short grass, for the goats and sheep keep it down and every day women and children go out to collect low bushes and twigs for fuel. There is usually one carpenter in the village, but most of the men are engaged in agriculture, while the boys tend the flocks. In the absence of the landlord, whom many of the villagers may never have seen, the community is run by his agent, the katkhudd, who allocates the land, provides most of the tools, and collects the rent. This usually consists of four-fifths of the grain produced by each man, unless he is the lucky owner of an ox used in ploughing, in which case he may receive the share of five men and may not need to work. In tribal territory the village may belong to the tribe as a whole, and in non-tribal territory there were, even twenty years ago, a few \"free\" villages owned by the villagers themselves, and ruled by their own headmen who paid taxes directly to the government. Under the current land reforms instituted by the present Shah, the number of such villages has increased. The principal respites from the dreary, impoverished routine of most villagers' lives come from weddings and other rites of passage, from the celebration of the cdshurd [q.v.], and particularly from Nawruz. Beginning at the vernal equinox, this holiday lasts twelve days. In the balmy spring weather, families move out to the fields to picnic and to disport themselves. Each family collects seven plants and foods whose Persian names begin with S, as does the word for green, the colour of spring. They are apples, malt, sweet biscuits, chives, garlic, vinegar, and hyacinth. These offerings are placed in a prominent place in each house, and thrown out on the thirteenth day. The Persians are fond of athletic competitions such as wrestling and weight-lifting, and in the cities specially clothed men in need of exercise practise with Indian clubs and dumb-bells, in special gymnasia, to the beat of drums and recitations from the Shdh-ndma. Such a gymnasium is called a zurkhdna [q.v.].\n\nIRAN The northern Kurds live in villages ruled by their own chiefs during the winter, but in spring it was their habit, until forbidden by the government, to migrate each spring to high pastures across the c lrakl border, and return before snowfall. They are Sunnis and prefer the type of marriage common among Arabs, in which a young man marries his paternal uncle's daughter. They have three cities, Mahabad, Sanandadj, and Sakkiz, of which the third, until recently, included a considerable Kurdish-speaking Jewish population. Around Kirmanshah the local Kurds have become detribalized tenant farmers and Shici. In the mountains south of the Kurds live the Lurs, who speak an aberrant form of archaic Persian. Although nominally Shi% they were formerly openly C AH Ilahis. Like the Zoroastrians, they revere bread and fire. Being split up into numerous tribes and sections, they migrate to their summer pastures as separate bands without overall command. In 1936 Reza Shah's army conquered them, with much bloodshed and starvation, forcing many of the survivors to settle in villages under landlords. Next to the south are the Bakhtiyaris, who speak a dialect similar to that of the Lurs. They are a powerful confederation under the command of a paramount chief called the Ilkhani. In their annual migrations they move simultaneously over five routes from their winter to their summer pastures, crossing the Shustar River partly by fording and partly on inflated skins. Their winter pasture lies on the lowlands and foothills of the lower course of the Karun river in Khuzistan, their summer pasture in the long alpine valley of the Upper Karun. In both places they have permanent villages, the summer ones occupied by Armenians and Georgians. In between, the Bakhtiyari chiefs own many of the villages through which they pass. Their migrations require much organization, accurate planning, and exact timing, and armed horsemen police the migrants and their flocks on the way. Kinship ties are strong and succession to the chieftainship is by primogeniture. Very little is known about the Kuh Galus, who live south and east of the Bakhtiyaris, except that they are organized into some six tribes, some sections of which speak Turkish, the others Persian. They are under the control of four families which, unlike the ruling elite of the Bakhtiyaris, include (or did so until recently) few if any men with modern education. The same generalizations may be made of the Mamassanis, about whom even less information is to be found in the pertinent literature. Beyond the Mamassanis are the Kashghays, members of a powerful confederation divided into twelve tribes. Their Turkish-speaking ancestors moved out of the Central Asiatic grasslands about 700 years ago, crossing Iran to their present home in the southern Zagros. About half are still nomadic. Every year the latter make the longest biennial migration in Iran, some 350 miles in each direction. They winter between the Fahlian River on the north and the encircling Mand River on the northeast, east, and south; westward it reaches the coast. It is split into two sections by a tongue of Mamassani territory on the Upper Shahpur River. Their summer pastures lie in two ad joining regions. One is in the Niriz basin, the hills flanking the headwaters of the Upper Pulvar River and the great bend of the Upper Kur River. The other is on the western side of the Zagros watershed on the plateau between Abadeh and Shahreza, These summer pastures are verdant but\n\n0\n\ntreeless, ideal country for breeding horses, in which the Kashghay specialize, importing stallions from Arabia. Although they follow several routes on the lower and upper parts of their migration, all must converge at a place called Guymn some twenty miles north of Shiraz, and a vulnerable spot. In Shiraz is their tribal headquarters, a palace occupied by four brothers who rule the tribe, and who can reach Guyum in less than hour by jeep. On the march the Kashghay ride both horses and camels along the valley bottoms, while along the ridges to either side mounted men drive their seven million or so sheep, mostly fat-tailed. Although nominally Shici, the Kashghay rulers govern by the Turkish ^ddat, or customary law, instead of by the shartfa. The four brothers hold their power in common because, in order to survive, the confederation needs tight organization, run like clockwork. The brothers must constantly make the rounds of the followers, listen to complaints, administer ad hoc justice, officiate at ceremonies, and make their presences known and felt. Like that of the Bakhtiyari, their ruling family includes men educated in Europe and America. As might be expected, from time to time their autonomy has been challenged by the central government. The easternmost of the Zagros nomads are the Khamsehs, so-called because they consist of five units, brought together over 100 years ago under the leadership of the Kavam family of merchants in Shiraz. One unit, the Basiri tribe, is Persian-speaking. A second, consisting of the Jebbara and Shaybani and other Arab tribes, all speak Arabic, while the third is made up of the Turkish-speaking Aynalu, Baharlu, and Nafar. The first two are now settled while the third has joined the Basiri. In winter the Khamseh nomads live on the coastal plain east of the Kashghay. They move to and from their summer pastures, also located east of the Kashghay's, via the Persepolis plain and over different routes. On both migrations, but not in winter or summer quarters, the Basiri are accompanied by Gypsies who provide them with services in return for protection. Returning to northwestern Iran, in the country bordering Soviet Adharbaydjan, we are next concerned with the Turkish-speaking Shahsavans, or King's Guards. North of Menab and near Khuy, they occupy about 100 villages with about loo.ooq^mhabitants, and an equal number of seasonal nomads are organized into four main tribes, living farther east. These tribesmen are seasonally nomadic, living during the summer in felt-covered yurt-like portable dwellings, with their roofs reaching a peak rather than being domed. They are first-rate horsemen, and long served the Shahs as guardians of the Russian border. The two northernmost tribes spend their summers on the Savalan Dagh between Ahar and Ardabil, and winter on the Mughan Steppe, a lowland area shared by the Adharbaydjan SSR and Iranian Adharbaydjan. The other two summer in the hills north of Sawa and Hamadan and move in winter to the inner side of the central plateau, on the northern edge of the Dasht-i Kavir, which is snow-free at that season. In the western Alburz mountains live a few other tribes, both Turkish and Kurdish speaking, who dwell in black tents in high pastures during the summer, and winter lower down, but not far enough down to avoid deep snow; in winter some of their sheep freeze and wolves devour them. In the eastern Alburz, east of a line between\n\n10\n\nIRAN\n\nGurgan and Damghan, the crest of the range divides, forming the walls of a valley whose waters flow into both the Atrak River and the canals of Mashhad. Both Kurds and Turks have lived in this valley ever since Shah cAbbas moved them there from the Zagros in about 1031/1622. While the Turks have since become sedentary, the Kurds are still partly pastoral, and live in black tents. A different type of pastoral nomadism is practised by the Yamut Turkomans who live in domed, feltcovered yurts north of Gurgan from the southeastern corner of the Caspian Sea to Gunbad-i Kabus. Beyond the Russian border, more than 600,000 more Turkomans are found in the Turkmen SSR and in Afghanistan. The Turkomans are typical Central Asiatic nomads, who raise horses, cattle, sheep, and hardy one-humped camels. They drive four-wheeled wagons, as well as riding horseback, and many now drive cooperatively-owned trucks.Their women weave the famous rugs known to the trade as Bokharas. On the outskirts of Gurgan city is a refugee camp of about 500 Kirghiz who fled from the Soviet Union in 1935 and 1936. They are mostly employed by the Highway Department in moving earth in their high, two-wheeled carts. Moving to the Persian Gulf, we find Arabs scattered all the way from the 'Iraki border to Pakistan, except for a stretch of shore held by the Kashghay and the Persian port of Bushire, out of which Persian dhows sail as far afield as Aden and the African coast. Most of the Arab population of Iran is tribally organized, whether sedentary or nomadic, and Shici. although one tribe, the Banu Tamim, is Sunni. The two largest tribes are the Al Kathir and the Banu Lam. Most of the semi-settled tribes keep cattle, sheep, and camels, cultivate rice and other cereals, and either own or work in date groves. This mixed economy sets complicated time-tables for some of them. For example, the Muhaysin leave their palm groves on the east bank of the Shatt al-cArab in November to sow their grain fields along the banks of the Karun River, return in February to pollinate their date-palms, arid are off again in May to reap their grain, going back once more to harvest their dates in July and August. Like their brethren west\n\nof the Shatt al-cArab, they are in every sense unacculturated ethnic Arabs, although none are fulltime camel nomads like the bedouin. Farther east along the coast are maritime settlements of Arab seamen who ply their dhows and bums to both sides of the Indian Ocean. Lingeh is their principal port. Nomadic, tentdwelling Arabs also live in small groups scattered along the eastern edge of the Dasht-i-Lut and beyond Mashhad into Soviet territory. Except for the coast, the southeastern corner of Iran is principally occupied by Balucis, whose territory also extends northward between the edge of the desert and the Afghan border to Lake Hamun, fed by the Helmand River. Others live in Afghanistan and Pakistan; in the latter country they are most numerous. Their economic adaptation is to desert country where grass grows in winter. In summer they camp near permanent water; along kandts serving dependent Persian villages and along the banks of the Helmand and Hari Rud. Divided into more than a dozen tribes, the Balucis are Sunnis, but they also revere the graves of pirs, or holy men. Like the Kurds, they speak an Iranian language of their own. They breed horses, asses, mules, camels, and sheep. Considering themselves a warrior caste, the Balucis used to keep the caravan roads open for a fee, to draw rent from villages that they own, and to raid each other for slaves. Scattered among the Balucis are Dravidianspeaking Brahuis, whose home is in Kalat in Pakistan. They live in small groups of families all the way up the eastern side of Iran to Mashhad and Sarakhs. Many of the Brahui men serve in the police and the national gendarmerie. Near Lake Hamun in Sistan live four tribes of nomadic Persians, the Sarbandis, Sharekis, Khimars, and Heratis, totalling about four thousand families. About them we have no detailed information. In the swamps and along the aquatic labyrinth of the mouths of the Helmand is a small population of fishermen and fowlers called Sayyad (\"hunters\"). They catch both fish and ducks in nets, and appear to be the residue of an earlier hunting people. Viewing the demography and ethnography of Iran\n\nLanguages of Iran and Afghanistan From Caravan, the Story of Middle East, by Carleton S. Coon, London 1952.\n\nIRAN as a whole, it would be hard to find another Islamic country of its size as decentralized as Iran is geographically and containing as many different peoples and languages. Yet since Achaemenian times it has remained, with a few interruptions, a nation, the world's oldest empire, and with the help of modern transportation and communication, it seems so destined to remain.

COON) iii.—LANGUAGES- [see suppl.] iv.—PRE-ISLAMIC MYTHOLOGY The chief sources for Iranian mythology are the A vesta and the deeds of kings and heroes collected by the historians and poets of the early centuries of Islam. Their information doubtless came from the \"ancient annals\" of Iran, the Khuddy-ndmak. The longest of these works is the famous Shdh-ndma of Firdawsi (330/941-411/1020 [q.v.]). The evidence of ancient Greek historians, rock inscriptions and some Mazdaean books and literary works, rich in preIslamic materials but often compiled in Islamic times, are also very valuable. Besides the Avesta attributed to Zoroaster, there may be mentioned the Denkart (a vast commentary on the Avesta, completed in the 3rd/gth century), and the great Bundahishn (Book of the Creation). Numerous Mazdaean works written in Pahlavi, the bearers of the ancient tradition, have in large measure only been known for less than two centuries, and the Islamic Iranian world was dependent on traditions recorded in Persian and Arabic by early Muslim writers for its knowledge of a history that was partly only mythology. Ancient Iran continued for a long time to elaborate its mythology from pre-Mazdaean and Mazdaean sources. In the course of centuries chivalrous exploits and an exalted human dignity were grafted on to them. This elaboration in its popular form, written down in Persian, came to an end in the 5th/nth century when the pre-Islamic sources and the oral traditions gave birth to several \"books of kings\" and historical summaries culminating in the Shdh-ndma of Firdawsi. Iranian mythology, rich as it is, has some common features and some undeniable affinities with that of India, but the power and preponderant role of some Indian gods are relegated to a secondary level in Iran. The analogies and differences between the myths\n\nn\n\nof Iran and those of the Indo-European world are particularly worthy of interest and reveal some relationship between their systems of thought. The tripartite idea of society (priests, warriors and cattlebreeders/agriculturalists) which G. Dum6zil remarkably demonstrated in the mythology of India and the Indo-European peoples is at present held in great favour. These three hierarchical functions which are confirmed in the Avesta (Y. xi, 6, xiii, 3; Yt xiii, 88-9, xix, 8, xxiv, 16; Vt iv, 28, 57-8, xiii, 44-6, etc.) and to which the Yasna xix, 17, adds a fourth, that of the artisans, continued with some slight modifications (priests, dabirdn officials, warriors and artisans-peasants) to make up the social order of Iran until the end of the Sasanid period. There is every reason to believe that the tetramerous division of society, whether it was due to the Yasna or to the social reorganization of the Sasanid period, follows this triad of hierarchical functions. Certain memories preserved in the Gathas (the oldest part of the Avesta) and several Yashts of the Avesta betoken a pre-Mazdaean mythology. The two primordial spirits, Spanta mainyu (Holy Spirit) and Ahra mainyu (Spirit of Evil) correspond to the two antithetic aspects of Vayu, at the same time the good and the bad wind which is the breathing-spirit and the motive force of the Universe. The Indian counterpart of Vayu is Vayu who stands at the head of a series of functional divinities. In the same manner, but by a reversal of the Indian position, the Iranians contrasted the nature of the ahura (Indian asura) with that of the daeva (Indian d£va). These latter, whom the Indians considered as good, take on a malignant character in Iran, while the malignant asura make way for the benignant Iranian ahura. The Indian god Indra, who is assigned the function of a warrior, sees his role reversed in Iran where he becomes a demon in the VidSvddt (the part of the Avesta dealing with canonical law and exorcism) x, 9 and xix, 43. The series of the great Mazdaean divinities is made up of Ahura Mazda, the supreme god, and six entities called Amasha Spanta (Holy Immortals) who surround him: i) Vahu Manah (Good Spirit), an entity protecting the conscience of just men and to whom the ox is connected. Her auxiliaries are Mah (the Moon), Geush Urvan (the spirit of the primordial ox) and Ram, a helping divinity which guides the soul after death. 2) Asha (Order-Justice), an entity guaranteeing cosmic and moral order. She is seconded by Atar (the divinity of Fire), Vrlragna (a god who embodies the victorious attack) and Sraosha (a god of Vigilance and Obedience). 3) KhshaOra (Kingdom), the entity presiding over metals and thus over arms and the army. She fills the role of warrior or rather of defender of the poor, and she is helped by the Sun, the Sky and Mithras whom a remarkable rise made a rival of Ahura Mazda and who became the object of a cult in the west, the cult of Mithraism. 4) Armaiti (Moderation), the goddess of fecundity and mercy, to whom the earth is linked. The secondary divinities accompanying her are Ardvisura Anahita (the waters) and in second place Daena (or Den in Pahlavi), Religion. 5) Haurvatat (Integrity) whose associated divinities are Tishtriya (Sirius), Vata (the Wind), and the Fravashi (protective spirits). 6) Amaratat (Immortality), the guardian of plants, around whom are gathered Rashnu, the infernal Judge, and the two divinities who lead dead souls over the bridge of Cinvat: Ash tat and Zam. Finally, considered as seventh, there is again Sraosha who is added to this but who does not strictly belong to the category of the holy Immortals. In addition, a\n\n12\n\nIRAN\n\nmultitude of Yazata and Fravashi, who are considered as divinities with less well defined roles, fill out the Iranian pantheon, and hence the idea arises that the origin of angels might be linked to them and to the holy Immortals. A malignant spirit belonging to the train of Ahra Mainyu is opposed to each divinity in the cortege of Ahura Mazda. If the tripartite division of G. Dum6zil is borne in mind, the entities Vahu Manah and Ash a correspond to the Indian gods Mitra and Varuna and they fulfil, along with Ahura Mazda, the first function— the priesthood and sovereign order. The function of warrior is incumbent upon the Iranian KhshaOra as it is upon the Indian Indra. Finally, the function of production and wealth is shared between Armaiti (goddess of fertility, the Earth) and the Haurvatat and Amaratat who are related to the Indian divinities, the goddess Sarasvati, the twins Nasatyas, and others. The Mazdaean holy Immortals are at the same time abstract representations giving Ahura Mazda his fullness and beings who, although superior to creatures, remain inferior to Ahura Mazda. They are shown both as personal Agents and personified Powers. The antagonism which sets the Spirit of Good and the Spirit of Evil in opposition, the basis for Iranian dualism, is the metaphysic and the morality of this mythology. According to the great Bundahishn (ch. i), the Upper World, spiritual and luminous, has been the domain of Hormazd (Ahura Mazda) since the beginning of creation, while the nether region is the shadowy world of Ahriman (Ahra Mainyu). An intermediate space divides these two worlds, a mixed world in which good and evil do battle. In this continuous conflict the force of Ahriman faces the army of Hormazd and finally the Spirit of Good triumphs over the Spirit of Evil. Each being must take part in this struggle and it is thanks to his meritorious actions, his good thoughts and words, that Man participates in the final victory. Ahura Mazda has gradually taken the place of Spanta Mainyu, his own emanation, so as to confront the Spirits of Evil himself. He has granted Ahra Mainyu a respite of 12,000 years and knows his plans in advance. Alongside this divine mythology, there is a human mythology related to it. In large measure it is presented in the form of historical epics situated (with some exceptions such as the longevity of certain heroes) on the human plane. They tell of a succession of events which are linked together by their own chronology. The first man, Gayomart, directly succeeding the creation of the primordial ox, his source of food, gives birth to an androgynous plant which divides into two, Ma"
