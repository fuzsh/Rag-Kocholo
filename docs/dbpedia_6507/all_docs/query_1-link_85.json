        "text": "SIAH POSH: ‘WEARERS OF THE BLACK ROBE’\n\nDIVERSITY AND COLOUR IN THE HINDU KUSH\n\nWe miss world-shaking events when we are out of this world.\n\nPakistan, October, 1999: the country’s army chief, General Pervez Musharaff, was in a plane circling above Karachi airport during the early stages of a military coup against President Nawaz Sharif. The president had ordered the blocking of the airport runways in a desperate bid to abort the coup.\n\nAt the time, I was in a battered old jeep heading through the remote Hindu Kush in Pakistan’s Northern Areas. My companions and I were crossing the Shandur Pass on our way from Gilgit to Chitral, capital of the largest district in the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (North West Frontier Province). I was at work. My eldest son Tim was with me. He was eighteen. I was researching a chapter for an adventure travel book about India, Pakistan and the Himalya. Back home in Cornwall, a month or so earlier, an old editor of mine had phoned. She asked if I could fit in a ‘little six week jolly’. She said that the publisher had secured various ‘experts’ for the India, Nepal, Tibet and Sri Lanka sections of the book but that no one wanted to go to North Pakistan. She told a stalled editorial meeting that she knew a man who would.\n\nI gave it some thought – but not for long. Tim had time to spare after finishing at Sixth Form College, so I took him with me. It launched him on a trajectory that has made him a proper travel writer rather than a jobbing hack. Was his mother worried when she heard about the Musharraf coup? She was always sanguine about my general working trips through the more familiar thickets of Europe, although occasional bomb scares and other minor panics in the shadow of where I had just been, did trigger occasional missed heartbeats, not least mine. But, this time, our son was with me.\n\nWe were well out of worldly ways, however. The registry at Chitral’s police station showed that only eighty Westerners had been in the district that year. In those days, there were no mobile phones or Internet in the fabulous wilderness of the Northern Territories where the Himalaya, the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush nudge up against each other north of Gilgit. For several days after Musharraff’s loyal troops had secured the Karachi airport and allowed the General’s plane to land, much of Pakistan had been in tense though bloodless turmoil. We knew nothing of this and neither did our local companions until we reached Chitral several days later. Even then, life was as normal as ever in the dusty streets. I phoned home from a tiny food store where the standard Bakelite handset allowed shaky satellite connections around the world. My wife was relieved, although there was mild alarm in her voice.\n\n‘Are you safe?’ she asked.\n\n‘I’m always safe,’ I said.\n\n‘But the military coup? The country’s in crisis.’\n\nI was still nonplussed. So far, no one in Chitral had even mentioned a coup. A group of Chitralis was clustered in rapt attention round a tiny television set that was perched on a shelf above the shop’s counter. I craned my neck expecting military announcements and propaganda on screen. They were watching cricket. This was the Hindu Kush – worlds apart.\n\nTHE ‘KAFIR’ KALASH\n\nMy main purpose in Chitral was to visit the Kalash valleys that lie about 40 kilometres south west of Chitral. The Kalash are the most cohesive of non-muslim ethnic groups within Pakistan. They number just over 4,000 and live within the three valleys of Bumburet, Rumbur and Birir close to the border with Afghani Nuristan a region bristling with war-hardened Taliban, armed to the teeth. The distinctive ethnicity and unique lifestyle of the Kalash is said to derive from a historical relationship with the ancient inhabitants of ‘Kafiristan’, now Nuristan. The name Kafiristan translates as ‘land of the infidels’, the term used by Muslims for the indigenous inhabitants of the area who practiced a form of ancient Hinduism mixed with animism. Abdur Rahman Khan, Emir of Afghanistan, forcibly converted the people of Kafiristan to Islam during the late 19th century. The region was then renamed as Nuristan, meaning ‘land of the enlightened’ as ambivalent a phrase as might be imagined. One theory is that a small remnant of the Kafirs migrated eastwards into the Chitral area during the 1890s where they found refuge in the valleys under the Chitrali ruler Aman ul Mulk whose benevolence extended to tolerance of the Kalash religion and culture.\n\nNone of this can begin to define the history and development of this most complex of the world’s regions. Even Kipling got in on the act with his famous short story The Man Who Would Be King.\n\nMore recently, Nuristan was a ferocious centre of resistance to the 1980s Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and to the later American-led Afghan army efforts to unseat Taliban forces. This latest in a long line of foreign involvements ended with the unresolved Battle of Kamdesh in 2008, after which the Americans withdrew all their forces. A month later the Taliban ruled openly in Nuristan and today the region is still in turmoil. Beyond all of this, the Kalash survive in their valleys notionally protected by the Pakistani government, but in truth protected by the Chitrali authorities, by various humanitarian agencies and by the growing influence of Tourism.\n\nENDURING MYTH\n\nThere is an enduring myth that the Kalash people – and the historic Kafirs of ancient Nuristan – are the descendants of Greek soldiers who remained behind after Alexander the Great’s advance into the Hindu Kush. The often light skin of the Kalash and the random appearance of blonde, blue-eyed Kalash over the years have sustained this belief, along with the understandable flavour of romance that clings to such singular people. However, in 2015, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute of Cambridge carried out DNA sampling from residents of the valleys. They found no evidence of Greek lineage. Rather, the evidence showed that the Kalash are likely to be descendants of some of the earliest migrants into the Indian sub-continent from West Asia and have more in common with Siberian hunter-gatherers than with Alexander the Great.\n\nThe Kalash are subsistence farmers. They use traditional methods and during my visit, I saw bullocks pulling wooden ploughs across the meadows, although mechanical harvesters had been introduced in the valleys. Crops include maize, wheat, barley and beans. Plentiful vines yield wine and some tobacco is grown. The Kalash orchards are full of walnut, mulberry, pear, apple and pomegranate trees.\n\nThe Kalash still celebrate a historic culture of great richness and complexity. Their religion is polytheistic and has a strong basis in ancient Hinduism. They worship a number of Gods before stone altars, or in wooden temples called Han. Beliefs of the Kalash are based firmly in animism and on the powerful duality of the pure, onjeshta and the impure, pragata. Onjeshta is associated with high pasture, goats and shrines. Menstruation and childbearing are considered pragata and females do not go near high pastures or near goat and cattle barns. During menstruation and childbirth, they remain isolated in what are known as Bashali houses located beyond the village boundaries.\n\nThere are complexities in all of this that are, in part, beyond easy understanding, especially for Westerners. There are also aspects of the modern Kalash that are multi-layered and that may draw negative criticism from some quarters. It is also unreasonable to believe that people such as the Kalash necessarily preserve an ancient culture that is unmarked by the passage of time and by external and internal influences and circumstances. They are what they are to the eye of the contemporary beholder.\n\nROMANTIC AURA\n\nThe attraction of the Kalash, for tourists certainly, is the romantic aura that clings to this notionally idyllic lifestyle whose outward appearance is seen in the colourful traditional dress still worn by Kalash women. Kalash men once wore similar decorative wear but today they are indistinguishable in dress from their Muslim brethren. The conventions and proselytising of Islam have impinged heavily on the Kalash, or the ‘Pagan’ as they are often referred to, pejoratively it seems, by many Pakistanis. The main female dress of the long black tunic prevails, however.\n\nThe Kalash are known properly as the Siah Posh, the ‘wearers of the black robe’. The black is simply a neutral background to the beautiful embroidery at neck, shoulders, cuffs and hems. Yet, it is the accessories of the Kalash dress that are truly striking. The everyday tunics are belted with broad cummerbunds in red or purple and are again threaded with embroidery. Most vivid of all are the brilliant headdresses, worn over plaited hair. For everyday use there is the shushutre, a cap-like headband with a long tail, decorated with cowrie shells, buttons and beads in bands of vivid colour. Kalash women also wear numerous bangles, rings and layered necklaces made from orange, red and white beads. Older women and children sometimes stain their faces with a black paste made from crushed goat horn as a protection against wind and cold.\n\nIt is the great seasonal festivals of the Kalash, however, that truly celebrate the exuberance of the Kalash culture. The main festivals are the Spring Joshi, Uchal in August, and Chomos in the dead of winter, all accompanied by dancing and celebration of the seasons and harvests, when Kalash women especially surpass themselves with the brilliance of their dress. To come across such celebration of creativity and colour in a land gripped by a diminution of femininity and style is inspiring.\n\nTO THE KALASH\n\nIn Chitral, the legendary Hindu Kush mountain guide, Babu Mohammad, promised us horses. This was a touch contrived on my part. You could reach the Kalash valleys with bone-shaking ease in crowded jeeps and pick-ups along dirt tracks. However, I needed a narrative and ‘On Horseback to the Kalash Valleys’ hinted at authenticity, however hyped.\n\nBabu never faltered in his determination. He did business in the patient, courteous style you learn quickly to expect in North Pakistan. No fuss, no demur; everything is conducted in a relaxed sociable manner; problems are solved with calm detachment. We drank tea, discussed, pondered, and drank more tea. I lived for many years around horses, but only as a mere bystander and a reluctant halter-holder on rare occasions. Not terrified, but truly terrified. Tim had the keen confidence of youth.\n\n‘Babu,’ I said; ‘I know something about horses, but...’\n\nBabu smiled. Horses were once as motorbikes to Chitralis.\n\n‘These are quiet horses, my friend. Afghan horses. We have western saddles for you. Everything is arranged. All will be good…Inshallah.’\n\nEarly the next morning the horses, ridden at breakneck speed by their hard-faced owners, clattered into the cobbled yard of Chitral’s Mountain Inn. They looked enormous within the narrow yard; baleful-eyed. In truth, they were no more than ponies, razor-backed little beasts, leathery, and as hard-faced as their riders. Our guide was a genial young Afghani, Hamid Allah. He wore an old military jacket over his shalwar kameez and, on his head, a skullcap of golden threads. His horse was laden with our kit. It never faltered on the journey. They gave me the ‘docile’ beast. A horse with no name – I dubbed it ‘Hangover’ because of its habit of drinking copious amounts of water wherever it could.\n\nHalf the neighbourhood turned out to wave us off – with bemusement – and soon we were ambling along old tracks high above the confluence of the green and foam-flecked Chitral and Ayun rivers at the heart of a broad valley full of fields and orchards. Behind us, to the north lay the snow-covered Tirich Mir, the highest peak of the Hindu Kush. To the east, across the valley, the great peaks of the Hindu Raj, grey and ochreous and struck through with veins of marble, soared into the blue sky. Above the track, rose the stony foothills of the Hindu Kush range that runs into Afghanistan, a mere 15 miles to the west. Nothing seemed to flourish in this arid landscape, but we spotted several lizards including a huge lime-coloured specimen with a tail over a metre long.\n\nBALAWOSHT\n\nThat night we stayed with Shazada Khush Ahmed ul Mulk, a member of the Chitrali Royal Family, at his beautiful home at Balawosht.\n\nMy tenuous status as a ‘travel writer’ has opened doors for me across the world. A few weeks earlier, I had even managed to wangle a gratis trip from Islamabad along the Karakoram Highway in a chauffeur-driven limousine, complete with diplomatic flag on its bonnet. The shame of it! The car was heading for Karimabad in the Hunza Valley to collect ‘important’ personages. I had some regret on missing out on the de rigueur battle bus trip along the KKH so beloved by old hippies and penniless mountaineers, and not least by the ‘adventure travellers’ who might read the book I was working on. Yet, the limousine trip seemed even more hairy at times, as our smartly uniformed driver duelled relentlessly on the ‘hanging highway’ with the brightly decorated lorries that hog the almost one-track road above unguarded terrifying drops. ‘Do not worry! All the bad drivers have dropped out!’ is the standard cheerful wind-up as drivers execute offside wheelies past armadillo trucks determined to nudge you off the edge. Razor-backed Afghan ponies are a safer bet, all round.\n\nOur stay with Ahmed ul Mulk was a delight. And a great honour, although the Prince would never think it so; he was a humane and self-effacing man whose sense of humour and worldly wisdom were inspiring. He was in his 80s then. In his time, Khush Ahmed had travelled great distances on foot and by horseback throughout the North West Frontier and Afghanistan. He was a key figure in the humanitarian care and resettlement of the thousands of Afghan refugees who fled their homeland in the wake of the Soviet occupation of the 1980s. (Not much changes, other than directionally it seems). His stories of frequent clandestine cross-border movement by a whole range of agencies and individuals during the Soviet era were fascinating. That evening we strolled through the lush terraced meadows of Ayun amazed by the transformative effect of clever irrigation on once arid alluvial land.\n\nTHE BUMBURET VALLEY\n\nWe left Balawosht with reluctance the next morning, riding along the side of the Ayun Valley, moving in and out of harsh sunlight and cool shade beneath great overhangs of beetling rock. Soon, we passed through a government checkpoint and turned into the Bumburet Valley. Here, the landscape was even more fertile where the track wound between meadows and where we began to catch glimpses of groups of youngsters, some in the sober shalwar kameez dress, but others, young girls, in the distinctive, colourful clothes of the Kalash.\n\nWe stayed for several nights in the Kalash village of Anish. During the following days a young Kalash, Taj Muhammad, who had been raised as a Muslim but who had retained strong links with Kalash relatives, guided us through the complex and striking world of the valleys where we visited Kalash households and spoke at length with friends and relatives of Taj. The Kalash build sturdy timber houses, usually of pine and cedar with layers of pebbles and stone between the wooden planks. The houses are often built in tiers with the roof of the lower dwelling serving as a veranda for the one above.\n\nThe Kalash had good educational facilities and various organisations have established health and social welfare centres. I visited several schools and spoke to students who were all modern in outlook but with a strong awareness and loyalty to their traditions and culture. Several of the girls had visited Greek islands that I knew well, as guests of a Greek Health and Education foundation that was active in the valleys. Taj and I roamed across the higher slopes and followed an irrigation channel to the village of Brun where timber houses clung to a narrow sequence of terraces below steep cliffs. Just above Brun was one of the Kalash sacrificial sites where goats are ritually slaughtered and then roasted on the ceremonial fire. On an isolated spur above the village stood a Bashali House, set apart by its elevated position against a background of sunlit mountain and intense blue sky.\n\nSENSE OF UNEASE\n\nWhen I left the Kalash, I was still struggling with a sense of unease about the nature of my visit -Tourism and the professional encouragement of tourism that guidebook writing promotes. There was one justification, ambivalent enough, but persuasive enough to salve conscience. The Kalash are not anomalous to the Hindu Kush. They belong, irrevocably. What seems to make them an anomaly is the curiosity of outsiders; at its worst, prurience from some Pakistani men who bus north in groups to gawp at unveiled women made more beautiful by their striking looks and striking dress. The perceived ‘liberal’ traditions of the Kalash – the wine-making and sociable alcohol and marijuana use, the ancient ritualistic attitude to sexuality, the long tradition of colourful and exuberant festivals, and, most crucially, the positive status of women, also rankles with some of the most difficult prejudices of modern Islam.\n\nThe pressures on the surviving Kalash to relinquish their traditions and lifestyle have been relentless. The amplified call of the muezzin blares out across the valleys from intrusive mosques. The commercial imperatives of tourism ring-fence the Kalash with a dubious and flimsy protection, but the risk of Disneyfication still hangs in the air. The sanitising of deep culture and costume to the level of a photo shoot is part of this. Yet, if these ‘justifiable means’ serve to save the Kalash from extinction through absorption, then that is perhaps one hopeful device, while the work of NGOs and other agencies, such as the Aga Khan Foundation, underpins the most fruitful protection.\n\nA few days later, we were back in Chitral, in the world of purdah bazaars, of the strictly male shalwar kameez, plain waistcoat and Chitrali cap and the near invisibility of women. There was no chance of catching a brightening glimpse of anything as uplifting as those colourful Kalash headdresses, or of a reassuring sense of creative diversities both ancient and modern.\n\nA week later, driving south to Peshawar, our jeep was stopped at a road block, where scores of vehicles were being detained by armed military. Our Chitrali driver was deeply anxious – the people of Chitral are often viewed with suspicion by Pakistanis further south. The country was still in some tension in the wake of the Musharraff coup. A ferociously mustachioed officer, fierce-eyed and wielding a swagger stick strode towards us. Alongside the jeep, a soldier trained his machine gun on us from the top of a guard tower. Our driver wilted. The officer peered in at me with a threatening glare. Then, his face slowly lit up;\n\n‘You are English!’ he announced with a huge smile.\n\n‘No,’ I said. I could hardly resist the truth.’ I am Scottish…’\n\nHis face erupted with joy.\n\n‘Even better!‘ he bellowed and, after multiple hand-shakings, waved us through on the long road south. Our driver chanted thanksgivings for the next five miles.\n\nA few weeks later, we were in London passing through Heathrow, ourselves part of the bland construct of Western fashion and custom – and not an Afghan pony in sight.\n\nI have no current experience of how the Kalash are fairing in what have become often desperate times in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Their way of life remains under pressure as shown by incidents such as the 2014 Pakistani Taliban’s public threats against the Kalash and against moderate Ismaili Muslims whose spiritual leader, the Aga Khan, set up schools and clinics in the Kalash valleys. The helpful Greek connection with the Taliban (dubious Alexandrine links notwithstanding) saw the kidnapping, in 2009, of a Greek national, Athanassios Lerounis, who lived and worked with the Kalash for several years and had helped build a Kalash museum and medical facilities as part of the wider Greek interest in the people. Lerounis was freed unharmed a few months later, allegedly on payment of a ransom, but possibly due in part to overwhelming protest by the Kalash and because of the influence of Chitrali officials and the Pakistani government.\n\nClimate change has affected the Northern Territories. So too has unregulated logging in the high forests of the Kalash valleys. Catastrophic floods hit the Chitral district in the summer of 2015, the result of unusually heavy rains, glacial melt and deforestation. The death toll in the Kalash valleys was in single figures, but the destruction of infrastructure in the valley bottoms, of roads, homes, schools, shops, orchards and meadows was extensive. Fortunately many of the Kalash houses are built as extended terraces on the higher slopes of the valleys and thus survived, but the Kalash economy suffered greatly and for a while food had to be helicoptered in by the Pakistani Army.\n\nLatest reports state that the valleys are recovering slowly from the flood damage although there is no guarantee against future natural disasters or against potential diminution of the Kalash traditions by outside influences.\n\nThis is an abridged edition of content from the India, Pakistan & The Himalaya edition of the series, Adventure Travellers (AA/Frommer’s, 2001)\n\nThe lead trekking and Travel Company operating in the Chitral area and elsewhere is HINDU KUSH TRAILS, run by Maqsood ul Mulk, son of Shazada Khush Ahmed ul Mulk."
