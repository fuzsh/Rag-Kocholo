        "text": "Lowari Pass is a remarkable mountain pass that connects Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with the mesmerising Chitral Valley in Pakistan. This strategically important route has been a lifeline for the people of Chitral for centuries, facilitating trade, transportation, and cultural exchange.\n\nIn this blog, Graana.com dives into the details of Lowari Pass, including its location, history, geography, route, weather conditions, frequently asked questions, and the best time to visit.\n\nLocation\n\nLowari Pass is situated in the Hindukush Mountain range in North-Western Pakistan. It forms a crucial link between the cities of Peshawar and Chitral. Specifically, it lies in the Upper Dir district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The pass is located at an elevation of 10,230 feet (3,120 metres) above sea level.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of Lowari Pass is as old as the region itself. It has served as a vital trade route for centuries, connecting the Chitral Valley with the rest of Pakistan. In ancient times, this route was used for the exchange of goods, spices, and cultural influences between Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Today, it continues to play a significant role in the economic and social development of the region.\n\nGeography\n\nLowari Pass is characterised by its rugged terrain and challenging topography. The route winds through steep cliffs and dense forests, providing stunning views of the surrounding mountains. The pass is known for its breathtaking beauty and is a popular destination for adventurers and nature enthusiasts.\n\nLength\n\nIn 2009, a perilous portion of the road, which hugged the edge of steep cliffs, was replaced by the construction of the Lowari Tunnel. The tunnel, spanning a length of 8.75 kilometres (5.4 miles), with an additional 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) of access roads, was a monumental engineering feat undertaken by a South Korean company. However, disappointingly, the tunnel project was subsequently abandoned, and over time, it fell into a state of disrepair.\n\nFortunately, in July 2017, there was a significant development when the tunnel was finally reopened to provide a safer alternative to the treacherous sections of the drive. Construction on this tunnel project initially commenced in September 1975.\n\nThe tunnel is designed to accommodate all types of vehicular traffic, boasting a generous width of 24 feet and a height of 16 feet. This all-weather transportation route is particularly crucial because, during the lengthy winter season, the traditional pass route is rendered impassable due to heavy snowfall.\n\nRemarkably, the Lowari Tunnel operates around the clock, even during the harshest winter conditions, with a speed limit of 40 kilometres per hour.\n\nRoute\n\nThe journey through Lowari Pass can be both exhilarating and challenging. The pass is accessible by a winding road that takes travellers through picturesque landscapes. The drive is not for the faint of heart, as the road is narrow and winding with sharp turns. Due to heavy snowfall in the winter, the pass is often closed, making the summer season the ideal time for travel.\n\nWeather\n\nLowari Pass experiences a wide range of weather conditions throughout the year. Summers are relatively mild, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). However, during the winter months, the pass becomes snowbound, and temperatures can drop significantly below freezing. Travelers should plan their visit, accordingly, avoiding the harsh winter weather.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nThe best time to visit Lowari Pass is during the summer months, from May to September when the pass is usually open, and the weather is pleasant.
