        "text": "Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan\n\nThe Kalasha Valleys (Kalasha-mondr: Kaĺaśa Desh; Urdu: وادی کیلاش) are valleys in Chitral District in northern Pakistan. The valleys are surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountain range. The inhabitants of the valley are the Kalash people, who have a unique culture, language and follow a form of the Historical Vedic religion.[1][2] As such, the Kalasha Valleys are a source of attraction for Pakistanis as well as International tourists. There are three main valleys.[3][4][5] The largest and most populous valley is Bumburet (Mumuret), reached by a road from Ayun in the Kunar Valley. Rumbur is a side valley north of Bumburet. The third valley, Biriu (Birir), is a side valley of the Kunar Valley south of Bumburet.\n\nGeography and Natural Environment\n\n[edit]\n\nKalasha Valley is located at an elevation of over 6,500 feet above sea level, and is characterized by steep slopes, narrow gorges, and rocky terrain. The area is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including rare species such as the snow leopard and the Himalayan black bear.\n\nThe Three Valleys\n\n[edit]\n\nThe inhabitants of the valleys are the Kalash people, who have a unique culture, language and follow a form of religion that is associated with their surroundings like the mountains and rivers.[1][2][6][7][8] The largest and most populous valley is Bumburet (Mumuret), reached by a road from Ayun in the Kunar Valley. Rumbur (Rukmu) is a side valley north of Bumburet. The third valley, Biriu (Birir), is a side valley of the Kunar Valley south of Bumburet.\n\nKalash people\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kalash people\n\nThe Kalash people are a small religious and ethnic minority of Pakistan. The Kalash religion is polytheist faith similar to paganism and ancient forms of Hinduism and the people offer sacrifices for their gods. Their culture is interlinked with their religion and includes several unique festivals and celebrations. The people generally do not intermarry or cohabit regions with local Muslims but neither are they hostile towards them. The people are under legal and constitutional protection of the State of Pakistan as a scheduled tribe.[citation needed]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nTypical homes in the Kalasha Valleys\n\nA school in the Kalasha Valleys\n\nA Kalasha woman\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAncient Greeks\n\nAlexander the Great\n\nKaghan Valley\n\nNeelam Valley\n\nNaltar Valley\n\nHunza Valley"
