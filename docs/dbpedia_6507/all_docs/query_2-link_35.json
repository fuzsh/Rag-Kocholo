        "text": "The study was conducted in Bumburet valley of district Chitral, Pakistan. Qualitative anthropological research technique was adopted for acquiring the ethnographic data for the research in hand. This research paper is an attempt to understand ancestral and cultural traditions of the Kalash people. How these traditions are transmitted from one generation to the next? They teach and preach youth the rituals, offering and sacrifice. Adolescents are the ones to whom the traditions, customs and culture are transmitted and it requires maximum understanding and communication between the elders and the youth. They are considered as custodians of culture. The adolescence period is very critical for the children of minority ethnic group. Extensive socialization is required to conform to their traditions. The natural setting and the type of education a child receives plays a predominant role on his future pursuits. The Muslim and Kalash parents encourage both their sons and daughter to seek education. Academic intelligence and practical thinking can develop independently and may grant a specific identity to the individual which may be different to his cultural identity. Kalash identity is based upon unique and nonviolent way of life. The changes which incorporate in Kalash traditions may find their way through peripheral adjustments. The Kalash youth insist on keeping their self-identity as well as participating in modernity. Technological development does not clash with the basic practices and taboos enforced by the religion are generally accepted.\n\nThis research paper is an attempt to understand ancestral and cultural traditions, faith, mystic experiences, oral history and mythology of the Kalash people. There is no written evidence about the history and origin of Kalash. The religious ideology is attained through the verbal recollection of folklore, myths and miracles. Kalash identity is exhibited in the form of their sacred rituals and festivals. Rituals are the means of communication to the Supreme Being; they are very peculiar, and very symbolic. Their identity can be witnessed through the ritual of exclusive public dance which distinguishes them from others occupying the same geographical space. Their tradition is famous and distinguished because of its mystic songs accompanied with an unusual group dancing. The triumphant of drum and chants of clapping all together creates a sensational environment for the visitors. The contemporary Kalash religion and rituals are entirely different from the accounts provided by the historians, travelers and sociologists before the war of independence in 1857. The Kalash are now monotheist believing in one supreme authority “Dezau” and the shamans through whom they have received their religious knowledge. The study was conducted in Bumburet valley of district Chitral, Pakistan. The qualitative anthropological research technique was adopted for acquiring the ethnographic data for the research in hand.\n\nFemale education plays an important role in the societal progress and improvement. The literacy rate among rural females is 29% in Pakistan. In the developing countries like Pakistan, the traditional attitude towards women education is painstaking a keyobstacle in girls' schooling. In this study an effort had been made to explore the effect of traditional attitude on the educational attainment of rural females in Pakistan. The present study was conducted in the rural areas of the district Hafizabad. A sample of size 700 female children was selected using multistage random sampling technique. The final completed school grade was considered as the response variable. The analysis reveals that the girls, who belonged to households where the minds of the heads of the households were entrenched in the local cultural values, had lower levels of educational attainment as compared to the girls of households where the heads of the households were liberal. The study realizes the need to encourage the male heads of the households for schooling of their daughters as a short-run policy. Efforts to neutralize an innovative attitude towards females in the third world nations are the need of the hour. International organizations and States of the developing world should manage to promulgate the importance of female education.\n\nThis research paper focuses on the personal adornment as a source of identity among the Kalash through their clothes and beads which can be used as nonverbal communication to understand the hidden meaning of societal values and historic realities. The kafirs of Kalash often wear black dresses which serve as a space for their traditional identity. The black colour is indicative of certain symbolic message and it is very important to establish a genuine justification for the choice of colour. The black dress is worn by every woman and all are equally respected. The dresses symbolize the political and religious affiliations. The converted Muslim women give up their traditional attire. The conversion to Islam started with the arrival of Arabs in the region. The Kalash youth insists on keeping their self-identity as well as participating in modernity. Kalash can assimilate foreign thought without allowing them to shadow their own traditional thought process. The burden to sustain the traditional identity is on the shoulder of women and her body is utilized as a space of determining cultural identity. The study was conducted in Bumburet valley of district Chitral, Pakistan. Qualitative anthropological research technique was adopted for acquiring the ethnographic data for the research in hand.\n\nThe aim of the study is to assess the psychometric characteristics of the Adolescent Coping Scale (ACS) that involve internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and item-scale correlation for Short Form items. To assess the degree to which each of the items in the Short-Form adequately measured its respective coping strategy, the correlation of the item with the scale of which it was a part was computed. The research subjects consist of 201 adolescents aged between 13 to 19 and were selected using purposive sampling. Research fi nding for ACS specifi c and ACS general long form instrument both have a high internal consistency value which were 0.928 and 0.922. The fi nding shows that ACS instrument in Bahasa Malaysia version is suitable to be used as an objective tool."
