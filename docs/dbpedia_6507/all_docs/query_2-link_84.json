        "text": "Skardu & Hushe Valley Extension\n\nThere is an option of extending your trip from Gilgit on Day 13 as per the following itinerary follows:\n\nDay 13: Gilgit – Skardu: An early start for our long but spectacular drive up the Indus Valley to Skardu, taking lunch along the way. On arrival we will check into the PTDC Hotel and have supper. Hotel (B,L,D)\n\nDay 14: Skardu – Hushe Valley - Khaplu: Today we hop in open top jeeps and follow the Shyok and Hushe Rivers into the heart of the Karakoram. Draining an enormous area of the eastern Karakoram, much of which is now in India, the Shyok and Hushe rivers cut a spectacular trail into this eastern most part of Baltistan. We’ll drive up the Hushe Valley first to Baleygon, where we’ll check on the first Wild Frontiers Foundation school to see how the kids are getting on in our new classrooms. From here, if time (and weather conditions allow) we’ll continue right up the valley to the end of the road where the magnificent 7,000m Mashabrum Mountain stands sentinel. In the late afternoon, as the sun is setting, we’ll return to Khaplu where a real treat as we stay in one of the most wonderful heritage hotels in the whole subcontinent. Recently converted by the Aga Khan Cultural Development Trust, and run as a community project, Khaplu Palace is one of WF’s favourite hotels anywhere Hotel (B,L,D)\n\nDay 15: Khaplu - Skardu: After a lazy morning in and around the hotel, we’ll head back to Skardu, where we’ll visit the old bazaar, take a walk beneath the imposing Karphocho Fort, a spectacular 16th century lair perched on the eastern end of the Skardu rock. Hotel (B,L,D)\n\nDay 16: Skardu – Islamabad: This morning we’ll catch the flight down to Islamabad. Provided the flight is operating we’ll then spend the rest of the day pottering around the capital, visiting other sites in the city. Hotel (B,L,D)\n\nDay 17: Islamabad (Contingency Day) Today we’ll head out to Taxila and spend the day looking around this fascinating Buddhist university town, dating back to the Gandharan era of Alexander the Great, visiting the famous archaeological site. Returning to Islamabad we will have our final dinner in the Margalla Hills. Hotel (B,L,D)\n\nNB – if the flight is cancelled on Day 17 we’ll drive to Chilas on the first day and from here to Islamabad the following day – please be warned it is a monster journey!\n\nDay 18: Islamabad: The extension then finishes after breakfast at the hotel in Islamabad. (B)\n\nVISAS\n\nVisas are necessary for many of the destinations we travel to and while we aim to provide you with the most up-to-date information, requirements frequently change and as such for the latest advice we advise that you check with the relevant embassies or contact a reputable visa agency. More details can be found here - https://www.wildfrontierstravel.com/visa\n\nFor this tour UK passport holders currently require a visa for Pakistan.\n\nPassports should ideally be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the end of your tour.\n\nNon-UK passport holders or non-UK residents should contact the relevant embassies for individual requirements.\n\nVACCINATIONS & ADDITIONAL TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Yellow Fever vaccination certificate is a mandatory requirement for travellers to Pakistan coming from countries at high risk of the disease. Also, if your travels are for 4 weeks or more, you will be required to show proof of a Polio vaccination on exiting the country.\n\nFor all destinations, please make sure you are up-to-date with any standard vaccinations (e.g. MMR, Hepatitis A, Tetanus) as recommended by your local health care provider.\n\nMalaria is present in some parts of Pakistan and precautions are essential.\n\nFor the most up-to-date information on all vaccination requirements and the most suitable anti-malarial tablets, we strongly suggest that you seek advice from your local travel centre or consult an official travel health website such as www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk or www.travelhealthpro.org.uk\n\nCovid Testing: No mandatory testing is currently required for vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers.\n\nIf necessary further details will be sent out to you upon booking, however ensuring that correct and valid visas & vaccinations are obtained remains the sole responsibility of the client.\n\nCLIMATE\n\nThe weather conditions can be extremely varied. In the mountains of the Hindu Kush, where you will be travelling at heights in access of 3,000 metres even in the middle of summer it can turn bitter with the occasional snow flurries falling. Temperatures in the Islamabad and the plains can be considerably higher than the mountains although in the autumn the weather is pleasant with warm days and nights getting cooler the higher you sleep. However, in the autumn months snow can come early so be prepared for some chilly temperatures especially at night!\n\nIS THIS TRIP FOR ME?\n\nIt may sound obvious but Wild Frontiers tours are not always for everyone and it is important to us that the tour you choose is the most suitable. All our tours have a fitness rating as a guideline but you should check the day-by-day itinerary carefully. In certain instances we may ask you to complete a travel questionnaire before confirming your booking in order to ensure your suitability. Should you have any concerns about your ability to partake in any aspect of the tour then please contact the office.\n\nKEY ASPECTS TO CONSIDER\n\nAnyone in a reasonable state of health, with an open mind and a sense of adventure should be perfectly able to cope with this tour, as many of the activities are optional. Please note that some of the walks in the Kalash Valley are quite steep! Please also note that there are some long driving days on this trip, some of which are created by the nature of the roads rather than the distances covered.\n\nPlease note that in Pakistan administrative and security requirements can change overnight. At times the authorities may require additional checks and registration which can affect the itinerary. Visitors to Pakistan must adopt a flexible approach and awareness that the itinerary is fluid and overnight stops can change. Some of the journeys can be long and due to road conditions and as a result of the security accompaniment during the drives.\n\nWhen travelling in jeeps, we open the roof when the weather permits to fully embrace the nature of adventure travel that this mode of transport allows and maximising our opportunity to enjoy the spectacular scenery.\n\nTHE NATURE OF ADVENTURE TRAVEL\n\nWe feel that it’s worth pointing out that while we will always strive to stick as close to the stated itinerary as possible, it may be necessary from time to time to make changes to our itineraries or services (due to weather, political and religious influences etc.) and this can happen with little or no notice. This unpredictability can be one of the most exciting aspects of adventure travel and for many of our clients often leads to unexpected highlights as the tour-leader necessarily adapts the tour to the changing conditions. However we are aware that this lack of assuredness may not suit everyone. As such, with the greatest respect, if you are someone who needs to know that everything will happen exactly as planned, we would kindly suggest that perhaps our tours are not for you. Adventure travel can be infectious and once you’ve caught the bug, it is likely to never leave you, but especially if this is your first such tour we would strongly urge you to give us a call if you have any concerns whatsoever about your suitability for this trip.\n\nTRAVELLING SOLO AND SINGLE SUPPLEMENTS\n\nAs a company approximately 70% of our clients are solo travellers, so it’s very unlikely you’ll be alone!\n\nOur prices are typically based on twin-share accommodation but single supplements are not compulsory for any Wild Frontiers tour. If you prefer not to pay a single supplement we’ll pair you with someone else of the same sex for you to share with throughout the trip.\n\nOn this trip, if you do opt to pay for a single supplement then please note that it will cover you for all nights of the tour except the local guest houses in Ayun and the Kalash Valley, and in Mastuj.\n\nPlease note that paying a single supplement entitles you to lone occupancy of a single room. In many cases these rooms will be of the same size as a double/twin room, but in some cases they may be smaller.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nInsurance that provides cover for emergency repatriation in case of a medical emergency is compulsory for all tours. You should be aware that due to some of the geographical areas visited and some of the activities included on certain of our trips some standard insurance policies may not always provide adequate cover. As such we strongly recommend that you purchase a policy that adequately covers your trip. Please see the Insurance section for more details."
