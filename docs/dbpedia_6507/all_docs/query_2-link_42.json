        "text": "We include breakfast every day. We also include some other meals in remote areas were stated on the itinerary. In our experience people sometimes want to eat different things in different places at different times and when there is an option, we will be happy for you to have your say. We know some great places and will also happily show you some of our favourite restaurants and tea houses. Some are luxurious, some are more earthy, but all have character. However, we do not pretend to be the arbiters of good taste and are equally happy for you to go off and find your own favourites. However, when restaurants are unavailable, such as when we are living in a Kalasha guesthouse, we ensure that food is provided.\n\nWhen we choose our vehicles and drivers we take into consideration the road conditions, the length of journey and the competence of the man behind the wheel. Most of the roads on this trip are paved although the state of the surface can vary. In the Chitral valley the roads are sometimes very bad and we will be in jeeps for this section. Your comfort and enjoyment of the journey is the first priority.\n\nThe far North of Pakistan in Chitral, Gilgit, and Hunza are currently stable areas. However, we monitor the situation closely and we listen very carefully to advice from the foreign office and from our friends in the areas we visit. Our clientâ€™s safety is our primary concern. We must state that the tour leader has the final word with regards to changes in the itinerary for safety reasons. Whilst the route we have chosen passes through areas which we consider to be stable, things can change, and we may have to alter the route or cancel sections of the trip at short notice."
