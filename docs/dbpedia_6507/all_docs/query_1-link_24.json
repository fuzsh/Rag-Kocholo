        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Kalasha are an indigenous marginalized group settled in the northern mountains of eastern Afghanistan and North-West Pakistan. They are a pagan tribe that practice their own tradition and culture (3). Their religious beliefs are polytheistic and animistic. Some of the Kalasha believe that their roots are in Greece and they are the descendants of Alexander the Great and his army. However, the archaeological research through excavation and exploration in Chitral revealed that Kalasha were present in Chitral even before the arrival of Alexander the Great in this region (4, 5). Historically, Kalasha settlements were spread over the Chitral district in Pakistan and Nuristan in Afghanistan, but now they have been shrunken and limited only to three small valleys of Chitral, Pakistan (6–8). The Kalasha belong to an oral tradition, without having any written scripture about their religion and culture (9). The Kalashamon (“Kalasha language”), is one of the many threatened and near extinction languages of the world (10, 11). In the recent years, however, the linguistic community has started making some efforts to save the Kalasha language through documenting the text (12).\n\nThe Kalasha world, or their “fundamental dichotomisation of the natural environment” (13), is divided into two spheres of ónǰeṣṭa (pure) and prágaṭa (impure). The ónǰeṣṭa (pure) spheres include the heights, the mountains, gods, wildlife and goat stables, mountain spirits, fairies and the space between the back wall of the houses and the fire space in the middle (14). The prágaṭa, on the other hand, represents the places at the bottom of the valleys that includes the graveyard and Bashali (a place where women stay during menstruation and during childbirth) (14–17). Ónjeṣṭa also includes animals. For example, goats (as they graze at high altitude in mountains) are pure, while the chickens and the eggs are considered prágaṭa (impure). The neighboring non-Kalasha communities are thus settled in the lower portion of the valleys and come under prágaṭa spheres. The Kalasha community, therefore, settled in an intermediate space between the dichotomy of prágaṭa and ónǰeṣṭa (14, 17).\n\nThe positive connotation in ónǰeṣṭa is not related to a blissful life in the hereafter. Also, although prágaṭa doesn't have a positive connotation, it has nothing to do with sin or the devil (5). Additionally, there is no association of these two poles with sexual morals, cleanliness or devotion, like the rest of the majority of the Pakistan community's view of “pure/impure” (18). Nowadays, the Kalasha have started talking about hell and heaven and often relate this to the myth of Adam and Eve owing to the influence of Islam (5, 19). However, the traditional Kalasha vision, rooted in their religious system, has limited concern for the hereafter or the idea of a prize or a punishment in the life after death (5).\n\nThe Kalasha are an agro-pastoral community (20). Their economy is based on pasture and agriculture historically (21). However, their agriculture is very small scaled and the pastoral economy has been endangered because of the symbolic significance of the pastures in their cultural traditions (20, 21). For example, goats are culturally important, intrinsically sacred, and pure animals amongst the Kalasha because of their association with wild animals of the mountain region (20). Even on festival dances, playing of goats and clashing of their horns during combats is enacted. Goats are slaughtered and their blood is believed to provide protection against evil forces (22, 23). Contrary to the role of cattle and sheep in pastoral subsistence, the obsession of the Kalasha with goats can be seen in multiple ways (13). Goats' symbolism can be seen in entire Kalasha religious culture such as goat carvings on doors; pillars of houses; altars, and images on walls of clan temples (24). The images of goats are also molded in dough or imprinted on bread at important rituals (25).\n\nThe Kalasha are surrounded by a conflict driven Afghanistan where an extreme and hard-line religious narrative has been built since the 1980s and the narrative kept on spreading to the neighboring places including parts of Pakistan (26). The same narrative forced the whole Kalasha community restricted to three valleys, however, once they were settled in the Nuristan district of Afghanistan in the past. The counter-narrative needs to be built very timely in order to preserve the diminishing cultural heritage of Kalasha.\n\nThe Kalasha are a vulnerable and endangered community considering their challenging geographical location, and security threats and their youth are constantly striving to preserve their unique culture (3). Therefore, in order to gain an in-depth understanding of an individual's protective factors, there is a need to understand the cultural conceptualization of resilience and the role of ecological processes in development of an individual (27). There is a need to look deeper into the ecological system owing to the influence of the environment of an individual on his/her development (27, 28). According to Bronfenbrenner's ecological system model, an individual is surrounded by layer of contexts under influence of multidirectional factors (e.g., family, environment, and context) (1). The predominant focus is on the multidirectional interplay of environment, context, and ecological system of an individual (29). According to Bronfenbrenner, there are five interlinked levels in the ecological environment of a person: microsystem (i.e., family and school etc.); mesosystem (interaction between two systems); exosystem (system that has an indirect influence on a person, e.g., parent's workplace); macrosystem (community level norms, beliefs and culture); and chronosystem (the chronological component) (2). Furthermore, Putnam (30) highlighted the concept of social capital which includes community networks, sense of belonging, civic engagement, and trust in community are among the important factors contributing to social capital.\n\nMost of the research studies on mental health and resilience have been conducted in high-resourced developed countries (27, 31, 32). Furthermore, very limited research is conducted in low-resourced countries to understand the responses of minority groups regarding mental health issues (31). More indigenous resources, interventions, and methods can be developed if researchers explore the cultural, contextual, bioecological protective factors and contextually and culturally sensitive intervention models (31). Therefore, the current study was conducted with the objective of understanding the educated young Kalasha's mental health conceptualization, treatment preference and their indigenized cultural protective factors against mental health issues.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe aim of the current study was to understand young Kalasha's lived experience and sense making of mental health and psychological resilience. The aim was also to explore young Kalasha's cultural protective factors against mental health issues and to make sense of Kalasha's world and their perceived causes of mental health problems and their help seeking behavior/ preferred treatment options. The themes discussed in the results section shed light on Kalasha's perspectives.\n\nThe relationships within any society or group of people are defined by social capital. The most widely used definition of social capital in health sciences is given by Putnam (30). According to Putnam, there are five main aspects of the social capital: (1) community networks, voluntary, state, personal networks, and density; (2) civic engagement, participation, and use of civic networks; (3) local civic identity—sense of belonging, solidarity, and equality with other members; (4) reciprocity and norms of cooperation, a sense of obligation to help others, and confidence in return of assistance; (5) trust in the community (30). According to the theory of social capital, the many components in this concept are a behavioral/activity component (also called structural social capital, e.g., participation) and a cognitive/perceptual component (also called cognitive social capital, e.g., trust) (46).\n\nKalasha's structural and cognitive social capital are reflected from the themes of intra-communal bonding and correspond to connections among individuals who resemble each other such as individuals in Kalasha community or individuals of the same socioeconomic status (also known as bonding social capital). The evidence of a relationship between social capital and mental health was shown in a systematic review. This reveals the presence of a negative relationship between the individual level cognitive social capital and common mental disorders (47). Furthermore, the past research (48) has shown better health outcomes in the communities where there is higher involvement of people in community activities as compared to those communities where there is lower civic engagement. Kalasha surely seem to have high involvement in community activities as also evident from the themes of Intra-communal bonding and sharing, and Kalasha festivals and traditions.\n\nThe research also showed a positive correlation between social participation (such as cultural festivals) and wellbeing. Past empirical evidence suggests: community festivals are associated with opportunities for community cultural development (49); festivals are building blocks for communities and encourage ethnic understanding within society (49–51), festivals safeguard and celebrate local traditions, history, and culture, or can be used as an approach to spread a destination's lifecycle (52). Engagement, a measure of a person's purpose in life, is a chief element in positive psychology. Research has linked engagement with various health outcomes, both physical and psychological (53). Seligman emphasized the significance of well-being, and gave forth five quantifiable measures to reflect this construct; referred by the acronym PERMA: Positive Emotion, Engagement, Positive Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment (53). According to Seligman, higher engagement is associated with improved well-being and a meaningful life (53).\n\nThere is a role of community-based festivals in improving mental health and wellbeing at the individual, organizational, and community level, however, there is limited research investigating the link between community festivals and wellbeing. The festivals are shown to bring about meaningful and fulfilling social interactions beneficial for health and wellbeing at the individual as well as community level (48, 54). This is well related with the theme of Kalasha festivals and traditions and Behavioral practices of happiness and cognitive patterns, where they discussed in detail how good they feel planning and celebrating these festivals and how it becomes a source of happiness for them and serves as a protective factor against psychological problems.\n\nAlso, referring to Kalasha's concept of purity, the positive meaning of the term ónǰeṣṭa doesn't mean that prágaṭa is associated with sin or the devil (5, 55). Also, like our understanding of the “pure/impure”, these two poles of ónǰeṣṭa and prágaṭa are not related to sexual morals, cleanliness or devotion (5, 18). Nowadays, as a result of living with Muslims and influence of Islam, Kalasha people talk about paradise and hell and occasionally relate the myth of Adam and Eve. However, the true Kalasha tradition has no concept of after life, idea of a prize or a punishment in the hereafter—a view found also in the Veda (5, 56) and in early Rome (5, 56).\n\nIn case of violating the rituals, apology is sought ritually and reward for praiseworthy acts is granted here on Earth, with the respect they give and the endless memory posterity will keep of the person who performed them. The idea of immortality does not seem to be linked to something that survives death, like the Christian/Islamic soul, and it is not related to another world. However, it has to do with being remembered in this world. According to the Kalasha, remembrance is kept alive through the songs and panegyrics rejoicing the feats of the ancestors, continually carried out at every festival, and through the wooden statues (effigies) engraved for those who in their lives have achieved commendable deeds (5). In discussing the Kalasha's concept of purity in light of literature, we cannot move beyond the ground breaking research of Kohlberg, where morality was conceptualized in terms of harm and justice, which included values relating to individual rights, fairness, and personal autonomy (57). Nevertheless, moral judgments can encompass other domains besides harm and justice such as loyalty to group, respecting authority, and, conserving purity and sacredness. Kalasha forms the best example of conformity, respecting authority, loyalty to their ethnic group and Kalasha's efforts for conserving purity and sacredness are evident from their concept of ónǰeṣṭa and prágaṭa.\n\nLastly, the domain of purity comprises values and principles oriented at safeguarding the sacredness of the body and soul. It is the belief in the purity domain that people ought to be, in their bodies and minds, clean, chaste, self-controlled, and spiritually pure and should endeavor to lead life in a sacred, divine way (the belief in deity is not a necessary requirement). From the stance of purity, to reject polluting forces or hedonistic pleasure, to purify the soul, and to behave according to the “natural order” is righteous. It is immoral to act in a way that is “self-polluting, filthy, profane, carnal, hedonistic, unnatural, animal-like, or ungodly” (58–60).\n\nWe can understand the theme of Kalasha's behavioral practices of happiness and cognitive patterns by relating it with the “savoring” concept of positive psychology. It is believed that savoring, as the set of cognitive or behavioral strategies, is a monitoring process impacting the association between positive events and a person's positive affective responses to these incidents (61, 62). Savoring is defined as a mechanism whereby individuals engage “to attend to, appreciate, and enhance the positive experiences in their lives” (42).\n\nAccording to Bryant and Veroff, there are many cognitive and behavioral strategies of savoring that are involved in enhancing and extending positive experiences, including sharing the event with others, behavioral expression, counting blessings, self-congratulation, memory building, and sensory-perceptual sharpening (42). Another concept resembling savoring is view of “capitalizing” given by Langston (63). Capitalizing is defined as constructively understanding positive incidents (63). The past empirical evidence has shown the effectiveness of savoring as a mechanism of positive affective regulation that maintains and deepens positive emotions (42, 64, 65). There is a mediating and/or moderating role of savoring in the relationship between positive events and happiness (42). Now as we have explained and related the findings of psychological resilience of the current study with the past literature, in next section we will discuss the second major component of the current study i.e., mental health conceptualization of Kalasha.\n\nThe first theme in the perceived mental health causes of Kalasha was Biological and psychosocial causes. The past empirical studies have suggested three models regarding the causes and treatment of mental health; the supernatural, biological and psychosocial models. The people in developed countries have more inclination toward and accept biological and genetic aetiologies of mental health issues (66–68). But surprisingly the minority community of Kalasha from a developing country seems to have an adequate understanding of biological and psychosocial causes of illness. The biological model suggesting chemical imbalance, hereditary and genetic causes of illness as well as the psychosocial model linking mental health problems with issues such as stress, trauma, abuse, and family and relational conflicts have received considerable empirical support (69–74).\n\nThe literature has highlighted that the people in developing countries have more inclination toward and accept supernatural forces, evil spirits and spiritual aetiologies of mental health issues and choose indigenous treatment modes (75–79). Despite the fact that Kalasha do have an understanding of biological and psychosocial causes but they also seems to believe in the supernatural causes of mental health problems. A meta-synthesis study revealed the perception of people assigning mental health issues to blessings and spiritual connection with God and getting special attention from nature (80, 81). Moreover, the belief on spiritual treatments as the preferred mode of treatment was present in the past studies (80–83).\n\nThe supernatural model of mental health issues has received support from a few studies (82, 83). However, according to a few research studies, traditional healers are shown as providers of effective psychosocial intervention; relieving distress and improving mild symptoms in common mental issues such as depression and anxiety (28, 75, 80). Nevertheless, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of traditional healers in managing severe mental health problems such as bipolar, psychotic disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (28, 75).\n\nThere is a possibility that the traditional healing could bring more harms than good. It is likely that individuals with mild issues and positive expectations seek subjective benefit from joining their chosen traditional or spiritual healers. There is existence of value in those individuals seeking and finding meaning in attending the traditional healers. The individuals find the traditional healers beneficial despite absence of any betterment in symptoms. There is ambiguity about how these traditional healers work, though exhaustive regular social interventions usually attain better results as compared to short-termed single interventions. The same concern is also raised by few of our study participants who seem skeptical of the traditional and supernatural methods.\n\nThere is a call for a more holistic care and potential synergies for mental health, if an association between healing systems can be enabled for the individuals having cultural and spiritual beliefs contrary to conventional psychiatry (84). Our participant discussed about herbal methods as treatment of health related problems. The herbal medicine—a famous complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is used worldwide (85) in treatments of a range of health issues which may include common mental health problems (86). Lastly, we will discuss how our chosen theoretical framework of Bronfenbrenner's ecosystems can be applicable in the context of this study for Kalasha. The same has been discussed in the result section with the themes where Bronfenbrenner's system seems applicable.\n\nInterpersonal relationships comprise the microsystem and mesosystem. When Kalasha discussed about strong interpersonal relationship, communal bonding and sharing and celebrating their festival, this actually refers to their strong microsystem and macrosystem. The microsystem recognizes a person's face-to-face interaction with others such as his/her family, school, and peers (2, 86, 87). However, the mesosystem deals with multiple microsystems that operate side by side (1); for instance, a Kalasha celebrating their traditional festival after consulting with their traditional/religious elders who decides the date of the festival.\n\nThe macrosystem—comprising the overarching worldview of a community and culture—investigated the uniformities within the subculture, existing belief system in the culture, or ideology that had been formulated from the lower order systems (87). The macrosystem is the most relevant system in the case of Kalasha as their lives are guided by their traditional beliefs and they valued a lot to their ancestral traditions and promoting their communal bonding. This model enlightened the researcher that a person's ecological mechanisms occur in a dynamic manner with interplay of various factors (27, 28).\n\nStrengths, limitations, and future directions\n\nThis study established the usefulness of the Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model in recognizing various resilience factors in a developing individual's environmental context, but the focus on the exosystem and chronosystem was less in Kalasha's context of this study. Only one participant's example illustrated in the theme of psychosocial causal factors reflects the relevance of chronosystem where she commented about the societal and geopolitical pressure and environment surrounded by the Kalasha. Additionally, this model offers a baseline of characteristics to acknowledge the developing individual's protective factors. This study explores the intricacies and complexities regarding mental health existing in the environment of the Kalasha youth.\n\nThe limitation of the study includes the broader scope of the study as this study is one of the first initiatives to conduct empirical study on Kalasha from the psychological/mental health angle, therefore there was no past psychological literature available on Kalasha. Hence, we decided to frame this study with the broader scope of mental health rather than operationalizing the specific variables representing mental health. Secondly, despite the Bronfenbrenner bioecological model's identification of protective factors, there is a possibility that any other possible resilience factor may have overlooked, which we (researcher and participants) couldn't bring in during the interview.\n\nFuture studies can be planned on Kalasha to explore the relationship between their savoring practices and psychological wellbeing and happiness as well as on their acculturation process. In any future study, it is recommended to include local collaborators who belong to the Kalasha community in order to promote decolonizing research."
