The vibrant city of Islamabad bookends your trip, with visits to the Faisal Mosque and National Heritage Museum plus a memorable dinner in the Margalla Hills.\n\nA drive through the North West Frontier Province brings you to the laidback mountain town of Chitral with its famous fort, colourful bazaar and a chance perhaps to catch a local game of polo! Heading into the Kalash Valley, visit the gardens at Ayun en route to a local homestay in the village of Balanguru.\n\nYou're set up now for days serving up some of the world's most dramatic drives, taking in places like the Wakhan Corridor, the Shandur Pass (where you'll enjoy a picnic lunch at 3800m), plus a trip to Mt Rakaposhi.\n\nHunza provides another memorable base, surrounded by 7000m peaks. Visit the recently restored Baltit Fort and stroll along the town's water channels, as well as meeting the friendly locals in nearby Karimabad.\n\nThere are more four-wheeled adventures along the Karakoram Highway (KKH)  the road to China  where amid stunning mountain vistas you'll walk on the Hope Glacier and see the Attabad Lake, as well as enjoying lunch accompanied by jaw-dropping vistas at Rakaposhi View.\n\nPrice includes all activities/equipment, tour leaders, local guides and drivers, meals, mineral water, all transport (excluding international flights) , all accommodation and all entrance fees as outlined in the itinerary."
