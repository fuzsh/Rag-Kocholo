In this research study, MLP-type ANNs with one hidden layer have been used for modeling jar tests to determine the dosage level of coagulant used in water treatment processes. The data contained in this research have been obtained from the drinking water treatment plant located in the Ardabil province in Iran. To evaluate the performance of the model, the mean square error and the correlation coefficient parameters have been used.\n\nQuantity and quality benefits of in-service invasive cleaning of trunk mains\n\nIftekhar Sunny, Stewart Husband, Nick Drake, Kevan Mckenzie, and Joby Boxall\n\nDrink. Water Eng.

Hydraulic calibration showed a 7x roughness height reduction after ice slurry pigging, although turbidity response due to carefully imposed shear stress increase remained significant, indicating loose materials had not been fully removed from the pipe wall. Due to ongoing material accumulation, one-off intervention may not be sufficient to manage the quality risk.\n\nQualitative and quantitative monitoring of drinking water through the use of a smart electronic tongue\n\nAlvaro A.

The results showed an excellent ability to discriminate the samples and predict some analytical parameters of interest in controlling their physicochemical quality. This made it possible to conclude that the device called smart electronic tongue has a high technological potential for monitoring drinking water.\n\nTowards a cyber-physical era: soft computing framework based multi-sensor array for water quality monitoring\n\nJyotirmoy Bhardwaj, Karunesh K. Gupta, and Rajiv Gupta\n\nDrink. Water Eng. Sci., 11, 9–17, https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-11-9-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-11-9-2018, 2018\n\nFinal revised paper published in DWES (8 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReliable and effective continuous water quality monitoring has always been challenging. To detect water quality, deployment of multiple sensor nodes in a water distribution network generates complex and convoluted data sets. This paper demonstrates the implementation of a cyber-physical system along with soft-computing approaches (Python and fuzzy). The designed system monitors water quality in real time, simplifies the complexity of sensor data and assists water engineers in decision making.\n\nLimitations of demand- and pressure-driven modeling for large deficient networks\n\nMathias Braun, Olivier Piller, Jochen Deuerlein, and Iraj Mortazavi\n\nDrink.

This is done regarding two modeling paradigms. First for models with customer demand as a fixed boundary condition and second for models that add a boundary condition on the minimum network pressure. The following discussion concludes that pressure-driven models are superior in modeling deficient networks, but still have to be improved.\n\nIdentifying (subsurface) anthropogenic heat sources that influence temperature in the drinking water distribution system\n\nClaudia M. Agudelo-Vera, Mirjam Blokker, Henk de Kater, and Rob Lafort\n\nDrink. Water Eng.

In the Netherlands drinking water is distributed without additional residual disinfectant and drinking water temperature at the customers' tap should not exceed 25 ÂºC. Some urban infrastructures are heat sources and generate hot-spots. This article describes a method to find anthropogenic heat sources that influence temperature in the DWDS.\n\nOnline total organic carbonÂ (TOC) monitoring for water and wastewater treatment plants processes and operations optimization\n\nCÃ©line Assmann, Amanda Scott, and Dondra Biller\n\nDrink.

TOC monitoring, implemented as a tool to make informative and rapid treatment decisions, becomes a useful process control parameter. This paper discusses the various technologies available and details how three municipal plants gained insights into their processes and saved on their spending with TOC.\n\nNatural manganese deposits as catalyst for decomposing hydrogen peroxide\n\nA.

Hence, an economical water filtration technology was explored, which is bio-sand filtration. In order to enhance the removal of nitrates through denitrification, a modified bio-sand filter with ethanol as an external carbon source at C / N ratios of 1.1 and 1.8 was investigated. The results of the research showed a removal rate of 53 % at a C / N ratio of 1.8.\n\nOnline modelling of water distribution systems: a UK case study\n\nJ. Machell, S. R. Mounce, and J. B.

Adio, Emmanuel A. Osowade, Adam O. Muritala, Adebayo A. Fadairo, Kamar T. Oladepo, Surajudeen O. Obayopo, and Paul O. Fase\n\nDrink. Water Eng.

Solar desalination is an eco-friendly, accessible and affordable technology. We show that there is a direct relationship between and huge dependency on solar still daily distillate yield in the solar radiation intensity and the temperature difference between the condensing inner glass cover and the water. Hence, we hope to have drinkable water for all using solar power technology.\n\nModeling and clustering water demand patterns from real-world smart meter data\n\nNicolas Cheifetz, Zineb Noumir, Allou SamÃ©, Anne-Claire Sandraz, CÃ©dric FÃ©liers, and VÃ©ronique Heim\n\nDrink.

Water Eng. Sci., 10, 13–26, https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-10-13-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-10-13-2017, 2017\n\nFinal revised paper published in DWES (6 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn Colombia in the last decades, turbidity and contamination events have become a major concern for many environmental authorities and drinking water companies. Therefore, there is a need for alternative technologies to improve the quality of the source water used for the water supply. This article assesses the potential of using riverbank filtration for the highly turbid waters in Colombia, emphasizing water quality improvement and the influence of clogging by suspended solids.\n\nAll-in-one model for designing optimal water distribution pipe networks\n\nDagnachew Aklog and Yoshihiko Hosoi\n\nDrink. Water Eng. Sci., 10, 33–38, https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-10-33-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-10-33-2017, 2017\n\nFinal revised paper published in DWES (6 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn developed countries, a safe and adequate water supply is usually taken for granted. However, an estimated 700 million people worldwide still live without access to this basic service. In order to achieve universal water coverage by 2030, either global spending on water projects should increase, which is not easy as it stands now, or the cost of water supply systems should decrease. This paper discusses the development of appropriate pipe network design methods, or models, for the latter.\n\nDo low-cost ceramic water filters improve water security in rural South Africa?\n\nJens Lange, Tineke Materne, and JÃ¶rg GrÃ¼ner\n\nDrink. Water Eng. Sci., 9, 47–55, https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-9-47-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-9-47-2016, 2016\n\nFinal revised paper published in DWES (6 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we investigate the suitability of a specific low-cost water filter for drinking water treatment in households of rural South Africa. Distributed in the field, none of 51 individually tested water filters produced water without distinct contamination, and more than one-third even deteriorated hygienic water quality. We therefore recommend frequent monitoring of the filter performance at the point of use and identify dip slides as an efficient tool to assess critical contamination.\n\nOptimized photodegradation of Bisphenol A in water using ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 photocatalysts under UV radiation as a decontamination procedure\n\nRudy Abo, Nicolai-Alexeji Kummer, and Broder J.

Sci., 9, 27–35, https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-9-27-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/dwes-9-27-2016, 2016\n\nFinal revised paper published in DWES (6 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContamination of water resources is continuously compounded as a result of rapid industrial development, particularly in heavily populated urban areas. This work proposes a water treatment method from endocrine disrupting resin Bisphenol A by means of photodegradation and oxidation techniques. The methodology was developed after many lab experiments, and we believe that our results will support future research on water purification techniques from organic contamination products.\n\nConfirming anthropogenic influences on the major organic and inorganic constituents of rainwater in an urban area\n\nK.
