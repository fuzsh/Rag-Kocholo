        "text": "There is strong scriptural (Vedas) and oral historical (Itihasa) evidence in India for movement of royal Kshatriya clans such as the Druhyus, Anus, Turvasus out of India particularly in the Northwestern direction. Talageri, Elst, Frawley, Kazanas, Kocchar, etc. place the Urheimat in the Indian subcontinent and differ mainly in location (Afghanistan/Pakistan/Present day India). Such scriptural evidence has been backed by developments in the realm of population genetics , particularly with relation to the spread of the R1A1 Y-chromosome.\n\nArchaelogical evidence is inconclusive while linguistic evidence is either of the controversial kind or generally agreed to favor the Aryan Invasion theory.\n\nOne of the weaknesses of the OIT has been the lack of a cultural trail. The well-known evidence consisting of the invocation of Vedic deities Indra, Varuna, Mitra and Nasatya in a treaty between the Mitanni and Hittites in 1380 BC, was originally construed as evidence for AIT (the Mittanni Indo-Aryan superstate being a rest-stop during the migration from Europe), but has since been viewed more objectively as evidence for OIT.\n\nIn this context, the isolated and intriguing Kalash people offer support to OIT. These people practise a very ancient form of Vedic Hinduism invoking Indra at sacrifices, worship of idols of Indra, etc. How arcane and unusual this is may be grasped from the fact that such direct worship to Indra as God (not demigod) has not taken place in the Indian subcontinent for at least the last 2500 years. In spite of being located in Nooristan, surrounded by puritanical muslim neighbors, the Kalash people have a very relaxed view of male-female relationships and females enjoy the right to what can best be described as \"Swayamvara\". I am providing.....\n\nTaken together, these disparate bits of data point to the Kalash people being the hidden link potentially proving the northwestern migration of Vedic Kshatriya clans Out of India.\n\nMod Edit: Because it created nothing but problems, we do not allow DNA as a topic of discussion here on historum.\n\nOk, since this thread is open, I guess the Mods don't have issues with it. I just wanted to be sure.\n\nSome of the basic problems with the OIT theory is timing. The most important being the IVC. The IVC was obviously not Vedic in nature, though certain aspects of the late Mature Harappan phase do show certain cultural features that we associate with Vedism. The point however is that in the timelines discussed for an OIT the nature of the IVC was very different in things as basic as the subsistence patterns from the PIE communities.\n\nAnother problem is imperative. Historically subcontinental communities haven't shown all that much drive to move outwards. Why would they? The subcontinent has a climate and fecundity that is unmatched by neighboring regions. Thus there's the problem of why exactly would a PIE community move outwards from the Subcontinent.\n\nAnother problem is timing. Reading the Vedas suggests that the Vedic communities initially viewed the Gangetic regions as veing unfavorable but overtime considered it as central. Now the timeline suggests that the Vedic Indians moved into the Gangetic plains sometime around the post 1500 BCE era. The issue here is that why exactly did it take them so much longer to move a few hundred kilometers east into very fertile territory over thousands of kilometers west into highly inhospitable (and already inhabited by fairly advanced cultures) territory?\n\nThen again, its my understanding that we dont find evidence of horses in the subcontinental region until very late in the timeline, which suggests that the origins of the PIE was not in India, since horses were quite central to them, as ofcourse was cattle.\n\nBasically the OIT is founded on the premise that the Rg Veda is much more archaic than supposed. However, this too is linguistic evidence, which means that we have problems. What is the basis for example, for asserting that the Rg Veda is older than the Mittani texts (One of the core OIT assertions)? After all, what stops the Mitanni from being as old as if not older than the Vedas? If you wish to ignore Linguistic evidence, then unfortunately we aren't left with much, since we cannot really date the Vedas authoritatively as being significantly older than we currently do. Even if we throw in the Saraswati river problem\n\nOk, since this thread is open, I guess the Mods don't have issues with it.

If you wish to ignore Linguistic evidence, then unfortunately we aren't left with much, since we cannot really date the Vedas authoritatively as being significantly older than we currently do. Even if we throw in the Saraswati river problem\n\nI agree there are problems, but none of them are insurmountable. More evidence and studies are clearly needed. Besides, the problems with AIT are also quite severe, so its helpful to keep an open mind.\n\nI think the Sapta-Saraswati river problem you mentioned is central to the whole vexing question of the Aryan people. Other than India, Saraswati shows up in the most unusual places (e.g. Croatia where the word in the native language is Hrvat, which due to linguistic centum-satem shift is derived from Saraswat).\n\nHow can a river system that geology and astronomy say was last alive at least 12000 years old be reconciled with its ubiquitous presence in the Vedas, Upanishads and even the Itihasas ? Also the decline of the river is attested to - for instance the river in the Mahabharata is mentioned to be nowhere as mighty as in the Vedas.\n\nThree methods have been used to reconcile these contradictions:\n\n1) The \"Raj and Marxist historian\" argument: The river is mythological and allusions to it should be treated as poetic ramblings\n\n2) The \"Give Credit to Indigenous Records\" argument: Take the ancients at face value. If they said the Saraswati existed and was the mightiest river they had seen, then it did.\n\n3) The \"midway\" argument: The river existed but refers to a different system - either the Danube/Rhine system (Nazis, now discredited), Volga/Dnieper system (later AIT theorists) or the Hakra/Amu Darya system in Afghanistan (Kochhar & others).\n\nArgument 3 is frankly untenable because the other river systems form too tortured a fit when the seven river system of Saraswati correlated with place names and river/tributary names & locations make it an overwhelming natural fit.\n\nSo, its a western now, and in the gunfight, one has to choose either argument 1 or argument 2. There is no other way. I go with argument 2.\n\nSo if Saraswati is real, that means Aryavarta is much older than recognized. This is also consistent with the internal dating of the scriptures and Itihasas, which would suggest much earlier dates for the Vedic period and IVC as a mature, perhaps even declining stage of Aryan civilization.\n\nRegarding impetus, the point I have been making in other posts and in this one, is that large number of royal Kshatriya clans were driven out during various periods (Battle of Ten Kings, Parashuram's exterminations, aftermath of Mahabharata War). Furthermore, even bands of Kshatriyas who went out seeking adventure/conquest would be able to leave huge genetic traces on the nations they conquered, due to the uneven population distribution in the Bronze Age & Iron Age (India + China making up 90 % of world population as opposed to 30% in the present day).\n\nFinally, you will notice that over the decades, the AIT school also keeps pushing the Urheimat more and more to the east. Airyanam Vaejo was initially Germany, then Baltic States (esp. Lithuania), then Anatolia, then Central Asia.\n\nHere is another link (authored by Prof. Michael Witzel) pointing to the very close correspondences between the present religious customs of the Kalash people and the very ancient Vedic religion/culture.\n\nI use the word ancient merely to highlight once again the incongruity of the preservation of religious symbolism and rituals that have not been in vogue in India even amongst Vedic Brahmins for a very long time.\n\nThe religion of kalash is similar to vedic hinduism and we can assume that both have the same origin but their religion is still quite different and they lived isolated from most indo-aryans.So we find almost no influences from post-rigvedic religions among the Kalash people.Some of their religious concept are even older than vedic hinduism and belong to common indo-aryan and older indo-iranian heritage.Many of their gods are not found in ancient or modern india and are only popular among them and the Nuristani people.But they have also typically vedic gods like indra(verin).We see also influences from pre-indoeuropean Hindukush-Himalaya-Pamir traditions among them and their religion is today a mix of very archaic indo-aryan/indo-iranian and old pre-indoeuropean traditions of the Hindukush.\n\nTheir language is very archaic and some believe that their language is today the most similar language to ancient sanskrit.But i am not sure about that and would be careful about such statements\n\nThe kalash people lived very isolated in the past and had only contact with the Nuristani people.They are different from all populations near them and have their own unique cluster.It seems that they are descendants of an very ancient and special population which not mixed much with other people for several thousands years.But they are related to Central/South asian populations and show no recent european ancestry.So they are not descendants of greeks and actually the Kalash people have no cultural or linguistic greek influences\n\nThe religion of kalash is similar to vedic hinduism and we can assume that both have the same origin but their religion is still quite different and they lived isolated from most indo-aryans.So we find almost no influences from post-rigvedic religions among the Kalash people.Some of their religious concept are even older than vedic hinduism and belong to common indo-aryan and older indo-iranian heritage.Many of their gods are not found in ancient or modern india and are only popular among them and the Nuristani people.We see also influences from pre-indoeuropean Hindukush-Himalaya-Pamir traditions among them and their religion is today a mix of very archaic indo-aryan/indo-iranian and old pre-indoeuropean traditions of the Hindukush.\n\nTheir language is very archaic and some believe that their language is today the most similar language to ancient sanskrit.But i am not sure about that and would be careful about such statements\n\nThe kalash lived very isolated in the past and had only contact with the Nuristani people.Genetically they are different from all populations near them and have their own unique cluster.It seems that they are descendants of an very ancient and special population which not mixed much with other people for several thousands years.But they are related to Central/South asian populations and show no recent european ancestry.So they are not descendants of greeks and actually the Kalash people have no greek influences.\n\nI think you ignore the elephant in the room, which is the nature of the Vedic religion. As Srikant Talageri has convincingly demonstrated in his books, the Rig Veda is merely one strand of the Vedic religion. It was specifically the strand that was solemnized by the preceptors from the Aangirasa Gotra of preceptors, patronized by the kings & emperors of the Bharata line of the Puru-Trtsus, and from whom India derives its name of Bhaarat.\n\nIt is very clear for instance that the Atharva Veda which represented the Vedic strand of the Bhaargava fire-priests was the only other strand of Purva Mimamsa (ritualistic Vedic religion) that managed to survive in India, despite Bhaargavas being the preceptors of the enemies of the Bharatas on occasion.\n\nThe other Aryan tribes (Anus, Druhyus, Turvasus, Pakthas, Parthas, etc) likely had their own preceptors. This comes though obliquely in Twashtra (Persian Thustra ?) Prajapati's irreconcilable opposition to Indra.\n\nIt is therefore entirely consistent with the OIT hypothesis that the Kalash people would have customs that differ from all post-Vedic religions and retain some pre-Vedic character."
