He has exceptionally crafted the book that mentioned the Kalash people as the last survivors of the Hindu Kush.\n\nThe majority of the people of Kalash are pagans, Kafirs, not worshipping any god. Many still refuse to embrace Islam and cling to their rites, rituals, and beliefs. According to the author, the Kalasha community of infidels is the last survivor whose legacy will always remain alive behind Hindu Kush mountain range.\n\nIn the book Kalash – The Last Hindu-Kush Infidels, Jean-Yves pays a tribute to a beautiful and enchanting civilization which is different in every aspect. Through this book, Jean-Yves made it clear that animists and polytheists of Kalash are present near the east side of the Afghan border. The other side of the land has Muslims or converted people who embraced Islam. Today, half of the population of Kalash has not immersed in the Muslim faith."
