        "text": "Introduction / History\n\nThe Kalash people live in the mountains around the borders of China, Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan. These northern tribes are probably the original inhabitants of this area.\n\nThe Kalash people take much pride in their history and language and claim to have remained, for the most, independent throughout most of its history. The Kalash are also known as the Black Kafir, Chitrali, Chitralis, Citrali, Khowar, Koh, Qashqari, or the Qasqari. They speak Khowar.\n\nWhat Are Their Lives Like?\n\nThe Kalash, as well as the other northern tribes, are known as brave, quiet, peace-loving people. Most live in rugged mountain regions, where farming is very difficult. They are mostly farmers and shepherds. Their primary crop is grain, however in the more irrigated areas they can raise barley, wheat, maize, millet and rice. They can only rely on one annual crop, so they must rely on transhumant herding, which means they must transfer their livestock from one place to another for grazing. During the summer, the livestock is herded to alpine areas.\n\nIt is only during the winter that the Kalash live together in compact villages. Many families have houses in four or five different areas at higher altitudes.\n\nThe Kalash are divided into three social classes. The upper class is the ruling nobility, the middle class tend to be landowners, and the lower-class work as tenant farmers or hired laborers. Most only marry within their own group. While the societies tend to be patrilineal, where the line of decent is traced through the men, the women are not as secluded as other groups within the country are. The women do much of the farm work.\n\nWhat Are Their Beliefs?\n\nThe Kalash people are mostly Sunni Muslims; however, many combine the Islamic practices with their traditional folk religions. These practices involve the worship of spirits and fire, animism, and ancestor worship. Many consult shamans, priests, to cure the sick, communicate with spirits, and manipulate the spirits to control events. There are no known Christians or churches among the Kalash.\n\nWhat Are Their Needs?\n\nThe Kalash are an isolated group due to the rugged terrain and political borders. Portable drinking water, sewage disposal, and drainage facilities are available for a small percentage of the northern tribe's population, which has led to many health problems. Poor nutrition is also a problem in their area.\n\nPrayer Points\n\nPray for loving workers to go to them and help with their physical needs.\n\nPray for the Lord to send a powerful gospel witness to the Kalash people in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nPray for them to have the spiritual hunger it takes to embrace Christ no matter what the cost.\n\nScripture Prayers for the Kalash (Chitrali) in Pakistan.\n\nReferences\n\nThe World Missions Atlas Project"
