        "text": "The present study was conducted in Bumburet valley of Kalash, District Chitral, Pakistan. The key technique used for data collection was participant observation in which the researcher lived in the community, observed and documented their cultural patterns as an indicator of their traditional culture which includes religious songs, folklore, dress, art and crafts, as a basis for identity. The basic purpose of the study was to understand the role and significance of arts and architecture as a prime tool for establishing identity for the conventional people of Kalash. The people of Kalash have managed to maintain their identity through their unique arts and crafts. Tradition resists change and most often remains unaltered in a static spatial arrangement. The changes which incorporate in Kalash traditions may find their way through peripheral adjustments. The traditions in art and crafts are scanty to find and the present artifacts does not throw any light on their origin. The art and architecture available signify their unique ways, and tradition which is definitely different from the other ethnic tribes in the shared geographical arrangement. The Kalash ethnic identity has faced several challenges like colonization in the past and modernization and technological advancement and conversion to Islam in the present. The Kalash insist on keeping their self-identity as well as participating in modernity. They have maintained their centuries old traditional culture, despite the fact of current globalization, and modernization.\n\nThe significance to reach to the everyday life-knocking them and their culture has a marvelousness as usual facets of daily presence. The Kalasha and their structure bedecked with their households with which they are breathing within daily life approach area accommodating to reconstruct the term consumer in direction to depict the drive of Kalash society is being respite within their cultural consumption parameters. The cultural material of the Kalasha, to understand the tradition of cultural ingesting the is needed to query the assumption that integrated inescapably means fetching like to what one fascinates the objects. Several other contributions have been made on Kalasha cultural material particularly those revolving within their cultural anthropology and their material studies etc. The discussion will sight that how the Kalasha household objects execute these social relationships through a detailed discussion or of the respondent. Kalasha, the material culture, refers to the objects that have been acquired and brought into the home-based in a diversity of ways, and the main discussion rests upon how these things have been appropriated to maintain and breeding significant social relations and acquaintances. It is unavoidable fact that many of these objects have been acquired and managed as a result of gift-giving practices between family, friends. This process of exchange may have on an empathetic of how commodities move value and meaning after they have been exchanged. Kalashdur Museum Material culture educates not only the common mass but the visitors, nevertheless, focus not just on the artifacts themselves but rather the meaning of those objects to the people that they are unaware of their historicity. One of the landscapes that designate the Kalasha culture, humans apart from other aspects is the degree to which the people intermingle with the social objects whether they are used or traded, or they are curated or discarded within the timeline spaces.\n\nAbstract Sanjukta De, University of Calcutta, India The Asian Conference on Arts & Humanities 2023 Official Conference Proceedings Tuman is a small village located at 10 km away from Katghora in the Korba District of present day Chhattisgarh, India. This place is considered to be the first capital of the Haihaya or Kalachuri Royal Dynasty of South Kosala. According to its political, social, religio-cultural importance this place gained attention of the researchers. This historic region of Chhattisgarh also gained archaeological importance by owning the 15 ruins of intricately sculptured stones principally of ancient temples. This locality is one of the protected areas in Chhattisgarh declared by the Archaeological Survey of India. The architectural wonders of Tuman not just only attract tourists, but also raise so many vital queries among Historians including Archaeologists and young research scholars as well. Like – when did this small settlement become the centre of the authority of the Kalachuri Dynasty? Are these monuments carrying out one single style of temple architecture or are they showcasing the composite structural pattern? Based on religious perspective, this place can portray a successful picture of communal compatibility as well. This paper intends to focus on how Tuman transformed into the capital of the Kalachuri Dynasty from an elementary stage of a Janapada. This paper would discuss the detailed architectural features of the temples and other monumental remains of that place based on a thorough field study. Lastly, I would also like to highlight how political anxiety and religious harmony went hand in hand to make Tuman a unique ancient archaeological site in India. Keywords: Kalachuri Dynasty, Haihayavanshi, South Kosala, Archaeological Survey of India, Janapadas\n\nMunsiyari is a region located at an altitude of 2,200 meters in the hilly state of Uttarakhand, India. The eponymous town is surrounded by twenty-two villages mostly inhabited by Bhotiya tribes, who once formed a community that traded with those crossing from India to Tibet, though this trade came to an abrupt end with the 1962 Sino-Indian war. Owing to the region’s prosperity, the villages exhibit a very interesting typology of hill architecture. This architectural identity is also a manifestation of a geographical and cultural response to a difficult terrain. Our study was carried out as part of the preparation of a dossier for inventorying the Kailash sacred landscape with the aim of documenting the present state of the traditional vernacular heritage of the selected indigenous community for the UNESCO nomination of the wider region. That thorough documentation process was used as a means of analyzing local vernacular heritage and its current situation, and with a view to offsett...\n\nRetrospection into the footprints of antiquity, into the life and culture of man and his surrounds has led to intriguing arguments as to the validation of architecture as a reflection of the culture, and architecture as a response to the surrounding \"physical determinist\" (2) factors by the most eminent. Architecture, described as a \"temporal art\" (6) is subject to continual change due to conscious or unconscious interventions with changing times and needs of the people. This paper attempts to validate the thoughts of the highest minds and also tries to establish a relationship between the evolution of built form as a response to the needs and culture also assess the role of \"physical determinist\" (2) factors that shape it over the years. A literary premise is established preceding the analysis of the settlement focusing on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1) The study being conducted at two levels, both macro and micro level gives an in depth understanding of the fabric at the settlement and the tissue level and validates the essential relationship between man's needs, life and built forms.\n\nThe cultural diversity of Asia has always attracted attention and curiosity towards the continent. Within this geographic region, India has been especially recognised for its variety of religions, languages and traditions, both historically and today. One of the lesser explored and recognised of these traditions exists in the mountainous region of the Western Himalayas, a culture with a distinct identity and architectural style. The Western Himalayas are broadly divided over three states: Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The Kinnaur valley is one of the most isolated regions of Himachal Pradesh that has fostered and respected its traditions and identity. Historically, Kinnaur had the second largest forest cover in India and its vernacular architecture revolves around the extensive use of wood. This particular building tradition is called Kath-Khuni. Today, one of the primary building materials used in Kath-Khuni construction, Deodar wood, is not easily available due to restrictions on timber procurement by the Forest Department. This combined with the easy availability of factory-made materials like cement and steel has impacted older building techniques. The research notes the patterns of change, resilience and adaptation of building traditions. Through an increased understanding of the components which contribute most effectively to the endurance of building traditions, the desired balance between tradition and modernity can be fostered. This is particularly pertinent for countries such as India, which sits at a threshold of increasing global influence. This dissertation encourages one to think about the future of such traditions in contemporary built environments. Key Words: Kath-Khuni, building traditions, resilience, change, adaptation, endurance, vernacular architecture, traditions.\n\nCultures diversity represents the unique mindset and structure of human life. Various customs, traditions social dogmas and livelihoods trends weave the pattern of human activities. Kafiristan is one of such community that lays in valleys of Kalash in Chitral district in northern Pakistan. The inhabitants of Kalash valley practice their own peculiar religion, customs and that are reflected through their art of making traditional costumes, weaving Crafts and wood sculptures. All features of their traditions art making and customs are incomplete without each other. There is still a constant resistance against any social change and the inhabitants are trying to maintain and preserve their indigenous cultural identity. This paper is based on qualitative analysis with focuses on exploration of the distinct and intertwined features of making and using traditional costumes, weaving crafts and wood sculptures as cultural identity of the Kalash.\n\nAt the foothills of the formidable Western Ghats of India lies a coastal strip of land, the Konkan Coast, which forms part of the extended coastline along the west coast of the country. The unique culture found in the Konkan coastal landscape has produced a magnificent ornamental style named Kaavi Kalé. Kaavi, or kavé, means in this context “red oxide”, while kalé means “art form”. It is fundamentally an incised work performed on an architectural surface that has been previously finished with lime plaster and then a red oxide layer over it. This forms elaborate murals and motifs inspired by the unique folklore of Dravidian culture. Although predominantly found in Hindu temples, this secular art form can also be seen in churches, a mosque, Jain temples and folk deity temples, as well as in domestic architecture. This paper presents the history of the art form, its techniques, a brief iconographic study of its compositions and possible methods of conservation, through accounts of exte..."
