As a matter of fact, Mount Kailash is 22,000 ft from the Tibetan Plateau, which is largely considered to be inaccessible. For Hindus and Buddhists, Mount Kailash is the physical embodiment of Mount Meru. Here are 10 of the most interesting, little-known facts about one of the world’s most sacred and mysterious mountain peak—Mount Kailash.\n\nRead More: All that you need to know about the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra 2016\n\n• Contrary to popular claims, the pyramid-shaped Mount Meru is the result of the possessed technical expertise of some superhuman divine beings.\n\n• According to the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures, around the Mount Meru exist ancient monasteries and caves wherein the holy sages reside in their material and subtle bodies. These caves can be seen by only a few fortunate ones.\n\n• Every year, thousands of pilgrims enter Tibet for pilgrimage to the holy Mount Kailash. A few make it to the region and a very few manage to finish circumambulating the hallowed peak. As for climbing up the summit, some daring mountaineers have attempted to do so, but with no luck.\n\n• Trekking all the way up to the peak of Mount Kailash is held to be a forbidden act among Hindus for the fear of trespassing the sanctity of the mountain and disturbing the divine energies residing there. As per a Tibetan lore, a monk named Milarepa once ventured far enough to reach the top of Mount Meru. When he returned, he forewarned everyone to avoid bothering the God resting high up in the peak.\n\n• Two beautiful lakes, namely Mansarovar and Rakshas Tal, are located at the base of Mount Kailash. Of the two, Mansarovar, which lies at an altitude of 14, 950 ft, is considered the highest freshwater body in the world.\n\n• While Mansarovar has a deep spiritual significance, its antithesis, Rakshas Tal, was born of the intense austerities performed by the demon King Ravana to please Lord Shiva. For its close association with a demoniac entity, the Rakshas Tal Lake is endowed with salty water and deprived of aquatic plant life and marine life.\n\nRead More: Kalpa and Kinner Kailash Range\n\n• Mount Kailash is believed to be the Axis Mundi aka the cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, centre of the world, the world tree. It is the point where heaven meets earth. The Google Maps vouch for the validity of this fact.\n\n• True to its nature, the water of the holy Lake Mansarovar stays placid whether it is windy or not. Also, its next-door neighbour, Rakshas Tal stays more or less turbulent.\n\n• Do not be surprised if you find your nails or hair grown by a few millimetres after returning from your Mount Meru trip. Tourists and pilgrims have discovered that the air of this ancient peak amps up the process of ageing!\n\n• Once a group of climbers of Siberian origin reached ahead of a certain point and immediately aged by a few decades. Shockingly, all of the trespassers died of old age a year after!\n\nShare the post and have your say in the comment box below!\n\nend of article\n\nAlso Read"
