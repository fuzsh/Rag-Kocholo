        "text": "During their tour to Pakistan in October 2019, British royal couple, Prince William and his wife Duchess of Cambridge Cate Middleton visited an indigenous community of Pakistan, called the Kalasha. Their pictures caught many eyes and I found many of my foreign friends asking me about the Kalasha.\n\nThe piece of land called Pakistan is home to many ethnic minorities due to its geographical location. Long before being called Pakistan, people from different parts of the world came and settled here. Only a few could keep their culture and values unchanged by the hardcore rightest majority of current-day Pakistan. One of these peoples is the indigenous tribe called Kalasha who has a history of over 3000 years.\n\nKalasha tribe lives in the beautiful district of Chitral in Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. Their population is only around 3500 to 4000. This area has always been a major tourist attraction. Located on a very high altitude, this valley has a pleasant summer and extremely cold winter. Their religion is also very different from other religions of the region. According to researchers, they are Animists, they believe in so many gods and spirits."
