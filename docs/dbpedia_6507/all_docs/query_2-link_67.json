        "text": "Kalashtar are a race of psionic humanoids from Adar on the continent of Sarlona.[4][5][6][7][8][9]\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe word kalashtar means \"wandering dreams\" in the Quori language.[10]\n\nDescription[]\n\nBeing the combination of humans who willingly fused with quori souls, kalashtar look much like humans, having the same ranges of eye, hair, and skin colors. Kalashtar are commonly tall and slim, though kalashtar of all sizes exist. The only real difference in kalashtar is their monastic behavior. Kalashtar children show the largest difference between them and their human counterparts but still, only in behavior. Whilst human children will run, play, laugh, and show an emotional immaturity, kalashtar children will take part in meditative practices, martial training, and telepathic conversations like their adult seniors. Growing up for the kalashtar is simply a physical process rather than an emotional or mental one.[5][7]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMany kalashtar are reclusive and prefer to stay in the temple-keeps of Adar, but some are driven by purpose to venture out into Eberron. Some of those that leave wish to end the siege on Adar by the Riedrans and others leave in an attempt to escape the Dreaming Dark. Kalashtar are commonly reserved, tranquil and tend to spend significant time thinking something through before acting. They're kind and caring towards others though, in an intellectual manner rather than emotional. It is not known exactly why kalashtar take a keen interest in controlling their emotions, but it is commonly believed to be due to the turmoil they suffer from their conjoined souls. They express their friendship with a wry smile and through offhand comments rather than being cordial or making lewd jokes. The fragments of the quori soul subsumed within the kalashtar keenly remember their escape from Dal Quor, and long to return someday.[7][8]\n\nKalashtar fleeing and hiding from the Dreaming Dark are cautious of others, though they remain invariably polite, kind, and even compassionate. Kalashtar are unable to merge their human half's sensitivity with the strange and wild visions and memories of their quori souls. Beneath their serene makeup, kalashtar are at conflict within themselves, struggling to fend off insanity. At times they begin to lose that struggle, displaying confusing and sometimes dangerous behavior. Dealing with the Dreaming Dark is the most important goal for kalashtar, as most see them as the ultimate evil in existence.[8]\n\nLifespan[]\n\nKalashtar have similar lifespans to humans.[4][7]\n\nAbilities[]\n\nKalashtar do not manifest dragonmarks.[5]\n\nHistory[]\n\nAbout 1800 years ago (1 AT), 67 quori spirits fled the plane of Dal Quor through mortal dreams to escape persecution. Led by the kalaraq quori Taratai, they eventually found their way to Haztaratain Monastery in Adar, where a human monk named Hazgaal and his students agreed to give the quori shelter. The monk and his students fused their souls with the quori spirits to become the first kalashtar, a distinct species that was a compound of both human and quori. Hazgaal and Taratai became the kalashtar Haztaratai, and used their combined wisdom to begin teaching the first precepts of the Path of Light.[4][10][11]\n\nWhen the first kalashtar child was born, the kalashtar discovered that the quori spirit had a bond with both parent and child, but that the essence of the spirit was more diffused, making it more difficult for the spirit to communicate with either host. As the kalashtar grew and adapted to their connection, they also discovered that they could develop psionic abilities.[10]\n\nFor several hundred years, the kalashtar began to expand across Adar, understanding their new abilities, and following the Path of Light.[10][11] Then almost 110 years ago, on 677 Age of Taratai (-125 YK), a series of psionic attacks known as the Madness of Yaruun took place on the Riedran side of the Rideran-Adaran border. The Inspired leaders of Riedra blamed the kalashtar for the attacks and invaded Adar. It is unknown whether the attacks actually were made by the kalashtar as they have no record of such an attack.[12]\n\nIn the autumn of 702 AT (-100 YK), Riedran forces laid siege to Kasshta Keep. The kalashtar descendants of Haztaratai gathered together a small force of monks to help defend the monastery. They engaged the Riedran army near the Kasshta River in a great clash of psionic power, driving the invaders back and capturing their leader. The war continued for several months, during which many of Taratai's lineage were killed. The last few remaining members of Taratai's lineage sacrificed themselves to create the shroud resonators that now protect Adar, ending an entire lineage of kalashtar.[11] However, the Riedrans also suffered great losses during their campaign, and chose instead to place Adar under constant siege.[12] The siege of Adar has been maintained by Riedra for over a thousand years in a stalemate that remains to this day.[10]\n\nCulture[]\n\nKalashtar Names[]\n\nKalashtar names are three to five syllables long and feature hard and hissing consonants. Male names end with one of the following suffixes -harath, -khad, -melk or -tash, whilst female names end with the female suffixes -kashtai, -shana, -tari or -vakri.[5]\n\nExample Masculine Names: Halkhad, Havrakhad, Kanatash, Lanamelk, Lanharath, Malharath, Minharath, Nevitash, Parmelk, Thakakhad, Thinharath.[7]\n\nExample Feminine Names: Ganitari, Khashana, Lakashtari, Mevakri, Novakri, Panitari, Sorashana, Thakashtai, Thatari.[7]\n\nLands[]\n\nThe majority of kalashtar live in mountainous region of Adar in Sarlona, though there are some that (with a strong enough reason) venture out into the rest of Eberron.[5][7] A significant minority of kalashtar live in insular communities in the major cities of Khorvaire, particularly Sharn. Most kalashtar choose to focus on fighting the Inspired, whilst others who are more in-tune with their compassionate side from closely following the Path of Light choose to fight evil in all its forms. Kalashtar get along well with all other races, however, being a psionic race from another realm, other races can see the kalashtar as strange or off-worldly.[13]\n\nReligion[]\n\nMain article: Path of Light\n\nMost kalashtar follow the Path of Light religion. They typically do not worship any deities. However, they believe in a universal force of good that they call Il-Yannah, or the Great Light.[4][5][6][8][14]\n\nAppendix[]\n\nFurther Reading[]\n\nRaces of Eberron\n\nReferences[]\n\nConnections[]"
