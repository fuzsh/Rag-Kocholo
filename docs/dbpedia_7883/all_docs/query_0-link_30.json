Twisted and propulsive, this thriller is told from the alternating perspectives of the couple and those close to them on Williwaw Island, each with their own motive to use the outcome of the murder case to their advantage. When a huge storm sweeps up the coast, trapping everyone on tiny Williwaw Island, it’s a race against time—and the elements — to stop the murderer from striking again.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nA boring drawn out simplistic plot\n\nBy RJD on 05-31-24\n\nStranger in the Woods\n\nBy: Anni Taylor\n\nNarrated by: Harriet Gordon-Anderson\n\nLength: 13 hrs and 57 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 19,178\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 17,833\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 17,755\n\nPhotographer Isla Wilson is thrilled she's landed her dream job, but the clients who hired her are getting stranger by the day. It sounded so perfect—a month's assignment at the lush Scottish Highlands property of architect Alban McGregor, and his wife, Jessica. But in the woods, there's a playhouse with a chilling history. Two years ago, the McGregors' daughter Elodie was abducted and then died in that playhouse. The townspeople insist her abductor had to be a stranger in their town. Alban refuses to knock the playhouse down, even keeping a picture of it on his wall.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nGood book!\n\nBy Tammy garrett on 09-13-22\n\nOne More to Die\n\nBy: Joy Ellis\n\nNarrated by: Hayley Atwell\n\nLength: 5 hrs and 1 min\n\nOriginal Recording\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 88\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 88\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 88\n\nDet.

Vietnam and Nixon dominated the national news. Both the near and distant future looked bleak. But they were five inseparable high school friends with something incredible in common: an unwavering resolve to look after each other no matter what hell life threw at them. And they were on a mission. The plan was simple: Go off the grid before they turned 18 to avoid the draft. They’d sell some grass, stack some cash, then head west and start a commune. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nThis really hit home.\n\nBy Ray Beaulieu on 05-26-24"
