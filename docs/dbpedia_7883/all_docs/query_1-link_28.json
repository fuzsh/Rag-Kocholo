        "text": "Fans of Ted's aggressively scattershot misanthropy may be left wanting by Seth MacFarlane's mock-western follow-up. Spiritually, it's closer to a mid-range crowd-pleaser such as City Slickers than Blazing Saddles, too enamoured of genre convention to reach for the comic dynamite.\n\nAs a sheep farmer who behaves like any other just-dumped fratboy, MacFarlane remains charmlessly needy, even after Charlize Theron's gunslinger is roped in to reassure him what a catch he is. Warped excellence lurks in the shadows – in the background parade of violent deaths, and Gilbert Gottfried's cameo as Abe Lincoln – but the dragging pace means the overall hit rate is down on even late-period Family Guy."
