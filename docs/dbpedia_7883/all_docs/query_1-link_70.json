        "text": "Seth MacFarlane plays Albert Stark, a sheep herder who hates life in the West, where there are oh so many ways to meet your end.\n\nOne thing makes his life bearable – the love of a pretty girl named Louise (Amanda Seyfried).\n\nBut after Albert talks his way out of a gunfight, Louise dumps him and lands in the arms of the wealthier Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), owner of the local mustache shop.\n\nAlbert is ready to give up life on the frontier and head to San Francisco when he rescues Anna (Charlize Theron) during a barroom brawl.\n\nShe befriends him and offers to pretend to be his girlfriend in order to make Louise jealous.\n\nAnd when Albert challenges Foy to a gunfight in a fit of rage, she offers to teach him to shoot.\n\nNaturally, after spending so much time together, they start to fall for one another.\n\nBut that could be dangerous for our mild-mannered sheep farmer.\n\nYou see, Anna has a secret. She’s the wife of Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), one of the most vicious outlaws in the West.\n\nAnd he’s asked her to take safe haven in the town of Old Stump to await his return from a planned holdup, not to fall into the arms of another man.\n\nReview:\n\nMacFarlane serves up some genuinely funny moments and he and the cast demonstrate how many bizarre ways there are to die in the West.\n\nWe get a great looking film. Heck, a large portion of it was shot in Monument Valley of John Ford fame.\n\nAnd the film features an excellent score, though it’s a shame we have to wait until the credits role to hear the clever title track.\n\nBut what we also get is an overabundance over sex jokes, drug jokes and excrement jokes. Heck, two characters – Albert’s best friend Edward and his prostitute girlfriend Ruth – seem to be included just for the sake of piling on more sex jokes.\n\nAnd if the excrement jokes haven’t grown tiresome before then, you’re very likely to scream, ‘OK, enough is enough’ when Albert and Foy finally engage in their “gunfight.”\n\nDirected by:\n\nSeth MacFarlane\n\nCast:\n\nSeth MacFarlane … Albert\n\nCharlize Theron … Anna\n\nAmanda Seyfried … Louise\n\nLiam Neeson … Clinch\n\nGiovanni Ribisi … Edward\n\nNeil Patrick Harris … Foy\n\nSarah Silverman … Ruth\n\nChristopher Hagen … George Stark\n\nWes Studi … Cochise\n\nMatt Clark … Old Prospector\n\nEvan Jones … Lewis\n\nAaron McPherson … Ben\n\nRex Linn … Sheriff/Narrator\n\nBrett Rickaby … Charlie Blanche\n\nAlex Borstein … Millie\n\nRuntime: 116 min.\n\nMemorable lines:\n\nEdward, as his friend Albert climbs in the saddle: “Hey, dude, you really shouldn’t drink and horse.”\n\nAlbert, explaining the dangers of the West to Anna : “Our old school marm got her throat slit by a fast-moving tumbleweed.”\n\nAlbert, once again bemoaning the danger of life in the West: “That is our Mayor. He is dead. He has been lying there dead for three days. No one has done a thing. Not moved him, not looked into his death, not even replaced him with a temporary appointee. For the last three days, the highest ranking official in our town, has been a dead guy.”\n\nTwo wolves appear and drag off the body.\n\nAlbert: “Oh, look at that. Look at that. Wolves are dragging the body away, as if to illustrate my point. Bye! Bye, Mr. Mayor. Bye, have fun becoming wolve’s shit.”\n\nAnna: “You’ve made something of yourself out here. A lot of people can’t say that. You’re a good sheep farmer.”\n\nAlbert: “Please. I suck at sheep. Louise was right. I can’t keep track of them. There was a sheep in the whorehouse last week.”\n\nAnna: “Really?”\n\nAlbert: “Yeah. Wandered in there. And when I went to pick it up, it had somehow made $20.”\n\nAnna to Louise: “How can you be so blind with eyes that big?”"
