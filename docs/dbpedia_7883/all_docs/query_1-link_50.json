        "text": "Seth MacFarlane wants to be a movie star in the worst way.\n\n“A Million Ways to Die in the West” is result of this longing, a\n\nlong/longer/longest comedy with long waits between jokes and longer waits\n\nbetween those that work.\n\nThus, does his leading man career begin and end with a “worst way” Western\n\nthat’s basically an excuse for a guy with zero screen presence to lock lips with\n\nOscar winner Charlize Theron.\n\nThe voice and creative mind behind the animated “Family Guy” and the\n\nhalf-animated “Ted” makes what is essentially a dirty-mouthed Don Knotts comedy,\n\na farce so lame it’s as if “Blazing Saddles” never happened or MacFarlane never\n\nsaw it.\n\nHe plays Albert, a timid sheep rancher in 1882 Old Stump Township, located in\n\nthe scenic Monument Valley of Arizona. His clumsiness with his sheep and his\n\ncowardice with the locals costs him his best girl (Amanda Seyfried). His pals\n\nEdward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Edward’s hooker-girlfriend Ruth (Sarah Silverman,\n\nof course) worry he’ll never get over that.\n\nAnd then Anna (Theron), the moll of a desperado (Liam Neeson) ducks into\n\ntown, laying low. She takes pity on the only guy in the Old West without a tan\n\n— Albert.\n\nThe running gag here is Albert’s profane irritation at all the ways you can\n\nget killed in the wild, careless, pre-antibiotic, pre OSHA, lawless, trigger\n\nhappy environment they all live in. That’s another reason Louise (Seyfried)\n\ndumps him."
