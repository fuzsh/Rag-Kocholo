        "text": "The Film\n\nThe Film A Million Ways to Die in the West was directed and written by famous comedian Seth MacFarlane and released May 15, 2014. This film was a call to Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles and early 1960 & 1970 Westerns with a modern spin on dialogue and topic. While the film was widely anticipated to be successful and the director was commended before release for stepping out and making an unconventional western comedy. Unfortunately, the reviews were at best mixed, if not overly critical of the writing, running time, and Seth MacFarlane’s debut on the movie screen. The complaints while varied were critical of the jokes, calling them toilet humor, head butting and bone crunching. But while the critics were largely mixed, if not negative, the movie saw success in the box office. While not reaching anticipated release goals the movie achieved 86.4 Million gross world-wide, making it to third place at the box office. While maybe not a Grammy award winning story of bravery and heroism, I think this movie was successful in the box offices, and with the audience it was aimed for. Seth Macfarlane has long been a provider of entertainment through time with Family Guy, and this was a live variation of stepping out of the box, but not going too far. The audience that loves Family Guy fell right in with this humor as well.\n\nI personally chose this film because I was able to watch it with my wife and laugh. We may not have always laughed at the same time, and she may have flinched a few more times than I did, but it was a fun, relaxing comedy- that threw in enough romance she was committed. On top of that both myself and my wife really enjoyed the movie because of the scenery and settings that were provided in the movie. My wife, being from Utah, we would often frequent the beautiful red rocks of Capitol Reed, Teasdale, and Tory, and watching this movie was like being transported back to the desert and fun. I really enjoyed this movie for its ability to catch the beauty of the land, but lighten it up with the plight of many pioneers that entered it when they founded the west.\n\nThe Screen Play\n\nThe screen play of this film was written by Seth MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin, and Wellesley Wild. It began as largely just a joke that slowly evolved into a project- then a movie. Seth Macfarlane a huge fan of old westerns and his fellow writers drew from old favorites such as Hang ‘Em High, Montana, 3:10 to Yuma, Oklahoma!, El Dorado, and more. The film is set around a despondent, depressed and recently dumped protagonist- Albert played by Seth. The show begins by highlighting him being dumped by his girlfriend who needs to “work on herself” but quickly is in a very committed relationship with For or Neil Patrick Harris. Down in his luck and hating the west Albert sets to move out to San Francisco when a new, pretty lady comes to town named Anna played by Charlize Theron. As a part of all westerns Albert has some continued unfortunate luck when Anna is in fact a married woman and her husband has come to town wanting to know who and what she has been kissing. This of course, in true western fashion, results in a hunt in which our loving protagonist wins after a run in with Indians, some opiate ingestion, a horse chase, and of course a tricky smooth play at the end to secure success. While this movie follows the typical setting of many western movies- what is not typical is its modern language, contemporary topics matters, and jokes- after joke, after joke, after joke.\n\nOne of the great things that the screenwriters ensured was that the contemporary played right along with the 19th century setting. They did so through the protagonists point of view, and observations. The dialogue and the set up of the movie allows the viewer to laugh at the quirks and absurdities of the time period without departing completely from the Western tradition.\n\nCamera Shot\n\nOne of the unique ways that Seth Macfarlane in directing this movie chose to use the camera can be seen on the chase of Albert by the raving mad husband of Anna. An example of one shot was when Albert was hiding in his sheep. The director started with a raised view of the sheep in the yard placing the camera at a high angle with not much detail, and not close up. It then transitioned the view lower as if at the level of a person standing in the yard looking around the yard and the group of the sheep. Then the camera angle abruptly changes to close into the groups of sheep to reveal a hiding Albert blending in by his hat and laying low. The angle quickly changes as Albert lays down and there is a close shot of the under side of the Sheep. This is just one of many examples of how camera angles were used to portray images, and help define the movie. The director makes use of wide pan angles during the horse chase, and close up angled shots on Albert’s face that are uncomfortable as he steps into the land of opiates and fantasy. Camera angles are used throughout this movie.\n\nTransition\n\nAfter Albert has accepted a shoot off challenge in a portion of the movie. Anna sets to training him on how to shoot and how to win. This entails multiple events of different kinds of practicing and development. In once instance the director shows Albert shooting bottles about 100 yards away. The director in this moment used a lot of different transitions. In the shooting of the bottles he used jump cuts which would automatically change to the actor moving up a few more feet, followed by more, and finally right next to the bottles. This practice and development segment of the movie also used the fade in fade out transition frequently as they moved from different locations, practicing different moves, and shooting different things. In one specific time the image faded out from day and turned into night where the actors were reflecting on their work.\n\nFoy- Supporting Actor\n\nNeil Patrick Harris plays city rich man and business entrepreneur Foy. Foy is the man who has stolen Albert’s woman, and is constantly degrading, him and ultimately challenging him to a shoot off. His behavior and acting is ostentatious, and rude. His character plays on the ever popular facial hair the moustache, and does everything in every way to challenge and undermine Albert in every way. Neil Patrick Harris known for being a great actor steps out in this role to be loud, brave, and extremely insulting (not just to Albert but everyone). He lends his talent to portray a stereotypical rich man looking for arm candy and trophies. His humor, acting, singing, and dancing ability allows him to play around with his jokes, and strike point home to Albert not just in word but also song & dance.\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West\n\nSymbolism\n\nThis movie while viewed as crass and slap stick actually is filled with symbolism for things in the old west. One of the most obvious uses of the symbolism, and a song created just by this movie, was the moustache. The men in the olden times, the men of the west treated their facial hair like a phallic symbol of power, control, money, and desirability. This is done in this movie once again as the protagonist is a put out down on his luck man who just was dumped by his girlfriend. His girlfriend then runs off to a popular and rich moustache wearing man, Foy, who is to a large extent a lot of Albert’s problem when feeling little and unworthy. Further this movie was crafted based on Western Classics. The sheep herding by Albert was inspired by the movie Montana, and the non-confrontational and average demeanor of Albert was picked because of the movie 3:10 to Yuma. Further, the multiple events of death that occur in this movie are symbolic of a book that directly discussed the west and how it grew by Jeff Guinn called The Last Gunfight: The real Story of the Shootout at the O.K. Corrale And How it Changed the American West.\n\nSound\n\nFoley artists were most definitely used in this movie to make give us as viewers a more realistic sound that we were expecting. In the movie there is a fair going on that Albert and Anna are walking around at. While there they stop and watch a photographer taking a picture of a couple. The equipment shoots up in flames and so does the photographer with a bang and fizz of fire and flash. The Foley artist when back and simulated a small explosion to give that sudden bang followed by the burning of material. Another example of this is when Albert was attempting to shoot bottles and when he could not he just knocked them over with his hand. This sound was also inserted and was done with multiple bottles to get the bang and break that we as viewers expected. Foley sound was used throughout this movie and in fact was also used as part of the humor. Foy’s sabotaged intestines growling was definitely inserted by a Foley artist later on.\n\nMusic\n\nIn this movie the original score was composed by Joel McNeely. The theme song a million ways to die was performed by artist Alan Jackson. Joel McNeely did the entire score for the movie to total 17 compositions. This included the theme song as well as al the music that goes along with the actions and events of the movie There is only one song that was added to the movie that was not composed by Joel McNeely and it was If You’ve Only Got A Moustache composed by Stephen Foster and performed by Amick Byram. This song was performed at the town dance, where Albert is left feeling little and worthless after a group of men sing the moustache song and dance him out of the room.\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West\n\nVisual Effects: Settings, Light, and Design\n\nThere were many different settings used in this movie. These include the high west outdoors where gang are running about, the town fair, the outskirts and sheep farm, the town brothel, and one of my favorites the town church displayed below. The town church from the outside was small, simple, white, and worn. It looked drab, and outdated. When you go inside that theme continued with the addition of traditional settings and stoic firm figures- either truly intrigued and guided or bored out of their mind by this forced tradition. I really enjoyed this setting because they used it to introduce Anna to the town and start the beginning of the intrigue and love story. What was great about this setting was also the use of light. The church is marked with a high ceiling and closed in walls that are partitioned by windows that are bringing in the light. While the church itself has lamps lit it is the light in their church that highlights the characters. In face when the bishop introduced Anna she is cast in light from the window that is very soft and illuminating almost making her appear angelic. The quality of the light here is very soft and has diffused shadows. This is in contrast to what the viewer saw before she appeared grim figures, and a depressed Albert who was not highlighted by a windows light but hidden in the shadows. The director used a low-key brightness here to support Albert’s underlying emotion of their scene- the light was – representing Albert’s dark mood. Once Anna appears scathed in light it moves to Albert who moves in his seat and raises up and is touched by the light at well. Not only directing of the movie, but symbolic with the setting and lighting.\n\nThe costumes of this movie a truly depictive of the era with a modem twist and humor added. An image that truly depicts this is the image below of Anna in a dress that the shop keeper found for her. The actors take the time to talk about its beauty as well as to make fun of the underlying cage that gives her so much ‘booty’. Seeing as this movie is a satire the actors take the time to lift the dress and reveal the heavy and metal cage. Albert takes the time to comment on how that cage may disappoint men for being misleading. But this is just one of many images of costumes used to mark the time of the movie and what is happening. When Albert is farming, or Anna is teaching him to shoot they are dressed down in more rugged clothes (while still using some modern materials) showing the relaxed nature of their work. Further the use of additional props on the costumes such as hats, umbrellas, pocket watches, and bill folds are great ways to show the time, but also open up the door for some humor.\n\nSpecial Effects\n\nThis movie is critiqued by its poor special effects but I think it is overly critiqued. The title of the movie is A Million Ways to Die in the West and while a million ways are not shown special effects are used to show quite a few. This includes a man being smashed by a large block of ice (and I mean smashed), a photographer blowing up after taking a picture, people in a picture catching on fire, and even a man selling herbal remedies being hit and killed by a bull. All of these involved special effects, animators, and some blood, gore, and fire. In addition to the ways one can die, special effects were used when Albert went on his opiate induced hallucination. While much of the background may have been real on his hallucination it moved in and out of reality and figment or cartoon. Additionally, as a part of the hallucination Albert sees a whole slew of sheep, with moustaches, singing and dancing to the despised If You Only Had a Moustache song. Not only can sheeps not do this, but the sheeps looked obviously digital as if to point out the level of the hallucination. In this move special effects really made the imagery work out and played the theme throughout the movie.\n\nResponse\n\nThis movie evokes a range of emotions like most movies, but it also evokes different emotions out of different people. While the overwhelming emotion is laughter and fun evoked, my wife said there was also happiness and love evoked as she viewed the corky prostitute couple, and watched on at Anna and Albert’s plight. For me, the emotions were fun, playful, and funny. The movie made me laugh and it made enjoy myself. While at times, this movie made me grimace in pain for the dying character, it was usually followed by a laugh at the ridiculousness of it and the all to likely reality of it back then. Overall, I would recommend this movie. If you are looking for a movie that is a call to the satirical westerns on the 60’s and 70’s and don’t want to take yourself to seriously, sit back, watch, laugh, and have fun. You may be so lucky as to be able to watch it with someone you like! Enjoy!\n\nCites\n\n1. “A Million Ways to Die in the West”. In Western Comedy.
