        "text": "If you went, or at least thought about going to see, Seth MacFarlane’s newest feature film, then statistically you are not expecting the smartest of comedies. Based on his past repertoire of animation, shorts, films and stand-ups, Seth MacFarlane is not looking to give out a million intelligent laughs, he is looking of a million ways to shock you using laughs! Whether it is by showing you dick-pics, using ‘almost-racist’ stereotypes you will feel uncomfortable laughing at, sex jokes that could have been written by 13 year-olds or slapstick comedy, MacFarlane is, to say the least, completely unapologetic whenever it comes to his own sense of humour. Even at the Oscars, his daring ‘Boob Song’ was not well received by everyone, though this reviewer right here thought it was hilarious! So really, if you don’t take A Million Ways to Die in the West at face-value, then you might end up being very disappointed. However, if you are prepared for silly, for Family Guy jokes or hundreds of nerdy references to films (westerns and others), then you will enjoy this.\n\nAlbert Stark (MacFarlane) lives on the frontier, in a town called Old Stump, where he spends his time badly herding sheep and loudly complaining about how deadly the West is. After being dumped by his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried), it gets even worse and he decides to leave for San Francisco. However, after a bar-brawl (that of course involves a few deaths), he meets Anna (Charlize Theron) who decides to take him under her wing and helps him man-up and gain the confidence he needs to win Louise back from her newest beau, moustached-douchebag Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). Supporting Albert in his quest are Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and his prostitute girlfriend Ruth (an underused Sarah Silverman). Little does Albert know that the greatest gunslinger in the territory, Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) and his posse are coming to town as well.\n\nMillion Ways seems to have the ultimate goal of de-romanticising the beloved Western genre and to an extent gets to it pretty effectively. Through Albert we get to know that the frontier is a disease-filled hellhole, a place where even the slightest misstep ends in either a wholly unnecessary gunfight, a diamond-back snake biting you, spontaneous combustion, routine medical check-ups or being attacked by the wildlife. The first 30 minutes where the story sets itself up, it is a delight to see every cliché from spaghetti Westerns, to John Wayne films to Blazing Saddles references get shot down, in a ‘set the record straight’ series of jokes. When Theron’s character arrives into town, MacFarlane also takes a stab at the training montage and saloon musical numbers done by other films. Some of the references might be a little better hidden than others but they all honour the original material and are used to excellent effect, clearly showing that MacFarlane does love the genre.\n\nAlbert’s character plays a modern-minded guy in a stereotypically idiotic town. At first he just strikes us as patronising and a little egotistical, until his girlfriend dumps him, which reduces him to a pathetic mess. While his dialogue is actually confident and hilarious, his character doesn’t get a backbone until Anna rides into town and finally validates his complaining by agreeing with most of his views. Both make a great comedy duo, bouncing one-liners off each other in much the same way done between John Bennet and Ted. If Albert would have acted on his own, he probably would have stayed unlikable till the end. Theron holds her own very well in scenes with MacFarlane, creating hilarious scenes together and bringing in Annie Oakley references and giving even more gravitas to her role, rather than just being a sidekick. The supporting cast also has some very good moments, especially Neeson and Harris, both who take their douchebag roles to heart. Neeson’s character is your typical bad guy gunslinger except for the small but meta added detail that he keeps his Irish accent. There is something amazingly funny about a cowboy saying ‘where’s your wee friend?’ in a backwards frontier town. Harris goes all out with a truly disgusting display of physical comedy, which by some miracle stills ends up being funny, though a little sickly. As for Ribisi and Silverman, though they have some nice moments, their jokes sadly remain the same throughout, without really contributing to the storyline.\n\nThis movie will make you laugh, absolutely no doubt about it. But while it’s witty modern dialogue manages to establish a line to your funny bone, it struggles to maintain it long enough for you to feel comfortable and just go with the jokes. Some scenes are just plain unecessary and are only there for…I don’t even know what reason, the whole theatre was probably wondering that as well. While MacFarlane and Theron share good chemistry to make their scenes emotional and funny, the rest of the cast seems to aimlessly coast by, waiting for Albert to do something so they have chance to even speak. Upon reflection, the story itself is lazy and uneven in pacing, especially one scene where a peyote-trip in involved, however the film surprisingly manages to keep you entertained long enough not to care anymore.\n\nSo yes, maybe Million Ways to Die in the West is a film best described as a ‘live action spin off of Family Guy‘ and while critics pan it, citing MacFarlane’s acting, writing or directing, there are enough jokes and references that justify a fully-fledged film. Expectations don’t have to be necessarily high for this film, though if you are familiar with MacFarlane’s humour, you know that he generally sticks to what he knows and what he knows if how to shock you! He is no Mel Brooks, or John Landis, but he is a nerd and since Hollywood has now been taken over by nerds and film fanatics, MacFarlane stays in his element, ventures just far enough with dick and fart jokes to make you go ‘eeeeewwwww’ and then brings it back, lets you breathe with some random story development and then starts again. Yes, some jokes might repeat themselves, but witty and fast dialogue keeps you focused. Not to mention the cameos, sprinkled everywhere, that literally had me screaming with surprise in the theatre, especially the last one!\n\nWhile not as good as Ted, this is still a fun film to see and upon second viewing will start developing a following with quotable lines and sing-alongs to an addictive song about moustaches!"
