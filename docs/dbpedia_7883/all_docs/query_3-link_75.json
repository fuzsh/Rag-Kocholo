        "text": "Joel McNeely has been tapped to score the upcoming western comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West. The film is directed by Seth MacFarlane who also stars in the film alongside Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried, Liam Neeson, Sarah Silverman, Giovanni Ribisi and Neil Patrick Harris. The movie follows a sheepish farmer who backs out of a gunfight and loses his girlfriend, who leaves him for another man. When a mysterious and beautiful woman rides into town, she helps him find his courage and they begin to fall in love. MacFarlane co-wrote the screenplay with Wellesley Wild & Alec Sulkin (Family Guy, Ted). Scott Stuber (Safe House, Identity Thief) and Jason Clark (Ted) are producing the project. McNeely whose previous scoring credits include The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Holes and Iron Will has previously scored numerous episodes of MacFarlane’s animated show American Dad and also produced and arranged the writer/director’s debut album Music Is Better Than Words. MacFarlane’s last feature Ted was scored by his other regular musical collaborator Walter Murphy. A Million Ways to Die in the West is set to be released on May 30, 2014 by Universal Pictures."
