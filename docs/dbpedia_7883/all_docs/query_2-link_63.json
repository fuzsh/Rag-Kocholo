        "text": "\" A Million reasons to keep Joel McNeely where he belongs \"\n\nWritten by Thomas Glorieux - Review of the download only release\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West is not only the Seth McFarlane comedy that couldn't compete with Ted's successful streak. It was more than ever the return of Joel McNeely to the film podium that he so successfully is entitled too. Too long has this composer been forgotten all the while other composers were given the opportunities of their lifetime and didn't fulfil them. Now there is a change in Hollywood land and hopefully one of the many returns of long forgotten composers. Because, by golly do we need their long forgotten voice!\n\nI love how the album opens, pure nostalgia to all those great western soundtracks out there. Funny lyrics, upbeat rhythms and a catchy musical melody. What more does one western need? Well the obligatory western theme. And may we receive just that in \"Main Title\", the bouncy playful ode to all the western composers and tunes out there. Not as memorable as the greats, but fun nonetheless. Buuya. What's fun and obligatory as well is the action. The fights, the horse chases. And McNeely makes ample use of the orchestra to make em fun and punchy. \"Saloon Brawl\" is a hoot in particular (putting the song theme through one stormy version).\n\nWhat's more? Overtures are fun, and in the case of McNeely memorable. Dancing delight in \"The Shooting Lesson\", delightful dancing in \"The Barn Dance\" and love themes blossom delicately in \"Anna and Albert\". Furthermore there's suspenseful detail in \"Clinch Hunts Albert\" that you rarely hear anymore, the same kind of detail as in \"Racing the Train\", pure unadulterated John Williams finesse, the kind you hear in \"Captured by Cochise\" as well as it tackles so many scores (Indiana Jones, Medal of Honor) that went before it. And do we have the send offs that define any good western in \"Sheep to the Horizon\" and \"End Title Suite\". It's all fun, it's all old fashioned scoring.\n\nIn general, I don't hear a lot of Joel McNeely in this one. I hear a lot of everyone else. But my god is it enjoyable. It's old fashioned music. Not just because it's a western sound. Because it's an old fashioned filmmusic voice you're hearing here. Detailed orchestral frivolity with themes and overlapping strings and brass. The kind that Vel√°zquez probably wanted to bring in Hercules but wasn't allowed to deliver. Thank god some directors still know what they want. A Million Ways to Die in the West is not special, but my god is it fun.\n\nFavorite Moment - Saloon Brawl (0.01 - 1.32)\n\nThe first action moment, and it's fun how the song theme suddenly becomes the exciting dominant force behind the rhythm\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
