        "text": "Not my cup of tea\n\nI used to be a big fan of Seth McFarlane and Family Guy. I thought I might enjoy this story even though I never took the time to see the movie. It was part of a 2 for 1 credit, so I decided to give it a chance. There were parts that were funny, but it didn't really connect with me. It seems to be better suited for teenage boys. I guess I'm just not part of that audience anymore. I need to go now so I can get another Werther's Original and go tell at those damn kids to get off my grass.\n\nFunnier then the movie.\n\nWhere does Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West rank among all the audiobooks you’ve listened to so far?\n\nAs I have not been here long, I do not have much to measure by but on it our, it ranks highest.\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nI loved the main character, He reminds me of myself. As if I was the main character.\n\nWhat does Jonathan Frakes bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nJonathan Frakes gave each character a 'voice'. He brought each one to life.\n\nIf you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?\n\nKnowing this book was written after he movie, I think Seth already has that covered.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI honestly think this book was more entertaining then the movie. There is a level of details included in the book that make it great.\n\nHuge Laughs, Greatest Girlfriend Ever!\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nYes. This book is essential reading for all humans interested in any / all of the following:\n\n1. spending an enjoyable 5 hrs listening to a funny story; 2. laughing when a humorous scene unfolds - and my unofficial count came to 32 give or take a couple; and 3. rooting for the underdog character reeling from the blows but staying strong and sliding into a relationship upgrade before the curtain falls.\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nThe girlfriend of Albert's best friend. Where to begin? No joke - get this audiobook and let her world wash over you like a sticky spatter of love. What a woman! She is a hard working young lady absolutely dedicated to providing her diverse, loyal customer base 100% guaranteed satisfaction. Her front door, back door, even the upstairs window are always open. She will bend over backwards, even get on her knees to please her clients.\n\nWith all of this said, don't forget that she is also deeply in love with Edward, her not-so-worldly shoe repairing boyfriend. Their love is the love that lasts through all time. Edward is a lucky man to have her by his side.\n\nWhat does Jonathan Frakes bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nHe narrated this audiobook cleanly and mixed in some well done voices for the diverse cast of characters.\n\nWas there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?\n\nI was particularly touched in the scene where Edward shows up at his girlfriend's work a bit early before she is done for the day in order to surprise her. He has to wait a few minutes becausesShe is getting drilled hard by one of her customers. When he hears her soft rhythmic moaning subside and then her begging for her cowboy to cum in her mouth, he knew it wouldn't be long before she would walk down those stairs and into his loving arms. Their embrace in the lobby was as tender a moment as I can ever recall. Love IS a wonderous thing!\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nBuy this audiobook! A wonderful way to spend an afternoon. If you don't find this book funny, then you are not the answer, you are the problem!\n\nHey Seth, hope there is more stuff like this in that dome of yours. This is my kind of out of left field, bust up laughing book so rarely offered by Audible these days. Keep pumping out the good stuff, and I will keep coughing up the jack to buy it."
