        "text": "After an agonizingly long opening title sequence, viewers are introduced to a sheep farmer named Albert (Seth MacFarlane, Family Guy), who has seen better days. After pleading for his life in a gun fight, his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried, Veronica Mars) decides to end their relationship. Albert soon learns that there is more to the breakup than meets the eye, as Louise has actually started seeing Foy (Neil Patrick Harris, How I Met Your Mother), the owner of the Moustachery! With this new revelation at hand, Albert heads out drinking with his friends Ruth (Sarah Silverman, Wreck-It Ralph) and Edward (Giovanni Ribisi, Avatar), where they discuss everything wrong with the time that they live in. Albert proclaims that anything and everything in the West can and will kill you, and after an amazingly detailed monologue, a bar fight ensues. When a pretty girl named Anna (Charlize Theron, Aeon Flux) is about to be injured during the fight, Albert’s quick thinking saves her life. The two hit it off and become instant friends, and Anna decides to help Albert win his girl back. As if Albert didn’t have enough to deal with, he must also face off against the gunman known as Clinch (Liam Neeson, Non-Stop), who also happens to be Anna’s husband!\n\nIn terms of the cast, MacFarlane and Theron actually play very well off each other. NPH gets some zingers in as Foy (listen closely for a How I Met Your Mother line worked in). Silverman and Ribisi are extremely entertaining to watch as they awkwardly deal with religion and life in the Old West. I would never want to mess with Liam Neeson in real life, but I would especially want to avoid a gun fight with him."
