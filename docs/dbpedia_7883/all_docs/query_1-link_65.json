        "text": "This year marks the 40th anniversary of the classic Old West parody \"Blazing Saddles.\"\n\nI mention this because if you want to see an Old West parody, you should rent or stream Mel Brooks' subversive comedy and avoid \"A Million Ways to Die in the West,\" Seth MacFarlane's lame attempt to skewer the same conventions Brooks made fun of two generations ago. The creator of \"The Family Guy\" wrote, directs and stars in the film.\n\nThe timing of MacFarlane's film is odd. When Brooks made \"Blazing Saddles,\" Westerns were still a staple of Hollywood studios, albeit a fading genre. John Wayne was still alive and Clint Eastwood had just hung up his cowboy hat for a San Francisco police badge. It was as if Brooks was putting the final nail in Hollywood's Western genre. In contrast, \"A Million Ways\" seems like a relic from another era, making fun of a genre that hasn't had cultural resonance since, well, Richard Nixon was in office.\n\nMacFarlane could have got a pass on this cultural disconnect if \"A Million Ways\" was funny, but for the most part it isn't. MacFarlane does get some laughs depicting how horrible life was in the Old West, pointing out all the gruesome ways people could die, but even that running joke wears thin.\n\nThe rest of the film is full of tiresome material about various body fluids and sex acts. You'll get to see the unpleasant sight of Neil Patrick Harris defecating into a hat and MacFarlane getting peed on by a sheep. Oh, and for some reason the sight of Amanda Seyfried sucking on Harris' mustache (don't ask) made me turn away from the screen in disgust.\n\nMacFarlane plays meek sheep farmer Albert, who falls in love with Anna (Charlize Theron), a newcomer to town. Unfortunately for Albert, Anna is married to the murderous outlaw Clinch (Liam Neeson), who unsurprisingly is a jealous guy.\n\nThrown into the mix is Albert's best friend (Giovanni Ribisi), who is dating a prostitute (Sarah Silverman) and Albert's ex-girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) who dumped him in favor of a dude (Harris) with an elaborate mustache. None of the characters are interesting or funny, unless you count anal sex jokes funny.\n\nAll of MacFarlane's characters pale in comparison to Brooks' stable of comic characters in \"Blazing Saddles.\" You'll be wanting an appearance by Mongo, Hedley Lamarr or Lili Von Shtupp after the house lights go up on \"Million Ways.\"\n\nWhat really kills the film, though, is MacFarlane's performance. In the lead role, he's both smarmy and flat, not a good combination. You never understand why Theron's Anna would be attracted to Albert and it doesn't help that the two actors don't have much screen chemistry together.\n\nProblematic, too, is the pacing of the film. The movie lurches from one skit to another, never building any comic momentum. It's as if MacFarlane had 30 minutes of comic material and stretched it into a two-hour movie. At one point he even stops the movie to throw in a comic aside about \"Back to the Future Part III,\" the least memorable film in the time-traveling series. Talk about scraping the bottom of the comedic barrel.\n\nIt's too bad, because MacFarlane proved with the profane but heartfelt \"Ted\" he could make a movie with laughs and heart. Let's hope \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" is just a road bump in his career. Oh, and let's hope MacFarlane leaves Brooks' film resume alone. No one needs a lame remake of \"Young Frankenstein,\" thank you very much.\n\n'A Million Ways to Die in the West'\n\nNow playing\n\n: Century 14 Northridge Mall, Maya Cinemas Salinas 14\n\nMPAA rating\n\n: R for strong crude and sexual content, language throughout, some violence and drug material\n\nFilm facts:\n\nStars Seth MacFarlane, Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Sarah Silverman, Giovanni Ribisi and Neil Patrick Harris. 116 minutes.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\n: MacFarlane's Old West parody feels like a pale remake of \"Blazing Saddles,\" only without the subversive comic material. It's crude, unfunny and sluggish. Skip it."
