        "text": "That title’s not kidding, huh? The Old West was hard, especially wherever Seth MacFarlane went/wrote/directed/starred. It also featured the most F-bombs ever, as evidenced in Deadwood and now this (even if sometimes they were kinda trying-too-hard-to-be-provocative F-bombs). MacFarlane’s Ted follow-up will costar Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Sarah Silverman, Giovanni Ribisi, and Neil Patrick Harris. There better be a Back to the Future Part III nod somewhere in there.\n\nSay good-bye to the rest of your day/night/week: You can now play with Legos using Google Chrome. [via]\n\nA day after we learned Captain America 3 is a go, Thor 3 is also definitely happening. Marvel comics writer Craig Kyle, who worked as a producer on the first two Thors, will step up to write the script.\n\nKnock knock. Who’s there? FIFTEEN NEW GAME OF THRONES SEASON 4 PICS!\n\nWhat you didn’t know about Taylor Swift’s “headbanging” at the Grammys:\n\nSpeaking of the Grammys, conspiracy theory alert: Daft Punk were actually in the audience, outside their robosuits, just chilling in civilian clothes. Maybe.\n\nA Seinfeld reunion is being sneakily discussed. Someone shoot those guys a reminder that Season 7 of Curb Your Enthusiasm exists.\n\nSpeaking of Jerry: Here’s Tina Fey on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHiCOIjpp-4\n\nJoss Whedon on The Avengers: Age of Ultron: “The model I’m always trying to build from, or my guiding star, is The Godfather: Part II, where a ton has happened in between and it’s a very different movie, but you don’t need any information. It’s there in the film about what’s happened since, what’s different, and why is this a different film; why is it a different kind of structure, and why is it darker? It’s all there, you’re in the vernacular of the first movie and you’re just ready to pick up in this new place, and hopefully that’s what will happen with my movie.”\n\nCheck out Lorne Michaels’s desk.\n\nAgainst Me! did “Fuckmylife666” on Letterman.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TyN3y36WA\n\nDallas Buyers Club, Orange Is the New Black, and Blue Is the Warmest Color are among the 25th-annual GLAAD Media Awards nominees.\n\nMeg Ryan will make her directorial debut with Ithaca, which old buddy Tom Hanks will executive produce. It takes place in California in 1942 and follows a 14-year-old bike messenger whose brother is fighting in World War II while the boy looks after his siblings and his widowed mother."
