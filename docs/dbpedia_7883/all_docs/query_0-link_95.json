        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (April 29, 2014) –Alan Jackson has recorded “A Million Ways to Die,” the title track from Universal Pictures and MRC’s upcoming comedy, A Million Ways to Die in the West, on the forthcoming Original Motion Picture Soundtrack for the film. The movie features a score by Emmy Award-winning composer and conductor Joel McNeely, along with the new song sung by Jackson and written by McNeely and Seth MacFarlane, the film’s director, producer, co-writer and co-star. MacFarlane, the creative force behind the 2012 blockbuster Ted and TV’s Family Guy, personally approached Jackson to record the song for the film and its soundtrack. “A Million Ways to Die” debuted yesterday exclusively on www.ew.com and is available digitally today on Back Lot Music, with the album’s release to follow on May 27, both physically and digitally. The film arrives in theaters on May 30.\n\nMacFarlane plays the role of the cowardly sheep farmer Albert in A Million Ways to Die in the West. After Albert backs out of a gunfight, his fickle girlfriend leaves him for another man. When a mysterious and beautiful woman rides into town, she helps him find his courage and they begin to fall in love. But when her husband, a notorious outlaw, arrives seeking revenge, the farmer must put his newfound courage to the test. Starring alongside MacFarlane in the film are Oscar® winner Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman and Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nwww.amillionways.com"
