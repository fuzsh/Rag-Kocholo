I assume you mean the HTML Content.

If so, follow this Link: https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/read-content-from-html-to-string.19408/#post-111864

Thanks for your answer...

i'm try a get data from javascript inside in html....

B4X:

<script> $(document).ready(function(){ $.post("https://xxx.xxx", { client_name: 123, user_id: 1, invoice_group_id: 1 }, function(data) { var response = JSON.parse(data); if (response.success == '1') { document.getElementById("invoiceid").innerHTML = response.invoice_id; } }); }); </script> <p id="invoiceid"></p>

but, only get a html string, dont get result

You will need to set up a Javascript Interface. With that, you can call JS functions from B4A and call B4A Subs from JS. It's the same functionality.

Just use the search function and youll find some good tutorials on how to do that. If you have any further questions to that, feel free to ask me, im using JS interfaces very often.
