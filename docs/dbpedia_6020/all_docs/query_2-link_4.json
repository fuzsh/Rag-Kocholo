        "text": "Regional play-by-play radio network\n\nThe Titans Radio Network is an American radio network composed of 42 radio stations which carry English-language coverage of the Tennessee Titans, a professional football team in the National Football League (NFL).\n\nNashville market station WGFX (104.5 FM) serves as the network's flagship station. The network also includes 41 affiliates in the U.S. states of Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama, along with nearby areas of Mississippi, eastern Arkansas, and far southern Illinois: twenty-two AM stations, sixteen of which supplement their signals with a low-power FM translator; and nineteen full-power FM stations, one of which supplements its signal with a low-power FM translator.\n\nIn addition to traditional over-the-air AM and FM broadcasts, network programming airs on satellite radio via Sirius XM and is available online via Sirius XM, TuneIn and NFL+.[1][2][3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the Houston Oilers Radio Network (1960–1996)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe radio network began with the 1960 American Football League season as the Houston Oilers Radio Network, when the now-Tennessee Titans were based in Houston, Texas, and were known as the Oilers. Houston's KXYZ was the first flagship of the network for 1960 through 1963. KILT was the network's second flagship station from 1963 to 1975.[4] In the beginning, Majestic Advertising of Milwaukee, Wisconsin was the holder of production rights to the radio broadcasts and pre-season TV broadcasts. In the 1970s and beyond, the network was operated by the Texas State Networks, which also produces their own radio news programs, along with agricultural news updates to their affiliated stations statewide.[5]\n\nKODA took over as the flagship station from 1985 through 1990. KTRH, which was the network flagship from 1976[6] to 1984, returned to be the flagship for the network for the franchise's final five seasons in Houston from 1991 until the end of the 1996 season. Around 35 to 40 (and at one point 86) stations broadcast all pre-season and regular season games each season, along with any playoff appearance the Oilers had during its time in Houston, including their AFC Championship Game appearances in 1978 and 1979. At one point during this time period after the mid 1980s, KQQK served as the flagship for the team's Spanish-language broadcasts in Houston.\n\nDuring the team's final season in Houston, which was a disastrous turnout for the team in 1996, and in preparation for the team's move to their then-new headquarters in Nashville one year earlier than expected, the Oiler Radio Network was reduced from many affiliates across most of Texas and western Louisiana to only the flagship station in Houston, and a few affiliates in Tennessee, including its future flagship, then-Adult contemporary-formatted WGFX of Nashville (officially licensed to Gallatin). In October 1996, KTRH cut off games in favor of preseason basketball involving the Houston Rockets of the NBA.[7]\n\nAs the Tennessee Oilers Radio Network and Titans Radio (1997–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was renamed the Tennessee Oilers Radio Network in 1997 during the team's first season in Tennessee. The headquarters were now located in Nashville, but their home games were played in the Liberty Bowl in Memphis in 1997 and the Vanderbilt University's Stadium in 1998 and at least until their new stadium, the Adelphia Coliseum (now Nissan Stadium) was completed in August 1999. WGFX became the flagship station for the network, and served as flagship from 1997 until the completion of the 2001 season, although WGFX served as an \"affiliate\" for the 2004 season. Between the team's initial relocation and the start of the 1999 preseason, the radio network was spread to many radio stations across Tennessee, as well as southern and western Kentucky, northern and central Alabama, and portions of three other states. Titans Radio signed up over 50 affiliates in non-metro areas and a few major cities.\n\nIn Spring 1999, the radio network's name was changed to the Titans Radio Network to reflect the team's name change. The Titans Radio name was first used in the Titans first pre-season game in August 1999. Country-music formatted station WKDF, now one of WGFX's in-market sister stations, became the new flagship station in 2002. WGFX, which became a sports talk radio station in 2003, returned as the flagship for the Titans Radio Network starting with the 2010 season.\n\nThe team had long refused distribution of these radio broadcasts to Sirius XM, because the Titans' contract with Citadel Broadcasting (then-parent of both WKDF and WGFX) predated the arrival of satellite radio.[8][9] However, in 2011, the Titans extend their agreement with existing radio partners while a provision allowing home games to be broadcast on Sirius XM. The Titans became the last NFL franchise to reach such a deal.[10]\n\nOn-air radio personalities\n\n[edit]\n\nHere is a list of the current personnel of the Titans Radio Network:\n\nMike Keith — play by-play announcer, \"The Voice of the Titans\", well known for his trademark touchdown call, \"Touchdown Titans!\" [11]\n\nDave McGinnis — Color Analyst [11]\n\nJohnathan Hutton — Sideline reporter[11][12]\n\nRhett Bryan – Gameday host\n\nKevin Dyson – Pre-game/Post-game analyst\n\nBlaine Bishop - Pre-game/Post-game analyst[13]\n\nProgramming outside live game coverage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mike Vrabel Show—Tuesdays at 6:00 PM CT\n\nTitans Tonight With Keith Bullock—Thursdays at 6:00 PM CT\n\nTitans Countdown – pre-game show, one hour prior to kickoff\n\nStation list\n\n[edit]\n\nNetwork stations as of the 2022 Tennessee Titans season[14] Callsign Frequency Band City State Network status WGFX 104.5 FM Nashville Tennessee Flagship WVNN 770 AM Athens Alabama Affiliate WCBL 1290 AM Benton Kentucky WCBL-FM simulcast WJOX-FM 94.5 FM Birmingham Alabama Affiliate WJTW 1480 AM Bridgeport Alabama Affiliate WXSM 640 AM Bristol Tennessee Affiliate WKDZ-FM 106.5 FM Cadiz Kentucky Affiliate WCLE-FM 104.1 FM Calhoun–Cleveland–Athens Tennessee Affiliate WRJB 95.9 FM Camden Tennessee Affiliate W259BN 99.7 FM Camden Tennessee WRJB relay WGOW 1150 AM Chattanooga Tennessee Affiliate W239CO 95.7 FM Chattanooga Tennessee WJTW relay WGOW-FM 102.3 FM Chattanooga Tennessee Affiliate WKFN 540 AM Clarksville Tennessee Affiliate WAIN 1270 AM Columbia Kentucky Affiliate W270DI 101.9 FM Columbia Kentucky WAIN relay WMCP 1280 AM Columbia Tennessee Affiliate W255DK 98.9 FM Columbia Tennessee WMCP relay WKXD-FM 106.9 FM Cookeville Tennessee Affiliate WYTM-FM 105.5 FM Fayetteville Tennessee Affiliate WQLT-FM 107.3 FM Florence Alabama Affiliate WHEP 1310 AM Foley Alabama Affiliate W223AX 92.5 FM Foley Alabama WHEP relay WAKM 950 AM Franklin Tennessee Affiliate WCBL-FM 99.1 FM Grand Rivers Kentucky Affiliate WPTQ 105.3 FM Glasgow Kentucky Affiliate WIKQ 103.1 FM Greeneville Tennessee Affiliate WSON 860 AM Henderson Kentucky Affiliate W300ED 107.9 FM Henderson Kentucky WSON relay W261BV 100.1 FM Hopkinsville Kentucky WKFN relay WZDQ 102.3 FM Humboldt–Jackson Tennessee Affiliate WOKI 98.7 FM Knoxville Tennessee Affiliate WCOR 1490 AM Lebanon Tennessee Affiliate WANT 98.9 FM Lebanon Tennessee WCOR simulcast WJJM-FM 94.3 FM Lewisburg Tennessee Affiliate WUMP 730 AM Madison–Huntsville Alabama Affiliate W280BA 103.9 FM Madison–Huntsville Alabama WUMP relay WMSR 1320 AM Manchester Tennessee Affiliate W300BL 107.9 FM Manchester Tennessee WMSR relay WAKI 1230 AM McMinnville Tennessee Affiliate W221ED 92.1 FM McMinnville Tennessee WAKI relay WKIM 98.9 FM Memphis Tennessee Affiliate WCRK 1150 AM Morristown Tennessee Affiliate W289BQ 105.7 FM Morristown Tennessee WCRK relay WVJS 1420 AM Owensboro Kentucky Affiliate W225CL 92.9 FM Owensboro Kentucky WVJS relay WPAD 1560 AM Paducah Kentucky Affiliate W258AN 99.5 FM Paducah Kentucky WPAD relay WWKY-FM 104.9 FM Princeton Kentucky Affiliate WKSR 1150 AM Pulaski Tennessee Affiliate W265AQ 100.9 FM Pulaski Tennessee WKSR relay W299CW 107.7 FM Pulaski Tennessee WKSR relay WWIC 1050 AM Scottsboro Alabama Affiliate W243CU 96.5 FM Sebree Kentucky WSON relay WVNN-FM 92.5 FM Trinity–Huntsville Alabama WVNN simulcast W294CV 106.7 FM Tullahoma Tennessee WMSR relay WQAK 105.7 FM Union City Tennessee Affiliate WQMV 1060 AM Waverly Tennessee Affiliate W228DG 93.5 FM Waverly Tennessee WQMV relay WCDT 1340 AM Winchester Tennessee Affiliate\n\nBlue background indicates low-power FM translator.\n\nGray background indicates station is a simulcast of another station.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nWGFX\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nHistory of the Houston Oilers\n\nHistory of the Tennessee Titans\n\nList of Tennessee Titans broadcasters\n\nTitans All Access\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
