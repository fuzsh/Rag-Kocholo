        "text": "Pump up the volume! This is one if from the file marked “Duh.” Science has just proved what anyone who has ever ridden an elliptical machine hard has long known. A tough workout feels a whole lot easier if you are blasting some music that you love. It doesn’t really matter if it’s Taylor Swift or Fela, if it makes you feel good, it takes the edge off.\n\nAs Time reports, in a new study by Texas University, people who listened to music during a cardiac stress test were able to sweat it out for almost a minute longer than those who didn’t. The study, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, will be presented at the American College of Cardiology’s annual meeting and scientists are saying it is proof that tunes boost our tolerance for intense exercise.\n\n“At least on a small scale, this study provides some evidence that music may help serve as an extra tool to help motivate someone to exercise more—which is critical to heart health,” said lead author Dr. Waseem Shami, a cardiology fellow at Texas Tech University Health Sciences, in a press release noted by Time.\n\nThe study examined 127 people, all of whom had already been scheduled for a treadmill stress test. Half the people were tapped to listen to Latin-inspired, up-tempo music while the other half simply walked in silence. All of the participants wore headphones to prevent the researchers from knowing who was in which group (not to mention singing along!).\n\nThe bottom line: researchers found that people who listened to music stuck with the test for an average of 8 minutes and 26 seconds, compared to an average of 7 minutes and 35 seconds for the no-music group. As Time noted, quoting Shami: “After six minutes, you feel like you are running up a mountain, so even being able to go 50 seconds longer means a lot.”\n\nIn related news, recent studies have also suggested that if you flash your pearly whites during a hard workout, you might also see better results. A new study published the Psychology of Sport and Exercise, shows that smiling may enhance athletic performance. Researchers suggest smiling gooses performance because it encourages a “reduction in muscular tension.” Relaxation may be the secret.\n\nHey, could that be related? Better turn up whatever music always makes you smile. Now excuse me while I go find some disco (don’t judge!)."
