In a year where Stad Sint-Niklaas is launching its #teamSintNiklaas campaign, SBE is excited to create moments of connection beyond the office walls. Following a fierce KUBB tournament with 50 colleagues, winners Ronny Thomaes and Christophe Platinck received a special surprise: the chance to compete against the Kubbezen (André and Polle), a professional KUBB team and bronze medalists at the 2018 European Championships in SWITZERLAND. 🏆 👏🙌 👌 Despite the loud encouragement and frenzied atmosphere from #teamSBE on the sidelines, the Kubbezen drew the longest straw. But no harm done, it was a beautiful day for the love of sports! #greatplacetowork\n\nSustainability is at the heart of our growth. We’re thrilled to be recognized by Voka - Kamer van Koophandel Antwerpen-Waasland with the Voka Charter on Sustainable Entrepreneurship certificate, alongside 36 other forward-thinking companies.
