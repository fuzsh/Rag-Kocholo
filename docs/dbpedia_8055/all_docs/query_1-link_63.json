        "text": "From 1966 to 2009, UNDP supported the people and Government of Korea on their unique development path, delivering over 270 projects with a total budget of $107 million, covering areas such as rural development, water management, industrial development, environmental protection, and social development, with skills development as a cross-cutting theme.\n\nIn 2009, UNDP closed its Country Office as Korea joined the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), affirming its status as a developed economy and a significant contributor of development aid. In 2011, the UNDP Seoul Policy Centre (USPC) commenced its operations, and a new form of cooperation began between the Republic of Korea and UNDP, with USPC sharing Korea’s development experience with other developing countries.\n\nThe five-decade-partnership between Korea and UNDP is summarized in the book, “The Republic of Korea and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)” published in 2009 by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. The book reviews and highlights UNDP's activities and achievements in Korea’s development.\n\nView here\n\nAbout UNDP\n\nAs the United Nations lead agency on international development, UNDP works in 170 countries and territories to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality. We help countries to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities, and to build resilience to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAbout the Centre\n\nThe UNDP Seoul Policy Centre is an integral part of the Global Policy Network of UNDP. It is co-funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea and UNDP, and hosted by Korea University. UNDP’s six global policy centres are located in different parts of the world with different mandates."
