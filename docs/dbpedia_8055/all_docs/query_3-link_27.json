        "text": "The Taebaeksan Mountain Range forms the backbone of the peninsula, with the eastern part of the range rising higher than the western part. Rivers, both small and large, originate from the high mountainous areas in the east and flow toward the West and South Seas, forming plains suitable for grain cultivation.\n\nThe climate created by the mountainous areas in the east has an impact on people’s lives. The easterly wind’s passage across the mountainous areas is subject to the Foehn effect, creating a warm and dry wind in the western downwind side of the mountain range. People living in the areas to the east of the high mountains experience considerable inconveniences with regard to transportation, as these areas have undergone very little development compared to the area to the west of the high mountains. However, the slow pace of development has brought at least one advantage to local residents: the natural scenery has remained unspoiled, and many people now choose these areas as travel destinations.\n\nThe East Sea has a relatively straight, featureless coastline, and the difference between high and low tide is only 30 cm. However, the sea along the coast is generally deeper than 1,000 m. According to the result of a sonar measurement carried out by the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency, the deepest part of the East Sea lies in the area north of Ulleungdo Island (2,985 m deep). In contrast, the sea along the West Sea is shallow, which has led to the formation of wide tidal flats.\n\nDuring the summer holiday season, Haeundae Beach in Busan attracts around 1 million visitors per day. Gyeongpodae Beach in Gangneung and Daecheon Beach on the West Sea are also popular holiday destinations during the summer.\n\nIn winter, people enjoy skating and skiing across the country. There are many ski slopes in Gangwon-do. Winter snowfall in the mountainous areas of Gangwon-do sometimes reaches 50–60 cm in a day or two. The average daytime temperature in spring and fall is maintained at 15˚C–18˚C. In these seasons, the sky is clear and the weather is pleasant and agreeable, encouraging many people to engage in outdoor activities or go on a trip.\n\nRecently, the Korean Peninsula has shown signs of transition to a subtropical climate amid the phenomenon of global warming. In summer, the temperature rises above 35˚C. In spring, azaleas and forsythias bloom earlier than in the past. Over the past 4–5 years, many new and extraordinary climate-related records have been reported.\n\nSummer heat waves have become more common, and precipitation patterns are also changing. During the monsoon seasons in the past, rain used to fall nationwide because of the influence of a wet front. Today, torrential downpours, which bring rain to a concentrated area, are often observed. In winter, heavy snow also tends to fall in concentrated regions. Only 10 years ago, it was usual for cold and warm weather to succeed each other on the peninsula every three or four days, but that pattern has almost completely disappeared as well.\n\nPopulation\n\nArchaeologists think that people started settling in the Korean Peninsula around 700,000 BCE during the Paleolithic Age. South Korea’s 2019 population was estimated at 51.71 million, and according to the 2018 Population and Housing Census, 49.8% of the population resided in the Seoul metropolitan area. This was up by 0.7% from 49.1% in 2010, showing a distinct trend toward the concentration of the population in the capital.\n\nMeanwhile, the country’s low birth rate has emerged as a serious social problem. In 2019, the total fertility rate, meaning the average number of childbirths by fertile women, stood at 0.92, with the number of newborns reaching 3,02,700, all of which were the lowest ever recorded. Meanwhile, the life expectancy of South Koreans reached 82.7 years (as of 2018), higher than the OECD average (80.7 years).\n\nThe international migration of South Koreans began at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century, with people leaving for China and Russia. Around the mid-20th century, after the 1945 Liberation of Korea, the United States was their main destination, though Koreans also started to emigrate to diverse regions around the world including Europe, the Middle East, and South America. As a result, the number of overseas South Koreans amounted to 7.49. million (2019). Statistics showed that the largest number of Korean expatriates was in the United States (2.54 million), followed by China (2.46 million), and Japan (820,000).\n\nSince 2011, the net inflow of population has outnumbered the net outflow. The number of foreign nationals residing or working in the country has increased dramatically, particularly since 2000. Despite fluctuations every year, the number of inflows of foreign nationals has been increasing as a whole. According to Statistics Korea, the number of foreigners entering Korea reached 293,000 in 2010, 373,000 in 2015, and 438,000 in 2019, respectively. With respect to the purposes of their entry into the country, a short-term stay (34.5%) topped the list, followed by employment (26%), study (14.9%), and arrivals of overseas Koreans (12%). Although not included in the major rankings, the number of people entering the country because of permanent residence and marriage increased by 7.7% year on year (as of 2019).\n\nLanguage and Letters\n\nKorea has a unique language and its own writing system, “Hangeul,” which was invented by King Sejong (1397–1450) during the Joseon dynasty. Koreans are very proud of this remarkable achievement. Hangeul is a very efficient and easy script to learn and use, and most of all, its promulgation was exactly recorded, which is unique in the world.\n\nHangeul is composed of 14 consonant letters (ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ) and 10 vowel letters (ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ). It can express virtually all the sounds produced by nature and humans. Every year, UNESCO presents the King Sejong Literacy Prize to people who have made a distinguished contribution to the elimination of illiteracy. The inclusion of “King Sejong” in the name of the prize may be said to be a tacit recognition of his greatest accomplishment, the creation of Hangeul, which is easy to learn and use.\n\nKorean Social Security System\n\nSouth Korea operates a labor and welfare system that meets international norms. It guarantees the three basic rights of labor. Public officials also have their basic rights guaranteed as workers despite some restrictions on their right to collective action.\n\nIn 1988, the country adopted the minimum wage system, whose purpose is to protect the rights and interests of workers. There has been a gradual increase in the statutory minimum wage, and the hourly minimum wage for 2020 was set at KRW 8,590. Other relevant acts have been enforced, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity and Work-Family Balance Assistance Act, which realizes equal employment for both genders by guaranteeing equal opportunities and treatment in employment between men and women, in addition to the mandatory employment quota for people with disabilities, which requires companies to hire workers with disabilities above a certain rate.\n\nIn addition, social insurance schemes are carried out against contingencies relating to disaster, disease, unemployment, and death. Workers are covered by industrial accident compensation insurance against work-related accidents, diseases, or deaths. All of the people shall be covered by national health insurance.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, 51 million people or 98.6% of the entire population enjoyed the benefits provided under the state-run national health insurance system. The Korean national health-care system, which provides a high-quality medical service for reasonable service fees, has been appraised as an exemplary case by other countries.\n\nWorkers are covered by employment insurance. When an insured worker is dismissed voluntarily, he/she is entitled to half of his/her wage for a given period and to job transfer training. Workers are also subject to retirement pension and national pension plans.\n\nIn addition, workers are entitled to take partially paid parental leave for one year. Pregnant employees are eligible for 90 days of maternity leave before and after giving birth. Male employees are also allowed to request paternity and child care leave in relation to their child’s birth and child rearing.\n\nElementary students are provided with the Dolbom (care) class service. The whole-day care program is to be expanded to all elementary school grades.\n\nWith an increasing number of senior citizens, welfare for the elderly has emerged as an important social issue.
