        "text": "Notification of Incorrect Certification of Origin (Decertification)\n\nIf you have filled out a certification of origin but cannot substantiate the originating status of the goods therein, you are required to notify all recipients of said certification and the country of export. Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Instructions This document provides the most relevant information in HTSUS General Notes 33 and 19 CFR Subpart R. Certification of Origin Template Any claim for preferences under the Korea Free Trade Agreement must be supported by a Certificate of Origin attesting to the imported product’s originating status. This link provides a PDF template demonstrating how such a Certificate of Origin can be structured. The template is fillable, and users may elect to use it. Its use, or adherence to its structure, is in no way compulsory. Nevertheless, pursuant to the relevant regulations, all of the data elements specified therein must still be provided upon request to CBP in connection with a claim for preferential tariff treatment. Data Elements for the Korea FTA Certificate of Origin - 19 CFR 10.1004 As an alternate to the Certification of Origin template, a free-form certification can be used by Korean producers and exporters, and US importers, when attesting that their goods meet the requirements of the Korea FTA.
