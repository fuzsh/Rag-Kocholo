        "text": "Despite the approaching universality of the United Nations, Switzerland continues to be a non-member. Her traditional policy of permanent neutrality, which is theoretically incompatible with the United Nations collective security system, and an unsatisfactory experience as a member of the League of Nations largely explain this absence. Ironically enough, however, Switzerland has played in effect as active a role in the United Nations as have many actual members. Switzerland belongs to most of the specialized agencies and many of the Organization's ancillary organs. She has even involved herself in numerous peacekeeping activities. Geneva serves as the Organization's European headquarters. Thus, the Swiss freely participate in what they refer to as the “technical,” as distinguished from the “political” United Nations. The increased prestige of neutrality and neutral Austria's successful membership, approaching universality, the waning of collective security, and a desire to participate fully in international relations are encouraging a gradual reorientation towards the United Nations which may some day lead to formal Swiss membership.\n\n3 See, however, the penetrating analysis by Boczek, Boleslaw A., “Permanent Neutrality and Collective Security: The Case of Switzerland and the United Nations Sanctions Against Rhodesia,” Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law 1 (Spring 1969): 75–104Google Scholar, and also Wildhaber, Luzius, “Switzerland, Neutrality, and the United Nations,” Malaya Law Review 12 (07 1970): 140–59Google Scholar. In addition, see Black, Cyril E., Falk, Richard A., Knorr, Klaus and Young, Oran R., Neutralization and World Politics (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1968), pp. 50–6 and 162–6Google Scholar. For a brief discussion of the original Swiss decision not to seek United Nations membership, see Rappard, William E., “The United Nations and Switzerland,” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 246 (07 1946): 64–71.CrossRefGoogle Scholar\n\n4 (First) Report of the Federal Council to the Federal Assembly Concerning Switzerland's Relations with the United Nations, June 16, 1969, hereinafter cited as First Report; and (Second) Report of the Federal Council to the Federal Assembly Concerning Switzerland's Relations with the United Nations, November 17, 1971, hereinafter cited as Second Report. The report of a special consultative commission consisting of fifty eminent Swiss will be submitted to the Federal Council by the end of 1975. It is understood that this new Report basically will maintain the position already achieved in the First and Second Reports.\n\n5 Two eminent Swiss authorities have explained: Neutrality is “the fundamental principle of the Federal Constitution,” and “the axiom of Swiss foreign policy.” Bonjour, Edgar, Swiss Neutrality: Its History and Meaning, trans. by Hottinger, Mary (London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1946), p. 7Google Scholar. Thus exists “what might well be called the religion of neutrality in the civic conscience of the Swiss people.” Rappard, William E., Collective Security in Swiss Experience, 1291–1948 (London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1948), p. 19Google Scholar. It is beyond the scope of this article to examine the ancient origins and history of Swiss neutrality. Suffice it to state that the permanent neutrality of Switzerland became an integral element of international law in 1815 when it was formally recognized in the Treaty of Vienna It was reaffirmed by Article 435 of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. In 1966, the International Law Commission stated in its comment on Article 34 (rules in a treaty becoming binding through international usage) of the Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties that the agreement for Swiss neutrality, since they have been accepted by so many other states, now constitute a precedent binding upon others by way of custom. See 21 U.N. GAOR Supp. 9, U.N. Doc A/6309/Rev. 1 (1966).\n\n23 Ibid., pp. 459–60, 722. For further discussion of this matter, see Lalive, J.F., “International Organization and Neutrality,” British Yearbook of International Law (1947): 77–8Google Scholar, who explained: “In the minds of many, the concept and the very word neutrality have fallen into discredit…. It has become a target for statesmen and international lawyers, who see in it an obstacle to solidarity, to international organization, and to the formation of a society of states founded on respect for, and enforcement of, law.” p. 73.\n\n38 Switzerland had no observer at San Francisco, but Professor William E. Rappard, who had been one of Switzerland's four representatives in Paris at the conference to set up the League of Nations, did follow the work of the Preparatory Commission from June 1945 on. Ad hoc observers were sent to General Assembly meetings prior to the summer of 1946.\n\n46 The Swiss National Bank does not possess the machinery necessary to overcome the inflationary consequences that might result from the issuing of Swiss francs under IMF drawing rights. In addition, IMF rules are viewed as being too rigid in regards to the acceptable limits for fluctuations in exchange rates. Finally, IMF membership would entail too heavy a financial burden. First Report, pp. 87–8. Swiss membership in the IBRD, IFC, and IDA is precluded by the necessity of possessing prior membership in IMF.\n\n62 The maxim of international law “pacta tertiis nee nocent nee prosunt” (treaties do not affect non-signatories) would certainly entitle the Swiss to object to the application of Article 2(6) to their situation. On the other hand, it cannot be supposed that the United Nations would willingly allow its decisions to be vitiated because one relatively small state chose not to join it. Article 2(6) exists precisely to correct such possibilities. In addition, it should be noted that Article 2(6) might become binding upon non-signatories such as Switzerland through custom.\n\n74 This term basically refers to those states which are not aligned on the side of either bloc in the Cold War. It lacks any legal definition and must in no way be confused with the status of neutrality. Interestingly enough, however, the fact that the term “neutralism” carries such a favorable connotation for so many of the new Third World states has undoubtedly helped, through a kind of osmosis process, to give the term “neutrality” a more palatable flavor than it initially possessed when the United Nations was created.\n\n88 Second Report, p. 10. Rhodesia is not the only example. United Nations action in regard to Namibia has created “ a new development” which “has recently corroborated what has been said on the subject of non-member States in relation to Article 2(6).” Ibid. The immediate reference apparently was to United Nations, Security Council Resolution 301, October 20, 1971, which stated in part: “The Security Council … agrees with the [World] Court's opinion … that it is incumbent upon States which are not Members of the United Nations to give assistance … in the action which has been taken by the United Nations with regard to Namibia.” (Italics added.)\n\n95 Ibid., p. 134. A public opinion poll in 1967 indicated just this. See “Poll Indicates Many Swiss Oppose Joining the U.N.,” New York Times, 09 16, 1967, p. 14Google Scholar. Recent developments in the United Nations concerning the Mideast, South Africa, and, in general, the manner in which the automatic majority of the developing states has been used have reinforced this hesitancy."
