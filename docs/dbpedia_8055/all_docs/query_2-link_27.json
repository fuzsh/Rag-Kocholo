        "text": "In order to achieve international peace and security, the UN Peacekeeping Operations(PKO) carry out the following activities in countries that are in the process of restoring peace after the cessation of hostilities: observation of the ceasefire, disarmament, prevention of dispute recurrence, maintenance of public security and safety, support for post-war reconstruction, and promotion of human rights and the rule of law.\n\nThe mandate for peacekeeping operations is not formally stipulated in the UN Charter. Nonetheless, peacekeeping operations have begun to assume an important function in establishing the post-Cold War international order and it is understood as belonging to a realm halfway between Chapter 6 (Pacific Settlement of Disputes) and Chapter 7 (Action With Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Agression) of the UN Charter, thereby giving rise to the term \"Chapter 6.5.\"\n\nSince its first activity in Palestine in 1948 to monitor the region's ceasefire status, a total of 71 PKO missions have been implemented, joined by more than a million participants. As of November 2023, the total number of personnel serving in 11 peacekeeping operations is 66,844 which includes troops, civilian personnel and police.\n\nMilitary forces dispatched for peacekeeping operations are called Peacekeeping Forces (PKF), which are distinct from Multinational Forces (MNF).\n\nUN Peacekeeping Operations are integral to the maintenance of international peace and security. The Korean government is aware of the importance of peacekeeping operations and is making the effort to further contribute to the international community including through increased participation in various peacekeeping activities.\n\nDomestically, the \"United Nations Peacekeeping Operations Participation Act\" was enacted in 2010 in a bid to promote Korea's prompt participation in UN peacekeeping operations. This law allows the Korean government and the UN to establish provisional agreements on matters related to the deployment of peacekeepers prior to the approval of the National Assembly.\n\nRecognizing the importance of UN peacekeeping operations in maintaining international peace and security, the Korean government will continue to actively participate in peacekeeping missions and strive to make further contributions to the PKO."
