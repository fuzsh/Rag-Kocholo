        "text": "Formed by the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, and China in the aftermath of World War II, the United Nations is the largest and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world. The UN Charter was first signed on June 26, 1945, and entered into effect on October 24, 1945. A total of 51 member countries attended the UN General Assembly's first meeting, which took place in London, England on January 10, 1946. As of 2023, the UN includes 193 member states and two non-member observer states (full list below). Few sovereign territories exist that are not members of the United Nations.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the United Nations?\n\nThe United Nations charter establishes four main goals for the organization:\n\nTo maintain international peace and security (primarily through peaceful diplomatic means).\n\nTo develop friendly relations among nations, granting equal rights to all and working to strengthen global peace.\n\nTo create a forum which leverages international cooperation to solve economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian challenges and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.\n\nTo be a hub and catalyst that harmonizes the actions of its member nations to achieve the organization's stated goals of peace and security.\n\nStructure of the United Nations\n\nThe UN is made up of six main organs, five of which are active:\n\nThe General Assembly — Roles include handling the budget and admitting new members.\n\nThe Secretariat — Offers administrative support to the other bodies.\n\nThe Security Council — Responsible for maintaining international peace and security.\n\nThe International Court of Justice — Gives legal opinions and settles disputes.\n\nThe Economic and Security Council — Handles cooperation between states in economic and social matters.\n\nThe remaining organ, the Trusteeship Council, technically still exists but has been inactive since 1994. The Trusteeship Council's role was to oversee and mentor non-sovereign \"trustee\" territories. The last trustee (Palau) obtained its sovereignty in 1994. Its purpose fulfilled, the council's operations were suspended. However, it has never been officially disbanded."
