Institute of Sacred Music students are also enrolled in either the Divinity School or the School of Music, and counted only once in this table, in the ISM row. Enrollment figures for each school include only those students paying tuition to that school in the fall term. Columns above give student gender: M (men), W (women), N (as offered to students; includes gender nonbinary and cases with no self-reported data).\n\nThe Yale Office of Career Strategy was able to obtain information on the post-graduate outcomes for 90.3% of the total Yale College Class of 2023, with approximately six percent of the Class still seeking opportunities six months after graduation. When asked about post-graduate plans, almost three-quarters (73.6%) are employed, with the next largest group (19%) attending graduate school. Among those employed, 69.2% indicated they intend to pursue graduate school within the next five years. Almost two percent of respondents are pursuing their own entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nConfirmed Plans for Fall 2023 Class of 2023 Employed: full-time/part-time/short-term position 73.6% Attending graduate or professional school 19.0% Employed: Independent research 1.7% Employed: Military service 1.2% Not seeking employment or continuing education 0.7%\n\nTo view the full report, please visit the Yale Office of Career Strategy.\n\nYale Schools Tenured Term Continuing Instructional Research Total Arts & Sciences 444 160 0 366 118 1,088 Engineering & Applied Science 64 37 0 20 31 152 Architecture 8 5 0 80 0 93 Art 7 3 0 62 1 73 Divinity 23 10 0 29 7 69 David Geffen School of Drama 1 0 0 109 0 110 Environment 27 6 0 23 19 75 Jackson School of Global Affairs 0 0 0 43 1 44 Law 54 2 8 53 77 194 Management 46 41 0 36 1 124 Medicine 220 112 1,840 257 687 3,116 Music 3 0 0 67 2 72 Nursing 10 6 12 93 1 122 Public Health 41 34 26 9 57 167 Total 948 416 1,886 1,247 1,002 5,499\n\nFaculty with appointments in multiple Yale schools are counted only once in this table and are included in the school where they hold their primary appointment. As a result, the numbers listed for any one school may not fully represent the entire body of faculty who teach and work with students in that school.\n\nIn the Schools of Music and Drama, adjunct professors provide the core of the schoolsâ€™ regular faculty. As a result, the distinction among the categories of tenured/term/non-ladder is less relevant in those schools.\n\nIn 2018 the additional category of Ladder/Continuing was added to the table. This category counts Law, Medicine, and Nursing ladder faculty who are not on the tenure track.\n\nFaculty appointed to Yale College are counted within the Faculty of Arts & Sciences. Ladder faculty in the Jackson School of Global Affairs are counted in the schools in which they are jointly appointed. Faculty in the Institute of Sacred Music are counted in either the School of Music or the Divinity School. Prior to 2022, faculty in the School of Engineering and Applied Science were counted within the Faculty of Arts & Sciences.\n\nFaculty who are paid by Yale (including visiting faculty) or are Howard Hughes Medical Investigators are included. Faculty who are on leave without salary are excluded."
