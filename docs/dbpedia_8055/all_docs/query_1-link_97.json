        "text": "What Is the United Nations (UN)?\n\nThe United Nations (UN) is an international nonprofit organization formed in 1945 to increase political and economic cooperation among its member countries. There are more than 190 member states in the UNâ€”all of which are part of the UN's General Assembly. Headquartered in New York, the organization is guided by a charter and headed by its secretary-general. It focuses on peace, security, human rights, and other issues. The UN is part of the larger United Nations System.\n\nUnderstanding the United Nations (UN)\n\nThe United Nations was formed in 1945 in the wake of World War II to reduce international tension, promote human rights, and lower the chance of other large-scale conflicts. It came out of the League of Nations, which was established after WWI in 1920 to promote international relations and cooperation. The league could not prevent the war in Europe and Asia in the 1930s. The U.S. wasn't part of the League of Nations.\n\nHeadquartered in New York and led by the Secretary-General, the UN has 193 member states, representing almost every country in the world. There are five permanent U.N. members: the U.S., Russia, France, the U.K., and China. When a new state applies to join the UN, it only takes one permanent member to veto the application.\n\nA few states lack UN membership, though countries exercise de facto sovereignty. In some cases, the international community doesn't recognize non-members as independent, such as Tibet, Somaliland, and Abkhazia. Some countries were blocked from being admitted (Taiwan and Kosovo among others) by more powerful member states.\n\nThe UN \"coordinates its work with the funds, programmes, specialized agencies and other organizations of the UN System.\" Some of the key focus areas include:\n\nPeace and security\n\nHuman rights\n\nHumanitarian aid\n\nSustainable development and climate\n\nInternational law\n\nGlobal issues\n\nStructure of the United Nations (UN)\n\nThe UN is made up of five principal bodies: the UN General Assembly, the UN Secretariat, the International Court of Justice, the UN Security Council, and the UN Economic and Social Council. A sixth, the UN Trusteeship Council, has been inactive since 1994.\n\nUN General Assembly\n\nThis is the UN's main deliberative body, in which all members have equal representation. It is headquartered in New York City, and its responsibilities include setting the UN's budget, appointing rotating members to the Security Council, and passing non-binding resolutions that express the opinions of the international community.\n\nUN Secretariat\n\nThe UN Secretariat is the executive wing of the UN, charged with implementing policies set by its deliberative bodies. Its head, the Secretary-General, is the UN's top official. The Secretariat, which is based in New York City, includes the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which dispatches UN soldiers (known as blue helmets) on missions authorized by the Security Council.\n\nInternational Court of Justice\n\nThe International Court of Justice is based in The Hague and has two main functions: to settle disputes submitted by member states according to international law and to issue advisory opinions on legal questions submitted by UN agencies. There are 15 judges, and the court's official languages are French and English. Appeals are not allowed, making the judgments final.\n\nUN Security Council\n\nThe UN Security Council is charged with maintaining international security. It authorizes peacekeeping missions, accepts new U.N. members, and approves changes to the UN charter. The Security Council's structure allows a few powerful member states to dominate the UN: Russia, the U.K., France, China, and the U.S. hold permanent seats on the council and enjoy veto power.\n\nThe Security Council's other 10 seats rotate on a staggered two-year schedule. These seats are occupied by Algeria (2025), Ecuador (2024), Guyana (2025), Japan (2024), Malta (2024), Mozambique (2024), South Korea (2025), Sierra Leone (2025), Slovenia (2025), and Switzerland (2024). The years in parentheses indicate the end of their terms on the council.\n\nUN Economic and Social Council\n\nThe UN Economic and Social Council coordinates the activities of the UN's 15 specialized agencies. These include the:\n\nFood and Agriculture Organization, which leads efforts to improve food security\n\nInternational Labour Organization, which promotes workers' interests\n\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), two of the Bretton Woods institutions, which were founded to shore up international financial stability\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe United Nations is one of the most recognized nonprofit organizations in the world. Established in 1945, the UN has almost 200 member states. Its focus is to promote peace and security, human rights, and humanitarian aid. Operating under the UN System, the UN has five principal bodies. The organization is led by the secretary-general, who acts as a diplomat and an advocate for member states."
