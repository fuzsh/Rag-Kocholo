        "text": "Relief\n\nGeologically, South Korea consists in large part of Precambrian rocks (i.e., more than about 540 million years old) such as granite and gneiss. The country is largely mountainous, with small valleys and narrow coastal plains. The Taebaek Mountains run in roughly a north-south direction along the eastern coastline and northward into North Korea, forming the country’s drainage divide. From them several mountain ranges branch off with a northeast-southwest orientation. The most important of these are the Sobaek Mountains, which undulate in a long S-shape across the peninsula. None of South Korea’s mountains are very high: the Taebaek Mountains reach an elevation of 5,604 feet (1,708 meters) at Mount Seorak in the northeast, and the Sobaek Mountains reach 6,283 feet (1,915 meters) at Mount Jiri. The highest peak in South Korea, the extinct volcano Mount Halla on Jeju Island, is 6,398 feet (1,950 meters) above sea level.\n\nSouth Korea has two volcanic islands—Jeju, off the peninsula’s southern tip, and Ulleung, about 85 miles (140 km) east of the mainland in the East Sea—and a small-scale lava plateau in Gangwon province. In addition, South Korea claims and occupies a group of rocky islets—known variously as Liancourt Rocks, Dok Islands (Korean), and Take Islands (Japanese)—some 55 miles (85 km) southeast of Ulleung Island; these islets also have been claimed by Japan.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWhich Country Is Larger By Population? Quiz\n\nThere are fairly extensive lowlands along the lower parts of the country’s main rivers. The eastern coastline is relatively straight, whereas the western and southern have extremely complicated ria (i.e., creek-indented) coastlines with many islands. The shallow Yellow Sea and the complex Korean coastline produce one of the most pronounced tidal variations in the world—about 30 feet (9 meters) maximum at Incheon, the entry port for Seoul.\n\nDrainage\n\nSouth Korea’s three principal rivers, the Han, Geum, and Nakdong, all have their sources in the Taebaek Mountains, and they flow between the ranges before entering their lowland plains. Nearly all the country’s rivers flow westward or southward into either the Yellow Sea or the East China Sea; only a few short, swift rivers drain eastward from the Taebaek Mountains. The Nakdong River, South Korea’s longest, runs southward for 325 miles (523 km) to the Korea Strait. Streamflow is highly variable, being greatest during the wet summer months and considerably less in the relatively dry winter.\n\nClimate\n\nThe greatest influence on the climate of the Korean peninsula is its proximity to the main Asian landmass. This produces the marked summer-winter temperature extremes of a continental climate while also establishing the northeast Asian monsoons (seasonal winds) that affect precipitation patterns. The annual range of temperature is greater in the north and in interior regions of the peninsula than in the south and along the coast, reflecting the relative decline in continental influences in the latter areas.\n\nSouth Korea’s climate is characterized by a cold, relatively dry winter and a hot, humid summer. The coldest average monthly temperatures in winter drop below freezing except along the southern coast. The average January temperature at Seoul is in the low 20s °F (about −5 °C), while the corresponding average at Busan, on the southeast coast, is in the mid-30s °F (about 2 °C). By contrast, summer temperatures are relatively uniform across the country, the average monthly temperature for August (the warmest month) being in the high 70s °F (about 25 °C).\n\nAnnual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 60 inches (900 to 1,500 mm) on the mainland. Daegu, on the east coast, is the driest area, while the southern coast is the wettest; southern Jeju Island receives more than 70 inches (1,800 mm) annually. Up to three-fifths of the annual precipitation is received in June–August, during the summer monsoon, the annual distribution being more even in the extreme south. Occasionally, late-summer typhoons (tropical cyclones) cause heavy showers and storms along the southern coast. Precipitation in winter falls mainly as snow, with the heaviest amounts occurring in the Taebaek Mountains. The frost-free season ranges from 170 days in the northern highlands to more than 240 days on Jeju Island."
