Also, the expansion of cloud computing, the multiplication of digital devices, and the increased digital activity that Covid-19 spurred is contributing to the growth of the cybersecurity market.\n\nSouth Korea deems cybersecurity as a matter of national security. Although the country boasts one of the world’s fastest IT infrastructures, it also has an infrastructure that is vulnerable to cyberattacks. The frequency and gravity of recent cyberattacks prompted the South Korean government to re-evaluate its cybersecurity strategy. In 2019, led by the office of the President, the ROK government announced its first National Cybersecurity Strategy. This strategy includes strengthening partnerships with foreign countries and companies and expanding investment to the domestic cybersecurity industry. In 2022, to accelerate the promotion of its cybersecurity industry, the Korean government established the “Strategic Plan to Foster Data Protection Industry” and the “Digital Strategy of Korea”.\n\nThere is a growing number of domestic and U.S. companies providing cybersecurity services in Korea. There are 669 cybersecurity firms registered in Korea. While most of these firms have developed their own products, some are opened to partnering with small and medium sized exporters from the United States. These Korean companies are interested in filling gaps in technology and product/service line-up, in order to better help their clients meet a wide range of cybersecurity needs.\n\nTo enter the local public sector, foreign cybersecurity companies must understand local requirements. For example, local public agencies require companies to receive additional verification even if their products have already received Center for Cybersecurity Research and Analysis (CCRA) certification outside of the country. Also, depending on the product type and end-users, foreign companies should obtain security assurances such as the Korea Cryptographic Module Validation Program (KCMVP) and the Security Function Test Report before they can supply to public agencies in Korea.\n\nSub-Sector Best Prospects for 2023\n\nThe Korean public and private sectors predict that the key sub-sectors for the domestic cybersecurity market in 2023 include solutions for ransomware, cloud security, and supply chain risk management (see below chart).\n\nNIS\n\nKISA\n\nAhnlab\n\nSamsung SDS\n\nAdvanced Hacking Tools\n\nCyberattacks from International Hacker Groups\n\nMultifaceted Extortion using Ransomware\n\nCloud Security\n\nHacking for Social Disorder\n\nAdvanced Ransomware\n\nParasitic APT\n\nAccount Takeover\n\nRansomware\n\nCloud Security\n\nZero-day Vulnerability on Core Assets\n\nAdvanced Ransomware\n\nSupply Chain Risk Management\n\nAdvanced Persistent Threat on Society\n\nSupply Chain Security for Mobile Devices\n\nSupply Chain Risk Management\n\nCyber Espionage on Advanced Technology & Security Information\n\nSupply Chain Cybersecurity\n\nSecurity for Digital Assets\n\nHacking using AI\n\nSource: National Intelligence Service (NIS), Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA), Ahnlab, Samsung SDS, 2022\n\nOpportunities\n\nDue to its leads in advanced ICT infrastructure and geopolitical factors, South Korea is an attractive market for U.S. firms seeking to test cybersecurity solutions before deployment in other markets in Asia. While firms that produce sophisticated products for critical infrastructure and edge devices are more likely to succeed, there are also opportunities for firms that provide cybersecurity related consulting and training services. Overall, the Korean market favors the quality and reliability of U.S. technologies and demand for American products is expected to continue.\n\nTo enter the cybersecurity market, CS Korea recommends that U.S. technology firms to partner with qualified and capable South Korean companies that maintain existing sales networks in both private/public sectors and are fully aware of local market characteristics and unique regulatory requirements. In the long term, it is recommended to consider employing a local hire or establishing a local office to provide prompt technical support and overcome possible communication issues with end customers.\n\nResources\n\nTrade Shows\n\nSECON & eGISEC (April / Seoul)\n\nFirst hosted in 2001, SECON & eGISEC is Korea’s largest security exhibition covering all sectors of both cyber and physical security.

According to Gartner, the South Korea cloud computing market reached $4.0B in 2022, a 23 percent increase over the previous year.\n\nGlobal cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google have led the cloud computing market in Korea. To further increase their market share, the global players have accelerated their investments in Korea. Global cloud service providers have opened multiple data centers in the peninsula. The recent boost in demand for cloud computing has caught the attention of Korean companies. Major Korean IT companies (Naver, NHN) and mobile carriers (KT) have entered the market. Also, as more information infrastructure and company data have been migrated into the cloud, more Korean companies are starting to use software/services on the cloud.\n\nIn the public sector, South Korea was one of the first countries to establish a national cloud computing strategy. The government presented its first blueprint for the promotion of the cloud computing industry in 2015. To stimulate the sector, the government released new guidelines in 2018 on the use of the private cloud services for the public sector. The guidelines designate cloud computing as an alternative measure to network separation for cybersecurity and for storage of important data such as financial information. In 2022, the government included cloud computing as one of the sub-areas for its national digital strategy with the goal of promoting high-speed/energy efficient cloud infrastructures and transitioning the country’s software market to the Software as a Service model.\n\nTo enter the Korean public cloud market, foreign cloud companies face significantly more restrictions and must understand certain market specific requirements regarding personal information and data protection. One of the key regulations is the cloud security certification for public sector cloud service procurement. Although their presence is expected to strengthen further within the private sector, the global CSPs are facing challenges in the public sector. The Korean government introduced the Cloud Security Assurance Program (CSAP) which requires foreign CSPs to create a separate Korea-unique product for all central/local government agencies, affiliated public institutions, educational institutions, and public hospitals. The government recently amended the program which eases certain requirements on physical system location, backup system, and operation management; however, industry assesses that the new certification process still remains complex and ambiguous on some requirements such as the common criteria requirements and data protection measures.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThanks to the continuing cloud migration of the private sector, the Korean cloud market is forecasted to grow to $5.2B in 2023 according to Gartner. The U.S. cloud service companies will continue to be the leading providers of this Infrastructure as a Service sector. As more local private companies seek to adopt various and customized applications and services on their cloud, there will be increasing opportunities in the SaaS sector. U.S. SaaS companies will be able to extend their business to the Korean market by using local cloud service providers. Also, cloud management service is another promising sector as a smooth cloud migration is critical for local companies new to cloud computing.\n\nResources\n\nTrade Shows\n\n· Grand Cloud Conference (December, Seoul)\n\n· Cloud Expo Korea (September, Busan)\n\nKey Contacts\n\nMinistry of Science and ICT\n\nKorea Association of Cloud Industry\n\nKorea Internet & Security Agency\n\nLocal Contact\n\nU.S. Commercial Service Korea\n\nU.S. Embassy Seoul\n\n188 Sejong-daero, Jongro-gu\n\nSeoul 03141, Korea\n\nTel: 82-2-397-4535\n\noffice.seoul@trade.gov\n\nhttps://www.trade.gov/south-korea\n\nSemiconductor\n\nITA Code: ICT\n\nNAICS Code: 334413\n\nOverview\n\nThe semiconductor industry is one of South Korea’s core industries. The industry accounts for 8 percent of the national GDP. Semiconductors (chips) are the largest export item ($129 billion) which made up 18.9 percent of the country’s total exports in 2022 according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Thanks to solid demand for chips for new IT devices, and innovative services like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, the global demand for chips has grown, resulting in the industry posting strong growth over the past few years.\n\nSouth Korea is a global leader in the memory chip fabrication. As of 2022, two South Korea memory giants – Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix held 73 percent of the global DRAM market share and 51 percent of the NAND flash market according to TrendForce. Also, Korea has many small and medium-sized companies producing various semiconductor products and equipment. There are 4,464 semiconductor related companies including fabless, foundry, packaging, materials and equipment makers in South Korea according to a survey from the South Korean government.\n\nWhile South Korea is considered a leader in technological competitiveness in memory chips, other types of semiconductor products such as microprocessors and sensors are less competitive globally. In order to expand the country’s semiconductor leadership beyond memory chips, the country announced a series of national development plans to support the industry.\n\nThe most recent government plan announced was the high-tech industry development initiative (2023). The plan calls for 550 trillion won, equivalent to $422 billion, of national investment in the six leading tech sectors including semiconductors. The other five sectors are flat screen displays, batteries, biopharmaceuticals, future vehicles, and robots. The initiative laid out the Republic of Korea (ROK)’s ambitious goal to build the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturing cluster over next two decades. Also, the initiative includes a national R&D goal including core semiconductor technologies, semiconductor talent development, strengthening of the country’s non-memory sector ecosystem, and expansion of global partnerships.\n\nAlso, in March 2023, South Korea revised the Restriction of Special Taxation Act called K-Chips Act, which will increase tax credits from the current 8 percent to 15 percent for semiconductor facility investment by large companies and from 16 percent to 25 percent for that by small and medium-sized companies.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe rapidly growing AI and cloud computing markets are key growth factors for semiconductors. Market demand will be driven further by increasing connectivity through innovative technologies such as next-gen network, connected cars, and IoT. As one of the world’s major semiconductor manufacturers, Korea will be among the primary beneficiaries of such technology innovations. Moreover, as the total production increases, more equipment and materials will be needed, including imports.\n\nThere is an enormous market for suppliers of equipment, materials, and services for semiconductor fabrication in South Korea. For example, in 2022 South Korean companies purchased $22 billion of semiconductor equipment representing 20 percent of the global semiconductor equipment market according to a survey by SEMI. Most of the equipment was provided by foreign semiconductor equipment makers mainly from the United States, Japan, and Netherlands. Also, South Korea imports significant amount of semiconductor materials from the United States and Japan.\n\nTo retain its leadership in the semiconductor market, local companies are proactively investing in expanding their advanced fabrication capabilities.\n\n· Samsung Electronics: U.S. Expansion: In 2022, Samsung broke ground on its second foundry chip production line in Taylor, Texas, investing $17 billion in buildings, property improvements, machinery and equipment.
