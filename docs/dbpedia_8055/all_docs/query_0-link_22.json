        "text": "In July 1951, a diplomatic conference in Geneva adopted the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. It has since been subject to only one amendment in the form of the 1967 Protocol.\n\nInitially, the 1951 Convention was essentially limited to protecting European refugees in the aftermath of the Second World War: The document contains the words “events occurring before 1 January 1951” which are widely understood to mean “events occurring in Europe” prior to that date.\n\nThe 1967 Protocol, adopted 4 October 1967, removes these geographic and time-based limitations, expanding the Convention to apply universally and protect all persons fleeing conflict and persecution.\n\nArticle 1 of the 1951 Convention defines a refugee as someone who \"owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of [their] nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail [themself] of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of [their] former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.\"\n\nRegional refugee instruments complement the 1951 Convention and have built upon its definition, by referencing a number of ‘objective’ circumstances compelling refugees to flee their countries of origin. For example, the definition outlined in the 1969 OAU (Organization of African Unity) Refugee Convention includes ‘external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order’ (Article 1 (2)). The 1984 Cartagena Declaration includes ‘generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violations of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order’ (paragraph III (3)).\n\nStates are responsible for protecting the fundamental human rights of their citizens.\n\nWhen they are unable or unwilling to do so – often for political reasons, based on discrimination, or due to conflict, violence and other circumstances seriously disturbing public order – individuals may suffer such serious violations of their human rights that they must leave their homes, their families and their communities to find sanctuary in another country.\n\nSince, by definition, refugees are not protected by their own governments, the international community steps in to ensure they are safe and protected.\n\nCountries that have signed the 1951 Convention are obliged to protect refugees on their territory and treat them according to internationally recognized standards.\n\nThe cornerstone of the 1951 Convention is the principle of non-refoulement contained in Article 33. According to this principle, a refugee should not be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom.\n\nOther rights contained in the 1951 Convention include:\n\nThe right not to be expelled, except under certain, strictly defined conditions (Article 32)\n\nThe right not to be punished for irregular entry into the territory of a contracting State (Article 31)\n\nThe right to non-discrimination (Articles 3 and 5)\n\nThe right to decent work (Articles 17 to 19 and 24)\n\nThe right to housing, land and property, including intellectual property (Articles 13, 14 and 21)\n\nThe right to education (Article 22)\n\nThe right to freedom of religion (Article 4)\n\nThe right to access to justice (Article 16)\n\nThe right to freedom of movement within the territory (Article 26 and Article 31 (2))\n\nThe right to be issued civil, identity and travel documents (Articles 12, 27 and 28)\n\nThe right to social protection (Articles 23 and 24 (2-4)).\n\nA State can accede to the 1951 Convention at any time by depositing an instrument of accession with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The instrument of accession must be signed by the Foreign Minister or the Head of State or Government.\n\nStates wishing to accede to the 1967 Protocol should follow the same procedure. States may also accede simultaneously to both the Convention and Protocol, and most States choose to do so.\n\nLearn more about how and why States can accede to the 1951 Convention and its Protocol (pdf)."
