        "text": "Under One Flag\n\nFollowing North Korean aggression against South Korea, United Nations Command (UNC) was established on July 24, 1950. UNC signifies the worldâ€™s first attempt at collective security under the United Nations system. United Nations Security Council Resolutions 83 and 84 provided the international legal authority for member states to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula, and they designated the United States as the leader of the unified command we know as UN Command. From 1950 to 1953, twenty-two countries contributed either combat forces or medical units to support South Korea under the United Nations flag.\n\nToday, UNC continues its unbroken commitment to secure a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula by enforcing the Armistice Agreement, facilitating diplomacy with North Korea, and serving as the integrator for multinational forces during crisis or conflict."
