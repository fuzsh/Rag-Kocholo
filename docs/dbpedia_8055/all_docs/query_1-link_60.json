        "text": "Representatives from the United States, Italy, the Republic of Korea and other United Nations Command member states gathered at Collier Field House here to recognize the reinstatement of The Italian Republic into the United Nations Command Dec.12.\n\nGeneral Curtis Scaparrotti, commander, United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command, and U.S. Forces Korea and host of the ceremony, spoke about the importance of this occasion.\n\n“We welcome Italy’s decision to re-establish membership with the United Nations Command and are thankful for their support. Returning to the United Nations Command as an active member demonstrates Italy’s support for the defense of the Republic of Korea and for fostering stability in the region.” Gen. Scaparrotti said. “Italy will now be able to participate in the daily, important mission of maintaining the Armistice.”\n\nThe Republic of Italy officially re-established membership with the United Nations Command on December 12, 2013, becoming UNC’s 17th participating member nation. Becoming an active member of the UNC reaffirms Italy’s support for the Republic of Korea and their commitment to maintaining stability on the Korean peninsula and working toward a permanent peace."
