Species of pine are the most representative in the country; other conifers include spruces, larches, and yews. Among indigenous species are the Abeliophyllum distichum (white forsythia or Korean abelia), a shrub of the olive family, and the Korean fir (Abies koreana).\n\nAudio File: National anthem of South Korea\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Yoon Suk-Yeol, assisted by Prime Minister: Han Duck-Soo\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 51,228,000\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\n1 USD equals 1386.148 South Korean won\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nunitary multiparty republic with one legislative house (National Assembly [300])\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 17, 2024, 7:40 PM ET (The Star)\n\nSouth Korean weather agency to publish white paper on heat waves for first time\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 3:23 PM ET (Voice of America)\n\nSouth Korea's Yoon makes rare outreach to North Koreans for unification\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 2:52 AM ET (Voice of America)\n\nAnalysts: Flood disaster exposes Kim Jong Un's fear of South Korean influence\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 8:44 AM ET (AP)\n\nKorean American star Jay Park discusses his garlic juice, foray into K-pop and keeping it real\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 2:45 AM ET (AP)\n\nSouth Korea and US will start summer military drills next week to counter North Korean threats\n\nWild animal life is similar to that of northern and northeastern China. The most numerous larger mammals are deer. Tigers, leopards, lynx, and bears, formerly abundant, have almost disappeared, even in remote areas. Some 380 species of birds are found in the country, most of which are seasonal migrants. Many of South Korea’s fish, reptile, and amphibian species are threatened by intensive cultivation and environmental pollution except in the DMZ between North and South Korea, which has become a de facto nature preserve. Once farmland, and subsequently a devastated battleground, the DMZ has lain almost untouched since the end of hostilities and has reverted to nature to a large extent, making it one of the most pristine undeveloped areas in Asia. It contains many ecosystems including forests, estuaries, and wetlands frequented by migratory birds. The zone serves as a sanctuary for hundreds of bird species, among them the endangered white-naped and red-crowned cranes, and is home to dozens of fish species and Asiatic black bears, lynxes, and other mammals.\n\nEthnic groups\n\nIt was long believed that the Korean people originally may have had links with the people of Central Asia, the Lake Baikal region of Siberia, Mongolia, and the coastal areas of the Yellow Sea. Tools of Paleolithic type and other artifacts found in Sokchang, near Gongju, are quite similar to those of the Lake Baikal and Mongolian areas. In 2017, genetic analysis of bones found in Primorye kray in Far Eastern Russia suggested that Koreans were related to a population that had inhabited that area for at least 7,700 years. The genes of these Neolithic humans were expressed alongside those of Indigenous agriculturalists from Southeast Asia to produce the genetic structure of modern Koreans.\n\nThe population of South Korea is highly homogeneous; almost the entire population is ethnically Korean, and there is a small minority of ethnic Chinese permanent residents. The number of foreigners is growing, especially in the major urban areas; people from Japan, the United States (including members of the military), and China make up the largest foreign populations, although they still constitute only small fractions. Many foreign nationals are employed in business or the diplomatic corps, and tens of thousands of workers come from China and Southeast Asia.\n\nLanguages\n\nAll Koreans speak the Korean language, which is often classified as one of the Altaic languages, has affinities to Japanese, and contains many Chinese loanwords. The Korean script, known in South Korea as Hangul (Hangeul) and in North Korea as Chosŏn muntcha, is composed of phonetic symbols for the 10 vowels and 14 consonants. Korean often is written as a combination of Chinese ideograms and Hangul in South Korea, although the trend is toward using less Chinese. A large number of English words and phrases have crept into the language—either intact or modified by local usage—as a result of the American presence in the country since 1950.\n\nReligion\n\nFreedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed in South Korea, and there is no national religion. There also is little uniformity of religious belief, a situation that often is confusing to outside observers. Historically, several religions prevailed successively: shamanism (the religious belief in gods, demons, and ancestral spirits responsive to a priest, or shaman), Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism. None of these religions was abandoned, however, when one supplanted another in dominance, and all have had a role in the country’s sociocultural development. Thus, the rites of shamanism (which has existed in Korea since ancient times) are still practiced by many. The principles and social outlook of Confucianism are still much in evidence in Korean daily life and family relationships, and Buddhism remains influential—even among people who may be nominally Christian, for example. Approximately one-fourth of the population professes Christianity, with Protestants (particularly Presbyterians and Methodists), independent Christians, and Roman Catholics the largest groups. Less than one-sixth of the population is Buddhist.\n\nChristianity is relatively new in Korea, Roman Catholic missionaries having reached the peninsula only in the late 18th century and their Protestant counterparts a century later. Christianity has had a profound effect on the modernization of Korean society. Buddhism was first introduced in the 4th century ce and was the official religion of the Goryeo dynasty, which began in 918. About one-sixth of the population adheres to so-called new religions. These include Wonbulgyo (Won Buddhism), Daejonggyo (“Great Ancestral Religion”), and Cheondogyo. Cheondogyo (“Teaching of the Heavenly Way”), originally known as Donghak (“Eastern Learning”), is a blend of Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, and even Daoism; it spread widely in the latter part of the 19th century. Shamanism and traditional geomancy (pungsu) persist, though their practices usually are limited to certain occasions, such as funerals. Confucianism was the basis of national ethics during the Joseon (Yi) dynasty (1392–1910); though the number of its official adherents is now small, most Korean families still follow its principles, including ancestor worship."
