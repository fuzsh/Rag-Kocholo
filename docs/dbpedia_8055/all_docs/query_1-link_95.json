        "text": "Established as a memorial museum in affiliation with the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs on November 11, 2014, the United Nations Peace Memorial aims to promote projects related to world peace and honor the UN forces who died on this land to protect the freedom and peace of South Korea.\n\nThe country of South Korea has managed to overcome the pain and ruin of war and go on to achieve the development we see today, and the basis of this achievement was the noble sacrifice of UN veterans. It is important to remain forever grateful and never forget the veterans who made precious sacrifices for an unfamiliar country.\n\nThe United Nations Peace Memorial is aiming to play a pivotal role in activities such as educational and cultural events that can pass on and further build upon the sacrifices that have been made for the sake of peace and the will to maintain that peace, thus becoming a memorial that is endlessly working and researching to achieve long-lasting peace."
