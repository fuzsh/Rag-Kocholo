        "text": "The best flavour of any fizzy drink is the one mixed with alcohol.\n\nAnything else is just fizzy crap, drink water or juice instead.\n\nBut alcohol is expensive and I’ve found I’m too broke for that. Since my last years of Secondary School I felt very conscious about my weight. I was always the twig girl, and people would comment that my brothers and I were too skinny but then I gradually started to grow, I was suddenly tall and had boobs. But this weight gain was unexpected and I feared my curves.\n\nBefore coming over to Erasmus I had begun to regularly do my knee exercises (turns out I have weak ligaments and a small kneecap), maintain a better routine, I was happier doing stuff and I think this reflected in my eating habits. I also stopped drinking alcohol with very small exceptions.\n\nThe combination of these new habits mixed with the nerves of moving by myself to a new country led me to a drastic weight loss. It strangely felt like being in my own body again, my ‘old self’ and I could’t even believe I used to consider myself ‘heavy’.\n\nI have to say weight is relative and a very personal thing, I’ve never been clinically over weight, always within the ‘under’ or ‘normal’ BMI, but like most people in this contemporary world, I’d let it control my mood and habits.\n\nErasmus started and I was the happiest I’ve ever been with my body in a while. But it slowly started hitting, the binge drinking and constantly eating out. I puffed, and felt that I had become the heaviest version of myself ever. But I was also having the time of my life and when I look back on it now I don’t focus on that- or how much money I spent- but rather the good times we had.\n\nIt’s a simple ‘move more eat less’. Stop worrying about it, this will do no good, it’s usually counterproductive.\n\nStill, the best flavour of soda is the one mixed with alcohol.\n\nJuly, a mid-new year.\n\nBy opening this page I’ve considered writing at least once a month, because since Istanbul there have been a series of core change I’d like to document. By now I cringe at the thought of saying I will commit to a regular content creation. I appreciate how it helps in developing a better style and correcting mistakes, but my holdbacks would be:\n\nWanting to create a solid piece of writing. Best way to describe this is a quote from Mark Twain: “I apologise for such a long letter – I didn’t have time to write a short one.”\n\nWhen times are high or in this case a rollercoaster of changes I don’t make the time to create, feeling like I’m consumed by whatever’s going on, I end up going to bed early rather than starting another project\n\nIn this case it’s not about ‘making something’, not lacking in this department, it’s about remembering events, conversations and thoughts from that month.\n\nSee the irony? Wanting to write to get better but not wanting to write regularly feeling not good enough. As this seems to be my main holdback, were going to set it aside and type out more often, at least once a month.\n\nAfter my Erasmus I was looking into a European internship in the hopes of continuing travelling and learning abroad, and to avoid going back to my home college. I thought that going home now would be the ‘easy option’, lazy, giving up. I convinced myself to fight for my right to travel and the chance to obtain my degree at the same time, preferably with a grant.\n\nI’m scared Erasmus was one of the best experiences I’ll ever have and I want to receive that high again. It reminds me how people now pay extreme amounts of money for a festival as they’re paying for the experience rather than the music. Erasmus was our unique unexpected experience. I believed that by living in a new country with a new crowd I’d be happier. I tackled the bureaucracy, created a new CV since being in UNI, and wrote cover letters left right and centre. I achieved some interviews but ultimately I didn’t take on any Erasmus jobs (work in Europe thanks to the Erasmus grant and learning agreement). But nevertheless it was great experience and a good starting point for the future.\n\nHow did things unravel then? These are the changes since coming back to Spain:\n\nIn July I started working in the Communication and Image department in Mediaset, a TV and film production company in Spain.\n\nMy family (i.e. parents and brothers) are moving to Germany for the next 3 years and I’ll be moving to the centre to live with my cousin – similar to how I searched for international jobs just to end up in Madrid, I searched for a flat all over Madrid to end up in my cousins free room (but the location and rent are great).\n\nMy love life is as weird as ever but I’m keeping myself to me trying not to rush into anything. Distance is good for that, even makes the heart grow fonder.\n\nThat’s pretty much what’s going on now, working in the mornings, preparing boxes to move flat and other full of books, clothes and general crap to throw away.\n\nNot to mention, anyone that has known me long enough will be aware of my crippling fear to dentists. I was 13 and in the need of a filling, everything was good until I sat on the chair and couldn’t stay still. It was uncomfortable and when I learned there was a needle involved I wasn’t having it. Needles make me uncomfortable but I’ve had to face them several times in recent years due to an x phase. I even pierced my own ear (advice: go to a shop, it’s quicker and cleaner), after all this fear debunking I’d get a tattoo if I was committed enough.\n\nWell I did it! After years of avoiding the problem I sat down, closed my eyes and I had thee fillings 8 years late. I really can’t complain, slight discomfort but honestly didn’t feel a thing and was surprised when the dentist told me she had finished, I could have sat down on that chair longer!\n\nI’ve come to think maybe I enjoy the attention, being taken cared off by doctors. Who knows, maybe I’m just lazy and really enjoy sitting down and being the centre of attention.\n\nBack to the content creation, I’m in a good place. Social media and access to other creators have caused a larger pressure to keep making things and maybe even posting them on the internet. I’ve thought about this from a few views. The first being I once thought that to have a prominent career in the contemporary arts, you have to be very active online. But I’m not confident enough with my music projects yet, I’d rather take a more traditional route of creating an EP collection and producing them slightly more professionally than the conditions my bathroom and iPad can offer. When it comes to pictures a bit of the same rule applies, I’d rather take the time to selects snaps that are worth long time sharing and possibly keep the personal ones close. I especially like Snapchat or Instagram’s stories feature as it allows you to share current moments and there is no need to keep them up forever.\n\nI’ve make things to express my feelings to myself and those close, I’m not in search of internet approval. I write songs, paint and enjoy crafting for myself. Any external pressure has gone and if I’m working on something for work there’s usually a clear deadline and goal ahead.\n\nNew job, new house, new teeth, new mind-set.\n\nI have one thing clear, I don’t want this life. An office 9 to 5 isn’t for me, Dolly’s right “They just use your mind and they never give you credit” and I definitely can’t handle the lack of holidays or freedom.\n\nAfter the many career plans I have thought up I’m certain it boils down to writing. I’d like to live life, read, travel and write. I half panic at the thought of not continuing songwriting and not fighting for the stereotypical star jobs I’ve always been fascinated with. Like how artists and actors talk about persistence in interviews and speeches. Now more than ever I would hate to have to deal with fame (just saying this is a factor that’s linked with success from where I stand) especially as it’s something that’s sought after before the actual essence of what you want to express and the extreme current media takes it too. And going back to celebrity interviews I’m upset it’s designed to promote films rather than a broader view of topics and personalities.\n\nBut I’m positive that there will be a certain shift towards this idea, thanks to the appearance of podcasts and new forms of media that take on more thought provoking questions, adapting to the modern audience. But “reality style” and gossip is so easy to consume and I’m currently standing by the gossip theory of how we developed our language.\n\nLove Island is an example of reality tv that circles around gossip and relationships. I must add I’ve never watched the show until the 2019 season, which has received a lot of backlash for being tamer than its predecessors and the contestants, mostly scouted Instagram models, were too aware of the show and its consequeces in the outside world. Now if you’ve never watched the show, here are some pointers:\n\nIn the past contestants were normal people from the streets that applied through a casting process. Many reality shows cast their stars, but due to Love Islands popularity and the relevance of online presence, the casting over audition process was clearly detectable in recent seasons.\n\nFrom my knowledge, contestants were allowed to drink and smoke on the show until smoking was banned and drinking was moderated to two glasses a night. Reducing the drama ad loose conversations.\n\nDue to the show’s popularity and recurring way contestants couldn’t handle the rapid spotlight after coming out of the villa. Contestants are now very aware of the fame that awaits once the show is over and the fact that their interactions are being aired to the nation. We have a better understanding of how reality tv works and participants are usually on their best behaviour to avoid damaging their image.\n\nI could go on but that’s the basic idea. The producers have to tame down the show to avoid any mental health issues and contestants themselves are more aware of the implications by being in the show.\n\nEven though the premise of finding love in a matter of weeks while being surrounded by attractive single people and facing challenges to stay together is very urealistic. After being locked in a villa for days on end, bonds are created and friendships are born. Personally, I coulnd’t watch the show every night, but it’s interesting as an “express” piece of social psychology. It’s an interest that goes in hand with the 7 Up Series.\n\nI’d like to put my thoughts and experiences into words and make a living out of it. Something challenging with a unique timetable, a job I’m excited to carry out.\n\nCurrently my aim is to get a degree and obtain a driver’s license. I don’t feel to have lost my ambitions in singing or writing, I’m only just starting to properly shape them.\n\nI envy people who post blogs regularly.\n\nInternally I tell myself I have that kind of personality, keeping up with ‘demands’ and writing regular posts. But I guess these aren’t school demands that will be consequently graded, I have no third party pushing me to keep up with deadlines. Writing a blog post is something personal, close to a journal with the awareness of the internet, it’s main and only regular audience is my hardest critic. She will find faults for the piece being too long, lacking substance, research and editing.\n\nI don’t really know what I want to express in this post, I guess the following posts will be muddled lines of thought until I clear myself up and find ‘it’, whatever this may be. Practice makes perfect. I have two weekends left on Erasmus, one of which I’m travelling to Istanbul for Orthodox Easter and the next I’ll be cramming all the work I’ve left due to finals and my hiatus in Turkey.\n\nCompared to last term I’ve travelled a lot more on this second Erasmus. After coming back from Ireland, on my great but maybe we could call it stupid retreat -to be continued?-, I needed an excuse to clear my mind and get away from the halls. Immediately jumping on a plan made by my now very close Polish friend (at the time fellow Erasmus stranger). We travelled to Macedonia and in less than a week I’d visited two new countries, one of which is outside the EU. Being in a non-EU country brought up Brexit making me consider the consequences on the border. We were six foreigners getting lost and walking at least 30 thousand steps a day around Macedonia.\n\nSo who was the dream team for my first Balkan trip of 2019? Skopje, Macedonia, was explored by an American (she keeps a pristine and lovely blog about her journeys and experiences, such a kind person but, enviable all the same when comparing her work to his blog), two Croatian guys (so much fun and their accent/attitude will always make you smile- also great company when travelling the Balkans as they control the culture and most languages), a fellow Spaniard (he was on Erasmus the first term as well) and the lovely Polish girl that managed the whole trip. It was my first time sleeping in a bus station waiting for sunrise, with a noisy casino slot machines tunes on constant replay.\n\nWhich by the way was also my first time gambling, as the casino had the only nearby toilets and you had to play to pee.\n\nI was able to take my mind of the past Erasmus blues and this trip was a great gateway to introduce the Spring Erasmus experience. Other trips included Romania (highlights were Dracula’s castle and nearly getting arrested in the hotel), Greece (definitely have to dedicate a post to my lovely Greece and it’s fabulous food- loved Greece so much I went there whenever I had a chance), Bulgaria (duh) and Turkey.\n\nI remember a time when I thought ‘El dedo de Dios’ was the most fascinating and exotic thing I’d ever see. And even though it didn’t feel like that big of a deal once we visited the infamous rock that looks like God’s finger coming out of the sea, it’s moulded my relationship with travelling and learning to appreciate ‘home’ even more.\n\nTo be fair, I haven’t had time to process we’re going to Turkey. I didn’t really prepare myself for any of the other trips either, life is just a rush to complete assignments, pack and get on the next bus. I’m not complaining, I’ve loved my second Erasmus. In a different way than the first as this time around, it’s felt more like a journey towards career and future prospects. (I don’t think I can ever truly say I’ve changed as a person because lately this seems to be the feeling every other week.)\n\nAUBG has helped me see the great possibilities this world has to offer and with only one year here I feel like my CV has flourished incredibly, I can only imagine all the extra things I could have achieved by participating more in the actual University (rather than partying the first term). If I had another year here I would join some clubs, both for my sanity, as it’s slowly running out since sharing a room in a hall of residence (I need privacy in my bed, a kitchen, the beach; maybe this is why I travelled so much), and to make the most of its unique academic offerings (TEDx, radio club, theatre…). I guess it’s like the door analogy, you go through one and discover there are so many more ahead.\n\nJournalism has become a great interest of mine: searching for new stories, listening regularly to the radio and podcasts, attending conferences and taking notes for potential stories, listening to people and learning to ask the right questions (wish my drunk state would learn to ask less ‘provoking’ questions to the American exchange students).\n\nIt’s soon time for me to say goodbye to AUBG and get a good night’s sleep. My sleeping schedule is way off and my nights are restless as I keep waking up to weird and vivid dreams (this is happening to a few Erasmus students). I wake up exhausted and it’s hard to prepare a healthy breakfast due to the dorm conditions. Meals this term have become a creative battle with the limited elements we’re allowed in the room, as I’ve been avoiding take-away as it drains the wallet and it’s not precisely the healthiest option. But by body is screaming for fish, fresh fruit (cherries, peaches) and veggies, even a good loaf of bread! And cheese, the fancy kind mum gets from the market to eat with tapas or seafood in the evening, gooey tortilla, I could go on.\n\nI need a kitchen and bed. My bed, where I could comfortably lie surrounded by my pillows and blankets, books close by and the smell of paint in the air. Scattered pieces of collages on the floor and a shameless pile of clothes. My guitars at hands reach and music sheets lost in between emotional scribbles. If I woke up with a hangover it was going to be a satisfying one, with the blinds shut as I’d catch up on sleep in bliss.\n\nMy own food. I used to cook a lot back in secondary school in Cádiz.\n\nI miss Cádiz. I used to dislike it at times, but by the last two years I knew I would miss it and I’m glad I made the most of it. It was a lovely place, but I still don’t feel like I belong there, like an intruder trying to make it her home for the lack of one. I still dream of the sunny days, bright blue skies and tall LA like palm trees.\n\nI would cook a lot in Cádiz before moving to the city. I would especially bake and it was only yesterday that I called my parents to thank them for allowing me to make such a mess every two days and spend all their money on sugar and flour. I put myself in their shoes with that one and realised what a physical and ‘calorie-cal’ mess I would make. They allowed me to mess around and grow so much; shame all my interests were either messy or loud, such as the nights spent singing out of tune and repetitively playing the guitar, and paint accidents on clothes and bed sheets.\n\nI was also obsessed with eating healthy and joined all the diets under the sun, making my own milk, Nutella and even eggs. But Madrid and commuting burnt it out of me, even my mum felt uninspired. Now, in Bulgaria, I just want to rush to a market buy fresh ingredients and jam in the kitchen.\n\nI’m excited for Istanbul, and can’t wait to capture the moments and eat the local food. I’ll also be hunting for some Turkish towels because I once lost mums when I was 13 ad shooting a film a about aliens in the park, and I’ve owed it to my mum ever since. I’ll also be experimenting for a Podcasting assignment, by recording the local sounds and interviewing those travelling with me in order to create a travel-documentary podcast. Maybe focused around language and culture, I’m hoping it will build itself naturally as I gather audio.\n\nI’ve also been very busy searching for a job this month, sending out CV’s and contemplating the idea of an Erasmus internship, not wanting to get off this wave I’m on. But at the same time I’d like to relax and plan a summer with friends road-tripping across Spain and nearby countries. Hope Irish makes up his mind and buys tickets.\n\nI envy people that can write coherent posts.\n\n42.017587 23.090790\n\nThat was amusing… I think we just found our answer to why I couldn’t find many Erasmus blogs (especially when it came to Blagoevgrad, Blago for short). I was swept off my feet and completely abandoned this blog immediately, but I don’t think it will be a problem to continue writing in the future as\n\nIt’s New Years soon, and writing more is a good and cliche new years resolution.\n\nI’ll be completing a second term of Erasmus before coming back to my home University for one last year.\n\nSomething tells me I will have more time on my hands next term.\n\nAnother term of Erasmus in Bulgaria awaits until May 2019 and it’ll be interesting because I’ll be going back to the same place I did my Erasmus for the Fall semester but the people I experienced it with wont. This doesn’t include all the Erasmus students, some will be coming back and staying for a whole year, but the students I became close to will all be going back to their home Universities.\n\nThe one thing that surprised me the most about Erasmus and that I hadn’t thought off before heading to Bulgaria is that the experience would be determined by the people more than the place, and that these would be other Erasmus students. Before flying out I thought I would mingle with other students but by the end the people you talk and hang out with the most are other Erasmus. The people I’ve met in Blago truly determined my Erasmus and its going to be weird going back and doing it all again without them. The reason why I chose to do a whole year of Erasmus was because I thought if I loved it I would want to do a full year anyway, and if I hated it I should stick out a whole year until I received something positive from it.\n\nSo I start a blog, I get on the plane to Bulgaria and I arrive in my new university for the next year; to put it briefly. I soon after dumped my boyfriend at the time, a relationship that should have ended at the beginning of the year and had just curdled more sour with each passing month. I feel like I need to emphasise that this relationship did not end due to Erasmus, this might be an excuse he shares because I imagine that I really hurt him and he was already pointing at my exchange as a negative event for our relationship instead of supporting me. My last months with him were hell. Erasmus had been something that I’d always wanted to do and this fact really kept me pushing forward, but I also felt like he was poisoning me to stay. But this was clearly both of our faults because for me we had been declining months ago and I should’ve been stronger and left him when the doubt and misery kicked in, on his half he should’ve stopped being so negative, maybe actually stand up for me or have given me the space I needed to end the relationship because my feelings were definitely not a secret or a surprise to anyone so all this added up to it becoming toxic. Plus many other factors that I can’t be bothered to list right now as it’s in the past.\n\nPoint being I found myself single and Erasmus didn’t cause the breakup it just made it official.\n\nOn my third day there I changed my room to sleep in a flat with the two other Spanish girls and a German. We still live in the residence, but as we had such a friendly relationship our doors were always open and the rooms just felt more like a homely flat compared to all the other shared rooms that we had visited. There are two bedrooms connected by a bathroom, which includes a shower, toilet and two basins; the Spanish girls share one room and I shared the other with the German. Another clarification is that when speaking of the Spanish girls I’m referring to the other two students from my home university who happen to be completing a full year of Erasmus too and I technically would fall into their box coming from the same university and being half Spanish myself, but they just tend to do a lot of things together and most of the time the German is also with them. I guess after a month in Blago I just settled with a different group than them and everyone settled in their own way making closer friends, even though as a whole most of the Erasmus would still drink together and maybe grab dinner in big groups.\n\nIts funny how time works during an exchange and all of us living under the same roof, months would feel like a week but in a week as many things could happen as in a month. Every week would have it’s pattern and groups would slowly shift and change.\n\nIn my case I quickly became friendly with the Irish exchange students and I also liked some of the Dutch which speaking of here’s a small mention to the random Erasmus students that didn’t really mingle with the big-big group but were still very kind and friendly. Even though people say Erasmus is a cliche, you’re going to go out drinking and partying every night, forget the studies, Erasmus Orgasmus, etc. not everybody joined the drinking bandwagon and I find it interesting thinking how different everybody’s exchanges were, including in the big group that would go out the most.\n\nYeah, I did go out a lot and if I wasn’t drinking or talking with someone in the sofas during the evening I would go insane in the residence, but the only time I would go out was if either three or four specific people would join me, because I don’t have a high tolerance for certain drunk personalities and I wouldn’t enjoy myself without them. I’m curious to see how my exchange will be next term without these people because honestly I predict a much calmer night life. Another reason for why as a whole so many Erasmus students would go out a lot was the price difference, Bulgaria is very cheap for us and we can’t even fathom what an Erasmus in a different country would be like.\n\nCocktails or a pasta dish are around 3 to 4 euro, dirty but glorious kebab 2’50, a giant greasy pizza meant for eight but can be attacked by four is less than 5 euro, beers are usually the equivalent of 2 euro, a Corona is 3. You also get used to the Bulgarian prices and if you go out as often as us you will find yourself paying for the cheapest option as the Corona is 6lev but a Tuborg is 2lev. Shout out to Joshua’s bar, open 24/7 and serves strawberry daiquiris that are straight up drunk potions and potential alcoholic-brain freeze for 4 euro. But what I still can’t get my head around is a journey that would cost 20 euro in a Madrid taxi costs one euro in Blago.\n\nI’m sure certain entities in the host university wont be very happy with my whole drinking paragraph, but hey even though we have a rocky relationship with the students in charge of keeping us quite, at least they let us drink without a party permit.\n\nHere’s where I’ll end this long due post, had to start somewhere to get back on track. And if you’re reading this because you’re about to do an Erasmus in Blago, check out Underground you’ll probably go there at least once.\n\nI had a crisis.\n\nIt didn’t last for more than two days, and I guess it wasn’t even that big of a deal, but it was fulled by stressed and caused my mum to go out of her way to help me out, as things usually are.\n\nIt all started when I printed out some Uni papers ready for Bulgaria. Such papers included:\n\nMy timetable for this term\n\nA timetable for the fall 2018 introduction week for new students\n\nHealth Certificate which required filling in\n\nMy acceptance letter\n\nand maybe some other paper, but not as important as they aren’t part of this story.\n\nThe first fishy thing I noticed was that my timetable included courses I hadn’t chosen, and out of the ones I has asked for there was only one on the list. Desperate to avoid spending a year missing out on some of the courses I would have rather taken I e-mailed the school immediately and I’m glad to say the short ending to this story was that AUBG quickly replied and helped me by formulating a better timetable with classes I had asked for, such as Screenwriting.\n\nI did miss out on some courses but I’m not denying I could have avoided this situation by going over my timetable sooner. But the reason why I didn’t do so was because AUBG offers an add/drop week and I thought it would be best to leave the classes as they are (thinking they would be the courses I had chosen, dumb on my half, I know. Always go over everything!) and once I knew what the atmosphere, the classes, the clubs and other time related things such as when can I go to the gym or study… were like; I could design a better timetable for myself. So even though I need at least 1 to 3 more subjects to be safe credit wise for this term, I’ve checked out that some courses I’m interested in, still have a few seats left, so I’ll wait until I arrive to Bulgaria, before I start making any changes.\n\nAnd now the main crisis commences. After I sent my course related e-mail to AUBG, I proceeded to go over my Health Certificate, thinking that it was only going to be some simple questions such as: are you allergic to X, have you ever suffer Y? Turns out that I had to include all my vaccinations and have a doctor sign the paper. And the document specifies that If you don’t give in your HC you’re not allowed to sign your room contract. Being extremely last minute we panicked but got to action, and thanks to a group of amazing people who helped us out from Spain, and my parents for helping me find a doctor, we managed to get all my vaccination dates and a doctors signature.\n\nI wasn’t the only one in this situation, as the girls from my same Uni who are coming with me on this Erasmus journey had also forgotten to go over the HC. I do think that if it’s such a big deal to get a certain vaccination and a doctors signature the Uni must have specified as such in one of their e-mails, but we’ll find out more when we get there.\n\nThe whole hassle made me research injections necessary for traveling around Bulgaria, topic I hadn’t Googled before because many people had told me it wouldn’t be necessary and there were no red flags leading me down that internet rabbit hole. Turns out, there ARE some recommended vaccines… like hepatitis A and rabies. But, like my parents assured me, I’m not going rucksack travelling around Bulgaria but rather living in an accommodation in a city. And the girls that lived there last year, and other people that have travelled there, haven’t mentioned a single word about injections, even when the HC was mentioned in a desperate message through a group chat. So were just going to say, I’ll be safe.\n\nThe next post on this blog will be from the infamous Sofia #sofiainsofia.\n\nWhen I woke up today mum was ready to make the most of it, asking if i’d like to pop in the hairdressers or if there were any last requests. There weren’t and after contemplating my useless skills for deciding we made our way to Tesco. Great last British experience pre-Bulgaria. I’m chuffed with my last minute bought pens and other bits and bobs, mum was even great enough to get me a scale, so there will be baking in Blagoevgrad! We also picked up a few more leva, the Bulgarian currency, which my uncle had so kindly given me a few notes yesterday.\n\nSo after a quick lunch, a final pack and a drive to the airport, just said goodbye to mum, Henry and Edu. It was, I may say, a quick teared but full of emotions farewell. There have been so many steps we’ve had to climb to get me to Bulgaria, that I don’t know if I want to arrive to Blagoevgrad NOW and start living this new experience, or go home and crawl back in to bed. But the suitcases have been made, for the 20th time, farewells and “good lucks” have been said and were finally one step closer to being in a new country with a strange language.\n\nGot to look on the bright Side, sometimes it’s good to have a big blood rush from the unknown. And this is what I signed up, excitement and nerves are in order for events like these.\n\nI’ve always wanted to have a blog and my year abroad to Bulgaria seems like the perfect start for me to finally maintain one.\n\nI can sometimes have a dreamer personality imagining all the possibilities I could reach, but never finding the effort to work dreams into existence. But with time I feel that I’ve become more grounded, and with that spark that urges me to create I have thereby opened up this blog.\n\nAfter two years of studying in Spain a degree in Comunicación Audiovisual (Audiovisual Communication) I’m off to Bulgaria for a year to study abroad as part of the Erasmus program offered by the European Union. I’m really excited to be taking part of this opportunity as It’s always been an aspiration of mine to be able to study a year abroad.\n\nI’ve decided to not categorize this blog because:\n\nI hate labels (let’s be open minded people)\n\nThis will allow me to write more often about anything\n\nCall it a lifestyle blog if you want, if It’s in your deepest desires to put a little label over my precious virtual line of thought. To clarify point two, aside from my new life in Bulgaria, I might include film or book reviews, opinion pieces on a certain topic, or more. The idea is to have no limits and for me to be able to express myself freely to the internet. The blog as a whole is also a personal goal to commit to writing regularly, so as you can guess the no limit part of it all might make the whole process a lot easier.\n\nHonestly I would also love to help out any future AUBG students (American University in Bulgaria, my host university for 2018-2019). I’m guilty of scavenging the internet for any information about my future university, wanting to build in my mind the world I will be living in for the next nine months. I’m curious to know what the classes will be like, the students, the residence halls, the comfort of the bed, how much room do we have, is there a kitchen, are the timetables any good, what about any clubs, where can we travel, buy essentials… I think the whole problem of my overdose of questions lies in the fact that I have been waiting for this moment since February and at this point I cant wait to experience the culture shock and having to move around in a country where I can’t speak the language.\n\nWhen I was given the position in February I didn’t overthink the whole situation, I had a bit of a settled life in Madrid with my family, boyfriend and friends and I was extremely busy with course work from my Spanish University. I could see that the other two girls from my University who are coming to AUBG where a lot more excited, while I wasn’t letting it properly sink in until the time to leave was a lot closer. And here I am, excited, scared, nervous, springy, and packing “a lot of suitcase”.\n\nAh, the suitcase, a whole situation of it’s own. Maybe when I arrive I could write a post about packing because I know it was one of the topics I was desperate to learn more about before leaving: what to pack, how much to pack, will I miss this, should I take that, how many shoes…\n\nOn this note I’m off to finish a bit packing and going to enjoy my English holiday.\n\nSophia\n\nIdeas that have popped up, during the writing of this entry, for the future: what am I studying?, my life background, something about feminism, which is the best flavour of can soda?\n\n53.488845 -3.017114"
