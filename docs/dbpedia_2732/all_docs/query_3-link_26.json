Welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Results Presentation of Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n. I'm Mario Sacedo, Head of Investor Relations. Let me introduce you to today's speakers. The presentation will be hosted by Massimo Musolino, General Operations Manager. The presentation will be followed with a Q&A session, where Massimo Musolino; Quico Alum, PubliespaÃ±a General Manager; and Javier UrÃ­a, the Group Chief Financial Officer, will answer all your questions. Massimo, you have the floor. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [2] ------------------------------ Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Mediaset EspaÃ±a's 9-months' 2018 results presentation, where we cover the main aspects of the figures released to the market a few minutes ago. I would like to quickly go over the key points now and then move on to the Q&A session. On Slide #2 (sic) [Slide #4], you have a brief summary of the main aspects from the third quarter of the year. Our leadership in audience was confirmed with 28.7%, achieving a 2.4 percentage point gap in total individuals from July to September against our main competitor. Total net revenues amounted EUR 188.6 million, while EBITDA for the quarter was EUR 34.5 million, a remarkable 12.3% growth against same period of last year. According to Infoadex, this better-than-peers performance allowed Mediaset EspaÃ±a to post a market share gain of 24 basis points, to 43.8% in the third quarter of the year. Finally, earnings per share also grew in the period by 6.4%. On Slide 3 (sic) [Slide 5], you can find the same set of figures but accumulated for the period January to September. As we mentioned before, the audience share leadership position was confirmed. Infoadex figures on the evolution of the Spanish advertising market gave Mediaset EspaÃ±a market share of 43.7%, which implies 33 basis points more than last year, extending the gap on the second market player to 2.8 percentage points. Revenues and margins remained stable as some of the highest in the industry. EBITDA margin was 27.8% and EBIT margin was 26.1%. Net profit through September amounted to EUR 146.9 million, while earnings per share were EUR 0.45. Finally, free cash flow surpassed EUR 181.8 million, generating a net cash position at the end of the period close to EUR 130 million. Let's now move on the business performance section on Slide 4 (sic) [Slide 7]. You can -- you have here, the TV consumption figure for the first 9 months of 2018, which confirmed the general trend of viewers continuing to watch linear TV. TV consumption remained stable in the first 9 months of the year, just 3 minutes (sic) [5 minutes] less than same period of 2017. This number reinforce our view about the relevance of offering the right content, which is our main aim. Roughly, 4 hours per day a viewer remains the central and stable scenario for the Spanish TV market, we discerned more ups and down depending of many different factors, such as market condition, weather, timing, launching of new programs, sport events, et cetera. But in any case, these more variations allow us to confirm that viewer behavior is not changing. For example, I'd like to remind you of pre-crisis figure in 2007 when the TV market achieved its highest share in the history of Spanish TV and Telecinco also achieved its best results. If you look at the TV consumption figures back then and compare them to now, nothing has changes. Viewers ha been consuming the same amount of TV now as they were in the pre-crisis period, the difference being that there is now a lot more competition, there are more channels, Internet, digital, OTT platform, but the viewers are still with us. The message we want to convey is TV is still alive and kicking. Talking about audience share in 2018, as you can see on Slide 5 (sic) [Slide 8], we maintained our leadership position in line with our objectives. On a group level, Mediaset EspaÃ±a reached a share of 29%, with an advantage of 2.4 percentage points over its main competitor. Also, in terms of share for main channels, Mediaset EspaÃ±a consolidated its leadership, with Telecinco channel reaching 14%, which is 1.8 percentage points (sic) [1.7 percentage points] above the second channel. This figure was confirmed with October's audience, where Telecinco improved its share to 14.9%, which represented 2.4 percentage points more than the second channel in the market. The figures achieved through September were remarkable with a commercial target of 51.1%, 3 percentage points higher than the second player and 0.5 points higher than last year. In terms of programs, the penalty shootout in the Spain versus Russia World Cup game was the event with the highest number of viewers since July 2012, with 14.8 million people and an audience share above 80%. Moving on to Slide 6 (sic) [Slide 9], let me elaborate on some of our achievement in the digital arena during the first 9 months of 2018. Monthly unique users amounted on average to 11.7 million with more than 1.6 billion videos viewed up to August, which makes Mediaset EspaÃ±a the sixth player in the market after the world giants. New initiatives such as our YouTube channel reached an outstanding figure of more than 200 million views since it was launched in April. At the same time, digital native content added 6.6 million monthly average unique browsers. As a result, Internet advertising revenue went up by 26.8% through September compared to the same period of last year. And we would also like to remind you that, according to Infoadex figures, the 9-month Internet advertising market grew by 12.8%, which is less than our -- the growth posted by Mediaset EspaÃ±a. Moving now on to Slide 7 (sic) [Slide 10]. Over the last few months, we have been working on new initiatives for optimizing our business model. In this sense, we have just launched MediterrÃ¡neo, in a structure that combines all our equity companies that produce audio, visual and digital content under the same brand and distribution network. With this operation, we create one of the most important Spanish audio-visual conglomerate of national production companies with more experience in diversified content, such as entertainment, fiction, cinema, sporting events, digital native formats and brand development. This is a great moment for audio-visual content producers, due to the proliferation of new opportunities such as new channels and distribution platforms in Spain and abroad. The number of potential clients and generally speaking the demand of quality audio-visual content is increasing. I must also mention the prestigious and the professional recognition that Spanish audio-visual productions have gained around the world, with fiction, entertainment programs and movies, all of which have been growing in the last few years, opening new horizons both nationally and internationally for our content. This can be seen by the substantial increase in income related to this activity, along with national and international expansion of sales of our product. For example, we have managed to sell our fiction product during this year to 190 countries. With all this in mind, the fact that we have been able to bring together all of our productive capacity under a single branded distribution network will surely be a factor that makes the development for this activity much easier in the future. For Slide 8 (sic) [Slide 11], I will elaborate a little bit more on the far -- on the future with couple of relevant topics. First, LOVEStv, our hybrid broadband TV, which after a test environment period, is going to be launched on a large scale on 21st of November. Our estimate of TV sets with HbbTV capability in Spain is currently close to 2 million units and constantly growing, which brings a clear business opportunity in the future, both in terms of additional content offering and the possibility of putting in place customized campaigns for advertisers, thanks to the management of the data. Also, in August, immediately after the end of the World Cup, we announced the acquisition of the Euro 2020 exclusive rights. The broadcasting of this championship will lead to a perfect tandem between the programming and commercial strategy, bringing us the possibility of the capturing all the effort together with (inaudible) in the year 2020 due to the relevance and exclusiveness of this event. Thanks to the magnificent commercial and economic result achieved by the World Cup, we didn't waste any time finalizing the acquisition. And now let's move into the financial section. Let's start on Slide 9 (sic) [Slide 13] with a quick review of our advertising revenues performance in the first 9 months of the year. Mediaset EspaÃ±a gross advertising revenues remain stable at EUR 687.1 million, while the third quarter figure was EUR 184.8 million. Moving to Slide 10 (sic) [Slide 14], where we have the evolution of our TV advertising revenue during the 9-month period to September. Although we posted a small 1% volume decline to September, mainly because of the weak performance in the last 2 weeks of the summer season, the active price management, with a remarkable plus 3.3% in the third quarter, allowed us to achieve the TV advertising revenues in line with last year's figure, EUR 658.5 million. Quico Alum will elaborate on this point during the Q&A section. These figures outperformed the total TV advertising market growth from January to September, where, according to Infoadex publications, it declined by 1.3 percentage points, while Mediaset EspaÃ±a posted a mere 0.5% difference against last year. In this context, as we mentioned earlier, TV advertising market share reached 43.7%, which implies 33 basis points up against last year and, as usual, makes Mediaset EspaÃ±a leader of the market in terms of advertising revenues with a gap of 2.8 percentage points against the second market player, in line with the objective that we set at the beginning of the year. On Slide 11 (sic) [Slide 15] we provide an OpEx breakdown. Operating expenses remained stable against last year, to EUR 502.8 million. As we mentioned in our last results presentation, the increasing weight of World Cup sport content explains the 20.2% decline in the consumption of third-party rights to Spanish fiction, EUR 22 million less than last year. It's clear that the broadcast of the World Cup caused structural changes to our programming grid, given that 64 games were broadcasted between Telecinco, Cuatro and BeMad. This (inaudible) based performance of the period is remarkable, first due to costs incurred by the World Cup event broadcasted, and second because it was achieved with a successful audience share evolution. This growth speaks volumes about how we manage costs in an attentive manner, improving the quality of the content and meeting the audience demands. On Slide 12 (sic) [Slide 16], you can see the evolution of Mediaset EspaÃ±a margin in September. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew by 12.3%, to EUR 34.5 million. These numbers represented a margin expansion of 240 basis points in the period. On an accumulated basis until September, adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 193.7 million, down 2.6% against the same period last year; while our EBITDA margin reached 27.8%, which remains robust thanks to the active business management, both top line and the aforementioned operating cost discipline. Slide 13 (sic) [Slide 17], you can find the net income figure for the 9-month period, which increased by 0.6% against last year, to EUR 146.9 million. Again, this is the highest net income recorded in the third quarter since the year 2008. Earnings per share went up by 0.6% to EUR 0.45 per share through September. The cash conversion remains one of the highest in the industry, reaching 93.9% of free cash flow-EBITDA ratio. Let me finish with a few final remarks and an outlook update of the last quarter of this year on the Slide 14 (sic) [Slide 19]. The first 9 months of 2018 were a positive, successful and profitable period despite the challenging market conditions. We are on course to achieving all the objectives that we set ourselves and presented to the market for this year. Our business performance reflects again the cost discipline applied in an environment of strong audience share and reinforced our leadership position both in advertising revenues market share, with the aforementioned 33 basis points market share gain, and EBITDA profitability was close to 28%, with a 3.4% earnings per share growth. A now a few words regarding the last quarter, which has had a very good start in terms of audience, with the magnificent start to the season driven by the huge success of Celebrity Big Brother, The Good Doctor and our Spanish fiction, Vivir Sin Permiso, along with daytime's optimum results. We can therefore look at the fourth quarter with optimism in terms of continuing audience leadership. The last quarter also began well, commercially speaking, registering a slight positive month of October and an encouraging start to November. Also, regarding new business areas, we can also confirm our expectation about digital revenues, with an expected growth rate above 20% for the whole year. Our latest film, SuperlÃ³pez, will premiere in cinema in the next few weeks, which we hope will positively contribute to this quarter results. And now talking about cost. On the basis of the 9-months' cost figures, we can now update our cost guidance for 2018. Up until September, our costs were the same as last year. We see no reason for the fourth quarter to be any different and see no reason to spend more than last year in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we update our cost guidance to EUR 740 million for the year, which is the same amount that we spent last -- in the year 2017. This figure is not based on future estimates or actions, but is the result of the cost management discipline and substitution cost achieved in the first 9 months of the year 2018. Finally, we also maintain our main aim to preserve the leading position both in term of audience and advertising market share, as too for solid and profitable growth. And now let's move to the Q&A. ------------------------------ Mario Sacedo Arriola, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - Head of IR [3] ------------------------------ Thank you, Massimo. This is end of our presentation. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please we can proceed to open the Q&A section. ============================== Questions and Answers ------------------------------ Operator [1] ------------------------------ (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question from Chris Johnen from HSBC. ------------------------------ Christopher Johnen, HSBC, Research Division - Analyst [2] ------------------------------ First, of course, on current trading, you said that the month of October was slightly positive. Can you remind us on the comps you're having in the last quarter, particularly maybe also around the Black Friday last year, just so we have a better idea of where you stand month-by-month? Then, second question on your online revenues, I know you probably don't want to -- still don't want to disclose the absolute figure, I'm just trying to understand, at what sort of size would you reconsider that, how big would that need to be for you to consider changing disclosure? And then, a question again on -- I asked this last quarter -- on sort of synergies or working together with Mediaset. Has actually anything changed in the last quarter in terms of more collaboration, whether it's on the content side or on the tech side, is there -- has there anything changed for this last quarter? That's my third question. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [3] ------------------------------ Okay. About the market for the last quarter. As you know, as according to Infoadex, the market in the third Q had fallen by 1.9%, and it was an expected decrease due to the negative impact that we have mainly in the month of September at the end of the month. But we think -- or we know already, because October is over, then we break the strength, and we see in October a slightly positive month. And as you also say, in November, we have at the end of November, the Black Friday, result still have in progress, it's not over yet, but we believe that November would follow the same pace of October. We have already trying to close or terminate some investments that we are should take timing at the end of the November and for that we feel that will -- to feel optimistic about November, I think, that we'll follow the trend that we have seen in October. And also we lack some information about the celebrity show but we believe that we don't have any reason to change that trend that we see in October and we hope that we will see in November so that at the end of this quarter, we think that we're going to meet a positive quarter. I don't know exactly the number, but -- because we are working month by month, but, I think, the positive news is that we were really worried about September, but in October, we didn't have change and we find -- we found another positive month in October. And in November we have the Black Friday and in December we have the Christmas. Then, not really -- we don't expect to have any change or any bad surprise in the market. In terms of the relationship between Mediaset EspaÃ±a and Mediaset Italia, it has always been a very good relationship. In this year, for example, we have produced together a fiction between Italy and Spain, which will be broadcasted probably next year. We have a frequent meeting with them, talking about technology, about the evolution of the business. I know you remember that more than 50% of our board is made by Mediaset Italia members, so they participate into the definition of the strategy of the company. Also this year, we have created, together with Mediaset Italia, ProSieben and TF1, an advertising company in London, with the objective to recover part of the international budget of the main Internet companies, Internet client, a good -- a big client that -- for a land manager, for use of all the advertising budget. So let's say, it is a normal relationship between a company and its main shareholder. Our other digital revenues, our goal for this -- for this year was to increase Internet revenues by more than 30% in 2018, and at this point we are on track to achieve this target. And we can say that our total revenues at the end of this year will be around EUR 22 million. ------------------------------ Operator [4] ------------------------------ We'll now take our next question from Annick Maas from Exane. ------------------------------ Annick Tonie Maas, [5] ------------------------------ My first question is on the positive October and November and December actually. Is this pricing driven, volume driven or what is the driver of the positive quarter? The second one is if you could give us pricing for Q3 adjusted for the World Cup effect? And thirdly, if you could just tell us how we should think about costs in 2019 and, whichever number you will give me, is that a number that has lots of potential for further reduction like this year basically, for further EUR 30 million reduction, or is that really the maximum cost that you think you can spend? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [6] ------------------------------ Okay, about November, the driver will be, obviously, be in the price, the price increase. In the third Q, we have increased -- risen our price by 3.3%, and our goal is to keep the strength. I mean, it's our goal. We'll have to maintain that, and we have not closed all the agreements with the clients, but I think it's really important for us, in general for commercial TVs, to increase our prices, because we have -- I think we have room for that because the price of the TV is still low in terms of the product we are delivering to our clients. Now I think we have room to use this price, and the pricing is, what, 3.3%? We hope -- we expect that we are going to maintain that similar trend, and at the end of year we'll see that, but it's our-- our strategy is that. And about -- I mean, the revenues, the increase in revenues, it will be coming from price increase. ------------------------------ Annick Tonie Maas, [7] ------------------------------ My other question was on pricing for Q3, if you could just give us an idea what pricing would have been if you adjust for the World Cup effect? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [8] ------------------------------ The impact in the price increase by the World Cup. I don't have here this figure, but definitely, it's around less than 1 point, I think, is in the miss, because in the third quarter the World Cup was just 2 weeks in July, the first 2 weeks of July. I think the impact in the prices, I think, is less than 1 point, I don't have exactly the figure here, like, I can't tell you, but it's around that. I mean we can say that -- without World Cup, our price increase would be 2 points and some -- I don't know exactly this number, I don't have here. I don't have here. [Talking about] the cost. During this year, there is no reduction with respect to last year in our cost line. The reduction is really straight to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. Why? Because when we started the year, we were in mind -- we had in mind a different advertising market trend. So we prepared a budget with a stronger programming grid and plus the World Cup, plus investment in the channel Cuatro, trying to increase its profile and grow the share. During the year, given the strength of the advertising market, we only have changed our programming grid. Honestly, we also have in the pocket, Plan B, in our programming grid. So we, during the first 9 months, this amount, we have been changing some program especially with the other cheaper. And this is why this year we have been able to contain costs at the same level of last year. Respect to the next year, we are now preparing the budget for the year 2019. As every year, at the beginning of the year, we will give you the guidance, but as usual, we prefer to give you data approved by our board. So we are still building this number, and when we -- our board will approve it, we will communicate to you. ------------------------------ Operator [9] ------------------------------ We will now take our next question from Richard Eary from UBS. ------------------------------ Richard Eary, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Head of European Media Team [10] ------------------------------ Just 2 questions actually for myself. One is, if you look at the cash on the balance sheet now, EUR 129 million, and obviously, again, good cash flow generation, how do we think about capital management as we go into the end of this year, what are your thoughts on that? The second thing is, just to come back to an earlier question, in terms of collaboration and further cost synergies, can you maybe just, a little bit, elaborate in terms of what potential cost synergies are in the business if you were to co-share formats, et cetera, so we can have a better think of it in terms of what other costs can come out of the business to sustain the programming investment? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [11] ------------------------------ The first point of the cash that we have at the end of September, which is close to EUR 130 million. We have a free cash flow generation for EUR 181 million, which is very close to the one we had last year. So normally the main -- the final line of this number will be to receive the dividend at the end of the year. So, other than that, we don't have any -- we don't have any other plans. We could have considered, like as in the case in the last years, to have a buyback plan in place, but of course, in order to do that we have sales are allocated -- we have we need to have that volume, you need to have material impact there, something we don't have. So what we intend to do is, as we have been doing last year, is to build up this cash, and at the end of the day to arrive at a number which is close to the net profit and use that to distribute an (inaudible) dividend. In terms of collaboration synergies in MediterrÃ¡neo -- I think that the question is about MediterrÃ¡neo -- I think that there are not many synergies in cost, the greatest opportunity is revenue. Let me try to elaborate this point. What we have seen during this year is that the market has changed. There are many potential clients in Spain and outside Spain that can be interested in our content. Just to give you the trend, which is, in my opinion, really clear, we had revenues of over EUR 7 million gross in 2014, EUR 9 million in 2015, EUR 11 million in 2016, EUR 16 million in 2017 and this year we are going to increase this value. So we see the trend -- this trend that there are always a bigger market for our content. What we have at the same time observed is that this activity of selling content wasn't, let's say, coordinate. So what do -- we try now is to organize a stronger distribution force to sell all the formats that our production company produces. Only this year, just to give you more comment, one of these companies has sold a series fiction to HBO, another company has sold another fiction to TelevisiÃ³n EspaÃ±ola. There is a couple production projects; we did Nestle, between Mediaset EspaÃ±a and Nestle, to produce a fiction series. So we see the market growing. So the objective of this project is to join all our participating companies under the same brand, with the objective to optimize increasing the distribution revenues. ------------------------------ Richard Eary, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Head of European Media Team [12] ------------------------------ If I just ask a follow-on, obviously, you got EUR 16 million in '17, if you we were to look forward, let's say, 3 years, are you optimistic you can double that number from EUR 16 million? Or is that just playing it down? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [13] ------------------------------ There is -- it is difficult to say, but it's clear that the trend is that these -- there are more opportunities -- and many opportunities outside, and we are organized, all of our factories, to take -- to benefit of this situation. There is another aspect that we should consider, that in the Mediterraneo there is also Telecinco Cinema. So every year, Telecinco Cinema produce from 3 to 5 movies and not -- each movie has a different budget, a different -- all of them have different sizes. So it also depends on the number of movies and if they are national or international project to define this amount. We can proceed with the next question, please. ------------------------------ Operator [14] ------------------------------ Our next question comes from Laurie Davison from Deutsche Bank. ------------------------------ Laurence Davison, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [15] ------------------------------ First question, you've previously said you couldn't cut OpEx below EUR 750 million on a reoccurring basis. On your full-year call last year, you elaborated that you've been through quite extensive cost cutting and that was the floor. So is this a -- can we think about any further scope for ongoing cost cutting in the business when we're looking out 2019, 2020 and so on, or have we really reached the floor at EUR 740 million? Second question, can you just elaborate on Caribevision tax impact in the quarter that you note in your release? Third, how do you feel about consensus 1.5% to 2% ad growth for the full year? After your third quarter, that implies 7% for the fourth quarter, so I'd just be interested in your thoughts on whether October, November warrant that type of forecast? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [16] ------------------------------ About the cost bases, I said -- I still think that EUR 760 million is more or less the base, the cost base of a group like Mediaset EspaÃ±a. Then there are (inaudible), which is some programs obtains very good audience share results, so you can save some more expensive program or move forward this program, so saving money. So is this the floor? If it isn't, it is not very distant for the real floor. It's clear that to reduce a lot of this amount means to totally change the model of our television. At the end of the day, 70%, 75% of our costs are in the programming grid. So if we are able to produce a lower cost, something is possible to reduce. Let's consider that this year all our main programs have performed well, so we haven't changed it for bad results and this is -- when we give a guidance, we don't consider 100% of success of all the programs. So when we maintain more reserve for just in case we have to change, to suspend and change some program. This is the situation. Sorry, just as well -- it's clear, one thing, we are not having any inflation in our costs. Sometimes I read that inflation costs the -- to air broadcasters is due to the entrance of new players; no influence of inflation by the moment. On the tax impact, I guess, you might have seen that there's an increase in the tax rate at the end of September versus last year. You're right, there is an impact, a new tax rate, and the tax rate we have at the end of September is what we expect to have at the end of the year and it's higher than the one we had last year. Two things here. First of all, this is a one-off, nobody should take this new rate as next year or in the following years, because there is impact of sale of our stake in the company that we have sold in the States, in Caribevision. The impact of that sale was that, due to legislative changes in Spain, when you have losses on the sale of an agreed participation, which was exactly the case here, we have tax rights we have lost, there was a series of retroactive measures, in the sense that such losses could not be made deductible and with this very complicated system of retroactivity here, at the end of the day, we found that there was a tax deduction for that particular sale which was not applicable. And that's why we had negative impact here and that negative impact has had an impact on the tax rate. Again, this tax rate of 23-point-something percent is what we expect to have at the end of the year, and secondly, it's not the tax rate normalized going forward, because it is impacted by this one-off sale of our stake in Caribevision. ------------------------------ Mario Sacedo Arriola, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - Head of IR [17] ------------------------------ This is Mario. Just to clarify your second question, when you are talking about the 2% consensus for market growth, are you talking for the whole year? For the Q4? ------------------------------ Laurence Davison, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [18] ------------------------------ For the full year. ------------------------------ Mario Sacedo Arriola, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - Head of IR [19] ------------------------------ I don't know, sorry about that, what is the source of that consensus. Yes, we are collecting every single quarter, the estimates on a quarterly basis and yearly basis and we have distributed all of them and on all the contributors, which today are more than 70% of the sell-side analysts. And the consensus that they have for the whole year is 0.7%. ------------------------------ Laurence Davison, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [20] ------------------------------ Okay, so if we put in 0.7% then that implies a fourth quarter up 4%, do you feel comfortable with that? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [21] ------------------------------ Okay, I mean, it could be, it could not be. Because the problem with that, is we have about 2% more percent of 3% is that we are talking about really a small amount of investment. I think 1% in the last quarter could be EUR 6 million, that means this really is not a lot of money then -- it's impossible to say this exactly, but it could be 2%, 1%, 3%, it could be, but in this moment I cannot tell you one exact figure, I will -- I mean I don't have enough information to say that. But -- sorry for that, I can't say -- I would like to be able to say -- to tell you that 2%, 3%, 1%, but I don't have this information, because I mean if one, I don't know, [big] client move a lot of money, then it can change the figure at the end of the quarter and I am lacking some information for the last part of the November and of course for December. ------------------------------ Laurence Davison, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [22] ------------------------------ No, that's very useful, at least you've given us a range, that helps. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [23] ------------------------------ I guess, there is no more questions, waiting, is that correct, operator? ------------------------------ Operator [24] ------------------------------ Yes, it appears there are no further questions in the queue. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - MD of Management & Operations and Executive Director [25] ------------------------------ Okay. Well, if no, thank you for the conference call. Thank you very much for attending our presentation. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact the Investor Relations Department. Goodbye. ------------------------------ Quico Alum, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - General Manager of PubliespaÃ±a [26] ------------------------------ Bye-bye. ------------------------------ Mario Sacedo Arriola, Mediaset EspaÃ±a ComunicaciÃ³n, S.A. - Head of IR [27] ------------------------------ Bye. ------------------------------ Definitions ------------------------------ PRELIMINARY TRANSCRIPT: \"Preliminary Transcript\" indicates that the Transcript has been published in near real-time by an experienced professional transcriber.
