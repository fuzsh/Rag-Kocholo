        "text": "After years of stable oligopoly, the main television broadcasters in Spain began to note changes in the market in the middle of the last decade. The emergence of new networks, the relaunch of digital terrestrial television (DTT), the boom in specialized channels and the proliferation of platforms such as online and mobile TV, which allow the broadcast of audiovisual contents, forced broadcast managers to change their strategy in relation to business models and production companies. The analysis in this article centres on two main points: on one hand, the transformation effected in the television industry by the advent of digitalization; and on the other hand, the role of networks in the new media environment. In April 2010, the Spanish broadcast system completed its transition from analogue to digital broadcasting and a new digital age dawned, marked by disruptive technologies and multimedia policies.\n\nThe arrival of over-the-top (OTT) players in Spain’s media market has resulted in the importation of the successful business models of pay-TV from the United States. However, the origin, historical development and regulation of the TV market in Spain mean that its TV ecosystem is substantially different from the US market. This article aims to verify whether the powerful industry of free-to-air private TV, led by Atresmedia and Mediaset, will prevent OTT media business models from being implemented in the short term or whether, on the contrary, these convergent players will pose a threat to the traditional TV broadcasting model.\n\nIntroduction. The landscape of the audiovisual market has dramatically changed over the last thirty years, and even more so since the implementation of digital terrestrial television throughout Europe. New suppliers of audiovisual content have appeared and a range of pay-per-view and free-to-air services now compete against one another. Methodology. After all the changes, we wonder if there is still space for pay TV and how the strategy of pay TV operators might be developed. To do so, we will analyse current offerings according to three key factors: business models based on revenue and offering, clients, and competitors. Conclusions. After data analysis, we conclude that in spite of the threats to pay television operators, pay TV will be the engine of change, and the willingness to pay will increase. Most of the popular free-to-air contents, will become premium content\n\nOver the last decade, the private television market in Spain has gone through a paradigmatic model of duopoly between two large corporations, Atresmedia and Mediaset, both forged out of two major mergers: that of Telecinco with Cuatro, and that of Antena 3 with La Sexta. We intended to analyze the change that the private television sector has undergone in our country since that double merger and how the content and audiences of the four channels have evolved. We resorted to a methodological triangulation of historical-systemic review, content analysis and comparative method. One of the most interesting conclusions drawn from the investigation has been the discovery that Mediaset has turned Cuatro into an almost mimetic channel and subsidiary of Telecinco, while Atresmedia has largely respected the differentiation of its two main channels: Antena 3 and La Sexta TV.\n\nThe audiovisual entertainment business is undergoing a key moment due to several reasons: the Internet boom, its convergence with television, the prominence of the user as well as the digitalization of the production and distribution processes. Although this phenomenon was initially originated by technological factors, its consequences affect to the whole audiovisual industry and, more specifically, to the very core of the business—contents. In this context, fiction and entertainment contents must be developed since its first stage for a multimedia and interactive consumption in order to be enjoyed by the audience on a wide range of platforms. From this perspective, successful contents demands capability to be multi-platform distributed and customized by the consumer. In this regard, its interactive options, its potential to create a prestigious brand and a profitable business model, and, last but not least, its power to tell an original transmedia story. This chapter tries to figure out the most innovative trends in production, distribution and commercialization of multi-platform contents in the case of the main television networks in Spain. In this sense, we are presenting a comparative analysis of their different multi-platform strategies following a two-step methodology: firstly, a descriptive study of their respective websites, online players, mobile apps and social networks’ profiles; secondly, questionnaires to the multimedia managers of the chief networks together with some personal interviews. The preliminary results of this research prove that, in the Spanish case, the convergence of television and the Internet is revolutionizing the production and commercialization of audiovisual contents, although it is also clear that is still in a challenging first stage.\n\nTelefónica became a private company in the 1990s, and since the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, it has operated in the most competitive local market in Europe. The company has tried to compensate for the loss of hegemony in its country with a strong position in other European and Latin American markets. Among its diversification projects, following in the footsteps of AT&T, its attempt to transform itself into a global TV company stands out. This article analyzes the evolution that this Spanish company has undergone in the last 30 years. The most relevant factor in its role as a pay-TV service provider is that it has been forced to face a substantial economic outlay to have original content and a position of supremacy in the purchase of sports broadcasting rights. Our results indicate that today two visions coexist within Telefónica: One committed to maintaining a pay-TV model, and another that considers that paid content should occupy a secondary role, limiting itself to being a mere platform aggregator, after forming continuous alliances with Netflix, Disney+, and DAZN.\n\nThis article compares the processes by which Netflix entered national pay-television markets in Israel and Spain. In both contexts, Netflix first establishes itself through collaborations with over-the-top (OTT) television operators and then expands through collaborations with legacy providers. By using the perspective of cross-national comparative research, this analysis complicates the scholarly understandings of subscription video on-demand (SVOD) global expansion by drawing attention to the significance of national multichannel providers. Given the differences between the Spanish and Israeli pay-TV markets, Netflix's similar pattern of engagement in each case highlights the value of understanding SVOD global expansion as a coherent industrial process that produces distinct, context-dependent outcomes. Ultimately, the histories of Netflix in Israel and Spain reveal that internationalization operates at a meso-level where collaborations with pay-television providers facilitate access to national audiences.\n\nThis article explores the changes of the Spanish television industry upon the arrival of the international Subscription Video on Demand (SVoD) platforms and how Spain has become a noticeable player in the international market. To analyze the hybridization of the industry, a content analysis of the Spanish catalog of SVoD services has been conducted to evaluate the offerings of local series. To further exemplify the current complex relationships among traditional broadcasters, independent producers, and SVoD platforms, an analysis of the evolution of the series The Ministry of Time and Money Heist (two of the most internationally successful Spanish shows) in terms of production, distribution, and cultural trades, reveals the different types of agreements with SVoD players and the balance between the international and domestic markets. Results also indicate the importance of the Spanish geolinguistic market for the success of Spanish series even as the popularity of its shows has transcended the language borders.\n\nYouTube has tripled in recent years its ability to attract advertisers and has become a tough competitor for television. Given this progress, one of the main strategies by traditional television focuses on gaining prominence in the social network, something they do mainly through the content related to their series, but with a not too thorough strategy. This piece of research analyzes a total of 237 relevant YouTube videos on Spanish series produced by the major television networks: Antena 3, Telecinco and TVE, through a both quantitative and qualitative study that delves into issues such as the management of comments and encouragement of participation. The results suggest that broadcasters do not exploit the possibilities of YouTube as a tool of social media to generate commitment and loyalty."
