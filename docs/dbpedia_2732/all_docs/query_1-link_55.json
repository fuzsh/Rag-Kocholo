        "text": "The first block of this collective work includes research on some of the public broadcasters that make up the autonomous Spanish panorama. First, a historical review of the major academic studies that have tried their development and evolution (Luis Albornoz and Azahara Cañedo) is presented. Then a study on the situation of the Basque public television is offered through an analysis of its management model, governance, programming and economic situation (Miguel Angel Casado and Juan Carlos Miguel). Then, María Isabel Villa presents a study on the effects of the economic crisis and technological change in the Catalan Corporation of Audiovisual Media. The situation of the Society of Radio Television of Galicia (CRTVG) is analyzed in the current context of the crisis and technological implementation by Ana Isabel Rodriguez, Tania Silva and Fernández Alba. Telemadrid case is analyzed with graphical, statistical and financial support, in the period from 2000 to 2014 by José Vicente García and José María Pérez. Ramón Reig offers an approach to the structure and content of public television through Canal Sur TV case. This block closes with the study of the birth and structure of Radio Television of the Principality of Asturias (RTPA) by José Ramón Pérez Ornia. The second part of this book deals with the study of the crisis of Radio Television Valenciana (RTVV) with five works dedicated to further the causes and consequences of their closure. Juan José Bas delves into the genesis of RTVV model. Miquel Francés explores the consequences of the closure of RTVV for audiovisual production sector in valencia community, characterized by the lack of industry consolidation and regularization of their activity. The analysis of the case of local television Elche, TeleElx, is approached by Jose Luis Gonzalez, Isabel Gonzalez and Jose Alberto Garcia. The case of the territorial delegation of RTVV in Castellon, examined by Longi Gil, identifies some symptoms that have led to the closure of the entity. Finally, Sonia Ramos González and Fatima Ramos show the results of analysis of the debate emerged on Twitter following the closure of RTVV, around different stakeholders of Valencia.\n\nThis article analyses the presence of large-scale transnational communication groups in the Spanish television industry through an analysis of several television markets: free-to-air television (both nationwide and autonomous regional channels), independent production, pay television and the production of thematic channels. In order to do this, we detail the quantitative presence of the leading players in the field and, complementing this with an approach from the social network analysis, we outline the commercial relationships between them. To this quantitative dimension, we add an exploration of the strategies employed by these groups in accessing the market, examining the typology of their presence and the relative positions of strength of each one of the groups detected. Amongst our conclusions, we stress the growing internationalisation of the television industry in Spain and we note the differences observed within different groups in relation to their country of origin.\n\nSince 2012, Spanish legislation has authorized the regional governments to choose their own model of management for their regional television channels. This freedom to decide has allowed the creation of a new, unprecedented television model, namely indirectly-managed regional public service, based on outsourcing content creation. This new modality has been adopted by the Autonomous Community of the Region of Murcia, which is the first government to develop an initiative of this nature. This article proposes, on the one hand, to study the regulatory reform of regional public television in Spain, and on the other, to analyze how this reform has affected the creation of the management model used for the regional public television, 7RM. The academic work on this topic is scarce. The research methods used are mainly an analysis of legal and official documents, which are specifically supported by bibliographic sources related to the subject matter.\n\nYouTube has tripled in recent years its ability to attract advertisers and has become a tough competitor for television. Given this progress, one of the main strategies by traditional television focuses on gaining prominence in the social network, something they do mainly through the content related to their series, but with a not too thorough strategy. This piece of research analyzes a total of 237 relevant YouTube videos on Spanish series produced by the major television networks: Antena 3, Telecinco and TVE, through a both quantitative and qualitative study that delves into issues such as the management of comments and encouragement of participation. The results suggest that broadcasters do not exploit the possibilities of YouTube as a tool of social media to generate commitment and loyalty.\n\nTelevisión del Principado de Asturias (TPA) is a regional public television that has been operating in Spain since 2005 by outsourcing part of its broadcasting activities. From the perspective of the political economy of communication and culture, this article studies the evolution of TPA's outsourcing model, taking into account the production of news content. The time of the analysis extends from the start of its broadcasting to its last tender in this respect, in 2016. Initially, with the goal of promoting the regional audiovisual sector, TPA implemented a contracting model divided into content batches that were allocated to various companies, mostly regional. By doing so, the activities of production were distributed into different territorial areas. However, after the economic crisis of 2008, the confluence of several factors (economic austerity measures, the political change in the regional government and a torrent of lawsuits for illegal transfer of workers) changed the outsourcing model. Currently, the complete activity of production is concentrated on a sole tenderer, which is part of an audiovisual conglomerate at the national level, selected because of proposing the most advantageous economic offer. This has represented a reduction in the diversity of sources of production contracted and the triumph of an economic mind-set over social benefit and public service in the socioeconomic contexts of austerity.\n\nIn recent years, the public media system in Spain has been undergoing a series of changes that are having a notable effect on its structure. In October 2012, the regional Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals (Catalan Corporation of Audiovisual Media - CCMA) reduced the number of DTT channels from six to five and the number of radio networks from four to three. Late in the same year, Andalusia’s RTVA merged the schedules of its two channels. On November 29, 2013, the public corporation Radiotelevisión Valenciana (RTVV) closed one radio and one television channel. These are not the only ones with problems, but they are the ones with the longest tradition and weight in the sector: all three were created between 1983 and 1989 and were, along with their counterparts in the Basque Country and Madrid, the ones with the broadest offer of radio and television (Guimerà & Blasco, 2012). On a national level, the situation was also rather delicate. In 2013, RTVE’s budget closed with a deficit of 113 million euros, adding to the losses of previous years. In spring 2014, a story leaked to the press of a supposedly official report quoting accumulated losses at 800 million euros, obliging its chairman to refute speculations about the possible bankruptcy of the corporation. How had this situation come about? As is well known, Spain is not the first country to close public channels. Greece did it first, but those were national channels.\n\nAfter years of stable oligopoly, the main television broadcasters in Spain began to note changes in the market in the middle of the last decade. The emergence of new networks, the relaunch of digital terrestrial television (DTT), the boom in specialized channels and the proliferation of platforms such as online and mobile TV, which allow the broadcast of audiovisual contents, forced broadcast managers to change their strategy in relation to business models and production companies. The analysis in this article centres on two main points: on one hand, the transformation effected in the television industry by the advent of digitalization; and on the other hand, the role of networks in the new media environment. In April 2010, the Spanish broadcast system completed its transition from analogue to digital broadcasting and a new digital age dawned, marked by disruptive technologies and multimedia policies."
