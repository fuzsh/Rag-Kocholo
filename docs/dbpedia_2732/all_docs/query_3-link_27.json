        "text": "Hi, good morning. Welcome to our result presentation. We released our first quarter 2018 results this morning before the market opened. I would like to go over the key points now and then move on to Q&A session.This quarter we have reconfirmed our leadership in audience and advertising. Infoadex figures on the evolution of the Spanish advertising market are still pending. Our internal estimates give Mediaset España a share of the TV advertising market in the range 43.1% and 43.5%. This number if confirmed should allow our group to revalidate like last year the leadership in the market at the end of the first quarter.Let's look at Page 2. In terms of financial, this quarter was clearly marked by the impact of the Easter week. Our total net revenues were almost EUR 230 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin in excess of EUR 67 million. This is a remarkable result achieved in an environment affected by the time difference of the holiday period in 2018 compared to the previous year. We reached a margin over total net revenues of 29.3%, a number which is close to 30% and is in line with the levels achieved in the recent years.Net profit for the quarter was EUR 53.2 million. EPS is EUR 0.16, a number which is similar to the one attained last year. The net cash position at the end of the period was in excess of EUR 200 million, a number which covers the next dividend payment in full. Yesterday the shareholders meeting approved the proposed dividend payment for a total amount of EUR 197.5 million which is equal to a 100% payout of the 2017 net profit. The dividend will be paid on May 30.On Page 3 we have the TV consumption figures for the first few months of 2018. Every now and then we read that TV viewership is collapsing, that nobody spends time watching TV anymore, but the number you can see are telling us actually the opposite. In the first few months of 2018 we are seeing an increase in the number of viewers and in the consumption of TV. It's true that the comp for January and February is not homogeneous due to a different calculation system but for March and April are full comparable and are showing an increase in TV consumption.Furthermore, viewership is growing among young viewers, proving that if you broadcast the correct kind of content there is no digital threat or change in [ viewers ]. Regarding consumption we're seeing that the only real threat is the weather. Our rainy days consumption is higher than on sunny ones.Moving on Page 4 you can see that 2018 audience share results to-date. As a group this year we have a very good audience share performance, maintaining as a group very stable results in 24 hours audience both in individual target and commercial target. We are getting very good news from our primetime programs which are overtaking 2017 results.Mediaset España leads with 28.7%, more than 2 points ahead our second player. By channel Telecinco wins again, recording an audience of 13.5% which is 1 point lead over the second channel. As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, our trend is really positive. We started slowly in January and we are accelerating while the others stay flat. On top of that Telecinco is increasing its share in primetime compared to last year's numbers.As you know, this year, the second quarter is very important for us in order to set the trend for the year both in terms of revenues and cost. The reason lies in the broadcasting of the football World Cup in Russia which will last 1 month starting in mid-June.On Page 5 we recompile some information about the event. For the first time in the Spanish history a commercial free TV group is broadcasting the entire tournament. Mediaset España will broadcast 64 matches of the competition. [indiscernible] Telecinco, Cuatro and Be Mad will be hosting the broadcasting on TV while our OTT platform MiTele will distribute the matches online. We calculate that we will broadcast some 140 hours of programs on television between matches and other related programs. We will have many events produced around the World Cup including the launching of a brand new song produced by a Spanish DJ which will accompany the Spanish national team during the event.Apart from the World Cup this year we will be launching a new venture, which as you can see on Page 6, hybrid broadband television, HbbTV, is the new broadcasting standard adopted by the European community, the so-called addressable TV which is going to be tested in Spain in the very near future.We recently announced an alliance with the state TV broadcaster TVE and Atresmedia in order to develop and launch a platform with a unique standard of transmission to distribute the partner's contents. Partnership is open to all the Spanish broadcaster with the aim of sharing the investment to develop the platform as well as creating the referential platform for Spanish viewers. This alliance is based on 2 phases, the first one is the launching of the HbbTV platform by the end of June 2018. The following step will be to launch an OTT platform which we expect to be ready by the end of the year. This is the first broad alliance amongst Spanish broadcasters and can be considered as a milestone on the road over the adoption of new technologies under a common standard. This will help the distribution of our content on any kind of device and specifically in the digital environment in order to provide the best viewing experience to the Spanish population.Turning to Page 7 we have the movie activity. This year our movie production company has prepared 4 releases one of which is El cuaderno de Sara released at the beginning of February. This movie is topping the Spanish ranking and has reached the breakeven point. This is the 12th movie in a row that we are optimizing the legal obligation to produce movies. The business model set for Telecinco Cinema is giving good results. As you can see on the right-hand side of the chart 7 out of 10 of the most successful Spanish movie in history were produced by our group. The most recent one to enter in the list is Perfectos desconocidos, the movie released back in December 2017. The other 3 movies to be launched this year areYucatán, a comedy directed by Daniel Monzón, the director of [indiscernible] El Niño and Cell 2011 (sic) [ Cell 211 ] also produced by Telecinco Cinema, Ola de crímenes is a black comedy with a very good cast, and finally Superlópez, a famous Spanish comic.At the same time we will launch [ Sans ] the documentary of one of the most successful leading Spanish singer which will be launched tonight in Málaga.On Page 8, we highlight our main Internet figures. ComScore has only released to-date the audited figures for the month of January and February. We are still pending March numbers. As you can see, we repeat our lead in number of video viewed as well as in terms of time spent by any viewer on our platform. We have a strong engagement rate among our viewers which is a premium factor compared to other players. Not only do we have a secure platform with content which are fulfilling all the legal requirements where the advertisers can safely place the spots but we also give advertisers a platform with high consumption rate both in terms of number of people and time spent by each viewer.Moving now to Page 9 we have the evolution of our volumes and price during the first quarter of the year. As mentioned at the beginning of this presentation, the evolution of the advertising market was affected by the Easter week. I would like to remind you that last year Easter was in April. At the top of this page you have the quarterly evolution of our market share compared with the previous year. As per internal estimations, in the first quarter Mediaset España should have confirmed their leadership with a figure that should be between 43.1% and 43.5%. The delay that was accumulated in March due to the Easter week would be recuperated in the second quarter.Turning to Page 10, let's have a look at our profitability which is as usual our prime objective. As you know, being the most profitable media group in Spain, one of the most in Europe is always the main target for us. Our first quarter 2018 EBITDA margin was EUR 67.2 million, a 29.3% margin over total net revenues. Net profit, on the right-hand side of the chart, stood at EUR 53.2 million. Earning per share stood at EUR 0.16 in the first quarter. All figures were affected by the impact of Easter week in the period but through the strengths of our business model these figures are in line with the most recent numbers released by our group. We can estimate that in homogenous condition we could achieve a similar margin to last year.Finally our cash conversion capability. As you can see on the last page, 11, of the presentation we convert our operational margin into cash at the rate of 100%. This is what I like to call the perfect free cash flow an amount equal to the operational margin. On the right-hand side of the chart we have the shareholders' remuneration over the last 2 years. Yesterday, as I said before, the shareholders' meeting approved the distribution of the dividend on the 2017 net profit. On May 1st we will pay EUR 197.5 million, a EUR 0.16 EPS to our shareholders. Including this payment in the last 3 years we will have a total of EUR 752 million between dividends and buybacks. As is customary for our company, all the cash we generate which was not needed for the ordinary management of the business was given back to the shareholders.And now for some final remarks, quickly summarizing the main points of the period. We can say that the first quarter of 2018 despite the impact from Easter week which we expect [indiscernible] has been positive. At the end of March our group was leader in audience share in the Italian prime time and commercial target. Telecinco is the first channel in the same [indiscernible]. TV advertising revenues in January-February have grown, driven by increasing prices, March has been affected by Easter. So we will have to wait until the end of April to have the clear picture of the situation.According to our estimates which we expect will be validated by Infoadex we have confirmed our first position in the advertising market over our main competitor. We were leaders in audience in advertising. We achieved this spending more or less the same as last year. Our costs are steady and in line with our budget. The Internet and digital area have also shown excellent results with advertising revenues growing more than 20%. Once again, the area of cinema has had a very positive result confirming and reinforcing our position as content producer not only in internet and TV.The margins are high and probably some of the best in Europe at the end of the first quarter. Free cash flow conversion from EBITDA is higher than 100%. Our net results and EPS is one of the highest in the recent years. All that said, we can confirm that we are out of the starting blocks [indiscernible] and we have made a great start to achieving the annual target we said at the beginning of the year. At the end of positive first quarter we are leader in audience, advertising and profitability. And we are now ready to take your questions.\n\nCosts, yes, [indiscernible] so we had an optimal amount of costs which is going to be the same every single year. We always had a metric which is what kind of a cost line or what kind of a cost base we should have in terms of the conditions of the market. Now you will have seen in the last years with an upside market the main difference between one year and the next has been whether or not we had a sport event. And also internally within the year in some quarters as volatility of the market was there even with so much room for reducing our costs because we were getting ready for market which was more positive. So that said, what we do at the end of the year probably is one of the only metrics in which we do give a guidance at the beginning of the year because it's something that we can't control. And we do have this control because we have an internal production base and therefore we get in a position to adapt our cost base to the realities of the market. For this year you know that we had given a guidance of EUR 770 million which is pretty much what we had last year for normalized market, the positive and normal market that we were expecting and we still do expect for this year, plus the impact of the World Cup. And this is an exercise that we will continue to do next year. At the beginning of the year we will see what kind of a market we are facing, then we will [indiscernible] like we have done in the last couple of years some expenses on digital, new hires, new technology and so on. And the important thing on cost though at least is that we do not have inflation in the sense of increase that comes from the blue, comes out of the blue because the new entrants of the market or because your main competitors is doing something. We do not have that kind of a factor. And when we do give a guidance has to do with our estimate of costs. I can also tell you that [indiscernible] there is an inflation clause. So everything that our cost base moves one way or the other is based on what we estimate the advertising market is going to be. And finally something very important is not the main cost reduction it's something, and as you say that is we have done a very significant exercise in the last years, but it's not the main objective, the main objective is not reduce costs, the main objective is to optimize our business model, profits, margins and free cash flow generation. And costs to achieve these goals and of course is every year is different and the terms and the conditions of the market."
