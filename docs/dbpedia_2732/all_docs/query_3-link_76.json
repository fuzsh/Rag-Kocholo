        "text": "Access and Admission\n\nAccess and Admission\n\nIn order to access the Master's programs, it is an essential requirement to have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent in accordance with current legislation. A Bachelor's Degree in the Communication Sciences (Journalism, Audiovisual Communication, Advertising and Public Relations) will be especially valued. In this sense, we are looking for students who have skills that will provide a good disposition for teamwork, who have great flexibility and open-mindedness to the acquisition of new knowledge and new ways of working, and who, even if they come from scientific or technical backgrounds, show an interest in the humanities in general, and the arts in particular.\n\nThe admission process to the Master's degree begins by sending the following documentation by post or courier to the Postgraduate Admissions Section:\n\nCompleted Admission Application\n\nUpdated Curriculum Vitae\n\nPhotocopy of DNI (only Spanish candidates) or passport (only foreign candidates)\n\nPhotocopy of the Academic Record/Transcript (completed or in the last year of the university degree)\n\nTwo color passport-size photographs\n\nOnce the documentation has been received and it has been verified that the diploma presented grants access to the degree, as established in Arts. 15 and 16 of Royal Decree 1393/2007, candidates take the proficiency test (interview) of the chosen program, which is carried out by the program coordinator. This test is taken in person in Madrid and in different Spanish cities and, additionally, it can also be taken remotely (online) by those candidates residing outside of Spain.\n\nThe proficiency test, which aims to analyze the student's abilities to complete the Master's program, assesses the candidate's profile and capabilities, so it does not require prior preparation, and allows the student to receive more comprehensive and personalized advice regarding their academic and career options.\n\nOnce passed, the Program Coordinator makes a report on the candidate's skills profile, their degree of maturity, their personal interest in Audiovisual Communication and their suitability for the degree, which is attached to the file that will be studied by the Admissions Committee.\n\nAfter the admission tests, the Admissions Committee analyzes the results and the documentation submitted by the candidate, and approves or rejects the application. The candidate receives written information about their admission, which is provided by telephone, regarding the result of the admission process and about the formalization of their enrollment in the Program, the final documentation that must be submitted, duly legalized, etc."
