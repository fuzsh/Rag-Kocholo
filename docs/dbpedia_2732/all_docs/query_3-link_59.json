        "text": "Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!\n\nThe CEO of Mediaset España Comunicación, S.A. (BME:TL5) is Paolo Vasile. This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. After that, we will consider the growth in the business. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels.\n\nView our latest analysis for Mediaset España Comunicación\n\nHow Does Paolo Vasile's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?\n\nAt the time of writing our data says that Mediaset España Comunicación, S.A. has a market cap of €2.2b, and is paying total annual CEO compensation of €1.7m. (This is based on the year to December 2018). That's less than last year. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at €930k. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations from €1.8b to €5.7b, and the median CEO total compensation was €15k.\n\nAs you can see, Paolo Vasile is paid more than the median CEO pay at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this does not necessarily mean Mediaset España Comunicación, S.A. is paying too much. A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous.\n\nThe graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Mediaset España Comunicación has changed from year to year.\n\nIs Mediaset España Comunicación, S.A. Growing?\n\nMediaset España Comunicación, S.A. has increased its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 5.6% a year, over the last three years (using a line of best fit). Its revenue is down -1.1% over last year.\n\nI would argue that the lack of revenue growth in the last year is less than ideal, but the improvement in EPS is good. It's hard to reach a conclusion about business performance right now. This may be one to watch. It could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.\n\nHas Mediaset España Comunicación, S.A. Been A Good Investment?\n\nGiven the total loss of 33% over three years, many shareholders in Mediaset España Comunicación, S.A. are probably rather dissatisfied, to say the least. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously.\n\nIn Summary...\n\nWe compared total CEO remuneration at Mediaset España Comunicación, S.A. with the amount paid at companies with a similar market capitalization. As discussed above, we discovered that the company pays more than the median of that group.\n\nThe growth in the business has been uninspiring, but the shareholder returns have arguably been worse, over the last three years. Although we'd stop short of calling it inappropriate, we think the CEO compensation is probably more on the generous side of things. Shareholders may want to check for free if Mediaset España Comunicación insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.
