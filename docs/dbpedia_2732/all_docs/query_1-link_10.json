Meanwhile, the 54th International Film Festival of India wrapped up with Hollywood veteran Michael Douglas receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award. We see strategic growth and expansion in the realm of television and streaming. See-Saw Films has launched a new drama label, exemplifying the industry's commitment to fostering creative talent and unique narratives. Additionally, C21's announcement of the Next Gen Creator Festival marks a significant step in bridging the gap between digital creators and traditional TV, highlighting the evolving landscape of content creation. There are merger talks in Korea poised to challenge global streaming giants and notable shifts in New Zealand's media sector reflecting the changing dynamics of government-media relationships. The U.K. is abuzz with the commissioning of new dramas and documentaries, signalling a robust and diverse production slate. In an era where streaming and traditional cinema coexist, producers and creators share insights into navigating this dual landscape successfully. Stay informed with the latest in TV, film, music, and media. Join industry leaders from broadcasting, streaming, and production by subscribing to our daily news roundup. Sign up for future updates at the link below.\n\nThe trade journal for the broadcast industry, 'Broadcast Magazine,' has asked our founder and CEO Marc Putman to document his activities for one week, thus offering readers a glimpse behind the scenes of the breadth in which OUTtv Media operates within the European media landscape. Monday: Launch of PRIDEtv on PLUTO Today is an important day for us: we are exclusively launching on Paramount's platform Pluto TV, the largest FAST* platform and the fastest-growing branch in our media landscape. Here we are introducing our new offering PRIDEtv, a queer programming channel featuring primarily short format content (shorts, music, documentaries, miniseries) in more than 34 countries. Our partners, Your Channels and Media Choice, have worked hard over the past months to implement this technology and make the launch possible. They have processed hundreds of items, created separate feeds for various European countries, and now we are active for the first time across Latin America. Adding FAST to our portfolio not only offers commercial exploitation opportunities but also a new marketing tool to entice viewers into paid conversion to our premium content. My afternoon starts with a Teams call with our international acquisition team to discuss the results of the Cannes Film Festival. We have already acquired several new films and completed deals on the spot, and for some films, we still need to further negotiate and assess the exploitation potential. Among others, we have acquired the impressive Belgian film AMAL, the Brazilian film Perfect Endings, and the Italian TV series The Club. We focus on queer stories that provide a global cultural representation of our LGBTI community. At 2:00 PM, I have a meeting with the European Commission, our international sales partner Brandadvance, and Paramount. To support our technical launch today, we will organize a Rainbow Brunch on Thursday, June 20th, during PRIDE Day at the Lions Festival in Cannes and formally launch the PRIDEtv channels. Together with the cabinet of the Euro Commissioner for Equality, Mrs. Monti, Ellen, Vice President of Paramount and founder of PLUTO, Olivier, and Chris from Brandadvance, we will discuss the speeches and the panel discussion. We have also invited former Eurovision winner and OUTMedia Award winner Conchita Wurst to musically support the launch. After this meeting, I have planned to prepare a presentation for a new lead in Latin America interested in selling our proposition in this region to local operators. In the evening, I will play a game of padel with my Spanish neighbor to burn off the calories from this workday and clear my mind.

Absolutely Not, Says UCLA Report https://ift.tt/MbyC2AJ For anyone unfamiliar, the Hollywood Diversity Report is an 11-year-running annual in-depth analyses of the industry at large. Developed by UCLA, it's an audit of sorts of tracking diversity behind and in front of the camera, as well as comprehensive breakdowns of the audiences and what they’re watching in the theaters and at home. This extensive research project is broken down into parts, with the first released last year revealing \"women and people of color drove box office numbers\" (via UCLA's media release). Part two is here to focus on everyone's favorite new catered cable programming, streaming. The general summary of the report shows that women and people of color were extremely dominate in viewership for streaming this year. This is important for representation in many big ways, as it shows that diversity in front of and behind the camera naturally draws an audience at shouldn't be viewed as a \"risk.\" As UCLA’s executive vice chancellor and provost, and co-founder of the Hollywood Diversity Report puts it: \"We know investing in diversity isn’t a risk. It should be considered a strategic business imperative if Hollywood wants to survive.” It's a very concise and important point made by Hunt. We often hear big studio movies timid to make earnest diverse films due to the \"risk\" of alienating their audience. Which, in theory, is pretty silly when you consider the grander population of the world, and it's important and cool to see these numbers presented by the report. Anyway. Here at No Film School we rarely get to give our readership what they're all looking for: charts! School is in the name people. You have to expect charts every once in awhile. Buckle up. Keep reading below for a closer look at the numbers carefully researched by UCLA scholars. Key Takeaways From Look at that data! As I am no man of numbers, I'll let it speak for itself without superfluous wax poetics. Enjoy these key takeaways assembled by the true heroes of this report: Women made up the majority of viewers for nine of the top 10 streaming films of 2023, while households of color were also overrepresented as viewers for nine of the top 10. Among creators, women and people of color still find more opportunities in streaming than in theatrical productions but continue to face limited resources as white male directors helm the few high-budget projects. Women reached proportionate representation as leads in films but were most likely to star in films with smaller budgets and continue to lag in terms of overall cast. People of color remain underrepresented behind the camera, but they reached proportionate representation in terms of total cast on screen and their largest share of film leads for the first time in the report series. While this is certainly a promising move forward for diversity in film and TV, we can only hope that this stays consi...\n\nFrom Variety: The Bigger Picture There’s a bigger picture. Ampere Analysis forecast a few days back that in 2024 51% of Netflix ’s $15.4 billion #film and TV budget will be spent on titles made outside the U.S. Global content spent, excluding sports, will soar 40% over 2022-28, while U.S. spend will plunge 20%. Reasons? One is that much of international, led by Central and South America (+19%) is less sub-saturated, Variety’s VIP+ suggests. Post Peak #TV Festival Bump This sea change has large consequences for TV events. “The internationalization of content is continuing apace and I can’t see that lessening or reversing,” Ampere Analysis’ Guy Bisson tells Variety. “The re-invigoration of the licensing market also points to expanded opportunity for international content and so festivals fulfil a two-pronged opportunity to pick up projects in the development stage as well as locating high quality finished programming that has shown pedigree in one or more international markets,” he adds. Other Reasons for International TV Growth “In #Europe, all the streamers have obligations, especially in #France, to produce European or French content,” says SERIES MANIA founder and general director Laurence Herszberg. “Also, streamers realize it’s cheaper to produce outside the U.S. Diversifying production, they can still make shows which attract viewers who are ever more interested in the usual American and U.K. series,” she adds. Led by the highly curated Series Mania, festivals act as quality filters, through selection and prizes, and new talent platforms. At the Forum, Sony Pictures Entertainment Television’s Wayne Garvie, Groupe TF1 ’s Rodolphe Buet and Movistar Plus+’s Domingo Corral will deliver masterclasses. Key debating points may well take in cost contention, the move towards “lighter” feeling programming, and the surge of co-production via a diversity of business models. #streaming\n\nThe trade journal for the broadcast industry, 'Broadcast Magazine,' has asked our founder and CEO Marc Putman to document his activities for one week, thus offering readers a glimpse behind the scenes of the breadth in which OUTtv Media operates within the European media landscape.

I just want to add that we need to increase the protection (invisible and inaudible watermarks at the level of individual offline/online screenings etc...) of content and make films available to the whole world in a simple way. Ideally so that premieres of Independent films can be made by #communities of followers and fun's around the world (cinemas and VOD) in simple release window. So it's important to be able to order a film for your cinema or living room in a simple way (like in a regular e-shop). Ideally to have this type of e-shop on the filmmakers' website. From a viewer's point of view, there is no need to pay a subscription to something that you won't be able to choose what you know you want to see anyway. The future is in transactional orders of what you want and what your bubble has recommended. Decisions on both of these basic parameters, I mean..... The need and desire to protect your IP i.e. your films and the system of selling rights/licensing/projection are entirely in the hands of independent filmmakers..... So let's change that... The technology already exists, it's called Artinii.Pro and is used in over 80 countries. Just upload your film to Encrypted storage and let your interested parties book screenings/T-Vod..\n\nGroupe STORYPLUS and FUJI TELEVISION ANNOUNCE THEIR FIRST CREATIVE PARTNERSHIP !

We believe that this new game show will surpass our classic titles. With the creative minds from the EAST and WEST working together, we will make sure that we will have everyone watching the show laugh wherever they are watching!\" Matthieu JEAN-TOSCANI, CEO of Groupe STORYPLUS declares \"this new creative partnership is an important step in the development of the STORYPLUS Group. It is fully in line with our diversification strategy. Today, content consumption is global, and the French public (but not only) is fan of Japanese culture. So it's only natural that we approached the talented teams at FUJI TV to create a great new entertainment game, based on the hit formats in their catalog. We're delighted to announce this new development, which is already attracting interest from historical broadcasters and platforms”. Yasutaka Shimizu and Takao Ueno, Producer of Music and Variety Show Department at FUJI TV, “The idea behind this game show that we co-developed with STORYPLUS is \"Working as a Team\". In Japan, we have the culture of valuing \"Working as a Team\" or in a Group. We wanted to show the value of working together in this game show format, while also having a good time. We think it is intriguing to see two sides of the contestants faces: the side of \"seriousness\" and the side of \"fun\"\".

This new show will bring a new form of fun, celebrity-driven family entertainment. We're delighted to be working directly with our friends at FUJI TV, the world's specialists in feel-good entertainment!”\n\nSummary of the documentary and independent film market from Harvard University: \"more revenue must be generated from distribution to build a sustainable sector\" However, when you look at the data that Netflix released in their engagement report in December people simply aren't watching enough of these sorts of films to justify the acquisition costs so the streamers are pulling back at film festivals, etc. Are the evil streamer algorithms hiding the films from the audience? No, but they are giving them more and more of the stuff that they already watched, which doesn't help. It comes down to basic supply and demand - too many films are being made for a small addressable audience, thus the market is contracting. Sure, the government could fund a diverse slate of interesting films but that doesn't mean that anyone is going watch them. In my opinion the sustainable solution isn't glamorous or groundbreaking - it's simply fewer, high quality films that are properly marketed to a highly targeted and engaged audience.

Breaks to be different and innovative, in addition to re-commenting all advertisements about the content that is broadcast in all channels, and after that, I will re-launch all channels in a completely new way, in addition to launching a larger number of specialized movie channels such as OSN movies, drama and OSN movies, sci-fi, And OSN movies horror, in addition to the current movie channels, the re-launch of the box office channels under the name OSN home cinema, and a greater allocation of lifestyle channels, series and variety programs. Because at the time it was very strong, OSN, Hala Turki, OSN, Hala Arbela, OSN Arab Cinema, and OSN, a screen for variety and plays. These channels are strongly supported, especially in Ramadan, with interest in exclusive contracting on the most powerful series, and productions are stopped, of which it is clear that 99% of them According to my point of view, it is a failure, and after that, the news channel will be canceled and the OSN documentary channel, OSN lifestyle, OSN hits music, and OSN American planet will be launched for American series only, with some diversified programs, and after that, contracting to bring Viacom network channels, the USA package, HBO channels, and BBC channels, especially BBC first channel, of course, with interest in translating the channels and the most powerful American news channels such as nbc news, msnbc news, abc news, cbc news, fox news, Discovery channels, History channels, translating the crime & investigation channel and converting it into HD, and most importantly, contracting with Humax to produce a 4K device With an internal memory of 4 terabytes, in addition to a special memory for the movie library, the area of which is 1 terabyte, with huge specifications, and it is easy to use and very far from the problems that all subscribers suffered from, and that only the network channels are installed within 999 only, while the free channels can be searched manually and saved in the device, and it is for the subscriber The freedom to arrange the free channels according to what he prefers, by making more options available in the software and changing the color of the user interface in the receiver from black to a color that is comfortable for the eye and pleasing to the subscribers.
