        "text": "The audiovisual entertainment business is undergoing a key moment due to several reasons: the Internet boom, its convergence with television, the prominence of the user as well as the digitalization of the production and distribution processes. Although this phenomenon was initially originated by technological factors, its consequences affect to the whole audiovisual industry and, more specifically, to the very core of the business—contents. In this context, fiction and entertainment contents must be developed since its first stage for a multimedia and interactive consumption in order to be enjoyed by the audience on a wide range of platforms. From this perspective, successful contents demands capability to be multi-platform distributed and customized by the consumer. In this regard, its interactive options, its potential to create a prestigious brand and a profitable business model, and, last but not least, its power to tell an original transmedia story. This chapter tries to figure out the most innovative trends in production, distribution and commercialization of multi-platform contents in the case of the main television networks in Spain. In this sense, we are presenting a comparative analysis of their different multi-platform strategies following a two-step methodology: firstly, a descriptive study of their respective websites, online players, mobile apps and social networks’ profiles; secondly, questionnaires to the multimedia managers of the chief networks together with some personal interviews. The preliminary results of this research prove that, in the Spanish case, the convergence of television and the Internet is revolutionizing the production and commercialization of audiovisual contents, although it is also clear that is still in a challenging first stage.\n\nThe strategic importance of the internet for television became evident in the early 2000s, even destabilizing its very concept and finally resulting in convergence towards a profound transformation of the sector. The introduction of global over-the-top (OTT) media services into local markets has led to strategic changes in multimedia groups. This study considers the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services of Atresmedia and Mediaset España, the two main traditional media organizations in Spain that form a duopoly in the country’s commercial television sector, with the aim of understanding and evaluating their positioning strategy in this market and the results obtained through the diversification of their core business. Based on an analysis of their content, price, and promotion policies and the results in terms of subscriptions and revenues, slight differences emerge regarding the strategy and scope of these two groups in their own environment in the sector. They compete for cu...\n\nAfter years of stable oligopoly, the main television broadcasters in Spain began to note changes in the market in the middle of the last decade. The emergence of new networks, the relaunch of digital terrestrial television (DTT), the boom in specialized channels and the proliferation of platforms such as online and mobile TV, which allow the broadcast of audiovisual contents, forced broadcast managers to change their strategy in relation to business models and production companies. The analysis in this article centres on two main points: on one hand, the transformation effected in the television industry by the advent of digitalization; and on the other hand, the role of networks in the new media environment. In April 2010, the Spanish broadcast system completed its transition from analogue to digital broadcasting and a new digital age dawned, marked by disruptive technologies and multimedia policies.\n\nThe digital transformation is part of profound post-industrial society changes that are having a crucial impact in all social institutions. Media companies are not exceptions to this rule. In the first stage of their digital transition, legacy media used digital channels to distribute the same content they had in their old channels, trying to find new revenue sources. The results we have seen have been disappointing, to say the least. Now we seem to be getting into a new stage.\n\nIn the last 20 years, there has been considerable discussion about the transformation of the media industry and its relation with telecommunications, bringing these industries closer and making them more convergent – mostly in terms of content management and distribution. The media industry is going through a period of accelerated transformation and is characterized by a radical disruption. This obviously has profound effects on management strategies and practices within and across media companies and industries. It is equally clear, however, that among media industries we find divergent characteristics that recommend practices and strategies for responding to the specificities of diverse media companies and kinds of products. This book presents diverse and high quality articles on topics related to Economics and Management of Media and Creative Industries, from their specific features as an industry based on intensive human capital, to changes in business models, impacts of the Internet and influence of public policies, as well as other practices in terms of the sector’s concentration and regulation. The book is organized in two parts – “Media Concentration, Competition and Convergence” and “Media Management Strategies, Business Models and Cultural Industries” – and includes 20 articles, based on the 6th IMMAA Conference (under the theme “New Business Models and Policies for Media and Creative Industries: Challenges to Research and teaching of Media Management”) which took place in Lisbon, in May 2013.\n\nMultiplatform content broadcasts are one way of securing the position of public-service broadcasting in a competitive and changing market. This research focuses on the cross-media fiction series Águila Roja (Red Eagle) and Isabel, produced by Globomedia and Diagonal TV for Radio Televisión Española (RTVE), the Spanish radio and television corporation. RTVE is a public-service broadcaster that has recently undergone a significant reconversion as a consequence of the recession and a new funding system based exclusively on financial contributions from the state, with a ban on paid advertising, which had been permitted in the past. We examine the way this organization creates productions for multiple platforms and the innovation strategies that support these processes. Using a comparative case study approach based on the actor-network theory, we found a strong 360-degree cross-media production logic in RTVE's fiction series. However, a detailed analysis reveals difficulties and contradictions regarding the efficacious use of each of the technological platforms available as well as limitations on the actions undertaken in the social media.\n\nTraditional television corporations have found the way to take the first step towards cross-mediation, establishing specific departments for the production, adaptation and distribution of their content on the internet and on different platforms. Public service companies follow the same trend in order to fulfill their mission of public service as well as to compete in the new environment. This research aims to learn about the organizational structure of the Italian public service company Rai in relation to crossmedia production. This work aims to study how the company adapted its organizational structure to the new 360o production and to describe the organizational structure of the company for the production of cross-media content. The methodology is based on participant observation in the departments involved in the production of multiplatform content and in-depth interviews with various professionals."
