        "text": "Welcome to Cinètica Produccions! We are an audiovisual production company based in Mallorca, founded by Luis Ortas in 2007. Our portfolio of projects spans a wide variety of genres, including advertising commercials, institutional videos, promotional videos, music videos, documentaries, and a vast array of international documentaries.\n\nFor nearly a decade, from 2010 to mid-2019, we had the honor of working closely with MEDIASET ESPAÑA COMUNICACIÓN, playing a crucial role as news correspondents on TELECINCO and CUATRO.\n\nHowever, in March 2019, we embarked on a new direction, focusing on content creation, including documentaries and fiction for both television and digital platforms.\n\nAmong our notable achievements is the feature-length documentary ‘Després de la boira’, which has been internationally distributed and received the CANAL+ Documenta Madrid 2015 award. It was also selected for the Barcelona Jewish Film Festival and was a finalist at the Shanghai Magnolia Awards.\n\nIn February 2019, we made a significant impact with the release of our documentary ‘Milicianes,’ which achieved an impressive TV audience share of 17% on TV3, with 515,000 viewers.\n\nOur miniseries ‘La Paca, la matriarca de la droga’ garnered a notable 4.7% share on IB3, surpassing the channel’s average audience, and had an audience of 17,000 viewers. This project became the first content from IB3 to be broadcast on AMAZON PRIME.\n\nIn 2020, we presented the compelling documentary ‘Constel·lació Comelade’, an international co-production involving the Balearic Islands, Catalonia, and France, centered around the French musician Pascal Comelade. The documentary attracted around 7,000 viewers during the three days of the online festival Docs Barcelona on Filmin and received significant media attention. It was also showcased at the Atlantida Mallorca Film Fest and Cinespaña Toulouse.\n\nOur latest achievement was the fictional short film ‘Cleo vendrá esta noche’, distributed by Freak Agency, which won the First Prize and the Roel de Oro at the 36th Cinema Week of Medina del Campo, participated in the Festival de Málaga Short Corner, and competed in the Un Impulso Colectivo Selection at D’A Barcelona.\n\nWe invite you to explore our website and learn more about our exciting journey and creative projects. Thank you for visiting us!"
