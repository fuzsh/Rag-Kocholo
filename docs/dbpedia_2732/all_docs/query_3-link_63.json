I'm Luca Giammatteo, Head of Investor Relations. Today we have as speakers Massimo Musolino, General Operations Manager; Kiko Alum, Publiespana General Manager of Marketing; and the Group CFO, Javier Uria. Massimo Musolino will start with the results presentation and the presentation will be followed, as usual, by the Q&A session. Massimo, over to you. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [2] ------------------------------ Hi, good evening. Thank you for attending our first nine months of 2013 results presentation. Let's start with the key figures from the period, on page two. Looking at the right-hand side of the page, you can appreciate that we are once again leaders in both audience and the advertising market share with 28.9% and 43.7%, respectively. On the left-hand side of the chart, we have the main P&L figures. Consolidated net revenues are down by just 7.3%. Advertising revenues are down by 9.5%, which is in line with the evolution of the market, while the revenues are up by 31% thanks to the impact of the [movie activity] during the first half of the year. On the financial side, we've further increased our margin, both in euro and in percentile in total revenues. We recorded an EBITDA of almost EUR58 million, which is 10% of the total net revenues, and an EBIT margin of EUR45 million, which represents a margin of 8%. Both figures are around EUR17 million higher than the same period of last year, with an increase of 42% in EBITDA and 64% in EBIT. Once again, we have been able to balance the reduction in revenues with the cut in our cost base. Net profit for the period after financial results and taxes stands at EUR22 million, which has been negatively affected by a loss in equity participation and a higher tax rate regarding the same period last year. Finally, looking at our financial position. By the end of September, we had almost EUR86 million cash, which is EUR12 million higher than the amount we showed at the end of 2012. We remain one of the few (inaudible) companies without leverage. Third quarter numbers are promising as the revenues and margins were up. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the crisis. We now know that the country seems to be getting out of the recession. And there are still a few problems to be solved, but the recent trend seen in the Spanish economy shows that the end of the tunnel is near. If we now turn to page four, we have the TTV consumption for the first nine months of the year. During the last five years, the consumption increased -- TTV consumption increased by 19 minutes. The reason for the increase in viewership may be found in the increase in the unemployment rate and the doubling of (inaudible) channel. They are 17 more channels now than in 2008. As you can see on the right-hand side of the chart, all age groups are experiencing important increases, including the [most extra active] groups for advertisers. Moving now to page five, we can see the mostly audience evolution per group. We have the leading groups since the integration of Cuatro in January 2011 with 34 consecutive months of leadership. Our year-to-date group audience share average in 24 hours total in TV was 28.9%, while in commercial target it was 31%. Both numbers roughly the same then increased back to the same period of last year and enabled us to be market leader once again. Despite of reducing costs and the absence of the (inaudible), we have been able to increase our audience by one point while spending almost 12% less. On the following page, we have the audience breakdown of our Group for trends per region. As you can see, we have maintained a strong leadership among the young adult group. Our efforts have paid off in terms of rejuvenating the audiences to our channels, in particular Telecinco, where the lineup has been more oriented at the younger audience. We have managed to achieve this without losing our classic audience base. Moving now to page seven, we show the audience evolution per channel. The year-to-date average audience (inaudible) that Telecinco is the leading channel, both in 24-hour and prime time which tempo is 13% and 13.2%, respectively. Analyzing the monthly evolution, you see that we have focused the content investment for the channel Telecinco on the most important month in terms of the advertising expenditure and TV consumption. We do not want to believe that at any price, and sometime we have to analyze the trade-off between saving and being leader with a focus on the impact on P&L. For the sample in September, we were not leaders in the monthly average because we delayed the beginning of the new season to the second report month. In fact, if we divide the months between the weak and strong advertising periods, you can see that we are ahead of our competitors in the stronger part of the month, coinciding with the start of the new sales piece on September 15th. We also used the statics of delaying the start of the season in accordance with the advertising expenditure in January this year, and this does not affect the year-to-date average of the trend. We faced our cost expenditure in programming following the expected evolution of the advertising market and focusing our investment on the stronger periods. I'll finish with the following page, where we have the data for our web pages. We are once again leaders among the TV web sites with an increased number of pages and unique users. During the month of September, we had more than 18.5 million unique users on our Group's webs with more than 308 million pages viewed. The number of videos streamed during the month is even more relevant, with more than 79.5 million videos viewed. Telecino.es is attracting the majority of the users, and as a consequence its page and video numbers are by far the most important. Finally, mitele.es with 4.3 million users, had more than 17 million videos streamed with an average duration of more than 20 minutes for users visiting the page, which maintains our OTT platform as the market leader. As we have consolidated our internet positioning, we recently decided to launch an integrated advertising over the two platforms that we manage, TV and internet. Advertisers' appetite for TV advertising is still very high, but they are now requesting for more visibility on the world wide web. For this reason, we are building campaigns over the two platforms which are delivering really good result so far, as Kiko will tell you. Now I hand you over to Kiko Alum. ------------------------------ Kiko Alum, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Publiespana General Manager of Marketing [3] ------------------------------ Okay. Good evening. Thank you, Massimo. On page 10, we have the market data for the first nine months of the year as published (inaudible) is over Infoadex. Advertising market declined by 12.6%. The TV sector had a better evolution than the market with a third quarter decline of 2.7, making a year-to-date reduction of 10.4%. These numbers show the strength of the TV among the other media. As shown on the top right-hand side of the chart, in 2013 television, in spite of the absence of major sporting events, is gaining more than 1% total. TV is the most important media for the advertisers with a share of 47%. We think that the pricing policy applied in the year has helped the TV market to increase among the other media. On page 11, we have the quarterly evolution of the market, which has sequentially improved over the last four quarters. Since the beginning of the year, we dispersed the idea that the market trends in 2013 could be a (inaudible) that chop each quarterly less negative than the previous one. Moving now to page 12, to discuss the evolution of the advertising of the year from the (inaudible) media, which were 540.1 million. Due to the fact that we have no -- due to the fact we have no sell in integrated companies between TV and internet, we only provide the top-line revenues, which as of September '13 we are up 540.1 million. How our Groups (inaudible) in those market share was after in for the estimation 43.7%, which makes me assert that (inaudible) group. During the third quarter, price were up by 5.7%, which makes the year-to-date evolution at minus 2.7% of the first nine months of the year. Seconds declined by 11.7% and GRPs by 8.3%. On page 13, we have the breakdown by sector. (inaudible) is performing the best with an increase of almost 20%, which represent an important increase in the third quarter. Health & Beauty has continued to perform well, representing last year's investment, which is good news. And retail has also had a much better evolution on their rates. Now I hand you over to Javier Uria. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [4] ------------------------------ Thank you and good evening to everybody. I guess I'll start on page 15, to go through the usual walk-through of this year accounts. We start with the net advertising revenues. You will see that we had a decline of 9.5% in the period, which is in line with the evolution of the market, whilst in the other revenue line we see an increase of 31%. Remind you that most part of the important films that were launched last year, that took place in the fourth quarter and that's why we have this positive number. If we talk about costs, we will see that there is a reduction of almost 11%, and this is in line with what we have been doing the last years, which is trying to adapt to the realities of the market. In this case, and if we go more specifically to a different line, we see that there was a reduction in TV rights amortization of minus 16%. This is due to less fiction and less third-party rights. And the same happens when we look at the other operating costs, which are down by some EUR14 million, basically due to the impact of the Euro Cup last year. At the end of the day, alas, we have a reduction in our costs, which is in excess of the decline that we have seen in the advertising revenues. We see an increase in EBITDA of some EUR17 million, which represent something like close to 42% versus the same period of last year. And if we talk about EBIT, we get to a very similar number, plus EUR17 million, and this equates to an increase of 64%. On pre-tax, we see that the number is EUR30.4 million, so we would have to highlight that the main difference between the EUR45 million and the EUR30 million is accounting impact of the equity line and most significantly the Digital Plus line in which we have booked accounting losses of the Company for the stake that we have in it. And the difference between the EUR30.4 million and the EUR22 million of net profit is for the booking of the tax expense in the year this time around being higher than last year because of less investment which qualify for a tax deduction. In terms of net asset net profit, we get to a number of EUR33.5 million. And if we go to the right-hand side, we will see that with these numbers we have been able to increase the margins in terms of EBITDA from 6.4% last year to 9.9% this year. And if we talk about the EBIT, the situation is an increase from 4.4% to 7.8%, something that is quite remarkable and that we have not changed for some time. On next page, on page 16, we take a longer view in terms of costs. And on this slide here, we have the numbers for the last three years. You will appreciate here that we have reduced our costs by EUR178 million over the nine-month period. This entails some EUR200 million in the full year. And apart from this reduction that comes from the adapting to the realities of the market, as I have said before, it's interesting to see that inside each of the boxes for the different years you will appreciate that we have --not only that we had this reduction, but this has been achieved at a time when we were increasing the number of channels and also increasing the number of sport events year-after-year. On page 17, we take a look at the cash flow. The free cash flow has slightly increased versus the same period last year. It's only EUR1.5 million. You will see that we have a negative number in terms of advertising revenues, mainly those minus EUR27 million which have been more than offset by the decrease in net investment and by a tightening of our management of the working capital. Nothing important on the equity front, and we get to a final cash position of EUR85 million. Again, on the right-hand side, if we take a longer view on the last three years we will see that we have come from a negative cash back in 2010, 2011, a small positive at the end of September of last year, and this time around we get to almost EUR86 million. Next page, which is the investments that we have seen already, a slight decrease of EUR16 million, mainly due to lesser investment in third-party rights. On page 19, a few words about the situation of the balance sheet. Our balance sheet, again, shows it's a very strong one, very good mix between the equity and the long-term assets. You will see that the number is pretty much the same. And if we talk about short-term assets and liabilities, we had a liquidity ratio in excess of 100% that basically means that we'll be able to liquidate the short-term assets and with that we'll pay all of the liabilities and still have an excess. And finally, on page 20 is a similar slide to what we have seen before. We have the reduction in costs that we have seen already, but here I would like to highlight that along with this reduction we have been able to, first of all, increase the share of the advertising market, we have been able to increase the audience share, and that means that the reduction has not affected our ability to come up with a good audience rating, and, last but not least, we have been able to improve the financial position from the negative situation that we had back in 2010 to the positive number of EUR86 million that we have seen already. Massimo, over to you for the closing remarks. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [5] ------------------------------ Yes. Thanks, Javier. The result that we have just presented reaffirms our leadership in both audience and advertising market. Margins have increased both in euros and percentage as well as revenues, which have increased during the third quarter for the first time in almost three years, since the third quarter 2010. Our financial position and balance sheet both show improvements, making our Group the most solid among the Spanish media. The evolution of the advertising market this year is in absolute line with what we forecasted the beginning of the year. You may probably remember that the previous calls that we have had during this year, up to now we have achieved all our main audience share objectives, we have maintained our costs in line with our plans. Therefore, at this stage there is no need to modify the original cost guidance that we gave in the beginning of the year. So, we continue our EUR770 million cost guidance for the year 2013. Honestly, we have EUR5 million to EUR10 million flexibility during the fourth quarter of this year. The decision of the final outcome will be taken in accordance with the evolution of the audience and the advertising market during the last couple of months for this year. We have prepared a strong lineup for the last part of this year, which means slightly higher programming costs versus the same period of 2012. Now I hand over to Luca for the Q&A session. ============================== Questions and Answers ------------------------------ Luca Giammatteo, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - IR [1] ------------------------------ Thank you very much, Massimo. Thank you, Javier. Thank you, Kiko. This is the end of the presentation. We are now ready to take your questions. ------------------------------ Operator [2] ------------------------------ Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session starts now. (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Adrien de Saint Hilaire from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Adrien de Saint Hilaire, Exane BNP Paribas - Analyst [3] ------------------------------ Hello. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for all those details. I have a couple of questions, please. The first one is, could you please give us what your thoughts are regarding Q4 advertising trends? And if you could potentially split this out between TV and internet, I don't know if it's possible with your new reporting structure. The second question I have is regarding your OpEx for Q4. I remember that last year you had a movie -- a strong move release which impacted positively revenues, but impacted negatively costs. Could you tell us what was the impact last year and, therefore, what will be the savings on costs for Q4? And the last question is regarding Digital Plus. I was just wondering what your favorite option regarding Digital Plus was. Would you prefer a JV? And also, could you help us quantify potential synergies and what's the opportunity for you to have a bigger stake in Digital Plus? Thank you. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [4] ------------------------------ Yes, let me start with the movie activity in the fourth quarter and how that is going to impact. Last year in the fourth quarter we had a lot of activity. We had the two big films. We had the costs and we had the revenues. This year, we're not going to have either. So, in terms of costs we will stick to the guidance that Massimo has given in the sense that it will be EUR770 million plus small adjustment there, it could be EUR5 million to EUR10 million, but with very little impact in terms of films because really we don't have much in the pipeline for the fourth quarter. ------------------------------ Kiko Alum, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Publiespana General Manager of Marketing [5] ------------------------------ Okay. About the difference between TV and internet, as a result of the market demand our selling force is fully integrated and all of our sales executives do sell advertising both on internet and TV at the same time. Then we are not going -- we don't have this number in this moment. For us, it's the same now in this moment, in our package -- commercial packages, TV and internet, and is giving us an excellent result for the moment. About the last Q, the 4Q of this year, the fourth quarter has started well. The advertising market in October has increased slightly, but the fourth quarter market performance will be subject to the evolution between the second half of November and the first part of December. These are the strongest 30 days of the entire quarter due to the fact that in this period we have many Christmas campaigns -- perfumes and other retail items and toys, mainly toys. Don't forget that for us the kids channel in this part of the year is really important competitor here is up and (inaudible) Disney. And these last nine months, the last two weeks of November and December are all important. And we still negotiate these campaigns, then we'll have to wait to finish this negotiation. I think we will finish to negotiate at the end of next week. And then -- but in this moment we cannot tell you what is going to be the market in November and December. But, of course, as we have reached the floor during this quarter, but we can say you have to wait one week to (inaudible) format has been exactly positive and we have to wait until November and December. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [6] ------------------------------ About Digital Plus, as we all know, in the last month there have been lots of rumors and speculation regarding a possible sale by [Preeza] for their control stake in Digital Plus, but the truth is that nothing concrete so far happened on this front. Therefore, it's difficult for me to comment, to give you information about something that doesn't still happen. The only thing that I can say, the thing that I stated in the previous call, that we are a shareholder of Digital Plus, so we -- it's our duty and obligation to keep our eyes opened and following the evolution of events, especially because, as I said, we are shareholder and also because we have an excellent working relationship with the two other shareholders. But at this stage there are no news and no evolution on this deal. ------------------------------ Adrien de Saint Hilaire, Exane BNP Paribas - Analyst [7] ------------------------------ Okay. Thank you very much. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [8] ------------------------------ Thank you, Adrien. ------------------------------ Operator [9] ------------------------------ The next question comes from Julien Roch from Barclays. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Julien Roch, Barclays - Analyst [10] ------------------------------ Yes, good evening, everybody. My first question is on the discount. If I look at the discount in Q3, it looks there were EUR1.4 million, i.e., minus 1% versus advertising, and there used to be 6%. So, is there -- is 1% the new normal discount, or is a one-off effect. Because looking at the internet first results, it looks like it was still 6% for them. That's my first question. The second one is I understand it's difficult now because you've put internet with TV, but the Infoadex numbers for Q3 indicate you went down 6.6 in TV while the market was down 2.7, which would indicate you lost share. So, can you explain why that is and what you think your market share would be in Q4? And finally, could we have slide 12 for Q3, please? Strike the last question, apologies. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [11] ------------------------------ So then, what was the last question? ------------------------------ Julien Roch, Barclays - Analyst [12] ------------------------------ No last question. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [13] ------------------------------ Okay, about the [INCs], we have, as you know, have one-on-one agreements and we have updated the full-year estimation. We're going to split a change in our grade, which is now 4.7% for the rest of this year. We have yet update in this moment that our estimation that we are not going to change anymore in this year. About the third quarter, according to Infoadex, it's true that we have a loss of the [patient] share in this quarter. This quarter, the third quarter, is with the option on big export (inaudible), the third quarter is not only a weak quarter for us. We are not totally -- we don't totally with Infoadex of the patient share, but one point in the third quarter is one point and EUR5 million, no more than that. And this is slightly different in this case. We think that at the end of this year we are going to be leader in market share. We are going to be in the region of 44% of market share. In October, we have achieved that market share and we are in line with -- we know that the third quarter is always hard quarter for us and our best quarter is much better, the last quarter, because we have also the kid channel that is really important for us. ------------------------------ Julien Roch, Barclays - Analyst [14] ------------------------------ Okay. And just to come back on the rate, so it used to be 6% and you're saying that now your sort of full year is going to be 4.7%. So, you probably haven't negotiated the rate for next year, but do you think that the rate next year will be 4.7% as well, or do you think that it can go down further as you already reduce it from 6% to 4.7%? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [15] ------------------------------ Okay. With this question -- as you can imagine, this is a very delicate point for the business for us because it's our negotiation with many (inaudible) and we are not going to be finding (inaudible) for the next year because we'll have to negotiate with the [INsing]. Then, I cannot answer this question at this moment. ------------------------------ Julien Roch, Barclays - Analyst [16] ------------------------------ Okay, thank you. Muchas gracias. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [17] ------------------------------ Thank you, Julien. ------------------------------ Operator [18] ------------------------------ The next question comes from the line of Laurie Davison from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Laurie Davison, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [19] ------------------------------ Hi, there. It's Laurie here from Deutsche. The first question is just on this fourth quarter cost flexibility you mentioned. You mentioned EUR5 million to EUR10 million on the EUR770 million. Is that both upwards and downwards, or is that just EUR5 million to EUR10 million savings you could make if your advertising in November and December is a bit disappointing? The second question is just what you're expecting for the Digital Plus associate contribution now for the full year given what you've seen in the third quarter. It doesn't look as though they're able to make the offset on the Champions League right costs that are coming through. And the third question is just on Formula One rights. If Antena do pass up those rights next year, would you be interested in bidding for them? Thanks. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [20] ------------------------------ Okay, start from the last question, Formula One rights. I'm sure that if and when Formula One rights will be offered to the market we will look at them. We are able (inaudible) and we are interested in any contents -- premium contents that is on the market. So, if the current owner of the rights decides to sell them, we will look at them. In terms of cost of full EUR770 million the cap. So, when I say that we have flexibility of EUR5 million to EUR10 million, it means that we can spend something less than EUR770 million. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [21] ------------------------------ And in terms of Digital Plus, of course, what we have done so far is to book the loss, our 22% stake in the loss of the Company, the accounting loss that we have booked, and that's it. And, of course, it's very difficult to think that way. There are only three months left. That negative impact is going to disappear. So, we'll have that. A different issue is whether -- is the value of the asset as we have in our books. As you know, the accounting obligation in Spain is that you have to book a loss, so you have to an impairment the minute that you see that there is reason instability, that there is a downfall in the value of asset or else once a year, which is what we will do at the end of the year because we had -- there's an accounting rule that obliges you to do so. ------------------------------ Laurie Davison, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [22] ------------------------------ Okay. And sorry, just to come back on the fourth on the last point you made there, just about impairment, do you have any -- you must have a fairly good idea now of where roughly that value for Digital Plus is. So, can you help us a little bit as to whether an impairment is likely? ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [23] ------------------------------ We do not have that now. We don't have that now. The only thing that we have seen is that there is a loss in the Company, but this could be just a temporary thing having to do with a series of issues that have taken place. But no reason to believe that there's an indication of a lower value. Like I said, we had the obligation to do it when we had the certainty that that's the case or at least once a year, and that point hasn't happened yet. We will do it at the end of last year, but right now we don't have any indication that this could be -- that there could be different value for the asset. ------------------------------ Laurie Davison, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [24] ------------------------------ Okay. But just to be clear, you mentioned for the full year you expect those losses to continue at the associate level, presuming that you were expecting another further loss in fourth quarter. So, from the EUR12 million associate negative we had in nine months you'd expect another negative on top of that? ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [25] ------------------------------ We'll see. I don't have -- I don't know what's going to happen, again, till that -- in the year, are we going to have a loss? The amount of which will have to be determined at the end of the year. But, of course, if we're going to have a loss at this point in time, I don't know what that loss will be. ------------------------------ Laurie Davison, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [26] ------------------------------ Okay. All right. Thank you. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [27] ------------------------------ Thank you, Laurie. ------------------------------ Operator [28] ------------------------------ The next question comes from Omar Sheikh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Omar Sheikh, Credit Suisse - Analyst [29] ------------------------------ Hi, everyone. I've got three questions, if I could. Firstly, if I could ask about costs for next year. Could you just give us how much, so which costs are going to be dropping out in '14 versus '13? So, I know that obviously you're not going to repeat Confederations Cup expense next year, and I'm guessing there's going to be half a year of the right that you have for the Spanish National League Soccer right up to the World Cup, which also won't be in for a full year in 2014. Could you tell us what the combined cost of those two rights are and whether there are any other rights that won't be repeated in '14? Because that will give us some help in understanding what the base is going into next year. That's the first question. Secondly, again, going back to the agency rebates that you've negotiated down in Q3. Could you just help us understand why it is the agency has agreed to do that? I appreciate it's obviously -- you can't give us guidance on next year, but it would just be useful to understand why there was a virtually zero payment during the quarter. And then finally, just on use of cash, you're obviously probably going to end up at the end of the year somewhere between EUR120 million and EUR130 million net cash on the current run rate, depending on what you do on costs. But can you give us a sense at this point as to whether or not you're going to be paying a dividend for 2013, what sort of payout we should expect, or whether you expect to buy anything in terms of M&A? That would be useful. Thank you. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [30] ------------------------------ Let's start from your first question, costs 2014. As you may know, we used to provide an annual cost guidance at the beginning of the year. Why? Because we do truly believe that the guidance is a commitment for the Company with the market. And we take it really seriously. The yearly guidance that I normally give you at the beginning of any year is normally based on the cost budget, the budget has been approved by the board of directors, and it means that before giving you a new target, before telling you which costs to enter and which costs go out I need to finalize the 2014 budget. It's true that there are some new events for (inaudible). We'll have the Football World Cup and also the Basketball World Cup. This year, we have had the Confederation Cup and the European Basketball, so probably the two [basket] events could have the same price, the same value. And in any case, the Brazilian World Cup is surely more expensive than the Confederation Cup. This year, we have broadcasted also several (inaudible) of the Spanish team for the qualifying for the World Cup, and next year this metrics won't be less. I remind now that we only have a couple of friendly metrics before the World Cup. So, this is the trade-off in terms of events. In terms of costs, I said just you to wait a couple of months and, as usual, I'll give you exactly in euros the cost guidance for next year. ------------------------------ Kiko Alum, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Publiespana General Manager of Marketing [31] ------------------------------ On the agency's discounts, we have on (inaudible) with each [medialiar], with the chief medialiar that we manage completely different. Then, we estimate that some medialiars are going to reach the (inaudible) and others not. That's the idea. And next year will be another thing, another business, and we are going to try to reach ultimate and include that on the agreements with the medialiars. But this for me is really difficult to talk about that because there are three medialiars in Spain. Is really sensitive point, delicate point for me to talk about that because these are really important information and there are just three. They say they have to do anything. I am telling you everything about our strategy, but I cannot talk about that. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [32] ------------------------------ About the uses of cash flow, the number that you put on the table for the end of the year, those EUR420 million, EUR430 million, probably that's just an extrapolation of the number of EUR56 million that we have at the end of September. But mind you, that as we know, we have a cost -- we had a cost guideline for this year. We haven't approached the business in the sense that we're going to be spending more in the last part of the year as the advertising market improves. So, we're likely to be short of that number. But in any case, we will get to -- we will end up the year with cash which will be at least what we have now at the end of September. In that respect, what are we going to do with the cash? I can tell you that in terms of dividends, what we did this year was an exceptional decision by the board not to distribute a dividend in view of the [cyclesize] of the market. As you know, our dividend policy such has not changed, so there will be other time when the board meets again at the beginning of the this year and decides. But in principle our dividend policy has not changed. And, of course, this cash that we have, the first advantage that we have with it is in terms of operational needs, but, of course, could be used, although at this stage there is absolutely nothing in terms of further uses, M&A or things like that, but we will see what happens. ------------------------------ Omar Sheikh, Credit Suisse - Analyst [33] ------------------------------ Okay, great. That's very kind and very clear. Could I just ask one follow-up, if I may? Could we get a data point for October advertising? You said it was up slightly. Could you quantify that? And could you say whether or not you guys have outperformed the market in October? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [34] ------------------------------ The market in October has been slightly positive. I'm not going to give you a number that's mainly more than 1%, 2%, but slightly positive. And our performance, I'd prefer it to wait until the end of the quarter because this is our main quarter, our more important quarter for us, and I don't want to give this kind of information. Because in this quarter for us, we have two competitors -- we have [Antena 3] and we have also Disney Channel. For us is a real important (inaudible) and yes, fighting with Disney for a big part of the pie, of the keys to them. I prefer just to say slightly positive and that's it. I'm sorry for that. ------------------------------ Omar Sheikh, Credit Suisse - Analyst [35] ------------------------------ Okay, no worries. Thank you very much, indeed. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [36] ------------------------------ Thank you, Omar. ------------------------------ Operator [37] ------------------------------ The next question comes from the line of Fabian Lares from JP Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Fabian Lares, JP Capital Markets - Analyst [38] ------------------------------ Hi, good afternoon. With regards to your performance, could you let us know, if possible, in the third quarter, looking at the figures here and mentioning the inventory decline that you've had, what right now your capacity situation will be like in terms of whether you obviously are not at capacity? In past statements you mentioned obviously that it requires a higher capacity in order to raise prices further, so if you could give us some idea of where in terms of your average capacity is on your grid for advertising, this would be helpful. That will be my first question. The second, with regards to the possible evolution of costs, you mentioned EUR770 million plus or minus EUR5 million to EUR10 million depending on the evolution -- as I understood it, the evolution of the fourth quarter, is there a way that there could be anything you foresee in terms of content coming online in the short to mid-term that would require more resources, aside from the World Cup, that you already have assigned, although you haven't mentioned how much this is worth, that we should be thinking about for 2014? ------------------------------ Kiko Alum, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Publiespana General Manager of Marketing [39] ------------------------------ Okay. I will take the capacity in the last -- from the third quarter. We have decreased our capacity in seconds by almost 4%. That means our capacity in this moment is around 85%, was at 15% of our seconds unsold. We have more unsold in daytime than in the prime time. And this is due because our pricing policy, but you knew that. And I don't know if you want to know anything else about the capacity. ------------------------------ Fabian Lares, JP Capital Markets - Analyst [40] ------------------------------ But that's the average? I'm sorry. In the prime time, you have less capacity -- you have more --? ------------------------------ Kiko Alum, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Publiespana General Manager of Marketing [41] ------------------------------ Yes. In prime time, is around 10% unsold, 90% at full capacity has been sold in prime time. And in the total days are 115% unsold. That means 85% of the capacity is full. ------------------------------ Fabian Lares, JP Capital Markets - Analyst [42] ------------------------------ Okay. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [43] ------------------------------ In terms of for content for 2014, in my previous answer I highlighted only the main difference between the year 2013 and the year 2014. In any case, next year we will continue broadcasting (inaudible) metrics or the Spanish League on Monday nights. We will have the Europe League metrics in the friendly (inaudible) make sure the Spanish National Team. And, of course, we will have also the MotoGP Races. So, all of these events are the same all this year; therefore, we don't expect any main difference -- material difference in terms of costs. Probably, we will broadcast lower number -- a lower number of metrics over the Spanish -- for the Spanish National Team, would expect to see us. The events that we have already contracted, it's for during the next months that would be other opportunity, other sports (technical difficulty) rights in the market, we will decide if buy or not, depending on the prices, depending on the quality of the events, depending on several things. ------------------------------ Fabian Lares, JP Capital Markets - Analyst [44] ------------------------------ Okay, thank you. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [45] ------------------------------ Thank you, Fabian. ------------------------------ Operator [46] ------------------------------ The next question comes from the line of [Chris Ginman] from HSBC. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Chris Ginman, HSBC - Analyst [47] ------------------------------ Yes, it's Chris from HSBC. Thank you for taking my questions. It's a bit more qualitative. If you could, maybe a first one on the just advertising sentiment. Is there any sort of color you can provide on, for example, the movement you see with, say, your top 25 or top 50 advertisers? And do you see more of a move or an interest of the advertisers wanting to book more prime time? Any sort of color on that would be appreciated. And then maybe a second question. I'm sure you've been following your European competitors who more or less seem to be more and more going into the direction of using their air time to sell also to ventures sort of business, doing media faculty for revenue deals. What do you see with respect to that field in the Spanish market, and are you interested in that? Those would be my two questions. Thank you. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [48] ------------------------------ A lot of the sectors -- we have two main sectors now in October. We can talk about October. The main sector, or the sector that is giving us a lot of happiness is telecoms. That is performing really well. Of course, telecoms wants -- the consumer wants to buy out of prime time, putting in prime time, high qualities, short commercial breaks, first position. It's a very, very demanding sector, but for us is an excellent [new]. And the other is beauty. Beauty is spending more money than last year. I think this is good news for the Christmas period and this is October. We hope -- we expect that it's going to continue into November and December, but I have said before we have to wait because we haven't finished all the negotiations. They are on the table, big, important negotiations that will have to conclude -- we didn't conclude in this moment. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [49] ------------------------------ Yes. On the issue of advertising for equity, in fact, we started to work on this project, as we saw that some European partners have been doing the same thing. And we started this project at the beginning of this year. We have a start-up phase. We have an experimental phase. We are now in the investment phase. We are doing this jointly with Mediaset in Italy. We have dedicated teams, both in Italy and in Spain, and we are already advancing and doing things basically on, like I said, the two main starting phases -- the start-up and the experimental phase. And now, we're going to head to -- hopefully, once we have selected a certain number of names, we're going to head on to the investment phase. But like I said, we are being active on this front. ------------------------------ Chris Ginman, HSBC - Analyst [50] ------------------------------ Maybe just a quick follow-on on that. Is this mainly really just media faculty revenue deals? So, are you also willing to go more into the venture and [early start phase]? I'm not sure if I got you right on whether you see yourself more in the start-up phase of these developments or whether this includes actual start-up investments. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [51] ------------------------------ So far, we are more focusing on equity for advertising. That's it. And this stage in the process, we're just more focusing on that. ------------------------------ Chris Ginman, HSBC - Analyst [52] ------------------------------ Perfect. Very clear. Thank you. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [53] ------------------------------ Thank you, Chris. ------------------------------ Operator [54] ------------------------------ The next question comes from Filippo Lo Franco from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [55] ------------------------------ Yes, good afternoon, everyone. So, I have two questions on cost, on the OpEx. The first is please if you could remind us what are in Q4, the programming costs, in particular in sports, which will impact the overall OpEx? And the second one is the following -- when I look in the past at the OpEx of the former Telecinco and before the arrival of Cuatro-laSexta, you used to have roughly EUR500 million to EUR600 million of operating costs. Now we are back in a situation where we are -- that Spanish market -- TV market is back in a duopoly satiation. I would like to understand why your cost base, if you are really going to do EUR770 million, has increased so much given that the overall economy actually shrunk? Thank you. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [56] ------------------------------ Sorry, Filippo, I didn't get your -- your first question we didn't get. Could you please repeat it? ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [57] ------------------------------ The first question is which programming are going to impact the Q4? And in sports, in particular? ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [58] ------------------------------ Sports rights, basically there's not going to be anything significant. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [59] ------------------------------ In the last quarter of this year, we have the Spanish League on Monday night with some some (inaudible) with League -- Euro League. We have to make (inaudible) of Spanish TV and friendly metrics, of course. And we also have the last motorbike race next week in Valencia. (inaudible), if I remember. ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [60] ------------------------------ Okay. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [61] ------------------------------ And your second point, I really don't think that the costs have increased. As a matter of fact, as we have seen in some of the slides, the costs on an aggregate basis have come down quite significantly in the last few years, the acquisition of Cuatro. ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [62] ------------------------------ What I was saying is that if you said if you look in the past, really before the arrival of Cuatro-laSexta, you used to have -- I have the data here. Roughly EUR600 million of total cost in the past. So, I would like to understand why the cost base, now that we are back in a EBIT situation of before the arrival of the Cuatro-laSexta have increased permanently? ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [63] ------------------------------ One thing is the number of channels. Filippo, we had gone from one single channel before the acquisition of -- ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [64] ------------------------------ Okay. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [65] ------------------------------ -- Cuatro-laSexta. For that matter, we have increased the number of channels to eight channels. ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [66] ------------------------------ Okay. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [67] ------------------------------ Right? So that's -- ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [68] ------------------------------ That's the main -- that's the main increase, you think? ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [69] ------------------------------ Yes, that makes a difference, of course, yes. ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [70] ------------------------------ Okay. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [71] ------------------------------ Thank you, Filippo. ------------------------------ Filippo Lo Franco, JPMorgan - Analyst [72] ------------------------------ Thank you. ------------------------------ Operator [73] ------------------------------ The next question comes from the line of Ivon Leal from BBVA. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Ivon Leal, BBVA - Analyst [74] ------------------------------ Hello. Good evening, everybody. Just three questions, maybe around the advertising share. You just mentioned that you expect to close the year with 44%. Taking a year, let's say, without major sports event, that 44% is kind of your target that you want to maintain going forward, or there's no retarget about the advertising share? The second one is maybe you could remind us what was the impact of the last World Cup on the advertising share, okay, to see what we can expect it for 2014. That's pretty -- we make it to the final, no? And maybe the last one is are there any -- if you could share a bit of your feeling about that 12% advertising share which is retained by the regional TVs and pay TVs and et cetera. I'm only looking to two to three year's time, if you have a sense of how that should perform? Whether that should increase a bit or we think that that should tend to continue to decrease? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [75] ------------------------------ The World Cup -- the impact of the World Cup was, last year, around 1.2% share -- ------------------------------ Ivon Leal, BBVA - Analyst [76] ------------------------------ Okay. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [77] ------------------------------ -- 1.2, more or less. Because remember of the Spanish team won the right to the final and won the final in (inaudible). Our target, we don't have really advertising share target. We think the idea will bring now we are combining TV and internet together, then we question our way of selling TV and internet, but we think that around 44% will be a good advertising share. But in this case, for us, still important, is we are able to increase a lot the sales in internet, for that is reasonably important in this case because we are really strong -- Mediaset is really strong in online devices, and then we'll have to increase our incomes. ------------------------------ Ivon Leal, BBVA - Analyst [78] ------------------------------ Okay. And what about that 12% advertising share, which is [hold] by the regional TVs? What do you think about that? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [79] ------------------------------ (inaudible) -- 12% is really, is less than 12% maybe, but is -- we have our really important -- we have one new important TV that is TV Thursday, [de Calaluna] internet TV. This is really strong in this area, and this area is really important in terms of performing. And also, [Marguerite]. Marguerite, another TV development. [Telemareet] is not only strong. The answer to that question is what is going to happen with these kind of TVs? They are going to buy films, they are going to buy the sports, they are going to fight for the audience, and they are going to be public to this. I don't have the answer for that. I need this answer. ------------------------------ Ivon Leal, BBVA - Analyst [80] ------------------------------ Okay. Maybe just a follow-up. I don't know if you can give us a number on that. Probably, you guys, when you look at the programming grid you've made your assumption on what is the cost, now the marginal cost, to get an additional 1% of advertising share? Can you guys do that? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [81] ------------------------------ No, you cannot do that. It depends on the size of the market. It depends on the audience, the quality of the audience of the prime time and late time. And it also depends if you steal this extra point from one of our competitors or from another channel, then it's not so easy like that. One point of share -- to answer that question, first we have to know the size of the market. And we're still negotiating November and December, and it's really difficult to make this kind of number because we don't know the size of the market for (inaudible). ------------------------------ Kiko Alum, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Publiespana General Manager of Marketing [82] ------------------------------ There is another -- let's say there is a tiny difference between the moment when we decide the programming grid and the moment in which we broadcast it and Publiespana sells the advertising. We normally think about a new program approximately six, nine months before to start to produce. So, it is not automatic to increase one point. The only event, though -- the only flexibility that we have on this point is to broadcast a movie from some big movie and then you can -- or to double some episodes of some fiction that we have in the library. But normally, it's not automatic -- ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [83] ------------------------------ And another question of that is the same thing, [case] one point in Telecinco, in Cuatro, in any TV, it's completely different. There is not -- it's not like that. It's not an automatic operation that we can do easily. No, no, no, no, no. ------------------------------ Ivon Leal, BBVA - Analyst [84] ------------------------------ Okay. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [85] ------------------------------ As our CEO always says, costs are like mothers and the revenues are like fathers. When you decide a program and you are sure the cost is through and the revenues -- ------------------------------ Ivon Leal, BBVA - Analyst [86] ------------------------------ Okay, that's great. Thank you so much. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [87] ------------------------------ Thanks, Ivon. ------------------------------ Operator [88] ------------------------------ The next question comes from the line of Lisa Yang from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, madam. ------------------------------ Lisa Yang, Goldman Sachs - Analyst [89] ------------------------------ Hi, good evening. Unfortunately, I have another question on your costs for the full year. So, if you do EUR770 million, I think that would imply something like EUR30 million increase in Q4. And if you include the movie savings, it will actually be EUR60 million. It doesn't seem to me that you have extra -- the sports programs you have in Q4 you think are different from Q3. So, can you just explain to us what -- where you're going to explain all that money in Q4? And also, you talk a lot about adjusting your costs to the [verity] of the ad market. So, let's say we assume no consensus at plus 6% on next year, let's say plus, I don't know, 10% or 15% in the following years. How are you thinking about your costs on that basis? Are you planning also something like mixing a little high single digit cost increase to adjust to the better advertising markets? And my last question is on the tax for the movie deduction. Can you just give us a guidance for the full year or just remind us of the guidance? Thank you very much. ------------------------------ Javier Uria, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion - Group CFO [90] ------------------------------ Okay, I'll start with your last point. The tax rate for the year, as I think I anticipated in an earlier call, is at -- we're going to have a deduction of approximately EUR10 million to EUR11 million, and that will be the deduction that you have to apply to the 30% tax on the pre-tax number that you might come up with. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [91] ------------------------------ About the guidance of EUR770 million, I said that we have EUR5 million to EUR10 million flexibility. Why? Because depending on the level of the competition between Mediaset and these main competitors, depending on the evolution of the advertising market, depending on the Christmas campaigns of our main clients, we have the possibility to do something more. As I stated before, we can move or change the title of some movies, putting some more expensive movie in place of another cheaper, or we can double some -- let's say, we [can reinforce] our programming grid depending on the market evolution. On this basis, also considering that the market is exactly holding like we forecasted the beginning of the year and we build the end of last year our cost to budget, thinking that the last quarter of this year would be back down in the beginning of the year. Therefore, we are in line with our budget. So for this reason I prefer not to change. For the future -- if the market -- advertising market will improve, of course, depending on the level of competition, we can try to do something. At the end of the day, our programming grid now is a good programming grid, but we have stated cost in differences a lot today. Just the same for Cuatro, is probably determined it is now paying more than other channel, the macroeconomic crisis, we will remain -- our objective is to remain profitable. So, in some point of the programming grid, in terms of (inaudible), we have to cut. And for Telecinco, the problem that Cuatro has in the afternoons, at this moment we don't have enough money for try to solve it. There is -- I always say that there is a tiny difference between the recovery of the advertising market and the cost of the programming grid because now we don't buy programs or products for one year. Now, all the contracts that we have signed or that we have signed in this two, three (inaudible) has been made at a price of the current macroeconomic situation. So, when indeed the advertising market will recover, we will have a quick increase in the advertising revenues. And let's say part of our cost has been negotiating in a different economic moment, so we have some year -- one or two years to different protection with respect to a possible increase of part of our content. ------------------------------ Lisa Yang, Goldman Sachs - Analyst [92] ------------------------------ So, how much -- how many of you -- how much of you contract for next year would be kind of fixed, already negotiated? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [93] ------------------------------ Of course, we buy rights -- we buy rights with a two or three-year contract, so let's say the library -- we can say the movies and cities have been already booked for next year. Production normally in [ultra] program are normally produced part -- once to this -- or our program is produced by a company in which we have a small stake, so we can control the cost of this product. So, I think that -- I don't know exactly the percentage, but an important part of the next year products is now under contract. ------------------------------ Lisa Yang, Goldman Sachs - Analyst [94] ------------------------------ Right. Thank you very much. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [95] ------------------------------ Thank you, Lisa. ------------------------------ Operator [96] ------------------------------ The last question comes from the line of Fernando Cordero from Banco Santander. Please go ahead, sir. ------------------------------ Fernando Cordero, Banco Santander - Analyst [97] ------------------------------ Hello, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question, only one. Although recently it seems that the notion defund is less in terms than in previous quarters. Could you give us an update on the current negotiations with the government regarding the proposed return of the DTT channels, of the two in the case of Mediaset Espana? ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [98] ------------------------------ As you may know, we said in the previous call the Mediaset Espana (inaudible), the decision, the Minister Council before the Supreme Court, both individually and collectively through the prior finished association [Ortega]. In our opinion, the same things over the Supreme Court will not necessarily mean the cancellation or definition of channel, nor that it affects the liberation of the digital dividend. Old (inaudible) -- the real -- the reasonable factor is still waiting for news from the Supreme Court. For now, the Industry Minister met today, are studying a new plan. It should be adopted in the next few months. This new plan would comply with the judgments of the Supreme Court, but the details and exactly how it will be carried out still remain unknown. In any case, we are confident that there is still time and room to reach a satisfactory agreement for all parties involved. I think that we have to wait for a couple of months more to have a clear picture of what the government decides. ------------------------------ Fernando Cordero, Banco Santander - Analyst [99] ------------------------------ Okay. Many thanks. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [100] ------------------------------ Thank you, Fernando. ------------------------------ Luca Giammatteo, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - IR [101] ------------------------------ It's time now to close the conference call. Thanks, everybody, for attending. At the Investor Relation Department, we are ready to take your eventual further questions, so do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you very much. Goodbye. ------------------------------ Massimo Musolino, Mediaset Espana Comunicacion SA - General Operations Manager [102] ------------------------------ Bye-bye.
