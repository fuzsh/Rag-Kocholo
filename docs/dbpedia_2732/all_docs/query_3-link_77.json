Ampere Analysis forecast a few days back that in 2024 51% of Netflix ’s $15.4 billion #film and TV budget will be spent on titles made outside the U.S. Global content spent, excluding sports, will soar 40% over 2022-28, while U.S. spend will plunge 20%. Reasons? One is that much of international, led by Central and South America (+19%) is less sub-saturated, Variety’s VIP+ suggests. Post Peak #TV Festival Bump This sea change has large consequences for TV events. “The internationalization of content is continuing apace and I can’t see that lessening or reversing,” Ampere Analysis’ Guy Bisson tells Variety. “The re-invigoration of the licensing market also points to expanded opportunity for international content and so festivals fulfil a two-pronged opportunity to pick up projects in the development stage as well as locating high quality finished programming that has shown pedigree in one or more international markets,” he adds. Other Reasons for International TV Growth “In #Europe, all the streamers have obligations, especially in #France, to produce European or French content,” says SERIES MANIA founder and general director Laurence Herszberg. “Also, streamers realize it’s cheaper to produce outside the U.S. Diversifying production, they can still make shows which attract viewers who are ever more interested in the usual American and U.K. series,” she adds. Led by the highly curated Series Mania, festivals act as quality filters, through selection and prizes, and new talent platforms. At the Forum, Sony Pictures Entertainment Television’s Wayne Garvie, Groupe TF1 ’s Rodolphe Buet and Movistar Plus+’s Domingo Corral will deliver masterclasses. Key debating points may well take in cost contention, the move towards “lighter” feeling programming, and the surge of co-production via a diversity of business models. #streaming\n\nThe trade journal for the broadcast industry, 'Broadcast Magazine,' has asked our founder and CEO Marc Putman to document his activities for one week, thus offering readers a glimpse behind the scenes of the breadth in which OUTtv Media operates within the European media landscape. Monday: Launch of PRIDEtv on PLUTO Today is an important day for us: we are exclusively launching on Paramount's platform Pluto TV, the largest FAST* platform and the fastest-growing branch in our media landscape. Here we are introducing our new offering PRIDEtv, a queer programming channel featuring primarily short format content (shorts, music, documentaries, miniseries) in more than 34 countries. Our partners, Your Channels and Media Choice, have worked hard over the past months to implement this technology and make the launch possible. They have processed hundreds of items, created separate feeds for various European countries, and now we are active for the first time across Latin America. Adding FAST to our portfolio not only offers commercial exploitation opportunities but also a new marketing tool to entice viewers into paid conversion to our premium content. My afternoon starts with a Teams call with our international acquisition team to discuss the results of the Cannes Film Festival. We have already acquired several new films and completed deals on the spot, and for some films, we still need to further negotiate and assess the exploitation potential. Among others, we have acquired the impressive Belgian film AMAL, the Brazilian film Perfect Endings, and the Italian TV series The Club. We focus on queer stories that provide a global cultural representation of our LGBTI community. At 2:00 PM, I have a meeting with the European Commission, our international sales partner Brandadvance, and Paramount. To support our technical launch today, we will organize a Rainbow Brunch on Thursday, June 20th, during PRIDE Day at the Lions Festival in Cannes and formally launch the PRIDEtv channels. Together with the cabinet of the Euro Commissioner for Equality, Mrs. Monti, Ellen, Vice President of Paramount and founder of PLUTO, Olivier, and Chris from Brandadvance, we will discuss the speeches and the panel discussion. We have also invited former Eurovision winner and OUTMedia Award winner Conchita Wurst to musically support the launch. After this meeting, I have planned to prepare a presentation for a new lead in Latin America interested in selling our proposition in this region to local operators. In the evening, I will play a game of padel with my Spanish neighbor to burn off the calories from this workday and clear my mind.

No, but they are giving them more and more of the stuff that they already watched, which doesn't help. It comes down to basic supply and demand - too many films are being made for a small addressable audience, thus the market is contracting. Sure, the government could fund a diverse slate of interesting films but that doesn't mean that anyone is going watch them. In my opinion the sustainable solution isn't glamorous or groundbreaking - it's simply fewer, high quality films that are properly marketed to a highly targeted and engaged audience.

This report provides an analysis of the offer of films and TV content in 2022 provided by a sample of 1331 European TV channels and also gives a view of evolutions between 2018 and 2022. Key findings include: - Over 88 000 works in the EU and over 155 000 works in wider Europe were broadcast at least once. (Works considered: films and made-for-TV works excluding sports, news, games, talk shows, reality shows, music, education, religion. For TV series: 1 season=1 work) The figure includes over 27 000 and over 32 000 European films in the EU and in wider Europe, respectively. On average, about 2 300 European #films and 1 300 European #TV show seasons were broadcast in a given country. - European works accounted for 43% of works broadcast in the #EU in 2022, almost on a par with US works (46%). (This report does not intend to measure the quotas foreseen in the #AVMS directive. In particular this report focuses on first runs and not all runs by a given TV channel; it uses, as the main indicator, number of films or #TV shows seasons and not duration; it deals with programming genres that are not aligned with the legal definitions of ‘works’, at least in certain countries.) Among European works, EU27 works accounted for 70% and other European works for 30%. Figures were similar when considering not only EU countries but wider Europe. - A higher share of European works for TV shows: whether in the EU or in wider Europe, the share of European works was higher for TV shows (measured in number of seasons) than for films. - A higher share of European works for documentary films: About two thirds of documentary films broadcast were European, vs. about 40% for all films. - More European non-national works than national works: In the EU, EU27 national works accounted for 36% of European works, EU27 non-national works for 34%, and other, non-EU European countries for 30%.

The stand will be home to key Ukrainian media companies and creative powerhouses, including FILM.UA Group, Starlight Media, 1+1 media, and Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine | Suspilne Ukraine, during 8-10 April 2024 at Palais des Festivals, Cannes. Analytical note on the Ukrainian market by MRM: 2023 was a period of recovery for the Ukrainian AV industry, searching for opportunities and moving from the survival models that emerged with the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion to full-fledged work and development in the new environment. As a result, the Ukrainian ad market grew by 77% over the year, demonstrating the return of some sectors to pre-war levels. TV rebounded quicker than anticipated, while Digital TV (ad on OTT platforms) emerged as a new direction, projected to grow by up to 70% this year. 17 new TV channels appeared in the country, including 7 nationwide ones. Major film festivals and industry events resumed, and 13 new cinemas opened. The total box office in 2023 amounted to over $60 mln, exceeding the figures for 2020, 2021 and 2022 in national currency. Additionally, the share of Ukrainian films in the BO reached 14.7%, marking a significant increase from the previous maximum of 10%. In 2023, the largest Ukrainian channels broadcast over 300h of series and over 600h of TV shows created during the full-scale war. In 2024, this positive trend continued: in less than three months, 10+ new shows debuted. These included adaptations of popular formats such as MasterChef, The Floor, I Love My Country, Family Feud, and Who Knew. Additionally, 15 new series premiered, totaling over 150h, with most produced during the full-scale war. Currently, at least 60h of drama series are in production and scheduled to premiere this year. Ukrainian docs production has increased significantly, with almost 150 factual titles airing on TV last year. Moreover, some of them performed as well as drama and entertainment shows. Additionally, there is a growing demand for documentary mainstream films, which are finding success both on TV and VODs. This trend has led to the development of a distinct production niche, in which industry experts see significant business potential for collaboration between Ukrainian and international market players. “All of this allows the industry to remain moderately optimistic. Everyone at MIPTV is very welcome to Ukrainian stand at P4C14 to find out more about our market and diverse business opportunities provided by the members of the Ukraine Content Club” – says Kateryna Udut, CEO of MRM consultancy and coordinator of the UCC initiative. To schedule a meeting with the Ukrainian delegation feel free to text us here on LinkedIn! Endless gratitude to RX Global for sustainable support for Ukraine and its media community. See you at MIPTV next week!"
