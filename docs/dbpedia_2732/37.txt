What's the opportunity in Mediaset España Comunicación?

According to my valuation model, Mediaset España Comunicación seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Mediaset España Comunicación today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is €7.37, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Mediaset España Comunicación’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.

What kind of growth will Mediaset España Comunicación generate?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -10% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Mediaset España Comunicación. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.

What this means for you:

Are you a shareholder? Currently, TL5 appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TL5 for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on TL5 should the price fluctuate below its true value.
