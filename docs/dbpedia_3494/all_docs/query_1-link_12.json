He would play guitar at events and festivals while he was still in high school. His first single, “In a Heartbeat,” which was released in 1997, spent one week on Billboard’s Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. His first successful single was “Honesty (Write Me a List),” which charted at No. 4 on the country charts and No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was the title track to his debut album “Honesty,” released in 2003.\n\nHe returned in 2006 with the single “If You’re Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows),” his first single to reach No. 1, spending four weeks at the top of the Hot Country Songs chart. This single was also the top country hit of 2006, according to the Billboard Year-End charts. His next single, “Watching You,” also spent four weeks as a No. 1 hit and was the top country song of 2007 on the Billboard Year-End charts. Two other songs off that album became No. 1 singles, making “If You’re Going Through Hell” the first country album to include four No. 1 singles since Tim McGraw’s “Set the Circus Down” in 2001. The album received platinum certification from the RIAA for shipments of one million copies. Atkins has released two more albums since then – “It’s America” in 2009 and “Take a Back Road” in 2011 – that both received positive reviews.\n\nKip Moore became a superstar with his debut album, which was released in 2012. He started playing guitar while he attended Wallace State Community College in Hanceville, Alabama. In 2004, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee and, eight years later, signed a record deal with MCA Nashville. His first album, “Up All Night,” was the bestselling debut album by a male in 2012 and 2013. It was certified platinum by the RIAA, and the single “Somethin’ ‘Bout a Truck” was certified 2x platinum. More has since released two more albums – “Wild Ones” in 2015 and “Slowheart” in 2017.\n\nClare Dunn is a country artist from Southeast Colorado. She signed with Universal Music Group Nashville and BMG, releasing her debut single “Get Out” at the end of 2013. She then became the highest-charting independent female artist on the Music Row Country Breakout chart in 10 years. Dunn was listed by Sounds Like Nashville as one of the artists to watch in 2017 for country music. She released two singles, “Move On” and “Tuxedo,” from her self-titled EP, and both charted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts. Dunn released her fifth single, “More,” in June of 2018.\n\nMorgan Evans is an Australian country music singer and songwriter. He released a self-titled debut studio album in March of 2014, which peaked at No. 20 on the ARIA Albums chart. At the 2014 CMC Music Awards, he won Oz Artist of the Year, Male Artist of the Year, and Best Australian Video of the Year. He eventually relocated to Nashville, where he signed with Warner Music Nashville in May of 2017. This led to the release of his debut U.S. single “Kiss Somebody.” On Dec. 8, 2017 he released his single “I Do” about his now wife, Kelsea Ballerini, and it became a huge hit at weddings in 2018.\n\nFroggy 101 is a part of Entercom, a leading American media and entertainment company and one of the top two radio broadcasters in the country, reaching over 100 million people each week through a robust portfolio of over 235 radio stations, digital platforms, and live events.
