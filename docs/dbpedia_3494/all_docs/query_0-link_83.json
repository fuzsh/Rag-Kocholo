        "text": "Thursday 3/31/16\n\nAs soon as I learned two of my ultimate favorites, Kip Moore and Kelsea Ballerini, would be at the 95.5 The Bull‚Äôs 8th Annual Guitar Pull, I made it a goal to attend! As most of you all know, this was a ‚Äúbudget trip‚Äù, so funds were limited. Per usual, I reached out to 95.5 for a chance to win some tickets, but heard nothing back. As fate would have it, my friend Chris had a pair of tickets and became ill, and he graciously donated them to me! So appreciative beyond words for this opportunity to see these artists acoustically in a laid back setting.\n\nUp first on stage was Hunter Hayes and Kelsea Ballerini! Kelsea started off by telling the crowd that her and Hunter are ‚Äúreal-life friends‚Äù and that he was actually with her when she found out that Dibs had reached number 1! (It appears that Cody Alan (her ‚Äúfavorite human‚Äù) was there too!\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nI‚Äôve always felt that the band members never get as much credit as the artists themselves. They can go out in public without being recognized (for the most part), and they rarely get to attend awards shows or join the main singers on stage when they win. Half of the time, they don‚Äôt even get to record their instruments on the record (there are of course exceptions to this rule!). After following certain bands for several years, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of changes. It seems like just after I‚Äôve finally located all of the band members on twitter and/or instagram, next show I go to, they‚Äôve already been replaced! I guess the supporting musicians aren‚Äôt as set in stone as the singers, but I still feel like they play a very important role. I highly respect artists like Kip Moore who make it a point to include his band members in all that he does, and publicly recognizes ‚ÄúThe Slow Hearts‚Äù as part of his success. We need more artists like him that truly believe in their band, and who know that it‚Äôs the support of the guys behind them on stage that make the live shows an amazing experience.\n\nTO ALL OF THE BAND MEMBERS: Thanks for all that you do! Your efforts and kick ass performances do not go unnoticed by the true fans!\n\nI think I will start with Kip Moore & The Slow Hearts, because I have so much friggin‚Äô respect for those guys! Besides, who else‚Äôs band has their own name? With the exception of a change in drummer, Kip has stuck with his original crew that he started off with.\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nHello Country Heartbeat readers! This week has been packed with events from the NHL¬Æ All-Star weekend where Dierks Bentley, Eli Young Band and Kelsea Ballerini preformed on a packed street in front of the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday. The Sunday show was the last of the daily concerts that were being preformed in downtown Nashville starting on Thursday. Other great musicians such as Big and Rich, Lo Cash, Lee Brice, Chris Young, Clare Bowen, Charles Esten and Russell Dickerson were part of the IntelliCentrics Honda NHL¬Æ All-Star Festivities Outdoor Concert Series presented by Bridgestone.\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to attend these shows because I was up in Cincinnati, Ohio at the Kip Moore Wild Ones Tour concert at Bogarts. Kip Moore and The Slow Hearts put on a great show as always, full of energy playing some classic Kip songs and new songs off the long awaited Wild Ones Album.\n\nTo end the weekend, on Tuesday I attended a benefit for the Crohn‚Äôs and Colitis Foundation at the High Watt on Cannery Row, hosted by Chris Cavanaugh and sponsored by Galena Garlic Company. Chris has been throwing this benefit for the past three years. Though Chris was the main performer, there were guest/friends who also performed. Chris invited some fellow songwriters who have written hits for many artists. Matt Rogers (‚ÄúWe Went‚Äù for Randy Houser), Jody Stevens ( ‚ÄúLemme See Ya Girl‚Äù for Cole Swindell and ‚ÄúHome Alone Tonight‚Äù for Luke Bryan), Doug Johnson (‚ÄúLove Like Crazy‚Äù for Lee Brice and ‚Äú3 Wooden Crosses‚Äù for Randy Travis), and Scott Stepakoff (‚ÄúLooking At Stars‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnderage‚Äù on the new Kelsea Ballerini album) also came out to help raise money. Chris Cavanaugh is a touring Nashville based musician from Missouri; he just released his new EP Footprints on My Windshield, which is available now on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon MP3 and Spotify. The benefit ended up raising over $3,000 for the CCFA even with the horrible weather and tornado warnings. Congrats to Chris for a successful night!\n\nI‚Äôll be posting in the next day events going on in Nashville for the week that people might want to attend‚Ä¶\n\n~CK\n\nToday when I logged into my WordPress account, I was notified of the above ‚Äúachievement‚Äù.

This album is so raw and full of so much passion that nearly every song gives me goosebumps. I‚Äôve been a fan of Kip since 2011, before most people had any idea of who he was. Albeit the entire CD is on point, the song that I have to play twice every time that the album cycles through is track #12, Running For You. Written with Blair Daly and Troy Verges, Kip explains, ‚ÄúThe melody came to me I was with Troy Verges and Blair Daly, and I said, ‚ÄòI got this thing.‚Äô We just kinda wrote a song about when you really care about somebody, you wanna see ‚Äôem shine and you wanna see ‚Äôem go grab what they‚Äôre after.‚Äù Kip‚Ä¶ I hope one day some man sings (or plays) me this song when I pack up and head to Nashville after my own dreams‚Ä¶\n\nOld Dominion, ‚ÄúSnapback‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThose stars need to be wished on / Your skin needs to be kissed on‚Äù\n\nI was literally hooked on this song from the first verse‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not your ordinary ‚ÄúTop 40‚Äù country song‚Ä¶ and that freshness and new sound is what is going to take it to the top. No doubt this song from their upcoming Meat and Candy album is going to reach #1. The upbeat and fun tempo and killer lyrics drew me in right away! My favorite line from the song? ‚ÄúWe got the beat, let‚Äôs drop it.‚Äù‚Ä¶ just the way Matt sings it! This song makes me SMILE SO BIG! I just love a song that makes me break out in a huge grin! Snapback was written by Matthew Ramsey, Trevor Rosen and Brad Tursi, who are actually 3 of the 5 members of the band.\n\nKelsea Ballerini, ‚ÄúSecondhand Smoke‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAm I the product of a problem that I couldn‚Äôt change?/Got his eyes, got her hair, so do I get their mistakes?‚Äù\n\nThis is the most powerful song on Kelsea‚Äôs debut album, The First Time. I have been passionate about this song since I first got the CD in June. Secondhand Smoke is a deeply personal song for Kelsea, as it tells the story of her parents divorce. You can hear the raw emotion in every verse. She penned this tune with Josh Kerr and Jordyn Shellhart and they actually came up with the title for the song before the lyrics were written! ‚ÄúImmediately, I thought it could be a story of being in a household that‚Äôs broken and that‚Äôs all you know, but you decide that you‚Äôre not going to feel like that,‚Äù Kelsea tells Rolling Stone. Kelsea hopes she can be a voice of comfort for kids who are going through a similar divorce situation like she did as a preteen.\n\nSongs you should be listening to (and downloading!) right now:\n\nKip Moore, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm to Blame‚Äù\n\nWe‚Äôve been waiting for his new album for over a year now‚Ä¶ his new single hit radio on February 2nd. Request it! It‚Äôs raw and honest and sexy‚Ä¶ bet you won‚Äôt be able to get the hook out of your head! Kip is one of my all time favorite artists and this song is so true to him and his personality.\n\nLove & Theft, ‚ÄúWhiskey on my Breath‚Äù\n\nLove & Theft is back with some amazing heart-felt and soul-filled harmonies. This song is GOLD. I have so much love for these two, and this is one of my favorite songs they‚Äôve written so far! This song better get the praise and recognition that it deserves!\n\nSam Hunt, ‚ÄúTake Your Time‚Äù\n\nI could not be more obsessed with Sam Hunt. His acoustic mix tape (Behind the Pines) and debut album (Montavello) are consistently on repeat in my car. This is his newest radio single and is currently at #5 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nOld Dominion, ‚ÄúBreak up With Him‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs been a number 1 hit on Sirus XM‚Äôs station, The Highway, but hasn‚Äôt dropped to radio yet. It‚Äôs a fan favorite at their live shows and when I saw them live, it‚Äôs the song that convinced me to buy their EP! Give it a listen!\n\nChase Bryant, ‚ÄúTake it on Back‚Äù\n\nCountry newcomer Chase Bryant is quickly making a name for himself. He is now on my ‚ÄúArtists I Want to See in Concert‚Äù list! Lyrically, this song is like 90% of all the other bro-country songs out there, but it‚Äôs catchy and is destined to be a radio hit."
