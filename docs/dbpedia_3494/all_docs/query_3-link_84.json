        "text": "Kip Moore is making his way up the country charts with the fan-favorite “The Bull,” from his Slowheart album. He says it’s not only his song, but it’s the song that tells the story of his fans’ lives, as well, and they have offered the star concrete proof.\n\n“I’ve heard thousands of stories from fans. This is definitely a favorite on the Slowheart record,” says Kip. “I’ve counted over a thousand tattoos in meet-and-greets all with ‘thanks to the bulls that bucked me off.’ This song is not only my song, but it’s every fan’s song.”\n\nFor more audio and liners on “The Bull,” click here.\n\nKip makes the trek north of the border later this week to play shows in Moncton (Thursday, April 18th), Halifax on Friday (April 19th) and Charlottesville, Canada on Saturday (April 20th).\n\nThis past weekend, Kip released Room to Spare on his first Record Store Day Vinyl. The special collection of songs, handpicked by Kip, included seven tracks that were released on his ROOM TO SPARE: THE ACOUSTIC EP, marking the first time the songs will be available on vinyl. As well as the stripped-back acoustic tracks, there will be five additional tracks from Moore’s previous studio albums including “Plead The Fifth,” “Last Shot,” “The Bull” and “Guitar Man” taken from his wildly-acclaimed SLOWHEART and “That Was Us” from the highly-praised WILD ONES."
