        "text": "It’s always a special show when Kip Moore brings his tour bus to a stop in the Boston area. Kip’s affinity for the region is long known and well documented even proclaiming in the past that he wants to move to Boston. For Kip, he always feels the fans’ love when he plays in this area of the country whether it be as an opening act for Lady Antebellum or Dierks Bentley or if it’s a headlining gig of his own. On October 20th, Kip brought his Me and My Kind Tour to the Tsongas Center in Lowell, MA for a highly anticipated show with Mr. Jon Pardi.\n\nShortly after 8:30, California native, Jon Pardi, took the stage with his band, his guitar, and his infamous cowboy hat- one of the few in the genre to still wear one. He kicked off his set with ‘Write You A Song’ and ‘Out Of Style’ before telling the crowd, “Happy Thursday! Or as I like to call it, Thirsty Thursday. I don’t know where the hell I am but I love you guys!” Pardi then treated the near-capacity crowd to a stretch of songs from his ‘California Sunrise‘ album, which he released earlier this year. Songs included ‘Night Shift,’ ‘Cowboy Hat,’ ‘Heartache On The Dance Floor,’ ‘Paycheck,’ and his current single, ‘Dirt On My Boots.’\n\nWhile all of the Pardi-animals sang along to every song, the fans who came from Kip Moore couldn’t help but sway to the Pardi’s tunes because of his infectious energy and sound. Jon next played a couple of of his older songs like ‘What I Can’t Put Down’ and ‘Up All Night.’ But there was no way that the party could end without Pardi singing his first Number One song! And a recent one at that- it may have taken a year for ‘Head Over Boots’ to hit the top of the charts after being released but it was still fresh enough to celebrate and thank country radio for supporting the song and helping it go Number One before he played the hit for the crowd. Fans joined in with Pardi throughout the song to sing along and with a wave to the crowd, the California country star retreated backstage for the night.\n\nA quick set change was the only thing keeping the raucous crowd from Kip Moore. With the lights down low and his band on stage, the buzz grew stronger in the arena normally used for college hockey. And as a silhouette was seen walking to the front of the stage from stage left, the screams increased in sound and Kip acknowledged the crowd as the lights came up by holding his red solo cup in the air, toasting his wild ones. Kip’s night began with ‘Lipstick’ and one of our favorites, the anthemic ‘Wild Ones.’ Next was a song that we presume will be on his next album, titled ‘What I Do,’ before he exclaimed, “C’mon, let’s party like it’s the weekend!” And with the show being on a college campus and with many students in attendance, a roar was the response to Kip’s sentiments and from there on, it was definitely a party. Midway through one of the fan favorites, ‘Beer Money,’ Kip told the crowd, “I know it’s Thursday and everybody had to go to work tomorrow. But Boston is my home. Let’s not worry about work and shit tomorrow.”\n\nThe setlist also included ‘Up All Night’ and a cover of Jimmy Eat World’s ‘In The Middle,’ a staple on Kip’s setlist in the past year or so. Next was ‘I’m To Blame’ and ‘Come and Get It,’ to which he changed the lyrics ever so slightly to say, ‘Red Sox red lipstick.’ Next up were ‘Back Seat,’ and ‘Cigarette,’ a song that Kip had previously teased the crowd with when he played at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston. This is a track that Kip co-wrote with none other than The Cadillac Three’s Jaren Johnston and Chris Stapleton. Yes, that Chris Stapleton. Frankie Ballard cut the song and put it on his ‘El Rio‘ album. Moore would go on to play ‘Young Love,’ ‘That’s Alright With Me’ and ‘Running For You,’ before he stood alone on stage for a few stripped down acoustic songs. His acoustic set would include ‘Complicated,’ ‘Heart’s Desire,’ and ‘Crazy One More Time.’\n\nKip’s band would return to the stage for the last few songs of the night. First up was ‘Magic,’ then another fan favorite. Well, a ladies favorite, more or less… the ever so-popular, ‘Hey Pretty Girl,’ which showcases Kip’s raspy and sultry vocals. Midway through the track, Kip transitioned into a few chords of ‘My Girl’ before returning to his song. The energy quickly was brought back up in the arena with his 2012 double-Platinum Number One song, ‘Somethin’ ‘Bout A Truck.’ Moore wrapped up his night with ‘That Was Us,’ before momentarily retreating backstage for a quick wardrobe change. He would return to the stage for his encore of ‘Dirt Road’ in a Boston Celtics Larry Bird jersey! The fans loved seeing Kip in that green jersey and roared with approval.\n\nWe’ve said in time after time and we’ll say it again. If you ever have a chance to see Kip Moore in Boston or the surrounding area- do it! There are some cities which brings out the best in certain artists and for Kip Moore, Boston is one of those cities. Earlier in the night, he told the crowd, “I can’t tell you how much it means to me that you always give me your heart. When you guys keep coming and singing the record back to me, I’m gonna keep doing this shit for the rest of my life!” Well, we’ll keep coming, Kip. So I guess we’ll see you for the rest of your life. Until next time…\n\nWe’ll worry ’bout tomorrow when tomorrow comes. Tonight we’re just worried about having fun. Cause we’re the wild ones…"
