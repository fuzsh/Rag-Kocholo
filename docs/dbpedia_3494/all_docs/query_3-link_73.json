        "text": "Words by Staff Writer\n\nMulti-platinum singer-songwriter Kip Moore returns to our shores.\n\nAmerican country music sensation Kip Moore is set to grace the stages of Australia and New Zealand once again, as he embarks on his Nomad World Tour this September and October. Backed by special guests James Johnston* and Sons Of The East^, Moore’s tour promises a blend of raw energy and heartfelt melodies.\n\nThis marks Moore’s fifth visit to the region, promising his largest headline shows yet, with nine monumental performances scheduled in Christchurch, Auckland, Sydney, Newcastle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra, Thirroul, and Brisbane.\n\nKip Moore Nomad World Tour\n\nChristchurch Town Hall | Christchurch, NZ\n\nPowerstation | Auckland, NZ\n\nICC Sydney Theatre | Sydney, NSW\n\nNewcastle Civic Theatre | Newcastle, NSW\n\nHindley Street Music Hall | Adelaide, SA\n\nRod Laver Arena | Melbourne, VIC\n\nCanberra Theatre Centre | Canberra, ACT\n\nAnita’s Theatre | Thirroul, NSW\n\nBrisbane Entertainment Centre | Brisbane, QLD\n\nKeep up with the latest music news, festivals, interviews and reviews here.\n\nMoore’s last visit to Australia and New Zealand in 2023 saw sold-out shows, including a memorable headline performance at CMC Rocks QLD.

His latest album, “Damn Love,” released in 2023, further solidified his reputation as a powerhouse songwriter, boasting millions of records sold and billions of streams worldwide.\n\nRenowned for his electrifying live performances, Moore achieved a career milestone last year with a sold-out tour in South Africa, paving the way for country music’s global expansion.\n\nJoining Moore on selected dates are acclaimed artists James Johnston and Sons Of The East. Johnston, known for his boot-stomping anthems, will accompany Moore in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. Meanwhile, Sons Of The East, an indie folk trio with a growing global fanbase, will warm up audiences in New Zealand, Sydney, Newcastle, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Canberra.\n\nWith Moore’s distinctive sound and infectious energy, coupled with the talents of his supporting acts, this tour promises to be an unmissable event for country music enthusiasts across Australia and New Zealand."
