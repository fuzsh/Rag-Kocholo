        "text": "I had the pleasure of seeing a very passionate amazing artist at 20 Monroe Live last night. Payed a pretty penny for a great seat. It was so worth it. After a lot of rough weeks at the pharmacy, I was very ready to let loose and get lost in music. Kip and his band fulfilled that need ðŸ˜‰ They really had the house rocking. His voice is so full of passion. He LOVES what he is doing and has worked hard for it. That growllllll he has is perfect! I love many different types of music and his definitely moves me. Thanks guys for making me feel a bit more alive in this crazy world we are in. Was able to remove myself from the medical world for a bit. Was great medicine for meðŸ˜ Thanks guys! I am still feeling that concert high today.\n\nKip Moore has been one of my fave country rockers and I have all of his albums with every song a great one . I finally got to see him live in Seattle at the Paramount and he exceeded my expectations. He chose a great selection of his work and got the crowd singing and dancing along . He did acoustic guitar solos that put it over the top. His voice is gravelly and has such a heartfelt appeal and sincerity to it . He was authentic and humble . A great man and a great artist . I will definitely see him live again and continue to purchase his music\n\nMy boyfriend and I have seen Kip in concert several times. His voice has a tone distinctively his own! We both have noticed the particular way he stands when her performs. Looks like is might loose his balance but so far hasnâ€™t! He is both of our favorite performer!\n\nWow, what a show! Can honestly say that Kip Moore's concert last night at the Riverside was probably the best concert I have ever attended. He played a great selection of songs and seemed to be having as much fun playing as the audience did listening. He had the crowd in the palm of his hand from the get-go. Worth every penny, will see him again whenever he's in the area.\n\nHad a great time at the Kip Moore concert. Not only is he easy on the eyes but he plays with such passion and enthusiasm . His set included all of my fave songs, many of which are lively and got the crowd going really well. His voice is gravelly and so expressive . He is a humble artist who really appreciates his listeners and rewards us sweetly with a fantastic show. As good as he sounds through streamed music he sounds even better in person.. His love for what he does and his natural charmsa shine right through. I had a great time and will go see him perform every time heâ€™s in town"
