        "text": "Kip Moore, the acclaimed singer-songwriter from the US, kicked off the European leg of his Damn Love World Tour with a premiere: his first-ever performance in Germany. And not only once – twice: Hamburg and Cologne. We were there for the tour opener in Hamburg.\n\nHe brought his recently released fifth studio album Damn Love with him. But that’s not all. Jillian Jacqueline, the Nashville-based musician, joined him as support and had something special ahead of him: she had previously performed in Hamburg almost four years ago – just around the corner at the famous Indra Club.\n\nJillian Jacqueline opened the evening greeted by some delighted fans who were glad to see her return. Also Jillian Jacqueline was glad to be back in Hamburg and happy about the warm welcome. With her sentimental voice, her charming personality and her storytelling she captivated the rest of the audience as well.\n\nAmong her songs she performed God Bless This Mess and her current single Hurt Somebody Else from her debut album Honestly, which was released last year. Between the songs, she was giving personal insights and shared some stories.\n\nUnfortunately, my favorite song Iconic was missing that night, but I’m confident that it won’t be the last time I see Jillian Jacqueline perform live over here.\n\nStarting with the song Damn Love, which explores the different facets of love, Kip Moore and his band enthusiastically launched their set in the packed venue.\n\n(Side note: Damn love – as well as some other songs on the album – was written and produced by Jaren Johnston / The Cadillac Three)\n\nThe setlist consisted of 21 songs.\n\nIn advance, Kip Moore apologized for any potential hiccups, as they “had thrown the previously rehearsed plan out the window to try something new—a sort of a live test”. He mentioned he included two songs spontaneously fulfilling fan requests made shortly before the show. “We only had practiced those songs once or twice before tonight” he added.\n\nIn the end it became evident that both sides of the stage excelled in this trial run. The joy was visible and palpable – on and in front of the stage.\n\nThe setlist included catchy melodies like the chorus of Kinda Bar and the groovy Heart on Fire from the current album, as well as classics like Wild Ones and The Bull, which were frenetically celebrated and sung along to by the fans. There was no chance of standing still. And of course, his platinum-certified hit (obviously a fan-favorite) Somethin’ ’Bout a Truck was also not missing that night.\n\nAfter around 80 minutes Kip Moore announced that they had “just started getting warmed up but unfortunately would have to end soon due to a subsequent event in the venue”.\n\nWhat a shame – but he made a promise:\n\n“It was very hard & expensive to come over here, but I promise we will come back!”\n\nThe audience sealed this promise with thunderous applause.\n\n21 songs—sometimes rock, sometimes ballads—a spectacular light and fog show, dance moves, guitar battles, individual band member solos and an incredible amount of fun, the frontman and his fantastic band left the stage after around 90 minutes overjoyed.\n\nThey left a room filled with equally happy and enthusiastic faces behind.\n\nKudos, Kip Moore—that’s delivering a phenomenal performance! You guys rocked! Please come back soon!"
