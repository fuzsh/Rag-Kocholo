Right now, he is in the Western U.S.\n\nBut in October heâ€™ll be performing in Portland.\n\nThe tour is called Damn Love World Tour. And it is a world tour, in that he is leaving the U.S. to perform. He will be in Canada for a couple of weeks on the tour before he returns to Maine.\n\nThat concert will be Saturday, October 14th at the State Theatre in Portland.\n\nDamn Love is also the name of his 5th album, which was released earlier this year.\n\nFor the Portland State Theatre concert pre-sale tickets are on sale now."
