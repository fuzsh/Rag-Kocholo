        "text": "Exquisite.\n\nI know, I know; there are a lot of adjectives available to describe a song—especially a country song. Probably some of those adjectives would be more humble, or folksy, or down-home than the one I came up with. You know—more country.\n\nI woke to the rise of the sun going down\n\nStale taste of whiskey fresh on my mouth\n\nHot cup of coffee, smoke in my hand\n\nAnother day in the life of the guitar man…la da da\n\n*\n\nLast night was a good night, as I reach in my jeans\n\nFound some crumpled-up ones, a few tens in between\n\nAnd a redhead named Annie, she’s still fast asleep\n\nMade me make her a promise she knows I can’t keep…la da da\n\nI’m not at a loss for words here. I’ve got words like a beach has sand. My body is eighty-five percent words. That said, the first and best word that came to mind when I heard Guitar Man by Kip Moore—when he performed it for the first time for the lucky few of us at the VIP in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on the opening night of the Wild Ones Tour—was exquisite.\n\nTime to fire up that two-tone old bucket of rust\n\nThrow my amp and my case in the back of my truck\n\nI breathe in my freedom with the windows rolled down\n\nForty-six miles till the next nameless town…la da da\n\n*\n\nThe place is still empty when I walk in the door\n\nThe stench from the beer spilling up through the floor\n\nI give a nod to sweet Lisa, she mixes the drinks\n\nLife’s been hard on her but she’s been good to me…la da da\n\nOne of the things I love the most about great storytelling is that it engages all my senses and pulls me into the story. I’m there. My emotions kick into high gear. I FEEL something. I want MORE. That’s how you connect!\n\nOff in the shadows stands a stool and a stage\n\nWhere many souls before me were put on display\n\nI take one last breath; time to pay some old dues\n\nThat won’t add up to nothin’ but some tips and cheap booze\n\n*\n\nYeah, the fruits of my labor’s when the crowd sings along\n\nNothing short of a savior; I go home alone\n\nI’m an empty, faceless, spotlight mic stand\n\nI’ll get ya high, I’ll get ya low, I’m a guitar man\n\nBOOM. Well done, Kip, sir.\n\nThey’ll ask for more love songs and I’ll play with a smile\n\nTo help them hold on or forget for a while\n\nThey can fill up that jukebox with a week’s worth of pay\n\nBut it can’t feel their happy and it can’t feel their pain…la da da\n\n*\n\nNo drums, no pianos, no sweet harmonies\n\nIt’s all in a song and it’s all on me\n\nYou won’t find nothin’ fancy, I’m a tired one-man band\n\nI’m a pickin’ and a grinnin’ guitar man\n\nSometimes when I tell people I wrote a novel, I get an expression of awe in response. You know—“Oh, wow, I could never do that! Too hard! So many words!” I’d like to give credit where credit is due here. Writing a novel isn’t easy, but I’ve got a hundred thousand words or so to get it all across to you—the plot, the players, the pictures in your mind’s eye. I get to pluck your heartstrings for three hundred-plus pages. Imagine doing the same thing in less than five hundred perfectly crafted words and setting it to music that squeezes your heart. Now you can see the scope of Kip Moore’s songwriting talent—and my choice of adjectives.\n\nYeah, the fruits of my labor’s when the crowd sings along\n\nNothing short of a savior till I go home alone\n\nI’m an empty, faceless, spotlight mic stand\n\nI’ll get ya high, I’ll get ya low, I’m a guitar man\n\nGuitar Man paints a picture much more intricate than its five hundred words. Like a good novelist, Kip develops his character so well that you KNOW him. You know him well enough to read between the lines and see, hear and feel the details the songwriter didn’t include. Can you feel his aching head along with the the taste of the whiskey when he rolls out of his rumpled bed, his hair standing up in an oily mohawk? Can’t you just see the flakes of rust that fall off his truck door when he has to pull twice to yank it open—and smell the exhaust, hear the squeak of old shocks and the grinding of gears? How about his shoes sticking to the floor of the bar? Or the flickering neon in cloudy windows, the dark corners, the ancient miasma of old smoke and every nick and scratch on the wobbly tables? And finally, the crowning glory—can you feel the communion? Can you feel what it means to him on his lonely road, to connect for a few hours with the people who love him for what his music can do? Do you love the guitar man too?\n\nI had me a pretty baby, thought she was the one\n\nBut she soon grew tired of this love on the run\n\nShe said she felt second, told me I had to choose\n\nShe’s back in Georgia and I’m here with you\n\n*\n\nAt the end of the night we’ll all be best friends\n\nThen strangers till I roll through town again\n\nI’ll yell out, “Hey Lisa, something cold in a can!”\n\nOne for the road for the guitar man\n\nI’m there. I’m right there in that bar—in so many bars and venues I’ve sat in since I discovered guitar and music and songwriting, watching all the guitar men in my life reach out for that savior of connection and love. I’ve reached out for it myself at open mics, facing down strangers and stage fright with my only weapon, an original song—and I remember the first moment when I saw someone singing along. There’s a word for that feeling. I already said it.\n\nYeah, the fruits of my labor’s when the crowd sings along\n\nNothing short of a savior, still I go home alone\n\nI’m an empty, faceless, spotlight mic stand\n\nI’ll get ya high, I’ll get ya low, I’m a guitar man\n\nI’ll play ’em fast, play ’em slow, I’m a guitar man\n\nGuitar Man is a masterpiece, not just of songcraft but of writing craft in any form. It’s pure Kip Moore, channeling the spirits of Dylan and Billy Joel and every weary, hopeful soul hungry for the salvation of music. I’ve listened to it a hundred times already and in it I hear the progression of one singer/songwriter’s passion and maturity to a level that can only touch hearts in a way that every guitar man prays for.\n\nAs I said—EXQUISITE\n\n*****"
