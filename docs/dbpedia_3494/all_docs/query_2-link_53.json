        "text": "Don’t let the name fool you.\n\nAt the Big 98’s Guitar-B-Que set for Wednesday, pulled pork sandwiches may not even be on the menu. Instead, the event will serve up some of the most popular names in country music. The event is headlined by Kip Moore, and other acts on the bill are Dustin Lynch, Brandy Clark, Jon Pardi, Chris Lane and Bobby Bones + the Raging Idiots.\n\n“You’re going to always get passion from us, every single time,” Moore said of his performance. “That’s why I think people keep coming back to see us play. We lay it all on the line every single night. We never go through the motions.”\n\nThe Guitar-B-Que is Moore’s largest headlining local show to date — a feat for the singer, who has spent years striving for the string of hits beside his name and the fan appreciation he has earned along the way. Moore charted his multiweek No. 1 breakthrough hit, “Somethin’ ‘Bout a Truck,” in 2012 and followed it up with consecutive No. 1 songs “Beer Money” and “Hey Pretty Girl.”\n\nMoore’s follow-up album, “Wild Ones,” was less commercially successful but taught the Georgia native there’s more than one way to define victory. While “Wild Ones,” which is home to Moore’s current Top 15 hit, “Running for You,” has sold fewer copies than his debut, the album developed an underground following that continues to pull more and more people into the singer’s shows. And when Moore sings the album cuts, he said, fans know every word “top to bottom.”\n\n“It’s such a true and genuine fan base,” he said. “For me, there for a little while when things weren’t working on radio, I had such a fear of losing what we’ve built. But this ‘Wild Ones’ record has shown me, ‘Just make the music you want to make and people like what you do and fans will continue to come and grow with you as long as you stay true to who you are.’ I realized I could have a career for years just playing music, and that’s all I ever wanted.”\n\nThe discovery landed Moore in a more confident head space that has changed the tone of his new music that will be released in the coming months.\n\n“You’ll get a sense of a different mood on this record and my approach to writing in general,” he said. “I was always a confident writer, but I was second guessing everything I was doing. Now, if I believe something is good, I don’t question it. I do believe this is the best music that I’ve done.”\n\nLike headlining the event at Ascend Amphitheater is a career milestone for Moore, the fact that Guitar-B-Que has grown to the point it can attract marquee artists and fill Nashville’s newest outdoor event space is a noted achievement for the fundraiser that humbly started as a guitar auction. Previously the event, which benefits St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, was held in the parking lot at Losers Bar.\n\n\"It's a major deal for us,\" said Michael Bryan, senior vice president of programming, Nashville iHeartMedia Markets Group. \"I think this is the sixth Guitar-B-Que and it's just grown and grown and grown. It was very clear halfway through the night last year that we had to move along and grow into a bigger venue. It's a much bigger swing for us and it's the potential to raise a lot more money for St. Jude. Kip Moore is a world-class entertainer ... and I think everyone understands that we want to make this a Nashville event.\"\n\nAs for the lineup, Moore describes it as “killer.”\n\n“These are guys who are really good at what they do and I think people will get a lot of variety, from artist to artist, everyone will be doing different things,” he explained.\n\nMeet the artists:\n\nDustin Lynch has spent most of the summer on tour with Luke Bryan, but the “Seein’ Red” singer is amped up for his Wednesday night performance at Ascend Amphitheater.\n\n“Me and my boys are fired up to be a part of such a great party for such a great cause,” Lynch said. “It’s going down at Ascend.”\n\nLynch has three consecutive No. 1 songs to his credit: “Where It’s At,” “Helluva Night” and “Mind Reader.” His current song, “Seein’ Red,” is from his upcoming album.\n\nJon Pardi perked the ears of traditional country music fans with the undeniable twang in his Top 5 hit “Head Over Boots.” Pardi released his new album, “California Sunrise,” in June and has no hesitation to share his personal life on social media — last week he posted a video of himself working on a tractor captioned “work on tractor Wednesday.” It was the same day he shared a video of his sister’s cute new puppy and three days before he posted footage of more than 12,000 country music fans singing “Head Over Boots” back to him at Watershed Festival in Washington. Follow him on Instagram at @jonpardipics.\n\nBrandy Clark is one of country music’s master storytellers and hit songwriters. Clark is the pen behind hits including The Band Perry’s “Better Dig Two” and Miranda Lambert’s “Mama’s Broken Heart.” Clark, who recently released new album “Big Day in a Small Town,” crafts characters with such skill they feel like family — or at least your mama’s hairdresser. Clark is sassy, empathetic and unafraid to be herself. Her songs will be the genre’s endearing legacy.\n\nChris Lane's pop-country \"Fix\" is poised to be the singer's first No. 1 song. Lane, who will release his debut album, \"Girl Problems,\" on Friday, admits he had a sure-fire way to get over a broken heart in high school — boy band music.\n\n\"I was always the nice guy that would do anything for my girlfriends and they knew they had me wrapped around their finger,\" Lane said. \"They would take advantage of that. They basically tortured me because they knew I loved them a lot, and I would be a little sensitive to that. I'm not gonna lie, at one point in my life I remember crying to a Backstreet Boys song because I thought my girlfriend was going to break up with me. We eventually broke up ... and it's her loss now.\"\n\nLane is on tour with Rascal Flatts.\n\nCountry music fans know Bobby Bones from his popular iHeartRadio radio show, \"The Bobby Bones Show.\" Bones made a name for himself with his edgy comments and unique humor as well as his willingness to support new acts. Bones and Producer Eddie from his show formed Bobby Bones + the Raging Idiots for fun and the comedic group took off, inked a record deal with Black River Entertainment in 2015 and released an EP a few months later. Since 2014, Bobby Bones + the Raging Idiots have raised more than $2 million for charity.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Big 98 presents Guitar-B-Que featuring Kip Moore, Dustin Lynch, Brandy Clark, Jon Pardi, Chris Lane and Bobby Bones + the Raging Idiots\n\nWhere: Ascend Amphitheater, 301 First Ave. S. in Nashville\n\nWhen: 5:30 p.m. Wednesday"
