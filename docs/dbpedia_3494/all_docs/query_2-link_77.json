        "text": "Nomad World Tour!\n\nKip Moore has finally returned with a brand new tour 'Nomad World Tour' supported by Hannah Mcfarland! The country crooner is a relative newcomer on the Nashville scene, but his debut 'Up All Night' was named the best-selling album by a male in both 2012 and 2013. Catch him live when he takes on North America once again in 2024.\n\nFollowing a meteoric rise and quick graduation to headline act, the rocker maintains a down-to-earth and easy-going attitude that comes out on stage, especially when performing his crowd-pleasing party anthems, encouraging the audience to let go and have a party themselves. His raw energy and honest emotion make him one to watch in an industry over-saturated with pumping party tunes."
