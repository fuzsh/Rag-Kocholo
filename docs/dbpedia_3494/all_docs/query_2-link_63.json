        "text": "Since Billy Currington's self-titled debut album bowed on Mercury Records in 2003, Currington has scored eleven career No. 1 singles, with hits like, \"Don't Hurt Like It Used To,\" \"Good Directions,\" \"Let Me Down Easy,\" \"Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right,\" \"People Are Crazy,\" \"That's How Country Boys Roll,\" \"Hey Girl,\" and \"We Are Tonight.\" Over the years, the self-effacing Georgia boy has amassed an impressive list of accolades. He won the \"Hottest Video of the Year\" honor at the fan-voted CMT Music Awards for \"Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right\" in 2006. The same year, he received an ACM nod for Top New Male Vocalist. His hit duet with Shania Twain, \"Party for Two,\" earned nominations from both the CMA and ACM. \"People Are Crazy\" took Currington's already hot career to another level. He earned Grammy nominations for Male Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Song in addition to being nominated for Single and Song of the Year from the Country Music Association.\n\nCurrington signed with Mercury in 2003, and immediately garnered attention with his debut single, \"Walk a Little Straighter,\" an autobiographical song about life with his alcoholic stepfather. The song peaked at No. 8, an auspicious debut for a newcomer. He proved the quick success was no fluke when he followed with \"I Got A Feelin',\" which became his first top-five hit. From there, the hits continued as his sophomore album Doin' Somethin' Right spawned his first No. 1 with \"Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right\" and his second No. 1 with \"Good Directions.\" Released in 2008, his third album,\n\nLittle Bit of Everything, featured five songs co-written by Currington. The Bobby Braddock/Troy Jones penned \"People Are Crazy\" became his third No. 1 and he followed that with a song he co-wrote, \"That's How Country Boys Roll,\" which also hit the top of the charts. In September 2010, Currington released Enjoy Yourself, which included No. 1 hits \"Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer\" and \"Let Me Down Easy.\" His fifth album, We Are Tonight, further fueled his momentum spawning two No. 1 singles - \"Hey Girl\" and the title track.\n\nCurrington's sixth studio album, Summer Forever, produced songs, \"Don't It,\" \"It Don't Hurt Like It Used To\" and \"Do I Make You Wanna\", which all reached number one on the Country Airplay chart. Currington's seventh studio album, Intuition, was released on August 6, 2021. Currington co-wrote the album with producer Rob Persaud. It was a surprise release, in that it was not announced with advance warning, and no new singles were released prior to the album to promote it, nor did it include either of his previous standalone singles.] Intuition serves as a musical departure from his previous work as it was not marketed as a country album and instead drew inspiration from \"synth-pop, Eighties R&B, and tropical house\".\n\nMulti-PLATINUM singer/songwriter Kip Moore, a force to be reckoned with globally, has notched breakthrough achievements on his DAMN LOVE WORLD TOUR in 2023 with sold-out headlining stadium shows in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K., Europe, and the U.S., earning himself a CMA International Artist Achievement Award nomination. \"He's carrying the torch for the art of the organic performance\" (Rolling Stone), and his captivating tours have garnered international attention for his rapidly growing cult following and impressive performances that continuously sell out each headlining venue. Moore released his fifth studio album, DAMN LOVE, spring of 2023. \"Each of these songs seems tailor-made for his much-acclaimed live shows,\" (Billboard) with the project being praised as \"the best album of Kip Moore's career\" (Holler). Praised by Noisey as \"an uncompromising, genre-defying artist firing on all cylinders,\" Moore has blazed his trail, with \"a bit more Southern rock than traditional country... to be a Kip Moore fan suddenly became a marker of your having a certain refinement in your country-music taste\" (Chicago Tribune). Moore first splashed into the mainstream with the double-PLATINUM \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck\" in 2012, then followed up with three more best-selling No. Ones (\"Hey Pretty Girl,\" \"Beer Money\" and \"More Girls Like You\").\n\nTennessee-born troubadour Larry Fleet grew up on a stack of records spanning Merle Haggard, Otis Redding, Willie Nelson, and Marvin Gaye. A thoughtful songwriter with a knack for a one-liner, an ear for a sturdy hook, and a powerhouse voice that strikes like a match, Fleet was working blue-collar jobs to make ends meet before a chance encounter with Jake Owen led to an opening slot on the road and a recording contract with Big Loud Records. Six years later, the devout family man is turning heads among fans and critics alike with albums full of soon-to-be classics; 2021's tribute to the music that raised him, Stack of Records, and his aptly titled 2019 debut, Workin' Hard. Saving Country Music puts it simply: \"If you're looking for the future of traditional country music, then look no further than...Larry Fleet.\" A road-tested live show standout, Fleet wrapped 2022 with his first-ever headline One For The Road Tour, following up crowd-winning opening slots in front of Darius Rucker, Willie Nelson, Jamey Johnson, Jon Pardi, and many more."
