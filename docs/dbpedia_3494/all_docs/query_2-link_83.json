        "text": "Oooooh now, Miranda‘s a naughty one! I just got my first listen to the new single from Country artist Miranda Easten, and it’s brought a smile to my dial for the saucy lyrics and quality of the recording.\n\nI know Miranda has worked with my buddy and countryman Greg Haver previously. I’ve not got the low-down on who or where this production was put together, but it’s exceptional. The orchestration and composition is pure Nashville, with a touch of Overdrive on the guitars for that little touch of the Eagles. Really cool.\n\nI listened to it while watching the lyric video. We’ve got the classic layered guitars, with the steel guitar lead over that slightly Overdriven rhythm guitar. The bottom end is chocolatey rich and fat, really filling out the ears. This is exquisitely worked stuff, with the performers having brought it and the studio having done them justice. Miranda is touring this month (May) and next, and with this quality you’re going to be in for some great entertainment.\n\nI’ll not add too much of a spoiler to the content of the lyrics. It’s a great spin on a strong lady standing her ground when faced with some… suggestions… from the good ol’ boy in front of her. Packed with awesomely cheeky euphemisms, not really intended to be too hidden in the level of perception we take from them, the word play is really entertaining and fun. The melody is not what I’d describe as sugary though; rather what I’ve taken from the great Brandon Flowers, in terming it a Rattlesnake of a song. Catchy. Commercially viable to all hell. But the melody has a little bit of an edge. It’s out on Friday 17th May, so you can listen to it then and see where I’m coming from.\n\nNow to Miranda‘s performance. Vocally she has a crystal clear soprano that’s full, not warbly or breathy. Perfectly suited for the genre. It’s not a vocal timbre that would be restricted to Country, however, as Miranda clearly has a set of pipes that can be turned to a whole raft of musical families. Huge kudos to the vocal performance – it’s clear this is what the lady was meant to be.\n\nI hope we’re going to see a full promo video. Not just because the song is great and deserves wide exposure, but also because I think the storyboarding would be entertaining and fun to draft, let alone to watch afterwards. This track is going to go down well on tour, and it shines in audio format. If Country is your love, look up Miranda Easten – and go see her shows. You’ll get a double hit with Miranda and fellow Country singer Steffany Beck, and I guarantee you will be up dancing.\n\nShe’s drives a DeLorean too, guys! The lady’s a goddamn TIME TRAVELLER!"
