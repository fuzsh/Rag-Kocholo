Kip Moore's wild, adventurous side shines bright in a commercial for the new 4-Door Ford Bronco.

In the ad, which is actually a three-minute short film, Moore is seen playing guitar by a campfire, rock climbing, cruising around the backroads in the new Ford Bronco and more. Moore's new song "Red White Blue Jean American Dream" is played in the backdrop while Moore also narrates, making comments and observations about his life on the road.

"The most difficult part about being a musician is you have to be all in," Moore says in the mini-film. "You have to live it and breathe it. It’s dominated so much of my life that I've neglected so many pieces of my life. I’m trying to find that balance."

The short film is presented by Ford and Disney CreativeWorks in collaboration with Jimmy Chin, who is most famous for co-directing the Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo.

"We found a lot of inspiration in the outdoors," Chin said of the project in a recent interview. "Kip's not just a great musician, but he's actually a great climber, a great surfer, finds a lot of inspiration in the outdoors for his music."

The feelings of "neglect" Moore spoke about in the mini-film are echoed throughout his music, specifically in a song called "Payin' Hard" off his latest Wild World album. The song finds Moore singing of personal regrets, specifically about missed opportunities with his father, who he lost to cancer at age 63 in 2011.

"And now it's gone the kinda gone that don't come back / I only see him now in dreams that I have," he sings. "I gotta live with that / Lose sleep with that / When I close my eyes / I'll die with that, yeah / My life's a credit card / Play now, pay later / And I'm paying hard."
