James Buchanan

Buried: Lancaster, Pennsylvania

Died: June 1, 1869

See him: “Posterity will do me justice,” James Buchanan said, not long before he died, and, much, like his presidency, almost everything about that statement is wrong. Almost everything – the tomb of the man almost always ranked by presidential historians as our worst president is elegant and well-maintained. (Don’t mind the marks on the tomb in this photo; it was raining when we visited.) Aside from an odd bit of graffiti we found; a granite marker near the tomb with the word “Buchanan” on it had been tagged with the word “JUICY.”

Buchanan is at Woodward Park Cemetery in Lancaster. Look for the flagpole and the brick service building to find him.
