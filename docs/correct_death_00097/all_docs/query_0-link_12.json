Buchanan developed a deep affection for Wheatland, enjoying “the comforts and tranquility of home” amid the “troubles, perplexities, and difficulties” of public life. The mansion also served as Democratic headquarters during the 1856 presidential campaign and he gave his first campaign address to townspeople gathered on the front lawn."
