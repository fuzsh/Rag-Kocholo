        "text": "For the organization, see Winter Soldiers\n\nFor other uses, see Winter Soldier (disambiguation)\n\nFor alternate versions of Winter Soldier, see Winter Soldier's Character Hub\n\nJames Buchanan \"Bucky\" Barnes is a World War II veteran, former officer of the 107th Infantry Regiment and the best friend of Steve Rogers since childhood. Barnes had enlisted into the Army following the attack on Pearl Harbor and was assigned to the 107th in 1943. His unit was captured by HYDRA, where Barnes was injected with the Super Soldier Serum by Arnim Zola. Barnes was rescued by Rogers, who had become Captain America. Barnes and Rogers then formed the Howling Commandos to battle Red Skull's forces. However, during the attempt to finally capture Zola in the Austrian Alps, Barnes was caught up in the ambush and plummeted hundreds of feet. As no body was recovered, Barnes was presumed deceased and honored as a hero who died in service to his country.\n\nUnbeknownst to his team, Barnes' enhanced abilities allowed him to survive the fall, albeit with the loss of his left arm. Once he was found by the Soviet Armed Forces and HYDRA, Barnes was brainwashed and armed with a new cybernetic arm in order to become their operative, known as Winter Soldier. Over the next fifty years, he killed anyone who posed any kind of threat to HYDRA or the Soviet Union, including John F. Kennedy as well as Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Between missions, Winter Soldier would be put back into a cryogenic stasis to ensure his longevity. In 2014, Winter Soldier was ordered by Alexander Pierce to kill Nick Fury, in order to ensure that all Pierce's schemes with Project Insight could go ahead. However, Winter Soldier was challenged by Steve Rogers, leading to him to begin remembering his prior life.\n\nIn the wake of the Battle at the Triskelion, Barnes, now free, deserted HYDRA in order to remember his past and end his long, violent history. Two years later, Barnes was framed for the bombing of the Vienna International Centre, which claimed the life of T'Chaka. As Black Panther then sought his revenge for his father's death, Barnes was repeatedly saved by Captain America, which sparked the Avengers Civil War as a team of Avengers led by Iron Man was sent to capture him. However, they learned that Helmut Zemo framed Barnes and reactivated his brainwashing so that Zemo could reveal that Barnes had murdered Stark's parents years ago. Having just survived Stark's revenge, Barnes was given amnesty in Wakanda by T'Challa and was placed in cryostasis until all HYDRA's control could be removed.\n\nWith the help of Shuri, Barnes was finally cured of his brainwashing, earning the nickname White Wolf. However, as Thanos attempted to kill Vision for the Mind Stone, Barnes received a new vibranium arm and joined the defense of Wakanda. Winter Soldier defeated many of the Outriders alongside Rocket Raccoon, only for Thanos to defeat them and assemble all of the Infinity Stones. Barnes was killed when Thanos eliminated half of all life in the universe. Five years later, Barnes was resurrected by Hulk and participated in the final battle against Thanos. In the aftermath of the battle, he attended the funeral of Tony Stark with all the other heroes. Later on, Barnes bid Rogers farewell, knowing of his intention to time travel back to the 1940s. Barnes then witnessed Rogers, as a much older man, return home in order to pass the shield onto Sam Wilson.\n\nWith his name pardoned, Barnes sought atonement for all his actions as the Winter Soldier. His attempts were interrupted when John Walker was made the next Captain America, and the Flag Smashers emerged to act against the GRC's efforts to handle the aftermath of the Blip. He and Sam Wilson would go on a mission to stop the Flag Smashers, working with Helmut Zemo and Sharon Carter. However, their mission was complicated by Walker's attacks, until Walker murdered a Flag Smasher over Battlestar's death. Barnes and Wilson were forced to defeat Walker to stop him from continuing to be Captain America. Barnes would then join Wilson and Walker in the final battle with the Flag Smashers, helping in their defeat and making amends with his past. The next year, he was attacked by Nebula, who stole his arm so that she could give it to Rocket Raccoon as a Christmas gift.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nMeeting Steve Rogers[]\n\nJames Barnes was born on March 10, 1917 to George and Winnifred Barnes[2] in New York City[13] and was the eldest child of four. Barnes had grown up to be an overachiever, having been an excellent athlete who had also excelled inside the classroom.[2] Sometime during his childhood, he met Steve Rogers when bullies were trying to steal his money.[5] The two became best friends and stuck together for many years, with Barnes often defending Rogers from the bullies who would have attempted to take advantage of Rogers' short height and small build.[1]\n\nAfter one trip together to Rockaway Beach, Barnes and Rogers ended up being forced to get a ride back towards Brooklyn on the back of a freezer truck as they had used all their remaining train money to buy hot dogs, while Barnes had also inadvertently managed to spend three dollars as he attempted to win a stuffed bear for a girl named Dolores.[4] Another time when they went to Coney Island together, Barnes convinced Rogers to ride the Cyclone, which resulted in Rogers throwing up due to the ride, much to Barnes' great amusement.[1]\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nSarah Rogers' Funeral[]\n\nIn 1936, Steve Rogers' mother died of tuberculosis and was buried her beside her husband. Barnes walked Rogers home after her funeral and offered to let Rogers move into his family house in exchange for Rogers doing chores, but but Rogers refused, saying he could get by on his own. Seeing Rogers struggling to find his house keys, Barnes took out a hidden key and told him that he did not have to because he was with him \"to the end of the line,\" something Rogers would always keep to heart.[2] In 1937, Barnes read The Hobbit as it was first released.[14]\n\nIn December 1941, during their art class, Barnes and Rogers found out that the United States of America had joined World War II, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.[5] That day, they visited the US Recruiting and Induction Center within New York City where Rogers was classified as 4F and rejected from service, while Barnes enlistment was accepted into the United States Army where he earned the rank of Sergeant and underwent sniper training. Barnes, along with the rest of the 107th Infantry Regiment, had been trained during the winter at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin.[5]\n\n1943 Stark Expo[]\n\nThe day before his shipment out into England, Barnes found Steve Rogers getting beaten up by his bully. He came to the defense of his friend and quickly sent the bully running away with a punch to the jaw and a kick to the behind.\n\nBarnes learned that Rogers had been attempting to enlist in the army again so he could fight in World War II, using false documents to try and get deployed. Barnes informed Rogers that he had received his orders and would be going into war the next morning. At first, Rogers seemed upset, as he was not shipping out to war with them. Barnes remained determined to cheer his friend up and reminded him that he would last be the last eligible bachelor left within New York City.\n\nBarnes and Rogers went to the Stark Expo together, as Barnes was determined to enjoy his last day in the city before shipping out. What Barnes did not tell Rogers, however, was that it was, in fact, a double date with Connie and Bonnie, who were both highly excited to spend the evening with a handsome soldier like Sgt Barnes. When Rogers asked what Barnes had told his own date about him, Barnes simply replied, \"only the good stuff\" while greeting both of these girls.\n\nWhile happily exploring the Expo together, the group of four saw the latest inventions, which Stark Industries was showing off. They later watched as Howard Stark himself demonstrated Hovercar, which had greatly impressed Barnes until it malfunctioned and fell to the ground hard, although Stark was able to joke that the car was his prototype. When Barnes turned around to suggest their group go out dancing, he saw that Rogers had walked away from the group to try and enlist in the army yet again, despite Barnes' many previous objections.\n\nBarnes soon found Rogers trying to enlist, and first tried to persuade him to rejoin him on the double date. When that did not work, he had reminded him that he wasn't going to be fighting in a back alley, but in a war. Despite Barnes' protests, Rogers went through with this but said a heartfelt goodbye to Barnes before doing so. Rogers told him not to win the war until he got there, and Barnes left with both of the girls. Barnes and his unit shipped out into England the next day.[1]\n\nPrisoner of War[]\n\nWhile serving on the front lines of World War II, Barnes and his unit, which included Dum Dum Dugan and Gabe Jones, were ambushed by the Wehrmacht troops at Azzano on the Italian Front.[15] Although the battle seemed hopeless as they were strongly outgunned and without any reinforcements, the battle turned when another German unit then appeared and used an extremely powerful tank which proceeded to easily kill the remaining Nazis who fled.\n\nAs Barnes, Dugan, and Jones got out of their hiding place and looked over the remains of the battlefield, the tank then turned its weaponry towards the Americans and they were soon captured by HYDRA. Once they were HYDRA's prisoners, Barnes and the others were sent to work at the weapon facility in Austria where they were forced to help make the new weaponry for HYDRA's forces.[1]\n\nIn October 1943, Barnes met other Allied POWs, including Jacques Dernier and James Montgomery Falsworth. During his imprisonment in the facility, he was viciously beaten by Lohmer, however, other prisoners organized an \"accident\" which resulted in Lohmer's death.[5] Barnes and his friends worked on parts of the Valkyrie. When Barnes became too weak to continue, he was taken to serve as a test subject for Arnim Zola's super soldier experiments[1] and received Zola's recreated version of the Super Soldier Serum.[14]\n\nSaved by Captain America[]\n\nIn November 1943, the facility was infiltrated by Steve Rogers, who had undergone an experiment giving him enhanced strength. Rogers made his way through the base and freed the prisoners, including Barnes, having discovered him while chasing down Arnim Zola. Seeing his friend and his newly transformed body, Barnes was surprised and confused, noting that he remembered Rogers being considerably shorter than he was now while Rogers dragged him out.\n\nAs the freed POWs battled against the HYDRA forces, being led by Dum Dum Dugan, Rogers and Barnes became trapped inside the base as it began to self destruct. During the escape, Barnes and Rogers encountered Johann Schmidt who mocked Rogers' transformation at the hands of Abraham Erskine. After a brief fight, Schmidt and Rogers soon became separated before Schmidt revealed to them his true demonic face, caused by taking an early version of the Super Soldier Serum. Schmidt mocked Rogers' belief that he was still just a simple soldier despite being a higher class of humanity before then escaping from the exploding base.\n\nWith Schmidt gone, Rogers and Barnes refocused their efforts and began working out an escape route. Rogers suggested that they move up and they decided to use a support beam to move to a safe section of the facility. Due to his poor health, Rogers insisted that Barnes get himself to safety first; however, just as he reached the other side, the beam fell apart from under Barnes' feet, trapping Rogers on the other side of the exploding facility.\n\nAlthough Rogers ordered that Barnes escape now before the base exploded and killed them both, Barnes refused, insisting that he would not leave him behind; he claimed that they would be able to find another way across. Barnes watched in amazement as Rogers used his strength to bend a steel bar out of his way before launching himself across the gap and rejoining Barnes. They were then able to escape moments before the entire facility was destroyed.[1]\n\nReturn to Camp[]\n\nBarnes and Steve Rogers eventually regrouped with all the rest of the escaped Prisoners of War and together they then walked all the way back to the American base in Italy, 30 miles away. Once they had all arrived along with the weapons and vehicles they had stolen from HYDRA, they were then greeted warmly by the other soldiers, who were amazed that Rogers' mission to save the missing men had somehow been successful.\n\nWhile Barnes and Dum Dum Dugan were reuniting with their fellow soldiers, Rogers then offered to surrender himself for court-martial; however, Phillips chose not to punish Rogers for undertaking the rescue mission against all of Phillips' strict orders against that plan. As the entire unit gathered together and Rogers was reunited by Peggy Carter, who teased him for being late as Rogers had been unable to contact her to inform her of the success, Barnes then called for the soldiers to cheer for Rogers as their savior. The Prisoners of War were then given some medical attention before all being given some time away from the battlefield to recover.[1]\n\nHowling Commandos[]\n\nAfter their escape from the HYDRA prison, Barnes and all the other former Prisoners of War, including Dum Dum Dugan, were given a break from duty in London. Steve Rogers later joined them inside of the Whip & Fiddle pub and convinced them to join his crusade against the Nazis and HYDRA, forming a group of fighters known as the Howling Commandos.\n\nBarnes told Rogers that he would not follow Captain America, but he would follow his friend. When a dressed up Peggy Carter arrived at the pub to inform Rogers of an upcoming meeting with Chester Phillips and Howard Stark, Barnes had to deal with the realization that Rogers was now the one who was popular with women, not him. Rogers teased Barnes by suggested that Carter might have a friend before discussing if he would be keeping the uniform of Captain America.\n\nHaving agreed to return to the battlefield, Barnes alongside the newly formed Howling Commandos joined Rogers back into the front lines of World War II. Over the following year of the war, Barnes and the rest of the Commandos progressively destroyed most major HYDRA operations and key science facilities, preventing Johann Schmidt and Arnim Zola from completing more projects designed to progress their world-dominating plans.\n\nBarnes followed the team while they focused on destroying HYDRA's army units, tanks and other facilities, ensuring that HYDRA's strength was greatly reduced while the United States Army, as well as the Strategic Scientific Reserve, continued moving forward against them. Barnes would often work like the sniper of the group, protecting his team of Commandos, standing by while Jacques Dernier planted bombs on the HYDRA tanks to successfully destroy them.[1]\n\nFinal Mission[]\n\nAt the beginning of 1945, Barnes, Captain America and the rest of the Howling Commandos prepared for a mission to board the Schnellzug EB912 train carrying Arnim Zola, with the aim of capturing him to learn about the Red Skull's plans. While they looked over the side of the snowy mountain they would have to navigate, Barnes joked that this mission was Rogers' way of getting payback for the time Barnes made Rogers ride a roller coaster that made him throw up, which Rogers neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nWhen Jim Morita intercepted a radio signal from HYDRA confirming that Zola was on the train, Barnes, Rogers and Gabe Jones used a zip wire to board the train as it traveled through the mountains. While Jones stayed on top of the roof of the train, Barnes and Rogers entered and began exploring the various carriages. Moments after their arrival, however, they were suddenly split up and ambushed by a team of armored HYDRA soldiers sent to kill them by Zola.\n\nWhile Rogers was forced to fight the heavily armed HYDRA guard, Barnes became pinned down by three soldiers. Although he was able to kill two, Barnes soon ran out of ammunition and feared he would soon be killed. Rogers, however, was able to open up the door and throw him a new gun which he used to kill the last remaining soldier when Rogers distracted him. Barnes claimed that he had him on the ropes and Rogers assured him that he still believed him.\n\nHowever, just as the pair began to relax, another HYDRA soldier then appeared behind them and fired at them with a Arnimhilation 99L Assault Weapon, blowing a hole through the side of the train and knocking Rogers off his feet. Barnes picked up Captain America's Shield and fired at the soldier, but he was shot again, the power of the blast throwing him off the train and leaving him hanging on to a damaged rail for dear life as the train continued to speed through the mountains.\n\nRogers had dispatched the soldier by launching his shield at him and turned his attention to desperately trying to rescue Barnes as he hung off a rail on the side of the train. Rogers begged Barnes to hold on as he inched closer to him and tried to grab his hand, but before they could reach each other, the rail snapped, which then resulted in Barnes falling down to the icy Danube River below as Rogers could only look in horror as Barnes seemingly fell to his death.[1]\n\nHYDRA's Greatest Soldier[]\n\nCaptured by HYDRA[]\n\nDue to his enhanced physiology granted to him by the Super Soldier Serum, Barnes was just able to survive the fall from the train, though his left arm was ripped from his body upon impact. His nearly lifeless body was discovered by a Soviet soldier, who dragged him back to a Soviet POW camp, where he remained until Arnim Zola was released from the SSR's custody.\n\nNow a captive of the new HYDRA, working within S.H.I.E.L.D., Barnes became the first subject of the Winter Soldier Program. Removing the remnants of his severed arm, the doctors replaced the missing limb with a prosthetic one.[2] In order to erase his memories as Barnes and remold him to their liking, HYDRA frequently used a Memory Suppressing Machine to perform electroconvulsive therapy, which inflicted serious damage to the part of Barnes brain which controlled memory and executive functions. With his limbic system being severely compromised, Barnes lost access to his memories prior to the experiments while becoming hyperaware of his environment and highly susceptible to commands.[16]\n\nWith his body at beyond the peak of physical perfection and his arm at the highest level of weaponized technology, Barnes was put to use as HYDRA's personal weapon for many years. They kept him frozen in suspended animation between missions to prevent him from aging and offset the healing factor of his serum. Whenever Barnes completed a mission, HYDRA had his mind painfully wiped to ensure he remained memory-free and emotionless towards those he killed.[2]\n\nA Mysterious Assassin[]\n\nReceiving vast training from both HYDRA and the Soviet Union in conjunction with being a super soldier, Barnes became a formidable fighter and an even more ruthless killer. His experiences as a Soviet super soldier would eventually earn him the moniker of \"Winter Soldier.\" Winter Soldier would remain frozen for long periods of time until HYDRA saw fit to unfreeze him for missions.[2]\n\nIn 1951, Winter Soldier was unfrozen and deployed to aid the Soviet forces during the Korean War, where he encountered an American super soldier named Isaiah Bradley. Despite his best efforts, Winter Soldier was unable to kill Bradley, with Bradley being able to nearly destroy his metal arm, although they both survived the encounter.[14]\n\nOver the next fifty years, Winter Soldier was responsible for numerous assassinations, killing various sorts of targets from scientific minds to political figures,[2] including John F. Kennedy in 1963.[17] Due to his expertise in the field and shadowy nature, Winter Soldier became a ghost story within intelligence circles, most of whom doubted his existence.[2]\n\nAssassination of the Starks[]\n\nWhile in the Cryostasis Chamber, Winter Soldier was held in the HYDRA Siberian Facility. On December 16, 1991, he was defrosted by Vasily Karpov who, once his memories had been wiped yet again by the Memory Suppressing Machine, ensured Barnes was loyal to HYDRA by using key words to reinforce his conditioning.\n\nWith his mind programmed, Karpov informed Barnes that they needed him to steal a supply of the Super Soldier Serum from the car of Howard Stark, and assassinate Stark and his wife Maria in the process. Winter Soldier traveled to Long Island in New York and waited for Stark to leave his home and travel down the road; at which point he gave chase on his motorbike and struck off one of the tires with his metal arm, causing it to veer off the road and crash into a nearby tree. Momentarily ignoring all the injured victims, Winter Soldier first ensured that he retrieved the Super Soldier Serum before turning his attention onto Stark, who had survived and slowly crawled away from the car wreck in an attempt to escape.\n\nAs the badly wounded Stark crawled away from the car wreck and pleaded to save his wife's life, Winter Soldier ignored his pleas and grabbed a hold of Stark with his metal arm. As Stark looked up at his assassin, he recognized him from their time together during World War II, and addressed him as Sergeant Barnes. However, Winter Soldier appeared not to recognize the name and proceeded to bash Stark's face with his metal arm, cracking Stark's skull and killing him. With his first target now dead, Winter Soldier then carried Stark's corpse and placed him back inside the car before proceeding to strangle Stark's wife to death.\n\nWith both his targets now dead, Barnes destroyed the CCTV camera, thereby making it seem like the Starks had died in a car accident. Returning to the HYDRA Siberian Facility, he delivered the serum to Karpov, who complimented him on his success. The serum was then used to create multiple Winter Soldiers, who were prepared for missions.[4]\n\nTraining Winter Soldiers[]\n\nAs HYDRA decided that more enhanced assassins were needed, members of a HYDRA death squad were injected with the Super Soldier Serum that Winter Soldier had stolen from Howard Stark and used in the Winter Soldier Program. To ensure the other Winter Soldiers were battle-ready, Winter Soldier was tasked with training them; if they were able to overpower and subdue him, then they would be accepted into the program.\n\nDuring one of these training sessions at the HYDRA Siberian Facility, Winter Soldier was defeated. Vasily Karpov congratulated Josef, while a doctor went to check on his vitals. However, Josef was fueled by the adrenaline and attacked the doctor, slamming his face hard into the ground and killing him. As a result, a riot began with the other Winter Soldiers rising up against their masters and attacking Karpov and the other guards.\n\nAs a fight broke out, Winter Soldier was ordered by the terrified Karpov to protect him. He took him away from the danger, locking the Soldiers in the cage. While the HYDRA guards eventually subdued the other soldiers and put them back into Cryostasis Chambers, it was then decided by Karpov that they should all be kept on ice until they could be controlled. As Karpov fled to the United States of America, the facility was abandoned after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.[4]\n\nMassacre at the Hotel Inessa[]\n\nStill under the control of HYDRA, Winter Soldier traveled to eliminate another target at the Hotel Inessa, who was guarded by a personal selection of his bodyguards. Winter Soldier began his attack on the guards by punching his metal arm through a wall, grabbing a guard and quickly disabling him, before throwing a blade at the next guard, and shooting the next two before they could realize what was happening. With his target fleeing, Winter Soldier leapt off the balcony to get ahead of him.\n\nThe fight was a quick one as the target attempted to run, although his personal protection unit was quickly killed by Winter Soldier, with his target's two closest guards being shot and impaled with Winter Soldier's knives within a matter of seconds. With his target defenseless, Winter Soldier grabbed his neck, uttering \"Hail HYDRA\" as he used his Prosthetic Arm to crush his throat, before dropping his corpse to the floor.\n\nHowever, once his target had been executed, Winter Soldier then noticed RJ Nakajima, who had been attempting to enter his hotel room and inadvertently witnessed the massacre, and was too afraid to be able to get his door unlocked and escape. As Winter Soldier approached Nakajima, he was told that Nakajima had seen nothing, although still the ruthless super soldier shot Nakajima in the head before escaping.[20]\n\nEncounter with Black Widow[]\n\nIn 2009, Winter Soldier was sent to kill a nuclear scientist who was being escorted by Black Widow. Without hesitation, he attacked his target, sending the car containing the scientist and Black Widow over a cliff. Finding that Black Widow had saved the target from falling to his death, Winter Soldier fired a single round through her stomach and the bullet struck the scientist, effectively killing him. As his mission was accomplished, Winter Soldier made his getaway without pursuit.[2]\n\nHYDRA Uprising[]\n\nAttack on Nick Fury[]\n\nIn 2014, Winter Soldier was activated by Alexander Pierce once more to go assassinate Director Nick Fury after he had just begun to unravel HYDRA's secret existence due to questioning Project Insight. When Fury managed to escape death at the hands of over a dozen HYDRA agents in Washington, D.C., Winter Soldier managed to get ahead of Fury's SUV and disable it using a Disc Grenade, which caused the car to flip over as Winter Soldier then easily stepped aside from the flaming wreckage.\n\nHowever, as Winter Soldier had made his way to the vehicle to finish Fury off, he found his target had used a Mouse Hole to escape from the wreckage and into the sewers to flee from his would-be assassins. Unwilling to allow his target to get away alive, the Winter Soldier later located Fury at Steve Rogers' apartment, where he was attempting to give Rogers some more vital information about his attack and the possible infiltration in S.H.I.E.L.D.. However, before Fury could reveal anything else, the Winter Soldier shot him through the back multiple times, which punctured straight through his Bulletproof Vest, through the apartment wall from another building way across that street.\n\nWith Fury seemingly dead, the Winter Soldier made his escape, but Rogers gave chase and attempted to subdue the Winter Soldier by throwing his shield at him. However, Winter Soldier stopped running as he simply caught the shield with his bionic arm, throwing it back with incredible force after looking at Rogers for a moment. As Rogers stood frozen in shock at the assassin's strength and reflexes, Winter Soldier then escaped before Rogers could see where he went.[2]\n\nAlexander Pierce's Orders[]\n\nInstead of being returned to his Cryostasis Chamber, Winter Soldier was sent to Alexander Pierce's house for his next orders in the wake of Nick Fury's apparent demise, with Winter Soldier sitting in the darkness until Pierce returned. Upon seeing him, Pierce jokingly offered Winter Soldier some milk, although Winter Soldier remained silent as Pierce explained that their timeline had been shifted.\n\nHe was then informed that his next targets were Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff, who had uncovered and caused the destruction of Arnim Zola, and were now attempting to reveal HYDRA's Project Insight scheme which involved killing twenty million targets across United States using the Helicarriers. As they were then discovered by Renata, Winter Soldier watched as Pierce shot and killed her to maintain their secrets.[2]\n\nBattle of Washington, D.C.[]\n\nThe next day, the Winter Soldier had managed to track down all of his targets and attacked on the freeway while they were kidnapping Jasper Sitwell. Managing to land on the roof of the car, Barnes threw Sitwell from the car into the path of an oncoming truck and fired inside the car to try and assassinate his targets. Before he could get a confirmed kill, however, the Winter Soldier was then thrown off the car's roof as Sam Wilson slammed on the brakes.\n\nHaving stopped himself using his prosthetic arm, the Winter Soldier managed to get out of the way as the car charged towards him and proceeded to rip out the steering wheel, which caused the car to lose control and crash, with Steve Rogers just able to get all his allies to safety. Seeing they had survived, Barnes proceeded to fire a grenade at his targets. Rogers took the blow on his shield and went flying off the bridge, crashing into a bus down below.\n\nWinter Soldier then turned his attention to Natasha Romanoff, as he and his HYDRA team fired upon her until an explosion caused by Barnes' grenade launched caused her to fall from the bridge as well, barely saving herself with a Grappling Hook Gun. With his targets off the bridge and at a disadvantage, Winter Soldier took his machine gun and aimed off the bridge to finish them off. However, he was shot in the eye by Black Widow, only surviving due to his protective mask.\n\nEnraged at being shot at, Winter Soldier fired down at Romanoff, barely missing all his shots as she ran for her life down the street. Instead of sharpshooting Romanoff, Winter Soldier ordered his men to deal with Rogers while he personally targeted her. Leaping from the bridge, Winter Soldier landed on a car and pursued the S.H.I.E.L.D. spy through the streets of Washington, D.C. while the civilians ran for cover and Winter Soldier's agents fired upon both Rogers and Wilson.\n\nAs he reloaded his grenade launcher, Winter Soldier eventually believed that he had Romanoff cornered when he heard her voice from behind a parked car. In an attempt to kill his target, he silently dropped a Ball Grenade and let it quietly roll towards the source of the sound. However, Winter Soldier soon discovered it was a trick as Romanoff had left her phone playing her voice to distract him so she could sneak up behind him for a sudden ambush.\n\nOnce Winter Soldier was distracted, Romanoff jumped onto his shoulder and then attempted to strangle him by using her garrote. Engaging her in a fierce fight, the Winter Soldier had eventually managed to throw Romanoff off him by slamming her onto a nearby car before having his prosthetic arm temporarily disabled by one of her taser discs, which had allowed Romanoff to run into the crowd while Winter Soldier reactivated his arm.\n\nWith his arm working once more, Winter Soldier went in pursuit of Romanoff, who was desperately attempting to get the innocent people out of harm's way while running for her own life. Catching sight of his target, Barnes took aim and fired a single shot while hit Romanoff directly in the shoulder, causing her to fall down. Once he had Romanoff cornered on the street, the Winter Soldier charged forward, leaping onto a car as he prepared to finish her off.\n\nJust before Winter Soldier could kill Black Widow, he was then confronted by Captain America, who ran to his allies' aid. Seeing Captain America coming, Winter Soldier spun around and attempted to hit him with his prosthetic arm, only for Captain America to block the blow with his shield. As Winter Soldier kicked him down to the ground, the two engaged in a brutal one-on-one fight, both rivaling each other with every move.\n\nDetermined to kill his target, Winter Soldier fired every round in his machine gun at Rogers, only for them to be blocked by the shield, spurring Winter Soldier to use his other weapons, all of which were low on ammunition, which he was eventually force to toss aside and continue with their fight. Having lost all of his guns during their clash, Winter Soldier managed to briefly get a hold of Captain America's shield before knocking him back with a hard punch to the chest. As Rogers charged towards him, Winter Soldier launched the shield at Rogers with considerable force, but it missed him and it embedded itself in a nearby van.\n\nAs Winter Soldier and Rogers' furious battle continued throughout the streets of Washington, D.C., Winter Soldier then resorted to using his knife, attempting to plunge it into Rogers' throat as he wildly slashed at his foe. However, as both proved themselves to be equally skilled in combat, since Winter Soldier was still unable to land the deadly blow and had soon been disarmed. Rogers managed to launch Winter Soldier across the street and into a nearby car before landing another hard strike against him.\n\nThe pair were forced to resort to hand-to-hand combat again as Winter Soldier had struck back against Rogers, managing to avoid being slammed to the ground. He used his bionic arm to begin strangling Rogers before then launching him across a car. Once Rogers was briefly defenseless on the floor, Winter Soldier attempted to finish the job by striking a hard punch with his metal arm, but he missed and instead smashed the concrete as Rogers moved out of the way.\n\nEnraged he still had not killed his target as he had been instructed to do by Alexander Pierce, the Winter Soldier began attacking Captain America with his prosthetic arm, knocking him back into a nearby van before pulling out his second knife. Using his bionic arm to give him even more strength, Winter Soldier plunged the knife into the van and tore through the metal, while Captain America still avoided the blade and then threw Winter Soldier off him.\n\nRogers was able to reclaim his shield as he blocked all of Winter Soldier's continued strikes with his knife before he was able to dodge one blow and embedded his shield in Winter Soldier's arm, causing serious damage. In the midst of the fight, Rogers ripped the Winter Soldier's mask off his face and stared in disbelief as Barnes turned and revealed his true face. Having recognized him as James \"Bucky\" Barnes, Rogers brought Winter Soldier to a standstill.\n\nWhile Winter Soldier briefly questioned who Barnes was, he soon remembered his mission and swiftly raised his gun to take a shot and kill Rogers in order to complete his mission for HYDRA. However, just before he could fire the shot at Captain America, the Winter Soldier was then suddenly knocked down onto the ground by Falcon, who swooped past in his EXO-7 Falcon before then being shot at by Natasha Romanoff with the grenade launcher he had dropped while fighting Rogers. While Winter Soldier dodged the fireball, he was still forced to escape from the streets while Brock Rumlow and the team of STRIKE agents charged in and captured the fugitives.[2]\n\nForgotten Memories[]\n\nRegrouping with HYDRA, Winter Soldier was then taken straight back to the Ideal Federal Savings Bank, where he became erratic and violent towards the doctors. As they were repairing his robotic arm, Barnes started to remember fragments from his past. These memories included his fall from the train back during World War II, as well as all the operations performed on him by Arnim Zola which threw him into a rage as he attacked one of his doctors.\n\nWhile Winter Soldier had continued to struggle to control his ever-growing rage, Alexander Pierce arrived at the base to obtain Barnes' mission report. Despite Jack Rollins warning that Winter Soldier was unpredictable, Pierce spoke to him, only to find Winter Soldier was unresponsive and refusing to respond until Pierce struck him across the face. Barnes claimed that he knew Captain America somehow, which unnerved Pierce who secretly knew the truth about them.\n\nPierce claimed that Winter Soldier only remembered Rogers because he had met him a few days ago on the assignment to kill Nick Fury, but Barnes continued insisting that he knew him. As Brock Rumlow watched closely, Pierce noted how Barnes' work with HYDRA had been a gift to mankind and he needed to do it one more time during Project Insight. Seeing he was still struggling, Pierce then ordered Barnes to undergo some further mind alterations to force Barnes' cooperation.[2]\n\nBattle at the Triskelion[]\n\nJust before HYDRA could complete their goal to rid the world of all potential threats to their reign with Project Insight, as they prepared to activated all of the Helicarriers, their plans were then suddenly intercepted when Captain America and his allies had infiltrated the Triskelion and revealed HYDRA's presence to his fellow agents who had actively engaged in battle with all of HYDRA's undercover agents. In order to stop this from continuing, Alexander Pierce activated the Winter Soldier who arrived and attacked the agents.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Winter Soldier charged into the battle firing grenades at the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in order to keep them from aiding Captain America. Using his superior strength and skills, Winter Soldier easily overpowered the agents, kicking one agent inside the engine of one of the Quinjets while destroying others with grenades. Once Winter Soldier had cleared through the main teams of the agents, he flew a Quinjet towards one of the Helicarriers.\n\nHaving now made it on board the Helicarrier, Winter Soldier then ambushed Captain America and Falcon, as he shoved Captain America off the Helicarrier in an attempt to make him fall all the way to his death upon landing on Washington, D.C. below. Winter Soldier then proceeded to rip Falcon out of the air before he destroyed the EXO-7 Falcon by ripping off one of the wings and kicked him off the Helicarrier to hopefully fall all the way to his death as well.\n\nSeeing that Captain America did not die from the sudden fall and had managed to stay on board of the Helicarrier, Winter Soldier ran ahead to meet him at the Target System for a final showdown. While the battle continued in the Triskelion, with Pierce currently being held hostage by Nick Fury and Black Widow, while Falcon was forced to battle against Brock Rumlow, Winter Soldier had gone to confront Captain America.\n\nKnowing that Captain America had intended to reboot the Helicarrier's Target System to stop Project Insight, Winter Soldier prepared to do whatever so required to prevent this. As the two had stood opposite each other, Captain America had then pleaded with his former friend for him to remember him and think of all innocent people who were going to die. With Winter Soldier not moving, Captain America asked him not to make him fight him.\n\nDespite everything Captain America said, the Winter Soldier had still remained silent and ignored all these pleas. Seeing no other choice, Rogers engaged Barnes in combat, launching his shield at his enemy which the Winter Soldier blocked with his prosthetic arm before he began shooting at Captain America. Having wounded him, the pair fought in a lengthy violent hand-to-hand battle with Winter Soldier attempting to use his knife to kill Captain America.\n\nWinter Soldier then attempted to get possession of the targeting chip which would allow Maria Hill to take control and stop Project Insight. As the chip became loose, Winter Soldier attempted to stop Captain America from taking it by throwing his shield at him before shooting at him, which Captain America blocked using the shield Winter Soldier had thrown at him. Once he had deflected the thrown shield away from him, Winter Soldier then ran forward with his knife.\n\nEngaging Captain America back in close-quarters combat again, Winter Soldier then managed to plunge his knife into Captain America's shoulder before he grabbed the chip and attempted to destroy it. Desperately trying to obtain the chip back, however, Captain America pulled the knife out of his shoulder and fought against Winter Soldier, forcefully breaking his arm and injuring his leg as he subdued him, before retaking the targeting chip out of his hands.\n\nWinter Soldier, however, managed to regain consciousness just before Captain America could reach the System Override, shooting him multiple times. Despite this, Captain America still managed to swap the Data Chips and had Hill reset the three Helicarriers open fire at each other, with himself still aboard. While Winter Soldier could do nothing, Russo and the operatives inadvertently destroyed Project Insight by shooting the Helicarriers out of the sky.[2]\n\nRegaining Memories[]\n\nAs the Helicarrier began to fall apart in mid-air due to the other ships firing upon it, Winter Soldier suddenly became trapped under all of the falling debris. Upon seeing this, Captain America quickly leaped to his friend's aid and freed him by lifting the debris off him. Taking a moment to catch his breath, Winter Soldier listened as Captain America insisted that he knew him, however, Winter Soldier then instantly betrayed Captain America and attacked once again.\n\nBegging Barnes to remember them, Rogers then reminded him of his name and past, noting that he had known him for his entire life before he had been captured by HYDRA and had been turned into their own assassin. Refusing to fight him, Rogers then removed his helmet and allowed his shield to drop out of the Helicarrier. However, despite this Barnes still refused to listen to what he was saying, violently beating Rogers with his bionic arm as their surroundings deteriorated.\n\nAs Winter Soldier ignored Rogers' words and insisted he was his only mission, he continued brutally beating Rogers into submission before Rogers then quoted something Barnes said to him more than seventy years ago after his mother's funeral. As Barnes finally began to remember, he relented, unwilling to throw another punch. However, before Winter Soldier could do anything more, the surface beneath them fell away, and Rogers plummeted down into the river below.\n\nBarnes then quickly grabbed on to a metal beam, which allowed him to stay on the Helicarrier. Realizing that Rogers truly was his friend, Barnes let go of the beam and dove into the water after Rogers and then pulled him ashore, saving his old friend's life. After saving him, Barnes quickly checked to see if Rogers was still breathing. After he discovered he was, he then slowly walked away towards the nearby woods, going onto his mission to discover his true identity.[2]\n\nHaving escaped the Triskelion wreckage, Barnes returned into Ideal Federal Savings Bank, where he encountered the HYDRA scientists. Freed from their mind control, Barnes assaulted them; however, this reminded Barnes of all the people he murdered, preventing him from killing them.[21] Barnes later went to the Smithsonian Institution as he found a memorial for a late Howling Commando James Barnes, who had seemingly being killed in his combat during World War II.[2]\n\nEnd of the Line[]\n\nFound by Captain America[]\n\nFree from HYDRA, Barnes was on the run from the government. He traveled to an old safe-house in Romania to investigate his past; the more he learned of his past life in the Howling Commandos, the more he added into a notebook of all his memories.[21] While walking through Bucharest and buying plums from a street seller, Barnes caught sight of a nervous man staring at him.\n\nFearing that his identity might be at risk of being discovered, Barnes walked over to the man who ran as fast as he could away from him. Taking the Jurnalul de Lugoj newspaper the man was selling, Barnes had then discovered that he was being accused of the Bombing of the Vienna International Centre within Austria, which had claimed the lives of several people, including King T'Chaka of Wakanda. Seeing this, Barnes decided to collect his belongings and then escape.\n\nReturning into his hideout, Barnes discovered Captain America was already there. When Rogers then asked if Barnes knew who he was, Barnes claimed that he had learned of him inside a museum although Rogers knew he was lying. Barnes had still insisted that he was not responsible for all of the terrorist attacks as that was not who he was anymore, but Rogers noted that the people who did blame him were currently coming to their location now intending to finally kill him.\n\nThe reunion would eventually be interrupted by all the arrival of GSG 9 agents, who charged into the building from the rooftop and the hallway. While they were working together, Barnes and Rogers deflected their grenade thrown inside by covering it with Captain America's Shield. Barnes took his backpack and threw it out of the window where it had landed on the next building's roofs, reassuring Rogers that he did not actually plan on killing anybody.\n\nAs more agents charged inside the room, Barnes used his prosthetic arm to block the gunshots before using any weapons were nearby to subdue all his attackers, including a concrete block. Moving into the stairway were that large unit of GSG 9 agents were moving to him, Barnes then continued to fight back against his would-be killers, while Rogers followed behind, ensuring nobody was accidentally killed due to Barnes' less than a careful fighting style.\n\nLeaving Rogers behind, Barnes jumped down several stories, using his prosthetic arm to catch himself before running to a balcony and leaping onto the next building's rooftop, regaining his backpack and continuing to run. However, just as he began running away, he was attacked by Black Panther, who had lost his father in the bombing. Without a word being spoken, Barnes and Black Panther had begun fighting as he used his Panther Habit to attempt to kill Barnes.\n\nAs Black Panther tried to use his claws to cut Barnes' throat, he became distracted as a GSG 9 helicopter began shooting at the pair, only for Panther's vibranium armor to protect him from the bullets. Barnes began to run again, with Black Panther and Rogers running close behind him as they leaped down from the building and onto the street, while Falcon managed to knock the helicopter out of the way of danger to protect them from the guns.\n\nBarnes used his momentary lead to run ahead of Black Panther and jumped down into a busy underground road, fleeing through all the traffic while Black Panther and Captain America were following close behind him. Realizing that Black Panther would be able to catch up to him eventually, Barnes was able to get a hold of a man's motorbike and used the extra speed to get ahead for their chase, while Rogers and the Panther used a stolen car to try and catch up with him.\n\nDespite his head start, Black Panther managed to catch up with Barnes and attempted to kill him, however, Barnes was just able to use his bionic arm to block Black Panther's attack, grabbing him by the throat and knocking him into the road. While also grinding his hand across the tarmac to keep from falling off his bike and had still continued to ride away from danger while the still determined GSG 9 agents followed behind in their cars.\n\nComing to the end of the tunnel, Barnes used Ball Grenades to blow up the roof, hoping to trap his attackers and escape. However, Black Panther was able to gain extra speed by jumping onto Falcon's back and knocked Barnes off his bike before Rogers kept him from killing his friend. The manhunt was finished as War Machine cornered them and they were all arrested by GSG 9, with Black Panther revealing himself to be Wakandan King T'Challa.[4]\n\nCaptured by Everett Ross[]\n\nWith Barnes now in custody, he was locked in a containment cell with his cybernetic arm tightly fixed down and taken to the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre Building in Berlin. From within his cell, Barnes watched as Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson and T'Challa were greeted by Sharon Carter and the leader of the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre, Everett Ross, before Barnes was taken away to await his questioning.\n\nBarnes was later greeted by a man who was supposed to to be the psychiatrist Theo Broussard, who had been appointed by the UN to conduct a pyschological evaluation. Broussard had, in fact, been met at a train station then taken to a hotel and murdered by Helmut Zemo who was impersonating him. \"Broussard\" claimed to only want to ask Barnes some simple questions in order to help him, but Barnes remained silent, only answering to say that he would prefer to be called Bucky rather than James while \"Broussard\" asked him about the horrors he had seen during his time with HYDRA.\n\n\"Broussard\" set off a blackout that cut the security cameras, and began reciting the trigger words that would reactivate Barnes' Winter Soldier Program training by using the Winter Soldier Book originally owned by Vasily Karpov. Not wanting to be forced to kill again, Barnes gathered all of his strength and attempted to break free of his restraints and stop \"Broussard,\" ripping his arms free and punching the glass in an attempt to escape.\n\nHowever, \"Broussard\" was able to finish saying the code words just as Barnes broke free and went into his compliant assassin mode, blind to all his loyalty to his friends. \"Broussard\"'s first question was about his mission in 1991 where he had assassinated Howard Stark and his wife, Maria Stark, in order to steal the Super Soldier Serum. \"Broussard\" demanded to know the location of the HYDRA Siberian Facility so he could unleash the other Winter Soldiers.[4]\n\nEscape from the JCTC[]\n\nWinter Soldier was then ordered by \"Broussard\" to fight and kill anyone who attempted to stop him, before escaping in a helicopter to seemingly prove his guilt for the recent terrorist attacks. Winter Soldier was soon found by Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson, who were trying to question \"Broussard,\" so Winter Soldier quickly fought and subdued the pair before heading back upstairs.\n\nFinding himself surrounded by Joint Counter Terrorist Centre agents, Winter Soldier fought his way through until he was attacked by Tony Stark, who attempted to use an Iron Man Gauntlet to subdue Winter Soldier. Despite being hit with several shockwaves, Winter Soldier was able to withstand them and attacked Stark, attempting to shoot him in the head. However, Stark fought back and disarmed Winter Soldier before being subdued himself with a punch to the chest.\n\nBefore Winter Soldier could kill Stark, however, Sharon Carter and Natasha Romanoff came to his aid and began fighting Winter Soldier together, using their combined skill to try and subdue the assassin. However, the Winter Soldier's remarkable strength allowed him to defeat the pair, smashing Carter against a table before attempting to use his prosthetic arm to strangle Romanoff to death, despite her attempts to reason with him.\n\nWinter Soldier was again stopped from killing one of his own allies when T'Challa charged in and began fighting his enemy, proving that even without his Panther Habit he remained a fierce opponent to Winter Soldier. The pair proved to be eventually matched as they each managed to briefly subdue the other until T'Challa was able to kick the Winter Soldier down a stairway where he managed to escape towards the rooftop.\n\nHaving gotten to the helipad, Winter Soldier ripped the cables away and prepared to make his escape from the building; however, not before Rogers found his friend and refused to allow him to leave. Using all his might, Rogers grabbed ahold of the helicopter and pulled it back down towards the helipad, with Winter Soldier watching as Rogers managed to pull it towards the ground despite Winter Soldier's attempts to fly away.\n\nSeeing that Rogers would not allow him to leave, Winter Soldier instead crashed the helicopter towards him, hoping to decapitate him with the blades. When Rogers survived, Winter Soldier grabbed him by the throat as they fell into the river below. During the crash, Barnes hit his head and was knocked unconscious. Rogers then rescued his friend from drowning and took him to a warehouse as police helicopters continued their search.[4]\n\nHelmut Zemo's Plan[]\n\nLater, Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson, not knowing if Barnes was still activated as the Winter Soldier or not, trapped his metal arm in a vice leaving him defenseless and unable to continue fighting or running. When Barnes woke up, he recognized Rogers, prompting him to ask Barnes whether it was him or Winter Soldier speaking. Barnes replied that Rogers' mother's name was Sarah and that he had worn newspapers in his shoes, personal facts that only Barnes knew that were not in a museum.\n\nRogers and Wilson discussed the situation, deciding they would not call Tony Stark and Wilson saying he knew a guy who could assist them in Stark's place. Barnes also revealed he was not the only Winter Soldier, and Helmut Zemo, the man posing as Theo Broussard, was seeking the program's training facility in Siberia to presumably free the other Winter Soldiers from cryostasis, and then unleash them upon the world to cause chaos.[4]\n\nBuilding the Team[]\n\nStealing a car, the three went to meet with Sharon Carter, who had recovered Captain America's Shield and the EXO-7 Falcon. While Steve Rogers spoke with Carter, Barnes asked Sam Wilson if he could move his seat forward in the car to give him more room, but Wilson refused, as he still disliked Barnes due to their many fights. When Rogers and Carter shared a brief but passionate kiss before she departed, both Barnes and Wilson smiled at their friend with pride, much to Rogers' embarrassment.\n\nHaving regained their equipment, the group met with Clint Barton, who had successfully rescued Wanda Maximoff from the Avengers Compound and had also recruited Scott Lang into their cause. While Lang expressed his delight in being invited to join the fight, Barnes listened as he overheard an announcement saying that the nearby airport was being evacuated due to Iron Man's arrival and translated this for everybody else to understand.[4]\n\nClash of the Avengers[]\n\nWith time running out to find Helmut Zemo before he could reactivate the Winter Soldiers, Barnes and the rest of the assembled members of Captain America's team arrived at the airport to locate him. Barnes and Falcon took position inside the building while Rogers was confronted by Iron Man and the people supporting his views of the Sokovia Accords, advising Rogers to hand himself and Barnes over to Thaddeus Ross for questioning before the situation got even worse.\n\nWhen Rogers made his move, Barnes and the Falcon ran to their position, only to find themselves being followed and confronted by Spider-Man. When Spider-Man attacked and kicked Falcon away, Barnes tried to hit him, but the hero caught his prosthetic arm and commented on how cool it was, leaving Barnes bewildered. A fight then broke out with Falcon and Spider-Man chasing each other while Barnes threw items at Spider-Man, only for them to be thrown back at him.\n\nAs the fight continued throughout the airport, Barnes found the Falcon had been almost subdued by Spider-Man, who had used his Web-Shooters to pin him to a wall. When Barnes attempted to assist his ally, they were both knocked off a platform and pinned to the floor with Spider-Man's webbing. When Spider-Man tried to mock them, Falcon used Redwing to throw him out of the building, at which point Barnes mocked him for not doing that sooner, only for Falcon to reply that he hates him.\n\nRejoining the rest of his teammates, Barnes attempted to run for the Quinjet to escape, only to find that their path was blocked by Vision, who used the power of the Mind Stone to stop them and insisted that they surrender now before it was too late. As Barnes and Rogers' team faced off against Iron Man's team, it became clear that their views of the Sokovia Accords would not change. Seeing no other alternative, Rogers ordered his team to fight, and together, they ran forward against their opponents.\n\nBarnes quickly found himself engaged in a one on one fight with a blood-lusted Black Panther. As the battle raged on, Barnes managed to wrap his prosthetic arm around the throat of the Panther Habit, while locked together, Barnes tried to insist that he was not responsible for the death of T'Chaka, but Black Panther only questioned why he had run when confronted about it.\n\nNot accepting his plea of innocence, Black Panther managed to gain the upper hand and kicked Barnes across the runway. Once Barnes was on the ground and recovering from the blow, the Panther then attempted to cut his throat with his claws. However, Scarlet Witch intervened and used her powers to stop Black Panther's hand inches before he cuts Barnes, stopping him before he could kill his enemy; she then launched him across the runway.\n\nHaving regrouped with Captain America, Barnes listened in as the group, including Hawkeye agreed that the only way to win this war as if a lot of them lost the battle of Iron Man's team while Rogers and Barnes escaped. Knowing that it would be almost impossible to reach the Quinjet without being stopped, Ant-Man volunteered to make a distraction, turning himself into his giant form and attacking War Machine while Barnes and Rogers ran to the Quinjet.\n\nWhile Giant-Man caused chaos, both Barnes and Rogers ran to the Quinjet, almost being stopped when Vision tried to destroy a tower to block their path, although Maximoff ensured it stayed up long enough for them to make it under. They were then confronted by Black Widow who considered stopping them, but knowing Rogers would not stop, decided to use her own taser discs to keep Black Panther at bay while they escaped on the Quinjet.\n\nWhile traveling on the Quinjet having escaped from Iron Man's team, Barnes asked Rogers what would likely happen to the members of the Avengers who were supporting his cause. Although Rogers claimed he did not know, he, in fact, knew that Thaddeus Ross would send them to the Raft. Although Barnes questioned if his life was worth all this suffering, Rogers insisted that everything he had done while a HYDRA assassin was not his own fault.[4]\n\nBattle at the HYDRA Siberian Facility[]\n\nUpon arriving in Siberia at the Facility there, Barnes armed himself before he and Captain America then discussed their time growing up together in the 1940s, with Rogers teasing Barnes over a time when he had tried to impress Dolores by spending their bus money to win her the stuffed bear. When Barnes noted how Dolores would be over a hundred years old, Rogers then noted that they were too.\n\nWhile they both had explored the facility, they were soon alerted to a noise in the elevator and had discovered Iron Man had arrived. While Barnes aimed his gun at Stark, fearing that he was still his true enemy, he revealed that he had discovered recently Barnes' own innocence regarding T'Chaka's death and followed them to Siberia to form a truce to capture Helmut Zemo, with Stark convincing Barnes to lower his weapon eventually as he established his peace.\n\nHaving established their peace, for the time being, the group had then explored the facility while searching for their target, they had soon discovered that all of the Winter Soldiers had been shot in their Cryostasis Chambers while they were still asleep, seemingly destroying their theory that they were planned to be unleashed upon the world. They all then discovered Zemo had always been watching them, noting that Zemo had never actually intended to have more Winter Soldiers in the world. While his allies confronted Zemo over why he had killed innocent people to bring them there, Barnes kept his gun raised at Zemo, ready to fire upon him if needed.\n\nWhile Rogers personally confronted him, Zemo revealed that he had in fact been from Sokovia and had lost his entire family during their terrible final battle between the Avengers and Ultron. While Barnes had watched on with horror, Zemo unleashed his plan by using the security footage from Howard Stark's own fatal \"car crash\" to reveal Barnes was actually responsible for the deaths of Stark's parents, as he had been sent to steal the Super Soldier Serum from them.\n\nIron Man, blinded by his utter rage upon learning who had actually killed his own mother and father, attacked Barnes and did not listen to Rogers' explanation that HYDRA had made Barnes kill them via brainwashing, resulting with a fight with both Barnes and Captain America. Although Barnes attempted to defend himself, Iron Man had thrown him across the facility and pinned him down, furiously attempting to avenge his parents' murder at Barnes' hands.\n\nDespite Captain America attempting to come to his rescue, Barnes was still pinned down as Iron Man knocked back his former friend and launched the Winter Soldier into the air. Once airborne, Iron Man had attempted to fire a rocket directly into Barnes' face, which he deflected and caused much of the facility to crumble around them. While this fight continued, Zemo silently made his escape, satisfied that he had caused this utterly terrible rift between the heroes.\n\nHaving just freed himself by Iron Man's vengeful rampage, Captain America then ordered Barnes to then desperately attempt to flee through the top of the silo, while he held back Iron Man. While the Winter Soldier attempted to make it up the several platforms to reach freedom, Iron Man had followed him despite considerable damage to his Mark XLVI Armor. Although Iron Man almost reached him, Captain America came to his aid and helped him escape.\n\nDespite having left him at bay, for the time being, Captain America acknowledged that Iron Man was not going to stop and ordered Winter Soldier to escape while he could, while Captain America still attempted to keep him at bay. Despite having Captain America still fighting him, Iron Man still managed to prevent Winter Soldier from escaping as he destroyed the hatch by firing his missile at it, which had kept Winter Soldier trapped inside the facility.\n\nNow trapped with the man who was determined to kill him, Winter Soldier then desperately tried to defend himself by using a steel beam before Iron Man locked him into a headlock. As Iron Man questioned if he even remembered killing his parents, Barnes then responded by insisting that he remembered every single person he had been forced to murder while working for HYDRA before Captain America had managed to separate their furious conflict.\n\nWitnessing Captain America desperately fighting to defend him as Iron Man demanded vengeance for his mother's murder, Barnes furiously grabbed Captain America's Shield and attacked Iron Man, as Winter Soldier and Captain America both fought together to defeat the enraged Iron Man who was determined to gain revenge for the murder of his parents. Once Captain America had been subdued, Winter Soldier angrily fought against Iron Man on his own.\n\nThe fight ended when Winter Soldier had attempted to rip out Stark's own Arc Reactor, which then had just resulted in Barnes' metal arm being destroyed by a powerful blast of energy. Captain America then responded by disabling Stark's Arc Reactor, shutting down the armor Stark was using. Now fugitives, the two then fled the facility, Captain America laying down his shield, as Stark's father was the one who created it and therefore still technically owned it.[4]\n\nOnce outside the facility, Rogers and Barnes were then confronted by the Black Panther, who revealed that he had overheard everything and had already apprehended Zemo. Before leaving to take Zemo to Everett Ross, Black Panther then told Barnes that he had sources in Wakanda that could help remove HYDRA's programming. As Rogers went to save his teammates from the Raft, Barnes stayed behind in the Quinjet, his injuries making him unable to assist.[22]\n\nHealing His Mind[]\n\nTreatment in Wakanda[]\n\nSome weeks after their escape from the Raft,[22] Barnes was granted asylum within Wakanda where he had all the remains of his mostly-destroyed robotic arm removed. Barnes and Steve Rogers were then told by T'Challa that Barnes would have to return to cryo-sleep stasis to have a better chance of finally having his Winter Soldier programming removed.\n\nThough Rogers disagreed, he left the choice to Barnes, who decided to give it a chance. Once Shuri had explained how she intended to remove the HYDRA programming,[22] Barnes willingly went back into cryogenic sleep until the Wakandan scientists could cure him of HYDRA's brainwashing. As Barnes went under the ice, Rogers then stood by his friend and offered him support as they said goodbye to each other once again just before Barnes was then refrozen.[4]\n\nFreedom from Brainwashing[]\n\nDuring their months of work, Shuri voiced her idea to reset Barnes to remove the trigger words to T'Challa as she continued her work to try and help him return to a normal life.[22] By 2017, Barnes had been released from his Cryostasis Chamber, and found himself in the Wakandan forest with Ayo in order to try to see if Shuri's deprogramming permanently removed the Winter Soldier Programming that turned him into a ruthless killer.\n\nHowever, Barnes was skeptical of this, believing it would never work, but Ayo swore she would stop him from hurting anyone. Ayo thus uttered the trigger words that turned him into the Winter Soldier, although Barnes was stressed hearing them, only to find that the latter was immune to HYDRA programming and was a sign that Shuri's deprogramming had worked perfectly and he was finally free from his life as a murderer, much to Barnes' delight, who cried tears of joy upon hearing this news.[23]\n\nSpeaking with Shuri[]\n\nWith the HYDRA brainwashing having been removed from his mind and him having been set free from his Cryostasis Chamber, Barnes had then began his recuperation in the remote Wakandan village. One morning, Barnes, who had been titled as the \"White Wolf,\" woke to find himself being pestered by a trio of Wakandan children, who were watching him as he slept, before Shuri arrived to help with his rehabilitation, with Barnes stepping out of his hut and watching the children leave.\n\nAs Barnes looked over a river, Shuri stood by him and greeted him, calling him Sergeant Barnes, to which he insisted that she instead call him Bucky. Shuri had then asked Barnes how he was feeling, to which Barnes told her he was feeling good and thanked Shuri for all of her work in curing him of what HYDRA had done. Shuri then invited Barnes to follow her, noting that there was still much more for him to learn, while Barnes took a moment to look at the peaceful Wakandan rivers.[3]\n\nInfinity War[]\n\nRecruited to Fight[]\n\nHaving had his mind repaired by Shuri, Barnes' recovery continued as he had begun to work as a farmer within Wakanda to try and gain some normality back into his life and find inner peace away from his life as an assassin for HYDRA. However, Barnes' attempts at a peaceful life were shattered in 2018 when T'Challa and Okoye visited him, needing his help as T'Challa noted that the White Wolf had rested for long enough.\n\nBarnes had then greeted them both while he saw T'Challa had come bearing a new cybernetic arm to replace the one that Tony Stark had destroyed in Siberia. Without any hesitation, Barnes asked where the fight was, knowing this would be the only reason why T'Challa would bring him a new arm. T'Challa told him that the fight was currently on its way as Thanos was attempting to unite all of the Infinity Stones in a final effort to wipe out half of all life in the entire universe.\n\nBarnes accepted the mission to defend the Earth, attaching his new arm to his body as he joined T'Challa and the Dora Milaje in greeting all of the remaining members of the Avengers once they had arrived in Wakanda in an attempt to protect Vision from Thanos' forces and ensure Thanos would not get his hands onto the Mind Stone. While T'Challa then explained their situation, Barnes greeted the team and reunited with his old friend, Steve Rogers as the pair shared a hug.\n\nWhile the Avengers then met with Shuri to try and figure out a way to remove the Mind Stone from Vision without killing him, Barnes and Falcon stood outside where they noticed Thanos' army arriving. Barnes and Falcon had then watched as Thanos' dropships began to crash onto Wakanda's protective dome, which exploded on contact and making Barnes declare that he loved Wakanda. However, Barnes then saw more dropships began to land outside of the dome.[8]\n\nBattle of Wakanda[]\n\nAs the Outrider Dropships landed at the border of Wakanda, Barnes had then joined the forces of Wakanda in mounting a defense, along with the remaining Avengers who were with them. Barnes then stood back with M'Baku's forces as he watched on as Steve Rogers had then gone down to the shield barrier, to negotiate with the Black Order before their fight could begin, along with both Natasha Romanoff and Black Panther, although their negotiations had soon failed.\n\nAs Rogers returned to the Wakandan forces, Barnes then questioned whether Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian had agreed to surrender to them, although Rogers noted that they had not. Barnes then stood by and watched on as Midnight had opened their Dropships, causing thousands of Outriders to charge forward towards the shield barrier, as they then began getting torn apart upon making contact with their barrier, as Barnes realized they were not stopping pushing through.\n\nDespite being killed by their barriers, the mindless Outriders pushed through regardless, killing themselves until a few dozen got past, as Barnes, along with other Wakandan soldiers, fired upon the Outriders before they could reach them. However, they soon realized that these Outriders were running around the barrier, in order to reach Shuri and Vision before they could remove the Mind Stone, which then forced Black Panther to order that their barriers be slightly opened up.\n\nOnce Black Panther had opened these barriers so they could directly fight them, Barnes took out several Outriders with his gun until one attacked him and had knocked his gun away, slaying it with his knife. Once Barnes started to become overwhelmed by the army, he was saved from their grasp once Thor arrived along with Rocket Raccoon and Groot via the Bifrost Bridge. The arrival of Thor gave Barnes and the warriors the advantage they needed to hold back the Outriders.\n\nAs the battle continued, Barnes had crossed paths with Rocket and the two were shooting down the Outriders until Barnes noticed that they were becoming surrounded by multiple enemies from all sides. Needing to quickly take down the Outriders from around them before they became completely overwhelmed and slaughtered, Barnes had resorted to picking up Rocket and spinning in a circle while both fired their weapons, cutting down a number of these Outriders in time.\n\nWith the Outriders around them gunned down, Barnes then dropped Rocket, who had then inquired how much Barnes wanted to sell his gun for. Barnes simply replied that it was not actually for sale. Rocket then inquired about Barnes' prosthetic arm, which he also wanted to buy from him, but Barnes walked off without answering the question. Rocket muttered that he was going to get that arm. As the battle had concluded, Barnes continued fighting against all the Outriders.[8]\n\nThanos' Victory[]\n\nBarnes joined the others in the forest to protect Vision and then witnessed a wormhole open up. He watched as Thanos walked through and survey the area. As Thanos walked towards Vision, Barnes attempted to stop him by shooting his guns at Thanos, with Natasha Romanoff and Okoye joining him, only for Thanos to effortlessly blast Barnes away with the Power Stone, after all of Barnes' shots proved to be completely useless against him.\n\nWhen Barnes regained consciousness, he watched as Thanos united the Infinity Stones in the Infinity Gauntlet and snapped his fingers. Afterwards, Barnes sensed something was off and called out to Steve Rogers before disintegrating into dust.[8]\n\nBattle of Earth[]\n\nFive years later, as a result of the Blip, Barnes was restored to life and reappeared in Wakanda. Soon after, he, Sam Wilson, Wanda Maximoff, Groot and the Wakandan armies were recruited by the Masters of the Mystic Arts and brought via Inter-Dimensional Portals to the ruins of the Avengers Compound in New York. There, Barnes joined the other Avengers and assembled allies to face off against an alternate Thanos and his entire army.\n\nFollowing Captain America's leadership, Barnes had charged to the battle against Thanos' army of Sakaarans and Chitauri. During the battle, Barnes reunited with Rocket Raccoon as they shot down Thanos' soldiers side-by-side.\n\nHowever, when Thanos saw that the battle was seemingly going against him, he instructed Corvus Glaive to fire down upon the battlefield from Sanctuary II. As missiles began firing down at the battlefield, Barnes barely survived one blast which struck next to him, sending Barnes flying back. However, they were eventually saved from all these missiles as Carol Danvers entered the battle and had managed to destroy Sanctuary II.\n\nAs their battle continued, Barnes resumed fighting against Thanos' entire army, until Iron Man had managed to steal the six Infinity Stones and inserted them into his armor to keep them away from Thanos. Stark then wiped out Thanos and his entire army at the cost of his own life.[24] With Stark dead, Barnes and the other heroes then dropped down to one knee, in a sign of respect for the Avenger who sacrificed his life to save their entire universe.[25]\n\nAs Barnes had been wounded during the battle, he spilled his blood on the battlefield, which was collected by Nick Fury's secret Skrull unit and placed into a vial known as the Harvest alongside other enhanced DNA samples. The Harvest vial was later administered by Super-Skrulls Gravik and G'iah, granting them access to Barnes' super soldier physiology and abilities.[26][27]\n\nSteve Rogers' Retirement[]\n\nA week later, Barnes attended Tony Stark's funeral at Stark's home. Barnes stood alongside Wanda Maximoff and Sam Wilson and watched on while Pepper Potts and her daughter placed Stark's final Arc Reactor into the lake to float away, with Wilson placing a comforting hand on Barnes' shoulder.[24] Rogers then confided in Barnes that he was planning to live the rest of his life in the past after completing his final mission, and he would return to the present at an old age to give a new version of his shield to Wilson.[28]\n\nThe next day, Barnes was present with Wilson and Bruce Banner in the forest outside of the Avengers Compound, which was being cleaned up, when Steve Rogers was preparing to undertake a mission to return all the six Infinity Stones and Mjølnir to their correct places in time in order to erase the branched timelines. While Rogers readied himself, Barnes shared a fond farewell with his best friend, as they recalled the final conversation they had before Barnes went to serve during World War II, before embracing each other.\n\nBarnes then stood by, watching as Rogers donned his Advanced Tech Suit and collected all the artifacts to be returned, before he was sent through the Quantum Tunnel by Banner in order to complete the mission. However, Rogers had failed to return after the scheduled five seconds, but Barnes appeared calm and turned away to spot an old man sitting alone on a bench near a lake. Barnes had immediately recognized this man as an elderly Steve Rogers.\n\nKnowing what was actually happening, Barnes called Wilson over as he beckoned him to approach Rogers, having been aware of his plan to travel to an alternate timeline to be with Peggy Carter in the 1940s to live a long and peaceful life with the woman that he loved, leaving his life as a superhero behind. Barnes then watched proudly, as Rogers had passed his shield onto Wilson, effectively giving Wilson the title of the new Captain America, which Barnes had quietly accepted was the correct decision.[24]\n\nMaking Amends[]\n\nConfronting L. Atwood[]\n\nReturning to the United States of America, Barnes was offered a deal by the federal government, wherein they would pardon him for his actions as Winter Soldier under the conditions that he undergo their court-mandated therapy sessions to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder.[29] Wishing to atone for his past, Barnes compiled a list of names in a notebook, consisting of the individuals whom he wished to seek closure, including Yori Nakajima, the father of his victim RJ Nakajima, whom he had befriended. Barnes would also receive texts from Sam Wilson, although he elected to ignore them.\n\nBarnes located L. Atwood, a former HYDRA asset, and discovered that she was continuing to abuse her power as a member of the United States Congress. Barnes went to the parking garage where her car was and attached a device to it that hacked into the vehicle. Later on, when Atwood and her co-conspirator got into the car and planned to kill Atwood's political rival, Lockhart, Barnes activated the device, locking the car's doors and driving it around the parking garage, terrifying Atwood.\n\nStopping the car, Barnes walked up to the car and spoke to Atwood through the car's now-open window, asking if she remembered him. When her co-conspirator tried to shoot Barnes, Barnes grabbed the gun and knocked him out with his vibranium arm. Barnes informed Atwood that he was no longer Winter Soldier and that she was part of his efforts to make amends, smiling before leaving the location. Federal authorities swarmed Atwood and took her into custody, as Barnes crossed her name off his list.[20]\n\nTherapy Sessions[]\n\nFollowing the capture of Senator L. Atwood, Barnes returned home. However, he had a nightmare of the massacre at the Hotel Inessa, where he killed an innocent bystander named RJ Nakajima, causing him to awake in a cold sweat. Later that morning, he attended a therapy session with Christina Raynor, informing her once again that he did not have a nightmare, although she did not believe him. Barnes notified her that he had crossed Atwood's name off his list, and ensured her that he did not break any of the three tenets he was told to follow.\n\nAs the pair continued talking, Barnes spoke of how he had been involved in conflict for nearly a century and he had a brief time of calm while living in Wakanda, and that he wanted to live in peace, which Raynor scoffed at. After looking through his cell phone, Raynor reminded him that he had been ignoring Sam Wilson's texts and that he should get closer to people, citing that being alone was a personal hell. She added that with his brainwashing being cleared from his mind in conjunction with his pardon, he was now free, although Barnes pondered what he was now free to do.[20]\n\nLunch with Yori Nakajima[]\n\nFollowing his therapy session, Barnes met Yori Nakajima outside their apartment arguing with a neighbor named Unique for putting his trash in Nakajima's can. After Barnes settled the problem, he took Nakajima to their regular restaurant Izzy and bought his lunch. Nakajima boldy asked the waitress Leah if she would go on a date with Barnes, to his embarrassment. While they were eating, Nakajima brought up his deceased son, and how he did not know how he died, which made Barnes fall silent, realizing that he was the one who killed his son, while being brainwashed.[20]\n\n[]\n\nBarnes went to the restaurant and brought Leah flowers in a gentlemanly fashion. There the two played the board game Battleship and drank some beer. However, after Leah brought up Yori Nakajima's deceased son, Barnes excused himself and left. He then went to Yori's apartment, feeling guilty for having killed his son when he was brainwashed as the Winter Soldier, where he paid Yori his lunch money and left.[20]\n\nNew Captain America[]\n\nIn his apartment, Barnes watched the news, and learnt to his shock and outrage that John Walker had been named as the new Captain America and listened as he was announced to the world and was interviewed, seething more and more especially as Walker stated he felt Captain America was a brother.\n\nFurious with Sam Wilson for giving up the shield and letting Walker become the next Captain America, Barnes went to a United States Air Force base and found Wilson at the USAF terminal and demanded to know why he abandoned the shield when it was clearly the wrong thing to do. Getting frustrated as Wilson made it clear he never saw that coming, Barnes continued to berate Wilson, stating that he had no right to give up the shield and it wasn't what Rogers wanted, only for Wilson to hotly fire back that Barnes also didn't have any right to talk about his rights.\n\nBarnes and Wilson then stopped walking, for Wilson to tell him that he had more important issues to focus on. Wilson then revealed that he was travelling to confront the online terrorist group Flag Smashers and told Barnes about them. Wilson also stated that he thought they were part of the big three, which were aliens, androids, and wizards. They then mentioned what terminology Doctor Strange was, before Wilson walked to the craft. Feeling that he should accompany Wilson, Barnes joined him and Joaquín Torres on the aircraft.[14]\n\nPartnership with Falcon[]\n\nChase of the Flag Smashers[]\n\nWhile on board the aircraft to Germany, Barnes became frustrated about Falcon not having a plan of attack and mentioned that Steve Rogers would have had a plan. After they had reached Munich, Barnes witnessed Falcon leap out of the plane. Soon after, Barnes followed and surprised Joaquín Torres, by jumping out of the aircraft without any flight gear. Barnes tried to use his vibranium arm to hold onto tree branches as he was falling, but he still landed roughly on the ground.\n\nHe and Falcon met up at an abandoned factory and Falcon used Redwing to tease Barnes, who was not amused. There they spotted the Flag Smashers loading up heavy boxes. After Falcon informed them that someone was inside the first truck whom he believed was a hostage, Barnes rushed off to the rescue.\n\nOn the highway, Barnes hopped onto one of the trucks and found boxes of vaccines and medicine. He then spotted what he and Falcon believed to be a hostage, but it was the leader of the Flag Smashers, Karli Morgenthau who with superhuman force kicked Barnes out of the truck.\n\nBarnes was restrained by Matias and Gigi on top of the truck, until Falcon came in to fight them off and Barnes freed himself after fighting back. Barnes and Falcon were aided by the arrival of John Walker and Lemar Hoskins who arrived via a helicopter and joined the fight against the Flag Smashers. During the ongoing fight, Barnes fell off the top of the truck and held onto the side of the truck, where Dovich attempted to kick him off.\n\nDue to Barnes' vibranium arm, Dovich was unable to force his arm away. Shortly, Falcon swooped underneath the truck and grabbed Barnes, with the two rolling in the grass and Barnes landing on top of Falcon. Barnes then told Falcon that they were super soldiers, before Falcon told him to get off of him.[14]\n\nRefusing the Offer[]\n\nBarnes and Sam Wilson had then returned to the highway and started walking towards the nearest airport which was twenty miles away. However, along the way they were found by John Walker and Lemar Hoskins, who passed them in their vehicle and then invited them to ride with them, but they refused initially.\n\nAfter being asked a second time, Barnes and Wilson then took the offer and joined Walker and Hoskins on their vehicle. However, after Hoskins mentioned he was called Battlestar and Walker referred to Wilson and Barnes as Captain America's wingmen, Barnes told the driver to stop the vehicle. He and Wilson then got off and left them.[14]\n\nReunion with Isaiah Bradley[]\n\nWhile on the plane back to the United States of America, Barnes suggested stealing the shield from John Walker again. However, Sam Wilson reminded him of what happened the last time, that Sharon Carter become an enemy of the state and he and Steve Rogers were in hiding for two years.\n\nBack in the United States, Barnes took Wilson to Baltimore, Maryland to the house of Isaiah Bradley, a black super-soldier who he had met in the 1950s in the Korean War. His grandson, Eli Bradley answered the door and told them his grandfather would not be seeing them, but Barnes told him to tell Bradley something only he would know.\n\nAfter the two were let in, Barnes told Bradley that he thought there were more super-soldiers out there and asked for his help, only for Bradley to become angry, as he made it clear that he was not interested in helping them and angrily told them to leave.\n\nAfter the two left, Wilson asked Barnes why he had kept Bradley a secret and Barnes told him that no one had known about him. They were interrupted when Baltimore policemen arrived and stated that Barnes was under arrest for missing his mandated therapy.[14]\n\nArrested and Released[]\n\nBarnes was taken to the police station, but was soon released. He was then taken to the main lobby where Christina Raynor, his therapist was waiting on him, as well as Sam Wilson. Raynor then instructed Barnes and Wilson to have a therapy session there at the station.\n\nBarnes and Wilson were then asked to have open dialogue and Barnes told Wilson how he felt with him giving up the shield. After Wilson realized the therapy session was not for him, he left, and Barnes followed shortly after, before asking Raynor what the second rule was they discussed.\n\nOutside the station, he and Wilson found John Walker and Lemar Hoskins waiting on them, but both turned down Walker's invitation to ally noting they were free agents. While walking down the street, Barnes told Wilson that he felt they needed to go and see Helmut Zemo to find out more about the Flag Smashers, which Wilson was highly reluctant about.[14]\n\nFreeing Helmut Zemo[]\n\nBarnes and Sam Wilson went to see Helmut Zemo, who was in an isolated cell in the Berlin Correctional Facility. Barnes told Wilson that he had to see Zemo alone, citing his hatred of the Avengers. Wilson pointed out to Barnes that Zemo did not particularly have an amicable relationship with Barnes either.\n\nBarnes went inside the cell and came face to face with Zemo, who was on the other side of glass. Zemo was surprised that he was there and recited the Winter Soldier Programming words, only for Barnes to say that did not work anymore. Zemo then told him that he knew that, but was just messing with him. Stepping closer to the glass, Zemo looked into Barnes' eyes, claiming that he still saw the Winter Soldier in him. Changing the subject, Zemo noted that Barnes had the luxury of being kept in a Cryostasis Chamber during his imprisonment, to which Barnes insisted that it had not been a pleasant time.\n\nZemo had then apologized to Barnes, insisting that his actions in framing him for T'Chaka's murder had never been personal, while calling him a means to an end. Barnes changed the subject and told Zemo that someone had recreated the Super Soldier Serum which got Zemo's attention and believed that Barnes was desperate to have to have come for his assistance. Barnes then asked Zemo what book he was reading and was given the book, after Zemo slipped it under the glass. Barnes then put a key card inside the book and returned it to Zemo, before leaving the cell, thus having given Zemo the means to escape the prison.\n\nBarnes and Wilson left the facility and Barnes took him to a garage nearby. After Wilson questioned what happened in the cell, Barnes told him in an indirect way that he had started a prison riot to allow for Zemo's escape. When Wilson figured that out and saw Zemo walking into the room, he got upset with Barnes for having freed Zemo without talking to him first. Wilson demanded that Zemo be returned to prison, but Barnes argued that they needed him. While they were talking, Zemo tried to intervene, but was immediately silenced by them.\n\nBarnes and Wilson took Zemo to his garage so he could get his belongings. After Zemo gathered his belongings, he took Barnes and Wilson to an airfield. Barnes and Wilson were brought by Zemo to his private plane and they flew off. On the plane, Zemo told them that they didn't know what life had been like in the correctional facility, but that Wilson might since he was on the Raft at one point.\n\nZemo became fascinated while reading Barnes' notebook, questioning who Nakajima was. In response, Barnes launched out of his seat and grabbed Zemo by the throat, vowing to kill him if he ever touched the notebook again. Zemo apologized, noting that he understood that it was a list of names of the people he had wronged as the Winter Soldier, while Barnes warned Zemo not to push his luck any more.\n\nZemo then informed them that they were going to Madripoor, while Wilson questioned what this place was, to which Barnes explained that it was an island in Indonesia, with Zemo noting that it was a lawless place. However, Zemo explained that they could not walk into Madripoor as themselves, as members of the Avengers would likely draw far too much attention, as Zemo informed Barnes that he would have to become the Winter Soldier once again, which Barnes reluctantly agreed to.[30]\n\nJourney to Madripoor[]\n\nOnce they arrived on the outskirts of Madripoor, Helmut Zemo told Barnes and Sam Wilson that they needed to remain in character upon entering the city. Once they had arrived inside Madripoor's centre, Barnes and Wilson were led by Zemo through the streets, passing armed guards and secret dealings along the way, as he took them past the Princess Bar and instead took them to the Brass Monkey Saloon.\n\nAfter Power Broker's henchmen had laid a hand on Zemo, Barnes was signaled by Zemo to assume his Winter Soldier persona. Barnes then unleashed his brutality upon the men and easily fought against them. While he was choking a man using his vibranium arm, Zemo stopped him, telling him they had to stay in character, before the bartender told them they could be seen by Selby.\n\nZemo explained that he wanted Selby to tell them everything they knew about the Super Soldier Serum, and in exchange, he would give her the Winter Soldier, as Zemo walked over to Barnes, who did not react, promising that he would give Selby the code words that would allow her to control him. Zemo had continued to mock Barnes, by caressing his face while promising that he would do anything that Selby required of him, with Selby noting that this was more like the Zemo she remembered, noting that she was glad she did not immediately have him killed.\n\nSelby informed them that the Super Soldier Serum was on Madripoor, where it was being developed by Wilfred Nagel, who had been recruited by the Power Broker to work on the serum, but things had since not gone to plan. However, after Wilson's phone rang and his cover was blown, Selby ordered them killed, only to be killed herself by a sniper. Following Selby's death, a bounty was placed on Barnes, Wilson, and Zemo immediately. Zemo urged them to leave and the three made a run for it out of the city as bounty hunters started appearing everywhere.\n\nThe three found themselves saved from the bounty hunters when Sharon Carter stepped out of the shadows and removed her hoodie. Barnes and Wilson told her not to shoot at Zemo who she wanted too, since it was his fault that she had to go into hiding. When asked why she was there, Carter reminded them of her going into hiding after stealing Captain America's Shield and the EXO-7 Falcon. She then agreed to help them and led them to her apartment.[30]\n\nUndercover Mission[]\n\nAt Carter's apartment, Barnes relaxed on the couch while Wilson changed clothes and Zemo got a drink. Carter then asked how John Walker was and noted that Barnes had always believed in a patriotic worldview, teasing him about being Captain America's best friend in World War II and how he was \"Mr. America.\" Barnes listened on as Wilson explained how the Flag Smashers had stolen the Super Soldier Serum, noting that Wilfred Nagel was their lead, who worked for the Power Broker. Although she warned them to stay out of this, Carter had eventually agreed to help them, if Wilson helped to clear her name.\n\nWith Carter agreeing to help, she explained that she would be hosting a party with some connected people, and advised them to stay out of trouble. At Carter's party which was in a night-club setting, Barnes kept an eye on Zemo. Eventually, Carter rejoined Barnes, Wilson, and Zemo, explaining that she had been able to locate Nagel, and they left.[30]\n\nAmbush at Buccaneer Bay[]\n\nThe following day, Barnes followed Sharon Carter's lead to the Buccaneer Bay shipyard on the outskirts of Madripoor and Carter reminded them that was still a bounty on their heads. Carter led them to a container where Wilfred Nagel seemingly was, giving each of them an earpiece so they could stay in contact, while she would stay outside to keep watch. Helmut Zemo led Barnes and Sam Wilson into Nagel's Laboratory. Entering the lab, Barnes and Wilson raised their guns, and soon found Nagel working on the Super Soldier Serum, as they turned off his music and surprised him.\n\nAlthough Nagel tried to force them out, he stopped once he saw Barnes, recognising him as Winter Soldier, while Nagel introduced Zemo, noting that Nagel would have heard of Zemo. While Nagel attempted to suggest they make a deal, Carter warned Barnes and the others on the radios that bounty hunters were arriving at the shipyard.\n\nBarnes listened as Nagel explained that HYDRA had recruited him into their Winter Soldier Program, continuing their work after the Winter Soldiers had failed to be controlled. Barnes listened to Nagel as he explained that he had come to Madripoor following the Blip, where the Power Broker funded his work, noting that he had created twenty vials of the serum, before Karli Morgenthau stole them. Once Carter stormed into the lab, warning that they were out of time, Zemo shot Nagel in the chest, killing him before Wilson and Carter took the gun away from him.\n\nWithin seconds, a bounty hunter shot the laboratory causing it to explode and Barnes, Wilson, and Carter hit the ground to avoid the blast. After they got back up, they noticed that Zemo had escaped. The three quickly found themselves cornered, but soon saw Zemo on top of a container shooting at the hunters, causing another explosion. Once they could run clear from the bounty hunters, they made their escape, and ran throughout the shipyard. As they were running, Barnes threw a pole into one of the hunters' shoulders.\n\nAfter running throughout the shipyard, Barnes, Wilson, and Carter were shortly met by Zemo who had stolen a getaway car. When Barnes got in the car, he got in the front seat and told Wilson he wouldn't give it up, who was forced to sit in the back. This was reminiscent of when he didn't give up his front seat for Barnes in 2016. So Wilson sat in the back as Zemo drove off away to his private plane.[30]\n\nTensions Increasing[]\n\nConfronted by the Dora Milaje[]\n\nWhile on the plane, Barnes was told by Sam Wilson of a lead in Riga, Latvia about a woman named Donya Madani who had just died at a Global Repatriation Council camp. After Wilson said that he wishes he had destroyed the shield, Barnes said he would take it if that was the case.\n\nUpon arriving in Riga, Barnes noticed Kimoyo Beads lying in the street and told Wilson and Helmut Zemo he would meet up with them shortly. He followed the beads down the street and soon came face to face with Ayo. She demanded to know where Zemo was[30] and asked why Barnes had allowed him to escape prison. Barnes, who had learned Xhosa, told a disappointed Ayo that Zemo was a means to an end, to which she said he had eight hours left with Zemo. After Ayo left, Barnes returned to the building where they were staying.[23]\n\nSearching for the Funeral[]\n\nBack in the room, Barnes talked with Sam Wilson and Helmut Zemo and they decided to go search for Donya Madani's funeral by exploring the Global Repatriation Council's refugee camp. At the camp, Barnes and Wilson split up and found that the refugees living there were followers of the Flag Smashers. With no luck in getting the funeral location, Barnes and Wilson met up in the courtyard where they watched Zemo talking with the refugee children, and were suspicious after Zemo got a girl to whisper something in his ear.[23]\n\nTensions with Helmut Zemo[]\n\nAfter getting a drink, Barnes walked over and sat on the couch opposite Sam Wilson. However, after Helmut Zemo had mentioned leverage over them, Barnes walked over and threw his drink out the window. He then threatened Zemo not to speak of leverage, until Wilson walked up and told Barnes to control his temper.[23]\n\nFuneral Interrupted[]\n\nThey followed Zemo through the streets, until they ran into Captain America and Battlestar who ended up joining them to the funeral location. At the building, Walker handcuffed Zemo to the wall, while Wilson went into the funeral to speak with Karli Morgenthau. Barnes stayed outside the room, standing in the doorframe. However, Captain America, growing impatient, tested Barnes' patience and mocked him for having the serum. He then told Barnes that if something happened to Wilson, it would be on his hands.\n\nEventually, Captain America broke into the room and threatened to arrest Morgenthau, leading her to flee. Barnes gave chase and leaped down the floor to the next floor, only to lose Morgenthau. He and Wilson met up and continued to search the building. Along with Battlestar, they eventually found Captain America standing next to an unconscious Zemo.[23]\n\nSkirmish with the Dora Milaje[]\n\nOnce they had returned to their building in which they were staying, Barnes got a drink while Sam Wilson talked to Helmut Zemo, who was recovering from getting knocked out.\n\nBarnes then realized the eight hours were up when Ayo, and two other Dora Milaje named Yama and Nomble arrived to arrest Zemo. Barnes and Wilson watched as Captain America challenged Ayo and then started fighting her and the others with Battlestar joining in. Barnes mocked Captain America as he struggled to fight against the Dora Milaje. Soon Wilson asked Barnes if they should intervene, so Barnes tried to stop Ayo telling her they should talk over it, but she detached his vibranium arm instead, disappointed with him for having freed Zemo.\n\nOnce Ayo realized Zemo escaped, she and the other Dora Milaje left, while Barnes reattached his arm while still in shock that Ayo had removed it. Afterwards, he and Wilson left the room shortly, leaving Captain America and Battlestar behind.[23]\n\nAmbushed by the Flag Smashers[]\n\nBack on the street, Barnes walked with Sam Wilson and heard from Wilson after he got a phone call that Karli Morgenthau wanted to meet with him alone. Barnes told him he was coming too and went with Wilson to an abandoned building, where they saw Morgenthau. Morgenthau noticed Falcon did not come alone, looking at Barnes, and told Falcon that she did not want to kill him, rather ask if he would join her.\n\nWhen Falcon got a notification from Sharon Carter about Captain America, Falcon told Barnes they had to move. Barnes leaped off the balcony only to get slammed into by Morgenthau who leaped the same time. As Falcon flew off, Barnes got back up and chased after Morgenthau as they ran towards the location. Once at the location, Barnes saved Falcon from Diego, jokingly telling him he was welcome, before engaging with another Flag Smasher using his knife mastery.\n\nAfter Battlestar was killed by Morgenthau and Captain America sped after the Flag Smashers, Barnes and Wilson left the building. Outside, Barnes and Wilson watched in the public square as Captain America murdered Nico with the shield, while onlookers watched in horror at the sight.[23]\n\nFighting for the Shield[]\n\nFollowing Captain America's incident, Barnes and Falcon chased after him to an abandoned warehouse and confronted him. Sympathizing with Captain America's desire to kill the Flag Smashers and his gri"
