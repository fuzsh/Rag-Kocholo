        "text": "15th President\n\nTerms: 1857-1861\n\nPolitical Policy: Democrat\n\nFirst Lady: Harriet Lane (niece)\n\nVice President: John C. Breakinridge\n\nOverview\n\nBorn: April 23, 1791, in Stony Batter, Pennsylvania... Buchanan presided over the dissolution of the Union. His faith that the legal system would resolve the slavery issue locked him into inaction. Most historians blame Buchanan for hastening the greatest crisis in American history... Died: June 1, 1868.\n\nThe Era\n\nGustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Felix Mendelssohn's Wedding March, and Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species published (1857, 1858, 1859)\n\nQueen Victoria and Buchanan exchange the first official transatlantic telegraph message (1858)\n\nRadical abolitionist John Brown leads a raid on a federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry; he is apprehended and hanged (1859)\n\nConstruction of the Suez Canal begins (1859)\n\nDomestic Policy\n\nAt his inauguration, Buchanan made his position clear: states should decide the legality of slavery within their borders. Two days later, the Supreme Court handed down a decision on a slave named Dred Scott, who argued that his residence in a free state made him a free man. The court disagreed, claiming that Scott was a piece of property without the rights of citizenship. One implication of the court's decision was that slavery could not be excluded from any U.S. territories. Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860 as an opponent of slavery's expansion prompted South Carolina and six other states to secede and form the Confederacy while Buchanan was still in office, before Lincoln was even inaugurated. The lame duck Buchanan tried to appease the South to no avail.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nWith his hands full at home, Buchanan's foreign policy was limited to attempts to influence the Americas. Efforts to annex Cuba derailed because the island would surely have entered the Union as a slave state. An American named William Walker was arrested for establishing a dictatorship in Nicaragua but Walker claimed to be acting as Buchanan's agent and was freed. American ships maneuvered Britain away from claims to American colonies and ground troops massed on Mexico's northern border. All of these clumsy coercive activities increased international enmity towards the United States."
