        "text": "History: This is the name of a Scottish clan associated with lands on the eastern shores of Loch Lomond and in the Lennox. â The name Buchanan was brought independently to North America from Scotland by several different bearers in the 17th and 18th centuries. George Buchanan came to MD in 1698. â James Buchanan (1791â1868), 15th President of the US (1857â61), was born near Mercersburg, PA, the son of a successful land speculator and store keeper, who had emigrated to PA from Scotland in 1783."
