        "text": "President James Buchanan passed away on June 1st, 1868. He was the 15th President of the United States and is widely regarded by historians as one of the very worst presidents. In many respects, his presidency was a failure. He is often faulted for inaction leading up to the Civil War. But it’s also important to remember Buchanan was much more than just a president.\n\nHe was a soldier serving as a reserve unit during the War of 1812. A fact that is still honored at his grave to this day. He was also a representative in Congress, a U.S. minister to Russia and Great Britain, and a senator and secretary of state. He dedicated his life to public service.\n\nBuchanan was well-respected in Lancaster and Pennsylvania at the time of his passing. Despite having requested no “pomp or parade” upon his death, the public would not have it. A newspaper account at the time of his death estimates that “not less than twenty thousand people were either in the procession or looking on at the mournful pageant as it passed through the streets.”\n\nHe was laid to rest at Woodward Hill Cemetery near his home, Wheatland, in Lancaster, Pennslyvania. I visited on a cool February morning, having just finished a tour of Wheatland. I was the only person at the grave. The grave is well-maintained and modest compared to some presidential graves I have visited.\n\nJames Buchanan’s granite tomb reads:\n\nHERE REST THE REMAINS OF\n\nJAMES BUCHANAN\n\nFIFTEENTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nBORD IN FRANKLIN COUNTY, PA, APRIL 23, 1791\n\nDIED AT WHEATLAND JUNE 1, 1868\n\nI did not spend a whole lot of time there. I took a few pictures and thought about what I had learned and known about Buchanan. If you are ever in the Lancaster area, make sure to check out his home, Wheatland, and then visit his final resting place."
