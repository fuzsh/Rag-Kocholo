        "text": "GENERAL ORDER.\n\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\n\nWashington , March 8, 1859.\n\nUnder instructions from the President of the United States, the Secretary of War with unfeigned sorrow announces to the Army the decease of the Hon. A. V. Brown, Postmaster-General, which occurred in this city at an early hour this morning.\n\nAn enlightened statesman and a distinguished and able member of the General Government has thus been stricken down at his post. The nation will mourn the afflicting dispensation which has left so great a void in its councils. A worthy and estimable citizen has been removed from the circle of his numerous friends. Society will mingle its grief with the patriotic regrets which the loss of a statesman will not fail to call forth.\n\nWhile the President, with the surviving members of the Cabinet, the legislative and judicial departments of the Government, will unite in every testimonial the sad occasion demands, it is fitting a similar respect should be shown to the memory of the distinguished deceased by the national arms of defense. Accordingly, half-hour guns will be fired from sunrise to sunset at every garrisoned military post the day succeeding the receipt of this order, the national flag will be displayed at half-staff during the same time, and officers of the Army will wear for three months the proper badge of military mourning.\n\nThe War Department and its bureaus will be closed until the day succeeding the funeral obsequies.\n\nJOHN B. FLOYD,\n\nSecretary of War.\n\nGeneral Order.\n\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, March 9, 1859.\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy, by the direction of the President, announces to the Navy and to the Marine Corps the lamented death of the Hon. Aaron V. Brown, Postmaster-General of the United States. He died at his residence in the city of Washington on the 8th of the present month.\n\nAs a mark of respect to his high character, his eminent position, and great public services, it is directed that on the day after the receipt of this order by the different navy-yards and stations and vessels of war of the United States in commission the flags be hoisted at half-mast from sunrise to sunset and that seventeen minute guns be fired at noon.\n\nOfficers of the Navy and Marine Corps will wear crape on the left arm for thirty days.\n\nThe Navy Department will be draped in mourning and will be closed until after the funeral.\n\nISAAC TOUCEY,\n\nSecretary of the Navy ."
