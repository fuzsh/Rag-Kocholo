Situated on a 10 acre Campus of History in the heart of Lancaster County, Wheatland is a beautifully preserved Federal style mansion restored to reflect the appearance of the house during Buchanan's 1856 campaign for the Presidency. Decorated with many of the home's original furnishings and architecturally un-altered since its construction, Wheatland offers a rare glimpse into the Civil War Era life and times of one of our nation's most controversial presidents.",
