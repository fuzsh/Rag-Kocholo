        "text": "Â I.Â CorrespondenceÂ (1783-1895)Â Â Â 22.3 Linear feetÂ ; 55 boxes, 2 volumes\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nMaking up the bulk of the collection, this series contains Buchanan's incoming correspondence, outgoing correspondence, as well as a small amount of third-party correspondence. A few letters of purely business interest are filed in Series V with other business papers. Incoming, outgoing, and third-party correspondence are each indexed, with dates of letters and microfilm reels on which they may be found. These indexes are filed at the end of each corresponding section within the series. For more in-depth description of the content of Buchananâs correspondence, see the \"Reel Notes\" in the published microfilm guide.\n\nIncoming correspondence is arranged chronologically, 1815-1868, and varies in content and volume. An index to incoming correspondence can be found in Box 44. Note that Buchanan occasionally drafted responses on blank portions of his incoming correspondence. Early incoming correspondence is sparse, consisting of letters relating to Buchananâs legal practice, business interests, personal life, Pennsylvania politics, and his service as a U.S. representative (1821-1831). The bulk of the material from the 1820s consists of constituent mail seeking appointments and favors, regarding Post Office service and locations, and reflecting opinions on the tariff, the National Road and other topics of current interest.\n\nIncoming correspondence in 1831 and 1832 concerns Buchananâs appointment as minister to Russia, but the collection includes relatively little from his time in Russia. Among the incoming correspondence during his service as minister (1832-1833) are signed copies of Secretary of State Edward Livingstonâs dispatches, correspondence from other Americans living in Europe, a few formal invitations, and letters from neighbors and friends at home.\n\nAfter Buchananâs return to the U.S., his incoming correspondence focuses on his service in the U.S. Senate (1834-1845). Both political and personal correspondence includes opinions on the Bank of the United States, the Anti-Masonic Movement, the economic dislocations following the Panic of 1837, the Democratic Party organization in Pennsylvania, the Subtreasury Bill, the election of 1840, slavery and abolition, and other domestic issues. Complaints from the unemployed, notably Philadelphia dock workers, and numerous requests for appointments and applications for private pension bills are also included. A sizeable amount of correspondence relates to the organization of the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1842. Friends and allies expressed support for Buchanan as a candidate for the presidency in 1844, and in the spring of 1844, scattered letters address Martin Van Burenâs candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination and the eventual nominee, James K. Polk.\n\nOn Feb. 17, 1845, President-elect Polk wrote to Buchanan offering him the post of secretary of state. After Buchananâs acceptance, and subsequent congratulatory letters, his incoming correspondence chiefly concerns foreign policy matters and other topics relating to the operation of the Department of State. Dominant topics include the crisis and eventual war with Mexico, brought about by the annexation of Texas, and the crisis with Great Britain regarding the Oregon Territory. Incoming correspondents expressed opinions regarding the Manifest Destiny doctrine, American expansionist sentiment, and the Wilmot Proviso, which sought to ban slavery in any territories claimed during the Mexican War. Buchanan also received many letters responding to his so-called âBerks Letter,â in which he proposed extending the Missouri Compromise line for new territories. Numerous individuals wrote to him in 1847 and 1848 offering loyalty and support for Buchanan as a potential presidential candidate, and Pennsylvania political figures reported their activities on his behalf in Philadelphia and around the state. Buchanan received numerous accounts of the Pennsylvania Democratic Convention held in Harrisburg on March 5, 1848, and New Yorkers and others wrote of their concern over the deep divisions within that stateâs Democratic Party. Friends sent a flood of reports from the National Democratic Convention, which convened in Baltimore on May 21, 1848, but after Buchanan failed to win the nomination, incoming correspondence dropped off. A few very interesting letters from Americans in Paris describe the March 1848 Revolution there.\n\nBuchananâs term as secretary of state ended in March 1849, and after his retirement to Wheatland, his incoming mail chiefly concerned old friends, private business matters, and requests for loans and favors from acquaintances and strangers. Beginning in March 1850, a sizeable number of letters discuss the Compromise of 1850 and other aspects of the slavery issue, as well as concerns over the future of the Union. In 1851 and 1852, Buchanan's incoming correspondence is largely political and centered on his possible presidential candidacy in 1852, with significant letters responding to a major political address Buchanan made in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, in which he held that the Compromise of 1850 was of paramount importance to the preservation of the Union. President-elect Franklin Pierce wrote to Buchanan in December 1852 asking his advice on the make-up of Pierceâs cabinet, and asserting that he would not appoint anyone (like Buchanan) who had previously held a cabinet post. At the end of March 1853, President Pierce wrote to Buchanan asking whether he would accept an appointment as minister to England.\n\nIncoming correspondence while Buchanan served as minister to England includes routine mission business, letters of introduction, and the variety of minor problems he faced as minister. There are scattered unofficial letters from Secretary of State William L. Marcy, including lengthy letters in 1854 reporting on negotiations with the British government on customs reciprocity and fisheries. A number of brief notes from the British Foreign Office concern the ministerâs dress at official British functions, a matter in which Marcyâs policy conflicted with British protocol. Incoming correspondence from home includes highly interesting reports on the rise of the Know-Nothing Party and the debate on the Nebraska Bill.\n\nIn the fall of 1855, Buchanan asked to be relieved of his assignment, and much of his incoming correspondence for the next few months relates to the U.S. political scene, his plans for coming home, and eventually his presidential candidacy. Throughout his presidential campaign, friends and strangers wrote offering political advice, expressing opinions on current issues like Kansas statehood and squatter sovereignty, requesting campaign funds or loans, and reporting on Democratic Party affairs. Buchanan was elected president in November 1856, and incoming correspondence turned to congratulations, requests for or advice on appointments for cabinet and other positions, reports on the composition and attitudes of the press in Washington and elsewhere, opinions on the slavery controversy and Kansas statehood, and updates on the upcoming Pennsylvania senatorial election. Buchanan also received a few letters from Supreme Court justices regarding the Dred Scott case.\n\nBuchananâs incoming correspondence while president (1857-1861) is varied and generally substantive, reflecting his responsibilities for overseeing domestic and foreign affairs and for leading the Democratic Party. Robert J. Walker and other observers sent the president informative reports from Kansas, while officials and private citizens reported on and analyzed developments in the territory, including the Lecompton Constitution, other aspects of the Kansas statehood question and slavery. Other significant topics of interest during Buchananâs presidency include the possible purchase or annexation of Cuba and/or Mexico; Democratic Party affairs, particularly in Philadelphia and New York; assorted patronage appointments; Stephen A. Douglasâs re-election to the Senate; the Mormons; and the 1860 presidential election and the hardening of sectional attitudes. Buchanan received eight telegrams regarding John Brownâs attack on the arsenal at Harpers Ferry. There are also routine letters on such housekeeping matters as the presidentâs domestic staff and his wine cellar.\n\nAfter the election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860, Buchananâs correspondents reported rumors of all sorts and offered opinions and advice on how to reassure the South. During January and February 1861, as the crisis deepened, Buchananâs incoming correspondence included an outpouring of letters from private citizens hoping that peace could be preserved. The president received letters from Southern governors announcing state policy and forwarding resolutions of secession, letters describing cabinet resignations and reorganizations, and letters from Northern state legislatures with resolutions protesting secession and offering support to the Union government.\n\nBuchanan returned to Wheatland after the end of his presidency on March 4, 1861. Political subjects dropped almost entirely from his incoming correspondence, except for some letters from ex-cabinet members Jeremiah Black and Edwin Stanton, who attempted for a time to keep him apprised of events in the new administration. Buchanan received a letter dated April 15, 1865 announcing the assassination of President Lincoln; only one other correspondent mentioned the tragedy. Most of his mail concerned mundane personal matters, requests for assistance, or reports on the activities and families of old friends. A sizeable volume of letters regards Buchananâs history of his administration, Mr. Buchananâs Administration on the Eve of Rebellion, which was published in book form in 1866.\n\nA small amount of incoming correspondence is filed out of chronological order at the end of this group; it was separated from the collection at the time microfilming began, but was restored before the end of that project.\n\nOutgoing correspondence is also arranged chronologically, 1811-1868, and contains drafts, letters, and copies in both Buchanan's and others' handwriting. The drafts and most of the copies apparently were retained by Buchanan for his own records and are items to which he attached particular importance. Many appear to have been saved because of the eminence of the addressee or the strength of Buchanan's personal or political attachment. Other drafts were preserved because they concerned very important or controversial subjects or Buchanan's personal business activities. Some letters were returned to Buchanan during his lifetime, while others were collected by his biographers and would-be biographers or purchased by or given to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. In some cases, Buchanan's letter or draft is accompanied by a copy. An index of outgoing correspondence can be found in Box 53. This series also includes copies of Buchanan's letters from other Historical Society of Pennsylvania collections.\n\nSurviving outgoing correspondence from the early part of Buchananâs life is exceedingly sparse. Beginning in 1825 there are a number of letters to Andrew Jackson, whom Buchanan admired and supported. Buchanan also saved drafts of letters to Jackson, Duff Green, Samuel Ingham, and others regarding an allegation that Buchanan had been the conduit of an offer from Henry Clayâs friends to Jackson of a âcorrupt bargainâ prior to the 1824 election.\n\nBuchanan's outgoing correspondence during his service as minister to Russia (1832-1833) includes drafts and/or copies of dispatches to the secretary of state and his messages to Russian officials, and offers detailed reports on his official negotiations, his meetings with the emperor, his life in St. Petersburg, and the problems of the mission. Following Buchananâs return to the U.S., his outgoing correspondence is light and chiefly political in subject matter, commenting on the Bank of the United States, abolitionist activities, and his own political plans.\n\nBuchanan accepted the office of secretary of state in 1845, and his subsequent outgoing correspondence includes instructions and messages to American diplomats and to private individuals who had business with the State Department. Buchananâs outgoing diplomatic correspondence includes important commentary on the Mexican War and the controversy with England over Oregon, though an increasing number of Buchananâs letters regarded national and Pennsylvania state politics.\n\nFollowing his term as secretary of state, Buchanan wrote to friends in Pennsylvania and elsewhere about politics and other current matters, including the tariff, Cuba, Central American affairs, slavery, the Wilmot Proviso, the Compromise of 1850, and his interest in obtaining the 1852 presidential nomination. In December 1852 and early 1853 Buchanan addressed several letters to president-elect Franklin Pierce, giving suggestions for creating a cabinet, conducting his administration, and recommending candidates for federal patronage appointments. Buchananâs outgoing correspondence while he served as minister to England (1853-1856) offers insight into Buchananâs diplomatic style and the importance of the London Mission.\n\nOutgoing correspondence is lighter after Buchananâs return to the U.S. in 1856. In Buchananâs draft letter of June 16, 1856, he accepted the presidential nomination of the Democratic National Convention, and in subsequent outgoing correspondence he articulated Democratic Party policy, directed campaign activities, and warned of the danger of sectional parties. His outgoing correspondence while serving as president illustrates his continuing interest in the future of Cuba and his efforts to obtain information about the activities of filibusterer William Walker, and includes copies of his private correspondence with Lord Clarendon of Great Britain.\n\nLetters and drafts from President Buchananâs final fourteen months in office offer very limited information on his reaction to the constitutional crises that confronted him. After leaving office, he continued to write of his faith in the strength of the Union, his conviction of the justice of its cause, and his confidence in its victory, as well as expressing concern for the welfare of the Democratic Party and his hopes for its future. Much of his correspondence from his retirement years consists of purely personal letters to relatives, former colleagues, and friends.\n\nA small amount of third-party correspondence contains letters addressed to members of Buchanan's household or his staff; other letters were probably delivered to him, either by the author or the recipient, in order to communicate information, an opinion, or a recommendation. Among the topics discussed in this correspondence are politics and political activity, Kansas, Cuba, patronage distribution, and the secession crisis. About one-third of this correspondence dates from after Buchanan's death, deriving mainly from efforts to engage a biographer, to collect information or impressions about Buchanan, or to defend and enhance his reputation. The provenance of some of the items is not evident. An index to third-party correspondence can be found in Box 57.\n\nThis series also contains two bound volumes of Buchanan's diplomatic correspondence (or extracts of correspondence) from his service as minister to England.\n\nÂ IV.Â Printed materialÂ (1814-1892)Â Â Â 6.5 Linear feetÂ ; 10 boxes, 14 volumes\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nThis series contains a variety of printed material, including books, pamphlets, broadsides, newspapers, loose clippings, and miscellaneous printed material. An index to the loose newspaper clippings, as well as a list of newspapers for which whole sheets are present, can be found in Box 61. Printed pamphlets include copies of Buchanan's speeches and remarks, other politicians' speeches and commentary, congressional reports, and campaign materials. Note that most of the pamphlets were rehoused and therefore do not have microfilm reel numbers marked on the folders; these were filmed on Reel 58.\n\nThis series also includes fourteen bound volumes, including Buchanan's own book, Mr. Buchanan's Administration on the Eve of the Rebellion.\n\nInventory of Pamphlets in Boxes 67-72\n\nBox 67 Pamphlets\n\nFolder 1. \"Copy of the Court of Common Pleas, of Lancaster County, in the case of Robert W.
