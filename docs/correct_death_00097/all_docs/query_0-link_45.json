        "text": "DO NOT REUSE\n\nBuchanan spent most of his non-public career in Central Pa.\n\n(Jim Cheney | Special to PennLive.com)\n\nSince the founding of our country, Pennsylvania has played a crucial role in the development of the United States of America. Many of our Founding Fathers spent much of their public careers in the state, and there are destinations throughout Pennsylvania with strong ties to a variety of presidents. However, did you know that Pennsylvania was the birthplace of only one U.S. President?\n\nThat's right. Of the 43 men to be President of the United States only one, James Buchanan, was born in Pennsylvania. (Interestingly, only two vice presidents were born in Pa.: Dallas Mifflin--under James Polk--and current Vice President Joe Biden).\n\nThe future 15th President of the United States was born in Franklin County, Pa., on April 23, 1791. His birthplace was just a few miles west of Mercersburg, Pa., where his father ran a trading post for those heading west. In 1797, Buchanan and his family moved to Mercersburg, and Buchanan lived in this community until he went to Dickinson College in Carlisle at the age of 16.\n\nUpon graduation, Buchanan moved to Lancaster, which would be his home for the remainder of his life. Over the years, Buchanan got his law degree and served in the military during the War of 1812 before being elected to serve in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He would go on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, as ambassador to both Russia and Great Britain, and as Secretary of State, before being elected president in 1856.\n\nThe four years of Buchanan's presidency were some of the most challenging in our nation's history, and Buchanan would retire to his home in Lancaster in 1861, living the rest of his life at Wheatland on the outskirts of downtown Lancaster.\n\nToday, visitors wanting to learn more about the life and career of Pennsylvania's only native president are able to head to several destinations related to his life.\n\nThe first is Buchanan Birthplace State Park near Cove Gap, Pa. After Buchanan's death, his niece Harriet Lane, who lived with life-long bachelor Buchanan in the White House, attempted to purchase his birthplace to create a monument. It wasn't until 1907, four years after Lane's death, that her estate was able to purchase the land.\n\nThey built a monument, which still stands today, made of local stones, and transferred the land to the state in 1911.\n\nToday, this pyramid-shaped monument still stands on the location of the log cabin in which Buchanan was born. Signage around the monument offers visitors a chance to learn about the life and legacy of James Buchanan.\n\nA few miles east on Route 16 is Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. Buchanan and Lane spent much of their childhood in this community, and many of the buildings have historical connections to them. A walking tour put together by the local chamber of commerce guides visitors through the community, pointing out notable buildings related to Buchanan and his family.\n\nBuchanan's childhood home in Mercersburg is now home to the James Buchanan Hotel, Pub and Restaurant. While the building has changed and expanded over the years, visitors can still get a small glimpse into what life was like for a young Buchanan.\n\nOn the campus of the nearby Mercersburg Academy sits a log cabin that is believed to have been the one Buchanan was born in. Today, it sits in a quiet corner of campus and is missed by most visitors to the area. Visitors to Mercersburg can also visit the childhood home of Harriet Lane as well as the burial site of Buchanan's parents.\n\nIn addition to stops in Mercersburg, Lancaster also offers interested visitors a chance to learn more about Buchanan's life.\n\nHis home, Wheatland, is operated by the Lancaster County Historical Society and is open for tours. Buchanan purchased this home in 1848 and lived there in between his political positions until his death in 1868. Remarkably, little has changed inside the home from when Buchanan lived there, meaning that visitors can have a great understanding of what life was like at the home for President Buchanan. Even much of the home's furniture came from Buchanan's time in the home or that of his niece, Harriet Lane.\n\nGuides take visitors through the home, focusing more on Buchanan's life than his somewhat controversial time as president. Tours last roughly an hour and give visitors a chance to see the home, Buchanan's White House desk, his personal China, and much more.\n\nJust a few miles from Wheatland, on the opposite side of downtown Lancaster, lies Buchanan's grave. This aging graveyard seems an odd place for a presidential grave, but the area around Buchanan's grave is well-maintained. The grave in Woodward Cemetery is modest compared to the graves of some other presidents, but seems fitting for a man who spent his career serving the country in a variety of positions.\n\nThere's no denying that James Buchanan is not considered one of America's greatest presidents. However, as the only president to hail from Pennsylvania, it's still interesting to take the time to learn about his life, career, and legacy."
