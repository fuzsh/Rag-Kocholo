Drake just dropped his new song and video a few hours ago. “Laugh Now Cry Later,” featuring Lil’ Durk, was shot at Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon

In the video, we see Drake playing various sports with some amazing athletes. He goes one-on-one with Kevin Durant, catches a pass from Odell Beckham Jr., and gets tackled by Marshawn Lynch; he also trains for boxing underwater and rides golf carts in the dark and drives a jetski.

He also makes fun of his own sensitivity: when he sings, “Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry, but you know now,” he gets interrupted while he’s crying. “It’s just been a long fight,” he explains. “But I’ve got to have a warrior spirit. I’m just regrouping. You got a tissue?”

Watch the video below.
