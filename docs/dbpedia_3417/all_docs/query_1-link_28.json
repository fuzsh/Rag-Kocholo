        "text": "What Is Pseudobulbar Affect?\n\nPseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a nervous system disorder that can make you laugh, cry, or become angry without being able to control when it happens.\n\nPBA has also been called:\n\nEmotional dysregulation\n\nEmotional incontinence\n\nEmotional lability\n\nInvoluntary crying\n\nPathological laughing and crying\n\nPseudobulbar Affect Symptoms\n\nIf you or someone you love has PBA, you might notice:\n\nSudden, intense fits of uncontrollable crying or laughter\n\nCrying or laughter that doesn't seem right for the situation\n\nOutbursts of frustration and anger\n\nFacial expressions that don't match emotions\n\nThe outbursts can happen several times a day or many times a month.\n\nSymptoms aren't linked to mood. In other words, you may feel happy but start crying and cannot stop. Or you could feel sad but start to laugh when you shouldn't. You might just cry or laugh a lot. Some people say the symptoms come on so quickly that it looks like aÂ seizure. It's easy to mistake the symptoms for those ofÂ depressionÂ orÂ bipolar disorder.\n\nIf you have PBA, you might get anxious or embarrassed in public. You might worry about a future episode and be tempted to cancel plans with friends or family. It can also lead to depression or anxiety.\n\nCaring for someone who has it might make you feel confused or frustrated. The emotional toll of the condition can greatly affect recovery and quality of life. It's important to seek care and treatment from a qualified doctor.\n\nPBA vs. depression\n\nDoctors may misdiagnose PBA for depression, as they share some of the symptoms. But in most cases with depression, you can control a symptom such as crying, and it stops once your mood changes. Also, crying typically matches your mood, meaning you do it when you feel sad or upset. And, unlike with PBA, laughter is not usually a symptom of depression.\n\nPseudobulbar Affect Causes\n\nScientists believe that PBA may result from damage to the prefrontal cortex, the area of yourÂ brainÂ that helps control emotions. Damage to other parts of the brain, as well as changes inÂ brainÂ chemicals linked toÂ depressionÂ and hyperÂ moodsÂ (mania), could also play a role.\n\nAn injury or disease that affects yourÂ brainÂ can lead to PBA. Other brain conditions commonly linked to PBA include:\n\nAlzheimerâs disease\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisÂ (ALS)\n\nBrain tumor\n\nDementia\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS)\n\nParkinson's disease\n\nTraumatic brain injury\n\nPBA after stroke\n\nPBA can happen if you've had a brain injury or live with a neurological condition such as a stroke. Research shows that more than one-third of people who've had a stroke have symptoms that suggest PBA.\n\nPseudobulbar Affect Diagnosis\n\nIf you or someone you love is crying or laughing a lot and you don't know why, talk to a doctor. PBA is hard to diagnose because it mimics other problems such asÂ depressionÂ or otherÂ mood disorders.\n\nTell the doctor about any symptoms, including when they happen and how long they last. It can help to keep a diary of crying and laughing episodes.\n\nYour doctor won't need to do tests to diagnose PBA. But to rule out a form ofÂ epilepsyÂ that can cause similar symptoms, they might order an electroencephalogram (EEG), a painless test that tracks your brain waves.\n\nPseudobulbar affect test\n\nTwo questionnaires help to tell if the laughing and weeping are signs of PBA:\n\nPathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS).Â The doctor asks you questions about the episodes, including how long they lasted, how they were tied to your mood and social situation, and how upset you felt afterward.\n\nCenter for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS).Â You answer questions about your symptoms, including how often you have them and how they make you feel. For example, \"I find myself crying very easily\" or \"I'm easily overcome with laughter.\"\n\nPseudobulbar Affect Treatment\n\nDoctors might prescribeÂ antidepressantsÂ to control PBA symptoms. In 2010, the FDA approvedÂ dextromethorphan/quinidineÂ (Nuedexta), the first PBA medication. Studies show it helps control outbursts of crying and laughing in people withÂ MSÂ and ALS. Internists, neuropsychologists, neurologists, and psychiatrists can help diagnose and treat PBA."
