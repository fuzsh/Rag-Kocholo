Stream it below via Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nThis 16-track effort marks Lil Durk’s second full-length of 2020, coming just a few months after Just Cause Y’all Waited 2. As indicated by the cover artwork, The Voice is dedicated to fellow Chicago rapper King Von, who was fatally shot outside of an Atlanta nightclub in November. King Von also appears posthumously on a track called “Still Trappin'”. Additionally, in the video for “Backdoor”, Durk can be seen wearing King Von’s O’Block chain.\n\nThe Voice also features previous singles like “Stay Down” (featuring Young Thug and 6LACK) and the title track.\n\nRelated Video\n\nOutside of his new album, Lil Durk has spent the last 12 months collaborating with Drake on “Laugh Now Cry Later” and Megan Thee Stallion on “Movie”. He’s also appeared on projects from Meek Mill, Nas, Future, and Lil Yachty.\n\nThe Voice Artwork:"
