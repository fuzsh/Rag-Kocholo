        "text": "Episode: Life Before His Eyes, Episode 9.14. The 200th episode. Yes, I am shocked we made it here too. This blog, not the show. I also try not to think about the fact that we’re not even halfway through.\n\nIn any event, I very much appreciate all my readers, and please see below for a new section entitled, “Shameless Plugs.”\n\nAir Date: February 7, 2012.\n\nThe Victim: Petty Officer Janet McCaffrey, USN.\n\nAlso, Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, NCIS.\n\nWait, what?\n\nEmotionally Traumatized, But Ultimately Irrelevant, Witness Who Finds the Body: It’s early morning. An old country song plays in the background. We’re at a diner positioned under a highway overpass. I’ve never seen that in real life, but maybe it’s a thing. Leroy Jethro Gibbs exits his truck and says a very pleasant good morning to a couple and tells them to stay warm. The waitress, Elaine, knows Gibbs by name and mentions a big rig accident. They small talk it and then she moves to get him coffee to go. He says she’s too good to him. She says she’s just waiting for the proposal. He laughs, and it’s a genuine laugh.\n\nThen things get weird. And dangerous. A guy in a hoodie stands up from a booth and begins walking towards Gibbs. He pulls a gun. Gibbs’s Gibbs Sense has already allowed him to take notice of the guy and he gets his gun out (extremely quickly), says “Federal agent” and tells the guy to put the gun down. We see the perp’s muzzle flash…\n\n…and then the world goes crazy. A bright white screen takes us to a collage of images from Gibbs’s life. A lot of images. It would take me a week to catalogue them all. Some we’ve seen before- Gibbs’s father yelling (not sure which appearance), Gibbs’s life with Shannon and Kelly, meeting Mike Franks after their murder, Kate Todd. Some are new- I think I saw Kelly (Or Gibbs?) being born. Some kids on a playground. The house where Gibbs presumably grew up. Some are ordinary, like Gibbs kissing Abby’s head or discussing a case with the team. It’s very impressive, and the images come quicker, and there are more and more even when you think you’re done.\n\nAnd look, somebody put this sequence on YouTube and slowed it down for us. And set it to Evanescence, which initially caused me to sarcastically raise an eyebrow. But then it grew on me. Nice work, silverfox21.\n\nWe cut back to Gibbs. Time is frozen. He’s still pointing his gun. There’s a bullet hanging in mid-air in front of him. But Gibbs can move. He looks over at a booth and sees his grinning father. Behind him, in another booth, is his team.\n\nA woman at the counter says, “Jethro!” excitedly. It’s Private Joan Matteson, Gibbs’s gone-too-soon friend from boot camp. Engagement, Part One and Two, Episodes 9.8, 9.9. Gibbs smiles broadly, but then gets shouldered aside by his younger self, in Marine fatigues, who walks over to hug Pvt. Matteson. Gibbs has a total “Wha…?” look on his face, which is not customary.\n\nThen Mike Franks himself walks up to his slack jawed former Probie and flicks the bullet out of the air. Franks asks how he looks. Gibbs, clearly aware of things that have taken place in the real world expresses shock that Franks is alive. But Mike Franks is a dick even in the afterlife and immediately lectures Gibbs for hesitating and not killing the assailant first. See also Judgment Day, Part Two, Episode 5.19.\n\nGibbs catches on quick and doesn’t spend the usual amount of time in denial that occurs in movies and TV episodes like this. He simply asks if it’s over and, more annoyed than desperate, says he wasn’t done yet. Franks segues right into his Jacob Marley role and says that folks want to help Gibbs see the things he accomplished. Understand the choices he made. “Jethro, this is your life we’re talking about.”\n\nOK then.\n\nCue credits.\n\nPlot Recap: We come back where we left off. Gibbs and Franks settle into a booth. Franks did not expect to see Gibbs so soon. McGee, who as far as we know is not dead, walks past Gibbs. Jenny Shepard, who is dead, sits a few booths back. I dunno…Gibbs is a stoic, so he’s not going to shit his pants or rend his garments over dying. But he accepts all this a little too quickly for such a tough old bird. He simply says he didn’t see it coming.\n\nA waitress drops off a menu that only has steak, coffee, and whiskey on it. See, it is Heaven. I bet the TV only plays Westerns.\n\nFranks calls this experience a gift, a chance for closure. Gibbs dismisses it with his usual self-effacing modesty. But Franks continues, referencing the hundreds of cases Gibbs solved, and the family members who experienced comfort and closure each time Gibbs and team put away murderers and terrorists.\n\nPalmer nods and smiles softly at Gibbs and walks out the diner door. But then Ari Haswari walks in, smirking the Ari smirk. Gibbs notes Ari’s presence but doesn’t otherwise react.\n\nFranks continues expositing about Gibbs’s impact. But Gibbs remains confused. Franks moves this into reverse Christmas Carol territory (read: It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)), explaining that things would have changed if Gibbs had done things differently. But why go back three decades when they can go back to yesterday? Franks asks Gibbs to tell him how it started.\n\nGibbs says it was like any other day…\n\nNow we have our usual opening. McGee arrives at work while Tony and Ziva are puzzling over why McGee altered the set-up of the monitors on his desk. There’s some back and forth about how maybe he’s depressed, but McGee claims he just needed a change. Gibbs arrives to tell him not to change and then summons the team to a ship in dry dock to investigate a dead petty officer.\n\nIn the command hub of the USS Gentry, McGee reports that only the captain, the XO, and select people are allowed access to the ship’s area, particularly when the ship is in dry dock. Ducky reports that our victim was none of the above. The body, a woman, evinces a couple of bullet holes. Tony finds two shell casings. Gibbs says to search for bullets.\n\nWitnesses are few. A welder heard something but didn’t check until it was too late. Because of the repairs, the ship’s crew is down to only essentials: ten crew members plus guards at the ramp. Ship’s security didn’t see anybody leave and McGee didn’t see anybody when he checked surveillance. Tony thinks the perp could still be on board. Ziva, having found a small blood trail, agrees, and whispers Gibbs over to a cargo bay door. They pull their guns and enter the darkened area. They find an unconscious man, holding a gun, and with blood stains on his shirt. Tony asks if it’s the shooter. Gibbs, ever professional, says he doesn’t know yet.\n\nBack in ghost world, Gibbs’s eyes are closed. Franks says he can rest later.\n\nWe see Vance sitting with Ari at the diner’s counter. They are playing chess.\n\nGibbs remains confused. He didn’t ask for this. Franks says he earned it. Sometimes people die for a reason and good comes from the hurt. Gibbs tells him not to talk like a greeting card. Over at the counter, Fornell turns and raises a coffee mug to Gibbs.\n\nFranks takes Gibbs out of the diner. Ducky greets him with a “Jethro” as he’s leaving. Gibbs takes a look at his younger self and Pvt. Matteson talking over the menu. Then he walks out.\n\nFranks is with Gibbs now, in the squad room. It’s empty, and Gibbs ask why they are there. Franks says that one decision can change everything. When Gibbs asks for the point, Franks says there’s a point to everything, you just have to find it.\n\nGood thing bullets just float in the air in Heaven, or Gibbs might shoot him.\n\nGibbs steps over to Ziva’s desk. On it is a photo of Tony and Kate. Tony has his arm wrapped around Kate. She’s reciprocating. They are standing in front of a lake. “Kate,” Gibbs says. He looks at Tony’s desk and finds a different, but similar photo of the two agents. Then he states the obvious” “Agent Todd’s dead.” Franks says, “Doesn’t have to be.” Then he suggests a world where Gibbs saw Ari on that rooftop. Twilight, Episode 2.23.\n\nWe flash back to Kate yelling “Shooter!” and then jumping in front of Gibbs to take a bullet from a terrorist with her vest. Gibbs ventilates the guy just like in the original episode and he and Tony check on Kate, who, because of the aforementioned vest, is just bruised. She’s snarky with Tony. But then it changes. Gibbs looks over at the roof across the way and sees a glint of light form Ari’s scope. He calmly tells McGee over the comm to order in air support for the sniper, and he and Tony tell Kate to stay down. On the rooftop, Ari makes ready to shoot. But he doesn’t have a shot. And here comes a chopper. He rabbits.\n\nBack in the diner, Franks is raving over the food, and crabbing at Gibbs for never bringing him to eat there. Gibbs is confused. Did Ari kill Kate or not? Franks says Gibbs stopped him this time. What if this time could be different? Gibbs asks if Kate is alive. Franks says that if Kate doesn’t die, a lot of things are different.\n\nWe flash to a hospital. Tony, not dressed in a suit, comes off an elevator and asks if he missed it, and laments that he told “her” he wouldn’t miss it. McGee and Abby are in a hall and McGee excuses Tony as having been undercover. Tony should have let McGee work the op and is angry at himself. Abby says everything works out, and then exposits that she and McGee are a couple and says, “Look at me and Tim. This was meant to be.”\n\nHeh. Which is such a TV alt-universe line of dialogue. We need to quickly exposit this weird difference to the audience, so let’s have character X toss out a clunky non-sequitur that makes them look wholly self-absorbed.\n\nTony approaches the doctor, who lets him in a room. Kate is there, in pajamas, staring him down. “At least you look smaller,” is both the exact wrong thing to say, and exactly the kind of thing Tony would say to Kate in a situation where they’re married and having a baby. Yup, Tony’s a dad. He and Kate have a baby boy. Tony tells her nice job, and she tries to make a smirk-face, but it twists out of her control into a genuine smile. Great acting kudo to Sasha Alexander (even if this was archived footage from SWAK, Episode 2.22).\n\nWe’re back in the diner. Franks is talking about dominos and ripples and all the other metaphors for cause and effect. He calls Gibbs the catalyst. Of course, if Kate lives…what happens to Ziva?\n\nThe interrogation room happens to Ziva. Outside, Vance tells Tony that he knows her father, and to be careful with “this one.” Tony says dangerous women are his specialty and holds up his wedding ring. Vance knows Tony’s specialty, but…seems to like him better in this world. He calls him “Tony” instead of “DiNozzo.” Tony is moving with more confidence too, which is a hell of an acting trick by Weatherly. He normally plays Tony as manic and vaguely, but only vaguely, insecure. This version is noticeably steelier.\n\nTony joins Ziva. Her hair is wild like when we first met her. Tony remembers her. He pretends not to know her name and recollects following her to a hotel pool once. Kill Ari, Parts One and Two, Episodes 3.1 and 3.2. She claims not to remember him.\n\nIn the diner, Gibbs says Franks doesn’t get to blame him for everything. Franks didn’t say everything. But he says they’re just as responsible for the things they don’t do as the things they do. He takes Gibbs back to the previous day and says there was more to the case than Gibbs saw coming.\n\nBack to the squad room. Tony is still snooping McGee’s desk. Ziva whispers the code word “Albatross” to alert that McGee is returning. They hop up and start backgrounding the victim, Petty Officer Janet McCaffrey. She had a spotless record, and two deployments on two different ships. McGee is not fooled by his seemingly on-task fellow agents.\n\nGibbs shows up and Tony says Petty Officer McCaffrey’s bank records showed two recent large deposits. He is still tracing the source. The civilian they found at the scene is Peter Germaine. He is still in the ICU. He works for a shipbuilding firm that was just absorbed by a Chinese company. McGee and Ziva note the protocols of having a foreign-owned company work on a Navy ship. The sensitive data, including the hard drives, are supposed to be removed. But, on the Gentry, the surveillance drives are still intact. It all smells like treason and Ziva suggests an agreement between the two victims went sour.\n\nGibbs gets a call. He leaves to go see Abby. Abby is working on…a shirtless Palmer? A ripped, shirtless Palmer. Geez. Anyway, Palmer pulled his oblique moving Petty Officer McCaffrey’s body and Abby is helping out with some sort of massage technique? Embarrassed, Palmer makes himself scarce.\n\nAbby reports that all three slugs, from Petty Officer McCaffrey and Germaine, came from the same gun. Meaning, the gun found with Germaine. Someone else shot both victims and then staged the scene to look like Germaine did it. The gun, a Glock, is not registered and the serial number is filed off. But a print on the gun belongs to Michael Rose, a freelance systems analyst who does a lot of work for the Navy. Gibbs says all three had clearance to board, so maybe it was a conspiracy. Then he offhandedly remarks on behalf of the audience, “Who knew Palmer had abs like that?”\n\nI feel like I know a lot about this show, but I don’t recognize the woman who walks behind Gibbs and waves happily as we return to the diner. Gibbs reiterates to Franks that he’s not taking the blame for every coulda, shoulda, didn’t. Or tries to. Franks is gone. A waitress we can’t see brings Gibbs some pie. He didn’t order any pie. She says that sometimes we don’t know what we want until we see the possibilities and puts chocolate drizzle on the pie. Gibbs says, “My mom used to do this,” and asks her name. The waitress says her name is Ann. Gibbs says, “That was my mother’s name.”\n\nAnn says it will hurt her feelings if Gibbs doesn’t eat. He says he can’t. She says she feels bad for him as he tries to figure all this out, particularly her being there, not a day older than the last time he saw her. She gets a little misty and then tells him how proud she was of him as a boy. And a man. And everything in between. She offers to wrap up the pie so he can take it home. He asks if he gets to go home. She says, “Eventually.”\n\nAnn does have one bone to pick, though. She looks over at a booth that is now populated by young Gibbs and Jackson Gibbs, Gibbs’s father. They appear to be yelling about Gibbs being a Marine. Ann thinks Gibbs could have cut Jack some slack. Gibbs says that Jack hated her for leaving. She says he had one foot out the door anyway, but she doesn’t care. She says he drove a few women home, but that she put him through hell and men that age shouldn’t be changing their wife’s bedsheets every night. She also says the best thing she did for everyone was leave. Gibbs doesn’t want to hear that. But Ann says it’s true.\n\nYoung Gibbs leaves the table and storms out of the diner. Ann says when you raise a son alone, you need a couple of miracles for things to turn out right.\n\nThen she says, “Just ask Michael Rose.”\n\nWe return to the squad room, where the team backgrounds Michael Rose. Rose is divorced, a single dad, and a computer systems analyst for the government. He also has major money problems and a house in foreclosure. Rose is raising a seventeen-year old son named Stephen, an honor student. Rose’s co-workers haven’t seen him, and his voicemail is full. Rose deposited $20k in an account within the last day and has made three calls, one to his son, and two to secure diplomatic lines in DC. Gibbs thinks the numbers belong to the Chinese embassy. He tells Ziva to find Stephen and instructs McGee and Tony to return to the Gentry.\n\nBack on the ship, Tony is still trying to figure out what McGee is hiding. In addition to the computer monitors, McGee has also been having clandestine meetings in Vance’s office. McGee finally comes clean that Vance offered him a promotion as head of the cyber-division in Okinawa. Tony says everyone knows that and thinks McGee has to take the job. The last head of cyber works at Microsoft now. McGee asks why Tony is being so normal and sincere about this. He would prefer sarcasm. But he asks what he should do. Tony says to trust his gut, like Gibbs would.\n\nAt the Rose house, Ziva is waiting for the school bus. Stephen Rose exits the bus carrying a lacrosse stick. I’m not sure if Ziva can interview a seventeen-year old without an adult present, but the show gets around that by having Stephen attack her with his lacrosse stick when she approaches. That’s some grade-A paranoia right there. Useless too, since Ziva effortlessly ducks under the stick, puts Stephen in an arm lock and slams him into the car. She says, “I do not play lacrosse,” and a dumb line on paper sounds badass coming from Ziva. Stephen says his dad told him he had to protect himself from the Chinese.\n\nBack in the afterlife, Ann and Gibbs are talking outside the diner. The newspaper Gibbs is looking at is blank. Ann says it’s because he hasn’t decided how things will play out yet. She also takes the Franks line about decisions rippling into another but assures Gibbs it’s his boat to sail. The paper now says, “Injured NCIS agent kills suspect.” Gibbs says he hasn’t pulled the trigger yet. Ann agrees. And smiles. Gibbs says he wishes he’d known all this before and learned from it. She tells him that, like it or not, he made a difference in people’s lives. Certainly hers. She says she never wanted to leave him and asks whether he knows that. He says he does. She kisses his head, and we fade to break as they sit quietly on the bench together.\n\nGibbs is back at a dinner table, looking at the little jukebox. Now he’s sitting with NCIS agent-gone-bad Riley McCallister (Enemies Domestic, Episode 8.9), who asks about his music preferences. Gibbs asks if McCallister is the ghost of NCIS past. I mean, might as well hit the allusive nature of the plot head on, right? McCallister doesn’t want to be there, but says Gibbs invited him there. “I’m here because you need me.” Gibbs is skeptical he needs a crook and a murderer. McCallister calls that pots and kettles and Gibbs is done with the conversation. He gets up to leave when McAllister mentions Mexico. And Pedro Hernandez, the man who killed Gibbs’s family. McAllister says that Gibbs let his emotions get the better of him that day and calls it, “Damn foolish.”\n\nMcAllister asks for a quarter. Gibbs hands it over, and he plugs a big band tune into the juke box. Gibbs sarcastically asks if these are fond memories, and McCallister says at least he’s not haunted by his memories. McCallister offers a proposition. What if Gibbs didn’t pull the trigger? What if he didn’t kill Pedro Hernandez? We get a flashback of Gibbs, camouflaged, on the ridge, with his rifle, waiting for Hernandez. Hiatus, Part One, Episode 3.23. McCallister tells him to think about all the lies and asks him to imagine it never happening.\n\nIn this version, Hernandez rides by, in Gibbs’s sights, but Gibbs takes his finger off the trigger. He still rolls over and screams into the sky. But Hernandez is not dead.\n\nBack in the diner, Gibbs says he had to do it. McCallister says that killing Hernandez made Gibbs as bad as Hernandez. McCallister’s not saying it wasn’t warranted, but what’s just isn’t always right. And if it didn’t happen, Gibbs wonders. McCallister responds that Abby wouldn’t be carrying around the secret of a lifetime. We flashback to Abby telling Gibbs that she can bury the evidence she found of Gibbs’s crime. Borderland, Episode 7.22. Then, in the diner, Gibbs considers that maybe he did more harm than good. Gibbs asks where he’d be if he hadn’t done it. McCallister hesitates and Gibbs demands to know.\n\nHmmmm…maybe seventeen is old enough to be interviewed without a guardian. Because Gibbs has Stephen in the conference room. Stephen plays lacrosse and waits tables after school. Gibbs calls him an honest kid. Then he asks if Stephen’s dad is honest. Gibbs implies that Rose is selling secrets to the Chinese. Stephen denies it and defends his dad as a good man, but acknowledges that his dad got pulled in with some bad people. But Stephen doesn’t know their names. The why involves bankruptcy, foreclosure, and Stephen getting ready for college. But he swears his dad would never hurt anybody. Gibbs asks where Rose is. Stephen said he called last night and sounded scared and told Stephen to be careful. He thinks his father needs help and begs Gibbs to help.\n\nThe scene shifts to white, and then back to the diner, but we hear Gibbs’s daughter Kelly fearfully scream, “Daddy!” in the transition.\n\nBrrrrr.\n\nI can’t place anyone else in the next broad shot of the diner. I’m assuming these are all victims from various cases, although I don’t know if the show is using specific victims (and actors), or just the general kinds of victims the team investigates (using extras). Either way, at the end of the counter, having a cup of coffee is Pedro Hernandez. Gibbs sits and stares. Franks rejoins and tells Gibbs to stop embarrassing himself. Franks tells Gibbs it’s done and to let it go. Gibbs says he did what he thought was right. Franks says it was wrong, but it’s over. Gibbs asks about McCallister, and Franks is pissed “that opinionated jackass” even brought it up. Franks would also like to avoid telling Gibbs about the world where he didn’t kill Hernandez. But Gibbs angrily insists.\n\nFranks says that if Gibbs hadn’t shot Hernandez, it would have eaten him up. His demons would have taken over.\n\nWe shift to a rough looking, unshaven overweight Gibbs. He’s in his basement, looking for a drink and, when he finds one, takes it straight out the bottle. His team wanders down for an intervention. Well, Ducky, Abby, and McGee anyway. Per Ducky, it has been months since anyone has spoken to Gibbs. McGee calls Gibbs “Boss,” but Gibbs says he hasn’t been McGee’s boss in years. Abby notes that the boat is still present, and wonders what Gibbs has been working on. He identifies a rocker and a hope chest. Ducky would like to know what Gibbs is hoping for. Gibbs hopes to be left alone.\n\nThis world is similar to the other, because Kate has had a baby, and Gibbs missed the shower and the birth. But here, she had a girl, whereas in the other reality, she had a boy. She named her Kelly. Which feels like something you wouldn’t do in real life, but the show is going for heartstrings here. Abby and McGee are together in this world as well, and Abby says they’d love for Gibbs to come see their new place. Gibbs would like them all to leave, and he’s not nice about it. Ducky says Gibbs is missed, and suggests he stop thinking about himself and start thinking about the ones who love him. Abby hugs him, and Gibbs meanly asks if this is an intervention. When Abby says no, Gibbs tells them to get out. He doesn’t want their pity. Ducky approaches, but Gibbs won’t look at him. He asks, “What do you want?”\n\nIn the diner, Hernandez gets up and walks out. He nods at Gibbs on the way past. Then looks at him meaningfully before walking out the door.\n\nGibbs says, “I shot the son of a bitch, Mike. But when I got home, my house was empty. And my girls were still gone.”\n\nGibbs’s wheels are still turning. He says his mom mentioned Michael Rose and he wants to know why all this is coming up now. Franks says that folks do the wrong things for the right reason. He suggests that Gibbs and Rose aren’t so different.\n\nBack to the Gentry. McGee is following a K-9 corpsman and his dog. Clearly the team thinks Rose is on the ship. Gibbs, Tony, McGee, and Stephen are there. Vance called the Chinese Embassy and they denied ever getting any messages from Rose. Naturally.\n\nThe dog finds something. Gibbs smiles. He brings Stephen forward and they speak to Rose through a door. Stephen says he defended his father and that NCIS just wants to help. He begs his father to come out. Rose comes out with his hands up. He says he’ll tell them everything if they leave Stephen out of it.\n\nIn the afterlife, Gibbs picks the bullet up from the floor. A little girl walks up. She tells him he looks lost. Gibbs responds that she looks pretty smart. The girl says that her mom said they should help. Gibbs asks where her mom is and the little girl gestures to a booth. She leads Gibbs over to where Shannon Gibbs is sitting. They smile at each other. He asks if, “This little girl belongs to you.” “Yup,” Shannon replies. “Belongs to you too, I think.” Gibbs offers a tight-lipped smile, and the little girl tugs him into the booth. “Come on, Daddy. Sit.” He does and puts his arm around her. Shannon says, “We’ve been waiting for you.” Kelly is drawing a picture of a family. Gibbs asks if it’s for him. Kelly says, “It’s us again.”\n\nWe shift to Gibbs interrogating Rose. He shows him pictures of the victims and apprises him that Germaine just died in ICU. Which makes two dead and Rose’s Glock. Rose says he thought it would be easy. The three of them had a plan, the ship was in dry dock. The Chinese paid him. But as the date got closer, he realized he wasn’t just selling information. He was selling people’s safety. Rose says he tried to back out, but when he went to the ship to erase the hard drive the Chinese wanted, Petty Officer McCaffrey and Germaine were already there. That’s when the shooting started. Rose admits he killed them, but he claims it was self-defense. And in defense of the thousands of others who might have died if the Chinese got the information in question. Rose talks about needing the money. He says he was trying to save his family.\n\nBack in the diner, Gibbs slides Kelly’s drawing over to Shannon. Shannon smiles enigmatically. Gibbs slides it back to Kelly. Gibbs says he didn’t see this coming. Shannon figured it would happen eventually. Gibbs says that, seeing her here, he should not have let Shannon testify against Hernandez. Shannon says she wanted to help. Gibbs says he should have known better. Shannon says it wasn’t about him and Kelly echoes that it wasn’t his decision. Then Shannon drops the hammer: “If we hadn’t died, then you wouldn’t have joined NIS, and you wouldn’t have become an agent.” Gibbs says none of that mattered. Shannon says, “No Tony, no Ziva, no team.” “But I’d have had my girls,” Gibbs states. “I’d have had you.” Shannon’s not done. She says that if Gibbs had stayed a Marine, the loss would have fallen on them instead.\n\nWe move to Gibbs’s house. The nice version of Gibbs’s house where a someone has decorated and occasionally cleans. Shannon tells Kelly that dinner is almost ready and to go wash up. Like my kids, Kelly demands a few more minutes to continue with her activity. Shannon asks what her father would say if he were present. Kelly rolls her eyes (like my daughter) and responds in that diffident child tone, “He’d say, ‘Don’t mess with mess, young lady.’” Shannon says Gibbs will be back in the US in two weeks so she’d better get used to nagging party of two. Kelly laughs, but then there’s a knock at the door. Through the big window in Gibbs’s door, Shannon and Kelly see Marines in dress uniforms saluting her. We get a shot of Shannon’s feet and the floor as she drops a plate and it shatters.\n\nThen we’re back in the diner, on a shot of Gibbs’s and Shannon’s hands, close to each other on the table, but not touching. Then she grabs his fingers and asks him to think of all the cases and all the lives he’s touched. Gibbs says he wanted both, and that makes Kelly look like she’s about to cry. Shannon nods sympathetically but tells him it doesn’t work like that. Gibbs gives the thin-lipped smile again.\n\nAnd the scene shifts to Stephen in the conference room. Gibbs walks in and tells him to go home. Stephen asks if Gibbs can help. He says his father was just trying to do what’s right. Gibbs usually has a better approach with young people then this, but here he responds that there’s nothing right about killing two people. Stephen says good people do bad, irrational things sometimes. Then he says “You won’t help him will you, Agent Gibbs?” When Gibbs doesn’t respond, Stephen walks out.\n\nAnd now we’re back at the beginning. Gibbs enters the diner and Elaine serves him coffee while chatting about the big rig accident. They have the exact same conversation re: eggs and coffee and proposals. The person in the hood gets up, walks over, pulls his gun. Gibbs pulls his. We hear the heartbeat sound that pretty much every work of televised fiction uses for moments like this. As the two stand with their guns out, an unseen Franks monologues, “We all make choices.”\n\nGibbs doesn’t shoot. The gunman does. Gibbs takes a hit at the top of his right shoulder and flinches. The shooter is upset. We see it’s Stephen Rose. Franks intones, “It’s your decision. What’s it gonna be?” Gibbs raises his weapon again. But then he says Stephen’s name. And lowers his gun. Stephen does too, and two guys from the counter tackle him into a booth, securing the gun. Stephen sobs, “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“Guess you weren’t done yet, Probie,” says Franks. Gibbs looks over at a booth and sees the back of a head that looks like Franks’s. then he looks back at Stephen, still pinned in the booth and sobbing. He looks back up and the Franks figure is gone. The booth is empty. Then he grabs his shoulder and grimaces a little.\n\n…\n\n…\n\nAt NCIS HQ, McGee approaches Tony’s desk and Tony asks if McGee has something to tell him. Like everyone else on this show (and all ensemble shows like this), McGee will not be taking the amazing promotion opportunity. He thinks there’s more good he can accomplish right where he is.\n\nMcGee teammates are pleased, even if Tony razzes him about making a mistake. McGee thinks he doesn’t want to miss out on the goings-on around NCIS. And just like that, Gibbs walks in and tells them to grab their gear. Ziva and Tony offer to do the crime scene themselves in light of Gibbs’s injury. Gibbs says he’s good. McGee notes Gibbs’s traumatic day the day before. Gibbs says, “My choice. I wouldn’t have it any other way.” They all nod and smile at each other while the soft piano theme plays.\n\nThe agents head to the elevator, but Gibbs stops to look back at the squad room. He smiles a tiny smile. It’s a good life. Good enough.\n\nQuotables: We covered it upstairs.\n\nZiva-propisms: Ziva says McGee’s expression looks “Somewhere between melancholy and constipation.” Tony thinks she meant, “Consternation.” But she stands by it.\n\nTony Awards: The Gibbs Show pre-empted the Tony Awards this episode.\n\nAbby Road: Abby is helping Palmer’s obliques. Wonder how Breena, Palmer’s wife, feels about that.\n\nMcNicknames: McAnal Probie. McDevious. McShe. McGee-san.\n\nDucky Tales: No time for any of that.\n\nThe Rest of the Story:\n\n-I’m solitary by nature, but at the tail-end of the pandemic, I found myself a tad wistful at the idea of being able to regularly go into a restaurant, make small talk with the staff, and just sit for a minute.\n\n-The structure of this tale, at least initially, is a callback to Swan Song, Episode 8.23, where Ghost Franks asked Gibbs to flashback and recap how they got to where they ended up.\n\n-I said in the Twilight write-up that I never bought Tony and Kate as a couple. That hasn’t changed.\n\n-Franks calling Gibbs the catalyst is good and meta. For everything NCIS is, it’s ultimately the story of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.\n\n-Palmer is surprisingly ripped. I guess Brian Dietzen wanted to show off all his hard work. Or one of the actors or writers saw him in the gym and thought, “Holy shit, let’s work that into an episode.”\n\n-I have to wonder: in a world where Kate lives, how does Vance make his way to the director’s chair? Does Shepard not get the job at all? You’d figure she already had it before Kate died, but maybe Director Morrow was going to hang on to the position until an agent dying in the line of duty made clear that he was going to have to start showing up at the office.\n\nAnd in a world where Kate lives, Tony’s sting on Jeanne Benoit (see all of Season 4) plays out very differently. Can Shepard even run it? Does the lack of access to Le Grenouille’s daughter temper her hunt for the arms dealer and make it less Captain Ahab-like?\n\nIn the interrogation room scene with Ziva, Tony sure didn’t move like a man whose director got killed in a firefight on his watch in Judgment Day, Part One, Episode 5.18. Shepard was terminal when she died. Maybe she died in bed and Vance got the job without bloodshed. Based on Tony’s remarks the scene with Ziva is clearly years after the events of Kill Ari, Parts One and Two, Episodes 3.1 and 3.2\n\nWhat? It’s fun to overthink.\n\n-There’s a difference between a choice and a choke. One you can make peace with, and one will destroy you. As we saw here in the universe where Gibbs did not kill Pedro Hernandez.\n\n-The team seems more passive in the basement intervention scene than they usually are when confronting Gibbs. We’re left to assume that years of dealing with the broken version of Gibbs has altered their behavior.\n\n-It’s a super-bummer that the there’s no universe where Gibbs and Shannon and Kelly get to live out their lives together. But it’s also good, poignant story-telling.\n\n-Tony also turned down a promotion to keep hanging out with his pals. Singled Out, Episode 4.3.\n\n-Per IMDB, NCIS Special Agent Chris Pacci made it into the background of this episode. He was killed in action in Dead Man Talking, Episode 1.19. I didn’t see him in the diner, but I think his dead body in autopsy appears in the first mega-flashback.\n\n-Because he’s tougher than we are, Gibbs keeps going to this diner. It becomes a recurring setting on the show. Elaine the waitress also shows up semi-regularly.\n\nCasting Call: Ann Gibbs is played by Clare Carey. She looks familiar because she played Kelly, Hayden Fox’s daughter, on Coach 20+ years ago.\n\nMan, This Show Is Old: Tony makes jokes about McGee having a sex change operation. That would probably draw a boycott today.\n\nMVP: Probably Shannon and Kelly. Gibbs was never really going to listen to Franks.\n\nRating: On the one hand, “This is Your Life Leroy Jethro Gibbs!” has been done to death in fiction. Similarly, the notion that all the bad stuff that happens in a person’s life moves them to a place where they’re meant to be is almost trite at this point. But, to the first point, I can’t deny the sheer amount of work that the show put into this episode. And to the second, it’s trite because it’s true. At least in my experience. Most of the time, when I think about a regret in my life, imagining the alternate universe where the bad thing didn’t happen usually leaves me in an imaginary universe where a lot of good things in my life also didn’t happen. Maybe I’m just lucky/privileged, and I’m certainly not about to trot out, “Everything happens for a reason,” or “You’ll look back on this and be happy it happened” to anyone experiencing genuine grief or trauma. But, for purposes of my own life, and the purposes of this write-up, I’d be one hell of a hypocrite if I tried to shit all over this episode’s core message.\n\nMetaphysical themes aside and purely from the standpoint of episodic television, it’s a wonderful episode. Pun entirely intended. We get to see a lot of old friends. We get to see Gibbs experience some much-needed therapy, if not closure. And the whole dream sequence fit with an existing case, and in a way that wasn’t clunky, preachy, or awkward. Like the rug in The Big Lebowski, this one really ties the squad room together. Fitting work for the show’s 200th episode.\n\nWhat exactly happened? I have no idea. It was more an in-the-moment hallucination, and not the classic near-death-experience that usually presages these kind of visions. But either way, the episode did what it set out to do and both moved and entertained me while doing it.\n\nAnd that, folks, is worth ten Palmers.\n\nNext Time: Super-heroes. Real life super-heroes. Seriously. Also, Wendy, Tony’s ex.\n\nShameless Plugs:\n\n-A Year of NCIS has a Facebook page now.
