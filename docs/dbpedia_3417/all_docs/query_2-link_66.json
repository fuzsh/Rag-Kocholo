        "text": "Courtly Life (all season)\n\nYou’re invited to rub elbows with your noble cousins in the Nobles’ Glade all day, every Faire day! Highlights include…\n\nPresent the Nobility: First impressions are everything. Will the nobles meet with Her Majesty’s approval this day?\n\nMusic & Dance: Before taking their meal, the court works up an appetite with music – the food of love! Witness the stately dances and the swirl of jewels as the nobles woo one another on the dance floor.\n\nCourt Feast: Bring your lunch and join us for a picnic in the shady glade. We’ll provide the finest entertainment for Her Majesty and you, her guests!\n\nThe Queens Privy Council was a group of government officials she appointed along with great magistrates (peers) who could not be ignored. And a few favorites. They did the work of government in the Queen’s name and when the queen would leave London to go on progress they were expected to follow. Come join us to see what business will be presented to the queen while on progress to Bristol.\n\nMo Leannán (all season)\n\nThe Bristol-native Irish Folk Duo, Mo Leannán, is back! Our aim is to bring the cráic while sharing traditional Irish tunes with our audiences. Tunes that will make you get JIG-gy with it in the lanes, which is sure to be a REEL good time. So don’t be afraid to WALTZ right over and take a POLKA at dancing or clapping along! We may even brush off our PIPES and sing a few tunes as well. That’s all for our trad music puns (for now). Join us for the merriment, won’t you?\n\nPRESHOW WITH ODORFERIOUS THUNDERBOTTOM – FRONT GATE (ALL SEASON)\n\nStart your day at the fair, BEFORE the faire with the preshow provided by Bristol’s “Keeper of the Privies.” Audience participation is just the thing to set the right tone for a wonderful day at the faire, and Odorferious Thunderbottom (aka “OTB”)’s just the thing to get you started. Watch as contestants are put through their paces in a series of challenges that only the mind of a Thunderbottom could provide. Come down to the show before the show!\n\nRenQuest (all season)\n\nRenQuest™ is a game full of thoughtful and fun challenges, a story where you are the hero, and a place where the epic legends of King Arthur’s Court live on during Queen Elizabeth’s Renaissance. A rift to the Sylvan Realm has opened and we need brave adventurers to explore these new lands!\n\nGameplay is $20 and recommended for ages 12 and up (but we’ve had players as young as 8 with accompanying parents). Sign up at the RenQuest™ Red Vardo, located near the Cheshire Chase stage on your Faire map. Tickets are available from 11:30 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. every Faire day."
