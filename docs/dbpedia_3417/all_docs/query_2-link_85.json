        "text": "For the last four years, I've served on the CEVA Board of Directors on top of my full time job. This role was a volunteer position - one that I approached with passion and dedication. We've had so many accomplishments over that time, both from the organization and board, and I'm so honored to have served. While I'll miss being on the board, I'm excited to look for new opportunities to serve in leadership. Below is the message sent to region prior to my term ending. So proud to have been a part of it. #servantleadership #boardservice Columbia Empire Volleyball Association\n\nToday marks my 6th year anniversary of working at Nike, a dream I started pursuing 20 years ago. I can't even remember the sheer number of applications I put in over the years and when I finally got a job at WHQ, it was sheer luck (and some unexpected work experience) that got me in the door. I'm very thankful for the time I've had here. It's the first time I've felt I'm able to show up authentically as myself - the inner athlete who can't let go of sports! As we embrace the next round of layoffs in the coming weeks, I am reminded that even in the hardest times I've faced, it led to something amazing I could have never expected! And while I hope I get to leave Nike on my own terms in the future, I'll leave with my head high no matter the outcome.\n\nMy new favorite shirt. . . The little girl that grew up loving basketball feels so... seen. The number of times I've argued with men who said women can't play is too many to count. So much, that nothing pisses me off faster. And nothing sets my soul on fire more than stepping on a court to play. I'm old and slow but anytime I play, I feel whole again. . To the next generation - to my friends with little girls and boys, I'm so glad your kids get to witness this. We got to see the launch of things like the WNBA but your kids get to see stadiums sold out to see women play. Their hardwork, determination and love for the sport gets to be the story. And that little girl deep down is jealous.\n\nStepping into my final year on the CEVA Board of Directors as President is exciting and somewhat unnerving. My goal is, as always, to leave things better than I've found them and I hope my work over the last three years is a testament to my ability to this. Things I've worked to implement over the last three years: - New board recruitment policies, reference checks, interview processes - Establish board KPI's including but not limited to philanthropic events generating funds into the scholarship funds - Creating board culture of accountability and action, dedicated to growth and collaboration in the region - Establishing a community of adult volleyball players with a path for youth players to continue playing once they've aged out of club - Continue to set DEI as a priority in conversations about decision making for the region and board - Be an advocate for staff and build relationships with other regions, creating opportunities to learn and grow - Provide board education and onboarding for oncoming board members - Update election processes for executive positions to ensure interest and availability to serve in positions It's been a busy three years but worth it! This last year will hopefully be one for the books!\n\nExcited to announce that I will be the next board President for Columbia Empire Volleyball Association! I have been working hard over the last three years - two as the Vice President - to bring culture change, collaboration and a work ethic to the board to serve our region of Oregon and SW Washington. While this is the last year I serve as I term out, I am ready to make this one the best one yet!\n\nWe had our first sitting volleyball session on Friday night and it was so much fun! Thank you to Adapt Sports NW for letting us be a part of kicking off volleyball! And thank you to CEVA Board member Kindell Souders and Axiom Volleyball Club for letting us use their space. Looking forward to the next one! USA Volleyball Columbia Empire Volleyball Association #sittingvolleyball #volleyball #adaptivesportsnw #adaptiveathletes #usavolleyball\n\nFree sitting volleyball drop in is here! One of my biggest passions is figuring out how to give back to the community through the things that I love the most - sports! Providing inclusive options for all to play and opportunities to showcase incredible athletes is always top of my list and I'm so thankful to be a part of an amazing volleyball community. In the words of Nike, \"If you have a body, you're an athlete\". So - Just Do It ;) #sports #opportunities #community #volleyball #sittingvolleyball #usavolleyball #columbiaempirevolleyballassociation #bridgevolleyballcrew https://lnkd.in/gYWKkyRT for more info :)"
