        "text": "Drake’s Legendary “Laugh Now Cry Later” And His Roaring 2020’s\n\n2020 witnessed a series of extraordinary events that had a profound impact on the global stage. While some individuals experienced significant losses within a short span, others found solace and prosperity in solitude. The music industry, particularly in terms of social gatherings like concerts and festivals, encountered setbacks. However, this did not deter prolific artists like Drake from thriving. In fact, 2020 proved to be a remarkable year for Mr. Graham, marked by the release of his 14-track mixtape “Dark Lanes Demo Tapes,” numerous collaborations, and captivating music videos.\n\nOne such video that caught my attention was “Popstar,” where Justin Bieber’s impeccable style, the innovative yet familiar concept, and the humorous storyline created an enthralling experience. If you haven’t had the chance to watch it, I highly recommend doing so.\n\nSpeaking of Drake’s solo endeavors, his video for “Laugh Now Cry Later” also struck a chord with me. If you haven’t seen it yet, I urge you to stop procrastinating and check it out right away. Allow me to provide you with a brief overview of what I like to call his triumphant music video of 2020.\n\nThe video begins with an aerial shot of the Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Drake arrives in an opulent-looking BMW, specifically the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet, and later the Coupe in a vibrant red. Now, if you’re unfamiliar with these vehicles, don’t worry—I’m in the same boat. Let me break it down for you. These are not your run-of-the-mill Mercedes cars; they are actually concept cars unveiled by German manufacturers three years ago. With only approximately 10 of them in existence worldwide, Drake’s possession of two of these remarkable automobiles remains somewhat ambiguous. Nonetheless, he drops substantial hints that if they were available for purchase, they would undoubtedly occupy his driveway.\n\nShortly after Drake’s impressive car display, we witness him engaging in a basketball game with the renowned NBA player Kevin Durant. While Drake manages to sink a shot from the three-point line, Durant unmistakably reminds us who the true professional athlete is. Throughout the video, Drake showcases his acting skills in a light-hearted manner, particularly towards the end, where we see him shedding tears, only to be playfully reminded by his friend to save that for later.\n\nAdditionally, we observe Drake tossing the ball around with NFL wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., only to be tackled by Marshawn Lynch, an NFL running back. Drake not only lives out his obvious dream of being a pro-athlete but also presents us with legendary moments in this video. Whether it’s the elusive Mercedes concept cars, shopping in the exclusive Nike company store accompanied by a stunning companion, or working out with professional athletes in Nike’s private elite sports-science lab, Drake demonstrates his ability to have it all. Undeniably one of the industry’s biggest names, Drake’s success is indisputable, and he reinforces this notion through a series of iconic visuals worth mentioning.\n\nNot only does Drake rub shoulders with celebrities, engage in sports, and amass a collection of Nike merchandise, but he also recreates two unforgettable scenes: boxing underwater and donning an oversized white suit. You might wonder why these scenes matter. Well, I’m glad you asked. Both instances pay homage to legendary figures during their defining moments. The underwater boxing scene references the famous 1961 photograph of Muhammed Ali, who claimed to have trained underwater at the time. Although the truth is that his trainer merely suggested water-based training due to the resistance it provides.\n\nLast but certainly not least, with a flawless feature from Lil Durk and a laid-back yet lively vibe, Drake proudly showcases his Canadian Raptors cap while rocking an oversized white suit. This pays homage to LeBron James’ draft suit during the 2003 NBA draft season. LeBron was among several players who embraced the baggy and oversized fashion trend of that era. In an interview with Business Insider, Dwayne Wade stated, “We were in a baggy era. I’m talking about pants-on-the-ground era, you know, where they’re dragging.”\n\nAll in all, I found myself thoroughly entertained, impressed, and admittedly a tad envious while vibing with this music video. It is undoubtedly worth a watch. Despite the mellower tone of the song, I believe that was precisely Drake’s intention. It serves as his legendary victory lap, casually surpassing the competition. You can’t stroll to a club banger, but you can definitely groove to this song, embracing a chill yet confident vibe. There’s more to come from Drake this year, with the highly anticipated release of his “Certified Lover Boy” album in the fall. And who knows, a potential collaboration between Drake and Nike for exclusive merchandise might be in the works?"
