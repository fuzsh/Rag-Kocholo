        "text": "The pod isn't dead, Charlie and Martin just do it as the Classified Podcast, where go search it and subscribe! It's the same show! We literally do it once a week and just chill and search us on YouTube, as well! An episode or two will be posted here until we fully transition!\n\nWe recorded this a couple days before Thanksgiving, it was a little hard to find a guest in town, so instead Martin brought his roomate's, our past guest Sandi Beaton, dog, Poptart. Poptart was not too interested in being on the show and was way more interested in exploring the house. We still have a good time and get ready for the holiday season!\n\nThis episode we might get kinda dark, but we still have a good time with guest, Liza Banks! There's a lot of death and assassin talk, we try to lighten the mood after awhile though. It was a good time! Check it out!\n\nWe're back again....way earlier than last time! We had on comedian, friend, Reed Kelly! Of course, we make the R. Kelly reference early on and chill the rest of the time. The episode is a little long, but it's just us hanging and having a good time. Won't you join us?\n\nWe've been gone for two months, but now we're back with comic and Martin's roommate, Winston Hodges! Listen about the time Winston walked out of a pod recording, the time Martin was so scared of him he avoided Winston for three days, weird food things we do, and more! Winston's album Already Aware drops November 12th! Listen to this and that!\n\nWhat is going on? It's a lot. I sat down with comedian/writer Alex Barbag and his wife, Amanda, and they have a lot going on. What exactly? Listen and find out...it's nothing crazy!\n\nWe did this last year, so we invited back our friend, fellow comic and show film critic, Leroy Furious, to make predictions for the winners of this year's Oscars. Last year he predicted a lot of winners, we'll see how he does this year! We also go off topic, talk a lot about the Fat and the Furious and watched a video of Martin bombing for forty minutes....but not all the forty! Good show, fun times, check it out!\n\nThis episode isn't just about DMX, friend/comic, Rudy Mulamba is the guest to promote his new pod 'The Albums That Made Us' and him and Martin mainly talk about DMX....but they also discuss white boy summer, who Teddy Roosevelt really was, and more! Listen to this and Rudy's podcast!\n\nOn the show this episode we do another power hour the day after St. Patrick's Day with Christine O'Dea and Tyler Simpson. Christine was in person and Tyler was virtual and it was all fun. Check out the pod Christine and Tyler do, Quick Time Gals, and check out this episode. We're all drunk, so you know it's fun!\n\nThe pod is back with guest Adrian Rodney! We talk about playing flag football, Wu-tang and the mathematics, we listen to an old mix CD of Martin's which turns out to be the most random mix ever, and more! It's a good time! Great ep!\n\nOn this episode we have a person who works in comedy, not stand up, but as an artist. Brian from Comedy Artwork has drawn posters, album covers, special covers, and logos for local talent and big names like Shane Gillis, Dan Soder, and more! Find out how he got involved, who he works with, we review Ted Cruz's 'comedy set', and more! It's a good ep!\n\nWe're back with another ep! Our guest is Pete Bergen! We talk about his improv background, his growing up and having a club about people hating him, we recorded this on Valentine's Day so we take a compatibility test. Listen to find out if Martin, Charlie, and Pete are meant to be with one another!\n\nIt's a virtual episode with just Martin and guest Ambi Narula! She's super nice, relatively new, and her name is like Bambi except without the B, We get to know her more and because her name is close to the deer's, we see how much she knows about deer! It was a nice, fun sow!\n\nOn this episode of the pod we read a dramatization of a children's script of A Christmas Carol that is in the public domain. We have an ensemble cast reading it. If you love the story, listen, and relive it with our recording! God bless you all!!\n\nThis year for Christmas we sit down and watch the holiday Jack Frost. No, not the Michael Keaton, the one with the scary holographic cover in Blockbuster that's about a serial killer who gets in a crash with genetic material and becomes a killer snowman. We have friend/comic/podcaster Nathan Luft with us to commentate. You basically listen and watch with us! If you have never seen this movie you should, it's a classic!\n\nDuring the holiday season you reconnect with friends and family, this season Martin brings on frequent guest, one of his best friends, Matt Eisenberg. He has the most appearances than any other guest! He moved this summer. It's been awhile, so Martin and Matt talk about their usual, Star Wars, Adam Sandler, and go over Chanukah. It's basically two friends catching up, so if you're into that this is for you!\n\nIt was just Martin on this episode, Charlie had class; lame, right?! Shelley Kim was the guest! She does comedy and DJs. Martin and Shelley just kick it and discuss raves, dance music, Shelley's new found success on TikTok, white people, get dark, the Benny the Butcher concert Martin went to, In-n-Out Burger, and more! It was a fun conversation! Good ep!\n\nWe're back with Martin, Charlie, producer Graham, and our guest, producer/comic Mike Kurtz! Mike puts on outdoor shows throughout the city and was one of the first producers to do so. We discuss how bringing comedy back started, the future of comedy, being blind or deaf, stuff in the past, and because his show productions are called Cry Baby DC, we try to make Mike cry....by having him literally chop onions. He even puts them in his eyes! Did it work? Listen now to this fantastic episode!\n\nWe're back....kinda! Nothing actually happened to stop the pod, we just kinda were not feeling it for a bit. But we brought back for our friend, comedian Winston Hodges! Winston has a new special out he put together himself called Grieving Productively. The special is about how he handled and the experience of his father's sudden death. It's a serious subject, but as the title is called it's about grieving productively and laughter is on of them. We talk about death a lot, our own, family and friends, we reference jokes in the special, we play a game about death, and still are able to talk about The Bachelorette! This episode sounds dark, but it's actually a solid time. Check it out and check out Winston's special on youtube.\n\nThat's right we've made it to 100 episodes! This podcast, Martin Podcast, Martin Show, Comic's Corner, we've been here 100 times! We had an opened zoom link and tried to get 100 guests for the occasion. We ended up having 18....which included 4 dogs. We saw a couple new faces, some new ones, but all were friends and supportive! It was historical, kinda. We've enjoyed doing this for so long.\n\nThis isn't the last episode of the pod, but last episode with our dear friend, Matt Eisenberg. He's moving! He's become somewhat known for being on this podcast. We discuss our usual topics - Star Wars, classic rock, old memories - Matt says his goodbyes and we end the episode with me chasing a rabbit! It was a quality, appropriate goodbye!\n\nThat's right, this Mother's Day, the guest is Martin's Mom, Rolande Phillips! Hear all about her life, from her unique name, career working intelligence for the Air Force during the Cold War, being a breast cancer survivor, how she feels about her son being a comedian, and more! We all learn a lot! Remember to call your mom!\n\nOur Zoom time ran out, but we still had a good show with guest Chris Alan! We talk about how we are all look now in quarantine, the Jordan doc, I go through my rap CD collection and we have hip hop talk, and more! It ends a bit abruptly, still a fine time though!\n\nOn this show we have the person with the most energy, Brock Snyder! He's a comedian and runs 4 Corners Entertainment, that puts on events in apartment buildings; events, like comedy shows! His wife and friend of the show, Kylie joined him! We see how they are doing and how his company ha adapted during this pandemic. We go all over all the crazy times at his apartment shows including one at an amusement park and just have a fun, crazy time!\n\nThis week we have on comedian and friend Nicole Walkow. During this whole pandemic and not during the pandemic, she works at a grocery store! She's on the front lines and people think she's a hero, which might a little much, Nicole thinks. Listen to her grocery store experience now, what else she's been doing, Charlie's here, and Martin gets in trouble for being too loud at his parents house! It's a fun time!\n\nMaybe this episode isn't a super surprise, but last week Martin and Charlie met in an undisclosed location, kept their distance, had masks on, and followed all safety precautions to record this episode. It's Martin and Charlie, chilling, discussing important current matters, like how great driving on the road is during quarantine, everyone's favorite show Tiger King, Andre the seal, and who can do the most push-ups. We probably won't meet up like this for awhile, enjoy this now!\n\nWe're still recording using Skype, however, with this technology we can have any guest anywhere! On this show we have Martin's dear friend, Rudy Mulamba, who lives in Florida, but has been on before. Rudy talks about his past online radio show, Virginia comedy beefs, Martin's first rap group, Sexy Three Dudes, STD for short, Martin reads their song 'Straight Outta Yorktown', and more! It's a good time!\n\nBefore the quarantine, our friend and comic, Alex Barbag left town to go on a road trip with his wife. The timing was a little suspicious. Is his road trip still going on? Well we found in Florida at his parents' house. The road trip is on pause. We all discuss where we at and what we're planning on doing when this is all over. We mainly just chill. Everyone is basically chilling. I'm sure you can relate. We're all good though, hope everyone else is too!\n\nNothing can stop The Martin Podcast! We're not some new podcast created during the quarantine, we've been here for years! Due to the current climate we actually recorded via Skype, which is something we could have done this whole time! Our guest was Von Mychael! He just dropped his first comedy special that is available online at vonmychael.com for only $5! If you're unemployed or sick, it's free! We talk about the special, where we're all at and how each of us is doing, Von being on the road, his military service, interesting stories with his dad, and more! It was great and Charlie cooks most of the time! We can do anything! Nothing can stop us! We're in this together!\n\nIn these times we live in, there is one thing we need more than ever right now...that's right, podcasts! We're back with an episode, at least for this week! Clara Steiner is our guest! She's been on before, but with other guests and when we did a power hour, this episode all about her! We talk about the 'roni' and drink coronas to try to combat it. We go over dreams and improv and more. Most of you at home or should be, this is a fun listen!\n\nKasha Patel was our first guest ever and now she's back! A lot has changed with our show, but we're still the same, pretty much! Kasha works in science so we did a lot of science based things like trying the Pavlov bell experience, Martin drank expired milk, Kasha talks about going to Antarctica, we try to figure out the science behind X-Men, we listen to a song about the water cycle that is lit af, and more!! It's a good, somewhat educational time!\n\nWhen Jenny Questell was on the show in the fall, we recorded at the library and then the recorders' batteries died so then they went to Martin's apartment to finish up. She was disappointed and wanted the full Martin Podcast experience, so she's back with Charlie, Graham the producer, in the nice place in the DC, we made up for last time! We talk about Martin and Jenny's podcast, Rose' and Thorns, Martin's therapy exercises, Jenny's DJ ex-boyfriend, read a Martin poem everyone hates, and more! It's a better time!\n\nOur guest this a great local funny comedian in our parts, Matt Dundas, but is actually moving to Maine soon! Portland! Before that he sat down with us and we talk about Maine and where we're from, moose and the Maine moose lottery, baseball, greyhound buses, and bring back our fav character, The Corny Cuck! A lot happens. You're going to love him New England!\n\nThe Oscars are in six days, that's why on this episode of the pod, we welcome our friend, comedian, Martin Podcast film critic, Leroy Furious! We go over all the major categories, pick who we will like, who'll probably win, who got snubbed like Kevin Garnett in Uncut Gems, discuss how Brad Pitt is the coolest guy ever to live, question why it's called Marriage Story when it's mainly about divorce, wonder how many awards Sonic the Hedgehog will get next year, and more! If you need a guide for this award ceremony, we got you!\n\nWhat is our guest the greatest of all time at? I'm not too sure myself, but he is a great friend of mine! Matt Eisenberg returns! He has the most appearances of anybody on this show! Maybe Matt doesn't do comedy as much lately; he's still a fun guest! I want to make him known for this show! Matt makes a big personal announcement, we talk a lot about classic rock (Matt's jam), and play rock n' roll/goat Jeopardy...not greatest of all time, but actual goats. It was a fun time with a good friend!"
