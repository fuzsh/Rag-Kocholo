        "text": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - The new judge in Young Thug’s internationally watched criminal trial wasted no time Tuesday morning in getting down to business, denying two defense motions for a mistrial and rejecting a request from Fulton County prosecutors to limit defense attorneys’ ability to speak to the media.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Paige Reese Whitaker also rejected consideration of another bond request from Young Thug’s attorney Brian Steel.\n\nWhitaker began day 102 of on-the-record proceedings in Young Thug’s trial promptly at 8:45 a.m., a far cry from when the trial’s previous judge, Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Ural Glanville, was presiding, when court times were set at 9 a.m. but often didn’t begin until much later in the morning.\n\nOn Tuesday the state made it clear where they stand on the historically long trial.\n\n“Let’s just keep it rolling because the state vehemently objects to a mistrial,” said Fulton County prosecutor Adriane Love.\n\nDefense attorney Max Schardt took time Tuesday to tell Judge Whitaker that while he is not moving for a mistrial on behalf of his client, co-defendant Shannon Stillwell, he has extreme doubts about the ability of this case to move forward.\n\n“This trial is completely broken. It’s broken. There is error in this trial that would never survive appellate review,” said Schardt.\n\nWhitaker said she would rule on some of the defense attorneys’ other motions Wednesday or later in the week, including a request to disqualify two Fulton County prosecutors who held a private meeting with Glanville and a reluctant key witness.\n\nWhitaker also responded to claims of unprofessional conduct against Fulton County Assistant Chief District Attorney Adriane Love by admonishing the prosecutor to keep her comments appropriate and professional.\n\nWhitaker was assigned the trial only hours after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram recused herself, less than a day after she’d been assigned to it. Ingram had been assigned to the case after Judge Rachel Krause recused Glanville from the trial.\n\nIngram said she could not preside over the trial because a former deputy assigned to her courtroom allegedly had an inappropriate affair with Christian Eppinger, one of Young Thug’s co-defendants who has since been severed from the trial.\n\nDuring a status hearing on July 19, Whitaker urged prosecutors and attorneys to maintain decorum. She also ruled that food and earbuds would not be allowed in her courtroom, where her hours are 8:45 a.m. until 5 p.m.\n\nLast week, Steel and fellow defense attorney Keith Adams argued Young Thug – whose real name is Jeffery Williams – is not a flight risk, poses no threat to the community, nor is he a risk to commit a felony while out on bond or intimidate witnesses.\n\nAttorneys for co-defendants Donavan Thomas, Quamarvious Nichols and Deamonte Kendrick had also filed motions for mistrial.\n\nLove had filed a response to the rapper’s attorneys objecting to Glanville’s June 10, 2024, ex parte meeting, which ultimately led to his recusal.\n\nThat meeting included Love and another Fulton County prosecutor, star prosecution witness Kenneth Copeland (aka Woody or Lil’ Woody) and his stand-in attorney, Kayla Bumpus. The legal term ex parte, translated from Latin as “out of the party,” refers to a decision made by a judge without requiring all parties in a dispute to be present.\n\nWhitaker is expected to issue a ruling on that matter on Wednesday.\n\nOn June 7, 2024, Copeland himself was jailed for refusing to testify. Copeland is widely believed to have informed police of alleged crimes committed by Young Thug and the alleged YSL gang. By the following Monday, Copeland had changed his tune and agreed to testify.\n\nThen Glanville ordered Steel to be held in contempt after Steel told Glanville, in open court, he had learned of the meeting, which was held without any other defense attorneys’ knowledge or forewarning. Glanville demanded to know how Steel had learned of that meeting, and Steel refused to disclose his source. That’s when Glanville ordered Steel arrested.\n\nGlanville’s contempt ruling against Steel has since been suspended by the Supreme Court of Georgia. Glanville eventually released that meeting’s timeline and transcript. Glanville was eventually recused by Judge Rachel Krause.\n\nFor months, defense attorneys for Young Thug and his co-defendants have been making motions for a mistrial, claiming Glanville was biased against them and their efforts to prove Young Thug is not the head of a criminal gang known as YSL (Young Slime Life or Young Stoner Life).\n\nProsecutors, on the other hand, wanted Glanville to remain as judge, as evidenced by their responses to defense attorneys’ efforts.\n\nWhitaker herself has also laid down some new rules for the sprawling organized crime-related trial, which has been plagued by arrests, delays, late starting times and other bizarre antics and shouting matches.\n\nWilliams was arrested on May 9, 2022, along with 27 other suspected gang members in Buckhead as part of a 56-count indictment. The trial’s jury selection lasted longer than any other in Georgia history, and actual witness testimony itself will likely surpass state records. Both records were set by the Atlanta Public Schools teacher scandal and trial of 2014-15.\n\nThe trial itself began on Nov. 27, 2023. Defense attorneys have repeatedly raised concerns that the trial could go on for years based on the number of witnesses the state plans to introduce.\n\nProsecutors are attempting to show YSL is a criminal street gang responsible for numerous offenses. Defense attorneys say YSL is not a gang but simply the name of a record label.\n\nYoung Thug himself is facing eight criminal counts under a federal law originally enacted to fight organized crime. Georgia is one of 33 states with its own RICO law, but in the Peach State, the alleged criminal enterprises do not have to have existed as long as the federal law.\n\nAtlanta News First is broadcasting gavel-to-gavel coverage of Young Thug’s trial on ANF+ live stream and YouTube channel, and on Roku, Fire TV and AppleTV.\n\nWilliams is also charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of codeine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, possession of a firearm and possession of a machine gun.\n\nDownload our Atlanta News First app for the latest details on Young Thug’s historic trial."
