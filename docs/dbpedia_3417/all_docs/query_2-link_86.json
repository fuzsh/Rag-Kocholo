        "text": "Drake has been nominated for a pair of Grammy Awards for his Lil Durk-assisted single, “Laugh Now, Cry Later.”\n\nThe song is nominated in Best Melodic Rap Performance, for a solo or collaborative performance containing both elements of R&B melodies and rap, and Best Rap Song, which is songwriter’s award.\n\nDrake also picked up a nomination with Future in the Best Music Video director category for their collaboration “Life Is Good.”\n\nAlong with the artists, the Best Music Video is awarded to a music video’s director, and producer, meaning Canadian directors Director X and Harv Glazer are also nominated. Notably, the video has a whopping 1.2 billion views on YouTube to date.\n\nAside from rolling out the nominees—which included accidentally crediting Jack Harlow’s “What’s Poppin” to Luke James in the live nomination ceremony—the Grammys are trending right now because of who was left out.\n\nOne of the biggest snubs is The Weeknd who has zero nominations, despite having the biggest hit of the year. TMZ has already released a story suggesting why he was overlooked. According to their “sources familiar with the situation,” the snub came as a result of Abel choosing to perform at Super Bowl LV 2021 instead of the Grammys.\n\n“It’s unclear why the Grammys would play such hardball in trying to exclusively book him for their airwaves. It might be fear of duplicate performances, as CBS is airing the award show AND the game one week apart in February. Still, our sources tell us Abel and co. feel the dispute might have something to do with his exclusion.”\n\nOverall, the top nominees for the 63rd Grammy Awards include hip-hop artists Roddy Ricch and Megan Thee Stallion, as well as Beyoncé, Dua Lipa, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Canadian Justin Bieber.\n\nAdvertisement.
