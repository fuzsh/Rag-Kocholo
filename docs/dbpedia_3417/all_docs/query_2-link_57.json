        "text": "There’s a level of superstardom where the only person who can knock you down is yourself. By now, Drake has heard it all: the goopy sentimentalist, the craven opportunist, the style-biter, the child-hider. None of that matters, each shot only makes him stronger, bigger. A diss doesn’t wound him anymore, it adds another layer of Drake that looks exactly like the hundreds of Drakes underneath it, an infinite Canadian matryoshka doll who makes you laugh and makes you cry while wearing a wet beard, a wide grin, and a $750,000 “I’d Love To Kiss Your Pussy” watch. So when Kevin Durant slaps the ball out of Drake’s face and Marshawn Lynch snatches Drake’s life away on the football field, it’s the kind of self-effacing superstar move that delights absolutely everyone—Drake included. It’s part of what makes “Laugh Now, Cry Later” one of the lightest and breeziest Drake songs to come out in a while.\n\nWhile the video for the single is its own glossy blend of Nike ad, luxury porn, and athlete cameos (note his send-up of LeBron’s NBA Draft night photo), the song itself plays like if his 2014 song “Trophies” just, you know, chilled out a bit. The muted synth horn line sets a mood of triumph not as a sudden achievement but as a foregone conclusion, and Drake just skates in with a flute of champagne. Sometimes he’s effortlessly cool and simple, like that wonderful “baby” that peppers the song; sometimes it’s a long walk to a good bit: “Distance between us is not like a store/This isn’t a closeable Gap.” Lil Durk shows up as a perfect counterpart, talking about taking the 6 God out of his comfort zone: “Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs.” Together, they capture the cursed smile that unknowingly creeps onto your face when you look at Drake’s hideous, gaudy mansion. Who is this guy? It’s Drakes all the way down, baby."
