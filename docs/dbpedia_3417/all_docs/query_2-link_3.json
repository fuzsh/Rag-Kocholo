        "text": "Laugh Now Cry Later is hands down the funniest show in Chicago. Join us every 1st Saturday and let the BEST Stand Up Comics make you laugh like you’ve never laughed before. This show is soo funny you’ll cry.\n\nKnown primarily for the nation’s longest running independent comedy show (The Lincoln Lodge) we also produce special events, help others organizations to raise money with comedy events and offer classes (Feminine Comique and Stand-Up Seminary) to encourage more community participation in stand-up comedy. We have been very successful at nurturing local talent and can point to a long line of alumni like Hannibal Burress, Kyle Kinane, T.J. Miller, Pete Holmes and Cameron Esposito who all got their start at The Lodge. Our reputation for professionalism, talent and integrity means organizations such as Just for Laughs and Comedy Central have invited us to collaborate with them."
