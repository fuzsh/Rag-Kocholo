        "text": "Once you’re in a calm state after the manic episode, you can choose how you make amends (depending on how close you are to the person).\n\nYou have the option of saying “I’m sorry” versus “I apologize.” They mean two different things.\n\n“I’m sorry” expresses personal regret without accepting responsibility. “I apologize” takes responsibility for an action but not necessarily with any sentiment behind it.\n\nWhen you manage a condition that may complicate your relationships, consider this way of acknowledging an action and moving past it:\n\nName the behavior.\n\nApologize.\n\nEnd on a high note, without rationalizing.\n\nFor example: “I laughed out of turn during the timeout in the game when you were reprimanding the team. I apologize. I respect how you coach them, and I appreciate your follow-through.”"
