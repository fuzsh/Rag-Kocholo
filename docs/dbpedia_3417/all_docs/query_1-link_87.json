        "text": "Hold your breath, Canadian rapper Drake just dropped a new collaboration with Lil Durk called 'Laugh Now Cry Later' from the album 'Certified Lover Boy' with a glamorous Dave Meyers-directed video filmed at Nike World Headquarters in Oregon. Surprisingly, the five-minute track also features athletes like Kevin Durant, Marshawn Lynch, Odell Beckham Jr and Druski2Funny.\n\nThe lyrics of the song go: \"Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but I guess you know now/ Baby/ I took a half and she took the whole thing slow down/ Baby/ We took a trip now we on your block and it’s like a ghost town/ Baby/.\" The two rappers — Drake and Durk — even pose with basketballs in the video and the latter sports Lebron James's iconic white suit from his draft night in 2003.\n\nNo sooner did it drop on YouTube, there were tons of social media reactions on Twitter. \"I’m into this. Durk sounds great. Drake got them shots off. Cardo snapped per usual. And Mascara Drizzy on some Baz Luhrmann shit. He gotta go full Great Gatsby for this next rollout let’s go,\" one tweet read.\n\nPraising the song, one said, \"I like this new drake song, Lil Durk really did good on it, Drakes verses were solid, and the beat was crazy. The only major issue is him saying ‘baby’ gets so annoying.\"\n\nOne even went on to say: \"Nba players getting ready to use lyrics from Drake and Durk on Instagram during the bubble playoffs.\"\n\nMany stood in support for Durk. \"Durk has been working his ass off since he got his shot in 2012. Never stopped. He deserves everything coming to him for sure...\" one tweet read.\n\n\"2012-2013 durk is some of my favorite music. I see a lot of people say he improved and that’s true in certain ways but his music was always great and his success feels to me more like a result of consistent work ethic than his music suddenly taking some radical leap,\" one music lover said.\n\nThe video marks Drake’s first major single since ‘Toosie Slide’ in April, which featured a music video filmed inside his home. With all those cameos and the basketball shots, will this track soon become a rage among NBA fans? Well, only time will tell."
