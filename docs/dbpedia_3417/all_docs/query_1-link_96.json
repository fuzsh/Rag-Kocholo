        "text": "After Drake and Lil Durk's collaboration on 'Laugh Now Cry Later', fans have been wanting more. The song drew a lot of attention from fans, particularly for Durk's verse which throws shade at rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine.\n\nDurk shared that he and Drake teamed up for the track and he recorded two or three different verses for the song during the course of a single day in the recording studio, according to Complex. \"It was actually a one-day process. He just hit me up. So we went back and forth on the song and we shot the video like two days later,\" he said. Durk added that they started their initial communication with DMs and then after sending ideas back and forth, they began using FaceTime. \"We did like two or three different verses just through FaceTime.\"\n\nAccording to the 'Viral Moment' singer, the coronavirus pandemic resulted in only one of those verses making it to the final cut. \"Oh, when I sang on the verse, I left. I thought it was done,\" he said. \"This was around the time the studio was really tripping about Covid. But when I had left the studio, it was supposed to get mixed the next day. So that being a shorter version was on my end.\"\n\nThe verse, however, had fans finding a new appreciation for Durk as it shows a contempt for snitches and because it especially disses Tekashi 6ix9ine. The start of the verse goes, \"I'm in the trenches, relax. Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats.\"\n\nDurk was also aware that fans wanted a longer version and he told Complex, \"He (Drake) wanted me to go long… S**t, me too. I will f**k around and drop a freestyle now.\" When it comes to his verse, Durk has shown no signs of regretting the diss, but the opposite really. Durk was asked if he wanted to say anything to Tekashi and he said, \"No. I don’t play those games. I don’t pay attention to n-**** like that. I just hate rats, and he’s one of them.\"\n\nAdditionally, after 'Laugh Now Cry Later' released on August 14, Durk shared a photo three days later on Instagram with him laughing and his caption was similar to his verse: \"Please do not play that lil Boi in the club cause we do not listen to rats.\"\n\nDurk is not the only hip-hop artist who has shared their disdain for Tekashi's snitching. In a series of Instagram posts, Snoop Dogg called him a “s.n.i.t.c.h.” and “a rat and a goon\". Vince Staples asked his 1.1M followers: \"Did 69 tell on you?\" King Von has voiced his displeasure about Tekashi, women who listen to him and those who work for him.\n\nMeanwhile, Drake and Durk fans can get excited for more collabs between the pair. Referring to 'Laugh Now Cry Later', Durk revealed, \"It ain’t the only one. I’ll leave it at that.\""
