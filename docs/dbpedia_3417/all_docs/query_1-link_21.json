        "text": "grown-ish is back on Freeform, and it’s graduation season! This senior year cast includes Yara Shahidi, Trevor Jackson, Francia Raisa, Luka Sabbat, Emily Arlook, Chlöe Bailey, Halle Bailey, Jordan Buhat, and Diggy Simmons.\n\nThis is one of those series aimed at older teens and younger twenty-somethings that accurately portrays what the college experience is actually like in real life. One big part of that is the fact that it features music that specific age range is actually listening to right now. Another aspect of the show I love is how every episode is titled after a popular song or album title, but even more than that, they are aptly suited to the content of that episode. I just think that’s such a unique and special component of the series.\n\nLet’s get into the music featured this season on grown-ish…\n\nSeason 4, Episode 10: “It Was Good Until It Wasn’t”\n\n“Toxic” by Kehlani\n\nHeard at the very beginning of the episode while Zoey (Yara Shahidi) is giving her voiceover recap\n\n“Grown” by Chloe x Halle\n\nHeard as the theme song over the opening credits of every episode\n\n“Give Me A Reason” by R.LUM.R\n\nHeard while Nomi (Emily Arlook) is listening to a voicemail from Phil\n\n“Strange” by Celeste\n\nHeard while Zoey (Yara Shahidi) and Luca (Luka Sabbt) have a serious conversation\n\nSeason 4, Episode 11: “Movin’ Different”\n\n“Fall Back” by TT The Artist ft.
