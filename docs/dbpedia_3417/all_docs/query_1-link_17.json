        "text": "Any Warriors fans who wanted to dunk on Drake before, during or after last year's NBA Finals can now live vicariously through Kevin Durant.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors global ambassador and rapper dropped the music video for \"Laugh Now Cry Later\" featuring Lil Durk on Thursday, with Drake spending most of it on Nike's Beaverton, Ore. campus. Former Raiders star Marshawn Lynch steals the show by tackling Drake in a brief appearance, but Durant absolutely dominates the Canadian star in a 1-on-1 game.\n\n[RUNNIN' PLAYS PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode]\n\nDurant hasn't played in an NBA game since rupturing his Achilles in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals against Drake's Raptors, and his rehab is, at the very least, far enough along to best someone who once air-balled a 3-pointer warming up with Kentucky. By my count, Durant was 5-of-5 from the field with a steal, a block and two dunks over Drake.\n\nYes, I counted stats from a fake 1-on-1 game in a music video. What did you do with your Thursday night?\n\nDrake traded barbs with Durant and the Warriors when Toronto and Golden State squared off in last year's Finals. There was Drake's \"Home Alone\" hoodie worn before Game 2, followed by Klay Thompson dropping a \"See you in the Bay, Aubrey\" after the Warriors' win that night. Then Drake trolled Thompson, and later Draymond Green, but it was all good-natured. Green and Drake met up between Games 1 and 2, while Steph Curry even gave the rapper a congratulatory call after the Raptors won their first NBA title.\n\n[RELATED: Draymond wants you to know he liked Trent Jr. before you did]\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nDurant's no longer a Warrior, of course, with Game 5 marking his last appearance in a Golden State uniform before he joined the Brooklyn Nets in free agency. Drake said he was \"wrecked\" seeing Durant get hurt, and he even referenced the NBA star's eventual road back to the court in a verse on Rick Ross' \"Gold Roses\" last summer. It's fitting, then, that we'd get one of our first glimpses at Durant back on the court in a Drake video.\n\nThat it plays out like a fever-dream revenge fantasy written by one of their own has to be a cathartic, added bonus for Warriors fans."
