        "text": "Lil Wayne recently sat down with journalist Elliott Wilson for an episode of TIDAL’s CRWN series in which they discussed a bevy of topics. On Sunday (August 16), Wilson shared a snippet of their conversation to his Instagram account, which caught the attention of fellow Young Money artist Drake.\n\nUnderneath the post, the Grammy Award-winning rapper/singer praised Wayne for his selflessness and thanked him for getting him where he is today, making it clear just how much he respects Lil Tunechi.\n\n“This man believed in me after so many never called again or just didn’t see it to begin with,” Drake wrote. “Most selfless artist ever never held any of us back always pushed us forward every single night in people faces 20k packed into an arena and he had a whole set of his show dedicated to introducing us FOR YEARS…all praise and credit due to the [GOAT].”\n\nIn the clip, Wayne gives Drake his flowers first.\n\n“As far as Drizzy, Drizzy always was just a knock out from the door,” he says. “He was just everything. Plain and simple.”\n\nHe went on to say how surprised he was to learn Drake was from Canada and that he was once a childhood actor on the show Degrassi: The Next Generation. He was honored Drake would even consider Wayne as an option when it came to signing.\n\nIn 2009, Drake became the subject of a bidding war due to the success of the So Far Gone mixtape but ultimately signed with Young Money on June 29, 2009. From there, Wayne took him on the America’s Most Wanted Tour in July of that year and the rest is history."
