I think people are finally getting sick of him. His days of having #1 hits are probably over. He will still get top 20 hits because of his name.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nFor what it is, it's a nice song. And it will be interesting to hear Lil Durk on pop radio. But yes, Drake is on cruise control. Years of success appeared to have drained him of any desire to innovate. It'll probably perform a bit worse than Toosie Slide.\n\nPost by Choco on\n\nAgain? I swear I've heard him do this song before, and better.\n\nPost by kcdawg13 on\n\nI like the song a lot, I find it to be very uplifting. However it does feel like Drake was attempting to remake God's Plan.\n\nPost by Enigma. on\n\nEverything this guy releases sounds the same. I think people are finally getting sick of him. His days of having #1 hits are probably over. He will still get top 20 hits because of his name.\n\nHe just had one earlier this year and has one of the biggest hits of 2020 with Future.\n\nI mean I am not even fan of his these days but definitely wouldn't go THAT far.\n\nPost by g8erboi on\n\nI mean... it’s better than Toosie Slide, but that’s not saying much.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nHe has made this hit a few times, but every time it was successful, so I can't blame him.\n\nPOP (MOCK-UP)\n\n-- ??
