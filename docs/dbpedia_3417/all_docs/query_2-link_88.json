        "text": "Drake just dropped his new song and video a few hours ago. “Laugh Now Cry Later,” featuring Lil’ Durk, was shot at Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon\n\nIn the video, we see Drake playing various sports with some amazing athletes. He goes one-on-one with Kevin Durant, catches a pass from Odell Beckham Jr., and gets tackled by Marshawn Lynch; he also trains for boxing underwater and rides golf carts in the dark and drives a jetski.\n\nHe also makes fun of his own sensitivity: when he sings, “Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry, but you know now,” he gets interrupted while he’s crying. “It’s just been a long fight,” he explains. “But I’ve got to have a warrior spirit. I’m just regrouping. You got a tissue?”\n\nWatch the video below.\n\nBrian has been working in pop culture and media for about three decades: he’s worked at MTV, VH1, SiriusXM, CBS and Loudwire. Besides working as a writer and an editor-in-chief, he’s also appeared on air as a pundit, guested on radio shows and hosted podcasts. Over the years, he’s interviewed the surviving members of Led Zeppelin, the members of U2, Beyonce, Pink, Usher, Stevie Nicks, Lorde… and is grateful to have had the chance to interview Joe Strummer of the Clash and Tom Petty."
