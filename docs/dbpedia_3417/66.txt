Promo photos from the next new episode of grown-ish have been released. The episode is called, “Laugh Now Cry Later” and it will air on Thursday, March 17.

In the episode, “Zoey and Aaron’s relationship is put to the test when she has to decide between a new job opportunity or following Aaron on his new career adventure. Ana is unsure about what to do before starting law school and leans on an old love for advice. Doug’s feelings for Jazz grow.”

I wonder who the old love is Ana leans on. Any ideas?
