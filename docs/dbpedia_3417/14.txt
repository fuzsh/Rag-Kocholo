Drake had the internet going nuts on Friday (August 14) when he released his NBA star-studded music video “Laugh Now, Cry Later” featuring Lil Durk, which is expected to live on his sixth studio album Certified Lover Boy.

It appears, however, Drizzy has been denied trademark rights to the title of his highly-anticipated upcoming album.

In February, Drake’s attorney, Robert Kleinman, filed a trademark application for the phrase “Certified Lover Boy.” The application cites possible uses for the term in music recordings, on clothing, television, and live events.

In April, his application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to certify the title of his upcoming project was denied. Complex reports the trademark for Certified Lover Boy was more than likely refused to avoid “confusion” with Canadian rock band Loverboy, who are known for the 1981 hit song “Working For The Weekend.” The band’s name has been trademarked since 1984 and they are currently still active in the music industry.

The denial also cites that there could be confusion with a Michigan clothing company named Lover’s Lane that sells lingerie since Drake’s application also included the potentiality of using the phrase on clothing too.

“[B]oth parties provide various clothing identical in part and otherwise closely related,” USPTO trademark attorney Tamara Frazier told Complex.

This will not stop the rollout of Drake’s forthcoming effort, though. Kleinman and the OVO boss can refile with a revised application in October.

The 33-year-old hitmaker also has the option to come together with all parties to come up with a “consent agreement.” The agreement essentially allows for two similar parties to register the trademark.

Despite the inability to trademark “Certified Lover Boy,” Drake can still use the phrase for his album title and on merch. The trademark just provides legal protection against counterfeiters.
