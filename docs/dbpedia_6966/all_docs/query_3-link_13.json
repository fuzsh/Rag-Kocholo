This 2024 exhibition appeared at Silent Green in Berlin, featuring several live performances. Coleman collaborated with a stellar group of musicians and artists: Annie Bandez (Little Annie), Robert O. Leaver (This Wilderness, Birdthrower), Phil Puleo (Swans, Cop Shoot Cop), Jared Louche, Kirsten McCord, Paul Wallfisch, Vincent Dubuis, Nick Flynn, Evelyn Frantti, No Anger, Louise Hoffmeister, and Bliss Blood. The fusion of text, music, filmic image material, and performance create an immersive experience that is captivating and entertaining, but also confronts existential questions of human coexistence. The universal stories of the artists confront perceptions and assumptions concerning heartache, disability, mental illness, and addiction alongside the visceral music by Jim Coleman. Voicing the unheard and seeing the unseen are themes that have run through Beth B's films, art, and installation work with an eye to creating dialogue, community, and a place for self-knowledge and acceptance.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nWHYT 086LP\n\nArtist, composer and producer James William Blades' score Pare De Sufrir is presented via AD 93. Pare De Sufrir (translating to 'End of Suffering') is the official soundtrack to A.G Rojas' film of the same title. Spanish-born, Southern California-raised filmmaker AG Rojas is known for creating videos and working with the likes of Jamie xx, Gil Scott Heron, Kamasi Washington, Spiritualized, and Mitski. Rojas' sensitive eye and subjectivity has brought him from the world of music videos to creating his first independent film: a 48-minute featurette following three people as they navigate the liminal space between life and the afterlife in an attempt to heal themselves and each other. Rojas reached out to Blades after coming across his score for Keeping Time (dir. Darol Olu Kae). An intimate and unusual process unfolded. Rojas explained to Blades the personal narrative of the film, the two sharing unfurling conversations on the nature of loss and the human spirit. But Blades did not watch the film and instead worked on instinct to build out a conception of how the score would unfold, shaping its operatic, textural and granular tone. Blades went on to record the score in full, with orchestra and choir, without going back to Rojas for feedback, aware that he was taking a complete risk. The score's pull is reflective of the process of grief itself, how its moods and memories oscillate up and down into the past and lost futures, Blades hitting all those spaces with diverse and stretching notes. The piano holds the memories of Blades and Rojas' grandmothers, who both had out-of-tune pianos sitting in an empty room. The Silogo-De-Oro choir sing throughout, reminiscent of the broken phonetics of grief, the build-up and release of tension and the inability to articulate complete sound or words. The harmony stabilizes and then becomes distant, taking the griever away from the lushness of life and into the realms of loss, death and dream-like realities, as mirrored in Rojas' layered vignettes. As the score closes, the harmonies become richer and fuller, marking a return to life. Understanding the power of sound to both respond to and drive narrative, Blades' score weaves together field recordings, half-remembered conversations, choral movements, string arrangements and electronic fragments into a nuanced and evocative whole.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nV 28021LP\n\nThe strength of the Akira soundtrack lies in its unique blend of traditional Japanese instruments and futuristic electronic sounds. Shoji Yamashiro weaves together an eclectic mix of influences, creating a sonic landscape that mirrors the dystopian and cyberpunk themes of the movie. The use of traditional chants, taiko drums, and Shakuhachi flutes alongside electronic synthesizers and orchestral elements generates a hauntingly mesmerizing atmosphere that perfectly complements the visuals on screen. The composer also drew from the chants of Noh, traditional Japanese theater. Combined with polyrhythmic drum machine beats and synths tuned to gamelan microtonal scales, these styles give a sense of ritualistic tension to the dystopian world of Akira.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nPD 041LP\n\nIn 1969, both Anthony and David were at the start of their respective careers and both were inspired by the ideas of the avant-garde and the new technologies becoming available to them. David experimented with the various techniques being explored in the medium of film making and Anthony tested the limits of what could be done with tape recorders. It was an open and co-operative exploration. The results of their first collaboration was the film Mare's Tail -- an unusually long 2:30 hour film of non-linear multi layered audio visual collage filmed in a wide variety of locations interspersed with texts coming from readings and talks, Kabalistic texts, recorded phone calls, loops, children's voices and other found material. The musical dimension is mainly supplied by various struck objects/noise/feedback/field recordings and samples. There are instruments too and listeners even get treated to a small section of what was to become a Slapp Happy tune. The blurry dreamscape/nightmare that slowly unfolds is laden with late '60s delirium. The original master tapes are long gone and all that remains is the audio track on existing copies of the film and various bits of the makeup tapes, most of which were used (but some not), in the final cut. The low grade 16mm audio track (a degraded source to begin with) is further worn with age, subsequent duplication and repeated screenings. It all adds to the haze -- a quality that David would have most likely approved. Edition of 500 numbered copies.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nRBL 088-4LP\n\n\"Claudio Simonetti's Goblin celebrates a new prog rock version of this famous soundtrack. The terrifying and atmospheric experience of Dario Argento's films comes from the merging of gorgeously crafted visuals with a soul tingling auditory experience. Once heard, Goblin's scores are never quite forgotten. Suspiria is no exception, characterized by its synth heavy sound, carillons, yells and sighs, Suspiria is perhaps Argento's most celebrated film and a classic of horror subgenre in its own right. A surreal masterpiece from Dario Argento with a pounding score from cult prog rockers Goblin, Suspiria will leave you battered and breathless! Deluxe limited purple vinyl plus insert. 499 copies.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nACOLOUR 040LP\n\nA Colourful Storm presents Effroyables Jardins, a soundtrack composed by Zbigniew Preisner for Jean Becker's eponymous film. Given limited distribution during its initial release, the soundtrack's luster has only strengthened and it is now considered a lost gem of contemporary chamber composition. An understated triumph of the oeuvre of Preisner, who closely collaborated with Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski and was responsible for the film scores of Dekalog, The Double Life of Véronique, and the Three Colours trilogy. Effroyable Jardins marks Preisner's post-Kieslowski era of solo composition, shifting from devotional harmonies into a beautifully restrained style of neo-Romanticism. It is his second soundtrack for Jean Becker, following Francis Ford Coppola's commission for The Secret Garden, the César-winning Élisa, and Edoardo Ponte's Between Strangers.

The album August in the Water: Music for Film 1995-2005 plots a decade of Onogawa's compositions for films by the renowned filmmaker Gakuryū Ishii (formally known as Sogo Ishii). This retrospective publication, sequenced into an album by Onogawa himself, spans a fertile period of collaboration with Ishii, through soundtracks for three remarkable films: August in the Water (1995), Labyrinth of Dreams (1997), and Mirrored Mind (2005). Each feels texturally and sensually linked with the spiritual, ambient, dreamlike quality that lingers in Onogawa's music. The sound Onogawa conjures for these films is elegant and patient, often minimal or essential in form, but saturated in a poetic emotion and atmosphere that feels strange and otherworldly, touched by the metaphysical in subtle ways. Boundaries are crossed between New Age and science fiction, locating a blissfulness, melancholy and paranoia within the same spectrum, and moving toward an enchanting sense of mood and color. New listeners might hear links to Mark Snow's compositional work for the X-Files and Millennium, or other celebrated future-facing and future-fearing Japanese anime or cyberpunk. Onogawa's music adds great depth and tenor to the sensory experience of the films themselves, but it stands just as strongly as a listening experience on its own terms, a virtuosic example of ambient that changes in hue when turned in the light. Remarkably, and in similar circumstances to Ishii, Onogawa's work has never been widely available outside of (always highly enthusiastic) underground fan posts, usually sourced from extremely limited and private CDs limited to Japan. This retrospective seeks to remedy that, and hopes to achieve recognition for Onogawa as one of the great composers of the last three decades. Onogawa continues to work in film, both in the creation of soundtracks, and now as a producer and director. He composed the music for Koji Fukada's Harmonium (2016), which won the Jury Prize in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as for Fukada's A Girl Missing (2019).\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nTHRILL 617LP\n\n\"Thrasher is the soundtrack to a virtual reality video game about a creature that has a life cycle that traverses different psychedelic realities.

This elusive masterpiece in library music captures the most impressive work, alongside Underground (1970), of the Italian composer and alto sax player. Overground was released on Sincro Edizioni Musicali in 1970 as the soundtrack to Enrico Moscatelli and Mario Rigoni's documentary Persuasione, commissioned by Ente Provinciale Per Il Turismo Di Trento, a local tourism board in Italy, with music composed by Sandro Brugnolini and Luigi Malatesta, featuring some of the best musicians in Italy at the time like Angelo Baroncini and Silvano Chimento on guitars, Giorgio Carnini on piano and organ, Enzo Restuccia on drums, and Giovanni Tommaso on bass and effects. The music spans from underground psychedelic prog rock with swirling organs, trippy effects, and distorted fuzz guitars to sophisticated Lounge grooves with avant-garde orchestrations. The music has been transferred and remastered from the original master tapes. It has been lacquer cut in stereo by Jukka Sarapää at Timmion Cutting and packed in a thick cardboard sleeve featuring a fully restored painting by Umberto Mastroianni licensed by Centro Studi dell'Opera di Umberto Mastroianni.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nMPI 014LP\n\nTi Ho Sposato Per Allegria (1967) is a comedy directed by Luciano Salce, taken from the theatrical play of the same name (1965) by Natalia Ginzburg. A lawyer from a good family, serious, accustomed to a calm and regular life who got married to a indolent and dazed girl with a difficult past a month after meeting her at a party. The story has become a minor classic with each new representation. On both stage and screen the themes of everyday life, and the more complex and existential ones, are addressed. The subtle irony of the work relies on recounting problematic events in a carefree tone: realities such as abortion, death, separation and the couple's incommunicability are underplayed with naturalness. The funny events of the film are commented on by Piero Piccioni's music, published for the first time on vinyl by Musica Per Immagini, with a harmonious tracklist. For this first orchestra rehearsal with the director, which will be followed by other important soundtracks, the composer makes an effective and elegant synthesis: on the one hand he reworks moods and aesthetic intuitions of some previous and happy experiences, while on the other he identifies and anticipates the first bars of that unmistakable sound between bossa nova, funk and lounge nuances that will characterize almost all the production of the '70s. In fact, the Turin-native artist simplifies in a positive sense the articulated harmonic structures that have always distinguished his authorial figure -- where the so-called jazz features are to be considered more than central in the musical texture, as prominent elements of the harmonic syntax -- and he tries a melodic reduction that will make the compositions more-catchy or memorized, but not easier for this. Lightness of spirit and rarefied elegance are the keys of this new Dionysian world.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nBCM 9601CD\n\nBeat Records relaunches on the market the classic OST by Ennio Morricone for the Western film Le pistole non discutono, directed in 1964 by Mario Caiano and starring Rod Cameron, Ángel Aranda, Vivi Bach, Horst Frank, José Canalejas, Kay Fisher, Joseph Martin, Hans Nielsen, Dick Palmer, Judy Robbins, and Andrew Ray.

His work as an instrument inventor, improviser, musical iconoclast, and stalwart of the idiosyncratic Baltimore experimental scene culminated in the late 2010s when filmmaker Skizz Cyzyk shot hours of footage of Feather taking stock of his workshop and his collaborations with musicians from Baltimore and beyond as he prepared to relocate permanently to New Zealand. That period produced Sound Mechanic, Skizz's 2022 feature-length documentary about Feather's work and music. It also produced an album-length collection of recordings of Feather's music from the film that captures the spectrum of his unique sonic vision. Uninterested in the traditional rules and roles of music from his early years, Feather began constructing noisemakers out of what was around him -- pieces of metal, spare parts from bikes and other gadgets, discarded traditional instruments, various electronics, ball bearings, and so on. By the time he moved to Baltimore in 1985, his work had become more codified into a practice of instruments and families of instruments, such as the Nondo, the Vibrawheel, and the Former Guitars. At the same time, he became a mainstay of the burgeoning experimental/improvised music scene that erupted from the Red Room and the internationally renowned High Zero Festival. Sound Mechanic the album serves as an ideal audio entry point into Neil's music. Skizz, who recorded and co-produced, captured a variety of solo demonstrations and improvised performances with long-time collaborators including Kristin Toedtman, Rupert Wondolowski, and his now-spouse Rosie Langabeer. Tracks such as 'Untitled 1' and 'Untitled 3' find Neil performing solo on the Wiggler and the Vibrowheel, instruments whose agitated strings and spinning oscillators, respectively, mimic some of the timbres of more recognizable instruments but bend and distort them in alien ways. 'Unititled 4,' one of two duo improvisations with Langabeer under the banner Popular Organ Fun Party, channels a Venusian jazz combo in its wild exclamations and percolating rhythms. 'Personal Space,' from an impromptu trio with Zula Wildheart and Robert Beamer, puts Neil's attack in the context of contemporary hardcore. A special bundle offers a chance to capture both the music and the film in one package -- as close as you're going to get to the full Neil Feather experience outside of a live show.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nDC 934LP\n\n\"Evil Does Not Exist is an expansive new soundtrack undertaking from Eiko Ishibashi, a stellar further display of her ability to explicate the depths of the unspoken in her music. That it is also the soundtrack to the new Ryusuke Hamaguchi feature is marvelous news for all who loved her score for his Oscar-winning 2021 film, Drive My Car. That her music harmonizes effortlessly with the state of nature as depicted in his film, a nuanced tale of humans' uneasy efforts to maintain co-existence with the delicate state of the planet, is a further profound achievement. At play here, though, is much more than fantastic new music from a powerful new film -- it is evidence of a vital recomposition of the relationship of sound to narrative, and composer to filmmaker. The impetus for this came when Eiko was asked by overseas promoters for a program of live performances backed by visuals. After some thought, she asked Hamaguchi if he would make something for her to use for this purpose. This led Hamaguchi to develop the script further, with sequences of dialogue. In the end, he made two works: Gift, a silent film to act as a visual score for a live performance by Ishibashi, and Evil Does Not Exist, his new narrative feature film, which provided the visual material for the silent film Gift and features Eiko's music as its soundtrack. This is a fittingly synergistic exchange within their two disciplines, in which the moods and intentions of the music and the film acted in practical conversation: each one a sovereign statement, made possible by its relationship with the other. Eiko's compositions are scored for violin, cello, guitar, drums and keyboards. Her longtime partner Jim O'Rourke played the guitar and mixed and mastered the recordings when they were done, eliciting further the necessary nuances of atmosphere and mood that one would expect in one film, much less two!\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n2LP\n\nLPDM 047LP\n\nDouble LP version.

Full color sleeve with unseen pics of Ron Geesin in his studio doing math stuff on the back. Ron Geesin made this kooky electro groovy score to a really progressive math educational program on Central TV in 1980, and it's musically anarchic and amazing, and it's never been issued before. Until now.\n\n\"Basic Maths was the second educational TV Series for the Midlands-based ITV station for which I composed, played and recorded all music and noises. The first series, also for budding mathematicians in the 7-10 age group, was Leapfrog in 1978 produced by ATV (Associated Television): Basic Maths was for the newly-formed Central Television, the work spanning 1980-1981; both series were of twenty-eight parts. The most-worthy idea for both of these series was to project mathematics into life by means mainly of non-verbal sound and vision, with both animated and live action films, linked by two presenters, Fred Harris and Mary Waterhouse. In my role as media composer, I had had quite enough of voice overs, therefore music well under, so this fairly radical educational approach at the time encouraged my creative juices to run unhindered. Of course, the sound had to do something with the picture and not just use it as a carrier for peacock display. It had to duet, play with and explain the visual content using novel and engaging techniques, so this involved the usual and sometimes intricate mathematical calculations which constantly exercised my already reasonable school maths.\" --Ron Geesin\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nFKR 076LP\n\n2015 release. After a twenty-three-year hiatus, The Dance of Reality marked the triumphant return of Alejandro Jodorowsky, the visionary Chilean filmmaker behind cult classics El Topo and The Holy Mountain. In the radiantly visceral autobiographical film, a young Jodorowsky is confronted by a collection of compelling characters that contributed to his burgeoning surreal consciousness. The legendary filmmaker was born in 1929 in Tocopilla, a coastal town on the edge of the Chilean desert, where the film was shot. Blending his personal history with metaphor, mythology, and poetry, The Dance of Reality reflects Jodorowsky's philosophy that reality is not objective but rather a \"dance\" created by the imagination. Written, performed and recorded by Alejandro's son, the acclaimed actor, director and musician Adan Jodorowsky, Dance of Reality's original soundtrack expands from gossamer folk acoustic guitar themes and solo piano compositions to rich cinematic orchestral arrangements echoing the work of John Barry and Ennio Morricone combined with extrovert narrative traditional pieces executed in the vein of Nino Rota. This LP contains the sixteen original compositions that make up the score for Alejandro's seventh feature film which witness a return to the ABKCO film company who produced his underground classics El Topo and The Holy Mountain.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n5CD\n\nDPDM 019CD\n\nDigitmovies presents the soundtracks composed by Bruno Nicolai for four of Jess Franco's movies: A Virgin Among The Living Dead, 99 Women, Nightmares Come At Night, and Eugenie De Sade'70.

It was the so-called Cocktail Generation phenomenon, of which VIP 200, a quartet formed in Italy in 1999, was the ultimate expression as a band. The most important input came from the reissues and compilations of Italian soundtracks that debuted with great success at the time, and VIP 200's interpretations of them were genuine, rustic and rich in atmospheres that led back precisely to music for the image. Even cinema, like Quentin Tarantino, has been fascinated and inspired by that sound by quoting it several times. The comparison and real meeting of VIP 200 with the Marc 4 as well as Alessandro Alessandroni and the legendary Piero Umiliani was fundamental. Soon after, they were also called from abroad by cult figures who wanted to interact with them such as German composer Peter Thomas with whom they recorded in Saint Tropez, DJ Maxwell Implosion and sessions in Capri with Miss Maki Nomiya of the Pizzicato Five for her solo record. It was a period of transition, the word \"easy\" that started from the Adriatic Riviera via Rome and Milan had made its way to Berlin, London and Tokyo. Their live shows, as well as their first and only record re-released for the first time on double gatefold vinyl by Cinedelic with many outtakes, alternated between danceable moments with fast rhythms such as shake, beat and soul funk, to more ethereal and psychedelic, to softer and more ironic ones. They loosely and spontaneously re-presented songs that before then no one had ever performed live with a band; ten years later Calibro 35 would get there. All strictly from Italian composers or their own. Strong was the \"fetishist\" component that pushed them to research original instruments of the vintage, design, sound and atmosphere to be created.
