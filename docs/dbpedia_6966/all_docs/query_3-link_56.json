        "text": "Zbigniew Preisner has composed the music for the upcoming psychological thriller Angelica. The film is written and directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein (Teeth, Happy Tears) and stars Jena Malone, Janet McTeer, Ed Stoppard, Tovah Feldshuh and Eliza Holland Madore. The movie based on the novel of the same title by Arthur Phillips is set in 1880 London and follows a young shop girl whose dream marriage to a medical researcher turns into a nightmare after puritanical doctors order the couple to a regime of abstinence and a ghostly force enters their home. Joyce Pierpoline is producing the project for Pierpoline Films along with Richard Lormand. Academy Award nominee Dick Pope (The Illusionist, Mr. Turner) serves as the filmâ€™s cinematographer. Preisner is best known for scoring the Three Colors films, as well as such feature as The Double Life of Veronique and The Secret Garden. Angelica is set to premiere this coming week at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nANGELICA (2015)"
