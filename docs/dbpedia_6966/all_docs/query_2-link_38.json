        "text": "\"Writing a tune is like sculpting. You get four or five notes, you take one out and move one around, and you do a bit more and eventually, as the sculptor says, \"In that rock there is a statue, we have to go find it.\" John Williams\n\nI would like to start this article with a question. Can you imagine watching a movie without music, just the image? Would it feel the same way? Is it the music that ultimately reveals our various intense emotions? The image is connected to the music. It is expressed through it. Often, it was the music that motivated us to watch a movie. Surely, the moment we read this article many favorite movies come to our mind and especially their music, through which we loved them. This music was written by great composers who impressed us with their talent, passion and dedication. Therefore, in this article I will introduce you some of the most remarkable film composers of all time. I chose to start with the oldest film composers to pay homage to them, so to speak. I also think that they are the teachers of the younger ones.\n\nEdmund Meisel (1894-1930)\n\nStarting with the older one, I couldn't help but beginning with the silent cinema. Edmund Meisel is considered the most famous of all silent film composers. He wrote the music score for many films, including one of the most important films in the history of silent cinema, ''Battleship Potemkin'' (1925). In fact, he wrote the film music within 12 days (!).\n\nEdmund Meisel was born in Vienna in 1894. He completed his musical studies at the age of 18 and began working as a violinist with the Blüthner and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras. However, it was his collaboration with director Sergei Eisenstein on the famous film ''Battleship Potemkin'' that made him stand out as a pioneer. ''Meisel's expressionistic style, turning first and foremost on rhythm, was many stages in advance of the films for which he composed. His musical accompaniment for the Russian film Battleship Potemkin marked him out as a pioneer in film music [...]The rhythms which mark the departure of the mutinous ship, as the engines begin to work, have become famous, and since have been imitated countless times'' ( Review in London's, K.: Film Music 1936:93).\n\nCharacteristic of his writing was his association with the Modernist Movement in music. More specifically, Meisel used to use techniques such as sharp changes in dynamics, the use of dissonance as well as various sounds and noises in his compositions. The above elements gave Meisel an international reputation and the title of a controversial and modernist film composer.\n\nNino Rota (1911-1979)\n\n''When I'm creating at the piano, I tend to feel happy; but - the eternal dilemma - how can we be happy amid the unhappiness of others? I'd do everything I could to give everyone a moment of happiness. That's what's at the heart of my music''- N. Rota\n\nI believe that many of us have associated his name with many successful movies and in particular with the movie ''The Godfather''. At some point we all have whispered the incredible melody of Nino Rota. The inspirational music of the film has undoubtedly contributed to the film being one of the world's leading one. Giovanni Rota Rinaldi (later Nino Rota) was born in Milan on December 3, 1911. He originates from a musical family, as his great-grandfather was a composer too, his mother a pianist and one of his cousins was a singer. Therefore, his involvement with music was inevitable, whilst his talent was evident from a young age. Thus, he began playing the piano at the age of four and composing four years later. His first composition was performed when Rota was only twelve years old. The impressions were so good that they gave him the title of ''a miracle child”. He studied at the Milan Concervatory and then graduated with a degree in composition from the Academia Santa Cecilia in Rome. For one year, Rota also attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadephia. As the years went on, Rota decided to devote himself to composition. In general, he devoted his whole life to his eternal love, which beyond doubt music. Undoubtedly, Nino Rota left us a huge legacy, given that he composed soundtracks for 158 films, including ''La Strada'' (1954), ''La Dolce Vita''(1960), ''8 ½'' (1963), ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1968), ''The Godfather'' (1972) and ''The Godfather II'' (1974) and many more. In 1975 Rota even won an Oscar for his incredible music in the movie ''Godfather II''. Moreover, Rota composed music for plays, ballets, operas as well as for orchestras and choirs. His compositions’ characteristics are the emphasis on melody and his spontaneity. Nino Rota's music is harmonious, sensual and romantic and communicates directly with the listener. In his music are hidden all the contents that can't be expressed in any other way. At this point I would like to reiterate a phrase of Nino Rota to better understand him and his thinking: ''There are simplicities that are starting points and other simplicities that are arrival points. My music appears easy, and many are those who say that they know it all. But at the end, nobody remembers anything of it because the notes disappeared in front of them. I believe that every artist aspires to simplicity and to communicate his/her own feelings to everyone, without distinctions. Personally, I believe that the best compliment one can give to a musician is to define him/her as contemporary''. We should remember that Nino Rota has had a brilliant, admirable and unrepeatable career and left us a great treasure.\n\nHenry Mancini (1924-1994)\n\n''If you call making people smile with ''The Pink Panther'', then I made a contribution''.- H. Mancini\n\nPink Panther, Moon River, Peter Gunn, Charade, Victor/Victoria... Who hasn't heard at least once the wonderful music from these famous movies? Who hasn't sung them with a smile and a feeling of hope?\n\nMancini's name is directly connected to these films, to film music and to success in general.\n\nEnrico Nicola Mancini was born on April 16, 1924 in Cleveland, Ohio. His involvement with music began at the age of 8 with flute lessons from his father. Four years later he also began piano lessons and then his talent and desire for arranging became obvious. Thus, after high school Mancini attended the Juilliard School of Music in New York City(1943). Three years later, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the Glenn Miller Orchestra. He wrote music for more than 100 films and most of them became a great success, such as ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961),''The Pink Panther'' (1963), ''Charade'' (1963), ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1969),''Charlie's Angels'' (1977) and many others. He also recorded over 90 albums. His 35-year collaboration with director Blake Edwards was very important for his career. He also collaborated with other important artists such as Luciano Pavarotti, Andy Williams, Michel Legrand and Frank Sinatra.\n\nUndoubtedly, Mancini had a unique talent. His music was characterized by optimism, delight, romance, humor and authenticity. He was also the first composer to introduce jazz elements into his compositions, influencing the film music of the 1960s. His melodic sensibility can be felt in every musical note. ''Very few movie composers are great melody writers, and Henry Mancini was the first among them'', composer Leslie Bricusse had significally said. Henry Mancini has won four Academy Awards, one Golden Globe and twenty Grammy Awards. In fact, in April 2004, Mancini was honored by the United States Postal Service with a stamp to recognize his contribution to music as well as to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the film ''The Pink Panther''.\n\nEnnio Morricone (1928-2020)\n\n''Music is an experience, not a science''.- E. Morricone\n\nEnnio Morricone couldn't be omitted in this article. He is one of the most important chapters in the history of film music. He is the emperor of soundtracks and has composed music for more than 500 films and TV series. Morricone was born in Rome on November 10, 1928. A child prodigy, he began composing music at the age of six. He also began trumpet lessons and received his diploma at the age of 18. A year later, Morricone composed his first important work called ''Imitazione''as well as the musical piece ''Intimita''. From 1955 he began to compose music for the cinema. In the '60s, Morricone collaborated with notable and famous artists such as Gianni Morandi, Paul Anka and Amii Stewart. However, the most decisive collaboration for his career was with the director Sergio Leone. This was the beginning not only for a legendary collaboration, but also for a brilliant career. This collaboration of two talented artists led to three successful western films: ''A Fistful of Dollars'' (1964), ''For a Few Dollars More'' (1965) and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''(1966). When we listen to the music from these movies it is clear that Morricone's music is special. Morricone uses vocals, harmonica and guitar. Of course, many more successful films came after. Ennio Morricone was honored five times with the BAFTA Award. He also received two Golden Globes and a Grammy. In addition, France awarded him with the Order of Arts and Letters in 1992 and in 1995 he received the Golden Lion in Venice for his significant contribution to music. In 2016, at the age of 88, Morricone received the Academy Award for Best Original Score for the film ''The Hateful Eight''. Morricone was a talented, inventive, ingenious and influential film composer and these qualities are also reflected in his music, which has become engraved in the world history of film music as well as in our memory. Last but not least, I would like to reiterate a phrase of the director Giuseppe Tornatore ''He is not just a great film composer. He is a great composer''.\n\nJohn Williams\n\n''Music is there for everybody. It’s a river we can all put our cups into, and drink it, and be sustained by it''.-J. Williams\n\nMany of us have linked his name with a distinctive and imposing music. The music of ''Star Wars''. The reason for John Williams, the composer who enchanted us with his great success and talent. John Williams was born on February 8, 1932 in New York. Williams came into the world of music at a young age, as his father was a musician too. At the age of 15, he went about arrangements, whilst he was very talented at the piano. At the age of 23, Williams enrolled at the Julliard School of Music, where he studied piano and composition. John Williams composed music for a symphony orchestra and has collaborated with many of the world's great orchestras. However, his 40-year collaboration with director Steven Spielberg undoubtedly was of great importance to his career and led to the creation of many great films, including ''Schindler’s List'', ''Jurassic Park'', ''Indiana Jones'', ''Star Wars'', ''Harry Potter'', ''Jaws'', ''Superman: The Movie''. He has also collaborated with many famous directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Altman. In fact, Williams wrote the music for the film version of ''Fiddler on the Roof'' in 1971, for which he won an Oscar. Besides composing music for all these famous films, John Williams has also composed music for symphony orchestras, as well as for many important events. It can be noted that the amazing composer is the most nominated person in the history of the Oscars, whilst he has won many awards and was nominated for 52 Academy Awards (!) which shows his unique talent. Moreover, he has received honors from the best American Universities. His music is honest and imaginative. It has a wealth of musical themes, harmony, dynamics and melodic themes that always serve the function. John Williams is undoubtedly one of the most important composers and to him music is his entire life. The following phrase of his concludes his thoughts about music: ''I always say that music, to musicians at least, is our oxygen and we need it to keep working”.\n\nEleni Karaindrou\n\n''Music is the most direct language in the world and as a direct language it throws its’ arrows at the man’s heart and soul” -E. Karaindrou\n\nI couldn't help but mentioning a great Greek composer who left her mark on the Greek cinema. Eleni Karaindou has carved out a brilliant career with many awards and beautiful experiences. She was born on November 25, 1941. At the age of 7, she began learning the piano and then enrolled in the Hellenic Concervarory. A privotal year for her career was 1982, when she met the great director Theodoros Angelopoulos. Ever since started a long and successful collaboration. One of the most important films to me is ''The Weeping Meadow'', which music is certainly amazing! At the age of 24, Karaindou settled in Paris, where she had her doctoral research. There she met the unique Manos Hadjidakis. She has composed many works for cinema but also for theatre. Her music always touches the soul of the listener. She communicates with his inner world. Her music is based on ideas and emotions. It begins with an inner song, which is the consolation of the soul. Karaindrou's music entertains itself in a unique way with the image, with the spirit of the film.\n\nBill Conti\n\n''There's a higher place that I have no illusions about reaching. There's a sophistication and aesthetic about composers who only write only for the music's sake''- Bill Conti\n\nHis name is associated with the successful movie ''Rocky'' (1976), which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. Bill Conti was born on April 13, 1942 and he studied music at ''The Julliard School''. Five years after ''Rocky'', Bill Conti also composed music for the James Bond film: For Your Eyes Only, whilst one more success of his was the music for the ''Dynasty series''. He has been nominated for Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards as well as for Emmy Awards. His music is authentic, intense and has a note of hope and victory.\n\nVangelis Papathanasiou\n\n''What a wonderful and divine key music is!''- V. Papathanasiou\n\nVangelis Papathanasiou...A composer with a great international career and great success. He is considered one of the pioneers of electronic music. He was born on March 29, 1943 and he began composing at the age of four, whilst his first public performance was at the age of six. In 1968, Vangelis, Demis Roussos and Loukas Sideras started a music band named ''Aphrodite's Child'', which became the most successful Greek music band. His greatest success was the soundtrack ''Chariots of fire'' (1981), which won the Academy Award for Best Original Music Score. Vangelis Papathanasiou has written the music score for several films, documentaries and television productions. It is worth mentioning that Vangelis wrote a choral symphony to accompany the NASA Mission: 2001. This work was called: Mythodea and as he explains: ''I made up the name Mythodea from the words myth and ode. And I felt in it a kind of shared or common path with NASA's current exploration of the planet [Mars]. Whatever we use as a key — music, mythology, science, mathematics, astronomy — we are all working to decode the mystery of creation, searching for our deepest roots''. In his brilliant career he has won many awards and distinctions as well as he has contributed to the development of other musical genres. The music of Vangelis Papathanasiou has a harmony and inner peace. As Papathanasiou characteristically said, ''music turns disorder into order and disharmony into harmony''.\n\nAlexandre Desplat\n\n''That's why I'm so passionate about making music for movies because you dive in and find the best ideas to bring to life a collective piece of art''- A. Desplat\n\nAlexandre Desplat or Alexandros Ladopoulos is certainly a living legend of film music. He was born in Paris on August 23, 1961 and is of Greek origin. The unique music of Manos Hadjidakis and Markos Vamvakaris contributed to the creation of his musical instict. Alexandre started playing music at the age of 5 and today he is one of the most important composers of his generation, who has had an admirable career. As he has said: ‘‘I‘ve always wanted to be a film composer. So too early I started collecting soundtracks and paying attention to how movie music works. Actually I'd like to have the opportunity to conduct for the rest of my life''. Among his teachers was the great Greek composer Ioannis Xenakis. Alexandre Desplat has written the music score for great films. In fact, he received an Academy Award in 2014 for his music in the film ''Hotel Grand Budapest'', but that’s not his only achievement, as he has received 91 Awards (!) and honors. His music has a sense of energy and aims to conquer the audience, which he definitely does. ''Every film has its own sound, which I try to listen to before I start composing'', Alexandre has said.\n\nZbigniew Preisner\n\n\"When Strauss was writing his music, it was dance music. Now it's classical music. So how can you tell that in 50 years' time film music will not turn out to be classical music?\" - Zbigniew Preisner\n\nZbigniew Preisner (b. 1955) is Poland's most well-known film music composer and is widely regarded as one of his generation's best.\n\nPreisner worked closely with Krzysztof Kieslowski, the filmmaker, and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the scriptwriter, for many years.\n\nHe has received international acclaim for his compositions for Kieslowski's films No End, Dekalog, The Double Life Of Veronique, Three Colours Blue, Three Colours White, and Three Colours Red.\n\nHector Babenco's At Play In The Fields Of The Lord, Foolish Heart, My Hindu Friend, Louis Malle's Damage, Luis Mandoki's When A Man Loves A Woman, Agnieszka Holland's Europa Europa, Olivier Olivier's The Secret Garden, Charles Sturridge's Fairytale: A True Story, Thomas Vinterberg's It's All About Love are among the feature films for which Preisner has composed the score.\n\nPreisner, among many Awards, also earned the Minister of Foreign Affairs Award for excellent achievements in the promotion of Polish culture abroad, the President of Poland's Officer's Cross of the Order of the Rebirth of Poland, and the Polish Minister of Culture's Gold Medal Gloria Artis. Preisner is a member of the Academy of French Cinema.\n\nConclusion\n\nIs it possible to single out the best film composers of all time? Obviously not and it is not possible to conclude them in one article. However, in this article I have tried to refer to some of the most important composers who have left their mark on film music with their enviable talent and brilliant career. Recognize these great personalities through this article as well as through the Radio Art channel: ''Film Scores''. Here you will find numerous compositions by some of the composers you've just read about, but you can also discover too many others. Start this wonderful journey!"
