        "text": "Polish Composer Zbigniew Preisner's new album 'Preisner: Melodies Of Youth', performed by Lisa Gerrard and pianist Dominik Wania, is out now on Supertrain Records.\n\n​\n\nPreisner is well known for his film soundtracks including Dekalog, The Secret Garden, the Trois Couleurs trilogy, La Double Vie de Veronique and many more. His collaborations with the famous polish director Krzysztof Kie lowski prompted Preisner s first concert work in the late-1990s his Requiem for My Friend. 'Melodies of My Youth' is a new full-length album of nine selections for piano and voice with Gerrard. Anchoring this album is the stunning piano performance by Domink Wania. Full of nostalgia and beauty the music is what is claims to be, Preisner s reflections on Melodies from his youth growing up in Poland behind the iron curtain.\n\nLisa Gerrard and James Orr composed the original score for 6-part romantic thriller ‘Secret Bridesmaids’ Business’. The first episode premiered on 29th September.\n\n​\n\n“Amid the vines of a picturesque family winery, a playful and dreamy wedding proposal from devoted Alex wins over his down-to-earth bride, Olivia. Would- be bridesmaids Saskia and Melanie, who couldn’t be more different, are at Olivia’s side. It should be the happiest of days. But each of these best friends hides a life-changing secret, several of which are about to explode.\n\n​\n\nThe proposal is a wake-up call for married-with-kids Melanie and she ends her affair with a charismatic stranger, Jakob. When he continues to pursue her, fearful Melanie lashes out, and her fighting back triggers an escalation in Jakob’s behaviour. As his monstrous true nature is slowly revealed, Jakob begins to target those closest to Melanie: her husband Michael, her kids, and Olivia. Meanwhile, Olivia buries the real reason for her reticence to marry Alex in wedding preparations – until she discovers that Alex has been unfaithful. Olivia calls off the engagement, and throws herself into helping protect Melanie from Jakob, defiantly putting herself in the firing line.\n\n​\n\nSaskia harbours a secret that threatens to derail her legal career. When fellow lawyer Alex begins to investigate, Saskia goes to extraordinary lengths to keep the truth from being revealed. The men of the series have secrets too. Alex, the groom, is concealing the truth of his past, while knockabout Michael, Melanie’s husband, harbours a simmering resentment.\n\n​\n\nAs the series reaches its climax, the men reveal they are capable of more than we thought.\n\nWhose blood is on the wedding dress we saw in the series opener? Who will make it out alive, and who will pay the ultimate price?”\n\n​\n\nThe series stars Abbie Cornish, Katie McGrath, and Georgina Haig."
