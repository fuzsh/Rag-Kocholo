        "text": "There are 8 episodes, all about 25 mins in length and they cover a range of topics:\n\nEpisode 1- whilst speaking to a little President during the zombie apocalypse, the topic of drugs is discussed. The final point of there not being good or bad drugs but good or bad situations is one I align with overall.\n\nEpisode 2- Clancy discusses death and how there is an existential fear of it.\n\nEpisode 3- speaks to a pirate with a fish in a bowl as a head. They discuss 'magic' but as in enlightenment rather than the Paul Daniels/David Blane nonsense.\n\nEpisode 4- whilst speaking to a Knight with a bloodsucking sword, Clancy looks at the loneliness we all sometimes feel and how a feeling of belonging and community can make all the difference in the world. It also looks at forgiveness and how it can be challenging to do. This episode had a passage from Rumi in it so it's alright in my book.\n\nEpisode 5- Existential dread is the theme for this light hearted episode... jk... It is heavy but profound as it talks about Hinduism, Buddhism and sitting with one-self and realising that death is a release. It isn't nihilism but more like an awakening that everything will end, but this is good for us as it's a release from worldly pains.\n\nEpisode 6- this episode talks about meditation and how it is important to listen to our thoughts and let them wander.\n\nEpisode 7- the industrial death complex in the West is considered. It drops some knowledge bombs about embalming in the American Civil War and how this warped the idea of the body as dangerous in death.\n\nIt's an intriguing episode as it does look at how western counties seem to fear the death body, something that people have been doing for tens of thousands of years.\n\nEpisode 8- the final episode sees Clancy talking about his birth and formative years with his mother. It's quite sweet as they discuss hardwired behaviours learnt within the first 5 years and the impact these years have on us as adults. They also talk about the ego and why people avoid talking about death as it's all too real. We get an insight into why Clancy has been interviewing people about some deep stuff and it's all quite powerful and sweet actually.\n\nThe series reminded me of Fantastic Planet, Yellow Submarine and various other surreal 70s and 80s animations including the eastern bloc animations I caught on occasion on Channel 4 in my youth. It also recalls many late night conversations with friends after they had been drinking heavily and/or taking something recreational (I'm a total tea to taller and 'Just say no' kinda guy but more power to those that chose to partake responsibly). The show shares much of the surrealism of Adventure Time but the colour pallete is bolder and stronger, all neon purple and pink hues, and the art isn't in the same superflat style.\n\nI liked the show for discussing some deep stuff and being like an idiots guide to some complex topics. It also gave me a chance to reflect on what I thought as well as giving me potential reading material and authors to explore. Also, the content was not skewed towards Western ideas as it did discuss eastern ideas, philosophies and religions too.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think it works as an animation. The 'story' is usually Clancy following some individual through various surrealist landscapes discussing things but they're more of a distraction to what is being said than a complement. Maybe that's the aim, like in transcendental meditation, where they don't want to link ideas and words to imagery but allow it to pop out of your subconscious. Either way, I liked the show for being so daring and swinging for the trees but I don't think it's for me at this time of my life. Yup, I'm falling back on the 'it's not you, it's me' trope but I believe that long and short form essays by other creatives have stolen it's thunder. For example, Like Stories of Old and Jacob Geller cover much of the same material as Midnight Gospel but do so in a calmer, more coherent and meaningful way for me. The Good Place looked at moral philosophy to answer similar questions and, even with its absurdities, covered the material in a much more cohesive and meaningful way... at least for me. But, having said that, it doesn't mean I don't appreciate what The Midnight Gospel is trying to do and I'm sure it'll find its tribe who will love it for what it is.\n\nThe BFI released Robin Redbreast, a revered and influential gentle horror work recently and I decided to give it a viewing. Having never seen it before but hearing a lot about its impact on British horror cinema, namely The Wicker Man I thought it was worth a look. So, is it worth a watch in this day and age or is it looked at fondly with rose-tinted glasses by fans from the time?\n\nWell, what I can say is that Robin Redbreast is quintessential gentle British horror in that it combines folklore, mundane village life and adds shock and surprise in equal measure.\n\nThe story is quite straight forward; newly separated from her partner of many years, a television script editor, temporarily moves to her cottage in a remote English country village to rebuild her life. At first, she finds that the villagers are friendly, if a little eccentric. However, when she becomes pregnant to a handsome villager, she begins to suspect that the locals are conspiring against her to prevent her from leaving... But to what end?\n\nAlthough originally shot in colour, the BFI released it in a black and white transfer I think adds to the slightly hazy, surreal atmosphere of the piece. It also means the film could come arguably from any era as it is set in a rural, unnamed place which seems to be happy in its slow paced, traditional lifestyle.\n\nThe story itself is very much in the folk horror' genre, mentioning traditions from Frazer's The Golden Bough and rituals regarding harvest and sacrifice, but this play also asks wider, more relevant questions from the time which seem pertinent even now; tradition vs. modernity, female pleasure vs. reproductive rights, marriage vs. freedom to have partners and urban vs. rural. I found it very relevant today and was surprised to see that it was televised back nearly 50 years ago when viewing habits were a lot more conservative. I think a lot of this has to do with the quality of the acting which, whilst not up to much of today's high calibre, was overall pretty solid considering it was performed in a play format with the restrictions and style that dictates the acting.\n\nIt's no secret that Iâ€™m a big fan of Nigel Kneale, writer of such works as â€˜Quatermassâ€™, â€˜The Stone Tapesâ€™ and â€˜Beastsâ€™ (a series I am currently watching). I've been working my way through his works over the past several years and it was whilst falling down the YouTube rabbit hole I discovered an hour long short film called â€˜Murrainâ€™, which he wrote for ITV when he had a falling out with the BBC over something (what, I donâ€™t know).\n\nItâ€™s a lesser known Kneale work and formed part of the 'Against the Crowd' series which were short anthology collections that were all the rage in the 70 and early 80s after the success of the â€˜Play For the Dayâ€™ and â€˜Armchair Theatreâ€™ series. The anthology is not well regarded as it was pretty lacklustre apparently but this is one of the standout pieces.\n\nThe story is quite simple, a vet visits a small town which is blighted by a mysterious disease that is killing their livestock. The locals blame old lady Clemson who lives in a ramshackle cottage, accusing her of being a witch. The rational â€˜man of scienceâ€™ vet visits the old lady and sees that she is living in terrible conditions and endeavours to help her. However, when the mob get angry they attack the cottage with dreadful results.\n\nThe production is very cheap and there is very little cinematographic flair on show, it is all very bread and butter but then it's a simple story where special effects donâ€™t matter as they are not needed- the story is king. Over the course of the hour, I had a sense of dread in the pit of my stomach as I feared for the old lady and thought it wasnâ€™t going to end well. The conclusion is ambiguous but that's all part of the charm thatâ€™ll have you thinking about the story long after the viewing. Director John Cooper does a great job creating an effective atmosphere with obviously limited resources, there is an unsettling claustrophobic, insular feeling to proceedings.\n\nThe actors themselves are solid with no-one I recognise apart from M from James Bond (Bernard Lee) who has a key role as the landed gentry leading the witch hunt, whilst Una Brandon-Jones (someone Iâ€™m unfamiliar with but who is quite well known apparently) is riveting as the accused witch.\n\nMurrain is no â€˜Quatermassâ€™ or â€˜Stone Tapesâ€™ but for a short 60 minute films with a tiny budget it is simple, effective and worth your time.\n\nâ€˜The Man From Nowhereâ€™ is the first and oldest of the tales and can be considered a gothic story, in terms of the atmosphere and mood created. A young orphaned girl, Alice, is sent to live with her rich uncle in an isolated country house but is soon menaced by a mysterious figure in black, warning her to leave the accursed place. The foreboding figure emerges suddenly and just as quickly vanishes into the ether, leading to the adults not believing Alice. With the help of some plucky local orphans Alice soon gets to the bottom of the mystery.\n\nThis is a gentle gothic tale but a well crafted one that builds tension as Alice is worried that she is losing her mind. A great start to the collection!\n\nTale two, â€˜Haunters of the Deep,â€™ is a mystery thriller set against the dramatic backdrop of the Cornish coast. When an abandoned mine is found to contain a rich vein of precious metals, an American business man and his daughter come to investigate the possible investment opportunities. However, they ignore the warnings of an old miner who says that the mine is cursed with the ghosts of dead miners. When the prophecy of doom comes to pass, the businessman and miners are trapped in the tunnels with a supernatural force as well as the Atlantic Ocean seeping in.\n\nFor such a short tale the tension cranks up pretty quickly and the supernatural element is sufficiently spooky to be Dr Who-esque level scary.\n\nThe final tale, â€˜Haunters of the Deepâ€™, is shot on location in the village of Eyam, Derbyshire, a town known for being selfless when the villagers of the time quarantined themselves when the Black Death arrived there in 1665. The film relies on this fact to present a spooky tale about a young family who decide to move into a cottage there, only for the children to be plagued with visions from the past.\n\nâ€˜Out of the Darknessâ€™ is an excellently presented childrenâ€™s thriller which blends strong historical drama alongside solid acting from young and old cast alike. The last 15 or so minutes are genuinely quite tense and exciting and the fact that you learn a lot about the history of the area is a real boon.\n\nOverall, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this collection as all the stories were all effective and, considering the obvious budgetary and production limitations, well done with just enough spookiness to be mildly scary without terrifying the youths it was intended for. The child actors, who are in the lead roles for all of the tales, are all solid and perform honestly and earnestly without meandering onto cheesy melodrama.\n\nAt just under 3 hours this collection is pleasant stuff and, whilst not mind-blowing, is lovely matinee viewing at home with a nice cup of tea and biscuits. Preferably on a rainy Sundayâ€¦.\n\nLINK- The Secret Garden (BBC)- Cult TV Review\n\nLINK- Children of the Stones- Cult TV Review\n\nLINK- The Dead of Night (BBC)- Cult TV Review\n\nLINK- The Stone Tapes (BBC)- Cult TV Review\n\nLINK- Jim Hensonâ€™s The Storyteller- Cult TV Review\n\nThe story is a classic and tells the tale of young Mary Lennox, the spoilt girl from India, who comes to live in a big, remote house in Yorkshire when her parents pass away from cholera. She is taken under the guardianship of a distant uncle who doesn't seem to have time for her. For Mary the house contains many mysteries including the sounds of someone crying at night and tales of a secret garden contained on the grounds. Over the course of several months Mary solves these mysterious and brings warmth and light into the dark, dank manor house.\n\nThe series first aired from January to March 1975 and was very popular in its day. As expected from the BBC the period detail is spot on and the charm is there with an impressive performance from the cast all round, especially the lead Sarah Hollis Andrews. She adds a layer of characterisation and sympathy to her initially spoilt Mary Lennox, so you can see her character grow and mature over the course of the episodes.\n\nDuring the 7 episodes, weighing in at 200 minutes, Frances Hodgson Burnett's story is allowed to breath and come to life in a most pleasing way. The story is told at a slow deliberate pace and this allows you to appreciate the acting performances, cinematography and delightful musical score, which complements the whole work and brings it all together. As someone who has never seen the series and thus holds no nostalgia I can say that The Secret Garden is well worth a watch; it's a calm relaxing programme that is perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon. It is a great story to read and a wonderful story to watch on this DVD.\n\nThe plot is basic fighting game 101; Mortal Kombat is a once-a-generation tournament in which fighters battle for the fate of their worlds. The evil sorcerer Shang Tsung and his evil underlings have won 9 tournaments in a row and if they win the tenth one, they will gain the Earth. Three humans are manipulated by Raiden, ably played by Christopher Lambert, to take part in the tournament and defeat this evil whilst also fighting their own demons (metaphorically speaking). Liu Kang, wants to avenge the death of his brother, actor Johnny Cage wants to prove that he isn't a fake martial artist and military officer Sonya Blade wants to avenge her partners death at the hands of Kano, an underworld boss.\n\nWill the ragtag group overcome their personal issues and win Mortal Kombat? Of course they will but it's the journey that matters in this story.\n\nThe movie is incredibly cheesy with one-dimensional characters but the well-choreographed action sequences make it all worthwhile. The dialogue, whilst corny, has Johnny Cage deliver a few great one-liners and the techno-trance beat soundtrack sits well alongside the high octane fight scenes. The film design should be praised as the atmosphere of the first 2 games is conveyed well with the set and the lighting in the film being quite impressive.\n\nOverall the unpretentious nature of the film gives it heart, in its earnestness to tell the ridiculous story the film has a lot of personality and character. Paul W. S. Anderson is an able if unremarkable director, he is most famed for his sci-fi and video game film adaptations (the most popular of which is the Resident Evil film series) and this is one of his best adaptations.\n\nIf you are looking for a guilty pleasure then this film is definitely worth your time, it is good cheesy fun!\n\nThe series is about red-headed twins Rachel and Theo Matheson, who visit their uncle and aunt for the Summer in Auckland, New Zealand. The twins notice a strange neighboring house and sneak into the house to find out more about its owner Mr Wilberforce. The twins realise that they are in the part of a prophecy to defeat an ancient evil which lurks beneath the house and under the mountain. With the help of an old friend they will have to fulfill their destiny and stop the evil from taking over the world. This series is based upon the novel \"Under the Mountain\" by Maurice Gee and is told in 8 parts over 22 minute episodes, each ending with a cliffhanger and a providing a deeper sense of mystery until the final explosive confrontation.\n\nThis story is heavily influenced by the works of H.P.Lovecraft, with the theme that creatures beyond our comprehension are here on earth and are ready to take over. The young twins, played by Kirsty Wilson and Lance Warren are very believable and earnest, especially Wilson who carries much of the emotional weight, especially the scene where they are discussing xenocide. There is a real feeling of dread and scares in this series and I'm sure that if I was the target audience at the time of it's original release I would have felt suitable scared.\n\nUnder the Mountain features a lot of external shots and taking into account that it was shot in New Zealand the scenery is wonderful, I'll resist the temptation to say anything as trite as 'the real star of the show is the scenery' or 'New Zealand is a character' but the geology and natural history of the country is integral to the story and adds a lot to the feel of the series. Due to its age the special effects are dated, the costumes are of their time (think mates 70s/ early 80's Dr who and you'll get the idea) and in today's hyper aware world Mr. Jones comes across as a little predatory, but this doesn't detract from the atmosphere or excitement of the story at all.\n\nAs someone who had never seen the series before and thus had no feelings of nostalgia I can say that considering its age the series stands the test of time well and is definitely worth a look.\n\nThe series starts with a bang as young teen Minty has to stay with her Aunt until her mother recovers from a car accident. She has to stay in a small village with a large Manor House containing a beautiful garden and a mysterious moondial. Minty is drawn to the moondial and one night when she feels is drawing her in she goes to it and faints. When she wakes up she finds she has been transported back through time to the turn of the century. Minty spends the series trying to figure out the mystery of the Moondial and the cursed child with the 'Devils Mark'\n\nThis series is indicative of the style of programmes British TV was airing during that time for children; at times unusual and slightly spook- and for that it has to be commended. No-one does creeping dread like the British and this sort-of ghost story is beautifully realised. Whilst some of the adult actors do come across as quite hammy and theatrical and some of the child actors precocious to the point of annoying the whole thing generally works. There are moments where things lag, for example pretty much any scene with Minty's annoying Aunt but these are tempered with end of episode cliffhangers that really keep you intrigued and excited.\n\nWith my previous review of Children of the Stones I discussed how there was higher level thinking required to figure out the ending. With Moondial the reason why and how Minty is transported is never explained, to quote The Simpsons \"Wizard\" but I would still recommend this for anyone with an interest in unique and unusual children's TV programmes."
