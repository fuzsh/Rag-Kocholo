        "text": "As one of the best known, awarded, and financially successful composers in US history, John Williams is as easy to recall as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland or Leonard Bernstein, illustrating why he is \"America's composer\" time and again. With a massive list of awards that includes over 52 Oscar nominations (five wins), twenty-odd Gold and Platinum Records, and a slew of Emmy (two wins), Golden Globe (three wins), Grammy (25 wins), National Board of Review (including a Career Achievement Award), Saturn (six wins), American Film Institute (including a Lifetime Achievement Award) and BAFTA (seven wins) citations, along with honorary doctorate degrees numbering in the teens, Williams is undoubtedly one of the most respected composers for Cinema. He's led countless national and international orchestras, most notably as the nineteenth conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra from 1980-1993, helming three Pops tours of the US and Japan during his tenure. He currently serves as the Pop's Conductor Laureate. Also to his credit is a parallel career as an author of serious, and some not-so-serious, concert works - performed by the likes of Mstislav Rostropovich, André Previn, Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Gil Shaham, Leonard Slatkin, James Ingram, Dale Clevenger, and Joshua Bell. Of particular interests are his Essay for Strings, a jazzy Prelude & Fugue, the multimedia presentation American Journey (aka The Unfinished Journey (1999)), a Sinfonietta for Winds, a song cycle featuring poems by Rita Dove, concerti for flute, violin, clarinet, trumpet, tuba, cello, bassoon and horn, fanfares for the 1984, 1988 and 1996 Summer Olympics, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and a song co-written with Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman for the Special Olympics! But such a list probably warrants a more detailed background...\n\nBorn in Flushing, New York on February 8, 1932, John Towner Williams discovered music almost immediately, due in no small measure to being the son of a percussionist for CBS Radio and the Raymond Scott Quintet. After moving to Los Angeles in 1948, the young pianist and leader of his own jazz band started experimenting with arranging tunes; at age 15, he determined he was going to become a concert pianist; at 19, he premiered his first original composition, a piano sonata.\n\nHe attended both UCLA and the Los Angeles City College, studying orchestration under MGM musical associate Robert Van Eps and being privately tutored by composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, until conducting for the first time during three years with the U.S. Air Force. His return to the states brought him to Julliard, where renowned piano pedagogue Madame Rosina Lhevinne helped Williams hone his performance skills. He played in jazz clubs to pay his way; still, she encouraged him to focus on composing. So it was back to L.A., with the future maestro ready to break into the Hollywood scene.\n\nWilliams found work with the Hollywood studios as a piano player, eventually accompanying such fare such as the TV series Peter Gunn (1958), Süd Pazifik (1958), Manche mögen's heiß (1959), Das Appartement (1960), and Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962), as well as forming a surprising friendship with Bernard Herrmann. At age 24, \"Johnny Williams\" became a staff arranger at Columbia and then at 20th Century-Fox, orchestrating for Alfred Newman and Lionel Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman, and other Golden Age notables. In the field of popular music, he performed and arranged for the likes of Vic Damone, Doris Day, and Mahalia Jackson... all while courting actress/singer Barbara Ruick, who became his wife until her death in 1974. John & Barbara had three children; their daughter is now a doctor, and their two sons, Joseph Williams and Mark Towner Williams, are rock musicians.\n\nThe orchestrating gigs led to serious composing jobs for television, notably Alcoa Premiere (1961), Checkmate (1960), Gilligans Insel (1964), Verschollen zwischen fremden Welten (1965), Planet der Giganten (1968), and his Emmy-winning scores for Heidi kehrt heim (1968) and Das Geheimnis von Schloß Thornfield (1970). Daddy-O (1958) and Because They're Young (1960) brought his original music to the big theatres, but he was soon typecast doing comedies. His efforts in the genre helped guarantee his work on William Wyler's Wie klaut man eine Million? (1966), however, a major picture that immediately led to larger projects. Of course, his arrangements continued to garner attention, and he won his first Oscar for adapting Anatevka (1971).\n\nDuring the '70s, he was King of Disaster Scores with Die Höllenfahrt der Poseidon (1972), Erdbeben (1974) and Flammendes Inferno (1974). His psychological score for Spiegelbilder (1972) remains one of the most innovative works in soundtrack history. But his Americana - particularly Der Gauner (1969) - is what caught the ear of director Steven Spielberg, then preparing for his first feature, Sugarland Express (1974). When Spielberg reunited with Williams on Der weiße Hai (1975), they established themselves as a blockbuster team, the composer gained his first Academy Award for Original Score, and Spielberg promptly recommended Williams to a friend, George Lucas. In 1977, John Williams re-popularized the epic cinema sound of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Franz Waxman and other composers from the Hollywood Golden Age: Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) became the best selling score-only soundtrack of all time, and spawned countless musical imitators. For the next five years, though the music in Hollywood changed, John Williams wrote big, brassy scores for big, brassy films - Teufelskreis Alpha (1978), Superman - Der Film (1978), 1941 - Wo bitte geht's nach Hollywood (1979), Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981) ... An experiment during this period, Herzquietschen (1981), flopped. There was a long-term change of pace, nonetheless, as Williams fell in love with an interior designer and married once more.\n\nE.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982) brought about his third Oscar, and Menschen am Fluss (1984), Das Reich der Sonne (1987), Die Reisen des Mr. Leary (1988) and Geboren am 4. Juli (1989) added variety to the 1980s, as he returned to television with work on Unglaubliche Geschichten (1985) and themes for NBC, including NBC Nightly News (1970). The '80s also brought the only exceptions to the composer's collaboration with Steven Spielberg - others scored both Spielberg's segment of Unheimliche Schattenlichter (1983) and Die Farbe Lila (1985).\n\nIntending to retire, the composer's output became sporadic during the 1990s, particularly after the exciting Jurassic Park (1993) and the masterful, Oscar-winning Schindlers Liste (1993). This lighter workload, coupled with a number of hilarious references on Die Simpsons (1989) actually seemed to renew interest in his music. Two Home Alone films (1990, 1992), JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991), Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995), Sleepers (1996), Sieben Jahre in Tibet (1997), Der Soldat James Ryan (1998), Die Asche meiner Mutter (1999), and a return to familiar territory with Star Wars: Episode I - Die dunkle Bedrohung (1999) recalled his creative diversity of the '70s.\n\nIn this millennium, the artist shows no interest in slowing down. His relationships with Spielberg and Lucas continue in A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001), the remaining Star Wars prequels (2002, 2005), Minority Report (2002), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and a promised fourth Indiana Jones film. There is a more focused effort on concert works, as well, including a theme for the new Walt Disney Concert Hall and a rumored light opera. But one certain highlight is his musical magic for the world of Harry Potter (2001, 2002, 2004, etc.), which he also arranged into a concert suite geared toward teaching children about the symphony orchestra. His music remains on the whistling lips of people around the globe, in the concert halls, on the promenades, in album collections, sports arenas, and parades, and, this writer hopes, touching some place in ourselves. So keep those ears ready wherever you go, 'cause you will likely hear a bit of John Williams on your way.\n\nComposer and conductor Alexandre Desplat, Oscar winner and seven-time Academy Award nominated, for his prolific filmography and his collaborations with Stephen Frears, Terrence Malick, Ang Lee, Kathryn Bigelow, Jacques Audiard, Wes Anderson, Roman Polanski, George Clooney or Matteo Garrone is one of the most worthy heirs of the French masters of film music.\n\nBrought up in a cultural and musical mix thanks to his Greek mother and his French father who studied and got married in California, he grew up listening to French symphonists, Ravel or Debussy , world music and jazz.\n\nHe studied piano and trumpet before choosing the flute as the main instrument. As a free auditor in Claude Ballif's analysis class at the CNSM, he enriches his classical musical education by studying Brazilian and African music. He will record later with Carlinhos Brown or Ray Lema.\n\nPassionate about film music, it's as much his musical sensitivity as his intimate approach to cinematographic language that will allow his privileged relationship with filmmakers. Inspired by the scores of Maurice Jarre, Bernard Herrmann, Nino Rota or Georges Delerue, it is after hearing the score of John Williams for Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) that he decides to compose exclusively for the big screen.\n\nDuring the recording of his first feature film he meets violinist Dominique Lemonnier. This is the beginning of an exceptional artistic exchange as she becomes her favorite soloist, artistic director and wife. With his strong sense of interpretation, his creative spirit and his singular violin playing, Solré inspired Alexandre's compositions, influencing his music in depth, initiating a new way of writing for the strings in the cinema.\n\nCollaborator of Jacques Audiard since his first film, he creates for his works strong and singular compositions and he won in 2005 for Der wilde Schlag meines Herzens (2005) the Silver Bear of the Berlinale, and his first Caesar. He works in France with Philippe de Broca and Francis Girod but Das Mädchen mit dem Perlenohrring (2003) of Peter Webber, his 50th score for the film, he gets a first Golden Globe nomination and BAFTA and began his rise in Hollywood. Leading American career and European collaborations and remaining faithful to his directors, he composes among others Syriana (2005)'s scores of Stephen Gaghan, Birth (2004) of Jonathan Glazer, Coco Chanel: Der Beginn einer Leidenschaft (2009) by Anne Fontaine, L'armée du crime (2009) by Robert Guédiguian, Largo Winch (2008) by Jérôme Salle, Der Feind in den eigenen Reihen - Intimate Enemies (2007) or Hostage - Entführt (2005) by Florent-Emilio Siri.\n\nPrizes and collaborations with the greatest directors follow one another. In 2007, he received his first Oscar nomination for Stephen Frears's Die Queen (2006) and won his first European Film Award. The same year, he won the Golden Globe, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, and the World Soundtrack Award for John Curran's score Der bunte Schleier (2006), performed by pianist Láng Lang. He composed in 2008 for Gefahr und Begierde (2007) by Ang Lee and Der seltsame Fall des Benjamin Button (2008) by David Fincher which will earn him a second Oscar nomination and a fourth Golden Globes and BAFTA nomination.\n\nWith his score for Der Ghostwriter (2010) by Roman Polanski, he won in 2010 a second César and a second European Film Award. The same year he wrote the music of New Moon - Biss zur Mittagsstunde (2009) by Chris Weitz, whose album was a platinum record, and Tom Hooper's The King's Speech - Die Rede des Königs (2010) for which he won the BAFTA, the Grammy Award, and was nominated for the fourth time at the Oscars and for the fifth time at the Golden Globes.\n\nIn 2010-2011 he wrote the music of Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010) and Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 2 (2011) which became the third greatest success of all time. He composed in 2011 nine partitions, The Tree of Life (2011) of Terrence Malick, Der Gott des Gemetzels (2011) by Roman Polanski, Der fantastische Mr. Fox (2009) by George Clooney , which earned him another Oscar nomination, La fille du puisatier (2011) by Daniel Auteuil and The Ides of March - Tage des Verrats (2011) by George Clooney.\n\nIn 2012 he worked with Kathryn Bigelow for Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Matteo Garrone for Reality (2012), Gilles Bourdos for Renoir (2012), Jérôme Salle for Zulu - Blutiges Erbe (2013), George Clooney for Moonrise Kingdom (2012) and Jacques Audiard for Der Geschmack von Rost und Knochen (2012) for which he won a third Cesar. For his score of Argo (2012) of Ben Affleck, Oscar for Best Picture, it is named for the sixth time BAFTA, and for the fifth time at the Golden Globes and the Oscars.\n\nHe signed in 2013 the partition Monuments Men: Ungewöhnliche Helden (2014) from George Clooney, Venus im Pelz (2013) of Roman Polanski, and was appointed to the BAFTAs and the Oscars for Philomena: Eine Mutter sucht ihren Sohn (2013) of Stephen Frears.\n\nIn 2014 he composed the music Godzilla (2014) of Gareth Edwards, and receives exceptional fact, two Oscar nominations for The Imitation Game - Ein streng geheimes Leben (2014) of Morten Tyldum and Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by George Clooney, for which he won a BAFTA, Grammy and Oscar.\n\nMember of the jury of the Cannes Film Festival in 2012, he became in 2014 the first composer President of the jury of the Venice Film Festival. Crowning long years of collaboration, he directed the London Symphony Orchestra in December 2014 for a concert of his works at the Barbican Theater in London.\n\nIn 2018, Alexandre Desplat received a second Oscar, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA for Shape of Water: Das Flüstern des Wassers (2017) of Guillermo del Toro.\n\nGerman-born composer Hans Zimmer is recognized as one of Hollywood's most innovative musical talents. He featured in the music video for The Buggles' single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which became a worldwide hit and helped usher in a new era of global entertainment as the first music video to be aired on MTV (August 1, 1981).\n\nHans Florian Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, then in West Germany, the son of Brigitte (Weil) and Hans Joachim Zimmer. He entered the world of film music in London during a long collaboration with famed composer and mentor Stanley Myers, which included the film Mein wunderbarer Waschsalon (1985). He soon began work on several successful solo projects, including the critically acclaimed A World Apart, and during these years Zimmer pioneered the use of combining old and new musical technologies. Today, this work has earned him the reputation of being the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional orchestral arrangements.\n\nA turning point in Zimmer's career came in 1988 when he was asked to score Rain Man for director Barry Levinson. The film went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year and earned Zimmer his first Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Score. The next year, Zimmer composed the score for another Best Picture Oscar recipient, Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989), starring Jessica Tandy, and Morgan Freeman.\n\nHaving already scored two Best Picture winners, in the early 1990s, Zimmer cemented his position as a preeminent talent with the award-winning score for Der König der Löwen (1994). The soundtrack has sold over 15 million copies to date and earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score, a Golden Globe, an American Music Award, a Tony, and two Grammy Awards. In total, Zimmer's work has been nominated for 7 Golden Globes, 7 Grammys and seven Oscars for Rain Man (1988), Gladiator (2000), Der König der Löwen (1994), Besser geht's nicht (1997), The Rendezvous mit einem Engel (1996), Der schmale Grat (1998), Der Prinz von Ägypten (1998), and Last Samurai (2003).\n\nWith his career in full swing, Zimmer was anxious to replicate the mentoring experience he had benefited from under Stanley Myers' guidance. With state-of-the-art technology and a supportive creative environment, Zimmer was able to offer film-scoring opportunities to young composers at his Santa Monica-based musical \"think tank.\" This approach helped launch the careers of such notable composers as Mark Mancina, John Powell, Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick Glennie-Smith, and Klaus Badelt.\n\nIn 2000, Zimmer scored the music for Gladiator (2000), for which he received an Oscar nomination, in addition to Golden Globe and Broadcast Film Critics Awards for his epic score. It sold more than three million copies worldwide and spawned a second album Gladiator: More Music From The Motion Picture, released on the Universal Classics/Decca label. Zimmer's other scores that year included Mission: Impossible II (2000), Der Weg nach El Dorado (2000), and Mit oder ohne - Was Männer haben sollten (2000), directed by Barry Levinson.\n\nSome of his other impressive scores include Pearl Harbor (2001), Ring (2002), four films directed by Ridley Scott; Tricks (2003), Hannibal (2001), Black Hawk Down (2001), and Thelma & Louise (1991), Penny Marshall's Unterwegs mit Jungs (2001), and Eine Klasse für sich (1992), Tony Scott's True Romance (1993), Tränen der Sonne (2003), Ron Howard's Backdraft - Männer, die durchs Feuer gehen (1991), Tage des Donners (1990), Fräulein Smillas Gespür für Schnee (1997), and the animated Spirit - Der wilde Mustang (2002) for which he also co-wrote four of the songs with Bryan Adams, including the Golden Globe nominated Here I Am.\n\nAt the 27th annual Flanders International Film Festival, Zimmer performed live for the first time in concert with a 100-piece orchestra and a 100-voice choir. Choosing selections from his impressive body of work, Zimmer performed newly orchestrated concert versions of Gladiator, Mission: Impossible II (2000), Rain Man (1988), Der König der Löwen (1994), and Der schmale Grat (1998). The concert was recorded by Decca and released as a concert album entitled \"The Wings Of A Film: The Music Of Hans Zimmer.\"\n\nIn 2003, Zimmer completed his 100th film score for the film The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, for which he received both a Golden Globe and a Broadcast Film Critics nomination. Zimmer then scored Nancy Meyers' comedy Was das Herz begehrt (2003), the animated Dreamworks film, Große Haie - Kleine Fische (2004) (featuring voices of Will Smith, Renée Zellweger, Robert De Niro, Jack Black, and Martin Scorsese), and Jim Brooks' Spanglish (2004) starring Adam Sandler and Téa Leoni (for which he also received a Golden Globe nomination). His 2005 projects include Paramount's The Weather Man (2005) starring Nicolas Cage, Dreamworks' Madagascar (2005), and the Warner Bros. summer release, Batman Begins (2005).\n\nZimmer's additional honors and awards include the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in Film Composition from the National Board of Review, and the Frederick Loewe Award in 2003 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. He has also received ASCAP's Henry Mancini Award for Lifetime Achievement. Hans and his wife live in Los Angeles and he is the father of four children.\n\nHoward Shore is a Canadian composer, born in Toronto. He was born in a Jewish family. He started studying music when 8-years-old, and played as a member of bands by the time he was 13-years-old. He was interested in a professional career in music as a teenager. He studied music at the Berklee College of Music, a college of contemporary music located in Boston.\n\nFor a few years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Shore was a member of Lighthouse, a jazz fusion band. In the 1970s, Shore mainly composed music for theatrical performances and a few television shows. His most notable work was composing the music for the one-man-act show of stage magician Doug Henning. He also served as a musical director in then-new television show \"Saturday Night Live\" (1975-). He was hired by the show's producer Lorne Michaels, who was a close friend of Shore since their teen years.\n\nIn 1978, Shore started his career as a film score composer, with scoring the B-movie \" I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses\" (1978). His next film score was composed for the horror film \"The Brood\" (1979). Shore had a good working relationship with the film's director David Cronenberg. Cronenberg would continue to use Shore as the composer of most of his films, with the exception of \"The Dead Zone\" (1983).\n\nIn the 1980s, Shore also composed the film scores of works by other directors, such as \"After Hours\" (1985) by Martin Scorsese, and \"Big\" (1988) by Penny Marshall. He received more acclaim for composing the film score for \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991), a major hit of its era. Shore was nominated for a BAFTA award for this film score.\n\nBy the 1990s, Shore was an established composer of high repute and worked in an ever increasing number of films. Among his better known works were the film scores for comedy film \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (1993) and crime thriller \"Seven\" (1995). Shore received even more critical acclaim in the 2000s, when he composed the film score for fantasy film \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001). He won an Academy Award and a Grammy for the film score, and received nominations for a BAFTA award and a Golden Globe.\n\nShore continued his career with the film scores of acclaimed films \"Gangs of New York\" (2002), \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002), and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003). He received his second Academy Award for the film score of \"The Return of the King\", and his third Academy Award as the composer of hit song \"Into the West\". He won several other major awards for these film scores. His film scores for \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy are considered the most famous and successful works of his career.\n\nFor the rest of the 2000s, Shore closely collaborated with director Martin Scorsese. Shore won a Golden Globe for the film score of Scorsese's \"The Aviator\" (2004). In the 2010s, Shore continues to work regularly, mostly known for composing film scores for works by directors David Cronenberg, Martin Scorsese, and Peter Jackson. He was the main composer for \"The Hobbit\" trilogy by Peter Jackson, and the fantasy film \"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse\" (2010) by David Slade.\n\nA child prodigy, Miklos Rózsa learned to play the violin at the age of five and read music before he was able to read words. In 1926, he began studying at the Leipzig Conservatory where he was considered a brilliant student. He obtained his doctorate in music in 1930. Moving to Paris the following year, Rózsa had much of his own chamber music performed, as well as his 'Variations on a Hungarian Peasant Song' and his 'Symphony and Serenade for Small Orchestra'. However, he soon became disenchanted with meagre wages for playing classical music in concert. Attempting to change his financial situation, Rózsa managed to secure a contract with Pathe records to compose music for use in intermissions between movies. This was to be his first step in entering the more lucrative field of film composition. In 1935, Rózsa went to London after being invited by the Hungarian Legation to write the music for a ballet. The resulting work, 'Hungaria', so impressed the director Jacques Feyder that he set up a meeting with fellow Hungarian Alexander Korda, who then commissioned him to write an opulent score for the romantic drama Tatjana (1937). Rózsa later recalled having to learn to write music for films 'the hard way': \"I bought one German and one Russian book on the technique of film music and everything I learned from these books was absolutely wrong! But then I had long conferences with Muir Mathieson, who was the music director and conductor for Korda, and somehow I learned.\"\n\nWhile writing the score for Der Dieb von Bagdad (1940), Rózsa relocated to Hollywood where he remained gainfully employed over the next four decades. An expert at orchestration and counterpoint with a great flair for the dramatic, he often concentrated on the psychological aspects of a film. One of his innovations was the use of a theremin for the famous dream sequence in Ich kämpfe um dich (1945) which accompanies Salvador Dalí's transcendental nightmare images. Few composers have managed to convey suspense and tension as powerfully as Rózsa with his eerily haunting scores for some of the Golden Era's best films noir (Frau ohne Gewissen (1944), Die seltsame Liebe der Martha Ivers (1946), Rächer der Unterwelt (1946), Stadt ohne Maske (1948)) or his lush, stirring music for spectacular epics (Quo vadis? (1951), Ivanhoe - Der schwarze Ritter (1952), El Cid (1961)). In addition to winning three Oscars for his film work, Rózsa also continued as a prolific composer of classical music, including Violin and Piano Concertos, a Concerto for String Orchestra, a Sinfonia Concertante and Notturno Ungherese (influenced, respectively, by Stravinsky and Bartók). In 1945, he was appointed Professor of Composition at the University of Southern California where also lectured on the subject for many years.\n\nThomas Newman is an American film score composer. He was born in Los Angeles. His father was notable film score composer Alfred Newman (1900-1970). The Newman family is of Russian-Jewish descent, and includes several other well-known musicians. Thomas' mother Martha Louis Montgomery (1920-2005) wanted her sons to have a musical education. Thomas attended regular lessons in violin as a child. An older Thomas received his musical education while attending the University of Southern California and Yale University. Thomas Newman graduated as Bachelor of Arts in 1977, and a Master of Music in 1978.\n\nThomas originally composed music for theatrical productions in Broadway, working with his mentor Stephen Sondheim. His uncle Lionel Newman asked him to compose music for the television series \"The Paper Chase\" (1978-1979, 1986), which was Thomas' first credit in a television production.\n\nIn the 1980s, Thomas first worked in film. Composer John Williams, a close family friend, hired Thomas to work in the music department for space opera film \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983). Thomas' main work in the film was orchestrating the music in a scene where character Darth Vader dies. Afterwards, Thomas was approached by film producer Scott Rudin and hired to work as a film score composer in his own right. His first work in the field was the film score of romantic drama \"Reckless\" (1984).\n\nWhile he worked regularly as a film score composer during the 1980s, Thomas reportedly felt he had to retrain himself for a hard and demanding job. It reportedly took him 8 years to not feel fraudulent in his efforts. In 1994, Thomas received his first Academy Award nominations, for the film scores of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994) and \"Little Women\" (1994). He lost the Award to rival composer Hans Zimmer, who had been nominated for the film score of the animated film \"The Lion King\" (1994).\n\nNewman was an established and increasingly famous composer in the 1990s. He received further Academy Award nominations, although he never actually won. Among his more notable works was the film score of the drama film \"American Beauty\" (1999), which earned Thomas both a Grammy and a BAFTA award. Newman had a good working relationship with the film's director Sam Mendes. Mendes has kept hiring Thomas as the composer for most of his films. The main exception being the comedy-drama film \"Away We Go\" (2009), which did not have a film score.\n\nIn the 2000s, Thomas continued working in high-profile films, such as \"Road to Perdition\" (2002), \"Finding Nemo\" (2003), and \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\". By 2006, he had been nominated eight times for an Academy Award, while never winning it. He started joking about his lack of victories in public.\n\nIn 2008, Thomas was nominated for two Academy Awards, for both the film score and an original song for the animated film \"WALL-E\" (2008). He won neither, though the hit song \"Down to Earth\" earned him a Grammy Award. He continues to work regularly in the 2010s. Among his more acclaimed works were the film scores for spy film \"Skyfall\" (2012) and period drama \"Saving Mr. Banks\" (2013). He has continued being nominated for Academy Awards. As of 2020, he has been nominated 15 times for the Academy Award. He is the most nominated living composer to have never actually won an Academy Award, tied with Alex North. He has won a total of 5 Grammy awards.\n\nJohn Barry was born in York, England in 1933, and was the youngest of three children. His father, Jack, owned several local cinemas and by the age of fourteen, Barry was capable of running the projection box on his own - in particular, The Rialto in York. As he was brought up in a cinematic environment, he soon began to assimilate the music which accompanied the films he saw nightly to a point when, even before he'd left St. Peters school, he had decided to become a film music composer. Helped by lessons provided locally on piano and trumpet, followed by the more exacting theory taught by tutors as diverse as Dr Francis Jackson of York Minster and William Russo, formerly arranger to Stan Kenton and His Orchestra, he soon became equipped to embark upon his chosen career, but had no knowledge of how one actually got a start in the business. A three year sojourn in the army as a bandsman combined with his evening stints with local jazz bands gave him the idea to ease this passage by forming a small band of his own. This was how The John Barry Seven came into existence, and Barry successfully launched them during 1957 via a succession of tours and TV appearances. A recording contract with EMI soon followed, and although initial releases made by them failed to chart, Barry's undoubted talent showed enough promise to influence the studio management at Abbey Road in allowing him to make his debut as an arranger and conductor for other artists on the EMI roster.\n\nA chance meeting with a young singer named Adam Faith, whilst both were appearing on astage show version of the innovative BBC TV programme, Six-Five Special (1957), led Barry to recommend Faith for a later BBC TV series, Drumbeat (1959), which was broadcast in 1959. Faith had made two or three commercially unsuccessful records before singer/songwriter Johnny Worth, also appearing on Drumbeat, offered him a song he'd just finished entitled What Do You Want? With the assistance of the JB7 pianist, Les Reed, Barry contrived an arrangement considered suited to Faith's soft vocal delivery, and within weeks, the record was number one. Barry (and Faith) then went from strength to strength; Faith achieving a swift succession of chart hits, with Barry joining him soon afterwards when the Seven, riding high on the wave of the early sixties instrumental boom, scored with Hit & Miss, Walk Don't Run and Black Stockings.\n\nFaith had long harboured ambitions to act even before his first hit record and was offered a part in the up and coming British movie, Heiss auf nackten Steinen (1960), at that time. As Barry was by then arranging not only his recordings but also his live Drumbeat material, it came as no surprise when the film company asked him to write the score to accompany Faith's big screen debut. It should be emphasised that the film was hardly a cinematic masterpiece. However, it did give Faith a chance to demonstrate his acting potential, and Barry the chance to show just how quickly he'd mastered the technique of film music writing. Although the film and soundtrack album were both commercial successes, further film score offers failed to flood in. On those that did, such as Gib niemals auf (1960) and The Amorous Prawn (1962), Barry proved highly inventive, diverse and adaptable and, as a result, built up a reputation as an emerging talent. It was with this in mind that Noel Rogers, of United Artists Music, approached him in the summer of '62, with a view to involving him in the music for the forthcoming James Bond film, James Bond 007 jagt Dr. No (1962).\n\nHe was also assisted onto the cinematic ladder as a result of a burgeoning relationship with actor/writer turned director Bryan Forbes, who asked him to write a couple of jazz numbers for use in a club scene in Forbes' then latest film, Das indiskrete Zimmer (1962). From this very modest beginning, the couple went on to collaborate on five subsequent films, including the highly acclaimed An einem trüben Nachmittag (1964), Sie nannten ihn King (1965) and Flüsternde Wände (1967). Other highlights from the sixties included five more Bond films, Zulu - Die Schlacht von Rorke's Drift (1964), Königin der Wildnis (1966) (a double Oscar), Der Löwe im Winter (1968) (another Oscar) and Asphalt-Cowboy (1969).\n\nIn the seventies he scored the cult film Walkabout - Der Traum vom Leben (1971), Das vergessene Tal (1971), Maria Stuart, Königin von Schottland (1971) (Oscar nomination), wrote the theme for Die 2 (1971), a musical version of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and the hit musical Billy. Then, in 1974, he made the decision to leave his Thameside penthouse apartment for the peace of a remote villa he was having built in Majorca. He had been living there for about a year, during which time he turned down all film scoring opportunities, until he received an invitation to write the score for the American TV movie, Eleanor and Franklin (1976). In order to accomplish the task, he booked into the Beverly Hills Hotel for six weeks in October 1975. However, during this period, he was also offered Robin Und Marian (1976) and King Kong (1976), which caused his stay to be extended. He was eventually to live and work in the hotel for almost a year, as more assignments were offered and accepted. His stay on America's West Coast eventually lasted almost five years, during which time he met and married his wife, Laurie, who lived with him at his Beverly Hills residence. They moved to Oyster Bay, New York and have since split their time between there and a house in Cadogan Square, London.\n\nAfter adopting a seemingly lower profile towards the end of the seventies, largely due to the relatively obscure nature of the commissions he accepted, the eighties saw John Barry re-emerge once more into the cinematic limelight. This was achieved, not only by continuing to experiment and diversify, but also by mixing larger budget commissions of the calibre of Heißblütig - Kaltblütig (1981), Das Messer (1985), Jenseits von Afrika (1985) (another Oscar) and Cotton Club (1984) with smaller ones such as the TV movies, Touched by Love (1980) and Obsession - Die dunkle Seite des Ruhms (1983). Other successes included: Ein tödlicher Traum (1980), Frances (1982), three more Bond films, and Peggy Sue hat geheiratet (1986).\n\nAfter serious illness in the late eighties, Barry returned with yet another Oscar success with Der mit dem Wolf tanzt (1990) and was also nominated for Chaplin - Das Leben der unsterblichen Filmlegende (1992). Since then he scored the controversial Ein unmoralisches Angebot (1993), Mein Leben für dich (1993), Der Tod lauert in Kairo (1992), Cry, the Beloved Country (1995) and has made compilation albums for Sony (Moviola and Moviola II) and non-soundtrack albums for Decca ('The Beyondness Of Things' & 'Eternal Echoes').\n\nIn the late nineties he made a staggeringly successful return to the concert arena, playing to sell-out audiences at the Royal Albert Hall. Since then he has appeared as a guest conductor at a RAH concert celebrating the life and career of Elizabeth Taylor and made brief appearances at a couple of London concerts dedicated to his music. In 2004 he re-united with Don Black to write his fifth stage musical, Brighton Rock, which enjoyed a limited run at The Almeida Theatre in London.\n\nHe continued to appear at concerts of his own music, often making brief appearances at the podium. In November 2007, Christine Albanel, the French Minister for Culture, appointed him Commander in the National Order of Arts and Letters. The award was made at the eighth International Festival Music and Cinema, in Auxerre, France, when, in his honour, a concert of his music also took place.\n\nIn August 2008 he was working on a new album, provisionally entitled Seasons, which he has described as \"a soundtrack of his life.\" A new biography, \"John Barry: The Man with The Midas Touch\", by Geoff Leonard, Pete Walker, and Gareth Bramley, was published in November 2008.\n\nHe died following a heart-attack on 30th January 2011, at his home in Oyster Bay, New York.\n\nMichel Legrand is a three-time Academy Award-winning French composer, conductor and pianist who composed over 200 film and television scores as well as recorded over a hundred albums of jazz, popular and classical music.\n\nHe was born on February 24, 1932, in Becon-les-Bruyeres, in the Paris suburbs, France. His father, Raymond Legrand, was a French composer and actor. His mother, Marcelle der Mikaelian, was descended from the Armenian bourgeousie. From 1942 - 1949 young Legrand studied piano at the Paris Conservatoire. There his teachers were Nadia Boulanger and Henri Challan among other renowned musicians. He received numerous awards for his skills in composition and piano and mastered a dozen other instruments. In 1947 he attended a concert by Dizzy Gillespie and caught a jazz bug. He started working as a pianist for major French singers. He eventually collaborated with Dizzy Gillespie on several albums and film scores.\n\nIn 1954 Legrand became an overnight star after his album \"I Love Paris\" became a hit, it went on selling over 8 million copies. He followed the success with such albums as \"Holiday in Rome\" (1955) and \"Michel Legrand Plays Cole Porter\" (1957). In 1958 he was invited to play at Moscow Festival of Students and Youth. There, in Moscow, he met his future wife, a young French model with who he went on to have three children.\n\nIn the late 1950s and 1960s Legrand was caught up in the French New Wave. He scored seven films for jean-Luc Godard, he also made ten films with Jacques Demy, and became responsible for creating the genre of musical in the French Cinema. In 1963 Legrand did Die Regenschirme von Cherbourg (1964), the first film musical that was entirely sung. For that film score he received three Oscar nominations. His beautiful, haunting melody, \"I Will Wait For You\", received nomination for Best Original Song.\n\nIn 1966 Legrand decided to take his chances in Hollywood, and moved to Los Angeles with his wife and three children. His friendship with Quincy Jones and Hank Mancini helped him a great deal, especially in meeting the lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman. In 1969 Legrand won his first Oscar for Best Music, Original Song for \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" and was also nominated for Best Music, Original score for a Motion Picture for Thomas Crown ist nicht zu fassen (1968). Eventually Legrand went on to become a star in the US, he received twelve nominations for Academy Awards, and won two more Oscars. He was also nominated for a Grammy 27 times and received 5 Grammys in the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Legrand continued giving live concerts with his own jazz trio. He also led his big band which he took on several international tours, accompanying such stars as Ray Charles , Diana Ross , Björk , and Stéphane Grappelli who celebrated his 85th birthday in 1992. He also recorded several classical albums, including an album with cross-genre hits entitled \"Kiri Sings Michel Legrand\" with the opera singer Kiri te Kanawa. During the 2000s Legrand has been working mainly in the studio, and also made several international tours.\n\nIn 2005 a compilation of Legrand's best known film soundtracks was released under the title \"Le Cinema de Michel Legrand\", featuring 90 songs composed in the course of his career."
