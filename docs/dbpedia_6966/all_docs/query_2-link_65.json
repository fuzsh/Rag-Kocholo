        "text": "Twilight\n\nZbigniew preisner, Music\n\ndominik wania, piano\n\nSTR006\n\nComing March 22nd is the new solo piano album TWILIGHT by famous Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner. Known for his many famous film scores from the scores to the Trois Couleurs series, The Secret Garden, and Dekalog (by Kieslowski) as well as his non-film works from his incredible REQUIEM FOR MY FRIEND and 10 EASY PIECES FOR PIANO, this new album featuring pianist Dominik Wania is classic Preisner. With an incredible gift for melody, these lyric pieces run through the gamut of emotion from nostalgia to achingly beautiful yet simple personal reflections."
