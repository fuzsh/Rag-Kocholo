As part of its reissue series focusing on Preisner's work with Kieslowski, Because Music presents a reissue of Preisner's score for Kieslowski's Three Colors: Blue (1993), the first film in Kieslowski's Three Colors Trilogy (BEC 5156047), preceding White (BEC 5156049) and Red (BEC 5156050). The trilogy is themed on the French Revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity; according to Kieslowski, the subject of Blue is liberty, specifically emotional liberty, rather than its social or political meaning. Blue stars Benoît Régent and Juliette Binoche, and received universal acclaim upon its release. Preisner's soundtrack is performed by the Sinfonia Varsovia and the Silesian Philharmonic choir, and includes pieces credited to fictional composer Van den Budenmayer.

As part of its reissue series focusing on Preisner's work with Kieslowski, Because Music presents a combined reissue of Preisner's scores for Kieslowski's Three Colors Trilogy, as a three-CD digipak box set. Three Colors: Blue (1993), Three Colors: White (1994), and Three Colors: Red (1994) are each loosely based on one of the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic (liberty, equality, fraternity), and have been interpreted respectively as an anti-tragedy, an anti-comedy, and an anti-romance. The films each received universal acclaim upon their respective releases, and Preisner's score for Red won the 1995 César Award for Best Music. All three soundtracks are performed by the Sinfonia Varsovia and the Silesian Philharmonic choir, and are each available individually on vinyl (Blue (BEC 5156048), White (BEC 5156049), Red (BEC 5156050)). Blue includes pieces credited to fictional composer Van den Budenmayer; Red opens with a performance by Zbigniew Zamachowski. Zbigniew Preisner has also worked with Jean Becker (on Élisa (1995), winner of the 1996 César Award for Best Music), Thomas Vinterberg (It's All About Love (2003)), and Claude Miller (Un secret (2007)).\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP+CD\n\nBEC 5156050\n\n2024 restock.

The trilogy is themed on the French Revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity; Red is about fraternity, which it examines by showing characters whose lives gradually become closely interconnected. Red stars Jean-Louis Trintignant and Irène Jacob, and received universal acclaim upon its release; Preisner's score, performed by the Sinfonia Varsovia and the Silesian Philharmonic choir, won the 1995 César Award for Best Music.
