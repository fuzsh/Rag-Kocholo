Given limited distribution during its initial release, the soundtrack's lustre has only strengthened and it is now considered a lost gem of contemporary chamber composition. An understated triumph of the oeuvre of Preisner, who closely collaborated with Polish director Krzysztof Kie?lowski and was responsible for the film scores of Dekalog, The Double Life of Véronique and the Three Colours trilogy.\n\n\"Krzysztof and Zbigniew really found each other, as they were deeply complementary in their need of emotional expression,\" reflects actor Juliette Binoche upon her work in Three Colours: Blue. A Colourful Storm cites no other film leaving a greater impact on them than Three Colours: Red. These would be the last films the duo worked on together, before Kieslowski's retirement and untimely death.\n\nEffroyable Jardins marks Preisner's post-Kieslowski era of solo composition, shifting from devotional harmonies into a beautifully restrained style of neo-Romanticism. It is his second soundtrack for Jean Becker, following Francis Ford Coppola's commission for The Secret Garden, the César-winning Élisa, and Edoardo Ponte's Between Strangers. Its leitmotif - a delicate, sparse melody for piano and organ, appears only during the opening sequence and, like Preisner's most powerful soundtracks, takes on a life of its own. Compositions for violin, harp and percussion are interspersed with haunting variations on a theme and a masterful use of silence. His music haunts the grieving Julie in Blue, soundtracks Valentine's epiphany in Red, and evokes the sublimity of moments in everyday life.\n\nMore\n\nbackorder\n\nLast in:09.10.2023\n\nLabel:Preisner Productions\n\nCat-No:PPLP004\n\nGenre:Electronic\n\nConfiguration:LP Excl\n\nBarcode:5903111904074\n\n1\n\nZbigniew Preisner & Lisa Gerrard - A1.

SHORT INFO:\n\nI can say that the album It's not too late has been created by chance.\n\nFew years ago together with Lisa Gerrard we visited synagogue in a small town hundred kilometres from Cracow, Bobowa. When we entered the synagogue Lisa started to sing. It appeared that the place had spine-tingling acoustics. I said then to Lisa: \" let's try to record something here\".\n\nThe rule was simple: I prepared themes and we recorded live performance. Lisa heard what I was playing for the first time during the recording and she improvised. We recorded nine compositions in 45 minutes. It supposed to be a holiday joy.\n\nSix years later I returned to the material we recorded and decided to finish it. What is left from the original recording is the voice of Lisa. I composed and recorded everything else in my studio. Dominik Wania played piano, Magdalena Pluta - cello and Jerzy G?owczewski- saxophone.\n\nThat's the way the album It's not too late came in to being.\n\nWe live in the most dangerous time since the Second World War.\n\nLisa Gerrard and I want to tell you about the world we share. Our weapon is music. It doesn't kill, it resurrects, and it brings hope to life.\n\nIt's not too late.\n\nZbigniew Preisner\n\nMore\n\nin stock\n\nLast in:27.06.2022\n\nCat-No:bewith103lp\n\nGenre:Soul/Funk\n\nConfiguration:LP Excl\n\nBarcode:4251804125383\n\n1\n\nIan Carr With Nucleus - Origins (2:57)\n\n2\n\nIan Carr With Nucleus - Bull Dance (8:17)\n\n3\n\nIan Carr With Nucleus - Ariadne (7:47)\n\n4\n\nIan Carr With Nucleus - Arena Part I (1:49)\n\n5\n\nIan Carr With Nucleus - Arena Part II (5:12)\n\n6\n\nIan Carr With Nucleus - Exultation (6:02)\n\n7\n\nIan Carr With Nucleus - Naxos (12:22)\n\nFormat Notes: 2022 re-issue, 140g vinyl, gatefold sleeve, remastered from the original tapes\n\nTerritories: Worldwide no restrictions\n\nTrack List:\n\nA1 : Origins (2:57)\n\nA2 : Bull Dance (8:17)\n\nA3 : Ariadne (7:47)\n\nA4 : Arena Part I (1:49)\n\nB1 : Arena Part II (5:12)\n\nB2 : Exultation (6:02)\n\nB3 : Naxos (12:22)\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nLabyrinth is dark, brooding, beat-heavy, melancholic mood music courtesy of Ian Carr and the Nucleus crew. A favourite of Madlib, it goes without saying that this is one magnificent record. Originally released on Vertigo in 1973, Labyrinth was never re-pressed and of course those original copies are now very tricky to score. Like all the Nucleus records, it’s aged ridiculously well and this Be With re-issue, re-mastered from the original analogue tapes, shows off just why this deserves to be back in press.\n\nGenius trumpeter and visionary composer Ian Carr was one of the most respected British musicians of his era. He was a true pioneer and saw the potential in fusing the worlds of jazz with rock, just as Miles Davis and The Tony Williams Lifetime did in the US. In late 1969, following the demise of the Rendell-Carr quintet, and tiring of British jazz, Carr assembled the legendary Nucleus. Regarding music as a continuous process, Nucleus refused to “recognise rigid boundaries” and worked on delivering what they saw as a “total musical experience”. We can get behind that.\n\nUnder bandleader Carr, Nucleus existed as a fluid line-up of inventive, skilled musicians. This constant evolution and revolution was all part of the continuous musical exploration and discovery that took jazz to new levels. And the music has kept relevant. To steal a line from a recent review of our re-issue of Roots, when it comes to anything Nucleus “it’s basically already hip-hop”.\n\nAt this point Carr had parted ways with guitarist Alan Holdsworth and as a result the Nucleus sound found itself returning to the core elements of groove and melody. Carr had become bolder and more self-confident in his compositions and it shows in the sheer ambition of Labyrinth. Composed by Carr, and with lyrics written by his wife Sandy, Labyrinth was the result of a commission from the Park Lane Group and funded by the Arts Council of Great Britain. Originally a live performance by an augmented Nucleus, some of the expanded cast were brought back for the recording sessions, including vocalist Norma Winstone. So as the front cover of the finished album says, this is literally “Nucleus Plus”.\n\nLabyrinth is presented as a suite, based on the ancient Greek legend of the Minotaur with musical instruments representing the various elements of the mythology. According to the LP’s original sleeve notes, the bass clarinet represents the tragic element, the trumpet represents the heroic element and the voice represents the human element. The rest of the musicians represent the two societies of Athens and Crete and their comments on the story as it unfolds.\n\nThe album opens with the experimental, sumptuously dissonant “Origins”. Teasing strands of atmospheric bass clarinet introduce the first theme before swiftly fading out with a startling blast of staccato fanfares and big drums. Heavy. The album soon finds its rhythm as it alights on the spell-binding and groove-friendly “Bull-Dance”, showing off the best Nucleus has to offer: subtle trumpet melodies, compelling rhythms, a psych-rock vibe and tight soloing. And of course there’s Norma Winstone’s stunning wordless vocals, that also take the lead in the next track “Ariadne”, a spacey-jazz song with beautiful piano, flute and clarinet, and the only recognisable lyrics on the album. You might recognise a snatch of it being looped by Madlib on Quasimoto’s “Astro Travellin”. The first part of the improvised “Arena” closes out the first side of the album, a short experimental piece with piano and horns.\n\nOver on the flip-side, the powerful second part of “Arena” introduces a new theme. It swiftly builds, with vocal melodies, piano and horns all pronounced over the thick drums snapping your neck. It comes on like an alternate take on “Bull-Dance”, noisier, with a looser rhythm. The triumphant, shuffling Latin-jam “Exultation” leans on more scintillating vocals from Winstone, and a chunky counter melody from the rhythm section. It’ll get you moving.\n\nThe final track, the haunting, twelve minute “Naxos”, is an incredible way to close out this remarkable record. A circling bass guitar loop inspiring the group to a meditative psychedelic jazz rock improvisation in a silent, Miles kind of way, with a great flugelhorn solo from Carr and an ace synth climax.\n\nThis Be With edition of Labyrinth has been re-mastered from the original Vertigo master tapes, Simon Francis’ mastering working together with Pete Norman’s cut to weave their usual magic with these wonderful recordings. Another great Keith Davis sleeve has been restored in all its airbrushed Golden Age of comics, gatefold splendour. Complete with Minotaur of course.\n\nMore\n\nin stock\n\nLast in:12.06.2024\n\nCat-No:WRJ002CD\n\nGenre:Electronic\n\nConfiguration:CD Excl\n\nBarcode:4260544823732\n\n1\n\nRyo Fukui - Mellow Dream\n\n2\n\nRyo Fukui - My Foolish Heart\n\n3\n\nRyo Fukui - Baron Potato Blues\n\n4\n\nRyo Fukui - What's New\n\n5\n\nRyo Fukui - Horizon\n\n6\n\nRyo Fukui - My Funny Valentine\n\nTerritory - NO Sales to Japan\n\nRyo Fukui's 1977 highly sought-after jazz gem MELLOW DREAM in a Deluxe Limited Edition 2018 Reissue CD\n\nWe Release Jazz (WRWTFWW Records' new sister-label) is thrilled to present the official reissue of criminally overlooked Japanese jazz gem Mellow Dream (1977) by Hokkaido pianist wunderkind Ryo Fukui, released in conjunction with the its legendary predecessor Scenery, sourced from the original masters and available on limited edition 180g vinyl mastered at half speed for audiophile sound as and on digipack CD.\n\nFirmly standing on the foundation he laid down with Scenery, Ryo Fukui continues his exploration of modal, bop and cool jazz sounds with meticulous grace and absolute mastery. As its title suggests, Mellow Dream ventures into slightly mellower, more soulful, and sometimes more contemplative territories (the Bill Evans-reminiscent \"Mellow Dream\" and \"My Foolish Heart\") while still packing the commanding punch Fukui's work is loved for, as heard on the amazingly bombastic \"Baron Potato Blues\" or the gigantic McCoy Tyner/John Coltrane-influenced \"Horizon\" which sees each member of the trio (Satoshi Denpo is on bass and Yoshinori Fukui is on drums) demonstrating their virtuosity for 9 exhilarating minutes. With his sophomore album, Ryo Fukui swings from melancholy to vibrant joy with ease, reminding us that jazz is best served with a pinch of blues, and displays an immensely rare combination of pure talent, unique personal approach and focused discipline. The man undeniably deserves a spot in the pantheon of all-time great jazz pianists.\n\nAfter releasing the outstanding Scenery and Mellow Dream back to back, Ryo Fukui worked on developing his live skills, often performing at Sapporo's Slowboat Jazz Club (which he co-founded with his wife Yasuko Fukui), and even releasing 2 live albums. He sadly passed away in March 2016, leaving behind a legacy of works that all jazz lovers should explore.\n\nTracklisting CD\n\n01 Mellow Dream\n\n02 My Foolish Heart\n\n03 Baron Potato Blues\n\n04 What's New\n\n05 Horizon\n\n06 My Funny Valentine\n\nMore\n\nin stock\n\nLast in:30.05.2024\n\nLabel:Mute\n\nCat-No:STUMM508\n\nGenre:Techno\n\nConfiguration:LP Excl\n\nBarcode:5400863148829\n\n1\n\nTerence Fixmer - Test of the Times\n\n2\n\nTerence Fixmer - In Synthesis\n\n3\n\nTerence Fixmer - Razor Sharp\n\n4\n\nTerence Fixmer - Dark Enough?\n\n5\n\nTerence Fixmer - Another End\n\n6\n\nTerence Fixmer - Paroxysm\n\n7\n\nTerence Fixmer - Shore Break\n\n8\n\nTerence Fixmer - Ephemere\n\n9\n\nTerence Fixmer - Evolve\n\n10\n\nTerence Fixmer - Close to You\n\n11\n\nTerence Fixmer - Void Machiner\n\n12\n\nTerence Fixmer - Glacier\n\nTerritory: WW-UK/EIRE & USA,Canada\n\nLimited Edition 12\"LP 6 track album sampler/\n\nIncludes audio download code for the full-length album\n\nWorldwide numbered limited edition of 500\n\n12\" TRACKLIST\n\nA1 Ephemere\n\nA2 In Synthesis\n\nA3 Evolve\n\nB1 Shore Break\n\nB2 Glacier\n\nB3 Dark Enough?\n\nAUDIO DOWNLOAD TRACKLIST\n\n1 Test of the Times\n\n2 In Synthesis\n\n3 Razor Sharp\n\n4 Dark Enough?\n\n5 Another End\n\n6 Paroxysm\n\n7 Shore Break\n\n8 Ephemere\n\n9 Evolve\n\n10 Close to You\n\n11 Void Machinery\n\n12 Glacier\n\nABOUT\n\nTerence Fixmer continues to establish himself as a driving force in the innovative techno and electronic music scene with the release of THE PARADOX IN ME, available via Mute and NovaMute.\n\nThis limited edition 12\" serves as an accompanying piece to Fixmer's brand-new album.
