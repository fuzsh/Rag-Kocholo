        "text": "As we witness the collapse of the neoliberal consensus and the subsequent rise of authoritarian 'strong men' and xenophobic nationalisms across the globe, the capitalist hegemony that was consolidated by the neoliberal project remains very much intact. In pursuit of a sane alternative to this post-neoliberal world order this article proposes love as a key concept for political theory/philosophy and for performing a central role in the revolutionary transformation of contemporary global capitalism. Through a close reading of the works of Emma Goldman and Michael Hardt, and specifically their own pursuit of a political concept of love I draw on, and make links with contemporary ideas of love as a political concept for radical social transformation in the twenty-first century. I argue that new love-based political subjectivities, practices, and group formations offer exciting opportunities for a reimagining of the frame within which an alter-globalisation can occur, and link theory to praxis by introducing an ongoing Collective Visioning project which illuminates a new post-capitalist, post-patriarchal, post-colonial, and post-anthropocentric synergetic politics grounded in revolutionary love.\n\nSince time immemorial, it has been romanticised that love happens the moment you meet someone at the right place and at the right time. There is also the notion that love is a force powerful enough to transcend the bounds of space and time. Memory fuels love. Photographs are taken to look back at the good times, and anniversaries are celebrated to look forward to the goal of making love last forever. But when timelessness and placelessness enter the picture, love becomes a leap of faith, and inevitably, the beginning and ending of everything. La ​ Jetée ​ is the story of a man who witnesses and experiences the beginning and ending of everything. As a little boy, at the pier, he watches airplanes taking flight. World War III is about to break out, and the last two images he sees before this is the face of a beautiful woman and a man being killed right before him. Soon after, the world was destroyed by radioactivity, forcing survivors to live underground, with the less fortunate ones being taken as prisoners. The child, now a man, is one of these prisoners. Because of his vivid memories, he is chosen to go back to the past. He is told that the human race is doomed. Space is off-limits, and the only link to survival passed through time. He is sent to the past, where he indeed finds survival, not in the form of food, medicine and energy, but in the form of love. He meets a woman, and in and out of time, they spend moments together. Then, he gets plunged into the future, whose people give him a power source that could save his present world. Facing execution back in his own time, the people of the future offer him a place in their time, but he instead chooses to return to the past, to look for the love he would dare not lose. He is transported to the pier by the airport, where he sees the woman he loves. He runs towards her, but is killed by someone from his time\n\nInto what, precisely, do we plum-met when we fall into love? What, exactly, is produced when we makeit? When we are hungry for love, what stomach is nourished by that strange food? Colloquialisms are littered with a lan-guage that objectifies love, that turns it into a thing—not just something we can feel, but something we can touch, some-thing that hits us, changes us, throws us, consumes us, drives us. Popular parlance makes the love relation into something almost tangible, concrete, autonomous: love is some thing we fall into, love is a master key, love is a war, love is a bite of heaven, love is a virus. Such language begins to suggest that the &quot;love object&quot; is not, exactly, the person for whom you pine. Instead, it begins to look as though the &quot;love object&quot; is the relation, itself. Love takes on thing-like contours, becomes its own sort of creature. It does its own little cosmic dance."
