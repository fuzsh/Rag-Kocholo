        "text": "The Secret Garden\n\nHow does magic transfer to film?\n\nI watched the film, The Secret Garden *1, which is a British film produced in 1993, directed by Agnieszka Holland, and is based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The story takes place at Misselthwaite Manor, on the North Yorkshire moors and it is a beautiful film, with a strong sense of magic within it. It begins with Mary Lennox who arrives from India after her parents die in an earthquake and she goes to live at her uncle’s house. Her uncle lost his wife (the identical twin sister to Mary’s mother) in the garden at Misselthwaite Manor, which got closed off for 10 years before Mary discovered it again. On her first day of arriving, she finds a secret passage leading from her room to her aunt’s room, which reminded her of her mother’s room. Mary saw an atmosphere of gloom, like the house was ‘dead’ and life in the house had disappeared after her aunt had died. In her aunt’s room, she found a large key sitting in a drawer of a jewellery box on the dressing table. The key was the opening to the secret garden.\n\nThe film is full of poetry, a story that flows from one fragment to the next, which leaves you thoughtful and touched. Touched by the magic of how Mary brings joy, life and love back into her uncle and cousin, Colin’s lives. There is a realistic magic about it – a story about the survival of a family facing certain problems around 1911. Yet, with the use of detailed elements, there is also an air of mystery and even of secret. The film is composed with elements of music, sound, lighting, composition and form. These elements, which I will explain further help me to understand how magic is created. The music by Zbigniew Preisner is sensitive and plays such an important role in supporting the story and consequently, the magic. There is an element too, of romance, imagination, and poetry. I think poetry is really important here because this relates to how the film captures the viewer’s emotion:\n\n“Poetry is an awareness of the world, a particular way of relating to reality”\n\n(Tarkovsky 1986, 21) *2\n\nIn The Secret Garden, the film director, Agnieszka Holland, creates a vision of Mary’s world and how she touches Misselthwaite with a magic. Holland uses particular elements, with a poetry of images, to produce a rhythm of feelings for the viewer. This poetry is a way for the viewer to sense an awareness and relate to Mary and her family’s world. We enter the magic of Mary’s world.\n\nWhat are these elements in the film that create the magical sense?\n\nWhy do they create a magical sense?\n\nThere is a very descriptive way in which atmosphere is created. On her first trip to the garden, it is a gloomy, frosty morning. There is a bonfire, where smoke is creating a fog and dead leaves are on the ground. This composition is symbolic, representing a world bereft of life and, as a viewer, you can sense this atmosphere. Magic begins to occur when a rising wind blows ivy and this catches Mary’s attention. Behind is a wall and Mary gets curious about a garden being inside. A robbin follows her, and sings to her, showing her the way to the door of the secret garden. From there, she collects the key from her aunt’s room and returns to open the door to the garden.\n\nInside she finds a deadened world: A garden over-grown, and a swirling mist, which heightens the mystery of what she might find inside. However, underneath the existent world, she finds hope of new life where there are some bulbs. Outside she meets a local boy, Dicken who can talk to animals and is the brother of Martha, a maid at the Manor. He becomes a good friend and helps Mary to build the garden back to life. One day when her uncle returns for a week to the Manor, Mary meets him and he is struck by his memories of how she resembles her own mother, and consequently, his wife. Mary asks him for earth and seeds to grow ‘things’ and he allows this.\n\nOne night she meets her cousin Colin by accident, who she finds by following his cries. Never walked, been out of bed or seen daylight, everyone thinks him a cripple, but through building a friendship with her cousin, Mary discovers that he is not ill, merely weak. As part of the film’s magic, Mary slowly brings Colin to life and one day in early summer, she takes him to see his mother’s garden, the ‘secret garden’.\n\nThere is more magic when the viewer is shown a series of images to convey the growth of their secret garden. As viewers, we are shown growing buds, butterflies bursting from their cocoons, and growing bluebells, daffodils, lillies, roses and irises. This represents the transformation of new life and the magic that takes place at Misselthwaite Manor. As summer approaches, magic enfolds as Colin visits the garden more, and builds his strength. When he takes his first step, sunlight beams across the garden and it is in full bloom with: trees, leaves, doves, birds singing, a squirrel, fox, more geese, and fawns. The setting is soft and romantic with the warm, summary light, petals being blown in the wind. All these elements displayed in the film contain a poetry, and a fantasy through its magic. It shows the symbolism of how life can grow again, and touches the heart of the viewer. The viewer’s mind is enchanted by the aura of the film that is being presented to them:\n\n‘Literature and cinema would be devoid of their power of enchantment without our capacity to enter a remembered or imagined place. The spaces and places enticed by a work of art are real in the full sense of the experience’.\n\n(Pallasmaa, 2012, p.74) *3\n\nWe are constantly surrounded by our experience of memories and when we watch a film or read a novel we are transported into our imagination or back to an experienced memory. Through interacting with this work of art, the viewer becomes part of it and they project their own emotions. In a film, the viewer has an interaction with the fragment of images being presented, where imagination is created with our emotions. Our memory plays with sound, smell, taste and touch and the viewer brings these elements to the experience and this is what helps to keep our minds enchanted. A multi-sensory experience is important in interior spaces and it could be that the space evokes memory and imagination to the occupiers. Like film, architecture and interior design contain an atmosphere, through the occupier’s memory and imagination, and their feelings are projected into the space.\n\nWhy was watching The Secret Garden important for my research?\n\nIt was a way to see how the essence of magic is used in another creative discipline. Also, film-making is similar to creating an interior design inside an existing space: both use elements to create a world for the viewer to connect with. They both project lived spaces and through particular elements, an atmosphere is formed; and for those experiencing the space, they then articulate an emotional response to it. The difference being that film-makers create fragments of images and architects/interior designers create fragments of a building. In relation to The Secret Garden, it helps me to become more aware of this concept, with the element of magic being projected at the forefront. When designing my interior space, it might be worth considering this further… to appreciate how the elements I use to create an atmosphere with an essence of magic, might affect the sensory experience of those occupying the space.\n\nFrom here, start contextualising my research ideas, taking a step back and organising these into possible design ideas and lines of enquiry.\n\nReferences\n\n*1 Holland, Agnieszka; Burnett, Frances Hodgson (1993) The Secret Garden, Warner\n\n*2 Tarkovsky, Andrei (1986) ‘The Poetics of Image’, in Juhani Pallasma (ed.)
