        "text": "It was love at first sight. The glorious white dress worn by Winona Ryder (who, as we all know, played Jo March in the best film version of Little Women ever made) was clearly a moment of pure inspiration to my eyes. I strongly declared to myself, that one day, I would recreate it so that I might run through airy fields and wander in an ever deepening forest. And as of late, I am happily able to say that I’ve done all three of those things!\n\nFirst, here are photos of the original dress, designed by Colleen Atwood:\n\nLittle Women, 1994. Costumes designed by Colleen Atwood.\n\nIf someone were to ask me how I made it, I would justifiably tell them, “I don’t really know.” I hand draped it piece by piece until it looked right, then sewed it together and voila! I didn’t use a pattern for any of the pieces (half because I couldn’t find any to use, the other half because I despise patterns). The sheer white fabric, I found on a four-foot roll at a thrift shop for $8. The under petticoat cotton was from Joann’s on sale for around $12. The blue ribbon was $4, and lastly the four buttons I used for the front closure and the cuffs, I already had. So in total, the entire dress cost was only $24 and about 10 hours of work. Some of the smaller areas, like the cuffs and front ruffles, I sewed by hand, but the rest was done by machine (except for the hem, because the sheer fabric is VERY thin and I didn’t want an ugly puckered line going around the bottom). I also purposely double hemmed it, making it too short so I wouldn’t get it dirty when I inevitably explored the countryside. If I ever want it longer, all I have to do is snip one thread and I easily gain two more inches at the bottom.\n\nOnce it was finally complete, I trekked to my favorite Civil War battlefield and lived out an entire day as Jo March. It was wonderful, until I realized the swarm of tics and crickets attached to my skirts! Nevertheless, such bothers can be quickly remedied. It was a magical day of seemingly endless joy and adventure. Sometimes it feels as though ordinary life is just the time we spend in between our last fairytale day and our next.\n\nCarrying around my leather-bound copy of Charles Dickon’s Pickwick Papers made me feel like Jo all the more!\n\nThe dress was designed to mimic what we call a “chemise a la reine” or a “gaulle,” made popular by Marie Antoinette. So, give or take a few minor changes, this dress works for both the 18th and 19th centuries. Just change the ribbon, throw on an oversized straw hat with flowers and feathers, and you’re ready to step into another century! I’d say this style is a true classic in the category that is historical attire, with as much versatility as any other piece of clothing I can think of!\n\nThe post would never be complete without a mandatory dress spinning shot.\n\nOut of all the literary characters to exist in the world, I think that I connect with Jo March more than any other, even more than Anne Shirley or Lizzy Bennet, I’d say. Jo and I are both writers, we like to wear the same things, we have three other siblings, we’re both the second eldest, and we think very much alike. So, I’m glad that this dress was my first film recreation project, the first among many to come!\n\n………………..\n\nWhich film costume would you want to recreate most?\n\nWhat film has your favorite costumes in it of all time?\n\nCan you guess what costume project I’m working on next?!\n\nLeave a comment!\n\n……………….\n\nMegan Joy\n\nForget my last post. THIS, apparently is what brought me back to blogging: the need to rant about yet another version of my precious Little Women, which has somehow found its way onto the big screen, again. Yes, a new film was released around two weeks ago, claiming to represent the beloved Louisa May Alcott work about four sisters and their coming of age story. Just how many versions of this story can be made, one may ask? Well, if you were to include silent films, theatrical plays, musicals, operas, radio programs, tv shows, and films, there would be a grand total of 20 documented versions of Little Women.\n\nYou may have read my post on the PBS’s Masterpiece version that was released just last year, and I’ve promised myself that I won’t be as harsh with this one. . . if at all possible. I’m sure we can all agree that Gillian Armstrong’s 1994 version of Little Women has for certain, risen above all other attempts and that Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March were represented extremely well by Trini Alvarado, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Kirsten Dunst, and it stands to reason that there will never be a better Laurie than young Christian Bale.\n\nNow, after watching the film trailer, which can be found on YouTube, I’ve decided not to pay thirteen dollars to see this new version in theater because I would surely disrupt it for other viewers as I stand upon my seat screaming “That’s not historically correct!” or “That’s not even in the book!” After all, you can have all the best lighting, sets, color grading, and visual effects, but those things don’t really compete with the way the actual story of Little Women is told, and how the dialog and costumes are used to make us truly believe we’re in the middle of the Civil War.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe you’ve seen this new take on the book and found it enjoyable? That’s completely fine! Remember this is only me sharing my personal opinion. However, I did notice a few things in the official 3-minute-long trailer which at this moment has half a million views. Here’s what I noticed:\n\n0:12 – We see four sister walking down a snowy street, two without any hats or bonnets (historically inaccurate). They also look a little homeless, but maybe I’m just too picky?\n\n0:23 – We hear Amy tell her sisters that she wants to be the best artist in the world. Is it just me or does she seem older than all the sisters, and not the youngest child in the family? Why didn’t they find a younger actress to play ten-year-old Amy instead of trying to fool us out of knowing that the actress is actually twenty-three years old in real life?\n\n0:57 – Jo’s at a party with her hair down. How did she get away with that? Quite shocking if you were to ask any historical reenactress today.\n\n1:23 – It sounds like Jo is trying to convince Meg that they should run away from home? What?\n\n1:32 – Ok, what in the world were they thinking? It’s Meg’s wedding day and she appears to be wearing something perhaps more fitting for the 1970s rather than 1870s, with her hair DOWN, uncurled, and with a side part (very historically inaccurate). With a budget of $40 million dollars, couldn’t they have hired someone who knew a little something about the standards of 1860s-1870s beauty? It’s her wedding day and is looking as though she forgot to wake up in time to do her hair. All throughout the trailer in fact, we see side parts and either straight or beach wavy hair, down about their shoulders and not up where it should be while in public, historically.\n\n1:43 – Why is Jo burning her own writing? What happened to that being Amy’s trademark?\n\n2:00 – Here is a staircase full of women presumedly at the Moffat party, perhaps? Ten girls dressed in basically the same dress, only each in a different pastel color with matching elbow length gloves, (not actually in fashion during the Civil War). It reminds me of a Disney cartoon/fairytale, instead of a historical drama in the way that each dress is the same. But that is only my personal opinion, of course. I also want to mention that I DID see many historically accurate gowns and outfits in the trailer that were quite beautiful in fact, ones that I absolutely cannot complain about.\n\n2:29 – Jo is fashioned in a man’s jacket and derby. That would have been almost as strange to the people of New York in the 1870s as a man in a dress, literally. Yes, we all know Jo is a tomboy, but I doubt she would actually get away with that in public and not be harshly questioned for it.\n\nWhat also riled me was that along with this new movie comes the selling of a book that a few people I know have bought. The front cover is a photo from the new film and inside are more pictures of the same. What I want to know is: Is this book the original book, or it is the 2019 adaptation that changes the plot to match Greta Gerwig’s script? Because, after reading a few articles, I know that not only little changes were made, but big ones too, like the ending. Emma Thompson, screenwriter and co-star of Sense and Sensibility 1995 once wrote in her production journal, “The Sense and Sensibility Screenplay and Dairies” that she strongly rejected the idea to republish Jane Austen’s book as a “novelisation” adapted to match Thompson’s screenplay, and sell it as the real thing. She said the idea was revolting, meaning that if someone wanted to read Sense and Sensibility, they should read Austen’s original work. I must agree with our dear Emma.\n\nLittle Women 2019, which stars a slew of famous names, has been spoken of well by film critics (but we all know that means almost nothing) and was already nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, Saoirse Ronan for Best Actress and Alexandre Desplat for Best Original Score. Now, I’ve done some little detective work and have found the following interesting facts:\n\nWinona Ryder was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress as Jo March in 1994 but lost to Jessica Lange for Blue Sky.\n\nThomas Newman was nominated for Best Original Score in 1994 but lost to Hans Zimmer for The Lion King.\n\nThe great Colleen Atwood was nominated for Best Costume Design in 1994 but lost to Tim Chappel for a movie I’ve never even heard of.\n\nLittle Women, 1994 budget was $18 million dollars. Little Women, 2019 budget was $40 million dollars.\n\nNow for a few more recent facts about the 77th Golden Globe Awards, held on January 5th, 2020:\n\nChristian Bale (Laurie, Little Women, 1994) was nominated for Best Actor in Ford vs. Ferrari.\n\nThomas Newman (score composer, Little Women, 1994) was nominated for Best Original Score in 1917 and was against Alexandre Desplat who wrote the new score for the 2019 Little Women.\n\nKirsten Dunst (Young Amy, Little Women, 1994) was nominated for Best Actress in a Television Series.\n\nNone of these nominations ended up winning last night, but I did see that both Thomas Newman and Kirsten Dunst were at the awards on Sunday night, (no Christian Bale though). Now, I was thinking. What do Christian, Thomas, and Kirsten, who are all heavily connected to the previous Little Women think about this new production? What do the rest of the cast and crew think? Do they think it was time for a remake, or are they like me and not ready for a new take on this beloved story?\n\nMaybe I’m a little sour over this whole ordeal, but what else am I to think while feeling as though the book has been ripped from my hands, cut up, pasted back together with modernly crafted glue, plastered with an unknown photo from a film, stripped from its universally known ending, then released to the entire world to accept as once before? What do you think? Please let me know! I want to hear any and all opinions!\n\n………………..\n\nHave you seen this 2019 version? Am I dreadfully wrong not to see it and yet criticize it?\n\nShould I stop this continuous ranting of movies I don’t like? (Insert mysterious pirate accent here: Because I hear tell there be a trailer for a “Secret Garden” remake that I feel the need to tear apart, being a strong believer in the treasure that is the 1993 version, arrgg!)\n\n………………..\n\nMegan Joy\n\nSome movies are funny, others are meaningful. Some are full of adventure while others are bursting with songs. Whatever the case, movies are one thing we can look to when we want to explore another world, another time, another place. Films are such a powerful tool. They can make us have a dozen different feelings and let us think about hundreds of different things. Movies take us to the places we want to go when we are confined to our own world. For an hour or two we can live inside a fairytale or voyage to a faraway land. The possibilities are indeed endless. That’s why I love movies that are not only fun to watch at the time, but actually impact my real life. So here is a list of my favorite ten movies beginning with number ten!\n\n(Warning! I may add a few “fun facts” being a crazy fan of all these films. If you don’t find them as fascinating as I did: sorry.)\n\n……………………………………………….\n\n10. The Happiest Millionaire\n\n1967 – Starring Fred MacMurray, Tommy Steele, Lesley Ann Warren, John Davidson, and Greer Garson. Music written by the Sherman Brothers.\n\nSet in 1916, this movie is based on the true story of the Drexel-Biddle family of Philadelphia. It received an Academy Award for costume design; more than 3,000 costumes were required for the film. This is also the last Disney film in which Walt Disney had direct involvement, as he died during the production.\n\n9. Mary Poppins\n\n1964 – Starring Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, Matthew Garber, Karen Dotrice, Glynis Johns, Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher, and Jane Darwell. Music written by the Sherman Brothers.\n\nAdapted from the P.L. Travers’ books, this movie is a Disney classic, receiving 13 Academy Award nominations. It would be hard to find someone who has never heard of Mary Poppins as it is thought of as possibly the greatest Disney film ever made. Walt Disney attempted to buy the story rights from Mrs. Travers back in 1936, but was rejected by the author because she believed no one could live up to her book.\n\n8. The Apple Dumpling Gang\n\n1975 – Starring Don Knotts, Tim Conway, Bill Bixby, Harry Morgan, Susan Clark, Clay O’Brian, Stacy Manning, and Brad Savage. Music written by Shane Tatum.\n\nAnother Disney film, this time set during the late California Gold Rush. This western comedy has everything one would hope for, jam-packed in 100 minutes. There is one scene in which Tim Conway and Don Knotts create the most hilarious improvisational skit, made up completely on the spot. It is said that while shooting the scene, many of the crew members had to leave the soundstage because they were laughing too loudly.\n\n7. The Music Man\n\n2003 – Starring Matthew Broderick, Kristen Chenoweth, Victor Garber, Molly Shannon, Cameron Monaghan, Debra Monk, and David Aaron Baker. Music written by Meredith Wilson.\n\nThis is the most recent adaptation of the original Broadway musical first performed in the 1950s. You have to listen to the song lyrics closely to hear the best parts of the movie. The original film included Robert Preston, Shirley Jones, Buddy Hackett, and Ron Howard. If you love musicals, humor, and Broadway, the 2003 version is just for you!\n\n6. The Horse in the Grey Flannel Suit\n\n1963 – Starring Dean Jones, Kurt Russell, Diane Baker, Ellen Janov, Fred Clark, and Morey Amsterdam. Music written by George Bruns.\n\nBased on the 1955 book by Eric Hatch, this film is especially for horse-lovers. It’s about a girl who wants a horse of her own and gets one (I know, cliché and frustrating for us horseless horse-lovers). Dean Jones, a favorite actor of mine, plays the girl’s horse-allergy inflicted father. Jones was known for his pretend sneezing and also used that skill in 1965 for Disney’s That Darn Cat, co-starring Haley Mills.\n\n5. Just Around the Corner\n\n1938 – Starring Shirley Temple, Bill Robinson, Charles Farrell, Franklin Pangborn, Joan Davis, Benny Bartlett, and Claude Billingwater. Music written by Harold Spina.\n\nThis is my favorite Shirley Temple film. Set during the Great Depression, Shirley Temple plays the daughter of a wealthy architect. She comes home from her girls’ school to find that her penthouse is now inhabited by another family, and her new apartment is now the basement. The slump in business has caused her father to lose nearly everything. In one scene, Shirley gives a little dog a bath. In reality, it’s her own dog, Ching Ching. Shirley charged the studio a total of $7.50 to use her dog in the film as an extra. She was certainly a good business woman!\n\n4. Hot Lead and Cold Feet\n\n1978 – Starring Jim Dale, Don Knotts, Darren McGavin, Karen Valentine, John Williams, Michael Sharrett, and Debbie Lytton. Music written by Buddy Baker.\n\nThis Disney western tale has an amazing cast. Jim Dale stars as all three main characters, Eli, Wild Billy, and Old Man Bloodshy. It’s the story of two twins racing to win their (supposedly deceased) father’s inheritance. Don Knotts and Darren McGavin appear together again in this film, the first time being in No Deposit, No Return, 1976. One of the two trains used in this film is today on display in Disneyland in California.\n\n3. The Secret Garden\n\n1993 – Starring Kate Maberly, Maggie Smith, Heydon Prowse, Andrew Knott, John Lynch, and Laura Crossely. Music written by Zbigniew Preisner.\n\nAdapted from the Frances Hodgson Burnett classic, this film holds some of the most magical scenes. The costumes, the acting, the cast, the story, the score, and the cinematography are put together perfectly to create the chronicles of Mary Lennox, an orphaned girl sent to live in her uncle’s mansion in Victorian England. She soon becomes aware of her crippled cousin, steals a mysterious garden, and combines the two in order to bring happiness back to Misselthwaite Manor.\n\n2. Little Women\n\n1994 – Starring Winona Ryder, Trini Alvarado, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, Susan Sarandon, Christian Bale, Gabriel Byrne, Eric Stoltz, and Mary Wickes. Music written by Thomas Newman.\n\nTaking place during and after the American Civil War, this is the story based upon the Louisa May Alcott book, Little Women. The four March sisters are growing up without their father who has gone off to war. The enchanting and heart-warming/wrenching tale brings history to life, causing the viewer to embrace the March sisters’ world and all its plights. This movie holds the most powerful score, it melts my heart whenever I hear it, time after time.\n\n1. Anne of Green Gables\n\n1985 – Starring Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst, Richard Farnsworth, Jonathan Crombie, Schuyler Grant, Patricia Hamilton, and Marilyn Lightstone. Music written by Hagood Hardy.\n\nHere we are: #1! This one wasn’t too hard to guess, was it? Anne of Green Gables and its sequel were based on a book series by Lucy Maud Montgomery. For those who don’t know the plot, (probably nobody) Anne, a red-haired and ambitious orphan is accidentally sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert on Prince Edward Island. Even after she creates much havoc and breaks a slate over a boy’s head at school, the Cuthberts allow her to stay for good. The movie continues until Anne is sixteen, and later picks up in the sequel a few years later. This movie has been my favorite ever since I first watched it over a decade ago. It transports special feelings right off the screen and into my heart, letting me enter into the magical world of Anne. It has changed the way I think about the past, present, and future, and will forever be something special that I want to share with everyone!\n\n………………………………………….……\n\nWhat are your favorite movies?\n\nWho is your favorite actor/actress?\n\nWhich of the movies on my list have you heard of/watched before?\n\nMegan Joy\n\nIf you’ve ever attended a Civil War reenactment, you’ve probably seen the rifles, cannons, tents, and hoop skirts. It’s like stepping into another world of the past. But recently, I was able to experience it like a true reenactor because. . .\n\nI now own a tent!\n\nAlong with having a tent is the necessity of knowledge and experience about such things. Unfortunately, you don’t have this knowledge or experience until after you’ve attended multiple reenactments and have learned as you go. I’ve certainly learned a lot from my latest reenactment. Here are five things I learned at a Civil War reenactment being a rookie participant.\n\n1)When pitching your tent, it’s best to know which way the wind is blowing.\n\nExplanation: When we arrived at the Civilian’s camp, there was a large bit of land across from many other tents and a cooking fire. The fire burns all day to boil water, bake bread, cook, and is there for anyone’s use. What I hadn’t known was that I had staked my tent directly in line of the smoke trail from the fire. All weekend, it burnt our eyes, made us cough, and blew ashes and sparks into the tent, hence the empty plot of land that nobody had wanted for those reasons!\n\n2) Get accustomed to people taking your picture.\n\nExplanation: Being dressed up and doing living history in public means that people are going to take your picture. Some are so kind as to ask permission politely and sometimes little kids come up and stand next to you and smile. Others, on the other hand, don’t ask. They either get out their phone and tap the screen a million times, or they pull out a huge camera with a lens seven feet long. Then they stand in front of you from 5 seconds to 5 minutes taking your picture. Some will even instruct you how to pose while others catch you when your bonnet flies away with your hair in a mess.\n\n3)Learn to bite your tongue.\n\nExplanation: As the battle reenactment occurs, you watch from afar with many other viewers. You must learn to bite your tongue when someone behind you begins “explaining” to their friend that the Battle of Gettysburg was the Japanese fighting against the Americans (yes, I actually heard this one). You may also hear questions among others like:\n\n“Where are their tri-cornered hats?”\n\n“Did the soldiers hide behind all those monuments on the battlefield?”\n\n“Did the British win the Civil War?”\n\n4)Learn to say, “thank you” a lot.\n\nExplanation: People like to complement those dressed in historical clothes, so you must get used to replying, “thank you” when someone pronounces a quite common statement such as – “I love your dress!” Not that I’m complaining, it’s just something I’ve learned. The last time this happened to me I was watching my brother in the battle about to be shot (pretend, of course!) and a woman tapped me on the shoulder to say how much she liked my dress. After I said, “thank you” and eventually turned back to the battle, my brother was already down in the grass! I had missed the whole thing!\n\n5) Don’t stay in the soldier’s camp too long.\n\nExplanation: If you’re in ear range of where the men gather around the fire to talk, you’re bound to hear a few words that may not be very, um, nice. . . so, it’s just better not to listen too carefully to their conversations.\n\n…………………………………..\n\nThere are five things I learned at a Civil War reenactment!\n\n………………….\n\nHave you ever been to a Civil War reenactment?\n\nHave any of these things happened to you?\n\nMegan Joy\n\nThis weekend, I attended one of my favorite Civil War reenactments. The three-day event was filled with dresses, tents, campfires, and soldiers. There were two mock battles fought and a few drills. My brother joined the Union army this year. I was pleased when he came out of both battles alive.\n\nAfter the last battle, my sister and I were able to sneak down to the waterfront and snap a few photos.\n\nThis is a new camp dress that I bought from one of the sutlers at the reenactment. Sadly, the first time I wore it, it was torn while getting out of a truck. It’s only a minor rip and I can sew it up, so it’s not too bad.\n\nI found a stone that looked like a nugget of gold! It wasn’t, though.\n\nAfter leaving the reenactment, we stopped at the nearest mini mart for a snack to eat on the way home. We were still dressed in our Civil War attire, but weren’t too concerned about the funny looks we might get. To our amazement, a Confederate soldier entered the store just as we did, and we laughed to see each other. After departing the store with a snack and a cheerful story to tell later, we never could have imagined what would be added to our tale! As we neared our truck, we noticed that something was dangling from beneath the engine. Upon opening the hood and taking a closer look, we noticed that the fan belt had frayed and half of it had dislocated itself from the rest. When trying to remove the loose piece, we realized that it was stuck, tangled, and in need of some brute force to get it free. My brother, in his Union uniform, crawled underneath the truck, and attempted to untangle the mess but to no avail. At the same moment, the same Confederate soldier was exiting the store and noticed our troubles. He offered his help and suggestions to dislodge the piece and managed to pry it a little looser.\n\nMeanwhile, another Confederate had parked just ahead, and when sighting our dismay, came to help. Seeing that more help had arrived, we thanked the first Confederate and he drove off on his long ride home. Now, the second Confederate was able to pull the belt free with my brother helping from beneath the truck, while my sister and I watched from other side. This task was completed. Now, the next question: could the truck be driven the long ride home with half a fan belt? I think not. As we discussed this, two more Confederates pulled up and asked if they could help! They helpfully told us of four auto stores nearby, and offered directions to them. After a plan had been settled upon, we thanked all the Confederates and we dispersed on our own separate ways. It had been a joyful reunion between both strangers and “enemies” – Yankees and Rebels. It was good to know that four Confederate soldiers would be so gracious as to help a Northern solider and his sisters, when just hours before, they were in battle against each other.\n\nSo, to carry on with the story, we had to drive to several mechanical stores until we found someone willing to help us so near to closing time. Once our truck was accepted (I sound like we were trying to get it into college!) and was pulled into our last resort garage, we were asked to wait while the mechanics replaced the belt. Then we realized that the snacks we had bought in the first place were now five feet high on the car lifter thing in the garage. We had spotted a Wendy’s down the block earlier and decided that some of us could eat there. We assembled a parade and marched down the busy street in fashion. We received many a strange look once inside, but smiled and had a grand old time. Soon the truck was fixed and we headed home with a new experience to keep under our hats.\n\n…………………….\n\ndress // sulter tent\n\nbonnet // sulter tent\n\nbelt // handmade\n\nbag // thrifted\n\nshoes // thrifted\n\n…………………………………..\n\nHave you ever been to a Civil War reenactment?\n\nI challenge anyone to walk into a Wendy’s, wearing an historical outfit, and order fries to go. If you do, don’t forget to take a photo, and send it to me via email. The first person to capitalize on this challenge before the end of May will win a $10 Wendy’s gift card!
