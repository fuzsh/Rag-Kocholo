        "text": "PRINTER FRIENDLY VIEW\n\n(inverts site colors)\n\nBuy it... if you desire a safe initial taste of Zbigniew Preisner's film scoring career, a restrained, respectful, and beautiful expression of intimate classical romanticism with a slightly folksy personality.\n\nAvoid it... if you expect to hear the Linda Ronstadt song adaptation of Preisner's themes heard over the movie's end credits, the score-only album crushingly lacking this necessary and redeeming part of the soundtrack.\n\nEDITORIAL REVIEW\n\nFILMTRACKS TRAFFIC RANK: #1,887 WRITTEN 2/22/12\n\nPreisner\n\nThe Secret Garden: (Zbigniew Preisner) Now considered to be among author Frances Hodgson Burnett's most famous novels, \"The Secret Garden\" has been adapted to the stage and screen numerous times, one of which an Agnieszka Holland film released in America in 1993 and United Kingdom the following year. While not a resounding success immediately, The Secret Garden was well received critically and has, over time, accrued a good standing with art house crowds. Its story is one of childhood escapism, one that encourages freedom of will and the healing power of friendship and the outdoors. A young girl living with her unloving parents in India at the turn of the 20th Century is sent to live with her uncle at a stately manor in England when those parents are killed in an Earthquake. The rather snotty child eventually starts to warm to the staff of the estate and is transformed for the better in her personality when she discovered a secret garden on the grounds of the manor. She also strikes up a friendship with the young son of her often absent and emotionally distraught uncle, and with the help of others against the wishes of the lead house maid, she assists the disabled boy in escaping the confines of his bedroom and start walking. The key to these transformations is the magical healing power of the garden, which is the ultimate bonding agent that eventually brings all the major characters together into a blissful state by the end of the picture. Collaborating with the Polish director was fellow countryman Zbigniew Preisner, who was suggested to write the music for The Secret Garden by producer Francis Ford Coppola. Preisner's career in film scoring, active from the mid-1980's to the mid-2000's, remains best known for his collaboration with Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski and the trio of scores in the Three Colors franchise. During that height of recognition in the early 1990's, Preisner scored The Secret Garden in between the first two of his Three Colors assignments. While his music for The Secret Garden was acknowledged as a tremendous asset to the film at the time of its release, the score has continue to build upon its positive reputation in the years that have followed, and it's not uncommon for this work to represent the only one of Preisner's typically romantic compositions in the average film music collection. Part of the success of this soundtrack is attributable to the innocently beautiful Linda Ronstadt performance of \"Winter Light,\" the ethereal end credits song that seamlessly combines the two best themes from Preisner's score (those for the garden and the main boy) into a stunning resolution to the tale.\n\nFew scores rely upon a classically rich sense of style as much as The Secret Garden. Its refined instrumental precision suggests that a stuffy atmosphere is likely to dominate the music's personality, but Preisner balances this sound with folk rhythms and a sense of lyrical mysticism that appropriately forces the period sound to adopt a whimsical stance. The orchestral ensemble is never applied with convincing force in the score, instead dominated by extremely well enunciated chamber-like solo lines of activity in a very dry mix. The lack of depth in the ensemble is sometimes bothersome, but Preisner's intent was clearly to emphasize personal development rather than the kind of \"in your face\" magical representations of nature as heard in Jerry Goldsmith's Legend. That said, there are exotic elements at play in the score, most of them concentrated in \"Main Title,\" where the Indian location is addressed with a seeming combination of acoustic guitar, harp, and sitar. The blurriness of the layered woodwind performances in this cue is remarkable even though Preisner doesn't develop any of the score's themes in this eerie opening. For the garden itself and the progress made by the main boy in the story, the composer takes the choral route, the former element afforded a handful of pretty, straight forward boys choir accompaniment in the middle of the score and the latter character represented by a solo boy's voice in two poignant cues later. The score is rich with thematic development, with four themes developed consistently and usually informing the activity of any given cue. The score's main identity is tied to the garden and logically doesn't appear until the mid-section of the work. In \"Entering the Garden\" and \"Walking Through the Garden,\" Preisner establishes the idea with the deliberate simplicity of a children's carol. Further development in \"Taking Colin to the Garden,\" \"Colin Loves Mary,\" and \"Happily Ever After\" puts increasingly optimistic instrumental tones into the theme. The main girl has a theme that is eventually overtaken by the garden's theme; her individual identity is a somber, descending series of formal phrases in \"Leaving the Docks,\" \"First Time Outside,\" and \"Shows Dickon Garden.\" The boy, conversely, receives a purely fluid and lovely theme that stuns with its first statement by solo voice in \"Colin Opens His Eyes\" and continues to impress in \"Colin Senses Craven\" and \"Happily Ever After.\" The uncle's stomping theme exists in the three \"Craven\" cues, the score's most ominous, waltz-like expressions of stern reprimand. Together, these themes and the extremely deliberate instrumentation of The Secret Garden make the score a clear winner despite its understatement overall. Devastating to the 31-minute album is the absence of the Ronstadt end credits song, however, an absolutely necessary companion to Preisner's lovely score. @Amazon.com: CD or Download\n\nMusic as Written for the Film: ****\n\nMusic as Heard on the Album: ***\n\nOverall: ****\n\nVIEWER RATINGS\n\n141 TOTAL VOTES\n\nAverage: 3.33 Stars ***** 32 **** 36 *** 34 ** 25 * 14 (View results for all titles)\n\nCOMMENTS\n\n2 TOTAL COMMENTS\n\nJust picked it up because of this review-\n\nRick - January 11, 2013, at 11:26 a.m. 1 comment (778 views)\n\nAn underrated gem\n\nRichard Kleiner - January 2, 2013, at 5:57 p.m. 1 comment (835 views)\n\nTRACK LISTINGS AND AUDIO\n\nTotal Time: 31:15\n\n 1.
