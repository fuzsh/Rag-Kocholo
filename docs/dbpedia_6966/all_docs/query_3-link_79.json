        "text": "It suddenly came to me today that after over a year of blogging about things that I love, I’ve never really talked much about Star Wars except for the times I’ve written about film scores. So in honor of the second greatest movie trilogy of all time, I’ve decided to dedicate this week’s Awesome 13 list to Star Wars and its 13 awesome moments.\n\n13. Escape From the Sarlaac (Return of the Jedi)\n\nAfter Jabba the Hut’s little party gets crashed by Luke Skywalker and company in attempts to rescue the carbonite-frozen Han Solo, Luke and Han are sentenced to execution by way of Sarlaac, which is a horrible way to die because basically you’re dropped into a hole deep in the hot desert of Tatooine only to be eaten and digested by a huge mouth lined with several rows of sharp teeth. As a kid I was terrified of the Sarlaac, which probably had more to do with my fear of falling than the actual monster itself. But it’s a fun scene to watch now – hearing Lando’s hilarious scream as he falls towards the mouth before he’s rescued, watching Boba Fett’s unfortunate demise, and the exciting conclusion of Luke and Han breaking free and destroying Jabba’s sail barge right before Leia makes her own escape after strangling Jabba with the chain from which she was captured. Good times.\n\nLuke: “I was born here, you know.”\n\nHan Solo: “You’re gonna die here, you know. Convenient.”\n\n12. The Real Anakin Skywalker (Return of the Jedi)\n\nAll this time we’ve grown to hate Darth Vader. He may be Luke’s father, but he’s Pure Evil. We’ll never root for him, right? Well, that all sort of changes in Return of the Jedi when Vader sees his son almost die at the hands of The Emperor, who’s far more evil than Vader will ever be. He saves his son, giving his own life in the process, and as he lay dying on the ground in his son’s arms, we see the real face of not Darth Vader, but Anakin Skywalker. We get a small glimpse into who Anakin really was before he became more machine than man, and even though 16 years later we get to see the evolution of Anakin Skywalker, we cherish this moment between Luke and his father, the father he never knew, the man he could finally forgive.\n\nAnakin: “Tell your sister…you were right.”\n\n11. Leia Meets Wicket (Return of the Jedi)\n\nHate on the Ewoks all you want, but I like ‘em. They’re cute, they’re fuzzy, and they will attack you if you piss them off. The cutest of all, of course, is our Ewok hero Wicket, who Princess Leia meets after her disastrous speeder bike ride. She’s curious about him, and he’s definitely weary of her, even when she tries to offer him food. I admit, I’m a sucker for this scene because it’s just plain cute and silly. We know he’s not dangerous, even though he’s holding some sort of spear, and we just want him and Leia to be friends so we can continue to watch him be cute.\n\nPrincess Leia: “You’re a jittery little thing, aren’t you?”\n\n10. Ewok Celebration (Return of the Jedi)\n\nSpeaking of Ewoks, they throw the best parties. Again, people like to hate on the furry guys, but admit it…you love the end scene of Return of the Jedi. In the original release of the movie, we get an awesome song called “Ewok Celebration”, originally titled “Yub Nub”, which means “Freedom” in Ewokese (betcha didn’t know that!). The song is utter nonsense, but it’s hilariously fun. We also get to see Luke’s vision of the spirits of Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda watching over him. In the original, the actor playing Anakin is the same guy we see in the aforementioned scene when Vader dies. In the re-release of the movie post-prequels, the spirit of Anakin is suddenly played by Hayden Christensen, who plays Anakin in the prequels. Now I know some people (husband and brother) who are completely offended by this change. Me? Not so much. I honestly don’t mind it at all. But whatever. It’s a fun way to end the trilogy, crazy Ewok song and all.\n\n9. Introducing Han Solo (A New Hope)\n\nSince Han Solo seems to be everyone’s favorite character, we can’t deny that his intro in the first movie is pretty memorable. I’m not sure if it was memorable when the movie first came out, but we love it now despite the fact that we’ve seen his intro about 500 times now. We meet Han when Luke and Obi-Wan are looking to hitch a ride out of Tatooine. Han’s got the rep and the ship to do it (even though Luke thinks the Millennium Falcon looks like a piece of junk). But the price has to be right, and the three of them manage to strike a deal that pleases all. Right away we know that Han isn’t a good guy (he did, of course, SHOOT FIRST), but we love him anyway.\n\nHan Solo: “Han Solo. I’m captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you’re lookin’ for passage to the Alderaan system?”\n\nObi-Wan: “Yes indeed, if it’s a fast ship.”\n\nHan Solo: “Fast ship? You’ve never heard of the Millennium Falcon?”\n\n8. Rescuing the Princess (A New Hope)\n\nAs a kid, and like all other nerdy girls from the mid-80s, I loved Princess Leia. She remains to this day one of my favorite female characters of all time. Strong, feisty, and not clumsy at all (take note, young adult fiction writers), she’s everything a Princess should be. After being taken prisoner by Governer Tarkin, she’s rescued by Luke, who’s disguised as a Stormtrooper. And then comes one of my favorite dialogue exchanges in the movie…\n\nLeia: “Aren’t you a little short to be a Stormtrooper?”\n\nLuke: “What? Oh…” (takes off helmet) “I’m Luke Skywalker. I’m here to rescue you.”\n\nAnd, okay. I know that I love Leia because she’s strong and independent woman who doesn’t need the help of some farm boy from Tatooine. But I can’t help but swoon every time. Even though he’s really her brother. *shudder*\n\n7. A Moment With Han and Leia (The Empire Strikes Back)\n\nAt the beginning of the second movie (and hands-down the best of the bunch), we see what it’s like when Han and Leia spend quality time with each other on the ice planet Hoth. We know from the first movie that even though they don’t get along, these two peeps have got it bad for each other. They’re just too proud to stubborn to admit it. So what do we get instead? Banter. Lovely, lovely banter between the Nerf Herder and the Princess.\n\nPrincess Leia: “Let go.”\n\nHan Solo: “Shh.”\n\nPrincess Leia: “Let go, please.”\n\nHan Solo: “Don’t get excited.”\n\nPrincess Leia: “Captain, being held by you isn’t quite enough to get me excited.”\n\nHan Solo: “Sorry sweetheart. I haven’t got time for anything else.”\n\nFor some reason we all love a good love/hate relationship between two characters, and this one is one of the best. It’s a realistic scene that humanizes two people amidst a sci-fi/fantasy story, in a galaxy far, far away, and we can’t get enough.\n\n6. Time on Dagobah (The Empire Strikes Back)\n\nOne of the reasons why I love The Empire Strikes Back so much is because of Yoda. Some of my favorite scenes take place during Luke’s time on the planet Dagobah where he meets Yoda and trains to become a Jedi. First off, I love the look of the planet. Wet, swampy, humid…nothing like the dry desert of Tatooine. And Yoda is, for lack of a better word, awesome. He’s come to Dagobah to live in exile after failing to defeat Darth Sidious, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have any mojo left in him. He teaches Luke the way of the Jedi, and also rides on his back and steals Luke’s weird hot-dog-looking food when he’s not looking. Yoda’s a feisty, grumpy old man who’s determined to turn Luke into a Jedi, and I love him for it.\n\nLuke: “I want my lamp back. I’m gonna need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.”\n\nYoda: “Slimy? Mudhole? My home this is!”\n\n5. Destruction of the Death Star (A New Hope)\n\nIn what is probably the most exciting and anticipated scenes in the first movie, we get to see Luke transform from innocent, whiny farm boy to a X-Wing flying prodigy. I’m sure no one thought that Luke was going to be the one to save the galaxy by shooting a ball of fire into an exhaust port two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he does it. The whole scene is a blast (no pun?) to watch, from the roll call (“Red Five standing by.”) to the trench run to the final explosion, which looks cool whether you’re watching the originals or re-releases. It’s one of those can’t-help-but-cheer moments…especially when Han Solo and his Millennium Falcon come and save the day (re: save Luke’s ass).\n\nHan: “You’re all clear, kid! Now let’s blow this thing and go home.”\n\n4. Vader’s Confession (The Empire Strikes Back)\n\nThis is the most famous scene in all three movies, and it’s the most important and pivotal as well. Up to this point – if we’re watching it for the first time, that is – we don’t know much about Darth Vader except that he’s a pretty evil guy. But when it comes out that he’s actually Luke’s father (spoilers?) – the one person whom Luke hates most in the galaxy – well, let’s just say that everyone’s jaw hit the floor. DARTH VADER IS LUKE’S FATHER!!!! Yep, it’s pretty huge. And even though Luke makes some pretty weird-looking faces during the scene, it’s powerful and intense and never holds back.\n\nDarth Vader: “Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.”\n\nLuke: “He told me enough! He told me you killed him!”\n\nDarth Vader: “No. I am your father.”\n\nLuke: “No. No. That’s not true. That’s impossible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\n3. “I Know.” (The Empire Strikes Back)\n\nTwo words. Two words are all it took for us to realize how Leia and Han felt about each other. No need for any grand declaration of love, no balcony speech, no sappy love song. Just a simple “I know.” And really, can you imagine any other response from Han? Granted he didn’t have much time, what with the whole being lowered into molten-hot carbonite, but still. Simplicity is best.\n\nLeia: “I love you.”\n\nHan: “I know.”\n\n2. The Throne Room (A New Hope)\n\nStar Wars is filled with memorable images, but the one that stands out in my mind as my favorite is the final scene in the first movie. The Death Star has been destroyed, and now Luke and Han are being rewarded for it (but not Chewie, poor wookie). The scene itself is awesome. The actual Throne Room is a long, rectangular hall with a long walkway that Luke and Han walk up to receive their reward from Princess Leia. Luke is wearing a sweet-looking mustard-colored 70s jacket. Han has a permanent smirk on his face. And Leia is looking at the two of them like they’re silly, little boys. There’s no dialogue, only music – a majestic march that only John Williams could think up, which provides the perfect ending for an awesome movie.\n\n1. The Opening Crawl (All Three)\n\nOkay, admit it. You get all giddy like a little kid when you see the opening crawl at the beginning of each movie. Your heart jumps when “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…” appears on the screen, and then…WORDS!!!!!! A bunch of words slowly moving up the screen. It’s a odd way to begin a movie, that’s for sure. But it just makes sense. If a Star Wars movie didn’t have that opening crawl, then it just wouldn’t be a Star Wars movie. Who knew that reading background info about rebel alliances and empires could be so exciting?\n\nAbout a year ago I wrote a post about some of my favorite film scores and why I’m such a film score geek. I talked about some great ones from such composers as John Williams and Howard Shore, but I didn’t have the guts to actually rate them and narrow them down to a #1 winner.\n\nWell, I think it’s about time I do just that.\n\nThis was a difficult list to make. Not the rating, but the leaving out of so many awesome scores that didn’t make the cut. For example, John Williams has scored about fifty-thousand movies (give or take a few thousand), but I couldn’t have a list with just John Williams scores. He appears on this list twice (Patrick Doyle, however, appears on the list three times).\n\nSo here it is…The Awesome 13…Film Scores.\n\n13. How to Train Your Dragon (2010) – John Powell\n\nThis is the most recent film score to appear on this list, and also the most surprising. I didn’t know much about this movie when it came out two years ago, except for the fact that it was based on a children’s book of the same title. It looked cute, but I just thought it was just another animated kid’s movie that I probably wouldn’t see. But I began to hear some positive buzz about it. And then amongst all that buzz, it got itself an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score. Well, this definitely got my attention, since that’s my favorite category at the Oscars. So I went on Amazon and bought the soundtrack to see what was so great about it. And you know what? It’s awesome! If you like powerful orchestral works that soar with a touch of Celtic, this is a great score to listen to. Never slow, always beautiful and exciting.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“See You Tomorrow”\n\n“Test Drive”\n\n“Romantic Flight”\n\n12. Sherlock Holmes (2009) – Hans Zimmer\n\nThe score for Guy Ritchie’s film Sherlock Holmes remains to be one of the most inventive and original musical scores I have ever heard. Using a banjo, cimbalom, squeaky violins, a broken pub piano, this mish-mash of odd instruments matches perfectly with the quirkiness of the movie. It’s such a fun score to listen to because you never know what’s going to come next, and you can’t help but feel a little mischievous as you listen, like you’re about to do something crazy and unpredictable, too.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“Discombobulate”\n\n“I Never Woke Up in Handcuffs Before”\n\n“Marital Sabotage”\n\n11. The Secret Garden (1993) – Zbigniew Preisner\n\nMost people have heard of the classic children’s book, but not too many people I know have seen the 1993 movie starring virtually all unknown actors (except for Maggie Smith, though in 1993 I didn’t know who she was, either). But I highly recommend seeing this movie if you love beautiful sets and atmosphere and storytelling, and especially if you love beautiful and melodic, yet haunting music. Mostly using piano and violin, composer Zbigniew Preisner brings the moors of Yorkshire to life and makes you feel like you’re part of the magic.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“Awakening of Spring”\n\n“Taking Colin to the Garden”\n\n“Colin Loves Mary”\n\n10. Little Women (1994) – Thomas Newman\n\nWhile Thomas Newman is more known for his work with Pixar (Finding Nemo, Wall-E), he first got my attention in 1994 when he scored Little Women starring Winona Ryder. He has an interesting style, using what almost sounds like tubular bells in his work, paired with a more traditional orchestral sound. It’s light and fluttery most of the time, and as with most good composers, makes you feel like you’re living in 1860s New England with the March sisters. And it’s his music that creates much of the emotion captured in the movie.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“Orchard House”\n\n“Spring”\n\n“Beth’s Secret”\n\n9. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) – Tan Dun / Yo-Yo Ma\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is probably the most international-sounding of all the scores on this list, as it mostly consists of traditional Chinese-style instruments, especially the drums. Yo-Yo Ma contributes to the score with his beautiful cello solos, which flow so serenely that you forget this is considered to be an action movie. There are moments of excitement when the Chinese pounding of the percussion puts you right in the middle of the action, but it doesn’t take away from the beauty of the score and the artistry of the whole movie.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“The Eternal Vow”\n\n“Night Fight”\n\n“Farewell”\n\n8. Much Ado About Nothing (1993) – Patrick Doyle\n\nExcluding John Williams, Patrick Doyle is one of my favorite composers, although he remains to be unknown to most people. The main reason why he’s so awesome is because he has a way of creating the most beautiful, memorable melodies of any other composer out there. And Kenneth Branagh’s Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. As one of Shakespeare’s comedies, it makes sense that this score is light and bubbly and fun. The opening overture of the movie is soaring and majestic and gets you pumped for the rest of the movie. And though it’s a light-hearted comedy, it has its dark moments. But the score never loses its beauty and instead creates a melody that stays with you for a long time.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“Overture”\n\n“The Masked Ball”\n\n“It Must Be Requited”\n\n7. Henry V (1989) – Patrick Doyle\n\nThis was the first time I was introduced to Patrick Doyle, and I was blown away. This is a lot different from the happy-fest you hear in his Much Ado score, and instead he focuses on dark, instense melodies while also capturing a powerful and almost patriotic feel moments during Henry V’s famous speech before the Battle of Agincourt. It’s music that makes you feel like standing up and cheering although you know the bloodbath that will follow. Don’t get me wrong – the movie is fantastic. But this is one of those scores that can stand on its own and make you feel as if you’re part of the story without seeing a single scene from the movie.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“The Death of Falstaff”\n\n“The Day is Yours”\n\n“The Wooing of Katherine”\n\n6. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2004) – Patrick Doyle\n\nWhile I love all of the scores for the Harry Potter movies, this one still stands out as my favorite, probably because it’s Patrick Doyle and contains some of the more memorable themes than the rest of them. While he obviously kept in John Williams’s original theme from the first movie (as did all the composers from the other movies), he added in his own blend of magicalness by giving Harry, Hogwarts, Neville, and Winter their own themes. They’re all beautiful and feel like full orchestra pieces, making them stand out amongst all other music you hear in any Harry Potter movie.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“Harry in Winter”\n\n“Potter Waltz”\n\n“Hogwarts’ Hymn”\n\n5. The Indiana Jones Trilogy (1980 / 1984 / 1989) – John Williams\n\nThis is the first of FOUR trilogies that appear on this list, and the reason why I didn’t pick individual movies from the trilogies to highlight is because I just can’t split them up. Using a chorus of trumpets and trombones, “The Raiders March” is one of the most memorable themes of any movie, and the rest of the three soundtracks are just as fun, action-packed, and triumphant. There’s not much more I can say about them other than they’re classic John Williams that you can listen to over and over again and never get sick of.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“Raiders March” (Raiders of the Lost Ark)\n\n“Nocturnal Activities” (Temple of Doom)\n\n“Keeping Up With the Joneses” (Last Crusade)\n\n4. The Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy (2003 / 2006 / 2007) – Klaus Badelt / Hans Zimmer\n\nThe scores to these three movies are so much fun. Just like the movies, the music doesn’t take itself seriously: it just makes you smile and have a good time. There’s never a dull moment in the score; the action is constant until the very last note in the final film, At World’s End, which probably has the most variety of music of the three. Badelt and Zimmer focused on using lots of horn for the main themes, plus furiously fast strings combined with the clashing of cymbals to accompany the background, which not a lot of people had heard before this. But it’s what keeps people’s attention – always moving, always flowing, and always entertaining.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“He’s a Pirate” (Curse of the Black Pearl)\n\n“Dinner is Served” (Dead Man’s Chest)\n\n“One Day” (At World’s End)\n\n3. Pan’s Labyrinth (2006) – Javier Navarrete\n\nI hate to use the words “hauntingly beautiful” again, but they definitely describe the score to Guillermo del Toro’s fantasy film perfectly. The entire score was based on a lullaby – a creepy lullaby that will stay in your head for days – and from that lullaby came a magical and lyrical melody that makes you feel like something isn’t right, despite how pretty-sounding it may be. But that’s what the whole movie is: a fairytale that takes place against the background of a violent war. Something beautiful paired with something ugly. It’s amazing how a single violin can manage to make you feel all of that in just a few simple notes.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“Long, Long Time Ago”\n\n“The Moribund Tree and the Toad”\n\n“A Princess”\n\n2. The Star Wars Trilogy (1977 / 1980 / 1983) – John Williams\n\nOh, geez. Where do I begin? Everyone knows Star Wars. It was voted as AFI’s Number One Film Score of All-Time. Why? Is it because everyone is familiar with it? Well, no. It’s because IT’S AWESOMENESS AT ITS BEST. John Williams pretty much changed film scores all together with the release of Star Wars in 1977. Inspired by Richard Strauss’s “Also sprach Zarathustra”, Williams created fanfare in his work for this movie, something that was lacking from a lot of the movies from the same decade. And suddenly the blockbuster movie and score were born. All three movie scores have the same themes and tones running through them, yet still contain memorable themes in each of them. This is a score that will live on as long as Star Wars – which will, of course, be FOREVER.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“The Throne Room” (A New Hope)\n\n“The Imperial March” (The Empire Strikes Back)\n\n“Parade of the Ewoks” (Return of the Jedi)\n\n1. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001 / 2002 / 2003) – Howard Shore\n\nWell, this should be no surprise to anyone who knows how I feel about The Lord of the Rings. Prior to seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I had always loved film scores. But this one sort of changed everything for me. Suddenly I realized that a film score could be just as moving and wonderful and spectacular and thoughtful as the movie itself, and become a completely separate entity on its own. Howard Shore created a masterpiece within these three movies that run together so seamlessly that one can sit and listen to all ten hours of score and feel like it’s just one piece. And even though the three vary in tone, you can hear recurring themes in each movie – themes for the different races, different lands, etc – that seem to pop up at just the right time. And the fact that books have been written about the score alone, as well as a live concert of Lord of the Rings makes you realize that this is definitely something special that may not happen again for a long time.\n\nTry These Three:\n\n“The Breaking of the Fellowship” (The Fellowship of the Ring)\n\n“Evenstar” (The Two Towers)\n\n“Minas Tirith” (The Return of the King)\n\nOh, who am I kidding? TRY ALL OF THEM.\n\nI’ll tell you what’s wrong with fan fiction.\n\nNothing.\n\nEver since fan fiction started to gain popularity in the late 90s (re: the dawn of the internet), it’s earned a bad reputation. “It’s not real writing.” “It’s not original.” “It’s plagiarism.” “It’s a waste of time.” But to someone who loves to write and is a fan of a lot of things, I stand here today to defend the writers of fan fiction, aka “fanfic” and to reassure them that what they’re doing should be appreciated and respected.\n\nFanfic is exactly what it sounds like: fictional stories created by fans of a certain published work. For example, there are thousands of fanfic stories that take place in the world of Harry Potter, Star Wars, Twilight, Lord of the Rings, and other such works. Some writers stay within that world, and some do crossovers, for instance, having Frodo stumble upon Hogwarts on his way to Mordor. Fanfic usually refers to written stories, but it also may apply to artwork.\n\nAdmittedly, a lot of fanfic is ridiculous (not to mention filled with spelling and grammatical errors). I would probably never seek out fanfic devoted to Legolas erotica, nor would I want to read about “a very special relationship” between Batman and Superman. But there’s some fanfic out there that I find truly interesting. I follow a blogger who does mostly Harry Potter fanfic based on the backstories of the original Hogwarts founders. To me that’s interesting because it’s something that no one knows about except for J.K. Rowling, because we can make up our own backstories to enrich the stories that much more.\n\nAnd that’s basically what fanfic is. It’s a way for us to either extend a world that we love so much that might have ended too soon, or it’s a way for us to insert parts we felt were missing from the story. You wanted Aang to hook up with Toph in Avatar: The Last Airbender? Write it yourself! It’s like imagining “what could have been” and just having fun with it.\n\nI’ve never really written true fanfic – I’ve never even dared writing a story that takes place at Hogwarts or that takes place where Firefly left off – not because I have no interest in it, but because it seems like such a daunting task. Not only would I be meddling in something that’s already fantastic, but I would really have to know my shiz. You can’t just start writing fanfic based on Lord of the Rings just because you liked the movies. You have to know a TON about every character and the story just so what you’re writing actually makes sense. And trust me, people who read fanfic on the internet will let you know after the first paragraph whether you’re half-assing it or not.\n\nHow I began writing twenty years ago, however, was taking certain actors that I liked at the time and writing about their personal life intertwining with my main character. One example would be my character meeting Matt Damon before he became a big star and then they get together and he basically lives his real life, just alongside a fictional character that I created. I wrote a similar story revolving around Orlando Bloom while he was in drama school before Lord of the Rings came around. I guess you can say it was like “real life fanfic”. Completely fictional based on real-life events. Like Lifetime movies. But still fanfic.\n\nFanfic writers will most likely never get published, though there are certain authors who absolutely do not allow anyone to write fanfic on websites like FanFiction.net, like Anne Rice (Interview with a Vampire) and George R.R. Martin (Game of Thrones). Other authors like J.K. Rowling and Stephenie Meyer, however, support the art of fanfic and seem to encourage it among their fans (though I wonder what Rowling thinks of all the Harry/Draco shippers out there).\n\nSo what are the most popular brands of fanfic that people are writing? On Fanfiction.net, the number one fanfic work based on movies is Star Wars, followed by Pirates of the Caribbean and High School Musical. The top three TV shows generating fanfic are Glee, Supernatural, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And when it comes to books themselves, the big three are Harry Potter, Twilight, and Lord of the Rings. No big surprises, though I’m a little shocked to see Newsies in the top ten. Looks like I wasn’t the only one who knew its potential!\n\nA lot of people don’t see fanfic as legitimate writing, which I think is crap. So it’s usually not the best writing in the world. But you know what? Writing is writing. I don’t care if you’re writing in your diary about your day, blogging about arts and crafts, or writing a story about Loki (like my co-worker is currently doing). If you’re writing, your brain is working. If you’re writing, you’re using your imagination. If you’re writing, you’re creating. And that’s what’s most important.\n\nSo don’t feel like you’re less than a writer if you like to write fanfic. What do you think all those fairy tale retellings are? They’re fanfic in its purest form. If you like to write it, keep on writing and don’t stop. Because sometimes a different point of view is all we need to fully understand and appreciate a story that we already love.\n\nHappy reading and writing, fans!\n\nWe’re going to take a step away from books and tea today and talk a little about movies. More specifically, movie trailers. AKA those previews for movies that come before the movie you actually paid to go see in the theater. They usually come with this attached to them:\n\nNow before you could go on the internet to a website like www.comingsoon.net, you had to see the trailer on the big screen. And if you want my opinion, that’s really the way they should be seen. Especially when a studio is releasing a particular trailer for the first time. Watching it on the internet almost seems like cheating to me. You should only be able to see it the same time as everyone else.\n\nSome people don’t get excited about trailers. And there are some trailers that are so uninteresting (i.e. ones for rom-coms) that they shouldn’t be allowed to show in front of a movie. But sometimes it’s worth seeing a movie just because you know that a certain trailer will be playing beforehand. Let me go through some memorable ones that I’ve seen, and maybe you’ll come to understand why the art of the movie trailer is something that needs to be appreciated.\n\nLet me start with The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The studios actually released the trailer for this movie during Fellowship of the Ring‘s run in the theater and attached it to the end of the movie. It was my tenth viewing of FOTR, and my hubby and I had driven all the way from Sherman Oaks to Culver City to see it. While we were waiting for the movie to begin, one of the ushers came and said “For those of you who came to see the trailer forThe Two Towers – we won’t have it until the 7:00 showing.” It was 4:00 at this point, and I kid you not, more than half of the theater walked out (including us), got a refund, and hubby and I drove back up to Sherman Oaks to see FOTR,where they did have the trailer. Then a few minutes before the movie ended, I spotted a group of people sneaking into the theater just to see the freaking trailer. How was the trailer? Totally worth it.\n\nWhen we saw the movie Monsters, Inc. in the theater on opening night in late 2001, we had no idea that they were premiering the trailer for Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones before it (which goes to show you how little we used the internet back in 2002). But as we were waiting for the movie to begin, my hubby’s brother called him to tell him about a rumor he heard about the trailer and how it might be playing before the movie. So we patiently waited through countless, unimportant trailers until finally we saw this:\n\nAnd we knew this was it. It seemed the rest of the audience knew what it meant, too, because suddenly everyone started cheering and whistling. The trailer began, people continued to cheer, and then a huge applause came when it ended. It was definitely a cool experience to be in a crowd who appreciates the same kind of thing as you, and who will cheer just as loud.\n\nThe teaser trailer for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was attached to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in IMAX six years ago, and I had gotten split up from the group I was with because the theater was so crowded. So there I was, all alone, practically sitting in the front row, and suddenly the trailer for Goblet of Fire came on. I was so surprised that I actually started crying. By myself. In the front row. I also cried because it was my favorite book of the series at that point, and the trailer started off with screenshots of how the kids had grown from each movie. I’m a nostalgic person. Crap like that makes me cry.\n\nOh yeah, and I also got to see what Cedric Diggory looked like.\n\nI wish I would actually show you these trailers, but it costs money to put video on blogs, and unfortunately I don’t have that much disposable income. But if you Google “Best Teaser Trailers Ever” you come up with such trailers for Jurassic Park, Superman Returns, Cloverfield, Independence Day, The Dark Knight, and Spider-Man, an awesome trailer that was actually pulled from the theaters just after 9/11 because of shots of the World Trade Center in the trailer (Spidey creates a web between the two towers).\n\nThere are lots of really cool teasers out there…what are some of your favorites?"
