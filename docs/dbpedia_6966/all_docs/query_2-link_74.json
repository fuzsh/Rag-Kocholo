        "text": "When Francis Ford Coppola first screened The Godfather to studio executives, he was told that Nino Rota's score was not commercial enough. The Italian composer is one of the leading lights of film music, but executives felt that his subtle, evocative music did not reflect the drama as literally as they would like. Coppola was ordered to get an American composer, which he did, and the subsequent music was awful. Three months later Nino Rota's score was reinstated.\n\nZbigniew Preisner, who has joined Rota and Ennio Morricone in the elite of European film music, tells this story as an illustration of the problems of working in American film. \"In this stupid business, the principal problem is money,\" says the Polish composer, who looks more like an east European contract killer than a creator of delicately harmonious symphonies. \"I was invited to make an American film recently where Michelle Pfeiffer would be paid $50m, Jack Nicholson $50m, and the film director $10m. Can you imagine how big the budget is? It means that risks cannot be taken. In Europe it's completely different. The Double Life of VÃ©ronique, for example, cost $3m and the film director, not the studio, was my boss.\"\n\nPreisner is a beacon of European civilisation in the face of an American cultural avalanche. Having established himself after writing the music for almost all of fellow Pole Krzystzof Kieslowski's films including the Three Colours series, Preisner has since been flooded with work offers from Hollywood. He has chosen to stay loyal to European cinema, most recently providing a score for the Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's It's All About Love, and he claims that the reason for this is simply because American films are too annoying to work on.\n\n\"When I work with someone like Thomas Vinterberg, he trusts me,\" says Preisner, whose voice rises at even the mention of US film. \"To make music for a film is very easy. The question is why should we use music at all. The connection between the film and the music is completely metaphysical because you never see the music; you only feel it, and in my opinion the best music for a film is total silence. Most American films use a composer like John Williams, when there is music all the time to tell you what to think and how to feel. A bit of danger: some scary horns. A love scene: romantic strings. But the French writer Baudelaire was right when he said that the matter for the artist is not to describe what he sees, but what he feels.\"\n\nHaving started on this path, Preisner finds it hard to change course. He recalls being asked by an American director if he could write a score that sounded American. \"I say no to films like this because there is no point. In America they want to use your name and your reputation and then change what you do. And I want to work on films that talk about what it means to be human, not films that provide a fantasy version of life. When I see most American movies, I think they are providing instructions for terrorists. I was in Poland when I watched September 11 on television, and at first I thought it was a movie. Sure, Independence Day is fun, but films like this are wishing for something to happen, like a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"\n\nGiven Preisner's background, it isn't surprising that he has no time for Hollywood fantasy. Born in Krakow, he grew up in a small Polish village where everybody learnt music by singing in church. \"We had no access to western music,\" he says. \"OK, you heard the Beatles because they are so innocent, but that was all. We would do our best to get Radio Luxembourg, and apart from that - nothing. But Polish communism was not like it was in Russia. The priest was the most important person in the village and even the party secretary went to church.\"\n\nBy his late teens, Preisner was discovering the Polish underground scene that centred on a cabaret in Krakow called Piwnica Pod Baranami, where a not-yet-ordained Pope John Paul II would give poetry readings and the country's jazz musicians would perform without fear of state intervention. \"You could do whatever you wanted down there. We would take an interview with a secretary of state and turn it into music, and when they complained, we said we were promoting communism. Can you imagine this in Russia? You would be on a train to Siberia the day after the concert.\"\n\nYet Poland was still closed off from the west until 1989, when European communism collapsed like a house of cards. The first western pop music that Preisner heard that he admired was Pink Floyd. \"Before 1989, all you could buy in the shops was vinegar, and the Polish mentality is such that this sudden choice was very hard for people. Pink Floyd were sophisticated and smart enough to provide a metaphor for the situation with their album The Wall. I love albums like Dark Side of the Moon because it has a melancholy that is very British - very Polish, too.\"\n\nPreisner admires Ennio Morricone and the French film composer Michel Legrand, whose score to Un Homme et une Femme remains a classic piece of film music. There are American directors he likes, such as Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese, but he claims that he would rather stay in his flat in Paris than court Hollywood for the sake of money or fame. He hasn't even seen the inside of a cinema since 1999 because he hates multiplexes so much. But since he claims that being a composer is easy - \"You just have a piece of paper and you write down the music that is in your head\" - it seems likely that Hollywood will entice him over sooner or later. \"There was a famous Polish poet called Zbigniew Herbert. He said that we must always swim against the current towards the source of the river, because even if you never reach the source you will at least train your muscles. This is what really interests me.\""
