His scores for the films of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski, particularly Dekalog, The Double Life of Veronique, Three Colours: Blue, Three Colours: White, and Three Colours: Red, have brought him international acclaim. Preisner has also scored three films by director Agnieska Holland: Europa, Europa, Olivier, Olivier, and The Secret Garden. His many recent awards and citations include the 1997 Silver Bear from the Berlin Film Festival for Soren Kragh-Jacobsen's The Island on Bird Street; a CÃ©sar Award from the French Film Academy for Three Colours: Red; and three consecutive citations from The Los Angeles Critics Association Awards, from 1991 to 1993, for Outstanding Composer of Film Scores. Additionally, Preisner received the 1992 Award of the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs for outstanding achievements in the presentation of Polish culture abroad."
