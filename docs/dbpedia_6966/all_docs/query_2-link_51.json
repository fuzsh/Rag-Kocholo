        "text": "“Ave Satani” by Jerry Goldsmith | The Omen (1976)\n\nChoral music, perhaps more than any other, gives us a sense of the sacred. There is a deep connection in cultures around the world between holiness and choirs singing. And when that powerful feature is used to present music for horror, the results are terrifying on a deep level.\n\nLegendary composer Jerry Goldsmith gave us an unforgettable piece of choral music for Richard Donner’s 70s horror classic The Omen. This song — which owes a lot to Carl Off’s “Carmina Burana” — gives us a glimpse into the dark origins of the character Damien, as well as the ultimate stakes in the conflict at the center of the film. Good versus evil. God versus the Devil. It’s all here in this gothic choral music.\n\n“Hymn to the Fallen” by John Williams | Saving Private Ryan (1998)\n\nSteven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan was an enormous moment in cinema. It brought war films into a new era, depicting the brutal reality of WWII while also presenting the dignity and heroism of the soldiers. It never falls into easy sentimentality, instead preferring to show ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nPart of this effect is achieved by leaving the vast majority of the film unscored. But the title sequence needed something that could live up to the challenge. Long time Spielberg collaborator John Williams was brought on to write music that could deliver gravitas, and the composer really shines in this piece.\n\n“Conquest of Paradise” by Vangelis | 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992)\n\n1492: Conquest of Paradise is not the most famous Ridley Scott film. But while it never really found footing with critics or audiences, the score certainly did. It has gone on to become a renowned work, yet another beloved score by the great Vangelis.\n\nTen years before this film, Scott and Vangelis worked together on Blade Runner — yet another tremendous use of music in film. But while that science fiction film noir needed a synth heavy soundscape, 1942… gave Vangelis a chance to explore a few more traditional elements. He still managed to sneak in synths, but this choir-heavy piece shows his strength writing for the human voice.\n\n“Concerto in E Minor” by Zbigniew Preisner | The Double Life of Véronique (1991)\n\nPolish director Krzysztof Kieślowski and composer Zbigniew Preisner brought audiences one of the true masterpieces of music ever composed for the screen with this concerto. The work is breathtaking, with an absolutely acrobatic solo that soars above the stirring orchestra.\n\nIt’s a piece that gives us everything we love about Preisner’s compositions. It is both modern and timeless, deeply moving and spiritually overwhelming. But what’s even more astounding is how well it matches the emotional moment of the story, giving us a deeper understanding of the characters. Combined with the visionary force of Kieślowski’s filmmaking, it’s cinema at its finest."
