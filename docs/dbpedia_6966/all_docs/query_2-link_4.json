        "text": "Zbigniew (pronounced ZBEEG-nyev) Preisner is a Polish composer of contemporary classical music most famous for his collaborations with the acclaimed Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski (The Decalogue, The Three Colours Trilogy). In 2011, his music was part of Terrence Malick’s experimental drama film The Tree of Life.\n\nA self-taught artist, Preisner was born in 1955 in the city of Bielsko-Biała and studied history and philosophy in Kraków. Almost all of his compositions are epic in quality and emit a resonance of cosmic proportions.\n\nHis notable works include the “Song for the Unification of Europe” (based on 1 Corinthians 13 and featuring vocals in Koine Greek) as well as a version of “Lacrimosa” from Mozart’s Requiem Mass.\n\nHere are seven links of his pieces from YouTube. The first four are single compositions and the next three, larger collections.\n\n—-\n\nImage Credit:\n\nFeatured: Pixabay\n\nOther: Zbigniew Preisner by User “Artur Andrzej”, CC BY-SA 2.0, Wikipedia\n\n—-"
