        "text": "Danny Elfman\n\nComposer\n\nPiqued Pee-wee’s Interest\n\nFruitful Collaborations With Burton\n\nApproached for “Contemporary Score”\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nDanny Elfman’s exotic collection of folk objects—ranging from Ecuadoran shrunken heads to Mexican Day of the Dead figures—has often inspired him in his musical creation of a dark, humorous, and fantastic world. Elfman has scored over 15 films, concocted numerous television themes, and until 1990 was writing songs and performing with the rock band Oingo Boingo. Despite his successes with film music, however, he is largely considered an amateur composer. He explained in American Film, “It is a generally accepted feeling within the music industry, of composers and would-be composers and wanna-be composers, that I don’t write my own music, that I hire ghosts.” But Elfman has successfully exorcised his ghosts with the orchestral works Batman and Edward Scissorhands, thus firmly establishing himself in the realm of contemporary film composers that includes giants like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nIn 1971 Elfman returned home to Los Angeles after a yearlong trip through Africa, where he had unearthed the musical roots for both his film work and the sound that would define his band, Oingo Boingo. Upon his return, Elfman’s brother Richard asked him to join a theater ensemble called the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. The Mystic Knights performed a multimedia theatrical revue, initially in the streets, then moving on to more elaborate indoor shows. After eight years with the troupe, Richard redirected his efforts toward independent filmmaking, leaving Danny to form Oingo Boingo from the remaining Mystic Knights. The group had its first Top 40 hit in 1985 with the theme song from the film Weird Science. Despite his eventual triumph in Hollywood, Elfman continued to write songs for the group as well as perform guitar and percussion duties. All of Elfman’s scores are orchestrated by Steve Bartek, Oingo Boingo’s lead guitarist, who also assists Elfman in producing his soundtrack albums. Dividing his time between scoring and songwriting, Elfman nonetheless allowed in American Film that songs reach “people on a much more personal, direct level” than does orchestral music for film.\n\nPiqued Pee-wee’s Interest\n\nElfman composed his first score in 1980 for his brother’s cult film Forbidden Zone; it included several songs by the Mystic Knights. Actor Paul Reubens—more popularly known as Pee-wee Herman—saw the film; it piqued his interest in acquiring a non-traditional composer for his project Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, which was released in 1985. This became Elfman’s first full orchestral score. He told Keyboard in 1987 that he\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn May 29, 1953 (some sources say 1955), near Amarillo, TX; married, two daughters.\n\nSinger, songwriter, guitarist, and percussionist for group Oingo Boingo, 1979—.

My scores aren’t what you would call legit, but they communicate my ideas effectively, and ultimately that’s what composition is all about.”\n\nElfman learned how to communicate with an audience from some of the great soundtrack masters. He revealed to Egg, “As a kid I would see movies five, six, seven times if I liked them, and I learned early on that a lot of my favorite ’50s and ’60s fantasy films had wonderful music by Bernard Herrmann.” As a teenager he “would go out at least three nights a week, see every Truffaut, every Fellini—Nino Rota’s music became like second nature to me.” His awareness at such a young age of the intimate relationship between a film’s soundtrack and elements of mood and character made writing soundtracks a very personal endeavor. Composers like Rota, whose work includes the venerable 8 1/2 and The Godfather, and Bernard Herrmann, the genius behind the scores of both Psycho and Citizen Kane, are still his inspiration, and their styles are echoed in many of his works. In Fanfare, Elfman wrote of Pee-wee’s Big Adventure that he “was looking for a type of music that was very innocent and light. Bringing in the Nino Rota element felt right for me.... I wanted to find something that immediately put [Pee-wee] over as something from another world living here.” Herrmann’s influence, too, is evident, particularly in the film’s dream sequences.\n\nFruitful Collaborations With Burton\n\nPee-wee’s Big Adventure marked Elf man’s first collaboration with director Tim Burton, with whom he has enjoyed a strong partnership. His relationship with Burton began early on to resemble those of other filmmakers and their composers—Fellini and Rota, Hitchcock and Herrmann. Elfman told Fanfare, “Tim puts me into areas that are very challenging and fun to work with, and yet he allows me the creativity of figuring out how to make it come alive musically.” Their second film together was 1988’s Beetlejuice. Often cited as Elfman’s finest work, the Beetlejuice score combines circus, calypso, and horror motifs to create a discordant musical montage that skillfully complements the comic film. “A funnier, more boldly innovative or more manic score would be virtually impossible to imagine.... Elfman’s work is as joyous and rollicking as the film itself,” wrote Frederic Silber in Fanfare.\n\nThen, in 1989, Elfman and Burton collaborated on Batman, one of the most commercially successful movies of all time. Burton’s tale of the Dark Knight was tailor-made for Elfman’s dark, visionary style. The score earned the composer a Grammy nomination for best score and the prized statuette, for best instrumental, in 1990. In an interview with Keyboard, Elfman remarked that the visual imagery of the film helped him create the score, which is filled with driving percussion, energetic horns, and haunting organs. “As soon as I saw Gotham [the setting of the film], I heard the music,” Elfman professed. “Tim and I had talked about doing a kind of darkly operatic and Romantic score.... I got my major thematic ideas right there, sitting in the theater and singing into this tape recorder the very first time I was seeing the movie.” Once again, Elfman’s musical sensibilities were easily wed to Burton’s highly developed visual perceptions. Keyboard contributor Robert L. Doerschuk noted in 1989 that Batman could change the face of the movie soundtrack forever. “By writing a soundtrack that stands on its own as an album release and could challenge the Star Wars theme in pops concert programs, Elfman demonstrates that with sufficient talent and dedication... [he] can transcend the idiom formerly defined by the technology of his studio and write effectively for orchestra.”\n\nThe composer’s next film with Burton, 1990’s Edward Scissorhands, produced a score that deftly evoked Burton’s fairy-tale imagery. Elfman used a choral backdrop to develop a melancholic vision of the world, producing a work that many feel stands on its own while simultaneously enhancing the title character’s feelings and expressions.\n\nApproached for “Contemporary Score”\n\nBetween his ventures with Burton, Elfman composed for a wide range of directors and genres. In 1988 he scored Wisdom, a box-office bomb written, directed by, and starring Emilio Estevez. Fanfare’s Silber wrote of Elfman’s contribution, “Suspenseful, hypnotic, pulsating, dream-like, the score succeeds so admirably in every thematic aspect where the film failed so miserably.” Also in 1988, Elfman composed scores for two comedies: Hot to Trot and Big Top Pee-wee, the follow-up to Pee-wee’s Big Adventure. But the film Elfman considers a turning point is yet another 1988 offering, the box-office hit comedy Midnight Run. The composer noted in Fanfare, “Finally, after all those years, I was asked to do a ’contemporary’ score.” His next film, however, 1988’s horror-comedy Scrooged, was a composer’s nightmare: Most of his music was either buried in the film or not used at all.\n\nThe following year, two film projects, Nightbreed and Darkman, brought Elfman back to the genre he loves best—horror. Both scores featured shadowy themes combined with tribal chanting and dramatic overtures. Instead of taking the usual route—reviewing scripts to decide which film to score—Elfman sought out director/writers Clive Barker, the mastermind of Nightbreed, and Sam Raimi, father of Darkman. “I wanted very much to work with them, since I love horror,” Elfman wrote in American Film. “So I’ve returned to the genre that inspired me in the first place.”\n\nElfman’s soundtrack for another 1990 film, Dick Tracy, directed by and starring Warren Beatty, used Gersh-win-esque themes to conjure the 1930s-era setting of the Dick Tracy comic strip. The film earned Elfman a second Grammy nomination for best score. But by 1992, he had again changed directions, this time with the soundtrack for Article 99, the story of a Vietnam veteran’s hospital. That score took a more traditional approach to film music but still featured Elfman’s signature style. 1992 also found Elfman following up his Batman efforts with the score to Burton’s Batman Returns. Entertainment Weekly’s Ty Burr, for one, was unimpressed with the results. Asserting that Elfman had run out of ideas, Burr groused: “Here are the same windswept demon choirs, tinkling music boxes, Fellini carny music, and chic Wagnerian pooting that sounded so great in Edward Scissorhands, Elfman’s peak. But like Batman Returns itself, this new score is neurotically hyperactive. It’s as if Elfman, stumped for new material, simply opted to throw the old stuff at us faster and louder. That’s fine if you’re a punching bag. If not, not.”\n\nIn addition to soundtracks, Elfman has composed several television themes for successful shows like Fox-TV’s extremely popular animated The Simpsons and HBO’s highly acclaimed Tales From the Crypt. These and other television and soundtrack themes were released in 1990 on a compilation album called Music for a Darkened Theatre: Film and Television Music Volume One.\n\nThroughout his composition adventures, whether with Oingo Boingo, in film, or in television, the prolific Elfman has remained close to the origins of his fascination with the theatrical power of music. “Even now, the way I get around my lack of training and technique is by drawing on my having grown up in a world of movies,” he told Fanfare. “Very often, when I’m not sure how to approach something, I say, ’How would I approach this if I were thirteen years old, sitting in a theater, and watching the movie?’ In other words, what would make me come alive?” These instincts have, indeed, served him well, which has perhaps given him the confidence to branch out yet again, this time into screenwriting and directing. In January of 1992 Entertainment Weekly reported that Elfman was “developing several oddball projects, including an ’over-the-top’ musical titled The World of Jimmy Callicut at Fox and ’a strange and stylized ghost story’ he’ll also direct called Julian, which Tim Burton is executive producing for Warner Bros.”\n\nSelected discography\n\nWith Oingo Boingo\n\nOingo Boingo (EP), 1RS, 1980.\n\nOnly a Lad, A&M, 1981.\n\nNothing to Fear, A&M, 1982.\n\nGood for Your Soul, A&M, 1984.\n\nDead Man’s Party, MCA, 1986.\n\nBOI-NGO, MCA, 1987.\n\nBoingo Alive, MCA, 1988.\n\nSkeletons in the Closet, A&M, 1988.\n\nDark at the End of the Tunnel, MCA, 1990.\n\nBest O’Boingo, MCA, 1991.\n\nFilm scores\n\nPee-wee’s Big Adventure/Back to School, Varese Sarabande, 1985.\n\nBeetlejuice, Geffen, 1988.\n\nBig Top Pee-wee, Arista, 1988.\n\nMidnight Run, MCA, 1988.\n\nWisdom, Varese Sarabande, 1988.\n\nHot to Trot, 1988.\n\nScrooged, 1988.\n\nBatman, Warner Bros., 1989.\n\nForbidden Zone, Varese Sarabande, 1990.\n\nDarkman, MCA, 1990.\n\nDick Tracy, Sire, 1990.\n\nEdward Scissorhands, MCA, 1990.\n\nNightbreed, MCA, 1990.\n\nArticle 99, Varese Sarabande, 1992.\n\nBatman Returns, Warner Bros., 1992.\n\nSommersby, Warner Bros., 1993.\n\n“March of the Dead Theme,” Army of Darkness, Varese Sarabande, 1993.\n\nOther\n\nSo-lo, MCA, 1985.\n\nMusic for a Darkened Theatre: Film and Television Music Volume One, MCA, 1990.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nStambler, Irwin, The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock, and Soul, St. Martin’s, 1989.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nAmerican Film, February 1991.\n\nEgg, December/January 1991.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, January 24, 1992; July 24, 1992.\n\nFanfare, September/October 1988; May/June 1989; November/December 1989.\n\nKeyboard, September 1987; October 1989.\n\nNew York Times, December 9, 1990.\n\nSeventeen, August 1987.\n\n—Debra Power\n\nELFMAN, Danny 1953–\n\n(Dan Elfman)\n\nPERSONAL\n\nFull name, Daniel Robert Elfman; born May 29, 1953, in Amarillo, TX; raised in Los Angeles, CA; son of Milton (a teacher and in the Air Force) and Blossom (a teacher and writer; maiden name, Bernstein) Elfman; brother of Robert Elfman (a filmmaker); uncle of Bodhi Elfman (an actor); married (marriage ended); married Bridget Fonda (an actress), November 29, 2003; children: (first marriage) Lola, Mali; (second marriage) one.\n\nAddresses: Agent—International Creative Management, 8942 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211.

Yet, his most catchy tune is perhaps the Jetson's-like theme of the animated television series The Simpsons. Elfman is a self-taught musician who can (and does) play virtually every instrument. In an interview for Time, Elfman resisted the label \"genius,\" instead describing himself as \"a good observer [who's] very tenacious.\" During his youth, Elfman was exposed to symphonies and classical film scores. His favorite composers are highly imagistic Eastern European composers such as Bartok, Prokofiev, Shostokovich, and Stravinsky. Yet, he is the first to admit that his exposure to classical music has been filtered through film. Alfred Hitchcock's composer Bernard Hermann (Psycho, Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much) is Elfman's all-time favorite, with Nino Rota (Fellini's 8 1/2 and Coppola's The Godfather) a close runner-up. His ongoing fascination with Hermann was one of the reasons Elfman joined up for the 1999 remake of Psycho, in which one can hear distinct homages that are reminscent of the original score without being derivative. Elfman also credits Cab Calloway, Gilbert and Sullivan, Ravel, Camille Saint-Saens, Dr. Seuss, Max Steiner, and Franz Waxman as inspirations. The \"dark cheeriness\" of songs, lyrics, score, and vocals for main character that Elfman composed for Nightmare Before Christmas are reminiscent of Kurt Weill, the German cabaret composer.\n\nElfman started playing the violin in high school. In his first gig, he played conga drums while touring France and Belgium with an avantgarde troupe, Grand Magic Circus. When eighteen, he spent a year in West Africa, after which he joined up with his brother's group, The Mystic Knights, otherwise known as the prequel to Oingo Boingo. Elfman taught himself composition by transcribing the jazz music of Duke Ellington. Elfman received his first taste of international stardom when Oingo Boingo's theme song for the film Weird Science (1985) made Billboard's Top 40. He remained active in the rock group until the band's retirement in 1996.\n\nAlthough Elfman's first composition for film was the low-budget cult film made by his brother, Richard, Forbidden Zone (1980), Elfman entered the Hollywood scene in 1985 when Tim Burton approached Elfman to score Pee Wee's Big Adventure based solely on Elfman's work with Oingo Boingo. Elfman subsequently composed the music for all three Pee Wee sequels and the television series that resulted from the film's popularity. Burton and Elfman have enjoyed a lucrative and creatively inspirational partnership ever since.\n\nAfter winning a Grammy for the neo-gothic soundtrack for Burton's Batman (1989), Elfman has had his pick of film projects. However, Elfman usually chooses to share his distinctive sound in films featuring alienated characters and macabre story-lines similar to Burton's portraits of melancholy and misunderstood outsiders. His music intensifies the atmosphere of bizarre, mysterious, and haunting alienation that complement Burton's highly stylized, moody films. In these films, music becomes part of a mosaic of poetic effects that turn the film into a composite of suspense. His quirky, gloomy musical style reflects the essential quality of the comic books that inspired some of films such as Batman, Darkman, and Dick Tracy, the latter leading to his second Grammy nomination. In Nightmare, for example, Elfman \"wraps minor scales, dissonance, and witchy vocals into a child-accessible soundtrack,\" explains Alyssa Katz. Against Elfman's elaborate musical backdrop, the spectator enters a different world in which Elfman's music becomes part of the ethereal mood. Film critic Jonathan Hoberman sums up Elfman's music for Nightmare before Christmas, Elfman's personal favorite, as \"a near perfect balance between nasty and cute.\" Nightmare, a \"funhouse of funereal glamour\" according to a film review in Time, balances a succession of funny, tragic, ironic characters in exaggeratedly dramatic situations.\n\nIn an interview, Elfman has said that \"writing the melody is the easy part. Art comes from what you do with the melody.\" His music is indeed artful: his haunting melodies match the rhythm of animated sequences, just as his changes in instrumental color highlight dramatic effect. His scores provide emotional support, accentuate the pacing of the films, and enhance the mood of the setting. Elfman creates a textured fabric that drapes over the narrative to magical effect. The music in Scissorhands, for example, emphasizes the character's alienation and increasing uncertainty as he becomes a cultural cast-off.\n\nAs counterpart to his exaggerated portraits of lonely outsiders, Elfman's interest in the gothic and creepy led to his participation in several horror films, including Delores Claiborne, Psycho, Tales from the Crypt, and Sleepy Hollow. Elfman has composed eerie music for many ghostly, otherwordly characters including those from Beetlejuice, Scrooged, My Favorite Martian, and Modern Vampires. Of the 300 films Elfman has been involved in, he readily admits to regretting at least a third of them. Moreover, his candid acknowledgement of the commercial enterprise of film composition, in which creative vision is frequently sacrificed for heightened sales, is part of Elfman's appeal. He has proven his independence in thought, action, and music.\n\n—Jill Gillespie"
