        "text": "At one time referred to by film maker David Puttnam as a new Ennio Morricone, Zbigniew Preisner was born in 1955. He is thought of as Poland’s leading composer of film music and also has gained much respect and recognition throughout the world for his emotive and melodic works for cinema. For a number of years the composer enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with his long time friend and film maker Krzysztof Kieslowski and together with scriptwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz the trio of artists worked on films such as DEKALOG,THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE,THREECOLOURS,WHITE,THREE COLOURS BLUEAND THREE COLOURS RED which garnered them global acclaim. The composer also worked with many respected film makers these included Hector Babenco on AT PLAY IN THE FIELDS OF THE LORD, Louis Malle on DAMAGE, Luis Mandoki on WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN, Charles Sturridge on FAIRYTALE-A TRUE STORY and Agniesza Holland on THE SECRET GARDEN. Preisner graduated from the Jagiellonian University in Krokov, where studied history. Initially Preisner had no intention of becoming a composer, and showed very little interest in music as a whole. It was not until he started his studies at the University that he began to take an interest in the subject. Preisner received no formal musical education, but taught himself the basics of composing etc. In the mid-to-late 1970,s he began to write music which was mainly for the theatre. He received much support and encouragement from already established composer Zygmunt Konieczny. During the last few years of the 1970’s Preisner worked on numerous theatre productions and in 1982,received his first commission to compose the music for a motion picture, this was BATTLEFIELDS which was directed by Atoni Krauze. But it was not until 1984 when he began his collaboration with Director Krzysztof Kieslowski that the composer’s career really began to take off. He is still very active in the composition of film music and also has written many works for concert hall performance."
