        "text": "Born in Poland in 1955, Zbigniew Preisner studied philosophy and history in the university of Cracow. In his twenties he started to study music in a autodidactical way: buying records and learning to write by taking the music in parts. He started to write his own compositions. His style has always been very romantic, influenced by romantic polish composers from the XIX century and others like Paganini or Sibelius. He has always emphasized the importance of melody in music. He doesn't like experimental modern music.\n\nIn 1981 he began his collaboration with filmmakers. While he was working with Antoni Krauze's movie \"Weather Report\" he met director Krzystof Kieslowski who invited him to work in his new movie \"No End\" about Poland under the martial law at the beginning of the 80s.\n\nWith that movie he began a very close collaboration with Kieslowski and his screenwriter Krzystof Piesiewicz. He works while the script for the movie is still being written but he usually also takes part in the editing of the movie.\n\nTheir next collaboration became a success worldwide. \"Decalogue\" won the European film award for best film and also awards in Cannes and other festivals. Kieslowski became one of the most importants directors in Europe and Preisner the leading film music composer of his generation.\n\nAt the same time he continued his collaboration with Kieslowski in such films like \"La double vie de Veronique\" and the trilogy of colours (\"Blue\", \"White\" and \"Red\") he also wrote soundtracks for others important directors like Louis Malle, Agniezka Holland or HÃ©ctor Babenco.\n\nHis collaboration with Kieslowski ended with his death in 1996. In the last years Preisner not only has continued his collaboration in others movies but he also has been involved in others musical projects like the writing of an opera to be performed in London and features for the Varsovia Simphony orchestra."
