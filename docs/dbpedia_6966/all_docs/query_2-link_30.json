        "text": "Mostly known in North America for his work composing the soundtrack to the Secret Garden, and recently for this song, Lacramosa – Requiem for My Friend, in the film Tree of Life, the Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner has an impressive array of projects to his name. This piece was originally intended as part of a collaborative project with the director Krzysztof Kieślowski, but became a memorial after Kieślowski’s death in 1996.\n\nHis work speaks to the continuation of a tradition of great composers, in no way cheapened by its currently heavy reliance on the medium of the movie soundtrack to express itself.\n\nI first heard this piece in my late teens, and still hope to someday write an epic poem in part inspired by its profound effect on my thinking at that time.\n\nFor More Information:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Preisner\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzysztof_Kie%C5%9Blowski\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Garden_%281993_film%29"
