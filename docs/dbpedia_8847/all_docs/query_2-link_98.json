The SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Pursuant to the requirements of section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act, I have the honor to submit the Twenty-first Annual Report, prepared by direction of the Federal Reserve Board, covering operations during the calendar year 1934. Yours respectfully, M. S. ECCLES, Governor. IX ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD Outstanding developments in the monetary and banking field in 1934, the year covered by this the Twenty-first Annual Report of the Federal Reserve Board, were revaluation of gold at a rate of $35 per ounce; a large volume of gold imports; expansion of bank deposits, reflecting chiefly Government spending; and further progress in the work of rehabilitating the banking structure. As a result of large gold imports during the year, reserve balances held by member banks of the Federal Reserve System rose to a new high level. Notwithstanding an increase in reserves required as a result of the increase in deposits, balances held by member banks in excess of requirements rose to the highest level on record. Federal Reserve bank holdings of United States Government securities remained unchanged during the year, while their holdings of discounts and acceptances declined to a small figure, reflecting the abundance of reserves which enabled member banks to repay borrowings at the Reserve banks and created a market outside of the Reserve banks for all available acceptances. In line with general declines in money rates, most of the Federal Reserve banks reduced their discount rates in the early part of 1934 and again in the last few weeks of that year or the early weeks of 1935. On February 1, 1935, the rates were l)i percent at 1 Reserve bank, 2 percent at 7 banks, and 2){ percent at 4, whereas at the beginning of 1934 the established rates ranged from 2 percent to 3K percent, with 5 banks at the highest of these levels. In December the Federal Reserve Board fixed at 2% percent the maximum rate of interest that member banks may pay on time and savings deposits after January 31, 1935. This was a reduction from 3 percent, the rate in effect since November 1933. Developments in 1934 were all in the direction of easier credit conditions. The expansion in excess reserves during the year, which was caused chiefly by gold imports, was not accompanied by an increase in bill or security holdings of the Federal Reserve banks that could be sold for the purpose of absorbing the excess reserves, if that should become desirable. With this limitation on the System's power to reduce member bank reserves by the sale of assets in the open market, the System's ability to restrict credit expansion, if it should become excessive, rests chiefly on new powers conferred upon 1 Z ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD it by recent legislation. Among these are the power in an emergency and with approval of the President to raise reserve requirements of member banks, provided in the act of May 12, 1933; authority to restrain speculative activities of member banks under different provisions of the Banking Act of 1933; and control of margin requirements on security loans by brokers and by banks, granted by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Duties and activities of the Board and of the Federal Reserve banks have been considerably enlarged by legislation passed during recent years, and a large part of the work of the System in 1934 arose out of this new legislation. These additional duties were imposed by the Banking Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and an act permitting direct loans for industrial purposes by Federal Reserve banks. Federal Reserve banks were authorized by an act of Congress approved June 19, 1934, to make advances within prescribed limitations for the purpose of providing working capital to established industrial and commercial enterprises. Special efforts were made by the Federal Reserve banks to discover needs for such loans and to give prompt attention to applications. By the end of the year more than $50,000,000 of applications for advances and for commitments to make advances had been approved by the Federal Reserve banks, $15,000,000 had been disbursed under these approved applications, and $10,000,000 of commitments were outstanding. The Banking Act of 1933 increased in various respects the scope of the Federal Reserve Board's authority over the activities of member banks. Under this act holding company affiliates of member banks are required to obtain from the Board permits to vote stock in member banks; as a consequence of broadening the scope of the provisions of the Clayton Act governing interlocking directorates the Board was required to pass upon a largely increased number of applications; and it was also required to pass upon interlocking directorates and correspondent relationships between member banks and dealers in securities. Many questions arising in connection with the separation of security company affiliates from banks have been referred to the Federal Reserve banks and to the Board. Examinations and other preparations were made by the Board and Federal Reserve agents, under provisions of the Banking Act of 1933, to certify State member banks for participation in the permanent plan of the Federal deposit insurance fund, but in view of the extension of the temporary deposit insurance fund for 1 year the Board was not called upon for such certifications in 1934. A number of private banks, subject to examination under the Banking Act of 1933, have elected to be examined by Federal Reserve banks. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 6 The Securities and Exchange Act imposed new duties on the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the fixing of margin requirements and the regulation of loans made for the purpose of purchasing and carrying securities. In September the Board issued a regulation (regulation T) on this subject. In addition to these new activities of the Board it has had to pass upon numerous reorganizations of member banks and applications for reduction of capital stock. Reorganizations of national banks have often necessitated new applications to the Board for the performance of trust powers. Performance of fiscal agency and other duties for the United States Treasury Department and various governmental credit agencies also increased the work of the Federal Reserve banks in 1934. By the end of 1934 banks closed during the bank holiday in March 1933 had nearly all been licensed to resume operations, reorganized, or placed in the hands of receivers for liquidation. The number of active banks belonging to the Federal Reserve System increased in 1934 by 431, in consequence of the licensing of additional banks, the organization of new national banks, and the entrance of nonmember banks into the System. The reopening of banks was facilitated by purchases of preferred stock and capital notes and debentures by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and the Corporation also hastened the paying off of depositors of closed banks by making loans on the remaining assets of these banks. The number of suspensions of licensed banks in 1934 was smaller than for any year since 1920. During the year most of the commercial banks in the country became members of the Federal Deposit Insurance System. Under the terms of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, on January 30 title to all gold held by the Federal Reserve banks was transferred to the United States Government at a valuation of $20.67 an ounce in exchange for an equivalent amount of gold certificates. On January 31 the President by proclamation reduced the weight of the gold dollar from 25.8 grains to 15%i grains of gold nine-tenths fine, thereby establishing the gold content of the dollar at 59.06 percent of its former weight and raising the price of gold from $20.67 to $35 a fine ounce. The resulting increase in the value of gold held by the United States, amounting to about $2,800,000,000, accrued to the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury announced that beginning February 1 he would be prepared until further notice to purchase gold and under certain conditions to sell gold for export at the new price. As a result of revaluation of the dollar, of the inclusion of gold purchased in previous weeks by the Government, and of large gold imports after January, the monetary gold stock of the United States increased in 1934 by $4,200,000,000. Imports of gold from abroad 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD reflected in part an excess of merchandise exports and in part a flow of capital to this country. Member bank reserve balances increased by about $1,400,000,000 during the year, of which $450,000,000 was absorbed in meeting increased reserve requirements arising from the growTth in bank deposits. Reserves in excess of legal requirements rose to nearly $1,800,000,000, an increase of about $950,000,000 during the year. Member banks employed a part of their available funds in increasing their investments, principally their holdings of United States Government securities. Holdings of open-market commercial paper and acceptances also increased somewhat, but repayment of customers' loans continued to exceed new loans made. Deposits at member banks, exclusive of interbank and United States Government deposits, increased by about $4,000,000,000 during 1934. The increase in deposits, other than bankers' deposits, was relatively larger at banks in.small towns and in the agricultural sections of the country than at banks in larger cities. Country banks, however, having no direct access to the open market, held a larger proportion of their new deposits as idle balances, while city banks invested a somewhat larger proportion of the increase in their deposits in Government securities and open-market paper. The abundance of funds seeking employment was reflected in continued declines in interest rates, which at the beginning of 1934 were already at exceptionally low levels. Open-market rates on 90day bankers' acceptances declined to one-eighth of 1 percent, and rates charged customers by banks in financial centers throughout the country declined to new low levels for the post-war period. Yields on long-term Treasury bonds declined to below 3 percent and yields on high-grade corporate bonds were at approximately the lowest levels of this century. New issues of corporate securities continued to be in small volume during 1934. Issues by States and local governments increased considerably and were substantially larger than in 1933 and somewhat larger than in 1932. Issues by the Federal Government and its agencies were larger than in any year since the war, far exceeding in amount all other new securities offered in the year. Prices of highgrade bonds advanced, while stock prices showed little change. Volume of production and trade for the year 1934 as a whole was larger than in 1933 and at the end of the year was at a higher level than at the beginning. Output of industrial products and employment in factories showed wide fluctuations during the year, although the movements were narrower than in 1933. Crop production, which had been relatively well maintained throughout the depression, showed a marked reduction in 1934 as a consequence of prolonged drought and of acreage reductions, but with higher prices, increased marketings of livestock, and Govern ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 5 ment rental and benefit payments farm income was larger than in 1933. Construction work on public projects showed a considerable increase, while private construction continued in small volume. Retail trade increased in the course of the year and was considerably larger in rural areas than in 1933. Wholesale prices of agricultural products and foods advanced sharply in 1934, as in 1933, while prices of other commodities showed little change from the level reached at the end of 1933, which was higher than at the beginning of that year. GOLD AND SILVER IN 1934 Important factors in the monetary situation in 1934 were legislative enactments and administrative measures in reference to gold and silver. Among these were the enactment of the Gold Reserve Act, the subsequent revaluation of the dollar, the passage of the Silver Purchase Act, and the acquisitions of silver under authority of this act. The provisions of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 are summarized in a subsequent section of this report. The act was passed and approved on January 30, 1934, and on that date title to gold held by the Federal Reserve banks was transferred to the United States Government. The President's proclamation of January 31, 1934.—By virtue of the powers granted in the act approved May 12, 1933, as amended by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, the President issued a proclamation on January 31, reducing the weight of the gold dollar from 25.8 grains to 15%i grains of gold nine-tenths fine. In the proclamation the President reserved the right, within the limits prescribed by the law, to alter or modify the weight of the gold dollar as the interest of the United States might require. On January 31 the mints were authorized by the Treasury regulations issued under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 to purchase (a) gold recovered from natural deposits in the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, which shall not have entered into monetary or industrial use, (6) unmelted scrap gold, and (c) gold imported into the United States after January 30, 1934. Purchases were to be made at the rate of $35 per fine troy ounce less a handling charge of }{ percent and the usual mint charges. The Secretary of the Treasury stated that whenever our exchange rates with gold standard currencies should reach the gold export point he would, until further notice, also sell gold for export to foreign central banks at the rate of $35 per fine troy ounce plus a handling charge of % percent. Most of the purchases of imported gold as well as sales of gold for export were to be made through the Federal reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United States. Increase in monetary gold stock of the United States.—Reduction in the gold content of the dollar immediately increased the value of the reported gold holdings of the Treasury by approximately $2,800, 6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 000,000. At the same time the reported monetary gold stock of the country was further increased by the addition of about $200,000,000 of gold purchased by the Government in connection with its goldbuying program of previous months. At the outset these increases in the gold stock of the country were retained as an addition to the cash holdings of the Treasury and had no effect upon Federal Reserve bank or member bank reserves. During the remainder of the year, however, the Treasury transferred some of this additional gold to the Federal Reserve banks in the form of gold certificate credits, thus increasing its deposits with Federal Reserve banks. As these deposits were reduced by Treasury expenditures in the course of the year, member banks obtained additional reserve funds. In the months following revaluation there were large imports of gold, as well as substantial purchases of newly produced and other domestic gold. In the course of the year the gold stock was increased by a total amount of $4,202,000,000, comprising the increment of $2,812,000,000 resulting from revaluation, $1,217,000,000, of net imports and releases from earmark, including imports of gold purchased by the Government prior to January 31, 1934, and $174,000,000 obtained from production, Government holdings in this country not previously reported, return of coin by the public, purchases of scrap, old gold, and the like. There were substantial changes in the distribution of the monetary gold stock during the year, as shown in the table below. The Treasury turned over $2,000,000,000 of the increment resulting from reduction in the gold content of the dollar to the exchange stabilization fund and placed $812,000,000 in a special balance held separately as a part of the general fund. Subsequently, $200,000,000 of gold from the exchange stabilization fund was deposited by the Treasury with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for use by the fund and about $8,000,000 from the $812,000,000 balance was transferred to the Federal Reserve banks under section 13b of the Federal Reserve Act, which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to the Federal Reserve banks certain amounts against advances and commitments to provide working capital for industrial and commercial concerns.

Return of gold certificates and gold coin from circulation and release of gold held in the general fund against specific liabilities provided an additional amount of $125,000,000 of gold available for use by the Treasury or for the Reserve banks' gold-certificate funds. As a result of the gold thus released, of that made available from the revaluation increment, imports, earmarked supplies, new production, and new monetary holdings of the public, Federal Reserve bank goldcertificate reserves and Treasury gold not reported as held in special balances showed a total increase of $1,722,000,000. The increase in Reserve bank gold-certificate reserves amounted to $1,574,000,000. Gold imports.—Following revaluation of the dollar and announcement of the Treasury's willingness to buy and sell gold, there was a large flow of gold to the United States. Net imports in the year amounted to $1,134,000,000 and net releases from earmark to $83,000,000. Of the net imports $500,000,000 came from England, $260,000,000 from France, and the rest from Holland, Canada, India, Mexico, and other countries. These imports of gold were, in considerable measure, an outcome of the definite fixation, at a lower value, of the dollar in terms of gold and foreign currencies. Definitive revaluation in January 1934 followed 9 months during which the prevailing tendency of the dollar on the exchanges was downward. The premium on foreign currencies after April 1933 was an inducement to American sales of merchandise in foreign markets and a corresponding discouragement to American purchases abroad. The tendency to increase the export 129288—35 2 8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD surplus in the country's merchandise trade with the world, however, was not immediately apparent, for the initial decline of the dollar in the spring of 1933 was accompanied by a wave of domestic buying that involved the purchase of foreign products as well. A rapid increase of imports at that time—chiefly in the form of raw materials— reversed the country's balance of trade for the period May through September as a whole. As the buying movement subsided, however, and the stimulus to American sales abroad began to have some effect in increased shipments of American manufactures and other products, the export surplus reappeared. By November 1933 it was on a considerable scale, and in the 12 months ending October 1934 the surplus of the country's merchandise trade with the world reached a figure of $510,000,000 as compared with $180,000,000 in the preceding 12 months. The increased demand for dollars to pay for this growing surplus of merchandise exports was more than offset in the closing months of 1933 and in January 1934 by gold purchases abroad for account of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Treasury. Although these purchases served to balance the international transactions of the country, they had no immediate effect on member bank reserves since the funds employed were borrowed from the market. It was not until the new gold legislation in 1934 became effective that these purchases were taken up into monetary gold stock. Under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 and the President's proclamation of January 31 the international gold value of the dollar was fixed by administrative action somewhat below the level to which it had already fallen on the exchanges. The enlarged surplus of merchandise exports continued, and its effects were intensified to an important degree by a movement of capital to the United States. This movement was particularly great in the 2 months that followed establishment of a new gold level for the dollar. The $650,000,000 of gold acquired by the Treasury at that time reflected for the most part a return of American funds from abroad and a movement of foreign capital into dollar balances and securities. Subsequently gold continued to move into the United States, although on a much diminished scale, until August when a moderate reversal of the movement occurred. The interruption to the inward flow of gold appears to have been due in some measure to the more active silver policy adopted under the powers conferred by the Silver Purchase Act. This act is discussed in a subsequent section. Following nationalization of silver on August 9 there was a temporary tendency for capital to move abroad, and American purchases of silver in London, Shanghai, and other centers, as evidenced by shipments to this country, attained a volume of about $20,000,000 a month. For a time these factors were sufficient to carry gold out of the country; but the advent of the large surplus of ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 9 merchandise exports in the fall, when Europe was receiving little from American tourists, and the development of political difficulties in certain countries of the gold bloc, led to a further substantial movement of gold to the United States in the closing months of the year. Silver imports at this time were in diminished volume, China having suspended the free operation of the silver standard in October. World gold reserves.—The increase in monetary gold stock of the United States during 1934 was not accompanied by a reduction in the aggregate of central bank reserves abroad. On the contrary, the reported gold reserves of foreign central banks and governments increased by $130,000,000, valued at $35 an ounce. Additions to central gold reserves of the United States and other countries during 1934 came largely from the following sources, expressed in terms of the dollar at its new^ valuation: The total output of the world's gold mines in 1934 had a dcllar value of $940,000,000; gold dishoarded in the Orient during the year amounted to $250,000000; and about $100,000,000 of domestic scrap gold from ornaments and other personal possessions and from industrial uses was sold to the United States Treasury in 1934. The combined total of scrap sold to the Treasury, gold released from oriental holdings, and world mining output thus accounts for about $1,290,000,000 of the $1,580,000,000 increase in reported gold reserves of central banks and governments of the world during 1934. The remainder, amounting to nearly $300,000,000, affords a rough indication of the amount of gold coming out of unreported holdings in western countries. Included in unreported holdings are those of the British exchange equalization fund. Although reported gold reserves of foreign countries as a whole increased somewhat during 1934, in a number of countries there were substantial declines. Eeserves in Germany declined $124,000,000; in Italy $114,000,000; in the Netherlands $54,000,000; in Belgium $53,000,000; in Switzerland $29,000,000; and in New Zealand $16,000,000. Reserves in Czechoslovakia increased $26,000,000; in Japan $35,000,000; in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics $40,000,000; and in South Africa $43,000,000. By far the largest increase, however, occurred in gold reserves of the Bank of France, which, notwithstanding considerable fluctuations, were $333,000,000 larger at the end of the year than at the beginning. They were still, however, somewhat below the peak attained in December 1932. Since the outbreak of the World War the greatest increases in gold reserves have been in the United States and France. The chart shows the movements in central gold reserves of five leading financial countries during a 20-year period. It is so arranged as to value reserves since January 1934 at $35 an ounce and previously at $20.67. without destroying the continuity of the series. 10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD In the early years of the period gold holdings of the Federal Reserve banks were increased not only by gold imports but by the transfer of reserves from member bank vaults, and reserves of central banks in England, France, and Germany were increased by the recall of gold from monetary circulation to aid in prosecuting the war. Both the United States and the Netherlands received large amounts of gold during the war in payment for purchases of materials by the belligerents. In the early post-war period gold continued to flow to the United States, which occupied a creditor position and was the most important free market for the metal until the general return to the gold standard that began toward the end of 1924. GOLD RESERVES OF CENTRAL BANKS AND GOVERNMENTS ( End of year 1913-1924, end of month thereafter ) United States France 7 7 i England 1914 1916 1918 1920 1922 1924 1926 1928 1930 1932 \"1934 After de facto stabilization of the franc at the end of 1926, the gold movement for 5 years was predominantly toward France. The movement reflected the fact that France during the period of currency depreciation had experienced a continuous outflow of capital which had been balanced in her international payments by a large excess of exports over imports. When after de facto stabilization capital began to flow back to France, the Bank of France accumulated both gold and foreign exchange. The rapid increase in gold reserves of the Bank of France after England's departure from the gold standard in September 1931 reflected mainly the bank's conversion into gold of these previously acquired foreign exchange holdings in order to avoid further losses through currency depreciation abroad. The ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 11 increase at the same time of gold reserves in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland was in part of a similar character. Since the only important foreign exchange holdings on which central banks could freely realize were in New York, most of the gold acquired was drawn from the United States. The movements were concentrated in the fall of 1931 and the spring of 1932. From that time until the end of 1934 foreign countries added little gold to their reported holdings, while the United States gained large amounts of gold in the last half of 1932 and again in 1934. Silver Purchase Act of 1934.—Monetary silver stock of the United States increased considerably in 1934. Most of the increase took place as a result of the Silver Purchase Act. The act, which became law on June 19, declared it to be the policy of the United States that the proportion of silver to gold in metallic monetary stocks in the United States be increased with the ultimate objective of having and maintaining one-quarter of the value of such stocks in silver. To attain this objective the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to purchase silver at home or abroad at such rates and at such times and upon such terms and conditions as he might deem reasonable and most advantageous to the public interest, provided, however, that no purchase should be made at a price in excess of the monetary value of the silver (approximately $1.29 per fine ounce) and that no purchase of silver situated in the continental United States on May 1, 1934, should be made at a price in excess of 50 cents per fine ounce. The President was further given the power to order the delivery to the mints of any or all silver by whomever owned or possessed. Currency was to be exchanged for such silver to the amount of its monetary value, less such deductions for seigniorage and other charges as the President should approve, provided that in no case should the amount of currency exchanged be less than the value of silver at the time of the order as determined by the market price over a reasonable period of time. Acting under these powers the President on August 9 ordered that with certain exceptions all silver situated in the United States on that date should be delivered to the mints within 90 days in exchange for currency at the rate of approximately 50 cents per fine ounce of silver. Among the types of silver to which the order did not apply were silver held for industrial, professional, and artistic use, and silverware; as well as newly mined domestic silver not subsequently processed to a fineness of over 0.8, which could be sold to the mints at 64% cents under the President's proclamation of December 21, 1933. Through January 4, 1935, silver with a net cost value of about $56,000,000 had been turned in under the nationalization order. Other operations under the Silver Purchase Act are not reported separately, but from the time of the nationalization order to the end of the year there were 12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD net imports of silver into the United States costing about $74,000,000. In addition, during 1934 silver with a net cost value of about $14,000,000 was acquired by the Treasury from domestic mines. Against the cost of the silver acquired from such sources and against silver held in the Treasury on June 14 with a monetary value of about $80,000,000, the Treasury issued silver certificates and a small amount of coin. Certificates outstanding increased from less than $500,000,000 at the beginning of the year to $700,000,000 at the end. Silver certificates and coin combined increased by $225,000,000. ALTERED RESERVE SITUATION IN 1934 Largely as a result of the inflow of gold, member bank reserve balances, which at the end of 1933 were nearly $400,000,000 larger than in 1929, were further increased by about $1,400,000,000 in 1934. At the end of the year reserve balances held by member banks totaled $4,100,000,000, the largest amount ever held, and were $1,800,000,000 in excess of requirements. Factors in growth.—The table shows the principal factors that influenced the volume of member bank reserve balances and their changes during the 4 years from the end of 1929 to the end of 1933 and also during the year 1934. The table is arranged to bring out the fact that increases in Reserve bank credit, in gold stock, and in Treasury and national bank currency outstanding have the effect of increasing the supply of funds available for bank reserves, while decreases in these items reduce this supply. Increases in money in circulation, in Treasury cash and deposits with Federal Reserve banks, in nonmember deposits at Federal Reserve banks, and in other Federal Reserve accounts, on the other hand, reduce, and decreases in these items increase, the supply of funds available for bank reserves. The chart shows weekly movements of these various items during the past 6 years.

With a view to establishing and maintaining easy money conditions, the Federal Reserve banks had increased their holdings of United States Government securities by the end of 1933 to $2,400,000,000. 14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD During 1934 there were no further open-market purchases of securities by the Federal Reserve banks; yet member bank reserves were increased by a larger amount than in the preceding 4 years to a level about 70 percent higher than in the years of active business before the depression. In addition, funds were created in the Treasury by operations under gold and silver legislation during the year. This growth of reserves in 1934 largely resulted from the increase in gold stock described in the previous section and, in contrast with increases in reserves in the preceding 4-year period, occurred without any expansion in the holdings of securities by the Federal Reserve banks. With the reserve funds obtained from gold imports member banks were able to pay off practically all of their remaining borrowings at the Federal Reserve banks, and banks and private lenders also absorbed all of the bankers' acceptances on the market, with the consequence that Reserve bank holdings of acceptances declined to a small volume. Member bank excess reserves.—As a result of the increase in reserve balances during 1934 excess reserves of member banks rose to new record levels. At the close of 1933 excess reserves amounted to about $850,000,000. During 1934 member bank reserve balances increased by approximately $1,400,000,000, but since reserve requirements increased $450,000,000 the actual rise in excess reserves amounted to $950,000,000, bringing the total volume of excess reserves at the end of the year to $1,800,000,000. Weekly fluctuations in the volume of excess reserves in recent years are shown on the chart. In August excess reserves at times amounted to over $1,900,000,000, but declined somewhat in the autumn.

The decline in excess reserves after August resulted from an increase in required reserves, which reflected a considerable expansion in member bank deposits. 15 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD Excess reserves continued to be well distributed among the major groups of banks in the country. About $650,000,000 were held by New York City banks, $760,000,000 by banks in Chicago and other reserve cities, and $370,000,000 by country banks. The largest increase in the year—$500,000,000—occurred at New York City banks, reflecting in large part the increased holdings by banks in New York of balances for other banks.

Substantial increases in excess reserves occurred at member banks in all Federal Reserve districts. The largest relative increases were in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia districts. The smallest increases occurred in the Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis districts. As shown in a subsequent section of this report many of the interior banks increased their balances due from other banks during the year. Thus city banks in effect were holding some of the excess reserves of the country banks. 16 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD Money in circulation.—The amount of money in circulation showed little net change for 1934 as a whole, and fluctuations during the year were more in accordance with the usual seasonal pattern than at any time since the latter part of 1930. There were, however, changes in the composition of money in circulation by denominations and by kinds of money. Currency continued to return from hoarding in 1934, though in smaller volume than during the latter part of 1933, and this return flow was offset by a growing demand for currency for active use, reflecting partly an increase in wage payments and retail trade and partly a tendency to use cash rather than checks as a consequence of the tax on checks and increased service charges on checking accounts. Although there was a considerable reduction in the amount of hoarded currency in 1934, the amount of currency not in active use continued at a high level. An indication of the continued return of currency from hoarding is contained in the data for large denominations. Currency with denominations of $20 and over declined by $120,000,000 during the year. The smaller denomination currency, on the other hand, and also subsidiary silver and minor coin showed a net increase for the year. The following table shows by denominations the amount of paper currency outside of Federal Reserve banks and Treasury offices. Figures for December 31, 1934, are compared with those for October 31, 1930, just prior to the large increase in hoarded currency, as well as with those for December 30, 1933.

In the 4-year period the $1 bills showed an increase of 9 percent and $5 bills showed an increase of 17 percent. The larger denominations, however, all showed increases which ranged from about 25 percent in the case of $10 and $20 notes to about 95 percent for notes in denominations of over $50. A portion of the increase in smaller denomination currency is probably attributable to a growth ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 17 in the demand for currency as a result of the lack of banking facilities in some communities, as well as to other factors causing an increase in the use of currency instead of checks. A portion also probably reflects a continuance of hoarding, and it is likely that most of the increase in currency in denominations of $20 and over reflects the hoarding influence. There was also some shift during 1934 in the kinds of currency in circulation. Reductions of about $100,000,000 each occurred in gold certificates, Federal Reserve bank notes, and national bank notes. The decline in gold certificates represented a continuation of their retirement from circulation under Treasury order, Federal Reserve bank notes were retired by the Reserve banks with the passing of the emergency which occasioned their issue, and the decline in national bank notes reflected the fact that national banks, having a large volume of excess reserves, had no incentive for incurring the expense, including the }i percent tax, of keeping their notes outstanding. The reduction in these classes of currency was partly offset by an increase of nearly $200,000,000 in silver certificates and of more than $100,000,000 of Federal Reserve notes in circulation. MEMBER BANK CREDIT On the basis of the increased reserves received in 1934, member banks further increased their investments. The increase was principally in holdings of Government securities, and the funds thus supplied, after being expended by the Government, were used either to repay bank loans or were deposited at banks. At the end of the year total deposits of all member banks were larger than at any time since the autumn of 1931, while total loans and investments were larger than at any time since the first half of 1932. The increase in loans and investments was not so large as that in deposits, owing principally to the fact that banks held a larger portion of their funds in the form of excess reserves. Country and reserve city banks also increased their balances with other banks, and the growth in interbank deposits comprised a large part of the increase in total deposits. Although city banks showed relatively larger increases in investments, country banks in rural areas reported proportionately larger increases in deposits, reflecting principally distribution of funds throughout the country by Treasury expenditures, as well as the increase in agricultural income in 1934. Loans and investments.—Changes in loans and investments of member banks during 1934 are shown in the following table and changes from the beginning of 1922 are shown on the chart. The most important of these changes were the increase of $2,650,000,000 in holdings of direct obligations of the United States Government and that of $1,000,000,000 in securities guaranteed by the United States, 18 ANNUAL BEPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD including those guaranteed as to principal only as well as those guaranteed as to interest and principal. The guaranteed obligations were in part purchased and in part obtained in exchange for mortgage loans. Holdings of other securities also showed some increase.

Customers7 loans made primarily for business purposes showed an increase of $230,000,000 in the third quarter of the year and a corresponding decrease in the last quarter. These changes were largely of a seasonal nature and occurred at city banks.

A substantial part of the increase during the year represented a growth in interbank balances and United States Government deposits, and in addition at the end of 1934 checks on other banks and other items in process of collection held by banks were, largely for temporary reasons, considerably larger in amount than at the end of 1933. When adjustment is made for increases in these items, the growth of customers' deposits during the year amounted to about $4,000,000,000. The aggregate of deposits thus adjusted was approximately $25,000,000,000, as compared with about $21,000,000,000 on December 30, 1933, and was larger than that for any report date since the autumn of 1931. In 1929 and 1930 the corresponding figure was close to $30,000,000,000. A small part of the increase in deposits since 1933 reflects additions to membership in the Federal Reserve System. Changes during 1934 in various types of deposits are shown in the following table. D E P O S I T S AT M E M B E R BANKS fin millions of dollars] Dec. 30, 1933 U. S.

These deposits showed an increase of $2,840,000,000, a part of which represented checks in process of collection, while time deposits of the same group of customers increased in the year by about $1,060,000,000. United States Government deposits with member banks showed an increase of nearly $670,000,000 in the year, while Postal Savings deposits were decreased by $325,000,000, reflecting the unwillingness of some banks to hold such deposits, largely because of the rate of interest required to be paid on them. Deposits of States, counties, and municipalities increased by about $470,000,000. There was an increase of $1,500,000,000 in balances due to banks, which at the end of the year aggregated nearly $4,900,000,000, the largest amount ever reported. This increase, nearly all of which occurred in balances payable on demand, occurred notwithstanding the prohibition against the payment of interest on demand deposits, and represented further accumulation of idle funds by banks. Factors in growth of deposits.—The most important factors in the increase in deposits during the year were Treasury expenditures, which were made from funds raised by the sale of securities to banks, by the deposit with the Reserve banks of gold certificates based on newly acquired gold, and by the issuance of silver certificates. The Treasury during 1934 purchased about $1,400,000,000 of gold and $200,000,000 of silver. The sale of this gold to the Treasury, which paid for it by drafts on the Reserve banks, increased member bank reserve balances. Except to the extent that gold purchases abroad by importers of the gold were paid for by drawing down balances held abroad by banks in this country, the increase in the gold stock resulted in an increase in deposits at commercial banks. In connection with the silver purchases, silver certificates were issued in an amount corresponding approximately to the purchase price of the silver bought, and these certificates were either paid into circulation directly by the Treasury or deposited with the Reserve banks. In the former case deposit of an equivalent amount of currency at member banks and by them at the Reserve banks, and in the latter case the expenditure of the Treasury balance with the Reserve banks, resulted in an increase of deposits and of reserves of member banks. In addition to deposits created by Government purchases of .]the precious metals, additional deposits resulted from sales of United States Government obligations to banks and the subsequent disbursement of the funds by the Treasury. As previously shown, member bank holdings of direct obligations of the Government increased by $2,650,000,000 during the year. Purchases of Home Owners' Loan Corporation bonds and Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation bonds by ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 21 banks gave new funds to former holders, who had mostly received the bonds in exchange for outstanding mortgage loans. Deposits by classes of banks and by districts.—Although the growth in deposits at member banks during 1934 was spread throughout the country, there were differences in changes at various classes of banks, largely as a result of the Treasury in effect borrowing from banks in one locality and expending the money and thus creating deposits in other sections of the country. Deposits created in this manner, however, did not always return to the banks that purchased the securities. The following table shows increases during 1934 in deposits at member banks in New York City, in other reserve cities, and elsewhere. New York City banks showed proportionately the largest increases in total deposits, but in the adjusted customers' deposits the increase was greatest at country banks. Country banks in places with a population of under 15,000 in 21 agricultural States showed an increase of 26 percent in deposits, as compared with an increase of 17 percent at other country banks and of 21 percent at reserve city banks (including central reserve city banks in Chicago).

Although country banks showed a larger increase in adjusted customers' deposits in 1934 than did city banks, the net decline since 1929 was much larger in the case of country banks, amounting to about 27 percent as compared with a net decline of about 7 percent for all central reserve and reserve city banks. This difference was due in part to the larger volume of failures among country banks since 1929, and some of the increase in deposits at country banks in 1934 was due to the reopening of a number of unlicensed banks which were not included in the reports for 1933. By geographical areas, the largest increases during 1934 in the adjusted customers' deposits occurred in the Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts, while the smallest were in the New York, Boston, and Philadelphia districts. In nearly all districts country banks showed larger increases in deposits than did 22 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD city banks. More detailed information by localities indicates that deposits expanded most at rural banks in the Corn Belt and the eastern cotton- and tobacco-growing States. In the States most affected by drought, increases among rural banks were relatively smaller, although in most cases substantial. These regional differences in the growth of deposits reflect largely the influence of Treasury operations, .together with increased agricultural income and increased activity in certain industries during the year. The Treasury raised more funds in the larger cities than it expended in those cities, wiiile in the predominantly rural regions Treasury disbursements were considerably in excess of receipts. The excess of Treasury disbursements over receipts was in the neighborhood of $300,000,000 each in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco districts, and around $150,000,000 each in the St. Louis, Atlanta, and Dallas districts. In each of these districts, except Atlanta and San Francisco, this excess alone was more than sufficient to account for the increase in adjusted^ deposits. Withdrawals by the Treasury were concentrated largely in the New York district, where receipts exceeded disbursements by about $1,300,000,000. Deposits in this district, however, were increased by large gold imports received during the year. Agricultural income, even when Federal Government rental and benefit payments are excluded, was somewhat larger in 1934 than in other recent years and especially so in those agricultural regions not affected by drought. In the Chicago and Cleveland districts increased activity in the automobile, agricultural implement, and meat-packing industries was also a factor in increased deposits. Use of funds by banks.—During 1934 member banks in addition to increasing their investments, as previously shown, also increased considerably their excess reserves with Federal Reserve banks and their balances due from other banks. For individual banks both of these items represent the accumulation of idle funds. For the banking system as a whole only the volume of excess reserves represents the supply of idle banking funds, while changes in interbank balances represent merely the shifting of excess reserves among the member banks. During 1934 there was considerable shifting of this nature, and an analysis of bank statements by classes of banks and by regions indicates the manner in which funds were distributed throughout the country during the year and also the extent to which the different groups invested their available funds or held them in idle balances. The following table shows changes during 1934 in loans and investments and certain other balance sheet items by classes of banks. The extent to which available funds were put to active use or permitted to remain in inactive balances varied among the different ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 23 groups of banks. It would appear that country banks showed a relatively larger increase in deposits of local customers than did city banks, but that country banks invested a smaller portion of their additional funds and carried a larger portion in idle balances than did city banks.

All deposits, other than United States Government, Postal Savings, and interbank deposits, minus checks and other cash items reported as on hand or in process of collection. Country banks, which showed an increase of over $1,500,000,000 in deposits of locabcustomers and a decrease of $200,000,000 in loans, increased their investments by about $900,000,000. Their balances with other banks and cash holdings and reserves showed a total increase of over $820,000,000, of which about $80,000,000 represented an increase in required reserves. These banks had an increase in available unused balances of about $740,000,000 in the course of 1934, as compared with an increase of approximately $900,000,000 in investments. Reserve city banks, other than central reserve city banks in New York, showed increases of over $1,800,000,000 in adjusted customers' deposits and of nearly $800,000,000 in balances due to other banks and a decrease of about $300,000,000 in loans. They increased their investments b j over $1,750,000,000, while their balances due from other banks, cash holdings, and excess reserves with Federal Reserve banks showed a total increase of over $900,000,000. The ratio of funds invested to those held in idle balances was considerably larger than in the case of country banks. It should be noted, furthermore, that these banks were holding a larger amount of balances for other banks, which are subject to immediate call and therefore are ordinarily kept in 129288—35 3 24 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD readily available form. When allowance is made for this factor the balance of idle funds available to these banks increased by little more than $100,000,000 in the year. Member banks in New York City showed increases of about $700,000,000 in adjusted deposits, $600,000,000 in bankers' balances, and $350,000,000 in Government deposits, while their loans declined by nearly $300,000,000. They increased their investments by $1,060,000,000 and their cash and excess reserves by $550,000,000. The increase in balances due to banks exceeded the increase in idle funds at New York City banks. The growth in bankers' balances in New York would indicate that in the course of the year New York City banks in effect received a large part of the excess reserves of other banks. Analyzing similar figures by districts it appears that banks in the New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts placed a larger portion of their available funds in investments and a smaller portion in idle balances than did banks in other districts, while banks in the Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas districts accumulated relatively larger idle balances. In the majority of districts country banks showed more of a tendency to accumulate reserves and balances with other banks, while city banks invested a relatively larger portion of the increase in deposits of their customers. It would appear that the incidence of Treasury borrowing and expenditures during 1934, together with agricultural and industrial developments, was instrumental in distributing funds throughout the country. Country banks received an increase in deposits, but did not increase their purchases of Government securities by the same amount. Instead they built up balances with banks in the larger cities. These country-bank deposits received through the clearing system were added to the credit of the city banks at the Reserve banks. Most of the increase in excess reserves during 1934, therefore, although carried by city banks, was represented by balances held by these banks for their country correspondents and was at the disposal of and subject to call by country banks. PROGRESS OF BANKING RECONSTRUCTION During the year 1934 banking facilities available to the public increased considerably. About 19,000 banking offices of unrestricted institutions, including mutual savings and private banks, were in operation at the end of the year, of which 3,000 were branches. This represented an increase of 1,000 head offices and about 200 branches during the year. Active membership in the Federal Reserve System increased by 431 banks to 6,442 by the end of the year. The increase was accounted for in part by licensing of restricted banks, in part by organization of ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 25 new banks, and in part by admission to membership of nonmember State banks. Deposits in member banks as of December 31, 1934, amounted to $33,850,000,000, which was about 86 percent of the deposits in all commercial banks, exclusive of mutual savings banks, and about 69 percent of the deposits in all banks, inclusive of mutual savings banks. Bank suspensions in 1934.—Bank suspensions in 1934 were fewer than, in any year since 1920. The suspensions during the year comprised 57 licensed banks with deposits of $36,937,000/ one of which, with deposits at time of suspension of $40,000, was a member of the Federal Reserve System. There were eight other suspensions among banks participating in Federal deposit insurance. Unlicensed banks.—By the end of 1934 the number of unlicensed banks had been reduced to relatively unimportant proportions. After the bank holiday in March 1933 more than 4,500 banks with deposits of about $4,200,000,000 were reported as not licensed to conduct an unrestricted business. By the beginning of 1934 these had been reduced to about 1,800 banks with deposits of approximately $1,000,000,000, and by the end of the year only about 160 banks with deposits of approximately $90,000,000 were reported as remaining unlicensed, after deducting 927r banks placed in liquidation or receivership during the year. Most of the remaining unlicensed banks were not members of the Federal Reserve System, as is shown by the following table: UNLICENSED BANKS Jan. 1, 1934 Number National _ _ State member ..

Disposition of unlicensed banks.—During the 22 months following the banking crisis the number of unlicensed banks was reduced in a variety of ways. Many, after receiving new capital, were reopened, while others were merged with active institutions. In some cases the best assets and a proportionate amount of deposits were drawn into newly chartered institutions and the old banks were placed in liquidation. Many were placed directly in liquidation. An accounting for all of the 4,500 banks which were unlicensed in March 1933 is not yet possible. The Comptroller of the Currency, however, has made public figures with respect to the disposition of T Revised. 26 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD the 1,417 1 national banks which had not been licensed to operate on an unrestricted basis after the banking holiday of March 1933. By December 31, 1934, 1,088 unlicensed national banks had been reorganized under old or new charters or merged with other national banks; 30 had given up their national charters; 294 had been disapproved for reorganization and placed in receivership; and 5 remained unlicensed. Loans to closed banks.—Since its organization in February 1932, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has been active in releasing funds to depositors of closed banks by making loans to conservators and receivers. Authorizations of loans of this character aggregated $1,045,000,000 from February 2, 1932 to December 31, 1934, and of this three-fourths had actually been disbursed. As repayments of $318,000,000 had been received, a balance of $444,000,000 of such loans was outstanding at the end of 1934. New capital for banks.—Many unlicensed banks were able to reopen during 1934 and many active banks were strengthened by the addition of capital funds, a large part of which was furnished by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. During the year the program for strengthening the capital structure of the banking system initiated in the summer of 1933 was pressed through the joint efforts of Federal and State agencies. The program was furthered by the Comptroller of the Currency in the case of national banks, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the case of nonmember banks whose deposits were insured by the Corporation, and by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks in the case of State member banks. When the program was initiated in 1933, the Federal Reserve Board requested the Federal Reserve agents to keep in touch with such banks in their respective districts as might require assistance, and during the year 1934 Federal Reserve officials continued to cooperate with the various supervisory authorities in developing and consummating plans for strengthening the capital of member banks. On December 31, 1934, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation had an aggregate investment of $845,960,000 in the capital structure of banks and had lent in addition $19,124,000 to local interests in order to enable them to make purchases of preferred stock. The investments included $585,858,000 in preferred stock and $260,102,000 in capital notes and debentures. In addition, the Corporation had authorized, contingent upon the performance of certain conditions, investments of $209,076,000 more in the capital structure of banks. Altogether 6,900 banking institutions had had their capital structures strengthened by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. 1 Includes 6 national banks which were licensed on Mar. 15, 1933, but whose licenses were subsequently revoked, and 1 which suspended before the banking holiday and was placed in conservatorship subsequent thereto; also includes 10 nonnational banks in the District of Columbia subject to the supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 27 The largest part of the investments of the Corporation in the capital structure of banks was made after the beginning of 1934, at which time the total investments did not exceed $250,000,000. Condition reports of member banks as of December 31, 1934, indicated that the capital structure of member banks included $553,574,000 of preferred stock and $118,515,000 of capital notes and debentures, an aggregate of $672,089,000. Most of this was held by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Federal deposit insurance.—An important contribution to stability in the banking structure during the year was the insurance of bank deposits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. On January 1, 1934, the Corporation began the administration of a temporary fund, which insured the deposits of all participating banks up to $2,500 on the net approved claim of each depositor. All licensed banks belonging to the Federal Reserve System were required to become members of the insurance fund, and State banks which were not members of the Federal Reserve System were permitted to participate after examination and after certification of State authorities that they were in solvent condition. Under the Banking Act of 1933, it was provided that the temporary fund should be effective from January 1, 1934* through June 30, 1934, after which the permanent plan, which would cover a larger percentage of deposits, would become effective. By the act of June 16, 1934, the temporary plan was extended to operate from July 1, 1934, through June 30, 1935, but provision was made to insure each depositor during this period up to $5,000. Mutual savings banks which continued membership were given the option of covering their deposits up to $2,500 or up to $5,000. A number of mutual savings banks discontinued participation in the fund on July 1, 1934, in part because of the establishment of a State fund for mutual savings banks in New York. When operations began on January 1, 1934, 12,617 banks were members of the fund and this number increased to 14,205 banks by the end of the year. Of these, 5,462 were national banks; 980 State banks which were members of the Federal Reserve System; 68 mutual savings banks; and 7,695 other banks. It was reported that on October 1, 1934, 44 percent of the total deposit liability of insured banks was protected. This ratio varied considerably for the different classes of banks, being as high as 72 percent for commercial banks not members of the Federal Reserve System, due to the fact that these banks as a group have a preponderance of small accounts. Among State bank members of the Federal Reserve System, 33 percent of deposits was covered by insurance. Computations made as of October 1,1934, indicated that 98 percent of the 51,245,000 depositors in insured banks were fully pro 28 ANNUAL REPOET OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD tected under the provisions of the law. The remaining depositors who were only partially insured, however, had 823,000 accounts with total deposits of about $25,000,000,000, about two-thirds of all deposits of all banks participating in the insurance fund. An important proportion of these large accounts was in New York State and in many cases probably represented deposits of correspondent banks and other corporations. Because of the concentration of so many of the large accounts in New York, the percentage of insured deposits was considerably smaller for that State than for the country as a whole. Among New York State commercial banks 24 percent of the deposits were insured, as compared with 44 percent for the country as a whole, including New York.

In 1934 output of industrial products, including both* manufactures and minerals, was at 79 percent of the 1923-25 average as compared with 76 in the preceding year and with the low point of 64 in 1932. At the same time crop production, which had been relatively well maintained throughout the depression, showed a marked reduction as a consequence of a prolonged drought and of acreage reductions in connection with the program of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Owing to higher prices received by farmers, increased marketings of livestock, and larger rental and benefit payments by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, however, total farm income was larger in 1934 than in 1933. Construction work on public projects showed a considerable increase. Profits of industrial corporations, which had recovered considerably in 1933, made further advances in 1934, and were higher than in any year since 1930. Publicutility profits, however, were smaller in 1934 than in the previous year, and the deficit of railroads increased. Value of department-store sales 29 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD in 1934 was 75 percent of the 1923-25 average as compared with 67 in 1933, and other branches of retail trade also increased, particularly in rural areas. Production, employment, and trade.—The increase in industrial output in 1934 reflected chiefly larger output of manufactures, but there were fairly marked increases in the production of such minerals as zinc, lead, and silver, and a moderate increase in the output of coal. MANUFACTURES-DURABLE AND NONDURABLE AGGREGATE PHYSICAL PRODUCTION IN COMPARABLE UNITS ( Adjusted for seasonal variation) 80 80 70 70 60 60 50 50 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 10 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 \"Durable\" includes pig iron, steel, automobiles, lumber, vessels, locomotives, nonferrous metals, cement, polished plate glass, and coke. \"Nondurable\" includes textiles, leather and products, foods, tobacco products, paper and printing, petroleum refining, and automobile tires and tubes. The chart shows fluctuations since 1928 in output of durable and nondurable manufactures, as indicated by the components of the Board's index. Among the industries producing durable manufactures the most marked increase during 1934 was in the automobile industry, where output was 43 percent larger than that of 1933 and double that of 1932. Activity in the steel industry also showed a further increase, 30 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD while lumber production continued at an unusually low level, reflecting in considerable part continued inactivity in residential building. In the group of industries producing nondurable manufactures, output showed little change in the aggregate but continued at a higher level relative to the 1923-25 average than output of durable products. Activity at meat-packing establishments showed a marked increase, while textile-mill activity was generally at a lower level than in 1933. Output of tobacco products showed a considerable growth, and there were increases also in the leather and tire industries. Fluctuations in industrial output were considerable in 1934, although not so large as in 1933. A growth in activity in the early part of the year was followed by a decline during the summer, and output during the autumn months was at about the same level as a year earlier. The increase in industrial output to 86 percent of the 1923-25 average in May reflected chiefly increased output of automobiles and steel. During the second quarter stocks of steel were accumulated in anticipation of price increases announced for thirdquarter deliveries, and in consequence steel production showed a sharp decline in July. Textile output was also at a low level during the summer months and was further reduced in September by a strike. Subsequently output in the textile industry increased somewhat. Activity in the meat-packing industry, which had increased sharply, accompanying large marketings of cattle on account of drought conditions, declined in the autumn. In December, with a sharp increase in automobile production, expansion in activity at steel mills, and a growth in activity at woolen and silk mills, industrial output increased, contrary to seasonal tendency, and the Board's adjusted index advanced to 86 percent of the 1923-25 average as compared with 75 percent in November and with a low point for the year of 71 in September. By the beginning of 1934 a substantial volume of contracts for Public Works Administration projects had been awarded, and actual expenditures on such projects showed a rapid rise during the spring and summer months. Subsequently there was a decline, reflecting the completion of many projects, particularly on highways. The value of contracts awarded for privately financed projects was at about the same low level in 1934 as in each of the 2 preceding years. The record on contracts awarded in the past 3 years is shown below by 6-month periods. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 31 C O N S T R U C T I O N CONTRACTS A W A R D E D [F. W.

In nonmanufacturing industries employment in December was at about the same level as at the end of 1933. In 1933 employment and pay rolls increased considerably more than production in comparable manufacturing industries, reflecting in large part the spreading of work and the increasing of wage rates under the industrial codes. In 1934 production, employment, and pay rolls all fluctuated closely together. In 1934 distribution of commodities showed an increase and was generally maintained with less marked fluctuations than were reported for industrial output. Value of commodities distributed through department stores was 12 percent larger than in 1933 for the country as a whole, with the most marked increases reported in the Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, and Chicago districts, while the smallest increases were in the Boston and New York districts. Distribution of commodities through chain stores also showed an increase, and there was considerable growth in sales reported by general-merchandise stores in rural areas. Total volume of freight-car loadings increased somewhat, reflecting a growth in the volume of rail shipments of all classes of freight except grain products and merchandise in less-than-carload lots. Commodity prices.—During 1934 wholesale commodity prices continued to advance, reflecting increases in prices of farm products and foods, while other commodities as a group showed little change. The record for the past 7 years, according to the index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is shown on the accompanying chart. The principal increase during 1934 in the price of farm products came during the summer months. At that time drought conditions prevailed over wide areas, reducing the yields of grain crops to exceptionally low levels. Prices of grains and dairy products advanced sharply. The immediate effect of the drought on the livestock situation, however, was to increase the volume of cattle and sheep 32 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD marketed, which tended to reduce prices of livestock and meats. Government purchases of cattle and sheep during this period were a factor in maintaining existing levels of prices. While marketings of cattle and sheep showed a large increase during the summer months, marketings of hogs declined, partly as a result of seasonal factors and partly on account of small supplies available on the farms. At the same time cotton prices advanced as it became evident that the crop would be reduced to about 10,000,000 bales, largely as a consequence of smaller acreage but also in part on account of the drought in Texas, Oklahoma, and western Arkansas. In September and October prices of most leading agricultural products declined somewhat.

In December prices of corn and hogs were about double those of a year earlier, and prices of wheat, cotton, and steers were from 25 to 50 percent higher; potato prices, on the other hand, were lower by about one-half. The small price changes during 1934 for the group of commodities other than farm products and foods reflected declines in the prices of textiles and hides and leather, offset by increases in the prices of bituminous coal, metals and metal products, chemicals, and miscellaneous products, particularly rubber and tires. Building-material prices, after advancing somewhat during the first half of the year, declined by about the same amount in the second half. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 33 Retail prices of food, as measured by the index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, advanced from 105 percent of the 1913 average at the beginning of the year to 117 percent early in September and subsequently declined to 114 percent. The increase for the year was general, with the most marked advance reported for meats. Prices of articles sold mainly at department stores and mail-order houses apparently showed little change. House rents, which had declined for 9 years, advanced in some communities, reflecting increased occupancy accompanying moderate increases in incomes. INDUSTRIAL ADVANCES BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS By an act of Congress approved on June 19,1934, the Federal Reserve banks and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation were authorized, within prescribed limitations, to make credit available for the purpose of supplying working capital to established industrial and commercial businesses. This act amended the Federal Reserve Act by the addition of section 13b, which embodies the provisions relating to the Federal Reserve banks. Regulation S, relating to the provisions of this section, was issued by the Board on June 26, 1934. This legislation was advocated because many small enterprises had suffered severe capital losses during the depression and had inadequate working capital. Such enterprises find it difficult to obtain their requirements of working capital through the capital market, while commercial banks and other financial institutions, in many cases, were hesitant about undertaking on their single responsibility the risks involved in making relatively long-time loans for workingcapital purposes. Recognizing the possible need of these industrial and commercial businesses for additional working capital to enable them to continue or resume normal operations and to maintain employment or provide additional employment, Congress granted the Federal Reserve banks broad powers to enable them to provide such working capital, either through the medium of banks, trust companies, and other financing institutions or, in exceptional circumstances, by advances directly to such commercial and industrial businesses. The conditions imposed by the law are such that loans must be made to established industrial or commercial businesses, must be made for the purpose of supplying working capital, and must have maturities not exceeding 5 years. In addition, direct loans by the Federal Reserve banks may be made in exceptional circumstances, when credit is not obtainable on a reasonable basis from the usual sources, and provided the loan can be made on a reasonable and sound basis. When credit is advanced through the medium of banks or other financing institutions, the procedure is ordinarily for the financing 34 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD institution to make the loan and procure from the Federal Reserve bank a commitment binding the Federal Reserve bank to take over the loan at the option of the financing institution. Such commitments are specifically authorized in the act. Before the Federal Reserve bank can grant such a commitment it must satisfy itself that the loan is properly made and is one that it is authorized by the act to acquire. The Federal Reserve bank, therefore, must make the same credit investigation of a loan by a financing institution for which it is to grant a commitment as of a loan which it is to make direct. This is especially necessary because, under the law, when such a loan is discounted for a financing institution by the Reserve bank the financing institution need retain obligation for no more than 20 percent of any loss thereon. The law provided for the appointment of an industrial advisory committee in each district, consisting of members actively engaged in industrial pursuits. Members of these advisory committees had been selected by the thiid week in July, and the consideration of applications by the committees and by the Reserve banks began immediately. On August 1 the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis made the first industrial advance. The Reserve banks received many inquiries and informal applications for industrial advances immediately following the passage of the act, and for the first few weeks the industrial advisory committees were not able to act on applications as rapidly as thej' were received. By the first part of September, however, this situation was changed, and by December the number of applications received was much smaller and these were being acted upon without material delay. In the period of approximately 6 months which elapsed between the approval of the act and the close of the year about 5,100 applications for a total of $190,000,000 had been received. Of these 1,020 in the amount of $52,000,000 had been approved and 661, amounting to $41,000,000, were under consideration at the end of the year. Most of the other loans applied for were either ineligible under the conditions imposed by the act or were without a satisfactory credit basis. The applications approved included about $14,000,000 approved on conditions which as of the end of this year had not been met by the applicant; and disbursement on these, therefore, had not been made. On January 2, 1935, the Federal Reserve banks held about $14,000,000 of industrial loans and were under commitment for about $10,000,000. The accompanying table shows industrial-loan activity through January 2, 1935. In the period elapsed since adoption of section 13b of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve ANNUAL REPORT OF TPIE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 35 banks have made constant and energetic efforts to make the provisions of the law as generally known as possible to banks and prospective borrowers. Cooperation of member banks has also been obtained. These efforts have been made through visits to bankers and through frequent circularization.
