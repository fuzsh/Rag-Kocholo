        "text": "Portugal’s decline as a superpower is indeed a fascinating and complex historical phenomenon. As the first European country to begin global exploration, Portugal played a pivotal role in the Age of Discovery, establishing a vast empire that spanned continents and significantly influenced global trade and cultural exchanges. However, several factors contributed to its decline and subsequent marginalization in international affairs. We can see this phenomenon as the consequence of, and a case study in, the defeat of a former superpower. Despite being foundational to the West as it is now, with a culture based on science, commerce, and a desire to know the world through ingenuity and experience, Portugal was hyper-marginalized. As a case study, it serves as a fundamental lesson to other superpowers or aspiring superpowers, especially now, when several nations are vying for dominance in this troubled world.\n\nEvidence\n\nEconomic and Political Factors: Although first successful, Portugal’s large empire grew more difficult to manage and maintain. This overextension drained its resources and jeopardised its ability to protect its territory.Other European nations, particularly Spain, England, France, and the Netherlands, began to challenge Portugal’s dominance. The Dutch, in particular, were successful in seizing many of Portugal’s foreign possessions and trade routes.Portugal’s standing was further harmed by the Iberian Union (1580-1640), which placed it under Spanish rule. During this time, several Portuguese lands were lost to other European nations, mostly the Dutch.\n\nCultural and Mythological Factors: In the 17th century, Portugal’s rivals, the Dutch, undertook a propaganda campaign to harm Portugal’s reputation. They portrayed the Portuguese as weak and decadent to justify their own expansionist objectives. This myth-making served to build the perception of Portugal as a declining power. Internal political unrest, economic collapse, and the loss of important territories fueled the narrative of decline. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755, followed by economic and social unrest, aided Portugal’s loss in importance.\n\nHistorical Narratives: The focus of global power shifted to northern Europe, first to the Atlantic powers (Britain and France), and eventually to the United States. Portugal’s contributions were overshadowed by the emerging powers. Modern historiography usually prioritises larger empires over Portugal’s early contributions to globalisation. This has led to Portugal being “forgotten” in many global narratives.\n\nThese are the broad reasons that led to Portugal’s historical standing. Portugal, once a pioneering powerhouse during the Age of Discovery, has undergone a convoluted collapse as a result of economic overextension, rivalry from other European countries, and internal troubles. The Dutch played a significant role in mythologizing Portugal’s decline, lowering its worldwide status. Despite its historical relevance, Portugal’s accomplishments have occasionally been overshadowed by following powerful nations, resulting in its current status as a minor player in global events.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Portugal: Myths, Propaganda, and the Legacy of a Forgotten Superpower\n\nReferences:\n\nVan Veen, E.

The Portuguese invented the caravela (caravel), which helped the Spanish explore America and other areas. The caravel was a highly manoeuvrable and speedy ship that was essential during the Age of Discovery. Here are some important details concerning this great marine innovation: The caravel was created by the Portuguese in the fifteenth century. It was intended for exploration along the West African coast and into the Atlantic Ocean. Its distinguishing characteristics were a lateen sail, which allowed for more manoeuvrability and the ability to sail windward (against the wind).According to various historical research, the caravel was essential for traversing previously unexplored waterways and discovering coasts. Its ability to sail close to the breeze made it excellent for expeditions. The Spanish adapted the caravel for their own expeditions of exploration. Christopher Columbus employed caravels, the Niña and the Pinta, during his first trip to the New World in 1492. These ships were critical to the success of his voyages. Historical records show that the Spanish, seeing the better design and capabilities of the Portuguese caravels, adopted them into their own fleets to explore and colonise new territory. The caravel allowed for longer cruises and the discovery of previously inaccessible places. This ship played an important part in the European Age of Discovery, helping both Portuguese and Spanish voyages. Studies on the history of maritime exploration emphasise the caravel’s significance in establishing new trade routes and contributing to the worldwide interchange of products, civilizations, and ideas.\n\nHence, there is no doubt that the Portuguese invention of the caravel was instrumental in the Spanish discoveries of America and other places. Its advanced design allowed for greater navigational capabilities, which were crucial for long-distance voyages during the Age of Discovery. The adoption of the caravel by the Spanish showcases the shared technological advancements that propelled European exploration and expansion.\n\nReferences:\n\nUnger, R.

Pereira’s work, notably recorded in his manuscript Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis, reflects a meticulous approach to understanding natural phenomena through direct observation and evidence-based reasoning. This method was emblematic of the emerging scientific mindset that prioritized empirical data over anecdotal or speculative knowledge. By systematically correlating lunar phases with tidal patterns, Pereira provided early evidence for a predictable natural system, which not only enhanced navigational accuracy for Portuguese explorers but also laid foundational principles for later scientific inquiry in astronomy and oceanography. His approach exemplifies the transition from medieval scholasticism to Renaissance empiricism, contributing to the broader scientific revolution that would later be characterized by figures like Galileo and Newton.

The caravel’s lateen sails provided more manoeuvrability and speed, making it an ideal vessel for exploration and battle. The galleon, which was bigger and more heavily armed, was built to carry a broadside of cannons, revolutionising naval battles by allowing ships to discharge deadly firepower while remaining stable in stormy seas. The carrack, which served as a strong ocean-going ship, combined the cargo capacity needed for extended trips with the defensive qualities required to safeguard important commodities and people. These advances in shipbuilding directly contributed to Portugal’s naval dominance, allowing them to defend and develop their trade routes against other European countries and indigenous troops. The deployment of these ships in coordinated fleets revolutionized naval tactics, emphasizing the importance of firepower, maneuverability, and strategic positioning. This transformation in naval warfare, supported by the use of side-mounted cannons and reinforced hulls, established new maritime military doctrines that were later adopted by other European navies, cementing the Portuguese legacy in the annals of military history (Quinn, 2013; Moser, 2016; Edwards, 1992).\n\nReferences:\n\nQuinn, J.

This article explores the Portuguese maritime control established through the use of caravels and carracks, and the role of these ships in trade and military conflicts.\n\nPortuguese Innovations in Naval Warfare: The Introduction of Side-Mounted Cannons\n\nThe introduction of side-mounted cannons by the Portuguese marked a revolutionary shift in naval warfare during the Age of Discovery. This innovation enabled ships to deliver powerful broadsides, transforming maritime combat by allowing vessels to engage enemies more effectively without the need for complex maneuvers to bring forward-facing cannons to bear. The adaptation of key ship types like the caravel, galleon, and carrack to accommodate these cannons not only enhanced their firepower but also optimized their design for stability and combat effectiveness. This strategic advancement significantly influenced naval architecture and combat tactics, setting new standards in naval engagements and securing Portugal’s dominance on the seas. The implementation of side-mounted cannons exemplifies the Portuguese contribution to the evolution of naval warfare, with lasting impacts on global military doctrines.\n\nEvidence:\n\nThe Portuguese were among the first to install guns on the sides of their ships, which substantially altered naval warfare methods. This invention enabled more powerful broadsides and increased firepower during fights. The Portuguese were able to throw deadly broadsides in ship-to-ship battle by mounting guns on the sides of their vessels. This strategy became commonplace in naval warfare, affecting naval construction and battle tactics worldwide. The caravel, galleon, and carrack, three important ships in the Portuguese fleet, were modified to house these weapons. These ships’ designs were optimised to improve stability and firepower, making them formidable in combat. The introduction of side-mounted guns revolutionised naval combat, allowing ships to attack foes more efficiently without having to manoeuvre to fire forward-facing cannons.\n\nReferences:\n\nCannibals with Cannons: The Sino-Portuguese Clashes of 1521-1522 and the Early Chinese Adoption of Western Guns.

This innovation allowed for devastating broadsides and marked a significant advancement in naval combat capabilities. Studies show that Portuguese caravels and galleons were equipped with heavy gunpowder ordnance, marking the beginning of a new era in sea warfare (Guilmartin, 2007).\n\nThe Portuguese Nau and Galleon were among the largest and most heavily armed ships of their time, designed specifically for both trade and combat. These ships played crucial roles in the Portuguese Empire’s ability to project power across the seas. The Sino-Portuguese clashes of 1521-1522 provide early examples of the effectiveness of Portuguese naval artillery, highlighting their superior firepower and tactical use of ships as war machines (Andrade, 2015). During the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834), the use of steamers for military transport and engagement further emphasizes Portugal’s innovative approach to integrating new technologies into naval warfare (Bent, 2019). The reconstruction of the Nau “Nossa Senhora dos Mártires” demonstrates the sophisticated naval architecture and the integration of extensive artillery, illustrating the dual-purpose design of these ships for war and trade (Santos, Fonseca, & Castro, 2006).\n\nReferences:\n\nGuilmartin, J.

These discoveries facilitated the establishment of new trade routes, enhancing the flow of goods, people, and ideas across continents. Charles Boxer emphasized that the discovery of America and the passage to India were among the major achievements of human history, as they fundamentally opened up the world and confirmed the spherical nature of the Earth (Scammell, 1982; Bassett, 1971).\n\nThe Portuguese pioneered marine technology, creating superior ships such as the caravel, carrack, and galleon, which were critical for long-distance exploration and naval warfare. These inventions enabled them to control marine lanes and build a worldwide maritime empire (Ghazanfar, 2018; Santos, Fonseca, and Castro, 2006). The addition of guns to their ships’ sides, as well as other technological developments, transformed Portuguese boats into formidable war engines, leading to their naval dominance and empire expansion.\n\nReferences:\n\nScammell, G.

Galileo’s thought experiments, such as his famous ship analogy to establish relativity of motion, were inspired by the experiences and accomplishments of seafaring nations like Portugal. Portuguese astronomers’ involvement in observational endeavours, such as the 1919 solar eclipse in Principe, demonstrates their support for critical scientific discoveries related to relativity (Mota, Crawford, & Simões, 2008).\n\nAlthough direct contributions to key chemistry and physics ideas throughout the Age of Discovery are less well recorded, Portugal made significant improvements in navigation, shipbuilding, and mapping. These technologies were critical for extended expeditions, enabling the exchange of scientific ideas and the collection of empirical evidence across continents (Almeida 2012).\n\nPortuguese scientists and mathematicians were involved in early discussions and adaptations to new scientific theories. During their nautical operations, the Portuguese employed astronomical equipment like the astrolabe, which helped develop techniques that led to improvements in physics and observational astronomy (Gomes, 2006). Historical evaluations indicate that Portuguese Jesuit mathematicians contributed to early modern scientific discussions on hydrostatics and other physical phenomena, emphasising Portugal’s presence in the broader scientific community (Castel-Branco, 2020).\n\nReferences:\n\nMota, E., Crawford, P., & Simões, A.

One of his most notable inventions was the nonius, a precursor to the modern vernier scale, which improved the accuracy of angular measurements in navigational instruments. This innovation was critical for mariners during the Age of Discovery, enabling more precise navigation across vast and previously uncharted oceans. Additionally, Nunes introduced several new concepts in cartography, such as addressing the distortion caused by map projections, which was a significant issue for long-distance sea travel. His work in understanding the loxodromic curve (rhumb line), where a ship maintains a constant compass direction, was revolutionary in the context of navigation, as it allowed for more straightforward and efficient plotting of courses on sea charts.\n\nNunes’ theoretical advancements were not limited to practical navigation but extended to mathematical and scientific theory. His treatises, such as “De Arte Atque Ratione Navigandi” and “Tratado da Sphera,” combined mathematical rigor with practical applications, reflecting a deep understanding of both theoretical and empirical science. His influence reached far beyond Portugal, impacting European scientific thought and maritime practices. Furthermore, Nunes’ work established fundamental ideas that ultimately assisted the advancement of modern science and navigation, highlighting the significance of Portuguese contributions to early modern science.\n\nEquations and Concepts Introduced by Pedro Nunes\n\nLoxodromic Curve (Rhumb Line): A loxodrome or rhumb line is a path on the Earth’s surface that crosses all meridians at the same angle. Pedro Nunes was one of the first to describe this concept mathematically. While loxodromic curves and geodesics serve distinct functions (constant bearing vs. shortest path), the study of loxodromes paved the way for the more generic and mathematically rigorous idea of geodesics. Both notions are crucial to comprehending curved surfaces, navigation, and the mathematical aspects of space.\n\nNonius (Vernier Scale): Pedro Nunes invented the nonius, which enhances the accuracy of measurements by using a secondary scale (nonius) that aligns with a primary scale. This tool was crucial for improving the precision of navigational instruments.\n\nTwilight Observation: In his treatise on twilight observation, Nunes provided methods to calculate the duration of twilight based on the position of the sun and the observer’s latitude. The relevant equations involve spherical trigonometry:\n\nRetrogression of the Sun: Pedro Nunes predicted the retrogression of the Sun’s azimuth under certain conditions. This involves the mathematical relationship between the azimuth (A), altitude (h), and declination (δ) of the Sun, given by the spherical law of cosines: cos⁡(h)=sin⁡(ϕ)sin⁡(δ)+cos⁡(ϕ)cos⁡(δ)cos⁡(A)\\cos(h) = \\sin(\\phi) \\sin(\\delta) + \\cos(\\phi) \\cos(\\delta) \\cos(A)cos(h)=sin(ϕ)sin(δ)+cos(ϕ)cos(δ)cos(A)\n\nEquation of the Spherical Triangle: Nunes’ work on navigation and astronomy also involved solving spherical triangles, which are fundamental in celestial navigation. The spherical law of cosines for a spherical triangle with sides a, b, and c, and opposite angles A, B, and C is: cos⁡(c)=cos⁡(a)cos⁡(b)+sin⁡(a)sin⁡(b)cos⁡(C)\\cos(c) = \\cos(a) \\cos(b) + \\sin(a) \\sin(b) \\cos(C)cos(c)=cos(a)cos(b)+sin(a)sin(b)cos(C)\n\nThe equation for the loxodromic curve on a sphere is: ϕ=ln⁡(tan⁡(π4+θ2))\\phi = \\ln \\left( \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\right)ϕ=ln(tan(4π​+2θ​)) where:\n\nϕ is the latitude,\n\nθ is the longitude.\n\nFor calculating the solar depression angle (α\\alphaα) at twilight: cos⁡(α)=sin⁡(ϕ)sin⁡(δ)+cos⁡(ϕ)cos⁡(δ)cos⁡(H)\\cos(\\alpha) = \\sin(\\phi) \\sin(\\delta) + \\cos(\\phi) \\cos(\\delta) \\cos(H)cos(α)=sin(ϕ)sin(δ)+cos(ϕ)cos(δ)cos(H) where:\n\nϕ is the observer’s latitude,\n\nδ is the sun’s declination,\n\nH is the hour angle of the sun.\n\nReferences:\n\nMichela Malpangotto (2013).Book Review: Pedro Nunes on Peurbach: Pedro Nunes — Obras, in Theoricas planetarum Georgii Purbachii annotationes.

Here are some prominent people and their contributions:\n\nJoão de Castro:\n\nMagnetism: Portuguese sailor and explorer João de Castro investigated the Earth’s magnetic characteristics extensively. His book “Roteiro de Lisboa a Goa” has precise findings on magnetic declination, predating William Gilbert’s better recognised publications. Castro’s empirical findings of magnetic changes advanced our understanding of geomagnetism and its practical uses in navigation (Malaquias et al., 2005).\n\nFrancisco Faleiro:\n\nScientific Methodology in Nautical Science: Faleiro was crucial in creating scientific procedures at the Casa de la Contratación, making substantial contributions to nautical research. His methodical approach to navigation and marine geography focused on empirical data and observation (Collins, 2013).\n\nLuís Serrão Pimentel:\n\nFortification Mathematics: Pimentel contributed to the mathematical theories underlying military fortifications. His work, “Methodo Lusitanico de Desenhar as Fortificaçoens das Praças Regulares & Irregulares,” was influential in the design and construction of fortifications, integrating mathematical principles with practical engineering (Condea & Massa-Esteve, 2018).\n\nJorge de Azevedo:\n\nEarly Studies on Magnetism: Azevedo’s work on the magnetism of rocks predated the contributions of William Gilbert. His studies were among the earliest attempts to understand geomagnetism and its implications for navigation and geography (Malaquias et al., 2005).\n\nAmadeu Pimenta:\n\nSurgical Innovations: Pimenta created novel surgical procedures and instruments, which represented important advances in medical research. His work helped to bridge the gap between theoretical research and actual medical applications (Sousa and Ferraz, 2020).\n\nReferences:\n\nMalaquias, I., Gomes, E., & Martins, D.

In addition to the mulatos, below are some additional prominent mixed ethnic groups that originated from Portuguese connections around the world:\n\nCafuzos (Zambos): This word is used in Brazil to refer to persons of mixed African and Indigenous American origin. The Portuguese colonisation of Brazil resulted in substantial interaction between African slaves and indigenous peoples, giving rise to the Cafuzo community.\n\nMestiços (Mestizos): In various Portuguese-speaking countries, mestiço refers to people of mixed European (mostly Portuguese) and Indigenous American ancestry. This group is very prevalent in countries such as Brazil and Mozambique.\n\nCrioulos (Creoles): Originally, this name applied to persons of African heritage born in Portuguese territories. It eventually evolved to describe persons of mixed African and European heritage in Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau. The term Creole can also refer to the cultural and linguistic mix that developed in these areas.\n\nEurasians (Luso-Asians): These are individuals of mixed Portuguese and Asian descent, found primarily in former Portuguese colonies in Asia, such as Goa, Macau, and parts of Southeast Asia (e.g., Malaysia and Indonesia). They are sometimes referred to as Luso-Asians.\n\nLuso-Africans: This term describes people of mixed Portuguese and African descent in the former Portuguese colonies in Africa, such as Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde. These populations emerged through intermarriage and social integration between Portuguese settlers and local African populations.\n\nTopasses (Tupasses, Topas, Topaz) were a group dominated by the prominent Da Costa and Hornay families, who lived in Oecussi and Flores. The Da Costa family were descended from Portuguese Jewish merchants, whereas Hornay were Dutch.\n\nBlack Portuguese or Swahili-Portuguese, this group emerged in the Portuguese colonies along the East African coast, including Mozambique. They are of mixed African, Indian, and Portuguese descent and played a significant role in the regional trade networks, see here.\n\nThese mixed ethnic groups represent the significant cultural and racial fusion that emerged from Portuguese maritime activities. The formation of these towns exemplifies the intricate social dynamics and long-term consequences of Portuguese exploration and colonialism on other continents.\n\nThe Introduction of the Gold Coin as a Financial Standard\n\nDuring the Age of Discovery, the Portuguese played important roles in global trade and finance. One of their most notable successes was the creation and widespread use of gold coins, which served as a financial standard. This concept was crucial to stabilising and enhancing the international monetary system at the time. The 16th century Portuguese gold currency known as the português, portuguez, or golden Portuguese was the most valuable in Europe at the time of its issuance.\n\nThe Portuguese Gold Cruzado: The Portuguese introduced the gold cruzado in the 15th century, which became a widely accepted currency in international trade. The cruzado’s stability and gold content made it a reliable medium of exchange and a store of value. This coin was used extensively in trade with Africa, Asia, and the Americas, facilitating the flow of goods and wealth across continents.\n\nImpact on Global Trade: The use of gold coins like the cruzado helped standardize trade transactions, reducing the uncertainties associated with fluctuating exchange rates and the diverse coinage systems of different regions. This standardization was crucial for the burgeoning global trade networks established by the Portuguese and other European powers.\n\nPrecursor to the Gold Standard: The Portuguese practice of using gold coins laid the groundwork for later financial systems, including the classical gold standard. By establishing gold as a universal measure of value and medium of exchange, the Portuguese influenced other nations to adopt similar practices, eventually leading to the more formalized gold standard in the 19th century.\n\nEconomic Stability and Trade Expansion: The introduction of gold coins contributed to economic stability by providing a consistent and trusted currency for international trade. This stability, in turn, encouraged the expansion of trade routes and the integration of global markets. Portuguese gold coins were not only a medium of exchange but also a symbol of economic reliability and strength.\n\nThe Portuguese gold currency, notably the cruzado, had a profound impact on early modern economic history. By standardising money and promoting international commerce, the Portuguese helped define the economic environment of their period. Their financial system advances highlighted the value of a stable and trustworthy currency in fostering economic growth and international trade.\n\nReferences:\n\nDuarte, A. P., & Andrade, J.

And the Portuguese downfall is a good illustration of this historical fact.\n\nThe Inquisitions and the associated imprimaturs in Portugal had profound and far-reaching consequences, not only for the country itself but also for the broader geopolitical landscape. The Portuguese Inquisition, established in 1536, aimed to enforce Catholic orthodoxy, targeting Jews, Muslims, and converted Christians suspected of heresy. This period of intense persecution led to the forced conversion, expulsion, or execution of many Jews, including the Sephardic Jews who had been integral to the cultural and economic fabric of Portuguese society.\n\nFaced with persecution, a significant number of Sephardic Jews fled Portugal, seeking refuge in more tolerant regions such as the Netherlands and New York. Their migration had a transformative impact on these host countries. In the Netherlands, particularly in cities like Amsterdam, the Sephardic Jews brought with them extensive knowledge in trade, finance, and industry. They established thriving mercantile networks, contributed to the financial infrastructure, and played a pivotal role in the Dutch Golden Age, helping to position the Netherlands as a leading global economic power. The Portuguese Synagogue in Amsterdam, completed in 1675, is a testament to their enduring cultural and religious influence, being a prominent synagogue of Portuguese rite. The most prominent Dutch scientific prize is the Spinoza Prize, named after Baruch Spinoza, of Portuguese Sephardic origin. Many members of the Sephardic Jewish community in Amsterdam were influential merchants and financiers who participated actively in the commercial and financial activities of the city. They leveraged their international connections and expertise to help establish and develop the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. This exchange became a pivotal institution in global trade and finance, setting the stage for modern financial markets [Ref: Kaplan, Y. (2008). Amsterdam, The forbidden lands, and the dynamics of the Sephardi diaspora].\n\nSimilarly, in New York, the Sephardic Jewish community became influential in the burgeoning commercial and financial sectors. They founded the first synagogue in New York, Shearith Israel, in 1654, which underscores their significant presence and contribution to the city’s development. These early settlers were part of the wave of white immigrants to the United States, and in some regions, the first white people to arrive were Portuguese Sephardic Jews. Their expertise in international trade and connections across the Atlantic facilitated economic growth and the development of robust financial markets, laying the groundwork for New York’s emergence as a major economic hub.\n\nThus, the escape of Sephardic Jews from Portugal, driven by the repressive measures of the Inquisition, inadvertently contributed to the rise of other nations as great powers. Their diaspora spread knowledge, skills, and networks that significantly shaped the economic and cultural landscapes of their new homes, demonstrating the unintended consequences of religious persecution and the resilience and adaptability of the Sephardic Jewish community.\n\nPortugal’s Rise and Historical Downfall\n\nPortugal’s emergence as a powerful nation can be traced back to the medieval period, with significant contributions from the Crusades. The First Crusade, which began in 1096, played a crucial role in shaping the political and military landscape of the Iberian Peninsula, leading to the Reconquista and the eventual establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal in 1139.\n\nPortugal reached the height of its power during the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries. Key figures like Prince Henry the Navigator, Vasco da Gama, and Pedro Álvares Cabral led explorations that established a vast maritime empire. Portuguese navigators opened sea routes to India, Africa, and Brazil, establishing colonies and trade networks that brought immense wealth and influence.\n\nThe death of King Sebastian in 1578, followed by the dynastic crisis and the Spanish succession under Philip II in 1580, marked the beginning of Portugal’s decline. The country lost its independence and was ruled by Spain for 60 years (Iberian Union), which weakened its global influence and economic power.\n\nPortugal regained its independence from Spain in 1640, but the subsequent years were marked by continued struggles. The country faced challenges in maintaining its vast empire, and competition from other European powers, such as the Dutch and the British, eroded its dominance in global trade.\n\nThe independence of Brazil in 1822 was a significant blow to Portugal, as Brazil had been the crown jewel of its overseas empire. This loss further diminished Portugal’s status as a global power. Throughout the 19th century, Portugal struggled to maintain control over its remaining colonies in Africa and Asia, facing resistance and conflicts.\n\nThe early 20th century saw political instability and economic difficulties in Portugal. The country was declared a republic in 1910, ending centuries of monarchy. The final phase of Portugal’s decline as a colonial power came with the decolonization movements in Africa and Asia. The Carnation Revolution in 1974 led to a peaceful transition to democracy and accelerated the process of granting independence to Portuguese colonies like Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau by 1975.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Portugal had been relegated to a secondary role in international affairs, transitioning from a once-dominant maritime and colonial empire to a modern European nation focused on internal development and integration into the European Union. The decline, which began in earnest in the late 16th century, culminated in the 20th century as Portugal shed its colonial possessions and adapted to new geopolitical realities.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe aforementioned sources give a detailed overview of Portugal’s contributions to science, engineering and financing, throughout the Age of Discovery, emphasizing their indirect but considerable influence on scientific progress. Practically none of them appear in scientific historiography, which is primarily focused on the later Western powers and, as some documents show, was purposefully obfuscated in their contributions. My objective was to catalogue some of these contributions in order to further examine Portugal’s impact on world advancement and the globalization process. This endeavor also offers an intriguing case study of a past superpower that, with a small population of roughly three million people, was distributed all over the world, not only striving for commercial benefits, but also blending with different races and producing new ethnic groupings such as mulatos."
