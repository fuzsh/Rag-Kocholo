        "text": "Madness and Greatness: a history of Portugal (1578 – 1640) – “A New Portugal Mk 2”\n\nIntroduction\n\nLouco, sim, louco, porque quis grandeza\n\nQual a Sorte a não dá.\n\nNão coube em mim minha certeza;\n\nPor isso onde o areal está\n\nFicou meu ser que houve, não o que há.\n\nMinha loucura, outros que me a tomem\n\nCom o que nela ia.\n\nSem a loucura que é o homem\n\nMais que a besta sadia,\n\nCadáver adiado que procria?\n\nMad, yes, mad, because I wanted greatness\n\nSuch as Fate does not grant.\n\nI could not live up to my certainties;\n\nThus, where the sandy expanse is,\n\nI left who I was, not who I am.\n\nMy madness, let others take it up\n\nAlong with all that went with it.\n\nWithout madness what is man\n\nBut a healthy beast,\n\nPostponed corpse that begets? *\n\n*(Poem Dom Sebastião, by Fernando Pessoa)\n\nFrom A History of Iberian Nobility, by António Carlos Magalhães (1976)\n\n…The constant inbreeding between the royal families of Castile, Aragon and Portugal not only led to physical illnesses. At least since the mid-15th century, many cases of madness were registered among the members of the houses of Aviz, Trastamara and (later) Habsburg. The first registered case was the one of Isabel of Portugal (1428-1496), who married the King Juan II of Castile (1405-1454)…\n\n…Even more tragical than the illness of Don Carlos de Austria was the madness of Sebastian of Portugal (1554 – 1596), whose mental condition eventually led that kingdom to the great political and social crisis that is known as the “Portuguese Time of Troubles” – from 1578 to 1598 (or 1600 according to historians who include Aveiro’s rebellion in this timetable)…\n\n…Extremely influenced by his Jesuits priests, Sebastian developed very early in his life a deeply religious character. However, as the young king was growing up, this religiosity more and more combined with an obssession for military adventures. In 1569, when Lisbon was afflicted by an epidemic plague, Sebastian decided to travel to the provinces in order to avoid the disease. During his journey, he visited the several churches where the old kings of Portugal were buried and ordered to open their tombs. After seeing the corpses of his ancestors, he generally praised those who had being warriors during their lifes, and scorned the ones who had more peaceful policies…\n\nFrom the play “Sebastian”, by Ricardo dos Reis (1962)\n\nAct 1, Scene 3\n\nMonastery of Santa Maria de Alcobaça\n\nEnter king Sebastian and two monks.\n\nMonk 1\n\n- Here, my king, is where slumbers the body of king Afonso II, the Fat, and that one is the tomb of his son, Afonso III, the Bolognian.\n\nSebastian\n\n- Open them!\n\nMonk 2\n\n- But, Your Majesty, it isn’t wise to disturb the eternal rest of the deads! Remember that God forbids the nefast practice of necromancy!\n\nSebastian\n\n- Fool monk! I shall not invoke them! I will judge them! Now, open the tombs! Let me see the remains of my ancestors!\n\n(Tombs are oppened. The monks make gestures of feeling a putrid smell.)\n\nSebastian\n\n- O fat king, you don’t look so round now. Tell me monk, how lived this former monarch, who once was corpulent, but now is only a corpse?\n\nMonk 1\n\n- He was a peaceful man Majesty. He avoided the war with Castile, designed the first written laws of the kingdom, sent ambassadors to several countries...\n\nSebastian\n\n- Meh, just rubish. Was he a good soldier and a good Christian?\n\nMonk 2\n\n- No, Majesty. He tried to reduce the rights of the clergy in the kingdom, entering in conflict with the Pope and was excomunicated for it.\n\nSebastian\n\n- Stupid stout! Couldn’t you follow the good commandments of the Holy Mother Church? You should fight FOR the Vicar of Christ on Earth, and not AGAINST him! What is worth to gain peace in this world if you lose your soul in the other? Now your fat is feeding the flames of hell! (Spits over the body. Then looks at the other tomb.)\n\nO, but this one, he was buried with a sword! What has he done?\n\nMonk 1\n\n- Afonso III deposed his own eldest brother the king, following the advice of the Pope, who ordered that Sancho II should be overthrowned for not respect the Church's rights.\n\nSebastian (taking the sword from the tomb and holding it)\n\n- And what more did he accomplish? Did he fight the enemies of Christ?\n\nMonk 2\n\n- For sure, Majesty. King Afonso III was who finally defeated the Moors in Portugal. He completed the Portuguese Reconquista, brought the city of Faro back to the Christendom, and was the first Christian king of Algarve.\n\nSebastian\n\n- A Moor-killer then! A real knight of Christ! And does it means that this rusty sword once shed the blood of the infidels? O gracious instrument of God’s will! Even your shape shows that you were forged to follow the heavenly wishes. With your blade we can destroy the pagans, the heretics and all those who do not believe in the Catholic truth. And after they lay on the ground, with you stuck on their bodies, your hilt remembers us of the cross, so that we should pray for the souls of our victims.\n\n(Sebastian kisses and touches the sword with his face, in an odd combination of devotion and obscenity.)\n\n- That is what real greatness means! Only the warriors are remembered by the future generations. Who doesn’t know who were Charlemagne, Charles Martel, El Cid, Richard of England, Saint Louis of France? All them fought the battles of Christ! That’s what I swear, gentle monks! I shall be a holy warrior! I’ll bring the graces of God to my kingdom by making His work on Earth, adding more lands to Christendom and cleasing the territories under my domain from the infidels, the pagans and the heretics. And if I should become a martyr by doing it, then it will be for the greater glory of Portugal and myself…\n\nFrom “Historical Dictionary of Portugal”, by João Guimarães Castro (1953)\n\n...When John of Austria won the battle of Lepanto, in 1571, the king Sebastian felt himself stimulated to follow the glories of his Spanish uncle. He accepted an invitation from the Pope to join the Holy Alliance in a crusade against the Turks. Afterwards, he sent a message to the Venetian Republic to help them, and also wrote to the Persian Shah advicing him to attack the Ottomans from the East while the Christians would do it from the West.\n\nWith the crusader idea abandoned due to the Ottoman recovery and the allies’ internal disagreements, Sebastian decided to fight in India, but this idea was soon given up. Once more he thought about fighting in North Africa, only to be again dissuaded by his court. But his councerlors couldn't stop him. In August 1574 the king sailed to Morocco, but didn’t find in Ceuta nor in Tangier a good occasion to fight. The Moroccans, when heard about his arrival, retreated, supposing that Sebastian had a large army behind him, and did not tried to engage in battle. Bored, the king went back to Portugal, yet still decided to return in a more opportune moment to make a “true war”.\n\nThe moment he was waiting for came in 1576, when Prince Abdul Abdallah Mohammed II Saadi, the Moroccan ruler, was deposed by his uncle, Abd al-Malik, who left his Algerian exile to conquer the country. In order to defeat his uncle, Abdul went to Spain in 1577 and tried to convince Phillip II to help him in this adventure. However, Abdul didn’t know that the Spanish king had already agreed upon a non-aggression pact with Abd al-Malik. Phillip answered that his troops were busy in Flanders, but suggested the deposed sultan to go to Portugal instead and make a deal with his nephew, king Sebastian. Abdul went then to Lisbon, where he required Portuguese help, exchanging it for more territories. And the first proof of his willing was the order to surrender the coastal town of Arsilah, where the garrison was still loyal to him, to the Portuguese, which was done still in 1577.\n\nSebastian was exalted with this possibility at hands. However, his State Council vehemently declared that it would not support the King’s action, but again the he didn’t care to what the councilors were thinking. Also useless were the contrary advices from his grandmother, Queen Catarina, from Cardinal Henrique, from the senate chamber of Lisbon and from the Spanish ambassador. Abd al-Malik himself offered honorable conditions to keep peace, all of them refused...\n\n…The national treasure was almost completely emptied due to the invasion’s preparatives. A fleet was formed, and mercenaries from Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, Italy and Ireland were hired. Including those recruited within the kingdom, Sebastian’s army had over 24,000 men [1]…\n\n…Before leaving Lisbon, Sebastian ordered to bring to him from the Santa Cruz Monastery, in Coimbra, the sword that was owned by Dom Afonso Henriques, the first king of Portugal. The fleet set sail in June 25th 1578, passing by Lagos, Cadiz, Tangier, and reaching Asilah. There, they were joined by Abdul Abdallah’s men, and started the 32 kilometers march in direction to Larache, a port that Sebastian had looked forward to conquer...\n\n...In August 04, after other 32 kilometers march under the Moroccan summer sun, they reached Suaken, a village on the bank of Makhazin River, near to the city of Ksar-el-Kebir. There, they finally met the 87,000 men of Abd al-Malik’s army…\n\n... Despite being ill during all the battle Abd al-Malik was able to command his army very well, surrounding the Portuguese with his troops. In the center of his battle line he put Moors expelled from Spain, who fought with much more anger against the Christians. At the same time, his 10 thousand horsemen were attacking the Portuguese flanks...\n\n...The effort of the struggle was too much for the old prince. Abd al-Malik died while leading a charge against the Portuguese. The news was hidden from the rest of the army, in order to keep the troops’ morale high. At the same time, Adbul Adballan, realizing that the fight was over, tried to flee from the battlefield, only to die drowned while crossing the river...\n\n...When Sebastian finally understood that the fight was lost, he said to his men that would be better to die as a warrior saint than to live as a prisoner, and ordered them to be prepared to a last charge in the midst of the enemy. His knights tried to convince him to give up. Some chronicles from the survivors say that when Dom Cristóvão of Távora declared to the king that they all would die he answered “for sure we shall day, but we must die slowly, so we can take some of them with us”. The Prior of Crato, on foot an covered with blood, pointed to an empty space in the flank of the Moroccan army were the king could escape from the Muslims, but Sebastian didn’t listen to him.[2] As a desperate action, Távora ordered to an allied moor to take the sword from the king’s hand. The moor surprised the king, grabbing him by the arm. Trying to release himself, the king fell from his horse, hitting his head on the ground, where he remained unconscious.\n\nThe king’s knights made a defensive circle, trying to protect Sebastian. But, after some time, they surrendered to the Moroccans. In the end, more than 8,000 men on the Portuguese army were dead, and 12,000 were made prisoners, with the king among them. [3]\n\n1) The real number of combatants in Ksar-el-Kebir it’s still polemic, with sources ranging from 15 to 25 thousand on the Portuguese side, and from 60 to 100 thousand on the Moroccan. The author of this book decided to go with the number shown above.\n\n2) The details from the battle are not clear also, but as the POD is here, I’ve decided to use some “literary liberties”, to make the text more interesting.\n\n3) The POD: Sebastian is made prisoner rather than die in battle.\n\nImage: the Battle of Ksar-el-Kebir (August 4th 1578)\n\nPart 1 – The Kingless Kingdom (1578 – 1581)\n\nChapter 1\n\nPrisoners and Ransoms\n\nFrom “Years of Madness – Portugal and the reign of Sebastian I”, by Mário Pacheco\n\n…The news about the defeat of the invader army and the capture of the Portuguese king were received with joy by Ahmad al-Mansur Saadi, the new sultan[1]. His first order was to take the prisoners to Larache, where they were exhibited in a triumphal parade. Many of them would die there, after being used as slaves to build a fortress and a new wall around the city...\n\n… The only prisoners who would be freed during the first months of captivity were some Spaniards that joined the Portuguese Army.[2] Their release was ordered by al-Mansur, in order to not upset Phillip II, with whom his brother had made a non-aggression pact when took over the Moroccan throne. The others, due to their great number, were divided in groups and sent to several cities and towns of Morocco, where they were put under the care of the local governors. It also served to please the Sultan’s allies, as they were allowed to receive the profits from the ransoms that they could negotiate. But al-Mansur could afford be that generous, as he had a bigger prizer at his hands...\n\n... Kings being held in captivity were rare but not unheard of at that age. The capture of Francis I of France in Pavia (1525) was the most famous example of such event during the XVI century, and chroniclers still remembered the imprisonement of other French king - John II – by the English after his defeat at the battle of Poitiers (1356). In both cases, the monarchs lived for some time at their captors' countries, being allowed to have royal privileges and enjoy a regal lifestyle, but were also forced to accept major concessions and, in order to ensure the payment of their requested ransoms, they needed to accept to be exchanged by their sons. In the case of Sebastian though, such examples could not be followed, both due to the king’s temper and and the internal problems of Portugal and the Aviz family…\n\n... The king and some of his most important nobles were sent to Fez. Initially, the Sultan treated him with the respect that a king should deserve. Sebastian was “imprisoned” in a bedrooms of the Royal Palace, and had the right to keep two servants with him. However, the Portuguese monarch didn’t return the same respect to the Sultan. Every time Sebastian met al-Mansur, he coursed him, saying that God would make “that infidel” pay for this humiliation. The captured king, blinded by his “crusade fever”, still talked to the Sultan not as prisoner to his captor, but as an arrogant adversary.\n\nIn the fifth day after Sebastian’s arrival to Fez, al-Mansur presented to the king the Moroccan demands. According to the Sultan, Sebastian would be released only once Portugal had given to him an amount of money equivalent to twice the yearly income of the Portuguese Treasury. Also, every noble or free man imprisoned would be freed for smaller amounts, stipulated according to their degree of nobility and social position. The only territorial demand would be Asilah, because it was given to the Portuguese by the deposed sultan, therefore illegally. Obviously, the amount of money required by al-Mansur could not be raised quickly. In order to ensure the payment of the king's ransom, a relative of him should be sent to Morocco and take his place at Sebastian’s prison.\n\nAlthough the Sultan’s terms could be considered reasonable, Sebastian’s answer was the worst possible. The king said that he would never surrender a Christian city to the followers of a liar, blasphemous and false prophet, and he would rather follow the example of “Infante Santo”[3] and die in a foreign prison than to diminish in one only inch the lands conquered by Portugal. Also, he affirmed that the Portuguese court would indeed save money, not to give to the sultan, but rather to recruit a bigger army that, with the help of his uncle Phillip, would soon release and revenge him.\n\nThese words were too much for al-Mansur. He ordered that Sebastian should be locked, completely naked, into the worst cell of Fez, and announced that only would negotiate with him again when the king had learned how to have some humility. While his guards were dragging the king out of the room, the sultan still said loudly that Sebastian would suffer so much that in the next discussion he would accept not only giving Asilah, but all the other Portuguese possessions in Morocco (i.e., Ceuta, Tangier, Mazagan, and the fortress of Casablanca). And, just before Sebastian left the room, the sultan threatened to sell the Portuguese nobles as slaves if the king didn’t behave properly in the next meeting…\n\nFrom “El-Rei António”, by Juliano Gomes da Silva\n\n...Although many versions of the history of his release have been told through the centuries, the oddest claiming that he had escaped disguised as a woman or as a merchant riding a camel, the truth is that Dom António owed his freedom to his contacts among the Jewish community. The Prior of Crato had his ransom paid by Abraham Gibre, a Jew from Fez, for whom Antonio had done some favours in Tangier, where he had been governor.\n\nGibre intervened on Antonio’s behalf to the sultan, paying a huge sum in silver for his release. He also informed al-Mansur that the Prior was offering himself to be the mediator between the sultan and the king, in order to get Sebastian to accept some kind of ransom proposal. The sultan accepted Gibre’s offer, not only because of the money but, as well, because he needed a mediator whom the king would listen to and the Portuguese court could accept. Since Dom António had royal blood, he seemed to be the man for the task…\n\n…After being received by al-Mansur, the first thing Dom Antonio did was to visit the king in his cell and explain the situation to him. Sebastian agreed to make him his mediator, but asserted that his first aim should be keep the Portuguese cities in Morocco. Also, he dictated three letters to him. The first one was to be given to Cardinal Henry, informing him about the king’s situation, and announcing the government procedures that should be followed during his absence. Among them was an express order not to send “a single coin” to ransom him or his nobles in Morocco. According to the king, “is preferable to die as a saint and martyr than to live under the scar of the shame, and even more when this stain could be the reason of the kingdom’s ruin”. On the contrary, the king’s order was that, if funds were to be collected in Portugal, it ought to be used to recruit troops, in order to invade Morocco again. The other two letters should be delivered to his uncle, Philip II, and to the Pope, requiring that both called a crusade to save him from the prison and avenge the Christian warriors' deaths.\n\nWith the king’s letters and the Sultan’s demands, António departed to Tangier, from where he would go to Lisbon in September 27th 1578. However, he barely could guess how critical was the kingdom’s situation, and how difficult would be negotiate a deal to let the king free…\n\n1) He was Abd al-Malik’s brother.\n\n2) Among them was Juan de Silva, Spanish ambassador in Lisbon, who was released in September 1578.\n\n3) Fernando of Portugal was the sixth son of John I. In 1437, he joined a failed expedition to Morocco, where he was made prisoner. As a ransom, the Moroccans asked Ceuta, a city that the Portuguese had taken in 1415. The Portuguese court, divided about the issue of giving Ceuta or not, discussed the matter during six years, till Fernando died in prison, solving the problem. Due to his “sacrifice for the national interests” he was known afterwards as the Infante Santo (Saint Prince)."
