        "text": "The Kingdom of Portugal is a nation in Europe. It is bordered by the Kingdoms of Galicia, at north, the Kingdom of Algarve, at south, and the Kingdoms of León and Sevilla, at east. The Kingdoms mentioned are all part of the Crown of Portugal, except for León and Seville, which are part of the Leonese Crown, which is in personal union with Portugal. It also borders France on the New World, with their feitoria on the mouth of Maranhão bordering the French colony nearby. In Africa, it borders the Kingdoms of Kongo, Mutapa, Ife, Benin, Dahomey and Mali, aside of bordering colonies of Japan, the Dimurats and the Arabian Caliphate. In northern Antília, it borders Germany and Russia.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe territory present on the present borders of the Kingdom of Portugal has been continuously settled since prehistoric times: occupied by Celts like the Gallaeci and the Lusitanians, integrated into the Roman Republic and later settled by Germanic peoples such as the Suebi and the Visigoths.\n\nIn the 8th century most of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Moorish invaders professing Islam, which were later expelled by the Knights Templar under the Order of Christ. During the Christian Reconquista, the County of Portucale was formed in 868, with its first count being Vímara Peres, after whom the city of Guimarães is named. The county was for most of its history, a subject of the Kingdoms of Asturias (until 924), Galicia (whenever it and León didn't have the same monarchs), and León. The County essentially ceased to exist by the first time after the Count Nuno (II) Mendes started to claim the title of \"King of Portucale\", and subsequently died at the Battle of Pedroso, fought against Garcia II of Galicia. Garcia then, started to use the title of \"King of Portucale\". However, Garcia didn't last much with the title, as he was deposed by his brothers Sancho II of Castille and Alfonso VI of León. Thus, the Kingdom of Galicia, along with the territory of the county of Portucale, was absorbed by the Kingdom Of León.\n\nThe former Kingdom of Galicia, including the Portugal and Coimbra, was given by Alfonso VI as a county to his son-in-law Raymond of Burgundy. However, concern for Raymond's growing power led Alfonso in 1096 to separate Portugal and Coimbra from Galicia and grant them to Henry of Burgundy, nephew of Alfonso's wife. Henry chose Braga as the base for this newly formed county, the Condado Portucalense, known at the time as Terra Portucalense or Província Portucalense, which would last until Portugal achieved its independence, recognized by the Kingdom of León in 1143. Its territory included much of the current Portuguese territory between the Minho River and the Tejo River. On 24 June 1128, the Battle of São Mamede occurred near Guimarães. Afonso Henriques, Count of Portugal, defeated his mother, Countess Teresa and her lover Fernão Peres de Trava, thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso Henriques officially declared Portugal's independence when he proclaimed himself King of Portugal on 25 July 1139, after the Battle of Ourique. He was recognized as such in 1143 by King Alfonso VII of León and Castile, and in 1179 by Pope Alexander III.\n\nAfonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military monastic orders, pushed southward to drive out the Moors, as the size of Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, this Reconquista ended with the capture of the Algarve on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions. The borders on the Iberian peninsula were defined in 1297, after two wars with Castille.\n\nIn 1348 and 1349, like the rest of Europe, Portugal was devastated by the Black Death.\n\nIn 1373, Portugal made an alliance with England. It was apparently reaffirmed in 1452.\n\nIn 1383, the King of Castile (Juan I) , husband of the daughter (Beatriz) of the Portuguese King (Fernando I) who had died without a surviving male heir, claimed his throne. Other claimants also were Fernando's half-brothers, Dinis, Lord of Villar-Dompardo, and João, Lord of Porto de Mós. An ensuing popular revolt led to the 1383-1385 Crisis. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by João of Avis (another half-brother of Fernando I, later João I), seconded by General Nuno Álvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota.\n\nIn the following decades, Portugal spearheaded the exploration of the world and undertook the Age of Discovery. Infante Dom Henry the Navigator, son of King João I, became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavor.\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta. It was the first prosperous Islamic trade center in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements, that are still being undertaken. The archipelago of Cabo Verde was discovered in 1459 (by France), and a colony was founded there. The island of Achinet, or Tenerife was conquered in 1464.\n\nThroughout the 15th century, Portuguese explorers sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for several common types of tradable commodities at the time, ranging from gold to slaves, as they looked for a route to India and its spices, which are coveted in Europe.\n\nDuring Afonso V's reign, Portugal continued to settle lands on Africa, particularly the Cabo Verde islands, and parts of the littoral, as feitorias. After his death in 1475, his son Afonso succeeded to the throne, and got himself involved on a disastrous war against Castille, which ended with the Portuguese defeat, and loss of Ceuta. On a lighter note, Portugal apparently became an ally of Venice. This Afonso died of the plague, and as he had sent his children to study in England, and England was apparently on an isolationist period, as it didn't answer any messages by Portugal, the throne was empty.\n\nJoão II, Duke Of Coimbra assumed as regent, but as he rarely was present in Lisboa. Duarte, Duke of Guimarães assumed the administrative issues. Duarte eventually would be the responsible for various policies that Portugal followed from Afonso VII's reign to the early part of Urraca's reign, such as the diplomatic isolationism after the war with Castille, and the colonial expansionism that would be more pronounced during Urraca's reign.\n\nWith the end of the war, Afonso came back to Portugal, and was crowned. However, he died shortly after, the only achievements of his reign being the peace with Castille and the establishment of the feitoria of São Jorge da Mina, which quickly became the most lucrative of the Portuguese feitorias, surpassing Serra Leoa and Arguim.\n\nJoão II Of Coimbra, his uncle, then became King. João continued the focus on finding a route to India. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias discovered that the Indian Ocean wasn't landlocked, as it was said, thus discovering a sea route to India. The expedition of Pero de Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva to India and Abyssinia, respectively, also collected more information about those routes. And, in 1491, a Scandinavian navigator called Cjest Reginsson asked for funding of the King of Portugal for an expedition to find the settlement of \"Vinland\". João II accepted reluctantly.\n\nIn 1492, Reginsson's expedition parted from Porto, and in 12 October, land was first sighted. The place was called \"Myrland\" by Reginsson, and the expedition continued to sail north, discovering an almost contiguous expanse of land, which was called \"Antília\" by one of his pilots, Gaspar Corte-Real. Despite this, Reginsson failed in discover Vinland, asking for funds for another expedition. Those funds were granted, and Reginsson managed to discover Vinland, or at least, he claimed to have done it. Other lands were also discovered.\n\nOther expeditions to the area also took place, and some went farther south, and in late 1497, an expedition led by Duarte Pacheco sighted a land mass to the south of Antília. It was called Terra de Santa Cruz, though most of the natives called it Pindorama. A feitoria was built there in 1499, and occupation of the lands began right away. Another colony was founded on Antília in 1511.\n\nJoão II died in 1495, being succeeded by his son, also named João, who was a minor when he ascended to the throne, and died two years later. During this time, Duarte de Guimarães was the regent of the Kingdom. He was succeeded by his older sister Urraca, as he had no surviving brothers. After the coronation, Urraca married Afonso de Viseu, son and heir of Diogo, Duke of Viseu. Afonso died in 1502 on a hunting accident, having only two sons with Urraca. Urraca married again in 1504, this time with the son of the Duke of Bragança, also named Afonso.\n\nUrraca's reign was mainly marked by the increasing centralization of power, and some expansionist tendencies. A maritime way to India was discovered in 1500 on an expedition led by Vasco da Gama. However, Portugal's relations with India became only commercial due to the heavy presence of the Caliphate on the area. Thus, most of the expansion was made on the colonies on northern and southern Antília. Various land masses on Antília were discovered during her reign. Most notably, in the colony of Brasil, which by the end of her reign, had become as big as Portugal itself in area, though most of this area was disconnected.\n\nIn Urraca's reign, royal absolutism was the method of government. The Portuguese Cortes (the assembly of the kingdom) only met six times during her 50-year reign, always in Lisbon, the queen's seat. She reformed the courts of justice and the municipal charters with the crown, modernizing taxes and the concepts of tributes and rights. Urraca also was very religious and invested a large amount of Portuguese income to sponsor missionaries to the new colonies, such as Francisco Álvares, and the construction of religious buildings, such as the Monastery of Jerónimos. Despite this, her laws against Kappelianism were somewhat lenient if compared to other nations, such as Brandenburg. The reign of Urraca also was marked by active diplomacy, contrasting with João II's diplomatic isolationism. With Scandinavia, she made alliances through marriage (her son Pedro with Victoria of Sweden, who would eventually become queen of Scandinavia in 1547.), beside opening diplomatic relations with countries like Cyprus, France and Anhalt. However, diplomatic relations with Castille continued nearly non-existent, as they were since the war with Castille.\n\nUrraca's support for the humanist cause was also significant. In literature, his active support of Gil Vicente, Garcia de Resende, Sá de Miranda, Bernardim Ribeiro, Fernão Mendes Pinto and João de Barros was notable. In the sciences, Urraca supported mathematician Pedro Nunes and physician Garcia de Orta. She definitively transferred the Portuguese university from Lisbon to Coimbra in 1538, and in the same year, a university was created in São Salvador da Bahia. In 1542, Urraca created in Coimbra a College of Arts. Another noteworthy aspect of Urraca's rule was the support she gave to missionaries in the New World.\n\nUrraca I eventually died in 1547, being the longest-reigning Portuguese monarch up to that moment, only excluding Afonso I (only 46 years of his reign were spent as King, with him being, progressively, Count, Duke and Prince [the latter both self-proclaimed titles] for 11 years). She was succeeded by her son Pedro II. However, most of the state affairs began to be handled by his younger brother Garcia, Duke of Coimbra, due to Pedro's presence on Scandinavia for the most part of his reign.\n\nPedro eventually became more present after 1557, and involved the country in its first war after the Galician war's failure, against Naples. As a result, Portugal gained a Neapolitan colony that was Portuguese but was traded with them in return for a fort in the Guaíba lake. However, Pedro died before reorganizing the colony. His son, Dinis succeeded him, and in his 17-month reign, basically finished what Pedro had left open in the colonies, aside of founding a new university in Portugal. Dinis II having died heirless, his brother Afonso ascended to the throne, and in 1564, Afonso X became the first king of both Scandinavia and Portugal. His reign was mostly uneventful, with Portugal briefly involving itself on a Caliph invasion of Venice, obviously fighting against the Caliph.\n\nAfonso then was succeeded by his son João, who, in 1582, invaded Galicia, and died in 1583, after taking Badalhós. The war with Castille was continued under his brother, Garcia I, who by 1586, deposed the Habsburg King of Castille, Fadrique II, and took his titles. Garcia, however, as well as his brother, died with no surviving children, and appointed his sister, Carina, as successor, ending the reign of the House of Avis, although the house still continued in the form of the lineages of the Dukes of Coimbra and Viseu (until 1648).\n\nCarina took the regnal name of Urraca in Portugal, León and Castille, and reigned jointly with her husband, Nuno Anes de Lara, Lord of Lara de los Infantes, (a title that he had acquired after the Second Galician War) which would become Count of Lara (the Portuguese title) as Nuno VIII in 1600. After a 40-year plus reign marked by expansionism, both in Portugal and Scandinavia, and stabilization and modernization, in Castille and León, Urraca II died in 1630, and her possessions were divided among her sons and grandsons, with Duarte, the eldest son, receiving Portugal and Scandinavia, Afonso, the second son, receiving León, and Fernando, son of Nuno, the third son, receiving Castille.\n\nDuarte was succeeded by his son Dinis, who in turn was succeeded by his son Valdemar, who in 1656, died and was succeeded by his uncle Garcia. Meanwhile in 1657, not long after Garcia's ascension, Fernando VI, the King of Castille, started a war with Aragon over a border dispute on Vizcaya. Garcia joined the war in support of Castille, and León joined in suport of Portugal. Aragon was defeated, and the Kingdom of Navarra was granted independence from Aragon and given to Garcia, and subsequently, to Fernando VI. Aragon still kept its monarch, but had to pledge vassalage to Portugal. After the war, Garcia added the title of Emperor of Spain to his titles, given the Portugal had now hegemony over the Iberian Christian kingdoms. Garcia died in 1680, and was succeeded by his son Afonso, whose reign was noted by the submission of the Muslim kingdom of Granada to Portugal, in an episode related to the defeat of the Nasrid kingdom to Morocco on an war. So, by the first time since the fall of the Visigoth Kingdom in 711, the Iberian peninsula was relatively unified. Aside from that, Aragon also involved itself in three wars against the Kingdom of Toulouse, all started by France, and, which, by 1711, had Aragon controlling most of the Languedoc.\n\nWars[]\n\nFirst Galician War (1477-1483): The war started with Portugal attacking, with Portugal trying to take Galicia. The reasons behind this are not known. It is said that some southern Galician villages acclaimed Afonso VI as King, like they did with Fernando I some 100 years before, but this is not confirmed. Anyway, Portugal in the first years of war, took most of Galicia and Asturias, with help of Granada and Naples. However, Castille solicited the HRE's help, which was given. The fact of Granada, a Muslim nation, helping out Portugal also didn't help matters, eventually leading to a Portuguese defeat. On the peace treaty terms, Ceuta was given to Venice and Portugal had to surrender its claims to Galicia.\n\nGreat Mediterranean War (1557-1560): The overextended Neapolitan state was deemed to be a threat by ally Venice. Scandinavia and Venice devised a plan in the 1540's in which they would knock Naples down a few notches. The Coalition that formed was massive, including even the Papal States and some vassals which rebelled from Naples, such as Granada. Portugal joined late, attempting to reconquer their Santa Maria colony, which had been sold to Naples in the 1530's in return for their fort (in which Porto dos Casais was later founded) on the Guaíba Lake. In the end, it was a crushing Coalition victory in which Naples-Savoy was stripped of its colonies, Santa Maria given back to Portugal, most of the Neapolitan land annexed to Venice, and the remainder of Naples joined the new Italian League as a Venetian puppet.\n\nSecond Galician War (1582-1586): In 1582, Another war for Galicia started again, for the same reasons as the first. The advance rate was the same at first , but this time, the HRE, or anybody, didn't join Castille. The King João IV also died in this war, after taking Badalhós (OTL Badajoz). After 1583, with the leadership on the Portuguese side divided in three, the advance went faster, with some battles being easily won against the outdated Castillian forces. The war also spilled to the colonies, and the Cstillians surrendered in 1586, as Duarte de Bragança, one of the greatest generals on this war, was trying to get to Toledo itself. The Habsburg King of Castille, Fadrique II, was deposed, being given the title of Duke of Jaén as compensation, and Garcia took all the titles associated with the Castillian Crown.\n\nLuso-Gujarati War (1611-1616): Indian trade had resumed with the collapse of the Caliphate. Portugal finding itself in a less-than ideal position due to distance, tried to establish bases on India itself. As the Muslim-ruled states on India had lost power after the collapse of the caliphate, Portugal chose to take cities on Gujarat, although Bijapur and Travancore (due to Calicut) were considered at some point. The war, also due to distance, was mostly fought in non-conventional means, if compared to wars in Europe. In a five-year campaign that was mostly comprised of seizing cities on the coast, Portugal managed to conquer almost all of the coast of Gujarat, and establish a colony out of the conquered territories.\n\nCastillian-Luso-Aragonese War (1657-1660): After the Kingdom of Aragon was reestabilished as a independent state, following a revolt from Brandenburg, Castille went to war against Aragon over a territorial dispute over Navarra.The war was easily won, due to the weakness of the Aragonese army compared to the Portuguese. After the war, Aragon became a vassal, as the king, Francesc I, kept his throne, and the Kingdom of Navarra, that had ceased to exist during Brandenburger dominance, was re-established. After that war, controlling all of the Iberian peninsula, the Portuguese King, Garcia III, proclaimed himself Emperor of Spain.\n\nFranco-Toulousain Wars (1676-1709): with the death of Francesc III in 1670, the Aragonese throne went to Alfons d' Anglesola, who became King of Aragon as Alfons VI.Under Alfons VI, Aragon started to guide its external policy along the idea of the \"engrandiment occitànic\", consisting of uniting the Occitanic-speaking (Catalan being counted as a Occitan language) areas under its rule.it had been originally attempted by the kings Alfons II and Pere II in the late 12th century. Meanwhile, France was attempting to regain its influence on Occitania. Eventually in 1676, France declared war on the kingdom of Toulouse, and Aragon joined in, in the attempt of fulfilling the policy. The first war lasted until 1680, and the second lasted from 1696 to 1703, and in both of these wars, Aragon managed to gain most of Toulouse's Mediterranean coast, except for the city of Nîmes, that was given to France. However, Toulouse still existed and France had gained small areas in the north, leading to another war in 1709, in which the rest of Toulouse was finally conquered by France. The cities of Toulouse and Albi, and their surrounding areas went to Aragon, and the former Toulousain King given the title of Duke of Toulouse. Eventually, the \"engrandiment occitànic\" policy was abandoned after Alfons's son, Pere VI, became king, thus sparing Aragon a future war with France, as the rest of Toulouse was also in the Aragonese plans.Portugal supported Aragon in all of the three wars.\n\nSubjects And Colonies[]\n\nAlgarve*[]\n\nName: Reino do Algarve (Portuguese)/Kingdom of Algarve (English)\n\nFlag:\n\nCoat of Arms:\n\nCapital: Faro\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\n\nReligion: Roman Catholicism\n\nRegime: Monarchy\n\nCurrency: Real\n\nEstablished: 1189 (as Kingdom Of Silves)/1242\n\nThe title of \"King Of Algarve\" was used by the first time by Sancho I Of Portugal, after he conquered Silves in 1189. Since Silves was just another city on the Almohad Empire, Sancho used alternately, the titles of \"King of Portugal and Algarve\", or \"King of Portugal and Silves\", and even \"King of Portugal, Silves and Algarve\". He ceased using this title after the Almohad conquered Silves back in 1191.\n\nAfter the Almohad Empire dissolved, The region of Algarve started to be controlled by the Taifa of Niebla, one of the various emirates that had formed after the Almohads' dissolution. Its Emir started to call himself \"Amir al-gharb\". Meanwhile, Castillian and Portuguese conquest of southern lands continued, with Sancho II conquering most of Nieblas west of the Guadianas river, except for some basically independent enclaves, such as Faro, Loulé and others. After Sancho II was excommunicated and deposed in 1248, Afonso III, his brother and successor, conquered the remaining former Nieblan enclaves, being the second Portuguese monarch to style himself as \"King Of Portugal and Algarve\".\n\n- Despite its depiction here, Algarve is not quite a separate Kingdom, as it doesn't have institutions, charters or particular privileges, neither autonomy, being basically an honorific title over a region that isn't any different from the rest of Portugal, as well as the Kingdoms of Toledo, Jaén and others are for the Castillian crown.\n\nGalicia[]\n\nName: Reino da Galícia (Portuguese)/Kingdom of Galicia (English)\n\nFlag:\n\nCoat of Arms:\n\nCapital: Santiago de Compostela\n\nLanguage: Portuguese, Galician\n\nReligion: Roman Catholicism\n\nRegime: Monarchy\n\nMonarch:Garcia III de Avis (in personal union with Portugal)\n\nCurrency: Real\n\nEstablished: 409 (as Suebic Kingdom), 910 (as Kingdom of Galicia, under Ordoño II), 924 (under Sancho I Ordonhes), 982 (under Bermudo II), 1065 (under Garcia II), 1095 (as County of Galicia, given to Rayomond of Burgundy), 1111 (under Alfonso VII), 1152 (under Fernando II), 1296 (under Juan I of León), 1369 (under Fernando I of Portugal), 1477 (under Afonso VI of Portugal), 1586 (under Garcia I of Portugal)\n\nThe Kingdom of Galicia is a political entity located in southwestern Europe, which at its territorial zenith occupied the entire northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. Founded by Suebic king Hermeric in 409, the Galician capital was established in Braga, being the first kingdom which adopted Catholicism officially and minted its own currency (year 449). After the temporal rule of the Visigothic monarchs (585–711), Galicia became a part of the newly founded Christian kingdoms of the Northwest of the peninsula, Asturias and León, while occasionally achieving independence under the authority of its own kings.\n\nCompostela became capital of Galicia in the 11th century, while the independence of Portugal (1128) determined its southern boundary. The accession of Castilian King Ferdinand III to the Leonese kingdom in 1230 brought Galicia under the control of the Crown of Castile, the kingdom of Galicia becoming an administrative division within the larger realm.\n\nGalicia resisted central control, supporting a series of alternative claimants, including John of León, Galicia and Seville (1296), Ferdinand I of Portugal (1369), John of Gaunt (1386), Afonso VI of Portugal (1477), and Garcia I of Portugal, with only the latter being successful. With the end of the second Galician war, in 1586, Galicia was brought into the Portuguese crown.\n\nCabo Verde[]\n\nName: Cabo Verde\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\n\nEstablished:1461\n\nMajor cities: Santiago de Anaga (located in OTL Santa Cruz de Tenerife), Ribeira Grande (OTL Cidade Velha de Ribeira Grande de Santiago), São Tomé (same place as OTL)\n\nAdministrative subdivisions: Canárias, São Tomé, Costa do Ouro, Serra Leoa, Guiné and Cabo Verde.\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the Cabo Verde Islands were uninhabited. The islands of the Cabo Verde archipelago were discovered by Italian, French and Portuguese navigators from 1459 on. The first Portuguese discoveries were made by a Genoese born Antonio de Noli, who was afterwards appointed governor of Cabo Verde by the Portuguese King Afonso V. Other navigators mentioned as contributing with discoveries for Portugal in the Cabo Verde archipelago are Diogo Gomes, Diogo Dias, Diogo Afonso and the Italian Alvise Cadamosto. The French records don't mention names.\n\nThe first five islands, discovered in two separate voyages in 1460, were added to the domains of the Order of Christ, and all the later-discovered islands also were added to their land. However, most of the islands are not occupied, with the only settlements being located on Santo Antão, Santiago and São Vicente, with the latter two only starting to be settled only in 1466. However, the biggest settlement is still Ribeira Grande.\n\nHowever, the colony isn't restricted to those areas. One important area is the Canary Islands area.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Guanches, the Canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals; for example, giant lizards, or giant rats.\n\nThe islands were visited by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, and the Carthaginians. According to the 1st century AD Roman author and philosopher Pliny the Elder, the archipelago was found to be uninhabited when visited by the Carthaginians under Hanno the Navigator, but that they saw ruins of great buildings. This story may suggest that the islands were inhabited by other peoples prior to the Guanches. King Juba, Augustus's Numidian protege, is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world. He dispatched a naval contingent to re-open the dye production facility at Mogador in what is now western Morocco in the early 1st century AD. That same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, using Mogador as their mission base.\n\nWhen the Europeans began to explore the islands, they encountered several indigenous populations living at a primitive level of technology. Although the history of the settlement of the Canary Islands is still unclear, linguistic and genetic analyses seem to indicate that at least some of these inhabitants shared a common origin with the Berbers of northern Africa. The pre-colonial inhabitants are known as Guanche, an adjective used by the people of Tenerife (Achinet in their language) to refer to themselves.\n\nSometime ago, the islands were visited by the Arabs for commercial purposes. The Muslim navigator Ibn Farrukh, from Granada, is said to have landed in \"Gando\" (Tamarán) in February 999, visiting a King named Guanarigato. From the 14th century onward, numerous visits were made by sailors from Majorca, Portugal and Genoa. Lancelotto Malocello settled on Titerogacáete in 1312. The Majorcans established a mission with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400. There may have been a Portuguese expedition that attempted to colonize the islands as early as 1336.\n\nRecently, the islands were claimed by the Duchy of Burgundy and Portugal. They reached an agreement in which the islands on Benauare, Tamarán and Achinet were to be passed to Portugal, and the islands of Gomáara, Eseró, Erbana and Titerogacáete were to be passed to the Burgundians. Unfortunately, the French conquered Benauare first, thus violating Portuguese claims on the area.\n\nThe first expedition to secure the Canaries for Portugal has been undertaken in 1465 in Achinet/Tenerife, then divided into nine petty Kingdoms, ruled by a mencei, which is why those Kingdoms are known as menceiatos. Portugal received support from the southern menciatos of Anaga, Guimar, Abona and Adeje, while opposing the menceiatos of Taoro, Tegueste, Tacoronte, Icode and Daute. While the topography and the resistance of the natives made complete pacification difficult, it was eventually achieved recently. The first settlement on the island was founded in 1466, being called Santiago de Anaga, after the menceiato in which it is located.\n\nThere is also settlement on the islands of São Tomé, Fernão do Pó, and Santo Antão.\n\nThe colony also has under its administration and jurisdiction feitorias (outposts) on the African coast. By now, there are five, one is on the island of Arguim, and is the most northern, and oldest one, is located near the Cacheu river, and is the northernmost one. other is located farther south, and other is located on a harbour near the Serra Leoa hills, on a more southern latitude than Cabo Verde itself, and the other two feitorias. And, there is São Jorge da Mina, the most southern one. Due to the discovery of gold in the area, the feitoria on the local soon became the richest of them. It is also the only feitoria with an urban nucleus recognized as a city. While there is one in Serra Leoa, it isn&apos;t recognized as one yet.\n\nBrasil[]\n\nName: Brasil\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\n\nEstablished:1498\n\nMajor cities: Salvador, Olinda, Rio de Janeiro, Belém, São Vicente\n\nAdministrative subdivisions: Maranhão, Pará, Tremembé, Ceará, Potengi, Pernambuco, Itamaracá, Bahia, Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Vicente, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Itatim, Paranaguá, Rio Grande.\n\nThe colony was founded in 1498, with the first areas of the colony being occupied by feitorias similar to the ones in Africa, and which were to function the same way as there. The land is inhabitated by primitive natives divided into several tribes, many of speaking almost the same language, and who fight among themselves. The main exports of the colony are pau-Brasil, a tree used to make red dye, and which is so abundant that the colony became known as \"Terra do Pau-Brasil\", and sugarcane, cultivated particularly on São Vicente and Pernambuco.\n\nAntília[]\n\nName: Antília\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\n\nEstablished:1511\n\nMajor cities: Lara (OTL Boston), Santo Amaro (OTL Plymouth), São Tomé (OTL Saybrook), Santa Inês (OTL Newport), Setúbal (OTL Windsor)\n\nAdministrative subdivisions: São Tomé, Santa Inês, Santo Amaro.\n\nThe colony was founded in 1511, originally planned to be located farther south, but as the Danes had already occupied the area, it was established farther north. The area around the feitoria is inhabited by natives, apparently called \"Quinipiaques\". There are other peoples living nearby, such as the Matabéçiques, Narragançétes, and the Ampanoaques, along with others. The first settlements of the area to be founded were Santo Amaro and São Tomé, on the Neponçete and Urraca rivers, respectively. Eventually, around Santo Amaro, other settlements started to crop up on the coast.\n\nLoanda[]\n\nName: Loanda\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\n\nEstablished:1547\n\nMajor cities: Loanda, Benguela\n\nAdministrative subdivisions: Loanda, Benguela\n\nRio da Prata[]\n\nName: Rio da Prata\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\n\nEstablished:1561\n\nMajor cities: Santa Maria (OTL Buenos Aires), Sacramento, Rosário, Santa Fé, Córdoba\n\nAdministrative divisions: Santa Maria, Paraná, Cisplatina, Córdoba, São Luis, São Miguel\n\nSofala[]\n\nName: Sofala\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\n\nEstablished:1604\n\nMajor cities: Sofala, Mutapa, Moçambique, Inhambane, Quelimane\n\nAdministrative divisions: Sofala, Inhambane, Moçambique, Maputo\n\nÍndia[]\n\nName: Índia\n\nLanguage: Portuguese\n\nEstablished:1616\n\nMajor cities: Cambaia, Bombaim, Damão, Diu, Amedabade\n\nAdministrative divisions: Bombaim, Cambaia, Buge\n\nMonomutapa[]\n\nName: Mwenemutapa\n\nFlag:\n\nCoat of Arms:\n\nCapital: Zvongombe\n\nLanguage: Shona, Kalanga\n\nReligion: Roman Catholicism\n\nRegime: Monarchy\n\nHead of State: Fruela I Mhande (1830-)\n\nCurrency: Zimbabwe\n\nEstablished: 1430\n\nNobiliarquic divisions and titleholders (as of 1690)[]\n\nDuchies[]\n\nAveiro -
