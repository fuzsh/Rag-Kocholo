        "meta_description": "Cette étude s’intéresse aux diverses formes de formation et de transformation des savoirs à l’époque de la présence jésuite en Asie. Au-delà des affirmations concernant une prétendue supériorité européenne en matière de connaissances géographiques, les concepts d’« Europe », d’« Inde », de « Chine », de « Japon », ainsi que leurs localisations, étaient loin d’être évidents à la fin du XVIe siècle et encore au début du XVIIe siècle pour les élites et les érudits tant européens que chinois et japonais : ces derniers tentèrent d’associer ces termes à des notions géographiques et culturelles intelligibles, dans le contexte des savoirs accumulés localement, en Europe et en Asie, au cours des siècles. Ces concepts furent ensuite disséminés et intégrés, principalement mais pas exclusivement, dans des contextes missionnaires, en particulier jésuites.Cet article interroge les diverses formes d’actes de localisation réciproque culturelle de ce type, au moment où les premiers acteurs européens et japonais étaient en contact ; il tente également de saisir les différentes stratégies et les formes de curiosité et de communication géographiques qui se développèrent au Japon et en Chine entre 1550 et 1650. L’analyse simultanée des formes de construction culturelle de l’espace dans le cadre des missions jésuites en Asie et de la cartographie japonaise nanban sur paravents démontre l’inadéquation des modèles euro-centristes et linéaires de circulation des savoirs, des individus et des idées pour expliquer la complexité des espaces d’échanges et de circulation des savoirs dans l’Asie des XVIe et XVIIe siècles. Ces phénomènes se développèrent selon un vaste système de routes maritimes et terrestres qui reliaient l’Europe à d’autres royaumes et cités d’Asie. Bien plus qu’un modèle pendulaire linéaire fondé sur une circulation Ouest-Est, notre analyse met en relief l’existence d’un système radial de vecteurs extrêmement complexes au sein d’un espace de communications intra-asiatiques, qui transitait systématiquement par Macao. Cette ville portuaire accueillait des communautés marchandes portugaises, malaisiennes, chinoises et japonaises, ainsi que des missionnaires européens, et jouait un rôle d’épicentre rayonnant sur un vaste territoire qui allait de Goa à Nagasaki et Manille. Bien que l’Europe fût représentée dans ce tableau d’ensemble, elle n’y occupait qu’une place réduite.",

        "text": "‘Where is there a picture of Japan?’\n\n6It is worth reporting the initial parts of the first and of the last of the thirty-four colloquia. Leo, introduced in the De missione as ‘the brother of the king of Arima,’ a fictional character, together with his fellow Linus, plays the role of the young Japanese who has never been out of Japan. Right at the beginning of the first colloquium Leo asks Miguel (Chijiwa), the main speaker of the dialogue:\n\nLeo: [...] to help us understand it [Europe], could you please explain what region is meant by the name Europe?\n\nMiguel: This is a very good question [...] Let me put before you briefly the principal parts of the world: the world is divided, according to the most learned of scientists, into five principal parts, namely Europe, Africa, Asia, America, and lastly, that land which learned writers call terra incognita. [...]\n\n9 De missione, op. cit., p. 46−47. For the original version in Latin: De missione (1590), p. 4-5.\n\nMiguel: [...] for the moment, then, it is enough to have spoken of these five parts of the world, though I shall have something to say later on about the form, so to speak, of the world as a whole.\n\n7In the final colloquium, entitled ‘A summary description of the whole world, and a statement as to which is its principal and noblest part,’ Leo reminds Miguel to speak more about the ‘world as a whole’:\n\nLeo: Up till now, Miguel, you have told us, in the colloquia so far, about the different parts of the world. Today, however, we have come together to hear you speak about the world as a whole […] Now that with your arrival here all the difficulties of your journey are at an end, it remains for you to put before our eyes the picture of the whole of the world [orbis terrarum] which we were promised in the first colloquium, and to tell us about the difference between its principal parts.\n\nMiguel: That is why I had the Theatrum orbis [Ortelius’ Theatrum orbis terrarum] brought. You will find it a great pleasure to study the various maps in it. First of all, then, take a look at this picture, which contains a representation of the whole of the world […].\n\n10 Ibid., p. 440. For the original version in Latin: De missione (1590), p. 400-402.\n\nLinus: I am delighted to see this picture of the world, but tell me, where is there a picture of Japan?\n\n8Beyond the official goals that Valignano assigned to the De missione and his indulgence in the implicit assertion of the European predestination and superiority in disclosing the orbis terrarum to the Japanese, the meaning of concepts such as ‘Europe’, ‘India’, ‘China’, ‘Japan’ and their whereabouts was by no means obvious for European, Chinese and Japanese cultural elites and scholars. In the 16th and 17th centuries they were all trying to relate these terms to intelligible geographic concepts, using knowledge that had been accumulated locally over many centuries and mutually disseminated and integrated mainly, but not exclusively, in the contexts of the missions, in particular those of the Jesuits. In the next paragraphs we will discuss the way in which this mutual act of emplacement developed at the time of the first encounter between European and Japanese agents, trying to understand the different strategies, forms of curiosity, and communication that were implicit in Linus’ question: ‘where is there a picture of Japan?’\n\n9This essay focuses on various forms of information and communication promoted within the space of the Portuguese expansion in Asia and will show that linear Eurocentric models of circulation of knowledge, people, and ideas – such as West-East relationships – are ill-adapted to articulate the complexities of the agencies, and also the places of exchange and transformation of material culture, forms, and ideas in the long and multifaceted system of maritime and terrestrial routes that linked Europe to several kingdoms and cities in Asia. Particular attention will be paid to local contexts of interaction in China and Japan, avoiding the pitfalls of the notion of Westernization and challenging the old idea of Europe’s ‘discovery of the world’ as well as traditional definitions of the role of European cultural brokerage as an agent of innovation tout-court.\n\nOuverture: from Zipangu to Iapam\n\nBreaking the Eurocentric Paradigm\n\n18In contrast to these approaches, the synoptic analysis of both European and Japanese literary as well as cartographic sources highlights three main interconnected and interdependent cartographic genres through which the emplacement of Japan in the European imago mundi and, vice versa, the incorporation of the European imago mundi into Japanese cosmography, developed between 1550 and 1650.\n\n19First, Portuguese mapmakers and pilots, in collaboration with Asiatic merchants and pilots as well as the first Jesuits who reached Japan from 1549 on, produced manuscript cartography. Sent to Lisbon or Seville, these maps and literary accounts, in the forms of treatises or letters, were often re-elaborated and circulated in manuscript form in many European courts. Eventually, a few of them were also printed in northern Europe, especially in Antwerp, Cologne and Amsterdam, but also in Venice. Second, there is Jesuit cartography produced in the context of the Japanese mission, often on the basis of Japanese maps and forms of mapping; sent to Europe, it was copied, re-elaborated and printed mainly in Italy, especially in Rome, Florence and Naples. Lastly, there is Japanese manuscript cartography – of Japan as well as of the world – on folding screens (nanban byōbu), which re-elaborated Portuguese and Dutch cartography, as well as printed cartography produced in China by Matteo Ricci S. J. in collaboration with several Chinese literati and engravers. Developed originally in the context of the schola pictorum organized by Giovanni Niccolo S. J., nanban cartography on folding screens continued to be produced after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Japan in 1614, giving rise to renovated, printed cartography of the unified Japan in the form of woodcuts. It is important to highlight that these three genres developed interdependently in the nanban period. In the context of this essay, we focus on the latter two genres, drawing attention to some characteristic features and to their interdependence.\n\nThe Jesuits and the Construction of a Catholic Geography of Japan\n\n20The Portuguese who lived in port cities in the Indian Ocean basin were mostly, if not exclusively, interested in trade. Those who settled on the eastern margins of the China Sea, beyond Melaka, were no exceptions. In addition to a plethora of exotic merchandise (Indian fabrics, porcelain, carpets, African and Indian animals, European-style pieces of furniture, as shown on the screens known as nanban byōbu), the Portuguese nau do trato which made the annual voyage from Macao to Nagasaki, transported Chinese silk bought in the fairs of Canton, in exchange for Japanese silver and copper, in turn re-sold in China. By this means, by the mid-16th century the Portuguese had achieved a dominant position in the China Sea trade, thereby justifying a stable presence in the port city of Macao in 1557, strategically located very close to Canton, in the Pearl River Delta. This commercial activity necessitated only a very limited knowledge of Chinese and Japanese territories –restricted to a few coastal areas and islands around Canton, in China, and the Kyūshū island, in Japan – as well as Chinese and Japanese culture. Contacts were established through the employment of poorly educated Chinese, Japanese and Malayan intermediaries. What spoke most clearly was the universal language of money and the exchange of capital.\n\n23These texts also speak to a progressive understanding of Japan’s territory, of its sixty-six provinces, locating the territories of the daimyō, the territorial lords in pre-modern Japan. In tracing and promoting the history of the missions, justifying the criteria adopted, answering the criticisms of the Franciscans, the Jesuit texts construct a complex cultural geography of Japanese civilization, making extensive use of Japanese intermediaries and sources. The understanding of the geography of Japan represented a foundational knowledge, relevant, but not confined, to the territorial organization of the missions.\n\nThe cartographic nanban byōbu\n\n35The authors of this extraordinary synthesis put side by side two major world cosmographic traditions, therefore, selecting which tradition was more appropriate and developed for each part of the world they were representing, according to their judgment. At the same time, through the large astronomical diagrams they pointed out the spherical nature of the earth and its circumnavigability in the context of the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic universe, composed of four elements: ideas which all contrasted with Confucian and Buddhist cosmographic ideas.\n\n(See Plate 8: http://luna.davidrumsey.com:8380/​luna/​servlet/​detail/​RUMSEY~9~1~23273~50058:Sekaizu-narabini-Nihonzu-byobu-?sort=Pub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&qvq=w4s:/where/​World;sort:Pub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~9~1&mi=0&trs=69, Consulted 25 August 2014).\n\n43Since 1557, when the Portuguese were given permission by Chinese authorities to establish a stable settlement – the Portuguese had managed to run a lucrative trade by exchanging Japanese silver with Chinese silk, porcelain, and other luxury items sought by Japanese elites, acquired at the fairs in Canton – Macao received and combined the agency of Portuguese, Malayan, Chinese, and Japanese merchants, together with that of Jesuit missionaries, radiating its influence over a vast space, from Goa to Nagasaki and Manila.
