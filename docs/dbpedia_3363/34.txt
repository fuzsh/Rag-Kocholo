Hello and welcome to episode 114 of ACPG Podcast.

This week Ben is on the zoom again, this time speaking to Matt and Adam of Brighton based Newcastle band Demob Happy.

Ben caught up with the boys to discuss their music and take a little trip around their world through five songs that shaped their career.

We speak about moving to Brighton from Newcastle, what the live Demob Happy experience is like, hidden musical gems, and much more.

Demob Happy are going out on tour next week, new singles are being released, and the third album is coming soon.

Thank you to Jasleen for setting up the chat and thank you to Matt and Adam for their time.
