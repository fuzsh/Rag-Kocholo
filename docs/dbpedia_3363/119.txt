+TOUR DATES ANNOUNCED WITH ROYAL BLOOD & BAND OF SKULLS

LISTEN TO AUTOPORTRAIT HERE

Demob Happy On Spotify

Demob Happy have released their brand new single, ‘Autoportrait’, and announced extensive tour dates including shows with Royal Blood through Europe and Band Of Skulls across North America.

‘Autoportrait’ sees the Brighton via Newcastle trio kinetically charged. A wide-eyed joyride into fearless sonic territories anew, remoulding their anthemic, dynamic garage rock with startling effect.

Speaking of the track, frontman Matt Marcantonio says: “I had the title before I’d written a word, but it forced my hand into writing something more honest than I ever would, like coercing a confession out of myself over insecurities I’d rather deny”.

‘Autoportrait’ follows an appearance opening the main stage at London’s All Points East, dubbed “confident, assured and massive, a long way from the impromptu shows the trio used to play out of the back of their van”, by DIY Magazine.

Alongside the release of previous single ‘Less Is More’, which has received over 3.5m plays on Spotify, Spring 2019 saw Demob Happy complete their biggest UK headline tour to date, including sold out shows at London’s The Garage and Brighton’s Concorde 2. This year has also seen Demob Happy perform at Mad Cool festival, Shaky Knees, Sonic Temple and US tours with Graveyard and Uncle Acid & The Deadbeats.

‘Autoportrait’ is out now via SO Recordings. See Demob Happy live at the dates below with Royal Blood and Band Of Skulls. Tickets are available here – http://demob-happy.com/.
