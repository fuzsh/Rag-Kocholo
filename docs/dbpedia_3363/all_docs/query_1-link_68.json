        "text": "Demon Slayer Season 5, the final run of the beloved anime known as the Infinity Castle Arc, will be released as a trilogy of films distributed by Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures Entertainment beyond Japan.\n\nCrunchyroll announced the trilogy following the release of Season 4's final episode on June 30. No release dates or even a rough release schedule for the films were given, but they were confirmed to be coming to theaters.\n\nThis isn't the first time Demon Slayer has released film adaptations of its episodes, however, and given how popular the anime is, it's likely Season 5 of the show will also release as normal, with film adaptations coming alongside it or later. No official word has been given on this, however.\n\nA brief first look at the upcoming films was given, with a poster, below, showing protagonist Tanjiro falling through the alternative dimension Infinity Castle controlled by big baddie Muzan Kibutsuji. \"The all out war begins,\" the caption reads.\n\nA brief trailer was also released, again showing the Infinity Castle alongside the key players of the arc. \"With a united will that lasts forever, enter the battle at Infinity Castle,\" it said.\n\nDemon Slayer has released film adaptations of its anime episodes on several occasions previously, meaning the Infinity Castle trilogy isn't necessarily a surprise. It will likely be received well by dedicated fans, however, who want to send off their favorite anime in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe show began in 2019 as an adaptation of the Demon Slayer manga. It tells the story of the kindhearted Tanjiro as he returns home to find his family murdered by demons and his younger sister transformed into one. Tanjiro vows revenge on the demons that were responsible for killing his family and becomes a Demon Slayer to enact it.\n\nIGN listed Demon Slayer as one of the best 15 shonen anime of all time alongside the likes of Naruto and Dragon Ball.\n\n“Demon Slayer has been a phenomenal franchise, and we at Crunchyroll are delighted to have been a part of it from the beginning,” said Rahul Purini, President of Crunchyroll. “Crunchyroll is thrilled to be able to bring this trilogy of films to fans, on the big screen, and it promises to be one of the truly epic and consequential pop cultural events of our time when it hits theaters.”\n\nRyan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day."
