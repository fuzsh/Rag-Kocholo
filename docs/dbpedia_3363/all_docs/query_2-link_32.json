        "text": "Demon Slayer season 4 has now ended, but there's something very exciting just over the horizon: the Demon Slayer Infinity Castle movie trilogy, which will bring Tanjiro's story to a thrilling close.\n\nBut that's a story for another day. For those still in a Hashira Training frame of mind, our guide will fill you in on everything that went down in the past season. That includes a plot recap on all the grueling sessions, info on which manga chapters were being adapted, and the latest English language dub release date times and dates on Crunchyroll, right up to this week's seventh episode.\n\nReady? It’s time to follow your nose and cut through the noise. Here’s everything you need to know about Demon Slayer season 4, AKA the Hashira Training arc. If you're still playing catch up, here’s our guide on how to watch Demon Slayer in order.\n\nFor more from some of the biggest names in anime, be sure to read our guides to Jujutsu Kaisen season 3, One-Punch Man season 3, and the Chainsaw Man movie – as well as the latest on all the new anime coming your way in 2024.\n\nAn English episode 7 dub of Demon Slayer season 4 is set to release on August 11 on Crunchyroll at 1:30 PM Pacific/4:30 PM Eastern. That's 9:30 PM BST in the UK.\n\nNew episodes will follow weekly at the same time for the next few weeks, which means the English language dub finale should air on August 18.\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 premiered on May 12, 2024 and finished on June 30, 2024. New episodes streamed exclusively on Crunchyroll.\n\nFor the latest, check out the confirmed Demon Slayer season 4 release schedule.\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 story recap: what happened in the Hashira Training arc?\n\nThe first episode sees the Wind and Serpent Hashiras on a rescue mission, which suddenly transforms into a curious piece of intel as they stumble upon the entrance to the Infinity Castle. Unfortunately for them, it slams shut before they can get in.\n\nElsewhere, Tanjiro is recovering from his exploits in the Swordsmith Village, while Zenitsu and Inosuke both return to his side at Hashira's HQ.\n\nA dying Kagaya is replaced in a Hashira meeting by his wife, Amane. While there, she makes note of the odd markings that have started appearing on the demon slayers. Also, she believes Muzan will try and claim Nezuko (who has 'conquered the sun') for his own studies. To prepare, she instructs each Hashira to begin training the new generation of Demon Slayer corps, with the teachers creating their own bespoke sessions to fit their personalities and skillsets. The Water Hashira refuses to participate, however.\n\nThe extra-long Demon Slayer season 4 premiere episode ends with demon-doctor Tamayo being enlisted by the demon slayer corps for a new plan to take down Muzan Kibutsuji.\n\nThe second episode revolves around the Water Hashira Giyu Tomioka and his backstory with Final Selection training, including the survivor's guilt over only being wounded while his fellow trainee Sabito (who you may remember helped train Tanjiro way back in the first season) died.\n\nGiyu, having excluded himself from the other Hashiras, eventually comes out of his shell thanks to Tanjiro's help.\n\nElsewhere, Kanao asks to be trained by the Insect Hashira Shinobu, who declines but does offer up an alternative: she will teach her how to kill the one who murdered her sister.\n\nThe third episode focuses solely on Tanjiro's training with Tengen, the former Sound Hashira. Tanjiro's success during the trials held by Tengen motivates the rest of the Demon Slayer corps to continue working hard so they can support Tanjiro and the Hashira in their fight against Muzan.\n\nThe fourth episode sees Tanjiro heading over to Muichiro's dojo, where he witnesses the Mist Hashira admonishing his students for not being quick enough. At one point, frustrated with the lack of urgency by the Corps, he even introduces real swords into training.\n\nTo help alleviate some of the tension, Tanjiro suggests a paper airplane-throwing contest - one which Muichiro wins easily. However, the resulting hubbub surrounding the event brings the Corps closer together, as well as letting Muichiro understand he should go easier on the students.\n\nElsewhere, it's revealed that Muichiro has been training secretly at night with the Serpent Hashira Iguro and Wind Hashira Shinazugawa, but he is seemingly being tracked by one of Muzan's Upper Rank demons...\n\nThe fifth episode follows Tanjiro's brief stopover at the Love Hashira's training session, featuring an excruciatingly flexible exercise circuit.\n\nNext, Tanjiro heads over to the Serpent Hashira to complete his sleeve-based training, before taking on the Wind Hashira after defending the honor of Sanemi's younger brother Genya.\n\nFinally, Tanjiro joins Zenitsu on what could be the toughest training yet as he encounters the Stone Hashira...\n\n...and it turns out to be the case. The sixth episode follows Tanjiro's three-part training under the Stone Hashira, which he eventually succeeds in completing. They include an hours-long waterfall meditation, log lifting, and moving a boulder.\n\nElsewhere, Muzan continues his search for Nezuko but it proves fruitless. Still, the demon's spy network appears to be tracking much of the Corps, which could spell trouble for Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke and the Hashira further down the line.\n\nThe seventh episode, meanwhile, sees Tanjiro and Inosuke finish their training. Zenitsu, though, is sent a letter which completely changes his attitude. The contents of the note, as of right now, remain a mystery.\n\nTanjiro also speaks to the Stone Hashira, who recounts the tragic tale of how he failed to protect a group of orphans from a demon attack, with the sole survivor blaming him and telling authorities that he was the murderer.\n\nThe real kicker, though, sees demon head honcho Muzan Kitbutsuji discover the Hashira headquarters. In a cliffhanger, Muzan confronts a bedstricken Ubuyashiki...\n\nInevitably, Ubuyashiki perishes. But the circumstances are wildly different to anything we (and Muzan) could have anticipated. Ubuyashiki blows up his home, with his family by his side, and wounds Muzan.\n\nWhile Muzan escapes, he is surrounded by Hashira. As a last resort, he traps the elite Demon Slayers in the demon's home of the Infinity Castle. As Tanjiro falls inwards towards the mind-bending structure, he swears he will be the one to destroy Muzan.\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 story: what manga chapters did it adapt?\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 will follow on from the end of the Swordsmith Village arc (chapters 98-127 of the manga) by adapting the Hashira Training arc (chapters 128-136). If you’re following on in the bundled editions, that’s the latter half of Volume 15 and the first three chapters in Volume 16.\n\nNo spoilers here, but the source material does give us a taste of what to expect.\n\nThe book synopsis reads: \"Tanjiro goes to see the Stone Hashira, Himejima, who intends to prepare him for the battles to come. The training to become a Hashira – a high-ranking member of the Demon Slayer Corps – is intense and demanding, and earning Himejima’s approval seems impossible, but Tanjiro won’t give up!\"\n\nIn straightforward terms, expect Tanjiro to harness more of his powers with the help of various Hashira. The Stone Hashira, Water Hashira, Insect Hashira, Wind Hashira, and Snake Hashira have already been confirmed for the Hashira Training arc, with the 'To the Hashira Training' outlining the group's plans to train the Demon Slayer Corps with a series of well-honed regimens that cater to each Hashira's style.\n\nThe new season is also revolving around the emergence of Nezuko’s new powers, namely that she can ‘conquer the sun’ and exist as a demon in the daylight. Series antagonist Muzan Kibutsuji, as shown in the Swordsmith Village finale, is aware of those developments and will be hot on her tail.\n\nLooking further ahead, it also appears to be the last step before the very final anime storyline, dubbed the Final Battle/Infinity Castle arc.\n\nTo the Hashira Training: is Demon Slayer season 4 a movie?\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 is not a movie. Instead, the 'To the Hashira Training' release follows the same path as the lead-up to the release of the Swordsmith Village arc.\n\nTitled To the Hashira Training, the new Demon Slayer 'movie' (we hesitate to call it a full feature-length adventure) specifically combines Swordsmith Village arc episode 11 with Demon Slayer season 4, episode 1.\n\nThat got a limited release in February. Demon Slayer season 4, including an hour-long first episode, released in May.\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 cast\n\nTanjiro (Natsuki Hanae), Zenitsu (Hiro Shimono), Inosuke (Yoshitsugu Matsuoka), and Nezuko (Akari Kitou) are all part of the Demon Slayer season 4 cast in the Hashira Training arc.\n\nThe Water Hashira Giyu Tomioka (Takahiro Sakurai), Serpent Hashira Obanai Iguro (Kenichi Suzumura), Insect Hashira Shinobu Kocho (Saori Hayami), Wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa (Tomokazu Seki), Mist Hashira (Kengo Kawanshi), Love Hashira (Kana Hanazawa) and Stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima (Tomokazu Sugita) will each be a major presence as Tanjiro begins his training. The former Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui (Katsuyuki Konishi) is also included in the cast.\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 trailer: Hashira Training teaser\n\nThe most recent trailer for the Hashira Training season was released in March. While it only features footage from the first episode of the upcoming season, it does tease the upcoming arc. The Hashira will guide Tanjiro through to potentially being a Hashira-in-waiting, and they will train the next generation of Demon Slayer Corps against the surviving Twelve Kizuki/Upper Moons.\n\nThe first Demon Slayer season 4 trailer featured a quick recap of the arcs covered so far, plus the confirmed clutch of characters in the new arc. You can also see the new poster below, which highlights the Hashira involved in the titular training.\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 episode count: how many episodes are in the Hashira Training arc?\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 has only eight episodes, making it the shortest season to date.\n\nThe first season of Demon Slayer consisted of 26 episodes – but episode counts have been dwindling since then. The Mugen Train and Entertainment District arcs were seven and 11 episodes respectively, while Swordsmith Village was also 11 episodes.\n\nWhere to watch Demon Slayer\n\nThe first three seasons of Demon Slayer are available to watch on Crunchyroll. The first three seasons are now also available on Netflix and Hulu in some regions."
