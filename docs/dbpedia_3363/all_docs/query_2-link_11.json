And in this case, sometimes dire consequences can emerge from protecting the people you love.\n\n“Fragile trust” is the theme of this episode. As the overlords discuss what to do about the extermination in six months, Charlie wants Sir Pentious to reform from his violent ways. The dead angel also comes back to haunt some overlords who may have some answers.\n\nScrambled Eggs\n\nSir Pentious has been at the Hazbin Hotel for a week. Charlie thinks he’s making real progress, only for Pentious to come in with a new weapon to fire at the other residents. Vaggie quickly confiscates it. She also goes to Alastor to ask him to get rid of Pentious’s egg demons, “humanely”. Sir Pentious is not happy about this.\n\nCharlie decides to have Vaggie lead trust exercises. She says that she trusts everyone, so she’s not the best person to do this session. But someone like Vaggie who works hard with other people may have the insight. Vaggie agrees to give it a try."
