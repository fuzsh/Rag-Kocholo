        "text": "I hope today is one of many moments of awe in my career. I politely—if sheepishly—introduced myself to Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro (center) as Dr. Haley with the Naval History and Heritage Command. *He* hugs *me* and immediately turns to his friend and exclaims, “Oh! She knows everything about Port Chicago” and introduces me to the son of the chief counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund at the time of the mutiny trial and provided legal aid and public advocacy, Thurgood Marshall, Jr. (right). 🥹 I’m still shaking.\n\nWhat a perfect day for my episode with 2 Complicated 4 History Podcast to drop, as I was at Quantico today to talk about the complicated queer history in federal employment. This is one of my favorite conversations about my manuscript, which was perfect for #2Complicated4History. Thank you so much for having me! #Pride 🌈🏳️⚧️ #Pride2024\n\nI always love the Society of Military History and we had standing room only this morning at 1030 (over 70 people!). It was surreal. Thank you to all who attended and support my work. 💪🏼✈️\n\nHappy #WomensHistoryMonth 👇🏼Enjoy my latest article that contextualizes CNO Elmo R. Zumwalt’s effort(s) to open more billets and ratings to women sailors at the same moment that Women’s Liberationists led by Gloria Steinem and conservative housewives organized through Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Forum verbally sparred over ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nI love my job. 🗣️🎙️ I sat down for an oral history with CDR Lori E. Chestang, USN (Ret.) to discuss her twenty-year service with the Navy, specifically as a Black woman in the Nuclear Propulsion Program. Our interview lasted over three hours and we *will* need to sit down for another session. Thank you, Lori. I have no doubt your words will be of importance to researchers, civilian and military (once I get it transcribed!🫣). ⚓️🎤"
