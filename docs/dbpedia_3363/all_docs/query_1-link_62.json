        "text": "Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Hashira Training Arc, \"The Hashira Unite,\" satisfied our expectations in some very big ways.\n\nThe season finale of Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Hashira Training Arc, \"The Hashira Unite,\" was fantastic. It is a wonderful blend of heartbreak and action, with some exposition in between. But, I mean, we know there would be a long conversation once Muzan got to Ubuyashiki's mansion. That said, it was great to see all the Hashira ready to fight together.\n\nThe finale takes place right where things left off: Ubuyashiki getting Muzan. The intro is about the minutes of Muzan walking. Very dramatic and on brand, Muzan seems to always have a flat for being extra. Ubuyashiki, on the other hand, is dying but ready to put Muzan in his place. Ubuyashiki remains the peaceful and calm master we have known him as. There were a few key points from this back-and-forth, or rather, mostly forth, considering Ubuyashiki does most of the talking.\n\nIt is more established that Ubuyashiki comes from the same family that spawned Muzan. It seems that due to this, the lineage was cursed to birth very frail children who cannot live past their 30s. This is also the reason why they have dedicated their lives all these years to hunting down Muzan. This really explains a lot now and why good existence seems to spawn Slayers until the scores are settled – that, and Muzan is looking for more power, aiming for eternity. This is also the reason why he is searching for Nezuko. After letting Ubuyashiki know his time has come to an end, Ubuyashiki advises Muzan that his children, the slayers, will come for him.\n\nLo and behold, the time has come, but Ubuyashiki has another card on his sleeve, and his mansion goes up in flames with multiple traps set for Muzan. This included traps set by Tamayo, who is also ready to sacrifice herself for a bigger cause: eliminating Muzan. Things have taken a turn as it seems that Muzan has been stalled successfully as the Hashira arrive. Gyomei is the first on the scene, and even though he decapitates Muzan, the Demon comes back to life. All Hashira have now arrived along with Tanjiro and are ready to strike. While I am not big on the 3D aspects, the animation was stunning, and it is great to see everyone in real action this time. Things are surely not going to go well for everyone involved.\n\nBut surprise, Muzan plays just as dirty and all slayers now fall into his domain palace thing. It was a longer episode yet it felt like the sitter l shortest. I wish we would have gotten more action before cutting off, but I cannot wait to see where things are heading now that everyone is trapped together in the same place. If the upcoming trilogy looks as good as this promised, I am sure we will be in for a treat. I can see why this Arc was a film; I can imagine it must run much smoother as such than chopped into episodes. All in all, it was a fun Arc, but I wish all episodes had the same intensity as the season finale of Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Hashira Training Arc."
