His determination to improve is admirable and it is satisfying to see him progress through his hard work and perseverance.\n\nThe animation in this episode is again stunning, with vibrant colors and fluid movements that bring the characters and action to life. The scene where Tanjiro discovers a new breathing technique is particularly well done, with a beautiful visual representation of the concept.\n\nAll in all, Demon Slayer Season 1 Episode 3 is another strong entry in the series that keeps us engaged and invested in Tanjiro’s journey. He leaves us eager to see what challenges and triumphs await him in the upcoming episodes."
