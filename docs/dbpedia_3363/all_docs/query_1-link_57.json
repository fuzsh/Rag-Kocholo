Later in Demon Slayer season 4 episode 4, the protagonist visits Giyu, who fights against Sanemi Shinazugawa as part of their training. The interaction between Tanjiro, Sanemi, and Giyu is followed by Muzan Kibutsuji’s dramatic entrance into the Ubuyashiki Mansion.\n\nThe Demon Slayer season 4 episode 8 release date is Sunday, June 30, 2024, at 8:45 a.m. PDT."
