From the gut-wrenching Final Selection Arc to the breath-stealing Mugen Train Arc, we've been on the edge of our seats. Now, buckle up as we journey through all you’ve seen, and also into the manga's uncharted realms, where spoilers are as sharp as Nichirin Swords.\n\nGet ready for battles that defy imagination, secrets darker than the night, and character twists that'll leave you reeling. Demon Slayer isn't just a show; it's a thrill ride into a world where humanity clashes with the demonic unknown.\n\nUnwavering Resolve Arc\n\nFinal Selection Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 1-9\n\nEpisodes S1 E1-E5\n\nUp in the snowy mountains, Tanjiro Kamado's peaceful life shatters when his family is brutally killed by a demon, except for his sister, Nezuko, who's slowly turning into one herself. A demon slayer, Giyu Tomioka, appears and tries to kill her, but spares her due to her resistance and attempts to protect Tanjiro. He then instructed Tanjiro to go seek Sakonji Urokodaki on Mount Sagiri.\n\nEn route, they encounter a demon and are unable to kill it, only to be saved when the sun rose, burning the demon. Urokodaki, who saw the whole occurrence, scolds Tanjiro for his wavering resolve and warns against Nezuko harming humans. Tanjiro passed a series of dangerous tests at Mount Sagiri and became Urokodaki’s student.\n\nTanjiro trains relentlessly for the Demon Slayer Corps, focusing on mastering the Water Breathing technique. After mastering these, he's tasked with splitting a massive boulder, eventually succeeding after guidance from Urokodaki's former students, Sabito and Makomo. He heads to the Final Selection exam with other budding demon slayers, tasked with surviving for seven days in a demon-infested forest.\n\nHe faces the formidable Hand Demon, kills it, and offers a compassionate prayer upon its defeat. Tanjiro survives the full Final Selection alongside four others. Upon reuniting with Urokodaki and Nezuko, he's given a unique black sword by swordsmith Haganezuka and receives his first mission – to investigate a town plagued by young girls' disappearances.\n\nKidnapper’s Bog Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 10-13\n\nEpisodes S1 E6-E7\n\nTanjiro ventures to a remote village in the northwest to investigate the ongoing disappearance of young girls. There, he encounters Kazumi, whose fiancée has fallen victim to the menace, plunging him into despair. Tanjiro waits until nightfall when the demon is most active. He steps in to rescue the next potential victim, revealing the Swamp Demon with the ability to create illusions and puddles from thin air. Amid his intense battle with the demon and its duplicates, Nezuko suddenly intervenes to aid Tanjiro in battle and protect Kazumi and the girl.\n\nWhile Nezuko safeguards them, Tanjiro confronts the Swamp Demon and its duplicates. The two clones find refuge in a swamp, but Tanjiro employs his Whirlpool technique to defeat them. He then corners the remaining clone as Nezuko joins the fight. He ultimately beheads the demon, offers solace to Kazumi over his fiancée's tragic fate, and then departs for his next mission in Asakusa, Tokyo.\n\nIn a fateful twist, Tanjiro detects a familiar scent, reminiscent of the day his family met their grim end. He traces it to a seemingly ordinary family, only to discover that the man is Muzan Kibutsuji, the Demon King. To escape a confrontation with Tanjiro, Muzan quickly turns a random civilian into a demon and disappears.\n\nAsakusa Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 14-19\n\nEpisodes S1 E8-E10\n\nMuzan escapes as Tanjiro battles the demon, vowing to track him down. He recognizes the Hanafuda earrings on Tanjiro, evoking memories of a past formidable adversary who possessed them. He then summons and assigns Susamaru and Yahaba to eliminate Tanjiro. While trying to subdue the transitioning demon, Tanjiro is aided by Tamayo, a demon who seeks Muzan's defeat, and another demon named Yushiro. They then go to Tamayo's refuge to discuss a potential cure for demon transformation, and what they need to develop it.\n\nAmid their conversation, Susamaru and Yahaba uncover the location of Tamayo’s house and tear it to shreds. Yushiro is decapitated by Susamaru as she displays her skills with her temari balls, but he regenerates his head back. Tanjiro faces challenges in battling the demons due to their elusive movements, but Yushiro helps unravel Yahaba's arrow manipulation and Susamaru’s temari’s movements. After a while, Nezuko and Tanjiro switch opponents, while Yushiro joins the battle against Susamaru, using his Blood Demon Art. Tanjiro employs clever tactics to close in on Yahaba and defeat him.\n\nJust before he dies completely, Yahaba tries to kill Tanjiro with a barrage of arrow attacks, but he manages to survive them. Then Nezuko, healed by Tamayo, rejoins the fight against Susamaru and matches her strength. To quickly put an end to the threat that Susamaru posed, Tamayo tricks her into speaking Muzan’s name, activating the demon curse that kills her. A proper examination of her eyeball reveals she's not part of the Twelve Kizuki as she’d claimed earlier. In gratitude, Tamayo sheds tears of joy and appreciation, and the siblings depart for their next mission. On their way, Tanjiro encounters another demon slayer from Final Selection pressuring a woman to marry him.\n\nTsuzumi Mansion Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 20-27\n\nEpisodes S1 E11-E14\n\nTanjiro intervenes to stop Zenitsu from troubling the woman and learns of Zenitsu's struggles during Final Selection due to his feelings of weakness. Guided by a crow, they reach a woodland mansion where they encounter the siblings Shoichi and Teruko. Inexplicably, they all enter different rooms with supernatural properties, such that the orientation of the rooms changes to the tune of a drum. Tanjiro and Teruko confront a formidable demon that they meet in one of the rooms. Meanwhile, Zenitsu and Shoichi encounter a boar-masked demon slayer while searching for an exit.\n\nIn the mansion, Tanjiro witnesses the drum demon's Blood Demon Art involving drum manipulation. A demon slayer enters the home, leading to a confrontation that’s constantly thwarted by the demon's abilities. Zenitsu, overcome with fear, passes out. In his sleep, uses Thunder Breathing to vanquish the tongue demon. The moment he wakes to reality, he reverts to his fearful self and erroneously credits Shoichi for this act of bravery.\n\nAs Tanjiro engages the drum demon, Kyogai, he also protects the kidnapped sibling Kiyoshi. Throughout the battle, he adapts to the unique drum-induced movements. Tanjiro's determination, inspired by Urokodaki's teachings, drives him to combat Kyogai despite his injuries. Kyogai then attacks erratically, fueled by anger stemming from past ridicule of his musical talents. In the end, Tanjiro defeats Kyogai, acknowledges his skills, and condemns his incessant murder of innocent humans.\n\nTanjiro collects Kyogai's blood and gives it to Chachamaru, Yushiro's cat, which then vanishes. Zenitsu, previously kicked out for defending Nezuko's box, is attacked by the demon slayer wearing a boar’s mask, named Inosuke. After a brief brawl, Tanjiro knocks Inosuke out and then explains Nezuko’s circumstances to him.\n\nLater, the group buries the mansion's deceased and is guided down the mountain by a crow. They bid farewell to the siblings and find refuge in an elderly woman's home. Inosuke, who participated in Final Selection to test his skills on demons, becomes more complacent and joins them. Zenitsu questions Tanjiro about carrying a demon, and Nezuko steps out from her box.\n\nMount Natagumo Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 28-44\n\nEpisodes S1 E15-E21\n\nTanjiro and his companions embark on their next mission on Mt. Natagumo, where they encounter a mysterious demon slayer, Murata, who is ensnared by web control. Tanjiro and his friends then engage the controlled demon slayers. Tanjiro and Inosuke discover a way to disrupt the webs, but the Spider Demon Mother reacts in anger, killing the demon slayers she’d been controlling.\n\nMoving further into the forest, Tanjiro and Inosuke encounter a headless demon under the Spider Demon Mother’s control, combine their skills, and succeed in eliminating him. Tanjiro is thrown into the air to confront the Spider Demon Mother, who decides to give up rather than endure further abuse. Before she dies, she warns Tanjiro that a member of the Twelve Kizuki is on the mountain.\n\nZenitsu discovers a strange spider-human hybrid in the forest and witnesses captured demon slayers transforming into spiders in a clearing. The Son of the Spider Family then taunts Zenitsu, informing him of his imminent transformation due to the poison injected into his veins.\n\nTanjiro and Inosuke confront Daughter and engage in combat. Suddenly, the Spider Demon Father emerges from the forest and engages both of them. Tanjiro and Inosuke struggle to cut through Father's tough skin. Shortly, Tanjiro is flung to another part of the mountain, leaving Inosuke alone. Father almost kills Inosuke, but Giyu rescues him and defeats Father instantly. However, Tanjiro faces Rui, a member of the twelve Kizuki, and is ensnared by his powerful threads.\n\nInosuke is impressed by Giyu’s swordsmanship and wants to challenge him, but Giyu declines and ties him to a tree. As Zenitsu lays down to await his death, Shinobu Kocho comes by and administers an antidote to him, while the Kakushi tend to the other wounded demon slayers. While fighting against Rui, Tanjiro narrowly avoids fatal attacks from the demon. Rui tortures his sister due to her inability to carry out instructions, before proceeding to threaten Tanjiro to give up Nezuko for his life. Meanwhile, Inosuke escapes from the forest. Shinobu encounters the Spider Demon Daughter and, after a brief conversation, engages her and succeeds in killing her by injecting doses of poison in her.\n\nGiyu helps Tanjiro to defeat Rui. As Rui reflects on his pitiful past, Tanjiro comforts him after sensing his grief, leading to his reunion with his parents in the afterlife. Giyu chastises Tanjiro for his empathy toward demons, but Tanjiro defends them as tragic beings. A few seconds later, Shinobu moves to harm Nezuko, but Giyu gets in her way. This paves the way for Tanjiro to escape with Nezuko, but they are stopped by Kanao, who attempts to harm Nezuko. A Kasugai Crow announces that Tanjiro and Nezuko should be taken to the Demon Slayer Corps Headquarters for recovery.\n\nRehabilitation Training Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 45-53\n\nEpisodes S1 E22-E26\n\nThe Hashira, the most powerful members of the Demon Slayer Corps, place Tanjiro on trial for traveling with a demon (Nezuko). They deliberate on how to execute him, including Giyu, who supported him, but Shinobu urges caution. Tanjiro explains Nezuko's situation, but his pleas are dismissed as biased. Sanemi Shinazugawa (Snake Hashira) arrives and attacks Nezuko, leading to a clash with Tanjiro. Master Kagaya Ubuyashiki intervenes, citing a letter from Urokodaki, the former Water Hashira, promising that Nezuko would not harm any human.\n\nUbuyashiki also reveals Tanjiro's encounter with Muzan Kibutsuji and being Muzan’s most wanted demon slayer. While the Hashira stare at him in awe, Sanemi maintains his stand against harboring a demon, cuts himself, proceeds to stab Nezuko, enticing her with his blood. She rejects it and goes back into her box. Ubuyashiki considers this proof and proclaims Nezuko and Tanjiro as demon slayers.\n\nAfter the trial, the siblings are taken to the Butterfly Mansion, where Tanjiro joins Zenitsu and Inosuke in recovery. In their meeting, the Hashira note the increasing occurrence of demons and the need for more skilled Demon Slayers. Back at the Butterfly Mansion, Tanjiro and friends begin their rehab training, but Zenitsu and Inosuke give up after failing to defeat Kanao. Motivated by Kanao's abilities, Tanjiro perseveres through challenging training, learns more about the Kocho family tragedies, and about Shinobu’s resolve to create a more peaceful world.\n\nSome days later, during training, Tanjiro finally matches Kanao's speed and successfully destroys a gourd with his breath, motivating Zenitsu and Inosuke to join him. Tanjiro and Inosuke receive new swords after they were destroyed by the Spider Family. Tanjiro finally floors Kanao in a sparring match, signifying the end of their rehabilitation training.\n\nMonths after Rui's demise, a demon in an interdimensional castle summons the remaining Lower Rank demons. Muzan expresses anger and disappointment in their sheer weakness, criticizing them and ends up killing them, sparing only Enmu. Back at the Butterfly Mansion, Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke receive a mission to go aboard the Mugen Train and join the Flame Hashira to investigate the disappearances on the train.\n\nMugen Train Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 54-66\n\nMovie: Kimetsu no Yaiba: The Movie - Mugen Train\n\nEpisodes S2 E1-E7\n\nAfter receiving reports of demon activity at the Mugen Train station, Kyojuro Regoku investigates and catches whiff of Slasher, the demon that has been terrorizing the area. Slasher attacks the engineers working on a train in the station. Rengoku attempts to fight the demon, but it makes a quick dash and runs to a bento stand, attempting to use an old woman to stop Kuojuro from killing it. After a brief exchange, Kyojuro beheads it.\n\nTanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke join Kyojuro on the Mugen Train to investigate the demon responsible for the disappearance of 40 people. A few minutes after they board the train, Kyojuro quickly defeats two demons. Enmu, a member of the Twelve Kizuki, puts all the passengers to sleep.\n\nEnmu tells four children to enter the demon slayers' dreams and kill them by destroying their spiritual cores. Locked in their respective dreams, Tanjiro and his comrades dream ideal and pleasant scenarios, where Tanjiro reunites with family, Kyojuro reflects on the past with his brother, Zenitsu dreams of the future with Nezuko, and Inosuke dreams about leadership.\n\nAware of the trap the demon slayers are in, Nezuko uses her Blood Demon Art to cut off the intruders' connections to them, waking up her brother. He manages to subdue the children as they attack him and gently knocks them out. Nezuko wakes up the others and Tanjiro confronts Enmu, ultimately decapitating him. Enmu then fuses with the train and attempts to consume the passengers one after the other.\n\nKyojuro wakes up and directs Tanjiro and Inosuke to find Enmu's neck while he, Nezuko, and Zenitsu guard the passengers that are still asleep in the train. Tanjiro and Inosuke discover Enmu's neckbone in the train’s engine room. They battle its various defenses, which include a Blood Demon Art that causes continuous sleep. A conductor stabs Tanjiro amidst the chaos, and Inosuke aids Tanjiro by exposing and severing Enmu's neckbone, resulting in his demise and derailing the train. Seeing how badly wounded Tanjiro is, Kyojuro teaches him a breathing technique that’ll help heal his wounds.\n\nAkaza, the Upper Rank Three demon of the Twelve Kizuki, disrupts their momentary peace. He pressures Kyojuro to become a demon and fight him for eternity, but Kyojuro declines and fights him instead. Tanjiro and Inosuke watch as Kyojuro fights, as they’re both too weak to help him. Kyojuro is unable to match Akaza's regenerative abilities, despite his perseverance. He uses his strongest attack, but Akaza mortally injured him. While Kyojuro tries to stall Akaza until sunrise, Akaza manages to break free, destroying Kyojuro's sword, and flees into the forest. A short while later, Kyojuro dies, and crows relay the news of his death to the Hashiras and the leader.\n\nEntertainment District Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 67-97\n\nEpisodes S2 E8-E18\n\nAfter his confrontation with Kyojuro, Akaza reports to Muzan, who expresses dissatisfaction with his failure to eliminate all the demon slayers he met on the train. A few days later, Tengen Uzui sends his wives to investigate the demonic presence in Yoshiwara by infiltrating the district's largest courtesan houses. After they disappear without a trace, he plants Tanjiro and his friends in the same houses as he’d done with his wives, tasking them with uncovering the mysteries that abound there.\n\nThe young demon slayers settle into their respective houses and uncover the presence of a demon. They meet to exchange info. Tanjiro and Inosuke's info exchange is interrupted by Tengen, who sends Tanjiro and Inosuke away to protect them. They both stay loyal and prepare for the fight. Tanjiro reveals his true identity to the Oiran and bids her goodbye. Tengen then interrogates Zenitsu's Housemaster at knifepoint to obtain information on suspected demon activities.\n\nAfter exchanging information with each other, they go their separate ways to find the exact location of the demon lurking in the entertainment district. After some time, Tanjiro locates one of Tengen’s wives, Hinatsuru, and engages the Daki, the demon they’ve been searching for. Inosuke on the other hand, finds a narrow passage under his house that leads to a cavern lined with obi cloths that Daki uses to trap and eat her victims. A short while later, Tengen joins him and helps him rid the cavern of all the obi, releasing all those trapped inside it.\n\nDuring the battle between Tanjiro and Daki, the district suffers significant destruction and numerous innocent lives are lost. Just when she’s about to deal a huge blow to Tanjiro, Tengen rushes in, beheads Daki, and watches as Gyutaro emerges from within her. After a brief exchange of words, Gyutaro begins unleashing his techniques on them. Tengen blows Daki away.\n\nAfter being blown away, Daki faces off against Inosuke and Zenitsu, while Tanjiro and Tengen battle against Gyutaro. The battle becomes so intense that the demon slayers get tired, while the demons seem to keep getting stronger and faster. After a fateful twist, Inosuke succeeds in beheading Daki. But as he makes to run away, the scrawny-looking demon thwarts his attempt, nearly killing him, and revives Daki. After another round of evading strikes from the demons, the demon slayers realize they need to behead the two demons simultaneously.\n\nSoon after, Hinatsuru shoots a set of poisoned knives at Gyutaro, which helps slow him down. With their stamina depleted and one final swipe, they succeed in beheading the demon siblings at the same time. As Gyutaro’s body disintegrates, he detonates a surge of blood blades which tear everything around him down, causing devastating damage to the town. Nezuko then saves Inosuke and Tengen by burning away Gyutaro’s poison from their bodies. As Tengen’s wives come to him, he declares his retirement from the Corps.\n\nSwordsmith Village Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 98-127\n\nEpisodes S3 E1-E11\n\nAmongst the debris that remained of the entertainment district, the Kakushi locate Tanjiro and his friends. They take them to the Butterfly Mansion for treatment, while Tengen Uzui leaves with his wives. Muzan Kibutsuji meets with the Upper Moon demons, berates them for being useless, and ends the meeting by sending Hantengu and Gyokko on a mission.\n\nA few weeks later, Tanjiro finally wakes up. After he regains his strength, he is sent off to the Swordsmith Village to get another sword where he meets three other demon slayers. While searching for Hotaru, Tanjiro sees Muichiro (Mist Hashira) and Kotetsu arguing about Kotetsu’s doll, which Muichiro wanted to train with. In the end, he trains with the doll and ends up cutting one of the six arms off. Afterward, Kotetsu allows Tanjiro to train with the doll, and after a series of attempts, Tanjiro severs the doll’s head, revealing a tarnished sword embedded inside the doll. Hotaru appears and leaves with the sword to hone the weapon for Tanjiro.\n\nSometime later, Gyokko and Hantengu sneak into the Swordsmith Village. Gyokko starts sucking the villagers into his vases and Hantengu approaches Tanjiro and Muichiro. They quickly begin clashing. While battling Hantengu, they find out that beheading him always leads to the regeneration of two more demons, which are manifestations of his emotions.\n\nWhile battling one of Hantengu’s emotions, Muichiro gets blown away to another end of the village. He sees that the village has been besieged by armed walking demon fish, created by Gyokko. He fights them off and saves Kotetsu from an almost certain death. Gyokko suddenly appears before Muichiro and traps him inside a water vase. At the same time, Mitsuri Kanroji (Love Hashira) arrives at the village, kills an army of the demon fish, and saves the village chief from the grasp of a huge demon fish.\n\nIn the chaos, Tanjiro joins forces with the Wind Hashira’s brother Genya and Nezuko to battle all four of Hantengu’s clones. After a series of futile attempts at beheading the clones, Genya goes after Hantengu and discovers that beheading the upper rank demon is next to impossible. As one of Hantengu’s clones attempts a deadly strike towards Genya, the demon slayer recalls his tragic childhood, thinking that this was the end . But Tanjiro shields him, and they both go after Hantengu.\n\nSuddenly, Sekido starts absorbing the other clones, creating a new and powerful clone called Zohakuten. Zohakuten places Hantengu in a protective orb and angrily lashes out at the demon slayers. Just when he’s about to kill Tanjiro, Mitsuri springs in out of nowhere, slashes his wooden dragons, and saves Tanjiro. In another part of the village, Muichiro gathers the strength to break out of Gyokko’s confinement. For a minute, he remembers his tragic childhood, from how he lost every member of his family to how he became a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.\n\nAfter breaking out of Gyokko’s water prison, he engages him in a fierce battle. He evades all of Gyokko’s blood demon art, while the demon also evades all of his strikes. The deciding moment came after Muichiro sustained some injuries and starts using some visual-obscuring techniques of his breathing technique against Gyokko, before finally beheading him. He then collapses as the effect of Gyokko’s poisons starts affecting him, after which Kozo and Kotetsu come to his aid.\n\nIn Mitsuri’s fight, she misreads one of Zohakuten’s attacks and he stuns her with his sonic waves. She’s knocked unconscious before Zohakuten could land a killing blow. While out, she remembered her childhood, up until when men started turning her down due to her abnormal hair color and strength. Apparently, this influenced her decision to join the Demon Slayer Corps in search of strong men, for she felt the need to marry someone stronger than herself.\n\nTanjiro and Genya help her ward off Zohakuten and, as she regains consciousness, she fiercely engages the demon. Tanjiro, Genya, and Nezuko go after Hantengu so they can kill him. Genya then shows that he could gain the abilities of demons whom he consumes. As Tanjiro moves to behead Hantengu, the demon grows bigger and becomes Urami, his last clone.\n\nAs they fight against Urami, he falls off a cliff. He sees some villagers and runs towards them to devour them and gain back his strength. As the sun starts rising in the East, Tanjiro runs to shield Nezuko from it, but she kicks him away so he can finish off Urami and behead Hantengu. After finally killing Hantengu, Tanjiro mourns for Nezuko but is shocked after he sees that she is perfectly fine.\n\nA quick flashback tells of Muzan’s actual origins, as he was born with a terminal illness, and had been turned into a demon by his doctor, as a way of saving him from certain death. He’d grown stronger over the years by consuming humans and also started making other demons. When Tanjiro prepares to leave the village, the villagers thank him amidst fanfare and with joy.\n\nALERT: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n\nAll the arcs mentioned earlier have already made their way into the anime adaptation. If you're ready to venture further, brace yourself for the SPOILER SECTION ahead, delving into the various other arcs found in the Demon Slayer manga. While you await the upcoming seasons, feel free to explore our additional Demon Slayer articles. However, if curiosity compels you, scroll down and let's unravel the rest together.\n\nHashira Training Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 128-136\n\nTBA\n\nAfter a seven-day coma, Tanjiro wakes up and discovers that the Swordsmiths have been moved to another village. Other emergency villages have been established for them to move to, should the need arise. Lady Tamayo and the Demon Slayer Corps try to understand more about Nezuko’s new condition, and Inosuke and Zenitsu return to the Butterfly Mansion.\n\nDuring a Hashira meeting, it was decided that all demon slayers (including the Hashiras) were to engage in intensive training so all Hashiras could obtain their demon slayer marks and all other demon slayers could have Hashira-level skills. Afterward, Ubuyashiki tasked Tanjiro with convincing the obstinate Giyu to join them in the training, which after some persuasion, he agreed to.\n\nBack at the Butterfly Mansion, Haganezuka brings Tanjiro his new sword, and Inosuke breaks the news of the Hashira Training to Tanjiro and Genya. Zenitsu and Inosuke joined others in the intensive Hashira training. Everyone noticed the seeming decline in demon appearance. Shinobu also reveals that she wouldn’t be joining in the Hashira training, but would rather work with Tamayo to create poisons to use against demons.\n\nSome days later, Tanjiro recovered fully and joined the others in training. He spends ten days training his stamina under Tengen Uzui and proceeds to spend another five days training quick movements under Muichiro Tokito. With Mitsuri, they dance to improve their flexibility and afterward Obanai teacheshim sword skills. After he completes the training here, he moves on to Sanemi’s house for speed training (which Sanemi calls “Infinite Pounding Training”) and sees more of the animosity that Sanemi bears towards his younger brother, which gets him in trouble.\n\nAs his training with the Wind Hashira ended abruptly, he headed to Himejima’s house for the last phase of the Hashira training. Himejima’s muscle training proved to be the hardest he’s ever had to undergo. There he meets Inosuke and Murata also trying and failing at their training. After getting some pointers from Genya, they all complete the training.\n\nUnknown to them, all through their training, Nakime, a demon, was spying on and mapping the exact location of all demon slayers. After he finishes his training with Himejima, he heads to Giyu’s house and meets Sanemi who storms off after a brief altercation. But on his way home, he catches a whiff of a demon eye spying on him. At the same time, Muzan suddenly appears at the Ubuyashiki residence, and walks up to an ailing Ubuyashiki.\n\nFinal Battle Arc\n\nInfinity Castle Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 137-183\n\nTBA\n\nMuzan and Ubuyashiki converse briefly while the rest of the family go about their business. Unknown to Muzan, crows already fly out to alert all demon slayers of Muzan’s presence at the Headquarters. As they all rush out, they see the headquarters go up in smoke and explode. As Muzan regenerates from the effect of the explosion that was laced with wisteria, the Asakusa demon traps him with his spike-creating flesh seeds, and Tamayo pounces on him. As he attempts to kill Tamayo, Himejima steps in and blows his head off.\n\nSeeing Muzan’s insane regenerative abilities, he repeatedly blows his head off, enough to buy time for the other demon slayers to arrive. They draw their swords at Muzan, they’re suddenly teleported into Infinity Castle. In the Infinity Castle, they’re all split up and besieged by an army of demons, which they easily cut through and start searching for Muzan. While searching for Muzan, Shinobu sees Doma (Upper Rank Two) as he murders and eats some people in a room. Infuriated, she engages him in combat, injecting him with poisons, which he quickly breaks down in his body.\n\nHe then starts displaying his blood demon art and paralyzes one of her lungs, and after a series of failed below-the-belt attacks, Doma severely injures her and eats her at the exact moment that Kanao walks into the room. In another room, Zenitsu comes across his former senior, Kaigaku, who has now become a demon. After a brief argument, they start fighting, and Kaigaku uses various forms of his Thunder Breathing technique to deal fatal blows to Zenitsu. Just when he intended to deal a finishing blow, Zenitsu uses an unknown seventh form to behead him, and slumps, only to be helped by Yushiro as he was falling.\n\nOn their way to locate Muzan, Giyu and Tanjiro are jumped by Akaza. He commends Tanjiro’s increased skills and speed, especially after he’s blown Giyu away. A few moments later, he returns to the fray and, as he has gained his demon slayer mark, becomes fiercer and faster. Unfortunately, he was still no match for Akaza’s Compass Needle. A quick recollection of his father helped Tanjiro overcome the sight of Akaza’s technique and protects Giyu from a fatal strike while beheading Akaza.\n\nAs they stood wondering why Akaza’s body was not disintegrating, Akaza knocks Tanjiro out and attempts to regenerate his head. However, he then remembers his life as a human and then resolves to kill himself. Back to Doma and Kanao, the two consecutively use different techniques against each other. As Doma snatches her sword and lures her to come get it, Inosuke jumps in and joins her in battling the demon. He retrieves her sword, and as he engages Doma, the demon takes off his boar mask and immediately recognizes him.\n\nDoma tells Inosuke the story of how he met and killed his mother, which further infuriates Inosuke. He then uses his blood demon art to create small icy clones of himself to keep Inosuke and Kanao busy, but his body starts disintegrating from the large dose of wisteria flower poison that Shinobu had ingested before he ate her. As he pulls a stunt out of desperation, Kanao and Inosuke also go all out and succeed in beheading him.\n\nIn another room in the Infinity Castle, Mitsuri and Obanai engage Nakime, the new Upper Rank Four demon. At the same time, Muichiro Tokito encounters Kokushibo, the Upper Rank One, and finds out that he’s Kokushibo’s descendant. As he unleashes a new technique, Kokushibo responds with his Moon Breathing technique and severs Muichiro’s right hand. Recovering immediately from the cut, he attacks Kokushibo again, but the demon pins him to a wall with his sword, before Genya starts shooting at the demon from the entrance.\n\nKokushibo thwarts Genya’s advance and slices him in two at the torso, and Sanemi jumps in to save his younger brother. In the ensuing battle, Sanemi proves to be more than Kokushibo thought he’d be and even uses his blood (which has an intoxicating effect on demons when ingested/exposed) to aid himself. A short while later, Himejima joined them in battle, while Sanemi used the time to heal his wounds.\n\nA little while later, he joins Himejima and the two coordinate their attacks against Kokushibo. As soon as he joins the fray, he loses two fingers and Kokushibo morphs his sword to get more serious. Seeing his brother and comrades losing the fight, Genya desperately swallows a lock of Kokushibo’s hair and broken sword, giving him more demonic abilities that he uses to root Kokushibo down to a fixed point, limiting his movements.\n\nKokushibo succeeds in killing Muichiro, but Sanemi and Himejima use Genya’s blood demon art as an advantage to behead the demon. At this time, Muzan has ingested Tamayo and some demon slayers who he swiftly killed to regain his strength. Crows fly around Infinity Castle to keep everyone updated on the battle. Shortly after they receive orders to engage Muzan, Giyu and Tanjiro come across him and start battling the demon king.\n\nIn their battle against Muzan, Tanjiro gets slashed in one eye. Just as he is about to receive a fatal blow, Mitsuri jumps in and helps him, much to Muzan’s surprise who thought she’d died. Muzan then finds out that he’d been tricked by Yushiro who had hypnotized and is controlling Nakime. Muzan attempts to remotely kill Nakime, but Yushiro holds onto her and uses her abilities to break up the Infinity Castle.\n\nSunrise Countdown Arc\n\nManga Chapters\n\nAnime Episodes\n\nChapters 184-205\n\nTBA\n\nAs Infinity Castle collapses, the demon slayers realize they’re actually in a city. They have to keep Muzan occupied till the sun rises in another hour and a half. As his feet touch the ground, Muzan morphs blade whips from his hands and uses it to repel Iguro and Mitsuri as they try to cut him. Tanjiro follows the horde of demon slayers who intend to serve as human shields for the Hashiras. As he lay unconscious, Nezuko wakes up at the Rengoku residence and races to Tanjiro. Just when Mitsuri dove at Muzan, intending to sacrifice herself, Himejima and Sanemi joined them, bringing a ray of hope once more.\n\nAs Tanjiro lies unconscious, his mind wanders into Yoriichi’s memories, and he gets to understand more about the first sun breathing user, Kokushibo (his brother), and the circumstances that surrounded their lives. Back to reality, Muzan keeps pressuring the Hashiras with endless attacks, which they can only dodge out of sheer luck and instinct. Mitsuri gets a deadly injury and has to be sent to Yushiro for treatment.\n\nAs the Hashiras were getting weary of Muzan’s unending attacks, Chachamaru jumped in and injected them all with medicines to heal and further invigorate them, filling them with energy to continue their battle. While the demon king continued to slash at them, Inosuke, Zenitsu, and Kanao broke through his defense undetected, hidden by Yushiro’s paper talismans, and succeeded in landing blows on him. One after the other, the Hashiras then devise ways to make their swords become bright red, and use it to severely injure Muzan and further slow down his regeneration.\n\nBarely after their hopes are raised, he squashes it again and beats them all into a corner. Just as he’s about to kill Kanao, Tanjiro steps in and faces him alone, combining all twelve dances of his Hinokami Kagura consecutively. As this was going on, Yushiro and the Kakushi tended to the wounded. Obanai joined Tanjiro again in fighting against Muzan. Sooner than expected, the effects of Tamayo’s aging drug take a significant effect on Muzan and the scars of his battle with Yoriichi become clear, showing Tanjiro the vital points to attack.\n\nKnowing his death is near, Muzan turns tail and runs, but everyone pulls him back, including Inosuke and Zenitsu, who just regained their strength. As the sun rises on the horizon, Muzan transforms into a huge demon baby and tries to crawl into the earth and get some shade. They stop him in his tracks, holding him until the sun rises fully and burns him away completely. The Kakushi tend to the wounded. As they mourned Tanjiro’s death, he suddenly sprung back to life… As a demon! He started tearing through his comrades, who have gathered again to stop him. Nezuko attempts to bring him to his senses and Kanao stabs him with the medicine to make him human again.\n\nAfter three months, Tanjiro and his friends have fully recuperated at the Butterfly Mansion, and the Hashiras held their final meeting, where Kiriya disbanded the Demon Slayer Corps. They have buried their dead and Tanjiro and Nezuko finally return home.\n\nThe End… For Now!\n\nSo, dear Demon Slayer aficionados, as we close the manga scrolls and bid farewell to animated swordsmanship, remember this: demons may be defeated, but the thrill lingers. Whether you're a seasoned manga master or an anime enthusiast, the journey doesn't end here. As Tanjiro once said, \"The bond between Nezuko and me can't be severed by anyone!\"\n\nUntil we meet again, Sayonara!"
