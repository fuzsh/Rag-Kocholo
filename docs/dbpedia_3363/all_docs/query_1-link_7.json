        "text": "StoryEpisodeTitle [10][11]Directed by [10]Storyboarded by [10]Original air date [12]English air date [13]Viewership rating [14]451\"Someone's Dream\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Dareka no Yume\" (Japanese: 誰かの夢)Shin'ya Shimomura & Takashi SuharaTakashi Suhara\n\n& Yūichi TeraoApril 9, 2023 ( )[b]August 11, 2024[9]8.0%\n\nAfter their battle in the Entertainment District, Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Nezuko are found by the Kakushi. In the Infinity Castle, Muzan summons the remaining Upper Ranks. He admonishes them for their failure to kill the Ubuyashiki family or find the Blue Spider Lily. When Upper Five Gyokko provides new information, he is sent on a joint mission with Upper Four Hantengu. While Zenitsu and Inosuke are sent to individual missions, Tanjiro continues rehabilitating. When swordsmith Hotaru Haganezuka refuses to forge him a new sword, Tanjiro journeys with Nezuko to the Swordsmith Village to discuss the matter. He meets village chief Tecchin Tecchikawahara, who reassures him about Hotaru. Tanjiro is shown to the village's hot springs where he meets Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji and Genya, Sanemi Shinazugawa’s younger brother and fellow Final Selection survivor. Mitsuri later hints at Tanjiro about a \"secret weapon\" that can make him stronger. The next day, Tanjiro finds Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito arguing with someone and seemingly with them is a man from his dreams.\n\n462\"Yoriichi Type Zero\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Yoriichi Zeroshiki\" (Japanese: 縁壱零式)Akihiko UdaKei TsunematsuApril 16, 2023 ( )August 18, 20247.6%\n\nTanjiro tries to defend the boy from Muichiro but is knocked unconscious for interfering. The boy, Kotetsu, explains that the \"man\" he saw is actually a mechanical training doll, built during the Sengoku period. Made by his ancestors, it is his only heirloom. Tanjiro agrees to protect it but they find Muichiro’s training has caused severe damage. After Kotetsu discovers it remains functional, he orders Tanjiro to train with it and surpass the arrogant Muichiro. However, training proves harsh as Kotetsu denies Tanjiro food and water when he fails to improve. When he faints from exhaustion, Tanjiro imagines himself in the afterlife and sees a peculiar stone in the Sanzu River, enabling him to detect attacks pre-emptively. He lands a powerful blow on the doll's head, which reveals a concealed sword.\n\n473\"A Sword from Over 300 Years Ago\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Sanbyaku-nen Ijō Mae no Katana\" (Japanese: 300年以上前の刀)Ken NakazawaHideki HosokawaApril 23, 2023 ( )August 25, 20246.4%\n\nTo Tanjiro's and Kotetsu's disappointment, the sword has rusted. Hotaru, who had undergone solitary training, arrives to restore it. Tanjiro later attempts to befriend Genya but is rebuffed. Gyokko and Hantengu infiltrate the village. Hantengu faces Tanjiro, Nezuko, and Muichiro, who beheads him. Two new demons grow from his body; one of them, Karaku, blasts Muichiro away with his uchiwa, and the other, Sekido, shocks the siblings with his khakkhara. Genya arrives and beheads them with a sawed-off shotgun and a Nichirin wakizashi. However, the demons split again; the winged Urogi carries Tanjiro away and hits him with a sonic shriek, while Nezuko tries to defend Genya from the yari-wielding Aizetsu. In the forest, Muichiro finds Kotetsu being attacked by a fish-like demon. Initially choosing to leave him, he saves Kotetsu after remembering Tanjiro's advice.\n\n484\"Thank You, Tokito\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Tokitō-kun Arigatō\" (Japanese: 時透君ありがとう)Hideki HosokawaHideki HosokawaApril 30, 2023 ( )September 1, 20247.0%\n\nKotetsu begs Muichiro to save Hotaru and his smith Kozo Kanamori. Muichiro initially elects to protect the village but remembers Kagaya's advice about triggering his memories to return, prompting him to rescue the swordsmiths. Tanjiro realizes each demons represents an emotion: joy (Urogi), anger (Sekido), pleasure (Karaku), and sorrow (Aizetsu). Genya confuses Sekido and Aizetsu with his resistance to fatal wounds. Nezuko burns Karaku and blasts him away with his uchiwa but is restrained by Sekido. Tanjiro uses Urogi to reach Nezuko and avoids Sekido's attacks. He frees her but both are incapacitated when Karaku pins them with a blast of wind. Mitsuri makes her way to the Swordsmith Village.\n\n495\"Bright Red Sword\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Kakutō\" (Japanese: 赫刀)Takuya NonakaTakuya NonakaMay 7, 2023 ( )TBA7.2%\n\nAfter saving Kozo, Muichiro is taken to his shed for a new blade, where they encounter Gyokko. Using her whip-like sword and Love Breathing, Mitsuri swiftly kills the demons. After Karaku pins Nezuko beneath heavy debris, she grips her hands onto Tanjiro's blade, coating it with blood. Muichiro attacks Gyokko and discovers he can produce new vases and teleport between them to avoid getting slashed. He is poisoned by Gyokko's attacks and trapped in a watery vase, suffocating him. Using her fire, Nezuko heats up Tanjiro's blade into a bright red hue. Sekido realizes the blade resembles that of the swordsman who almost killed Muzan. As his scar becomes a fiery mark once more, Tanjiro unleashes his Hinokami Kagura and swiftly beheads Urogi, Karaku, and Sekido. He notices Aizetsu has been beheaded by Genya but is shocked to see he has assumed the appearance of a demon.\n\n506\"Aren't You Going to Become a Hashira?\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Hashira ni Narun ja Nai no ka!\" (Japanese: 柱になるんじゃないのか！)Seiji HaradaKei TsunematsuMay 14, 2023 ( )TBA7.6%\n\nWhen the four emotions do not disintegrate, Tanjiro informs Genya of a hidden fifth demon. Genya expresses jealousy towards him and declares he too shall defeat an Upper Rank, to which Tanjiro responds with encouragement. He and Nezuko fight off the demons while Genya finds the now minuscule Hantengu, but he fails to behead him before Sekido attacks. Believing he will die, Genya recalls his past; he and his family were frequently abused by his father, who was later killed. One night, a demon entered their house, killing all five of Genya's younger siblings before it was fought off by Sanemi. He later found him standing in front of their mother’s body, who was the demon, and branded him a murderer in his grief. Genya laments dying without apologizing to Sanemi when Tanjiro saves him from Sekido. After Genya saves him from Aisetzu, Tanjiro goes after Hantengu.\n\n517\"Awful Villain\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Gokuakunin\" (Japanese: 極悪人)Hideki HosokawaYō MiuraMay 21, 2023 ( )TBA7.0%\n\nTanjiro attacks Hantengu but is confronted by his manifested hatred Zohakuten, whose Blood Demon Art is summoning giant wooden dragons. Zohakuten, who in actuality is the four demons in one body, hides Hantengu inside a hardened wooden burl. Gyokko enters Kozo's shed to find Hotaru polishing Tanjiro's blade; he attacks him out of spite but grows annoyed when Hotaru ignores him. Muichiro, near death, sees a vision of Tanjiro, who reassures him that someone will come; Kotetsu appears and fruitlessly stabs the watery pot until he is attacked by a small demon. Muichiro dissuades him from trying to help when Kotetsu blows bubbles into the pot, giving him sufficient air to break free. He realizes the reason Tanjiro seems familiar to him is because he shares the same eye color as his father.\n\n528\"The Mu in Muichiro\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Muichirō no Mu\" (Japanese: 無一郎の無)Jun'ichi MinaminoToshiyuki ShiraiMay 28, 2023 ( )TBA7.0%\n\nAs Muichiro grows weak from his ordeal, he regains his memories; as a child, he was orphaned after his mother became ill and his father died on a trip to save her. His twin brother Yuichiro became embittered by their deaths. Kagaya's wife Amane visits to recruit them into the Corps but it provokes Yuichiro, who rants about the futility of helping others and how they are fated to join their dead parents. One night, a demon found them and wounded Yuichiro. In a blinding rage, Muichiro defeated the demon and witnessed his brother's last moments, apologizing to him and praying he would survive. Marks then appear on his face, enhancing his speed and strength. He finds Gyokko about to kill Kozo and Hotaru and attacks him. Gyokko, shocked that he had escaped, uses multiple attacks but fails to stop Muichiro.\n\n539\"Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Kasumi Bashira・Tokitō Muichirō\" (Japanese: 霞柱・時透無一郎)Akihiko UdaYō MiuraJune 4, 2023 ( )TBA7.3%\n\nWith his attacks overpowered, Gyokko reveals his true form, a large merman-like being with lethal touch, before attacking Muichiro again. Muichiro remembers when Amane found him and his relentless training to become stronger, his perpetual rage pushing him forward. Using his enhanced speed and a self-taught Mist Breathing form, Muichiro overwhelms Gyokko and beheads him. His marks fade and he reels from exhaustion and the poison's effects. Kozo and Kotetsu aid him; the latter was saved from being mortally wounded by Kyojuro's tsuba in his shirt, which Tanjiro had previously given him. Tanjiro, Nezuko, and Genya struggle against Zohakuten’s dragons; Tanjiro is swallowed by one and nearly crushed in its jaws when Mitsuri arrives, slicing it apart and saving him, before she confronts Zohakuten.\n\n5410\"Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Koi Bashira・Kanroji Mitsuri\" (Japanese: 恋柱・甘露寺蜜璃)Yūji ShimizuYūji ShimizuJune 11, 2023 ( )TBA7.6%\n\nMitsuri destroys the dragons but is stunned by Zohakuten and knocked unconscious. He moves to kill her as she recalls her past: she developed her abnormal strength, unique hair color, and large appetite as a child. Once a source of pride, she attempted to hide these traits after an annulled marriage proposal caused her to long to be seen as normal. However, it troubled her to realize she was hiding her true self; joining the Corps allowed her to act freely and with acceptance. Mitsuri awakens to see Tanjiro, Nezuko, and Genya rescuing her. She apologizes for her mistake and re-engages Zohakuten with new vigour. He notices that she too has a mark on her neck and concentrates his efforts on her, leaving Hantengu's burl exposed. Tanjiro, Nezuko, and Genya, who reveals his ability to gain demonic traits by consuming their flesh, destroy the burl but Hantengu escapes once more.\n\n5511\"A Connected Bond: Daybreak and First Light\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Tsunaida Kizuna Kawataredoki Asaborake\" (Japanese: 繋いだ絆 彼は誰時 朝ぼらけ)Ken Nakazawa, Seiji Harada,\n\nTakashi Suhara & Jun'ichi MinaminoHaruo Sotozaki\n\n& Takashi SuharaJune 18, 2023 ( )[c]TBA7.6%"
