        "text": "Sabito and Makomo (錆 (さび) 兎 (と) と真 (ま) 菰 (こも) , Sabito to Makomo?) is the 3rd episode of the Kimetsu no Yaiba TV anime series.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThe Demon Slayer Corps…an organization that's been hunting down demons since ancient times. Sakonji Urokodaki begins Tanjiro's training for the Final Selection, the test for those wishing to join the corps. His training begins with navigation of a mountain riddled with booby-traps, dry sword swings, waterfall immersion, and breathing techniques. A year later, Sakonji informs Tanjiro that he has nothing more to teach him, and gives him one last hurdle to overcome in front of a giant boulder...[1]\n\nPlot[]\n\nBefore embarking on his journey to become a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro creates a journal to log his training for Nezuko to read, who is still asleep. As he worriedly looks at her, Sakonji tells him his training will now begin. He explains that the Demon Slayer Corps is comprised of several hundred members, and though it isn’t recognized by the Japanese government, it has been active since ancient times.\n\nSakonji goes on to explain demons to him; it is unknown how they first appeared, but what is certain is their physical prowess and powerful regeneration. Some can shape shift, and others have completely different powers entirely; the only way to kill them is with sunlight or using a special sword. Though humanity fights back against demons with their slow regeneration and higher mortality, they continue to do so to protect others. Sakonji explains that as a trainer among many, he will guide Tanjiro through his own unique path to get stronger using the mountain, and that he must attend the Final Selection held on Mount Fujikasane to become a Demon Slayer; he alone will decide if he is fit to enter the selection.\n\nAfter days of repeatedly descending the mountain, Tanjiro is now able to dodge and weave through most of the hidden traps, thanks to his greater strength and becoming more adept at detecting scents. Despite this, the traps continue to get more difficult and dangerous, with Sakonji now deploying them laden with knives and spikes. After being given a sword to simulate real battle conditions, however, his movements become hampered, and Tanjiro becomes caught in the traps again. For the next several days, Tanjiro is tasked with swinging his blade over and over again throughout the day, with Sakonji increasing the difficulty each time.\n\nThen, he explains the mechanics of swords: the blade is strong vertically but weak horizontally and can be prone to breaking. Sakonji demonstrates that applying force along the blade is the correct way to cut, as well as threatening Tanjiro severely should he break the blade. In the next lesson, Tanjiro is repeatedly felled by Sakonji, with the goal of teaching him to arise quickly in battle. Then, Sakonji instructs Tanjiro to charge towards him while armed with a sword; despite Tanjiro running at his full speed, he is flipped in the air effortlessly by the old trainer.\n\nNext, Tanjiro is taught a special breathing technique called Total Concentration Breathing, and Sakonji also explains that he will then teach him all ten forms of Water Breathing. Told to take a deep breath to allow oxygen to flow throughout his body, Tanjiro takes a long inhale, only to be slapped in the stomach by Sakonji for his incorrect method. Later, he moves on to the forms to use while using Total Concentration, only to be repeatedly slapped again for being wrong and for not bracing his stomach. Later, Sakonji instructs him to “become one with the water,\" which involves kicking Tanjiro off a cliff into a cold river.\n\nSix months have passed since his training commenced, and Nezuko still remains asleep. Though Sakonji had summoned a doctor to check on her, nothing was determined to be wrong with her. Scared that he may find her dead one morning, he worries for her wellbeing every day. Tanjiro now makes his final, instructed climb and descent of Mount Sagiri; he is able to traverse the harsh landscape and defeat all of the traps successfully.\n\nOne year after taking him in as his student, Sakonji suddenly informs Tanjiro he has nothing more to teach, telling him his success is now up to him. Walking through the forest, he takes Tanjiro to a clearing, the site of an immense boulder adorned with shide. Sakonji tells Tanjiro that he will only allow him to enter Final Selection if he is able to slice it. Shocked at the monumental task, Tanjiro calls out to his trainer, but Sakonji leaves without saying anything else. Taking a stance in front of the boulder, Tanjiro tries to slice it in an initial attempt, which promptly fails.\n\nAll by himself, Tanjiro recalls all the previous lessons he was taught by Sakonji and trains himself to get stronger. With the basic lessons in his journal, he practices them over and over again in an attempt to accomplish his goal. For six months, he repeatedly attempts to slice it without success, and Tanjiro drops his sword one day in exhaustion, his hands severely callused from swinging his sword incessantly in failure. Feeling hopeless because of his lack of gain in training for so long, Tanjiro yells out his frustration and urges himself to keep going.\n\nHe is suddenly silenced by the appearance of a young swordsman atop the boulder, wearing a fox mask. The young man tells him that his whining is inappropriate if he calls himself a man, while Tanjiro is stunned by his unexpected appearance. He leaps off the boulder and kicks Tanjiro, deflecting his sword with his own wooden blade. The swordsman instructs Tanjiro to charge at him; when Tanjiro becomes worried since he has a real blade against his wooden practice sword, the young man only laughs at his concern and taunts him by thinking he had a chance of hitting him. He lunges at Tanjiro with incredible speed and informs the boy that he is much stronger than him because he has sliced that boulder.\n\nHe leaps into the trees and speeds around the forest in a display of his skills before knocking Tanjiro to the ground. The swordsman admonishes Tanjiro for not mastering anything, in particular the breathing techniques by Sakonji. Realizing that the stranger knows Sakonji, Tanjiro is told he has only known the techniques as a fact and has never properly learned them, much less used them. As he attacks Tanjiro, the swordsman tells him to pound the lessons into his body to never forget them.\n\nTanjiro responds by saying he has been trying for so long without making any improvement, but the swordsman responds by telling him the only way he can now go is forward. Commanding the boy to attack him again, Tanjiro sprints towards the swordsman with all his energy; his swing is promptly dodged, and the swordsman slams his blade into Tanjiro’s chin, knocking him unconscious. With the boy on the ground unconscious, the swordsman mutters, “I’m leaving the rest to you,\" as a young girl enters the forest.\n\nWhen Tanjiro awakens, the girl asks if he is alright. Tanjiro tells her about the incredible strike he was dealt and how no movement was wasted by the swordsman. When he wishes to be as powerful as him, the girl tells him he can too since she will be looking after him, smiling gently as Tanjiro notes her pretty appearance. The girl’s name is Makomo, while the swordsman from earlier is named Sabito. Makomo corrects the mistakes and nuances Tanjiro has made to improve his form.\n\nWhen asked where she is from, Makomo doesn’t respond, only telling him that she and Sabito love Sakonji dearly. Makomo and Sabito were raised by Sakonji after they were orphaned, and she tells him that there are other children like them, always watching him. Though confused by her strange, dreamy demeanour, Tanjiro is taught by Makomo the importance of Total Concentration Breathing; it accelerates both his blood circulation and heart rate, causing his temperature to spike and allowing him to match a demon’s strength while staying human.\n\nThe vital lesson is to expand his lung capacity in order to flood his body with air and allow his bones and muscles to gain strength. Confused at the mechanics of the technique, Tanjiro inquires how he can gain such power; Makomo only tells him, “Train to death.”\n\nTanjiro works on expanding his lung capacity while swinging his sword, a laborious and painful task. Each time he spars with Sabito to improve his technique, the swordsman proves too fast to hit. Six months after meeting the two, Tanjiro and Sabito have a final match, with Sabito now armed with a real sword. As Makomo watches the two ready for their clash, Tanjiro announces that he will win this day. As he takes a long breath to strengthen himself, he notes that head-on battles are simple; the stronger and faster person wins. He and Sabito lunge towards each other, but it is Tanjiro who makes the first swing, ending the fight.\n\nTanjiro’s blade slices Sabito’s mask, which falls and reveals his face, curved into a relieved smile. Makomo sees this and smiles gently as well. She commends Tanjiro’s success and says a final message of advice: “Win, okay, Tanijro. Beat that guy, too.” She and Sabito disappear from the forest in a haze, and Tanjiro realizes that his swing, believing he had slashed Sabito's mask, has actually sliced the boulder in half.\n\nCharacters in Order of Appearance[]\n\nTanjiro Kamado\n\nNezuko Kamado\n\nSakonji Urokodaki\n\nSabito\n\nMakomo\n\nAnime Notes[]\n\nThe anime shows Tanjiro writing in his journal to Nezuko, whereas the manga just mentions that he kept a journal for her during the timeskip.\n\nWhile training how to swing a sword, the manga shows Tanjiro counting at least 716 swings, while the anime shows Tanjiro completing 1,000, as well as Sakonji demanding 500 more.\n\nTanjiro making a first attempt at cutting the boulder is only depicted in the anime.\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]"
