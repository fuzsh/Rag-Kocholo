        "text": "The release dates are yet to be announced but we do know fans will be able to see the trilogy on the big screen to see the franchise bow out in style.\n\nWhen Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba debuted as a manga in 2016, it quickly took the world by storm, with over 150 million copies in circulation – making it the ninth best-selling manga series of all time.\n\nSoon after the anime's season 1 premiere in 2019 came more TV seasons and movies within the franchise that adapt Koyoharu Gotouge’s original manga – which ended in 2020, with 23 volumes in total.\n\nMore like this\n\nHowever, it's important to note that you don't technically have to watch everything the Demon Slayer anime has released, as some instalments actually cover similar ground, or in fact, even compact certain episodes into feature-length presentation. It can be a little confusing...\n\nThe series follows Tanjiro Kamado, a teenager who is training to be a demon slayer. We follow his journey as he climbs the demon slayer ranks after his family is killed and his sister is turned into a demon.\n\nSeason 4 is officially at an end, with fans thrilled by the action-packed adaptation of the Hashira Training Arc.\n\nBut in what order do the different seasons and the film take place and where can fans in the UK watch them all?\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about how to watch the Demon Slayer franchise in order.\n\nHow to watch the Demon Slayer franchise in order\n\nThe Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba manga series has so far spawned four seasons of anime and two spin-off films - with three more films on the way.\n\nThe best order to watch the seasons in is as follows:\n\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba season 1\n\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train OR Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba season 2 - Mugen Train Arc\n\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba season 2 - Entertainment District Arc\n\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Swordsmith Village OR Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba season 3 - Swordsmith Village Arc\n\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba season 4 - Hashira Training Arc\n\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba Infinity Castle film trilogy (upcoming)\n\nHowever, that's not the be all and end all.\n\nNewcomers to the franchise should start with season 1 of the anime, but it is after this that viewers will have different options presented to them.\n\nThe second season of the series was split into two separate arcs – the first is titled the Mugen Train Arc, while the second is the Entertainment District Arc.\n\nThe first film from the franchise is titled Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train, and it covers the same story as the first half of the TV show’s second season. In fact, the film came first, but the TV show features some original content for viewers looking for something new. However, it is skippable and you won't be missing out on much of the story!\n\nThe second film, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – To the Swordsmith Village, adapts the final two episodes of season 2, as well as the first episode of season 3, while season 3 adapts the manga’s Swordsmith Village arc in full.\n\nThe fourth season adapted the Hashira Training arc, which is actually quite a short and sweet arc compared to the Swordsmith Village arc. However, while many fans expected a season 5, instead they'll get the Infinity Castle arc in the form of a trilogy of films.\n\nWhere to watch Demon Slayer in the UK\n\nAll four seasons of Demon Slayer, alongside the Mugen Train movie, are available to stream on Crunchyroll in the UK.\n\nThe release dates of the Infinity Castle films are yet to be announced but, presumably, the films will be available in cinemas worldwide.\n\nHow many episodes of Demon Slayer are there?\n\nThere are 63 episodes of Demon Slayer altogether.\n\nAll four seasons of Demon Slayer are currently available to watch on Crunchyroll.
