        "text": "WFCA & Intterra Webinar Series\n\nCOVID-19 has produced an unprecedented series of new issues for the fire service. Daily operations have been impacted in several ways, from the increasing demand for PPE on all calls, social distancing, and additional operational difficulty due to those firefighters exposed or quarantined. COVID-19 is much like Wildfire in that it is borderless and without jurisdiction. Wildfire season is here, and the idea of running fire camp in light of COVID-19 has created real issues for local, state, and federal agencies.\n\nTo track the conversation and offer real solutions to help the fire service, Intterra, and the Western Fire Chiefs Association (WFCA) have come together to produce a series of webinars focused on COVID-19 and Wildfire. These roundtable discussions are candid, focusing on the issues and guidance circulating throughout the fire service. Real-world experience, insights, and lessons learned are discussed as we navigate these unfamiliar times together."
