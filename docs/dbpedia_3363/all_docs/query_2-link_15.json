        "text": "Demon Slayer Season 4: Attention all Demon Slayer fans! Gather 'round! The Hashira Training Arc has begun, and it's already exceeding expectations! In the first two episodes alone, we've witnessed some jaw-dropping developments. Picture this: a bulked-up Tanjiro taking center stage, and tantalizing glimpses into Muzan's next moves. With each passing moment, the plot thickens, leaving us on the edge of our seats. Before you dive into the third episode, let's recap the thrilling events of the first two episodes of the Demon Slayer Hashira Arc.\n\nWhere to watch Demon Slayer Hashira Training Arc Episode 3\n\nAll episodes of 'Demon Slayer Season 4' will premiere on Netflix, Crunchyroll, and JioCinema. However, if you're watching on Netflix in India, expect each episode to drop a day after the specified release dates.\n\nDemon Slayer Season 4 Episode Wise Release Date Schedule\n\nEpisode 1 - May 12, 2024 (Released)\n\nEpisode 2 - May 19, 2024 (Released)\n\nEpisode 3 - May 26, 2024\n\nEpisode 4 - June 2, 2024\n\nEpisode 5 - June 9, 2024\n\nEpisode 6 - June 16, 2024\n\nEpisode 7 - June 23, 2024\n\nEpisode 8 - June 30, 2024\n\nHashira Training Arc Episode 2: Recap\n\nTitled ‘Water Hashira Giyu Tomioka’s Pain’\n\nAlso read: Demon Slayer KNY Season 4: Recap, What To Expect From The Highly Anticipated Anime\n\nTanjiro found Giyu and immediately launched into a barrage of questions about Hashira training, pleading for Giyu to tell him. But Giyu flatly refused, his expression clouded with frustration. He couldn't shake the disappointment that the young DS hasn’t mastered Water Breathing, the hallmark of a potential Water Hashira.\n\nAfter persistent pestering, Giyu relented, finally sharing the heavy burden weighing on his mind. He confided in Tanjiro about his own failure: the Final Selection. At just 13, he had braved the trial alongside Sabito, a fellow disciple of Urokodaki. Sabito, with his kindness and unwavering sense of justice, had fought valiantly during the Selection. Yet, despite his efforts and sacrifices, he fell to a formidable demon lurking in the dark forest.\n\nGiyu, too, suffered in that trial. A blow to the head rendered him unconscious, and when he awoke, it was over. He technically passed, but doubts gnawed at him. He wondered if he truly earned that success or if it was merely luck. These doubts shadowed his every step, leaving him feeling unworthy of his title as Water Hashira.\n\n(Info credits: Crunchyroll)\n\nAlso read: Demon Slayer Season 4: Release Date, Total Episodes, Where To Watch And What To Expect\n\nHashira Training Arc Episode 3: What to expect\n\nAccording to Screenrant, Tanjiro's wounds from the Swordsmith Village arc will be completely healed in the forthcoming third episode. He will be able to take part in the much anticipated Hashira Training bits now that he is back to his healthy self. Many fans are eager to see the amazing hero return in action because Tanjiro has been recovering after pushing himself to the brink during the previous demon confrontations. Demon Slayer's Hashira Training Arc appears to be one of the most intriguing seasons to date, even after two episodes.\n\nDemon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc Episode 3 is titled \"Fully Recovered Tanjiro Joins the Hashira Training!!\""
