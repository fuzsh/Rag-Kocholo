        "text": "Updated on April 25, 11:41 a.m. (GMT+8): Improved relevancy.\n\nThe third season of Demon Slayer delivered an emotionally charged storyline filled with impactful reveals.\n\nWe have prepared a detailed overview in our Demon Slayer Season 3 ending explained article, tackling the key events that took place in the 70-minute special.\n\nHere is the impact of the events in the finale, including the anticipated plans of Demon King Muzan Kibutsuji, the series’ main antagonist\n\nWarning: Spoilers if you have not watched the Demon Slayer Season 3’s Swordsmith Village arc.\n\nDemon Slayer Season 3 ending explained\n\nThere is a lot to unpack in the Season 3 finale. In Episode 11, titled “A Connected Bond: Daybreak and First Light,” we witness Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko Kamado, and Genya Shinazugawa in hot pursuit of Hantengu’s primary form.\n\nMeanwhile, the Love Pillar, Mitsuri Kanroji, valiantly defends herself against Zohakuten, an upper-rank demon that can control a wooden dragon.\n\nTanjiro remembers a conversation with Zenitsu Agatsuma, which helps him understand how to utilize Thunder Breathing.\n\nWith this knowledge, Tanjiro effectively pushes Hantengu to his limits by closing the distance with Thunder Breathing and dealing heavy damage with the Hinokami Kagura dance.\n\nIn a fierce battle involving Tanjiro, Nezuko, and Genya, they manage to force the Upper Demon Moon off a cliff.\n\nDesperate to regain his strength, Hantengu tried to devour the nearby villagers. Just as Tanjiro was about to pursue Hantengu, Muichiro Tokito, the Mist Pillar, threw him a 300-year-old Nichirin sword that Hotaru Haganezuka had sharpened in previous episodes.\n\nUtilizing the combined power of Thunder Breathing and the Hinokami Kagura, Tanjiro successfully defeated Hantengu. However, to Tanjiro’s dismay, he discovers that Hantengu is still alive, concealing his smaller form within his heart.\n\nAs the sun begins to rise, Tanjiro faced a difficult choice: save the villagers from Hantengu’s wrath and allow the demon to escape, or rescue Nezuko, who will burn to death because of her fatal weakness to sunlight.\n\nWith her brother struggling to make a decision, Nezuko selflessly threw Tanjiro to Hantengu, allowing Tanjiro to decapitate the Upper Rank Four demon.\n\nThe series then takes a major, unexpected turn, revealing that Nezuko is immune to sunlight.\n\nAlthough two of his Upper Demon Moons, Hantengu and Gyokko, perished, the Demon King Muzan Kibutsuji found great joy in discovering a demon impervious to sunlight. Muzan’s only weakness is the sun — if he devours a demon with the power to overcome sunlight, he will finally become immortal.\n\nFor a thousand years, Muzan integrated himself into human society to search for the Blue Spider Lily flower — the ingredient used by his doctor in an experimental procedure that turned him into the first-ever demon. He believed this was one of the keys to conquering his weakness to sunlight.\n\nMuzan’s second solution was to create more demons and consume one immune to sunlight.\n\nHow the events from Season 3 set the stage for the upcoming arcs\n\nThe revelation that Nezuko is immune to sunlight is one of the most significant events in the entire Demon Slayer series.\n\nMuzan didn’t consider the Demon Slayer Corp a major threat because his demons have always been far superior throughout the years. However, now that the Demon Slayers have something Muzan desperately wants, this will only lead to a collision course between the two factions.\n\nAnother pivotal scene in the Episode 3 finale was when Lady Tamayo explained her scientific findings in a letter to Tanjiro. With the use of the Upper Demon Moon blood that Tanjiro collected, along with Nezuko’s demon blood, Lady Tamayo was able to free a demon from Muzan’s control.\n\nUpon studying Nezuko’s blood, Lady Tamayo realized that Nezuko couldn’t regain her sense of self and remained in a childlike state because she was prioritizing something more important than herself.\n\nNezuko’s story has always been a focal point of the series. She is a demon who doesn’t consume human flesh or blood. She has also saved her brother, along with other humans, countless times.\n\nEven her Blood Demon Art is a power that only hurts other demons. Nezuko is the only demon who is the closest to being human, which could explain why she is immune to sunlight.\n\nJust a heads up, some of the links on ONE Esports are affiliate links.
