        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from The Anchor Point Podcast on Spotify. Well folks, its about that time to start calling it dunzo for the season...With that comes a whole new set of challenges - The boredom, the part where you have to explain to the \"normies\" what you do for work, the awkward reintegration into your own family, figuring out what you're going to do during the winter, the holidays, where you're going to live - The list goes on...All of this stacks up, and it can be an overwhelming experience for the folks that are young in the game... It can even be more difficult for the folks that are seasoned in the fire game.Thats why we have Shannon Mead on the show today to talk about the importance of having a plan for the off season, and also not having a \"Glide-path\" to actually wind down from the adrenaline high and stress of the fire season.Heres a little more about Shannon:Shannon Mead is a local clinician in Reno, Nevada who specializes in military, law enforcement, wildland firefighters, and first responders...\"As a therapist, adoptive mom, and friend/family member to a whole bunch of first responders - I know that helping takes a heavy toll on those who are willing to shoulder the burden. And unfortunately, the existing supports aren’t always helpful (to put it kindly). Whether I am working with individuals, couples, or an entire organization, my purpose is to strengthen those who sacrifice for our community.  I have a Masters degree in Couple and Family Therapy from Antioch University and a corporate coaching certificate from Fielding University. I am intrigued by systems and patterns, and as a therapist I tend to be practical and straightforward. Perhaps that is because I spent many years as a tech and data consultant before pivoting into counseling. Over the years I have become increasingly interested in compassion fatigue and secondary trauma, and focused most of my research on these topics. As a foster/adoptive parent I have felt the burden myself, but have also seen it in the lives of my guardian friends and family. I absolutely hate that those who step in to help are often chewed up by the roles and I’m working hard to do something about it.\"She is just one of the many \"culturally competent clinicians\" out there that are available... Please feel free to use her practice as a resource this season.You can find her practice here:https://www.stackofstones.com Shannon also just produced a training video with some great tips on winding down for the off season!You can find that video, and a bunch of other good stuff at the following links here:https://www.stackofstones.com/wildland-resourceshttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuxxAjOcs6P5MfZC8NCoPHgCall her, email her, do whatever you need to do to take care of yourselves before, during, and after the fire season!You know the drill...Stay safe, stay savage...Enjoy!..........................Updates!We launched a Patreon!!!
