While the story arc titles are official, the season sorting has never been made clear by any official sources. Mugen Train Arc and Entertainment District Arc are generally considered to be a single second season due to both airing back-to-back and the former mainly being a recompiled cut of the 2020 Mugen Train film.\n\nSeason 1: Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc (2019)\n\n[edit]\n\nStoryEpisodeTitle [28][29]Directed by [28]Storyboarded by [28]Original air date [30][c]English air date
