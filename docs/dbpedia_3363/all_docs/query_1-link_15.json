        "text": "Demon Slayer spoilers follow – including season 3's ending.\n\nDemon Slayer is great when it comes to the demons, and it's also pretty great when it comes to the slaying of them too. That's what we're here for, after all. Incredible, god-tier fights that look like they were animated by the gods themselves. That's why the anime, based on Koyoharu Gotouge's manga of the same name, is so popular still, three seasons in.\n\nBut with so much focus on the battles and the animation that accompanies them, it's fair to say that some characters get short thrift during the quieter moments in between. And whether you agree with this or not, much of that criticism has been levelled at Nezuko in particular.\n\nAlthough the relationship between Tanjiro Kamado and his sister beat at the heart of this show, Nezuko can sometimes be easy to overlook as she was essentially muted following her initial transformation into a demon. Throw in some contention around her adult form, and it's safe to say that Demon Slayer's best demon has had a rough ride of it over the years.\n\nThe season three finale changes all that though, with a bold new development fans of the manga have been clamouring to see on screen for some time now. But that's not all. Grab some sakura mochi and join us here at Digital Spy as we break down everything that happened in this game-changing season three finale.\n\nDemon Slayer season 3 ending, explained\n\n'A Conquered Bond: Daybreak and First Light' kicks off right where we left off last week, with Tanjiro, Genya, and Nezuko chasing after the tiny Hantengu. He might be small, but this freaky little demon is actually the main body of multiple demons, so if the gang have any hope of surviving, this little pipsqueak needs to have his head cut off asap.\n\nAs Mitsuri Kanroji fights off the more powerful manifestations of Hantengu, Tanjiro uses knowledge of thunder techniques gained from Zenitsu to catch up with the tiny demon. Even with his leg injury, the move pays off, enabling Tanjiro to take a stab at Hantengu's neck. However, before he can slice through completely, the demon grows massively in size and starts squishing our hero's head.\n\nGenya and Nezuko catch up just in time and help Tanjiro escape the demon's clutches, but in the fight, everyone falls off a cliff nearby.\n\nAs our heroes recover, Hantengu makes a run for it across the field, even as dawn approaches. The demon needs human flesh and he needs it fast if he has any hope of regaining the strength that he's lent to his other, larger duplicates.\n\nSeeing that the demon has found some humans to devour, Tanjiro prepares to step in and save them, despite suffering even more injuries. A weakened Muichiro Tokito appears at the top of the cliff with the sword that Haganezuka has been working on. He's not finished it yet, but that doesn't matter. Tanjiro needs it now, so Tokito throws it down.\n\nNezuko appears ready to lend her support. The sun is rising though, so Tanjiro tries to send her away. His sister's having none of it because she needs to warn him of Hantengu's intent. That's when dawn breaks, burning Nezuko up like it would any other demon.\n\nTanjiro tries his best to shield his sister from the sun, asking her to shrink down as he wraps himself around her. It's too late though. Nezuko is about to die, and so are the humans who Hantengu is getting ready to chomp down on. That means Tanjiro has an impossible choice to make.\n\nShould he save the people in need? Or should he choose his sister's life over them instead? Tanjiro is pretty much defined by the love for his sister and also his role as a protector of innocents, so he freezes up, unable to choose between the two.\n\nDemon Slayer started with Tanjiro and Nezuko and their bond is still the emotional tie that forms the backbone of this show. There is no Demon Slayer without Nezuko.\n\nAnd that's when Nezuko makes the decision for him with a kick that sends Tanjiro in the direction of the demon he needs to stop. As she sacrifices herself to save both those people and also Tanjiro's conscience, flashbacks punctuate the strength of their bond and just how devastating her death will be for them and us alike.\n\nThese are the actions of a true hero, and not the silenced, often objectified woman who's spent half this show carried around in a box.\n\nIt's devastating to lose Nezuko at this point though, just as she's granted some rare, much-needed agency of her own.\n\nBut there's no time to mourn for us or Tanjiro because Nezuko's sacrifice must be honoured by stopping Hantengu and saving the day. That's exactly what Tanjiro does by sniffing out the real demon who's hidden his main body away in the larger one that's terrorising everyone.\n\nRight before Hantengu has his neck severed for good, and yes, for real this time, brief flashbacks reveal he was pretty much the same back when he was a human too. Always whimpering, and just as cruel, even going out of his way to rob blind people. But right before he was supposed to die for his crimes, the Big Bad Muzan arrived to make him the demon he is today.\n\nWell, was, because Tanjiro succeeds in his mission and defeats the mewling creature who's caused so much pain this season. That means the demonic double Kanroji has been battling this whole time is defeated too — and just in the nick of time.\n\nBut everyone's favourite Demon Slayer isn't exactly in the mood to celebrate. That is, until Nezuko suddenly appears alive and well. The burns have all healed and she's even able to talk now, although her vocabulary is limited and some of her demonic features still remain. She's becoming human again, but the transformation is yet to be completed.\n\nIn lesser hands, this kind of quick, turn-around resurrection might have felt like a copout, but not here. This pivotal moment transforms a fan-favourite character into an even better one, laying to rest some of the show's biggest criticisms in one fell swoop.\n\nHow this will be handled remains to be seen of course, at least for fans who haven't read the manga already, but trust us when we say it's definitely a step in the right direction for Nezuko's character, and also Demon Slayer as a whole.\n\nMaking Nezuko so pivotal to the thrust of this franchise moving forward is a welcome change that also strengthens the bond at the heart of it all. It means that everything Tanjiro has fought for, everything he's done for his sister, hasn't been in vain.\n\nWe're not the only ones excited about Nezuko overcoming the sun, either. Elsewhere, the villainous Muzan has discovered Nezuko's newfound ability, and it's a game-changer for him too.\n\nAll this time, Muzan has been searching for a demon who can walk in the sunlight because he himself cannot, and that indignity has held him back ever since he first became a demon. The doctor whose medicine helped ignite this transformation is already dead — because of Muzan of course — so his only hope to become a \"perfect\" being lies with Nezuko.\n\nThe episode ends with a celebration as the whole Swordsmith Village rolls out to thank Tanjiro and the gang, but we're too busy worrying about Muzan's new plans to enjoy it for long. Could we really lose Nezuko again so soon after we almost lost her for good?\n\nWe'll stay silent on that for now, just like Nezuko once was, but just know that this hugely promising development means big things for Demon Slayer.\n\nThe good news is we officially know that the show is returning for more demon-duelling carnage with season four, as confirmation came when the season three finale aired in Japan.\n\nThe bumper final episode ended with a shot of the Demon Slayer Corps' Hashira, showing the top fighters of the corps before a banner unfurled to reveal that another season is coming for plenty more slayage.\n\nWithout spoiling too much ourselves, it looks like season four will adapt the Hashira Training arc, which plays out in chapters 128–136 of the original manga series.\n\nHere's the synopsis for fans who want a little tease: \"Tanjiro goes to see the Stone Hashira, Himejima, who intends to prepare him for the battles to come. The training to become a Hashira – a high-ranking member of the Demon Slayer Corps – is intense and demanding.\n\n\"Earning Himejima's approval seems impossible, but Tanjiro won't give up! Meanwhile, the demon lord Muzan continues to search for the location of Nezuko and Ubuyashiki.\""
