        "text": "Cruelty.\n\nI had no idea what to expect going in. I read the words ‘Demon Slayer’ and thought of a really experienced guy who slayed demons and was seriously overpowered but…. that…. wasn’t it.\n\nThe MC, Tanjiro, is a beautiful and precious boy who lives with his mum and five siblings. He’s a hardworking big brother who helps people around the village and sells charcoal to help his family.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nPrecious, aren’t they?\n\nWell guess what? They die.\n\nYup, you read that right.\n\nOne night, Tanjiro is running late after selling charcoal and helping out the villagers with his keen sense of smell, so he decided to stay over at Grandpa Saburo’s place. The next morning, Tanjiro makes his way home and finds his family has been killed, the only one with any sign of life in them is his younger sister Nezuko.\n\nIt was so heartbreaking to see Tanjiro’s happy and loving family destroyed in one night! I always hate it when the plot involves a twist like this.\n\nThe moment Tanjiro discovers his family is so eerie and the visuals, along with the music, portrays it so well. The desperation with which Tanjiro carries Nezuko to try and help her broke my heart!\n\nBut then, Tanjiro slips and takes a dive off a cliff and so does the narration. The appearance, lecture and monologue of Giyu Tomioka, a Demon Slayer, disrupted the flow for me. The pacing of the dialogues and monologue felt out-of-sync and weird, especially where Tanjiro is begging Giyu not to kill Nezuko and Giyu is yelling and preaching about how weak Tanjiro is but monologue-ing about how if only he’d gotten there sooner and how Tanjiro should use his rage to fuel his ambitions. Like, just pick one! Either preach or encourage!\n\nI think the flow between the inner thoughts and dialogue for Giyu could’ve gone smoother. Also, I think that Giyu’s character was written to be stoic and serious so the shouting felt out of character and left me…… conflicted.\n\nGiyu provides advice to Tanjiro on where he should go next and the episode ends with Tanjiro and Nezuko burying their family and running off into the snowy woods. Not sure if they’ll be taking Giyu’s advice or just doing their own thing, I guess we’ll find out next episode.\n\nI loved the starting and the visuals of the ending but Giyu’s appearance didn’t strike any response from me, if anything, it was annoying and led to me having mixed feelings about the episode."
