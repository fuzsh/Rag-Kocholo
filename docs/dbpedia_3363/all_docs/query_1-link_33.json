        "text": "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba season 3 is wrapping up the Swordsmith Village arc, leaving us wondering if Tanjiro will ever get his blade fixed. anime fans have watched poor Hotaru Haganezuka take a demon beatdown while the Mist Hashira (and Love) helped the swordsmiths fend off attacks. It's been a ride!\n\nUltrapowerful Upper Moon demons Hantengu and Gyokko turned this mission into must-see TV this season. But all the villainy, fighting and flashbacks were worth the watch, and it's time to brace for the finale. Here's how to watch the last episode of Demon Slayer: Swordsmith Village Arc.\n\nRead more: Best Anime Streaming Services for 2023\n\nWhen to watch Demon Slayer season 3\n\nAfter closing out the Entertainment District Arc in the manga and TV series, this Swordsmith storyline in Demon Slayer picked up where the story left off, placing Tanjiro on a path to find a mysterious, ancient weapon while his sword is being repaired. Episodes air in Japan at 11:15 p.m. JST, and fans in the US and 200 other countries can stream the series on Crunchyroll.\n\nCrunchyroll will simulcast the final episode of Demon Slayer season 3 on Sunday, June 18 at 10:45 a.m. PT (1:45 p.m. ET) in the US with subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Arabic, Russian and Hindi.

With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the anime series from anywhere in the world. There are other good reasons to use a VPN for streaming, too.\n\nA VPN is the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds by encrypting your traffic. Using a VPN is also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. Streaming TV can be a bit smoother with a reliable, quality VPN that's passed our tests and security standards.\n\nYou can use a VPN to stream content legally as long as VPNs are legal in your country and you have a valid subscription to the streaming service you're using. The US and Canada are among the countries where VPNs are legal, but we advise against streaming or downloading content on illegal torrent sites. We recommend ExpressVPN, but you may opt for another provider from our best list such as Surfshark or NordVPN.\n\nFollow the VPN provider's instructions for installation, and choose a country where Demon Slayer season 3 is streaming on Crunchyroll. Before you open the streaming app, make sure you are connected to your VPN using your selected region. If you want to stream the special episode on more than one device, it's possible you'll need to configure each one to ensure you are signed in. Go to settings and check your network connections to verify you're logged in and connected to your VPN account. Now you're ready to open Crunchyroll to stream.\n\nIf you run into issues with streaming, first make sure your VPN is up and running on its encrypted IP address. Double-check that you've followed installation instructions correctly and you've picked the right geographical area for viewing. If you still encounter connection problems, you may need to reboot your device. Close all apps and windows, restart your device and connect to your VPN first. Note that some streaming services have restrictions on VPN access."
