        "text": "It was an open secret, and for the moment it will remain so, but those cries will be heard in every corner of the planet. The official website of the Jump Victory Carnival, the summer festival where all kinds of manga and anime news are announced, has published that the final arc of ‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’ will be a trilogy of movies, as rumored, and has just deleted it. Would it be one of the surprises planned for the festival? We will have to wait until the festival starts on July 21st to find out for sure.\n\nThe fourth season of the anime, which sometimes adapts only a page and a half of the manga per chapter, will end with 2 arcs and more than 60 chapters of the manga to recreate. Specifically, we have the climax of the series (and one of the best arcs in the history of the manga), part of the Infinity Castle arc, and also the conclusion and farewell of ‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’, which will take place in the so-called Sunrise Countdown Arc (chapters 184 to 205 of the manga, 16 in total).\n\nThis would put an end to the complaints of those who point out that the first season of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’ had 52 episodes and the fourth only 8. A slowdown that also affected the movies, as the movie of ‘To the Hashira Training’ was poorly received by viewers, as it seemed more like a marathon of episodes than a full-fledged work like that of ‘Mugen Train Arc’.\n\nLet’s see if we’re not going to complain now that it’s not enough and that we should have stretched the gum more. Anyway, we’ll see what Jump Victory Carnival has to tell us."
