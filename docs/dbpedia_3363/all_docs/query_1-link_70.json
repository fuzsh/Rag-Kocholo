However, those in other countries can stream Episode 3 on Crunchyroll and Netflix.\n\nWhat Happened in Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc Episode 3 ?\n\nThe main emphasis of Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc's second episode was Water Hashira Giyu Tomioka and his challenging past. The head of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kagaya Ubuyashiki, urged Tanjiro to try to persuade Giyu to participate in the Hashira Training.\n\nInitially, Giyu was unresponsive to Tanjiro's attempts but he eventually spoke up about some unsettling parts of his past, which helps to explain why he was reluctant to participate in the Hashira Training, after much prodding from Tanjiro.\n\nAlso read: Demon Slayer Season 5 Might Just Be Around The Corner: Hereâ€™s Why\n\nTanjiro urged Giyu to carry on as a Hashira and pass on the knowledge and talents that Sabito had bestowed upon him. Giyu consented to participate in the Hashira Training following this interaction.\n\nTanjiro's wounds from the Swordsmith Village arc will be entirely healed in the upcoming episode. He will be able to take part in the much anticipated Hashira Training activities now that he is back to his healthy self."
