        "text": "Demon Slayer season 3 is well under way, with fans getting weekly releases of the hit anime series. However, there’s still a mystery of just how many episodes there are in season 3. Thankfully, we have an updated list and the latest end date information to help guide fans toward the fast-approaching finale.\n\nHow many episodes are in Demon Slayer season 3?\n\nDemon Slayer season 3 is anticipated to have 11 episodes.\n\nSomeone’s Dream\n\nYoriichi Type Zero\n\nA Sword from Over 300 Years Ago\n\nThank You, Tokito\n\nBright Red Sword\n\nAren’t You Going to Become a Hashira?\n\nAwful Villain\n\nThe Mu in Muichiro\n\nMist Hashira Muchichiro Tokito\n\nTBA\n\nTBA\n\nAt the time of writing, reports suggest that Demon Slayer season 3 will be 11 episodes long. However, there is the possibility of an additional episode making for 12 in total.\n\nLeaker @shonenleaks_ is one of several making claims about Demon Slayer season 3’s 11 episodes:\n\nDemon Slayer season 3’s 11/12 episodes would make for the shortest season so far, considerably less than season 1’s 26 episodes and season 2’s 18 episodes.\n\nThose fans who were expecting season 3 to incorporate the Hashira Training Arc will be disappointed to learn of the shorter length. However, it’s possible that this arc is planned for a second cour. This has yet to be confirmed, however.\n\nWhen does Demon Slayer season 3 end?\n\nDemon Slayer season 3 is anticipated to end on June 18.\n\nThe Demon Slayer season 3 finale is expected for June 18. However, with the possibility of another episode, it could well end on June 25.\n\nFor now, there is no official confirmation of when season 3 is scheduled to end. Once it’s made clear, this post will be updated accordingly."
