        "text": "Demon Slayer spoilers follow.\n\nDemon Slayer's Tanjiro has a whole lot more slaying to do, and the same goes for the show as well.\n\nWe've seen the humble charcoal seller survive the slaughter of his family and train to become a master demon slayer, taking on the various ranks of nasties who populate Japan's nether realms. It's been a gripping, brutal and thrilling ride so far, and thankfully, the story isn't over just yet.\n\nSo, pick up your finest blade and start practising those breathing techniques before you join us here at Digital Spy as we reveal everything you need to know about Demon Slayer season four.\n\nRelated: Solo Leveling anime release date and more\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 release date: When does Demon Slayer season 4 come out?\n\nDemon Slayer season four (aka the Hashira Training Arc) is officially beginning on May 12 and will be available to watch internationally on .\n\nPreviously there was roughly a two-year gap between each season, so we're very excited to learn that Tanjiro and the whole Demon Slayer corps will be returning much earlier than expected.\n\nSimilar to the launch of the Swordswmith Village arc, Demon Slayer season four debuted at special cinema screenings worldwide in February. The theatrical release, titled Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – To the Hashira Training, included the hour-long season three finale, and an extra-long season four premiere.\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 cast: Who's in Demon Slayer season 4?\n\nBar any issues behind the scenes, all the regular Japanese and English voice actors will return for Demon Slayer season four, including:\n\n• Tanjiro Kamado – Natsuki Hanae / Zach Aguilar (English)\n\n• Nezuko Kamado – Akari Kitô / Abby Trott (English)\n\n• Inosuke Hashibira – Yoshitsugu Matsuoka / Bryce Papenbrook (English)\n\n• Zenitsu Agatsuma – Hiro Shimono / Aleks Le (English)\n\n• Muzan Kibutsuji – Toshihiko Seki / Greg Chun (English)\n\n• Kagaya Ubuyashiki – Toshiyuki Morikawa / Matthew Mercer (English)\n\n• Water Hashira, Giyu Tomioka – Takahiro Sakurai / Johnny Yong Bosch (English)\n\n• Love Hashira, Mitsuri Kanroji – Kana Hanazawa / Kira Buckland (English)\n\n• Mist Hashira, Muichiro Tokito – Kengo Kawanishi / Griffin Burns (English)\n\n• Flower Hashira, Kanae Kocho – Ai Kayano / Bridget Hoffman (English)\n\n• Tsuguko Kanao Tsuyuri – Reina Ueda / Brianna Knickerbocker (English)\n\nNew cast members will likely be announced closer to the launch date when future plot details are confirmed.\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 plot: What will happen in Demon Slayer season 4?\n\nUnlike many anime adaptations, Demon Slayer doesn't have to play catch-up with the source material because Koyoharu Gotouge's manga ended in 2020 – which means spoilers are out there for anyone interested in looking ahead.\n\nWithout spoiling anything ourselves, we now know season four will adapt the Hashira Training arc, which plays out in chapters 128–136 of the original series.\n\nHere's the synopsis for fans who want a little tease: \"Tanjiro goes to see the Stone Hashira, Himejima, who intends to prepare him for the battles to come. The training to become a Hashira – a high-ranking member of the Demon Slayer Corps – is intense and demanding. Earning Himejima's approval seems impossible, but Tanjiro won't give up! Meanwhile, the demon lord Muzan continues to search for the location of Nezuko and Ubuyashiki.\"\n\nWe wouldn't be surprised if season four also continues beyond this by tackling the Infinity Castle arc, at least in part. While there won't be space to do all of chapters 137-183 justice, expect some of it to kick off before season five.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a brief synopsis of what the Infinity Castle arc might have in store:\n\n\"The Demon Slayer Corps plunges into Infinity Castle to defeat Muzan. Shinobu engages in a fierce fight against Doma, the Upper-Rank two demon. Poison doesn't work on him, so she finds herself in an intense struggle. Will she be able to defeat the demon who killed her older sister?! Then another demon appears before Zenitsu and blocks his way…\"\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 trailer: Any Demon Slayer season 4 footage yet?\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 released its first official trailer alongside the news that the show would return on May 12.\n\nThe trailer (which can be seen at the top of this article) predominantly features footage from the show's opening episode, first seen in a limited theatrical release earlier this year, and introduces us to the Hashira who will be training Tanjiro and his friends."
