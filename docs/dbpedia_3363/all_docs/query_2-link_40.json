        "text": "BY Harris\n\nPublished 2 years ago\n\nThe Demon Slayers\n\nThe Demon Slayer Corps has hundreds of members. The organization isn’t recognized by the government, but they have existed since ancient times, dedicated to hunting demons to this day. However, the one who leads them remains a mystery.\n\nEqually mysterious are the demons, who seem to emerge from the darkness. They can do incredible feats such as healing, regeneration, shape-shifting, as well as other supernatural abilities. Only sunlight and specialized blades can kill them. The Demon Slayer Corps are outmatched; still, they fight for the sake of humanity.\n\nTraining\n\nTanjiro runs through the mountains to train. Sakonji is one of the instructors who train others using their own unique method. In order for Tanjiro to pass the selection, he must take part in a final test at Fujikasane Mountain. However, his trainer must give him the seal of approval.\n\nTanjiro runs downhill through the trap field, training every morning, honing his body and his sense of smell. The traps increase in difficulty. He also starts practicing with a sword.\n\nSakonji teaches him Breathing Techniques, particularly the Breath of Water. These techniques will help him with healing, focus, and stability. Tanjiro is thrown over a waterfall to learn how to be one with water.\n\nMeanwhile, Nezuko has been sleeping for six months. The doctor couldn’t find anything wrong, but this worries Tanjiro every day.\n\nHis training becomes harder as days pass by, and his skills improve. Eventually, the time came when Sakonji can’t teach him any further. The master takes Tanjiro to a huge boulder in the middle of the woods. To prove himself worthy of participating in the Final Selection, he needs to cut the rock in half.\n\nThe Rock\n\nTanjiro thinks it’s impossible, but Sakonji leaves him. He tries slicing it, but it doesn’t budge. Six months pass by, and he still hasn’t completed the task. Every day, he fails and tries again. He feels discouraged many times, but he doesn’t quit for Nezuko’s sake.\n\nSuddenly another masked swordsman appears before him, sitting atop the rock. This one is wearing a fox mask, but Tanjiro couldn’t smell him. The masked swordsman challenges him with a wooden sword, saying he’s feeble, whiny, and immature.\n\nTanjiro asks him who he is, but instead, the masked man insists on fighting. He claims to be able to cut the rock and that he is superior to Tanjiro. The man with the fox max shows him exactly that; he overpowers Tanjiro in their fight. He tells Tanjiro that he has learned the Breath technique. However, he has yet to incorporate it into his body.\n\nThe masked man pushes Tanjiro, telling him he’s not following his training properly. Tanjiro defends himself helplessly, saying he’s done all that he can but he still can’t cut the rock.\n\nHelpers\n\nTanjiro loses and gets knocked out in their first bout. A little girl checks in on him. Tanjiro wakes up and tells her he’s so impressed with the fox-masked man’s strength. He asks her who she is.\n\nHer name is Makomo, and the boy is Sabito. After that, she pointed out Tanjiro’s bad habits and gave him pointers. They love Master Urokodaki; that’s all she says. They are not siblings, and apparently, they are orphans like him. Everyone is watching him, she says. Tanjiro doesn’t get it.\n\nShe teaches him about the breathing technique and how it can push his body into overdrive. All he has to do is work hard on it.\n\nAfter six months have passed, he challenges Sabito again. Tanjiro has a more determined look. It was decided in a blink of an eye, Tanjiro caught him first and broke his mask. Sabito smiles. Makomo congratulates him and asks him to pass the Final Selection for them. Both kids disappear. The mist fades, and Tanjiro realizes that his slash has split the rock open in two.\n\nOur Thoughts\n\nImpressive and highly unpredictable episode. It has one of the more impressive montage sequences I’ve seen in all of media. I rate this 4 out of 5.\n\nManifest Season 1 Episode 2 Recap - Reentry\n\nREAD NEXT"
