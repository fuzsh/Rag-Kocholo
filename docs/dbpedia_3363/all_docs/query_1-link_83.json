        "text": "Someone's Dream (誰 (だれ) かの夢 (ゆめ) , Dareka no Yume?) is the 45th episode of the Kimetsu no Yaiba TV anime series, and the 1st episode of its third season.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nAn Upper Rank Demon has been defeated for the first time in a hundred years by Uzui, Tanjiro, and his comrades' efforts. This news causes a ripple effect not only among the members of the Demon Slayer Corps but also among the Upper Rank Demons, who have been summoned by Muzan Kibutsuji. Meanwhile, Tanjiro is recovering at the Butterfly Mansion when he discovers that he has upset his swordsmith Haganezuka after chipping his sword and decides to head to the village where the swordsmiths live to talk to him in person.[1]\n\nPlot[]\n\nWhile walking through the torn remains of Yoshiwara, a Kakushi is shocked to see the extent of the battle before climbing over a roof and discovering Tanjiro, Inosuke, Zenitsu, and Nezuko. Elsewhere, the increasingly ill Kagaya is overjoyed to discover that an Upper Rank has been killed, the first in a hundred years, believing it to be an omen that fate is about to change dramatically and that Muzan Kibutsuji will soon fall to the current generation of Demon Slayers.\n\nFinding himself within the Infinity Castle, Akaza realizes that his summoning means that an Upper Rank demon has been killed by the Demon Slayers. Leaping off the edge of the rooms, he descends to the lower regions of the alternate dimension. He flies past a large water garden palace and eventually lands at the bottom. As the castle begins to shift, a moving platform catches Akaza and elevates his position. Several giant doors open as they sense his presence, and the demon is transported high above the moving rooms, where he finds himself passing through an endlessly large maze-like room of pillars. A biwa's strum suddenly echoes, and Akaza is taken to a platform in front of the Biwa Woman, who controls the castle.\n\nOn the platform with him is an ornate pot; as Akaza looks on, a voice from inside recognizes his presence and emerges. The djinn-like demon, made up of infantile hands and a distended body, is pleased to see him in good health and remarks that it had been 90 years since he had last seen him. Gyokko, Upper Rank Five of the Twelve Kizuki, expresses his disingenuous worry that Akaza could have died, annoying him. Crouching away from them, an anxious and skittish demon comments on Gyokko's mistaken judgement of time. Hantengu, Upper Rank Four, states that it has actually been 113 years since they were last summoned before fearfully ranting over the odd number of years about how they are not evenly divisible.\n\nUpper Three asks the Biwa Woman about Muzan's presence; when she answers that he has not arrived, he then asks about the whereabouts of Upper One, not believing that he was killed. A cheerful voice suddenly addresses Akaza. As the Infinity Castle rapidly darkens with his presence, the demon, Upper Rank Two, puts his hand on his subordinate's shoulder and asks if he was worried about him, since he is worried about his \"cherished comrades\". Gyokko greets the demon, Doma, who returns his acknowledgment by commenting on his new pot, mentioning that an old pot he was given now has a woman's severed head on top as decoration, with Gyokko commending his creativity.\n\nAngered at being touched, Akaza demands that Doma remove his arm; as he turns to face him, Upper Three repeats his order and punches off his superior's bottom jaw. Though Hantengu is frightened, Doma easily heals the massive wound and slyly comments on the punch's slightly increased power over last time, which only serves to incense Akaza further. The Biwa Woman then addresses Akaza's question and states that Upper One was summoned first and is currently listening to them. He looks at the platform's edge and sees someone kneeling in the distance. Upper Rank One, a samurai-like demon by the name of Kokushibo, states that he has been present all along before informing them that Muzan has now arrived.\n\nAppearing above the Upper Ranks at the ceiling of the Infinity Castle, Muzan informs them of Gyutaro's death and the Upper Rank's incomplete numbers while using chemistry equipment to perform private experiments. Doma apologizes, due to being the one who introduced the former Upper Six to the Twelve Kizuki, before asking if Muzan would want him to gouge his eyeballs as atonement. The Demon Progenitor denies his penance and irritably states that he knew of Gyutaro's inevitable defeat, believing that Daki was a hindrance and claiming he could have won had he poisoned the Demon Slayers and avoided a prolonged battle. He admonishes the Upper Ranks as worthless informing them that they being defeated in order of who has the most of their humanity remaining, further stating that he did not expect much of them.\n\nWhen Doma addresses his master's upset words, asking if he had ever failed to meet his expectations, Muzan states that they have failed because the Ubuyashiki family is not dead and the Blue Spider Lily is still unfound, irking Akuza. Slamming his desk, Muzan angrily asks how they could not have found it after centuries, causing his equipment and glassware to rupture, before remarking that he no longer sees a purpose in their existence if all they do is disappoint him. Hantengu becomes even more frightened and begs for mercy; Akaza remains silent, knowing of his recent failure; Kokushibo accepts his inability to refute him, but slightly defends the Upper Ranks' failure by stating that Kagaya Ubuyashiki has hidden himself well; and Doma apologizes for his subpar skills in searching.\n\nGyokko then claims he has information that would suit his goals. While speaking, the demon suddenly sees Muzan in his view, having been decapitated too quickly for him to register. Muzan speaks of his detest for change, be it situational, physical, or emotional, and deems an unchanging state and permanence superior. Even with a severed head, Gyokko enjoys himself being touched by his master and agrees with his sentiment. While reading Upper Five's memories, Muzan speaks of his anger over the first change in the Upper Ranks in 113 years and demands that Gyokko never tell him of any information which is not confirmed and to stop smiling.\n\nAs the Biwa Demon manipulates Gyokko's gravity, Muzan drops his head and addresses the Upper Ranks once more, demanding they fight with more urgency. Muzan acknowledges that their lack of effectiveness may not have been completely their fault, due to him being too lenient with them because they are Upper Ranks. He orders Gyokko to, upon confirming his information being true, travel with Hantengu to the chosen location before doors appear and close off his presence. As Hantengu complies, Gyokko becomes annoyed at being joined on his mission in light of the fact that he was the one who had obtained the information. Doma then appears beside him and asks about the information which he possesses to join him, which Gyokko does not answer. Akaza then walks behind Doma and slices off the top of Upper Two's head, annoyed that Doma would attempt to join a mission without Muzan's orders.\n\nAkaza's hand falls off, and Kokushibo instantly appears in front of him, the demon's aura startling his subordinates. Doma instantly heals his head and placates Kokushibo's anger, telling him that he did not mind the attack. Upper One instead informs him that he is not acting for his benefit but addressing a disruption in the hierarchy, as it undermines authority, which Upper Two acknowledges. Kokushibo tells Akaza to battle Doma in a battle if he is disgruntled, but Doma claims that Akaza could never defeat either of them; he adds that Akaza is simply upset due to him surpassing his rank despite being younger, as Upper Three angrily listens. He mentions that he purposely did not dodge the blow as an act of friendship and remarks that they should not scorn their subordinates.\n\nKokushibo directly addresses Akaza once more and asks if he understood what he had said. Trembling with rage, Akaza acknowledges his words and further threatens to kill him. Upper One walks away and gives his encouragement before vanishing. Doma says farewell to Kokushibo and talks to Akaza about feeling ignored in their conversation, only for Akaza to then leap upwards and leave the platform. Gyokko then orders the Biwa Demon to transport himself and Hantengu, vanishing as the strums of her biwa echo throughout the castle. Doma then tries to talk to her and invite her to his place, but she declines and transports him away from the castle center. Now back at his residence, Doma comments on his fellow demons' cold attitudes but is quickly informed by someone that new followers have come. Upper Two quickly puts on his hat and instructs them to be let in.\n\nSitting on a porch, a Demon Slayer wearing hanafuda earrings is brought tea by someone, who gently thanks him. He apologizes to his visitor for making him watch his child and for his wife being asleep, but he does not mind, stating that it is difficult to give birth and raise a child. He then adds that he will leave soon, as it is impolite to eat free food, but his host denies any disrespect, claiming that it was he who saved their lives and allowed his child to be born. He then asks for his guest’s name, wanting to preserve it, but he does not wish to identify himself despite having no heir to pass his name down; the young man insists on hearing it, as even if a charcoal seller like himself can't know it now, someone else will.\n\nTurning to his host, Sumiyoshi, the Demon Slayer states that those who master their skills will meet the same fate, even in a new era, no matter the path they take. He rejects Sumiyoshi's perception of him being special, claiming that he was unable to protect anything he cherished, could not achieve anything in life, and states that his name is as worthless as he is. Sumiyoshi begs him not to loathe himself and deny his statements; as he does, his voice fades into Tanjiro’s as he wakes up in tears, before realizing that he was witnessing a dream. As he wonders where he is, Kanao Tsuyuri, who had entered the room and dropped a vase just as he awakened, rushes over to him and explains that he had been unconscious for two months since the battle. She then mentions that she is glad he is awake, as tears form in her eyes.\n\nGoto, a member of the Kakushi and acquaintance of Tanjiro, recalls the moment when he discovered him and his friends in the remains of Yoshiwara, humorously believing they were very close and seeing them huddled together in a coma. On his way to bring some castella, when Tanjiro awakens, he sees Kanao’s broken vase and chides her for her silent demeanour and lack of awareness. He tells her he brought castella for Tanjiro, only for Tanjiro himself to weakly thank him. Dropping the dessert in utter shock, Goto angrily chastises Kanao for not saying anything about him coming out of his coma before calling out to Kiyo Terauchi, Sumi Nakahara, Naho Takada, and Aoi Kanzaki.\n\nKiyo, Sumi, and Naho are ecstatic that he has awakened, and a tearful Aoi is grateful he is alive, as he had taken her place in the mission. When he asks about his friends’ whereabouts, Goto explains that Zenitsu had recovered two days ago, while remembering when he and the Kakushi witnessed Tengen leaving the district with his wives while heavily wounded. Sumi notes that Inosuke was close to death, and Aoi explains that the poison had taken a severe toll on him. Hearing this, Tanjiro notes that he must be hallucinating that Inosuke is above them, causing all of them to look up at the ceiling. Hanging by the ceiling panels, Inosuke shocks them all by appearing alive and well. He lands on the bed, telling “Tanpachiro” that he had awoken a week before him, to Tanjiro’s relief. Inosuke jokingly insults him for making them all worry, while Naho notes that it is he who is acting abnormal, since even Shinobu was worried about his state.\n\nKiyo then shows Tanjiro a book, flipping to a page regarding the honey badger and its impressive physical durability, mentioning how Shinobu had remarked that Inosuke was akin to it. Aoi demands that Inosuke get off of Tanjiro’s bed, who then begins to argue and fight with Goto over the latter insulting him for his ludicrous thinking, leading Aoi to try and pull him away from the Kakushi. As they argue, Kanao repeatedly begs them to be quiet but is not heard, before loudly demanding that they be quiet since Tanjiro is now asleep, surprising them with her change in demeanour. Kiyo then takes Kanao away so that they can cook for Tanjiro when he wakes up. That night, Tamayo’s cat watches Tanjiro from a tree with Yushiro’s talisman on its collar, and he remarks that he is glad that the Demon Slayer is well.\n\nA week after waking up, Tanjiro is now out of bed. In a letter to Goto written by Aoi, she explains that Inosuke had returned to duty shortly after, and Zenitsu was on a joint mission with other Demon Slayers, though they were less than pleased by his constant racket, while Tanjiro had resumed Rehabilitation Training. While being stretched by the girls, he asks them about his new sword, but they become hesitant, revealing that Haganezuka had written him letters painted with his anger and blatant refusal to make him a new one. Though he is dismayed, Tanjiro is informed that he can enter the village where the swordsmiths reside. Outside the Butterfly Mansion, a female Kakushi introduces herself and explains that she will be taking Tanjiro to the village. She gives him a blindfold, ear plugs, and nose plugs to put on, as the village is kept secretive.\n\nOn his journey, Tanjiro is designated with different Kakushi along the way, who are guided by different Kasugai crows to keep the village’s exact location hidden. Eventually, he removes his blindfold and marvels at the sight of the Swordsmith Village, with all of its inhabitants wearing hyottoko masks to conceal themselves. Though he smells a nearby hot spring, he is directed by the Kakushi to the village’s chief and exuberantly thanks him; his loud cry of gratitude echoes around the forest and is heard by someone bathing in the hotsprings. The Love Hashira, Mitsuri Kanroji, realizes that someone has arrived and becomes excited.\n\nMeeting the chief, Tecchin Tecchikawahara, Tanjiro introduces himself with a respectful, albeit forceful, bow and is offered sweets. Tecchin explains that Hotaru is apparently missing at this time but that they are looking for him. Tanjiro is confused by \"Hotaru,\" but the chief explains his full name is Haganezuka Hotaru. Tecchin is dismayed at Hotaru’s fiery temper, even as a child, and Tanjiro apologizes since he was the one to chip his blade, only for the chief to ominously inform him it is the smith’s fault for making weak blades. Understanding that Tanjiro is still unable to fight demons, Tecchin advises him to visit the hot springs and heal, adding that if Haganezuka is not found when he recovers, he will be designated a new smith. Being directed to the springs, Tanjiro suddenly hears a loud voice calling to him.\n\nMitsuri ecstatically runs down the steps to meet him, while Tanjiro asks her to cover herself up. The Hashira is dismayed that she asked someone for their name and was ignored, even when she said hello. Seeing Mitsuri distressed, Tanjiro notes that dinner is ready soon, cheering her up. At the springs, Tanjiro is suddenly hit by a loose tooth. Surprised, he looks at the only person with him at the springs. Recognizing his mohawk and previous encounters, he calls out to the tall figure, Genya Shinazugawa, who immediately greets him with hostility. Tanjiro unclothes himself, swims over to introduce himself, and asks his relations with the Wind Hashira, only for Genya to slam his face into the water and leave.\n\nBack at the village, Tanjiro is impressed by the large amount of food Mitsuri has eaten; she claims she “really only nibbled.\" He explains that Genya was who she met at the springs, whom she recognizes as the brother of Sanemi Shinazugawa. As Sanemi had never told her about him having a sibling, Mitsuri and Tanjiro both became upset that they may be on bad terms since they both cherish their siblings. Seeing that Genya has not appeared, they both decide to give him onigiri. While walking to his room, Tanjiro asks the Love Hashira why she joined the Demon Slayer Corps, and she immediately becomes flustered. She explains that she joined to find someone to marry since she wanted someone strong to protect her, and seeing that she could not just introduce herself to a Hashira, she became one, rendering Tanjiro speechless.\n\nThey soon see that Genya is not in his room, and Mitsuri’s attention is directed by a Kakushi to her sword being honed, asking her to come to check on the adjustments. Tanjiro offers to walk her, but she explains that she will be leaving the village soon, leaving him and Nezuko dismayed. Seeing this, Mitsuri commends him for battling an Upper Rank and citing that such a fight contains invaluable experience. Proudly stating that she is supporting the siblings, leaving them shocked by her bright positivity, she mentions that since he has been granted an extended stay, he can train with a special weapon hidden in the village before leaving.\n\nThe next day, after having breakfast provided by the village, Tanjiro and Nezuko set out to discover the hidden weapon. While walking, he notes that, due to not being fully healed, his sense of smell is still able to smell the hot springs. Suddenly, he hears two voices arguing in the distance, one being a young swordsmith wanting to protect something and the other being a Demon Slayer demanding he use it. He notices the swordsman is the Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito, but looks on and sees something familiar. He walks closer and is shocked to see someone seemingly with him—the same man from his dream.\n\nCharacters in Order of Appearance[]\n\nAnime Notes[]\n\nThis episode first premiered in Japan on February 5, 2023, and outside of Japan on February 18, 2023 in the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nThis episode has an extended runtime of around 45 minutes of episodic content.\n\nThere are several notable differences in the episode's content compared to the content of the manga chapters it adapts.\n\nThe scene of Goto finding Tanjiro and company in Yoshiwara does not appear in the manga.\n\nThe sequence of Akaza traversing the Infinity Castle on his way to the Upper Rank Meeting does not appear in the manga.\n\nIn the manga, the letter to Goto explaining the whereabouts of Inosuke, Zenitsu, and Tanjiro is written by Kiyo, while in the anime, it is Aoi who wrote it and narrates the scene.
