Tanjiro, a kindhearted boy who sells charcoal for a living, finds his family slaughtered by a demon. To make matters worse, his younger sister Nezuko, the sole survivor, has been transformed into a demon herself.\n\nThough devastated by this grim reality, Tanjiro resolves to become a “demon slayer” so that he can turn his sister back into a human, and kill the demon that massacred his family.\"\n\nDemon Slayer Season 4 Episode 3 release date\n\nThe next Demon Slayer Hashira Training Arc episode will air on Sunday, May 26, 2024, at 11:15 pm JST.

Following a brief insight into his backstory, the previous episode also revealed why he had no plans of training Tanjiro.\n\nHis reluctance to be attached to any trainee stems from his shared past with his friend Sabito. The convoluted connections between the characters are complicated further as Sabito turns out to be the very spirit that assisted Tanjiro during his initial and formative training chapters.\n\nLike the manga's panels, future episodes will focus on character-driven conversations that build up their interconnected dynamics."
