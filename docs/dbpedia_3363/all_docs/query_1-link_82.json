        "text": "Summary:\n\nDemon Slayer Hashira Training Arc Episode 7 Summary\n\nDemon Slayer S4 Episode 8 Release Date: June 30, 2024, at 3:45 AM JST (CONFIRMED)\n\nWatch on: Crunchyroll / Netflix / Hulu\n\nEpisode 7 of Demon Slayer Season 4 was insane! We got to see so many amazing scenes, learn about Himejima's past, and see Zenitsu more focused than he has ever been. Just one week before the season finale, we have so much more to be excited about, not to mention the major cliffhanger at the end of Episode 7.\n\nWithout saying anything more, check out what happened in the episode below!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe official release of Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc Episode 8 is on June 30, 2024, at 3:45 AM JST. Some good news for fans of the show is that Episode 8 will be longer than usual, with a 60-minute runtime!\n\nHere is a timetable for the release times in different time zones:\n\nTime Zone Release Date JST 3:45 AM (June 30) PT 11:45 AM (June 30) ET 2:45 PM (June 30) GMT 6:45 PM (June 29) CET 8:45 PM (June 29)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemon Slayer Season 4 Episode 7: Recap\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, we see Tanjiro using his full strength to move the rock, which motivates Inosuke to successfully push it as well. After succeeding in his task, Himejima shows up to refresh Tanjiro with some water. This leads to a very wholesome moment between the two of them where Himejima says he will always acknowledge Tanjiro because he is a special and selfless kid. Tanjiro struggles to understand the reason behind Gyomei's certainty, which makes the Stone Hashira reveal more about his past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe then see the tragic backstory of Himejima. He was raising orphans in a temple hidden deep in the forest. Even though they lived in poverty and he had to skip meals so that the kids could have food, all of them lived happily together. That was until one night when a kid did not return home before midnight and came across a demon. To spare his life, the kid offered Himejima and the other eight orphans to the demon. He led the demon to the temple, extinguished the burning wisteria flower incense that was protecting the place, and let him in.\n\nThe demon killed seven of the orphans before Himejima managed to kill him with his own hands. However, Himejima was later framed for the murder of the kids but was saved thanks to Ubuyashiki. This was one of the saddest stories in the show and showed how pure and loving Himejima's heart is since, even though he was wronged, he still understood why young children would behave the way they did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter completing his training with the Stone Hashira, Tanjiro was allowed to continue. When he went to say his final goodbye to Zenitsu, he asked him if everything was okay since he was acting strange. We then see Zenitsu, who is typically a scaredy-cat and avoids working hard, unnaturally focused and quiet. This certainly had to do with the strange message that he received. Zenitsu is now determined to do something that \"he specifically has to do.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTanjiro arrives at his next training destination where he sees Giyu and Shinazugawa battling against each other. Their spar looked amazing with their cool abilities and skillful attacks. Thinking that they are seriously fighting, Tanjiro tries to calm them down and asks if they are fighting over ohagi, which Shinazugawa loves so much. The Wind Hashira gets angry over Tanjiro's comment about him loving sweets and leaves, but Giyu is determined to get along with him.\n\nAfter leaving, Shinazugawa notices a strange presence behind him. He turns around and squishes one of the eyes that Upper Moon Four, Nakime, sent out to spy on the Corps. He realizes that they have been infiltrated.\n\nThe one who approached them was none other than Kibutsuji Muzan himself. He finally finds Ubuyashiki's whereabouts and the two of them are now face-to-face. The episode ended in this shocking moment that left us all speechless. Muzan's entrance was honestly awesome! Now we have to suffer a whole week before seeing what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere to Watch Demon Slayer Season 4 Episode 8?\n\nFans can watch the finale of Demon Slayer Hashira Training Arc Episode 8 exclusively on the following streaming platforms:\n\nCrunchyroll\n\nNetflix\n\nHulu\n\nIf you're looking for more anime series to watch, check out some of our recommendations:\n\nBest Action Anime to Watch in 2024\n\nBest Fantasy Anime to Watch\n\nBest Comedy Anime to Watch"
