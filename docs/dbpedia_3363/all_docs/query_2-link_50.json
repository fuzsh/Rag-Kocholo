        "text": "Demon Slayer season five is officially on the way – sort of!\n\nThe show's short-but-sweet fourth season wrapped up on June 30, 2024, and fans were immediately hit with the news that Tanjiro and the gang would be returning in a series of films adapting the Infinity Castle Arc rather than a traditional fifth season.\n\nIt's hardly a surprise, given that Demon Slayer is a mammoth franchise around the world, but it's nice to know we'll likely get a complete adaptation of Koyoharu Gotouge's manga by the time the show comes to a close.\n\nHere's what we know so far.\n\nWhen does Demon Slayer season 5 come out?\n\nDemon Slayer aired its fourth season finale on June 30, and shortly after confirmed that the series would be returning in a trilogy of movies rather than season five.\n\nThe news came in the form of a short teaser trailer that walked viewers through the winding corridors of Muzan Kibutsuji's Infinity Castle before featuring characters we can expect to see reappear.\n\nUnfortunately, we didn't get any details about a potential release date (or even a release window) for any of the films.\n\nDemon Slayer season 5 voice cast and studio\n\nAlthough we've had no major cast announcements, it feels fairly safe to assume that the upcoming Demon Slayer movies will see the full cast return in various capacities. That includes:\n\n• Tanjiro Kamado – Natsuki Hanae / Zach Aguilar (English)\n\n• Nezuko Kamado – Akari Kitô / Abby Trott (English)\n\n• Inosuke Hashibira – Yoshitsugu Matsuoka / Bryce Papenbrook (English)\n\n• Zenitsu Agatsuma – Hiro Shimono / Aleks Le (English)\n\n• Muzan Kibutsuji – Toshihiko Seki / Greg Chun (English)\n\n• Water Hashira, Giyu Tomioka – Takahiro Sakurai / Johnny Yong Bosch (English)\n\n• Love Hashira, Mitsuri Kanroji – Kana Hanazawa / Kira Buckland (English)\n\n• Mist Hashira, Muichiro Tokito – Kengo Kawanishi / Griffin Burns (English)\n\n• Flower Hashira, Kanae Kocho – Ai Kayano / Bridget Hoffman (English)\n\nDemon Slayer season 5 plot: What will happen in the Demon Slayer season 5 movies?\n\nDemon Slayer season five's announcement confirmed that the series will charge head-on into the manga's Infinity Castle Arc across three new films.\n\nThe Infinity Castle story is the penultimate chapter in the Demon Slayer saga, forming the first half (roughly 47 manga chapters) of the suitably epic 'Final Battle Arc'. The Infinity Castle Arc is followed up by the story's finale, the Sunrise Countdown Arc, which takes up the manga's final 22 chapters.\n\nFans have been eagerly awaiting the Infinity Castle Arc's adaptation, which promises to massively up the action after the relative safety of season four's Hashira Training episodes.\n\nWe really don't want to give anything away for anime-only fans of the series so we'll avoid any major spoilers – but just know that this next step in Tanjiro's journey is full of some seriously dramatic clashes (and more than a few losses).\n\nIt makes sense that Ufotable would avoid trying to fit all of the Final Battle into one season of the show, given that it's the manga's longest story arc by far.\n\nIn case you didn't know, the Demon Slayer manga (created by Koyoharu Gotouge) is complete, with the final chapter being published back in April 2020.\n\nDemon Slayer season 5 trailer: Any Demon Slayer season 5 footage yet?\n\nRelated: Demon Slayer has a Nezuko problem it needs to fix in the Infinity Castle movies\n\nIt's a little early for a trailer or any teaser footage from the upcoming Demon Slayer movies, given that season four has only just finished. Be sure to check back in on this page as we wait for more news, where we'll be sure to update with any first looks.\n\nWhat we do have though is a very short teaser trailer, that you can watch above."
