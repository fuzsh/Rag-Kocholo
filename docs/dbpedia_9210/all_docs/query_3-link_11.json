        "text": "The Nepalese Rupee (NPR) is the official currency of Nepal, a landlocked country located in South Asia between India and China.\n\nThe modern Nepalese Rupee was introduced in 1932, replacing the silver mohar as the country’s official currency.\n\nThe Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, is responsible for issuing and managing the Nepalese Rupee.\n\nSubdivisions and Denominations\n\nThe Nepalese Rupee is subdivided into 100 smaller units called paisa.\n\nCoins are issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 paisa, as well as 1, 2, 5, and 10 Nepalese Rupees.\n\nBanknotes are available in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 Nepalese Rupees.\n\nExchange Rate System\n\nThe exchange rate of the Nepalese Rupee is pegged to the Indian Rupee (INR) under a fixed exchange rate system.\n\nThe Nepal Rastra Bank determines the exchange rate between the Nepalese Rupee and the Indian Rupee, and it may intervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain this peg.\n\nThe exchange rate with other currencies is determined by market forces and fluctuates according to changes in the value of the Indian Rupee.\n\nEconomy\n\nNepal has a developing economy that primarily relies on the agriculture, services, and tourism sectors. Agriculture employs a significant portion of the population and contributes to the country’s GDP.\n\nTourism is a growing industry, with Nepal being a popular destination for trekking and mountaineering, as well as cultural and spiritual tourism.\n\nThe country faces several economic challenges, such as inadequate infrastructure, political instability, and vulnerability to natural disasters like earthquakes and landslides.\n\nNepal is also one of the poorest countries in the world, with a large portion of its population living below the poverty line.\n\nChallenges and Prospects\n\nNepal’s economic challenges include a heavy reliance on agriculture, a lack of economic diversification, and inadequate infrastructure.\n\nThe country has been working to address these challenges through investment in infrastructure, economic diversification, and efforts to improve governance and public services.\n\nNepal’s long-term economic prospects depend on its ability to continue implementing reforms, manage its natural resources, and diversify its economy.\n\nAdditionally, addressing issues such as poverty, food insecurity, and environmental degradation is crucial for ensuring sustainable development.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, the Nepalese Rupee is the official currency of Nepal, and its management falls under the responsibility of the Nepal Rastra Bank.\n\nThe currency is subdivided into paisa, with coins and banknotes issued in various denominations.\n\nNepal has a developing economy with significant contributions from the agriculture, services, and tourism sectors.\n\nThe country operates under a fixed exchange rate system pegged to the Indian Rupee and faces economic challenges such as dependence on agriculture, inadequate infrastructure, and vulnerability to natural disasters."
