        "text": "Find all the must-know travel requirements and destination information on Nepal before you embark on your adventure.\n\nCurrency\n\nNepal’s central bank, the Nepal Rastra Bank, is currently in the process of phasing out old rupee notes depicting portraits of ex-kings, with new notes displaying Mount Everest. While the old notes are still accepted in limited areas of the country, it is advisable to ensure that all of the notes you receive, when exchanging currency, depict Mount Everest.\n\nThere are many official exchange services in Kathmandu — specifically at the Kathmandu Airport, exchange houses, and most banks in the city. A few of the larger hotels may offer exchange services but this is not guaranteed.\n\nAs the airport is quite small and can be crowded and chaotic, we suggest waiting until you arrive in town to exchange your money.\n\nFor your convenience and the best exchange rate, we strongly suggest exchanging all the money you will need for your Nepal tour before departing Kathmandu.\n\nBe sure to keep your exchange receipts, as you may need to present them if converting excess currency upon departure from Nepal.\n\nA few art and craft shops (not convenience stores) will accept USD. However, to ensure the best exchange rate, we recommend changing your money into local currency.\n\nPayment in hotels, travel agencies, and airlines is made in foreign exchange. Credit cards like MasterCard, Visa, and occasionally American Express, are widely accepted at major hotels, shops, and restaurants.\n\nGuests are required to keep their Foreign Exchange Encashment Receipt while making foreign exchange payments or transferring foreign currency into Nepalese Rupees. The receipts may be needed to change left-over Nepalese Rupees back into hard currency before leaving the country. However, only 10 percent of the total amount may be converted by the bank.\n\nATMs are widely available in Kathmandu.\n\nOn arrival, it is a good idea to change some money into small denominations – useful for shopping as there is rarely any change.\n\nBoth Euro and USD travellers’ cheques can be cashed relatively easily in most banks and major hotels throughout the country.\n\nPhotography\n\nPlease be sensitive when photographing people. The Nepalese are renowned for being friendly; however it is courteous to ask permission before snapping away.\n\nIf you are shooting digital and plan to take a large number of photos, be sure to bring enough memory cards or your own computer equipment/image tank onto which you can download your pictures.\n\nPassport & Visa Requirements\n\nGuests must hold both a valid passport and visa.\n\nVisas may be purchased at the border (if travelling overland) or at Kathmandu Airport.\n\nVisa processing can take up to an hour, especially during the peak season (September-May). It is advisable to arrange for a visa before entering the country. Please consult with a local Nepalese consulate.\n\nIf purchasing a visa in Nepal, guests are required to have a passport with at least two blank pages, money (tourist visa fee given below), and a passport-sized photo.\n\nTourist Visa: Good for multi entry\n\n15 days: USD 25 or equivalent convertible currency\n\n30 days: USD 40 or equivalent convertible currency\n\n90 days: USD 100 or equivalent convertible currency\n\nTourist Visa Extension: The visa extension fee for 15 days or less is USD30 or equivalent convertible currency. The visa extension fee for more than 15 days is USD2 per day. Tourist visas can be extended for a maximum period of 150 days in a single visa year (January – December).\n\nTransit Visa: Guests using the airports of Nepal for their onward journey to other countries are eligible for this visa. The visais issued for 24 hours.\n\nLuggage allowance\n\nBaggage weight on small planes in the mountains is restricted to 20kg (40 lbs), and occasionally 15kg (33 lbs). Excess baggage may have to wait for available space on a later flight.\n\nWhat the Experts Say\n\nInternet facilities are available in all cities however in rural areas the internet service may not be consistent."
