        "text": "Nepal announced on Friday (May 3) the issuance of a new ₹ 100 currency note featuring a map that includes the contentious territories of Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura, and Kalapani, previously denounced by India as \"artificial enlargement\" and \"untenable\".\n\n\"The meeting of the council of ministers chaired by Prime Minister Pushpakamal Dahal 'Prachanda' took a decision to print the new map of Nepal, which includes the Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani in the ₹ 100 denomination bank notes,\" government spokesperson Rekha Sharma told media persons while briefing about the cabinet decision.\n\n\"The cabinet approved to re-design the banknote of ₹ 100 and replace the old map printed in the background of the bank note during the cabinet meetings held on April 25 and May 2,\" Sharma, who is also the Minister for Information and Communication, added.\n\nIndia's reaction\n\nIn reaction to this move, S Jaishankar, India's Foreign Minister, disagreed with Nepal's decision to put disputed Indian areas on their new Rs 100 currency note. He said India's position on this is clear and that Nepal acted on its own. He also mentioned that even though both countries are talking about border issues, Nepal's actions won't change things on the ground.\n\n\"I saw that report. I have not looked at it in detail, but I think our position is very clear. With Nepal, we were having discussions about our boundary matters through an established platform. And then in the middle of that, they unilaterally took some measures on their side. But by doing something on their side, they are not going to change the situation between us or the reality on the ground,\" said Jaishankar while interacting with professionals in Bhubaneswar on \"Why Bharat Matters.\"\n\nAlso read | Nepal calls back its citizens recruited in Russian Army to fight against Ukraine\n\nOn June 18, 2020, Nepal finalised the revision of its political map to include three strategically significant regions—Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura—through a constitutional amendment. India strongly responded, calling it a \"unilateral act\" and criticising Nepal's \"artificial enlargement\" of territorial claims, deeming them \"untenable\". India asserts ownership of Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura.\n\nNepal's boundary spans more than 1,850 km, bordering five Indian states: Sikkim, West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.\n\nSeparately, firefighters and residents from the local area struggled against a significant wildfire on the periphery of Nepal's capital. This comes as the Himalayan nation faces an intense fire season attributed by authorities to a heatwave.\n\nAlso watch | Nepal battles raging wildfires across the country\n\nAnnually, Nepal experiences a series of wildfires, typically commencing in March. However, in recent years, both the frequency and severity of these fires have escalated, attributed to climate change resulting in drier winters.\n\nGovernment data indicates that this year, over 4,500 wildfires have been documented throughout the country, nearly twice the number reported last year. However, this figure falls short of the peak wildfire season recorded in 2021.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"
