The RBI allows travellers to carry currency notes for any amount in denominations up to ₹100, while there is a cap of ₹25,000 for ₹200 and ₹500 denominations.\n\nThe Nepalese Rupee is officially pegged to the Indian rupee. Like Bhutan, the RBI allows travellers to carry currency notes for any amount in denominations up to ₹100, while there is a cap of ₹25,000 for ₹200 and ₹500 denominations.\n\nBangladesh’s trade deficit with India crossed $10 billion in FY22 due to a big jump in imports from India. Rupee has not been declared a legal tender yet here. 1 Bangladeshi Taka is equal to ₹0.81, which is widely accepted in the country amid Bangladesh’s rising imports and falling reserves.\n\nOne Maldivian Rufiyaa is equal to ₹5.33 Indian rupees but a traveller can exchange their Indian rupees upon arrival. However, in Maldives the Indian rupee does not have transactional value and it is important to carry a convertible currency like the US dollar.\n\nIndia was ranked among Zimbabwe’s top five export partners with trade worth $162 million in 2020. It added Indian rupee to the basket of eight currencies it uses, after discontinuing its local currency in 2009 due to hyperinflation."
