        "text": "Nepal has its currency. The Nepal currency’s name is the Nepalese Rupees.\n\nWould it be fantastic to go on trips without worrying about money? It would, but we live in a capitalist world that demands us to carry cash wherever we go. Or bring some form of money, at least.\n\nThe situation can be quite saddening, but the reward of traveling that we get is exhilarating. Also, traveling to a new country can be a way of knowing many people and learning about their culture and traditions. In addition, traveling opens up one’s mind and makes them receptible to new changes and ideas. Finally, traveling also makes you aware of how much the world contains beauty and can put you in awe.\n\nAll these benefits do make one travel all around the world. Whatever your method of traveling, rugged backpack adventures, or luxurious stays around the globe, it doesn’t discriminate. And Nepal is such a country that can serve the best of both worlds.\n\nNepal is a small yet wondrous country with scenic beauties, exciting trails, and kind people. The area of Nepal might be small, but the things you will experience might be even more significant than the solar system. What’s there not to like about Nepal? It is filled with immense culture and religious harmony and has its unique sector in any way you go.\n\nBut first, before visiting any country, you must be aware of the monetary planning of that country. The list of things you should know ranges from Nepal currency and symbols, the places to get Nepali cash, the conversion of Nepali currency to your nation’s currency, and the methods of using the money. There are other things you should consider, too, based on your way of traveling, but these are the basics.\n\nSo, let’s get started!\n\nNepal Currency Name And Symbol\n\nNepal has its own currency. The Nepal currency’s name is the Nepalese Rupees. In addition, the Nepalese Rupees symbol is NPR. Rs. also represent the NPR. symbol. However, it is essential to remember that Rs. is also used as INR., the Indian Rupees symbol.\n\nFinally, Nepal’s currency name and symbol are Nepalese Rupees and NPR. respectively.\n\nAlso, the Nepalese currency system divides one Nepalese Rupee into 100 Nepalese paisa or P. Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal’s central bank, controls the influx of Nepal currency.\n\nNepal’s currency comes in the form of coins and paper notes. The paper notes range from 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000. The coins range from 1, 2, and 5. However, Nepal uses coins less today than it used to before.\n\nAlso, Nepal’s currency used to have symbols of its kings before Nepal became democratic on May 28, 2008. Now, the paper notes have various animals and birds printed on them. This wildlife is also the pride of Nepal. In addition, all the Nepali Rupees have a rhododendron, the national flower of Nepal, watermarked on them.\n\nThe Nepali notes with their color and the wildlings it has printed on them are as below:\n\na) The Nepali Rs. 5 Note\n\nThe Nepali Rs. 5 note has Mount Everest and the Kasthamandap Temple printed on its front. At the same time, it has a picture of a yak on its back. Also, the color of this note is mainly pink and lilac.\n\nb) The Nepali Rs. 10 Note\n\nThe Nepali Rs. 10 note combines lilac, brown, green, and white in a beautiful symphony. At the front or obverse side, has the Garud Narayan and Mount Everest printed on it. While on the backside, one can see a gorgeous black buck on a field.\n\nc) The Nepali Rs. 20 Note\n\nMount Everest and Krishna Temple, a famous temple from the Patan area of Nepal, and the Garuda atop pillar adorn the obverse side of the Nepali Rs. 20 note. Also, on the note’s reverse side, a Sambar Deer beautifies it. The note has mainly red and orange, and white color combinations.\n\nd) The Nepali Rs. 50 Note\n\nOn the obverse side of the Nepali Rs. 50 note, one can see the stunning Ram Janaki Temple, a renowned temple from Janakpur of Nepal, and Mount Everest. Also, on the reverse side of the note, Thar, a Himalayan male Goat, is printed. The note’s primary colors are blue, green, and purple on a white background.\n\ne) The Nepali Rs. 100 Note\n\nMount Everest and the gorgeous Mayadevi temple inside a silvery oval adorn the obverse side of the Nepali Rs. 100 note. Also, one can see the map of Nepal, wood carvings from the temple of Taleju in Kathmandu, and the Ashoka pillar on the front side of the Rs. 100 note. Finally, on the same side, a statement reads, “Lumbini Birthplace of Lord Buddha.”\n\nOn the reverse side of the note, one can see a one-horned rhino. The note has a lilac and green color central combination. Also, the Nepali Rs. 100 note is blind-friendly.\n\nf) The Nepali Rs. 500 Note\n\nThe central color combination of The Nepali Rs. 500 Note is violet and brown. In addition, there are a series of things on the obverse side of this note. They are Mount Everest, Mount Amadablam, Thyangboche monastery, God Indra, clouds, and wood carvings. Finally, on the reverse side, a Tiger is printed.\n\ng) The Nepali Rs. 1000 Note\n\nMount Everest, Harati temple, and Swayambhunath stupa adorn the obverse side of the Nepali Rs. 1000 note. Also, on the reverse side, one can see twin Asian elephants. Finally, the primary colors of this note are gray and blue.\n\nWhere to get the Nepalese Rupee?\n\nIt can be unclear whenever someone enters a new country where one should get the visiting country’s currency. The options are endless. One can exchange the country’s money in your home country. Or one can use their currency if it is acceptable in the visiting nation. And finally, one can exchange it for the visiting country’s currency once one reaches the land.\n\nYou can take a similar route to get the Nepalese Rupee.\n\na) Nepal Currency From ATMs\n\nNepal has ATMs in almost every town and city. But, it would be intelligent if one takes out their money from ATMs found around Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, or Pokhara. This is because the ATMs in other areas of Nepal, except Kathmandu and Pokhara, tend to be unreliable and might not accept foreign cards.\n\nAlso, withdrawing cash during the daytime is wise. So that if one encounters any problem with the withdrawal, contacting the associated bank can be an immediate process. The withdrawal of cash can be in either foreign currency or Nepali currency.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that Northern Ireland and Scottish banknotes are not acceptable in Nepal. If you are from Scotland and Northern Ireland, exchanging the money on arrival to Nepal is a safe bet.\n\nMost of the ATMs in Nepal will have a limit on one-time withdrawals, but you can use the machine multiple times. Also, your bank may deduct Rs. 500 or more each time you withdraw cash.\n\nb) Nepal Currency By Exchanging\n\nIn Nepal, the Nepali government has set an official exchange rate. Exchanging your money from significant banks in Nepal can exchange your money at the prescribed exchange rate. However, local exchange shops and hotels may take a little extra.\n\nBut always remember to keep your money exchange receipts and to take your passport whenever you need to exchange money.\n\nc) Nepal Currency: Debit and Credit Card\n\nYou can use debit and credit cards from your home country in Nepal in hotels, some upper market vendors, and shops.
