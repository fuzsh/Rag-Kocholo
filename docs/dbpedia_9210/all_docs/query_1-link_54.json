Credit card purchases are supported. Free / BYOL offers are supported for all customers.\n\nHow we convert currency\n\nFor all paid offer types, you have the option of entering prices in USD or uploading prices in local currency. Prices entered in USD are automatically converted to the static local currency of customers according to the exchange rate at the time you first save the price for the plan, in the Pricing and Availability page, in Partner Center.\n\nYou can export the prices and review the converted equivalents. To ensure prices are right for each locality before you publish them, or to adjust any price before you publish:\n\nExport the pricing spreadsheet.\n\nReview the prices in each market.\n\nUpload (Import) the spreadsheet to Partner Center.\n\nTo change the price of an offer that has already been published, see Changing prices in active commercial marketplace offers. It takes at least 90 days for price increases to become effective for your customers.\n\nCustomers see the offer price in their tenant currency, or in their billing account currency if the customers have selected a specific subscription for their purchase.\n\nMicrosoft receives payments from customers in the customer account billing currency and pays you in the currency you selected in the Partner Center. Microsoft converts the customer currency using the exchange rate of the month of the transaction.\n\nMicrosoft converts offer prices using exchange rates sourced directly from the WMR exchange rates (4pm London WM/Refinitiv). Microsoft sources WMR rates on a monthly basis.\n\nThe following illustration shows the currency conversion flow, with up to 3 different foreign exchanges used, depending on the offer currency, customer agreement currency, and ISV currency:\n\nOptions to manage local prices, for example in cases where markets have high foreign exchange rate variations\n\nOnce a plan is created and saved, the prices in all local currencies are static and aren't updated automatically, for example when there are foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\nAs an ISV, you have several options available to minimize the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations:\n\nStop selling in a specific market or markets\n\nUpdate the prices of a published offer, to set specific local currency prices, using 1 of 2 options:\n\nYou can review the local market prices, using the Export capability in Pricing & Availability, and then update any local market prices (using Import), and then republish the plan â don't forget to update all the plans in an offer.\n\nModify the USD base price of a plan, save and republish the plan. This will update the local market prices using the most recent available foreign exchange rate. It takes at least 90 days for price increases to be visible to customers.\n\nUse Private Offers to customize the local price to be paid by the customer\n\nIf possible, set up the Private Offer as an upfront one-time payment, so that the exchange rate variations are as small as possible\n\nIf possible, have the customer billing profile to be set in USD\n\nFor multi-year deals, plan them as several one-year private offers, each with an upfront one-time payment\n\nNote\n\nIf an offer has hidden plans, or has plans targeting government clouds, prices can't be updated. The only option is to stop selling that plan in those markets, and then create a new plan for that market with the new prices."
