        "text": "A rupee is a form of currency, similar to the pound sterling, the euro, and the US dollar, of some prominence throughout Asia and the greater Pacific region. The rupee is one )of the oldest forms of currency, appearing in historical (though occasionally disputed) references dating back to 340 BC and earlier. Although use of the rupee has faded from its historical peak, its use in India—the second-most-populous country in the world—ensures its place as one of the world's most important currencies.\n\nLike other major currencies such as the peso and the franc, the rupee has several variations (typically one per country), which often have distinct monetary values. India has also created a digital rupee, a fully virtual rupee that is also official legal tender, to compete with BitCoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnlike other major currencies, the word rupee has a wide range of alternate spellings and linguistic cognates, including roupie, rupie, rufiyaa, rupiah, and roepiah—however, the visually similar term ruble refers to an entirely different currency. The name rupee is also given to the fictional in-game currency used in Nintendo's Legend of Zelda videogame franchise.\n\nCountries That Use Rupees:\n\nCountry/TerritoryRupee typeISO 4217 Code$1 USD (23 Nov 2022) =BhutanIndian rupee/Bhutanese ngultrum*INR/BTN81.73 INR/BTNIndiaIndian rupeeINR81.73 INRIndonesiaIndonesian rupiahIDR15,631.68 IDRMaldivesMaldivian rufiyaaMVR15.40 MVRNepalNepalese rupeeNPR130.82 NPRPakistanPakistani rupeePKR223.95 PKRSeychellesSeychellois rupeeSCR13.42 SCRSri LankaSri Lankan rupeeLKR365.49 LKR\n\n* Bhutan currently uses two main currencies: the Indian rupee and the Bhutanese ngultrum, whose value is pegged 1:1 with the Indian rupee.\n\nCountries That Previously Used Rupees*:\n\nCountry/TerritoryRupee TypeYear ReplacedCurrent CurrencyISO 4217 codeAfghanistanAfghanistan Kabuli rupee1927Afghan afghaniAFNBahrainPersian Gulf rupee1966Bahraini dinarBHDBangladeshPakistani rupee1972Bangladeshi takaBDTBurundi (as German East Africa)German East Africa rupie1916Burundian francBIFCocos (Keeling) IslandsIndian rupee1945Australian dollarAUDDjiboutiIndian rupee1943Djiboutian francDJFIraqIndian rupee1931Iraqi dinarIQDKenya (as British East Africa)East African rupee1920Kenyan shillingKESKuwaitPersian Gulf rupee1961Kuwaiti dinarKWDMyanmar (as Burma)Burmese rupee1952Burmese kyatMMKOmanPersian Gulf rupee1970Omani rialOMRQatarPersian Gulf rupee1966Qatari rialQARRwandaGerman East African rupie1916Rwandan francRWFSomalia (as Italian/British Somaliland)Indian rupee1925/1951Somali shillingSOSTanzania (as Tanganyika)East Africa rupee1920Tanzania shillingTZSThailandIndian silver rupee**1902Thai bhatTHBTibetTibetan silver rupee1951Chinese yuan renminbiCNYTimor LesteIndonesian rupee2002US dollarUSDUgandaEast Africa rupee1920Ugandan shillingUGXUnited Arab Emirates (as the Trucial States)Persian Gulf rupee1966Emirati dirhamAEDYemenIndian rupee1951Yemeni rialYERZimbabweIndian rupee**2019Zimbabwean dollarZWD\n\n* Notes:\n\n— Currencies listed as currently in use are not necessarily the same currencies that replaced the rupee. In some cases, the currency that replaced the rupee has itself been replaced with one or more newer currencies. In these cases, only the currency presently in use is listed.\n\n— Similarly, for countries that have used multiple variations of rupee during their history, the most recent version used is listed. For example, Bangladesh used the Indian rupee from 1835-1948, but replaced it with the Pakistani rupee from 1948-1972, so the Pakistani rupee is the variant listed.\n\n— Countries marked ** had at least one additional form of official currency in addition to rupees.\n\nIs a Rupee Worth a Lot of Money?"
