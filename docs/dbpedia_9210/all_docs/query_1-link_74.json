        "text": "Geography\n\nNepal is a landlocked country in South Asia south of China and is surrounded on 3 other sides by India. The country runs along the high ridge of the Himalayas, with Mount Everest at 8848 meters on the border with China. A total of 36 of the highest mountains in the world are located in Nepal or its border region. These include 8 peaks over 8000 meters high. On average, the country is 3265 meters above sea level, making it one of the highest countries in the world.\n\nNepal has a total area of 147,181 km², which is only slightly larger than the area of Iowa. There are 30.90 million people living here. The population density is therefore 209.9 inhabitants per km², but large parts of the country are not habitable due to their topography. The proportion of the urban population is extremely low at just 21.5%, meaning that the majority of the population is spread across rural areas. The capital Kathmandu, located at an altitude of 1400 meters, is the largest city in the country, but has less than 1 million inhabitants and only just over 100,000 households."
