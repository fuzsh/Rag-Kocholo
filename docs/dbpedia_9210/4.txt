The Nepalese rupee (Nepali: रुपैयाँ, Roman: Rupaiyām̐; symbol: रु.; code: NPR) is the official currency of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal. The Nepalese rupee is subdivided into 100 paisa. The issuance of the currency is controlled by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal. The Nepalese rupee was introduced in 1932 when it replaced the Nepalese mohar at the rate 2:1.[2][citation needed]

The Nepalese rupee (रु.) has been pegged to the Indian rupee (₹) at the rate रु.1.60 = ₹1 since 1994; prior to this, it had been pegged at the rate रु.1.45 = ₹1.[3]
