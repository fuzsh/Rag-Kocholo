Maverick Publishing was launched in 2009 by Steve Bicknell. Maverick has gone from strength to strength developing a list with a strong emphasis on quality and encouraging children to enjoy reading. The early reader scheme has become a large part of Maverickâ€™s publishing programme and is continuously growing. The scheme is built on using natural English to encourage children to read stories, which are written in a more familiar style of language.

For our original texts we work with some fantastic authors, with a huge amount of experience either in writing for education or working within the education sector. We have a strict set of guidelines and all of our texts go through many checks before publication. We also adapt some of our picture books into early readers, you will find more information about the authors on our maverickbooks.co.uk page.
