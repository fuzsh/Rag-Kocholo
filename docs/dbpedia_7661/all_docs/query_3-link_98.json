        "text": "Wet, cold, and wild, Will Copestake explores the uncomfortable edge of the world.\n\nAfter earning the impressive title of Adventurer of The Year in 2015, Will Copestake has seen his endless explorations and adventures take him across the globe.\n\nWill’s career is now split between leading outdoor pursuits and photography. Through his company Kayak Summer Isles, which he co-runs with a great friend on the North West Coast of Scotland. Here he leads expeditions in the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and the Summer Isles. As a guide and coach, his ongoing philosophy is to provide guests with the skills and knowledge they need to experience meaningful adventures through their own confidence and comfort.\n\nIn winter, he often takes this career south to Patagonia, where he works at Kayak En Patagonia, leading guests into one of the wildest areas on earth.\n\nWe love Will's passion and knowledge of the environments he explores, the local history, culture, flora, and fauna.\n\nHarry Timson has several British titles and English awards up his sleeve, including aerialist of the year in 2012.\n\nNewquay, UK local Harry Timson is considered one of britain’s most exciting free-surfers. Becoming the surf brand Volcom UK poster-boy, Harry has hit the jackpot, spending his time travelling the world in search of the best waves.\n\nRoger Green, founder, owner and Managing Director of Nite Watches, has always been at the very core of the Maverick community.His philosophy in life is rooted in carving his own path and embracing a daring and single-minded attitude, regardless of the challenges he faces. This maverick approach is reflected not only in his professional endeavours but also in his personal pursuits. Despite reaching retirement age, Roger's adventurous spirit continues to thrive as he joins the Nite Mavericks in remote and untamed locations, pushing boundaries, and extracting the utmost from life's experiences.\n\nJake Best is a man who truly maximises every minute of every day.\n\nHaving previously served in the military, fitness has long been a passion of Jake’s which led him on a path through to a spell in professional boxing.\n\nWork wise Jake is a founding Director of Clearwater Dynamics who offer a vast range of maritime solutions globally, being responsible for in excess of 5,000 vessels.\n\nJake continues to push himself day in, day out and is now the proud holder of multiple world records gained raising money and awareness for a variety of charities.\n\nWe continue to be blown away by Jake’s energy and ability to excel across multiple disciplines.\n\nHaving joined the Marines aged only 16 and going on to pass Commando Training first time despite struggling through the entire process because of his young age and an uncontrollable stammer, David knows first-hand what it takes to push forward when times are tough and achieve anything he sets his mind to with a non-quitting mindset.\n\nBased at 45 Commando throughout his military career, David served just shy of 8 years in the Corps embarking on exercises and operations all around the world including a 6-month tour of Afghanistan aged 18 where he was involved in a grenade explosion suffering multiple injuries and requiring 28 stitches to his neck, arms, legs and buttocks.\n\nDavid is now the proud owner of Civvy 2 Commando, a company that both physically and mentally prepares civilians with aspirations of joining the Royal Marines to give them the best possible head start on basic training and increase their likelihood of becoming a Commando. Intent on practicing what he preaches about stepping out of your comfort zone and becoming comfortable being uncomfortable, David has now gone full circle in the recovery of his stammer by stepping into the public and motivational speaking sector."
