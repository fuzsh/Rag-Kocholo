        "text": "Glen Powell will never forget the moment during Top Gun: Maverick production when he blew Tom Cruise away—with a pair of darts. “I hit two bull’s-eyes in a row, and Tom literally lost his mind as if I’d won the lottery and hugged me,” Powell recalls. “He’s like, ‘That was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen!’”\n\nThat deadly dart’s accuracy is the movie’s introduction of Powell’s cocky pilot Hangman, and opens the 11-minute sequence that unofficially kicks the Top Gun sequel into high gear. Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Cruise) has just been summoned back to the Top Gun school in San Diego to train a group of young pilots to carry out a seemingly impossible and dangerous mission. Complicating matters is that one of the candidates is Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of Maverick’s late copilot, Goose (Anthony Edwards). A defeated Maverick heads to the local Hard Deck bar for a beer, setting up a busy and mesmerizing scene. The majority of the new cast is introduced, including Jennifer Connelly as Maverick’s old flame Penny; the key dynamics between the young pilots are established; Cruise is thrown out of the bar on his ass; and there’s time for an electric musical performance. With so many balls in the air, Powell is thankful that the spotlight is being put on the fact that director Joseph Kosinski successfully brought it all together.\n\n“This scene was so unbelievably difficult to pull off because it has to do so much heavy lifting and feel so effortless,” Powell says. “Us actors, this was the first or second day of shooting, so I don’t think anybody knew what we were in for; we were all focused on our own lanes. But talking to Joe about it, he knew it had to work.”\n\nThe Hard Deck bar was built from scratch, right on the beach in Coronado, but Kosinski says the scene was inspired by a very real place—the officers club at Top Gun school in Fallon, Nevada, which Kosinski visited while prepping for production in 2017. He made the same mistake Maverick does, putting his cell phone on the bar, and bought a round of drinks for everyone as punishment. “It was a really fun night, and it showed me that I had to have an officers-club scene in the film,” Kosinski says.\n\nThe sequence in the film required 100 actors in that very small space, and was filmed in two parts, when the crew returned to the set in the spring of 2019 to make a crucial adjustment to the relationship between Maverick and Penny.\n\n“We realized it needed to start from a different place,” Kosinski says. “So we went back and reshot most of their opening interaction so that they had been on and off over the years. The first version we shot they had not seen each other since 1985, which ended up being too much of a stretch.”\n\nAt the Hard Deck, the action is mostly separated into two groups, with the young crop of pilots all coming together by the pool table while Maverick and Penny catch up at the bar. But Hangman briefly separates from his counterparts to cash in on Maverick buying a round, and razzes the “old-timer,” who Hangman doesn’t yet know is his instructor. Still figuring out Hangman and how he wanted to approach him, Powell was worried that the character could easily just be viewed as a 2.0 version of Top Gun’s Iceman (Val Kilmer). He unexpectedly had time to talk with his own instructor.\n\n“It’s a character that can risk being over the top, especially with the way he speaks and how he interacts with the group; it’s a little sensitive,” Powell says. “The scene where I go up to the bar and talk to Jennifer and Tom, the cameras were having some issues that day, and so we went down for a little bit, and I just got to kick it with Tom. We were talking about one of my favorite movies, Rain Man, and he told me about how he found that character [Charlie Babbitt] and [about] questioning if you’re likable. You could see him track back to his entire career of questioning how an audience will digest certain things, and he was really gifting me all that.”\n\nWhen Cruise and Kosinski, who previously collaborated on 2013’s Oblivion, weren’t playing professor, they spent the most time tinkering with the various introductions and how to shoot them. Hangman, Penny, Phoenix (Monica Barbaro), Bob (Lewis Pullman), Fanboy (Danny Ramirez), and Payback (Jay Ellis) all appear for the first time in the Hard Deck scene, but the true movie star arrival is reserved for Teller’s Rooster, who has already been glimpsed in a few pictures that Maverick keeps around. “He needed something special with that sort of buildup,” Kosinski says.\n\nThe result was Rooster pulling up in an old Bronco (a choice based on Teller’s real-life vehicle), with his face not being visible until he struts in wearing sunglasses and casual clothes. “It’s always great if, in the filmmaking, you can intentionally hide someone coming,” Kosinski explains. “I scrambled to get that shot of him stepping out of the Bronco. You’ve got this magic hour, that last-light feel, and we’d just shot the beach football scene right nearby, and I remember running over there to grab this shot of him. It’s one of those shots where it’s as dependent on the movement and choreography of the car and the camera as it is on the actor.”\n\nHe has another grand-arrival moment in the bar, a dolly shot that Kosinski says Teller struggled with at first, “because it’s one of those things that looks great on film but feels a bit unnatural when you’re doing it.” And it adds subtle emotion to the moment when Rooster and Maverick finally come face-to-face later on. Adds Kosinski, “When you see that joy with Phoenix and the way he treats people, you know what kind of guy he is, so that when Maverick steps into the movie you can see that flip and understand how much healing there is to do when it comes to that relationship.”\n\nKosinski believes that all of the actors playing the young pilots made a distinct impression in this sequence, which he knows is “sometimes hard to do in a Tom Cruise film.” He specifically points to Pullman coming up with the idea that Bob would have a pile of half-eaten peanuts on the chair in front of him, or Powell deciding that Hangman would casually take the pool cue from Bob as he’s about to shoot it. Powell appreciates that his director got such a kick out of that moment and how much it says about who Hangman is, but he also has a bit of a bone to pick with Kosinski. “I had taken pool lessons for about a month and a half,” the actor says of the scene that wound up being a close-up in the movie. “And one of the biggest bummers for me was the fact that I had worked on this, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I worked for a month and a half on this damn shot and no one knows!’” Well, he’ll always have those bulls-eyes, which, ironically, he did not train for.\n\nIn a standout scene from the first film, Goose sits down at a piano, in a bar, and performs Jerry Lee Lewis’s “Great Balls of Fire” alongside Maverick and young Bradley (then played by Aaron and Adam Weis). It’s a moment that is remixed and paid homage to in Maverick, with Rooster unplugging the Hard Deck’s jukebox and following in his dad’s footsteps.\n\n“One of the most memorable nights was when Miles sang ‘Great Balls of Fire’ for the first time,” Kosinski says. “It was a live performance. He sang and played it on the day for everyone, which for him, I think, was a terrifying thing to take on. We released a pseudo-music-video where you get to see more of Miles’s performance, and the ‘Rooster’ chant at the end where he gets up and dances was all spontaneous. It was his last shot of the week, and just the energy that the crowd was giving to Miles, and he was giving back to them—to be able to capture that as it happened was one of the greatest nights on the movie [set].”\n\nMeanwhile, Powell was taken aback by one Easter egg in his onscreen rival’s big performance. “Right behind Miles is my dad,” he reveals with a laugh. “I went to craft services, came back, and literally on all four monitors was my dad and Miles. When you see the iconic shot of Miles playing the piano, that’s Hangman’s family just loving on Rooster. I was like, ‘Man, what a traitor!’”\n\nThe majority of this lengthy sequence is seen from Maverick’s point of view, a decision Kosinski and his editor, Eddie Hamilton, arrived at in the editing room. The POV makes room for flashbacks to the original Top Gun, with Goose singing at his own piano. “That was a wonderful discovery, and the moment I saw the first pass at it I was like, ‘This is really emotional, it’s going to work,’” Kosinski says. “Even if you haven’t seen the first movie, it almost feels like magic because it’s as if you’re going into Maverick’s memories.”\n\nIt’s a complex, emotional sequence for Cruise, as Maverick goes from flirting with Penny to mourning his departed wingman. “There’s no one better at being able to communicate what he’s feeling in the moment, even with just a look, a glance, or a smile, than Tom,” says Kosinski. “There’s so much focus on his stunt work when it comes to how skilled he is at mastering all these different things, but the subtlety of the performance, the amount of information he can convey in a scene where he says very little—I just think it’s an incredible performance that should get as much attention as all the other amazing stuff he does.”\n\nBy the time that Rooster is dazzling the Hard Deck patrons with “Great Balls of Fire,” Maverick has been thrown out of the bar, literally. When he doesn’t have the cash to cover his pricey tab, Penny has him escorted out, as Payback, Coyote, and Hangman are tasked with picking him up and, lightly, dropping him outside on the sand. For Powell, that meant that his dad, plus 30 of his friends who served as extras, were cheering him on while he attempted not to injure Top Gun’s leading man.\n\n“The stunt people were so nervous,” Powell says. “They came up to me and went, ‘Hey, man, I know you’re going to throw Tom off the stairs into the sand, and we really cannot hurt Tom.’ I’m like, ‘Trust me, I do not want to hurt Tom.’”\n\nThe suggestions changed from “maybe more like a toss” to “don’t even touch Tom,” but when the camera rolled, Cruise had other ideas. “He goes, ‘I fall off of buildings for a living. This is three stairs,’” Powell says. “‘Throw me off the stairs into soft sand, man, I’m good.’ It was funny because Tom is the greatest stuntman ever and everybody was being so careful. Tom’s a badass and can fall off stairs very easily.”\n\nAnother impossible mission completed.\n\nListen to Vanity Fair’s Little Gold Men podcast now."
